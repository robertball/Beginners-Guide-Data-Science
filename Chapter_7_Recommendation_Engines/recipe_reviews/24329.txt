I have made this recipe for probably about 16 years now. I wanted to throw out there some suggestions to make it taste more authinic. #1.Use bacon grease instead of vegetable oil. #2. Add chopped garlic with your chopped onions and bell peppers. #3. Saute your onions, garlic, and bell pepper first before adding the rice. #4. Brown rice well. #5. Use chicken broth instead of water!!!! It gives it that much more flavoring. #6. Add in about a 1/2 teaspoon of ground cumino. This spice you will find in all true mexican food but it is very strong a little makes it wonderful....a lot is too overpowering and can ruining a dish. #6. Add some parsely to it. I love parsley and use it in every dish. The best rice to use for this meal is long grain. I will be serving it tonight with homemade Empanadas. I hope my additions helps.

I am a great lover of Spanish cooking and recipes, and have several of my own.  This is probably the best rice recipe I have tasted--after I made two alterations.  I used Chicken stock in place of water, and I added 1 large seeded and diced jalepeno to the green peppers.  This gave it the little added "bite" that I was used to in Spanish cuisine.  Five cheers for Dave on this fine recipe.  I will make it many more times, as my small family and many friends agreed with me on the outcome.  Thanks again, Dave.

A fine recipe on its own, but can be perfected(at least to my tastes) with a few alterations.

2 tablespoons olive oil 
1 cup uncooked white rice 
2 green onions, chopped 
1 large jalepeno, chopped and seeded
1 1/2 cups chicken broth
1/2 cup tomato sauce 
1 (10 ounce) can diced tomatoes and green chiles 
1 1/2 teaspoons chili powder.
1/2 teaspoon crushed cayenne pepper. 
1 teaspoon salt 

Saute onions and jalepeno seperately, set aside.  Brown rice, add back in the sauted veggies, and follow recipe as is.

I would suggest reserving the rest of the chicken stock, and stir the rice every 10 minutes of simmering.  It can easily burn unattended.  Add more stock if needed.

When rice is done(after about 25 minutes), fluff with fork and serve.  Color, taste, and texture should be restaurant quality.

Nice recipe! I used beef broth instead of water, and added some minced garlic and 3/4 teaspoon of cumin. Just before serving I topped this off with some shredded cheddar cheese.  Delicious!

A friend of mine makes a wonderful spanish rice and i couldnt get her on the phone so i looked this one up. I was very happy with my decision. My whole family loved this recipe. I used 1 1/2 teaspoons cumin and one teaspoon chili powder because my friend used cumin and i wanted to add it to mine. I love this combination and it will be a regular in my house! thank you

I followed another reviewers advice and added a clove of garlic.  I used a heaping teaspoon of chili powder (2 seemed too much to me) & have to say this was some of the best Spanish rice I've ever had the pleasure of eating.  I will definately be making this again.  Went great with Carne Asada!  Thanks Dave!  :O)

Very good! And very simple. 
I did substitute a can of low sodium chicken broth for the water, added a little chopped garlic, and used a can of Rotell Fiesta flavor tomatoes with cilantro and lime juice.
I made fajitas and served this as a side dish topped with Mexican blend cheese and sliced olives, and I should have doubled the recipe! It was gone in a flash!
This one is a keeper! So easy and taste BETTER than the rice in most restaurants! Thanks!

Like most others, I used chicken stock instead of water.  Mine was too spicy...next time I'll add less chili powder.  There was a big difference in the taste of this recipe and a box.  This tasted so fresh...will definitely make this again.  Thanks!

This is a great rice recipe!  I made it last weekend for my Mothers birthday and everyone loved it.  I added a few sprinkles of cumin, but other than that didn't stray from the recipe, thanks Dave.

What an easy Spanish Rice recipe.  It was much better than the stuff from a box.  The only change I made was to use a can of tomatoes and a can of green chilies (I didn't have a can with).

I must have forgotten to rate this one... I've made this recipe many times.  As written it is a 4 star recipe (I made it this way several times).  But something was missing... Another reviewer figured it out - ADD 1 teaspoon cumin.  Decrease Chili powder to 1 teaspoon.  It makes all the difference!  Great, easy recipe!

Maybe I'm not doing it right but it turned out soggy and bland.  I had to add a lot of seasoning to spice it up, but I couldn't make it less soggy.  Won't make again.

This is the best rice I have ever made. However, I took some suggestions from other reviewers and made the following changes. I used bacon grease instead of oil. Be sure you use long grain rice such as Uncle Ben's. Using a 12 inch skillet saute garlic, onion and the green pepper for just a minute then add rice and continue sauteing until the rice is well browned. Substitute chicken broth for the water. The recipe does not specify the brand of tomatoes but use Rotel brand which is 10 ounces. If you use regular diced tomatoes they are 15 ounces which probably contributed to some reviewers having soggy rice. Plus Rotel tomatoes add to the spicy flavor of this recipe. Chili powders vary a lot in hotness. I used a mexican chili powder and added 1/2 teaspoon of ground cumin. The rice was perfectly spicy for us but would probably have been too spicy for children or even some adults.

This recipe would make a wonderful and tasty one dish meal by simply added shredded chicken, ground beef, sausage of meat of your choice to it. Tonight I'm trying it with ground beef and will substitute beef broth for the chicken broth.

Yummy!  I used chicken broth instead of water based on other recommendations.  I also substituted red bell pepper for the green because that's all I had on hand.  Tasted a lot better than the boxed rice!

I've made many spanish rice recipes in the hopes of finding one that truely tasted like spanish rice, and this is that recipe! I followed some other people's advice by adding chicken broth instead of water, adding a generous teaspoon of cumin, and one diced up jalapeno. In addition I rinsed the rice well and let dry before I browned it with the other ingredients, though this is not included in the original directions. I've only begun washing my rice before cooking when I tried this recipe. I read on a lot of reviews that it was necessary and boy were they right! I will never use another spanish rice recipe.....ever!

My whole family loves this rice.  I make it in the rice cooker and it turns out perfect.  I change nothing to it.  The spice is just right for my 2 year old twins and still is just right for me and my husband.

This was delicisious but from the beginning I knew there would be too much liquid since the can of tomatoes has liquid in it. I reduce the water to 1.5 cups to compensate for the water from the can of tomatoes and it came out PERFECTO!  I also added cummin and fresh celantro. YUMMO!!!

I loved this recipe.  I had everything on hand so I decided to make this with enchiladas.  Next time I would add some garlic and maybe a few more seasonings but it's a great basic recipe.

This was fantastic!!!  For those of you who think it is soggy/mushy....DO NOT stir it. Just put the lid on and let it go.  I used long grain rice and cooked for only 15 minutes and it was perfect!!!

Making this was magical in the sense that it created something I'd had no idea how to do; Mexican restaurant rice!  I love this rice, it's half the reason I go out for Mexican, and now I know the secret.  Thank you!

Very good!  We are trying to eat healthier and those packaged rices are so full of sodium and fat I wanted to try my own.  This is it!  I did use one can of lower sodium chicken broth (plus a little water to equal two cups total).  I also added 1/2 tsp of cumin and only 1/2 tsp of salt.  I didn't have canned tomatoes with chilis, so I used one small can (14 oz) of whole tomatoes, cut up (used  only 1/2 the liquid) and 1 tbsp of canned mild chilis.
It was delicious, and I really like that I can control the amount of sodium and fat!

YUM!  I used brown rice but otherwise made no changes.  The one thing I would caution is allow plenty of time for the rice to simmer down- mine needed about 35 minutes total.  However, the end result is so delicious.  I will definitely be making this again.

I tried this tonight because I was looking for a new rice recipe, and I had everything here to make it! We don't eat meat anymore, so I doubled the recipe to make it a main meal. We loved it!! I followed the recipe exactly, except added a little cumin. It's definitely a keeper! Thanks!

This recipe is good but uses too much liquid.  Liquid should be cut back to about 1 1/2 parts water to 1 part rice.  Otherwise, your rice is still swimming in liquid when it should be done.

This was great!  I only had the extra hot rotel tomatoes, so it made it with a super kick!  Will definately make again!

Good recipe to start from. Great once perfected. I loved the incorporation of mild green chilis (I used canned smoked mild green chilis). 

I like garlic so I added one minced garlic clove to the onions.
I used vegetable broth in place of water to add flavor and to let it remain vegetarian. I added a dash of cumin, chili, and cayenne powder. I omitted the bell pepper for the lack of! 

Make sure the rice is browned and to stir it to keep it from burning and you'll end up with great spanish rice!

Very tasty! I added black beans and omitted the chile powder (i didn't have any). I used canned tomatoes that had garlic, basil and oregeno in them already. Tasted even better on day two! Next time I will use a little less water though. YUM YUM!

I served this rice with chicken enchiladas last night and it was WONDERFUL!!!  This is so much better than the Spanish rice mixes you buy at the store and even better than what most restaurants serve!  I was out of white rice so I used a bag of yellow Spanish rice.  I also replaced the water with homemade chicken broth, added a little garlic powder, pepper and kept everything else the same.  Thanks for sharing this great recipe!!!

First time I made Spanish rice without a package, and I'm never going back! I used: ~olive oil ~brown rice ~green onions ~jar of salsa (because w had that but would have had to go to the store for tomatoes) ~added garlic in with oil, onions and pepper ~ and used home-mixed taco seasoning instead of chili powder. Rice needed to low-boil for 30 min, not just simmer. Great recipe! Thank you.

I make it with regular brown rice (with normal cooking time of 45 mins) and it's fantastic as well. Just let it cook that extra 15 mins.

Taking this to a potluck later today, so I doubled the recipe.  Used chicken stock instead of water, as I always do, & only 1 can of Ro-tel, it is plenty spicy!  I do hope I have some left to bring home-just don't know how many folks will be there. I did add some cumin & used dried, chopped onions instead of fresh. Did not sauté before cooking in the microwave. I will be making this again.

I took some of the advice of other reviewers and used bacon grease and garlic and this rice turned out beautifully. I've made it twice already in the last month and it is now one of my go-to recipes! Thanks.

This recipe is amazing! Especially with the chicken broth in lieu of water. It's the only way to do it in my opinion. I love this recipe. It doesn't need anything else but since my family loves it, I'll add some chopped cilantro and when I have them, sliced baby carrots. This is an excellent rice to use for arroz con pollo. Just shred some rotisserie chicken and toss it in! It's wonderful!

I am REALLY excited to report that I've found the secret ingredient to making this rice AMAZING! BEEF BROTH. The chicken broth was good, but seemed lacking. One night I had no chicken broth, but plenty of beef broth and tried it and it was AMAZING! Give it a try- you won't be disappointed! 

Some other tips from another reviewer that I followed and was very pleased with: 1)Add a clove or two of minced garlic, 2)Saute the veggies a little before adding the rice, 3)Take the time and brown the rice well, 4) Add a 1/2 tsp of ground cumin, 5) Use broth instead of water. I will have to try using bacon grease instead of oil next time!

We have Mexican food every Christmas Eve and this is the rice.  I double it because it's a favorite leftover. I use veggie broth instead of water & add garlic and cumin and a bit of fresh cilantro or parsley.   When moisture is almost gone, I lower heat VERY low and let it dry out slowly while fluffing and watching carefully so that it dries without burning or being sticky.

I just made this recipe and boy is it good.  I did add 1/2 cayenne and cumin for some added kick and a small can of tomato sauce.  So very good the way it is.  I just like kick and saucey rice.  LOL  Enjoy this one folks.  It really is great.

Very good.  I used Chicken broth and Rotel's diced tomatoes with habaneros, which made it very spicy.  Then followed the directions.  I will make this again next time I make Mexican food again

Good recipe.  I made a couple of changes.

1) replace vegetable oil with olive oil or even butter.  It tastes better and is healthier.
2) Add 1/2 to 1 tsp cayenne pepper.
3) Add 1/2 tsp cumin.  Between this and the cayenne, this has a great taste.
4) Use 1.5 cups chicken stock instead of water, or add 2 chicken boullion cubes.
5) Add a clove or two of finely chopped garlic when sautéing peppers and onions.
6) For chili powder, use chipotle chili powder or some combination of chipotle and regular chili powder.  I change this around a little.

I also use chicken broth instead of water, chopped garlic and I also add oregano and cumin, as did another reviewer.  I double my recipe so I used 2 tablespoons of vegetable oil and 2 tablespoons of butter.  This dish is delicious .

I've made this recipe several times and love it. I use vegetable broth (some people use chicken broth but we are vegetarians!) instead of water, brown rice instead of white. I use whatever bell peppers I have on hand - my favorite is to make it colorful by using red, yellow and green peppers, I added garlic and a touch of cumin.  Love it.

Totally Tex-Mex.  Made exactly as directed - Note to self:  next time, use chicken broth and cut chili powder down by half.  Add cumin.  Dont use liquid from can AND water ... made it too mushy.

Thank you for a recipe that does not include prepared salsa! Like others, I added cumin. If you want to make it more like a main dish, Add some browned hamburger or, better yet, spicy sausage. I think I will try adding chicken next time. Thanks for a great recipe. This will be a staple in my home -- something I can make as is, or a good base for customizing!

To drain or not to drain?  That sure was my question.  I wondered if I should included the juice from the can of tomatoes PLUS 2 cups of water...I did and regret it.  There was far too much liquid which resulted in mushy rice.  And it was very bland as written.  I felt the need to add a LOT of cumin, taco seasoning, oregano as well as 2X chili powder and it still was just a mediocre rice dish.  I may try again using broth instead of water (which I am kicking myself for not doing in the first place).

My husband gives this dish 5 stars with some minor changes.  I used 1 can chicken broth in place of water; added 1 small yellow wax pepper - seeded and chopped fine, and 1/2 red bell pepper.  I cut the chili powder in half , and added 1/2 tsp. ground cumin. Very good!

Excellent!!  I will definitely make this again.  I followed the recipe as it was written except I fried up a pound of lean hamburg in some olive oil first.  Did not use any vegetable oil in the recipe.

I just made this recipe for my friends. I have never made Spanish rice before and it was a big hit. This is good for beginner cooks.

I really love this recipe. I substitute half chicken broth with half water and I also substitute half the chili powder with half cumin to add a little more spice and flavor.

This was simple enough to throw together for a weeknight side dish! I did add a dash of cumin and a clove of garlic! very very tasty!

I've made this recipe several times now in the past 6 months. After the first time I used chicken broth instead of water and it's the easiest, fastest and best tasting I've ever had. It's better than any I've ever had in an expensive restaurant. I also use about a 3/4cup extra of the broth cause we don't like it as dry. You really can't mess this one up. it's awesome.

This is an easy side dish or an easy meal with the addition of a protein. The vegetarians in my family enjoy adding cottage cheese as a topping to this. The meat eaters enjoy seasoned, browned ground beef along with it.

Made this recipe for mother's day! Mom and grandma don't eat onions or garlic, or anything spicy, so I left out the chile, chile powder, and the onion.  For 5 servings, I used just under one cup of white rice, 1 whole green pepper, a 15 ounce can of diced tomatoes, and a whole bushel of asparagus.  I also used olive oil instead of vegetable oil, and i threw the green pepper and the asparagus in there for a few minutes before i put the rice in, just so they can brown a little.  The 1 cup rice to 2 cups water is a perfect ratio, and came out perfectly!  Great recipe.

I've tried several Spanish rice recipes on this site and this is truly the best. I do always use chicken broth instead of plain water. The measurements are just right on this recipe, using long grain rice always. Not too soggy, not too dry. I did use another reviewers suggestion of bacon grease in stead of oil to fry the pepper/onions/rice in and I did add in a chopped jalapeño and minced garlic. A bit of cumin and paprika give more of the Spanish flair to this dish. This is now my to go to recipe for Spanish rice.

This was very good but I could have done with half as much chili powder & I love lots of chili powder in my chili But not so much in this. But, overall, a good recipe. Thank you!

So yummy!  I used just diced tomatoes instead of the kind with chiles (can't take heat) and reduced the chili powder (for the same reason).  Really flavorful and easy - I will definitely make this again!

REALLY good - but way too hot if you use hot Rotel AND the chili powder.  Next time, will use regular Rotel w/ green chiles & the 2 t chili powder.  Also, added a can of sliced new potatoes to the onion & rice when sautéing (mainly b/c my grandmother always cut up a potato to use in her Spanish rice.)  Will be using this as my go-to Spanish rice from now on.

I followed the suggestions by Jodi Lynn (the first review) but added half a teaspoon of turmeric, which gives the rice a lovely yellow colour. Will try adding some saffron threads next time.....

We added the cumin and replaced the water with chicken broth as suggested and it was Wonderful!!  I'll probably halve the chili powder since it was a little spicy for my little ones!

I really liked this recipe, so did the fam. I served this with chimichangas and a salad. I didn't have any minced garlic. So I used garlic power, while the it was sauteing. Only thing diffent was that I did use chicken (herbal)broth in place of the water and I added cumin. Really easy and delicious.

Turned out restaurant style! I had to adjust for what I had on hand, but the measurments are right on! I used a 12oz can diced tomatoes, but also uped the rice to 1 1/2 cups and added a small can of diced gree chilis seperate. Powdered onion, chili, and garlic, and salt seasonings were all I had, but turned out perfect in the end!

I did not add the bell pepper..13 year old's request.  I did add about 1 tsp. of ground cumin.  I used the diced tomatoes and green chilies with lime and cilantro and added a couple of squeezes of fresh lime juice after I placed it in the serving bowl.  Top with a few sprigs of cilantro.  Excellent!  I did use basmati rice for the white rice.  Thanks, John Mac for this delicious recipe!

I have tried several times to make dishes with uncooked white rice and my rice always turns out hard n crunchy even when i follow the recipe exactly but for some reason I finally got it. In this case I did twist the recipe according to other reviewers, but I finally got the rice right! This is what I did: I first sauteed the onions, green peppers and added 2 garlic cloves minced until tender, then i added the rice until lighty brown. I then added 2 cups of chicken broth instead of water, along with 1/4 tsp cumin,no salt, 1/4 tsp garlic powder, and chilli powder as directed, diced canned tom with garlic n onion, 1 can on green chilles. I brought to a boil at medium heat, then covered and reduced heat to low for about 40 minutes and did not remove the cover until the timer went off.  It turned out perfect!!!  I am so happy I can finally make a recipe with white rice that turns out cooked and not crunchy. WOOOHOOOO!!!!!

This recipe was easy and great. I added Garlic and used beef broth instead of water and 1 jalepeno which replaced the green chilies. Very yummy, we had taco night, so the next day's lunch I mixed some of the meat mixture. OH MAN!!!

I added some ground beef, (about 1 lb.) along with the 6 suggested ingredients from another user. It turned a very tasty side dish into a main dish. Add a side salad and you have a complete meal.

GREAT recipe!!  For some reason I can NEVER get rice to have the right consitancy, but with this recipe, I finally got it!!  Used red bell pepper instead of green, and I used 1 can chicken broth + water to equal 2 cups (I think it came to about 1/4 c water) but other than that followed the recipe to the T...love it!!  I've been looking for a Spanish Rice recipe for SOO long and this is it!!  No more Lipton's Spanish Rice for this girl!  Thanx Dave!

My family loved this one.  The next week I made it for a potluck at my office, and a double batch got gobbled up and several people asked for the recipe.  Very good and quite easy.

This is a great and easy recipe that does not take a lot of time. I pretty much followed the recipe as is but I did add a little more seasoning to kick it up a notch and I added chicken. Great recipe!

I've made this several times, and I love it! I used chicken broth in place of water, and only half an onion. I added some red and yellow bell peppers as well. It is so very good, and easy to make. Sauteeing the rice with the vegetables makes a significant difference, it gets sticky otherwise. Definitely a keeper.

Sorry, this recipe just didn't work for me.  It ended up coming out soggy and mushy.  There was just way too much liquid.  Maybe I'm not using the right type of rice?  It just says white rice and the one I used must not have been the right kind.  The flavors seemed fine but I'm not sure if I'll try this recipe again.

it was okay.  I used medium grain rice nd that did not work out.  plus, it needed a little more flavoring. not used to making rice on the stove, prefer using a rice cooker.

This recipe is good, easy to prepare, and yields consistent results -- I have made this twice. The consistency is a little chewier than I care for, so perhaps I'll reduce the water a bit. Also, I don't seem to get much flavor from the chilis as written: in a can of diced tomatoes and chilis. I might prefer to saute diced fresh chilis with the onions and green pepper, though that adds another step. Also, 1 tsp of salt wasn't enough to bring out the flavors, so if it seems a little bland, try adding more.

Super yummy! I've never tried making my own spanish rice before - but this was simple and delicious.

I actually simplified this recipe even more by using a rice cooker. I omitted the fresh onion and instead used 1 TBSP onion flakes. I also substituted the green bell pepper, can diced tomatoes, and green chiles for 1 (7 oz) can of casera. Last, I substituted the 2 cups water for 2 cups chicken stock.

No more boxed Spanish rice ever again! Great recipe, and I tweaked it just a little bit.

Used Jasmine rice; olive oil instead of vegetable oil; added 2 tsp. chicken bullion to the water; used canned tomatoes without the chiles; added some chopped jalapenos, and used taco seasoning instead of chili powder.

Excellent!

Easy and very tasty. I don't usually post changes to a recipe, as I like to make them as the owner intended. 
However, if you double this recipe using the online tool, you do not need to use 1/4 cup oil to brown the rice and onions. I cut it back significantly.

A little spicier than expected, I enjoyed, but my kids didn't like it as much. Next time I will use regular diced tomatoes and less chili powder.

Made exactly according to recipe.   It was fine, nothing wrong with it and the whole bowl was finished at the dinner party I was hosting.  But there was nothing special about it either, no one raved about how good it was.  Honestly think it would've been tastier to buy some pre-made Spanish rice.

Great starting point, I added cooked chicken chunks, chicken broth, tomato sauce, red and green diced chiles, black olives and corn. Served with sour cream, salsa, and chips. Made for a great quick meal.

As written its 3 star rice. Use chicken broth and a little tomato sauce or ketchup and this rice is 5 star.

This is so much better than the Spanish rice you get at most restaurants!  Used brown rice (I'm on a health kick) and we don't eat bell peppers, so I left it out.  I used a can of petite diced tomatoes and a tablespoon of canned green chiles because that's all I had.  Finally I added two teaspoons of ground cumin.  It turned out perfectly.  John, thanks for the recipe; I've been looking for something like this for a long time.

quadrupled this recipe tonight as aside dish to chicken enchiladas.  made a few changes:  had only 2 cans of rotel, so i subbed 16oz of salsa for the remaining tomatoes called for.  i increased the chicken broth pretty substantially - i think because i was making so much and the pot was so full, it just needed a lot more liquid (probably added an additional 4c of broth).  personally i thought it was a little heavy on the chili powder, but everyone else i served it to seemed to really enjoy it.  thiswas my first time making homemade spanish rice, and it was very easy and tasted great - thanks!

Great recipe! I doubled it and it fed 8 of us with a bit leftover; I had a lot of other food that's probably why there was any left because everyone loved it. I used a little less chili powder and it was perfect for our tastes. I also used half of a green pepper and half red. The rice was a bit mushy to me, it didn't affect the taste of course but I may add a smaller amount of liquid next time. Excellent!

Love this recipe. Very easy to make and tastes wonderful. I also use chicken or veggie broth instead of water and decrease the amount of liquid used as I like a fluffier, drier rice. I also add cumin because I love the taste. I don't use onions in my recipes but did add in some minced garlic for added flavor.

This rice is the bomb! I have tried other Spanish rice recipes, but none have been this good. I would recommend this rice to anyone. I followed the recipe exactly, and it came out perfectly. I wouldn't change a thing. All I can say is YUM!

Not bad, was expecting a bigger wow factor.  Only think I didn't like was the green pepper was too soft.  Like a little bit more crisp texture.  The flavor was nice.  May add more chili powder next time to give it more oomph.

I followed many helpful suggestions but there was a layer of burnt rice on the bottom. I probably shouldnt have tripled the recipe in the same pot because the rice cooked unevenly.  I added garlic,onion, vegetable broth and i used chopped fresh cilantro.great flavor!

Pretty good; I did have to cook this longer because it took forever. I added more chili powder, and a couple of cloves of garlic and some cominos. GREAT in a flour tortilla with taco meat!

Oh my! Delicious!  Used chicken broth instead of water, extra chili powder and no additional salt.  I sauteed the onion, garlic and bell pepper for awhile before browning the rice and then put it in my rice cooker along with the rest of the ingredients.  Went great and looked great next to my crab enchilada's.  Bonus points for making an impression on the man in my life!

I do NOT like Spanish rice but this recipe was great.  I cooked it with brown rice (to be healthier) and it took 5 times the liquid and 3 times the cooking length.  I also used chicken broth instead of water to give it more flavor.  Definitely worth making.

I liked this recipe but my hubby wouldn't touch it (because he saw the giant pile of onions during prep, grr!). 20 minutes of cook time would have been just right - I went 25 and it was kind of mushy. I also substituted about a 1/4 cup of diced "nacho" jalapenos in place of the green chilies since I only had plain diced tomatoes.

We had some friends over for dinner and they LOVED this rice.  I used brown rice (personal preference) and as some others suggested, I substituted chicken broth for the water.  Thanks for sharing such an easy and great recipe.

This is super yummy! We make blackened chicken strips to go with it. After the rice is finished, the rice is a bit sticky, but it looks like any spanish rice I've ever eaten anyway, so I didn't pay it no mind. I've made this about 5 times and will make it at least that many more times. Thanks!

This was so tasty!  I doubled the sauce and marinated the chicken in some of the sauce (before I cooked it and thickened it).  I also grilled the chicken.  It was very good and I'll make it again!

This was a fantastic recipe, even though I had my doubts. I'm the type of person who always fails at cooking rice on the stove so...I decided to put everything into the rice pot.  It worked brilliantly! I sauteed the onions and peppers in evoo before chucking them into the pot and I went a little shy on the chili powder. I think a pinch of cumin would have added a nice touch, too.  When serving I squeezed some lime juice on it. Delicious ; )

Good rice but nothing special. Lots of tomato flavor, perhaps a bit too overpowering. Will make again but might cut back on amount of tomatoes used.

I substituted olive oil, brown rice, very low sodium organic chicken broth, and roasted red bell pepper in this recipe. Because I used instant brown rice, I should have cut the broth and the cooking time down. I added in some frozen corn at the end. This was really good w/ our whole wheat taco salad.

Excellent, I sauted garlic with the onion and added a chunky olive tapenade to the rice, also replaced the tomatoes with cut up cherry tomatoes and used chicken both and water for the liquid ... it was great, we all loved it.

When my 3 year old requested rice with our tacos I came searching & found this recipe. It was incredible! I used chicken broth instead of water which definitely added flavor. The kids gobbled it up which convinced me that this is a keeper!

I loved this recipe! Very easy to make and tastes soooo good. Even my husband, who considers himself a rice connisseur, said this was the best rice he has ever had. I will be making this A LOT. Thanks!

I've made this recipe twice.  The first time, I added garlic and cumin and used chicken broth in place of the water.  The second time, I made it for a vegetarian/vegan, so I had to replace the chicken broth in my original modifications with vegetable broth.  Worked well both times.

This is a good recipe.  I used some chicken broth in place of water, added cumin and garlic powder.  I doubled the recipe and it turned out fine.

This is the best and easiest Spanish rice recipe that I have ever made.  It is excellent.  My family loves is so much that I make it as least twice a month.  It is has become part of our traditional Sunday meals.  I also subsituted 1 cup of water for 1 cup of chicken broth.  I this this recipe is great.  Thank you Dave.

Try this with shrimp in it!  My whole family thought it was wonderful!  I modified this a little so the kids could eat it, decreasing chile powder to 1 tsp, using 1 C vegetable broth and 1 C water, and decreasing salt to 1/2 tsp.  I added 1/2 lb bay shrimp during the last 5-10 minutes of cooking, and it made an excellent main dish.  Our family needs a triple batch!

This was so good. My family really enjoyed this one. I used Chicken Broth instead of water, 1 tsp. chili powder (I have toddlers) and instant rice and no bell pepper (didn't have any). No more boxed rice for us.

This is pretty darn good. I wasn't sure how much chili powder to put in since it just says to add it "to taste," but I think I ended up using about 1 1/2 T., which seemed to be just about right...a nice "afterburn" as my boyfriend called it. I used a red bell pepper instead of green and I added a can of regular RoTel instead of plain tomatoes. I also added a clove of garlic. Very tasty.

I made this exactly as written for a Tex-Mex dinner party, with the exception of using chicken broth in place of water.  My husband, the Taster-In-Chief, always makes suggestions after he samples a new dish. This is one of the rare occasions that he didn't.  He tried it and declared it to be perfect.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.

Made this for my carb loving husband with a Mexican themed dinner. I subbed chicken broth for the water, and only had a can each of chiles and diced tomatoes rather than Rotel. Great flavor, but keep an eye on the clock. Mine went over time by a minute or two and was a little soft. My own fault, and I'll still make it again and not get distracted. Thanks for sharing.

Use this recipe all the time. Like others, I added 1/2 tsp. cumin and used chicken broth instead of water.  Great side with enchiladas.

Turned out great. However I did make a couple of small changes. I left out the bell peppers, Instead of using canned diced tomato and green chiles, I used a can of chiles and diced two tomatoes myself (cuts down on the salt a bit). Lastly, I added 1/2 tsp of ground cumin.

Delicious. I don't even like Spanish rice, but this was amazing. Made with chicken broth, as others suggested, and topped it with a little cheddar when served.

It was a little bland for my taste. I messed up and accidentally put 2 tablespoons of chili powder instead of teaspoons. It still as not that spicy at all. Maybe with some extra ingredients this recipe can be a little more exciting. It is certainly easy to make.

I found this recipe very tasty. I had my friends over, and we used this in tacos. We made a few minor adjustments, since we didn't have all the ingredients, but it still came out delicious!
Thank you!

I made this recipe, but accidentally doubled the rice. I think it would have had better flavor if I had only add 1c of uncooked rice. I sautéed 1/2c onion, 1T minced garlic, and 3 slices of chopped bacon (omitted bell pepper since I had none). Then I added rice and stirred until slightly brown. Next I added a 1/4c chopped cilantro, 1/2c diced fresh tomato (substitute for canned) 2t tomato paste (with 1 cup of rice I would have used 1t), 1t. each of garlic power, onion powder, 1/2t cumin, 1T taco seasoning, sprinkle of Adobe seasoning. If I had chicken stock I would have used that, but I only had water--and the result was rice that was less salty and flavorful. I dont know if other users have experienced this, but when I start to add onion, tomatos, cilantro, I need less water to cook rice. For 2c of uncooked rice I used 3c of water. Brought rice and water to a boil, then turned down to a simmer and cooked covered for 30 min with out stirring.

We enjoyed this, though I cooked my triple recipe too long, and it was still too wet. Next time I will use the rice cooker, and add liquid to the rice cooker measurements.

I add a couple things, such as jalapenos or chilis, depending what I have on hand. I like a little spice. A little chili pepper of one's own choice goes a long way as well. Delicious recipe.

Awesome!  This is good stuff.  A bit spicy for my family, so next time I make it - and I will make it again - I will adjust the spice level.

This was my first attempt at making Spanish Rice and it came out very good. I used some of Jodie Lynn's suggestions and used chicken broth and added  two cloves of garlic. I also used a whole bell pepper and instead of diced tomatoes with green chiles I used Ro-tel diced tomatoes with lime juice & cilantro. I also added a heaping teaspoon of cumin because I love the spice. I will be making this again.

Very good and fairly authentic tasting. I do not think the spices are exactly right, but do not know what to change thus the four stars.

I will be the first to admit that I am not a big fan of spanish rice...something about tomatoes & rice are not that appealing to me.  But....this was good.  I used chicken stock in place of the water, omitted the bell pepper, and added 1 tsp of cumin and 1 T of chopped garlic.  I'm not sure that browning the rice adds anything to the dish - next time I'll try it w/o browning it.  Made this w/ the Chicken Enchilada Casserole from this site - it was a HUGE hit.  Thanks.

Sorry but I followed this recipe to a T other than adding a chopped jalapeno and I did not care for it. Tasted Bland to me. Seriously I've tried School Cafeteria Spanish rice that taste better than this stuff.

Great Spanish rice recipe.  I used a yellow bell instead of green because it suits my daughter's 7-year old taste buds slightly better.  I burned the bottom of the rice, so next time I'll turn down the fire.  Overall great recipe and I can't wait to try again and put my personal variations in it!  Thanks!

I made this but used chicken broth instead of water and a can of Rotel.  I think 2 cups is too much liquid for the amount of rice.  It came out too watery.  Next time, I will only use 1 cup of liquid per each cup of rice.

this rice is SO yummy.  it's perfect with the enchilada suizas by LADYGWYN on this site!

the major change i make is to put the rotel in my mini food processor (blender would be fine) and pulse it until it's no longer chunky.  it's much smoother this way...plus, my toddlers like it better without the "yucky stuff" chunks. ;)

i, also, use chicken broth in place of the water, and i don't use  the bell pepper.

i also add in a heaping ts of garlic powder.

YUM!!!

Every bit as good as the rice you get in a Mexican restaurant. I used my own peppers and tomatoes from my garden, which added a nice touch, I think. Yummy!!

This is an Excellent side dish to Spanish chicken, thanks!  What I tried to appease my onion/grn pepper fearing 17 yo son, is to add several sprigs of freshly chipped cilantro & a can of black beans(rinsed & drained) & corn from 2 freshly steamed ears(you can prob. substitute a bag of frozen/steamed if not in season).  Also added a couple extra tsp's of chili powder, & it turned out Great!  Son even went back for Seconds/thirds knowing about the onions/grn peppers!

This is how my Mom made it--only without the chili seasoning.  Actually, Spanish rice is quite bland.  Back 50 years, spicy foods were not "in".  So season to taste.

This was a great Spanish Rice. I made it tonight for dinner as a side dish to Enchiladas Suizas. It was nice and easy to make and very flavorfull. I think that the next time I make it I'm going to add a couple of pinches of cinnamon.

Good recipe but I added extras.  I minced 3 gloves of garlic and threw that in with the onions when browning the rice.  I tried this recipe a few times and burnt the rice!!!!!!!  I finally turned down my burner to low low low and let the rice simmer and everything worked out fine.  Added 1/2 teaspoon of cumin to the mix and cut the salt down a bit.  The flavor turned out lovely.

This is a very simple and delicious recipe. I used one can of chicken broth and enough water to make two cups.  Better if made ahead and reheat in the microwave when serving.

I made this rice twice. The first time I followed the recipe as written and it was good. The next time I made it (last night), I took from other reviewers suggestions, and it was fantastic! Only minor changes, but that's really all that is needed for me. First I used chicken stock in place of the water and I added 4 Trappey's yellow tabasco peppers, chopped. I always use short grain rice, so I had to adjust the amount of chicken stock. All in all, this is a great recipe, whether as written or with a few tweeks!

Like other reviewers recommended, I browned the rice and added cumin. I ended up substituting beef broth for the water, and substituted salsa for the cans of diced tomatoes and green chiles (of which I didn't have on hand). We topped our rice with shredded cheddar cheese and sliced green onions. Delicious! Thanks for sharing! Will definitely be making this more often!

Other than using chicken broth instead of water, we followed this recipe exactly --- It is excellent, and the leftovers are great, too.  The 30 minutes turned out perfect for the covered cooking time.  We serve it with a Mexican chicken salad for a light, healthy meal.

This rice was very good. I've never had authentic Spanish rice so I can't rate it on that. However, it was still very tasty. I did a few things differently. I cooked my rice separately then folded it into the onions, peppers, and tomatoes. I also added some cumin just because I thought it needed it and stirred in some chicken broth for extra flavor. I will definitely make this again..very yummy.

I fixed this because i wanted something quick and easy for dinner at an incredibly low price, well, this nailed that mark... It not only was super delicious but it also cost close to nothing and didn't require more than cutting up an onion!  Good stuff!

A very delicious restaurant style spanish rice. Based on the reviews I added 1tsp of cumin and reduced the chili powder to 1tsp. Thank you for the great recipe :-)

Mmm, very good!  I served this alongside Quick and Easy Mexican Chicken, also found on AllRecipes.  Topped both with fresh cilantro and a bit of sour cream on the side.  Yellow corn makes a great side also, the sweetness really compliments the spicy rice.  Thanks for the tasty and easy recipe!

Very pleased. I changed it up a bit just for personal preference. I used broth in place of water. I added a can of pinto beans to the rice for added protein.I just cooked with the rest of it, and used brown rice, because it's healthier. I also added two packets of sazon, which I think made the entire dish taste amazing! Added Parmesan cheese after cooking. My little picky eaters loved it, I loved it for two days after, too. VERY good. Will make again.

Great recipe! I doubled the recipe, except I didn't double the onion and I didn't use vegetable oil or bacon grease; I used olive oil. I used white and green onions, added 1 tsp Cumin, 1 tbsp of Pampered Chef's Southwest Seasoning (I was out of Chili powder), 1 clove of garlic - crushed, I also  used plain diced tomatoes (that was what I had in the pantry), and used red/green/yellow/orange bell peppers (had parts of each in the fridge). Made this in my rice cooker (it has a saute then simmer setting)....Delicious! Even my daughter that really dislikes rice loved this! Thank you for a great recipe!

I've made this twice.  First.. as written, and it was okay, but not outstanding.  Then I made it with the alterations described by Jodi Lynn.  Bacon grease instead of veggie oil, garlic sauteed with the peppers/onions (all sauteed until tender BEFORE adding the rice to brown), using chicken broth rather than water, and adding a bit of cumin.  (I did not add parsley, though.)  It was FANTASTIC.  Everyone loved it.

Delish!! I actually put all the ingredients in my bread machine/rice maker and it always turns out perfectly! I love the machine because after it is done (about 40 mins) it keeps it warm for an hour! This recipe is sooooo good!!!

I would have given it 5 stars but I made some changes.  I used chicken broth instead of water and added some cumin, just a couple small shakes.  Next time I will use tomato sauce instead of tomatoes with green chilies.  Just a personal taste....I don't like tomato chunks at all.  It was spicy with a kick but nothing over bearing.  Just the right amount for us.  Oh and I used brown rice instead of white.  It did take longer to cook but other than that there was NO need to adjust the liquid ratio.  Good basic recipe, feel free to play around with it.

This was very easy and taste great!  I made only a few modifications. I used green chilies, added cumin, red bell pepper along with some green and added more chili powder.  I also used chicken broth instead of water. My husband said it was perfect!

Very bland dish.  First off, you need cumin powder in addition to chili powder (or no chili powder at all since there are chilies already in there).  Second, you need more salt in this recipe.  The rice soaked a lot of it up, had to add more while eating.  I was quite disappointed in the flavor.  I'll stick to my own recipe next time....sorry there John Mac.  This one flopped.

Fabulous!!  I have to admit, I looked up Pioneer Woman's recipe and it was almost exactly the same except she had cumin, so I added about 1/2-1 teaspoon...delicious!  I also used brown rice instead of white.  Other than a longer cooking time, it turned out amazing!  The best Spanish Rice recipe!!

EXCELLENT!!! I made this rice with some of the suggestions given. I used bacon grease instead of veg. oil, I added minced garlic to the onions and greeen peper, added 1/8 tsp cumin, reduced the chili powder to 1 tsp, used chicken broth instead of water and used 2 cups of minute rice instead of long grain rice. Our family LOVES this and using the minute rice sped up the cooking time.

Super easy and delicious. Went great with our chile pork verde

I keep making this! It's GREAT! I now like to add chicken seasoning, cumin, shallots, lime juice, parsley, and saffron while it's cooking! Really bumps it up.

As other reviewers suggested, I used Chicken broth instead of water & added in a touch of Cumin.  I also used Bacon, and then used the drippings to cook the onions, pepper (added garlic) and to brown the rice in. I used Brown Rice, and it was very good. I think next time I might add in a little tabasco for a little extra kick!  Thank you for the easy wonderful recipe!

Definitely use the chicken broth or stock instead of water.  Good idea to play with and tweak.  Needs more spices (not more heat spices, though). Maybe try Pimenton, the Spanish smoked paprika.  Definitely add some comino/cumin.

Yum.  It turned out great.  The only thing I did differently was to saute the peppers and onions before adding the rice.

I love this rice!  I was looking for something to go with the Slow Cooker Carnitas recipe from this website and decided to try this out.  Definitely replace the water with chicken or beef stock, or better yet, if you make the carnitas, you will be left with several cups of juices in the crock pot which you can utilize to make this rice.  It was just over the top good when I did this.  I poured the juices into a bowl and let it rest so that it seperated.  I then skimmed the fat off the top reserving 2 T (to use in place of the oil) and poured it all through a strainer to remove the solids.  Use the remaining juices to replace all the water.  YUM!  Thanks so much for this recipe.  Browning the rice is a great touch.

Great basic recipe. I never have fresh bell peppers on hand, so I omitted those and the diced tomatoes/green chiles. I used a can of tomato sauce instead. It went well with my enchiladas.

This was so quick to get together and had great flavor.  SOOOO much better than a box mix!  The only thing I will do different next time is use chicken broth instead of water for that extra flavor I think the rice needed.

The flavor in this recipe is very good, but the rice turned out mushy and overcooked. Perhaps the cooking time is too long for someone cooking at sea level? I've had success with Mexican Rice II from this site (shorter cooking time and less liquid) so I'll probably stick with it in the future.

I used chicken broth to give some extra flavor to the rice. This is really good. Not a green pepper fan, but put some in along with some white and red that I had roasted previously. Was really spicy for me but the family loved it. Thanks!

i have been making a spanish rice recipe from this site and liked it.  i thought to do some more searching and am soooo glad i did.   this one has better flavor and is super easy.  i sauted my onions, garlic, and rice in butter and evoo.  i didnt add the green pepper (hubby dont like them) did chicken broth instead of water and added 1 t. of cumin.  my tomatoes were mexican tomatoes and worked great.  add some parsley flakes at the end.  we all thought it was amazing.  the best we have ever had.  i dont like the rice at mexi restur.  its always dry and tasteless.  this recipe is packed with soooo much flavor and is super easy to make !! we topped ours with sourcream yummy.   thanks for sharing.

Easy to make; need to watch it more closely next time because it got a little scorch-y. I added chopped fresh jalapeno.

I made some changes.  I used 2 cups of rice (cooked separate) instead of one.    I also had fresh tomatoes instead of canned.  I blanched and diced them and put everything else together and cooked much of the liquid off.  I did not use chili powder...I added chili oil (about 4-6 shakes) and garlic (2 cloves - pressed) to 2 steaks (1 1/2 lbs) fat trimmed and cubed put in a hot stirfry pan.  Once everything was done, I combined it all and served it with chedder cheese and sour cream.  Total hit!

Excellent and super easy!  Changes: instead of water I added half chicken broth and half tomato sauce.  Used both green and red bell pepper.  Also added corn.  Did not need to add any salt.  Tasty the first day you make it and just as good as leftovers days after.

This was delicious and most importantly, easy. I substituted brown rice and cooked the rice according to brown rice instructions. I'm watching my sodium so I didn't add the salt but the can of diced tomatoes and chili had more than enough sodium so I didn't miss the added salt. I added cumin, cilantro and doubled the chili. This is definitely a keeper!! Thanks much!!

I made this rice for my family the other day and let me tell you the flavor in this rice is awesome.  It fills the whole house while it cooks.  I didn't have any of the green chilies but I did use the cumin and some crushed red pepper flakes for some spice and everything worked out well thanks to Shanny and the others for their advice for making this # 1 in our house.

Living in AZ, I'm picky about my rice. This recipe is a keeper! I did substitute the chicken broth for the water, and add 1/2 tsp cumin.  If you like hot Mexican food, then you may want to add some jalepeno. If you aren't into spicy food, then you should cut back on the spices a bit. Personally, I thought that it was a good balance as-is!

We made this for a potluck, tripled the receipe and it turned out GREAT.  Cut down on the chili powder, added cumin and about a teaspoon of chicken boullion to the water.  My husband who doesn't like ANYTHING said it was delicious.  Wow, that's high praise.   I'm going to use brown rice next time just because I like it better. Thank you for this recipe!

Wonderful recipe.  As others suggested I used chicken broth rather than water.  Also reduced the chili powder to about 1 teaspoon.  Served with Beef Enciladas I from this site and got raves from my company.  Also served refried beans, sliced avocados, tortilla chips with salsa and sour cream.  Really fabulous plate of food!

This turned out great when I used some reviewers' suggestions. I used chicken broth instead of water, and I sauted the veggies first (along with some garlic), then added the rice. I also cut the chili powder in half, and added 1/2 tsp cumin. It turned out just spicy enough for us without being too hot.

Great recipe; I have made this twice in the past two weeks.  Like many of the previous reviewers suggested, I made some modifications to this recipe.  I first sauteed the green peppers and onions separately, set them aside, and then sauteed the rice.  It does take about 10 minutes for the rice to get golden brown though.  Then I added the veggies back in, added a can of black beans, used chicken stock instead of water, only a heaping tbsp of chili powder and added a sprinkle of cumin.  The first batch of rice I made stuck to the bottom of the pan so I suggest stirring the rice a couple of times during the process.  I like to add a little cheddar cheese on top before serving.

I have used this recipe a couple of times now.  I use only 1/4 onion.  I have tried it with water, as the recipe suggests, and with chicken broth.  Both are exceptional.  This is delicious.  I served it with the Cottage Cheese Chicken Enchiladas recipe also on this site.  It is also delcious.

This rice is excellent. I've never made spanish rice before and have always bought it premade to go along with the fajitas/enchiladas I make. I was sick of wasting so much money on the premade stuff so I decided to try to make it myself. I am so glad I did! I took the advice of many others and used chicken broth instead of water, and added 1/2 tsp of cumin. I also added a bit of freshly minced garlic and a bit of cayenne pepper. I then sauteed the onions alone at first so they would be cooked thoroughly. Make sure you brown the rice well. I ended up using about 1.75 cans of chicken broth so make sure you buy 2. I added just one can to begin with and checked the rice every 10 minutes or so, adding more broth when necessary. It took approximately 22 minutes for mine to be done. My husband loved this so I will be keeping this recipe. Thank you!

Texture and flavor were pretty good.  VERY easy.  Normally we like spicy, but I only added 1 teaspoon of chili powder and it was borderline too hot... 2 teaspoons would've made it inedible.  Next time I'll probably reduce it even more and add some cumin and other spices to round out the favor a bit.

I took another reviewer's advice and substituted the water for chicken broth, and added a few mixed beans, but other than that, I followed this recipe as given. It went well with the Quick and Easy Mexican Chicken recipe, and I would certainly make it again, but with the addition of a few extra spices as the original recipe needs a little extra zing (personal preference). Thank you for sharing!

I'd probably give this recipe, as is, a 3.5. It needs quite a few alterations, such a cumin (!!) and broth instead of water. I also agree with the people who rated this saying there were too many tomatoes. I use less than half a 10 oz can and that's plenty. Following the recipe exactly will produce rice that's too tomatoey and quite bland!

Great basic recipe!  Terrific as is, or as a starter for all kinds of little tweaks.  Reviews by others are extremely helpful. I used basmati rice, rinsed well to remove starch, browned it in olive oil, used chicken broth instead of water, Rotel tomatoes, minced garlic. Have once tried putting in some black beans toward the end of cooking. It's great to have something different to serve with enchiladas, or with many other wonderful S.Western/Mexican recipes on this site.

this is the best Spanish rice I've ever made ... I've tried a lot of the Spanish and Mexican rice recipes from this site, but this one is the clear winner.  I followed a few of the other reviews suggestions and made sure to brown the rice, added 3 cloves of minced garlic and also used chicken broth in place of the water.  The result was outstanding!  Served with a sprinkle of cheese and a dollop of sour cream, it was the prefect compliment to our Mexican dinner ... will be making this again and throwing out the old recipes ... thanks for a winner!

I used to buy the boxed mix. This recipe blows the mix out of the water.  I've made this several times and add garlic and sliced black olives, if we have them.

Tasted great. Definitely better than the dry packaged stuff. I also added corn in mine.

An absolutely great rice recipe!  I've tried other Spanish rice recipes but was always disappointed.  I did as others suggested and added a little minced garlic and cumin when I sauted the onion and peppers and used half chicken broth and half water.  I've made this in the quantity written and also for a crowd of 100, and it was a hit both times.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I have made this before, decided to try using chopped celery as well in w/the onions and green pepper...it really "kicked it up a notch!" Please try it w/celery as it is MUCH better this way.

I don't add the rice until I am adding the tomatoes and use broth instead of water, also I use bacon grease, not oil and add black pepper as well.

This is also great as an Entree if you add homemade meatballs that have been fried in the bacon grease, removed, vegetables fried in the bacon grease and then readd the meatballs....continue as directed...

I was looking for a recipe similar to the Spanish Rice my dad used to make. This is very close. I had a garden full of tomatoes so I used 8 smallish tomatoes (with juice) and 1 red jalapeno (minced) and 3 green peppers. I decreased the salt to 1/2 teaspoon and added 1/2 teaspoon cumin and used broth instead of water. I also had to cook it about 10 minutes longer for the rice to be done (although I forgot to saute it with the onions). Yum! Thanks!

This is a great recipe. I replaced the water with veg broth. I also roasted fresh corn and added it to the rice at the very end along with some fresh cilantro. Everyone loved it. I will definitely be making this again!

I scaled this recipe to 100 servings and the computer calculations were fine.  Do not drain the diced tomatoes.  I also substituted chicken broth for the water.  Everybody at the party of 200 loved it.

Very nice, only alterations were that I omitted chili powder, used chili flakes.  I love garlic, so I had to use 3-4 cloves of it minced while sautee'ing the onions in it.  I omitted bell peppers, taste preference.  I used 1 cup water 1 cup chicken broth.  Excellent taste.

This turned out okay for me.  I doubled the recipe and had some touble with the amount of liquid.  The rice was firm still so I had to add more liquid.  It ended up being a little mushy.  I think I may have stirred too much and released the steam when i took the top off.  I took the advice of reviewers and the rice had some nice colors to it.   I probably will not make this again although it is my fault that it did not turn out well.

To take this to the next level, saute some bacon in the oil, crumble and cook the onion/pepper mix in the bacon grease.  Definitely needs garlic and a little cumin.  REALLY good!!

Excellent Spanish rice recipe. Every time I've had Spanish rice at a restaurant, it's been disappointingly bland- more like white rice with orange food coloring or something. This is definitely not the case with this recipe. Definitely cook the rice in chicken broth instead of water. Absolutely delicious!

This was delicious! I made a few alterations in line with some of the other reviews. 

Stock instead of water is a must! I used vegetable as that's all I had on hand but in the future I'll substitute chicken stock. I also added red chillies and a lot more chilli powder. It came out very spicy and just to my tastes!

It came out a little dry, but I stirred in a bit of sour cream right at the end and it tasted perfect. 

Thanks for the recipe! I'll be using it again.

This was the best! So moist and flavorful! I did a few things differently though: I used water and added chicken bouillon because I was out of broth (like users suggested using). I also omitted the chili powder since kids were eating the dish too and added a small can of diced green chilis. I made a triple batch for a mexican themed dinner we were having with friends and every last bite was gone!

Very easy to make and good!  The spanish rice mixes you can buy in the store have so much sodium, so this is way healthier.  And it was easy to make.  I did use chicken broth instead of water as others have suggested and thought it was very tasty.

Very good. I was pleasantly surprised. Especially because how easy it is. The alternations I made and suggest are: Substitute chicken broth for water, add chopped up jalenpeno peppers (i got the ones that come in a jar..they are extra tangy) with onions and green pepper, add 1/2 can of tomatoe sauce with the broth. It turned out a little soggy but very good!

This sounds great. We're going to have veggie quesadillas this weekend, and this rice would be the perfect side dish. Also, I'm glad to see this uses regular rice instead of instant--much better taste.

YUMMY!  A friend of mine showed me her recipe like this long ago and I had forgotten it.  Much better than the boxed stuff.  I didn't have a can of tomatoes & green chilies, so I used a 1/2 of a small can of green chilies, 4 oz of tomato sauce, and one large fresh chopped tomato... it came out delicious!

The best spanish rice recipe I've found. I used Cumin in place of half of the chili powder and used long grain Basmati rice, but a great recipe that didn't turn out bitter or too bland.

Awesome taste. 10 oz can of tomatoes and chilies is "Rotel" - look for it with the canned tomatoes. That is what makes the recipe so great and moist. Just as easy as preparing a boxed mix but so much better. I added a little salt to mine at the table but that was all that was required. Adding cumin would be good but would change the flavor quite a bit too.  Stick with this recipe as written and you can't go wrong.

My family loved it.
I did substitute chix broth for water, a yellow pepper for the green pepper (Hubby hates green peppers), I didn't have diced tomatos with chilis, so I added 1/2 tsp cayenne pepper.  I also used brown rice instead of white and olive oil instead of vegetable.  Definitely will be making this again.
Oh!  This makes a lot!  I doubled it and there was at least half of what I had made left.  Great for leftovers... Hubby put it in a whole wheat taco shell and enjoyed it that way too.

Wayyyy too much liquid, was not fluffy at all, just a big pile of mush. Why anyone would enjoy the texture of mushy rice is beyond me.. seriously cut out at least 3/4c water... the veggies already have liquid in them.. just look how mushy the rice looks in the pictures posted. To each is own.

This was very tasty and easy to make! My husband and I loved it. I added about 1/2 cup of very spicy salsa along w/ the diced tomatoes to really give it a kick. Great recipe!

I love it when others have Spanish rice recipes...but they miss one thing or two...first, fry the rice until light light brown...then add the onions and bell pepper...cook until golden brown...add the seasonings; cumin, salt and pepper...and fill skillet with enought to cover rice a few inches over the rice...add a few drops of tomato sauce (just to color) instead of the whole tomatoes. DO not cover the skillet. As the water evaporates, add more water to the level of the rice...lower the heat from medium high to simmer and cover the skillet. when the steam no longer comes out of the lid...rice is done.

Very good recipe. I did substitute olive oil for the vegetable oil and brown rice for the white rice. Skipped the green pepper, added freash garlic, cumin, and a couple teaspoons of cumin. Also, had to cook longer because of the brown rice. Will definately make again!!

TRES FABU! This was the most amazing spanish rice I've ever had! I defintely suggest using chicken broth in place of water, and in place of the chili powder, use some "Taco Seasoning I" off this website! I'm telling you, this was really good! I used red and yellow peppers because it's all I had. Frying the uncooked rice seemed a bit unusual, but it did finally brown. My batch didn't take but 15 minutes to simmer before it was ready. A pleasant side dish I'll make often! Excellent post!

I love how moist and delish this turned out! I used  chicken broth instead of water, took out the bell peppers, used fresh tomatos, and used canned green chilis to compromise for what I had on hand.

Really tastey rice. As suggested by some, I decreased the chili powder by half and added alittle bit of cumin. I used mild rotel. In my opinion (I can't handle a lot of spice), it still had quite a zing but I didn't have to immediately take a drink after each bite. The rice had really nice flavor. I used 1/2 chicken broth, 1/2 water. I decreased the water some, but I wish I had decreased it more. The rice was a little too liquid, and that was even after additional cooking. Good recipe. Next time I might add some chicken and make it a main dish instead of a side dish.

Good recipe, although I followed the advice of another reviewer and put more chili powder in it.  It was really spicy, but still good.

My family likes Spanish rice so we tried this for a meatless dinner last night. We all enjoyed it and I look forward to serving it again. I did substitute beef boullion for the salt for a little added flavor.

Subbed ckn broth for the water, but I'm wondering if I should have. It got a little too salty so I had to do the 'boil the potato' thing to help out. Make sure to use low-sodium broth. Also, I had to suck out a good bit of liquid because it wasn't all absorbed. Added some diced chiles, cumin, crushed red pepper, and some extra chili powder to give it more flavor. Made a lot more rice than my husband & I could eat. If I make this again, I'm cutting the recipe in half.

Pretty yummy, but a bit too spicy for our family. I'd make it again, but I'd make is less spicy. I made this for another family, and they loved it, but they like more spicy food than we do.

Fantastic rice! I did vary a few things based on what I had on hand...brown rice instead of white, fresh tomatoes instead of canned, and I added a sliced up roasted jalapeno to take place of the chilies in the canned tomatoes.  It has just the right kick!

I made this with the Salsa Chicken recipe from this web site, and they went well together.  I probably would have spiced it up a little with more chili powder (I used a little over 1/2 tsp.)and some jalapenos if I were making it alone, but with the Salsa on the chicken it was fine as it is. I did put a little sprinkle of cheddar cheese on it before serving.  It was delicious!

Fantastically delicious.  Use the diced tomato with green chiles.  It makes a difference.  I added fresh chiles because I could not find the diced with chiles in a can.

Substituting the water for chicken broth truly makes the flavor. I added other dry hot peppers to give it some heat. I have never made rice like this and my family raved about it.

I love Spanish rice, but not my husband. However, he really enjoyed this recipe. He asked me to make it again!  I changed one ingredient. I substituted a cubanelle pepper, also known as Cuban pepper, for the green pepper. That's what I had on hand. I will definitely make this recipe again!  Goodbye store-bought Spanish rice!

This is a very good recipe for spanish rice, my only recommendation is to add some fresh garlic and some cumin. Great side dish, just needs a bit more spice to make it five stars (just my opinion). Thank you for sharing your recipe!

This was a great recipe. I made it according to the direction. I was planning on taking it to a potlucj and so I knew it would be sitting in a crock-pot for a while. Before I added it to the crock pot, I put 1/2 a can of tomato juice in the bottom of the crock pot and I believe this helped keep it moist

Great recipe!  This is the first time I've successfully made spanish rice.  I took Jodi Lynn's advice and use bacon grease and chicken stock but left out the bell peppers. I used jasmine rice and it was scrumptious!

It was a little bland for my taste. I messed up and accidentally put 2 tablespoons of chili powder instead of teaspoons. It still as not that spicy at all. Maybe with some extra ingredients this recipe can be a little more exciting. It is certainly easy to make.

I used 2 cups cooked white rice instead of the uncooked and it was still very good. I sauted the onions and peppers until wilted , then I added the Rotel, 1 teaspood cumin and only 1 teaspoon chili powder, I simmered it together just long enough to heat the rice. Next time I will use the uncooked rice, but still add the cumin and keep the chili powder at 1 teaspoon. A keeper!

This was really, really good.  Like others, I used chicken stock in place of water and added a pinch of cumin.  I also subbed the tomatoes/chiles with 2 small fresh tomatoes and 1/2 of a jalapeno.  Next time I will probably add the whole jalapeno for a little more kick.

This is really good. Above "Restaurant Quality". 
I took others' advice and added garlic powder, ground cumin and chicken broth. For the broth, I found chicken bouillon with tomato in the Hispanic grocery section. Just be sure to cut back on the salt. Beautiful color and very flavorful. Immediate hit.

I followed the recipe as indicated. I put garlic, cumin and chicken broth as the one review suggested. In addition, when the rice was done I threw in a half cup of green onions and took off the burner. Everyone loved it! Already saved the recipe.

I had not made Spanish Rice since my children grew up and moved away, since I have been home, I have gotten back into cooking all the things I cooked every day back in the day.  I use jasmine rice for this recipe, a little yellow and green bell pepper, add a little powdered chicken boullion to your water for a little added flavor. Overall I am making Spanish Rice each week.

This dish was really yummy! I tripled the recipe because my family is big and it came out great. I did boil the rice in chicken broth as another viewer said. I also added some chopped garlic and sauteed it along with the green peppers, onions and hot peppers. A little cumin and it was good to go. I will definitely be using this recipe again!

A friend made this last weekend and she accidently grabbed a bowl with about a 1/4 cup sliced jalapenos (destined for jalapeno margaritas!) Once she realised what had happened she just left them, but added the green bell pepper.  My husband and I could have eaten the whole pot of this rice by ourselves!  It was a bit spicy, but not killer spicy, and was it was just fantastic.  I will make it going forward with jalapenos added.

I loved this rice. I used chicken stock instead of water like many suggested. I sauted the onion and bell pepper first with garlic added until tender then I removed them from the stove. I then browned my rice and added the onion, bell pepper and garlic when the rice was browned along with a 10 oz can of Rotel and chicken stock.

Really enjoyed, but had to put sugar in after realizing that the chili powder was too much and I only put half of what the recipe called for; therefore, next time, I will cut chili powder down to probably 1/4 teaspoon.  I used chicken broth instead of water and added some corn.

We enjoyed this!The man said it was my best attempt yet at making spanish rice not out of a box (which is what he prefers). I even tried it with brown rice and he didn't notice!

Excellent rice recipe. I could never get my spanish rice to come out not too sticky or dry. This turned out perfectly! Note: I never lifted the lid until I could see all the moisture was gone.

Skipped the peppers.  Very tasty.  Will make this one again.  Simple and good.  Switched the water with chicken broth and used bacon grease as suggested by other reviewers.

Made this last night and it was amazing.  I followed Jodi Lynn's advice and also added some red bell pepper and yellow bell pepper just for added color.  It was amazing.

This was delicious! Followed all suggestions (bacon grease, garlic, chicken broth, cumin) and it worked well.  We made it with brown rice and will not do that again.  It just didn't mesh well so we'll make it with the white rice next time.  Great flavor, good addition to any meal.

Changed the water for chicken stock. Very good recipe, as this was my first time making spanish rice from scratch. Very spicy with the chili powder; may tone it down next time.

Yum! I used chicken broth like others had suggested. I also didn't drain the can of diced tomatoes and chilies before adding to the pan so that the juice would add more flavor.

I love Spanish Rice and always purchase Rice a Roni brand. I absolutely LOVE this recipe. I too used the chicken broth instead of water. I used a can of Rotel w/green chili's. The tomato's were too big, I'll have to look for something different next time. It was so good and didn't stick together like boxed rices. I can eat this as a meal.

Use chicken broth instead of water, and 1/2 teaspoon of salt instead of 1 teaspoon.  Add one clove of mashed garlic.  Delicious!!!

Holy cats, this is good stuff! I've never attempted Spanish Rice before (other than from the ubiquitous red-and-white boxes), and I was very pleased with the ease of preparation of this recipe. I, like others before, used chicken broth instead of water, added a half teaspoon of cumin, and a scant palm-full of dried parsley. I made this last night as a last minute side for chicken enchiladas, mainly b/c we needed something in addition to a side salad, and also b/c we happened to have the ingredients on hand. Well, actually, I didn't have a full can of Rotel, so I supplemented it with some Pace. Turned out beautifully. This makes a ton -- probably more than 4 servings if it's served as a side dish. My dad insisted on keeping what we had left! Many thanks to the person who submitted this recipe -- it's definitely going into the household rotation from here on out!

An easy, tasty, one-pot side dish. After reading the recommendations of others, I too cut the chili powder down to 1 tsp, and added 1/2 tsp cumin. I also cut the salt down to 1/2 tsp. My can of diced tomatoes didn't have green chiles in it. Served this as a side dish to Spanish meatballs, and got the thumbs up from everyone.

This is a fabulous recipe...there was a power outage last winter and I made this recipe on the gas stove (thank goodness for gas stoves!) as I had everything on hand. I also popped open a can of store bought refried beans, thinned them out with a little water, re-seasoned them and served on top of this rice with a little monterey jack cheese...simple and satisfying...Thank you for posting!

VERY yummy and easy.  I didn't have any white rice, so I used instant brown rice.  Only thing I found..it needs A LOT more spice.  It's pretty bland as it is. But tastes fresh and satisfying.

be careful of how much moisture is added. i like many others did not use water, but used chicken stock. i would recommend adding the liquid into the pot in small quantities until you get the desired fluffiness of rice.

The flavor was really good BUT it was, as others said, very mushy... too much liquid.  Not sure if I did something wrong or the recipe just calls for too much liquids... I'll cut down on the liquid next time but there WILL be a next time!!  Yummm....

This was top notch.  I had tried improvising some Spanish rice in the past but wasn't happy, but this recipe is a keeper.  Was making enchiladas and got my recipes mixed up so made this with green onions instead of yellow onions but it was fine.  Also added some minced garlic with the onions.

this was FANTASTIC! way better than any Lipton or Rice a roni! for now on i will be making my OWN spanish rice!!!  I followed some suggestions and added garlic to the peppers/onions and sauteed first then added the rice (btw for this go around i used minute rice and it worked out fine) also used chicken broth instead of water... I had to double recipe and because i used minute rice had to make the ratio equal (2 cups rice to 2 cups broth) also added extra spice and cilantro....  can't wait to make it again! :)

This just did not work for me! The rice was still crunchy after cooking it for the suggested time. I added more chicken broth (since all of the moisture had cooked out) and microwaved it for an additional 15 minutes. The rice was STILL not done. Hardly anyone at my party ate it and I ended up throwing most of it away. I will not be making this again and am deleting it from my recipe box.

This was good; however, I did make a few changes.  I added garlic and used chicken broth instead of water, also had some chopped chicken breast and added that as well.

Very good and very easy, I like this better than a lot of the versions I've had at restaurants. I like to add some fresh chopped cilantro for some added flavor as well.

Is this from Spain? I thought this was Mexican. oh well.  Sure was delicious.  I was short on a few ingredient so I used  1 1/2 roasted Poblanos Peppers instead of Green Peppers and  4 oz of tomato paste (that i had squirreled away in the freezer) instead of canned tomatoes.   I had a bit of chicken stock so added that with some of the water.  Also, threw in a clove of garlic in to keep the vampires away. Turned out great.  In a food coma at the moment and loving the taste in my mouth.

Great Spanish Rice. You never again need to make the boxed stuff. A few changes made this a great accompaniment to the feast I had prepared (for just my husband and myself!). I added about 2 tsp minced garlic to the onions and bell pepper before adding the rice. I let the rice really take its time and turn a nice golden before adding in the tomatoes and chilies and chicken stock (used 2 cups of Kitchen Basics). Added about 1/2 teaspoon of ground cumin and garnished at the end with a little chopped cilantro. Wonderful flavor, texture. Went GREAT with the adobo sirloin from this web site, as well as the fried empanadas, also on this site.

I thought this recipe was good. I added it to a Chicken Enchilada dish. I added garlic salt versus regular salt.  I added some dice jalepano as I didnt have any chiles on hand. I also added diced olives too. I took the advice and added chicken broth instead of water. I omitted the bell pepper and it taste just fine. I would make this again.

Simply amazing. This is when I am glad I don't always five-star all recipes because it helps to define those that are truly 5-star! Followed this to a T and the whole family raved-- it makes a ton, too!

YUMMMMY!! This is VERY good, and the closest recipe to authentic spanish rice that i have found. I changed a couple tings. The first thing i changed was advice from a reviewer, and that was to use beef broth instead of water. Secondly, I used half of a large onion (this was for a double recipe) and it still had plenty of flavor. I think a whole onion would really be too much. I will definitely be making this again!! Thank you john mac!

This is a great Spanish rice recipe!  I sauted the onion by itself first (didn't have any green pepper on hand) with some garlic and then added the rice.  I also added some cumin.  Otherwise, followed the directions and it turned out great!

I'm with Jodi Lynn on the improvements. Parsley perks up the color, for sure. The only thing I do different is brown the rice in a dry skillet first. I set it aside, grilling the onion and bell pepper (and garlic) in the pan before adding everything else.  I've used brown rice; it takes a hour or so, but it's so good and healthy :)

great base for spanish rice. i did change it up a little by not adding the canned tomatos. i put one tablespoon of tomato paste & browned it up with the rice, onions & peppers before adding the liquid. i also used a little less water, so the rice would be fluffy. once rice was cooked, about 25 mins..i took it off the heat & let it sit (without opening the lid) for about 10 minutes & then fluffed it with a fork. came out perfect.

Made this for a belated Cinco De Mayo and Mother's Day combo celebration and got rave reviews from the in-laws! Would definitely make again. Made as directed, but it burned a little in the bottom of the pan. I was still waiting for the rest of my menu to finish cooking, so just let this set on the stove a little bit, and the extra time helped to steam the slightly burnt rice off the bottom. Still everyone loved it, and didn't seem to notice :)

Wow!  What a flavorful dish!  A little on the hot side for me, but my husband loved it.  I used only 1 T. oil,  and I subbed chicken broth for the water.  Went great with fish tacos.

I love this recipe but here are my changes:  1. I use a cast iron Dutch oven 2. I substitute about 1/2 a teaspoon of the chili powder with a smoked Spanish Paprika 3. I used a smoked grey sea salt for seasoning  I should say that I like this dish with a smokey flavor, where other people may not like it. I've gotten great reviews from those who have eaten it, though.  Now that Summer is here, I might go back to a regular sea salt, forgo the Smoked Spanish Paprika and do the whole thing on a charcoal grill instead.

If you halve the chili, I think this is a great colorful side. It was on the mushy side, but that was probably from something I did wrong. Overall, quick preparation for a filling dish. I made it with Viva Madrid Spanish Chicken (on this site)

This is a great recipe!  I didn't have any fresh onion or bell pepper but I did saute the rice with the oil and some onion powder.  I don't like the green chile/tomato combo so used a can of stewed tomatoes, 2 cups water and a chicken bouillion cube along with the chili powder.  It was DELICIOUS!

Very FRESH!  A great alternative to the sodium boxed stuff.  I subbed brown rice cooked in chicken stock and fresh tomatoes and peppers.  The whole family enjoyed it.  Thank you!

I skipped the bell pepper (didn't have one), added 1/2 tsp cumin.  I used a can of rotel tomatoes with green chilies.  This was wonderful.  I was completely surprised at how good this is. I will use less chili powder next time since it was really spicy (and I love spicy, but it was a little too strong for the family).

Oh wow this was FANTASTIC!! My husband is a big fan of packaged Spanish Rice and was really skeptical of me wanting to make this - and he couldn't stop raving and I doubt he'll ever get the boxed mix again! The only modification i made was to add 1/2tsp cumin as someone had suggested - and used chicken broth; it is so amazingly good!! You'll love it!!

I minused the bell pepper (because I hate it), added half a tsp of cumin, used brown rice instead of white, used olive oil instead of vegetable and besides the mistake of using the brown rice it was excellent! The flavor was perfect! The brown rice took way too long to cook and I didnt like the texture of it. Back to white rice for me! Adding a bit of cheddar on top when served was a nice little bonus too!

I was looking for a way to make Spanish style brown rice and this was a winner!! Yes I used chicken broth as others suggested, because I always do, much better flavor. I had on hand a red bell and so that was added in. Another suggestion said use cumin and that was fantastic, 1 tsp each of salt cumin and chili powder.  Of course if your using brown rice, the simmer time becomes about 50 min, and make sure to brown it in the pan for about ten stirring constantly so all the rice gets cooked evenly. Great recipe.

Loved this rice!!!  I didn't add the green pepper...not a fan.  Also I added a small can of tomato sauce in place of the diced tomatoes and some jarred jalapeno's for more heat.  I will make this again.  Yum!!!

This is a delicious and easy recipe. I didn't have a green pepper on hand, but it was still a great side for my chicken corn chili dish. The spiciness depends on the chili spice.

This was my first attempt at spanish rice and was pleased. I used green olive in place of the green pepper and added frozen corn. For the tomatoe sauce, I blended onion, green pepper, It. Seasoning and tomatoe. I also added a tiny bit of cayenne pepper and 1 pkg of Sazon Goya. EXCELLENT.

I thought this was great. Much better than the old recipe I'd been using. Glad I went looking for a new one. I did follow the suggestions of others and added some garlic and used chicken broth instead of the water. This one's definitely a keeper!

I doubled the recipe and the rice came out a little mushy.  Next time I will use less liquid and see what happens.  I sauteed the onions and bell pepper first.  I add some chopped garlic to the onions and peppers.  Added the rice until golden and then added chicken broth in place of the water as suggested by others.  Overall the recipe tasted good, I just need to use less broth.

Super easy to make.  I'll never buy another boxed recipe again.  This was the very best spanish rice.  I did add a bit of cilantro, was super yummmmmy.  When I make any sort of spanish entre, my family always request this spanish recipe.

This was delicious and easy.  I added some garlic powder, a fresh chopped jalapeno from my garden and ground cumin. Be careful it does burn easily and need a bit of stirring, but definitely a keeper!  I made this with spinach enchiladas verde from this website.  Excellent!

I liked this rice a lot though it seemed like it was missing something. I didn't add garlic against my better judgement and I think it might have made the difference. Overall pretty tasty though and it is very easily prepared so there is no need to buy the boxed stuff.

When I made this recipe for my mother-in-law's 70th birthday dinner, one guest told me it was the best Spanish rice they'd ever had.  I used chicken broth instead of water to cook the rice and cumin, as suggested.  We always use brown rice because of the higher nutritional value.  Thanks so much.  I'm not a native Texan, so I would never have come up with this on my own!

I used the feedback to make this a 5-star recipe, but I've rated according to the recipe as written. Browning the rice in a tablespoon or two of bacon fat or butter gives it a more robust flavor. Sauteeing veggies first in the same flavor provides more depth. Adding garlic enhances the other veggies. And yes, using chicken or vegetable broth in place of water does boost the flavor yet again. Last, 1/2 teaspoon or so of cumin (comino) does provide a fuller flavor than chili powder alone. Skip the salt - everything else has enough to carry through.

I was skeptical of this recipe at first, but it turned out very well.  After living in Mexico and falling in love with the food, it is very difficult to impress me.  But this is a keeper, not quite as good as "real" spanish rice, but close enough.

Very good!  We omitted the pepper, substituted chicken broth for water, and added 1/2 tsp. cumin and 1 clove minced garlic.  A super important thing to remember ... do NOT stir the rice once you add the liquid or it will clump up which ruins the texture.

Fantastic Spanish Rice. Very delicious. I'm trying to teach my husband how to cook and I gave him this recipe (the only thing my husband can cook is grilled cheese sandwich). He masted this recipe first time. I loved this recipe because it was spicy and restaurant quality. I love it.

This was delicious. I used 1 1/2 cup chicken broth instead of 2 cups of water. I also added some chopped jalapenos. When it was done cooking, I turned off the burner, sprinkled grated cheese on the rice and covered with the lid for a few minutes, allowing the cheese to melt.

This is by far the best spanish rice I have made. I stuck to the recipe with one exception. I added Goya brand Adobo seasoning salt in place of the salt. I'm not a huge fan of spanish rice in mexican restaurants but this spanish rice is exceptional.

Great recipe. I've made it several times now. I like to add a can of drained and rinsed black beans and serve wrapped in flour tortillas.

A little bland. May try adding garlic and using broth next time as well as using less tomatoes.

I didn't use as much chili powder, but added garlic powder, cumin and bacon fat. Also, toward the end of cooking time, I added a little crumbled bacon for more flavor. Mine took a little longer to cook.

Followed the recipe exactly and it was incredibly easy and delicious.  It has a fantastic kick to it for someone like me who loves spice.  Perfect as a side dish to chicken enchiladas.

Very, very good - You do need to be careful and stir and check every few minutes - burns easily.  Like others I added garlic, used chicken broth and cumin.

I just made this with a few variations.  I used green onions and waited to add the rice.  I used brown rice because that was all I had, which was fine.  And added two chicken boulion cubes with the water.  This was excellent!  My 4 and 6 year old weren't sure when I was making it but loved it!  Great recipe!  I'll be making this one again.  Thanks!

I would rate this at a 4 1/2 but since it was delicious I gave it the benefit. I made a few changes: added a cup of onions, 2 cloves of garlic as well as chicken broth instead of water. I noticed that there was a chicken broth under taste that was a little too prominant, and so next time I think I will reduce the amount of chicken broth and supplement with some water. It was really good and really simple to make, and I already had most of the ingredients in my home. It produced days worth of left overs as a dish by itself or in burritos which my boyfriend often used it for.

I made this, and it was fabulous!!! I did however follow the suggestions from Jodi Lynn.....And this recipe was awesome. This was a hit with the guys from my husband unit. I doubled the recipe and the guys put away a batch and a half. Hubby said it was right on the money..... Every suggestion that Jodi Lynn made to this recipe, was right on point. I used bacon grease instead of vegetable oil. Chicken Broth instead of water, added 1/2 tsp per batch, which was 1 tsp. And I saute'ed the onion and bell peppers with fresh minced garlic before adding the rice to brown with it..So far this is to be the favorite Spanish rice recipe yet.......;-)

This was the first time making Spanish rice and it came out amazing.  I can't wait to eat the leftovers today for lunch.  After reading the other reviews I used chicken broth in place of water, added a cube of chicken buillion, minced garlic, and 1/2 teaspoon of ground cumin.  Next time I will omit the salt because it was a bit salty since I used the buillion.  Great recipe!

This was a tasty recipe! Rather than using green chili's I chopped up a jalapeno to give the recipe a little kick and it was great! Next time I might use fresh tomatoes but overall this was a great side dish for chicken burritos!

Good, but a bit too much chili powder taste and the rice was too wet, even after having set up 10 min. before serving.  I would cut down on the liquid by 1/2 c.  Added a bit of cumin, which provides good flavor.

Sometimes I wonder if I am eating the same recipe that everyone else is raving about. This was actually a tomato "something" with a little rice thrown in. Toooo tomato-heavy (and I love tomatoes)for my tastes. The Spanish Rice I remeber eating is rice w/ some tomato and flavorful. This was not either.

Flavors were great.  I, despite all the warnings, had to take the lid off and transfer the rice to a bigger pot so it turned out gummy. I baked it to dry it up a bit and threw some cheddar on top and it was still delicious.

I have been making this recipe for over a year now... and I was shocked that I forgot to review this! I use it so much I don't even look at the recipe anymore :) This is a quick go-to recipe & I make sure to always have cans of diced tomatoes w/ jalepenos on hand. If you don't like a lot of heat, use less chili powder & I always go by the ratio 1.5cups of water to 1 cup of rice. It produces sticky, fluffy rice! Mmm! I use basmati rice with this dish, I prefer the fluffiness that rice has. Also, it soaks up all the flavours beautifully! The best advice I can suggest is to be careful as to what type of tomatoes you pick up... Once I accidentally grabbed diced tomatoes w/ chili flavouring.. ick. Make sure its diced tomatoes w/ some sort of hot pepper- it makes all the difference. Enjoy!

I thought this recipe was delicious!  For added flavor I replaced the water with chicken broth and added 1 Tbsp. chopped garlic and 1/2 tsp. cumin.  I also sauteed the veggies for a bit before adding rice.  I'll definitely make this again.  Thanks!

This was good and easy to make.  Next time I think I will sub chicken stock for water.  I did not find the ro-tel type tomatoes to spicy in the dish.  I may up the spice anti next time.  Thanks for sharing.

I used Chicken Broth 14 1/2 ounce can, and a few  pieces of Penzy's dried jalapeno also  one clove of crushed garlic.  WOW.  Very good. It was spicy, but we loved it.  Oh.... My diced tomatoes and chiles was a  14 1/2 ounce  can and it was fine.  i figured if it would have been soupy I would have  added a little minute rice, but it wasn't necessary I made it a second time, I used two  14.5 ounce cans of diced tomatoes and 22 ounces of water, followed the recipes  doubling the other ingredients.  It is really a little to spicy for me. I prefer it the first way better.     Ithink I like it better the way I did it the first time.

Loved it! I also used one cup chicken broth in place of one cup water, also I added fresh garlic.  No complaints on this end! Thanks for sharing your recipe!

I made this last night for mhy fiancee and did my best to follow the recipe. My store didn't have the tomatoes with the chiles so I used a can of diced tomatoes and 4.5 oz can of drained chopped green chiles and that worked out well. I made it with the lime picante chicken also on this site and it was a great meal!

This recipe disappointed me. I only had 1 1/2 tsp of chili powder, but I don't think that would have helped. It was so bland with only the spices listed. I used chicken broth instead of water, and added cumin, cayenne, Adobo, Sazon,and garlic to kick it up.

Very tasty rice recipe with the following changes: used basmati (Indian) rice, no green pepper, added 1 t. garlic with the rice, chicken broth instead of water, drain the tomatoes and green chilis before adding, and only one t. chili powder. Served with "Beef Enchiladas II" and it make quite a meal!

This was very tasty. I added jalapeno peppers since I couldn't get the diced tomatoes with green chiles (only plain). It needed a bit more spice (we like a kick) so a bit more chile powder was added. Will make again.

I added less water than the recipe called for and it still came out soggy.  It was good nonetheless, but next time I will add one cup water because the rice soaks up the liquid from the diced tomatoes as well.  I also added 2 teaspoons cumin and fresh chopped cilantro before serving.

YUM!  I was able to throw together this recipe in a pinch.  It uses common ingredients that I always have in the pantry -- that is a sign of a recipe I can keep!  I didn't have any tomatoes with chilies, so I just used canned tomatoes and a hot pepper from my garden.  Turned out fantastic!

Great flavor. The only thing I changed was that I didn't have tomatoes with chilies, or green peppers. To add some flavor and veggies, I did half (plain) diced tomatoes and half salsa. Quadrupled the recipe, and put in freezer bags for easy meals. Thanks for the great recipe!!

Yummy - better than the recipes that just say to add salsa.  I used diced tomatoes without green chiles because I didn't have any and less chili powder.   I have to keep things mild for my husband and children.

This was really good.  We've always been fans of spanish rice, but hate using the prepackaged stuff.  This came out just right.  I made it as writted, except used chicken broth and added a half teaspoon of cumin.  When I first started making it, it looked like it was going to be WAY too much onion, but it turned out just right.  And the spice was dead on.  Definately a keeper.

This rice is very good and easy to make. I have made it a few times so far and I will keep making it. It is so much better than the stuff out of the box. It just tastes more fresh. Also, it is cheaper to buy a bag of white rice and make it how I want then to buy a bunch of small boxes.

Delicious! Taste just like Mexican Rice from the restaurant. Changes: I used 14.5 oz can of diced tomatoes w/ sauce and 1.5 cups of rice, a little garlic, cumin, 1 tsp paprika and 1 tsp chili powder. I simmered the rice on low heat but it was done within 20 min, so be careful.

This recipe is spectacular!!!  The cans of diced tomatoes with green chiles were 14.5 ounce, so I reduced the amount of water to 4 1/2 cups and it was out of this world!! I was asked for the recipe already.  Will definitely make it again!

After reading the other reviews I knew I needed to cut down on the liquid.(not fond of moist rice like that) So I cut down on 1/2 cup of the water(I used chicken broth)and added a little more rice than what's called for. The rice was still moist but not gooey. I used an 8 oz can of tomato sauce and a can of diced green chiles. I also added 2 cloves of chopped garlic to the saute mix. I added some cumin and cut down on the chile powder by half. Made for a good sidedish on taco night. Thanks for the recipe.

Very good and easy.  I doubled the recipe, but only used one can of the diced tomatoes with chiles.  Like others, I sauteed the onions and peppers with some garlic before adding the rice.  And I used chicken broth in place of the water.

A great side dish, or addition to burritos, I recommend substituting everything fresh that you can when possible (tomatoes and peppers specifically), it really adds to the taste!

Very good side dish, but lots of leftovers that were never eaten. I need to get the hang of this "browning dry rice" thing as i feel like i burned a few too many kernels, nuggets whatever there called.

Very good. We needed a lot as we were having company over so I tripled the amount of rice but only doubled the amount of everything else (e.g., onion, canned tomato and chiles, etc.) and it turned out fine. I also substituted brown rice for white, used chicken broth in place of half the water, and used chili poweder to taste (we like things spicy here!).

Everyone liked it; I don't think I'll go back to lazy package mixes of Spanish rice after this. :-)

I thought the flavor of this was wonderful but mine was too mushy. I followed the recipe exactly so I'm not sure where I went wrong or if it's just supposed to be this way? I plan on trying it again, though. This time I'll use less liquid. Thanks for posting!

Yum! This had a kick from the chili powder but don't be scared. I'm a wimp with spices and the chili powder is totally on your taste buds but its a good flavor. Really good tasting and reheats well. I also used vegetable stock instead of water and I used the whole green bell pepper, why not? Very nice recipe.

This rice does have a nice flavor. I'm still on my quest for a dryer fluffier rice though.  I did add 3 cloves of minced garlic with the onion and used chicken stock rather than water to start.  I had to add about 3/4 cup more water during cooking though as it just had cooked in and the rice still wasn't done in the center after 15 minutes or so. I think that was probably me having the heat up a bit too high though.

Great recipe. I used chicken broth instead of water to add more flavor. This one turned out perfect. I often burn rice when cooked on the stove like this, but this time was different. It came out moist, but not soggy, and nothing stuck to the pot.

I have never made spanish rice before - thought it was easier to buy a package at the store.  WHAT WAS I THINKING?? I did not have onion or green pepper and only 1 can of tomatoes and it still came out great.  Plus, my kids are eating it!!!  Thank You!

I have made this a few times now and it is a big hit! The only change I made is I use chicken broth instead of water. I double the recipe and it makes a lot! Great accompaniment with just basic cheese quesadillas and sweet corn cake(found on this site as well)!

I made this and followed some others suggestions by adding cumin, using chicken broth, garlic and extra chili powder... i think without some of these ingredients it might have been dull... but its one of the best spanish rices i have ever made.

Very good. I made a few changes, I omitted the green pepper because I didn't have one, and the chili powder and substituted cumin and cayenne pepper. I also used water and chicken base because I didn't have stock. It turned out great, my bf said it was better than any he's had in a restaurant.

This was awesome! I followed the tips in some of the reviews and only made small alterations.I used two cups chicken broth instead of water and I added 1/4 tsp. of ground cumin. I also added a can of diced green chiles. My picky hubby loved this rice and so did I! I will make this over and over again! Thanks for such a great dish!

I don't know what is so great about this recipe. I've made boxed ones that taste just the same. I think next time--if there IS a next time--I'll add garlic and fresh jalepenos. 

The way it is written, it's just BLAND.

YUM! Better than the boxed Mexican/Spanish rice. I also used chicken broth instead of water, I used brown rice, 1 clove of fresh garlic, and 1/2 teaspoon of cumin. It's so delicious! I topped it with chopped cilantro and ate it with canned black beans and crunchy turkey tacos. This is my new rice recipe, love it!

I made this as a side dish for simple burritos. I did tweak the recipe, but am sure that as is it would be delicious as well. I used low-sodium chicken broth plus enough water to make 2 cups of liquid and only used half of the chili powder. I didn't have any Tomatoes with Chilis, so I simply used a can of diced tomatoes. The result was delicious...enough flavor for my husband and I to enjoy it, but not too much spice for my young kids (who gobbled it up, by the way).

Meh. I added garlic and cumin as others have suggested, as well as some chopped up red pepper, and it was overall "OK." Edible but nothing extraordinary. Spiciness was just right but flavor overall bland. It needs something -- fresh herbs maybe? Would not make again.

This recipe was delicious!! This was definitely better than the boxes of spanish rice mixes!! I did not alter the recipe at all and it was perfect. For my family I was able to use the mild flavor of tomatoes and chilies, but you can spice it up to your own liking. This is a definite keeper!!

I only gave this four, because the night I made it my husband and I were not all that impressed. The next day - completly different story! YUM!  I guess the flavors intensified overnight.  I will definitely make this again, and I will follow others suggestions and try chicken broth. Thanks for the recipe!

Spanish Rice has been an old standby of mine for many years when I need to come up with something quick and easy for dinner.  This recipe is a good version, simple, economical, and it used items I already had on hand.  I doubled the ingredients so there would be leftovers for next day's lunch.  To make it more filling, instead of using the vegetable oil I sauteed a pound of ground beef with the onion, green pepper and rice.  I used 14-1/2 ounce cans of tomatoes (one Mexican style, one Italian style, because that's what I had in the cupboard).  They worked just fine, and all the liquid was absorbed.

This was a great base recipe. I used the suggestions for adding in cumin and garlic, and also used chicken stock. I used brown rice instead of white and it was delicious.

OK...I did tweak a bit! I followed Jodi Lynn's review, however, instead of finishing this on the stovetop...I combined my sauteed onions/bell pepper/garlic mix with 1 cup of chicken stock along with a 10 oz can of Rotel tomatoes (w/grn chilies). 2 cups of liquid w/the can of tomatos will produce mushy rice. I toasted long grain white rice (rinsed well) in tblsp of bacon grease in hot cast iron skillet (med heat) until lightly browned. Stir constantly to avoid burning. Mixed in 1 tsp chili powder & cumin with sprinkle of sea salt & fresh grnd coriander to the hot toasted rice. Added liquids to sizzling HOT seasoned rice. Covered with oven proof glass tempered lid and baked at 350 for 30 - 40 minutes. Mine turns out PERFECTLY cooked and not mushy/gloppy. Doesn't stick and no stirring required. Fluffed it around with a fork afterwards. I confess, I can't seem to cook rice correctly on the stove top and I bake alongside my chicken or beef enchiladas. I top lightly with crumbled Queso cheese, minced fresh cilantro and a squeeze of lime as a personal touch.

Yummy! This was really great. I had all intentions to cook this with Chicken stock instead of plain water, but forget to get it when i was shopping. But this was great as stated with just the water. Gets a little sticky at the bottom towards the end. Make sure to stir all the time and never leave it too long, otherwise their will be a burnt mass as the bottom... - served with salsa chicken also from this site!

This was just OK.  I found that with the amount of water and the can of tomatoes there was too much liquid which lead to a longer cook time which lead to mushy rice.  I guess I could try to alter next time but I wasn't pleased with the dish as a whole.  I will not try this one again.

This is the second recipe I've used to make Spanish Rice and it is good! I'd agree with putting some jalapenos in with the onion and bell pepper, but it was good without it too. I might try some other recipes, but this is definitely a good one.

I made this last night and am not sure what I think about it.  My husband liked it, but somehow it had sort of a "sweet" flavor - not sure why.  Maybe the onion I used was too large so too much onion?  I don't know - can't figure it out.  Also mine was a little wet, but I did stir it and some reviews I've read say you should not touch it at all while it's cooking.  Maybe I'll try it again adding garlic and some cumin for a different flavor and maybe add less liquid - or maybe I'll try another recipe.

I did not like this rice at all. I used half chili powder and half cumin as others suggested and it was still too spicy. My husband enjoyed it and said it tastes like real Spanish rice. I guess I'm just a spoiled brat American who prefers the 'San Francisco treat'.

This was pretty good. It was a little hotter than I prefer - I was sweating by the time dinner was over!! Definitely tasty, but might use less chili powder and even drain the sauce from the can of tomatoes before adding. My husband said he liked it better than the packaged rice I usually make. Thanks!

I followed the exact directions except i added 1/4 tsp cumin. (Well instead of water I used chicken broth). I have no idea what went wrong! The rice was still crunchy-even burnt on the bottom of the nonstick pan. It was SO spicy that I could hardly eat it without drinking milk right afterwards. (I am not that sensitive to some spicy foods...so I was surprised). I wanted it to have more rice so maybe next time I will add more rice with even more broth/water. I ended up having a few bites and throwing the rest away...well theres always next time...

Did not like this -- I've made much better recipes for Spanish rice.  Too much tomato and not fluffy enough.  I ended up throwing out most of it.

I made this for lunch for my 2 yo son and his 2 yo friend.  I made it following the directions exactly and it was a big hit.  It wasn't too spicy for them at all and it was very easy to make.  I think I will make this often!

We loved it (I even had it for b-fast the next day).  Made it for family, so only used 1 t of chili powder, but will probably use the whole 2 t the next time.  I did use a combo of orange, green and red peppers.

Great recipe! I used 1 can (14 1/2) ounces of chicken stock instead of water and it was perfect.  Added only 1 t. chili powder and dash cumin.  If you like, spicy you will love it. But what is nice is that you can add a little less Rotel, if you like it less spicy .

I was looking for a good basic spanish rice recipe that is open to changes in spice and this is it! It was very simple from start to finish, and had a good flavor. I added garlic and a dash of hot sauce. Omitted green pepper, as I did not have any, but will use next time. Thanks!

It was a pretty good recipe but not amazing.  The rice seemed a bit hard - maybe I just didn't cook it long enough.  But nonetheless, we ate it and it was tasty with some sour cream on top.

I've been looking for so long an authentic spanish rice recipe.  Look no more this is perfect.  I added chicken broth instead of water and reduced salt to 1/2 teaspoon since I used the broth.  Excellent!!!!  I did not have green peppers on hand and wish I had!
Loved it!!

I thought this was easy and tasty.  I made this a couple of weeks ago for a mexican themed pot luck.  I doubled the recipe as I was serving 10.   There were some comments that it was a little spicy (that may have been my fault, as I did add a bit more cayenne than called for, since I love spicy!)  Overall it must have been a hit with everyone, as I have been asked to bring this again to the next pot luck!!!

Very easy to throw together while you're prepping the rest of your meal. The family STILL thought the amt. of chili powder was too spicey (the big babies, lol!) so I'll just decrease that next time and add some hot sauce to my own serving. Very good!

I absolutely loved this rice. I made a small batch to try before I served it at a dinner with friends and asked my husband to taste it. He ate the whole pan and he is a picky eater. Everyone at the dinner asked for the recipe.

Easy as can be!  I grew up on taco night eating spanish rice that came out of a "just add water" kind of package and this is SO MUCH BETTER!  My kids love it and my husband, who can be picky, inhales it.  We make it without bell pepper due to a food allergy, and some time I may try it with tomato sauce instead of the diced tomatos with chilis for a different texture.  But it's perfect!  Even my mother in law wanted the recipe - thank you!

One of the easiest and best tasting spanish rice recipes I've ever had!  Can add beans to it or use tomato sauce instead--can even use salsa in it and on it!  YUM!  Kids really love it!

My husband loves this rice. I added half of a red pepper in addition to the green one, and also a small can of mexican style corn at the end. Also added just a tad more chili powder because we like it spicy!

Really yummy!

Just watch (and maybe stir) the pot during the 30 minute "simmering" process.  The rice tends to stick to the bottom of the pan (and burn).

Good rice! Based on the reviews, I decided to use some chicken stock in place of the water. However, rather than have the taste become too overpowering I opted to use 1 cup chicken stock and 1 cup water. I used an entire green bell pepper and not just 1/2. And since I thought that the diced tomatoes with green chiles would be too spicy for my tame tastes, I used a can of chili seasoned diced tomatoes, which worked great. Overall, a good and simple rice recipe.

Very good side dish. I've never made my own rice, and it is tons better than any box I've had. Will definitely make again. However, although I halved the recipe (to make 2 servings), it still made too much for my husband and I to finish. Look forward to lunch tomorrow though!

This recipe was great, my husband lost a spanish rice recipe that he had made years ago, and I told him about this site,  we looked through the recipies and this was the one he chose. He made it and we ate it as a meal, he did add some meat and it was great...Thanks!

I added two cloves of garlic to the onion mix and 1 tsp cumin to the sauce and I have to say that it turned out really good.  This was a side dish to my husbands delectable cabbage rolls.  Can't wait to have the leftovers!!!!!!  Yum!!

Simple and delicious!  This reminds me of a popular Nigerian dish called jellof rice.  I used about half the amount of chili powder the recipe called for because I didn't want it too spicy and doubled the amount of salt because I am a salt fiend.  Also I used about 3 cups of water to properly cook the rice as 2 cups definitely wasn't going to cut it.  Will definitely make this again and I'll try add more peppers and scallions.

This rice is great! I used 1 cup of salsa in place of the tomatoes because that is what I had on hand. I also added a packet of goya sazon to the water. Also I sauteed some cumin and the chili powder with the rice, peppers, and onions for the last 2 minutes. I will be making this all the time!

This recipe was excellent!! I used brown rice instead of white but only because that's what I had on hand. Other than that I followed the recipe exactly and wouldn't change a thing. Even my very picky 10 year old loved it. That doesn't happen very often. Thanks for sharing.

I loved this.  Because I only had the Rotell with lime and cilantro, I used that and I used a whole can of chilis- next time, a half would do.  It was a great recipe and I will be making it again.

Absolutely the best rice I have ever had, and it is easy to make.  I substituted chicken broth for the water.  Added a couple of shakes of cumin and a little cayenne pepper.  I'm from Louisiana and dishes can't get too spicy for us.  All my dinner guests loved it.  It was all eaten...NO LEFTOVERS.  Thanks so much for the recipe.  It is a keeper.......

I loved this recipe. As always I slightly modified it according to what ingredients I found in my house at the time. I used red bell pepper instead of the green and chicken broth instead of the water. Because of the broth I didn't add extra salt. I had chopped, canned tomatoes and a can of diced green chilis. I used half the can of green chilis. Since I shared the dish with our neighbors who don't eat spicy food I didn't add any chili powder. In the end I had to add just a little more liquid. All in all I used a whole can of chicken broth and one can of water. The rice had a lot of flavor. Next time we will make it a little more spicy for us.  Thanks for the great recipe.

This was very good! Used the mild Rotel. However, we thought this was still too hot for our taste. Next time, I will cut the pepper in half.

I used brown rice instead of white rice, 1 cup of water & one cup of chicken broth, & half the amount of chili powder.  I think I could have used a little more chili powder and it would have been better with less liquid (probably less water).

This is officially my favorite Spanish Rice Recipe. This was so good. I served it with Chicken Enchilada's II from this website with the Apple Enchilada's for desert from this site as well. This rice was perfect and the recipe I was looking for. Better then any Mexican restuarate Ive been too. Thanks for sharing!

I'm not a huge Spanish rice fan, but this recipe was really good.  Much more flavor than others I've eaten.  This is now the tried-and-true favorite!

Dave, great recipe!  The best Spanish rice ever! I also made a couple of changes.  I used the low sodium chicken broth instead of water, added salsa as an extra ingredient, and spinkled green onions on top.

used plain canned tomatoes and added fresh diced jalapenos.  It was great... except I burned the bottom because I left it turned up too high when it was simmering.  Whoops!  But yummy!

Awesome recipe! I did substitute the water with chicken broth as others suggested and I used a jar of homemade salsa in place of the can of diced tomatoes and green chiles. That gave it a nice kick. I served it with chicken quesadillas. It was great!

We didn't like this rice as much as others we have tried - it was bland, probably because we only added 1 tsp. of chili powder - next time would add the full 2 tsp.

Yum! I subbed 1 cup of mild salsa for the can of tomatoes w/chiles.  Added 1 Tbs cumin.  Such an easy, cheap way to make rice.  Even my kids loved it.  I'm going to try to add some ground beef and tomato sauce to this for stuffed peppers.

I'm not a big fan of Spanish rice, but this was pretty good. I used a can of the extra hot Ro-tel tomatoes and chiles and thought it overpowered the taste, so next time I'll make sure not to buy the extra hot! I used 1 tsp chili powder and 1/2 tsp of cumin and it gave the rice a good flavor. I also sauteed the onions/green peppers (and an extra jalapeno) before browning the rice. I can never get my rice to the perfect consistency, but this was the closest I've gotten yet! Served with Mesquite Grilled Pork Chops with Apple Salsa found on this site and it was a great pairing!

This was a fabulous recipe.  I have always had problems with spanish rice even though I am a decent cook but this recipe was absolutely fool-proof!  I did up the chili powder to almost 3 full tsp. and added 1 tsp. of cumin because I like the flavors but it was really quite good as is.  I also used homemade chicken broth in place of the water and that turned out well.  Thanks for a great recipe!

We really enjoyed this one. We used 2 cups of low-sodium chicken broth instead of water, and added about a tablespoon of sliced jalapeno from a jar. So good!

Never made spanish rice before. Everyone loved it, including my husband who is very picky about spanish rice. Very easy to make. Substituted water with chicken broth. Wonderful flavor.

This is a keeper! My family likes cumin, so I used 1 tsp. cumin and 1 tsp. chili powder. I also experimented with using half water and half chicken broth... very good.  THANKS FOR POSTING IT DAVE!

excellent recipe. I tweaked it a bit by using a can of low sodium chicken broth, a 14 oz can of diced tomatoes with Jalapenos and about 1/8 cup of green chilis..thinking this might be hot enough I only added 1 tsp of chili powder. Next time will use 2 as the recipe called for.  Will definitely make this again

I really enjoyed this as a good change from boxed spanish rice. My suggestions for making this again would be to sautee the bell pepper and onions on their own first so that they get more cooked before adding the rice. Rice seemed to burn quickly before the onions and bell peppers were finished. It was a bit bland until I added a lot of chili pepper. I may try the chicken broth instead of water idea that some people here list. Other than that I am no longer a boxed spanish rice user. Good job!

Delicious!  I served with this rice with Seafood Enchilada's and it was a perfect compliment.  I used Vegetable broth instead of water and the recipe said to simmer approx. 30 minutes (or until liquid is absorbed) ... it took closer to 45 min to 1 hour instead.  I will definately make this again!

This was the best homemade Spanish rice I've ever had! I used two garlic cloves, and jalepeno to saute with the onions, etc. I also used chicken broth instead of water. The amount of Chili powder suggested was perfect (I love spicy dishes though). Will make again!!

Easy and delicious! My teenage daughter and her firends love this. So much better than any packaged spanish rice product. We did garnish with some monterey jack cheese! Also, used a 14.5 oz. can of tomatoes and it was fine. A keeper.

It's very good, but the amount of water made it mushy.  I'd definitely add less water than it called for.

I didn't think it had a lot of flavor. I halved the recipe for two of us, and cut back on the chili powder. It tasted mostly like tomatoes. I would change up the spices next time - if I make it again.

As someone mentioned on the carnitas recipe I skimmed the pork broth and used it in place of the water, otherwise followed the direction to a T. My rice was burnt on the bottom (perhaps it should specify to lower the heat) otherwise the top

I didn't have tomatoes of any kind, so I used Knoor's tomato and chicken bullion; two cubes.  Also, instead of chilies (since my other two dishes were full of them), I browned, then stirred in a 1/4 pound of chorizo while the rice cooked.  It was a big hit with everyone, including me.

This was simple and yummy AS-IS. My kids and hubby all loved it. Yes, other things can be added, but if you’re reviewing THIS recipe, why rewrite it?? It makes a different recipe. If yours is so much better, submit it. It’s useless to review a recipe if you change the whole thing. Just sayin.

I pretty much followed the recipe :), 'cept I used what I had on hand as usual :), 1 yellow pepper/1 Cup diced instead of 1/2 green; added 1/2 tsp cumin; my own canned pint of herbed tomatoes & I added a can of black beans.

Oh my goodness was this yummy! I did as another said and sautéed my onions, garlic and fresh garden peppers first before adding the rice to brown. I used chicken bouillon instead of water.
Added my fresh garden tomatoes instead of canned...this is for sure a keeper!

So I know, 5 stars and I changed the recipe. But it was so so so good!!! I substituted water for chicken broth. Omitted the onion (yuck). Used the bell pepper but with some minced jalapeño & garlic. But that was it! Same seasonings and method otherwise. Y’all, I will never ever make a different Spanish rice EVER.

I used some garden jalapenos instead of green pepper.  Added 1 tbsp of chicken bouillion soup base to the water. Threw in about 1 cup small cherry tomatoes from our garden with the rice, pepper, onion mixture.  Husband said to keep the recipe.

I agree with others that it was rather bland, much like the rice you get in a Mexican restaurant.  It sorely lacked flavor.  It's a good base recipe, but I will be rewriting it to include  garlic, broth (chicken or beef) and a 1/2 teaspoon of cumin.

Great as-written; I normally would have taken Jodi's advice (at least with the bacon grease and chicken stock) but the first time I made this, I was serving it to a vegan, and the original recipe worked out just fine. It was more flavorful than I would have expected, judging by the ingredient list. 

El Pato hot tomato sauce is a good alternative to the can of tomatoes and green chilis, if you're serving it to someone who doesn't like the texture of tomato chunks, just fyi (gives it a richer spicy flavor, too).

I  added 1 clove of pressed garlic to the onions, pepper and rice when I sauteed them.  I also sauteed the rice until brown which is the key to it not turning out mushy.  I followed the advice of other reviewers and used chicken stock instead of water; and I used 1 tbl of taco seasoning and 1 tsp of cumin instead of chili powder.   It was very good and I would definitely make it again.

OMG, this was SOOOO good. Changes I made: I used real tomatoes cut in small pieces and I used home made chicken stock. This was seriously the most delicious rice I have ever made (and I make rice almost every day)

Really liked it, only change I made was I used garlic salt instead of regular salt.  Needed to keep my eyes on it better, if I hadn't caught it it would have burnt >.

I have followed this recipe for years and it is fantastic! Living in South Texas we have a Mexican influence everywhere and this hits it! You can alter this so easily per personal tastes with great outcome! I always add cumin...because.. and use broth vs water. Easily prepared and greatly enjoyed! Thank you for sharing!!!!

I changed the bell peppers to Chipotle peppers and used brown rice instead of white. I also used straight diced tomatoes instead of the tomatoes and green chiles.   I substituted the Chile powder for Fajita seasoning to cut the spice a little for our youngest. You have to let it cook a little longer with brown rice.  The family ate the whole pot even though i changed it to serve 8 expecting some leftovers.

This was easy and treated really good. I substituted chicken broth instead of water and added garlic in with the rice when sauteed, as well as added cumin with the chili powder.

Very mushy and wet. I added more spice so it wasn't bland but it was hard to eat since the texture was just so nasty. I let it simmer a little longer too since I could see it was still wet. Also I used less water in the first place.

This recipe turned out very goopy. Also, goopy green bell peppers just don't go well with rice. Just goopy and inedible.

I substituted Chicken Stock for the water.  It was outstanding. I'm pretty sure it would have been very good with the water, but we all love to tinker.

Was really good.  Next time I will follow some of the other reviews and use chicken broth instead of water, and likely add a little cumin.  However, I made it as written for a group to go with chicken tacos.  Got  several compliments.

I made this today, and followed Jodi Lynn's adjustments about adding cumin and making it with chicken broth. I DID end up needing about 1/2 - 3/4 cup water, but it tastes absolutely amazing! Thank you so much for this amazing recipe =)

Super easy to make and delicious. I work late nights at a grocery store and grab these simple ingredients on my way out. It simmers while I'm in the shower, and it's ready by the time I start up my Xbox.

Made this tonight, what a great  easy recipe! I sticked to the recipe pretty much only changes that I made was that I used chicken stock instead of water and added garlic, jalapeno , and whatever veggies  I had in fridge.  Dash of cumin and Mexican oregano. The rice cooks up well. I served it with baked tilapia and corn tortillas. Yum!

I use 1 cup of water and one cup of broth for a little more flavor. Also. this steams quickly on my electric stove in a deep skillet, adding a little more water seems to steam the dish more evenly. I think I may add a little cumin next time also.

I was looking for an easy Spanish Rice to add to my enchilada's.This was perfect. I exchanged the green bell peppers for 1/2 orange and red bell peppers and added some green chilis and garlic for flavor and color. I used vegetable broth instead of water with a bit of Spanish seasoning zest. Hmm, hmm, good! It came out wonderful.

Will definitely make it again. Followed the recipe to a tee, just added a bit of hot sauce to boot it up a little. Went great with the touch of chili powder.

This was a really easy dish to make and the results were great. I did add beans to make the two side dishes into one, very happy.

This is almost like my Mom made in NE NM where I grew up. I almost make it the same. The main difference is I brown the rice in olive oil until it just starts to turn brown. I add the rice to the rest after they began simmering. The other ingredients I've mixed and matched over time, but this is a great basic Spanish rice.

Liked very much as a side dish or a one-dish meal with pork chops. EASY TO MAKE.
The pork chops were browned in skillet and then set aside while following recipe for the rice [used same skillet for rice). Also used only half of chili powder. 
Pork chops added back into rice to simmer till done.

This was so easy.... and without instant rice.  I added small shrimp to make it a meal in a dish.  Next time I'll add slice black olives.

Turned out really good. Too spicy for my family, I'll half the chili powder next time. I used chicken broth after reading other reviews and added garlic but 4 stars because it was on the mushy side.

I used chicken stock instead of water, 1 tsp of chili powder and 1/2 tsp cumin.  It tasted great.  This recipe is good only for 3-4 people.

Very good.  I even used instant rice instead of regular long grain.  Worked great.  Just be sure you have "an eye for an eye" of liquid to rice ratio.  I mention this as I increased the amount to 2 cups rice and I used 2 cups chicken broth (made with  bouillon cubes) instead of water.  Otherwise, exactly the same.  DELICIOUS!

Been using this recipe for a reference for a while now! I made some changes others suggested. I used low sodium chicken broth instead of water, used 1/4 cup of tomato sauce instead diced tomatoes and green chilies (turns out less soggy), added some minced garlic, added 1 tsp or less of cumin, and a dash of cayenne for extra spice. I sometimes use a few dashes of onion powder or garlic powder and chop up a bit of jalapeno to throw in with the onions and rice. Yum!

This is an excellent Spanish rice recipe, and can be served alongside many main dishes. The first time I made as directed, subsequently I have added a bit more heat and cilantro.

I liked it the way it was written but to make it more a meal for Hubby I added 1lb cooked and drained ground beef. Also no salt boulion to the water. And some garlic powder and cumin.

I made this recipe to add to the Mexican Rice and Beef taco recipe .  The rice by itself was really good and then added to the taco recipe was fabulous!  I have never made tacos with rice before so this was a different take on an already favorite in our house.  The only change I made was using brown rice instead of white.  I had some of the beef mixture just by itself the next day with a little cheese melted on it and it was just as good.

So i made this twice. the first time it was mushy like some of the other lower reviews have said. The second time i made it, i browned the rice longer, and it turned out fine. I also used a can of DRAINED Rotelle instead of plain tomatoes. turned out excellent as a side to my homemade Chili Relleno's.

I have made this two times.  Once as the recipe calls for and once without all the chile powder.  If you use rotel which has all the chile peppers in it, two teaspoons of chile powder is way to my for my family.  You can always add, you can't take away.  This recipe is a keeper, just a little to spicy as written for my family.  I also used bacon grease left over from 4 pieces of chopped bacon to saute the onions and peppers.   Enjoy!

This was my first take at making homemade spanish rice, and I have to say I loved it.  I first read some of the other reviews, and added a tad of red pepper flakes, paprika, garlic, cumin and 1 pepperoncini, and this dish had plenty of flavor.  Thank you.

I made this recipe a few times now and it's one I found that my grandparents also liked. Since I have someone who don't like rice very much I was happy to see he likes this one. I will make this again and again

Been making this a long time, I use bacon grease, chicken broth, regular canned tomatoes, and chop up some of the bacon to put in it.
I add the chili powder last to taste,  I don't add green chiles , hot peppers or cilantro , some of the veg's or spices in Mexican food I just don't care for. A few times I used some tomato juice  or tomato sauce when I was low on canned tomatoes or I add both canned tomatoes and tomato sauce to taste.

This was a last minute decision and I actually had a can of diced green Chile's in the pantry along with the tomatoes and a bell pepper in the fridge. It was sooooooo good, everyone loved it.

This was really good and so much better than making it out of a box. I made it to go with some Carnitas. The whole house loved it. My only mistake was not making more. Definitely will make this again.

Very bland, no color, flat tasting and I added cumin like many others suggested and used chicken broth instead of water too.  Much too spicy for us even with the mild Rotel tomatoes and half the chili pepper.  Use the recipe Best Spanish Rice, add more onion than recipe  calls for and  add a whole diced up green pepper.  This recipe is just as easy and outstanding because it uses a cup of chunky salsa instead of the canned tomatoes.  I will stay with my Best Spanish Rice recipe.

This is the recipe I have always used, although the rice and water are the only two ingredients I ever measure precisely.  My family always seem to enjoy it - never any leftovers and never any complaints!  Sometimes I serve this as a main dish, adding crumbled bacon to the casserole during the last few minutes.  In such instances, I transfer the rice to an oven-proof baking dish after the rice is fully cooked, sprinkle 8 oz. of shredded Colby-Jack or cheddar cheese over the rice, and bake it at 350 degrees for 15 minutes to melt the cheese.   I serve it with a tossed salad or guacamole and chips.

Made this for a birthday celebration, and it was delicious. Doubled the recipe since we were having lots of people for party. It took longer to cook than stated in recipe, about 40 minutes.Only change made was using chicken stock in place of water. Everyone at the party loved it. Will definitely make again.

It's amazing. I thought that I could omit the chili pepper and make it not spicy since my wife doesn't like spicy but most of the spice comes from the tomatoes/chili pepper can, so fair warning. I think it's amazing, especially batch number two with chili pepper included just for lunches for me. Just make sure you fry the rice long enough, it's better if the rice is turning noticeably brown without burning. I didn't fry the rice enough the first time, and while it was good it was 4.5 stars rather than 5. Attempt 2 was a 5.

Delicious. I took others suggestions. I substituted veg stock for the water. I added two cloves of garlic at the end of sautéing so they wouldn't burn. Added 4 fresh jalapeno slices for extra heat and about 1/8 teaspoon of cumin. Cooked for exactly 30 minutes without taking the lid off. Yum!!

This will be a staple food when I make Mexican/Southwestern. I didn't have chili powder, so I used 3/4 a teaspoon of cumin instead. I felt the can of tomatoes was too much, (almost equal amounts of tomatoes and rice) so next time I will try a small can of tomato sauce.

As is, it is bland. I make this rice all the time but using my modifications. Add CUMIN, CHILI POWDER, GARLIC and PEPPER! Also, toss in a bouillon cube or use broth instead of water. It is so, so, so good like this!

I will never again make the boxed variety of this dish.  This recipe was great!  I did read the reviews before making it and made 2 changes as other reviewers had mentioned.  I used chicken broth instead of the water and only 1.5 cups of it.  I reduced the chili powder to 1 tsp and added 1 tsp ground cumin and also added some minced garlic.  Next time, I will bump up the chili powder though.  It will be a make again and again dish here.

For some reason I thought making Spanish Rice was a fine art only possible in a commercial kitchen or prepared by a true Mexican cook.  But alas even I could make great tasting Spanish Rice with this easy recipe!

I agree that this could be wonderful if prepared per the review Jodi Lynn put on here.  It is okay as listed but it is excellent when the additional spicing is added, as she suggested.

I'll never use the box stuff again!  I did an experiment last night:  we bought tamales at costco and I thought I'd try this recipe as a side dish and not tell anyone.  When everyone sat down to dinner, they all loved the rice, and I revealed that I made it from scratch.  Like a lot of other people, the only change I made was to use chicken broth instead of water.  Other than that, this recipe is perfect just the way it is, and it's just as easy to make as the stuff from the box.  I'm adding this to my recipe book and will make it again and again.  Thank you!

This recipe, with some minor changes mostly suggested by other reviewers, is fantastic!  Some additional changes I made were: used olive oil instead of vegetable oil, used 2 stalks of celery thinly cut (since I didn't have onion), 1/2 tspn onion powder, 2 cups of chicken broth, and red bell pepper instead of green bell pepper.  Also, I used 1/2 tbsp of chili powder since spicy food makes me queasy even though I love spicy food!  Sadly, this was a little spicy for me, but I still loved it, as did my hubby!  Will definitely make this again (with maybe a not as spicy version for myself).  Thanks for sharing!

Yum-o! Both my hubs and I REALLY enjoyed this - a LOT!!! Although I prefer another recipe *slightly* better, this one will definitely be added to my regular rotation (it's nice to have a couple "go to" recipes to keep things interesting lol!). As with most new recipes I try, I made a couple of (minor) changes to suit my tastes. Because I had it, I subbed chicken broth for the water called for. I also added a clove of (minced) garlic and a 1/2 t ground cumin to my rice. This was a PERFECT side dish to serve alongside our chicken fajitas. Leftovers will make a delicious burrito filling (when combined with my remaining fajita meat)! Thanks for sharing your recipe, John! I will be making this OFTEN for sure! :-)

This is a decent recipe. I knew the chicken broth would help add depth to the flavor, but decided to make it according to the recipe with water so I could judge it fairly and to keep the sodium content low. Next time I will use the chicken broth. I will also use bacon grease instead of oil and add minced garlic and a larger can of tomatoes. I love lots of tomatoes in Spanish rice! With some tweaks, this will be a regular at my house.

This is the perfect Spanish rice, and so easy! I make it pretty much as written, which is unusual for me. :) I saute the onion and bell pepper for a few minutes before I saute the rice, and use mild canned tomatoes and chilis. I've also tried using celery intead of bell pepper - it's very good that way too.

It was tasty, but there are some changes needed, in my opinion. I used chicken broth in stead of water and I would only use half an onion next time. I also think it still needs some more spices. Next time I'm thinking about adding some garlic and cumin. There is room for improvement, but I think it is a great start.

This was really good, very fresh tasting and all that, but a bit spicy for me.  I'd still make it again, maybe using a can of plain tomatoes though.  Thanks!

My husband usually leaves half of his rice on his plate, but when I made this he ate it all and asked for a second helping of just the rice! I had to add a tiny bit more water towards the end of the cooking time, but it fluffed up nice in the end. Thank you!

This was the best Spanish rice I have tried so far. My husband is Hispanic and he normally does not like Spanish rice and he said this was better than his mom's rice. I used broth instead of water as other reviewers suggested.

I used brown rice and organic chicken broth in place of the plain water. Because I used brown rice, I did adjust the liquid accordingly. I don't ordinarily have Ro-Tel on hand, so I used a can of fire roasted tomatoes and half a 4 oz. can of mild green chilies. I only used a teaspoon of ground california chili pepper (you get the same flavor without the heat of normal ground chili powder), because I'm feeding two kids. I didn't need the extra salt. My family thought this was pretty tasty and didn't seem to notice I used brown rice, which is a thumbs up for me. Next time, I'll add garlic. I was in a hurry, so I didn't think of it until after the fact.

So good! I added about a 1 tsp of cumin because I had it on hand. I also used a red bell pepper instead of green because I think they taste better.

I made this dish with enchiladas, and it was a huge hit! I've used other spanish rice recipes that either weren't very good or were too much work to be practical. This one was both tasty and easy! I'll be using this recipe for a long time!

I made this last night and I have to say I was disappointed.  In my opinion, it doesn't have much flavor and definitely needs more spices.  I don't think I'll make this one again.

Add chicken stock in place of water for a better taste, but without it's still pretty good. And not to mention much healthier.

I took other reviewer's advice and added 3 gloves of minced garlic and at least 2 tsp of cumin.  I am Asian so did not want to use the white rice I had on hand so I used all brown rice.  Didn't have chicken stock or green pepper on hand.  Used Roti Hot tomatoes.  The first night I cooked this, it was very mushy and yes, a still bit bland.  However, as leftovers the next day, it was MUCH better!! 3 stars due to all the changes needed, but I will make it again with the substitution of chicken stock.

This was very good.  My favorite Spanish rice is oven-baked rice made by my late Grandmother.  This is probably the closest to it...and it's not even baked in the oven.

This is my 'go to' recipe for Spanish rice. The only changes I make are to use chicken broth/stock instead of water and I also add a bit of cumin. Delicious.

this came out so great and to make it even easier i used instant rice. However if you are feeding little ones you might want to substitute the tomatoes with chilis with plain old tomatoes.

Delicious. I followed the advice of other reviewers and made a few alterations. I used bacon grease instead of vegetable oil. I also omitted the water and used chicken broth. I added 2 cloves of minced garlic and 1/2 teaspoon ground cumin.

i made this rice last night and it turned out amazing!! i doubled the recipe. i did change a few things. instead of veg. oil, i used 2 tbsp of bacon grease and instead of the water, i used chicken stock. between the bacon grease adn chicken stock, it really brought out the flavor. also, i used a can of just diced tomatoes i had in the pantry. i still used the tomatoes and chili's but since i decided to double the recipe at the last minute, i only had one can. and i added some garlic powder.over all a great recipe, im sure it would of been great even if i didnt make my own additions

This recipe was a hit. The only thing that I will change next time is to cut back on some of the h2o, as I felt that the rice was a little too mushy. However, I also left out the onion, so ymmv.

mMmm..I just got done eating this and it was so good. I didn't have any bell peppers so I left that out. Also, I just had a can of plain diced tomatoes so I used that. It turned out delicious. The only reason why I didn't give it 5 stars is because the BEST spanish rice I've ever had was from my old boss..he makes it every year for cinco de mayo!!!!

This is very similar to a recipe my mom has made for years. The only differences are that she doesn't brown her rice, and she always adds ground beef- sometimes with the addition of sausage. Also, she usually doubles or triples the recipe, as this is one of my family's favorite meals. She makes a huge pot and we all eat the leftovers for a day or two. I like adding grated cheddar cheese to mine. Delish.

Thanks for the recipe!  My husband and I loved it. Little too spicy for my kiddos.  Next time I think I will use mild salsa in place of the diced tomatoes and green chiles.  I even mixed in some shredded mild cheddar cheese after I was done cooking it.  Love Love Love it!!

We made this for a Cinco de Mayo party with 25 people and there was not a piece of rice left on anyone's plate. We substituted Rotel for the tomatoes and used chicken broth instead of water.  An excellent recipe!!

Simple, but yummy dish. Using low-sodium chicken stock made it even better, as well as the advice of other members to use some cumin.

Pretty good. I made as is, and probably should have read some of the reviews beforehand and used chicken stock as opposed to water for extra flavor.  Next time I'll also add a jalapeno.

This was excellent. I took the advice of some previous reviews and replaced half of the chili powder with cumin.  The flavors and texture were like being in an authentic Mexican restaurant.  This one's a keeper!

Never made Spanish Rice before but thought I would try it with the Easy Chicken Enchiladas from this site.  I thought it was great, used a few suggestions from the other reviewers but not the bacon thing.  Too much work for me and too much clean up.  Turned out great.  Thanks

I thought that this was restaurant quality! The difference is I omited the bell pepper and used ck broth instead of water. I made it ahead of time and reheated it. It was even better reheated as the rice had time to firm up. I found it to be a mushy consisteny when it first finishes cooking.

This had great flavor. I used a can of roasted tomatoes and that was a great substitution. Also used vegetable stock instead of water. However, I used brown rice and I don't think that was a good idea. It turned out mushy even though I didn't over cook the rice (the grains themselves still had a nice "chew" the way brown rice is supposed to have). Since that mushy texture is probably my fault by using brown rice I'm not considering that in my rating. I'll try again with a different rice. I also want to try making it in a rice cooker, that may give a better texture.

This recipe is a great base then I used all of the sugestions that Jodi Lyn gave. I cooked the onions and bell pepper first with some fresh garlic, I used chicken broth instead of water,  1/2 tsp of cumin, and at the end I stired in some fresh chopped cilantro. It turned out really good, we couldn't stop going back for more!!!

This recipe was really tasty and full of flavor. The only alteration i made was to use chicken broth instead of water. The rest was exact to the original recipe and it turned out great.

LOVE this rice!  I use an entire green pepper and I also throw in a chopped jalapeno pepper and use chicken broth instead of plain water. I've already made this at least 5 times since finding the recipe.  It's one of my favorites!

I never dreamed this would taste so amazing.  I just couldn't stop eating it.  I did use chicken stock, per other suggestions and 1/4 tsp. cumin as well, but wonder if it would taste just as good with water and no cumin.  If so, it'd be cheaper and healthier?

"Great!" I feel bad for spending 2 much $ @ a local Mexican store on buying their already prepared Spanish rice. I'm going to stick to the recommended oil amount this time because it was a little oily (i used more than recommended last time). Also, I didn't use the chili/diced tomato can, instead, I used garlic and Italian seasoned diced tomatoes as well as poured on the garlic powder. Yummy - I'm walking to the kitchen just now to make this Spanish rice two days in a row.

It was good and I'd make it again.  I wanted something similar to ricearoni.  I added some cheddar cheese into it and it gave it a creamy consistency.

I doubled the recipe and used salsa instead of the canned tomato/chili because that's what I had on hand.  It was good, maybe a bit bland, but then again you don't want a side dish to compete with the main dish.  I will make this again.

This is the first rice recipe that I have ever made that everyone absolutely loved.  This is very easy to make, and the only change I made was I substituted sodium free, fat free chicken broth for the water. I will make this one again and again!

We enjoyed this recipe, although 30 minutes was too long to cook it because it burned on the edges.  Next time I'll check it after 20 minutes.  I didn't have Rotel tomatoes with chilis, so I substituted a can of diced tomatoes for the Rotel and a cup of water.  If I'd used the extra cup of water, it might have been too mushy (or it might not have burned......hmm).

This comes very close to the rice served in my favorite neighborhood Mexican restaurant.  Frying the rice before adding the liquid is an important step that leads to a "dry" no-sticky rice, just the way I like it.

Good recipe. I modified a bit by adding some lean ground beef for my boyfriend. I started my browning the beef then added about a half of an onion and a green pepper (both chopped) as well as the can or rotel tomatoes and chiles. After letting that cook through for 5 mins or so I added the rice and sauted everything for another 5-10 mins then added 2 cups chicken broth. I was worried the beef would be bad after being in liquid but it tasted great. I had to add more liquid for the basmati rice I used. I added the seasoning to taste along the way. Also added some shredded cheese on individual servings. Thanks for the great recipe!

I thought this was very easy.  It didn't have as much flavor as I was expecting...but, maybe I just didn't add enough chili powder.  I made it to go with Bob's Mexican Stuffed Chicken (from this website) and they went together perfectly.  I will definitely be making this again.

This was so easy! We usually use the boxed Spanish rice, but this was nearly as easy to fix and tasted a whole lot better. I followed the suggestions to use chicken broth instead of water and add 1/2 tsp cumin (we like it). If your local grocery carries "chopped seasoning mix" (diced onion, bell pepper, celery, garlic and parsley), you can use that instead of the onion & bell pepper, making this recipe even more of a snap.

Excellente! Hint - if you rinse the rice before sauteing, it will stay moist and will not get crusty. I used others' suggestions and sub'd bacon grease for the oil, and used low-salt chicken broth instead of water. Didn't have the tomato/green chili tomatoes so just used regular diced tomatoes.  Also added about 1/2 t. cumin, and reduced chili powder to 1 t.

This rice is so good!  I usually just make rice from a mix to serve with tacos, fajitas, etc.  I decided to try it from scratch this time and it turned out great, so much better than the mixes, and even better than what you get at a restaurant!  I added 1 clove garlic, minced, and 1/2 tsp. cumin.  You won't be disappointed with this recipe!

I have made this a couple of times now.  The first time I made it I followed the recipe and it was perfect.  The second time I made it without the green pepper because I didn't have any.  It was good either way.  Thanks for a great recipe

This rice was delicious and I will make it many more times. Also, I could not find the right size tomato and chili can, so I bought the 14 oz can. I added the whole thing and the rice still cooked perfectly. I made this to go with the Viva Madrid Spanish Chicken - absolutely delicious!

This turned out pretty good. I followed the recipe exactly except I left out the bell pepper. I liked it, but I think it should be a little more spicy. I will try adding chili paste next time. Thanks!

Excellent twist on white Rice! Be careful not to toast the rice too quickly or it will brown. Great flavors paired with salsa chicken shredded in a tortilla with a little cheese. Definitely a keeper.

Not big on the spanish rice, but the kids enjoy it.  I loved this recipe. It was a little spicy for one of my four kids but they said it was excellent. After making this, it will be a weekly side dish at my house.

Delicious! With chicken broth rather than water, this is a 5-star recipe. And if you'd like a little extra kick but are lazy like me, use a can of diced tomatoes and jalapenos (rather than tomatoes and green chiles). With the addition of the chicken broth and jalapenos, you can leave out the salt altogether.

Easy. I thought it was too spicy for me, but didn't think that was a reason to down it a star.  I think next time I will just use a plain can of tomatoes, and a can of mild diced chiles that I know won't be too spicy for me.

Wow! I was a little worried about this one...frying uncooked rice?? But this recipe was SO easy and is an instant fav of mine.  I used 2 diced tomatoes instead of the canned stuff, and added some chicken granules since i didn't have any broth on hand.  I'm making this anytime we have mexican food.

Followed the recipe, except I used a jar of hot salsa instead of the diced tomatoes.  It turned out deliciously spicy.  Next time I'll throw some seafood in there.

Absolutely fantastic. I followed suit and used chicken broth instead of water and used half of the chili powder, but used 2 tsp of green chilies. I also added black beans. It was perfect, especially when accompanied by something light and fresh like the Mexican Baked Fish.

This was an awesome recipe. I used chicken broth instead of water as others had previously mentioned. I also added red & yellow sweet peppers and 1/4 of a jalapeno pepper. Instead of regular chili powder I used the chipotle chili powder from Epicure selections.  Ithad a nice kick to it when cooked. My husband is not a rice eater but he had 2 helpings of this.

This was not good.  All we could taste was the heat!  I even cut back on the chili powder.  Won't be making this again.

This is really simple to make and came out great.  I didn't have chili powder (don't like it) so I sub ground red cayenne pepper to taste.  You really have to watch your pan during the browning phase but no worries.

I'm sure it was my fault that I used Japanese rice because it turned out really mushy. But the flavour was good.

Added some red bell pepper and a can of tomato paste (because I had some of both on hand that I wanted to use up), and added a can of corn. I really expected this to be kind of bland but it was SO GOOD. Hubby and I scarfed it right down. Will make again and again!!

This was an awesome recipe!  After being let down by another rice recipe on this site, I was so pleased with this one.  I substituted chicken broth for the water and added a 1/2 tsp cumin.  If you don't like spicy, you might want to cut back on the chili powder a bit.  So flavorful!

Amazing recipe!  I would give it five stars, but I did make some changes that I think really enhanced the flavor.  As other reviewers have noted, adding garlic and cooking the rice in chicken broth were great revisions.  I also cut the chili powder in half, and used 1 1/2 c. rice to 3 c. broth.  I think the flavor would have been a bit strong otherwise.  Overall, this recipe had an authentic flavor and my husband voted this one a "keeper"!  Thanks!

When I've had authentic Spanish rice in the past, it has been bland and rather tasteless, but this was not either of those! The flavors were subtle but definitely there and yummy! I did add garlic, chicken broth instead of water, and about a teaspoon of cumin as one person suggested. Turned out great! My 5 yr old daughter ate a heaping serving of it too (we had this with shredded beef tacos:)

Very good. I didn't have all the exact ingredients on hand,so I used brown rice, canned tomatoes( no chilis) & chicken broth instead of water.

This was pretty good - the chili powder provides a definite kick, but there's not really any complexity of flavors here - really all you taste is chili powder.  As another reviewer suggested, I would substitute a can of green chilis for the green pepper.  I also would cut the chili powder in half and add some fresh cilantro at the end.

My husband and I loved it! The only changes I made was instead of adding canned tomatoes I strained 15oz of Hot Salsa through a fine metal strainer to removed the excess liquid. I also used 1 tsp cayenne pepper and a dash of cumin to give it more flavor. If you love heat, this is the way to go!

This was my first time making spanish rice and this recipe delivered.  It was very easy to make and it tasted delicious.  I did not have any chili powder so I used taco seasoning instead and it was very flavorful.  Even my picky boyfriend liked it.  I will definitely make this again.  Thanks John Mac.

Good rice. Nice level of spice. I did make a few last minute additions after I read a review that said they also sauteed garlic with the onions and green peppers. Since I was already too far along I added Garlic Powder. Also added the 1/2 tsp of Cumin as recommended and some parsley flakes. I will try with the chicken broth next time, but will definitely make again. Much better than the store bought stuff! I gave it a 5 because my children all liked it, including my super picky-won't eat any vegies son, and my one daughter said she'd give it 10,000 thumbs up if she had that many. I personally would have given it maybe a 4-4 1/2. It will be tweaked a little next time...probably the chicken broth to see if it's a 5 for me.

This recipe was delicious, the cooking method was very similar to Spanish paella - but the flavors are Mexican.  My only complaint is that the dish took quite a bit more time than the recipe called for.

This recipe is VERY easy and tastes great. The leftovers were awesome the second day as well. Next time I make it I will cut the oil down a bit b/c it was a tad greasy. Other then that I will make this again!!!

This recipe was exactly what I was looking for.  I have made it twice so far and each time my husband has said it's better than our favorite Mexican resturant.  I do make one change and use chicken broth instead of water to add more flavor.

The best!  I hate boxed spanish rice and this has been the best so far.  I cook the onions, green pepper and add garlic first then I brown the rice.  I use the chicken stock from the box for more flavor!  Added a tad more chili powder & some cumin.  I doubled the recipe because I have a large family!

Very good! I added two cloves of garlic and bumped up the amount of chili powder to one tbsp, and the family loved it. It also turned out well by adding 1lb cooked ground beef(for when the gang is extra hungry!)

Yum! Why buy prepackaged rice mixes when making this is so much better and really not that much more work? Definitely add the garlic & cumin and broth.  The only suggestion I have is not to double the recipe in the same pot -- mine came out a bit gluey in some parts; dryer rice grains in others, even with a stir near the end. Original quantities make a sizeable pot anyway.

This was delicious!!  Even my 3 year old ate it up - and he's hard to please!  I followed the recipe exactly.  Would be even better with some green olives.  We topped it with Black Beans and a side salad.  Will definitely make again!!!

I found this recipe a little dry and missing a true spanish rice flavor.  I would try adding a can of tomato sauce and possibly a can of green chiles. It's lacking something.

I'll be making this more often.  It was really easy to make and tastes fantastic.  I had to use more water than the recipe called for though.  I used about 3 cups instead of 2.  Turned out great!

Very Good recipe.  I used chicken broth rather than plain water and I added garlic.  I also used a can of tomato sause (but it came out really sticky)...My 11 year old and 7 year old loved it!

Very good.  My 7 year old son has been my advisor on the ratings.  It was almost too spicy for him, but he decided it still deserves all 5 stars.  I agree.  I omitted the green pepper and substituted broth for the water, but measured slightly under the 2 cups to adjust for the liquid in the tomatoes.  However, my 6 year old did not prefer it at all.

This rice was so good.  Better than I expected.  My husband loved it and he is not a fan of rice.  I omitted the bell peppers for personal taste preferences, I used chicken broth instead of water, I used chili powder and cumin, cooked onions and garlic before rice, then added onions back to sauteed rice.  I used the Rotel tomatoes and green chiles which made the rice pretty spicy, which I loved.  It did have chunky tomatoes so the kids didnt even try it.  It may have been too spicy for them even if they had tried it.  I will definitely make this again!

This went over VERY big at our house.    I did make some changes.  I used the basmati rice that I had on hand.  For my double recipe I used 1/4 c. dehydrated red bell pepper instead of green pepper.   I'm not much on chunky tomato so I used (2) 8 oz. cans of no-salt plain tomato sauce, a can of chopped green chilis and a dash of chipotle powder. I used jarred chicken base with the water plus a little additional water.  I also used the hints that Jodi Lynn kindly provided, except for the garlic and parsley.  I cooked about half a package of turkey bacon for the grease (put away the cooked turkey bacon for the next day's use) and then used oil to make up the difference.  Served it up on flour tortillas along with some refried beans, sour cream, ground turkey cooked with fajita spice and then Eagle Brand Creamy Lemon Pie (from this site) for dessert.  He has talked about that rice constantly since I made it last week and has been asking for me to make it again so I'm making it tonight.  It's going into my regular rotation, needless to say, LOL.  Thank you for posting this recipe.

Mmmmmm this was a hit in our house. I served this with tacos.  I did however substitute it a bit.  I fried 6 slices of bacon and used the bacon fat instead of oil.  I also used a can of Aylmer spicy red pepper tomatoes and skipped the chilli powder.  My husband wanted it again in 2 days a great hit.  Thank you for this posting.

Wow!  So easy to prepare and the kids loved it!  They only change I made was that I used a can of stewed tomatoes, which I chopped, since that was all I had.

I've been searching and searching for a spanish rice recipe, and this was wonderful.  It definitely wasn't spicy, but had a great flavor and texture.  Per suggestions by other reviewers, I substituted the water for chicken broth.  Thanks!

I would give it 3.5 stars if I could as it's better the next day.  Despite the tomatoes, chili powder, onions, etc this rice lacks flavour. I can see how the addition of cumin, parsley and chicken stock may lift this recipe to five stars.  I'll try that next time!

Love it... I followed the advice of another reviewer or two and used chicken broth instead of water.  I also added about 1 tsp cumin and 1/2 tsp of parsley.  I made it for a big party (quadrupled the recipe) and it was all gone!  This will be my go to rice recipe from now on!

This was perfect for a girl who doesn't *really* know what spanish rice tastes like!  Added 1/2 t cumin and sub chix broth as others suggested. Perfect side with tacos and refined beans.  I do like it saucier so I may add can of tomato sauce and decrease chicken broth (not water!) by 1/4 c.  Delish!

Super good!!! I did what Jodi Lynn suggested and added garlic and cumin.  I probably will use less chili powder next time since the rice was spicier than what I expected.   Overall, very good and thank you Jodi Lynn for your suggestions!

This was good.  We followed the recipe and it was done a few minutes early.  But holy  the chilies made it spicy!  I think I'd pull out half of the chilies from the tomatoes and lessen the chili powder.  Went well with tacos.

I made this the other nite and it was okay. I still gave it 4 stars because I'm sure the taste varies depending on which salsa you use.

I am addicted to this rice! My husband, who usually doesn't like spanish rice, even raved about this. I make just like the recipe and wouldn't change a thing. Thank you for a wonderful recipe!

Delicious.  I added the jalapenos, as other commenters have suggested, and it added that extra kick.

This is so much tastier than any box mix! I left out the salt, added 1/2 tsp. of cumin, 2 tbspn. cilantro, 2 cloves of garlic, and a can of black beans. I also subbed chicken stock for water.

I made this rice tonight for my Cinco de Mayo dinner.  I changed a few things though.  I used a chicken base and added it to the water (about 2 teaspoos), and used another suggestion that I had read and cut out 1/2 cup of the water and replaced it with tomato sauce.  I didn't have any green pepper, but I did have frozen sofrito so I added about 1/2 cup after I added the liquid to the pot.  I also had cilantro base and added about 2 tblspoons.  I added 1/2 teaspoon of cumin and 1/2 tsp of adobo instead of the chili powder and I omited the salt.  I cooked it all in a large sauce pan instead of a skillet and simmered it with the cover on for 15 minutes (never removing the cover) and then shut off the heat and let it sit (still never removing the cover) for 15 more minutes.  There was a little burn on the bottom but I was told from an authentic mexican cook that this should happen.  It was the best flavored rice I have ever had!  I will definately be making it again and again.

Made it with 3 small garlic cloves, chicken broth instead of water, and added a dash of cumin.  Used Diced tomatoes with red chilis (for salsa).

I made this to go with the Slow Cooker Carnitas, and it tasted great! I, of course, had to modify to use ingredients on hand, so here's what I did: I used 1/2 a can of diced tomatoes--no chilis. I subbed chicken broth for water, but was short on broth, so I used the liquid from the canned tomatoes. I also used orange pepper instead of green, and shallots instead of onion. Lastly, the rice... I only had Jasmine rice! And, although I could tell it was jasmine, it still tasted good in this dish. This satisfied my Spanish Rice craving, it was really easy to make, and I'll be making it again. Thanks!

This was pretty tasty. I skipped the onion, added 2 cloves of garlic (minced), and added a teaspoon of chicken bouillon. I added in a little cumin at the end because it seemed to be missing something. Really tasty served with a dollop of sour cream. Thanks :)

I used instant rice instead of regular. Becuase of this, I reduced the water to 1 cup. It turned out great. A little on the hot side, but great.

This was a great recipe: cheap, easy to make, and delicious.  I added smoked sausage (sauteed with the onions, rice, and peppers) to make it a full meal, and next time I will try doubling the tomatoes.

This recipe states that it makes 4 servings.  That is 4 main dish servings--at least 8 side dish servings.  This was a great side dish for tacos.  I doubled the recipe.  The other people eating this dish do not eat spicy foods. So, I used one can tomatoes with green chiles and one can diced tomatoes.  It was great.  Thank you for the recipe.

A great recipe, but 2 teaspoons of chili powder is waaaaay too much. I used half that, and it was still very spicy. Also, the reviewer who suggested adding garlic, and sauteing all the veggies before adding the rice was right. Also, I prepared this in a dutch oven. Over all, really good recipe!

This was great! I used brown minute rice cooked in the microwave with chicken broth.  I then followed the recuipe and cooked the rice and other ingredient in the pan.  I added some cayenne and cumin to taste.

Very good and easy spanish rice recipe.  Used the Mexican style diced tomatoes and chilies which added a great layer of flavor.  Will definitely make again.

I only used 1 tsp of chili powder because 1 year old and 4 year old are eating too. Also, I used a dash of salt and reserved 1 cup chicken juice from a can from the Chicken Enchiladas II recipe and 1 cup regular water.

This is a good recipe for some easy comfort food. I made the mistake of using cooked rice (whoops!), but, it still turned out well. Haven't had Spanish rice in years because I didn't really quite understand how it was made. I'll be making this often now.

I felt that there was a bit too much water and the rice came out quite soft.  I'm used to my Spanish rice being a bit firmer.  I used paprika instead of the chili spice (didn't have any on head).  The flavour seemed to be missing something (could've been the true chili spice)...Overall a really nice rice though, that I will definitely make again!

My family loves this. I actually triple the recipe with the following changes: I use 2 red sweet peppers, 1 1/2 onions, I add garlic, cumin and a can of drained whole kernal corn along with an extra can of mild green chiles. I also cook up some ground sausage and sautee the onions and peppers with it. We serve it with nacho cheese, sour cream and tortilla chips. Yum!

Great recipe but I like to use a packet of taco seasonings in place of the spices listed, chicken broth instead of water and a cup of canned or mixed vegetables with the onion.  Then it is great!

Terrific rice.  I did add 1 tsp minced garlic and 1/2 tsp of cumin just because I like those flavors but I'm sure it would be tasty as is.  I served the rice steaming hot sprinkled with a few minced green onions and sliced black olives.

Great way to change up rice! I did shy away from the green chiles and used a little chopped green bell pepper instead. I think you could put a lot of different vegetables in this dish. Easy and delicious.

Solid recipe, you can't really go wrong with Spanish rice imo! Though I don't know if the extra step of cutting onions and bell pepper was entirely worth it, using plain old salsa has the same effect for me. Try "Linnie's Spanish Rice" if you are feeling lazy.

I made a few changes and it turned out to be awesome!  Instead of tomatoes w/chiles, I used tomatoes w/green pepper and onion in them, added 1 tsp. canned jalepeno peppers and 2 tsp. chicken boullion paste.  I also make it w/brown rice to make it a little healthier.

I also used chicken broth instead of water to give the rice a little more flavor. I didn't use can tomatoes nor can chilies, I substituted with fresh tomatoes and fresh Anaheim chilies. I think that is why the rice came out fluffy. This is a keeper for my family.

This recipe came out pretty good. Im picky when it comes to spanish rice. Ive had better and ive had alot worse but I will make this one again. I added a couple cloves of minced garlic with the sautéing  onions (i didn't use bell peppers because I didn't have any on hand). Also, I used a can of diced tomatoes (plain) instead of tomatoes with chilis. This rice was served with shredded mexican style beef (crock pot) and black beans for some tasty burritos!

This is great and so much better than boxed rice.  The tomatoes w/ chilies make it very spicy - I try to find mild rather than hot in the store.  It is really easy and my 4 1/2 year old will eat tons of it.

The rice is infused with flavor.  I used about 1/3 of the onion called for and it seemed like plenty to me.  Next time I will cut down on the chili powder to get it to more of a medium heat.  It was pretty hot for a crowd including children with the amount of chili powder called for.

Very easy to make, and tasty despite my doubling the rice and forgetting to double the canned tomatoes. I did use chicken broth in place of water. Will have to make it again, properly, next time :)

Very good. Not greasy at all. You can adjust the level of spicy to suit your taste by increasing/decreasing the chili powder.

As written, this recipe is good. With a few modifications, this recipe is great! We added some cumin, jalapenos, and substituted chicken broth. I am throwing away all of my other Spanish Rice recipes.

I tried this with brown rice and I was pretty disappointed.  It wasn’t as flavorful as I thought it would be.  I'll try to make this again and use the recommended rice.  Maybe I’ll get a better outcome.

Very good basic recipe!!!  I used 1/2 bacon grease & 1/2 olive oil and beef broth for cooking--if you use canned broth--omit the salt.  I also used 1 tsp. mild chili powder and 1 tsp. regular chili powder--this will give the dish full flavor without so much heat.  When I warmed it up, I sauteed some green onions to include & heated in the microwave with cheese on top--just to change it up for leftovers.

Very easy yet has the flavor that i was looking for in a Spanish rice recipe. It is a bit on the basic side so i spiced it up with some additional ingredients.

This is a wonderful recipe. The onion and bell pepper I chopped in my food processor so they would not be in such large chunks. I used rotel (original) and put the chili pepper, it gave it some heat. Everyone loved it and I will make this again. Thank you.

Followed recipe to the letter, and agree - this is the BEST spanish rice I have yet to make - the extra vegetable ingredients made all the difference in the world.

This was pretty good.  I was out of bell pepper and veg. oil so I used butter and just left out the bell pepper all together.  I also just did the seasonings to taste because my husband cannot eat real spicy foods.

I made some modifications to this recipe, primarily based on Jodi Lynn's review: I added garlic to the onions and green pepper, then sauteed them all before adding this rice, and also added chicken bouillon to the water and cumin to the seasoning.  Also, I did not have tomatoes with chilies, only plain, so I added about 1/8 tsp. cayenne to make up for some of the lost heat.  I believe everything else was as written.  I served it to my husband and a guest, and they were surprised it was completely from scratch and said they wouldn't change a thing from the way I had made it. :)

I really loved this recipe :)  I couldnt stop digging into the rice as if it were the main dish.  I am not a huge rice fan but love spanish rice and this was excellent in taste.  The only substitute that I made was I used a can of plain petite diced tomatoes and added about 1 TSP of diced jalepenos (the ones from a jar)' instead of the tomatoes with chiles.  Thank you for sharing this recipe.  This is going into my favorites folder.

GREAT basic recipe for Spanish rice- and easy.  I cooked as recipe directs but then decided to add about another 1.5 tsp salt and 1 tsp garlic powder.

Very good!!! VERY Authentic!!! Keep a close watch on the rice while it is browning- it can and will burn very quickly if you dont!!! I also used chicken broth instead of water and salsa instead of canned tomatoes for some added flavor!!! Highly recommended! I left mine on medium heat, covered, and simmered for exactly 30 min. PERFECT!!

Great recipe!  I'm not a mexican rice eater and I'm hispanic so I've never really made it.  Had a gathering at my home for a mexican meal and thought I would try this out.  I too used the chicken stock in place of water as some folks suggested and this came out delicious.  I also added about 1/4 to 1/2 tsp. of cumin.  Thank you!

This recipe was okay.  I did use chicken broth instead of the water.  Then I tasted it before serving it and it was pretty bland.  I ended up adding about 1/2 tsp of cumin to help.  It tasted better after that, but otherwise would have been kind of bland.

I'm so glad that I found this recipe! I can finally stop using the boxed Spanish Rice. I did use chicken broth instead of water, and also added some minced garlic and a bit of ground cumin.

This is truly excellent.  First, I fry a few cut up slices of bacon, set aside, and then use some of the grease to sautee the pepper, onion, and of course, garlic.  I sub chickem broth for H2O, and add a little cumin.  I usually end uonly cooking the rice 19-20 minutes.  I do not give out 5 star ratings easily, and this is truly a 5 star.

Every time I make Spanish Rice from scratch...can't seem to get the rice to be fully cooked. I hate crunchy rice. It would have been nice to taste the flavor of the rice too had it had less chili powder...don't get me wrong I LOVE spicy foods but not when it gets too hot that you can't enjoy it because they're hidden behind the spice. I think I'll try it again but with less chili powder.

Really really awesome. Only change I made is that I added tomato sauce instead of tomatoes, and I used brown rice.

It was still really awesome, I think I'm going to play around with some of the spices next time.

I wasn't all that crazy about this recipe.  I was expecting something a bit more "picante". I did use fresh tomatoes and one jalapeno pepper instead of the canned, but that didn't seem to do anything to enliven this recipe.  It was fine for a side dish, this recipe is not a keeper for me.

I was really disappointed with this.  I added some garlic, but still found it really bland.  The whole thing was left  uneaten.  I am sorry but I wouldn't make this again.  :(

this recipe tastes almost like the spanish rice you would find at the restaurants! I added 1/2 a jalepeno chilli, 2 cloves of chopped garlic, and 1 can of corn and it tasted even better!! I will definitely be using this recipe more often!

This had a nice flavor that wasn't too strong.  I wanted a milder flavor so we wouldn't be overwhelmed with flavor since the fajitas we were having were pretty spicy.  This was exactly what I was looking for.  Didn't have tomatoes with chili peppers so I added 1/2 of a  4oz can chopped jalepenos which worked great.  I did cut back the chili powder to 1 1/2 tsp. which was perfect and as other reviewers suggested I added a slight sprinkle of ground cumin and garlic powder.  Yum!  Will make agian.  Thanks for the recipe.

I always make the boxed stuff, but tried this recipe when someone told me it was easy to make. It was really pretty simple and tasted great! I got lots of compliments on it! I would be careful about the rice sticking though... stir it every so often because my stuck to the bottom of the pan a bit.

Pretty good. I used brown rice, boil-in-bag.  Boiled the rice in chicken broth then in the skillet I sauteed the onion, etc.  Added the tomatoes and then omitted the salt.  Pretty tasty.

After sauteing the rice with the onions I transferred them to a rice cooker and finished up the recipe.  I will use less chili powder next time.  Excellent!

This was delicious and easy to make.  I browned a little ground beef with the rice/onions/peppers to make it a "meal."  We left it as it was for the kids and added some hot sauce on ours to kick it up.

Never made Spanish Rice before so I followed other reviewers suggestions.  Sauteed the onions and pepper together used red) before adding the rice but couldn't seem to get the rice t to "brown!"  Maybe because I tripled the recipe due to the size of my family.  The taste was good but soggy and the rice was cooked but definitely not 'browned.'  Will try to make just one recipe next time to see if I can brown rice.  Family ate it and said it was good, but 'soggy.' Will also chop the canned diced tomatoes more next time as I thought the pieces were too big for the dish.  Thanks for the recipe.

Wonderful!  Like others, I used chicken broth, a couple of cloves of garlic, a yellow pepper, and about a teaspoon of cumin -- I had a little longer cooking time because I used brown basmati rice.

Really really good.  Too spicy for hubby but perfect to my liking.  I will only add one tsp chili pdr next time.  I also added: 1/2 tsp cumin, 1 tsp parsley, garlic, green onion and skipped the bell pepper (didn't have one on hand).

this was good, quick and easy! I only had plain canned, diced tomatoes, so I added a bit more chili powder to make up for the flavor. It was good without, but bet it would be great with the tomatoes called for in the recipe!

Jodi Lynn's review has some really good tips for this recipe. Follow them. Although I never have bacon grease around, I just use vegetable oil. I also just sprinkle in the chili powder...2 tsp is way too much. I like to copy my local Mexican restaurant and toss in a little corn and finely diced carrot when adding the tomatoes. After I turn off the eye, I top the rice with some green peas so that it steams them. My local Mex place includes a small amt of these veggies in their rice and it just makes it that much more authentic to me. My husband and I love this rice!!

I made this last night, and it was very easy and tasty.  I did saute the rice after the veggies had been in the pan a few minutes and I added 1/2 tsp cumin to the spices.
Other reviewers said to add chicken broth or bacon grease, but the extra fat is not worth it, it's good as is.

I will never buy boxed spanish rice again.  This goes great with Refried Beans Without The Refry.  Both are better than anything I have ever had in a Mexican resturant.

This was a quick and simple dish.  It was a tad bland so I kicked it up a little.  I used a small amount of cumin, some cayenne pepper, and some Goya.  I also used olive oil plus a tablespoon of butter instead of veggie oil.  I added a clove of garlic with onions and bell pepper.  I did use the water instead of broth like some suggested.  It turned out really good.  You just have to play with the spices to get it to what you like.  Thanks for this recipe.  I don't think I'll buy box spanish rice anymore!

This rice gives Mexican restaurant rice a run for its money.  This was terrific.  I did make a couple of changes.  I doubled the recipe but still only used 1 can of tomatoes w/ chilies.  Also, as another reviewer stated, sauted the onion, peppers, garlic first.  Also added 1 finely chopped jalepeno pepper and 2 Tbsp. cumin.  I used canned chicken broth instead of water.  Everyone loved it.  We served with with Chicken Enchilada Casserole II recipe here on Allrecipes.

didn't have any green pepper, so i added a couple diced pickled jalapenos. gave it quite a kick, but was sooo good with refried black beans and spinach enchiladas. i didn't add quite as much oil as called for, because i really hate the taste of oily rice, and a little pinch of cumin. a definate keeper!

i really enjoyed this recipe. i have to triple it to feed the entire family. however, i substitute the water with chicken broth and add half of the diced tomatoes and chiles that the recipe calls for.. i also throw in a 6 oz. can of tomato sauce to give it a prettier color. we never have leftovers...

Pretty good!  I made this with a cup and a half of rice, 3 cups of water (didn't have chicken stock), a whole green pepper, two sweet onions, and fresh parsley and garlic.  Also used a 14.5 oz can of diced tomatoes and a small can of chilis, which I diced.  Added cumin, paprika, salt and a bit of pepper.  I put cheddar cheese on top (partly for my 17-month olds, partly for myself!) and the whole family liked it.  I will definitely make it again.

This was pretty good. I added a jalapeno to the onion/bell pepper, and used chicken stock rather than water. This still was a little bland to us, maybe I'll add some hot sauce with the chicken stock next time. Thanks.

I used olive oil infused with garlic, since it was what I had on hand.  I also used chicken broth instead of water.  It seemed a little bland, but it was tasty in a burrito.  
My family said there were too many tomatoes.  
It was very easy to make, so I wouldn't be opposed to trying it again, maybe with fresh garlic and possibly saute some carrots next time.

I really felt like this needed a lot more flavor. I would make it again but only following some of the other reviewers' suggestions.

I have tried a few Spanish (and Mexican) rices and this was the best by far. It was nice and spicy and went great with carne asada.  This will be our staple side dish for Mexican nights!

GREAT RICE! ... I'm eating it right now.

I've never made spanish rice before, but this one was really easy and very delicious. I made it exactly to recipe and it turned out great!

Easily adjustable to have more or less heat depending on your tastes.  I'll make this again next time I want rice with a little kick.

Change nothing. Add a packet of Goya's tomato with achiote, it add a geat color and more authenticity to taste.

This is the second time I made this and really like it.  I took suggestions from other reviews and cooked the green pepper and onion first.  I added garlic and jalapeno to them.  Then brown the rice.  I also used chicken broth and some cumin.  It was easy and tasty.  I served ith Quick and Easy Mexican Chicken.  I thought the rice was a little spicy but I used hot salsa with the chicken and that was way hotter than the rice.

I have made this recipe several times now, and I use the rice mixture to stuff pre softened sweet peppers so that I can have a low calorie lunch right out of the freezer. I also add two chopped jalapeno peppers for my ``hot`` tooth.

I made this rice a few days ago and for the most part I thought it was great.  However the can of Rotel I put in it made it EXTREMELY SPICY, other than that it was pretty good.

Not that this needs yet another review but it was so good, even a picky 12 year old ate it...i did not put any heat in it for her but next time i will.  I did use some suggestions from others and used bacon drippings instead of oil, used home-made chicken stock and frozen from my garden tomatoes.  Will make this often.

Thanks.

This recipe is very good. I took others advice and put 1 tsp chili powder and 1 tsp cumin and added garlic.  I didn't have bell pepper but it turned out really good.  I'll definately make this again.  Goes great with the Quick and Easy Mexican Chicken recipe from this site.

I've never made Spanish Rice that actually tasted like the kind from a restaurant, but this one did.  My husband loved it too.  I omited the bell pepper since I didn't have any, but it was still great.  It doesn't really even need them.  I also followed another reviewer's suggestion and used chicken broth instead of water.  Great idea!
Thanks for the recipe!

Very, very good. The only thing i did differently was added some Adobo seasoning and some pepper to the sauteing rice and onion. I omitted the pepper due to family's preference. I also added some frozen corn to it. I added a few dashes of hot sauce at the end because it wasn't quite spicy enough for my taste. I will definatley make this again.

Good rice.  Will make again!  My husband doesn't like "spicy rice" so I will probably cut back on the chili powder next time.  I didn't alter it much, just used boullion cubes with my water and some cumin.  Turned out out.  Company wanted recipie!

I cut back he chili powder to 1/2 tsp and still it was so spicy that you couldn't taste much else and he young members of the family wouldn't eat it. Sounded like a good recipe, but was disappointing-I won't be making this again.

Great recipe, too spicy for the kids.  Didn't have green bell pepper and used about 1/2 onion as my husband is not a fan.  We put shredded cheese on top and made a meal out of it.  I'm looking forward to making again.

This recipe was very easy to make and very tasty. The whole family enjoyed, and was good leftover in bean, cheese, rice and chicken burritoes. I used red pepper because I didn't have any green pepper, but next time I will use green - the  green color will make a nice contrast to the red in the tomatoes. Thank you.

Fantastic rice! I followed the recipe accordingly, but I took to account listening to reviewer "Jodi Lynn" I used cumin and the chicken broth, and for my touch of change I added corn and threw in some cooked chicken breast, and threw it all into my rice cooker! It came out fantastic, and I will definitely use this recipe in the future!

this was great! I used chicken stock instead of water as others suggested, and it turned out perfect. My husband hates rice and he had seconds helpings of this! I think I only had to cook it for 20 minutes or so, and it was done.

This was fantastic while other reviews helped it was fun to tweek the main recipe.  I used red and green peppers, sauteed them before adding the rice and jalapenos.  I also used the broth rather than water, which was the first hint of flavor that my boyfriend commented on. I also added a half can of tomato soup because my boyfriend won't eat tomatos, so I still was able to get the flavor in. Delicious!

I think this would be good but it was way too hot for my family, even my husband thought it was hot and he likes spicy. I could modify this to make it less hot so I give it 3 stars.

I enjoyed this recipe.  I followed the advice of others and used chicken broth instead of water and added 1/2 tsp cumin.  I found it too mushy though, so next time I'll add less liquid and simmer 20-25 minutes.

This was really good and I am not a huge fan of spanish rice.  I did use chicken stock instead of water, I also cut up some chilies and added them.  But overall this recipe had a lot of flavor and pretty simple to make.  I will use this recipe again when we have a fiesta.

Authentic tasting spanish rice!  I did use chicken stock as recommended instead of water. I also added another 1/2 tsp of chili powder. The canned tomatoes I used were the kind with basil and garlic. I also added about a tsp of canned green chili peppers.

An overall good recipe.  Felt like it needed a little something, so I followed advice of reviews and added a little cumin and used chicken stock instead of water.

YUMMMYYYY! I added a teaspoon of cumin and added barely any salt (I think the chicken broth that I used helped make it a bit saltier) and it came out really yummy! My dad is such a picky eater and he loved it!

This was far better than any packaged spanish rice I've ever bought.  I didn't have any onion or green pepper though. but I don't think it even needs it. I chopped up a couple jalepenos and added a tsp of chopped garlic and sauted those with the rice. I also added a 1/2 tsp of cumin as someone recommended.  Absolutely fantastic.

Very good recipe!!  I made this tonight and everyone loved it, even the kids.  The only thing I did differently was instead of using canned tomatoes, I used a can of tomato sauce (my kids won't eat tomato pieces). Since I used plain tomato sauce, I cut back on the water by about 1/2 to 3/4 cup. Great recipe, thanks for sharing!

This recipe was fabulous! I agree with others - saute veggies and garlic very well and then brown rice well before adding the rest. I tripled the recipe recently for a party and only used one can of Rotel tomatoes and chilis and added two extra cans of drained tomatoes so it wasn't so spicy for guests. Followed to a tee, this recipe is about as close to Grandma's or Mom's spanish rice as you'll get!

I have been looking for a good recipe for this kind of rice. Excellent. The only change I would make is to substitute some tomatoe juice for the liquid, otherwise, leave it alone.

This was very bland!  It needed salsa or something like that to give it flavor.  It would be good to eat mixed in with an enchilada or something similar, but is too bland on its own.

I made this last night and I wasnt too impressed.  It was easy to make but I just didnt care for the flavor.  It seemed like 2 cups of water was too much, the rice was mushy.  All my guests agreed that is was just ok.  One guest said the flavor of the tomato was too over-powering.  Dont think I'll make this one again.

Wonderful recipe!  Since I like my food spicy, I added a tiny bit of extra chili powder.  Next time, I will add chopped jalapeno peppers for maximum effect.

Delicious!! I threw in a couple of chicken boullion cubes and doubled the recipe. Next time I'll cut back on the water a little. The rice was not very fluffy with all the water and the juice from the tomatoes.

I have to say that I was hesitant to try an online recipe.  However, it was great!  The recipe was easy to follow and delicious.  My family couldn't believe that it was homemade spanish rice.  I will definitely continue using this site.  Thanks!

This was a really easy & wonderful recipe.  I didn't have any bell peppers but it still turned out great.  Much better than processed boxed versions and just as easy.

This rice just didn't tickle my fancy like I had hoped it would. I love the Spanish rice I get in the grocery store, but I wanted to try making my own. There seems to be a certain flavor that I like in the store bought kind that this dish is missing. Thanks for sharing your recipe.

This was good but a bit mushy even though I did saute the rice as suggested.  I will make it again.

A simple version of Spanish rice!  I added a little cumin and used chicken broth instead of water.  Great!

I added 1/2 tsp cumin and about 1 1/2 Tbsp chopped garlic to mine. I also added a medium fresh chopped tomato and about 1/4 cup diced jarred jalapeno's with seeds, since I ran out of canned tomatoes with chilies. With making a double batch and using chicken broth 
instead of water and substituting sea salt for iodized salt, I only used about an 1/16-tsp sea salt for each batch.
Due to my own writing error I, added 2 Tbsp's of chili powder per batch, which gave the rice a deep red color. I knew something was off at this point, but it was to late. Adding the extra chili powder and alot more jalapeno peppers made this dish alot spicier but, my fiance' still loved it!

Great recipe!

Best Spanish Rice recipe ever!  Instead of using canned tomatoes with green chilies, I blanched & diced some of my home grown tomatoes, & used fresh roasted anaheim chilies.  It turned out truly amazing.

I doubled the recipe and needed a ton more water then it called for.. Not sure why so it took a little longer to cook as it was drying out faster then the rice cooked. I'll make it again though, next time, I won't need to double the recipe.

This was just OK for us. We weren't jumping up and down over it. For me, I think it was the chili powder that I didn't like tasting. I love spicy food (I pour habanero sauce over just about everything), but chili powder is one of those spices that I don't care for outside of - well, chili. Because of the flavor - not the heat. So, if you love chili powder - this recipe is probably a good choice.

Great recipe.  I used real tomatoes and chili peppers instead of canned.  I also added garlicm, cumin, and chicken broth (instead of water) as suggested.  Finally, I fired it up a bit with some hot sauce.  Turned out great!

This was ok, I made a lot of changes and it was still kind of bland.  Instead of the can of tom. I used 4oz, can green chilis and 6 oz salsa.  I only used 1 tsp. chili powder becase I ran out, more would have been better.  I also added 1/4 tsp. cumin.

**UPDATE TO MY UPDATE- if you use chicken broth instead of water you may need to cut out the salt completely. The salt is way too much if you don't*** UPDATE - I did make the change of adding the chicken broth and it does make a complete difference in the taste. I also have added just diced tomatoes so that it isn't so spicy. This is absolutely wonderful! *** I love this rice. The only thing I changed in this is to add 1 tsp of cumin. Really helps with the flavor. Without the cumin it lacks flavor.

This rice was great!! I did add chicken broth instead of water. I also added diced tomatoes and green chiles from a can. Added cumin and chili powder for an extra kick. It was the first rice that my husband actually liked off this site.

Very Good, will make again! Followed the recipe except for added diced tomato and used a whole bellpepper. This would be easy to add 1/2 pound or so of meat (beef,chicken,shrimp) and turn out awesome!

This is a great recipe. I've made it several times, and haven't changed a thing. It's quick and easy. Great side dish with any Mexican meal, like tacos or enchiladas.  I've also made individual frozen meals with the rice and burritos or enchiladas. Perfect for a quick lunch or dinner!

I followed the recipe exactly, but found that there is a very dominant chili taste to this dish. I am looking for a recipe with slightly more of a tomato flavor.

Muy bien! The rice turned out great for me. I didn't have chilies or canned tomatoes so I used 1 cup of salsa and it was fabulous! I also cooked this in my rice cooker (no tending needed). Perfect! I will most certainly be making this many times...

Now this is what I call Spanish Rice!  Nothing in a box was making the grade so I finally decided to try a recipe.  My search is over.  No need to try any other recipe!  My 11 year old wanted more after he had ate all of it!  I also used chicken broth instead of water.  Thanks for the recipe!

Very good - I made it with brown rice and it took longer to cook, but that's expected.  Perfect for use in burritos.   If you use Rotel Tomatoes in a can, make sure you get the MILD!

Worlds better than Mexican restaurant rice! I cut the chili powder to 1/2 teaspoon, and added a jalepeno. I think I ate mine with 4 tablespoons of sour cream, it was so spicy, but it was perfect.

I don't usually like spanish rice, so wasn't sure how this was going to turn out.  I was surprised how good it was- a good balance of flavor.  Plus you can change the heat levels to suit your preference.  I did use chicken broth instead of water as suggested by other reviewers.  Will definitely be making this again-

what are all the complaints about with it being too spicy??? It wasn't at all and actually needed more. I added cumin to mine, fresh garlic, and used instant brown rice with only 1 1/4 cup of water...it was ok but I don't know if i will make this again.

Wonderful-Followed the recipe except used bacon grease as someone had suggested instead of vegatable oil.  I used a whole green bell pepper and a whole onion, 2 cups of rice, garlic, one can of Rotel, can of diced green chiles, chicken broth , cayenne pepper and chili powder.  Did not add any salt.  Waiting on the fajitas to finish cooking as I type.

My family loved this recipe.  I doubled the recipe (8 servings) and  substituted another green pepper and one can of chopped green chilies in place of the onion. I also used a Southwest Seasoning Mix (Pampered Chef blend) instead of the chili powder.

Okay, but pretty bland, also thought had a rather "bitter" flavor to it, and missing something. Maybe not so much chili powder, and a little cumin? Maybe will try again, and do some adjusting to the recipe. As is, just mediocre.

I think there is too much chili powder in this recipe, and as written it is too spicy.  It needs a lot of tweaking for different spice tolerances.  I think it would be better with at least half the chili powder cut out.  Otherwise, it is a good easy recipe.

This recipe was pretty easy but seemed like it was missing something in the flavor. I like my spanish rice to have more spice, maybe some garlic or fresh jalapenos would be a nice addition.

This did not work for me...I followed the recipe, because I am a learning "cooker" still, and I tasted the chili powder way too much. One thing I may have done wrong was include some brown rice mixed in with my white; I think it may have threw off the texture.

Too spicy (and I only put a dash of chili powder). I used Rotel (mild) as the tomatoes/green chili. After getting over the spice of it, it was pretty bland and could have used some other spices to liven it up. Will try another recipe next time.

I loved this rice. I served it with something pretty spicy, so it was good that it was slightly milder. Didn't have green pepper, so I added extra chiles. Also, a little salt becuase for me, everything needs salt.

I made this tonight and It tasted on the mild/bland side to me, but perfect for my husband.  Compard to other recipes I have made, it is mild in the spice department (and yes, my tastebuds are perfectly intact).  But we all taste things differently!!!  The only thing I did that the recipe didn't state was to bring it to a boil before lowering the temp to simmer for 30 min, I guess out of habit of always making rice that way.  Definetly would make again, and as another reviewer stated:  add my own "heat" for my portion.

This recipe tasted pretty good though I couldn't find my chili pepper so it was lacking that extra kick. The only thing I didn't care for was the mushy texture, but I'm sure that is an easy fix some how.

Delicious. My family loved this. Did use a lower sodium chicken broth instead of water and omitted the salt. The diced toms with chiles gave this some heat,which I loved. I'd probably just stick with regular diced tomatoes if serving to little ones. A medium grain rice worked great with this{that's all I had)but I'm sure long work just as good. I brought the broth to a boil before covering, then brought it down to a simmer after. My husband eats this with a dollup of sour cream by itself. I had this with the Salsa chicken from this site.This is a keeper.

This was this first time I ever made Spanish rice.  We really liked it.  I will definetly make it again.  The only changes I made, was added vegetable base and cumin.

My family really enjoyed this.  Like others, I made a few adjustments.  I used chicken broth in place of the water, added Rotel tomatoes with chilies, omitted the salt, and added 1 tsp. of cumin.  The rice was moist but not soggy. Delicious! I can't believe how easy it was. I will never buy a box again. Thanks for a great recipe.

For a relatively healthy dish, it was really good.  I just don't think I browned the rice long enough.  But I would definitely make it again.

I had to make a few adjustments, only had a can of plain diced tomatoes (would've love it with chiles), and a person in the family doesn't like green bell peppers so I didn't add that. But, it was wonderful. I was so pleased with the recipe and look forward to maybe following the whole recipe next time.

Excellent rice, though we had to change the recipe up a little bit because in the work kitchen we don't have anything.

Omitted the salt, boiled chicken (tore it up, tossed it in after everything was done) and use the broth instead of water, didn't use chili powder (none here), used a can of Stewed Tomatoes with Oregano etc, and used butter instead of oil.

Delicious.

I added 1 T. Chipotle Pepper Sauce to the seasonings for a smoky flavor.  Excellent!  I, too, found that this made quite a bit so there's no need to double recipe to feed a large family.

Excellent, quick rice for mexican nights.  I like to use the tomatoes that have the diced jalapenos in them so that the rice is spicy.

We didn't like this at all.  I followed the recipe completely and it came out very mushy with not much flavor.  I even did the chicken broth for the water and we still didn't care for it.

Im sorry, but I didnt care for this, and neither did my kids.  I tripled the recipe, and it made too much (my fault).  I kept having to add more water, and it needed to cook A LOT longer, and it stuck to the bottom, despite my constant stirring, but i am sure that this was because i tripled it.  I'll try this one more time, but next time, ill stick with the original serving sizes, and make it just for my husband, who liked it a lot.  I will also add chicken broth instead of water, as others have suggested.

I made this for a birthday party as a side dish with tacos.  I thought it was delicious and pretty easy to prepare.  A lot of my guests thought it was a little too spicy (we're from minnesota so it doesn't take much!)  Watch how many people you are serving. I tripled the recipe for 13 people and I ended up with a huge pot and only used about a third of the rice.  I would say the recipe serves 6 good servings at least.

This is now a staple at our house.  My husband loves it.  It's got a kick to it, so my 3 year old doesn't favor it much.  I've made this many times, but I still think about adding chicken broth instead of water...maybe next time.

I have never made Spanish rice from skratch( excuse me for the poor grammer to that word)before,but this recipe came out tasting just like the store bought.I didn't have a can of tomatoes w/green chilies.In its place I stirred in a can of tomatoe paste with hand crushed tomatoes and a small can of diced green chilies.I  also upgraded the servings to 6 instead of 4.

I had a birtday Fiesta.  The rice was a great side dish.  I made a serving for 20, so there was still some left over for some to take home with them.  It even better the next day, we made rice and bean taco.  Thank you.

Good recipe!  I substituted chicken broth for the water (omitted the salt) and added 1 tsp. of cumin.  Next time though I think I'm going to cut the chili powder by half, it was a little spicy for my 17mo. old.  (He still ate it though!)  Beats making it from a box mix!

I can't thank you enough for this recipe. I have been trying to make this in my own without a recipe for a while now & I always screw up. This was perfect. I don't know why I didn't figure this out before, but I think it is the amount of onion. It was fantastic!!!

With three picky teenagers and their friends usually at the dinner table, I rarely find something that everyone LOVES. This dish, they did. From The vegan to the junk food addict, they all raved that this rice "kicks butt". That, by the way, is quite a compliment from the 15 to 18 yr. group. The adults concurred; it really does "kick butt". Thanks.

Great rice Dave! Truly the best spanish rice recipe I've made so far. My only negative comment would be the amount of salt called for. A teaspoon is alot, especially when there's already well over 400mg in the tomatoes. I didn't use any salt and it was still a fantastic side that my whole family loved. Thanks so much!

Absolutely delicious. As a new cook, I was happy to hear my husband say it was restaurant-caliber. :) I preferred it without the chilies. I used a 14 oz. can of diced tomatoes, drained, and added 1/2 tsp. cumin and 1/2 tsp. garlic powder. Scrummy!

Very good.  I put the tomatoes & chilis in my food processor because I don't like "chunks" of tomatoes in my food.  I also added hamburger at the end.  It's a nice one dish meal.

Very good side dish - one of the best Spanish rice recipes I've made. I only had a can of diced tomatoes w/out chilis, so I added a bit of cayenne to spice it up even more. I also added a bit of cumin. Delicious, and even better the next day.

My mono-sylabic husband raved, he said "Outstanding!" Also, "My mother's never tasted this good." We will be having this again and again. Thanks for the easy, quick, yummy recipe. 

I used chicken stock, 3/4 ancho chili powder and 1/4 cumin. Didn't have regular rice so I used Minute Rice, doubling the amount of rice. It was done in less than 20 minutes.

I don't know what happened.  I followed the recipe exactly, but it came out as a big pile of mush with no taste.  With all the great reviews I guess it is proably something I did, although I have no idea what.  I won't try  this recipe again though.

I don't know what I did wrong.  I read the reviews and was really looking forward to eating this dish, but mine turned out incredibly taste-less.  I followed the recipie exactly, other than subbing chicken broth for the water and adding a bit of cumin as other suggested.  It smelled great cooking, but it had no taste.  After all the rave reviews, I'm really disappointed! :(

It was good - I used red peppers instead of green, which gave it a nice flavor.  I also used minute rice and adjusted instructions accordingly

We enjoyed this recipe.  We used a can of Rotel with the juice and I think the rice has a lot of flavor and with the Rotel, it's also spicy.

I fried the rice first, then added the onion and bell pepper and once that cooked down, I added the seasoning.

Very good.  I thought it said 1 T of chili powder, but it was fine.  I like things fairly mild, and, surprisingly, it wasn't too hot.  Although my husband thought it was a little too spicy.  But he doesn't like any discerable spice.

I used some left over canned diced tomatoes I had and then added some chuncky salsa.

It turned out very good.  I will definitely make this again.

Great rice!!! It was tasty as well as very quick to put together ~ a total bonus after an extra long shift at work. I served the rice with some sauteed chicken breasts. I think I'll take another reviewers advice and use chicken broth in place of the water next time. Thanks a bunch Dave.

Very tasty and easy to make.  I added a can of corn (drained) as well for some more color, and a dash of cumin as well.

Very good and easy.  I too subbed chicken broth for the water, and added a little chili powder and garlic powder.  Topped with cheese- great!

Not the best, but pretty good.  This makes a lot of rice-my husband and I both had leftovers for lunch the next day.  Next time I think I will follow advice of others and use chicken broth and add corn.  One good thing, the spices are adjustable to your liking.  This is not the perfect Spanish rice, but good.

Was very easy and simple. I used diced tomates and used the juice plus water. Came out great. My children loved it.

I hate to be one of the few that didn't rate this recipe very high, but I found this dish to lack a lot of flavor.  I followed the recipe and even tried to top it off with a bit of shredded cheese for added flavor but it didn't work.

Great recipe!  I used Mrs. Dash's extra spicy blend instead of chili powder and one cup of chicken broth substituted for one cup of water.  It's full of taste and has a little bite to it!  It's perfect and oh so easy!

Great recipe! Loved it!! I substituted chicken broth for water. Also, I used brown rice, and so I added another 1.5 cups water. Also, I love hot stuff, so I added some hot peppers. Too much onion...only half is necessary.

This was good but way too hot for our taste. I used a can of Ro-tel diced tomatoes and chiles and added only a 1/2 tsp of chili powder. I  think I might try it without chili powder and add it at the end, and only if needed.

I hate to say it, but I didn't care for this much. I think I prefer plain white rice as a palate cleanser to accompany more spicy mexican dishes. Thanks anyway.

I was very dissapointed with this recipe.  Although the rice was "spicy" from the tomatoes and green chiles, overall it was very bland, in taste and in color.  I'm glad I tried something new, but won't be cooking this again.

This was pretty good spanish rice.  I didn't have any tomatoes with green chilis so I had to improvize with what I had and it was still pretty flavorful.
