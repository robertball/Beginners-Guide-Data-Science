I loved the concept of this recipe with the walnuts and alfredo sauce, and while this was very good as is, I think it would be over the top delicious with (and, yes, I understand that this is a Bertolli recipe and I love their products and mean no offense) homemade alfredo sauce. I used rotini pasta because that's what I had on hand, but followed the recipe exactly otherwise. This was wonderful for a super quick meal, but there is just something a little more special and delicious about homemade alfredo. So I guess what I'm trying to say is that I would definately make this again, but make my own sauce. Thanks for sharing. :)

Another super simple and tasty recipe!  I loved the addition of the walnuts to the sauce, gave it a wonderful flavor and crunch.  I did use a jar of the Bertolli Alfredo sauce and will keep a jar around for a super fast supper!

looks wonderful I can't wait to make it except my son is allergic to nuts so I will make it without the nuts. What a easy recipe that takes less then 30 minutes. THanks for posting this
