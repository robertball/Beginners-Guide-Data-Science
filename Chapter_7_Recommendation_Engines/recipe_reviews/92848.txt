3 stars because the original is way too high in calories fats and sodium. I made major changes to ingredients cutting way back on butter----1-T for flavor a little canola oil and spraying the nonstick pot with PAM. Threw in a package of sliced baby bella mushrooms & a diced onion first cooked them a til onion was transparent then removed added a little more oil and browned the chicken a little. Used skinless chicken thighs(more flavor) and breast strips. Returned the onion mushroom mix to pot added seasonings--salt pepper poultry seasoning(all to taste)& 3 cans of low sodium chicken stock and simmered until meat was tender. Used 8 oz. each of low fat & fat free sour cream. If it needs thickening add a little corn starch and water before adding sour cream. Served over instant brown rice(I added a little onion powder to it) and tossed some chopped green onions on top. A bit more work but I'm suppose to be on a low sodium low fat low everything if it tastes good spit it out diet.

Great simple dish with a lot of flexibility. Great to use as a base. I followed the recipe but added onions and carrots. My husband and sons loved it and I will make it again

Very tasty! It makes a lot of gravy which I appreciate. I would have preferred the gravy to be a little thicker but that is a minor point.

I love this recipe! The only thing I did differently was to sprinkle paprika on the chicken before browning in addition to the salt and pepper and I serve it over egg noodles. I do like the idea of thickening the gravy because it is too thin but still really tasty! My kids loved it so much it is now the requested birthday meal!

I really enjoyed this recipe. I only used half the sour cream and homemade stock. A little salt and everything was fine. It certainly isn't bursting with flavor so if you don't like a more mellow chicken dish this is not for you. It makes great leftovers. Perfect over rice.

This is a wonderful recipe I encourage those who found it blan etc. to read the reviews paying attention to some great suggestions. I made this and instead of bell peppers I used a few anaheim peppers instead. I also payed attention to the "down sides" mentioned and it turned out wonderful. If nothing more it is a wonderful base so don't just knock it play with it become creative. Fun fun fun... Wolf...

This recipe is WONDERFUL! I changed a couple things. I seasoned the chicken with garlic powder & poultry season. For the gravy...I only used about 4oz of sour cream and in a small bowl I combined 4 tsp of cornstarch & a 1/2 cup of milk. Stir this thoroughly and mix in with the other ingredients to make a wonderful gravy. When its about 5 mins away from being done I add a 4oz can of mushrooms. I also added more chicken stock to this to thin it out just a little. We serve this over rice. My fianc√© and I loved this and I will make this again for sure!

we loved this so much - we feed the neighbors!!! though i ended up using another reviewer's suggestion of cornstartch milk - it was still too thin for our tastes. so i ended up adding 3 heaping T of flour to make it more gravy-like. and there's still a TON leftover that i froze for a fast and impressive 2nd meal. THANKS!

This was Great! Everyone loved it. I doubled the recipe for my large family and had a lot of extra gravy So I froze the gravy and later thawed it out and thickened it with cornstarch and used it for a base in my chicken pot pie! YUMMY!

This was a huge hit here. Nothing fancy or gourmet quality but this is major comfort food. I used chicken stock as it is what I had in the pantry. I served this over long grain white rice and my family raved over this simple dish. I used 6 boneless chicken breasts and seasoned with Season-All fresh ground black pepper and some paprika. I simmered this about 90 minutes. It (sauce) was rather thin though and I added some flour/water paste to try to thicken it some. Thanks this is fantastic!

Excellent! This is true southern /country cooking where we call most sauces gravy! For everyone who said this is not a true gravy is right but in the south this is "country gravy" not thick gloppy and filled with starch or flour! Loved this and the only change I made was I used chicken broth instead of boullion. It came out a little salty using the broth but was still excellent. This is in my resume box and it will become a household regular! Thanks for this easy filling and delicious recipes

This came out excellent but I am giving it only four stars because I agree with previous reviewers that it is a good starting point but needs some modifications. I like a thicker sauce so I left out the water and cut the amount of butter in half. I started by sauteing one finely grated onion in the butter then added 4 large chicken thighs dredged in flour along with some fresh rosemary and sage and some chicken rub. Since I happened to have some leftover red wine on hand I added some of that too after the chicken had browned and let half of it bubble away before adding the broth. I used skin-on chicken pieces and it still came out very rich next time I'll try to use skinless thighs. I only added one heaped tablespoon of sour cream which was enough to give the sauce an extra silky texture without mellowing the flavor. My husband took one bite of this and was hooked. Served with mashed potatoes string beans corn and buttermilk biscuits it makes for a real "country meal".

The chicken had a good flavor but the sauce cannot be called a gravy. I used 1/4 cup less water than was called for and it was still VERY runny.

My family loved this. Taking cues from reviews about the gravy being too thin I eliminated the water and it came out great. I also sprinkled with paprika as well as the salt & pepper. Very quick and easy to make.

This was a good recipe that could be a great recipe with some changes. I read the other reviews and followed the advice to skip the water. I also dusted the chicken parts with flour when I sprinkled the S & P on to give the liquid some thickness and also added some paprika. Next time I'll use more flour maybe dredging the chicken parts in the flour will thicken the liquid a bit more. After browning the chicken I removed it from the pan and sauteed 1 large onion and 2 bell peppers then added the chicken back & followed the rest of the recipe (minus the water) and next time I'll leave the peppers out. The onions were a great addition but the peppers were just too limp by the end of cooking. I'll make this again but it really does need some changes.

This was really good! Comfort food at it's best! I did not use water. I used a 32 oz carton of chicken broth instead and skipped the bouillon. This made a very tasty gravy. After I browned the chicken I removed it and added diced onion and celery to the pan and stirred it around to loosen up the drippings in the pan. I put the chicken back in and added the broth. Then followed the rest of the recipe as directed. Served it over rice with a side of collards. Too good!

My kids gave this a 5 I would say for because it is very watery and I even read the reviews and hardly used any water. I cooked the chicken about 2 hours. The chicken tasted SOOOOO good I could taste the butter!! We served with rice and it was incredible. I will try thickening the liquid up more next time but this is an excellent recipe as is. Thanks!!

I think as others have pointed out this is a great base recipe. I followed it almost exactly except I added a chopped onion and fresh mushrooms and some seasonings - (salt/pepper rosemary thyme) I think I would attempt this again with a few minor changes - the whole stick of butter along with the fat from the chicken skins really is a bit much. I spent a lot of time skimming fat from the top of this dish before I was able to serve it. So next time I would definitely reduce the butter by 1/2 and use skinless chicken. It also needed to be thickened with corn starch quite a bit to produce a "gravy". But overall an easy economical recipe that I will enjoy playing around with & tweaking to suit my own taste. Thanks for sharing!

Thought this looked fairly quick and easy...used 4lbs of leg quarters for economy..seasoned with poultry seasoning/salt pepper/garlic salt browned in EVOO with freshly mince garlic and onion...added chopped carrots for added nutrition and color..not sure what i did wrong..but I had way too much liquid..i thickened with cornstartch added extra sour cream and cream cheese and it was still almost too runny. Took the chicken and removed the meat from the bone served over rice to help absorb some of the sauce. Overall not bad...next time I will let the broth cool after removing the chicken so I can skim off some of the fat and I will use some of the broth to cook the rice/noodles in adding the cooled broth to the sour cream until it is the consistancy that I desire. Good basic recipe..lots of opportunity to add flavor./// Made this again with seasoned cubed chic breasts left out the bullion and water just used the recomended amount of broth didn't have sour cream used up the tub of ranch dip instead..served over rice with grn beans. i did thicken the broth with cornstarch before adding the "sour cream". Everyone went back for seconds!

I use a little extra spice to my chicken with sour cream gravy. while cooking I add 1 bay leaf and about 6 whole allspice balls. Take out after cooking and in the end add some paprika. It makes a very good gravy

My family really enjoyed this dish. We put it over mashed potatos then for the final touch sprinkled with bacon pieces- YUM! - next time I will halve the butter since it seems excessive- I used boneless skinless chicken breast cut up and they turned out very moist. I added garlic and red pepper to the butter when sauteing the chicken which added a little something "extra." For the gravy I used 5 cups boillon/water total then when I added it to the chicken I simmered it for 30 minutes uncovered. I also added 2 Tbsp of cornstarch to thicken it. A tip for those who get clumps is to put about 1/4 cup of gravy in a bowl sprinkle it with the cornstarch and whisk VERY well. Add it to the pot and you get a nice smooth thick gravy. You'll also have lot of leftovers to enjoy later.

So I didn't actually make this recipe. But I saw the potential and thought I'd share with ya'll about my changes. I chopped some small bell peppers as well as some onion and mushroom. Sour cream is way too fattening so I decided to use greek yogurt non fat and it adds a lovely tang. also way too much butter! I used 2 tbspns. I reduced the water drastically and since I made a smaller amount of chicken only one can of broth. The chicken I seasoned with parsley basil salt and pepper. I added cornstarch for thicker gravy and topped it with chopped green onions. It was delicious! Spicy and tangy perfect over sticky rice. I hope my healthier alternative helps someone.:)

I made this tonight and thought that it was awful! It calls for you to cut up a chicken which I did but it wasn't necessary. Second the "gravy" was just liquid. If I were to make it again I would add a lot more seasoning and some cornstarch plus some veggies like onions and carrots.

Tasty and different. Gravy was thin. Probably a little more sodium than is needed. The family enjoyed it and it was easy to make with simple ingredients that were generally on hand in the cupboard or fridge. Thanks for posting.

I've made this recipe twice. First time around I made it according to directions. My only deviation was to use chicken thighs. Like several other reviewers I found it to be extremely bland and the sauce extremely thin. Served over rice. This recipe has potential. I was looking for more flavor vegetables and a "gravy" that would not be water-thin - leading to another try. Second time I used cubed skinless boneless chicken breasts and substituted a bit of olive oil for the butter. Once meat was sauteed I did not add additional water and I used one sachet of stock (Knorr Homestyle Chicken Stock concentrate) instead of chicken bouillon cubes in addition to the cans of chicken stock. I also added 8 largish carrots rough chopped and a large yellow onion chopped 2 tablespoons garlic minced. With regard to other reviews once vegetables were fork-tender I thickened the "gravy" with 2 heaping spoons of cornstarch in 1/4 cup cold water. One large can of drained sliced mushrooms and sour cream was added after thickening stirred till everything was hot and served over rice. As written this recipe barely deserves three stars. Fortunately it's an easily adaptable dish and the second edition was delicious. Rabbit would be a delightful substitution for the chicken.

I used boneless chicken and seasoned it with s&p but added garlic powder and paprika. I also cut mushroom onion and less than half of a jalape√±o. I boiled the broth with chicken cubes no water just sour cream and one spoon of flour. It was a bit to thin to me so I added a little mushroom soup I had. Then I finally put it all together and let it simmer served over white rice
