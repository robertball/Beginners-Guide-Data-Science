I have tried so many potato soup recipes - but this one tops the charts!  Definately double or triple this recipe if it is served as the main dish.  I did tweek it a little based on other reviews.  I fried bacon and set it aside to top the soup when serving -- then browned the onion in the bacon fat.  I added a can of Campbell's cheddar soup and used only half of the shredded cheese.  I also omitted the extra salt.  The cheese and chicken broth had enough salt already.  I put half of the potato/broth mixture into a blender, but saved some potatoes cubed to give it some texture.  I have a big family and they all loved it!

This soup was indeed delicious! But I can't leave well enough alone, so I did make a few changes (or should I say, additions) to the recipe, including a few slices of bacon which I fried until crispy (for topping), and the reserved bacon drippings which helped cook the onions. I also put in about 1/2 cup diced celery and one small diced carrot to the onions. Like some other reviewers, I also only removed half of the potatoes to be pureed, since I wanted some chucky bits left. I also put in more broth, just to make it a little "soupier." But, it would have been great without these additions! 

 I received highest reviews from my mother when I surprised her with a freshly made, hot bowl of this for lunch. She immediately called me back to exclaim, "Best potato soup ever!" And she is a wonderful cook, and grew up eating potato soups made by other great cooks as well! I couldn't have been happier! I wish I had made double the amount! I have tried various potato soups before... some which were passable, and some which were great, but this is the best yet.

This is a sure-fire recipe, and would be great as is or expouned upon. It was delicious topped with crumbled bacon and chives, and I look forward to eating the remainder at supper tonight. Thanks!

Wow! I really enjoyed this soup!  I sauteed a clove of minced garlic with the onions, used Yukon Golds, and substituted evaporated milk for the cream, and it turned out great.  The cayenne pepper really adds a kick.  I also garnished the soup with shredded cheddar, crumbled bacon, and green onion for a "loaded" cheese potato soup.  The only think I'll do differently next time is leave bigger potato chunks when pureeing the soup.

I can't count the number of times I've made this soup.  It's so incredibly easy and delicious!!  My husband, parents and co-workers love it when I serve it as either a starter or a meal in itself.  Goes beautifully with a spring mix salad and fresh crusty bread.  Sprinkling chopped chives and shredded sharp cheddar of top adds a little extra flavour and colour.  Freezes extremely well.

Good, but almost too cheesy!  And that's wierd, coming from me.  I did like it though.  I like chunks in my potato soup, so instad of pureeing it, I mashed it with a non-electic handheld masher, right in the pot.  Left a bunch of small chunks, but still thickened nicely.  Used 2/3 cup cream and 1/3 cup whole milk.  I didn't even see the cayenne pepper on the recipe until I went to review it, so I will have to add it to the leftovers!  Funny, because as I was eating it, I thought "a dash of cayenne would be great in this!".  I used over 3 cups of potatoes, and added 1/2 cup water to the broth to compensate.  Didn't add any salt and used Tillamook sharp cheddar.  Sprinkled fresh parsley on top of each serving for extra color.  Served with focaccia bread for dipping.  It made a great winter meal!

Really really good!  I wish I had run across this recipe in the Fall instead of the Spring because it's excellent stick-to-your-ribs cold weather food.  I used half & half instead of heavy cream, and a large can of diced potatoes, and threw in extra cheese since I had to use up some Monterey Jack too.  It was still plenty rich tasting and the kids liked it as well. I scooped about 1/2 the potatoes mixture out of the saucepan and put it in the blender for about 10 seconds.  I left the other half unblended.  It was a great texture that way.  Plenty thick enough too. The recipe makes a lot.  Thanks!

The soup was v/good, but made a few changes because of my husband's diet and my own recipes.  Used 3/4 of the potatoes and made up the weight with parsnip, omitted the cayenne and salt, but added Ground black pepper, a teaspoon of English mustard powed and a good dash of worcestershire sauce.  Again because of diet cream was replaced with set Greek yoghurt. Serve with fresh crusty bread and topped with chopped fresh coriander - will use again, you can't beat a good mature English Cheddar. Strange picture though!

My husband and I love this soup. He is from PA and asked that I make a potato soup for him so I tried this one out. I added bacon and left the potatoes chucky style since he likes it that way. It was WONDERFUL! He totally loved it and has asked me to make it again. lol
I highly recommend this recipe.

I have made this several times and it is a great hit with my family and friends.  I changed it a little.  I use vegitable broth instead of chicken broth(less salty taste).  I smash about half of the potatoes.  I also garnish it with crumbled bacon and fresh chives.  Very excellent food!  Thanks!

Really good. Added 1 tsp onion podwer, 1 tsp minced garlic, 1 cup carrots, 1 tsp dry parsley, 1 tbsp bacon bits. Did not puree anything. Cooked long enough that some of the potatoes just fell apart. Did not use heavy cream, used 1/2 c sour cream and 1/2 c skim milk. Sooooooooo gooood!!

Make sure to add enough salt to bring out the flavor of the cheese.  I forewent the cream for 1% milk and it still turned out very yummy.  Garlic is a good addition, as well.  I'm recommending this to everyone!

This recipe is a great starting point for potato soup, but I added some ingredients which really made it fantastic. For starters, I fried some thick cut bacon (about 6 strips) in a pot until it was moderately crispy then put it aside for use later. I used a paper towel to soak up some of the extra bacon grease and added to that half of the butter (1 tbs) then added in the chopped onion and also some chopped carrot, celery, and a clove or 2 of garlic. I also used red potatoes instead of russets. I like my soups chunky, so I didn't puree or mash the potatoes - they break down a little while they cook anyway. Instead of the shredded cheddar cheese, I added a can of Campbell's cheddar soup, then I chopped up the bacon and added that to the mix. Along with the dill weed, I also added a touch of rosemary to really give it some flavor. The extra salt it not necessary because of the salt in the cheddar soup.  For garnish, I served it with some shredded cheddar cheese on top and some chopped green onion. If you like a little kick to your soup a touch of cayenne pepper, brown mustard, or Tabasco sauce compliment the other flavors well.

Delicious. Don't add salt til you taste the soup though. I didn't add any & it was plenty salty. Also I would reccomend measuring the cheese. I didn't want to measure it out & so added a bag of shredded sharp cheddar (2 cups). It over powered the soup. It was still very good, but tasted more like cheese soup with potatoes than potato soup with cheese. I would definately make this again.

Good, and definitely not too cheesy at all. Sauteed the onions in EVOO for about 5 mins. then added the 4 cloves of minced garlic, cooking until fragrant. Tossed in the peeled, diced potatoes (I used 6 small to medium sized potatoes) and cooked them a bit before adding the 3 cups of water + 2 chicken bouillon cubes. Cooked for 20 minutes, then gently mashed the potatoes leaving some chunks. I didn't have any cream so I used 2% milk and added a can of cream-style corn. For seasoning I used the salt and pepper, but switched the dill for dried chives and added cumin (to pair with the corn). I didn't want to use cayenne so I used 1 tsp. jarred, minced chilies . I think I used a little less cheese, but that's only because I didn't have much on hand. I'd like to sub some of the regular onion for green onion next time. Served this with "Best Ever Corn Muffins" from AR.

The flavor was great, but be sure not to add too much potato. Because if you add too much potato compared to the amount of broth, it could turn into a mashed potato texture.

My family loved this soup.  I am from PA and one of my families favorite potatoe soups is "German Potaote Soup", well, I have found another favorite!  I also used 1/2 cup milk and 1/2 cup sour cream instead of heavy cream, and added just a dash more cayenne pepper and served it with parisian bread!  AWESOME

This was a great soup.  The cayenne gave it a little kick that my family liked.  I sauteed about 1/2 cup of chopped celery with onion only because I needed to get rid of it and I used half and half cream since that is what I had on hand.  Next time I make this I will add one cooked diced potato after pureeing the soup.  We like some chunks of potato in our soup.

I loved this recipe!  I made a few modifications; I added a can of corn and only pureed half of the potatoes for a chunky soup. I also made it lower in fat by completely eliminating the cream.  It still turned out wonderful!

I took the advice of others and doubled this recipe -- other than that, I made it according to the directions and it was FANTASTIC!  The whole family loved it!  We served it with grated cheddar and bacon bits to sprinkle on top.  If doing it again, I'd cut back on the broth just because I'd prefer a thicker soup, but you can't improve on the taste!

Very flavorful soup. Easy soup to adjust to make your own. I added bacon, celery, and a carrot. Recommend skipping the salt until you taste it. Will make again.

I followed the recipe exactly with all the ingredients that same but the only thing I did different is I didn't puree the mixture for a chowder, I cut everything up and just cooked it all together. turned out great. Wonderful flavor. My boyfriend loves it as well and he is usually a tough critic.

This was super good!  (ANYTHING with a cup of heavy cream must be good though, right?)  However, the next time I make it, I won't puree the potatoes and I will try it with half and half.

I was spoiled by the recipe for Baked Potato Soup I from this site!  Therefore, I was extremely disappointed by this recipe.  Even with the heavy cream and all that cheese, it's still not thick & creamy & smooth the way that I had hoped.  We'll be sticking with the other recipe; won't make this one again.

This recipe is very easy and very delicious!  Although instead of using the shredded cheese, I cut up chunks of velveeta cheese.  It gave a very good flavor and had a good consistancy.

Very good, and easy to prepare. Trying to decrease the fat a little, I omitted the heavy cream, used 2% milk and a couple tablespoons of sour cream, and only about 1/2 the cheese(also 2%). I used vegeatble broth and I didn't use nearly as much onion, as I did not want the soup to have an oniony flavour.

This was very yummy. The only downside-it was a bit salty and I only added a little.  Next time I will not add salt at all until I have tasted the soup with all the ingredients in it.  Otherwise, very good. :)

This was my first time making potato soup... Boy is this a 'KEEPER'!! The only adjustments I made was not adding the dill weed as I didn't have any, but I don't think anyone noticed and I added 1 extra potato (cubed) for a little 'chunky' texture. Topped with sour cream, bacon and shredded cheese... YUMMMM! Will def make again

Loved this soup!  After the initial boilling, I let it cook on low for 1.5 hours.  I added alittle bit extra shredded cheddar.  Alittle diced ham and cup of  cauliflower.  I didnt have any heavy cream, so I used half and half.  Also, increased the amount of seasonings to my liking.  I love cheese so to me, this was heavenly soup -- as usual, leftovers were delicious.

I made some changes using 1/2 c. sour cream because I didn't have heavy cream. I also cut up too many potatoes using 4 cups instead of 2 1/2 c. I did not add any salt. I used an immersion blender and left some chunks. This was the best potato soup my husband or I have ever had!  I loved the dill!  Really very simple and delish!!!! Try it!

So good! In case anyone is wondering (because I had no idea), 2.5 cups of potatoes is about 2 potatoes' worth. I cut up two and had a little more than I needed, but I just threw it in there anyway. I swapped the cream with fat-free evaporated milk to save a bunch of fat. I also used vegetable broth because I don't eat chicken anymore. This would be really good with bacon bits (real or fake)!

This soup is absolutely WONDERFUL!  I made it two days in a row.  I followed the recipe exactly the first time.  Very good flavor.  The 2nd time I used evaporated milk.  Still tasted great although not as rich as with the heavy cream (of course).  Will definitely make this again...and again!

Do not totally puree the potaoes, leave some chunks for texture, also boil the potatoes with a clove or 2 of garlic or saute the garlic with the onions - adds a nice flavour if you like garlic. Also agree with omitting the salt if using commercial chicken broth, and milk is great if you don't have cream.

Excellent!  I used half-n-half instead of heavy cream (it's what I had on hand).  Also, I used chicken stock with water in place of canned chicken broth.  (Much better for any recipe that calls for broth.)  It was delicious.  Next time I make it I will probably add real bacon bits.  Perfect amounts of seasoning - could even bump up the cayenne to make it spicier, but my family liked it as is.

This was an easy yet great recipe to make. I have tried adding Sweet potatos, carrots and parsley. Use milk instead of cream and keep it a bit lighter. All in all, the family loved it!

SO PERFECT! I tried another cheese and potato soup before this one and I thought that one was pretty okay but this one definitely beats it. The consitency is sooooooo smooth and the soup was overall so yummy! I'm throwing the other recipe out and replacing it with this one

I am no longer as "fat-phobic" so I don't worry about the amount of natural fats in this recipe. I have made changes that  I find improve the finished result, though. I saute the onion, plus diced celery and carrots, in a bit of olive oil in my soup pot. After these have cooked a few minutes, I add two T of butter, and allow it to melt. I then stir in a couple of T of all purpose flour, cook for a minute or two- then add the chicken stock and the seasonings. I stir until there are no lumps, cover and simmer until veggies are tender. I cook the potatoes separately during this process (more than called for, and I find that some red skinned potatoes mixed with russets is a nice addition.) When potatoes are tender, I drain and roughly mash them, and add to the soup pot.  I add cheese (I don't measure this) and half and half last and gently heat through. We add more cheese, sour cream, crumbled bacon and sliced green onions to our bowls. We love this soup so much I make it often during the winter.

Great soup and it doesn't take a lot of effort.  I cooked the onion with garlic in bacon grease (not healthy but definitely good).  I pureed about two thirds of the soup and left the rest of the potato in chunks.  I also substituted the heavy cream with three quarters cup milk and one quarter cup of sour cream.  We'll have it again!

This is so easy and tasty. I have made this several times. I like to throw in whatever extra veggies I have around the house for an extra layer of flavor. I've added celery and carrots and both tasted great with the soup.

This was a little too oniony for us, next time I'll reduce in 1/2.  Otherwise this is a very nice soup and easy to make.  I don't have an immersion blender so I ust used my potato masher.  This left bits of potato which was perfect.  Thanks for this nice soup recipe.

YUM! This soup recipe was so easy and so good! I didn't have dill weed or cayenne pepper. I did add some broccoli. Like others I just smashed the potatoes with a potato masher and mashed the broccoli with it. I think its better chunky. The broccoli was tasty in it and added color.  I also added a little more pepper, but that is just how I prefer it. Very good and easy, I will make this again!

This soup was great. I did not puree the potatoes I left them as cubes. I did add a couple pieces of bacon and also used fat free half and half instead of heavy cream. This is a keeper!!!! Thanks for a great recipe.

YUMMMMMM!! This soup was so easy to make and tasted soo good! I baked the bread bowl to put it in.. which was ok.. but the soup is great by itself. I used more potatoes and only slightly mashed them and added more cheese, also a clove of garlic with the onions. and then added pieces of chopped ham and it was incredible.

Holy cow this is good. And soooo easy to make it's ridiculous. I know it's a keeper when both my husband and 2.5 yr old inhale it.

I love this recipe! I don't know why I've never reviewed it before! Made this many time and it always turns out great! I like to double the recipe and freeze the left overs! I do not purée the soup, but I use my potato masher. I also only mash half of the potatoes. We like the potato chunks! I also use half cheddar and half montery jack cheese...awesome!

My husband wanted to give this 7 stars becasue it was so good!  My suggestions are to use vegetable broth which will make it into a nice vegetarian soup, and also to hold off on the salt until it is done cooking so you know how much to add.  My cheese was pretty salty and the end result was a bit too salty but still delicious!

One of the best soup recipes ever.  It was delicious.  Made it over the weekend, anticipating the snow storm and it was perfect.  Added sour cream and a can of Campbell's cheddar cheese soup.  Extra creamy, extra potatoey, extra YUMMY!  Thanks for a great recipe.

THis was very yum! I used small white potatoes, and rather than pureeing it completely, I used a hand-smasher and took turns with my son mashing up a bunch of the potato. It was nice and think, but not too much so. I also used a whole 2 cups of cheese. . .tasted great!!! Thank you!

This is a great soup, I've made it many times and have gotten very good reviews on it. My nieces ask me to make it every time I go to their house. I use half and half instead of the heavy cream and it comes out great. I just try to cut down on the heavy stuff to make it less fattening.

This is a good recipe!  I have a usual potato soup that I have used for years.  But this one is a good variation!  It also has less fat and calories than my other which means, I would make this again!

I saw this recipe today and just knew I had to make it to go with burgers we were making on the grill. In a word,  WONDERFUL!  Very easy to make. Just did not add any salt, and to keep it on a lighter fare, I used 2% milk instead of heavy cream.  We loved it, and I will make it again and again.

I doubled the recipe for this soup.  I also left some chunks of potatoes instead of blending it all and adding a package of real bacon pieces.  This was a very flavorful and cheesy soup...perfect for my husband with a bad cold.  Have some crusty bread handy to dip!  Thick and creamy.  Great!

This was a great recipe!  My husband loved it (and he is a picky eater)!  I didn't have any heavy cream on hand so I added sour cream and milk which I think worked out pretty good.  I also doubled the recipe so we could freeze some for another day.  Definitely will make again!

I absolutely love this soup! I did make a few changes to mine. For starters when boiling the potatoes, I took three large garlic cloves and poked holes in them with a fork, I also tossed all my ingredients in with the potatoes so they could really absorb all the flavor. I also swapped out the Dill for some fresh Rosemary. Along with the heavy cream, I added a dallop of sour crème to really richen up the texture. As a finishing touch I cooked up some bacon and crumbled it in after the soup was almost done. If you do decide to add bacon, consider adding less salt to the pot, as bacon has a lot of salt in it already. You can always add more if you need it later!

Excellent soup, but I'd make some simple changes.  I doubled the soup with 10 white new potatoes.  Boiled 7 of them for soup base in stock along with 2 red onions.  No need to sauté them, since you will be blending them and all that sweating will just leave favor in the other pan.  I boiled 3 small diced potatoes in broth in a separate pan to add into creamed soup.  This us MUCH easier then fishing out chucks without the onions and then adding them back later.  I used half and half instead of easy cream, it freezes much better.

My wife is recovering from major oral surgery. Finding recipes that are both flavorful and easy for her to 'eat' is an ongoing challenge. This is one of the best, most flavorful dishes I've made in the past three weeks. Not to mention, relatively quick and easy to make!

Delicious!  If you don't like it very smooth, then don't puree all the potatoes.  I actually used frozen hashbrown potatoes and it came out great.  My only complaint is that it did not make 6 servings.  I only got 4 out of it and we have 6 people in our family.  So definitely double or triple the recipe for a large family.  Thanks!

Excellent soup. I pureed mine in the food processor, as a friend who has food issues will be eating this soup with me. It was creamy and delicious. I used 1% milk and some sour cream instead of the heavy cream. Almost tripled the cheese and used a dash of hot sauce instead of cayenne. Excellent base for soup! Can't wait to try more variations.

Mmmmm-I was hoping to find an alternative to pot. soup made with a cream soup. This is it. No MSG in this recipe. My husband ate three bowlfuls & it was easier to prepare than my previous pot. soup. I added cooked turkey bacon.  Now I want to know if I can heat it in a crockpot w/o it curdling. Does anyone know?

This recipe was Fantastic!!!! I only made 2 minor adjustments I started by cooking some cut up bacon then added the butter and onion to the pan and continued according to the directions. I also used half & half because I had it on hand. 
I blended the whole thing because that's how I like it. It was was thick and luxurious. We will be eating this all winter long!!!!

This soup is PERFECT!  I added more cheese, but that was the only change I made.  Absolutely delicious!
**Today I threw my potatoes, broth and onion in the crock pot and left it alone for 6-7 hours.  When I came back, I added the remaining ingredients and it was outstanding!**

Very good! I put a little more salt and cayenne just to our families preferred taste. We didn't blend it at first but then halfway through dinner blended it and I was surprised that we liked it better that way! Easy and delicious! My two criteria for a good meal :)

Ooooh, this was yummy!  I will definitely add this as a favorite!  The family loved it!  The only things I changed was 1/2 cup less cheese and pureed half of contents to leave some texture from cubed potatoes.

Really good soup!  I used 1/2 cup of nonfat yogurt and 1/2 cup of heavy cream, added a few dashes of Worcestershire and a few pinches of ground mustard.  Dinner tonight with pot roast!  Fall is approaching!

Excellent soup! My whole family gobbled it up.  The only thing I did different was to add a small amount of pureed carrots to it (not to alter the taste, but sneak some veggies into my kids).

I thought this soup had a great buttery taste to it. I didn't do the puree part since I love potato pieces in soups. I found it to be a bit gritty though, maybe because I didn't puree it? Also didn't have sharp so just used mild cheddar cheese. And didn't add the cayenne pepper since serving it to a 4 and 1 year old.

This is a good, versatile recipe.  The changes I made were: no onion,saut eed celery and a handful of chopped mushrooms in the butter, sprinkled about 3 tbsp flour over the sauteed veggies before adding broth, subbed water + 3 tsp chicken bullion for the broth, subbed 1 can evap milk for the heavy cream, used about 1 1/2 cups tilamook cheddar + 4 slices swiss & 2 slices havarti, added an extra cup or more of potatoes, and added chopped turkey kielbasa.  I didn't food process the potatoes, but just mashed about 1/2 of them right in the pot. Came out pretty thick and thickened even more upon standing. The flavor was outstanding and my husband loved it.  He said add it to the rotation! I loved the taste, but thought the texture could be improved.  Maybe the cheese curdled from simmering too long after adding it or the flour didn't work well? Will definitely try again and maybe new variations.

This soup is to die for! I just slightly mashed the potatoes instead of blending it, and I didn't add any additional salt, and it came out wonderfully!

Excellent base recipe, however I make a few adjustments.  I dice a few strips of bacon (my family prefers turkey bacon) and sauté it with the onions.  It adds tons of extra flavor.  Then I set aside some of the bacon to sprinkle on top.  Also, I only use about 3/4 cup of both heavy cream and cheddar cheese, and I don’t puree about half of the potatoes, I just leave them chunky.  Serve it with a slice of french bread….yum!

This was really yummy! The only thing I did differently was to add another cup of potatoes that I didn't puree. So basically I pureed two cups of the potatoes as suggested, but left about a cup and a half that I did not puree because we wanted texture of the potatoes, too. I also added some crumbled bacon, an extra sprinkling of cheese, and a dollop of sour cream to the top This soup is really creamy and thick and YUMMY! It was perfect on a snowed in day. Thanks for sharing!

Yummy!  The whole family loved it!  This was soooo easy, too.  Served the soup with grated cheese and bacon bits on top.  The whole family raved and I am stuffed.  No left overs though, so from now on I will double the recipe.

A change of pace from our usual potato soup.  I didn't measure out the potatoes, but I am sure I used more than 2.5 cups.  I only put about half of the mixture in the blender and it seemed to be the right balance of creamy thickness in the background and potato chunks.  I was curious how the dill seasoning would taste, but it was hard to even notice it.  After adding the cheese, I would recommend just heating to melt the cheese and get the soup up to serving temp...if you boil the cheese for 5 min. as the recipe states you will probably get a curdled, unappetizing result.

Excellent recipe!  I was afraid about there being no bacon, but I really didn't miss it.  I used half a thing of sour cream instead of the cream and alittle flour to thicken it, and a whole teaspoon of dill.

I was disappointed in this recipe.  It was good, but I was expecting more than what I got.  I followed the recipe but found the soup to be much thinner than I like my soup.  I might make it again but I'm going to keep looking.

WOW!!!  This was the best potato soup I've ever had! I followed the recipe except my daughter had a potato peeling party and peeled too many.  So I added more chicken broth and a little extra salt.  In a homemade bread bowl...superb!

BY FAR my favorite soup recipe.  We usually use beef broth instead of chicken because it makes for a richer flavour.  Also, don't substitute milk for the cream; it really needs at least 10% cream to turn out properly.

We enjoyed this very much. I did substitute 1/2 cup sour cream and 1/2 cup milk for the heavy cream. Also, we like the texture of the potato chunks, so instead of pureeing the soup, I just added some potato flakes, which thickened the soup instantly.

Very good, easy to make and a hearty winter soup. I sauted cubed unpeeled red and gold potatoes with some cut up smoked sausage and added to the soup. I omitted the dill, and cut back on the cayenne pepper.

This is the best soup I have ever made!  I used about 1/2 cup extra potatoes and then left that much out of the blender to give it a more chunky texture, and I only used about half the cayenne called for, since I am not a huge fan.  My whole family loved this; it will definitely be a favorite from now on!

My family loved this soup.  I added chopped garlic because we love  it.  It added very good flavor.  I also put it in the crock pot for about 5 hours and I kept the potatoes whole.  Delicious!

Excellent. Easy to make and very tasty. I recommend serving it like the picture shows, in a bread bowl with sour cream, bacon, cheese and chives on top!  So tasty!

I added some turkey bacon and green onions. I used frozen dill instead of dried, and 1.25 cups of shredded Swedish Christmas cheese instead of cheddar. I pressed the potatoes instead of pureeing. Maybe that was my problem because I couldn't get it to thicken, so I added some butter and flour. It was a really good soup, we enjoyed it because it wasn't much work and didn't need many ingredients. We'll use this again because it is so easy.

This is excellent. Since I wanted a heavier-textured soup, I used a potato masher to mash the potatoes to the consistency I wanted -- very potato-y without being too lumpy. My family loved this -- the first pot vanished in a hurry, and I made a second potful by request two days later!

A very good starting point for a soup.  My girlfriend is vegetarian, so we made a few substitutions:

-water for the chicken broth
-fat free half&half for the cream
-fat free cheese
-Benecol for the butter

This resulted in a very low-fat soup that was delicious.  I also kept some of the potatos separate and boiled them with carrots and celery.  If you are making this version, you will most likely have to add quite a bit more salt to make up for the lack of broth.  Garlic helped quite a bit as well.  Great recipe!

The recipe was definitely spot on! It had layers of flavor and I enjoyed messing with it! A couple changes I made were instead of using Dill, which would be exceptional with the potatoes, I used some freshly chopped parsley and instead of adding the cheddar to the dish as a main ingredient, I added swiss for a better taste and garnished with more bacon!!! The picture was taken after all the cheese melted but when freshly served, it is superb!

Have made this recipe countless times and everyone loves it! I usually double the recipe otherwise it's gone right away. I omit the salt unless I take the time to caramelize the onions (it gives it a little something extra- but takes 20-30mins longer).  I would advise to save the addition of salt to the very end and add a little at a time if you need to. I did as other reviewers have and made a lb of bacon to start. Instead of using butter to cook the onions I substituted a little bacon fat. The first time I made this recipe using 5% cream, the next time I used half and half, and later tried 1% milk and it was great each time- though definitely a little thinner with the 1%. To counter  you can use a few extra potatoes to get the thickness.
 ***DO NOT TRY WITH 18% CREAM (aka table cream)- it came out way too rich almost too cheesy!!!!***  
As with most soups this one is even better the day after, so go on and make it ahead for an event.

Best ever. I have made it twice and plan on making it tomorrow. Grandkids love. The older ones bring it to lunch. That is a compliment if I ever heard one. I don't change the recipe at all.

Delicious!! I cut chicken broth down a little because I thought the flavor overwhelmed the soup (just added more water ~2c broth & 1water). Also, be careful not to salt much before adding the cheese. Really tasty! Will definitely be adding this to my winter menu rotation!!:)

What an excellent soup!  My husband and I prefer a chunkier soup though so I didn't puree the soup and I also added 1/2 tsp of dill instead of 1/4 tsp and cooked and crumbled up just a little bit of bacon to serve on top.  Will definitely be making this soup again!

This soup is absolutely delicious!  The only change I made was, like some other reviewers, I didn't puree the entire potato mixture - reserved some chunks for a chunkier soup.  Other than that, didn't change a thing.  Thanks for a great soup recipe!

I love this.  Last time I used homemade chicken broth and WOW it was even better.  Often I make with half & half since I usually do not have heavy cream in the house.  Pair this with fresh GF sour dough bread and top with bacon yummy comfort food

Amazing soup!  Rather than frying the onions in butter, I used the left over bacon grease.  Crumbled 4 slices of bacon in the soup.  Added 1/4 cup of sour cream and used Cajun Seasoning rather than Cayenne Pepper, since I had none available.

WOW! but I added a jalapeno and serrano with the onion and threw in some garlic powder, I also shamefully added extra cheese. Instead of blending I used a potato masher in order to leave some yummy chunkies. Topped with Bacon this was incredible!

Very good!  I've never made potato soup before and wouldn't eat my husband's "homemade" potato soup since it came from a mix which included chicken broth (I'm a vegetarian).  I used vegetable broth instead of chicken and not having heavy cream used 1/2 cup 1% milk and 1/2 cup light sour cream (it's what I had in the house) and quite a bit less cheese than it calls for, even thought I LOVE cheese I felt it was already really good without it (I didn't measure it, I just eyeballed it) and it was delicious.  Next time I think I might try pepper jack cheese instead for a little extra spice.  Will definitely be making this often this fall and winter.

Excellent!  Made this for dinner tonight and my husband, one-year old daughter, and I all loved it.  I've tried a lot of potato soup recipes before, and I think this one is probably the best!

Excellent recipe.  I made mine with Skim Milk instead of cream and it was still very good.  I also like to use about 1 C cheese and 1 can of Campbell's Cheddar Cheese soup.  Gives it a more restaurant-like quality for some reason.

Amazing recipe! I love creamy potatoe soup so I didnt leave any chunks of potatoes. I did add crispy bacon and chives for some sort of texture. I always triple the recipe and freeze it so my husband can heat it up anytime he wants. He cant stop talking about it after I make it!

This was a very good basic potato soup, and was easy to make. I did increase the dill to 1/2 teaspoon. The next time I make this I'll probably add some cooked pacetta at the very end.

I was looking for a quick, easy cheese soup, and this hit the mark!  I did modify to meet my own needs, though.  I added about 2c of leftover mashed potatoes and pureed with the onions with an immersion blender, and then I left the actual potatoes in tact.  I added 1 c sour cream and 4 oz cream cheese instead of the heavy cream.  I omitted the salt and dill (I don't care for dill), and I added about 1/8 tsp freshly ground nutmeg and mustard, and a few dashes of hot sauce.  I served with a few spinkles of cheese and chives.

It was OK. Thinner than I was hoping it would be, and not as cheesy as it sounds. I ended up almost doubling the amount of cheddar I put in.

So yummy! I made this last night for my husband and I and we both loved it. I used small red potatoes and they tasted so yummy in this soup. Next time I will try it with low fat milk (instead of cream) and low fat cheese to make it a little less calories. So good!

I just made this soup and it is yummy! I didn't have any dill, so omitted it. I also didn't have heavy cream so I used 1/2 sour cream and 1/2 milk. I left half of potatoes chunky because I like it like that. Other than that I followed exactly. Even my picky 10 yr old likes it! I will definitely make again, it was very easy.

Very, very good.  I liked that it wasn't too thick, or too thin.  My changes: no onion, added 1 clove garlic, and added 1 cup chopped carrot/celery mix.  I pureed with an immersion blender, but left some chunks.  Delicious.

Great soup! I test drove my immersion blender for this one and it worked beautifully. I agree, the dill and cayenne do work perfectly together. Thanks for the recipe.

This recipe was excellent. I didn't puree the potatoes just smashed them. I also didn't have cayene pepper so I sprinkled some paprika. My husband loved it. It's also a fairly simple recipe.

I love this! I added 2 extra cups of chicken broth, 2 extra cups of potatoes, and used half and half instead of cream. I also added two teaspoons of ham base/bullion and eliminated the dill weed.  Yes, I changed up the recipe, but it's a fantastic base recipe!

I am a huge fan of this recipe, and since finding it have made it several times already.  I use lowfat milk rather than the heavy cream and I never measure my cheese, so is probably less.  Still qualifies as the cheesiest soup though.  It is incredible.  I think the dill gets all the credit...well and the little kick from the cayenne.  Thanks for the great recipe.  I'd make this once a week if I thought I could get away with it!

Very good soup! Made a few of the changes the other reviewer posted and my guest loved it. The only problem I had was due to my gas stove. I had it on low on the smallest heat level and it still got a rolling boil and caused the cheese to separate. Still tasted good just not pretty!

Very good! I made this for an autumn party and it fit the bill. Next time I may have a side bar with different soup "accessories". the soup tasted good but I felt it needed some bacon bits or chives or SOMETHING else.

Fantastic potato soup!  My husband doesn't like dill so we omit it, but it is wonderful even without the flavor.  I also keep about 1/2 of the potatoes in chunks, rather than pureeing them. Comes out great every time!

This was my first attempt at making potato soup and it tasted great! I did follow the advice of others and added a little flour to thicken it up a bit. We topped with bacon and cheese. Will deff make this again! Thanks for a great recipe :)

Perhaps it would do, if you left out the dill. You also DO have to put it in a blender, or it does this weird thing where the cheese clumps on your ladle, and just keeps getting bigger. Then, since you did put in blender, it's JUST liquid, no chunks of potatoes like we like. The dill was SO bad in this, I made a second batch, without it, then combined the two, and it was still ruined!

I wanted a crock pot recipe for a cheese potato soup, so i adapted this one.  I cooked the onions as directed and then I added the onions, potatos, spices and chicken broth to a crock pot and allowed the potatos to cook all day.  I also added choped fresh garlic and garlic powder.  30 minutes prior to eating I used the blender to mash up half of the potatos added the milk, cheese and some sour cream and let it cook on low for 30 minutes. I garnished with Bacon, scallions, cheese, and sour cream.  The soup was nice and thick.  A very good soup!!!

This soup was REALLY good! I did substitute garlic powder for the dill and veggie broth for the chicken broth. Like other reviews suggested, I also "reserved" half of the potato chunks and used a hand masher on the rest, instead of using the blender. The soup was not as creamy as I would like it to be (even after cooking longer) so I added some instant potato buds like a previous reviewer suggested which did the trick. I think next time I will add a few tablespoons of flour before adding the stock to see if that works. I also made it "loaded" by added some crumbled bacon, chopped scallions and shredded cheddar. Scored a 4/5 because of my changes but will DEFINITELY make again! Thanks for the great recipe!! UPDATE** Made this recipe again and used 3 cups potato and added 4 tbsp flour after the onions were softened and it REALLY thickened the soup up. Was able to leave out the fake mashed potatoes this time!

Great hearty potato soup. I only pureed half of the potatoes because I prefer it chunky.

A good recipe!  I will likely do a little more with the seasoning...it was a tiny bit bland; but overall, and excellent recipe!

I was very pleased with this soup.  I doubled the recipe and used Cooper Sharp American and a mixture of Chedder and Montery Jack - and added just a bit more than the recipe called for - it really thickened it up.  It was amazing!  A keeper.

This is a very hearty, delicious soup!  Exactly what I was looking for.  I use Yukon Gold potatoes and double the recipe.  Reheats nicely and reminds me of the Claim Jumper restaurant potato cheddar soup. Thank you for the recipe!

Fantastic! I used fat free half and half (my newest favorite thing!) and vegetable broth to make it vegetarian. My boyfriend couldn't get enough, it was perfect for a cold winter day, thank you!

This is a great recipe; however, because we have a dairy allergy in the family, I had to make a couple of changes. Since we can't do heavy cream or cheese, I added in a tub of Better Than Cream Cheese and a half tub of Better Than Sour Cream (by Tofutti). This made a GREAT flavor! Then, those who could have cheese added some grated Colby cheese into their bowls. I also add in chives and garlic. I doubled the batch and it was GONE! I have made this soup several times now and have to make more each time!

Oh my gosh this soup was amazing! I didn't have heavy cream so I didn't use it. I have tried it with it and without and i prefer it without. I add more cheese and I also add bacon. I cook extra potatoes take some out then puree it and add it back in so it has some potato pieces. I will make it again. My husband is always asking me to make this and I am always getting asked for the recipe. I have been looking for a good cheese potato soup, and I found it. THANKS!!!

Excellent recipe!  However I felt portions were very small (as main course) I will double it next time.  I was out of dill so I substituted a dill romano cheese.  Excellent but I'm looking forward to using sharp chedder and fresh dill.

I have done this one several times and miss only a sour dough bread bowel to go with it. Use sea salt, put 2 whole garlic cloves in to simmer while the potatoes cook and use creme fresche instead of heavy cream. Garnish with a sprinkle of bacon and something colourful (parsly of so). enjoy.

this soup is the best! my boyfriend requests this almost on a weekly basis, and my friends and family beg me to make it for them. i make the recipe pretty much as it calls for, sometimes i add a little more cream or a little more broth, depending on how thick or thin i feel like having it. sometimes i used half & half instead of cream, if that's all i have on hand. i like to add a little more cayenne because i love the kick. and i always add bacon bits, sour cream, and green onions on top!

OUTSTANDING!!!!  We LOVED this soup, like the others said, be sure and at least double the recipe!
I added a few things, I had doubled the recipe and added about 4 cloves of garlic, I also added finely chopped celery! If you like lots of potato, be sure and add more, I added about 3 cups more. I also didnt blend  the mixture like it stated, I gently mashed it up a bitgave it a real kick by frying up a package of bacon and added it to the soup. Try it! You will have happy tummys!

This has been a go-to cold weather comfort dish for several years. While I haven't made any significant changes, I don't puree the potatoes. Rather, I leave them cubed, so a spoonful is more of a mouthful. Also, I add diced ham at the tail end of prep. I guess my version is maybe more of a chowder. I love the dill and cayenne, though. I think that really makes this soup.

Nice! Easy! THICK! I really liked this recipe. I made some minor changes -- used veggie broth, added some white wine, used fresh dill (makes a nice difference), and sauteed some celergy in with the onions to add flavour as well. I also used a combo of cheddar and swiss cheeses, and topped with just a little herbed havarti. This recipe allows you to make these kinds of changes based on what you have in your fridge, which really works for me!

This was great!  I also mashed the potatoes instead of pureeing, added some crushed garlic to the onion, used s/c and milk w/a touch of heavy cream.

After mashing the potatoes, I also added cubed kielbasa (I'm sure ham would be delicous as well) and then topped each bowl w/more cheddar and some chopped scallions.

I gave this 5 stars even though I tweaked the recipe because I think it's a great, easy base recipe.

Thanks Sara!

This soup was good, but it lacked substance.  (It's a great pureed soup, if that's what you're shooting for).  We added a can of drained corn near the end.  I don't know - it just wasn't hearty.  Thanks for the recipe though, we enjoyed it.

This soup was yummy. The next time I made it I had a little bit of salmon left over from dinner and thought that with the dill it might be really good -- and guess what? IT WAS! I'm not usually crazy about any type of soup with fish in it but this, along with the dill, was delicious. I only had about 1/3 cup of salmon and that was just the right amount.

This was a great basic recipe, but of course, I changed it a bit. I used red potatoes, so I didn't peel them (the skin is the best part!). I also did not puree them... I like the chunkiness of the potatoes, so they stayed diced. Also, I used 2 cups of cheddar and 1 of monterrey jack... so I added an extra cup of chicken broth (I used an entire box of Swanson's broth--perfect amount!) and used 1 cup of Half & Half instead of the cream... with all those changes, the soup was a perfect creamy, cheesy consistancy, without being too thick. My husband and I both ate a big bowl for dinner and had some the next day for lunch. Yum!

delicious!  I added a cup of celery, garlic powder, and onion powder to the onions, as mentioned from another reviewer.  I didn't put the potatoes in the blender because it sounded odd, but next time I will definitly cut the potatoes a lot smaller.

This soup was excellent Sara. I used all of the ingredients, however, I didn't follow the amounts. I used more potatoes and broth than suggested which resulted in a beautiful thick soup. I started by cooking bacon in the soup pot, draining and then proceeded from there. Wonderful and loved by everyone. Thanks so much!

This soup was delicious!  I sauteed garlic and celery along with onions.  I substituted one cup of beer (Bass) for one cup of the chicken broth.  I used regular cheddar instead of sharp cheddar, because it was what we had on hand.  Based on other reviews, I was going to leave out the salt, but found that I needed to include it, probably because the chicken broth I used was low-sodium.  I will definitely make this soup again.

Even though it was a tiny bit too salty, it was still the best potato soup I've ever had!! Next time I will use low sodium broth. I did alter the ingredients to make it vegetarian and a little less fattening. I used veggie broth in place of chicken, added a little minced garlic to the onions, 1/2 cup of lowfat milk and 1/2 cup lowfat sour cream in place of the heavy cream, and used a mix of havarti and cheddar. Even without the heavy cream I thought the consistency was perfect, not too thin at all. One of the best soups ever.

My husband couldn't get enough of this!  It definitely needed toppings added to make it a "too die for" meal.  We topped with bacon and extra cheese.  I followed the advice of others about using the handmasher.  Plus, I omitted the dill.  I will make this again and again.   It's a keeper!

Cheesy, good flavor.  Take the advice of other reviewers and don't puree the potatoes - leave them chunky.  Did not have dill so omitted it and the soup was good without it.  Will make again.

Great recipe.  Very easy to make.  I even cheated and used cubed hash browns.  And as some others suggested, I just mashed them up a little bit with a hand masher, because I liked the chunks.  Double the recipe because you will want leftovers and it was great reheated!

This recipe was very good. I served it with popcorn and a crusty, hot ciabatta. I will definitely make it again....and may even try substituting some of the chicken broth with beer to make a potato beer cheese soup.

Terrific recipe!  My husband loved it! It was my first try at making potato soup and it worked out great.  I used a white sharp cheddar and it was really tasty!  I did skip the dill as I'm not a fan.

This reminds me of the days my mother made her potato soup that you couldnt get enough of.  I would suggest making more as the six servings is a little skimpy, however tasty to the very last drop!!!

My favorite potato soup recipe! I do make changes, though. I hate dill, so I eliminate that. I also add an extra chicken bouillon cube, as well as a tsp. or two of ham base, and then I reduce the salt. Lots and lots of black pepper, cayenne, and extra cheese. My husband likes chunks of potato, so I don't puree it - I just use a potato masher and lightly mash to make it mostly smooth with some texture. SO GOOD!

This is an excellent soup for the pickiest of eaters.

I doubled the dill, and didn't put ALL the potatoes in the food processor, we like it a little chunky. The whole family ate it, even my husband who hates onions and my youngest who "doesn't like soup."

This potato soup was very easy to make.  My daughter and I tasted it before we added the cheese, and it tasted great.  If you are not a cheese fan, this recipe is still a keeper.  However, when we added the cheese, the recipe went from great to phenomenal!  I will definitely be making this recipe again.

Really great potato soup recipe! I didn't puree the potatoes, just left them diced because I like a chunky soup, and thickened it with a little cornstarch. The flavour of the cheese (I used light old cheddar), cayenne, and dill was really tasty. Fiance thought a potato/cheese soup didn't sound very appetizing but he had a second bowl. ??

This is GREAT! And so easy to make to be so delicious! I hate people like me who say it’s fantastic, then change 5 things, but I’m a vegetarian who can’t eat Cheddar or any aged cheese (migraines). So two small changes:  I used 3 cups of vegetarian broth instead of chicken and use a Colby Jack blend (though Cheddar would be better). Of course, I used full cream and real butter! I used red potatoes (the recipe didn’t specify & I looked up “good potatoes for soup” online. Thanks for a soup recipe I’ll make often.

I followed other reviewers' advice and added bacon and used a potato masher instead of pureeing the entire thing. It is a winter staple in our house. Hearty and delish!

Very very good. I love the little hint of spicy the ceyanne pepper gives.  My kids enjoyed it too so dont be worried it will be too spicy. This soup is a little thinner than other potato soups so it was delicious with a loaf of garlic bread.  I'll make this again for sure.  I followed the recipe exactly & ended up only adding a touch more salt at the end.

I tripled this recipe to make sure that we had plenty for leftovers and I'm glad I did. It was very good. My wife, son, and I all loved it. I put half of the mixture in the food processor and left plenty of potatoes in the pot. Next time I prepare this recipe, based on my wife's preferences, I won't blend the mixture at all. We like the diced potatoes to keep their shape, suggesting that the recipe really is potato soup. My wife commented on the dill as a nice twist. The cayenne pepper was in a volume too small to detect it. Consider increasing the cayenne pepper volume next time. Here's a tip to assist you in getting the mixture from the pot to the food processor: Use a slotted spoon and transfer the potatoes you want first; then, use a cup to transfer just enough liquid to assist in blending. That's cleaner and easier than trying to pour a huge pot into the food processor.

I love this soup and look forward to cooler weather every year just so that I can make it!  I follow the recipe as written and it turns out great every time.  Sometimes I can find the small sourdough bread bowls at the grocery store and will serve it individually in those -- yum!  But usually we eat this soup with some bread to go with it.  And I like to have some crumbled bacon on hand to sprinkle on top of my soup.

Everytime I've ever made potato soup, I've used a different recipe because I couldn't find the "one".  I feel like I've found it.  I followed the recipe as stated.  Loved the smoothness created by pureeing and the heavy cream addition.  I doubled the recipe to ensure leftovers.

Just made this and I think I'm in love.  I followed the directions exactly, with the exception of using olive oil instead of butter, and using 4 cups of broth instead of 3.  I'm currently on a soft food diet due to surgery, and this recipe was perfect.

Great, great, great recipe! I'm a big fan of potato soup! This was one of the best cheesy potatoes soup recipes I have tried, thanks!

This was delicious! I followed the recipe pretty closely, although I tripled the recipe and added 2 cans of Campbells cheddar soup, as some of the other reviewers suggested. I also cooked bacon to use as a garnish and sautéed the onions in a bit of the bacon drippings. I also followed the recommendation to take out about half the potatoes before blending (I used a stick blender) in order to keep some texture. This soup was extremely flavorful. I will make it again. The adults all loved it and appreciated all the flavor. The kids didn't care for it, though, and several of our friends' kids wouldn't eat it at all. So maybe it's more of a grown up potato soup?

Absolutely love this recipe. I have made it several times since finding it. Instead of half and half I use whole milk. I also saute garlic with the onions in the beginning. I omit dill and put a pinch of paprika instead of cayenne. I also cook 2 potatoes and chop them putting them in at the end to make it chunky. sprinkle with bacon bits. Amazing. My very picky husband even takes it to work for lunch.  Thank you!

I used home made chicken stock, although used half of what the recipe called for, plus I used milk instead of cream, and more than what the recipe called for.  I omitted the dill.  That just seemed to me to be too over powering a flavor that would mask the cheesy potato flavor we wanted.  I did add a small amount of diced ham.   We ate it chunky style, not in the blender.

I don't eat meat so I substituted vegetable broth for the chicken broth. I also added some freeze dried chives. I garnished it with cheese and some of the chives. Delicious!

I will definitely make this again. However next time I will add a bit more Cayenne Pepper or Creole Seasoning. When I added I bit more spice to my individual serving, it seemed to bring it to life a bit more.  Other than that a good soup.

I have been making this soup for several years and it is a family favorite.  The only thing I change is I separately boil about 2 cups of diced potatoes in a separate pot of chicken broth, drain and add when soup is done.  Our family likes getting pieces of potato in with it.  Great Recipe!

I used unsweetened almond milk instead of the cream, it was very easy to make, the easiest potato soup I've ever made.  I let the potatoes cook in the broth and set it aside because I decided to make biscuits.  Turned out amazing, didn't add dill or cayenne, added diced celery.  I cooked chicken in pan, waited until the last minute and stirred it in.  Even my picky husband liked this!  Added green onion, cheese & crispy bacon crushed on top.  amazing!

I really liked this recipe. But of course I did a little changing. I fried bacon and set aside then cooked the onions in the bacon grease. I also had more potatoes so I added more half and half and broth. I didn't purée it, I only used my immersion blender so there was some chunks left. I also used 16 oz of cheese that I grated but I did have more soup to add cheese too. I didn't add dill weed or cayenne pepper and didn't miss it. The whole family loved it.

I followed the recipe closely with maybe an extra pinch of the spices. I mashed the potatoes instead of blending mostly for ease but both my husband and I enjoyed the chunky texture. Very hearty filling soup, can't wait to make this as it gets colder!

I changed it a bit, I put more carrot, celery and some garlic in. Then I mashed the potatoes until they were bitty, added some cream, added fresh cut potato with the skin left on, let it cook through until tender, added some brocollini and the cheese. For the cheese I used colby jack and parmesan.............oh and a few chilli flakes.

Served with home made sourdough bread............YUMMO!

I have made this soup twice in 1 week.  The second time I gave a container of it to my daughter and her husband cause I wanted their opin ion.  They raved about it.  A lot of people think soup is only for cold weather.  This soup is so tasty and delicious I could eat it every week regardless of the weather.  I highly recommend it.

This is an awesome recipe. I didn't put in onions because my dad can't have them. I only put in 1 cup of cheese instead of 1 3/4 cup. I don't like dill so I didn't put that in. I think it needed bacon. And I would also suggest adding broccoli. I didn't  put salt or pepper in it because I wanted my family to put whatever they wanted in it. I did notice that nobody put salt in. Everybody put pepper in though. I didn't put in cayenne in either. I tried to make it after I came home from ballet at 5:45PM so I could try to have it on the table before 6:30. That didn't go as I thought it would. It took be longer then 45 minutes to make. I suggest making it an hour before serving. Just my opinion.

Just 1 3/4 cup cheese? I thought it was the cheesiest.... No no no, it doesn't have to stop there. To make it the cheesiest, you have to add more cheese than you did before, and before you know it, you're just eating plain cheese ;)

Ok so after it was done I made the mistake of trying to use the hand held immersion blender stick. The hot soup splattered me. I quickly moved to plan b. I cupped the soup into my NINJA. It overpowered the soup making it gloppy and smooth. I put it all back in the pot adding a smile more chicken broth and followed through with the rest of instructions. OMG AMAZING SOUP !!

This is now my favorite potato soup! I omitted the onion as I react badly to it, but it was still fantastic! The spices are right on! I topped with bacon bits and extra shredded cheddar. Next time I will double or triple so I can share :)

This is hands down the best potato soup I have ever made. My family loves this soup. I made a few changes instead of heavy cream I used sour cream and milk. Plus I added some flour to help thicken up the soup.

This was the perfect dish that my girlfriend was craving while she had the flu.  Not too smooth but not too thick either, with a perfect heat to it: just enough to make your nose run.  I will be cooking this again!

I started making this for my family last fall.  We are all so exited to have it again this fall. It is definitely a family favorite here. I add extra cheese and use red or yellow potatos and keep the skin on. I put all the ingredients in my crock pot and cook 4 hours on high then use an old fashioned potato masher and just mash it a little so it is chunky. Excellent!

One of the best Potatoe soups I've had. Did change it up a bit. Made a double batch separated 1 1/2 cups of the potato mixture before the mixture was puréed  once it was puréed I added it back for a little texture. Also added bacon bits as well.  Served the soup in a sour dough bread bowl - ENJOY!!

Amazing and extremely flavorful! :) I substituted with red potatoes, red onion, and used 2 slices of pepper jack and a little less cheddar. I also added a smidge of turmeric. Wonderful recipe and definitely a keeper.

I absolutely adore Creamy Potato soup, but more often than not, there's just a little something that I don't quite like, so I wanted to make my own.  I scoured this site for recipes and finally decided to try this one.  I made a larger batch because the only potatoes I had in the house were frozen Ore Ida potato mashers.  I simply dumped the bag of frozen taters in the pot, added an extra cup of broth and simmered for 45 minutes.  I then pureed the mixture, added a little extra seasoning, cream and cheese and - Oh my gosh!!! This soup is AMAZING!!!

Made this soup per recipe with the following additions:  When adding cream and cheese part, added a small handful of green onions and bacon.  Also garnished with additional cheese, bacon and green onions.  Excellent result.  One of the best recipes for potato soup I've tried.  Thanks for sharing sal!

This recipe, I thought, was too thin and bland the first time I tried following the recipe exactly.  The second time I made this, I changed a couple of things:  added 1/2 C of Baked honey ham cubed, 1 10.5 Oz can of Cream of Chicken instead if the chicken broth, and another 1/2 tsp of salt.  My kids and husband agreed that it tasted better and was creamier.

Oh MAN this soup is good!  I added some garlic to the onions which cooking, used vegetable broth and replaced the heavy cream with some Greek yogurt and a bit of milk.  I seasoned only with salt and pepper (no cayenne or dill because I just wasn't feeling it).  I don't think I used quite as much cheese either.  As others suggested, I used a potato masher rather than an immersion blender to leave some chunks.  I will be making this again!

Actually a question without having to read all the gorgeous reviews (making me salivate).  Is this adjustable to a slow-cooker?  and if so, does someone know how?
No matter what, I am looking forward to trying it!  Me and my DH LOVE Cheesy Potato Soup and this looks delicious.
Thank you@

Very good.  I added garlic powder and extra pepper, but that's just me.  I also added a little diced smoked ham, some deli meat I had in the fridge.  Will follow this recipe in the future because it's simple and yummy.

Love, love it! I reduce the pepper for the little tykes but it is by far the best potato soup ever! I do cheat and add dehydrated onions to the broth occasionally and I have used canned diced potatoes when I'm in a hurry. I like it chunky so I never puree or mash up my potatoes. Yum!!

This was very good! I didn't have enough cheese so I used the rest of the mozarella I had and used some cheese sauce too. I didn't purée the potatoes- I left them chopped. Everyone liked it!

This is literally the best potato soup I've ever had!  I've made this at least a dozen times already.  I usually don't use as much cheese as the recipe states (maybe 1/2 to 3/4 the amount) and it still turns out AMAZING!  I also don't puree the potato/onion mixture because I like mine with a more chunky consistently. I use a mashed potato masher to mash the mixture up a bit and the texture is great!  Super tasty and super easy!

I sautéed one diced carrot and a clove of garlic ( next time will adding 2 cloves) in onion.. I used one cup of water and 2 cup of chicken broth because I didn't  have 3 cups of broth.. I also removed half of the potatoes to be puréed...  I used 1/2 cup heavy cream and 1/2 cup whole milk and served with bread... It was very delicious..... Will definitely making again

omgosh this is delicious.  My first time making any type of potato soup and this was so easy and yummy.  The only thing I did different is left the potato and onion chunky for some texture...but followed the ingredients to a "tee".  I will definitely make this again and again.

I wanted to try a new recipe for potato soup, the flavor was just ok. I did like the dill, but not the puréed potato. The texture took away to much for me made it taste kind of pasty. Stick with whole potato..

I made this recipe as printed except used only 1/2 cup cream and 1/2 cup 2% milk.  I didn't blend it up because hubby doesn't like it.  I did add some instant potato flakes at the end to thicken it up a bit.  Next time I will use a small amount of olive oil to fry onion, 2% milk for cream, and only 1 cup of cheese.  This is way too heavy on calories to have often.

Absolutely delicious!  Used shallots instead of onion (it's what I had on hand) and added a few drops of Worcestershire sauce, but otherwise made as listed.  Red Leicester cheese really added a nice sharp taste to the soup.  Thanks so much for posting!  :)

This is a great potato soup recipe. I have to say the Dill and Cayenne really make it unique and supply tons of wonderful flavor. Easy to prepare and delicious.

I'm a bit of a potato soup snob and I thought this was a good base. I did not peel the potatoes and I added an extra 3 tablespoons of butter to the onions, 3T of garlic powder and more of each spice- esp the pepper and cayenne. I also added about a 1/2 c cubed velveeta in place of the shredded cheese. I used half and half instead of cream and it turned out great. I also used a potato masher rather than blending the mix in order to keep some chunks. Topped with some green onions and it was fantastic!

I added a carrot, 2 stalks of celery, 2 cups of squash, 4 buillion cubes instead of broth, and upped the cheese and cream just a bit.  Delicious.  p.s.  be careful when adding the peppers.

This soup was amazing!  I followed the ingredients, adding in celery and carrots and puréed only about half of the potatoes as was suggested......and served with warmed hearty sourdough bread.  I doubled the recipe to see how it freezes for a quick and warm weeknight meal.  This is a new family favorite that will be made often this winter!  Thanks to all who have shared their custom tips...enjoy reading those, too.

My family and I loved this. Used Balderson's 2 year aged White Cheddar and added crispy bacon. It's like a delicious bowl of hot,cheesy mashed potatoes. Perfect on a rainy fall day.

This is a very good soup for a chilly fall day. I made this exactly as written and we loved it. We served it in bread bowls topped with cheddar, scallions and crumbled bacon. Next time I will try to lighten it up just a bit though and see if it holds up. Thanks!

Absolutely the best!  I didn't have dill weed so I used mural of spices, increased to 3 cups potatoes.  I double the recipe and it doesn't last more than 2 days in a household of 4!!  Awesome!

This recipe is great and super easy!!!! My fiance and I are grad students and are always looking for something quick and easy to make but something that will last for a couple days.  I doubled the recipe but also way more bacon (b/c my fiance loves bacon) but I also added some red crushed pepper flakes with it to add a little spice.  This really is a great recipe because it is super easy but also super tasty and perfect for that chilly day!!!!!!

Wow, wow, wow is all I can say. I've been looking for a great potato soup recipe...woo-wee! I didn't have
all the ingredients and it was still great! I used 3 c water with 2 chicken bullion cubes, so I didn't need salt, and used 3/4 c skim milk instead of cream. And I mashed the potatoes when they were tender just a little with a potato masher.  I also didn't use dill weed. As you can see from all the comments, you can tweak this recipe to your liking and it STILL comes out great! Thanks for this one sal!

This was great!  I added some shredded carrots and broccoli along with the onions, to add some vitamins in. :) My family really liked it!  They all asked if I had bread to eat it with, and I didn't, so I would suggest a good fresh, crusty bread for bread-loving families like mine. Like others, I also just smashed the potatoes right there in the pot instead of pureeing them. And instead of the cream, I used half sour cream, half milk. Great soup, thanks!

My family loved this recipe.  I also added bacon per other reviewers and browned the onions in the bacon drippings.  I didn't have any heavy cream on hand so I used a can of evaporated milk.  I also just used a potato masher in the pot instead of pureeing the potatoes. It was a little less "creamy" that way, but SOOO delicious!  Will definitely make again.  One note, I had to add a little milk to the soup for my one little bowl of leftovers the next day.  It got REALLLLLY thick overnight.  Was still fab though :)

Definitely very yummy soup.  I used red potatoes and only peeled half of the them. I also used real bacon as a topping, using the grease to brown my onions.  The two the suggestions I used were the potato masher.  I also substituted the cream for the sour cream and milk.  Very good.  Even on the second day!

This was SO yummy! I wanted to make a huge pot so I tripled the recipe. I made it as directed except that I added some hot sauce to "kick it up a notch" and I used a potato masher to keep it chunky. This will be made MANY more times in my house.

I found this recipe, as I was trying to find a dish to use up some potatoes we had in stock.  This is a FABULOUS and UBER DELICIOUS soup!!  I fried some bacon and cooked the onion in the bacon grease, as another user suggested.  It was AWESOME!!  Thank you so much for sharing this recipe!!

AMAZING! My fiance and I had potato/cheese soup on a vacation for the first time recently and we've been craving it ever since. This was great! He asked that I leave some potatoes chunky next time and of course, some bacon crumbled on top. Thanks so much for this recipe! I will be using it many more times. **Update: I have since made this recipe and left some potatoes aside before putting into the blender and mashed with a fork to leave chunks of potato in the soup. It left some chunks, but not enough. I then diced about 1/2 cup more of potatoes to set aside and then only slightly mashed them. Served it in a sourdough bread bowl, crumbled bacon and cheese on top. This is the ultimate!

This is my family's favorite recipe. I've made it several times for dinner as well as for potlucks and parties. I recommend leaving some chunks of potato in the soup to avoid too much of a liquid consistency. I sometimes dress it up with bacon bits and a dollop of sour cream. Yummy!

This is a pretty yummy soup.  I didn't have the cayenne or the dill on hand so I added garlic salt, garlic powder and a little more fresh ground black pepper. I used a medium cheddar because that is what I had on hand and also half and half instead of the heavy cream.  I added a large handful of bacon crumbles for the last 5 mintues.  It turned out really well and it was so QUICK and EASY to make. Delish.

What a yummy soup! I prepared it as written but I only had "taco" flavored cheddar that also included jack cheese. I also added a few slices of swiss cheese as well. The "taco" flavored cheese added a bit more spiciness and the swiss rounded out the flavors.   I used my immersion blender to puree but next time I think I will leave a bit of small diced potatoes in for texture. In all this is a great tasting and filling soup. Thanks for sharing!

I love this recipe!   Though I added one chopped carrot and one stalk of chopped celery to the onions. Also I cut down the chicken stock to one and a half cups and used one and a half cups beer.   Also I mash my potatoes in the pot rather than puree them. I like a slightly chunkier soup.  Very yummy and hearty soup!

My husband and I thought this recipe was fantastic! He's not even a dill fan, but the spices blended so nicely that the dill was in no way overpowering. As I did not want to puree the potatoes and preferred them whole, I diced the potatoes into approx. 1/4" pieces and then thickened the soup slightly with a small amount of a flour/water mixture. Topped off with extra cheese and some crumbled bacon pieces, this soup was absolutely as good, if not better, than any soup I've had in any restaurant! I will be making this soup for many years to come...thanks, sal!  :)

Good! I added bacon but kept everything else the same. A bit of a process: cooking bacon, peeling & chopping potatoes, boiling, blending. Lots of dishes but well worth it!

I love this recipe!  It is so easy and my boyfriend and friends love it!  I didn't have the hand mixer and didn't feel like transferring to a blender so i boiled the potato a little longer and used a potato masher and it requires a little extra effort but still works well.  This soup is one of my all time favorite recipes!

My husband and friends loved this soup! The only complaint was for it to be thicker. Next time I will not use our food processer and mash the potatoes by hand. I hope that will thicken it up. As for the ingredients...they were perfect and so easy!

This was just fantastic soup.  I'm a mediocre cook at best and this was so EASY!  I looked at the other reviews and did mash up the potatoes so much so that it would be chunky.  I served it up it bowls with chives, cheese and bacon.  At least as good as any restaurant baked potato soup at $5.00 a serving for sure!

This is the BEST potato cheese soup you will find, and so wonderfully easy to make. The only thing I change once in a while is to use pepper jack cheese for more zing.

Wow, I read reviews ALL of the time but this is the first I've ever submitted! This soup is AMAZING! I followed the recipe EXACTLY, but added a tad more cayenne as well as garlic powder. At the end I added some leftover shredded pot roast. It was a meal and it was so flavorful, velvety and smooth! Perfect! What a great base to add to! Bacon, Ham, Chicken, Beef! Great recipe!

Wonderful!  I was craving a loaded potato soup from a local restaurant and looked for something similar.  This beat it!  My husband, who likes soup but is still disappointed whenever I say we are having soup for dinner, said it was the best soup he has ever eaten.  He said he even liked it more than chili.   I am not one to alter recipes, but I forgot to pick up cream.  I used a cup of milk and four tablespoons of butter based on a substitution list.  I just wished I had doubled the recipe because there is not even a full bowlfull left.  Try it - you'll like it!

This was an excellent comfort soup.  I used half and half instead of heavy cream to cut some calories out.  My family loved it.  I did add more potatoes and did not puree all of them so I had some cubed potates in the soup.  I also added chopped cooked carrots and celery at the end for a chunkier version.  One thing I loved about this soup is it holds up well in the refrigerator.  It did not get clumpy like other cheese soups I have made.

Great soup! I've made this soup many times, and this is my favorite version so far. I crisp some bacon first, which I first cut into small pieces to make it easier. I then cook the onions with some garlic (I use a lot of garlic, but use as much or as little as you want) in the fat after removing the crisped bacon. While the onion cooks, I cut up the potato and squeeze half a lemon on top to keep it from browning. About a minute before adding the potatoes and broth, I add the spices to the onions to allow them to bloom. While the potatoes cook, I steam some broccoli. After blending the soup, adding the cream, and melting the cheese, I add the broccoli and squeeze the other half of the lemon into the soup to brighten it. If you don't like as much of a lemon taste, just squeeze a little bit. The lemon really brings out he flavors. I garnish with the bacon and some left over cheese.  Additional note: I initially crisp the bacon and cook the onions, garlic, and spices in a cast iron pan and then transfer them to a large pot to make the soup. However, you can certainly do everything in one pot if you'd rather.

Delicious and super easy! Did not use the blender or processor - just mashed the potatoes with a masher and it was fine.
Served with lots of bacon bits on top and green onions. Rave reviews from the husband too!

This recipe was very good.  I didn't puree the potatoes, I used a potato masher and slightly smashed some of the potatoes to make the soup thicker, it was so yummy!! I will definately make it again.

This was a fantastic soup.  I doubled the dill for more flavor and served it in bread bowls.  I made this for a dinner party, and one of my friends said that this was the best potato soup that she had ever eaten.  Most of us had three helpings!

Great tasting soup!  This is great comfort food.  I like to add extra onions and chicken bouillon (not water) for extra flavor.  I also add garlic and sour cream as suggested by another.

used one can condensed cream of chicken soup instead of heavy creme and milk instead of chicken broth. Popular with my family. It's delicious.

This potato soup is awesome. The only thing i did was double it and leave about 1/4 of the potatoes cubed. Oh yes and probably a little more cheese. It was awesome!

This is a good potato soup.  The cream makes it a little heavy.  The seasonings are good, but I think it would really benefit from some bacon or ham.

Wouldn't exactly call it the "cheesiest", but it is good.  I didn't have cayenne, so I used some cajun seasoning.

This is the first Potato Soup that I made that I liked.  It was thick and had a very good flavor.  I will make it again.

I read a few reviews, decided that I would use Veggie stock instead of chicken broth, and that I would use Half and Half instead of heavy cream.  I couldn't find any dried basil, or healthy looking fresh basil at my K.Roger so I also ommitted that.  I made this (as someone else suggested) with Foccacio bread recipe from this site.  I also made spinach calzones from a recipe I got from this site to go with the soup.  My boyfriend enjoyed the soup, but I thought it was aweful.  He said it tasted just like potato soup, if not better than usual.  My roommate told me to save the leftovers for her, so I'm giving this 4-Stars since potentially 66% of the people who tried it, enjoyed it!  I think I expected it to be much more thick, and it wasn't.  Maybe I should have just followed the recipe to the "T" and I wouldn't have been as disappointed.

Very good Recipe!I had to substitute chives for dill weed and a few drops of hot sauce for cayenne pepper, but it still turned out great!! I will be using this recipe again.

I really try to make recipes AS THEY ARE WRITTEN before review.  But, with nightmares of my mom's potato soup, I left out the onion.  I also left a few pieces of tater out of the puree step.  We served these in bread bowls.  That was a lot of fun!!   YUMMY.
