I was skeptical with the dill as I needed something to go with my Mexican Bake. I didnâ€™t know if dill and cumin would mix well. This recipe was phenomenal! People were even scraping the bottom to take what was left!

This turned out really good. I very much enjoyed the combo of dill and cumin together in this. The only change I'd make next time is to cut the roasting time some. It was perfect and still had a little crunch at 20 but got a little overdone for us in those final 5 minutes. Great recipe! Thanks for sharing!
