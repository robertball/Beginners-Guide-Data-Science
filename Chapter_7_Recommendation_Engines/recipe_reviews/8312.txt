I've been making this recipe for years.  The only thing is that it says to bake for 40 minutes. I live in Colorado and it only takes 30 minutes, just something to keep in mind for your elevation.  It will scorch here in 40 min. Someone said the cake had too much of a flour taste. Not true if you follow the directions and remember what elevation you're at.  Take it from me, this is an awesome recipe.  A friend said it wasn't sweet enough. It calls for unsweetened cocoa and that's what you get. It's also a flavor my family likes.  If you want it sweeter then use a sweet cocoa. Whatever kind of cocoa you put into this recipe is the kind of flavor you will get.  It just makes sense.  It will be good whatever you use. Just remember to use the exact measurement of ingredients it calls for, you can't go wrong.  So, I'm thanking you for this recipe!  It's awesome and just asking others to remember where you live and what ingredients work for your elevation.  I sign off as old hand at baking and trying to give sound advice.

Yummmmmmmmmmm... this was delicious! I just finished a piece, and this "cake" turned out to be exactly what I wanted it to be: light but still chocolatey, gooey, and so delicious! It's not like a full-fat dessert thats extremely rich and heavy. My alterations: upped the cocoa to 1/3 cup, little extra vanilla for flavor, a hand-full of chocolate chips, and used hot milk instead of water.  Make and enjoy!!

Oh my gosh!! Chocolate heaven!! I NEVER double a recipe the first time I make it, but I'm glad I did this time. It would have all been gone in minutes. I didn't have a 9" square pan, so I doubled it. It was a nice fit into a 13x9. Just the right sweetness. I served it with whipped topping. It looked as good as it tasted. Thanks for sharing this.

This can also be made in the microwave!
Mix the dry ingredients in a glass 2 quart bowl.  Add the other ingredients as listed.  Then microwave at 50% power for 9 minutes, turn dish, then cook high power for 5 - 7 minutes, until the top appears dry.

Delicious with ice cream!

Wonderful as all have said.  One good point is that the cake batter is so thick it can be difficult to spread evenly in the pan.  Using clean hands, lightly dip fingers in water and you can spread the batter by gently "pushing" and distributing it in the pan.

This cake was very quick and easy, made with common pantry items.  The cake is dense, with a slightly crispy crust, with a pudding like layer below.  It was good the next day as well, just pop in the microwave.  My husband and sons loved the intense chocolate flavor, I'll make this one again!!

I cooked half the amount for 20mins.  Both the husband and I liked this but wanted it to be more cake so would cook it longer in future.

o.my.word is this amazing!  i was  a little concerned as i was preparing, looking at it, it really seems weird - - but it baked up into a fabulous dessert!  it has a nice chocolate cake crust on top, underneath is a wonderful warm chocolate sauce.  even eating it cold from the fridge the next day, it is still superb.  great for something different!

Wow, this was really bad. I followed the directions exactly, I don't get how it got so many good reviews. Bland taste, weird texture - not even smothering it in ice cream could save it. If you're someone who likes rich, chocolately desserts that actually taste like chocolate (and you know what I mean) stay far, far away.

Quite tasty, good for a quick family pudding but I wouldn't serve it up at a dinner party (not that I have too many of those). Love the fact that its made in the same bowl its baked in. I have 3 males to feed so next time I'll double the recipe and try add a little more water, I would prefer a thinner sauce.

Love this pudding cake and have made it many times before.  I have started adding 1 or 2 extra teaspoons of cocoa to the mix plus a teaspoon of espresso powder.  I also an extra 1/4 of water as I like more sauce.

This recipe reminds me of the molten lava cake at Chili's.  DELICIOUS!  Although I HIGHLY recomend increasing salt to 1 teaspoon and the water to 1 3/4 c to compensate.  I've eaten the recipe both ways and the chocolate is much richer with the alterations.  I love chocolate and always get TONS of compliments when I make this.  Everyone wants the recipe!!!

What a treat!  Only changes I made were to substitute unsweetened applesauce for the vegetable oil and decrease the brown sugar to 2/3 cup.  Delicious and so easy to make.  It's nice that there are no "special" ingredients required; just regular pantry items.  Have made this several times and it's always well received.  Thanks, INDIT!

Very good!  I mixed this up and popped it in the oven as we sat down to eat.  It was done and ready for our dessert.  I served it with vanilla ice cream. Yum!  My son stopped by for dinner and was happy to have a homemade chocolatey dessert.

This cake was amazing!  You couldn't tell that it is low-fat... probably because it has more sugar than flour!  I doubled the recipe and baked in a 9x13 pan for 37 mins and it came out just fine.  I added 1 cup chocolate chips to the batter (folded in at the end), used 3t of vanilla extract, and skim milk instead of water for the pudding part.  It was excellent!  I wouldn't change a thing from what I did!

This is basically the same recipe my great-grandmother used.  It's chocolatey, old-timey, and it reminds me of happy childhood memories. A while ago I lost my copy of the recipe and went hunting online for it.  I've tried versions of this that used chocolate chips, and I like that addition. (Use about 1/4 cup of semi-sweet, miniature, high end chips, and sprinkle on top before you pour the water). The only improvement to this recipe I can think of is to use vanilla bean paste instead of the extract (1:1), and use mixing bowls. One to make the cake batter, and a 2nd to mix the brown sugar and cocoa.  Then, pour the cocoa/brown sugar on top, and then cover that with hot water.  I tried preparing this as described here and it was a mess. I spilled flour and cocoa powder on my counter and floor because I barely had room in my baking dish to stir.  When I transferred the dry cake ingredients to a mixing bowl, I found that the entire bottom of the pan was unblended flour.  Now I understand all the negative "it tastes like flour" reviews. To properly blend the brown sugar and cocoa powder, use a proper mixing bowl and blend with a whisk or fork.  When doubling, bake until you can see by poking it with a knife, that the cake is cooked.  It takes me about 50 minutes to bake a doubled batch at sea level.

This was good The ONLY change I made was to use 1/2 brown sugar and 1/2 white sugar in the topping instead of all brown sugar (personal preference). It was rich and fudge-y and after letting it sit a few minutes, the sauce was wonderful and thick. Dee-lish!!!! Be careful if doubling, though - my dish was not big enough and it overflowed all over my oven and burned badly. Had to use the self-clean feature for 4 hours! LOL

Floury, gluey, tasteless. Definitely would not make this one again. Also, for those at high altitude, consider baking for even less than 30 minutes.

I have made this version and a few others. All have been very good for their ease in making and the gooey yumminess. I prefer to replace some of the brown sugar with additional white, which tastes a tiny less sweet, and prefer the recipes that don't use more than 3/4 cup sugar in the batter & the sauce. This is excellant as is...don't be tempted to increase the cocoa...it is very chocolatey. You can increase the water (or use milk) by 1/4 cup or so for a saucier result. The 1- 1/2 cup amount of liquid makes a pudding layer of the thickness of stirred pudding.

Oh, this is delicious. I added a tbsp of instant coffee to the boiling water... yum. I ate almost half of this myself. It is addicting! Do not make if you are on a diet :)

The color of brown is the only clue that it has chocolate and I use the word chocolate loosely. Cake is not meant to be CRUNCHY! I will not be making this again.

Although this is good, incredibly easy to make, and looks very delicious beside ice-cream I found it to be a bit lackluster when it came to sweetness.  It was not very sweet at all- which I know some people enjoy- but in a cake I really want it to be sweet and succulent.  Next time I'll increase the sugar amount a bit and see if I can't make it a bit better.  But, on the plus side, even with it's lack of sweetness the texture and overall flavor goes perfectly with vanilla ice cream!

Love this! Not only is it delicious it is quick, cheap, low calorie AND makes no mess! I see why the directions say to stir with a fork because the dough does get very sticky, like biscuit dough, but I easily spread it  in the dish with my fingers. This time I doubled the sauce since I'm an ultra chocoholic, and next time I'll do the same plus double the cocoa in the batter and add a dash of cinnamon. Since there were so many comments about the bake time I took it out after 30 min. and it was perfect.

I made this recipe by adding on an extra half, and cooking it an extra 10 minutes to serve all 10 of my family. and Everyone had just enough, so I feel like it may not have quite satisfied 12 people like the yield claims. That being said... the cake was delicious. So rich yet not too sweet or heavy. Everybody scraped the bottom of their bowl and wished I had doubled the recipe. Thank you!

Awesome with ice cream on top!   I remember my grandparents microwaving a recipe like this so I thought I'd try it. I microwaved my cake for 13 minutes on half power. It was done in a fraction of the time and it didn't heat my house up!

This recipe is good but not great.  It's actually kind of bland and blah.  I just tried it for the second time using hot milk instead of boiling water but it really didn't make that much (if any) of a difference.  I would still make this when my husband or I have a craving for sweets since it is so easy and I always have the ingredients on hand, but I definitely would not bust this out for company.  I serve it with a dusting of powdered sugar and a glass of cold milk.

Turned out great.  I doubled the recipe but left out a cup of water because I didn't use a big enough pan.  It boiled over a little but is still excellent.  I served it with whipped cream.

This is also excellent using 1-1/2 cups brewed (strong) coffee in place of the water to make it mocha flavored.  This is a family favorite.

Simple, fast, delicious, and made from things I always have on hand. I always add a bit of cinnamon for a slight spiciness. My only complaint is that because it's mixed in the pan in which it bakes, there's no bowl to lick!

My family and I were craving a sweet and gooey pudding but I didn't have any eggs and very little butter which made things a bit tricky! I stumbled upon this recipe and WOW!! what a fantastic pudding.  I read the reviews and saw that some thought it not chocolatey enough or sweet enough so I added a bit more cocoa and dotted some chocolate spread into the batter and on top of the sugar.  Fantastic.  I now have a family of five very contented people.  Thanks.

40 minutes was too long for my cake... the pudding part was practically cake and hardly any pudding. I used quality choco (Scharffenberger), so I don't think that was the problem.  I will not be making this again.

I like the idea of this recipe, its like a fluffy chocolate cake with a hot pudding sauce but the taste was too floury. It may have been the cocoa powder I used but something still wasn't right with the taste.

My partner and I whipped this up when we were craving a chocolatey treat one night, and we were very impressed at how easy it was to make. The fact that it is mixed together in the pan that it bakes makes cleanup a cinch. I reduced the flour slightly and and added an extra tablespoon of cocoa to the cake to give it a little more flavor, since several people felt it was bland. Because the cake is so basic, it leaves a lot of room for modifications to personal taste. Overall, we found it to be a simple, delicious recipe that took less than 15 minutes to prepare and made almost no mess. It tasted great warm or cold. Definitely will make this dish again.

I agree that this is quick and easy but I strongly disagree with the fact that it's either sweet or chocolate rich. I found it to be incredibly bland. I followed the recipe exactly and it looked right at every stage and the finished product looked like the picture. But the flavor was very disappointing.

I think this cake was just okay. I expected it to taste a little bitter, since it did use unsweetened cocoa. But I have to agree, this cake does taste a lot like microwave cake. I have made microwave cake in a mug more than a few times to curb a chocolate craving, it's not bad. But it's not something I can eat a lot of at one time, so this cake was just a little too much of this kinda cake for me. Although I do have to say the one difference is that the bottem stays liquid like enough to make a sauce to even out the texture of the cake. And being that you can make this cake with very few pantry ingredients is also a plus. I would say though, this is not a cake I would serve to guest...

I was skeptical when I made this the first time. I thought it looked very unappetizing in the pictures and sounded weird but it turned out great and I have made it a lot since then. I have made it for company and they loved it. I definitely recommend serving with ice cream or whipped topping because it isn't very sweet. The sauce at the bottom is so good over the cake and ice cream!!! Yummy!!

This was delicious! Just made it exactly to the recipe. However it was very thin and a tad chewy (though I lost track of time and think I took it out too early). Very very filling too. I wanted more but after a small bit couldn't fit it in!   And holy chocolate! I'm DEFINITELY  making it again (and paying attention to the cooking time)

a very easy recipe, my 3yr old helper loved spreading out the batter with wet fingers once the milk was stirred in. "auntie dis is just wike mudpies!" I doubled this and put in a 9x13 glass pan ( put a cookie sheet underneath for any drips). I wanted to try with warmed half and half instead of the hot water, as others have but forgot to buy some so i guess we have to eat this again!!  will also try white sugar in the sauce instead of brown, and choc. chips for texture. my son and i really enjoyed this cold the next day, and the next day, and the next day, slightly warmed in the mic and topped with ice cream. i have always wanted to try a pudding cake recipe, so glad i did!

Boy was I skeptical about this one.  But it turned out GREAT!  I did mix the dry ingrediants in a separate bowl and then put it in the 9x9 before I added the wet stuff.  I also took the suggestion of using milk instead of water.  Wow.  Very, very good.

I wanted to try something different and this delivers! Its a yummy recipe, however....  I didn't care for it AT ALL hot/warm.. even though I knew there weren't eggs in the "raw" batter, I couldn't eat it. It just wasn't right..  So I put it in the fridge hoping that it would be better cold. The next morning, I took a little bite, and MUCH BETTER!  I love the pudding part of it, and now I need to seek out a chocolate pudding recipe so I can have more!

A great go-to recipe when you have a craving for chocolate. It uses basic pantry/baking ingredients which makes it great for a last minute idea. I was hoping for a bit more of the flavour of a chocolate lava cake with the rich melted chocolate centre, wheras this is a bit sweeter and definitely warm pudding consistency with a chewy edge and cakey middle. Quite tasty. Only needed 30 min. for cooking.

I followed this recipe exactly and I am being generous giving it 2 stars.  I seriously do not understand how it is rated so high?  Anyway, I will not make it again, but for anyone that is going to make it reads this, Don't put boiled water on top, use MILK instead.  Also, you may want to add chocolate chips because it really doesn't even have much of a chocolate flavor.  It was just ok once we added vanilla ice cream.

I made this on the spur of the moment to satisfy a chocolate craving.  It is so easy and fast to make with pantry staples. The result is a rich, gooey, chocolatey dessert.  My family went crazy for this.

I really am not sure why people say this isn't chocolatey, tastes like flour,  is bland or soggy. I love all things chocolate, and I found this recipe quite delicious. It turned out perfectly. Full of chocolate flavor (I just used Hersheys cocoa powder) and pudding. It never once was soggy; soft yes, but never soggy. We warmed leftovers in the microwave and had it with pumpkin ice cream. But it was great by itself. I plan on making another for company tonight.

For an easy chocolate fix you can't beat it! I added a pinch of chili pepper to brown sugar/cocoa layer which added a delicious zip to it. Really wished I'd had some cream on hand to balance it out, though - will be sure to have tomorrow with left-overs :)

My boyfriend just made this for us tonight (it was his first baking challenge) and it was wonderful. The recipe was followed step-by-step and was reported as relatively simple. The top was nice and crispy and the inside was gooey with chocolate--success! i do believe he will bake again.

Lullavacious!!!  Mouthwatering Chocolaty goodness!! I added a bit extra cocoa to the part you sprinkle on the top - but that was the only modification!  The is amazing!!  I will definitely do this again!!  Just let it sit for at least 15 mins and I used a glass baking dish so I cut the time by 5 mins!  Turned out perfect!

I was trying to find something like Ponderosa's Volcano Cake.  This was absolutely what I was in the mood for, and how awesome is it to not have to use multiple bowls, or even any at all?  I made this once without milk (used water) and it turned out just as well as with milk.  Even at 350, my cake wants to start burning if I leave it in too long - about 32 minutes is good for me.

The cake was great and satisfied my chocolate crave with little fat.  I even used a little whole wheat flour and Splenda.  Instructions are a bit confusing - don't mix the flour and stuff in the pan - use a 4 cup mixing bowl. Scrape it well and you can use the same bowl for the Brown Sugar/Cocoa mix.

This was easy but so bland. after the first piece I decided it wasn't worth the calories. If I dare try this again I will use sweetened cocoa as one reviewer suggested. Three stars for being easy.

super yummy. you can make this recipe without the oil and replace the milk with water. that way it is fat free and vegan. you'd never know it. it's so rich and comforting. it's not really pretty. so, i would not serve it at a dinner party. however, it's a great family recipe. the kids feel like they are getting a real treat! and well, me too :)

This is a awesome recipe....so easy to make and I made no changes. I hate reading reviews that say a recipe was really good or really bad and then they tell you all of the changes they made.  In the end it didn't even sound like the original recipe. Also, I have a granddaughter who is allergic to eggs and this recipe has none.  Had it with vanilla bean ice cream and it was to die for and a huge hit with the family.

It was ok. The pudding had a really wierd texture to it. Also the color of the pudding turned out dark so it looked burned. Over all the taste was good, but i don't think that i would show the entire product if we had guests over just becase it looked like a big burnt blob.

This was so quick and had lots of chocolate flavour, and we had it with vanilla ice cream. I did up the cocoa in the cake to 3 Tbsp and stirred really well (some reviews said flour tasting...maybe the quality of the cocoa is also a factor)I baked for 22 min. but think 20 would have been better. Some reviews said it was saucy on the bottom but mine was very pudding-like. Very good.

I was having company today so I doubled the recipe and baked it in a 9x13 dish and sprinkled a cup of shredded coconut on it before I poured the boiling water on it.  We ate it with vanilla ice cream. The pudding had a nice dark chocolate flavor to it. Fantastic!

i am eating this delicious cake as im typing this, and omg, it is unbelieveable. It's rich, and gooey, and puddingey, and chocolatey, and just, fabulous. I followed the recipe exactly, and it came out perfectly. Although i loved it, my younger brothers only liked it, they said that it wasn't sweet enough (maybe for them i'll use sweetened cocoa next time)

but definately 5 stars, this recipe is a keeper!!!!!

This recipe is easy to make with ingredients that are commonly around the house.

I live in Austin, TX and I cooked it for 25 minutes and it came out perfect in my opinion (half pudding, half cake).

I think if left in for too long it will overcook and taste on the floury side. The cake itself wasn't very sweet, but the gooey sweet pudding part offsets it nicely :)

I made this and followed directions exactly.  It looked and smelled great, but I could not swallow one bite.  I tried several different spots, thinking maybe some parts just didn't mix properly.  No, the whole thing tasted like wet flour.  Sorry, I just don't see how anyone liked this.  Although I'm sure with some changes, it would be a decent recipe.  Maybe way less flour, way more sugar, and more cocoa, I don't know, but I won't be trying it again.

Embarrassingly easy given how gorgeous it is. Not quite as rich as some chocolate puddings, but adding some chopped chocolate would sort that out! I've only given 4 stars because the quanities were so unrealistic - 12 servings?! This was gobbled up in minutes by 2 adults and 4 children.

I was on my way to India and was afraid I couldnt get my real chocolate there, so I brought this recipe and my husbands family who are Indian had never had anything baked! I brought a toaster oven and baked this. 2 boys plus my 2 kids ate the whole pan and it was still hot! They loved it! Thanks for sharing this recipe so I could share it with my family.

Not exactly sweet enough for me. I might make it again but I will make sure to add more sugar or use different cocoa.

Wonderful recipe and thanks to fellow reviewers suggesting the shorter bake time of 30 minutes it turned out fine. 40 minutes in my oven would have overbaked it too. I used the Hershey's Special Dark cocoa and it was even better, richer darker color.

Thank you Carol! This is the recipe I have used for years, and I had lost it!  My family absolutely loves it!  I usually add 1/2 cup chopped walnuts to the batter, and serve with a small scoop of vanilla ice cream on top.

Mine didn't work out so well.  I followed the recipe exactly, except I only cooked it for half an hour.  The cake had a weird taste to it, like salty and floury.  There was a strange aftertaste.  The pudding it made was very good though!

Sorry, but it wasn't the best pudding cake I've ever had.  It was gooey and chocolatey, but kind of bitter and bland.  Not sure what went wrong.

Oh my gosh!!!! I wish I could give this more than five stars!  My sister told me that I HAD to try this one, and I am so glad that I did!  My husband just looked at me, and asked if I had made it from scratch...it was THAT good!  We ate it with vanilla bean ice cream on top, and two out of three boys gobbled it up.  (My pickiest boy stated, "Mom, it's TOO chocolatey!")  If "too chocolatey" bothers you, then don't try it...as for me and my chocolate tooth, I will be making this again, and again!

I really like this recipe and especially the ease of making it.  I prefer it topped with vanilla ice cream.  This is not an overly sweet desert.

Great idea but not chocolately or sweet enough for my tastes.....too much like a bread pudding, rather than a cake.  Carol's Chocolate Pudding Cake III is fabulous though!!!!

Delicious and foolproof to prepare! Only 5-10 mins of prep. Instead of 3/4c of brown sugar I used 1/2c of white sugar mixed with molasses and it wasn't overly sweet. Tastes like a lighter version of a brownie topped with a thick chocolate pudding.

This is a wonderful recipe and it was very easy to make. I have been looking for this recipe after trying something similar at a resturant. I was very satisified with the results. This special cake took about an hour to make, and it was eaten within 15 minutes! This recipe was a winner with my family. I made no modifications to the recipe, but in the future, I will try experimenting with using less sugar and more chocolate powder to make it taste richer.

This recipe has been in my family for years.  I love it EVERY time I make it and it's wonderful for "unexpected" company.  It's quick and easy to make and all ingredients are usually on hand.  Serve hot with a small scoop of ice cream! It's like hot fudge cake!

It was easy enough to make, but I didn't get much pudding to moisten it up, so the ice cream I served it with helped.

This is an old, old standby, and I love it. It's mixed up in one pan, which is brilliant, and at the end you have a yummy, rich layer of hot fudge under a layer of chocolate cake. It all just begs for ice cream. It's a crowd pleaser!

Can't help but notice that the ones who've reviewed this recipe made changes. Personally, I would advise prepping the dish before pouring anything in and possibly altering ALL the brown sugar to partially white. Won't make again as written.

Made no changes. Quick and simple. Slide in oven just as  you sit down to dinner, vanilla bean ice cream. Delish. Really good chocolate fix when you want something gooey and yummy. Been making for years at least once a month.

I used this recipe instead of the "old home favorite" and it is superior.  I folded in slightly thawed raspberries into the finished cake mixture before spreading the topping mixture on it.  EXCELLENT !!!   350 for 40 minutes was perfect.

This was pretty good. I don't think this will ever be  best dessert you ever have, but it's simple to make and uses ordinary pantry ingredients. I've used this a number of times now when I've had to whip up a quick dessert on the spur of the moment and it never fails to be a hit. I follow the recipe exactly and it turns out every time. My one suggestion is to check it at about 30 minutes, not 40, but maybe that's my oven.

I have made this many times, but I guess I never reviewed.  this is an excellent recipe.  Saucy chocolate syrup on the bottom.  I sometimes change it up with different extracts, spices-tonight I used cinnamon-about 1 tsp. It is just a nice homey hug of a dessert.   Easy to make and I usually have all the ingredients as part of my pantry. I think today is National Chocolate day.  But I hanker this about 5-6 times a year for my chocolate fix, so it is a staple on our dessert rotation. Thank you.

love i for it's simplicity, and able to adjust. tried this first just as described, but way under-cooked it so it was really fudgy. since it has no eggs it comes out more dense than a regular cake, but still not like a brownie.  I loved this as a 5 star as is, but found the edges browned too quickly compared the center.  so the second time I left the sides a bit wetter than the middle, and the result was so great,  spooning it out warm with a lil' scoop of ice cream.  the third time I added mini choc chips, used 1/2 boiling milk & coffee and cook-n-serve pudding (out of cocoa) on top with the brown sugar and it was also fantastic- such a great recipe to use as instructed and also tweak as you like!

My mother made this recipe recently for a family dinner and we couldn't even eat it. Too sugary sweet and does not taste enough like chocolate. As many other reviewers have noted, it tastes mostly like flour and is very bland. I think I had maybe two bites before deciding it wasn't worth the calories.

Tasted chocolate rich but came out not like a pudding but rather mushy,sticky. Only change I made was adding hot half & half not water. Everything else was exactly as written. Granddaughter made it with me. Easy for her at age 7 and she loves chocolate! Served with vanilla orange ice cream which helped a lot. Plain, it would have been just fair.
Didn't like the texture at all. Will not make again unless granddaughter asks to do it.

After reading the reviews from others I decided to alter the ingredients somewhat.  I doubled the cocoa powder (I used Hersheys) I used water (no milk in frig!),increased the vanilla to 2t and increased the oil to 2.5 T.  I used my micro instead of the oven.  It turned out great--very chocolatey and sweet.  Ladies, play with the recipe.  It's not written in stone and you might be surprised!!

This is an extremely rich pudding cake.  I doubled the recipe for a birthday celebration and everyone loved it.  I served it warm with vanilla ice cream and my family couldn't get enough.  I read a review that suggested adding 1/3 cup cold butter cut up on the top just before adding the boiling water.  I will definitely make this again.

Childhood memories! I have this recipe, but looked it up to double check on the eggs. It been years since I've made it, but we had black walnut trees on our farm and Mom always added a cup of walnuts to the topping. Agree with LREYNAL to double the recipe! Thanks for sharing this.

FAR too sweet and lacked chocolate flavour- and i used a very high quality cocoa! Weird texture, almost suet-like and the most prominent flavour was flour.  VERY Disappointing!  It was incredibly easy to make so that what's the one star was for.  would not recommend.

This was pretty good. Needed a chocolate fix and this definitely helped! I loved the fact that it was easy and I had all the ingredients! Made the recipe exactly like it said except I used dark chocolate cocoa powder instead of regular. It's not too sweet, but it is a bit heavy. I will say if you'd prefer a sauce over pudding eat it right after the 15 minutes of letting it sit. The longer it sits the more "pudding like" it gets. Will definitely be making this one again :)

I used applesauce in place of the vegetable oil. This came out so good! The bottom of the cake is very liquidy when it first comes out of the oven and it's good that way, but even better if you let it sit for 30-45 min.

So  good!!! I ran out of vanilla extract and decided to make it anyway and the flavor was still delish.  I had a lil bit of a overflow in the oven and me moving it seemed to flatten the inflated top but the crust/top is so crunchy & yummy then the bottom is fudge sauce bliss! This will def be one of my fav recipes!!!!

The only things I changed were to use 1 3/4 cups hot tap water and 1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder because I was using a different recipe I found online that happened to be exactly the same as this one other than those two things.  It turned out pretty well!  The sauce it makes is yummy and I certainly don't regret having another 1/4 cup of it :o)  Loved the soft center and chewy edges.  This dessert doesn't taste super rich since there isn't much fat in it, but that's not always a bad thing.  This is a good, fast, and fun recipe to make!

Tasted very good fresh out of oven.  There was not as much sauce as we would have liked.  We reduced the amount of sugar and cocoa as well.  It met our chocolate craving however I'd most likely would try a different receipe next time.

Excellent.  When I first tasted this, about 20 minutes after it came out of the oven, I was a bit unimpressed.  After reheating it in the microwave a couple of hours later, it was amazing!  I have no idea what the difference was, but it was great.  Super good with ice cream.

I followed this recipe by the letter and was reallt concerned that maybe I had wasted my time and the ingredients. It didn't look like it was going to work. But I stuck with it and it turned out very good. I made a rum sauce to go with it. The only problem I had was getting the ingredients to mix in the cake pan. Next time I will mix them in a bowl first.

I made this according to the recipe exactly.  The recipe says the batter will be very thick, mine was about as thick as a regular cake.  Still, it turned out very well.  I will definitely make it again.  Yummy!

Easy and quick to make, but I was extremely disappointed! For you Brits out there, this pud is like the Coco Pops of the pudding world. It looks and sounds like it'd be chocolatey, but it just tastes of sugar. What a shame.

Awesome! We call this chocolate self-saucing pudding, I couldn't find a single recipe with that name on the website (at the boyfriends without my trusty recipe book) so I gave this a go and it was just what I wanted!

Disappointing; overpowering "sweetness," missing the rich chocolate taste I was expecting.  Neither my husband nor I cared much for it.  Won't make it again.

Not very good.  I followed the directions.  I did add 2 sqaures of semi-sweet Bakers chocolate, chopped, hoping it would make it a little better after reading some reviews that it was bland and floury.  The "sauce" was kinda werid.  Will not make again.

This is decent dessert that is super easy to put together. The serving size is definitely off in a 9x9 pan it's really 6 servings. I didn't have any baking cocoa on hand, so I used Ghiradelli hot chocolate mix & cut back on the sugar. Yes, I know it's not the same, but it worked. I wasn't a big fan of how the brown sugar became part of the cake top. There were spots that were very sweet because of it. I probably will make this again because of the ease and it is a low fat dessert option.

I think it's delicious and it's easy to make. I live in Hawaii and my cook time was also only 30 minutes not 40-so I don't think it has to do with altitude. Maybe the time is wrong. I would set the timer for thirty and check it.

This is the best pudding cake i have ever had, it might be the first pudding cake i have ever had...But still, if you're craving pudding and cake you will like this! If you don't eat it right away you can put a piece in the microwave for 30 seconds and it taste just as good!

Quite easy to put together with basic pantry staples.  When I'm out of eggs to make brownies or a regular cake, this is a satisfying chocolate dessert!  It is best eaten the first day, and you must have patience to let it cool a while before eating or serving--one of the hardest parts for our household!

My Husband loved this cake. However, next time, I'll reduce the boiling water by about 1/4C - the ""pudding" was pretty loose - even after setting a while.  It was awesome sporting a scoop of vanilla ice cream! Will make it again!

I've tried many "pour cake" recipes and this one tops my list!  Everyone I have ever made this for raves about it.

My mom used to make this when I was a kid.  Just like I remembered.  It was really good right out of the oven and my family loved it.

Made with gluten-free flour and it came out very yummy.  I gave it 4 stars, because I wasn't expecting it to be so spongey.

Everyone loved this recipe! I loved the fact that it was easy, simple, and most people usually have all the ingredients on hand. Good for a last minute treat!

OOOOOOOMYYYYGOOOOOOD.  I can't begin to tell you how many times I've made this over and over and over.  It is simply the best and so very very easy.  I almost always have every thing I need right in my pantry.  Wonderful.  Yum.  I've now got 10 extra pounds that says this recipe is the best!

Very good! A little too acidic, not quite rich and chocolaty enough, if you get the idea. I think the cocoa just made it less "deep" flavored. Next time I'd add coffee, and maybe more vanilla. Or use brown sugar instead of white in the batter as well. I love the thick sauce that forms at the bottom-- makes this dessert idea to be served with ice cream (though take my advice and avoid the non-sugar/non-fat ice creams-- they just aren't the same).

Good, easy recipe.  Like a cross between spice and chocolate cake, though.  I think I cooked it too long.  Don't overcook it even though it doesn't look done.

Very easy and with pantry ingredients.  Bland chocolate flavor.  Tastes like it needs something more.  Maybe instant coffee mixed with the cocoa.  Nice crust on top but difficult to tell when the cake portion is completely cooked.

My kids really enjoyed this cake.  And it is so chocolatey that it gave me my chocolate fix when I was having a major craving that night.  It was wonderful and so easy.

This was certainly easy, but my 
chocolate-loving kid did not like the taste.  
Perhaps it is the brown-sugar in the pudding 
sauce?
