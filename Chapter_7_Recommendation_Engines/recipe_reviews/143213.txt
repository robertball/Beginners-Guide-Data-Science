this recipe is not spectacular but if you have all the ingredients lying around (as I did),its a decent summer side dish.  I would add greek olives instead of green next time.  I also thought fresh blanched green beans would be better than canned. the dressing is really thick.  I added a extra 1-2 T of oil and lemon juice.

it was good, but there was too much couscous, and not enough vegetable for my taste. i liked the chickpea though, and i think the dressing was a little too bitter so i put a dash of honey in it, and it evened out nicely. it was well liked though, and i would definitely make it again.

This salad is pretty good!  I didn't really like the sound of the dressing, so I substituted it for the dressing found in "Pasta Salad with Homemade Dressing" by BONNIES.
