12.16.18  Been out of town for a week and didn’t feel like getting into anything too time-consuming for dinner.  It’s cool in Florida right now, soup sounded good, I had all the ingredients on hand, and it just sounded like a recipe I might enjoy…and I did!  I think this is one of those recipes that you just need to adapt to your own personal taste.  I made as written, tasted, then added more bouillon, some freshly-ground pepper,  and quite a bit more Tabasco® Sriracha and cayenne.  You’d never know there was a can of tomato soup in this,  It cooked down to a really nice texture, tasted light but still somewhat robust...I'll make this again!  ebrunworth, thanks for sharing your recipe.

I made this last night while it was cold and rainy outside, I absolutely LOVED IT!! I only tweaked a few  things, I added tomato bouillon and chicken bouillon instead of beef bouillon, and I omitted the hot sauce and only added the cayenne. It was one of the best soups I've had in a long time...and zero meat ...so happy about that. Thank you so much for this recipe I'll continue to make this for a long time to come.

I used my  frozen garden tomatoes rather than the soup and very little salt. The hot sauce added the extra seasoning I needed.  It was an easy dish to make on a busy night and delicious!
