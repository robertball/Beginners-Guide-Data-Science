It was really good.  I did double the recipe  and use a little less of the whipping cream so it would be more dense.

This recipe was very easy to make, and the flavor and texture was wonderful.  My family liked it better than a pumpkin pie made with canned pumpkin!  will be using this recipe again!

I used it as a baked pumpkin pudding, no crust.  Recommend!
