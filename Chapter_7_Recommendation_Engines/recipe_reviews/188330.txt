I did not have butter flavored popcorn oil so I used vegetable oil instead. I made my own homemade dry ranch seasoning mix, cut the dill weed back to a teaspoon (only because my dry ranch seasoning mix has dill already in it) and I used two bags pretzel chips. Mine took almost 45 minutes to bake for each pan, not 20. Next time, I think I'd increase the oil. Great tasting snack mix. Cheap to make and both the pretzel chips and the Goldfish crackers I bought for next to nothing at Grocery Outlet and all the other ingredients I had on hand or I made myself, which helps when you've got a whole family that loves to snack! This will make a good lunch filler-outer and Movie Munch. I'll be sure to write butter-flavored popcorn oil on the grocery list and make it with it the next time.

Awesome recipe - I've been making them for a couple of years. The only differences are I don't add cayenne (but I might try) and I don't add cheddar fish! If you can't find butter flavored oil reg oil will do ok, but it's the butter flavor that is awesome! Thanks for posting this recipe!

I was having a party and needed something fun, tasty, and crunchy - NOT ordinary chips and pretzels. I happened to have all the ingredients on hand for this recipe. I only made half a batch (small party), but the result was wonderful! This was incredibly quick and easy to make. Unfortunately it's also a bit addictive. I can't stop eating the leftovers! UPDATE - Twice this recipe has come to the rescue! My son needed something to take to a party and time was very limited. I threw this together in minutes! It's also very versatile - just sub in whatever small crackers and pretzels you have on hand. This time I used two types of small pretzels, goldfish, and oyster crackers. Delicious!

This was good! But not too much of wow factor involved in this recipe so I gave only 4 rating

I loved this recipe!  Brought a huge batch of it to tailgating one Sunday and I had to give the recipe to about 5 people!  I hate to say that I changed anything, however, I added just a tiny bit more cayenne because I like a little more heat.  Very good!  Thanks for the recipe!

I really liked these.  I added about 2 cups of pecans, because I had some on hand and they were a hit.  You could expierment with this one and add more or less of anyhting.  I did buy the popcorn oil which was quite expensive, I think canola oil or vegatable oil would work just fine.  I will be making more of these for the holidays.

I added corn Chex and used Ranch popcorn seasoning. I didn't have dill weed, omitted the garlic powder and added a little bit of grated Parmesan cheese and the result was delicious! The combination of the ranch and lemon pepper was awesome.

Very Good & Easy to make!  I used small pretzels twists, goldfish, and cheez its and it turned out wonderful.  The ranch flavor is really strong, so if you aren't a huge ranch fan you might want to cut it back a little.  I will make this again for sure!

Yum! Everyone loved this. I used Cheez-Its instead of the Goldfish and skipped the lemon pepper out of preference. The butter-flavored oil is what takes this stuff over the top. Thanks!!! :)

Delicious! A great snack to keep around the house. Though eat it within the first 3 days or so, after that the dill becomes overpowering. Easy, delicious!!

I can't rate this yet, I haven't made it..but thank you to  the person who posted it!  My husband's mother made this with just goldfish when he was a kid and he loved it.  She gave him a handwritten recipe but it didn't sound right to me and she can longer help (Alzheimer's).  It's the baking!  I knew it had to be baked, but her directions left that step out.  Thank you again...  I had to give it a rating, so I gave it a 5 based on my husbands love for it!

I didn't have popcorn oil, so I used vegetable oil. I was also out of dill weed, so I couldn't add that. Otherwise, I eyeballed all the other ingredients. I was quite surprised how much flavor these had! What a fun way to change up two of my favorite snacks. Thanks!

I'm so sorry, but these didn't have any wow factor at all. They didn't taste much different than pretzels and fish crackers. Not much trouble to make, but not worth the effort for me.

This recipe is also a great alternative to making the traditional Chex party mix. (I use Canola oil instead of popcorn oil, wheat and corn chex, pretzels, mixed nuts and cheez-it crackers.)  It has been a hit every time I bring it and its not too spicy, even for my kids.

Made the recipe and tried to follow it but ended up with cheezits and goldfish both as didn't have enough goldfish and couldn't find my cayenne pepper so left it out.  Something seemed off.  Daughter liked the pretzels but didn't like the cheesits or goldfish. Think I tasted the lemon pepper too much.  Needed something more.. nuts or something.  Won't be making again as there was other mixes we liked much more.

This is a great recipe! It is a quick and easy treat to compliment any party table. I am always looking for a good snack to go with beer and I have finally found it. I like the recipe as is, don't omit the dillweed or cayanne. If you want to cut down on salt get unsalted pretzels.
