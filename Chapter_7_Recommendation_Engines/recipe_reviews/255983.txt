Wow!  What a great recipe!  I loved the texture and flavors- I think next time I might even double the mix-in amounts.  I did sub pecans for walnuts because of personal preference.  I love the submitter's idea of using dried apples and cinnamon, that would be great!  I can also see this being great with orange zest added.  Yum!

My friend and I had a hard time not slicing off "just a little more" "to even the edges" while watching a movie the other day. By the time Thelma and Louise had sailed into the blue sky over the Grand Canyon, we had eaten half the pan! I made as directed except I added extra cranberries and walnuts, and some orange zest.

11.9.16  This is a very simple recipe to make, and it comes together quickly.  I did have to microwave it for about 8 minutes for all of the white chocolate chips to melt. This may be a personal taste thing, but I'll cut the rum extract back to 1 tsp next time.   Forget about chocolate fudge, and  remember this recipe for the upcoming Holiday Gifts From the Kitchen.

I did have some changes..
I used chopped pistachios in place of the walnuts and in addition to the cranberries I also used dried apricots and I added crystallized ginger.  this is beautiful for the holidays and it is a nice change of pace from "chocolate" fudge.

This is easy, and turns out really well.  You may want to line the pan with wax paper first to make it easier to remove after cooling.  Also, I changed the rum extract to almond extract, and we liked that batch a bit more.  It's very rich, so you may want to cut tiny pieces.

This was just okay. I find the taste of condensed milk to be a bit too dominant in this recipe. Won’t make again.

No nutmeg for this cook! I added butter rum flavor and it was awesome! Will def make again with another flavor as the condensed milk has its own strong flavor.

I will not make again...While this recipe is extremely easy to make it doesn’t have the  rich vibrant flavor of cooked fudge that I grew up with.   The Sweetened condensed milk is the predominant taste.

This is a wonderful fudge! I cut the rum extract to 1 tsp and added finely chopped dried apricots.
The white fudge is extremely sweet however.
I wonder if anyone has tried it with unsweetened condensed milk?

2nd time I made this it turned out "less white "colored. It was more yellow than white. I wonder if it's a difference in butter? Or over- microwaving to get the chips to melt . Anyone have this issue? It's definitely less pretty being yellow colored.

Very rich and decadent! I forgot to chop the fruit, would have cut into squares better if I had remembered. Also made it with dried montmorency cherries, want to try it with other dried tart fruits. Easy to make, hardest part is the waiting for it to be ready! Sped it up in the fridge after it cooled down!

Love this fudge! I always make a new cookie or candy new every year for Christmas. And this is the perfect fudge. I have changed a few thing I added a zest orange only and 1 teaspoon of rum flavoring
