It didn't taste bad just more like a hush puppy. Nothing like good old fashion hot water cornbread but it was ok. Not anything I would probably cook again.

I had never made cornbread this way but it turned out great. Maybe a little dense but maybe that is how it is supposed to be? I'm not a fan of cornbread so I only had a few nibbles but my husband gave it a thumbs up. Thanks for sharing!

These turned out really well. Same great Southern Cornbread taste that Iâ€™m accustomed to but in a smaller portion for my wife and I instead of making my normal whole skillet Cornbread and having way too many leftovers when family is not around. Flavor was really good, crisp outside and light inside.
