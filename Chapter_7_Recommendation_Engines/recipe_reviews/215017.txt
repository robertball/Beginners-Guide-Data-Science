So easy and delicious!  I also froze the bananas first (after putting the sticks in them) and used a combination of milk and semi-sweet chocolate.  The chocolate hardened pretty quickly, but we had just enough time to sprinkle with our toppings (I chose chopped peanuts, my daughter chose rainbow sprinkles) before the chocolate hardened completely and they were ready to eat!

I froze the bananas first so the chocolate would harden faster. I used a mix of chocolate almond bark, white almond bark and bittersweet chocolate because it is what I had on hand.

Loved them. I also froze the bananas first, then put the chocolate on, and then sprinkled them with coconut flakes. Yum!

I agree with others it would be better to freeze the banana on the stick first to make it more stable.  These are a yummy treat and a great alternative to ice cream.

Did not freeze the bananas which was a mistake and should be included in the recipe (maybe that's why it's 20 min of prep?). They didn't want to stay on the skewer so trying to roll them in the melted chocolate was a mess. I didn't even get to rolling them in the toppings because there was melted chocolate all over everything.
