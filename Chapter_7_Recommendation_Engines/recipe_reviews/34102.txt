This is very good without the mango, too.  I often make it with just the raisins as the fruit.  I will often use seedless grapes, walnuts, and celery instead.

Absolutely delicious! I used what I had on hand-substituted the sugar and raisins for cranberry sauce. Also used frozen chunks of mango-you can get it from Sams club reasonably.

Easy to make, but for some reason I didn't care for this.
