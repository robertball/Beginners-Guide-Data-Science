I make a version of this recipe thats great so I thought I would share. I cook and dice my chiken, add the vegetables frozen, add 2 cans cream soup (sometimes cream of chicken, potato, or celery)and the magic ingredient that makes everything stick together is about 2 cups mashed potatoes. Another nice addition is before adding mixture to pan I use a roll of pillsbury crossaints and make a crust....add the filling and then another can of crossaint dough on top for a crust. Its great! Always gone by next night. Oh yeah, NO pimentos....

This was a simple dish to make.  The end result was a little soupy meaning it had quite a bit of liquid.  The casserole didn't hold together like a casserole.  Maybe try less soup next time or pre cook the veggies so there is not excess water.

I have come to the realization that pretty much of all of "Taste of Home"'s recipes are lackluster.  They are great base recipes but really need a lot of kicking up in the spice department.  Even a curry recipe I saw in "ToH" only called for 1 teaspoon of curry powder... REALLY?  So while "ToH" is a great resource for desserts, the dinner and side dish recipes really need spices added to them, such as basil and thyme to this one.  Even a dash of cumin wouldn't hurt.

I'd actually say that this was actually a three-and-a-half star meal. I thought this dish was really easy and quick to make, and I thought it tasted good but, it didn't really impress me or my family. I might make it again just because it was so quick, but it not anything I would serve to company.

Excellent!  I just made a couple of changes:  I used half chicken and half Italian sausage and used frozen chopped spinach (thawed) and a package of frozen asparagus that I cut up.  It was simple to make and I was suprised at how much flavor the casserole had!  I will definitely make this again.

This is a quick and easy recipe.  We serve it over rice or noodles.  I usually leave out the pimentos for personal taste.

maybe try leaving out the milk, because it is very runny. i am not a cook so i like how easy it is to make. does anyone know how to make it a little less boring without doing much?

Not wonderful- but an easy go-to considering most people have the ingredients in thier pantry and freezer.

Kinda boring, needed something else to give it some punch.  I would probably make it again though
