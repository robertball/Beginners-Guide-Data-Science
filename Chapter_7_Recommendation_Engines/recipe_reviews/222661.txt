The soup was easy to make and tasted fantastic.  We're not huge cumin lovers but as is, it wasn't overwhelming.  The flavors blended together nicely.  The only change I made was to use chicken broth instead of the 3 cups water.  Great recipe!  Thank you for sharing.

I really enjoyed this soup and it was so easy to make!  Only 4 four stars because I couldn't follow the recipe exactly. I can't eat onions or garlic so I had to leave them out, but I added a rib of celery and some celery seed at the beginning and it turned out great. It froze really well too. I will definitely make this again.

Very tasty. It was a little thick so I thinned it with some chicken broth. I made a double batch so I could freeze some.

I was looking for a middle eastern flavored lentil soup and this was the closest recipe I found.  Honestly, I didn't follow to the letter because I wanted to double the servings and use canned tomatoes.  I didn't have high expectations for giving me that middle eastern taste I was craving but don't know how to cook.  What can I say?  It was DELICIOUS and super easy!  Completely satisfying for the craving and the ease.  Thanks for the recipe!  Hope you don't mind I rated it, even though I didn't follow it exactly.

This is absolutely the most delicious lentil recipe I now have!! I diced my veggies small, added all 4 cups water at once, pureed only a bit.  A handful of fresh chopped cilantro makes all the difference between good and great. Now, I'm going to finish it off for lunch!

I just returned from a trip to Egypt and fell in love with their style of Lentil soup.  This is just as good if not better than all the ones I tasted there, and so easy to make too! I added a little cayenne as another rated recommended for an extra little kick.

I will rate this a 5 because it is an excellent recipe. I prefer a balance of equal parts cumin to coriander powder though. Nevertheless it is very healthy and can be easily modified according to personal preference. If no fresh tomatoes are available, use a tbsp of tomato paste. If you like olive oil then sautee onions in it before adding the rest of the ingredients. Olive oil and a dash of lemon juice adds a nice finishing touch too. More people should try this recipe.

This was great.  I used broth instead of water and added a teaspoon of curry and some salt to taste a teaspoon of lemon juice.  I substituted some leftover chicken.  It was a great way to use leftovers.  I omitted the tomatoes only because I was all out.  Love it

Delicious ! I made as directed except substituted 2 Tablespoons tomato paste for the roma tomato., and added 1 teaspoon of crushed red pepper flakes.  I used one teaspoon of Better Than Bouillon Vegetable in place of the cube.   I also did not blend, but mashed with a potato masher. I may blend next time, but this was fantastic.

It was easy.  I made it in a pot and cooked it all day.  Once the peas were softened I used my immersion blender.  The soup was delicious.

First, I tripled this recipe to make it a one-dish dinner for four.  I sauteed the onions, carrots and (two tsp minced) garlic in olive oil before adding the water.  I did not puree but my split lentils got soft enough it was almost like a puree after extending the cooking time by 20 min.  I also added chopped Kale (large stems removed) the last 15 minutes. Before serving, I stirred in 2 Tbsp lemon juice and garnished with a handful of cilantro as other reviewers suggested. The soup was good, but it lacked rich flavor, so next time I will use Chicken Broth in place of water as most others have.  Very healthy!

Easy and delicious! The only modification I made was the need for an extra 1/2 cup of water and I used vegetable base instead of chicken bouillon. Very tasty. Kids loved it. I loved it. Hubby loved it.

I don't normally eat lentils and found this recipe mild yet tasty.  I sauteed the onion, carrot, tomato and garlic in a little ghee before adding french lentils and water.  I blended only a portion of soup and folded the rest in.  The cumin and coriander contributed nicely to the flavor.

I like this much better with at least half of it NOT blended. I feel the recipe could stand to have more water added as it is pretty thick initially I added chili powder and red pepper flakes in the absence of cumin and coriander, letting it sit in the fridge overnight. It was spicy and delicious. The next day, I bought the required spices, added those along with plenty of water, and it was pretty good. I made a large batch, using the whole bag of lentils.

I liked it! I worked in and Egyptian restaurant that made the soup. But I used vegetable bouillon and upped it to 1 teaspoon. The Egyptians usually make it vegan he told me. I also added an additional Roma and more onion. And added a teaspoon of cayenne pepper. Blended in well in a blender and it was fantastic! I love crackers and mine!

We had this with fresh bread and butter, all five of us loved  it, I changed it a little because I tripled it and added left over turkey and canned tomatoes and 3 stalks of celery, also used chicken broth for the first water. I have given 5 stars as all five of us has agreed that it should be a weekly meal. Thank you for this great recipe.

This was fun and easy to make and it tastes great.  I left about a 1/3 cup of the lentils whole.  After blending, I added some frozen chopped spinach.

Looking for something easy to make. This was delicious though I had to make a couple of changes. Only had green lentils (so the finished meal looks a bit like baby poop but, like I said, it's delicious!), ran out of cumin so could only put about 1 teaspoon in but I added some curry powder and it actually works. I'll be sure to get some more cumin though and make it again.

Although it's not pretty to look at it has wonderful flavor.  As others have done, I used chicken broth instead of water with great results.  Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly.  If I had had some, fresh cilantro would be a great garnish in addition to some crumbled chips.  This recipe was similar to lentil soup I had recently at a Mediterranean restaurant.  It's a very filling, satisfying soup!
