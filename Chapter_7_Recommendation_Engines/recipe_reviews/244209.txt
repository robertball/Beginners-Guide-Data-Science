I did change a few things. After cooking the onion peppers garlic tomatoes and shrimp in olive oil I melted some gouda and shredded parmesean/asiago mix to the saute. Then I added 2 eggs fresh red pepper flakes and some bread crumbs. I also pre-cooked the eggplant by roasting it for about 15 minutes; then chopped and added to mixture. Stuffed the eggplant and topped with cheddar parm/asiago mix and a little bread crumb on top. Baked until all brown and cheese gets a little crispy. it was delicious!
