If you like Indian cuisine, this one has pretty good flavor.  However, grilling it for as long as the recipe states led to some very DRY turkey.  Much less time on the grill, I advise.

This recipe is fantastic! I'm sure it would make a great marinade for a turkey breast sandwich, or even chicken!

This turned out great! I used chicken breast instead of turkey and baked it instead of grilling. Because i found this recipe right before i started to cook, i didn't have time to marinade, but it still tasted yummy! Next time i will marinade!

This was alright. Husband didn't like the lime and it was a little on the boring side. But it was nice to try something different.

This was kind of bland.  I used chicken breasts that I "forked" and marinated it for about 26 hours in the fridge and still found it bland.  

We also cooked it indirect, turning every 10 minutes. Since someone said it was dry when they followed the recipe.  Turned out moist but needed a bit more punch (we like curry). 

I may use the Madras (hot) curry powder next time instead of the Indian (mild) and maybe use minced garlic instead of the powder.  

Overall a good recipe for chicken and for those of us on South Beach its got low carbs from no sugar or thickening agents.

Excellent flavour.  Did use a slow grill and used crushed fresh garlic.  Will use the remainder on tomorrow's salad for lunch!! Will definitely make again.
