YUM!..  I had a box of "Gir-- Brownie mix which already had chips in it so I skipped the Butterfingers.  That would be a great addition for kids but we are all adults and I didn't want them too sweet; my big guys enjoyed the spider web! :)  I made this to play up Halloween this month.  I used an 9" pan but wasn't able to get as many circles as I needed to use up all of the cream cheese, I would use a 10-inch pan next time.  I followed the box's instructions which were "bake at 325 for 50 minutes" It baked perfect and the cream cheese didn't brown too much at the lower temp.

This brownie was a show stopper.  It was simple to make and the presentation was awesome.  I added meringue mini ghosts and chocolate/graham cracker mice to capture the full Halloween effect.

This came out great!! I got mixed up and made the webbing backward (outside to inside), but it still looked really good. I made spiders out of chocolate chips and frosting. Super-cute!

easy to make and looks awesome! Wish I had actual piping bags, but that's the only thing that made this recipe suffer. Thanks for the recipe!

Delicious! My family doesn't like cream cheese so I used vanilla frosting. We put it on after it came out of the oven.

So much fun! My son needed something for school. Since I knew he couldn't take a knife in, I made individuals in a cupcake tin. Definitely need to make sure you get the cream cheese mixture SMOOTH, but easy-peasy!!!
