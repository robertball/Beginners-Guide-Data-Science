I found the dinner roll dough too hard to work with. I used Pepperidge Farm sheet puff pastery dough and it worked great. You're able to cut professional looking 2" dough squares and the finished product has that "flakey" quality you can't achieve with the dinner roll dough. Since the dough "puffs" up when baked, add alot of crabmeat mixture to each square. Used "Pam" to coat the baking sheet and reduced temperature to 375 F in a convection oven to prevent any burning. Worked great. An excellent appeetizer.

I didn't have curry, so I skipped it.  Wasn't sure what kind of dinner rolls to buy so I got crescents.  It was delicious!  This is absolutely a hit.  If you are trying this recipe for the first time, you are safe serving to company because it is easy and tastes great even when you alter it, as I did.

These were delicious!  I substituted the imitation Krab with 2 (6 oz.) cans of real white crabmeat and replaced the curry with garlic powder.  They were awesome.

This was a huge hit lastnight at our dinner party.  The only difference is that I made using phyllo pastry to add more elegance and they were delicious.  It was more difficult with phyllo pasty but worth the effort after receiving rave reviews from our dinner guests!

Really good - very rich.  I made it as a main dish and placed them in flattened rolls.  Too much for a meal.  Sort of like cheesecake - a small piece is to die for--a big slab will make you sick.  Excellent for appetizer when made per recipe.

These were very good- and easy! They went fast on my appetizer buffet.  I mixed up the filling and refrigerated ahead of time, so I put them together fast.  I did use crescent roll dough.

When I first made this recipe, I followed it to the letter.  I learned that the filling was quite good but it was overwhelmed by the heavy biscuit taste.  I switched it to puff pastry, cut into small squares and placed into a mini-muffin baking pan.  Came out MUCH better and was a hit at our barbecue.  Will make again!

I really liked these.  I used romano cheese instead of the swiss as that's all I had and they were a little salty.  Next time I'll use swiss. Yummy,
thanks for the recipe.  Lynda from Calgary, Canada.

I made these for a large party using real crab, light mayo, and 2 different doughs/shells. I could not get the purchased refrigerator dough to separate or to look good. However, I also purchased mini-phyllo cups and baked these with the filling. They tasted delicious, and every one was eaten.4 stars for the refrigerator dough; 5 stars for the phyllo cups.

This was a hit! I made this with crescent roll dough instead of dinner roll dough as advised by other reviewers and it was eaten up in no time!  Great recipe - will make again!

Made these for Xmas appetizers and they were a hit!  I made a few changes- I AM a Maryland girl soo - used jumbo lump crab, subbed toasted bagette slices for dinner rolls and used Old Bay instead of curry pwdr.  Also added garlic powder.  Used 1/4 cup mayo and 1/4 cup sour cream.

This WAS an excellent appetizer! I peeled apart layers of huge flaky layers bicuits as a base because they were so easy to separate. I also added a big handful of tiny precooked salad shrimp in place of part of the crab, just for variation. The original recipe was great, but I halved it and added paprika and cayenne pepper to half. It really jazzed it up! The "hot" canapes and the original were both eaten right up. Everyone admitted that they were very rich, so only a few can be eaten. So, it is great for a large gathering...

I had been looking for a recipe like this for quite some time; my best friend makes this "shrimp puffs" recipe and everyone loves them.  This was very close.  I subsituted the crab with shrimp and doubled the recipe.  I also added sesame seeds and other spices.....eveyone loved them.  Even comparing them to the famous shrimp puff recipe!  I know have my very own!

This is a great recipe!  I tried it with both croissants and biscuits.  I think it was better with the biscuits.  They were the large flaky ones and were not that hard to seperate.  The curry added great flavor and it wasn't overwhelming as I thought it might be.

I made these with a few changes.  I used crescent sheet roll.  Rolled it out and cut into about 2 inch squares.  I mixed the 8oz krab package into the mayo, salt, 1/2 cup swiss cheese, 1/2 cup montery jack and no curry but put a little bit of dill weed.  YUMMMOOOO... a hit with my fussy DH :)

I didn't have any green onions so I cut up a regular one and fried it.  I subbed garlic powder for the curry and used the cresent rolls.  Reduced the oven temp to 375 and baked on parchment for 10 min.  Even my two and four year olds ate these.

The crab mix is fantastic. Melty & smooth with a wonderful crab flavor. There is just enough curry to make it interesting.       I also used the puff pastry and they were awesome. This recipe really needs the flakyness from the puff rather than the biscuit. Fresh crab is essential. I love imitation crab sticks, but this recipe is so good you really should splurge and get real crab.

This recipe was great. I added fresh cilantro, thai basil, and red pepper for an extra kick. I substituted lemon juice with fresh lime juice, and I added a little olive oil and substituted 3/4 of the mayonnaise with fat free sour cream. I also substituted swiss cheese with reduced fat (part skim) mozzarella and omitted the salt.

Excellent! I used two 6 oz. cans of crab meat and it worked well. I was slightly confused about the "refrigerator rolls", but using one flaky layer of buttery Hungry Jack biscuits worked for me. Easy to make!

I made these for one of the appetizers
at a party for 75 people at my mom's
eightieth birthday party. i had to make 
copies for 23 people. it was a huge hit!
I did leave out the curry in half of 
them for the people who couldn't or did
not eat curry, but they were just as 
good without it.

I made these yesterday to take to my in-laws New Year's day dinner. I doubles the recipe using 2 (6 oz.)cans of real crab meat & 1 can tiny shrimp. I also used garlic powder instead of curry (out of it). I used crescent roll dough cut into squares & put into mini-muffin tins. They turned out beautifully & were a huge hit - gone in a flash! Thank you so much.

I used puff pastry as suggested by another reviewer.  I brushed them with olive oil and dusted with old bay seasoning before I added the crab topping.  They were a hit at the New Year's Eve party...I had plenty of crab topping left and used that the next day for crab dip.  I topped it with cheddar cheese, baked in oven until heated through then broiled for few minutes just to brown the cheese.  That also went over well at a dinner party next day!  All in all, great recipe and I can see this as being very versitile and one that I will refer to often.  Thanks!  This one's a keeper!!

I really thought this would be a great appetizer with all the rave reviews. It wasnt anything great-just ok. As a matter of fact, Im taking it out of my recipe box and will never make it again.

This was great. I used pillsbury crescent rolls and baked them at 375. I also used garlic powder instead of curry and threw in a couple flakes of red pepper. The biggest thing I would recommend on this is be sure to stir it well and watch it in the oven. Mine cooked faster than it was supposed to. We will make this again as a snack.

Wilma, this is ALWAYS a hit when i make it. I do use buttermilk biscuits that i peel into 3. It's a very tasty recipe and appears a lot fancier than it is!
Thank you very much for sharing!

These are the most delicious crab canapes I've ever had!  I substituted thinly sliced baguette bread for the biscuits, and it was perfect.  I also used sour cream instead of mayonaise, and added a few capers and a sprinkle of cheddar cheese on top of each canape.  They were a huge hit at our New Year's Eve party.

Served this on Christmas Eve - everyone raved about it.  I made the recipe exactly as is with buttery biscuit dough, which was really easy to separate, and everybody loved it.  I have a very truthful family who wouldn't hesitate to say that it was just OK, but they loved it. I really wished I would have made more.  I did use real crab instead of imitation though!

Mmm, I liked these a lot! Needed something to do with left over crab from sushi night. Used regular onions, lime juice, cheddar cheese and crescent roll dough because thats what I had and they turned out super yummy!

First of all, super easy recipe.  Like many others, I did not use the dinner rolls, but rather chose the buttermilk biscuits that were on sale.  I flattened them out and they were kind of like crab pizzas.  In my opinion, the curry is a must, so if you don't normally keep it on hand, you need to buy some for this recipe.

These were a hit but I did tweak alittle. I used cheddar, mozzerella, parm cheese instead of swiss, and also did 1/4cup sour cream and 1/4cup mayo and cut out the curry just using 1/4tsp garlic powder and a small pinch of red pepper flakes. I also used phyllo cups instead of messing with roll dough. As my own little finishing touch I topped with a little salad sized shrimp that already came precooked. They were very cute & tasty and I just baked them for like 15 mins. Will def make again!

I've made these several times and they always get gobbled up quickly.  The only changes I made was to use garlic powder instead of curry powder. I sprinkle the tops with Old Bay seasoning before baking.  I sometimes add a peeled raw shrimp to the top of each canape, then sprinkle with Old Bay and bake.  Delicious!

The crab part is delicious (I used the garlic powder and Old Bay suggested in other reviews).  My problem was with the shell.  I meant to purchase puff pastry, but the store was out, so I chose filo dough instead---big mistake!  Added at least 45 mins to my prep time.  UGH.  But will try again with easier bread.  Thanks  for the recipe!

I made these for a party when looking for a fast and easy recipe using imitation crab meat.  They got rave reviews although I found them somewhat bland.  I used the flaky layer biscuit dough rather than puff pastry or crescent roll dough, and they went together fast.  If I make them again, I might try seasoning generously with Old Bay and/or pepper before baking.

Great appy Wilma! Not fond of imitation crab meat so I used a premium canned crab and added more seasonings. Instead of the biscuits, I put the mixture into mini phyllo cups. I made twenty four and in a matter of minutes, they had all disappeared. Wonderful and thank you so much!

My mom handed this recipe down to me and I first remember helping her make it when I was 6 and I have been making it off and on ever since. I put the mixture on melba toast squares and place it under the broiler. Sprinkled with paprika on top, this is always a hit with guests, especially at Christmas parties.

I made these for friends who came to dinner, and they were a huge hit!  I did not have green onions, so I put in finely diced onions and green peppers.  I also used garlic salt instead of regular salt.  They were so tasty, and very easy to make!  I will definitely be making them again!

This was rich but delicious.  Had a hard time with the biscuit dough also made the whole thing a little heavy for my taste.  I think next time I might just bake the spread and serve with crackers or baguette slices. The spread was good the next day for lunch broiled on an English muffin.

This is a fabulous recipe! My only suggestion is the direction that says put “a small amount of mixture “ on the biscuits. I only have one baking sheet so the first batch has a small amount (about a tablespoon) and the second batch had a larger dollop (2-3 tablespoons to use up all the mixture) and I like them better. Also I had a hard time separating the biscuit dough into 3 parts a few times, so I just got them into halves. I think I like the more biscuit ones better. So more is better all around!

I made of bunch of appetizers for a party at my mother’s house. This appetizer was included in my repertoire, and while I did not much care for them I still gave them a 5 star due to the response of other people. They were a hit. I used phylo pastry sheets and did them in the triangle shape. I don’t imagine my review will be much help to anybody as I don’t really have much to say otherwise, sorry. I will keep this in my recipe box since other did seem to enjoy them.

Made these for my New Year's Eve party. I wasn't clear on what the "refrigerated dinner roll dough" was. I assumed it was the Pillsbury Flaky Roll dough so that's what I used, by splitting each roll in half. They were a tad larger than I was expecting, but they tasted lovely, and I'll make them again, for sure.

I substituted half the mayo with sour cream, plus a little more cheese than the recipe called for and put them on frozen puff pastry squares. Quite tasty and a nice presentation with the puff pastry.

These are great! I used wiener wrap dough and cut each piece of dough into three pieces. I add more curry and have used Montery Jack cheese and they are still amazing!
