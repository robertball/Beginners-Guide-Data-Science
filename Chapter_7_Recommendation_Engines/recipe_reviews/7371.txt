This was extremely easy to make and definitely yummy.  I whipped it a little longer than I would for regular whipped cream and found that this made it easier to put on the cake.  It kept very well through the next day when we finished the cake. (Obviously, keep it refrigerated when not serving!) We typically eat pie, but with this frosting we may well see more cakes!  I now want to try it with orange juice and limeade concentrate.

This also works with dry lemonade drink mix as well. This is really good on a yellow cake but I also like this spread on a Lemon Pop Cake. NOTE: You can use SF drink mix and Splenda, just when you use a sweetened drink mix, you might want to gradually add the Splenda by teaspoons until it's sweetened to your taste.

Love, love, love this frosting! Very easy to make. I used it to make Strawberry Lemonade Cupcakes. I used whit cake, strawberry filling, and this frosting. Everyone LOVED them. I was worried that it might not hold up enough to look nice on the cupcakes but it did fine.

I made this as a request for a friend to bring to a party she was attending. I baked the lemon cupcakes from this site and they were devoured. I added a little lemon extract just to ensure it was lemony enough. Makes a light, pretty frosting that pipes well from a ziploc bag with the corner snipped off, about 1/2 inch. I also refrigerated my glass bowl and beaters to make mixing even faster. Great recipe! :)

I used this on angel food cupcakes, which was a good combination. It might be a matter of personal taste, but I didn't like its whipped cream quality. When the cupcakes were refridgerated, the icing held up, but it was still really messy. I think I'll try to find a lemonade buttercream frosting instead.

The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because while it was sufficiently tart, it just didn't have the right tart/sweet balance according to my taste. I had to add a few tablespoons of powdered sugar to get the sweetness & stability I was looking for.

Excellent frosting!  Held up well while sitting out.  Added a drop of yellow food coloring for a hint of color.  Frosted strawberry cupcakes and served them for my daughter's birthday party. Big hit!

I used lemonade because I didn’t have pink lemonade and my kiddos gave it a thumbs down. Added some vanilla and another tblspoon of sugar and it was good with my strawberry cupcakes. Have an extra star since I didn’t use pink lemonade

Delicious! However, since I did not have frozen pink lemonade concentrate, I used 6 tablespoons of Nestea Lemon Iced Tea powder mix.
