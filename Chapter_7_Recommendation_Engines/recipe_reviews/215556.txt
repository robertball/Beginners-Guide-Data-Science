The combination of "Ham and Swiss" is definitely a classic and tastes great. However, the honey mustard combined with the mayo was really a nice touch. Whatever bread you have on hand will do and I used Hellman's light mayo which is never is short supply around here. The only other thing I added was a nice slice of tomato. This was perfect with a side of chips and a dill pickle!

I LOVE ham sandwiches made this way! I usually just use whatever bread I happen to have on hand, and also like to add a nice slice of ripe tomato (when they are in season). The combination of the honey mustard and mayo (I use the light Hellmann's (R)) is just right (I don't measure it, I just use them to taste). Doesn't get much better than this! :)

Great simple sandwich. I had some homemade honey mustard dressing and used that. I left out the mayonnaise, because it is in the honey mustard. I didn't have country bread but used a ciabatta roll. I don't think the type of bread really matters. I made this for a packed lunch. I will definitely use honey mustard as a sandwich dressing again. It worked well. TY
