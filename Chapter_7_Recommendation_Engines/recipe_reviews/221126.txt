To make a better outcome of roasted potatoes, I took some of the olive oil that was set to saute the vegetables in and I drizzled it over the cubed potatoes and seasoned them with salt/pepper before roasting. I didn't use the full amounts of salt/pepper, milk or parmesan cheese. I just added to taste. I really wanted to watch the calorie count and a thicker soup. This soup was very filling and I loved the combination of all the ingredients. The potatoes and cauliflower fooled me into thinking I was having a rich potato soup when it was really cauliflower soup with a hint of potato. GREAT for me as I'm watching my carbs but I miss my potatoes terribly. I'd like to make this again but I think I would roast the cauliflower with the potatoes next time and maybe add a little more garlic.  As is, GREAT soup.

Adults and kids alike loved this recipe. A few tweaks I had to suite us. I used sweet potatoes instead of red. I tossed the SP and cauliflower in olive oil, garlic powder and Himalayan salt before roasting for 30mins. I tripled the garlic cloves and added more garlic powder and salt while cooking. Oh also added frozen peas for more color. Delicious!! It will make our rotation!!

I liked this a lot I used 1/4 of the salt and felt the pepper was too much. I used leftover thanksgiving turkey and it was very good. It had a little of that broth which helped.

Very good soup, but would omit the potatoes all together next time or at least not bake them first. Maybe cook them in soup. Tasted sort of like I added French fries to the soup and do not need the extra carbs anyway. I also oven roasted the cauliflower first. Also would just add the Parmesan cheese to each bowl as I go to control the sodium some. Wife liked it too and agrees with what I said!

My 7 year old son thought it was awesome.  My husband thought it was good.  I thought it was ok.  I had to go in the middle and rate it 3 stars.  I'm not a finicky eater by any means but it just wasn't a favorite of mine.

We loved it! My bf went back for seconds. Like other reviewers I oven roasted the cauliflower as well as the potatoes (and I used sweet potato because that’s all I had) with just some olive oil, salt and pepper. He requested more chicken so next time I’ll do 3 or 4 breasts instead of just 2! And there WILL be a next time.

I made this without the celery and cut the salt and pepper in half.  Because I have Crohn's Disease, I can't trust oven roasted vegetables so I just threw all the vegetables in the chicken broth and simmered for 20 minutes, then added the chicken, milk and parmesan cheese and let that simmer for 10 minutes.  I thought it was a great soup!

This was wonderful. Warm, filling and so good.

I made one big change and suggest you consider it:

I cooked the cauliflower with some of the chicken broth beforehand, pureed it in a blender and added this mixture to the soup at the end. It made for a think, creamy rich soup.

I got the idea from other recipes that use cauliflower to make an Alfredo sauce. instead of all that heavy cream.

Wow - so delicious! My only change was to remove HALF of the veggies after step four, puree the stock with remaining veggies, then add veggies back in and move on to step 5. This made for a heartier soup instead of a broth; more "chowder-like." My hubby raved about the roasted potatoes (I drizzled with olive oil per another review and that was a nice tip)  that added a nice touch of flavor to the soup. A real keeper!

Very good.  Roasted both the potatoes and the cauliflower.  Added corn starch to thicken it.  Next time I will add crispy bacon!

REALLY DELICIOUS! Next time however I would add double the liquids because with all of the vegetables and shredded chicken meat,  there was just not enough to make it 'soup'.

The whole family loved this soup!  A few changes I did:  instead of putting oil on the pan to cook the potatoes, I mixed some olive oil with the potatoes in a bowl and then spread them on the pan to bake.  To cook the chicken, I put it in the crockpot with water for about 5 hours on low.  It was super soft and shredded easily.  I also added some basil (after the carrots/celery softening stage).  Will definately make again!

This soup was zesty, with just enough pepper to make the veggies sing! Great soup to make with turkey broth leftover from Thanksgiving. Perfect for a cold winter day during football season.

Easy and delicious recipe. We are vegetarians (not vegan) and so I substituted non-chicken broth and actually used "fake chicken" cutlets made by Quorn cut in small pieces for the shredded chicken. Great flavor and good substance!

This soup was great comfort food without all the fat.  I roasted the potatoes and cauliflower on cookie sheets for about 35 min at 425, sprayed with some Pam. I also added a cup of sliced mushrooms when I sauteed the veggies. The milk and parmesan cheese really pulls it all together. I will definitely make this again.

Spent a couple of hours making this tonight. Not sure what I expected but I wasn't that crazy about it, especially for as long as it took. If I make this again, will definitely alter the recipe.
