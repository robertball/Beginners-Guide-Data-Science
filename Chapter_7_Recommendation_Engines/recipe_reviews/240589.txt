If you like artichokes and hummus then you should most definitely give this one a try. Super simple and packed full of flavor. I originally served this with a wheat cracker and I used raw veggies the second go around. Both were good but I thought the crackers were better. I honestly thought the Parm would make this entirely too salty but it did not. With that being said, I think tortilla chips would work very nice.

So nice and easy. I usually make a hot artichoke dip but this will be easier to take out. Whole family enjoyed and will definitely make again.

Great taste!  Definitely better the next day.  I added some fresh dill and enjoyed it even more.  Thanks for sharing.

Easy to make and delicious!! So glad I forgot to buy dip at the grocery store. I had all the ingredients in my pantry and tastes so much better than store bought.

wow, fantastic dip that goes well with veggies or pita chips or corn chips! I was looking for a quick dip recipe for Christmas day and had limited amounts of mayo and sour cream on hand, so this recipe came to my rescue. I used marinated artichokes as that was all I had on hand and it turned out great. The parmesan cheese comes through strongly, so if you aren't a cheese fan this wouldn't be for you. Family members scraped the bowl on this dip!

Great recipe! Thanks! I roasted the artichokes & added fresh spinach that wilted beautifully in before blending it. Will definitely make this again. Much appreciated!

Very simple and great flavor I added some smoked dried Jalape√±os best off all you don't have to heat it up
