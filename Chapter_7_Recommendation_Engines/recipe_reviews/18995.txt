The bonbons were good. My friends liked them alot, although I find them too sweet. I only used less than 3/4 cups of confectioners' sugar, if not, it would have been way too sweet. I added a little more walnuts too, since I like a nuttier flavor. And I would suggest melting at least 400-500g of chocolate. I did not prepare enough and had to rummage my cupboards for leftover pieces of couverture. Ended up having an assortment of bonbons, which wasn't bad.

This recipe is very easy to make and tastes like See's Candy!  I use Black walnuts with Black Walnut flavoring, Rum, Maple, and Brandy flavors with pecans and walnuts. I also use 1/4 block of parafin in the chocolate to make them more firm and keeps them from melting in your hands. YOu can also cover candied cherries with the fondant then dip in the chocolate.  Try them!  You will love them.  People go nuts over them when given as a gift!

These are nummy!!  I also used 3/4 cup sugar.  I used ground pecans and two boxes of Bakers semisweet squares.  I had no problems with the dough, as I left it in the fridge overnight.  I would next time roll them into "marble sized" balls.  I think this would make it easier to dip.  Don't have the whole batch out of the freezer when dipping.  They melt fast and don't stay on the toothpick.  Thanks for the recipe!!

These are awesome!  I used real butter and didn't add the nuts.  Also, I ended up using 2 bags of chocolate chips for coating.  Very rich, a winner!

So delicious. I ran out of chocolate as well, so instead of using another bag of semisweet chips, I used 12 oz. of white almond bark melted with the 2 Tbsp. shortening. White bonbons are delicious as well!

Fabulous recipe - I gave it four stars because you DEFINITELY need two bags of chocolate chips, as one really isn't enough. I mixed the margarine, condensed milk, vanilla and confectioners sugar together, then split the mixture into two bowls. To one I added finely chopped dates, maple extract and rum. To the other I added orange zest, orange extract and crushed vanilla wafers. I laid pairs of pecans, set side by side, on wax-paper covered cookie sheets, and set the balls of chilled filling on top of the nuts. The orange ones were covered (drizzle with a spoon, don't dip) in white chocolate, the rum maple with dark chocolate. Everyone said they tasted like fancy store truffles! Very easy to make.

These bonbons taste terrific!  They were a little bit messy to make, but it was worth it!  I suggest adding a little strawberry or orange extract and possibly some food coloring to "kick them up a knotch"!

Good but VERY sweet.  I make them every year during the holidays to give as gifts and the reaction is either love 'em or hate 'em.  If you like rich desserts & coconut and chocolate these are bound to be a favorite.  Also, it makes a nice big batch which is perfect for gift giving.

These would have been PERFECT...if the filling was a bit more firm. I have made them several times and they end up being patties instead of balls because the filling just isn't as firm as I would like. They are also kind of hard to keep together when dipping in chocolate as well. However, once they are finished, the taste is sensational and everyone raves over them! They are truly a rich delight for coconut lovers.

These are amazing! My mom made these every year. Each time I make them I have to share the recipe with friends and they go FAST! I use 1/4 block of shaved paraffin instead of the shortening and I think I may use 1/2 tsp. of salt that my mom's recipe calls for to add a slight sweet/salty bite to it. I know, I know...I'm changing the recipe but the 5 stars is based on this recipe as is!

Have been making these for several years. Be sure to refrigerate overnight, otherwise too soft and won't dip well. Also, roll into SMALL balls as these are very sweet. One last thing, I also add a little bit of paraffin wax to the chocolate. Helps it to be a little thinner when dipping and gives the Bon Bons a nice shiny coating. Enjoy!
