Oh, dear--this is so addictive! I used reduced fat cream cheese, low fat mayonnaise, I upped the garlic powder to a half teaspoon and because the recipe didn't specify what kind of onion to use, I used chopped green onion as I had some to use up. I made this early this morning and let it set until lunch, when I had this with carrot chips and sliced cucumbers. I've not had anything like it before! Next time, I might add just a little more onion but really that's just personal taste. I think this would be good with dill weed, too.

I guess I'm cheating, but wanted to get a review in so people won't miss out on this.  I've never been a fan of any vegetable dip, but love this!

After reading reviews I was somewhat dissapointed.  Next time I might increase herbs, onions & garlic.  Found it somewhat bland.  The egg flavour takes away from the cream cheese I might either cut egg back or leave it out all together.  Other wise it was an ok recipe, just not one of my favorites.

I have made this dip for YEARS,  I substitute deviled ham for the anchovy (I don’t like the thought is the paste!) but that’s all.  I make enough for company and some leftover for me—-on Weight Watchers with veggies it is a mere 4 points!

I did make several changes and no I would not make it again.  It was pretty much tasteless. Chili Sauce for a zip.  I used about 2 heaping Tblsps.  It still didnt please me but it was okay.  I did not use the egg as I did not know how the egg would add anything.

This recipe has been one of my families favorites as long as I can remember. So glad I thought of it this morning and it was easy to find at Allrecipes. I have a bunch of fresh veggies and will make this dip this afternoon. The recipe is just as I remember it. Would'nt change a thing. Thanks
