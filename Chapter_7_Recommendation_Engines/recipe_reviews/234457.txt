I loved this! I used some white wine and chicken stock instead of the water. I subbed Dijon mustard for the powder, ground dill for the seed, and some chili flakes. I wasn't going to serve it with the steamed dumpling so I added potatoes to the dish to thicken and make it more filling. A new fave!

I loved this goulash.   I followed the recipe exactly.   It was easy to make, creamy with a bit of sauerkraut, but not over-powering.   I served it over Tim Drexler's steam cooked dumplings, which was a perfect match for this.   I will make this meal again.

This is the second time I made this, I subbed Lowesaft extra scharf mustard for ground mustard and Bavarian water (pils beir) for the tap water, serving over spaetzel.  My wife canâ€™t wait for the timer to go ding.
