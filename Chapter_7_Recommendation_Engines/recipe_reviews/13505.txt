I followed the directions exactly except the baking time was at least 1/2 hour longer than it stated here. It is a very easy and quick casserole to put together. And I served 12 people this with plently leftover for the next night.

I used this recipe many times always with rave results.I use 1/2 and 1/2 rather than milk and cut the sugar down to 1/2 cup. It is fabulous.

Excellent recipe; however, I scaled it to feed 30 and wound up with enough corn pudding for at least 60 - 70 people. Maybe someone can tell me what happened in the scaling process. Followed directions exactly.

I had never had anything like this before.  I tried it for my first Thanksgiving dinner and it was AWESOME.  I don't usually process the corn until smooth because I like a few kernels left whole for some texture.  Also, I like to add a teaspoon of vanilla.  This has become a Thanksgiving tradition at my house for the last 5 years.

I made this recipe for Thanksgiving and it was delicious.  My mother is from Virginia and I remember as a child going to a family reunion and having corn pudding for the first time.  I added a teaspoon of vanilla and substituted some half and half, but not a lot.  I had to bake it a little longer, but when it was ready it was nice and brown.  My family really enjoyed this and I'll make it again and again

I used a round, 10-cup casserole dish, cut the sugar by half, and made sure that the eggs were REALLY beat. Added fresh ground black pepper. I thought it was too sweet, but my guests loved it, so I'll be sure to make it again.

First off, DO NOT make this in your Cuisinart.  3 1/2 cups of milk is just too much (as I found out) and it will make a huge mess.  The "pudding" was just awful. I'm sorry, but I've had much better.  The sugar concentrated in the bottom and the butter seperated turning the whole thing ended up a mess.  I prefer a corn pudding that has more corn to it and is less of a sweet omelet with corn in it.  I'll go back to my other recipe next time.  I thought this one would be so easy, but I was dead wrong.

I didn't have the box of corn muffin mix required in other recipes, so I tried this. It was really good, and not much harder than the others. I used 2 eggs, rather than the 1 whole and 2 whites.

I've made a recipe almost exactly like this variation on corn pudding and it was scrumptious. I think it unfair that the previous reviewer gave the recipe one star on the basis that they believe it's not true corn pudding and not on the quality of the recipe itself. I've seen many variations on corn pudding, this variation being one of them.

Great side dish, sweet without being too sweet, but it feeds rather 8 than 6 people. I thought it should have been firmer, but it might be because I poured it in a too small casserole dish. Will bake it on a regular basis.

This is NOT corn pudding. Not with all those vegetables in it, and cheese. Corn pudding is simply an egg custard with corn in it. Period. I would give it no stars, but that is not allowed

I've been making this recipe for Thanksgiving for almost a decade.  Every year someone says, "You're making the corn pudding, right?".  This recipe is a keeper.  Because the baking time takes forever with the current recipe, I cut the milk down to three cups.  It still takes about an hour to bake.

I baked this along with roasting my standing rib roast for Christmas dinner for 45 minutes.  It is excellent.  Almost like a corn souffle.  The only thing I would do would be to add a little nutmeg.

DELICIOUS!!! I made this for dinner tonight and my family loved it! I used 2 cans of corn instead of frozen corn and about 3/4 cup Splenda instead of the 1 cup white sugar. Also, I used a hand mixer to beat the ingredients instead of a blender or food processor - still turned out very well! Thanks for a great recipe!

Taste was sweet and simple.  Even once it was done cooking (1 hour 30 min!), there was a lot of liquid pooled at the bottom.  If I make it again, I will try decreasing butter and milk to eliminate the wasted, liquid in the bottom, and I might add vanilla and nutmeg for better flavor.  But I think I will try other corn pudding recipes first.  This wasn't what I'd hoped it would be.

Not recommended at all.   This took over an hour and 1/2 to cook, and even then it was soupy.  Sugar collected at the bottom, even though I blended it all together.  Not only was I late to Easter dinner, I brought an embarassing dish with me!  I recommend using one of the other many corn pudding recipes out there.

I love this corn pudding version as it is not as sweet and the corn has been pureed so it comes out more like a souffle. My family has been eating this version for years. Make plenty as it reheats well for leftovers!

I had to cook this double the time, and the consistency was a little strange, the bottom was rubbery and there was liquid draining to the bottom.  Not sure what went wrong?  Everyone seemed to like the taste though.

All four of us liked this. Even my five and eight year olds liked it- and they hardly ever like anything if it doesn't come in a pizza box or a Happy Meal bag! Very easy to make, and delicious.

My family loved this recipe.  For the 7 serving yield (really about 10 servings), I used 1/4 cup of butter, 5 eggs instead of 6, Lactaid (lactose intolerant) and added a 1/4 tsp. of vanilla extract.  It was AMAZING! It made for a very light dish.

I'd advise to disregard any one-star review based purely on the title of a dish, with no actual comments on the flavor of the end result.  

So this dish is a bit more like a quiche consistency - big deal.  The flavor and texture is absolutely fantastic, and it's relatively easy to prepare.  Can't complain about that - in fact, I'll give it five stars :)

I'm not good at following recipes to the letter (even my own), so for this one I generally use more garlic, three whole eggs and opt out of the crumb topping (I sprinkle a little extra cheese on top before baking - when it's all said and done I use about one whole 8 oz. bag of shredded sharp cheddar for the dish).  I've added mushrooms, I've tried it with a bit of sausage, added cayenne, and many other variations - this recipe is a great starting point and quite flexible depending on your own preferences.

5 stars for taste, 1 star for instruction. In no way are 45 minutes enough. I halved the recipe, baked it for 55 minutes, and it was still liquid-y. I had to give everyone bowls so their taco salad didn't get soggy. Cut back the milk for sure!

Because we are retired and there are only two of us at most meals, so I halved the recipe.  Also, I substituted Splenda for sugar.  The results were excellent and were souffle-like.  This recipe, when prepared with Splenda, really tastes like it is made with sugar.  It is a very good diabetic dessert or side dish.

I had high hopes for this recipe after reading reviews but it was not for this family. The finished product was too egg-y.

I used a 2qt pan and I had to bake for an additional half hour. Sould have used a 3qt pan.  In spite of this, it came out really well.

It turned out ok with modifications: I beat the eggs and sugar by hand. I used 3/4 cu. sugar and thought it was still a little sweet. It seemed like a lot of liquid after I put it in the pan (9 x 13 glass pyrex), so I added more corn (used ~30 oz corn total). I also used 5 T. flour to try and make it thicker (if I made again, would use corn meal for half of this). I was surprised there was no salt in the recipe so I added a sprinkle - if I made again I would add at least 1 tsp. I also used a little fresh-ground pepper. After reading other reviews about the cooking time I upped the temp. to 375, and it still needed 1 1/2 hrs. to cook. I wonder if extra water frozen in the corn makes this more liquidy than expected? It might work better if the corn were thawed first. I made it with fat-free milk; if I made it again I would use only 3 cups and would use fat-free half-and-half for half the liquid. This recipe would easily serve at least 12 in my opinion. All-in-all people seemed to like it and it tasted fine. I might try it again because I prefer frozen corn to canned, but if you like canned, I would try a different recipe.

This was really, really good.  And so easy!  I doubled it because I was having 16 guests for Thanksgiving, but I had a ton of leftovers afterward.  We enjoyed this very much...

Wow. I used this with fresh corn from the garden. Cooked first, of course. This turned out really well. I can see this as a frequent side in our future.
