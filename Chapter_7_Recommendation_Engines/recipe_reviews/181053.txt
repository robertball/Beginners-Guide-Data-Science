If you are considering making these brownies, please take the bad reviews with the grain of pettiness and silliness they deserve (this recipe was originally named 'Barack OBrownies,' which quickly brought on some bad reviews by people who have oboviously not tried the recipe but wanted to see their 'votes' count somewhere...). These brownies are VERY good, with the potential of being excellent. The fudgy  texture of mine was perfect after 35 minutes @ 350. My only complaint is that the cayenne and orange flavors as written are far too subtle, to the point of being unnoticeable - so you may want to play with that a little. I doubled the cayenne and quadrupled the orange zest and ended up with wonderful dark chocolatey, orangey brownies that I will be making as my chocolate dessert at Thanksgiving. Thanks for the recipe!

I thought these were very good.  I used walnuts instead of hazelnuts - only because I was running short on time and didn't feel like removing the skins from the hazelnuts.  I look forward to using them next time, though, as I think they would have been better.  The brownies are both cakelike and fudgy at the same time (which I love!) and although I didn't mind the cayenne and orange background flavors, I think I would have preferred one or the other, but not both.  I think next time I'll omit the orange zest and add a pinch of cinnamon, as cayenne and cinnamon give chocolate a more Mexican/Mayan flare to me.  Great recipe! Thanks so much for sharing!

A little fudgy, I prefer chewy but not fudge in a brownie.  The taste was lovely. I have been trying a lot of chocolate variations. The chili pepper and chocolate is not only traditional (think Mayan, but also very tasty.

I was looking for hazelnut recipes when I found this one for brownies.I loved this recipe, as did everyone that tried them. I doubled the recipe to fit  a     9 x 13 pan and added extra orange zest and cayenne as well as the leftover hazelnuts from a homemade frangelico recipe.(I couldnt bear to waste them them)Extra Bitter chocolate didnt hurt it either.

I really liked the flavor of the hazelnuts and orange with the chocolate. The flavors are a little unexpected, yet delicious.

This was delicous. I increased the orange zest and cayenne as suggested, and my only complant is that it isn't chocolatey enough. I think I will add another ounce of chocolate next time, and there will definitly be a next time!

Why did you change the name of the recipe? Followed the recipe exactly - strange taste and unusual texture.

Great! Added a LOT more orange and just enough cayenne to taste. Gave them out to my supervisors at work as belated Christmas/New Years gifts and they were received very well...thanks for a great recipe! Will be making them again.

I've made this recipe twice. Second time I added just a bit more cayenne because the first time it was not even noticeable. With a bit more cayenne it leaves more of a spicy tail on the way down. Good stuff either way!

Sweet and chocolaty--I loved the hazelnuts. These are on the cakey end of the cakey-fudgy brownie spectrum.

I did not like the orange hint but otherwise they were brilliant. Very chewy and loved the spice!
