To make this a bit more traditional, salt-cured ham hock pieces are used for more flavor (hueso de jamón serrano), but I imagine these are hard to find in the US.  Also, instead of bacon, in Spain we use panceta.  In addition, Spanish paprika is missing.  Spaniards typically make a "sofrito": in a small pan, sauté chopped onion in 2T olive oil, then add chopped tomoatoes and allow to reduce, then add about 1/2T Spanish paprika.  Add this mixture to the pot.  ¡Buen provecho!

With crusty bread and a tossed salad, this is a great quick dinner. Next time I'd use chicken broth instead of water. I seasoned with some smoky paprika as the bay leaf just wasn't enough. I didn't soak the lentils overnight, just 15 minutes before I cooked them. Took a bit longer, but not much. I like the quickness of this recipe and will make it again with additional seasonings.

I enjoyed this recipe very much. Although I did doctor it up a bit like abuela would. I used chicken broth instead of water, added some baby carrots at the same time as the potatoes, and also used a couple smoked ham hoaxs for more flavor. It was a hit that even got Nana's approval. Good recipe to start though.

With the addition of about a tsp. each of salt, cumin, and red pepper flakes, it was flavorful enough to not be bland but still nothing spectacular on it's own. 2 out of 5 family members would eat it. My husband said never make it again.

Great! My mom used to make this and I have been looking for a recipe that resembled hers. I made it exactly as the recipe calls and it was delicious. I find it strange that people find it simple or lacking flavor because the spanish chorizo gives it A LOT of flavor, I'm willing to bet they're using the wrong type of chorizo

Made this today for my colleagues at work, and got rave reviews Substituted red, yellow, and orange peppers for the green, and added "pimenton" aka smoked Spanish paprika. That along with a traditional Spanish chorizo made this especially tasty. Next time I'll add carrots to the mix.

This recipe is also delicious just using simple ingredients such as tomato, onion and cilantro. Flavor your water with chicken base add your washed lentils and boil. In a pan stir fry your tomatoes and onion. Than transfer them to the boiling lentils and add your cilantro. Add salt to taste. Cook for 20 minutes. Enjoy.

I accidentally used Mexican chorizo, but it turned out wonderful anyway.  I boiled off much of the water and it turned into a wonderful side dish on the plate instead of a soup.  Also, I substituted rice because I was preparing it last minute and didn't have any lentils soaked.  My fiance raved it was by far the best lunch she had had all week.

I looked for a soup with sausage and lentils and this fit the bill.  I wanted to use ingredients I had on hand and so it is a bit different than the submitted recipe.  I started with French lentils (it was all I had) and it just happened to be 11/4 cups.   Then, after reading reviews, I used chicken broth instead of water and added one medium red potato, peeled and diced (based on another reviewer) about a cup of diced carrots, and Andouille sausage along with a teaspoon of Spanish paprika ( it is also referred to as Smokey paprika).  My BF said it tasted like potato soup but I totally disagreed because of how little potato was in it...he is not a food connoisseur.  I liked the heat from the sausage, the smokiness from the paprika.  Will make this again but will omit spud.  Will try it with pancetta vs. bacon (also from a reviewer). It is a good, solid base for making it your own.  Enjoy!
