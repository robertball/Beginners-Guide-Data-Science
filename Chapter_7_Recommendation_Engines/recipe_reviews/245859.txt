Excellent! I tweaked the roast a bit to fit with another recipe I was making. The apple cider in this one definitely set this one apart from the other. The one thing I did like in the other better was the addition of tomato paste. It needed that acidity. The mushrooms and thyme in this one was a better flavor combo. All in all, this one was the better recipe.
