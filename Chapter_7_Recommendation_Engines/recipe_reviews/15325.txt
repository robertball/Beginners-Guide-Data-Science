This really does taste like French Silk Pie! I was both surprised and impressed! (And I couldn't stop tasting it, telling myself I had to make sure it was sweet enough, chocolatey enough, the proper consistency, etc., etc...yeah, right) It is light, fluffy, and mildly chocolate - just like French Silk Pie! It spreads like a dream and makes the cake look like you just have to dive right in for a piece.  Wanting to make sure I had enough to amply frost a layer cake I scaled the recipe to 18 servings and it was just the right amount.  Using pre-melted unsweetened chocolate in the envelopes made this a snap to make quickly. Didn't have milk but I had cream leftover from "Whipped Cream Cake II" and it worked well.  Awesome good frosting.

THIS IS THE BEST, BEST, BEST FROSTING!!!!  There need be NO other chocolate frosting recipes after this one!  Also, it is TOO easy to be so smooth and delicious !  Most chocolate frosting recipes are too thick and heavy, but this is very close to the flavor and texture of French Silk Pie!  I LOVE THIS FROSTING!  It frosted and filled my 8 inch layer cake well and I added just a splash more milk...I might double it for a 9 inch layer cake cause it's SOOOO GOOD!!  Truly, outstanding...light and chocolaty!

I've been making FRENCH SILK FROSTING for over 40 YEARS since the recipe came out in 1964 in Betty Crocker's "FESTIVE FIXINS WITH A FOREIGN FLAIR" and below is the ORIGINAL RECIPE, which will make you flush the one given here down the toilet! It is better than sex!  4 CUPS SIFTED POWDERED SUGAR 1 CUP SOFTENED BUTTER (OR MARGARINE) 1 EGG 3 SQUARES BAKERS UNSWEETENED CHOCOLATE, MELTED & COOLED (MAY ALSO USE 3 PACKETS OF REDI-BLEND CHOCOLATE) 1 TSP VANILLA EXTRACT  BEAT ALL INGREDIENTS UNTIL LIGHT AND FLUFFY AND SPREAD ON COOLED CAKE.  YIELD FROSTING FOR 2- 9 INCH LAYERS.  ENJOY!!

This is really tasty, first time for me making frosting so I think it came out really well.

I didn't have bakers chocolate so i used baking cocoa and added more milk... didn't hurt the frosting at all. 

very yummy!

This is my family's all-time favorite frosting!  This was my first time making it....my mom always frosts our birthday cakes with this, and my son asked me to make a yellow cake using this frosting. I couldn't find the recipe....I don't have the old Betty Crocker book that my mom has, so I was thrilled to find it here!  It turned out great on my Bonnie Butter Cake.  I too, had to add about 3 TBS more milk...I made a batch and a half for a 9" layer cake...my boys LOVE frosting :)  Thanks for the recipe!

Recipe was fairly simple to make but it was a bit dry.  I would suggest adding a splash more milk.  The taste got rave reviews though.

This frosting is smooth, silky and delicious! It's very easy to make, and it makes enough to generously frost and fill a 9-inch layer cake. The best thing about this frosting is that it's stiff enough use for piping decorations.

The longer you beat this the fluffier it gets.  I usually beat the butter and sugar until fluffy then add the rest of the ingredients and keep beating it until really fluffy!   I have also used white chocolate for white frosting.  This is my go to recipe!!

This is to die for frosting.  I used margarine in the recipe instead of butter.  I think this would be great with butter.

This frosting is absolutely divine!  It is light and fluffy and spreads beautifully.  In my opinion it has just the right amount of chocolate.  I prefer a lighter taste, not too dark.  I made no changes except to scale to adequately frost a three layer cake.  This is now my favorite chocolate frosting recipe. I see/taste no reason to look for another recipe.  Thank you for sharing!

I'm making this frosting recipe for the second time today...it's THAT good! Pairing it with the Black Magic Cake recipe from this site, it's the perfect combination for a sensational cake. Reminiscent of my mothers oh-so-delicious French Silk Pie I grew up with, I'm hoping the Black Magic Cake with French Silk frosting will win first place at a cake baking competition at my church. All in the spirit of good fun. Wish me luck!

PERFECT light chocolate frosting. not too sweet with just the right amount of chocolate. use this is you are looking for a light milk chocolate frosting that will not overpower a cake but accentuate it.
added a slpash more milk as others had suggested also added about 2 tbsp of kahlua. very easy to make.

This was great! I made it tonight because I needed a lighter colored chocolate frosting for a chocolate "monkey cake" for my little boy's 3rd birthday. It was really light and creamy. Instead of the melted unsweetened chocolate, I added 6 Tbsp of unsweetened cocoa powder and 2 EXTRA Tbsp of butter. It was perfect and I received a lot of compliments. Thank-you to Ginger for posting a great recipe.

This is an easy recipe to prepare. I used Baker's Premium White Chocolate baking squares as I wanted a white chocolate frosting.  I also used unsalted butter and wish I had added some salt to balance and enhance the flavor.  I also think it would have been better with about 1/2 t. of pure almond extract.  If you tasted the frosting alone, there was a slight gritty texture; but in eating a slice of the cake, the gritty texture was not noticeable.  Thanks for sharing!

Fabulous, easy frosting. I did not have unsweetened chocolate so I used two squares of dark (54% cacao) chocolate to delicious results. My only caveat was that this did not seem to me to be quite enough to frost a whole cake (two layers, frosting between the layers), but that might only be because it was so scrumptious I spread it too thickly. :)

This is the best frosting ever. I needed chocolate frosting to go on the chocolate cupcakes my daughter and I baked. I had minimal ingredients but had what I needed for this and it turned out well.

Super easy and nearly impossible to mess up! I used cocoa and melted butter in place of the melted chocolate as I didn't have any on hand. Mine ended up a little bit runny but it was my own fault because I wasn't measuring the milk just dumping as I had a couple of little helpers helping me. I would recommend that if you are using the cocoa that you put it through the sifter as mine ended up with a few tiny lumps in it - not really a big deal as our cupcakes weren't going anywhere (except in our mouths!)

This frosting is amazing. I use it on the majority of the cakes I make, and everyone who tries it is endlessly complimenting it and asking for the recipe. On top of that- it's easy, light, and done quickly!

I had never made frosting before. It turned out really well, nice and creamy - no gritty texture. Really easy to make, too.  I used cocoa powder instead of squares, no problem. I'm not sure how much I used, maybe something more than a tablespoon. I also added a little extra milk as suggested by other reviewers.

This was delicious!  It was really quick and easy to make.  About half-way through beating the butter, chocolate, sugar, and vanilla, I realized that I didn't have any milk.  So, I used half-and-half.  I'm not sure if this really added anything special to the recipe, but it definitely didn't hurt.  YUM.

This was really good. Definitely a "french silk" texture... but I don't know what I'd ever use it on. Maybe one of those 20 layer cakes where each layer is about 1/8th inch high.

Loved it! I did add 2 tablespoons more milk, and I used chocolate milk instead of whole milk. It wasn't too sweet. I will definitely use this one again, probably on brownies. Thanks for the great recipe!

Great recipe. I've been making this for over 25  years. However I never ever have unsweetened chocolate. So I always use this substitution.
6 Tablespoons of cocoa powder and increase butter in the recipe 7/8 of a cup.  that will be a total of 14 Tablespoons of butter for the recipe.  It works very nicely.

Perfect ... Just what I was looking for. Not too sweet. Light  and fluffy texture just like the vanilla frosting I regularly use.  Very  easy to make. And turned out delicious even though I had to substitute  cocoa powder and butter for the  baking chocolate. Thanks for a  wonderful recipe.

This recipe was perfect with the Black Magic Cake this site! The deep chocolate flavor of the cake is balanced perfectly with the lighter flavor of this frosting.  I often think that frosting can overwhelm a cake, and I end up leaving frosting on the plate after the cake is gone - but not with this combination!  Keepers both!

This is probably the best 'Non Buttercream' icing that I've ever found. I have used it for basic cupcakes to a 3 tier birthday cake. That being said I'm not sure how it would hold up to a larger sized cake unless you added more icing sugar to make it stronger/stiffer for the weight of a larger cake. All in all...this has been a family/friend and customer favorite. I will not use anything else. Thanks!

Wow!!!  Just finished making it 5 min ago & son & daughter are licking the bowl & spoons.  Very light - like bakery style.  I did take the suggestions of others & increased the serving size to 18.  Glad I did.  Extremely yummy & will now be my go to chocolate frosting.  BTW I didn't have chocolate squares so I used 1 ounce of cocoa instead.  Again, light texture & yummy!

I made this exactly as written and it was absolutely divine! I did increase the ingredients by half so as to have enough to frost the cake after reading some of the other reviews. I had just a little left over, but it was quickly devoured by my husband and daughter, who both sat in the floor like two small kids with a spoon in their hands and took turns taking bites of the leftovers. Excellent frosting with a truly wonderful taste!

The actual flavor of the frosting is very good. That said, it was too sweet for for me. I added a couple more tablespoons more milk than the recipe called for and whipped it. It was a light, fluffy, whipped, frosting. Perhaps I will cut back the sugar a bit the next time I try it.

I am not a fan of buttercream frostings BUT this recipe is amazing! The texture is smooth and silky and it is not too sweet. I added 1 tbl. of heavy whipping cream to 2 tbl. of milk. I also added       1 tbl. of espresso coffee to my melted chocolate. Perfect for cupcakes. P.S. Make sure you use a good quality butter.

This was very easy to make and came out nice and light, as promised.   Slightly bland, oily aftertaste, though (hence the four stars)-- maybe next time I'll try almond extract instead of vanilla, to give it a little bite.

I followed the recipe exactly, and it did indeed turn out really good. Its silky and its absolutely delicious. However, if you chew the frosting a bit you'll notice the grains of confectioner's sugar, which was a bit unpleasant. Otherwise, it is perfect for cakes/cupcakes. Its silky enough to be absolutely smooth and stiff enough to make pipe designs.

No disrespect, this is the traditional sicky heavy overly sweet American Buttercream.   I was so disapointed after reading the rave reviews, thinking this was something special.  Ah, well.  If you like oversweet frosting this is for you.  Again I DO appreciate the post and will return to the French cooked egg cream with a tenth of the sugar.

Fantastic recipe! Light, fluffy, smooth, and decadent! Especially if you add 1 teaspoon of softened cream cheese! :)

Yummy!  I made this along with Four Egg Yellow Cake (also from AR) for my son's third birthday.   It was a hit and everyone said they loved it.  Frosting tastes divine.

Amazing frosting! Loved by kids and adults! Very easy recipe and the taste is to die for! I used heavy whipping cream instead of milk as I find it has a better consistency for piping cakes. This frosting was so smooth and creamy with just the right amount of chocolate. Thank you so much for this amazing recipe!

For years I've been searching for the perfect frosting and have finally found it!  Not too think, not too thin, sweet and creamy and very easy to decorate with.

Wow, this frosting is amazing! Very easy to make, difficult to screw up, and tastes like heaven! I just now made it go on chocolate cupcakes and have it in the fridge; I'm starting to think I should've tripled the recipe because all want to do right now is grab a spoon and eat it all!

Delicious and super easy to whip up. I used the microwave to melt the chocolate with a bit of the butter before adding - worked great. I'll make a double batch next time because I did not have enough to frost my 24 cupcakes (made it through about 18 - i use a piping bag to frost).

I'm not a big fan of a lot of chocolate but this frosting had just the right amount. I made it even better by adding a couple heaping Tablespoons of peanut butter in with the melted chocolate. Used it to frost the Chocolate Cake ll from this site. Extra yummy.

Awesome recipe!  I added a little almond extract and did not have chocolate squares so I used cocoa powder instead.  This icing turned an ordinary chocolate cake into something special.  Thank you!

I didn't have to change the recipe at all. I did add cocoa instead of the chocolate squares. My whole family loved it! It was easy to whip up and JUST the right consistency to spread. Wonderful Recipe!

This was a great frosting, though I had to use cocoa powder rather than solid chocolate. It is a new family favorite!

This frosting is the bomb. Used a little more milk to get the right consistency. Used on a devil's food cake and it was perfect. Super easy- so much better than store bought!

I tried this a few years back with a yellow cake.  The chocolate flavor was so weak, it was a waste of chocolate squares. I recently retried this recipe on a dark chocolate cake - what a difference! I don't normally like chocolate icing on chocolate cake, but this is the perfect chocolate frosting for a dark chocolate cake. My only complaint this time was that the icing left my lips feeling a little slick - I'll definitely cut the butter back to a single stick.

Reading how more milk was needed, I automatically started with 1/4 c. milk.  Dismayed at finding out I was out of vanilla, I blindly substituted 1/4 tsp. of mint extract.  The frosting has a 'hint' of mint without being overpowering.  This is the best frosting recipe EVER and will use this in place of the store brands.  My kids just loved it!
