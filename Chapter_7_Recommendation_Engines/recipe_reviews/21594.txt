I was actually looking for more of a cake or buckle, so when i read the reviews describing this as such i gave it a try.  My family adores this recipe.  It tastes like a cobbler but is a cake, it's great.  I find, though, that i had to cook it almost 55 minutes... so I would advise checking it every 5 minutes after the recommended 40.

This is more like a 'buckle' than a cobbler, but so yummy. I followed the recipe as written, (had to add more milk & bake longer, about an hour.) I used blackberries, cause I'd been out picking them. I topped it w/crumb topping as in the 'Blueberry Buckle', recipe found in this site, & drizzled with glaze after it cooled. Made one for my friend & her family also & they all loved it. Thanks!!

This is DEFINATELY NOT a cobbler, but a pretty good coffee cake.  It needed a glaze.  I made a glaze for it.  1/2 cup powdered sugar, 1/2 teaspoon almond extract, 2 teaspoons water.  It was very good on the cake.  My family ate it up.  I also made it with frozen raspberries.  I didn't have any problems with the raspberries being frozen.  Will definately make again.

Great, quick recipe! The cobbler was cake-like, so it could easily be served as a coffeecake for breakfast. I used 1 cup raspberries and 1 cup blueberries -- turned out very pretty! Thanks for the recipe!

This was by far the worst dessert that I've ever made!  I cannotr believe that it has managed to get 4 stars!  It was raw in the middle and that was after letting it cook for an additional 20 minutes than the recipe called for.  Also, if you are looking for a "cobbler" this is NOT it!  This is pretty much just a glorified muffin.  Bottom line...  I was totally embarrassed and dissapointed when I served this dessert on Christmas Eve.  I couldn't even eat it and told my guests that it wouldn't hurt my feelings if they didn't like it.  

If you are looking for a nice cobbler recipe... keep lookin'

This is definitely more of a cake/muffin than a cobbler, but it was very good. I added blackberries, and sprinkled the top with cinnamon and sugar. Make sure it bakes long enough, I kept mine in about 10 minutes longer than the recipe called for and it was baked all the way through. Really good served warm with ice cream!

It's a great cobbler "cake" recipe.  I added extra blackberries in the mix and then topped with red raspberries before baking for a decorative touch.

My 4 year old daughter and I made this yesterday. This is more of a berry cake, than a cobbler, however it is very good.The cake was super moist. We used a deep dish pie plate to bake it in.  The only thing I will change next time is the type of berries. We used raspberries and the seeds were a pain. My husband (a chef) reccomended that, to use raspberries, to strain the seeds from the berries and put the puree in the cake. Not quite sure how that will work, but I guess you could make it a "marble" type cake. 
Either way, this was a super easy recipe, great to make with kids (the only way my daughter ate raspberries), and is an excellent summer dessert.

This turned out great! I actually read the last part of the directions wrong and didn't fold in the raspberries in I just spooned the batter on top of the raspberries, it still turned out wonderful!

This is good, but it's definitely not a cobbler.  I used blueberries, and it was just a giant blueberry muffin.

LOVE this! I make it quite often, and everyone loves it! As other have mentioned, it is more cake-like, and does tend to take longer to fully cook (usually right at an hour). I also add a bit of vanilla and cinnamon, and have used various fruits (blackberries, blurberries, strawberries, peaches, etc) but I don't fold them in. I put some (about 1/3) on the bottom of the pan, pour batter on top, the top with remaining fruit, allowing them to settle while baking.

Excellent with fresh cranberries.  Moist the next day.  Serve with ice cream.  Only used 3/4 cup sugar and sweetness was just right. Will try with blueberries next time.

I love this.  My best combo was fresh cherries and blueberries.  I have had no issues with it being undercooked as others have and when I make it I add a bit more milk to make it easier to fold in the delicate berries.  It comes out moist and irresistible.

Not a cobbler!  I knew this going into the recipe since I read most of the reviews.  Make this into a berry coffee cake or muffin and you will not be disappointed.  I sure was not.  I added about three cups of fresh strawberries.  This is really good!

So what... it's a cake and not a cobbler. Mine turned out awesome and the family wants more. I used 2/3 C. each: blackberry/raspberry/blueberry. And midway through preparation I realized I didn't have any milk. I substituted a vanilla muscle milk powder mix instead and it worked great! VERY YUMMY! Especially with whip.

Loved it! I made it with one bag of Europes best mixed berries instead of the 2 cups of raspberries. I also put about half a cup of the berries right on top before going in the oven. It was really good, but could have used a bit more berries. Next time I will use one and a half bags.

I made a few changes;  Used more milk (skim).  Just enough to make it easier to fold in the berries.  I used blackberries, blueberries and raspberries.  Subsituted Splenda for the sugar and used egg whites.  Was very good, lower calories and fat.  Will be making it again!

I read the reviews and because I wanted as close to a real cobbler I changed the recipe a bit.  I mixed my partially thawed berries with a little flour and sugar.  I then poured these in the bottom of my baking dish and spread the batter on top.  I then added pecans.  Baked for 50 min.  It was very good and I will probably make it again.

Great recipe, but not necessarily for a cobbler. It was more of a delicious cake/muffin. Instead of using 2 cups of raspberries, though, I used 1 cup of raspberries, 1 cup of blueberries, and 1 cup of blackberries (all fresh). I also added some cinnamon because I add cinnamon to everything, and it was great!! The cook time was a little low, i cooked it more like 50 minutes to an hour. I also used an 8x8 inch pan, to make the dessert denser. It was crispy golden on the outside, moist and warm on the inside (without being gooey and underdone), and I served it with a scoop of french vanilla ice cream. None was left!

Here's a tip, don't use frozen berries.
It got soggy in the places where the fruit had thawed while baking. The dough tasted great, but the baked taste was a little lacking for me. Perhaps it would work better with sweetened fresh berries.

This was very tasty and easy to make.  I suggest adding a warm fruit topping or sauce when serving.  Will also go great with ice cream.

Although it wasn't textured quite like the kind of cobbler I was thinking, it is still a very good-tasting recipe.  I put a frozen berry blend I had into it and used a 8 x 8 pan and had to cook it a bit longer, but I would definitely make it again because it took no time to prepare and already had all the ingredients!  The boyfriend loved it.

Tasted pretty good, but goes even better with warm custard! I followed the recipe closely, except I subbed in half blueberries and half strawberries...the strawberries really made the cake!

Tasty dessert!  Definitely not a cobbler, but delicious all the same.    I had to cook this dessert for 40 minutes, instead of the time mentioned in the recipe.    I would make it again, but instead of folding in the berries, I would top the berries with a thin layer of the batter.

This was good, however like others have stated this is Not a Cobbler!!!!! Definitely more like a muffin! But if you are looking for a good berry muffin rerecipe then I'd give this 3 or 4 stars.

Very easy to make and totally yummy.  I added some raw sugar to the top before baking and it gave it a nice crunch to the top.

TOTALLY LOVED IT (and so did my family & friends)!!!  So easy to make!  My household does not drink regular milk but used non-fat Lactaid milk in place of and also used a medley of berries (fresh chopped strawberries, blueberries & raspberries - over 2 cups of it) and it turned out great!  I baked it about 45 minutes.  This is totally a keeper!!! And just like the other reviewers indicated, it is like a cake like batter...Delish!!! Especially with vanilla ice cream!

This recipe is ok but not well named.  It's really not a cobbler at all--more like a very good coffee cake with fresh berries.  I used raspberries and it was delicious.  A little misleading by the name, though.

I made it with blackberries and It was just OK, it wasn't like a cobbler at all. It was more like a blackberry bread, it tasted alot like a scone.

I agree with other reviewers, this is not a cobbler. The taste is OK, (I used wild blackberries from my backyard) but the end result is more like a cake with berries than cobbler. The batter was very thick, so I added about 1/3 c. more milk. I baked it according to directions and it cooked perfectly. It was just OK, and with so many other recipes on this site to try, I doubt I make this again.

This was delicious!!!  I had some family coming over for a last minute visit so I needed to prepare something quick and this fit the bill.  I used frozen mixed berries I purchased from the store and had left over from another recipe.  And when those were not enough I added a few frozen cranberries.  They all loved it.  I did follow a reviewers advice and sprinkled sugar on top before baking and baking time is definitely too short.  I left mine in 15 minutes longer.

Pretty easy to make. I used a combination of raspberries and blackberries and used more than the 2 cups that the recipe called for. I also just poured part of the batter over top of the fruit as I thought too much batter was made anyway.

This is an awesome recipe! My whole family loved it and it was sooooo easy! I used 2 cups of frozen mixed berries and it came out excellent. I think I need to double the recipe so it will last longer next time. I agree it is more like a cake then a cobbler--but who cares! It's great! This is definately a WINNER! Thanks so much!

I have made this several times and generally always use 1 cup of milk instead of the 2/3 cup called for and bake a little longer. My family eats it up every time no matter what berries I put in it.

I had fresh picked raspberries that I had to use and came upon this recipe.  It turned out wonderful.  It is not a cobbler however.  More like a big muffin (next time I will make muffins out of it). I accidentally had the oven at about 370, used a round nine inch glass pie pan, and only had to cook for 35 minutes.....  Maybe that is the secret to cooking all the way through and not taking add'l time.  Another note - I particulary like this because it is not overly sweet :)

I didn't care for it (after taste), but my hubby thought it was good because it was a heavy cake. We didn't have raspberries so I used blueberries & peaches as others have suggested. I think there are better cobbler recipes on this site & don't know if I'd make again or not.

This was a good recipe as is-I was looking for something healthy so the second time I made it, I used half whole wheat flour and a dash each of cinnamon and nutmeg.  Good recipe with little grease and a reasonable amount of sugar> not calorie ridden. Nice flavor, texture, sweetness. I used frozen mixed berries and it was pretty.  Mmmmmmmmm.

If you're looking for a "cobbler" please keep looking.  If you're looking for a great snack cake you've found it!  My family loved this cake.  I did make some changes.  First I substituted canola oil for the butter.  I also added 1 tsp. of cinnamon and 1/3 cup mini chocolate chips to the batter.  Baking time was closer to 60 minutes.  I kept checking every 5 minutes after 40.  We are always on the lookout for recipes that will work in a Dutch oven and my son's scout troop is going to try this one out the next time they camp; using frozen raspberries instead of fresh.

I just made this with fresh blackberries, and it turned out great. It is more like a coffee cake than a cobbler as other reviewers have stated, but it is still fantastic. I baked it for about 45 minutes. I also drizzled a lemon glaze over each piece.

This was a very nice cake indeed, quick and easy with ingredients with I typically have on hand. I really liked it.  I did add maybe a quarter to half teaspoon of cinnamon and a quarter teaspoon of freshly grated nutmeg to the batter as I feel the taste compliments the raspberries.  I used frozen raspberries and baked this close to an hour. Lovely homey appeal and flavor.  I will make this again!  Thank you, Sheila, for your submission!

This is more like berry muffins; not a cobbler. It was good and easy but should be renamed.

I home school our three children whom are ages 11.5, 10.5, and 8.5 yrs old. Each help me in the kitchen as part of the home ec/life studies that are part of their courses. 

My 10.5 y/o daughter Claire prepared this dessert tonight and served it with french vanilla ice cream. It was a nice take on the cobblers that tend to be more juicy than other filling. 

Everyone loved it and weren't just being nice because a novice cook made it. She has been helping in meal planning and preping for a while now; but this recipe is really tasty and easy to fix and not time consuming. 

I stood by and advised her, but from start to finish of preping it took very little time-under twenty minutes. The cook time varies according to ovens but overall since we doubled the recipe I alotted about an hour for it. So, I hope that others will try this one and enjoy. It is a great recipe for beginning cooks to begin with. Oh, by the way, Claire made hers with triple berry mix of blue/black/raspberries. I want to try other mixes with this one, too.

Thanks for this chance for our two cents.

This recipe was an AWFUL recipe if you were looking for a cobbler recipe.  However if you are looking for a muffin or bread recipe this is a GREAT recipe.  You will need more time than was designated, I needed 10 extra minutes.  I also substituted frozen blackberries for the raspberries and the recipe still turned out ok.

After reading other reviews I was prepared for 'cake.'  What I got was a dessert bread with a strong taste of baking powder.  Surprisingly, I only needed the stated 35 minutes to cook.  Perhaps it's an altitude thing.  This recipe needs more tweaking to be worth my time.

Excellent recipe.  Very moist and not as sinful as a regular cobbler.  I used fresh wild blackberries.

I used this with fresh marion berries; and topped with granulated sugar before placing in the oven - got rave reviews from guests, wonderful when served with fresh vanilla ice cream.

Not cooked all the way through in the center - I let it cook for the full 40 minutes.  Might recommend trying for an additional 5 minutes or so.

Definitely more of a muffin than a cobbler.  It was good, but there are better recipes (both cobbler & muffin) for fresh berries.

Awesome!  Although I'd say it's closer to cake than traditional cobbler, it is wonderful and delicious.  I was able to cut fat and cholesterol by using skim milk and substituting an egg white for 1 of the 3 tablespoons of butter.  Also, this recipe benefits from additional berries.

This turned out beautifully for me, I only gave it 4 stars because I changed it slightly. I had some thawed raspberries  and a lot of the juice from them in the fridge and did not know what to do with it. Instead of the milk, I used about 1/2 raspberry juice and 1/2 light cream. It was like a cake, but so flavourful. Like another cook here I put a glaze with almond extract in it.  So delicious.

Very easy, I didn't change anything, and as others have commented, this is more of a cake than a cobbler (which is sort of what I was craving anyway).  My family loved it, and I'll make it again when berries are plentiful.

Loved this easy recipe - used raspberries and blackberries- added a 1/2 tsp cinnamon and 1 tsp vanilla.  Scrumptuous!!   Only one hitch - some  mauve liquid at bottom - will bake 5-7 minutes longer than 1 hour.  Didn't cut like cake?????  but like a cobbler!  Didn't take away from wonderful taste!

This recipe makes a very dry dough.  Even after increasing the milk to a full cup and adding another egg, the end result was still dry and lacking in flavor.

My whole  family loved this! I am  making it again with my fresh raspberries. I put this recipe in a 9 x 13 pan and it baked perfectly. I   I don't know why you would want to put it in a 9 x 9 pan. It's way too thick and will never cook in the middle without burning the edges. I put a streusel on top and drizzled a glaze over it made of  powdered sugar, vanilla and water.

Pro-Tip: Don't use store bought frozen mixed berries! This probably would have come out a lot better had I defrosted them instead of following the bag and putting them in frozen for 'best results'. Came out squishy, cake-like and burnt from needing to cook it for an extra ten minutes. 
Heed the warning, use fresh berries!

I've made it three times with berries that I froze myself.  Although we don't consider it a traditional cobbler, we like it very much.  I recommend thawing the berries and if they produce a lot of liquid (like strawberries) drain some or all off before you add them.  Otherwise, you may end up with too much liquid that won't cook in the middle.

I overcooked it a little, making it a bit cakier than I would have liked. However, the tart raspberries with the sweet cake made this delightful! Very good- will do again.

This is a great recipe! My husband loved it! It is also a very pretty cobbler I think and has a nice texture to it.

This is a very easy recipe, however it does need to bake about 50 minutes. It is not overly sweet and would make a great brunch dish. I made a glaze with 1 cup of powdered sugar and juice from 1/2 of a lemon, it was the right amount of sweet/sour to put a finishing tough on this cake.

I have a habit of changing recipes, so I'm afraid I can't vouch for the true deliciousness of the recipe as written, but what I made was very tasty!  I replaced the AP flour with whole wheat pastry flour (which made the end result a little chewier than it probably should be) and I reduced the volume of sugar by half (and substituted Splenda, anyway), and used applesauce in place of the butter.  I had to add another 1/3 cup milk, possibly because of the whole wheat flour, but others said they needed more liquid, too. Used blueberries, baked for 40 minutes, and for me, that was enough. I cut the result into 16 small-ish squares (out of an 8x8 pan) and they are only about 75 calories/square.  Excellent for when I need a low cal sweet treat!  Freezes and thaws quite well!

Pretty Good : )  I had to bake almost 1 hour.  I used fresh raspberries that I had bought and put in the freezer until I decided what I was going to do with them.  Thanks for a good recipe!

This is definitely a cake like dessert. It's not a cobbler. Not too bad but not what I was looking for.

I have made this recipe many times now. It's my husbands favorite! He likes it better than traditional Cobbler. I make it and serve it with Vanilla ice cream and a berrie puree. I use all different berries. It does however take closer to an hour to cook. Fantastic easy and quick!

This was an exceptional berry cobbler.  My cooking class of very young students gobbled it up!  Easy too!

If you are looking for a cobbler this is NOT it.  Terrible recipe and a waste of wonderful blackberries.  I wish I could give it a rating of zero.  DON"T USE THIS RECIPE!!!

We had just picked a quart of blackberries (4 cups) so we doubled this recipe.  I wanted more of a cobbler so I dumped the berries in a 9x13 pan and then put the crust mixture on top.  I sprinkled some sugar on it and baked it for almost 55 minutes.  It was absolutely delicious and gone in 2 days!
