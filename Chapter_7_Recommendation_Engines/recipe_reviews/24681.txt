DELICIOUS!!!! I never make pork chops, but my husband loves them, and I made these and they were awesome, and so much healthier than pan-fried!!
The only changes I made were using Italian Seasoned Bread Crumbs and I dipped the pork chops in flour before dipping them in the egg mixture. Also, when I flipped the chops, I sprayed the pan again with some non-stick spray and sprayed the tops of the pork chops. They were nice and crunchy!

This recipe is simple and tastes great.  I made some changes.  I didn't use milk, just egg for dipping and used seasoned Italian bread crumbs instead of stuffing mix.  I also browned them on each side in a little bit of olive oil in a frying pan before baking them. They came out great. My fussy kids even ate them!  Occasionally,I also substitute the pork chops for chicken strips.  Great recipe.

Tastes great!  You just have to be careful not to cook the pork chops too long or they can get chewy.  I've learned that when they begin to get a little brown, they are done.  Don't wait until the outside is thoroughly crispy.

This is an EXCELLENT recipe.  Although I had to go to the grocery store to get eggs, milk and butter the recipe was VERY simple.   I mean, who has eggs, milk and butter laying around the kitchen (not a single, hard-working 24 ear old). ;)   I couldn’t decide what recipe to make last night, “Oven-Fried Pork Chops,” “Mothers-Best Pork Chops” or “World’s Greatest Pork Chops.”  I settled for “Oven-Fried Pork Chops," although the name wasn't as bombastic and I am glad I did.  I added a little garlic and parmesan cheese to the mix and they turned out MOUTH-WATERINGLY DELIGHTFUL. Wolfgang, who loves pork chops as much as Homer Simpson said they are the best CHOPS he’s ever had but that they still don’t rank up there with my tuna casserole.  For what it’s worth, I think he needs admitted to a mental institution…so take his opinion with a grain of salt.

I thought this was the easiest and juiciest pork chops I have ever encountered.  I used the pepperidge farms herb stuffing and I used 2 egg yolks with out the milk for it to stick better.  I also patted the pork chops with paper towels before I dipped them into the yolks.  With the stuffing, I crushed them a little more so it would stick better.  This is an awesome pork chop.

Tasty and easy. I used Italian-style bread crumbs instead of the stuffing mix and it worked great.

This was good but not great.  I did as another reviewer did and used Italian Seasoned Bread Crumbs because I didn't have dry bread stuffing mix - I figured it's pretty much the same thing.  I didn't use the milk and the coating stuck to the chops just fine.  I used very thin pork chops and baked them as directed.  They tasted fine and we'll probably make them again.  Hubby liked them also.  I don't usually give a 5 star unless we are blown away by a recipe and we find a 4 star is something we love and a 3 star is acceptable.  I don't understand folks who rate everything a 5 star - if you do that then there's no way to define awesome from plain old good enough!

This was really good.  I used Pam instead of butter.  They tasted really good and were more tender than most pork chops I've had.  However, the breading did start to get a little soggy towards the end.  I will definitely make it again but I will place them on a rack next time so they get crispy.

Forgetting the butter, place a rack on a baking sheet, spray the chops lightly with butter flavored cooking spray or margarine and place on the rack. No need to turn and they get crispy on both sides.

Easy weeknight recipe. I served it with pilaf and steamed broccoli and only spent 15 minutes in the kitchen.

Great recipe!  The pork chops were very tender.  I did cut down the butter to about 2 tablespoons.  Will make again!

I've been making this recipe for almost 4 yrs after someone brought this to my house for my family after I had surgery.  It is one of my family's favorite meals.  I've found that the pork flavored stuffing mix enhances the flavor even more.  I also only use boneless cuts because my kids don't like having to cut around the bone.  The best thing is to buy a pork loin (on sale!) and have the meat dept slice it into 1/3 inch slices.  You can freeze what you don't need for another meal later.

Heres a much simpler and tasty way to make these. Spoon out onto plate about 1/2 cup of recuded fat mayonaise. Slather over pork chops, dip in italian bread crumbs. Place on sprayed or oiled cookie sheet and bake at 350 for about 20/30 min. flip over once with spatula. easy juicy pork chops. If you prefer spicier, add choice of seaoning to mayo and use plain bread crumbs.

I loved the idea of this but I wasn't convinced the herb-seasoned stuffing would be seasoned enough for our tastes or that the pork chops would turn out with a moist, crisp and golden brown coating. So rather than adding seasoning and drizzling them with a little oil, I came across "Homemade Shake and Bake Mixture" from this site and followed the recipe using the herb seasoned stuffing mix. It was just what I was after.  I did smear a littlle pure olive oil on a foil-lined cookie sheet and followed the directions to bake at 425 for 10 minutes, turn the pork chops, then bake for an additional 10 minutes.  The coating was crispy and golden brown, the meat tender and moist. The combination of the two recipes proved to be a real winner.

My husband is a pork chop fan and since I have altered his eating choices so much (he has actually trimmed down) as of late, I decided to break down and find him a recipe for them that did not require frying. I followed this recipe to the letter and they were so awesome that I even tasted them (& i hate pork).   Great job on submitting this one!  Will definitely make again sometime in the future.

I always drizzle my meat with a little cider vinegar before cooking and have never had a tough piece of meat yet. This is a very quick, easy entree. Thanks.

Yum! We loved these chops. Simple, inexpensive, and delicious. My chops were super thick, center-cut ones, so I cooked mine for about 30-35 minutes. Juicy on the inside, crunchy on the outside. Thanks! :)

These came out nice and crunchy.  What I did though that is not mentioned was preheat the butter/olive oil with the pan so that when I added the pork chops to the pan they started sizzling right away.

This quickly became one of our favorite ways to make pork chops. I'm not a huge fan of pork chops, but they are wonderful like this. I recommend just a few small changes: Use seasoned bread crumbs - I like the italian kind - instead of the stuffing mix. Dip in egg mix then bread crumbs then repeat. You'll want to beat up two eggs to accomodate. Use half butter and half olive oil. Now here is the real trick to make this extra easy: put the butter and oil in the baking dish and put in the preheating oven. When the chops are prepped, the butter is melted and ready to go. I always use more than 2 tablespoons combined and when I flip them half way through I add a little more oil. Another tip to improve this greatly: Bake at only 350 degrees, 15 minutes per side. They come out perfect and crispy this way.

This is a great recipe for a busy mom.  My 2 year old ate every bite!  I pounded out my chops a little bit and sprinkled them with pepper and kosher salt.  I dredged them in flour, then the egg mixture, and then the stuffing.  I cut the butter in half and baked for 10 min.  Then I put the other half of the melted butter over the top of the chops before I turned them over for the next 10 min of cook time.  I also used wax paper as my work surface (one for the flour and one for the stuffing).  When I was done I just tossed away!  Little to no clean up!  While the chops baked, I cut up some potatoes with the skin on and boiled them. Then I microwaved a box of corn in butter sauce.  I had dinner on the table in 45 min.  Plus it was a lighter way of cooking and it tasted like it had been deep fried!  A keeper for sure.  Thanks!
And I might add - not sure what happened to the reviewer before me but I used Pepperidge Farm Herb Seasoned Stuffing and it was not the cubed kind.  It was a little chunky but I worked the little crumbs into the pork till it was fully covered.  Some of the "chunks" of bread gave it the crispy texture without the deepfried mess and calories.

This was a cinch to make and turned out delicious.  I used seasoned stuffing croutons and I crushed them with a rolling pin. I baked them on a Pampered Chef baking stone.  The key, is making sure your oven is preheated and the butter is hot before placing chops in the pan.  They did not stick nor were they soggy.  I think the times listed were right on. This was a great alternative to pork chops oon the grill.  Thanks Rachel

The first time I made these, I used butter and I didnt like the way they turned out.  The second time, I just used butter spray and they were awesome.  I also ground my stuffing to make it stick easier.  Thanks so much.  I love this fast and inexpensive recipie.

Was OK. Breading came off pretty easy and was kind of soggy, and this was after I cooked for 10 on one side, 15 on other. Pork chop was just a tad over done, not bad though. Was hoping for s crispier crust.

I just tried this recipe for pork chops.Very tender. Instead of stuffing,I also used Italian bread crumbs.I not only used the spices listed,I also added seasoned salt,oregano,basil,garlic powder,and three Mrs.Dash(Original,Chicken,and Table Blend). I mixed them with the milk and egg.I also used Soy Milk.I used Smart Balance oleo.I let it melt in the pan,in the oven.
My fiancee said they were the best chops he ever had(and he loves pork chops).

Delicious...Instead of using stuffing mix, I had some Texas Toast croutons leftover, and I mashed them up into fine crumbs.  The flavor was really tasty, and it did not interfere with the crunchiness of the outside.

Made as listed,, will make again with the following changes: omit the milk, turn oven temp down to 400 degrees as 425 caused the coating to burn, add seasonings such as salt, pepper and herbs.

Did not try this exact recipe.

Before doing anything with either pork chops (with or without bone) let sit for about 20 minutes at room temperature.  Then use paper towel(s) to pat dry.  You will find that this makes a big difference in how they cook in dry heat (oven, skillet or grill) or in some type of oil (vegetable, butter, olive, etc).  You may also want to season the meat directly before any type of wash (egg/milk) and coating are applied and let sit for 10 minutes to give time for them, the seasonings, to be absorbed.  Adding something like a liquid smoke and/or Worcestershire sauce to the wash might also help.  While this calls for a stuffing mix, you can use crushed corn flakes or crackers instead and add a few dry seasoning such as onion powder, garlic powder, cayenne, paprika, Italian seasoning, etc as your tastes desire along with salt and pepper.

If you use a baking dish, try lining the bottom (shinny side up) and covering (shinny side down) with aluminum foil to prevent the coating from burning.  If you desire a little healthier and crisper outcome use a wire rack instead of letting the chops soak in the grease (butter or oil) as this recipe indicates and only use aluminum foil to line the bottom pan (shinny side up).

By the way, these are just suggestions but they have helped me out and are concept techniques that can be used in other recipes and other meats like chicken.

I seasoned panko bread crumbs with salt, pepper, red pepper flakes and cajun seasoning.  I didn't have any milk, so dipped chops in egg only then into breadcrumbs.  I cooked on wire racks 400 degrees for 30 minutes (didn't have to flip due to wire rack).  Very tasty and easy.

These are VERY good, though I too changed a couple of things... I hate eggs so I didn't use the eggs or the milk. I just rinsed them in water. I also only had corn flake crumbs, not herb seasoned stuffing mix. I am disabled so I can't just run out to the store, or I would have. With the corn flake crumbs, these were easily the BEST pork chops I have EVER eaten. Crispy and tender. I will try them with the herb seasoning, but I really did like the corn flake crumbs. They come in a box and I also use them to do chicken. I don't know why I didn't think to use them on pork chops. I'll never cook them my old way again!

I made this recipe with chicken last week and it was delicious.  I followed a suggestion of spraying the chicken with spray oil after turning to make it crispy and it was a great suggestion.  My daughter made it for her husband two nights later and he loved it too.

I cooked these for 15 minutes each side because they were on the thick side (still bleeding when I flipped them). Other than that I followed the recipe exactly.   I'm sorry to say that I ended up with a pan full of soggy breading that wouldn't stick to the chops, which were so rubbery I can't cut through them.   Not sure what went wrong, but I won't be wasting $10 in meat again to find out.

It's easy to overcook this, however since I had no stuffing mix i actually made do with the following in a food processor.
1/2 cup corn flakes; 1/4 cup oatmeal; 1/8 cup sliced almods; 1/8 cup honey wheat Wheat Things sticks; 1 tbsp onion powder; 1 tbsp garlic powder; 1/2 tbsp italian season.

So yummy!! Lightly spritzed the dish w/ cooking spray and placed tabs of butter around the meat before putting it in the oven. Also used seasoned breadcrumbs since it was all I had. Took about 30 min to cook. My husband and I devoured this!!

These were so good I ate some for breakfast the next day! I coated the chops with flour, then egg, and used stove top stuffing crushed as the bread stuffing mix. I will certainly be making this one again, for its simplicity, and its yummyness!

This recipe is a great "base" to start from however I found it needed some tweaking...First I seasoned the pork with garlic powder, pepper and poultry seasoning then dredged the meat in a mixture of seasoning salt and flour, dipped in eggwash and then into italian seasoned bread crumbs. Also I added 10 more minuets to bake time. We did really like it after some adjustments were made!

I added california garlic salt and I used the progresso italian bread crumbs.  Did the rest according to the recipe and it was really great!  My pork chops were really thick so I added another 10 minutes to the cooking time.  Super easy!!!!

4 STARS with CHANGES......The concept of this recipe was good but I made some changes based on other reviews.  First, I made a rub of kosher salt, ground black pepper, small amt of crushed red pepper flakes, rosemary and basil.  After grinding the spices together extra fine in the food chopper, I sprinkled both sides of the chops and patted the spices in well.  I dredged each chop in first in flour, then egg/milk mixture, then italian style breadcrumbs.  To insure the breading sticks, let the chops "rest" in the refrigerator for 30 minutes.  While the chops 'rest', I put olive oil in the the pan and heat in the 425 degree oven until sizzling hot.  Add the chops to the heated pan and cook for 10 minutes per side.  PERFECT.  Our 4 kids (ages 9-12) all had seconds.  Served with mashed potatoes, steamed broccoli and rolls.  I practically got a standing ovation.

This recipe is sooooo simple and delicious!  The pork chops come out tender and you can season them to your liking.  I have even made it with out the egg and melted butter and it comes out about the same.

I usually just make fried pork chops they are good but they are fried which is unhealthy. SO I found this recipe and was so skeptical about it. It was great. Tasty. Easy to make too. Fast too. 5 stars! I made one change because i didnt have that bread mix, i used italian season bread crumbs.

Great go-to recipe for a quick porkchop dish.  I also used breadcrumbs instead of stuffing just 'cause that's what I had in the pantry.  My 2 and 4 year-olds even liked it!

I was looking forward to making this, but was kind of disappointed with the outcome.  The dry bread stuffing mix hardly stayed on the porkchops, and browned very quickly in the oven, and the porkchop itself was flavourless.  I wouldn't make this again.

I Loved this recipe and so did my Boyfriend. I used italian seasoned bread crumbs with imported romano cheese, the bread crumbs were like $ 1.88! and the dish tasted amazing. I served it with apple chutney and stuffing from a box ( stove top ) and it was a hit at my house and seriously the whole dinner took less than 30 minutes. I will be making this again and again....

Excellent.  I followed the most helpful reviewer's tips. I don't care for pork chops and I ate all of mine.  If you use boneless, make sure you brine the meat first.

My twist. Try brining the chops, for an hour. Pat dry. Use the three step method. Put the chops in the freezer, while the  oven preheats. This will insure, every thing will be at the same temp, and cook, more evenly.
Good sub for Shake N Bake.
 I have used this method for years. From frying, to baking.

I am making this recipe right now and I am concerned the fact that it is posted that this recipe  only takes 20 minutes to cook, I am now at 35 mins. and the are starting to burn but they are no where near being done, have I done something wrong I can't serve pork chops that are not done. I am very very disappointed in the fact that this time is way off and my dinner is now way behind.

I made this with a few variations. I wanted them really crunchy, so I dipped each chop in an egg-and-pepper wash (skipped the milk), breaded in the stuffing mix, and placed on a metal rack over a cookie sheet, instead of laying in a baking dish coated with butter. My chops were pretty thick, so they took about 30 minutes to bake. Came out perfectly crunchy and the stuffing mix gave a great flavor. Several reviews mentioned using bread crumbs in place of stuffing mix. I've baked pork chops breaded with bread crumbs many times and it is not the same. The chunky texture of the stuffin mix really makes this different. Great recipe. I might add a little cayenne to the egg wash next time for a little more kick. Otherwise, I'll definitely make this again.

Very delicious and UNIQUE way to make pork chops!  I. Am disturbed that so many people substituted bread crumbs and missed out on the crunchy flavorful coating.  So be sure to use STUFFING MIX :)  I used chicken flavored stuffing, ran it through my food chopper to make it less course.  No egg so I soaked chops briefly in milk seasoned with garlic powder, s&p.  Cooked on my aerrated pizza pan and sprayed both sides with cooking spray. Thank you for this change of pace, or taste rather, from the usual ol' boring breadcrumbs!

This recipe is great, but I did modify it quite a bit. Here were my modified steps (for added crunchiness): 1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees. 2. Heat coconut oil (or olive oil) in a frying pan to medium heat. 3. Pour butter into a 9x13 inch baking pan. 4. Stir together egg, milk and pepper (use slightly less milk or no milk). 5. Dip chops in flour before dipping in egg mixture. 6. Dip pork chops in egg mixture, coat with bread crumbs. 7. Coat with flour again. 8. Dip in egg mixture a 2nd time then apply another coat of bread crumbs. 9. Place in frying pan. 10. Brown chops slightly on both sides. 11. Place in oven pan. 12. Spray chops lightly with non-stick spray before cooking. 13. Bake in preheated oven for 10 minutes.  14. Turn chops and spray other side with non-stick spray. 15. Bake for another 10 minutes, or until no pink remains in the meat and juices run clear.

This was ok, slightly flavorless and the butter made it too greasy. Will try again with modifications.

Excellent recipe - after reading many of the reviews, we used Italian Seasoned Bread Crumbs and preheated the butter in the glass baking dish. We baked  two thick pork chops at 425 degrees for 30 minutes - turing over after the first 15 minutes. The pork chops were delicious!!! This is definitely a keeper of a recipe.Thank you RACHELHACKER !

I'm giving it five stars because it was so easy and so delicous.  I cooked my thick bone in pork chopse for 30 mins instead of 20 because we like them with very littl pink if any.  I was worried they would be chewy, but they were juicy and flavorful.  When you taste them, you wont believe how easy.  I defenilty lightly salted my chops first and used some parmesan but other than that prepared exactly as recipe called.

I have made this recipe before but forgot about it until today when I needed a recipe for my thawed 8pack of pork loin chops. I read the most recent reviews and decided to use Italian bread crumbs and they turned out amazing! My advice to improve the recipe: add some salt and garlic to the egg, pepper and milk mix. Also make sure to not surpass the 10 min on each side or you could end up with over cooked pork chops. Thanks for posting this recipe!

I did not care for this recipe. The chops came out so soggy and I followed the recipe exactly as written, cook time was way more then 20 min for mine. Will not be making this again.

Turned out great! Healthier than frying, yet the crispy texture! I actually used regular bread crumbs, and it was perfect! :)

This is a great, quick way to make chops. My were tasty, tender and fast.  I cooked them 5 minutes longer than called for to get a more crispy coating, but the rest was exactly as written and delicious. My boyfriend loved them too.

This is the second time I have made these, and they are so good! I'm not typically a fan of pork in general, but these are great. Here's a tip: I use shake and bake instead of stuffing. I think it gives it a crunchier exterior. Also, I use 3 Tbsp. of butter instead of 2 because it covers the bottom of the baking dish more thoroughly. Finally, I give the pork chops a sprinkle of onion powder when I turn them for some added flavor. These are great with applesauce and are definitely a dinnertime staple!

I didn't have bread crumbs, so I used Stove Top stuffing that I crushed up.  I also cooked them in my toaster oven.  They were very juicy, and the 10 minutes per side was perfect for the thick chops I had to register them fully cooked inside (meat thermometer always!)

These were pretty good, but not as good as "Famous pork chops" from this site. I omitted the milk as others had suggested. I served it with Zatarans dirty rice and broccoli.

Amazingly good! Perfectly crispy while oh-so-tender and juicy inside. Next time I'll add some garlic powder or garlic salt for a bit more pop. :-D

These turned out really good and tender, just wished the breading browned more.  But overall quick, easy, and tasted great.  Will make again.

Just finished eating these delicious pork chops!  I took the advice of another review and sprayed the pan again when I flipped them, and sprayed the top of them.  Made some peppered white gravy with them, yum yum!  Thanks for one of my new favorite recipes!

I'm not a fan of pork chops, but my husband is.  I made these for him tonight, and they were quite good.  He really liked them.  I decided to try them based on the other reviews.  Like some of the others, I substituted bread crumbs because I didn't have stuffing mix, but I had to add seasonings because I only had plain bread crumbs.  (Added oregano, thyme, basil.)   I omitted the milk.  I think I would add a little more butter or non-stick spray when I flip them next time because they stuck on the 2nd side.  And because I'm always paranoid about cooking pork long enough, I cooked them about 12 minutes on the first side and 16-17 minutes on the second side.  (I checked them after 10 minutes on the 2nd side, and they were stuck, so the fact that I cooked them longer had nothing to do with the sticking.  I unstuck them with a spatula after  10 minutes and then continued cooking another 6-7 minutes.  Not all the pieces stuck; some of the smaller ones that curled up didn't stick.  The large ones all did.)

My very picky daughter loves these!!!  Instead of butter I spray a cookie sheet w/ canola cooking spray, and then I lightly spray the top of the chops as well.  They are crispier that way, and have less fat.

I followed the recipe but found the crust came off in the oven.  I think it would have been better fried in a pan of olive oil.  I will do that the next time.  It was also a bit bland for our likings so next time i will definitely add more seasonings.

When I told my husband we were having pork chops for dinner, he didn't say anything - the last time I cooked them, they were dry and chewy...and I knew he was not looking forward to a repeat.  Instead,  I used this recipe (so easy) and, after a few bites, he asked what I'd done., saying how moist they were.  They looked wonderful and tasted great!  This recipe is quick enough for meals in a rush, but I would also serve them to guests.  I served them with some freshly prepared applesauce - great!

These are definitely the way to go for any easy, quick recipe that is healthier than pan frying!  I made the recipe as is and my kids (even my 1 year old) LOVE them.  My husband doesn't usually eat pork chops, but he will eat these.  I make them at least every couple of weeks!  :)

This is awesome! I used bread crumbs (panko) and seasoned them with all purpose seasoning and some extra pepper. I imagine the stuffing would be great and then you wouldn't need to season. I did need to cook longer than stated here since I had really thick pork chops (Maybe 30-35 minutes?) but the breading did not burn and the chops were very moist.

I served this to dinner guests and received nothing but accolades.  It was quick and easy, presentation was beautiful, and the meat was juicy, delicious, and I served with smashed garlic potatoes, garden salad and fresh bread.  So simple but was a very big hit.

Absolutely delicious and moist!  I was surprised at how easy this recipe was.  I took the advice of others and used bread crumbs instead of the stuffing mix. They were the garlic and herb kind and made a nice coating.  I also increased the cooking time by 10 minutes or so, but this could just be the difference in my oven.  I've been cooking for a while now, but I am by no means an expert so I always look for quick and easy meals to make during the week.  I've finally found another pork chop recipe worth keeping.  Thanks for sharing.

We LOVED this recipe! Usually my husband can't cook unless it comes in a box with directions on the side. But, even HE can do this. It's so easy, but is so delicious. I spend less time and prep work making this than a box meal and I know exactly what ingredients my family are getting. I had planned to cook this one night and realized we were out of pork chops so I used chicken instead. Another favorite. We served it with chicken gravy - wonderful! You'll love it. Easy prep, easy clean up, ingredients you probably already have, it's delicious!

I could tell after I turned the pork after the first 10 minutes that this recipe wasn't going to come out good.  After 20 minutes of baking at 425 the breading was still "goo".  Go on to the next one.

I do not understand how anyone can rate a recipe without trying it exactly the way it was written.  This was an excellent recipe.  Please try the recipe before criticizing and changing it.  five stars to Rachel Hackers oven fried pork chops.*****

Made this tonight for supper and they were wonderful!  I followed the recipe as is except I added a shake of garlic powder to the egg mixture.  They were tasty and moist!  I will definitely make them again.

Really liked this recipe...so simple and tasty!  I ran out of milk so I, like other reviewers, just rinsed the pork chops with water and sprinkled them with garlic salt and pepper.  Then dipped them in two beaten eggs and then in Italian Seasoned bread crumbs.  Also, when preheating the oven to 400 (not 425 as suggested), let the butter melt during the preheating.  Then put the the pork chops in the baking dish and baked per instructions.  Did cut the cooking time down though...after 10 minutes and flipping them, cooked them for only a few more minutes...then checked them with a temperature thermometer...they were done! Very surprised...thought they'd take longer since I could only find the boneless thick cut pork chops at the store.  Key, as others have said, is to not overcook the chops.  They came out tender and tasty.  Next time will maybe try the stuffing per the instructions but didn't have any on hand tonight.  Great recipe!  Thanks for sharing!

I followed this recipe, and I was skeptical, because of cooking pork for only 20 minutes. My pork chops, which were not thick at all, were not done when my husband and I cut into them. Because the breading was already starting to burn, I cooked them for 45 minutes more at 350 degrees. I am surprised that so many people liked this. I will not make this recipe again.

I have used this recipe several times with success. I have always wondered why people make all sorts of changes to a recipe and the give it a 3 or 4 star rating. "I didn't have any stuffing mix so I used seasoned bread crumbs or corn flake crumbs or crushed crackers or Panko or crushed croutons. Instead of egg wash, I slathered them with mayo. I browned them first in a frying pan and then complained when the coating burned in the oven" Wouldn't all of these changes make it a new recipe?

I gotta admit I like shake and bake for pork chops when I'm pressed for time. this recipe had my wife gnawing the bone :) I didn't use milk either. I dipped in egg then breaded them and had to leave the house for 45 minutes. the chops were refrigerated. I got home and baked my very thick, bone-in center cut chops about 25 minutes. 10 minutes before the flip. excellent, moist and terrific taste. great with baked sweet taters and roasted broccoli.

As I was monging on the leftovers, which I deep fried heheh, I realized I loved the taste! I wish I could upgrade my rating to 4 stars! Once the coating is crispy it really is a great idea! Stuffing mix would go well with turket breat filets, which are often on sale at the grocery, and I will very MUCH make this recipe again! I just have to make sure I get it crispy!  ^__^

I just took a minute to watch this video and although I love pork chops they never seem to turn out right without being dried out and with no flavor.  I am not a fancy cook and was amazed at how simple this was.  The timing is right on for 10 minutes each side at 425.  Could have been teeny bit less actually but never dried out.  I used 1/2" pork chops and when they are completed cooking the bread crumbs are crunchy and not overpowering with herb flavor. The meat was tender and not overcooked.  They were a hit tonight and I would have never thought to cook these until I saw my daily All Recipies email hint.  Love this sight.  After 47 yrs I am starting to enjoy cooking again.

Very tasty and the pork was tender. I used Stove Top Stuffing and crushed it into a finer mix so it coated more of the pork chop.

Good, I like the little crunch on the outside.  When flipping though I'd spray a touch of cooking spray on the outside to help it crisp up a litlte bit.  Also w/ thick chops you'll need about 25min instead of 20.  Of course remember to season your crumb coating and the chops prior.

For over 35 years I have tried almost every pork chop recipe available, with varying degrees of success. This recipe, by far, was my favorite. My husband, who normally just tolerates pork chops, raved about them. Easy. Moist. Delicious.

Very easy and the most moist and tender pork chops I have ever made.  I used Italian bread crumbs as that is all I had and it needs more seasoning if you use these.  Next time I will either add more seasoning or try the stuffing mix.  I also used very thick,  1 1/2 inch boneless chops and cooked for 15 minutes on each side -- perfect.  I have never had luck with chops before, usually too dry, but these were moist and tender.  This is my go to recipe for cooking chops in the future!

This recipe was so easy, quick and so good! I usually have a hard time with pork chops, they turn out tough and dry unless their covered in a cream soup. When I tried this recipe last night for the first time, they came out very juicy and delish! My kids were even asking for seconds and that rarely happens when I make pork chops. My hubby even gave rave reviews :) No alterations were made to the recipe itself, but I did keep them in for about 5 mins. longer just because my oven is finicky. Definitely a keeper!

Sorry to report negatively but followed this recipe to the letter - resulting in bready, tasteless, dry chops! Recipe gives no indication of thickness of chops to use - consequently cooking time can vary significantly. I checked with a thermometer at 3 minute intervals so over cooking was not an issue. Since it is a no-mess approach to pork chops, tried again using Panko rather than the called for bread stuffing and got better results - will I try a 3rd. time? No way!

Delicious. I haven't been cooking a lot lately and my family enjoyed these immensely. My husband liked them so much that he said he didn't know who cooked because it couldn't have been his wife. Nice. Anyway, thanks for the recipe. It made a wonderful dinner with red-skinned baked potato sections and seasoned, cooked carrots.

Good recipe! I didn't have dry bread stuffing mix and used 1 cup of seasoned bread crumbs.  I did add some garlic, onion powder, and salt to the egg mixture.

UPDATE: Used 3/4 cup gluten free panko crumbs and seasoned them with garlic powder, onion powder, dried thyme, dried oregano, and dried parsley. Dipped in egg/milk wash, then breadcrumbs. I think my baking dish was too small and the boneless chops did not completely crisp up (crispy in parts but not all over). The cooking time for me took 30 minutes total @ 425, flipped once after 15 minutes.  I took the chops out as I didn't want them to overcook once they hit 170. Although not entirely crisp, the pork chops were still tasty.

Nothing special but not bad. Needs more seasoning and was a litle dry. Will probably try again, though.

The pork chops I used were thick and bone-in, so the cooking time ended up being closer to an hour. This was an easy, family-pleasing weeknight dinner. I'll be adding this to my favorites file. (Aside from the cooking time I made no other changes.)

This is fabulous.   The only reason I gave it four stars is becuase I didn't use bread stuffing mix (most people don't have this on hand).   I used bread crumbs with all kinds of italian spices added to it.   Yum

Instead of using butter I sprayed sheet pan with Pam and added seasonings such as paprika, garlic powder, adobo and parmesan cheese to the bread crumbs. It came out juicy and tender. Best recipe by far. Will make this again!!

Added 1/4 cup of parmesan cheese to italian bread crumbs. Dipped chops in flour, then egg and then bread crumb/parmesan mixture. Repeated egg and bread crumb parmesan mixture steps.  As per other reviewers omitted butter opting for butter flavored pam - sprayed pan and metal baking rack before placing chop.  Sprayed chops before baking and re-sprayed when turned. Very good and will make again.

I followed this recipe but seasoned my own bread crumbs and used a mixture of mustard and mayo instead of the eggs, which I was out of. The time of cooking was pretty much spot on and everything was fantastic! This is going into the regular rotation!

Pretty good, the family enjoyed it. I mixed italian bread crumbs and some shake n bake for pork and added some rosemary. Dredged in flour before the egg mixture as some others suggested.

I was astonished by how good this was. I have never in my life bought a stuffing mix (homemade always), and was almost embarrassed buying it in case I was seen. But this was incredibly good. I used the bowl-inside-bowl method to crush up the mix a bit finer, and used bone-free and almost-fat-free chops so I could eat every bit of the crispy outside. And as some other reviewer noted, I was careful not to follow timelines so that it didn't overcook just to crisp up the outside. Delish!
ADDED in July 2011: My husband isn't keen on this recipe for pork chops, but he loves it on chicken breasts or turkey cutlets. It's a Thanksgiving taste on an everyday evening.

Easy, yummy and fast way to serve up a yummy meal to your family.  I used bread crumbs that I seasoned myself to our liking (keeps the sodium down) and always add a little mustard to the eggs for a nice kick.

This was DELISH!  I used 2 eggs instead of 1 but kept the other ingredients the same for 4 chops but I actually used 8 thin chops.  I also added thyme to the egg mixture as well.  At the suggestion of other reviewers, I seasoned the chops prior to their egg dip with my usual spices (creole seasoning, onion powder, garlic salt, pepper, etc.)  When it came to the crumb mixture, I used a combination of Italian seasoned bread crumbs and Stove Top stuffing.  I found the stuffing had thicker, crunchier pieces but didn't cover the whole chop the way I wanted.  The bread crumbs fixed this problem completely.   I sprayed the glass baking dish and the top of the chops with Pam.  I cooked the first side for about 15 minutes and the second side (sprayed again with Pam)for about 10 minutes.  These chops were tender and looked fried! The Pam is what really gave them the golden appearance I wanted.  Thanks for a wonderful recipe!  KEEPER!

This recipe was very good. The pork chops were juicy and moist, better than frying them on the stovetop! It actually took less time for me to cook the pork chops because I could lay out 6 chops in the bakeware instead of having to fry 3 & 3.

Fabulous with a few tweaks.  I used Rice Chex to make this recipe Gluten Free.  Also added onion powder and season all to the dry mixture and double dipped the chops.  As others suggested, I sprayed them with Pam before putting in the oven and when I flipped them.  So juicy!  The timing was perfect!

These pork chops were delicious! Very juicy. I made a few changes, mainly because I didn't read the directions right: first, I did not bake the chops in melted butter. I melted the butter in a pan and sauteed the chops. Second, I did not have any bread crumbs, so I made some with crushed saltine crackers, chicken bouillon, granulated garlic and onion powder, to my taste. Turned out better than I ever would have expected.

Delicious. I only had bread crumbs and can't wait to use more flavorful bread stuffing mix next time.  The crumbs made the chops very tender in a short time. I loved this recipe and will use it from now on.  Thank you so much!

It was very easy and tasty. However, in the future I'd use 1 1/2 cups of stuffing because I crushed my down first.

This was very easy with great results...after reading other reviews I made the following changes...I lined a cookie sheet with tin foil and sprayed with Pam to eliminate the butter...I pulsed the stuffing mix in the food proccessor to make it more like bread crumbs and I coated the chops when they were not quite thawed out just a little frozen and the stuffing stuck to it great...I coated these in the morning kept them in the fridge, brought them to room temp. and popped them in the oven at dinner very good...thanks for posting

I thought these were great.  I added some italian seasoning...per the advice of other reviewers and did let it sit in the fridge for a bit for the coating to stay on better.  They turned out very good.  I will definately be making again.

I subbed yogurt for the milk (it's what I had on hand), and these turned out great!  It's a fast entree, but tastes like it really took some time.  Very juicy on the inside, crunchy coating on the outside.  Delicious!

These were delicious, simple to prepare on a busy school/work night, and my pickiest child ate them!! I did not have stuffing mix but used plain bread crumbs with onion powder, garlic powder, celery salt, and thyme. Thanks for sharing.

I think this was horrible.  The stuffing didn't stick to the pork chops.  It just burned on top and the pork chops were boring.

FANTASTIC!! Besides the grill I'm not a cook, but this was easy to make and my wife and son absolutely love them.  Once the utter shock from my wife that I COOKED wore off, these chops have been a weekly request. The only minor change I made was adding much more pepper. Highly recommend this meal.
(and trust me all you husbands/boyfriends out there...your woman will appreciate the gesture)

Followed directions exactly.  Breading stuck to glass casserole and chops were so tough you could not eat them.  I will go back to my usual method of pan frying.  Wasted 4 premium chops.

Made this lower fat (egg whites, skim milk and no butter) and with seasoned gluten free breadcrumbs.  The pork chops were thick so I cooked them  at 425 for 20 min and then lower to 350 for 10 min.

This recipe came out terrible for me.  The outside was goopy and the inside tough.  Not sure where I went wrong on this one.

After reading many reviews, I made this recipe as written using two center cut 1" pork chops from Publix. On another's advice I ground the stuffing mix in my mini food processor and the coating adhered well.  I baked at 425 for exactly 10 mins., turned and baked another 10 minutes to exactly 146 degrees.  The pork was dry and tough having to really saw it with a serrated knife.  The recommended 145 degrees made it overcooked and there was nothing crisp or juicy about this recipe even with a 1" chop.  It should bake for more like 7 and 7 then check it with an instant read thermometer at this high a heat.  The taste of the stuff mix was notable but I will not be making this again -- and I am glad that I did not make four!.

Alright, I have never rated a recipe on this site but felt that I had to rate this one!  I hate pork chops and my husband loves them.  He always cooks them to resemble shoe leather.  He is the amateur cook in the family now that he is retired.  I am always on the lookout for new recipes for him to make us.  Saw this and read lots of reviews (why people change the recipe and then say they hated it is beyond me!).  Showed the video to my husband and told him I would make it first to see if it is good.   When they first came out of the oven they didn't look too appetizing, they were a little anemic looking.  Right away I was prepared not to like them!  Just finished eating dinner...they were great! Really moist on the inside, some crunch on the outside with some spots where they were stuffing like.  The only thing I would do differently next time is to salt or brine the chops beforehand.  Pleasantly suprised!  Hubby loved them also!

I've always made Pork Chops in a Sautee pan on the stovetop, since I thought that baking them in the oven would make them tough and dry.  I tried this recipe, and they came out moist and delicious.  I used boneless chops which were about 1" thick, so I needed to adjust the cooking time. (They were ready at 165 deg. when I temped them.)  I used "Stove-Top Pork Stuffing Mix" to dredge the chops. They came out very delicious and moist!  I served them with some finely chopped Italian Parsley on top. I'll definitely make these chops again and again. My family and I loved them.

Outstanding. I brined the pork chops for a couple of hours in water with a splash of salt and sugar. Added about a tablespoon each of Montreal steak seasoning and lemon pepper to the bread crumbs. 

The taste with ease of preparation considered, this is one of the great all recipes.

Omgosh sooooooo yummy. My 2 year old who is notoriously picky scared it down, making annoying smacking sounds while she ate...she had 3 helping of this. My jaw dropped. I had 2. This recipe is very dangerous.  I did use Italian breadcrumbs instead,  and turned the broiler on the last 3 minutes to crisp it really well. Other than that, this recipe is perfection.

This was a great find! Super fast! My husband even said I don't need to fry them any more!! YAY!!! I love the taste of good ole fried pork chops but I just can't stand all the grease any more! I also substituted the stuffing mix for seasoned Italian bread crumbs. Worked wonderfully! This has definitely been added to my recipe box!

This was a tasty recipe, but mine took quite a bit longer to cook. I was hoping it was as fast as described as my family was hungry and getting a little antsy. It took about 20 minutes on each side it may have been due to the thickness of the pork chops, there were about 3/4 inch thick. I did turn every 10mins so that they did crisp. As other reviewers posted I did use Italian Panko bread crunch because my family like things crispy. Overall, very tasty and I would make again.

Very tasty, super easy.  You may want to season the chops first with salt and pepper, or increase the seasoning in the breadcrumbs.  A winner.

This recipe rescued me on an "I dont know what to cook" night and was delish to boot! I did dredge in flour before the egg wash and used italian panko b/c I didn't have stuffing. Also added a touch of parmesan cheese & garlic salt to the panko. I think the difference between this and other "oven fried" pork chop recipes is the butter. It browns and sizzles thin, boneless cuts and there is no sogginess. My kids liked it, too.  I will definitely make this again.

I used bread crumbs instead of stuffing and boneless chops. They turned out ok but took twice as long to cook. The breading was also pretty soggy and bland.

I didn't have stuffing mix on hand, so I crushed Texas Toast croutons instead - yummy! My husband of 20 years declared these the best pork chops he's ever tasted!  And perhaps the best compliment of all - all SEVEN of my kids loved them and ate them.  Any recipe that is a hit with even the pickiest of my brood has got to be good!

This is my first time EVER making pork chops! I followed the instructions but I was sure to flour them before, dip in the egg mixture, then cover them in the Italian Seasoned Bread Crumbs as suggested by the most helpful comment. After they were done, I covered them in Cream of Mushroom with Roasted Garlic soup! They turned out absolutely amazing and I will be making them a lot more often!

I usually never write reviews but I HAD to for this recipe! 5/5 and this recipe is going directly into my recipe file.

I smashed a bag of stove top stuffing mix for pork and followed all the directions.  It tasted like a pork chop with stuffing on the outside.  Not great, not bad. Needs more seaonings, if I make this again I'll add 2 gloves of garlic to the egg mixture or add some garlic salt.  But really I don't think I'll be making this again.

Good stuff!  We left out the butter (dieting) and baked the porkchops on a wire rack on a baking sheet (same amount of time, same temp).  The pork chops were juicy and tender, the crust crisp and flavorful.  I even had a leftover chicken breast that I gave the same treatment as the porkchops.  My husband RAVED about the chicken, and he's not really a chicken lover.  Great recipe/method.  Highly recommended!

This was the BOMB!  As a single mother of 2 young (picky) little girls I love it when I come across a cheap, simple, FAST recipe that is soooo good.  My girls absolutely love it so it is definitley a keeper!  One suggestion like the others said.  You have got to smash the stuffing mix into little pieces or it will not adhere to the meat.

The pork chop crust was soft not crunchy and not crispy. You will need to season the pork chops after dipping them in the egg mixture and before putting them in the bread crumbs. I ended up frying mine to make the crust crispy, which did not work. 4 stars it was edible.

I am from the south and as a kid my favorite meal was fried porkchops!  Im not much for serving fried foods to my family so was excited to try this recipie!  It was AMAZING!!!!!  The porkchops were the perfect combonation of crunchy on the outside but incredibly tender and juicy on the inside!  Even my 5 yr.old said "mommy when you feed me yummy stuff like this I will always eat dinner"!!  Served with mashed potatoes and glazed carrots, it was like being at home again!

Not a huge hit in my house.  Neither of my kids cared for it & my husband wasn't a huge fan.  I liked them but probably won't make again.

These were wonderful! Super easy to prepare as well. I added the step of dipping them in seasoned flour before the egg wash and then breading (and used 1/2 cup seasoned bread crumbs instead of stuffing mix). I had to cook mine an extra 10 minutes since they were still a little pink in the middle, but they did stay juicy and had a nice crunch on them!

These were yummy, and pretty simple.  My family loved them and they were very tender as well.   My grandfather LOVES pork chops and wants them all the time...so I am always looking for new ways to make them.  I recommend these!

I tried this recipe using the Italian Bread Crumbs.  There was a lack of spice in this.  My husband usually will eat the leftovers of anything I make.  He didn't like this at all.  I normally make shake-n-bake and that is what he asked for next time.  I agree that there wasn't much of a spice to this.

I enjoyed the recipe a lot! I used butterfly cut chops and subbed 1 tbsp of olive oil for the 2 tbsp of butter as well as used Italian bread crumbs versus the stuffing. Also, I made this in my Pampered Chef Grill Pan. 6 minutes on each side. Delicious and moist! Thank you for a really good pork chop recipe.

I ground my stuffing mix to make it stick better,  I also pounded my chops to tenderize.  Very easy and tasty recipe.  Took about 22 minutes to bake.
Made again using thin cut bone-in chops.  Dredged in 2 eggs seasoned with Trader Joe's Seasoning and Kosher salt, then dredged in seasoned breadcrumbs.  Baked for 10 minutes at 425, then flipped and baked another 5.  Delicious and easy.

this would've turn out good if the meat is juicy and crunchy on the outside. I don't know what I did wrong, but it came out reversed. The outer skin was moist and the inside meat was dry.. oh no. I gota try this again and make sure it comes out perfect

Eh... whatever.  I used the cubed Herb Seasoned Stuffing Mix from Pepperidge Farm.   I put it in the blender first.  I tried a little and it was very bland.  I knew it wouldn't flavor the pork chops, so I instinctively added a tablespoon each of seasoned salt and onion powder to the egg mixture.  I used vegetable oil instead of butter, heating it in the pan before adding the chops.  I cooked them for about 15 minutes on one side, and about 20 minutes on the other.  They never did get very crisp.  (I don't know, maybe the secret is in the butter as opposed to veg oil?)  In fact, I'd say the breading was a tad soggy.  The taste was edible.  It didn't blow my mind.  I won't be making this again.   I can imagine how bland it would've been without the added spices.

Tastes great.  I took tips from previous reviewers and didn't use butter, just sprayed olive oil on baking dish.  Also used Italian seasoned bread crumbs instead of stuffing mix.  Served w/rice & steamed broccoli.  Will definitely make it again.

I made these last night and they were super yummy! Next time I will omit the butter step since it made the breading soggy for me. The overall taste was delicious and the chops were juicy. Will make again. Thanks!

Delicious! I used a brush to add the flour before dipping into egg and bread crumbs.  I had bought butterfly pork chops, so I reduced the time to 8 minutes on each side. I will be making again!

I think would work better if pan was hot before you put chops in pan.  I ended up pulling them out and frying them.  I just heated my skillet and put chops and hot butter in skillet.  Next time I will heat up my cast iron skillet in oven with butter and then add my chops.

I followed the instructions and didn't make any changes.  They were very moist, and quite tasty.  My husband really liked them, and that is always a good thing!  Think I could play around with the recipe and change the flavour depending upon what I use to bread the chops and what seasoning I use.

I'm reviewing the method of cooking of this recipe because I used my own recipe for breadcrumbs instead of stuffing mix (which sounds good but I don't like to used pre-seasoned packaged foods).  The method of baking these in a buttered pan worked very, very well.  They didn't stick and the breadcrumbs stayed on the pork chops and browned nicely.  Typically I flour pork chops before breading them and also pan fry them to get them crisp before putting them in the oven but this recipe skips both those steps and the result is almost as good...good enough that I won't bother with those steps ever again.  I did slightly overcook mine as I increased the cook time because I had thick bone in pork chops, but that is my fault and even with the overcooking they were very good. For those curious, my breadcrumbs are a combo of gluten free panko style crumbs and ground up fortune cookies seasoned with rosemary, parsley, salt and pepper.

These were excellent.  Chops were cooked thru and thru and were fork tender.  This is the way I'll prepare them from now on.  Thanks for sharing.

Love this very simple recipe. I used 1 tbs of olive oil instead of 2 tbs butter and skipped the milk due to a dairy allergy, but overall this is a very tasty recipe

I made some of the modifications suggested by reviewers, leaving out the milk and doing a double coat of breading with flour (coat with flour, dip in egg then in bread crumbs, and repeat).  I also added garlic powder and salt to the egg mixture.  I really liked the way the breading turned out, though I found the pork chop itself was a little dry (though that may have been because my chops were sliced thin).  Next time I'll reduce the cooking time slightly and see if I like it better!

This has gone into my cooking rotation, especially since I go to school at night.  My family of 4 loves this recipe.  I use more pork chops though and the seasonings are still perfect for it.  Only thing I change is the amount of butter, way too much for me.  You could even use olive oil instead.  Great, easy, and yes, cheap!

These were sensational. I changed the ingredients by using turkey flavored stuffing mix. The mix consisted of poultry seasoning and that's what made it taste so great!

They were ok.  Kind of boring but my husband really enjoyed them.  He loves pork chops no matter how they are prepared.  If I make them again, I'll have to add more seasoning to them.

I tried this recipe last night and it did not turn out well.  The only change was that I seasoned my chops more, other than that followed the recipe to the T. The breading was soggy.  Yuck.  I couldn't bring myself to eat them.

I enjoyed this recipe a lot.  It was simple, quick and tasted great.  I thought the recipe called for too much bread crumbs as I had to throw a lot out.

I added some garlic powder to the egg mix and instead of seasoned bread stuffing, I used italian bread crumbs. I did find that I need to cook the chops longer than what the recipe called for but they turned out great.

These were ok, they were a bit too mushy and not crunchy as I had hoped.  They also needed a bit more flavor.  I may try it again using less butter and spraying the pork on each side as suggest by others.  For now I would say its a 3.5 stars.  It will do but not fantastic.

This is a super yummy and EASY way to make chops. I used to swear that I couldnt cook pork to save my life, but I followed the 10 min each side directions in the recipe and it was GREAT! All the ingredients I had on hand and it took just seconds to drop each chop in the egg ,then crumbs, and into the oven. In fact, usually I can get all the dishes in my dinner done at the same time, but these cooked SO fast that I had them ready before everything else! For sure using this recipe again!

Very tasty!  My son and husband both said it was a "make again!"  I used thin pork loin chops (boneless).  Before dipping in the milk/egg, I seasoned them with salt & pepper and then dipped them in the stuffing mix that I had crushed. Before I put them in the oven, I sprayed the tops with baking spray and then again after I flipped them. Because they were thinner, I baked them for 7 minutes each side.  Yum Yum!

These chops are so wonderful. Stuffing mix tends to fail to hold at times so I used a mixture of seasoned bread crumbs 2/3 cup mixed with 1/3 cup of crushed Rice Crispies. It gave the coating a much crispy texture and holds together alot better. Make sure you oil the pan when you flip it over so they dont stick. Will make these chops again. Thank you!!!!

After 10 minutes of cooking on each side the pork chops were still bright pink in the center.  Also the batter did not stick.  Won't make this one again.

Fast and easy recipe. I used cooking spray instead of the melted butter to cut back on the fat. Aside from that, haven't changed a thing. This is a keeper! Thanks!

This is a great pork chop recipe. I always get discouraged when I have to do breading in a recipe,even though the end result is always very good,its just messy and time consuming to me...however,this was not,and the end result was wonderful. Thanks to the other reviewers I had a heads up on the whole stuffing falling off the pork chops issue,so I just put the stuffing in a plastic bag,and crushed the bigger pieces down until they were like bread crumbs. You still get the great flavor of the stuffing,but its finer like bread crumbs. Make sure the butter is spread evenly in the pan before putting the chops in,so sticking doesn't occur. And DO NOT overbake. I used thin boneless chops and 20 minutes total definetly is a good number to go by for bake time. Even my extremely picky son went back for 2nds! Thanks for a great recipe!!!

This was an awesome recipe. I only had chicken stuffing mix. I put it in my processor to make it finer, where it would cover better. I had 6 chops. I used 3 tablespoons of melted butter, but also sprayed the pan with cooking spray,cooked it at 425 for 12 minutes each side. Before flipping, I sprayed the top of the chops with the cooking spray as well. I didn't have any sticking whatsoever,and all the crumbs stayed on and completly covered the chops. I didn't have any problems with the crumbs as some of the other reviewers. If you are going to make more than the suggested 4 chops, I would go ahead and process 2 boxes of stuffing mix,and use as you go, so they all get covered evenly, and you don't run out. You can store what you don't use in a container in your fridge. They were so juicy and tasty. One more thing..my mom hated to throw anything out, so she would take the breadcrumbs and the egg mixture after breading chicken, and mix it together, roll them into little balls and fry them in a little bit of oil on the stove. We called them poor man's meatballs. I have to do that everytime I bread something, my kids call them breadballs,and they love them.

I made the recipe exactly as is and although it had a good flavor I think it is supposed to say breadcrumbs, not stuffing mix, or maybe you are supposed to crush them. Just like others the stuffing would not stick and also got a little burned. I will give it one more try but with breadcrumbs instead.

The kids loved these! I think I'll use less butter next time, but other than that they were very good. I put mine under the broiler for a minute or two just to give them a little bit of crunch. Yum!!

OMG!  This recipe is great and very easy!  I preheated my oil (instead of butter) in my cast iron skillet in the oven then added the chops.  They were a bit thick so I cooked them 15 minutes per side. They were tender and moist inside with a nice crunch on the outside. I only used 1 tablespoon of oil and that worked just fine. My husband (who is also a very good cook) was impressed with this recipe, too. Will use this one again.  May use Panko crumbs and some Italian seasoning for variety.

This is a new family favorite.  I used corn bread stuffing that I crushed and used my Pampered Chef stone so I didn't need to turn the chops over after 10 minutes. I added some extra black pepper to the top of the chop before cooking.  I used boneless chops and they seem to be thicker, so I cooked them a little longer then 20 minutes...probably 25-30 minutes and they were perfect. Very moist. I will absolutely be making them again and soon.

Pretty good, and very easy. I am going on reports from my daughter, as I am vegetarian. The bottoms got a little soggy after I flipped the chops, but other than that, they worked well. I wonder if baking them on a rack, and just drizzling the butter over them would help them stay crisp on both sides.

This was a great quick recipe.  I changed a few things though, I used seasoned bread crumbs and crushed ritz crackers with added garlic powder and parsley.  I also eliminated the butter and used a butter flavored spray.  They came out juicy and my husband and son loved them.

I followed another reviewer's advice and used Yogurt mixed with the egg. I too used Italian seasoned bread crumbs mixed with a little grated Parmesan. My family loved these chops.

Quick and good!  After turning them over the first 10 minutes I noticed they weren't as crispy as I expected, so I increased the temperature to 450 and placed the dish on the lower rack.  When done, I lightly sprinkled parmesan cheese on them and served with green beans mixed with rice.  Yummy!  Will definitely serve again.

These turned out tender and juicy.  Crumbs were hard to keep "stuck" to pork chops, so I reapplied a little when I flipped them.

I've made this recipe twice and it came out great.  I also learned a few things:

1 for way better flavor 1 use italian bread crumbs 

2 I only use thin chops

3 season the egg mixture - I added a little salt, garlic powder, paprika and black pepper

3 after dredging chops in egg mixture, toss them in a ziploc bag with the bread crumbs

4 for a crispier chop, use the most shallow pan like a cookie sheet with curve up edges. I found with a 1.5 or 2 inch pan the chops never crisp

5 I used half butter half olive oil

6 I ended up having to let chops cook a couple minutes longer to crisp - depends on the oven.

I hope this is helpful.

Well, it could have been better.  The stuffing mix made the chops clumpy and not very good.

Terrible! I made this per the directions. The pork chops cooked but they never got crisp and brown. I had to take them out of the oven and brown in a pan. I will not try this recipe again.

I used thin center cut pork chops. After they were done (approx 8 min per side), I kept them on low heat covered with foil and they stayed very moist longer than most pork recipes.

I followed the recipe exactly and the pork chops were
absolutely delicious. They were tender and juicy with
just the right flavor and oh so easy to make.  I served
them with sweet potato and frozen petite peas, etc.
Will definitely make again.

Rated it a 3 because I didn't follow the recipe exactly.  1. Wet doesn't usually stick to wet nor dry to dry.  I first dredged to chops in seasoned flour (s&p, garlic powder, onion powder, smoked paprika), get the seasoning next to the meat.  Then to the egg wash. 2.  Dressing bread cubes are usually too thick and will burn, I used panko, crispier and lighter.  3.  Don't use a 9x13 cake pan.  It's too deep and will cause the meat and breading to steam rather than crisp making it soggy and tough.  With those changes, mine turned out pretty decent.

Simple and very tasty.  Really enjoyed these.  I think it would work equally well with stuffing or seasoned crumbs, but the stuffing has more interesting seasoning (sage?).  Even so I added celery salt and garlic powder

Made NO changes and PLEASE if a recipe calls for seasoned bread stuffing mix... DO NOT use seasoned bread crumbs...it's like replacing apples with oranges.  This will make a HUGE difference in the flavor and texture of the meat!!!!!!

These were really, really good! Very simple to prepare, too.  For those of you who love stuffing, coating your meat with it is a great idea! Crush up the stuffing a little bit first before pressing the meat into it -  this helps it stick better. I used 1 inch thick, bone in chops, seasoned with salt and black pepper before putting into the egg mixture and cooked 15 minutes per side. Will definitely make this again! And to all the reviewers who stated they used seasoned breadcrumbs instead of the stuffing – it’s just not the same!

My stuffing bread crumbs were too chunky so I crushed them up and added parmesan on top after I turned them in the over.  They were great and they do not get really brown.  Use a thermometer at 20 minutes if you are not used to cooking pork chops like this.   They were tender and juicy!  The looked really pretty too!
Note to those who used the bread crumbs vs stuffing - I have done t both ways and am shocked that I preferred the crushed stuffing.  So nice and crunchy!

Delicious! They came out juicy and the herb stuffing mix was nicely browned. Like others, I put some flour in a bag and gave the chops a toss to coat before the egg mix and breadcrumb steps. I also sprayed the tops with oil before they went in the oven. Next time I will experiment with adding some parmesan to the stuffing mix and perhaps some extra seasonings. I lined a baking sheet with foil for easy cleanup.

I used bone-in chops, Italian panko, dusted chops with flour before dredging and cooked on wire rack on top of cooking sheet at 400° for 20 min. Then ran under broiler to crisp up before serving. No turning so breading stayed intact. Pretty tasty.

Loved these, they turned out great, very moist and flavorful.  If I can make them any one can.  I used a box of stove-top stuffing poured into ziploc bag and crushed with rolling pin.  I cooked lower (350) and longer (maybe 55 minutes?? ) than recommended so they'd be done the same time as baked potatoes. I turned them over for the last 15 minutes so both sides had a little "crisp" to them.

i followed the recipe exactly and was not impressed....after 10 mins, the stuffing was already dark brown in color...i reduced temp to 400 for the last 10 mins and when i took out of oven, the stuffing mix was pretty burnt and the chops were chewy....won't make again.

This was excellent with Boneless Thick Cut Pork Chops! They are so juicy, tender and flavorful! I followed the recipe except substituted regular,bone-in chops for boneless that were on sale. I also added GOYA "adobo" seasoning to the crushed stuffing mix (I used Pepperidge Farm)and made sure they were well covered with crumbs and then followed the rest of the recipe with butter in the pan, etc. My chops were thick so I baked 15 mins, turned, sprayed the pan with nonstick spray and baked another 15 mins. They were sooo good - my husband & I are still raving about them - so tender - this is a definite keeper. I think the stuffing crumbs definitey are worth buying as they add extra crunch and the bits that fall off while your eating are delicious and full of flavor from the chops. When I turned them I also sprayed the tops of the chops. So I put away that remaining bag of stuffing for the next time I make these which will be soon!  Thanks for a great recipe!

Nice and simple recipe! Instead of the cup herb-seasoned dry bread stuffing mix, I've used breadcups mixed with lime juice and lemon zest...fabulous.

This is literally the best way to make pork chops. I've made these MANY times now, it's so easy, and the pork chops turn out very juicy, not dry. I have had to keep them in the oven for ten minutes longer than the recipe's suggestion, so just keep an eye out for that.

I usually do not like to rate recipes if I change them, but we really enjoyed these.  I added Worcestershire sauce to the egg mixture.  I also did not have stuffing mix and I worried about the salt content.   I used plain breadcrumbs and added a little salt and paprika to that.  Otherwise, I did follow the recipe and they came out well coated and beautiful.

Used Italian bread crumbs instead of stuffing mix. I doubt that it would make much difference in the finished chop. The chops were not crisp and the only way I know to crisp them is to overcook. This isn't the answer to frying healthy.

Would have give 4.5 stars but didn't want to cheat out the recipe. We love this. Very easy to make, I followed the recipe exactly. Changes I would make, put the stuffing in a food processor or in a resell able bag and break it up a bit. The stuffing was too big to stick to the pork chops. I ended up crumbling it with my hands to get it to stick. Also, after flipping I had to add some more butter to the pan so that the stuffing would absorb  it. The timing was perfect. It was very tasty, moist and crunch. It's going into my recipe rotation.

This recipe is awesome - delicious & easy!  I made it using Pepperidge Farm's Herb Stuffing Mix and it came out great (although I did need to cook it about 15 minutes per side).  My husband, a stuffing lover, went crazy over it and now I can't make pork chops any other way!  This is now a weekly dinner in our house!

Very good and easy.  I didn't use the egg and added Parmesan cheese just because.  Turned out well, and these bake up quickly.  They aren't my favorite pork chop recipe, but for a basic breaded pork chop they work well.  I served with baked broccoli.  Thanks for the recipe!

Wonderful!  I hate fried porkchops, but husband was craving them.  Preheated oiled sheet in oven; dredged chops in a mixture of Italian breadcrumbs & processed stuffing mix, then proceeded as directed.  Mine were super thick and cooked perfectly 12" one side, 13" next side.  Served with remainder of stuffing (which I added cranberries, celery and onion to), homemade applesauce, and sautéed fresh green beans.  Mine came out delightfully crispy on the outside, moist on the inside.  Even hubby (who was originally upset I refused to panfry) devoured.  Thanks so much for recipe!

I used Italian bread crumbs and added extra garlic, salt, and pepper. I also omitted the milk. I dipped the chops in flour first, then egg, then bread crumbs--the flour first makes the coating more even. Even my super-picky stepson loved them. Note that depending on the thickness of the chops, 10 minutes per side could be way too much. Mine were done after a total of 10 minutes.

I followed the recipe exactly.  But when I baked mine, they secreted so much juice that they came out soggy.  The flavor was good and they were tender but my kids hated the sogginess of the 'crust'.  Next time I will drain the pans halfway through so they crisp up.

Excellent recipe! My husband is not usually a fan of pork chops, but he loved these. I did note that a thinner pork chop was better. The first time I made these, I had very thick pork chops and they took forever to cook and it made the stuffing kind of mushy. However, with the thinner pork chops, the stuffing was crisp, but the meat was tender and juicy.

Thick pork chops take nearly an hour to cook, so time should be adjusted. Otherwise the taste was good, very tender.

This turned out great!! I used Panko Bread crumbs instead and put more than pepper as a seasoning in the egg/milk mixture. It was awesome!! I did not have the oven on 425, I cooked it lower and let it baked in awhile and they were still moist. I used Pa, instead of butter. Added a side of string beans, mac & cheese, rice-a-roni, and dinner rolls. My family loved it!!

Wow I love the flavor of these pork chops. The stuffing mix makes them taste just wonderful. I made the recipe as stated and they came out just right. Thank you RACHELHACKER for a totally different recipe to make.

My fave way to cook pork chops now!  Every week my boyfriend makes these.  They're his signature dish now :) Recipe works fine with bone-in or boneless, and you can use breadcrumbs if you don't have stuffing.  Bake them in a glass baking dish and the butter makes them slide right out- easy to clean.

Made this a bit differently. Used half bread crumbs and half flour. Seasoned and browned in pan (b/c I had time) then stuck in oven for a small bit. Made a gravy to make it "more southern". Great basic recipe. Will make again. Thanks for sharing!

I made these the other night using boneless chops (just because they were on sale). I'm definatly not a pork fan but my husband is so i made them for him. I followed the recipe, but used the flour,before the egg, and used 2 eggs just because i had 6 chops. I cut down on the cooking time as well to about 8 mins a side,(because i had no bone). Ny husband LOVED them, and ate leftovers cold in a sandwich the next day. I ate one for dinner, thought it was pretty good for pork :) i drizzled mine with a lemon wedge before i ate it.

This was really good! I like the crunch it had. I did not have stuffing, but I did have croutons! So I crushed them up in the bag they came in. Then dipped the chops in the egg mixture, put them in the crouton bag, shook, and put in the pan. SUPER EASY AND SUPER YUM!

Very easy and good. I made it exactly as the recipe says. I normally do the same thing when I make pork chops but use Italian flavored bread crumbs instead. They have a lot more flavor. I will make this again but I'll add more flavor to the stuffing mix.

Good recipe. I did use the stuffing mix. Next time I think I will crush the bread part of the stuffing mix so that it will be smaller and can grab onto the pork chop better. Instead of regular milk, I did substitute it for buttermilk and I also sprinkled parmesan cheese on top of the pork chops before putting them in the oven. Once I flipped them I added more parmesan cheese to the other side. i also cooked the chops a little longer due to me using a thicker cut. I would use this recipe again.

I tried these today and the chops were very tasty...but the stuffing stuck to the bottom of the pan.  I did put the better in.  I am going to try it again but this time put the chops on a rack and skip the butter.  I wasn't going to give a rating until then, but apparently I must in order to post this. I am wondering if anyone else had the same problem.

A very easy weekday meal.  I used Italian Panko crumbs and baked on a rack so they would be crispy on both sides.  Served with pilaf and steamed broccoli.  Wonderful meal.  Thanks for sharing,  RACHELHACKER.

I came across this recipe mid-afternoon on a Sunday.  I had already micro-sliced some cabbage, tossed it with salt and had it draining for the addition of the vinegar, sugar, pepper and cream.  Pork chops sounded like the perfect entree with the sweet creamy cabbage, so I sent my husband to the store for the chops while I mixed up the dip (out of milk, used cream), rolled the cornbread stuffing mix fine and added garlic, sage, thyme and pepper.  My husband came back with six 1-inch-thick chops, so I used them all.  The dip and the crumbs were more than enough--I sprinkled all the crumbs I had left over the chops before I put them in the hot oven.  I had to reduce the oven temp and bake them longer because of the thickness, but OH MY OH MY were these good!  I always use a meat thermometer to make sure I get things done right and these were no exception.  Thank you very much, RachelHacker!  Perfect Sunday dinner after a VERY hectic week and prior to another one!!!

Came out really good...I used bread crumbs and added salt, pepper, and chili powder.  I did cook it 20 minutes on one side and 20 minutes on the other side (the last five minutes I turned off the oven) uncovered.  Definitely will make again.

Made this tonight. Flattened down the chops, as they were thick. Only used two chops. Used only egg to dredge and panko with sage and course pepper. Added adobo to top of chops. These chops were moist! Cooked as directed. Boyfriend commented "these are good". Keeper recepie.

Following the baking directions, my center-cut pork chops turned out moist & tender. I did tweak a few things: used plain bread crumbs, 1/3 c Parmesan cheese, 1/2 T Nature's Seasons, & 1/2 pkg Hidden Valley Ranch dry mix in the coating. Also used 2 eggs, and added 2 T butter after turning chops. YUM!

I was looking for a way to make pork chops without the mess of frying them and found this recipe. They were very tender and moist although I did not use the stuffing mix for the breading. It just seemed odd to me so I used Panko Italian bread crumbs instead. I have to say this was a mistake, the breading fell off my chops and did not brown up evenly. Next time I will use the stuffing crumbs and see if that works better or maybe normal bread crumbs. Overall the chops are tasty and I will def. use this recipe again!

This was so tasty.  My husband does not usually like pork, but he absolutely loved this.  It helps to have pork chops that are not too thick.

I substituted Italian bread crumbs and minced two cloves of garlic in the egg mixture. These were the best pork chops I have ever had!

These were very good and very quick! My husband loved them. Next time I'm going to cook them either longer or at a higher heat, though. They weren't crunchy and that's what I like. Still, an over-all good recipe and I will make it again.

Made this recipe last night. I needed a pork chop recipe with a short cooking time and found this one. The pork chops turned out flavorful and juicy. I varied the recipe slightly. I omitted the butter and used butter spray to grease the pan, I added salt, Mrs. Dash and a good amount of Italian seasoning to the Progresso Parmesan  flavored bread crumbs I used. Thanks for the recipe it was a healthy alternative to breading and frying.

My porkchops looked picture perfect.  I used plain breadcrumbs and mixed in applewood seasoning.  The aroma was great.  I needed a lil something extra.  I'll try italian breadcrumbs next time.  Thanks for sharing the recipes!

Wow, these came out fantastic!  I was a little apprehensive, since it seemed too simple.  I didn't add butter and they were still great.

I used Stovers stuffing, and the chunks were a little too big; I would recommended crushing them up into almost a powder.

Really good and easy. I used herbed Panko crumbs. If you use stuffing mix, you probably will want to crush. Do this by putting in a ziplok bag and roll over with a rolling pin.

Will definately make again.

Very tender.  I used the seasoned bread crumbs but needed more spices. Omited the butter and placed them on a rack to lower the fat. Will make again.

It was really good.  Next time I'll crush up the stuffing mix a bit first though.  It was so chunky it had a hard time coating the chops and fell off, leaving the chop a bit bland.  Overall, very yummy and VERY easy!

I followed the recipe and the breading was very tasty, but the butter in the bottom of the pan made it soggy.  I tried broiling at the end to crisp it, but wasn't very successful.  I will try it again, but not put the butter on the bottom.

Great recipe! I used water instead of milk and it worked great.  It is also good to put stuffing mix in plastic bag and crush for smaller bits or run in food processor.

I agree with Crystal and should have used seasoned bread crumbs. I used packaged stuffing mix and it turned out dry and crispy, made exactly as recipe states. I don't think you need butter, milk or egg, just dip in bread crumbs and bake at 350 for 25 mins. Just as good

I love this recipe. It's easy, simple, and most of all tasty. I make my own bread crumbs mix because I usually don't have the stuffing mix and it still turns out good. I would give it 5 stars if it didn't stick at times to the bottom, but overall great and easy recipe!

Wonderful recipe! My 10 yr. old son has Autism an one of his "things" is food- he has only certain foods that he will eat and rarely tries anything else and likes it. I made these tonight for dinner as a substitute to one of his staples and he loved them (with ketchup of course!!). I will definitely make these more than once-if it's up to my son they will be made ALOT!!!

I used boneless chops.  They were a bit dry. The breading was delish - I will make again but will use bone-in next time.

I was amazed that something so simple could taste so good. This was fantastic! I usually try to make a recipe as written the first time I make it but I was running low on breadcrumbs so I ended up using half breadcrumbs and half crushed Ritz crackers. I also did as some previous reviewers suggested and coated with flour before dipping in the egg. I seasoned the flour with McCormick Perfect Pinch for chicken. Great flavor! Will definately be making on a regular basis.

Sadly, this recipe didn't work well for me at all.  They came out soggy instead of crisp.  Next time I will try stove-top frying to get them crisp, followed by some oven time to finish the cooking process.  ...I should add that I used bread crumbs (Italian style) instead of stuffing mix--but I wouldn't have thought that would be a big difference.

This was very good and easy to make.  I will make this again, but next time I think I'll try putting the chops into a very hot fry pan after I take them out of the over to crisp up the breading.

i don't understand what went wrong but my breading didn't crisp and  the pork chops took twice as long to cook as stated in the direction. I will keep but work it out to suit my family.

MMMMM.... very good!!!  I'm not an Iron Chef if you know what I mean, but I had NO TROUBLE following this recipe and/or changing a few things... I added garlic powder and Italian Seasoning to the bread crums AND I put some motzerella cheeses on top right before pulling them out of the oven.  It turned out amazing!  Love it!

These were really good!  I used the stuffing mix like suggested in the recipe, and thought it was delicious!  I dipped the chops in flour before dipping in the wet mix (per another suggestion) and then coated the chops.  I didn't pour the butter in the bottom of the pan, rather put it over the chops so the stuffing wouldn't get soggy.  I also then sprayed the chops each time I flipped them with buttered cooking spray- they turned out very crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside.  I cooked them a little longer than the 20 minutes as well, and if they are thick chops it will definitely be longer cook time.  All in all- my husband and 8 year old loved them- will definitely make again- VERY easy :)  We paired it with the company cauliflower recipe- mmmmmmmm!

I have to say I don't care too much for pork chops but my family does.I have tried shake-n-bake and didn't like it,so I was a little unsure about this one.But it turned out great I really like this one not to mention my family.My daughter is like me,doesn't care for pork,and she wasn't going to try it.But after I told her it was really good and really juicy she ate a whole chop!The only thing I did differently was the butter,I used cooking spray instead.Turned out great,I will deffinately make it again and again.Thanks for the recipe!

I havent eaten pork chops in about 15 years and decided to try them now that im older to see if i like them.  I found this recipe and decided it was woth a shot.  It was absolutely delicious.  The only change I made was instead of cooking the pork chops in the butter i just put them on a rack.  Thats how I do my chicken so its less calories and it comes out crispier.

Considering how easy this dish is to prepare, I'm rating 5 stars.  Perfect weeknight meal.  I used plain bread crumbs with added seasonings.  I had thick chops, so I halved them lenghwise to make thin chops which were perfectly done in 20 minutes.  Also broiled for 2 minutes at the end to give a little extra crisp. My kids preferred these to fried!!

One of the better fried pork chop recipe.  I dip the chops in bread crumb mixture first before dipping it in egg then dip it back to bread crumb mixture again. Also, I spritz olive oil instead of Pam or butter.  Perfect crispiness and still juicy inside.  My husband loves it

These were really good, I used stove top stuffing for pork, and crushed it up a little in the food processor.  The pork chops were very tender and juicy, and it was quick and easy....4.5 stars!

Great recipe.  Didn't want to open a whole bag of stuffing mix, so I crushed croutons and used them to bread the chops.  Wonderful.  Moist.  A keeper.

I absolutely love this recipe!  I change a couple of things though...I used rice chex cereal, and sprinkled garlic salt with parsley on top (just before I put it in the oven).  Yummy, juicy, and crispy all in one...YOU'VE GOT TO TRY THIS ONE!

i followed the recipe and they turned out as great as a pork chop can be- my husband really liked them. i liked using the stuffing to coat and i would suggest everyone do so it works better than the dry bread crumbs in the can.

Absolutely awesome!  My whole family (a toddler, 2 school agers, and hubby) loved these pork chops!  We eat pork chops every week - this is the first time they were moist and tender!!!  Used old french bread which I blended for the crumbs.  After dipping in egg mixture and bread crumbs I sprinkled herbes de Provence ontop.  Love that precise 10 min on each side - makes it so easy!! THEY ARE MAGNIFICENT!!  Thanks a ton!

Excellent. I made it for Sunday dinner and everyone thought they were really good. Crispy on the outside and moist and tender inside. I dipped them in flour first as others suggested and then the egg mixture then the crumbs that I had rolled in a baggie until the bread cubes were crumbs. I only used about 1/4 cup butter melted and I did spray the the chops on top with canola spray. I baked them at 400 degrees. I will definitely be making these again. Someone said they tasted like Shake and Bake. Sorry I totally disagree. Much, Much better than a commercially made product.

I used a whole bag of stove top stuffing, mixed in some pepper and garlic powder, and pressed it into the pork chops well (after dipping in egg and milk.)  I poured most of the extra onto the chops before cooking.  Also, I made six chops!  My pork chops were really thick, so I had to cook them about 45 min.  Like someone else suggested, I sprayed the chops with Pam and sprayed them again when I flipped them. My husband raved and my son, who has never eaten a pork chop in his life (he's 15) even ate one, and ate the extra stuffing in the pan.

I made these a few nights ago and it was AWESOME. Awesome because it is so simple and DELICIOUS! I will admit that I was in NO mood to step out in the summer heat to buy some bread stuffing mix... I looked in my pantry and noticed A 10 oz. box of Garlic- Onion Croutons. I crushed them with a rollling pin and used that for the bread stuffing mix. I also dipped the chops in flour before the egg wash and breading. These are SUPERB, no-nonsense pork chops! P.S. Hubby claimed to dislike pork chops but after trying this version, he had a second helping...so did I! These are so crunchy and juicy. I'm glad I decided not to grill them.

Pretty Good/OK.  Nothing fancy.  Just OK.  Was a good way to use leftover bread crumbs.  Had a strange chewy texture.  I used boneless 1 inch pork chops.

Very, very good recipe!! I took the other reviews advise and dredged them in flour before the egg and used whole wheat ceasar croutons mixed with some plain bread crumbs in place of the stuffing mix. Totally yummy!!

When I picked up the stuffing mix, there were off-brand mixes in bags, and they had a small-crumb and a large-crumb variety - i just used the small crumb, and it was fine.

However, my kids did NOT like the flavor at all.  They prefer my usual grilled pork chops.

Very good.  I used thicker chops, so I increased the cooking time by 10 minutes.  Great flavor.

Three & A Half Stars... I'm gonna have to agree with the one reviewer who said this was similar to Shake N Bake.  I did use plain bread crumbs, due to lack of stuffing mix, seasoned with gobs of spices.  Dipped 'em in flour before the egg wash, and then used a bit less butter than recommended.  They did turn out nice 'n' moist, but I just didn't think they were all that great.  Husband liked them though, and commented about how I didn't "Dry them out, as usual."

I loved these & was so happy to find a new way to make a pork chop!  Now I did read the recipe wrong & didn't have the stuffing mix, I thought it wanted seasoned bread crumbs!  They were really good & I can't wait to try the stuffing mix next time!  Thanks for this really good & really easy way to fix pork chops!  EDIT - I have since made with stuffing a few times & we LOVE it!  Love the extra crunchies that fall off too...Thanks for posting!  This is a keeper for sure & our new favorite way to eat pork chops!

Very good & easy to make.  The chops turned out very tender & juicy.  I definately would use this recipe again,  The only thing I would do differently is season with garlic powder.

This was awesome, so easy and tasty, I did have to cook the chops slightly longer than called for, and by chops were pretty thin and boneless, (could be my cruddy oven)  I can't belive how fast this was, my boyfriend loved it, I will be making regularly, thanks!!

These were good, but I too had trouble with the stuffing mix sticking to the chops. I will try the suggestions of the other users (using fine bread crumbs or putting the stuffing mix in the food processor). Otherwise, it was tasty and easy!

Great recipe!  I got a box of the stuffing mix and ended up using about the whole thing since I had 6 pork chops instead of 4.  The chops were tender and SO juicy, the outside was crunchy and flavorful.  It was a big hit with my husband and I will definitely make it again.  This was also good for my lactose-intolerant in-laws!

Great!  I used italian bread crumbs only b/c I thought I had stuffing then realized I did not.  The only thing I added was garlic powder to the egg & bread crumb mixture.  It was wonderful and I will make it again for sure.

Pretty easy, but I ddn't care for them....could be the stuffing mix I used.  I used boneless chops (had to add about 10 minutes cooking time), and used Stove Top for pork.  Seemed really bland to me.  Might be better with thinner chops.

My family really loved this recipe, and so did I.  The only thing I did different is I used butter flavored Pam instead of butter and cooked the pork chops for 20 minutes on each side, since they were really thick.  I also added a garlic and herb seasoning to the bread crumbs and some parmesan cheese.  They came out brown and crispy on the outside and moist and juicy on the inside, thanks:)

I make two modifications with this recipe. I use seasoned croutons and grind them fine in the food processor. I also use thin pork chops. The breading gets crispier this way. My family loves these. This recipe is a winner. My husband who cannot cook can make these.

These were great & easy to make. The chops stayed nice & tender. I served it up with biscuts & gravy (per my fiance's request). One for the recipe file.

I followed the suggestion of another review and used no fat yogart instead of egg mixture.  I thought it was good for a fairly quick meal.  I'll use it again.

This is a quick and easy way to make porkchops. The stuffing crumbs really give the chops a nice flavor. I will make these again, but I will turn the oven up a little higher toward the very end to get the crumbs to brown a little more and get a little crunchier. I really liked this recipe. Thanks

At last!! A baked pork chop recipe my husband loves! I took some reviewer's advice and used seasoned bread crumbs. I also found I needed to cook the chops longer than the recipe called for. This is a great tasting recipe that I will be making instead of pan fried chops! Thanks Rachel!

I like the recipe generally; however, I would make one small change. I would suggest replacing the stuffing mix with seasoned bread crumbs. Other wise it was easy, quick and juicy.

Easiest way to make pork chops...EVER! I used to cook mine in the skillet and they ended up being tough as leather. Made one change to the recipe - I used 1/2 Panko bread crumbs and half regular breadcrumbs. They come out tender and juicy!

This is not a recipe I would make again. The cooking times were way off. Even though my pork chops were super thin (between 1/4" and 1/2" thin), it took more than 10 minutes per side; every time I took it out, it was still pink. I think I ended up cooking it more like 20-25 minutes per side because I kept having to put it back in the oven. When it was all said and done, I couldn't even eat it, as it tasted awful.

I’ve made this recipe at least  half a dozen times; and it’s great; so easy to make, and hubby loves it, but it’s never crispy.
 How can I get it crispy?
I use herb-seasoned bread crumbs, instead of the 
   herb-seasoned dry bread bread stuffing mix.  
I’m not sure of what or where this mix would be. 
 All I can find are bread crumbs.

The best pork chops I have ever had.  Easy to prepare  for a big dinner with family & friends.  I always use very thick chops, so I bake them a couple minutes more on each side to get the desired temperature for pork.

This recipe is great! The only thing Extra that I did was marinate my chops for 24 hours in zesty Italian salad dressing with some garlic powder. Then when I dipped them in the egg wash I left the salad dressing coating on them. It really adds flavor. Also used seasoned Italian breadcrumbs. Delicious!

I made this for dinner last night and it was really good. I love that it is fast and easy. I didn't use butter or the stuffing mix but I did use bread crumbs and, I also used a rack . It works very well my pork chops was nice a crispy, even for lunch the next day. I did use my own season but thats how you make a good recipe into a even better one. In my opinion.

My son loves these.  I hate how soggy the coating gets, so i plan to use a rack  like another reviewer suggested.  Sometimes i skip the egg mixture and just use mayonaise as the coating before the bread crumbs or stuffing mix.  Either way its delicious.

Great recipe.  I give it a few more minutes per side, but overall, excellent recipe.  One of my go to's in a pinch.  For a nice change, add a package of onion soup mix and some grated cheese to the coating.

Made this tonight and followed some of the other reviewers by coating the pork chops in flour first. I also added some garlic and onion powder. They were super simple and would make again, however I think I would take the advice of others on here who recommended Italian style breadcrumbs. Didn't love the stuffing mix. Also used thin sliced pork chops- definitely did not need 10 minutes per side. Did not turn out super dry, but not as tender as I had hoped. Would try again with the changes!

So easy and delicious! I used thick cut pork chops and cooked them 20 minutes on each side. My family, even my picky eater, loved them! I will make them again!

I doubled the eggs and milk, to make sure I had enough to dip pork chops in. Pork chops took a little longer than 10 minutes on each side. When flipping over I used olive oil spray so coating wouldn't stick to pan. Coating could have been a little crisper. I would use less butter to coat pan or olive oil spray so coating will be crisper.

Excellent pork chops!! Great taste, tender and juicy inside  and crunchy on the outside. My mom has a gluten sensitivity so I used gluten-free stuffing mix.

My husband said “3 stars—y’know, average,” and since I didn’t eat them, I’m going with that.  I will say that the coating came off onto the bottom of the pan, which was disappointing, and the coating was not crunchy.  I’ll keep looking for a good pork chop recipe.

My family really enjoyed these. The herb stuffing mix was a nice alternative to bread crumbs and added good flavor. The higher temperature, shorter cooking time helped preserve the juiciness as well.

Super yummy! I didn’t use milk & used Italian bread crumbs. Absolutely AMAZING. I broiled 5 minutes at the end.

Good and so easy to make. I rubbed seasoned salt and pepper on the pork chops before placing in the egg wash. Used Italian bread crumbs because I didn’t have any stuffing. Took exactly 20 minutes in a jelly roll pan and the chops were nice and crispy! Will make this again.

I was pleasantly surprised by this recipe.  Definitely worth a shot.  I followed some of the review suggestions.  My chops were quite thick, so I left them in an extra 5 minutes (biting my nails) and they came out super moist and delicious.  The breading isn't as crisp as I would like (because I have no spray oil maybe?) .  But I will be trying this again and perhaps i'll give it a quick fry before baking for that extra crispiness.

Easiest way I've ever made chops and delicious also!  Had to flip the chops a second time to bake 5 more minutes, but otherwise I followed the recipe.  Mmm good!  Anybody can make this recipe.

4 stars for the simplicity of it - nothing fancy but works for a quick meal.  Season the chops with your favorite seasoning (Lawry's Seasoning Salt works) PRIOR to doing the egg bath and breading and that takes care of giving this dish some flavor.

Instead of butter I used olive oil and it worked just as fine. The pork needed about 12minutes on each side and it came so good.

I followed the recipe exactly and they were very good.  The only problem I had was that the stuffing mix had a lot of large pieces in it.  This made it difficult to stick to the egg mixture on the chops.   Next time I will  crush the stuffing mix before using.

These chops were simple to make, but were crispy on the outside and moist on the inside.  The only change I made was to add a little seasoned salt before dipping in the egg.  I also used italian bread crumbs because that's what I had on hand. 
 They were excellent, and my husband loved them.

I used Italian bread crumbs. I sprayed a foil covered baking sheet with cooking spray and sprayed the top of the chops too. So I skipped the butter. I have a convection oven so I reduced the heat 25 degrees and reduced the cook time. These were amazing. I’ve made these twice. So delicious! And not dry at all.

We thought the pork chops were delicious.  This is one that I'll make again and again. I recommend thinner chops.  I used thick chips and they took 50 minutes to cook. This made them a little dry. The taste is wonderful and the crust crunchy .I recommend that you use a rolling pin or food processor to get crumbs. I used my hands to break down the stuffing mix, and this way left a lot of big pieces.

Wished could give this 10 stars.  Awesome recipe & tastes like a gourmet meal. Followed the recipe exactly with only 2 minor additions, added garlic powder & season salt to the boxed pork stuffing mix.  Served it with baked potatoes, peas & side of salad.  Rachel THANK YOU for sharing it with us all.  Also was wondering how would this work with boneless chicken breast?

Only modifications I did were adding  maybe 1/3 -1/2 cup  of Planko  bread crumbs. I had unseasoned stuffing mix (only thing store had) so I added a couple of table spoons of Italian seasoning.  Other than that followed it 100% came out great. No leftovers great.

I added about a half cup of grated Parmesan  to the crumb mix and a half teaspoon salt to the egg mix but no pepper. My 3 chops were huge so I did each side in the oven for 20 min...they were perfectly golden, tender, and juicy!!

Great recipe.  Nice and crunchy.  Bread crumbs will work if you don’t have the herb stuffing but best if you use lanky breadcrumbs.  Even better with the herb stuffing as the recipe is written.  If you add Parmesan cheese, it gives the chops even more flavor.

Delicious pork chops, only thing I did differently was I added some garlic powder and  I also added some  crushed  ritz cracker to my stuffing dry mix, they were so moist and juicy, even my son... who claims he does not like pork  chops eat them and  my picky husband also love them, this is a keeper

Wow. Literally the best pork chops I've ever had and they were so easy to make. 

I didn't have any bread crumbs so I put some seasoned crackers in a little blender and used that which worked perfectly. Will definitely make again. Very happy I found this recipe.

I have always wrecked pork chops, until now! I’m so glad I found this. Delicious, juicy and full of flavor. I used plain bread crumbs but added chop seasoning. Other than bread crumbs I made as directed. It’s my favorite now! Thanks

I'm going to definitely find another way to cook it next time, the smell is awesome (a bit pizza-y for some reason) and it looks fantastic. Haven't tasted it yet but I'm sure it will be awesome. Unfortunately that wasn't enough butter or something though because it stick to the pan so much once you turn it over that all the bread crumbs and skin pretty much peels away and sticks to the pan. Otherwise, great recipe

I followed the recipe except for the size and time. I like thicker chops so I did a two inch cut and added an extra 10 minutes. It was moist and tender. More flavourful than i thought. a quick and delectable dinner.

Very good. I lowered the temp to 400 as the stuffing crumbs were getting too brown. Will make it again. Kept the pork juicy!

I made these using the same ingredients (except the stuffing mix. I used plain old bread crumbs in a can)  but I individually wrapped each pork chop in its own little piece of butter foil. Poked 4 tiny holes in the top of the foil. Baked them for 25 minutes (without having to flip them) and they came out crispy & oh so juicy!!!

For extra crunchiness, I coated the pork chops in a second layer of bread crumbs.

It was very good. My only suggestions would be to add salt and after making sure it is cooked through, broil it to desired golden color if the baking is not enough to brown the pieces. Will make it again! You might only need to use half or 1/3 cup of the bread crumbs.

It was pretty good. I chose this last minute when pork chops were on sale at Ralph's. I used margarine and since my microwave was outta commission I just slathered it all over the foil instead. Added paprika, garlic powder, and chili powder in addition to the pepper to give it a little more flavor. It was good but I think I will make some honey garlic (1/2 cup honey, 2 tablespoons soy sauce, 2 tablespoons apple cider vinegar, 1 tablespoon garlic, {1 tablespoon cornstarch and water to thicken}) sauce to give it more flavor.

This was good, and easy to make. After coating the chops, I poured the remainder of the stuffing mix in the  baking pan and poured a little chicken broth on top. I had some leftover diced onion and red & orange bell peppers, so I tossed that on top of the stuffing. That really added a wonderful flavor to the stuffing. The pork chops were a little tough, so next time I'll marinate them first. Overall, we liked the dish, although the meat wasn't as tender or flavorful as we would have liked. A marinade should fix that I think.  Our one year old liked it, so that was a plus! Served with roasted broccoli.

I rate five starts for moist and tender. I did add some salt and garlic powder to the bread crumbs just because I always salt and pepper my meats, and of course, I love garlic.  I noticed that this recipe only called for pepper.  My change however, does not affect why the chops were so tender.  My family really liked these and I will probably make them like this from now on.
I think I left them in for about an extra 10 minutes, but I turned them at the 15 minute mark. They were perfect!!  Thank you.

Made as written.  It tasted marvelous.  However, it will NOT be on the regular meal rotation.  I will save this recipe for special occasions.  My husband likened it to being "as filling as Thanksgiving dinner".  Just delicious, though.

These were very good.  I followed naples34102 suggestion and used the recipe for Homemade Shake and Bake Mixture also on this site.  I didn't have stuffing mix, so I used bread crumbs.  A great weeknight dinner.

I have been using this recipe for a few years. It is lovely and also easy. Pork chops can be a bit tricky and can be tough if not handled correctly. This is the best easy recipe I have for pork chops.

I made this, only changes i made was that i added italian seasoned panko crumbs, i had to put the oven on broil in order to get some crunchiness after the pork was fully cooked (about 25-30mins) overall it did taste great i added a side of worcershire sauce to dip in!

Eh, it was ok. Instructions say to flip it at 10 minutes and the breading stuck to the pan when I did so. Probably requires a fair amount more butter. It was obvious the breading would be mediocre so I doctored it up with some spices.

Mixed reviews on this recipe, but half my family doesn't like pork chops, and they said it was good.  I used this on thin cut chops, and they turned out perfect.

Perfect. I was a little hesitant about the 425° but everything turned out excellent! I used the pan but covered with aluminum foil. Chops were crispy on the outside and SUPER juicy on the inside. I was pleasantly surprised!

This was super delicious! I did dip them in flour before the egg wash and I substituted the stuffing for Italian seasoned bread crumbs. My husband and daughter ate this all up! Gone within minutes.

Very good, simple recipe - was great for a weeknight without much fuss to prepare!  I used pretty big pork chops, and it was perfect (probably an inch thick...). If you use thinner, though, you should adjust the time.

Only had half cup of Italian breadcrumbs, so I mixed a couple handfuls of Caesar croutons that I put in the food processor. These were the best oven baked chops I've ever made!

This is absolutely delicious! I'm mad that I've ever made it any other way! I didn't change a thing. I seasoned the pork chops before dipping in the egg mixture. Oh and I used almond milk. I love it! I will make it again very soon!

Great. I added some seasoning to my plain bread crumbs (seasoned salt, garlic powder, onion powder, cayenne), and cooked my 1"-thick pork chop for 15 minutes on each side at 425. Simple basic recipe that you can add to (or not) as you feel like it! Will be referring to this again.

Perfect easy recipe. I seasoned my plain breadcrumbs with Italian seasoning and extra dried parsley & garlic salt. Our chops were 1 inch thick. 10 min on each side was plenty, I will try 8 min each side next time. Served with salad, great meal!

First time I made it with the stuffing mix, I wan't a big fan. Too many seasonings I couldn't control. Thought it was too much like Shake n Bake. I made it again, however, this time with Panko that I seasoned with a pinch of salt and a good bit of paprika. I like the added flavor of the paprika, plus the punch of color. I had 1.5" bone in chops, and knew I would have to cook a little longer. Cooked on my convection setting, then, decided to go rogue, and when they were nearly done, I  turned them again and topped them some of my homemade cream 'o onion soup. Mushroom would be good too.  Cooked a little while longer. I did use my meat thermometer. Delish. Only reason 4 stars is because I didn't particularly enjoy the stuffing mix in orig recipe, but I knew I could build from it.

Used Italian panko breadcrumbs because that's what I had on hand. It was okay, thought it was a little bland so will add some more spices next time or try the stuffing mix.  But was quick and easy so will try again.

Agree these are delicious, it's times like these I wish they had 4.5 stars. I have made this a couple of times and it is going into my rotation. The last time (due to not having ingredients and hurrying too much I made a couple of alterations that I will keep. I mixed two tablespoons of melted butter in with the egg dip (which gave the chops a little richer flavor. I didn't have stuffing mix so I just rolled them in Italian Bread Crumbs.  They turned out perfect. Either way a very good recipe, recommended.  Thanks for posting.

These look great. They are simple to make.  They are also very bland and extremely messy to eat.  The suggested time needs to be very carefully watched.  I over baked mine a bit so they were chewy as well as bland. Yuck. My family usually loves chops, but not these.

This was deeeeeelish!  I seasoned the pork chops with Larry's seasoning salt and black pepper on both sides and used Italian bread crumbs instead. The chops were flavorful, tender and juicy.  But best of all it's quick to make. I'm definitely adding this to my cooking repertoire!

I used Italian seasoned bread crumbs. I wish I could have given this 10 stars. It is very easy to make and tastes delicious. So much better than pan fried. The only thing missing this time is the applesauce .

My wife and I really enjoyed these pork chops. I crushed the stuffing to get a better coating, then patted the chops with a paper towel and just used egg, no milk, to bread them. I had thinner chops so I reduced the cooking time also. They came out great. My wife was bored with pork chops and she loved these. I'd definitely make them again.

It was fairly easy to prepare and quick but was ok in flavor.  Next time I will add some more flavor to accent the pork more.  Thank you for sharing!

Very happy with results . I used panko bread crumbs instead of stuffing. Came out very moist & crisp.

A nice hands off way to make pork chops!  No babysitting a fry pan and the chops are crunchy on the outside and tender and juicy on the inside.

These pork chops were delicious.  I used Italian flavored bread crumbs and cooked the chops 15 minutes per side to get the desired browning.

This recipe was so easy and delicious! Will make again often. In the past, my attempts to make pork chops have been disappointing at best, usually because the meat becomes so dry during cooking. Not this one! I put a piece of foil (not sealed) over the dish for most of the 20 minutes and removed it a few minutes before the end so the breadcrumbs could get toasty. Delicious!

Used the last of some 'Everything' French bread and plain bagel that I put in the toaster oven on 200 degrees and dried out. Added garlic/ pepper seasoning to the crumbs. Otherwise, followed this EASY RECIPE! Side items were green beans and tater tots. A Keeper!

I usually cook pork chops on my George Forman grill ( not working now) so I decided to bake them. This is my first time and they turned out great!  Only changes I made was increased cooking time by 8 minutes and used Italian bread crumbs with house seasoning. Yummy!!!

These were quite tasty - and quick & easy!  All I did differently was put a little S & P and granulated garlic on both sides of the chops before putting into the egg wash.  The family enjoyed them!  Thanks for sharing;)

A fantastic base recipe! I don't mind the mild flavor myself, but adding a little extra seasoning to the breadcrumb mixture is quite nice, or using Italian seasoned breadcrumbs instead of plain. And the quick spray of oil on the pan and the tops of the chops when you flip them is a super cool trick. Keeps'm crispy!

This was SOOOO simple I don't know why I've been frying all these years.   Yes, I added my own seasonings to the bread crumbs but the bottom line is there's almost none of the mess you have from frying and it was still very tasty.   I'm a convert!

I followed the recipe to the T.  The butter soaks up the bread crumbs which makes it soggy.  Not very flavourful.  I gave  it 2 stars bc my man wanted 3 stars and I only wanted to give it 1-so the average.    Waaaay to much bread crumbs and milk egg mixture.

THESE ARE WONDERFUL!!! Made these exactly like the recipe with one exception,  could not find any herb stuffing in any store,  so I got stove top savory herb and put it in the food processor.  They came out very juicy and not dry at all,  my kids loved them,  even the picky one.

This was really good! I read some of the negative reviews and I think it has a lot to do with cooking variations. I had 1 inch thick bone in chops and I cooked them 15 mins each side. A thicker one needed a few minutes more. They were mostly crunchy but had some soggy parts. I used stove top stuffing. I usually dip my chops in apple sauce as I'm eating them but no need to do that with this recipe.

My pork chops turned out good!  My husband liked them also.  Instead of using stuffing, I used whole wheat flour and bran flakes crunched into little pieces.  I baked them for 15 minutes on each side for a total of 30 minutes instead of 20 minutes also.  Everything else I did the same, & they were delicious!

Great taste! To make it complete, I coated cubed potato dipped in seasoned bread crumbs. I placed it in the casserole first for about 20 minutes. Then I added cubed carrots dipped in olive oil.. Baked for another 10 minutes. Stirred and added pork per recipe.

So dry. I followed the recipe but unlike other reviewers, my chops turned out so dry they were difficult to chew. The chops I used had been frozen so perhaps that accounts for the outcome. I might (stress "might") try again with fresh chops but for now, I'll keep looking for an oven baked chops recipe.

I made no changes expect I doubled the pork chops. I made 8 instead of 4. What I didn't do was double the stuffing mix. Big mistake! Of course I ran out of coating. Someone in another review suggested Pork favored stuffing. Next time I may try that. I used chicken flavored to mixed reviews. Husband wasn't crazy about it. But Son -in- law loved it. Went back for seconds. One thing I didn't like was how messy it was to bread. I'm all for easy.

I think it was weird to turn the chops halfway through.  Neither side got crispy .  I  added parm cheese to the  bread mixture but it could have used even more flavor.

Easy and good. 2 of my favourite things. I used bread crumbs seasoned with Italian seasoning.  I also baked them at 350 for 1 hour and turned them over at 1/2 hour. I did that for convenience.

They came out great. I used some ground up Garlic Butter Ritz crackers I had lying around for the crust for extra flavor.

Really good - I crammed my chops into a too-small pan (I used a 13x9 but my chops were huge) so I didn't get the good crust evenly - but the pieces that did get the crust were really good  :-)  Should have used 2 pans (but was having a lazy day)  I floured mine before dipping in the egg, then breadcrumbs (personal preference).  I also added a couple tablespoons of vegetable oil to the pan with the butter (again, personal preference)  This  couldn't be easier or quicker! Very good - thanks for sharing. I'll make again!

Very mediocre.
Unless the chops are paper-thin there is no way to cook them in the time given.
Without substantial seasoning, more than is available with seasoned crumbs, lean pork is bland and dry.
Much tinkering is necessary to make this dish a standout.

We loved these pork chops!  I lined a 13x9 baking dish with aluminum foil, so no cleanup there!  This is a great alternative to fried, and tastes just as good.   I didn't have the stuffing, so I used seasoned bread crumbs and crushed club crackers to have the required amount (could have used much less -- threw away at least 1/3).  These will become a regular at our house.

Really great - fast, moist, delish. However, hubby is trying to stay low/no carb so I swapped out the stuffing for crushed pork rinds. Worked like a charm.

Awesome recipe!!! My boyfriend and his son (who is 7) loved them! The only thing is they could've used a little more salt, but that all depends on the stuffing mix you use. Easy fix, anyways. I made with red potatoes and asparagus and it was fantastic! Thank you for the recipe!!

I made these tonight and they were fabulous!  I did make a few changes based on what I had on hand, and this is what I did.  I sprayed a glass baking dish with olive oil, then melted a little butter in the bottom of that.  Instead of dry stuffing mix, I used bread crumbs to which I added salt, white pepper, black pepper, garlic powder, and some sage.  I cooked them 10 minutes per side in a 400 degree oven, then turned off the oven and let them sit a few more minutes until the coating was crispy.  Served them with baked sweet potatoes and fresh green beans - amazing!  Will definitely be making this again!!

I coveed the pork chop with a thin layer of flour as someone suggested here, and used Italian seasoned bread crumb instead of herb seasoned. The pork chop came out flavorless! No taste at all!  And the crust was saggy!

I made these and my husband loved them, juicy and delicious. The only thing  added is a few Panko Bread Crumbs to the Italian Bread Crumbs. I find that Italian Bread Crumbs alone tend to be dry; (esp. in my meatball recipe.) Also, I have added some Saltine Cracker Crumbs-finely pulverized. Nice touch. Try your own version, but this basic recipe is Awesome...

Finally a pork chop recipe my whole family loved! I also used flour first to coat, then dipped in the milk/egg mixture, and used parmesan/bread crumbs as I had no stuffing mix on hand. My pork chops were very thick, so I pan seared them first, then heated in the oven. Due to the thickness, these needed a few extra minutes in the oven. Took them out at about 140 degrees and let them sit, covered for a few minutes. Wonderful!

I made these tonight with boneless pork tenderloin. I substituted Ceasar croutons for the breadcrumbs. (I never have breadcrumbs). And I did very lightly spray each side of the pork chops after turning them with Pam, because they were looking a little soggy. And, I had to bake them a little longer because my chops were almost an inch thick. The croutons made an amazing breading and they turned out crispy, tender , and juicy.They actually tasted like fried pork chops! My family loved these chops! NO more dry baked pork chops for my family!! thank you!

I used bone-in chops, made this without the stuffing mix, and used seasoned bread crumbs instead.  This was a good, substantial, flavorful, fairly quick meal without too many steps involved.  It is easy to tackle the rest of the dinner while they are baking.  I will definitely make this again.   You could also pan-fry for a few minutes to crisp them up before baking, but I didn't feel like it nor did I want to use extra oil.  These were very good  and tender.

Best and easiest pork chops  I have ever made.  Instead of using dry stuffing mix, I used crushed saltine crackers.  Not only easy to make but very tasty, too.  My chops came out juicy and tender, a first for me.  A recipe keeper.

I followed the recipe exactly as it was clearly written and easy to follow. My husband loves panfried chops but these are much healthier and easy to make! They were the juiciest I ever made and I made it for guests who thanked me several times!

I made this recipe last night.  I used Stove Top Savory Herb Stuffing mix in a box.  It was very good and cheaper than Pepperidge Farm. I double dipped the chops to make the breading a little thicker.  I used thick cut pork chops which meant that the cooking time was a lot longer.  Came out really good though. Had a little trouble with the breading sticking to the chops.  I should have let them dry a little before I put them in the oven.

I used very thick pork chops and they were so juicy.  I didn't have any butter so just used Pam to spray the pan.

I didn't make any changes to this recipe and it came out moist and delicious. If you don't want to waste a container to melt the butter just preheat your oven and put the two tablespoons of butter in the pan and put it in the oven for a couple of minutes to melt the butter. I also put the stuffing mix in a large storage bag and used a rolling pin to make the crumbs smaller and then tossed the pork chops in and tossed to cover. No container to wash and you can throw the remainder of stuffing away. Good recipe, thanks!

This recipe tasted alright but was pretty plain. It would be more helpful to some cooks if "pork chop" was better defined, i.e. bone-in or boneless and thickness of the chop, since this affects cooking time. Also, stuffing mix straight from the package is not fine enough to adhere to the chops.  It needs to be crushed in order to stay on the meat and should be stated in the recipe.

I used seasoned bread crumbs, adding garlic, parmesan cheese and basil to the mix. They turned out great. Quick dinner for a weeknight.

I'm not a big shake n bake fan but that's what my family prefers.  With a family of 11 it costs about $5 just for the shake n bake so I wanted to find a cheaper option for breading the pork chops.  I paid $1.95 for a large can of generic Italian bread crumbs and probably used just over 1/2 the can. Everyone liked them.  One of the ovens must bake differently because one pan browned nicely but I broiled the other for 3 minutes and they just looked more appetizing.  I think I'll add the liquid smoke or some spices to the egg wash like others suggested.  I've never brined chops and may play with that also.

All in all, everyone liked them.  I'd like a bit more spice to them.

This recipe was an easy, and delicious way to serve pork chops.My husband loved the breading and the way the juices sealed into the pork chops. I followed the instructions on the recipe, but used panko bread crumbs, seasoned with salt and pepper, as I did not have the stuffing mix on hand.I will make it again.

This is one of the best and easiest recipes.  I have been eating tough port my whole life until this week, when I made this pork recipe.  Absolutly fail proof.  I used Panko dressing that I ground up in small chopper, added some spices and followed the recipe as written.  Wow, many thanks to whoever found this one out.

I found this to be a very tasty recipe that was quick us co to put together. The only thing I did differently, was to brown the pork chops first. It puts a little bit of a crust on the chops and makes for a very tender and juicy pork chop. Hubby loved it. I did too, quick clean up.

BEAUTIFUL! SO NOT DRY!

The only thing I didn't have was the dry bread stuffing mix, but I always have regular and Panko bread crumbs...I mixed the two together, threw in some Goya Adobo seasoning, and that was that!  Otherwise, I followed the recipe as stated.  My hubby and I were both very pleased with how moist the meat was.  THIS is how I'm making pork chops from now on!

While not the most amazing thing I've ever had, this was a good recipe. Quick, simple, and wonderful for those dinners after a long day at work and no meal plan. Picky husband said he'd eat it again. Maybe I'll add some Italian seasoning or cheese next time, just to "spice" it up a bit.

Good recipe.  I followed the advice of other reviews and used Italian Seasoned Bread Crumbs.  I will make this again, but to keep the breading from getting mushy I will put the chops on a rack, like another review recommended.  Great flavor and very juicy!!

First time brining, oh my oh my!  What an amazing difference.  My husband gasped when he saw the salt but was surprised when there was little salt flavor. Used recipe as printed.  No changes made. We will be having it again.
Thanks ..you really can teach an old dog new tricks.

Simple and taste great!! I am 46 years old and really never cooked much. Always had someone that would do it for me. Plus I spent a long time on the road. Finally got tired of the box meal and broke out of my comfort zone. This website has been great. Loved these chops and love learning cooking is not that hard lol.

very juicy, too the point where the bread crumbs were no longer crunchy. Maybe use more breadcrumbs that are less crummy?Leaves a weird egg smell, needs pepper next time. Still simple and tasty tho. Takes very little time.

Really easy to prepare. Looks like you spent a long time cooking dinner when total time with prep is around half an hour. 
I made these for friends on a work night and everyone thought I came home early from work to make dinner. Pair this with a tossed salad and bottle of wine and your sure to impress.

Excellent and easy, although for me I have to double the total prep time. Maybe I'm just slow, (but thorough). Moist, tender, with the recommended cooking time with thin, bone-in chops. I served with simple boiled potatoes and mixed veggies, with optional country gravy, yum. Some photos attached. See if you can pick out mine.

This was a starter recipe for me. The husband wanted fried oven pork chops like his grandmom.  I had to sub a few things.  I still fried and oven baked. I used chex mix and put that in a processor for my breading and soaked them in milk. I didn't have any eggs. This was a hit but it still wasn't like grandmom.  I didn't think I would beat hers anyway!!

I used cornbread stuffing, and when I put the butter in the baking dish, I added pepper as well. I used Italian Seasoning, and garlic powder in the milk and egg mixture, and it gave it a much better flavor. I never adhere to the recipe, I use it for a guideline, and add my own spin on everything.

Finally!!! Pork chops the whole family loved! 

I made this tonight, with the following changes:

I skipped the pepper (which I will add next time) and I subbed Italian flavored bread crumbs for the stuffing mix. I'll add the pepper and some salt to that next time.

I also melted my butter in the baking dish in the pre-heated oven while I dredged the chops. Using homemade butter helps keep the butter from burning. These were great and I will definitely add them to our rotation, which is saying a lot because I usually HATE pork chops!

They were a bit soggy each time, so we just put them in the skillet for a few minutes after then oven to crisp them up.

Quick, moist and delicious!I started making this recipe from the video without looking at the cook time first. I thought, oh well, dinner will just have to wait for 45 mins or so...I got to the end of the video and it said "10 mins bake time on each side"... YES!! It was a big hit and dinner was on time.

I've used this recipe twice now and love it!! I even added French fried onions on top towards the end of the cooking process (they burn if you put them on top for the whole cook time, I learned that the hard way) and it was delicious. Two thumbs up for sure

Well I used regular breadcrumbs then mixed it with some seasoning and coated the pork chops with Lawrys seasoning. I think that's the only modification I made. It tasted great! It's really easy for a teen to make!

Tasty and easy. The kids like it because it's breaded and I like it because the main course is ready in under thirty minutes, and the meat stays moist and tender. I've also used chicken in place of pork. 

This freezes well. I have frozen before and after cooking. First I freeze it in a single layer on a cookie sheet, then wrap it in foil and put the chops in a plastic bag. Then I thaw overnight and either cook as the recipe indicates if I froze them raw, or heat it in the oven for about 15 minutes if I froze them cooked.

Not a success.  After the cooking time of 20 minutes the chops were still half raw.  I cooked them another 20 minutes, still not done..10 more minutes, no longer pink, but tasted awful.  I don't know, maybe my oven temps are not accurate.

Pork chops aren't the most flavorful of meat choices to begin with, and this just seemed to add more bland to it.

I made this with some modifications. I used seasoned bread crumbs instead of stuffing mix and I cooked it on a rack on top of a cookie sheet. My big complaint is that the breading did not get crunchy and the meat took 30 minutes, not 20 to cook through, though that could be a thickness issue. It was an okay concept but the recipe as written requires some modification.

We liked the flavor and texture of these pork chops. They were easy to prepare, done in 25 minutes with minimal mess, and were moist and tender. Did not like that the breading was soggy. Maybe cook on a rack next time. We will make this again, but will have to figure out the breading problem. Would really give this 3.5 stars.

Hands down the best port chops I have ever tasted.  I did not change the recipe and they came out perfectly cooked and remained moist. No more dry over-cooked pork chops for me!  Simple yet really good.

It was great ... I didn't have any dry bread stuffing so I substituted oyster crackers ... I grated them in my cheese grater and added seasoning ... I cooked mine about 15 mins on each side to get them a little browner ... They were awesome!

They where pretty good. I made a couple of changes by coating my chops in mustard before coating and baking them. My hubby and little one loved them.

This was not a great recipe.  Made it as directed and overall the taste wasn't the best.  Its similar to a shake and bake type of flavor and I'm not a fan of that either.  There is an Italian breaded pork chop recipe on this site that is just as easy to make and has a much better flavor.

Way easier than pan frying, and just as juicy! I would do 13 to 15 minutes per side, and do 3 extra minutes under the broiler. Had some issue with the coating sticking to the pan.

These were tasty, however, did not crisp up no matter what I did.  I did like others suggested and dipped in the milk, then crumbs (I used Panko) and then repeated the dipping process.  Tried cooking them first on a rack as I thought it would be healthier, but they didn't crisp at all, so removed the rack, and still kind of soft.  The taste was good and my boyfriend enjoyed it.  Will try again.

Easily adaptable to lo carb, instead of using bread crumbs or stuffing, crush pork rinds fine like bread crumbs, the dish will then or little or no carbs, as the carbs come from the stuffing.

This recipe was just ok ... if ( and thats a big if ) I ever made this again I would put the stuffing mix through the food processor to make it more powdery .  I found that 20 min was no where near long enough to cook the pork properly .

This was my first attempt at something like this and it was easy and very tasty. My only change was to omit the butter and just spray the baking dish with a little olive oil. No trouble with losing the breading and cooked in just about 23 minutes. The creamy pepper gravy from the Spinach-Infused Potato recipe went well with these as well.

I changed this recipe a wee bit.  Fresh eggs, no milk, and instead of stuffing mix I used Italian Breadcrumbs, Italian Panco, and garlic.  I coated the loin chops and put them back in the fridge to chill before I pan-fried each side and then baked in the oven!  Perfect with smashed taters and salad!

This recipe is so easy. I used boneless pork chops. I doubled the recipe because I cooked 8. Butter works much better in the pan than cooking spray. Will make again!

These were very yummy.  I think they would've been just as good with Italian seasoned breadcrumbs. I used margarine since I rarely keep real butter around. My picky three year old loved them and ate a whole chop easily!

I cooked this exactly how the directions said to and it was FANTASTIC! I used the boneless pork chops from Costco and cut them in half to make them a bit thinner. The cooking time suggested was perfect; they came out juicy! My hubby loved it! We had a simple salad on the side...wonderful dinner.

I made this tonight and everyone loved it!  Pork chops were moist and delicious.  I used Pepperidge Farms herb seasoned stuffing mix and crushed it with a rolling pin so it was easier to use to coat the pork chops. I also used 4 TBS butter because I made 6 pork chops.  This is my new go-to recipe for pork chops.  It is so easy!  Thank you for sharing.

Wow, so easy and so good. Here is what I did, I used Italian bread crumbs like many others. I added two tablespoons of butter at the beginning and two more after I turned them. I needed a little longer than the recommended 20 minutes cooking time!!!  My boys and my husband loved them!!!

This is my go to recipe for pork chops.  Perfect EVERY TIME.  I use 3/4 in. boneless chops and italian bread crumbs.  It is very important to remove all fat from the pork chops, or else you will have a gooey mess.  I also took the advice of another rater and melt the 2 tablespoons butter in the pan by placing it in the oven as the oven is heating.  I never have to worry about leftovers!

Yummy and easy! My thick cut boneless pork chops were not quite cooked after 20 mins and needed a bit longer, but thinner cut chops would definitely be done. Loved the stuffing as a coating, but I did crush it first so it would adhere easier.

I really enjoyed this.  I think they were better than frying and I didnt have to stand there and watch them cook. I did flour the pork chops first. I am not sure if it helped or not but they cooked up nice and juicy. I am really glad I found this recipe and it is a great alternative to shake-n-bake(which I do not care for).

So my husband is not a very expressive person and he couldn't stop complementing me on these chops!  I will be making these regularly.  I, too, only used 1 egg and 1 Tb of milk, a little extra oil and 1/2 cp of Italian bread crumbs instead of stuffing mix.

i don't know if it was the bread crumbs that i used..but it didn't stick to the pork chops. as i was cutting into the cooked pork chop, the breading was coming off so i was just eating a plain piece of pork meat..yuck!! i'll try again with the stuffing mix though and will let you know how that goes.

This was a great recipe! I used generic Grape Nuts cereal as a coating with some various spices (to up fiber). I will definitely add this to my quick and easy recipe list.

This recipe is good.  I used Stove Top Stuffing and put it in the magic bullet for a few seconds to make it more like bread crumbs, otherwise it doesn't stick very well.  There is nothing really special about this recipe but it is cheap, easy to make, and tastes good.

It was great since I never ever cook and I had all the ingredients lying around my house. My brother loved it, which was great but I personally only took a bite and gave up :) maybe because I was craving pasta and wanted that instead. But I did impress my bro with my non-existent cooking skills which was great! :D

Tastes great! I followed the recipe exactly except I used chicken flavored stuffing mix. Tip: I chopped the stuffing mix up really fine because it sticks to the pork chops better. It turned out really good! Thanks!

These were pretty good. I made as directed but without the butter. Instead, I sprayed I Can't Believe It's Not Butter on each side before baking. I generously salted and peppered the chops before dipping. One of the issues was that the cubes of stuffing were large (stovetop brand) and didn't really create a "breading" - more like a topping. Next time I will crush them up more or use breadcrumbs. Also, they had to cook for 15 minutes per side for me (1 in thick) and after 10 minutes the breading on top started to burn and I had to cover with foil. Nevertheless, I think this is a good recipe and worth making again.

Delicious recipe, I used pork tenderloin thinned out. There were 4 large pieces cut them in 8 smaller ones. Used stove top and out them in the blender to make them in bread crumbs. Very good will make it again. Healthy too did not need all the fat for taste : )

Outstanding and so easy.  My family inhaled it, especially my picky 14-year-old son.  Like others, I used Pam instead of butter, and Italian bread crumbs instead of the stuffing mix.  Served with rotini pasta lightly seasoned with Romano, and green beans seasoned with Mrs. Dash. I estimate the fat content of one serving of this dinner with pasta and beans to be 13 grams of fat.

Made this for dinner last night, and we ate it, but it wasn't anything special, IMO.  I used cornbread stuffing, which we all love, and it was what I had on hand. I crushed the stuffing a bit, then dipped in the egg, stuffing, quickly dipped back in egg & then stuffing again.  This helped keep the big chunks on the chops.  I used olive oil spray instead of butter which gave it a nice crunchy texture, and had no issues with stuffing coming off.  I baked for 15min on each side since my chops were thick.  Overall, this was somewhat bland, and sort of a pain for the end result.  I probably won't make again.

I used bead crumbs instead, and seasoned my meat first also.  Really good and tender!

Very Delicious! I wanted to try a different recipe for pork chops and this is it. I added a little tyme in the egg and milk mixture, I love the taste of tyme so they came out so good and I also used italian bread crumbs instead of the stuffing. Will be trying this again.

Great chops.  I followed the recommendations of other reviewers and added the onion and garlic powders to both the egg and cracker crumbs. I also added some Lea & Perrins Worcestershire Sauce to the egg, AWESOME.  Moist, tender, and great tasting.  Thanks for the recipe.

The stuffing didn't stick. After the 10 minutes on each side the pork chop was too hard and dry! The stuffing started to burn will not make this again.

Thoroughly enjoyed this one, with just a tweak or two.  Toasted up some breadcrumbs I had in the freezer and played with the spice mixture.  Last time I made this, I used Goya's Adobo seasoning (with pepper) and some Italian seasoning mix and toasted it up with the breadcrumbs.  (Think it would be fabulous with some rosemary or grill seasoning -- plenty of room for creativity.) I also used bone-in pork-chops (about 1/2" thick), so I extended the cooking time -- about 20 minutes on the first side, then finished up with 15 on the flip-side.  Turned out very tasty, juicy and tender. Yum!

This was a fast and easy way to cook dinner for myself (it was very easy to make just one serving!).  I didn't have stuffing mix on hand so I just used some Italian bread crumbs, which made for a thinner coating but still enjoyable.  I will use this again.

My husband loved it and complained that I didn't make enough! I used buttermilk instead of milk and used the only stuffing mix I could find in my country, which smelled great but I had trouble getting the bread crumbs/croutons in the mix to stick to the pork. We also love that it is pretty healthy with minimal fat used (I just coated the pan with butter instead of using the recipe's portion.) And this is just so EASY to make! Will definitely be a regular at our table.

VERY EASY! Next time, I'll use a little less butter because the stuffing breading was kind of soggy. All I had was chicken stove-top so that's what I used. Very good. A little salty though.

This is a tasty and easy recipe.  The only real change I made was to double-dip the chops - egg, then breading, then egg again, and breading again.  It really helps it stick without having to try and do a really thick coat the first time.  My husband actually commented "hm, these are good and I don't usually like pork chops" which was news to me!  So I'm glad I cooked them this way.  Will definitely make again.
*I did have to cook mine longer, but my chops were very, very thick cut.  They still turned out moist and tender.

Very simple recipe but packs a lot of flavor. Came out very tender and juicy. I didn't have pork chops so I used pork tender loin sliced about a half inch thick.

I loved the flavor of the herbed stuffing mix and browned butter after baking. I need to play with the cook temp/time, though. My 6 oz boneless pork chops were tough after cooking per the recipe. Will try a lower heat next time. I served this with a simple egg noodle in butter cream sauce, with a little Herbes de Provence to echo the herbs in the coating. I will definitely make this again, and hope to perfect it soon. One more thing... it needs a little sea salt (or regular salt) after cooking. That brings all the flavor out. And for those that used non-stick spray instead of butter, I think you missed out on some of the flavor in the recipe, but clearly you were making a healthy choice. Maybe using a butter-flavored spray would be a good idea.

This was the first time I have ever made pork chops.  It's usually scary when I cook, so when my boyfriend took a bite and said "Wow", I knew I had done well.  We both loved it.  Quick, easy, and lots of flavor!  Wouldn't change a thing!

Easy and straight forward recipe. Husband and kids liked them. I used cooking spray instead of the butter, and sprayed the pan again when turning the chops -- they didn't stick and remained crunchy. Will definitely make again.

I was disappointed.  When i think of "fried" any thing i think of something crucncy or crispy.  Mine came out rather soggy.  They tasted fine but they tasted like shakenbake and the stuff from the box has less clean up....

I just made this for dinner and it turned out fantastic! It tastes just like they were pan-fried in oil. I followed the recipe as is except I used seasoned bread crumbs instead of stuffing mix, but I always have bread crumbs in the house so that's why. I would definitely make this again!

I was never good at making pork chops.. Always tuff and dried out. Oh not these. They were great and so so easy to make. My family LOVED them..

This is the easiest and best tasting pork chop recipe I have tried. I also used seasoned bread crumbs instead of stuffing mix. The porks chop come out delicious! Thanks for the great recipe.

The best pork chops I have ever had!! They turned out nice and crisp on the outside and juicy in the middle and they weren't greasy!! No leftovers thats for sure. I only had plain bread crumbs so I threw in some rosemary, thyme, and garlic salt. This simple recipe deserves way more than 5 stars.

I changed the recipe a little also by dipping in flour first and then using bread crumbs. I had thick chops so I baked them for 15 minutes each side. I did find that the crust got a little soggy on the bottom, but no one cared in my house. They were very moist and good. I will use this recipe again, maybe adding a little garlic powder to liven it up even more!!

This was great and easy! I'm not normally a fan of pork-chops, but these won me over. To go with I made rutabaga mashed potatoes. Thank you for this new family fav!!

It was okay.  The meat was very moist, but the stuffing mixture didn't stick very well.

I omitted the milk, dipped it in flour prior to the egg, and used a breadcrumb, oregano, basil, garlic mix instead of the stuffing. I seared it in a cast iron skillet then placed it in the oven for about 10 minutes. (adj time for thickness; I had thin tenderloins.)

AWESOME recipe! I made this for the first time tonight and loved how easy it was to make and how delicious it was! I just added a little garlic powder to each side to give it a little more flavor. Next time I might add a drizzle of lemon to each chop, but it's YUMMY as is!

These pork chops were so delicious.  They had a great flavor and were tender and moist.  Not the least bit dry.  My six year old had seconds!  This is one I'll be making again.

I mixed crushed club crackers with italian bread crumbs instead of the stuffing mix and it turned out perfect.  The crumbs stuck nicely and the flavor was excellent!

When I cooked this, the people who ate it were nervous because of the way it looked, but said it was pretty good.
