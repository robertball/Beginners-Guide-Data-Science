These were tasty but I do have to agree with Robograndma (a cook I trust very much) and say as the recipe states these fries are very soggy. I ended up letting them cook until tender then turned up the oven to 400 and still wasnt getting anywhere. I ended up having to broil them on high stir and keep a close eye on them to get them to crisp up. They have a very good flavor the cooking method is just a bit off.

We normally make a chili seasoned baked fry but my 2-yr old won't eat spicy food.  He LOVES these!  Instead of brown sugar, I added a little vanilla extract into the olive oil.  Also- I didn't have coriander.  I added a little cumin and pumpkin pie spice to the recipe.  Yum!  If you make a little extra, these are also delicious to take from the fridge as a snack.  Many times, I find the potatoes don't cook enough from the oven alone (and they're hard to cut up uncooked), so I microwave them until soft, then cut up.  I put in oven on 400 until crispy.

Thumbs up! I omitted the cardamom & corriander, added 1/4 tsp nutmeg and used Splenda brown sugar. After the 30 min cooking time the recipe recommended, they weren't done, so I increased the temp to 400 for about 15 min. The brown sugar & spices carmelized and were beyond yummy!

*** Update 12-04-10 -- I made these again tonight & instead of using the olive oil, I used Pam Olive Oil Cooking Spray. They were still delicious & lower in fat & calories. They also were a little crisper than when I made them before. Best yet! ***

Maybe I did somthing wrong,but my fries did not come out chrisp. I thought they were going to be chrisp like fries. The family loved them just the same and I did also. I did leave out the brown suger MIL is a diabetic I was worried about the sugers in the sweet potatoes without adding more to it. As I said the family loved these twin 21 yr old sons that never agree both said it's a  do-again maybe even for holiday dinner. So I gave this 4 stars but not the 5 because I just can't get past the no chrisp factor.

Love these.  The first day after serving these, I got a text midday from my hubby thanking me for dinner the night before.  (It wasn't my regular BBQ chicken or steamed broccoli that was on his mind.)  They are not crisp fries but about the same as any other oven baked fries.  I made a few changes.  I left out the sugar since I served them with a vanilla maple icing drizzle.  I left the peels on and that seemed to make many of the fries more firm.  I skipped the cold water and put all the ingredients in a plastic bag to coat and then sit for about 30 minutes prior to baking.  That gave a nice uniform coating of spice and oil.  I set my oven to 400 degrees F and baked for 40 minutes, turning them at 20 minutes.  Finally, I put them under the broiler for a bit.  Watch that step carefully.  They go from perfect to burnt in a second.

I made these according to Suz's version but instead of rolling them in oil, I sprayed olive oil Pam on the bottom and then laid on the cut fries, then I sprayed with Pam again, sprinkled on the spices and vanilla instead of sugar. Baking them for about 25 minutes at 400 made them semi crispy. Easy and good for you, too!

Good spice suggestions Carolyn! To the folks looking for crispier fries you can soak the cut sweet potatoes in a salt water bath then pat dry. This will draw out much of the water. Also pre heat the baking sheet. With that being said, I prefer plumper softer sweet potato fries. Good job Carolyn!

These tasted yummy, but as a novice cooker, I struggled a bit and in the end, the boyfriend was not a fan.  First of all, I wasn't sure if I was supposed to peel them or not (I did) and who knew raw sweet potatoes were so hard to slice!  I popped them in the microwave for a 1.5 minutes and that made them managable to slice.  Also, the recipe didn't say to spray the sheet first, and being the novice chef that I am, I didn't.  I will next time because they stuck.  The kitchen smelled great and the fries were tasty, but if its all the same, I'll just stick to a baked sweet potato.

These were different but super tasty. Based on other's experiences/reviews, I baked it longer- but I guess some were still a little "soggy" and others were a little too crisp. The spices were amazing. next to the temperature thing, it was really yummy and really didn't take that long to make. Something to make again!

Boyfriend LOVED them, I also thought they needed to be crispier. I did broil them at the end and that helped a little bit. Be careful not to let them burn though!

Excellent flavor but mine stuck to the foil.  It didn't stop us from devouring them because the tasted sooo good, but I'll have to find a better way of incorporating the seasonings to sweet potatoes. AMAZING!

These fries are SO good.  Nice and sweet, good flavor.  I followed the recipe as written, also mixed them with my hands to better coat them with spices and oil before putting them in the oven.  I left them in a little longer than 30 minutes, they were nice and soft with some crispy edges.  Can't wait to make them again.

Good spice combo! I thought it would be too sweet, but it was just right. If you want crispier fries try higher heat and less cooking time.

I seasoned the sweet potatoes with a homemade pie spice mix (in lieu of simply cinnamon, ginger & cardamom) and replaced the brown sugar with white as that was what I had on hand. The flavour is good, though I would reduce the sugar or cut it out next time. The fries, despite using the microwave method combined the oven, were not even remotely crisp. I think baking at 400F until crisp (with the microwave method) will achieve much better results.

I gave this four stars because they had a nice flavor and everyone (including my very picky 3 year old) just loved them.  However, I agree with others on the soggy factor.  I was expecting crisp fries and this was more like a sweet potato bake.  Still a hit, but not exactly fries.  I did make a nice sauce that complimented them (salad cream mixed with brown sugar).

sweet potatoes have a different consistency than regular yukon or baking potatoes so they will not come out as crispy but I still think these are delicious. My three year old will not eat sweet potatoes in any other form so I make these for her. I just use some olive oil, salt and pepper- cook them for 10 mins and then flip em around and cook them 10 more. They aren't as 'crispy' but it's ok. It doesn't mean they're bad- just different.

I like crispi so I turned up the oven to 400 degrees, IF you do this though don't cut them too thin (go wedge style) and add 5-10 mins. I also love sweeet, so I mixed 2 tsp of orange flavored olive oil with 1/2 tsp cinnamon and 2 packs of splenda, then thinly coated the pan with the orange flavored olive oil, layed them out sprinkling the sweeter blend and when they came out I sprinkled with brown sugar and cinnamon. My family loved these, if you want to increase the flavor and smell adding a few drops of pomegranate balsamic vinegar sends your palets to gourmet heaven. These dont last in my house longer than a day, the smell is so powerful I cant even attempt to hide them.

Okay, these were delicious BUT I left out all the seasonings!  I cut them in small fries and drizzled olive oil and baked for more like 40 min.  Based on others reviews, I wasn't expecting them to be crispy and they weren't! But sweet and perfect with our grilled burgers!

These fries were excellent. I got a little over zealous with the olive oil drizzle, but they still were great. THe added ginger was a nice touch.

These have a great flavour, but like some of the other reviewers, I found the cooking method was a bit off. I cooked them at 400 for closer to 40 minutes and they were done, but still not as crispy as I would like. I really liked the mixture of spicys though, so I'll make again and play around with times and temperatures.

Used cinnamon, brown sugar, pumpkin pie spice and coconut oil. Baked at 400 for almost an hour and broiled for the last few minutes to crisp. Slightly salted and delicious!!

I used my spray oil dispenser and sprayed the cookie sheet before I placed the fries on it and then sprayed the fries so the coating would stick. I turned the fries over half way through and sprinkled the other side with the coating also. The sweet potato fries were delicious!

I really loved the spice mixture described in this dish! The sweet potatoes taster wonderfully, but we're very soft in spite of being baked an extra 5 minutes. Next time, I'm going to brown them in a skillet before baking... or after.

I used coconut oil instead of olive oil and no sugar.  They really do not need the extra sugar with the spices. I added extra fresh ginger, I keep ginger in freezer and grate when I need.  Spray bottom of cooking sheet to keep from sticking.

My whole family liked these a lot. Instead of cutting the potatoes into fries, I halved the potatoes crosswise and then cut them into wedges. Parchment on the baking sheet helped immensely with clean-up. I loved the flavor blend, and yet the potatoes retained their own flavor and character; this dish is a healthier alternative to more traditional candied sweet potatoes. I have a feeling that I'll be asked to make these again, and I will happily comply!

The flavors were good but the consistency was too soft. I was expecting more of a french-fry consistency, and instead, it was mushy. Perhaps too much oil or not high enough oven temps. It took me almost 50 minutes at 350º and they still never got crisper.

This has become my go to Sweet Potato recipe.  I usually skip the Cardamom and the Coriander, and use Nutmeg instead like another review recommended.  Those just aren't spices I have.  In any case, it comes out great.  I bake for longer, or I microwave for a minute before to get it cooked enough. Kids love them.

Very good! The idea for fries was very last minute so I just used salt, ground cinnamon, & brown sugar after tossing them in olive oil.  Turned out great!!

Sorry, but we didn't enjoy these at all. The flavor was odd, and they never crisped up. Won't make again.

The taste was good but they were limpy or burnt to a crisp.  None had the right "french fry" consistancy.
