This is my hands-down favorite recipe I've tried on this site.  Added a whole can (12oz) of coconut milk instead of just one cup, and forgot the peas at the end.  Simmered uncovered for an hour instead of 10 minutes or so because my family prefers softer cauliflower, which also helped thicken.  Added salt as others suggested as well.  My grandparents always served curry with a variety of toppings, as desired, including plum jam, peanuts, sweet relish, coconut flakes.  I added peanuts & sweet relish as last-minute toppings to this.  So yummy.  This will be a regular for us.

Doubled the carrots and peas, halved the potatoes. Used curry paste instead of powder and chicken bullion instead of veggie broth. Very good and flavorful, will make again.

This was great.  Gently toast the curry powder in the coconut oil at the very beginning, careful not to let it scorch. Used just a few potatoes, and added more chickpeas.  Increased the garlic and ginger by a bit.  If you have the time, fully cook dried chickpeas and use those, as the texture is much nicer (you can adjust to your preference). Use 2 cups cooked as a sub for the canned, or more if desired. I really liked the sriracha as an extra layer of flavor.

The flavors of the cumin, ginger, soy, and garlic, are wonderful.   I did not have coconut milk on hand, so I substituted whole milk.  Because we have been cutting back on carbs, I omitted the potatoes and added additional cauliflower ( a whole head).  Absolutely wonderful!  Our son was here visiting when I cooked it, and he asked to take home the left-overs.  I love that boy, AND I love this recipe!

Very good Meatless Monday dish.  I used finely chopped cauliflower because I have family members that don't like it.  Using it finely chopped allowed me to add it without them knowing.  Shhh.  I skipped the potatoes and added zucchini because of what I had on hand.  The only other change that I made was extra spices and I used coconut milk in the rice.  I will make this again.

Very tasty! Don't forget to salt to taste otherwise you will find it a little bland. First time I made this I found it to be a little to watery. 2ND time I made it I thickened it up a bit by slowly sifting in a heaping tablespoon of flour. PERFECTO!!! Go ahead and add cubed  precooked chicken breast if you like. Won't hurt the recipe one bit.

The recipe is great. I made double the recipe so that my family of four adults could have it for the workweek. They loved it! The combination of the spices, the tomato paste and creaminess of the coconut milk makes it taste so good. It is simple to make, so highly recommend it.

Very good! I modified the recipe a bit. Used beef broth instead of vegetable stock since I needed to use it up and used double the chickpeas, no potatoes or cauliflower (just didn’t have any and needed to save time anyway), used frozen peas and carrots instead. I thought the curry was quite delicious. Just spicy enough for my taste. I will def add to my favorites. Will make again.

Adding this to our dinner rotation! Easy to put together and nothing fancy required. A great pantry staple! Left out the maple syrup and added extra carrots. Didn't have cauliflower so added some spinach for some extra nutrition. Very easy to customize!  My 13 month old son gobbled this up! I left out the red pepper flakes and cilantro, I figured the curry powder would be more than enough flavour for him. This was really hearty and satisfying, a wonderful meatless dinner.

This is very good but, could use about a tablespoon more curry. I used powdered ginger and chicken broth and that was fine for me. My sauce remained on the thin side so, I will double the tomato paste next time and cook it longer before I add veggies. Naan bread and a portion of plain yogurt would really step this up. Next time.

We really enjoyed it, I didn't have coconut oil, so I used olive oil. I used canned, drained pinto beans instead of chick peas but I think I would like chick peas better.

I enjoyed this curry dish and had it a day after I made it, which usually brings out the flavor more. I can see adding chicken (as a reviewer suggested) or even shrimp. For my tastes, I needed a little more sweetness, so I added a few good squirts of agave nectar.  Very easy to put together and great over the basmati rice. Thanks for the recipe!

I added mushrooms, paprika, honey instead of maple syrup, garlic powder instead of garlic, and doubled the seasonings (maybe tripled). I didn’t have peas either. I thought ugly the dish was pretty good but it took awhile to make. Makes a lot though so I’ll have it for a few days! I would make this again!

Straight from the pan, this was delicious, but once we put it over rice, it was like all of the flavor disappeared! We needed plenty of salt and sriracha at the table. I don't know what tweaking could be done to fix this, which is too bad because by itself it really is delicious.

My husband loved this dish.  My daughter (7) miraculously stopped complaining about food, for the duration of the meal.  

I did make a few changes.  I thought I had chickpeas, but I was out so I substituted black beans.  I omitted the carrot because carrots are the devil, and I omitted the maple syrup because I just really dislike sweet food that isn't dessert.  I switched the curry powder for Penzey's Tsar Dust, because my daughter likes the mild but flavorful combination and gets anxious that I'm going to sneak in pepper any time she hears the words "curry powder." 

Like I said, it was a popular dish at our dinner table, and we'll be eating it again! It came together pretty easily for a weeknight meal, too.

5 stars with changes

Made 1.5 times this amount, enough for at least 12 servings!

Used butter, 2 onions, 5+  tbs curry powder, 1/4 tsp red pepper flakes, 4 cups chicken broth, extra paste, 2lbs potatoes,  4 cups broccoli instead of cauliflower, 2 cans (30 oz) chickpeas, 1lb spiralized veggies, 1.5 cans coconut milk, 2 large handfuls peas. Would need about 4c dry basmati rice I think. No sriracha needed.

Delish! I had hot curry powder so I omitted the chili flakes and sriracha.  I also had honey rather than maple syrup and only realized my "chickpeas" were pinto beans when I took them out of the pantry but threw them in anyway.  Still yummy!  I otherwise followed the measurements exactly and was happy to have plenty of sauce to soak the rice.  Will definitely make this on the regular!

My husband and I are frequent cooks and Indian inspired dishes are something we love experimenting with! We always have many of the staple ingredients for an Asian dish in the cupboard so when last night's dinner was still a mystery at 6pm it was easy to choose this recipe because although this does have many ingredients, most of them we already had on hand.  A few changes we made:
*No curry powder so I subbed Cumin, Tumeric and Chili Powder. I did not measure, I added to taste.
*I do not like cilantro so I garnished with a dollop of plain yogurt and leeks.
*I may have used more garlic than it calls for since the cloves were small, 4 small cloves + 2 large cloves.
*We just so happened to have fresh ginger on hand, I was going to use powdered until I found it at the last minute!
*I added a tablespoon of Umami, a paste I bought from Trader Joe's that gives great flavor to Asian dishes.
*No Basmati rice in the house so we used white rice instead. I also like to season my rice so I cooked it in vegetable stock instead of water.
*I happened to have Ginger Miso Broth in the fridge that needed to get used up so I used that in place of the vegetable  broth for the sauce,  this stuff comes in a box with a pour spout from Trader Joe's and I highly recommend it for Asian dishes!
*I used a whole can of Coconut Milk because I didn't want left over Coconut Milk. Because of this, I had to transfer the recipe from my cast iron to a pot, it added a considerable amount more sauce and I hadn't

Did not use the maple syrup or the pepper flakes and overall I was happy with my results. Looks like I inadvertently left out the soy sauce too which explains why I had to add salt. Wasn't crazy creamy but it was good. Will make again.

Didn't alter a thing and it was delicious. However, in an attempt to cut down a bit on starch, next time will swap the potatoes for broccoli and don't think it will have any negative impact.  This will definitely be in the recipe box to make again!

This was super yummy! I did make a few modifications. I used the whole can of coconut milk and I used cornstarch to thicken it. I had to increase the cooking time quite a bit to thoroughly cook the potatoes, cauliflower, and chickpeas. This is so tasty - my husband and I will definitely be adding this dish to our regular rotation!

Made exactly as specified and it's yummy. I think my potato bits were too big because they took so long to cook.

For a thicker sauce, I blended a second can of undrained chickpeas and added vegetable broth as needed. Also, instead of maple syrup, I used a little crushed pineapple and raisins for some sweetening.

Best curry I’ve ever had! Made just as the recipe suggests, but put in more of the onions and carrots, and also added chicken. Amazing! Per the comments of others, I also added the full can of coconut milk instead of a cup.

Really liked this recipe.  
Changes to this one:
I reduced the amount of broth and increased coconut milk to make more creamy.  
Added more red pepper flakes to add kick.  It still wasn't enough.  
Cooking time for potatoes and cauliflower took 2-3 x longer than stated.  
In the future I will:
Add more garlic and ginger - probably increase 25-50%
Allow more cooking time - about an hour once the potatoes are added.
Add more red pepper flakes.

I left out the potatoes and have this with basmati rice. It is absolutely addictive. Love it!!!! Sometimes I make it very spicy, sometimes I leave out the sriracha and add it later if I want something with more heat. Very versatile and terrific.

This is an awesome base recipe that you can play with to fit your tastes! The sauce is wonderful! I made a few changes based on what was in my pantry (didn't use potatoes, but threw in some mushrooms instead, left out the cilantro because I don't care for it, etc.) and it turned out great.

Was just ok. Didn't seem to have much depth of flavor. Needs something for umami. After trying it as-is, I sprinkled on some garam masala and salt and stirred in, and it was ok but not great since it didn't have a chance to meld with the rest of the dish. It might be worth adding some garam masala and maybe a touch of cinnamon and/or cumin (which are traditional in Indian cuisine) along with the curry. I really wanted to like this, but I don't think I'll bother making it again.

Delicious option for "Meatless Monday"! Family loved it, even my kids, ages 7 and 9. Served over basmati rice and added some salt. Added cilantro afterwards so my kids could have it without cilantro as they are not fans. Everyone was happy! Thank you!

Very good.. Even my kids liked it.   It does need salt at least 2 teaspoons.  I also added about 2 tablespoons of flour to thicken it.

This recipe by all means was “okay” Healthy, easy enough to make but very bland. Added salt which usually helps, but this case it didn’t. I also add a few grape tomatoes and some corn which was a great addition to the recipe.

This was fabulous, a real winner!  I didn't have cauliflower or vegetable stock,  so I substituted 4 cups colored peppers and mushrooms with chicken stock.  We like things on the spicier side so I added a little more curry and red pepper flakes.  Great vegetarian dish, thank you!

This was a great recipe!!  Very easy to make and turned out well.  We ended up adding red bell peppers and a bit more curry spice for flavour.  We'll make it again for sure

I love the mix of veggies, but not too crazy about the flavor.

This is a keeper recipe! I didn't have peas, so I never add it. The recipe in the wording did not mention to add veggie stock to the potatoes in the pot! Lucky I remember to add it, or else it will burn.

This is quite delicious! I added a 1/2 cup more peas and used brown rice. The dish was flavorful and I am a meat eater and didn't feel like was missing out on meat because the flavor was oh so good and the texture was on point!  Adding this to my personal cookbook as I will surely make it again!!

Yum! This over rice is so comforting. Perfect cold weather fare.
