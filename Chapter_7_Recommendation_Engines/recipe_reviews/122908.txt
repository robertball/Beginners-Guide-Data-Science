This was so easy, I was totally amazed! You really do need to use a sause that has lots of flavor. I would add onions and more garlic next time to the spinach. I put the spinach mixture into a bag with the tip cut and piped it into the shell (much easier than a spoon).

I made this recipe for Sunday dinner and it was a hit.  I was a bit nervous, making it the night before that the shells wouldn't be soft enough but they turned out very well cooked.  I added some meat to the recipe by browning some ground pork and then adding it into the spaghetti sauce.  My family really liked the meal and I loved that I could make it ahead.  I should note that I cooked it a little differently.  Instead of 45 minutes I set the oven at 250 and it cooked while we were away at church, about 3 hours.  I covered it with foil while it cooked and it was very hot and bubbly when we took it out.  I will definately make this again.

This is great to put together on Sunday night, and then bake on Monday when you get home from work.  The only thing I "changed" was adding a couple ounces of ground beef/turkey to the jar of spaghetti sauce on top for additional texture.  You do get a lot of flavor from the sauce, so be sure to use one you like; I blended a cheap jar with a favored jar, and in retrospect regret not adding just a splash of wine as well to give it that extra-polished edge.

I made this dish for our Christmas Eve meal. It tasted wonderful but was very hard to remove from pan. Did not look pleasing when served. We had 20 people for dinner so I made 3 pans. I could not get the manicotti out to serve.

Yumm-O!  I added a bit more garlic and spicach, just to stretch the filling.  It froze beautifully and tasted wonderful!

Great Recipe! I found that if you prepare the dish right before you bake it (at the max. time of 50 min.) the pata is perfectly al dente.

This was really delicious! I baked it the same day I made it. I cooked it for 40 minutes and the shells were perfect! In the future I might put a little more garlic and use a higher quality sauce.

THIS IS THE FIRST REVIEW THAT I HAVE SUBMITTED, BUT I JUST HAD TO LET YOU KNOW THIS RECIPE WAS WONDERFUL. WE HAD AN ITALIAN THEME DINNER AT MY CHURCH AND ALL I HAD HEARD WAS SPAGHETTI OR LASAGNA, SO I WANTED SOMETHING DIFFERENT BUT SIMPLE. I HAD NO IDEA WHAT A HIT IT WAS GOING TO BE.

This is the first time I've posted a review and your's is review-worthy! Followed the recipe and it was WONDERFUL!! I made for parents when they visited and they were thrilled! I found I had extra filling so, I added mushroom stems, some bread crumbs and made stuffed mushrooms to go with dinner! Serve with a romaine salad with olives, red onions, bell peppers and Itallian dressing....an itallian meal to please all! Thanks for the recipe, I am making again on Wednesday night for my best friend and her children...I even added my own pic of your recipe, makes me hungry for it every time I look at it!   (Added 12/10) I had to add to my last review, as I have made this yet again and dare I say it was even better!! I added fresh ground nutmeg to the cheese/spinach mixture before stuffing the shells. I LOVE this recipe! Stuffing the uncooked shells makes this sooo much easier!

This recipe is easy to prepare and delicious. Also, PERFECT for company since it is made ahead. I used less sauce/water mix the second time I made it, and it turned out great.

Our make-ahead cooking group has made these a few times, and it's a family favorite. The first time we made them, we accidentally cooked the manicotti shells before stuffing them. A few broke, but otherwise the results were still great. Now that we've realized that you don't have to cook the noodles, as long as you cover them in enough sauce, this is much easier. It's way easier to stuff uncooked shells! To stuff shells, we put the filling in a large, plastic freezer bag, then cut the bottom corner to create a make-shift piping bag, and it made filling the shells very easy.

This was pretty good.  i used fresh spinach, sauted and pressed to get the water out.  Also, I didn't refridgerated overnight, just a few hours.  I didn't add the water just sauce.  Worked good.  Noodles were soft as though they had been pre-cooked.  One word of caution, make sure you really stuff those manicotti tightly.  The noodles (at least mine) expanded when cooking so it seemed there was less filling than if you made them with pre-cooked noodles.  This was probably my fault though.  Next time I will REALLY pack those noodles.  Thanks for a quick and easy recipe.  I'll probably never fuss around with filling cooked ones.  Will make again.

This was amazingly easy and incredibly delicious!  I kept putting off this recipe because it was a "make ahead" recipe.  I finally just made it and cooked it all in one and it was AMAZING!  My husband, who hates anything green, loved it and couldn't wait for me to make more!  It was even better the next day.  I think you do get the best flavor mixture when you make it ahead and will try that next time.  GREAT RECIPE!

I made this for my family.  Kids thought it had way too much spinach and I tend to agree.  I'll try it again with less spinach.  On the plus side, I made a couple and froze them to see how they worked as make-ahead meals.  They were great, with the exception of the spinach problem.

This manicotti is tasty and easy to prepare.  I followed the recipe exactly.  I agree with other reviewers; use a sauce you really like.  I only gave 4 stars b/c I thought the filling was a little bland.  Next time I will add more garlic to the filling for a little extra flavor.

I really enjoyed this one! Made a few minor changes: instead of using onion powder and garlic powder I sauteed  chopped onion with a little minced garlic in olive oil. Also, added a little red wine and a tiny but of brown sugar to the spaghetti sauce. Plan to make it again! Thanks!

My 6 yr old and I used this recipe for our weekly "cooking class" (my version of getting some help with dinner!) and it turned out very well. We sauteed the spinach with some onion, garlic and S&P and let it cool before adding it to the cheese.  I decided to add some ground turkey into the cheese mixture which was a mistake - the tubes filled up too quickly, we had a lot of cheese left over and not enough in the tubes.  Next time I will just add the cooked meat to the sauce and leave the filling as is.  We thought the pasta was just a little "gummy" but I'll take that with the convenience of not having to cook the pasta and then do the filling!

Love this recipe! I always forget to make it the night before, so I just make it the same day and it turns out just fine. Also, I cook it covered with foil for the first 30 minutes and then uncover for 15 min. So easy! Stuff the filling into a ziploc and snip & fill the shells. I even use slightly less sauce (but I use a garlic and onion flavor one) and add more spices. Yum!

This was super yum!!! I only soaked a few hours - 2 or 3 - and they came out perfect. No need to water the sauce (blah!). I put the cheese mixture in a ziploc, snipped of the end and piped it into the shells. Easy cheesy :)

Absolutely delicious.  I was a little worried about not cooking the noodles before, but it turned out perfectly.  Rave reviews all around.  I also added a little pesto sauce to the filling and used a sauce with pesto and spicy tomato.

Good basic recipe, but simply too bland - added Italian seasoning to filling and ground spicy turkey sausage, mushrooms and artichoke hearts to sauce, and substituted approx 1/2 cup red wine for water. Not sure what else could spiff this up - maybe I goofed.

This is the first review I have written on all recipes. My only change was to double the garlic powder. I actually doubled the whole filling portion with plans to freeze a batch and bake one.  I am definitely going to fill my second package of shells and freeze the second batch. this was delicious. For those commenting an sauce quality, I used Paul Neuman Marinara, you can buy regular or organic. baked for 50 minutes based on another reviewers comments, thanks to the reviewer who suggested using a plasitc bag and piping the filling into the shells limited mess and fast! three out of three kids loved it.  Five stars for ease of preparation, clean up and ability to make ahead. This was a soccer game, ballet rehearsal and recital weekend and it was great to finish saturday with a meals at home. (I prepared this friday night after the kids were in bed, it is great to finish a busy day with a good meal and limited clean up!)

Love that you can make this ahead.  Also love that you do not have to cook the noodles, this makes them VERY easy to fill than when they are cooked.  We liked this recipe a lot and will make it a lot.  The leftovers were even gone.

Not sure why the recipe calls for water, as mine came out kind of watery - otherwise was still good though, noodles cooked fine.

I made this for my boyfriend's birthday earlier this year and we both agreed..while it tasted ok and had definite potential, the amount of sauce was waaaaayyy too much. 2 jars literally overwhelmed the rest of the ingredients. The manicotti was swimming in a pool of spaghetti sauce. I'd like to give this recipe another try, but this time will cut back on the sauce by at least half. I might also add some spicy sausage to it as well.

I made this while pregnant, to have a nice homemade meal to look forward to after the baby came. Made it when my in-laws were visiting and they agreed that it was delicious - and everyone had a 2nd helping. I added a bit more sauce to the pan since I was using a large pan to freeze these in.

added hamburger and italian sausage! I always add a tablespoon of sugar to my sauce, to mellow the acidity of the tomato! Excellent!

I really liked this.. I made it twice, once as written and then a second time when I changed a few minor things: I used fresh onion and garlic in the Manicotti and then added some fresh basil to the sauce. Simply because we enjoy that extra flavors... the manicotti was still good as written. I used a ziplock bag with a hole in one corner to fill the shells.. it work great! I had a double recipe filled in 5 minutes flat. I also had about 1/4 cup of filling left, so I just added it into the sauce. Kinda fancy, but simple AND yummy... Definitely will be making this again!

The entire family loved it. The key was using a sauce you like. I used 1/2 Prego and 1/2 Newmans Yum!

I did a quick saute of garlic and spinach for more flavor. Spiced up the sauce with some of my own spices. This was a wonderful recipe and very easy to make.

This turned out really good. I was particularly interested in a recipe that used uncooked pasta because I hate stuffing cooked manicotti. I didn't refrigerate this overnight, so I cut back on the water by about 1/2 cup - and I did end up cooking it about 15 minutes longer than stated. Worked excellent. Thanks!

My vegetarian friend loved the meatless manicottis I made but I was left wanting more.  I would maybe season the filling a bit more.  I think it maybe needed some salt.

I have made this many times for my family.  It is also very good without meat in the sauce.  Sometimes I will add a little cayenne pepper to the cheese/spinach mixture to give it a little kick.

Hmm, I followed the recipe almost exactly, used onion flakes instead of powder.  Not sure what went wrong, my pasta shells were a bit on the tough side!  My daughter loved the flavor, but the shells were a bummer.  I really liked the idea of not having to boil them first!  I guess I'll try again.

This recipe turned out pretty good with a few adjustments.  1. I added about 3/4 lb spicy Italian style ground turkey (browned) to my sauce. The meat is AWESOME! I use that stuff in everything and always have a lb or so in my freezer. Where I'm from it's generally pretty cheap (on sale $2, $3 if not) and still healthier for you than sausage. 2. I cooked about half a shallot and some cloves of garlic in a little bit of butter and added them to the cheese mixture. 3. Used grated parmesan cheese instead of shredded because that's what I had! 4. Used Fat Free ricotta!!!  5. I used less water and more sauce.

I have never had luck without boiling the noddles for any pasta dish, so I made this by boiling the noodles ahead of time and stuffing them with the mixture.  I didn't mix the water in with the sauce-I just used lots of extra sauce in mine so it wouldn't be dry.  I let it sit at room temperature for about 30 minutes before baking at 375 for about 40 minutes and it was wonderful.

This recipe got rave reviews from my family and friends.  I made this for my daughter's first communion party.  We had about 25 people so I actually quadrupled the recipe. Ilayered the manicotti in a large lasagna roasting pan with sauce in between each layer.  To save time I stuffed the shells two days before and put them in a tupperware dish in the fridge.  The idea of piping in the filling with ziploc bag is genius.  I filled four boxes of manicotti in about 20 mins.  When I went to put everything together the manicotti was already soft but some had split down the middle.  I was a little nervous about this and in hind sight maybe I should have frozen them for just the few days.  But everything turned out great.  I used less sauce and water because the pasta was already soft.  I recommend using extra seasoning to add to the flavor of the sauce.  I used Prego sauce and added a little extra garlic, salt/pepper and oregano.  Also added about three pound of ground round. The only thing I should have accounted for was the longer cooking time.  We had to wait a little longer to eat after church because it wasn't quite heated through.  Overall, I would highly recommend this recipe.

Very good.  I made them only 4 hours ahead, so I baked them for about 1 hr. 5 min.  I also added salt, basil, and Italian seasoning to the filling.  I made the filling with part-skim ricotta and lo-fat mozzarella cheese. I stuffed them using a butter knife.

Really easy and very tasty.  A safe dish to make for people who really don't like ricotta cheese as the spinach seems to be the dominant flavor of the filling.  I agree with previous posts that you get lots of flavor from the sauce so pick one you like.
