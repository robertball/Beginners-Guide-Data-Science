Here's a GLUTEN-FREE version:  add a LOT of freshly grated parm or romano cheese to the egg mixture (so that it's thick enough to coat) and skip the breadcrumbs.  Go right to the saute pan with the egg-cheese dipped slices.  If you want to make it extra special, lay a slice of proscuitto (Italian Ham)on top of the ricotta cheese mixture before you roll it up!  Yum!

My husband described this dish to me as a childhood favorite of his; I recreated it by experimenting until I came up with something as rave-worthy as he remembered.  My recipe is almost identical to this one!  This recipe is delicious and worth the effort.

Tried this the other night.  I was going to make canelloni with eggplant parmesan put opted to give this a try.  It was wonderful!  I did make a few changes/additions.  The heavy cream was substituted with milk.  I used a canned spaghetti sauce for ease.  I used only 1 cup of mozzarella and added about 1 cup of chopped spinach.  Everyone devoured it!  The leftover ricotta was used to make a side dish of Ricotta Gnocci that I found in Allrecipes (these were great too). This dish looked very gourmet, was very tasty and I think I'd like to give it a try with some goat cheese next time.  (Just a quick note to say that we tried this with plain goat cheese and it was divine)

This is now one of my favorite, and my fiance's, italian style dishes.  I have made it twice in the past 3 weeks.  Perfect with pasta or by itself! Worth the work!

This recipe is excellent!  I did half the way it says and grilled half of my eggplant instead for a lighter version and it was wonderful too.

These were excellent! I didn't have quite enough mozz. cheese & I added in some romano cheese. I also used Prego instead of making their sauce, so I can't comment on the sauce. But the eggplant rolls were awesome!! ! Just make sure that you fry them until they are nice and tender and that you get them thin enough. I will definitely make these again!

This was great, allot of work, but worth it if you like eggplant.  I added more sauce and cheese on top.  I will make this again.

This was SO GOOD!!!!!!!!!!  I used 3 medium sized eggplant with the stated amount of everything else (bread crumbs, eggs, and filling).  I cheated and used 2 28 oz cans of Garlic & Herb prepared pasta sauce.  If you don't want your cheese to ooze out the sides then leave the mozzarella out of the ricotta mixture and sprinkle it over the top of the eggplant rolls.  I added more garlic and onion powder to my ricotta, just because.  It was phenomenal!!!  Thanks!

We thought this was pretty good. Something seemed to be missing though & it was kind of heavy. I might try grilling it next time. It was very easy to make though & we had fun putting it together. Thanks for sharing this recipe.

Very tasty!  I followed the advice of another poster and made this into a layers like lasagna instead of rolling up the eggplant.  I also added a can of roasted red peppers since I had that laying around.  Also, I used 6 cloves of garlic instead of the amount in the recipe.  I'd definitely make it again, but try and lighten the fat by omitting the oil used for frying the eggplant and baking the eggplant instead after spraying it with some PAM.  My husband hates eating vegetarian meals but loved this one!

This was fantastic! Only thing I did differently was use cheddar cheese instead of mozzarella. It was what I had in the fridge at the time. I will be making this one again. Only thing I'll change for the next time will be reducing the amount of bread crumbs and flour by half.

the dish was easy to make, like another cook, I used seasoned bread crumbs. I also used a can of stewed tomato's didn't have the other, turned out very good. The only thing I will do different next time is peel the eggplant our skin seemed chewy. My husband says we can make this again.

Wonderful! The family loved it! It's also perfectly acceptable to omit the parsley if you don't like it.

Great dish!  Made it lower in fat by skipping the milk, using low fat cheese and broiling the eggplant w/o egg and breadcrumbs (just brushed eggplant with olive oil and Italian seasonings).  Served over low carb angel hair pasta.

This tastes like my Italian grandmother taught me how to make it with love, and I don't even have an Italian grandmother!

This is a good make-ahead dish, and well worth it if you have the time.

We thought this was very good.  I did use a jar of Bartolli's Five Cheese sauce and breaded the eggplant with Garlic & Herb Bread crumbs.  Thank you for this submission!

Excellent. I used Hunt's vegetable spaghetti sauce with a can of diced tomatoes for the sauce. I also used Italian-seasoned bread crumbs with the flour. So tender and delicious.

Tough to make but it tasted pretty good. I made it as a gluten free option and it worked well for that purpose.

I made a few adaptations- basil instead of parsley, jar of tomato sauce (didn't have time to make sauce from scratch), and flour & Italian spice instead of breadcrumbs. It still came out great. Glad I had some fresh mozzarella to melt on top.

I followed the recipe to the letter. This was absolutely fantastic. My husband had this at a fancy Italian restaurant and loved it. This was my first attempt at this dish and I used our garden eggplant. He said it was far superior than what he was previously served. Thank you!! (The leftovers were excellent too)

Delicious.  I used finely chopped broccoli florets (no stalks at all) instead of parsley, which was good.

Good.  Felt like a lot of work but it made 2 dishes worth and I slipped one in the freezer.

this was fun to prep and absolutely delicious! I used a jar of sauce, and milk rather than cream. I think I'll try the broiler to precook the eggplant next time. My family says it's a winner!

Living the low carb lifestyle-this is our lasagna replacement!  The sauce is easy and far superior to jar sauce.  Based on other reviewers notes, I also baked the zucchini slices in the ove for a few minutes till softened-basted with olive oil and some Italian seasoning.  Also added some chopped, uncooked fresh spinach to the cheese mixture, and finally topped with some extra Parmesan cheese before baking uncovered in the oven.  Superb recipeM
