I grew up in Northeastern Ohio, and always loved sauerkraut balls, especially the ones I had in the bars when I was at Kent State University. I made these for a small Super Bowl party. We dunked in either Thousand Island salad dressing or horseradish sauce. I also served Reuben sandwiches and beer. What a great combo! I only wish I'd invited more guests, because we all ate too much!  My husband, also a KSU alum, LOVED these. Our guests (not from Ohio) thought they were delicious. I followed this recipe to the letter, and it worked perfectly. I must say, it was helpful having one of my guests helping. She rolled the balls; I dipped and tended the fryer. Do not be tempted to make the balls bigger to speed up the process. With the batter they just get too big for the finger food they should be. Thanks to NC State Trooper for bringing me a taste of home!

This is a great recipe. You simply can't argue with "law."  Try it soon!  Great for football
tv party mobs, or a comforting fall favorite.  We
will serve this often.  (My nephew, 8, gobbled them up.)  Partners great with cold beer. I also
omitted the parsley and added caraway

I grew up in Cleveland area too and didn't realize that sauerkraut balls were really just known up there until telling a few friends that I hadn't them in years...of course I got the "what is a sauerkraut ball??"
Made these for them and now they too are sold on them. Dipped them in 1000 island dressing and they were calling them little ruben balls.  Thanks for a great and easy recipe!
P.S. To save time, I skip the batter part and just roll each ball in egg and then dip in italian bread crumbs. Still just as yummy without all the mess.

The references to Northeast Ohio are perfect ~ since I'm also from there.  This is a very good recipe.  I would caution you that it will take longer than the receipe says.  They are a "Labor of Love".  But you will never find a frozen sauerkraut ball as good.  My regular recipe adds a bit more breadcrumb into the "ball".  It gives it a bit more texture.  If you have never tried these, you really should.  Each person that has moved here and tries them becomes a lifetime fan.

Northeast Ohio here.  Lyndhurst, Chesterland, Kent State.  First had them in the 60's at a restaurant out on the way to Newbury.  I didn't know they were local until I, too, found this recipe.  Thanks a million. yum yum yummy yum yum!  PS live in TX Hill Country now.  None down here even with all the German restaurants. Go figure.

I'm another Ohio native that found himself missing these when I moved to Missouri. This is the best recipe I have tried. 
My dipping sauce (Horseradish Parsley Russian dressing)
1/2 c. Miracle whip
3 Tbls. Ketchup
2 Tbls. Sweet pickle relish
1 Tbls. Prepared horseradish
Chopped parsley leaves

I also use this dressing on my Reuben sandwiches with Dubliner cheese instead of Swiss.

Outstanding!  I skipped the batter as one reviewer suggested and did a traditional flour coating, egg dip, and toss in Panko crumbs.  Served them at a ladies Book Club and everyone gave a big thumbs up!  A bit labor intensive, but I made a batch and froze them ahead of time and that did the trick to save last minute prep.  Oh, and I also served them with a side of Thousand Island dressing as one reviewer suggested - super yummy!  Being a CA native, I had never heard of anything like these (nor my friends or family) and so now I am a big hit with the party crowd!  It's my understanding that these are common in Ohio - so Hail to the Midwest for another crowd pleaser!

Very Good!  I've made these twice and they are a big hit!  2 comments, allow more time to prepare at the end, I find it takes about an hour to make the balls, dip them, and fry them.  Secondly, there is too much batter left over.  I cut the milk and flour by 1/3 and still have plenty.

I have been searching for a sauerkraut ball recipe like the ones you can by everywhere in Cleveland OH, my hometown. Yours is the BEST !
Even better than the ones I remember, same idea, but much more flavor. And trust me, I tried several.

I am from Ohio and now live in Tucson, AZ.  I have been missing Kraut Balls for years and have tried other recipes to no avail.  This one is PERFECT! Just like I remember back home.  Thank you for sharing it NC State Trooper.  We served them at our own little Oktoberfest that we hold since the local one here has mostly Mexican and some Irish food with only one Marzen beer.  They were a hit!

Ok, you know a recipe has to be good when unsuspecting and picky 4 year olds gobble them up. They had no idea they were eating sauerkraut and I'm not tellin'. Great use for leftover ham and wonderful with a good German beer.

YUM! We had ham and roast beef leftovers from Christmas dinner so I used them finely chopped up since we didn't have corned beef.  I also used chicken stock instead of the beef broth but it still  Turned out yummy! My 3 year old who is a picky eater loves them! She can't even tell there's sauerkraut in it (which the rest of the family loves). well definitely be making this again!

Hmmmm....followed the recipe exactly, fried up a few and found them lacking a taste I wanted, so added 1/4 c grated Parmesan to the rest (everything's better with cheese, right?) - an improvement, but still just ok; then added some crumbled crisp bacon (bacon is always an improvement) - no help. I tried several of the suggestions offered here - batter, no batter, seasoned/cheese breadcrumbs instead of plain....they were just ok to me and mine. Lots of work and lots of calories for a so-so appetizer. It's probably just a personal taste thing. Sorry!

This brought back memories of growing up in Cleveland!  I reduced the amount f flour because I cheese-cloth drained the sauerkraut (that I brought back from Bavaria!).  I added ground pepper, too. Perfect!

Great sauerkraut balls!!! I've made this exact recipe several times, this time I used panko breadcrumbs because that was all I had. I wasn't sure how they would turn out but they were great, everyone loved them.

These turned out Great! I actually made one of the "Sauerkraut Salad" recipes and used the leftovers for this recipe. I also used some leftover ham and ground beef. I omitted the parsley and caraway seed, as the salad was already flavored. I ended up making mine into the size of golfballs and there were 36. I had a little bit of batter left and used plenty of bread crumbs to make these manageable. If you have a deep fryer with a basket, coating them thoroughly keeps them from sticking to the basket. Thanks for sharing!

I didn't realize this was an Ohio thing either! haha

I've made several variations of these as the basic recipe is very adaptable. Ground ham and ground sausage are what made me look this recipe up again. I prefer to bake these at 375 for 20 minutes.

Try adding a bit of cream cheese to the mix to help it stick together. I don't use the full 1/2 c of broth either(Jalapenos never hurt anything either.)

I made these for Christmas and everyone  loved them. The recipe is time consuming,  but maybe the next time i will make the mixture and shape the balls the day before. I had to pour the batter onto a plate and gently roll the ball around,  as they are delicate and break apart when dipping into a bowl. Great flavor,  thanks for sharing!

Absolutly loved it! The only change I made was to add salt, pepper, basil and cayanne pepper to the batter. But they were a hit and everyone loved them. Thank you for sharing this recipe.

It may have been something on my end - but the final product wasn't all that appealing or tasty. A bit too much fried batter and not enough kraut flavor for me.

Substituted the ham for a little chopped, cooked bacon and a little swiss cheese, then I shaped them into more of an oval, (like a croquet, to make them easier to handle) and served them with a remoulade dipping sauce.  Everyone LOVED them.  They were gone in moments.

All of my co-workers and I agreed: much better served chilled the next day instead of warm.
