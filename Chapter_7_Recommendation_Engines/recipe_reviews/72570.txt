Pretty good, but mine came out super greasy...and that was after using peppers packed in water instead of oil!  Next time I'd cook the bacon separate from the chicken so that it could crisp better, cut the olive oil down to about 2 t (using 1 t for the onions & garlic, 1 t in with the peppers), and add in some extra garlic and red pepper flakes to give it a boost.  I'd also go with rotini or ridged penne instead of plain fettuccine, so that the sauce would stick better to the noodles - mine slid right off.  Tasty overall, but a few minor tweaks made it even better.

I left out the peas because... well I don't like peas!  Very tasty recipe, but I found it difficult to get the bacon to crisp in the same pan as the chicken and had to remove it and fry it in a separate pan.

This recipe was easy to make and very good.  We changed it a bit by serving it over bow tie pasta.  I thought it was a little bland (this may have been the peppers I used) so next time I'll kick it up with some red curry or cayenne pepper

This was an easy dinner to put together. Though I did make some changes, rather than oil packed red peppers, I used fresh and roasted them myself, a much better flavor than oil packed and I used fresh cream. Really very nice! Thanks for the recipe!

This was pretty good. Husband and I both agreed that it needed a lot more garlic. I was worried about the peas, but they fit the dish fine. I agree with PP who said that it's hard to crisp the bacon with chicken in pan. 
I served it over whole wheat couscous.
I'll make it again, next time with more garlic and probably cream, then it will be able to hold its own enough to go over pasta.

Awesome, EASY, and an overall excellent choice!  I made this last night and my boyfriend and I loved it!  I substituted garlic powder for fresh garlic and used equal parts of sour cream and half and half.  Also, I added salt and pepper to taste and let the completed sauce simmer as recommended (about 10 min).  Will definitely make this one again!

we thought this recipe was wonderful. we substituted cream for the evaporated milk ( we like it fatty). we also used the red peppers packed in water. at the end we topped it off with parmesan cheese. i have added this to my regular cook book! thanks.

This was nice.  Needed a little extra seasoning and some time to simmer on the stove.  Thanks for sharing, I'm always looking for new things to do with roasted red peppers.

I would have given this 4 1/2 stars but decided to give 5 stars because it is a wonderful recipe as is or for adapting to personal tastes.  Cook the bacon (I used regular pork bacon) separately, add pepper flakes or cayenne to taste, and no need to heat the red pepper cream sauce ingredients if the red peppers are packed in water...just blend with the sour cream & milk and then add to chicken mixture.  Suggest only browning the chicken pieces before adding everything else so that the mixture can simmer for at least 30 minutes and not overcook the chicken.  Very flavorful!  Thanks for this recipe.

I was very disappointed with this recipe.  It wasn't that it tasted bad.  It was just incredibly bland and boring.  Even my husband, who LOVES bland food, wasn't crazy about this one - mainly because of the bacon.  I may try to make this dish again, but will try to figure out some way to spice things up.

This was tasty, but with some modifications as other reviewers have stated. Definitely needs salt, pepper, crushed red pepper, garlic powder and cheese (I used Asiago). I also used red peppers in water as opposed to oil. After blending, I added the sauce back to the pan to simmer and thicken. I'll make this again! See my photo!

I was really excited to make this.  It looked like a lower fat/cal version of a red pepper sauce we just love, but like many others the result was very bland and uninteresting.  I also used red peppers in water and added garlic salt, smoked paprika, and cumin.  In the end we dosed it with hot sauce.

This dish was fantastic. I did modify a bit and add extra spice. I doubled the garlic, added salt and pepper, i also used real bacon rather than turkey bacon. For the peppers i sauteed two large red peppers which i had cut into strips after removing seeds and pith. I doubled the peas. Instead if the evaporated milk i used ahalf and Half.  If you like a kick also add red pepper flakes to taste. Served with Farro but any pasta or rice would work. Yum yum!

I served this over pasta and it was perfect. The kids even ate it.
