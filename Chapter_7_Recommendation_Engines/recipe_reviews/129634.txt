Creamy, rich, and delicious - this is chocolate heaven! It's so easy and yet tastes like you spent hours. What more could you ask for! It literally takes like a chocolate mousse cheesecake without all the hassle. Instead of making the oreo cookie crust, I bought a pre-made 9 inch round oreo cookie crust. I topped it with whipped cream and a dusting of cocoa powder. I took this to my neighbor's house for a dinner party and it was gone in no time at all!

These are great!  The only thing I would do differently is not line the pan with foil.  When I tried to take it out it was stuck pretty good and ended up picking peices of it off!  Also I think I would just refridgerate next time instead of freeze, or not as long if I do freeze them.

These were very tasty. I was unsure at first because I didn't love the batter, but they taste great once they are frozen and very cold. I used homemade whipped cream in place of cool whip because I didn't have any. Overall they were pretty good, but they retain a bit of the sweet condensed milk taste, I can pick that ingredient out when I bite into these. My family who loves sweets just picked at this and I ended up tossing half of it away. The picture makes it looks delicious.

This has more of a cheesecake texture than a mousse, but it's very good. I put the cookies in a ziploc bag and crushed them with a rolling pin. Next time I'll use more cookies than the recipe called for because some of the crumbs got stuck in the bag with the cookie filling. I was too lazy to make more crust, so I just went with it. I didn't have a full 6 hours to freeze it, but it was fine when I took it out after 4. Lining the pan with foil makes it so easy to take the mousse out to cut. This is a good summer dessert.

Thanx RJR, you were right it is delicious. I subbed graham crumbs for oreo crumbs, that brought out the flavor of the other ingredients very well. Will make this again with chopped up caramilk bars instead of bakers chocolate.

This was easy and great.  I used fat free sweetened condensed milk, low fat creat cheese and lite cool whip.  I also made in a 9x11 pan which I did not line with tinfoil.  If you spray the pan with Pam, it comes out great.  I used 16 OREO's and could've used more.  I froze then took out 30 minutes before I cut.  I stored in fridge after I served and I like it better not frozen.

This tastes just as good lightened up, with low-fat or fat free cream cheese, fat free condensed milk and fat free Cool-Whip. My husband is a dessert snob and he can't tell the difference. NOTE: You can get away with using unsweetened chocolate or sugar free chocolate chips as well. I buy the sugar free chocolate chips in bulk from WinCo.

Very good dessert.  It's like a no-bake chocolate cheesecake.  It is hard to cut when just taken out of the freezer.  I suggest taking it out 30 minutes before you want to eat it.

This was a perfect after dinner dessert. It is light and doesn't overwhelm you with either size or over chocolate-iness. Very good.

Excellent. Yes, it does definitely have a cheesecake quality to it, but it is so rich and delicious. I froze it initially but then just stored it in the fridge and it held up fine. I made it in a 9 inch spring-form pan. I also doubled the crust on the bottom.

This is my favorite no bake desserts. It is creamy and rich.  I sometimes top mine with chocolate chips.
