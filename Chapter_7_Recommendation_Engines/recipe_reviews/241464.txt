Delicious! Very similar to my buffalo sauce recipe, aside from using the celery seed, which I thought was a nice addition, and I added more garlic powder than called for...very tasty! I would make this again, for sure~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

This was excellent and will be my go to for wing sauce!  Perfect as it, but I did add a little onion powder & red pepper flakes.

This is better than restaurant sauce and very easy to make. Its hotness depends on the pepper sauce used. Normally I’d use Colula since we live in Arizona. The most recent creation was made with Tapatio which is hotter than hell! Regardless it’s great.

Chef John, once again, thank you so very much for the perfect Buffalo wings sauce. My family inhaled these wings which I served with your recipe for onion rings along with blue cheese dressing with carrot and celery sticks. My family said they were better than any restaurant wings they ever ate. Two thumbs up. You have become my go to

I tried this recipe because I saw the base was the same as I read from a bottle of Louisiana Hot sauce about 20 years ago. It tasted good then and does now.

This time I didn't have any Franks Red Hot, but a cheap store brand, so I needed extra spice to make up the difference.
I've gotta say, I liked the celery seed! I never would have thought of that. I used celery salt since that was what I had.
I also added a few dashes of Worcestershire sauce.

This was delicious on some frozen chicken nuggets with blue cheese dressing drizzled on top.  (fastest appetizer on the planet! (15 minutes))

If you like it real hot, add some cayenne pepper, otherwise this is a nice mild mix. 

Thanks for submitting John!

LOVED the addition of celery salt. I ground it in a mortar & pestle with 1/8 t. course black pepper and it gave the wings such a savory kick!
