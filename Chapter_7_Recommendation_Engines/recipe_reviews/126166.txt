We enjoyed this recipe and will make it again. It needed a little more ginger and more pepper for our taste but that's an easy adjustment.

my family loved it! and it was so quick and easy. the sauce is a little on the thin side but the flavor totally makes up for it. I'll be making this one again for sure.

Way too much Garlice totally overpowers everything else. I also prefer a thicker sauce. It's an O.k. non-sweet gingerbeer, but there are much better recipes out there.
