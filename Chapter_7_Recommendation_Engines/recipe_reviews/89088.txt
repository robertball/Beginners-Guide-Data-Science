Loved it!  
I added scallions and an extra jalepeno, and next time I might skip the olives.

This is very similar to the cheese dip I have been making.  People were amazed at the ingredients only being 4 items... But.. it went perfect with Ritz crackers to (top it off)....

I usually use the bagged-grated (moz, cheedar,jack) type cheeses.  I then used onion, mayo and canned jalepeno per taste.  I never baked it.  Left it in the refrigerator for several hours to let the mixture blend.  I took it to school the next day in a bowl and serve it with Ritz crackers..  its delicious!!!When I served it ...within 1.5hrs ..it was gone.  Thats about the fastest recipe to disappear I have made in my 12years.  I'll try to bake it next time..interesting.  thanks for sharing.

The flavor was pretty good, but I thought the garlic salt on top of the garlic was a little overkill. I would cut the garlic salt next time. But the thing that ruined it for me was that after it sat for a few minutes, the liquid grease pooled on top of the cheese...a lot of it. Even after I tried pouring it off it was still there, and every time I took a bite it was greasy. I don't know if substituting cream cheese for mayo would help, or using a non-fat mayo, but I wouldn't make the recipe as is again.

I have to give this 5 stars because it was so easy to make and everyone loved it. I did omit the olives because most in our family don't like them and it was still great.

This was pretty good.  My husband loved it.  It took longer than 20 minutes for the edges to turn golden.  The dip wasn't as smooth as I was expecting.  Next time I will try leaving it in the oven longer.  Overall it had a good flavor.  It was quick and easy too.

I added tomatoes to add a color and taste and did diced green peppers rather than jalapenos.  Excellent, but one word of caution: I attempted to make this a one-pot deal.  NO CAN DO!  You must SHRED the mozzarella and bake as directed.  If you do like I did, the melting will be uneven, and you will eventually cook the water out of the mozzarella and end up with one big cheese lump surrounded by water and mayo mixture.  Overall, taste superb, but presentation severely lacking due only to my not following the directions by trying to simmer it.

Excellent...made as is with the ONLY exception being didn't have enough mayo on hand to equal a whole cup so I used 1/4 cup mayo, 1/4 cup cream cheese and 1/2 cup sour cream...used 4 whole fresh jalapenos as we love hot stuff and left out the garlic salt at the suggestion of others.  Tasted awesome! Hubby loved it and snarfed it down :)

Tasted great but the texture was weird. You could hardly scoop it with a chip - which is a problem in my books!

I loved this the first time I made it, but the second time I omitted the olives and and 3/4 cooked bacon and my friends and me both thought it was better.  Everything is better with bacon!

I have to admit, I didn't stay completely to the recipe. I omitted the mayo because we love the taste of cream cheese and omitted the mozzarella and used only cheddar because it was all we had.  We also didn't have fresh garlic, and substituted granulated garlic powder. Fresh garlic would have made this much better, but the dip turned out great! Gone in and hour.  It is definitely better warm, and with stood two warm-ups. I blended the cream cheese with the garlic powder and diced jalapenos (I used 3 for extra flavor).  It was creamy and not overly spicey.  Used Ritz crackers, it was a hit, will definitely make again, just with fresh garlic.

It wasn't too bad - but I think I'm going to doctor it up a bit if I make it again. It need a little something more.

I made this for my mom's birthday. I used monterrey jack cheese and 5 jalapenos because we like spicy. I mixed 3 of the jalapenos within the cheese mixture and sprinkled the other two on top. I also added a white onion and tomato. I baked it in a ceramic dish for about 35 minutes because at 25 minutes the center of the dip was not melted enough. It tasted better than I thought it would. I will absolutely make this again.

I've made this three times and everyone has been asking me for the recipe.  I made it for my last party and it was gone in no time.  I added a little chopped onion just for my own taste.  Thanks for the recipe.

I made this exactly as outlined.  Wrapped it up and took it to a small dinner party.  Upon serving, it was solid, and hard to manipulate, the garlic was strong (and i love garlic).  It was ok reheated but the texture was like a sting cheese stick.  Crowd pleaser, not this time around.  Perhaps I'll try it again.

Very good!  However I don't think the garlic salt on top is necessary - it's a little too much.  I will omit that next time and put tomato & green onion on after baking.  Yum.

I made it with half mayo and half sour cream. I also doubled the amount of jalepenos. It was too spicy for me but Husband loved it. Next time I'll omit the olives and add some green onion instead. Not bad. Thanks!

This was REALLY great!  It was super easy to make and cheap too!  I used two cans of hot diced chiles instead of jalapenos.  I hate olives so omitted them and added some tomatoes instead for some color.  It was super yummy!

This was fantastic, not messy and easy to make.  The flavor was wonderful.  It sets some and his easy to spoon or slice to put on crakers, bread, or even roasted jalapeno peppers.  At any rate, I am making this ahead, letting it sit in the fridge and then making Stuffed Chili Relanos with the left overs.  I plan to stuff the Poblano Peppers fresh and then bake.  Im hoping that it will be a big winner too. Thanks for the recipie.

LOVED this recipe - I made it for a Policeman's picknic and they gobbled it up. Wish the cheese would have been a little more "melty" - but overall was great.

This was pretty good, but I think it would be better with some cream cheese or something to make it creamier - will try that next time.

I made this for our Thanksgiving dinner and the guests who tried it really liked it.  Our only dislike was the saltiness from the teaspoon of garlic salt.  It was too much salt. I will definitely be making this again but will omit half the garlic salt.  Thanks for the recipe!

I loved this recipe except I'm not an olive fan so I substituted olives for finely chopped red pepper.  It gave added colour and really enhanced the peppery flavor.  I also didn't use canned jalepenos, but I did have a jar in the fridge so I used some of the juice to up the spicy factor.  Fresh jaleps all the way!

LOVED IT!!!!  so easy and goes so fast.... We usually make 4 different batches when we have parties over here...I never add black olives, since I don't like them, but it still turns out great...

This was really good! Mixed it all up the night before and it was a BIG hit for the superbowl party. I did add about 3TB cream cheese cause I had some I wanted to use up. Doubled the jalapenos and used jalapeno olives cause we like things hot. Added a few shakes of cumin, onion powder and seasoned salt. Used reduced fat everything and it still tasted sinfully rich and delicious.

My family loves nachos so thought I would try this recipe as something different for a change.  It was not only bad but incredibly bad.  Even with the jalepenos it had absolutely no hotness to it.  The black olives did not add a positive taste and the texture of this dip was not smooth.  I made the recipe exactly as printed but we all decided this recipe is not a keeper.  We threw most of it away.
