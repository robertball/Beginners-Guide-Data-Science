It was a super easy, quick dish that tasted fantastic. I have it twice. The first time with egg noodles, and the second time I took another reviwer's suggestion and made it with wagon wheel noodles, which was the only pasta I had in the pantry at the time. Both ways turned out great. This is also a very kid friendly dish and is a nice alternative to the typical mac and cheese, which I can get burned out on.

This recipe does not have to be made with egg noodles. Rigatoni, shells, even wagon wheel noodles are all equally delicious with it. I use whatever I have on hand. This dish is also yummy leftover, but some of the cottage cheese will soak or melt into the noodles so I like to add an additional scoop of cottage cheese in when I reheat the leftovers.

When I was a little girl, my (full-blooded Italian!) aunt introduced me to spaghetti w/ cottage cheese. I think that's all she put in it too; literally, pasta & cottage cheese (with a splash of the pasta water.) 

Years later, when I had a child of my own, I started making this for her (now adding butter/onion to give it more flavor.) Both ways -- just pasta/cottage cheese -- and then with the butter/onion -- were awesome (...but anything with some butta' is betta', ya know??)

I forgot ALL about this "dish" then til recently when I was trying to use up leftover sour cream from Thanksgiving. And after doing a "google search" for ingredients, I fell upon this recipe ... making it yet again (now for TWO kids) :) - & with the sour cream this time, too.

Wow! Loved it even MORE (and didn't think that was possible?!) I mean, you can't go wrong with the simple, basic versions -- but that blob of sour cream really adds somethin'. It helped everything come together as a 'sauce' almost, instead of just cheese curds & noodles. (I think this is what kept the picky-eatin' kid from realizing this was anything BUT "white mac 'n cheese." I know, I know ... it was a stretch, but he's 5 so he bought it). Yes! Win-win! 

Try it! I'm serious! It's not just for "cottage cheese-eaters." When warmed up ... and with the other ingredients ... the C.C. loses the texture/viscosity & appearance that some people can't seem to get into. I can see why "Lazy Man's Pierogies" are a great title for this one!

Made this for lunch today and I must say, I like this so much better than mac and cheese! I just loved, loved, loved the flavor from the onion. It was one of the easiest recipes to make and made more than enough (I have leftovers so I have lunches for a couples of days.)

I loved this recipe! I only made a couple changes. I added some garlic when I was sauteeing the onion.  Then, because my pasta wasn't done yet, I thought I would add my cottage cheese to the onion in the skillet just to heat it up. Then, to my surprise, the cottage cheese melted into a smooth, creamy, cheesy sauce. Yum! I can't wait to try this again and add some sharp cheddar to make it more like macaroni and cheese and see what that's like. I also love the nutrition you get from all the protein in the cottage cheese! This is a keeper!

My mom showed me how to make this years ago. But we do not use sour cream, or cottage cheese. We use Cream cheese and butter no onion either.   Try this one, you just might like it.

Delicious and super duper simple! I loved the flvor you got from the sauteed onions and the sour cream almost forms a light sauce over the noodles. This was great leftover, but I did add an additional scoop of cottage cheese into the mixture when I reheated it because a lot of it had soaked into the noodles after 2 days in the fridge (but the flavor was awesome after sitting in the fridge.)

I'm so GLAD you posted this, it was my favorite dish growing up....I always assumed it had it's roots in Polish heritage because all my grandparents migrated over, but I wasn't sure..... 

My mom made it without the sour cream.  Next time I make the dish, I'll have to try adding it.  There's nothing like this recipe to bring back fond memories  of my childhood, or giving myself a hug and imagining my mom and dad were still here.

Absolutely love this dish! This has been a staple in my family since I was a little girl spending summers at my grandparents' cottage! I always get weird looks when I talk about it/make it, but usually they fade once they try it!  We have never added sour cream.  I tried it after reading this recipe and definitely prefer it without!  The whey and semi-melted cottage cheese make it creamy enough!

It's very versatile...I've heard of adding bacon or shredded cabbage to it, too! And no measurements needed!

(Edit:  I've since added cabbage and omitted the cottage cheese and it was great--I just sauteed the cabbage with the noodles!)

I used red onion and the flavor was great! This was very simple to make, very tasty, and better for you than mac and cheese, since I used low fat cottage cheese, light butter, fat free sour cream, and whole wheat noodles.

I absolutely love this dish!!!  I originally got this from a lady years ago who just told me how to assemble it...no recipe per se.  So I was tickled to see an actual recipe with measurements and to learn of its origin.  I usually do not add the onion and it still taste great.  I like to serve it over grilled or skillet hamburger steak. 9-7-18

POLISH COMFORT FOOD! Made this for dinner tonight and my picky kids loved it. Grew up eating this weekly with my Polish/Russian Mom and my Irish Dad loved it, too. Works great with the heartier "Kluski" noodles or even frozen Reames egg noodles. We like it with the onion REALLY cooked -- golden brown or darker. YUM.

My family is Slovak and my Mom has made this as far back as I can remember, featuring it as the main dish with sauteed Kielbasa with cabbage and sauerkraut on the side.  I've been making it as well and plan to make it in a couple days.  My wife is Central American and she loves it! It truly is great comfort food.   My twist?  I slice about a dozen white mushrooms and saute them in the butter and onions.

I decided to make this for my nephew instead of box mac and cheese that he loves oh so much, and it was a hit! Both he and I loved it and each had a second serving. I did cut back the calories by using the light butter, fat free sour cream, fat free cottage cheese, and whole wheat noodles, like another reviewer suggested. It was still delicious!

Very good! Been making these noodles for many years and my Mom made them when I was a kid. 
Normally do not put onion in because we like it more of a dessert type of dish. I mix some fine sugar with blueberries and toss with the noodles.

This recipe leaves out the bacon, which is an important part for many reasons. Cut a package of bacon into 1 inch pieces and then use the bacon grease to fry the onions. The egg noodles are a must because they are lighter than wheat pasta noodles. The true Eastern European dish uses egg noodles. My Polish grandmother used to make this regularly for us growing up. Cottage cheese was always added individually to your own plate. The sauteed onions were mixed in with the egg noodles and depending on how much bacon she had, it was either mixed in or on the table in a bowl to add yourself with the cottage cheese. Be sure to buy a large container of cottage cheese, or 2 smaller ones because you want a good amount (at least 1/2 cup) on top of your noodles.

My grandmother was Hungarian and we all grew up on something very similar.  No sour cream in it but it had bacon and we simply call it noodles, bacon and cottage cheese.  It is a favorite in our family and with all our friends and now all the grandkids.  My brother is a paramedic and they make it at the station for the whole gang all the time (they used to buy all the ingredients and show up at my house in the ambulance to drop them off saying they would be back shortly to pick it up LOL!)

Been making this for decades after learning from my Polish grandmother. Simple and delicious. The trick is high quality kluski (egg noodles). Skip the caloric sour cream as it is not needed but does enhance this dish. I've made this several hundred times.

This is a great comfort food. I grew up eating cottage cheese in many different ways, but never quite like this.

I changed a few things. I had some home grown oyster mushrooms that I need to use. I sauteed them along with the onions. I added a bit of extra salt during that process and I used garlic salt instead of regular salt later on.

My husband is part Polish, and this recipe is very close to what his grandmother made.  I often start mine by crisping up some bacon, and then sauteing a little green cabbage in with it before adding the other ingredients.  Delicious!

Great recipe. My grandmother and mother made these but with homemade noodle dough and they were stuffed with the cottage cheese mixture. My mother called it schneidaluva  but I found it online under Maul Dausha. My mother said her grandmother made them with fruit or jelly filling so she may have called those schneidaluva and my mom generalized it lol.

This is very similar to a famous dish my grandma always made us growing up. Except she would make it with whatever noodle ( egg or not) that you choose. Use dry curd cottage cheese, with some sautéed onions and butter, mix together and sprinkle with some celery salt!

My family loves this dish!  Simple comfort food.  We made it as written a few times and then decided to add 8 oz sliced mushrooms and 2 c shredded cabbage, since those are often pierogi fillings, when sauteing the onions.  Delicious!

My father used to make this for lunch, when I was a little girl, 1940’s, with any extra cooked noodles that were left over.  First he would cut several slices of bread into cubes, cut onion slices, & using a glob of butter (we made our own, so it was on the stove in a bowl), and essentially, made bread croutons while the onion cooked.  Then, putting the croutons on his plate, he stirred the noodles into the butter mixture to warm them, finally added some cottage cheese into it, & it was done!!  My brothers hated cottage cheese, but I usually got at least a couple of bites!  YUM!  I’m in my mid-70’s now, but thanks for the memories.

This recipe could not have been easier!  Great taste!  I added 1 teaspoon fresh minced garlic (because we like the taste) and 1/2 cup of the hot water the noodles cooked in to the finish product.  The water helps keep the noodles from  sticking together and becoming hard.  This recipe will become a staple in our home.

I am of  Hungarian descent and grew up eating this dish a lot which I still make today.  I do not use sour cream, nor the onion.  Instead I fry bacon until crisp then crumble up the bacon and to the pasta and cottage cheese mixture.  I  also add the leftover bacon grease and mix it in.  Fantastic!

I made this EXACTLY as the recipe called for, with just a little less noodles, to make it really creamy.  I used Irish Butter—Kerrygold I think.    My grandfather —my Dido—used to make this when I was a kid!   And I’ve been looking for a recipe like this for 20+ years!    Only thing he did was make dumplings.....  I mixed two types of pasta-just to get rid of them —you can use anything—but it was FABULOUS!!!   If you have any Slovak, Hungarian or Polish blood in you,  you have to try this!!    For 15 minutes, I was a kid again.....it was that good!    Thank you!

I made it nearly as written, but the bag of  noodles was only 12 ounces so I did not measure exactly. I added some mushrooms to the butter when browning the onions.  My husband and I both enjoyed it. It was still good the next day.

We tried these and while I didn't feel like it was good just solo (made it with some broccoli on the side) it is a yummy pasta dish and I think I'll make it for my next round of foster kids to replace mac and cheese!

This is our new pasta go to , quick and delicious dinner paired with a salad. Lighter than actual perogies, but every bit as tasty. The sour cream and onion makes it perfect. In a pinch dehydrated onion makes it just as good as fresh. I love this recipe just as it is!  We used whole milk organic cottage cheese that has cream on the top, WOW!

Very nice recipe.  Stuck to the script & had it with burgers as a side.  Can't wait to heat up some leftovers for a snack today.  Everyone was happy, we never had anything similar to this before.  Will make again.  Seems very adaptable for some other ingredient additions.  Get creative.

This is the same recipe my Hungarian grandmother made with her homemade noodles and we all loved it!  However, we browned the butter which adds a nutty-like flavor.  Don't even think about calories or cholestoral.

I grew up eating something very similar to this recipe except we used elbow macaroni and cottage cheese. No sour cream. Try it both ways and see how you like it. Our daughter calls it her comfort food and BTW, it goes well with fish. Great Lenten side dish.

I've made this for many years.  We call it lazy pierogi.  I've never tried it with the sour cream and we bake my version in the oven at 350 degrees for about 20-30 minutes.  Do not over bake or it will come out dry.

This is an Americanized version of the original dish.  My Polish mom made her own dumplings (Kluski), used bacon & a little bacon drippings & onions, then mixed everything together w/the dumplings & crumbled 'Farmers Cheese', not Cottage Cheese.

Usually a picky eater, my husband loved it with sliced beets and green beans on the side. I added dried parsley in place of pepper because I can't eat pepper. My grandma used to make this and I thought she had just made it up. I was delighted to find the recipe online. The next time I make it I will add a few edamame beans for fiber and extra protein.

Definitely a simple, quick, and easy-to-make comfort food, although I replaced greek yogurt for the sour cream.  And for me it seems that cottage cheese goes with everything! :)

Made exactly as written. Had a pleasant mild onion flavor but was otherwise kinda bland and too one note for a main dish. Also wasn’t as creamy as I’d hoped.  Might use for a side dish sometime. Thanks for the recipe!

I made as listed. We found them dry and bland. Used leftovers to make one of our favs... cabbage & noodles, with ground beef. Probably won't make again.

Easy and delicious. I used Ricotta cheese and regular macaroni noodles. Our family always called this dish, "Mamalegga" (Italian version)

Loved the simplicity. I made it for a crowd. Three 12 oz bags of egg noodles, 2-24oz containers small curd cottage cheese, 1-16 oz container sour cream, 1 cup diced onion, 2 sticks of butter and salt and pepper to taste. Cooked the noodles for 5 minutes. In a separate pan, I cooked the butter and onions then added the sour cream and cottage cheese. I heated it enough to get rid of most of the lumps. I put 1/3 the noodles in a large crock pot, followed by the onion/cheese mixture and I repeated this twice. Then stirred. Yummy. The leftovers will need extra cheese but it does taste like the cheese and onion pierogies. I would make this again.

I can't say much more than...this is how noodles should always be. Make these, preferably this instant. I added diced green onion at the end as a garnish.

Made this earlier this week and was pleasantly surprised. It was delicious! No, I didn't change a thing, initially. Made enough that there was plenty leftover for a second meal. Wwe then added some parmesan cheese and a can of peas. Both meals were fantastic! A keeper for sure!!

Simple but delicious dish in the Polish style. One thing that I'd like to point out is that there is no such thing as PIEROGIES. The  Polish word Pierogi is already plural and does not need an 's'. That makes it incorrect in two languages. The singular of pierogi is pierog. Saying pierogs would be the correct English plural.

I love this dish!  So easy.  I followed the recipe, then added some canned peas for protein, and they really tasted good in there.  I think you could add just about anything you want.  I may try black olives and mushroom next time.  I know this will become a regular at my home.  Thanks!

I’ve made this exactly as this recipe calls several times and it reminded me of my Polish upbringing.  My mom added chopped bacon and I’ve since done the same.  Delicious as dinner and great to reheat in the office microwave oven for lunch.

Comfort food! I followed the recipe, other than slightly reducing the butter. It was plenty for my taste, but recipe's amount of butter would be even more rich and delicious! I used kluski noodles, as mentioned by some reviewers, but will go with wide egg noodles next time.

I adore the simplicity of this recipe, yet the satisfying feeling of comfort while eating it. Perfect as-is. Wouldn't change a thing.

Followed the recipe as stated. 
Used high protein/ fiber egg noodles to help balance out nutrition- pretty good.

It was quick and easy. I substituted some zucchini noodles for half the pasta and added them in just as the onions were finished cooking.  Sweating the zucchini for a few minutes kept the dish from being too soggy.

Made this for the first time tonight.  I will be making it again!

I did make some changes to the recipe.  I added a pound of hamburger.  I cooked the onions, hamburger, salt and about 3 Tbsp. of garlic together.  Drained and then added the butter to the hamburger mixture to melt.  Added the hamburger, sour cream, cottage cheese and pepper  to the noodles and served. 

I like it, but next time I make it I'll add more sour cream, cottage cheese and more salt to the mix.

Delicious - but HEAVY!  As I was making it, I kept saying to myself -what am I doing!  All I saw was clogged arteries!  Very delicious though.  I had one big plateful and that was too much.  The next day I had a small serving with garlic kale on the side and THIS was perfect.  Thank you.  Will make again when I want to indulge.

I made the recipe as written. I enjoyed the way it came out. There is a lot you can do with this by adding some herbs or cheese if you want more robust flavors.  You could toss it with chicken and make it the star of the meal. All in all a good dish to have on the menu.

We liked these noodles.  Very easy to make.  Next time I would maybe cut down slightly on the sour cream....a little tangy for me. We put parmesan  cheese on them.  I think some balsamic glaze would be good too.

I have made this in the past using my Mom's recipe, she always added in cooked breakfast sausage (Bob Evan's Sage) this made it a little heartier.....but either way it is one of my favorites!

My wife made the dish as an alternative to baked potato for a side with the NY strip steaks that I grilled over mesquite chips.  I basted the steaks with Merlot wine the last few minutes of cooking.  The Polish noodles just put the meal over the top!  Will do the same again!!

Made just as per recipe, but though I cooked the whole onion, I didn't add it all as it was too much for my taste. Next time I will likely just leave it out. But it is very good and even my picky husband ate it.  That says a lot.

My Ukrainian Baba made this all time for me when I was younger, and she knew I was going to their house!  I make it quite often, I like to add a little chicken bouillon to the mix, and a little fresh dill.  Such a loving comfort food, I think of Baba every time I make it.

I make this monthly but I brown Hillshire Farm Polish or Beef sausage first to the  pan before adding the water to cook the noodles.  When the noodles are cooked, I drain the water and add the cottage CHEESE and sour cream to taste.  Pair with a hearty salad or beets or green beans.   Hmmm mmm good!

I threw this simple quick recipe together tonight for dinner.  I used a sweet onion and oops...out of sour cream!  Substituted Greek yogurt instead!  It was delicious!  Can't wait to try it with the sour cream next time.

Loved the recipe, which was a staple in  my parent's N.J. kitchen, from the Polish side of my family -  made as directed, but before serving, add chopped curly parsley and/or dill and lots of coarse- ground pepper.  Refrigerate  any leftovers and re=heat in a skillet with a pat of butter.

Growing up in a Hungarian household this was comfort food to me as well.  My mom would make it like this or she would slice and fry bacon to add to the cottage cheese and noodles along with sour cream.

This makes a delicious side dish, but I also used to serve it to my kids for lunch years ago.  They didn't like onion, so I always left that out but will add for an adult version.  Also it's delicious even without the sour cream if you don't have that. I like it with small egg bow tie pasta, but any noodle or pasta works.  Throw in a little chopped fresh parsley if you have it.  This is a really versatile dish with the essential ingredients of noodles, cottage cheese, butter and salt & pepper.

Delicious! I drained the pasta, then quickly cooked the onions in the pasta pan. I cooked them for about half the time indicated because I like them almost raw, then dumped the pasta back in the pan. The only seasoning change I made was a tiny sprinkle of cayenne just to zip up the flavor. It and the barely cooked onions gave the pasta a tiny zip.

This is a great recipe, and just how my grandmother (from Russia) used to make it!
However, she also made a SWEET version, with sugar and leaving out the onions, black pepper, et al. 
Try it for breakfast! Better than Cap'n Crunch!

I used dry cottage cheese and crumbled fried bacon on top. A good substitute is ricotta cheese. I did not use onion but used sour cream with either dry cottage cheese [block] or ricotta cheese. I prefer broad egg noodles and even better the frozen instead of the dry noodles [fettucini or linguini] are great.

I love this simple and tasty side dish. I made as written the first time, but used the green part of green onions (scallions) the next time, and preferred that. Either way, they're delish! Great with steak instead of potatoes for a change.

This is also a Hungarian dish that we call cottage cheese and noodles.  I don't put sour cream in it, but try adding some diced, fried bacon........delicious!  I make it at least once a week.  My kind of comfort food.

Great recipe! So simple but good. I like to jazz things up though and after trying it as written next time I did add a few very thinly sliced mushrooms when the onions were about 3/4 done. Also some slivered ham (had a small slice to use up) Love it both ways!

The more onions the better in my family. I usually caramelize the onions. Sometimes add grated sharp cheddar  (like they say " better with cheddar")

My polish in-laws used to make this.  No onion though, but added sugar to the sour cream and cottage cheese.  My kids liked it but I wasn't very fond of it.

To make it really delicious - fry the noodles in the butter before adding the other ingredients - that give the dish a nice crunch!

Looks like a great idea. I think I'll add some parsley to it for a little additional flavor and some color. Might be good with some garlic cooked in at the end of the onion cooking process too. Thanks for sharing!

My Hungarian grandma made these, she called them 'Hungarian Noodles'. I always rinse the cottage cheese curds, then let them dry on paper towels before making them. Also, I use the thick Klusky Noodles for the recipe. I just LOVE these noodles!

Made it and it tasted like pasta and pierogies had a delicious baby!  Saw a comment about leaving sour cream out so I tasted it before adding and it was so good I didn’t bother adding sour cream.

I really wanted this to be a hit, but in the back of my mind thinking that the flavor was coming from cottage cheese and sour cream I should have realized how bland it would be - and it was.  The only change I made was to use bow-tie pasta, but that shouldn't have been an issue. Thanks, but no thanks for a repeat.

This  dish has been in my family for years, but without the sour cream.  Mueller used to make a dumpling noodle that was PERFECT for it, but can't find them any longer.  Now I just use whatever macaroni noodle I have.  The heartier noodles are better for reheating, in my opinion.  So fun to see this old family dish on here!

OMG! My mom made this for us over 50 years ago and I'm sure long  before that. We never added onions, but I'll have to try it the next time I make some. It's simple, easy and fairly quick to make. An excellent lunch or dinner when you want something light but filling. Serve with a nice salad. Yum! This brought back very fond memories. Thanks.

Really simple recipe. I don't care for mac and cheese, but I enjoyed this. I added extra salt to taste and used radiatore noodles. I accidentally added twice the amount of sour cream. Has so many ways to change it up. Might add shredded parmesan cheese next time.

I made it exactly as written, but then added some chicken sausage for my husband who always wants more protein. I don't usually love love love recipes that make me feel so guilty- for adding a 1/2 cup of butter and a pile of cottage cheese and sour cream- sounds so unhealthy. The next day I had it for lunch- microwaved and it retained all it's cheesy  saucy goodness.  The flavors are just perfection to me, I don't know if being half Polish makes the difference! So simple and surprisingly good.

I added garlic and onion powder as well as leftover cubed smoked ham that I had to the pot when I was sautéing the onion and cabbage.  It was so easy to make and delicious to eat.

My mom used to make this with homemade noodles when I was a kid, minus the sour cream. This recipe brought back some good memories.   I made it as written and loved it!  The sour cream added some flavor dimension.  We ate it as a quick meal, but I would probably make it as a side dish next time.  Definitely comfort food!

I've been wavering on how many stars to give this one.  It's easy and quick with a surprising amount of flavor. I'm a little hung up on the texture. I followed the recipe and directions exactly. Next time I try this I will take the reviewer's advice about adding the cottage cheese to the onion and butter mixture. I have a feeling we would like that better. In any case, this is a great little side dish. It's very filling and would pair well with any meat you'd serve along side it.

'Thought I'd like this, but it was a take-it-or-leave-it situation.  'Not bad, but nothing magic happened, as I thought it would.  The flavor improved the next day so I'd up this a half star, if I could.  In-a-pinch, I might just make it again.  :)

Tastes like Grandmas dish.  She always added a good shake of dried dill and I did too.  Delicious and a no bake dish! Thanks for sharing.

I've made this many times over the years and my polish husband loves it.  Today we are preparing it for a church potluck and we are adding kielbasa and green beans.  One big crock pot FULL OF DELICIOUSNESS!!  Very nice recipe.  Simple and tasty.  Comfort food in my recipe book.

Used this with leftover noodles to make a "different" pasta dish.  It was tasty, simple to make with ingredients on hand, and quick!  I didn't have sour cream in the fridge so I substituted plain yogurt instead.  Also added a little squirt of lemon juice.  Tasted great and reminded me of pierogies from my childhood.  Definite comfort food!!

Can I give 10 stars, this is so good.A flavor so loud you can taste it with out an over load of salt . If you like stroganoff you will like this it has so much more flavor the stroganoff.

I really liked this as an alternative to mac n cheese that is also a handy way to use up leftover sour cream and cottage cheese. I will keep this in my comfort food repertoire, thank you!

This came together super quick making it a winner for a weeknight meal.  I made it exactly as the recipe stated and it was delicious.  I could see it being a fun base to use up some leftover goat cheese or chard ribs.  The cottage cheese and sour cream really make it indulgent. And there's the butter too, which I highly recommend using as well. This is a keeper.  Thanks for sharing.

Perfect recipe as is!  I was looking for a recipe to make for a potluck that was quick and easy, and this worked perfectly as many are vegetarian!  Thank you so much for sharing.
