I've had the original version as described here, which is good but can be improved - trust me! I've tried several variations of this and other similar recipes ("Overnight Blueberry French Toast"), and this is my family's favorite: Cut eggs back to 9-10, and add 1 tsp. vanilla to the egg/milk mixture.  Six to 8 oz. cream cheese is plenty.  Spreading the cream cheese on the bread before slicing is a great idea if you have family members who aren't fond of cream cheese - it's less visible.  Otherwise, cut into small dice no bigger than 1/2 inch (a little messy, but much better than the 1 inch squares suggested in other recipes). It's critical to sprinkle cinnamon (I like Pampered Chef's "Cinnnamon Plus" spice blend) on both the bottom and top layers of bread cubes - the cinnamon could be added to the egg mixture as well, but I would still sprinkle extra on top.  For the sauce, use only about 1-2 tsp. of cornstarch, especially if you prepare it ahead of time - otherwise the sauce becomes too thick.  Reduce the sugar to 1/4-1/3 cup, and add the juice of half a lemon for a little zip.  Tip: Be careful not to use too much bread -- the dish can't "puff up" if all of the cubes aren't sufficiently saturated. Also, as much as I love the sauce, the dish is equally good and maybe even better with real maple syrup. Enjoy!

This was DELICIOUS as a light supper with a sausage patty on the side.  I divided this recipe down to make 3 servings.  Used homemade white bread and frozen, rinsed blueberries (that's all that I had on hand).  For my 3 servings, I did use 3-1/2 oz. of cream cheese, 2/3 cup blueberries, and 1/4 cup chopped pecans in the refrigerated mixture.  (Spread the cheese over all the slices of bread before cutting them into cubes.)  For the sauce I increased the blueberries to 1/2 cup and added the juice of 1/2 a lemon.  Only had time to chill this for about 2 hours.  Baked it in an 8-1/2 x 4-1/2 inch glass loaf pan.  VERY YUMMY!

Love it!  I was looking forward to trying this and was disappointed when I realized that it was supposed to be made the day before.  I prepared and baked itanyway and it was great.  I used frozen blueberries.  I will use fewer eggs next time and more blueberries.

To facilitate easier serving, I slice the bread into 12 slices, then make six "sandwiches" with cream cheese on each slice of bread and a small handful of blueberries. I cut cut each sandwich in half, then fit the halves in a 9 x 13 pan. In the morning, I flip over each sandwich so the soggier side is on top and the drier side is on the bottom before baking. This ensures 12 clearly defined portions, easy serving and eating, and even distribution of the egg and milk mixture. I bring this whenever I need a brunch dish for work or other gatherings.

I was very disappointed with the way this recipe turned out. I would reduce the quantity of eggs to 4 and add 1/2 cup of sugar to the mixture. There was too much cream cheese and it did not contribute anything to the flavor. Use a good hearty bread such as a challah and sprinkle cinnamon sugar over it before baking.

My family raved about this recipe, which I served for a Christmas brunch.  I substituted cranberries for the blueberries.  The tartness counter-balanced the sweetness nicely, was less expensive than blueberries, plus looked more Christmas-y.  Thank you for this new family favorite.

I was very disappointed in this recipe.  I followed it except for adding cinnamon, vanilla and walnuts for added flavor as recommended.  It was still very bland and dry on the top.  A 1 lb. loaf of italian bread is way too much!  Blueberry sauce was good but that was about it.  Sorry, but I would not recommend this recipe.

This is really good, but I knew I had to make some changes to make it 5 star.  First the eggs, 12 is too much (I made a similar recipe a few years ago and 12 eggs ruined it) so I put in 8.  In the sauce, I only did 1/2 cup sugar but next time I would add only 1/4 cup or less because it was still way too sweet.  I couldn't really taste the blueberry flavor.  Too much cornstarch too, it ended up looking like pie filling (which I think is gross) so I would cut that in half next time.  I added a splash of lemon juice to the sauce, which helped.  I used skim milk, whole-grain french bread, and Neufchatel cheese.  With my changes it's 5 stars, but as is, it's a 4.  I really enjoyed my version though!

Sooo good!  I changed a few things to make this a little healthier.  I used egg substitute to lower the cholesterol #'s, I used whole wheat bread, and put lots of cinnamon (very high in antioxidants) all over the bread mixture, and I used more than the recommended amount of blue berries.  In the sauce I only used about 1/3 cup sugar and I think that made the  fresh blueberry flavoe really come through.  I recently read that blueberries are the healthiest things on the planet to eat.  So I'll make this again and again

this was very very good.  my family loved it over the holidays.  used the small boisenberrys we picked in Canada over summer.  I also poured some of the syrup over the dish just prior to serving.  leftovers heated in oven next day was just as good.

Tonight we had breakfast for dinner; I've made this before and prefer it not so soft so I let it set in the fridge for about 4 hours then baked.  I halved this recipe and it's enough for the four of us along with my other sides (potatoes and sausage).   I added a tsp. of vanilla to the egg mixture and a tsp. of lemon juice to the berry sauce as suggested.  I forgot the maple syrup.   Used a package of frozen mixed berries which I simmered until hot but left them whole for presentation!  :)  Almost forgot to mention that I used leftover rolls (Costco)...

We love this recipe!  I've made it several times for special occasions. As there are just 2 of us, I cut the recipe in half and bake it in a 9x9 inch pan. Ater making it several times, I tweaked it just a bit. I use Hawaiian bread which is sliceded, then spead the softened cream cheese on top.  And instead of using 6 eggs I use 4.  Also sprinkle a bit of cinnamon over the bread, because we love cinnamon. Thanks for a great recipe!!

This is really very easy to put together.  I didn't bother to make it the night before, I just popped it in my oven after I assembled it and it turned out fine.  I had intended to add a splash of vanilla extract to the milk/egg mixture but forgot.  Don't skip out on the blueberry syrup...it's a must.  I have used frozen and fresh blueberries in the past, and either one works good. Thanks Robin.

Overall I liked this recipe, but it does need some tweaking.  I used frozen blueberries for the toast and the sauce.  I added cinnamon and vanilla to the toast as suggested by others, which was a very good thing.  I didn't reduce the amount of eggs and really should have - 12 made it WAY too egg-y.  Also, I found it almost impossible to dice the cream cheese, so I just squeezed little bits off the brick by hand (messy, but infinitely easier).  I agree with another reviewer that the French toast is not sweet at all, and the sauce is a bit too sweet, so I think next time I'll increase the maple syrup (or add sugar) to the egg/milk mixture, and decrease the amount of sugar in the blueberry sauce by about half.  I also decreased the amount of cornstarch in the sauce as suggested by others, but I think it made the sauce to liquid-y.  I like it more on the thick side.  By the way, I doubled the blueberry sauce recipe and mixed some of the leftovers into vanilla yogurt - it was super scrumptous, better than the leading national brand!  I bet it would be wonderful on ice cream too! (or pound cake, or cheese cake, or cottage cheese, or .....)

Wonderful! 

If you have fresh bread, cut it up and bake it on cookie sheets at about 200 degrees until it dries out. It will absorb the egg mixture better.

Also, spread the cream cheese on the bread before assembling. Its MUCH easier than trying to cube the cream cheese and it disperses more evenly.

This is amazing!!!   I wasn't even a fan of french toast but this is yum-tastic.  Everyone asked for the recipe.  One lady I brought some to rolled her eyes back into her head and did a dance after her first bite.    I added the 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon to the egg mixture and 1/4 cup of powdered sugar to the cream cheese.  For the topping I didn't add butter but I did add 1/2 teaspoon of lemon juice which really makes the sauce have some zing and kept it from tasting too sugary.   My husband adores this.  I can't imagine anyone not liking this.    This is french toast elevated to an art form. hehe :)

very delicious!  So easy to make.  I followed the advice of minngal, adding the vanilla and cinnamon.  I would have to agree with her.  I think it is absolutely neccessary.  Also when I took the dish out in the morning I covered it tightly with plastic wrap and turned the whole dish upside down to get the moisture more evenly distributed.  I think that worked really well.  It turned out perfect.

Yummy recipe, but it seems like the flavor is lacking something.  I'll definately make it again and try adding a little lemon juice.  One recommendation, spread the cream cheese on the bread and then cube the bread.  Works much better!

This was really an excellent recipe and have made it twice already!  I served it in the pan with some of the Blueberry Sauce on top and the rest on the side (warming in a teeny crock pot).  I took the cream cheese and added a little milk and sugar, and beat it until creamy to make it easier to spread over first bread layer.  Definitely recommend!

Brunch was entirely off this site: Blueberry French Toast, Glorified Hashbrowns, Peach Praline Muffins, and Scrambled Egg Muffins. Yummy and super easy recipes!
The sauce was amazing! Finished it with a squeeze of lemon. Will use it on waffles/pancakes/etc. I also think I'll use it with vodka and lemonade in the summer :o)
BUT~ the french toast was blah. I rated 5 stars for potential: I'll make it again for sure, but with these modifications 2 1/2- 3 c blueberries, lots more cheam cheese (spread on bread before diced) and added to egg mix 2/3 c sugar, 3 tsp cin/nutmeg, and maybe 2 T vanilla.  Then it would be perfect for me!

This was so delish! I halved the french toast recipe though and left the syrup amount the same (I love syrup, but do not need a huge batch of toast for only two of us). Also.... I tweaked it by mixing powdered sugar in with the cream cheese (and a little wee bit of shredded mozzarella cheese. It sounds weird I know, but it makes it just a little melty when it's hot and adds a little savory element). 
I also followed the cinnamon recommendation and glad I did! Wonderful dinner recipe also.

Made as directed and this thing needed a little oomph. I also did not like the unappealing color. Might try again with other's suggestions.

I make this every year for Christmas breakfast.  I scale back the eggs to 8 and I use texas toast instead of Italian bread.  I take the toast and make little sandwiches with the cream cheese and then cut on the diagonal to serve.   I also add cinnamon to the egg mixture and then add even more just before baking.  Delicious!

Oh my word!  This is so good.  It's reasonably easy to prepare, and very impressive.  The blueberry sauce adds just the right touch, although the kids preferred it with regular maple syrup.  We enjoyed this for our Christmas morning brunch and I will definitely make it a staple for our future Christmas brunches.

This was pretty good.I cut the eggs down to 7 and only used 1 1/2 cups cream (instead of the milk) added in 1 tsp cinnamon,1/2 tsp apple pie spice.The middle still was a bit soggy but it's getting better the more i play with this recipe.I will add in more spices next time and maybe scale back to 1 cup milk/cream to see if i can get the soggyness not to be in this dish.

This was pretty tasty, although the first time it came out more like a bread pudding...too moist for my taste. Second time, I softened the cream cheese, and spread it on the bottom layers of bread (whole slices), then topped with blueberries and cubed bread and additional cinnamon. I baked it an additional 15 minutes. The blueberry sauce was nummy, the second time I used Equal instead of sugar, blended it, and added 1/2 cup of corn syrup and 1 tsp lemon juice to make more of a blueberry syrup. My husband thought of it more as a dessert. (He prefers savory breakfasts)

Overall we liked this.  Here's how we made it:  I didn't use the whole loaf (used a little more than 3/4 of it), dicing cream cheese is impossible so I sliced it off & used my fingers to squeeze little pieces off (about 1/2 teaspoon size), I used 2 cups of blueberries (frozen & rinsed to thaw), I sprinkled cinnamon over the top layer of bread, added vanilla to the egg mix, and squished the bread down into it after it was poured over the top.  This is not like the kind of french toast you make on a skillet, it is more of an egg breakfast casserole.  Next time I would decrease the amount of eggs (9?) and increase the maple syrup.  I would sprinkle cinnamon over the cream cheese layer (the cream cheese is rather flavor-less), or even better would be cinnamon/sugar.  We did not make the blueberry syrup (too much sugar for us).  I actually think this is better when reheated the next day (flavors have a chance to blend more), and with a small amount of maple syrup on top.  It made about 8 servings for our family.

This was great -- so easy to put together the night before and pop in the oven in the morning. I added vanilla (as in the Overnite Blueberry French Toast recipe), since I always do with french toast. I wasn't pleased with the sauce, however -- much too sweet and a bit flavourless. I added more blueberries and the zest of a lemon and fresh squeezed lemon juice -- much better! I'll definitely make this again! Note: doesn't reheat well, so be sure so finish it all!

Delicious! Five stars all the way! I did mine with a few different ingredients and mixed it all together the same... 
instead of milk I used half n half
instead of Italian bread I used French bread and instead of Blueberries I used 2 cups of diced strawberries. Turned out Divine!

This was really great!  I cut everything in half (and used blackberries because that's what I had) and baked in an 8X8 for the 30 and 30... perfect!  Will make again and again.

This is an excellent recipe that always is received well.  I've been making this for the past several years.  The trick to keep the mixture moist - when you first cover the casserole, push down on mixture to ensure that egg mixture comes up and covers the top layer of bread.  This should eliminate the dryness that some readers experienced.

Delicious! I halved the recipe and made a few changes from the reviews I read and another recipe I had: used a little orange juice, vanilla and walnuts in egg mixture, along with reducing eggs by 2, and added a little orange juice (part of water amount) & orange zest to the blueberry sauce. I also used Challah bread and spread 3oz of cream cheese on sliced bread before cubing (from reviews also).  Perfect!

This recipe is fabulous.  It was so easy to assembly and I can easily see it becoming a family favorite.  The taste was just right, not to sweet.  One thing we changed was increasing the blueberries in the sauce to 2 cups verses one.  This seemed to be about right I think with one cup only it might be a little too sweet.

I suggest spreading the cream cheese on the bread before cutting it, much easier!! Delicious--everyone loved it.  Tastes great with strawberries too.

I had this dish for a family birthday brunch.  It was fantastic and everyone raved over the blueberry sauce (would be great on ice cream too).  The only thing I will do next time is add 4oz more cream cheese.

3.20.14 ... https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/23307/blueberry-french-toast/ ... This & overnight blueberry french toast are very,very similar.Very.I read a lot of reviews from each - so,yes,I made some changes.Those reviews are very helpful.I don't feel badly about changing a recipe when so many have a certain problem or suggestion that was successful.To m'point!:)I followed the suggestion of making cream cheese sandwiches, egging,then turning them over before baking.  Some said the tops were dry.No problem with that after "the flip":D  'Used less eggs as suggested,too.(Actually,seven since my bread didn't fill the pan.I'd go for nine next time.)I added a little vanilla.A little melted butter would've been nice,too.Heyyy,maybe spread some melted butter on the top piece of bread before pouring the egg mixture over?!?That'd be nice,I think.I forgot the syrup,but I'd think baking syrup for an hour wouldn't necessarily be a good thing -&probably go to the bottom of the dish.'May add some mapeleine next try.The berries in with the toast didn't do much for taste except look pretty.The sauce I didn't make,but I'm sure it'd be good.I've made blueberry sauce before with pancakes.Yum.Oh,for the cream cheese,I put 2T sugar&an egg in with it.I'm not sure about the egg.I think half an egg would be better.It wasn't as creamy as I would've liked (but I got over it quickly :D).Grease the pan extra well -&you'll probably still have to soak.All n all,good,but not as good as regular timeconsumi

Made this as a part of a larger breakfast of maple syrup brushed baked bacon, fried potatoes with onions, and scrambled eggs. Made only 1/2 a recipe in a 8x8 casserole and it was more then enough for a group of six to have a serving with two servings remaining.  Everyone raved and thought it was delicious!! However, the cream cheese didn't melt through out the casserole as well as I would have hoped. While my sister-in-law said she liked not getting a bite of cream cheesd in each bite, I think I like the suggestion of whipping the cream cheese with some powdered sugar and spreading it on. I believe it may give the dish a more consistent flavor. We were on vacation in a rental condo while making this recipe and I didn't think to buy powdered sugar, but will try that suggestion the next time.

I can't believe how simply good this is! I chose this version because it uses only 8 oz. of cream cheese, which turned out to be perfect when cut into 1/2" cubes as MinnGal suggested. I left a few 1" cubes on one end, but when you're eating it, they end up being cut in half with your fork anyway. I think leaving the cream cheese in chunks is key to the beauty and taste of this dish. Soft creamy white bites contrast with bright blueberries and crisp bread cubes on top. I used sugar free maple syrup, and the bread cubes seemed to really pick up a yummy concentrated maple flavor. I served hot blueberry syrup on our first two servings at breakfast, and then drizzled the rest over the leftovers to refrigerate. It was like a cheesecake topping, and good cold also. We ended up eating this for breakfast & dinner the second day and lunch (I'm talking main dish) the third day. My husband already wants more.

I've been making this recipe for many years.  Guests absolutely love it!  Simple sandwich white bread works just as well and the sauce freezes great so you can make it ahead and just microwave it for a minute or two before serving.

I have made this recipe before, but I use cinnamon bread instead of Italian. I don't let this sit in the fridge overnight anymore, because the bread becomes too soggy and won't bake thoroughly in the middle and the edges will end up overdone. Try this sometime with cinnamon bread and don't let it sit overnight.

I have been making this for several years now. My family really likes it! I add a extra syrup, blueberries, vanilla, and I double the cream cheese. I melt the cream cheese, put it into a ziplock bag, cut the end of and squeeze it over the whole thing to get an even layer! It turns out great every time. I also usually make a double batch of the sauce because we go through so much and I can alway use it later! Highly recommend!

If this tasted as good as it looked, I would give it a 5 star review.  Unfortunately once we ate it, we were unimpressed.  It was certainly edible, but we would rather just eat plain french toast from a box compared to this.  If I had to make it again, I would:  1) Watch the baking time as I think 60 minutes is a bit too long.  We didn't care for the crispy parts.  2) I would leave it covered for the whole bake time to avoid the crunchiness.  I'm surprised we didn't like based on the good score overall, but my recommendation would be to keep searching for the ultimate recipe.

This is amazing!!! I followed other tips about 9-10 eggs, adding vanilla, and sprinkling cinnamon on the bread. Make sure you get fresh french bread it makes a huge difference.  I served with a variety of syrups and everyone cheated on their diets for this one!  Thank you so much for such a great recipe!

I followed the advice of others and cut back the eggs to 9 and the cream cheese to about 5 oz. Also cut cream cheese into really small pieces or its too overpowering.

I made this for a brunch and was amazed at how quickly it disappeared. I used 8 eggs and added more milk. Following some advice in another recipe, I spread the cream cheese on the bread before cubing it. I made 1 1/2 times the syrup and we had a small amount leftover. I used half brown sugar and half white sugar in the sauce for extra flavor. Frozen blueberries work well. An added plus is that this warms up well in the microwave.

I run a commercial kitchen (that tries to cook from scratch) and came across this recipe at the beginning of blueberry season this year. Our guests and staff have been ecstatic over this. We've added it to our weekend brunch and we continue to get rave reviews each and every time we serve it. The ease of preparing this the day ahead for a busy morning makes this a WIN WIN recipe. Hats off to the creator of this recipe it is AWESOME!!! Oops, I forgot to mention we like to use cinnamon swirl bread for the cubed bread.

Amazing! You only need about 10 eggs and it'll be perfect! and be sure to sprinkle some cinnamon on top! or Pampered Chef's Toffee topping.

My family and guests really liked this when I made it with blueberries but,thought it was a little too sweet with the blueberry sauce. I made it with fresh cranberries last month and it was fantastic. I only wish I had gotten more cranberries and froze them while I could still find them. I will definitely make again and again.

I made this for Christmas breakfast. It was good, but I don't think I would make it again.  The bottom turned out very moist, which I prefer, and the top turned out very dry.  My husband said that it was better the next day because after heating it up in the microwave the moist parts dried out a little and the dry parts became moister.  Good, but I was hoping for something a little better.  I enjoyed the blueberry sauce and may use that with other recipes.

I halved this recipe and was very happy with the results. I cubed the cream cheese very small, and would try spreading it on the bread next time as it was my favorite part. I only had 4 day old bread that was pretty hard and it still turned out great. Very yummy but it was hard to wait for so long for breakfast.

After reading several reviews that said this didnt bake well, I decided to change this up a bit. I made regular french toast with a loaf of sliced bread. I made the blueberry sauce as directed but cut it down to 1/2 cup of sugar. Then I nuked the cream cheese to room temp (and to soften). I spread the cream cheese on each slice of already cooked french toast, then topped with the blueberry sauce. It was still a bit sweet, but the family loved it! An fyi, one loaf of bread was plenty for a family of 6 to have two pieces each plus seconds for 3.

I was profoundly disappointed with this recipe after reading all of the wonderful reviews.  I followed it precisely as written and it was bland at best.  The only redeeming factor was the blueberry sauce which was too sweet...and we love sugar at our house.  I would not make this again.

great recipe! used "french toast bread", available at safeway, which has cinnamon etc. baked in it and a 6 oz. tub of whipped light cream cheese, making sandwiches before cutting into squares. (use a pizza cutter to speed this up) also used frozen blueberries, only 8 eggs and fat free 1/2 and 1/2 instead of milk. used splenda in the sauce and it was amazing, will keep this on hand in the fridge for other uses.

I was really excited to make this- I love cream cheese and blueberries. There are deinately way too many eggs- I think they could be cut down to 8 or 9. Also, the chunks of cream cheese don't melt enough during baking. Next time I will soften the cream cheese and add the blueberries, then spoon the mixture over the first layer of bread. The blueberry sauce is fantastic- double it because it goes fast!

I used reduced soy, 6 eggs and 6 servings of Egg Beaters, reduced fat cream cheese and maple syrup. Agree the portion of bread to egg mixture is off. Use less eggs with same amount of bread, or more bread with same amount of eggs. Turned out delicous. Did not make the sauce and bought blueberry syrup. ONLY THING I WOULD CHANGE: make sure the blueberries and cream cheese is in the middle, when they are on top it effects the presentation and looked un-appetizing.

I would make cream cheese smaller.  I love blueberries and my whole family loved this.  I will make it again and have recomended it to friends.  The syrup is sweet (what syrup isn't?)which is good because the bread really isn't.  If you use a good heavy bread (french bread or the like) it was great. I wouldn't squish it down into the egg either.  The parts that stuck out got crispy and good!

This was delicious! I made it for 6 servings instead of 12. I used french bread instead because that is what I had and my daughter thought it was a bit "eggy" so I will cut back the eggs by 2.  I also used soymilk instead of cows milk because of an allergy, and it was fantastic! Lower in carbs too.  Wonderful with bacon and sugar free syrup. I will make it many times. Thank you!

This was excellent!! I used frozen blueberries instead of fresh, just as good!! I would suggest softening cream cheese, maybe melting and pouring over blueberries.  Also took leftover blueberries and mixed with maple syrup and heated in microwave for really quick sauce!! YUM!!

Quick and easy recipe to throw together for a quick and yummy breakfast for the family or overnight guests!!!  I made this without the blueberries per they weren't in season.  Served it with a choice of sliced strawberries and powdered sugar or maple syrup.  It was quite delish.

Delicious and very easy to make.  Best with ripe, fresh blueberries.  Sauce is a bit sweet - will probably cut back on the sugar a little next time.  I didn't have time to prepare the night before, just assembled and popped right in the oven and it still turned out great.

I didn't care for this recipe too much. The bottom of the dish was very "egg-y" while the top was dry and crisp. Next time I would try soaking the bread in the egg mixture rather than pouring the egg mixture over the top. The sauce was good but too sweet (and I did cut down on the amount of sugar).

Oh my gosh!  I've been looking for the perfect breakfast casserole for special mornings. . .I found it!  This was really yummy.  I used fresh blueberries for the casserole and canned for the topping (using it's juice in lieu of water.  Sooooo good.

This recipe is so yummy.  I make the blueberry syrup all the time and use it on pancakes, waffles, ecy. It's better than anything I've ever had from the store.  
My hubby was very skeptical when we tried this but he loved it too.
It's definatly a keeper.

I made this recipe for a church breakfast and everyone thought the flavor was good.  However, most agreed it was too dry so next time I will use 18 eggs, 3 cups of milk and about 1/2 cup syrup.  I used canned blueberries and reserved the liquid to use in place of the water in the syrup recipe.

This recipe was a hit in my home on Christmas morning! I did a few things differently: less eggs, splash of vanilla extract, about a teaspoon  of pumpkin spice, and lastly, before I put it in the oven I stirred it all up again. The egg mixture over night had pooled in the bottom, causing the top layer of bread to be very dry. I felt stirring it before baking was key. P.S. The blueberry sauce is HEAVEN.

I have made this 3 times thus far. The first time "as is". No changes to the recipe. It was good, but a little on the sweet side and no enough fruit.  The second time I made it, I doubled the blueberries in the french toast, and left out the maple syrup.  The third time I "healthified" used sprouted grain bread, half egg white/half whole eggs, 4 cups of berries, and a tub of low fat ricotta cheese.  I liked the last one the best.

Made two pans of this recipe for a company breakfast club.  RAVE reviews from my co-workers, many asking for the recipe.  After reading the reviews, I too, added cinnamon and nutmeg to the egg mixture and a bit of lemon juice to the blueberry sauce.  I also put small pats of butter on top of the product and sprinkled with sugar just before putting it in the oven.  Will be making this for my family over the holidays as well.  They will LOVE it!  Two thumbs up on this one!

Instead of using cream cheese I used Greek yogurt along with substituting the milk with almond milk. It got great review with the family!

I like this recipe a lot! Others that I have served this to haven't always been as crazy about it though. The sauce is great for pancakes and waffles. I have made the sauce on its own many times and I absolutely love it. Thank you.

Based on others suggestions, I added cinnamon, and vanilla.  Still very tasteless.  The top was hard, the bottom was too soft.  We each had a piece and threw the rest out.  Will never make again.

Great recipe. Have made many times for Church Receptions between services..Usually bake in our commercial Convection ovens, really puffs up nice. Double the recipe to fit in a large foil pans for large group. Easy to cut and serve.

I made this recipe for a company breakfast at work and received rave reviews. I even had requests for the recipe. I also make a strawberry version which was equally delicious. I did, although, increase the amount of blueberries to two cups. Other than that, made it exactly as it stated. Kudos!

Mine didn't come out right at all.  I followed directions and used 1 loaf Italian bread and cubed it.  Used all 12 eggs, even though some reviews said they used less.  I didn't have enough egg batter for my bread and figured it would soak into bread overnight.  It did not.  My top layer was pretty dry.  When I baked it, it needed more time because it didn't set up in the amount of time indicated.  We decided not to make the blueberry topping, and instead used real maple syrup - which was way too sweet!  My husband and I did like the cream cheese with the blueberries, and I may make again and tweak it.

**** review for sauce only****  I intend on making this whole recipe...  But for valentines breakfast it would have been too much food without scaling down...  so...  I made my usual french toast and made the blueberry sauce/syrup to go with it....  My husband fell in love!!!  Have plenty left over and he either wants to put it on ice cream or use for blueberry short cake..  As others reviewed if you intend to make ahead, that this made with this amount of cornstarch will really thicken as it cools..  might curb cornstarch, but for me, I'm gonna reheat and thin out...*** Small change only***  I added a dash of vanilla...

I made this using homemade bread, following an earlier recommendation of adding 1 tsp. each vanilla and cinnamon, using 9 jumbo eggs.  Incredible flavors!

Wonderful! The only thing I changed is a little less cream cheese and cut up small or grate the cream cheese. A must try. I was asked for the recipe at church so I know others like it too!!! I think the bad ratings are due to people not making it right! That is the only explination!!! Thanks for this wonderful recipe!

I have made the original and it was very good - however, if you want EASY and AWESOME, read on. First of all, you can make this the morning you serve it - it does not need to be made the night before. I let it sit on my counter 20 or so minutes before baking to let it soak in. Only 8 eggs are needed, mix in 1 tsp. vanilla and 1 tsp. cinnamon in the egg mix. I also use 1-2 cups of blueberries sprinkled with 1/3 cup sugar in the center and omit the sauce entirely. Serve drizzled with maple syrup and it makes this breakfast even quicker. What makes this French toast perfect is using challah bread!

This was an excellent recipe!  I did add some cinnamon to the top of the bread, and I had to cook the casserole a little longer than the recipe said to make sure it was done in the middle.  I also used Splenda, since I had a diabetic there, but it was still wonderful!  Great recipe and will use it again!

I love to make this recipe.  It tastes like it should be desert.  And who wouldn't want to eat desert for breakfast?  I am not a blueberry lover, in fact I usually can't stand them. This recipe changed my mind.

Yum! I followed the directions exactly and it turned out perfectly. It was not mushy at all. It was nice and crispy on top, and the cream cheese and blueberry sauce was incredible. I just topped with some powdered sugar, cinnamon and homemade whipped cream before serving.

UMM!  I did NOT soak overnight and this was fine!  Let it sit on counter for about 1/2 hour while oven heated up and that is it!  It was great- I think that soaking overnight may even make it more soggy?  Halfed the recipe and for sauce used about 1/4 C sugar- PLENTY sweet! I also added a bit of vanilla to the egg mixture and sprinkled cinnamon ontop of top layer of bread.  Made in 8x8 baking pan which was a little hard to clean up.  I may switch to glass pan next time.  And would like to top off with homemade whipped cream!  Will def make again- great way to use up stale bread!

This was good it was just missing the "WOW" I was looking for.  I was kicking myself when I took this to work and ate a piece and realized I forgot to add the lemon juice like another reviewer suggested.  I really think that could have made a HUGE difference.  I used 3/4 of a loaf of bread and 9 eggs and scaled everything else down accordingly.  Next time I will definitely use less eggs mixture.  I also added cinnamon and I am very glad I did.  I may bake again, but definitely with some more tweeking.

EXCELLENT! Good for lots of people or scale down for two. I used the Hawaiian bread that comes in the orange bag at the grocery store, and only 3/4 of the loaf was needed (otherwise would have been too dry. I altered as follws: 11 eggs, adding 1 tbsp vanilla to batter, used 3/4c sugar in the sauce (with the listed proportions), and sprinkled both bread layers with cinnamon. Next time, I'll DOUBLE the sauce, you can use extra easily, and keep it for leftovers as well. Great with mimosas.

I was in a pinch and needed to substitute the cream cheese with Ricotta.  Hopefully the guests didnt mind the gritty texture.

This is a great combination of flavors and textures.  I used whole grain bread and 6 whole eggs and 6 egg whites.  Sprinkled with cinnamon sugar.  This is healthy and delicious.  Kids and adults will love this combination as we did.

The receipe is pretty easy to make but I used French bread because couldn't find Italian.  Anyway, it turned out delicious!  My son and husband really enjoyed this one and we even got to have left overs the next day too!

Yummy!  I also made some minor modifications based upon other reviews: spread the cream cheese on the bread prior to cutting into cubes, added 1 tsp vanilla to the mixture, and sprinkled cinnamon before and after the bread layers.  Instead of pouring the mixture over the bread, I put the bread directly into the mixture to make sure all the pieces were saturated.  I didn't make it the night before, and it still came out great.  Everybody loved it!!!

This recipe was okay...I was expecting a bit more flavor. I did add more maple syrup and then more again after it was cooked. I added the vanilla and cinnamon to the egg mixture as others had recommended. It was pretty good for something to throw in the oven if you have breakfast company but would try something with a bit more flavor next time.

Delicious!  Not for those counting calories, but wonderful for an occasional weekend indulgence.  I love that I can make this the night before and just pop it into the oven in the morning while everyone is getting ready for the day.  

The used half orange juice/half water for the sauce and add some cinnamon because I like that flavour combination.

This recipe was fantastic! We made it for our New Year's Day breakfast and will do so again. I did do a small bit of changing like some others did, but only by upping the cinnamon and maple syrup a bit and I actually used all the eggs called for because I wanted all of the bread covered.  I made it the night before and then as it finished baking I sprinkled sugar crystals over it.  I did end up doubling the sauce because I have sweet tooths around here and there wouldnt have been enough to go around. Next time, I am going to try using several different kinds of berries as well.

It was as good as it sounded.  I did forget the syrup and think it needed it to make it a little sweeter.  Also I cut back on the eggs as one reviewer suggested but next time I'll add the full dozen.  I was a little short on liquid with only 9 eggs.  I also added Cinnamon Plus and vanilla and recommend that.  Next time I'll try spreading some the cream cheese on the bread and cube the rest.

I followed some other reviewers suggestions and spread the cream cheese on the bread prior to breaking it apart- seemed a bit more distributed this way. This was very good, but I did cook a bit longer and wish the sauce was not so sweet. The consistency of the sauce was perfect, but way to sweet for our tastes. Will keep and make some adjustments.

I spread the cream cheese on the bread, 6 oz was enough, used 8 eggs instead of 12, added cinnamon on the bread slices, & used 3/4 C sugar in the sauce instead of 1 C. 1 hour is a long time to wait in the morning for breakfast. The sauce was a pain & it took forever for the blueberries to burst. The taste of this was mediocre for all the time spent on it making it. You would be better off making regular french toast & serving blueberry sauce over it. I will NOT be trying this again.

This was good, but not great.  I like the sauce recipe as my husband enjoys blueberry pancakes, and now I have the blueberry syrup to go with it.  Thanks!

This is a great recipe. I drizzled a little of my buttermilk syrup recipe and it really made it a hit.(1 c. Buttermilk, 1/2c. sugar, 1cube butter. boil/desolve sugar then remove from heat and add 2 tsp. baking soda. serve immediately) But I will definately decrease the eggs and use more syrup.

I made this for Christmas brunch and it was a big hit!  Following some of the reviews, I used 10 eggs instead of 12 and added cinnamon, nutmeg, and vanilla to the egg mixture.  I sliced the loaf of bread in half and spread the cream cheese over it before cutting it into cubes, which worked out really nicely.  I ended up baking it for at least 40 min at 350 with the foil on, then turning the heat up to 400 and removing the foil to make the top a little crispier.  I also used only 1/2c. of sugar in the blueberry sauce and added a squirt of lemon juice.  Fantastic -- I will definitely be making this again next year!

Thanks for the recipe. I served it on Christmas morning and my husband liked it, but I was disappointed. I really wanted this recipe "as is" to be amazing, but it really needed several changes and I still didn't get it quite right. Although I added cinnamon, vanilla, extra maple syrup and twice the number of blueberries to the mix, the final result seemed to be lacking flavor. 
Here is my idea: Next time I will make more of a cinnamon roll glaze of butter, sugar and cinnamon on the stove and then pour it over each layer of bread cubes/berries. I will also butter the bread with cream cheese instead of dropping the chunks on top. Finally, I will make a less thick blueberry sauce to accompany the dish by adding more water and less corn starch. These changes should make it teaste more like french toast, I hope!

Made this for Christmas breakfast this morning and it was a hit. I used the modifications suggested: 9 eggs, vanilla and cinnamon in the egg mixture. Used 2/3 cup sugar with the syrup. Also, instead of trying to cut cream cheese into little cubes, I just pinched off pieces with my fingers and dropped it onto the bread. It was awesome.

This was crunchy/hard on the outside and soggy in the middle.. just got worse the more I cooked it.  Not edible. I'll be sticking to the traditional way of making french toast from now on.

I brought this to the Christmas breakfast at our church and it was a hit! I cut my cream cheese in very small pieces and sprinkled some cinnamon on after each layer of bread. I read several reviews that said what to change, but honestly there's nothing I would do differently!

I cut back the eggs in this to 9 and added vanilla and cinnamon as well.  Also, the cream cheese is better cut into very small bits as the 1 inch cubes are too rich.  I used mixed berries as I had no blueberries.  It's great for large family breakfasts like Christmas when you don't want to spend too much time in the kitchen and it's a real crowd pleaser!

I always like to make breakfast ahead when company is over.  This was great; a nice change from my usual egg/sausage or oatmeal casseroles.  I followed the recipe to the letter.  I will definitely make this again.

I tried this recipe for my daughter's slumber party last year.  It was ok.  This time, I reduced the eggs to 8 eggs, added 1 tsp. vanilla, and eliminated the cream cheese.  My family loved the variation. This will be a keeper for special days and, especially, Christmas morning.  Thanks!  :+)

Wonderful!  Served it to overnight guests this weekend on the patio and my neigbor called later to get the recipe because he could smell the aroma!  I added more blueberries, 1 tsp vanilla, pinch of salt and grated the rind of one orange into the egg mixture.  Thanks Robin!

This was not to my liking. It was very bland. You definitely need the sauce, but the sauce was way too sweet for me. I think this recipe would do well with some cinnamon in it. It was very bland. I used a one lb. loaf of bakery french bread, and it was too bready. I think if it was reworked with less bread and maybe the cinnamon, it might be better. Also, cut the sugar in the sauce unless you love sweet!!!

An easy to make treat!  Mine cooked up a little faster than the time called for, so check yours about 5 - 10 minutes before your timer rings.  I added extra blueberries to the sauce as well as some lemon zest and about half a squeezed lemon to cut the sweetness.

This was a huge hit at my brunch yesterday.  I let the cream cheese soften, and then spread it on the slices of bread (I used challah rather than Italian bread), and then cubed it.  I found the blueberry sauce more sweet than flavourful, so I added the zest of one lemon and some lemon juice, which gave it more of a kick.  Everyone loved it!

I cut this recipe in half since there were only 2 of us, and made the following revisions. I've always used Challah Bread when it comes to French Toast (it makes the best). So I cut the loaf in half, weighed it, and it was 10 oz. I got 2 small pkg. of Blueberries (4.4 oz each), and I only used 4 eggs instead of the 6.  I ALSO ADDED CHOPPED WALNUTS. This came out absolutely wonderful!!!! The only changes I would make next time is to make more sauce and add more walnuts!!!! And believe it or not, having a piece hot and the other luke warm - I much rathered the luke warm piece better. I just zapped the sauce in the mic to heat it up, but I found you could actually taste the flavors more when it sat for a little while!!!!

Made this for Christmas Brunch with a selection of other dishes... it was very good, but not fabulous. However, the Asparagus Quiche recipe on this site was deemed fabulous by all who tried it! Will try the french toast again, as I think it has potential. Plan to use egg bread (Challah) next time for more flavor.

I don't know what I did wrong, but this recipe turned out horrible.  I am sure it was my own fault.  Parts were soggy and parts were dry, it wasn't good at all.  The sauce, however, turned out wonderful and everybody liked that.  We ended up making regular pancakes and eating the sauce on those instead.

This dish turned out great! I used bakery fresh Artesano bread and removed the crust. I cut that into cubes. I cut back on the eggs and just used 10. I mixed some cinnamon in the batter which was perfection! I coated my pan in butter before adding the bread and mix. The sauce made it extra good and my husband said it was even better than his moms! Which is where I got the original recipe. All smiles.

Exceptional!  I took the cream cheese and blended it with 1/2 cup sugar and 1 egg to make it like a cheese cake filling.  Delicious!!

Great recipe!  I used more blueberries than the recipe called for and only 1 1/2 cream cheese - sprinkled cinnamon on as well before storing overnight.  Delicious!

It was great!  However, I reduced the eggs to 8, reduced the cream cheese to 4 oz, and about 3/4 lb bread because I didn't want to make 12 servings.  Sprinkled cinnamon sugar over top  and baked 30 with foil on, and only 15 minutes without.

Sooo good! Great to make the night before a big day like Christmas morning, hosting a brunch etc. I didn’t use as much cream cheese and added lots of cinnamon as the previous poster suggested. Great recipe!

I made it without the blueberry sauce for the top and it was still delicious.  Although I'm sure it would have been great with the sauce too.  I would be more likely to call it a bread pudding than "french toast" though.  Keeping this one.

This is now a family tradition in our house every year at Christmas!
I make it the day before and pop it in the oven after we open presents.  I make the sauce with just a tiny bit of lemon juice and a TINY little squirt of vanilla flavoring to help the overall sweetness.
I use Challah bread, which is amazing!
The only recommendation I have is to double the glaze sauce as people use quite a bit on their serving since it is SO good!!

Very good recipe!  I made it for a fishing trip Memorial Weekend and everyone loved it.  I wouldn't make the topping again, though, as the kids preferred maple syrup.  Will make this again!

It was DELICIOUS..ok to leave out the cream cheese since it's just in chunks throughout the dish..I left it out because I didn't have any..still a delish dish..And to those who like mushy french toast, this is not for you..This comes out great! crispy on top, soft on the bottom and you can cut it into squares to serve...blueberry sauce on top and a sprinkle of powdered sugar..can't go wrong ;)

Double the sauce!! I have been making this the last 5 years it's always a huge hit. Really good with French bread and 8 to 10 eggs  and a little extra milk, and I cut the bread into 1 inch pieces as well as the cream cheese into small bites. I usually make it that morning and not the night before and it works our wonderful.

3 Stars as is.  12 eggs with 2 cups of milk is wayyyy too much for 1 pound of bread.  I used 8 eggs with 1 cup of milk & had to cook it for over an hour.

I made a couple changes. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND USING CHALLAH BREAD. You def want to use a heavier bread for this recipe. I also used a little less then 8 oz of cream cheese. And sprinkeled cinnamon on both layers of cubed bread. In the batter I only used 10 eggs instead of 12. I also added some artificial sweetener, vanilla, and more cinnamon. Tasted world class!!!

Very easy & tasty. I used a mixture of Challah bread with chocolate chips and 1/2 loaf of Baily bread from our local Jewish bakery. After cooking, I found the top to be a little dry & crusty. Next time I will double the cream cheese, add 1/2 cup more milk & use 12 eggs. I also made a blueberry sauce from 2 tbls cornstarch, 1 cup sugar, 1 cup water, 1 cup blueberries that took care of the dryness.

I make this ALL the time when company is coming. The only change I make is I only use 9-10 pieces of bread.. I also soften the cream cheese, pour and spread it rather than curbing it. People seem to like that better than the cubes!

It is easy to make and tastes good. I however decided the second time around to make my french toast batter the way i always do. I add cinnamon and sugar to my batter. The recipe as written seemed to have a very strong egg flavor without those two. The first time I sprinkled the cinnamon over the top. The second time I added them directly to the batter for the over night soak. Much better. You will have to find your taste preferences in terms of additions.

Have to be honest here, I didn't actually taste this myself. Served for Sunday brunch and didn't get to try it, it was all gone! I never even made the sauce, just the casserole part, and it was a big hit. Followed the recipe exact and everyone loved it, thanks for this awesome recipe.

This dish was well recieved, by all the sweet lovers. I used more fruit & less creamed cheese & still found it too rich, with not a lot of flavor. The sauce was needed to kick up the flavor & I used extra berries here too.

This was phenomenal!  Everybody loved it at my church group.  I made some of the suggested changes (lemon juice in sauce, cinnamon in mixture with bread), and I will have to make this again.  SO delicious!

Very tasty and easy to make.  Be sure to use the Italian Bread...regular white bread makes it too mushy.

I followed others advice and used two cups of blueberries in the sauce and the french toast. The only issue I had was that the cream cheese stayed chunky and did not seem distributed well. Next time I will try beating the cream cheese into the milk and syrup and pouring it over the bread. We are also going to try it with apple, peach and strawberries.

The french toast lacked in taste for sum odd reason. Regardless of the fact that I used a sweeter challah bread and added vanilla and cinnamon to the egg mixture. I'm very dissapointed with the outcome. The sauce was the only good thing in my opinion.

I absolutely loved this.  I made it for an office brunch and had none left and no complaints.  The only thing I did different was to follow a previous suggestion of adding cinnamon to the bread layers.  I did not think the sauce was too sweet, it was a nice balance to the lack of sweetness in the casserole.

Wow! If I had a bed and breakfast this would be a specialty! Hubby isn't too fond of blueberries so I added strawberry jam with a few blueberries. I may cut down on the suger in the sauce  next time, as it is very sweet!! Very good recipe, my family loved it, and we will look forward to our next B&B morning in our own living room!! Thanks!

This was great. People were complaining that it was to gooey and didn't firm up. . but I had no problem. I used Italian bread from you local grocery store bakery. The crispy crust from the bread in the casserole was great. I considered not making the blueberry sauce but I'm glad I did. This recipe was perfect for family that came in from out of town. I baked it in the morning and served it with Baked Bacon. That way the bacon was done fast and I didn't wake anyone up! This was fantastic!

This was absolutely delicious! I had soooo many compliments... huge hit! Just because I had some, I added some white chocolate liquor to the egg custard batter which gave it an even sweeter and creamier taste!

Amazing good!! I've made this a handful of times & everyone loves it! I use 10 eggs and add 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon to the milk mixture. And I make 1 1/2 recipe of the blueberry sauce. Perfect! Thanks for this wonderful recipe, it's now a family favorite!

Just okay. Needs tweaking, I thought this would be sort of like a blueberry danish french toast but it wasn't anything even close. We all prefer the french toast bake from this site.

This rating is for the syrup only.  It was delicious.  I followed the recipe exactly and the sweetness was just right.  It was so simple to make and I can't wait to experiment with  strawberries and raspberries.  My only problem was that I must have had the heat a too high because it thickened very quickly and I had to add some additional water to thin it out.

This was a big hit.  I would make again but next time, I think I would omit the cream cheese.  I don't think it is necessary.  It is alreay pretty rich.  The sauce would be great on ice cream or pancakes.

This was a really great recipe, but I defintely agree with some of the other reviews to omit a few eggs.  I used 9 and next time I make this I will probably use 8 instead.  The cinnamon is a MUST!  Since quite a few people said it was a little bland and the sweetness came from the sauce, I added sugar with the cinnamon on the first and second layer of bread crumbs.  I also cut back on the cream cheese using only 8 oz and added vanilla and extra maple syrup to the egg mixture.  It was awesome when all was said and done, but like I said, next time I would still cut back on the eggs even more.  I made this last night for christmas breakfast this morning and it was a hit.  12 servings was more like servings this morning so do be scared to double up the recipe if cooking for more than 12.

This turned out ok.  I didn't use as much cream cheese as the recipe suggested and I think that was my mistake.  I also cut the eggs down to 8 and left my bread in slices.  Will try it again.

i wasn't overwhelmed by this recipe, although my family was.  except my mother. and who can ever please them anyway?  if i did make it again, i would make the bread squares smaller and toss them with the egg mixture, to ensure a thorough coating.  i will use my own mixed berry syrup recipe next time too. more syrup-y.

I made this actually with 16 oz of cream cheese... i put down 1 layer of bread first, then small chunks of the cheese, then another layer and another few chunks of cheese. i did use all 12 eggs and by using a crustier day old french bread it was just the perfect amount of egg. i also used frozen triple berries because I had them for both the sauce and casserole. I used an immersion blender to blend the sauce.

Very rich and tasty.  I took the next reviewer's suggestion to cut the cream cheese up small and I'd do that again.  I think something a little less "dessert-like" is what I was hoping for.  But the recipe itself was excellent.

I made this today as a test run for a breakfast I am having later in the week.  I was incredibly disappointed with the results.  I read other reviews carefully, added cinnamon and vanilla and still found the french toast to be bland and tasteless.  My blueberries were quite tart, but it did not seem that the proportions were at all "on".

This was good.  1 note:  When spreading the cream cheese make them real small pieces and disperse well.  
I used the black raspberry syrup leftover from the raspberry dumpling recipe on the site.  Nice recipe.

I followed the recommendations and they are essential, it was great with less eggs, 1 tsp cinnamon, bit of lemon and less sugar.  I also used Neuchatel instead of cream cheese and it was great with that.

Absolutely fantastic.  Good with either the blueberry compote or just maple syrup.

We had this for brunch Christmas day and everyone loved it.  I wanted to use up my blueberries so I added about 3/4 c extra and it turned out great.

I thought this recipe was "okay."  I felt that is was missing something.  Maybe needs more cream cheese?  Maybe add cinnamon?

This was an excellent and very quick breakfast. I read the reviews from others so only used 1/2 cup sugar, worked out great, not to sweet.  Even my picky teens loved this, will definately make this again.

This was easy to prepare and cooked up beautifully, but wasn't a big favorite of my family.  I felt the sauce was too sweet and light colored needing a lot (2-3x?) more berries.  I oftentimes make fluffy buttermilk pancakes and a sauce to top them that uses a pound of blueberries and my family just prefers that rich fruit flavor to this casserole.  However, yours might enjoy it - the cream cheese is an especially nice addition.

Great recipe... my friends requested it after I took it to my Bible Study.  It is very similar to a Blueberry Danish.  Very tasty.. and easy to prepare.  The blueberry syrup is a nice addition!

Either I did not make this recipe right or it just did not suit mine and my guest taste buds.  Will have to improvise it some (not sure how) if I am going to try it again.

I made this for Christmas breakfast and it was so yummy! I used a bit more blueberries than what it called for in both the dish and the sauce. Next time I will cut the recipe in half, because this will definately feed a lot of people. A perfect dish for a ladies brunch!

This really is a delicious dish!  The use of frozen blueberries made it all the easier!  Plus, I liked being able to put this together the night before and pop it in the oven in the morning.  I served it at a Christmas Brunch and everyone liked it.  I will definitely make this again and pass the recipe on to my friends and family!!

I made this recipe for breakfast over a July 4th family get-together.  I had blackberries on hand, so I used them rather than blueberries. It was a huge hit--everyone raved.

This was excellent, although I substituted cinnamon/raisin bread and used half-and-half for the milk.  Also increased amount of blueberries and butter.  My elderly aunt, who eats very little, had two helpings!  Everyone loved it!

Omigosh!  This is the best tasting french toast my sister and I've ever had.  I included frozen strawberries w/ the blueberries and some extra maple syrup to make it taste even better.  I've already e-mailed it to some friends and family to try it on their own.  Definitely recommended.

This recipe was delicious!  My family really enjoyed it.  It has no added sugar (excluding sauce) for diabetics.  It was a snap to make with really no clean up.  Hint:  I would not bake this in a glass pan - the bottom browned a bit too much.  And I even cooked up the sauce the day before, cooled ii in the saucepan and reheated the next morning - it turned out just as good!
