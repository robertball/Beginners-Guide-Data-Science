I used brown sugar Splenda instead of regular Splenda, rice vinegar instead of regular vinegar and I used fresh chopped green onions instead of onion flakes and fresh minced garlic instead of garlic powder for a fresher flavor. This was okay, but watered down. I think the water should be eliminated and I think the worchestershire was unnecessary. For me, it wasn't very teriyaki.

Terrific Teriyaki Marinade Haiku: "Grilled chicken salad. Delightful with marinade. Just a few changes." I scaled this recipe way back for marinating a few chicken tenderloins, and subbed brown sugar/Splenda blend for regular Splenda (using less), as well as adding a 1 tsp. of sesame seeds. Cooked em on my George Foreman, tossed em on a salad, and it was mighty tasty lunch. But not quite tasty enough to replace my all-time favorite, go-to "Pretty Chicken Marinade" from AR. Different, yes, good, definitely, but I have yet to find a marinade that quite compares to PCM.

This does not begin to taste like teriyaki sauce... even after substituting brown sugar (as suggested) for the splenda.  This should never have been posted as a recipe.  Just awful.
