This is a very good recipe! But be very CAUTIOUS when putting the marshmallows under the broiler! Mine had 45 seconds left of the minute that was re amended with the broiler on low and six inches from it. I opened the oven too see how it was and the marshmallows were on fire! Just keep an eye on it at all times. Other than that it's very good.

This was a pretty good recipe, however, I highly recommend using mini marshmallows instead of large marshmallows. The mini marshmallows brown less quickly and more evenly and they are also easier to cut as they are more in proportion with the size of the bar. I set my broiler on low heat and it took about 5-6 minutes until they were lightly browned. I set mine in the freezer until cold and stored it in the refrigerator between servings. The ganache filling is gooey, so refrigeration or freezing helps for it to set before eating.

Teenagers (6 of them; 15-19 years old) rated this 10 stars. I didn't taste it - it looked like a cavity in the making and I don't like marshmallows. They ate the 13X9 tray in an hour. Not kidding!  I used different sizes of marshmallows because I thought that would make it visually interesting. DO NOT TAKE YOUR EYES OFF IT when it is under the broiler. 1 minute is too long to brown marshmallows. Re-reading recipe today, I realized I forgot the cinnamon. Did not matter to the boys. Good, fun, recipe! Thanks and I took two pix to document it!

This was delicious! My family gobbled it up! The only thing I did different was used mini marshmallows and it worked perfectly. I  put it back in the fridge for the night and the next day we decided that it would be better left out on the counter in a container. Thank you for such a great recipe!

I made this as stated in the recipe. These were much better the next day at room temperature! Very good - a little too much chocolate, but very tasty.  Thanks for the recipe.

I made this today and it was a big hit! I did a few things differently. I wanted mine to be a pie so I used a graham cracker pie crust. This cut out a step too, so that much easier! I also used mini marshmallows and put in the fridge to set. After that we stored it at room temp.

If I had to make it better, I would use milk chocolate chips for the ganache. This is because I am not a huge fan of dark chocolate and it doesn't fully taste like an actual s'more because you would usually use milk chocolate for s'mores. I do like it a lot though.

I tried this recipe earlier today, with a few changes. I didn't have any heavy cream or bittersweet chocolate chips, so I used milk and butter, and peanut butter chocolate chips. The kids ate it up very quickly. They loved it, and so did I! It was an easy and simple recipe for me to make between household chores.

My three kids absolutely loved this treat! I did not use cinnamon as  2 of them wouldn’t have liked it but I’m sure it didn’t detract from the taste. I used milk chocolate for them as well and it was gone in no time! This is definitely a keeper.
