I submitted this recipe after only making it a couple of times.  Since then I have made a few changes that I wanted to share.  I don't add oil to the cooked couscous anymore, and I normally use half a can of lentils instead of cooking my own.  They seem to add moisture to the mix.  Instead of mixing the dressing up first I squeeze the lemons directly over the bowl and pour a couple of glugs of oil and drizzle some honey on top.  Just make sure to mix it well.  It's nice to eat right away, but we prefer it the next day after the raisins and cranberries plump up.

This screams spring to me!  I love all the different contrast of this salad from taste/texture and presentation.  I also used canned lentils that I washed and drained.  I skipped the oil part after rinsing the couscous;  I mean the salad dressing already has oil in it.

It said six but this recipe would easily served 12 happy people.  If you don't like sweet cut back on the honey but I was impressed with the recipe as is - in fact, I had leftovers for breakfast this morning.  YUM!

I have made this salad two times and each time it is gobbled up! One the second go around my boys were over and I caught them bragging to their wives about it as they spoon feed them from the open refrigerator door. They couldn't believe that their father could make something so healthy and good!

I entered my kitchen, after being out all day,  wondering what I could fix for a quick and light meal. This salad hit the spot !
It is delicious and quick to make. I doubled the lentils  for more nutrition. While the couscous and lentils were cooking, I did the chopping of the veggies and made the dressing. There is one thing you need to know, watch the couscous on the stove, cause mine got little bit mushy in 8 minutes. You might need to check yours before the 10 minutes stated in the recipe.

I've made this several times as written and love it! I did cut down on the olive oil as suggested by Susan.

For a savory option, I've also substituted Kalamata olives and Mediterranean feta cheese for the raisins and cranberries and added 2 tsp. of zaatar spice. Equally delicious.

This is a favorite summer salad! While the prep time is on the lengthy side, it makes a lot, and lasts well in the fridge. I did make a couple changes - I omit the sumac, but add 1 tsp cumin to the dressing. To go with the cumin, I use cilantro instead of parsley. It's delicious any way you make it!

This recipe was  a hit for a party I attended for a baby shower.  I'm making it again for my musician friends. I did not change one aspect of the recipe and it was perfect.  I do recommend you make it a day ahead and let the flavors meld together.

Would not change a thing.  Served it at a casual dinner gathering as a side dish.

Outstanding!  I didn't have exactly all of the ingredients, so used mixed lentils, fresh basil and oregano, garlic scares, and crushed chili and garlic pepper own place of a few of the ingredients.  LOVE the texture, the mix of flavors!  Thanks for a great change of pace salad!

I love this salad.  I cooked the couscous and lentils in vegetable broth, rather than water.  The only addition I made was to add in about 1/3 cup of chopped Kalamata olives.  This salad gained flavor as it sat.  I would now make it two days before serving it for that reason.  It is a winner!  I love the textures in this recipe.

I really liked the dressing!  I hadn't worked with pearl couscous before and wanted to make a salad, so this was a great springboard recipe.  I did my own thing with the additives, but kept the dressing as is and my family loved it!

The home-chef who posted this recipe made it for our recent Canadian Thanksgiving dinner. I loved it! And now I have the recipe to make it whenever I like, which will be often.
