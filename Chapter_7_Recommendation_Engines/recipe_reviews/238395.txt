Update 5/13/16: add two heaping spoonfuls of this to your iced tea!! Yum.... Excellent! Refreshing and if you cheat like I did and make this in your ice cream/sorbetto machine then it's also easy! If you use organic fruit you can refill the oranges with the granita for a cute dessert cup idea. Thank you for the recipe.
