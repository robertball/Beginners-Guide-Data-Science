This recipe was fabulous!  I also reduced the soy sauce to 1/3 cup and I cut the peanut butter down to 2 TBSP.  I used 2 boneless skinless chicken breasts cut into small strips. I made it an entire meal by adding broccoli, sliced carrots and strips of green bell pepper, along with the onions already listed in the recipe.  Will definitely make this again!

Absolutely dreadful. I am a huge Thai food fan, & I have never tasted anything like this before. Even cutting back to 1/2 cup of soy, this was far too salty. The sauce was an unappetizing mess. What a waste of chicken.

My husband and I really enjoyed this dish.  Took advice from other reviews and used just over 1/3 cup of soy sauce and topped it off with enough water to make 1 cup of liquid.  I used 2 large boneless chicken breasts, added 1 cup of fresh broccoli. Used Sriracha chili sauce instead of hot pepper sauce. Loved the heat but would not suggest this dish for small kids. Will definitely make this dish again!

Now, I don't mean to hurt anyone's feelings here but this dish is the worst thing I have ever tasted. I must have done something wrong. I used half of the soy sauce yet eating it felt like swallowing sea water. I'm sorry to say: This is not Thai!

Man, this chicken was the utter pinnacle of exquisite!  I loved each and every bite of its peanut-buttery goodness!  My friends and I got ripped, fixed this delightful concoction, and boy was it awesome!  We ate it all in like 10 minutes...then we ordered a pizza.  The pizza was good too.

Tasty, but not worth the pot scrubbing!  would be good paired up with coconut rice.  I might make this again, but it was a bit laborious for the 4 pieces of chicken. I substituted 1/3C of Tamari (like soy sauce, only less salt and I think no MSG--which gives me a HUGE headache!)and added enough water to make the liquid equal 1/2 cup--it was not salty as others have complained, the taste was just right--but what a load of dishes to clean up!

After reading other reviews, I only used 1/3 C of soy. I also used just 3 Tablespoons of peanut butter, which was plenty. This dish had a nice satay style sauce and was thoroughly enjoyed. Others who ate it rated it 4.5 stars.

I made this with the full amount of soy sauce requested.  Mistake.  Definitely cut back on it, possibly to a 1/4 or 1/2 cup, and use water or low sodium broth to make the full cup requested.  I loved the peanut butter flavor, and used crunchy peanut butter to add some crunch!  (Best part of the experience!)  Recipe has potential--definitely need to alter to your taste. :)

This was the most disgusting thai chicken I have ever had.  It tastes nothing like thai.  I served this at a dinner party, and noone ate it.  It was way too salty, and ended up throwing the dinner out and ordering pizza for everyone.  How embarassing, and what a waste of time.......

Very good! Would have been even better if marinated for several hours instead of just one. Followed advice of many reviewers and reduced the soy sauce to 1/3 cup, and saltiness was just right. The sauce thickened nicely and was even better after it sat off the heat for a few minutes, so give it an extra 5 min. to cool before serving.

We loved this recipe! We also made a few adjustments for our taste- reduced soy sauce to 1/3 cup, used sriracha sauce, and only used 4 cloves of garlic. My husband and I are huge fans of Thai food, and this was as good, if not better than anything we have had in a restaurant. My only suggestion is to watch the heat on the sesame oil/ brown sugar step- it says medium/high heat, but I almost had a fire the first time around! It was easy to start over with a new pan, and I just reduced the heat to medium low and cranked the heat up once I had the onions (and added red & green peppers)in the pan. Fabulous- a new favorite in our home!

this is god-awful. WAY TOO SALTY!  If you are going to do it, maybe use 1/3 the soy, or less. I only made it with 2/3 cup of soy, and it was still too much. Salt was the only flavor in the recipe. And then the next day, the leftovers were even saltier tasting. The recipe has promise, but unless you enjoy eating handfuls or salt, I would recommend cutting down the soy. And this is coming from a person who adds salt to most everything I eat!

I haven't experience cooking Tai, so what I liked about this recipe is that it simply breaks down the steps involved to make a good, basic Tai dish.  I followed a reviewers suggestions to cut the soy sauce by a quarter, replacing the rest with water.  I also followed a reviewers suggestion to cut the peanut butter in half.  The result is a very nice balance of flavors.  There's heat, but a lot of flavor too.  I'd make this again.   One thing I did differently is I added a little flour as the chicken was cooking because it seemed like a lot of liquid in the pot, and that made it thicker.

Love it but with modifications. I use less soy sauce and use reduced sodium kind. I am a throw things together and come up with any shortcuts possible kind of cook. I really just kind of eyeball the ingredients and I throw all the sauce stuff together in a bowl and mix up and then pour over chicken and marinade for however long I can til time to stuck in oven and cook. I taste test sauce and make adjustments tasting each time. I like about half the soy sauce making up rest with water and I like more peanut butter and lots of garlic ginger and medium hot from pepper sauce. 

My whole family loves this.

Definite keeper for our family. I proceeded with caution when making this recipe, tasting as I went along. I took previous reviewers' advice and: 1.) Reduced the soy sauce to 1/3 c and 2.) Only used half the garlic called for. Also, I omitted the hot sauce from the dish because not everyone in my family likes spicy food (but those who did added Sriracha in their individual plates successfully). I don't know if this review will count as one that is reviewing something severely altered from the original recipe, but this recipe was awesome. In the future, I'll probably add 1/2 to 1 tablespoon more of brown sugar, either omitting or halfing the water called for (or adding a tablespoon of cornstarch - it would have been nice for the sauce to be thicker) and adding some cilantro instead of the green onion.

This was very, very good but I wouldn't make again unless I used low sodium soy sauce.  I'm hoping that would take away the overly salty taste. (and I'm a salt-a-holic)

My husband and I love Thai food and this recipe is a keeper!  The only things I did differently was reduced the peanut butter to 2 TBS as my husband is not a big peanut butter person and I added the juice of a half of a lime to the water/marinade mixture when it was simmering.  Very tasty and just enough heat.

This is another recipe that I loved, but my husband only liked. I'm giving it 5 stars anyway, cause I seriously LOVED this! I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts snipped into small pieces instead of thighs. I also used slightly less soy sauce. My husband's only real complaint was that this is very salty, so next time I might substitute half the soy with something else. I also only has creamy PB; can't wait to try it with chunky, and maybe a little bit more.

Chicken was very tasty.  I used boneless breasts.  It definitely was NOT too garlicky with the correct quantity of soy sauce.  Perhaps if you decrease the soy sauce you should decrease the garlic?  I thought it needed something more crunchy.. perhaps celery added with the onion?  My 4 kids ages 2 to 8 adored this and wished I had made more!  I will make it again.

Super!  I used 1/3 c soy sauce and doubled the brown sugar as suggested.  The peanut butter wasn't measured but it came out great.  It probably would be even better with a little more hot sauce.

Always anxious to try a new Thai Chicken recipe, but I need to try no more.  We loved this ... the kids not so much, but it was a meal that I chose for my hubby and I ... and we LOVED it :)

I will have to concur about cutting the soy sauce in half because of the saltiness.  On the other hand, the saltiness disappears after a while because the ginger takes over your taste buds - which not a bad thing.

My whole family loved this one. Very flavorful. I used olive oil as I did not have sesame oil. I also used smooth instead of crunchy peanut butter, still turned out awesome :)

This was so salty and had too many strong flavors.  We couldn't even eat it and had ice cream for dinner instead.

Judging from the ratings you either love it or you hate it, we loved it!  You really must cut the soy sauce in half though.

this was really good, I took the advice of others and cut the soy sauce down to 1/3 cup and then filled the cup with water to make 1 cup, I think it could even do with using 1/4 cup soy. I also used sriracha chili sauce. this was extremely tasty using those adjustments

I loved this idea, but I agree that the salt is overpowering. I couldn't taste the peanuts even though I added unsalted peanuts to the recipe. Imagine this: 1 tbsp of soy has 920mg of salt plus 55mg in 5g of pepper sauce and 75mg in peanut butter. I bet it is the soy...so why not use Tamari and only 4-6 tbsp. 1 cup is dangerous! I might also use more sugar and more peanut flavor..and I prefer Thai peanut sauce although it too contains 115mg per tbsp. Good Luck!

Very enjoyable but definitely in need of cutting back the amount of soy sauce and garlic - I used half of each and found it tasted quite good.

wE thoroughly enjoyed this dish.  I made the peanut butter noodles to go with it which made for too much peanut butter but both dishes are delicious.  There were enough noodles  to have for another meal and I took them to work cold.  They were even better the second time around.

I agree that this recipe is too salty. It also has too much garlic. Maybe adding less garlic and another liquid ingredient instead of some of the soy sauce would solve this.

This dish was disgusting.  I even cut down on the salt by adding less soy sauce.  The entire sauce just congealed and got way too thick.

This recipe was great until I added the peanut butter. Then it was so horrible that we scraped the sauce off the chicken and ate it plain. Very disappointing.

I loved this recipe.  Made it for my very picky nephew and he absolutely loved it.  The only modifications I made were to use boneless chicken breasts, low sodium soy sauce and add fresh mushrooms to the mix for the last 10 minutes of cooking, I also added a bit more peanut butter and threw in a pkg of hot peanuts for some extra spice.  I will definitely make this again.

I like my food salty but this was still too salty for me.  I'd cut back on the soy sauce.  But...it was full of flavor and I will make it again with adjustments.  I think it needs more peanut butter.

I had to eventually raise the head because my chicken was still bleeding. I cut back the soy sauce to 1/2 cup and used 3 teaspoons of peanut butter, and  added some honey because i found it to be very salty even with the reduced soy sauce. Cooked the green onions for the last 10 minutes with the chicken to add some flavor. Will not be making this again.

Made this yesterday, came out delicious, I used  Chicken breast cause my husband doesn't like thigh meat. Saving the recipe to make it again for company, will use thigh meat though. Thanks for sharing this mouth watering recipe. Except for chicken breast and reducing soy sauce to 1/4 cup, didn't change anything else. It's a keeper!

Delicious.  Interesting combination of flavors.  And definitely use chicken thighs--they are more flavorful to use than boneless, skinless breasts.

I tried this recipe the other night and absolutely loved it! I also followed the advice of others and used about 3/4 cup of soy sauce and 1/2 cup of water. I also added some veggies like broccoli, carrots, and baby corn. 

I will definitely make this one again soon.

WOW!  This is excellent!  I took others advice and used 1/3 cup Tamari soy sauce and 2/3 cup water.  I also sliced my chicken breast paper thin before I placed it in the marinade.  The chicken absorbed the marinade perfectly and was VERY tender after cooking.  I gave it 4 stars because I think the recipe as written with the 1 cup soy sauce would be too salty.  Otherwise, it would be a 5 star dish!

Way too salty, aside from soy sauce I think the recipe has potential. Definetly a good place to start after I marinated the chicken in it I got rid of the soy altogether and just added water and peanut butter, will probaby cut back on pb too.

This is a great recipe. I would marinate the chicken for more than 1 hour and add some vegetables. Instead of using a Dutch oven, use a large skillet and serve the chicken and vegetables with the sauce.

Took the advice that was in the reviews and cut the soya sauce in half. Marinated it overnight, turned out great and my dinner guests were very impressed.  Definitely will be saving this recipe!

To cut calories, I used boneless chicken breasts, which cooked pretty quickly.  I used Sriracha hot chili sauce, and there was the perfect amount of zing.  Served it with Chinese vermicelli, which worked very well with the sauce.

This came out way too salty, but I think the recipe has some potential if you use low-sodium soy sauce or some less salty alternative to the soy sauce.

Great recipe. I modified it slightly to suit my style. I cubed the chicken before marinating and added lime juice and fish sauce to the marinade. Tastes awesome!

I made this recipe twice. The first time I got way to much peanut butter in it and messed it up.  The second time I marinaded it over night. I used 1/3 cup of soy and 2/3 cup of good red wine. Other than that I pretty much followed the recipe to the letter. It just wasn't that good to me.  I may try to make it once more because it sounds like it should come out a better than it did.  Any suggestions for me?

I made this last night and my fiance already wants to know when I'm making it again.  He loved it...said it's better than the food at the Thai restaurant that we frequent.  The only thing I changed was I used half the amount of soy sauce and hot pepper sauce.  I served it over brown rice...delicious!

Really great recipe, we make it all the time. The only recommendation I have is to use Sriracha pepper sauce as the "hot pepper sauce". I use about 6 tablespoons, which would be too hot for most.

This is something that my husband makes for us.  Like most men, he likes to throw out the instructions, but even he did a great job with this one.  We like it will a little less hot sauce and a little more peanut butter.

Well, funny story - right in the middle of preparation of this recipe, my internet connection went out.  I got as far as the marinade and sauteing the chicken in the sesame oil.  I couldn't remember what happened next, but did recall something about brown sugar.  So I decided to wing it and boil the sauce and add a couple of tablespoons of brown sugar.  I really wish I would have remembered the peanut butter.  As it was, it was okay, but nothing special.  The peanut butter would have been a very good addition, and it would have added alot of flavor and body to the sauce.  Anyway - it's very worth trying!

I made this recipe last night and it was very good.  I used half the amount of soy sauce, but next time I'll cut the amount of peanut butter in half too.  The peanut butter really overpowered the other flavors. Also, I baked the chicken after marinating it, which worked well.

This recipe is not good at all.  It turns out like a thick burnt tasting liquid.  The peanut butter is the only thing that helps to save it but just completely bad.

I loved this!  Very similar to a dish I had at the Cheesecake Factory (although I think this is even better).  I used diced chicken breast, so I didn't have to cook it as long.  I also added an extra tablespoon of brown sugar with the peanut butter, tossed with pasta, and sprinkled on fresh cilantro before serving.

This dish would have been great if it wasn't so salty, maybe not use so much soy sauce??  I will definitely try making this again, but probably test different ingredients to make it less salty.

This recipe was an excellent start.  I used boneless skinless chicken breasts instead of thighs.  I also used light soy sauce, and only a half cup rather than a full cup.  I scaled back the garlic slightly, and added a bit more peanut butter.  I have made this for company and it was a hit served over white rice.

My husband and cousins LOVED this recipe. We marinated longer though but it was really yummy. I am new at the cooking thing but recipes like this make me appear as though I have been cooking since I was in diapers!  Thai is our favorite and this is a great one.  Seeking green and red curry bowl recipes...another restaurant favorite!  Thank you!

Cooked tonight for first time.  Everyone loved it. Decided that the 1/2 cup soy we used what just right - would use less fresh ginger next time. Served over white rice and mixed up a can of LeSeur babypeas/mushrooms and was wonderful.
Will definitely use it again.

This recipe for Thai Chicken was excellent.  My husband and I love spicy asian
 food so it was a perfect dish for us to try.  I love the peanut butter flavor in the
 sauce.  It was easy to make too.  It was a little too spicy for my three year old
 daugther, however.  We plan to make this recipe again and again.

Excellent recipe!  One caution though; Avoid doing like I did and don't marinate
the chicken breasts overnight (I didn't have time to cook them last minute and 
let them marinate in the refrigerator).  In doing so the ingredients really OVERPOWERED
the chicken.  Use the marinate time that Debora suggests.  I'll try this one again,
and it wont blow my socks off this time!  (Thanks Debora)  ________________ jm

After reading everyone's comments, I also only used 1/3 of lite sodium soy sauce and 2/3 cup of chicken stock to make 1 cup.  I used boneless/skinless chicken breast sliced before placing in the marinade.  Only 3 large cloves of garlic were used.  I used 2 tbs of brown sugar as recommended by reviews,  but next time I will only use 1 as I don't like it that sweet.  I used a Tbl of Siracha sauce instead of hot sauce.  Three Tbl crunchy peanut butter were used.  It is perfect.  It will be even better without the extra sugar.

I enjoyed the recipe but did cut back on soy sauce and used low sodium. I used both chicken thighs and breast meat and let it marinate over night. I think Thai red curry paste would have been better than the hot pepper sauce. I served this over a coconut/nectarine infused rice.

This was delicious. I marinated the chicken for 4 hours and it was was very flavourful.  Definitely listen to everybody and stick with 1/3 cup soya sauce.

This recipe was tasty. I took all of the suggestions and reduced the soy sauce. I used sesame chili oil as that was the only variety at my grocery store. I then reduced the amount of chili sauce in the marinade. I do feel the amount of peanut butter was overbearing.

Very, very good. Didn't add the sugar and didn't have time to marinade. Only addition was a couple of glugs of cooking sherry instead of the water, and a handful of peanuts.

I thought this would be really salty because of all the soy sauce (I did use low sodium) but it was really good.  I will definitely make this one again; and it was relatively quick to prepare, compared to many Thai dishes!

I agree the soy sauce needs to be a third of a cup vs. a cup.   I added fresh chopped peanuts to finish it off.  I think it was good but not delicious.

I started with the ingredients listed but after tasting the sauce found it way too salty. I tried adding half and half, water and sugar. It helped a little but was still too salty and not a hit with my family. Won't make it again.

This recipe was great, although I would use less or low sodium soy sauce.  Maybe 1/2 a cup.  I like my Thai food a little more spicy so would increase the hot sauce.  It was delicious and I am definitely making it again.

Ok... This is a pretty good recipe... EXCEPT.... You have to really cut down the salt.  I used regular soy sauce and made by the recipe.  It was way too salty.  Next time i will use low sodium soy sauce and way less of it. 1 cup is just too much soy... Then i'll taste and either add more water or vinegar or something to lessen the salt.  Otherwise, OK RECIPE

This recipe is far too salty and the soya sauce overpowers the other flavours.  Reduce the soya sauce to 1/3 of a cup and add 1 cup of coconut milk to the marinade/sauce for a more balanced flavour.  I prefer to use boneless chicken breasts cut in chunks, and not chicken thighs.  That way, you don't have bones to contend with.

This dish was delicious.  I read the other reviews and used 1/3 cup of soy sauce. I used boneless chicken breast that I had in the freezer and added some carrots and broccolli at the end.  Also mixed in a little flour to thicken the sauce.  My husband loved it.  There was enough for 2 meals for us and then not a morsel was left.

Great recipe! I made a few changes and I think it came out really well. Only 3/4 cup of soy sauce and a diced up tomato to make up the difference. Added Indian chili powder and turmeric for color and kick. And I tossed in a bag of frozen whole green beans to cook in the simmer. You can see an uploaded picture.

I hate recipes where I need to read the reviews to know how to make it properly because I don't always have the time to do this.  Fortunately, I did this time and cut the soy sauce to 1/3 C which still was a bit on the salty side for us.  I omitted the onions since I dislike.  It was good, but I wouldn't make this again. I'd rather search for a recipe that wows me.  I think it could use a bit more hot pepper sauce too.  I really felt like the sauce was more like a zippy version of a beef tips & mushroom dish sauce.

I made an account just to review this. I thought it was great and will definitely make it again.  Like others suggested, I reduced the soy sauce.  I also made this with diced up chicken breast and since I only had a pound thawed out, I used that and scaled the rest of the ingredients down by half.  So really, if you consider that, I'd still have used 2/3 of a cup of soy sauce for two pounds of meat, which would have been too much.  

However, it had a delicious flavor, and was just a little spicy, but had the savory and sweetness of the peanut butter to soften the heat.  I also served it with a korean style cucumber salad and jasmine rice.  Everyone liked it!

Less soy, more water...it works.  My kid LOVED it and has been asking for me to make again since last time...so i did tonight..it was even better!
I accidentally cooked my chicken first, but still let soak in marinate and it still turned about great!

I thought it was really good, strong flavor and needs peanuts on top.  Use low sodium soy sauce for less saltiness.  Great with coconut ginger rice.

I did not like dish at all. After adding peanut butter to the dish it came out too salty. I had to add some honey in dish to enhance the flavor some, however, flavor still was not that appealing.

Very good, but I did not exactly follow the recipe.  Instead of soy sauce I uses Gourmet sauce....found at Costco by the soy sauce.  It has way less salt and already has some sweetness, so I skipped the step of adding brown sugar.  I used 1/2 cup gourmet sauce, 4 cloves garlic, a little ground ginger, 1/4 teaspoon spicy chili garlic paste and a tablespoon of vinegar for the marinade.  I cooked the chicken and wisked 1 tablespoon of peanut butter into the leftver marinade and added that to cook with the browned chicken.  The whole family loved it, even the little kids.

It has good bones, but is way too salty, even with 1/2 the soy. I think I'll substitute broth for soy next time and just add soy to taste. I liked the crunchy peanut butter with all the garlic and ginger.

My families and I's new favorite allrecipes.com dish. This dish is very addicting and fairly easy to make. Like most people i reduced the soy sauce to 1/3 of a cup, and the peanut butter to 2-3 tablespoons. I on the other hand only had 1.7pnds of ground turkey on hand, so i followed all the steps but pouring in the marinade since it was completely absorbed by the ground turkey. I also instead used whole bushing of green onion. In addition i used a bushing of mint leaves, and a 1/2-2/3 a cup of bell pepper or carrots thinly sliced for added texture and flavors. Also if you like it really spicy i suggest adding a couply jalepenos cut in quarters or thrids.

I made this recipe as written and it was fabulous, I ended up marinating the chicken overniight, but it only helped the flavor. The peanut butter gives it that special Thai flavor. Loved it!!

way too much pb. Thank god I seperated the chicken out before I added the pb to the sauce. If you use just a 1/2 tbs. it probably be okay.

This recipe was okay. I probably would not make it again.  8 cloves of garlic was waaaay too much. I would cut back to 4. I also added bell pepper and carrots to the onion and omitted the peanut butter (just cuz we're not fans). Also reduced the soy to 1/3 cup.  Good start of a recipe, just didn't knock my socks off. Served veggies and chicken over jasmine rice.

It was my first time broiling chicken, but it was easy and quite quick. I cooked the chicken a little longer than 20 mins but it definately turned out good ^^ I served it over rice and some bokchoy with garlic and oyster sauce as veggies. Yum yum!

This dish was good over white rice.  As I did not have time to marinade, I cooked it on low heat for 20 minutes.  I adjusted the soy sauce to 3/4 cups, but it was still on the salty side.  I would probably either add a bit more water or make it 1/2 cups soy sauce next time.  Perhaps I should try following the recipe exactly the next time but I would be afraid to pour over all of the marinade into the pan when cooking the chicken.  I would probably cook the marinade sauce separately and have it in a serving cup with a spoon so individuals can adjust accordingly next time.  To give it more of a Thai taste, I might sprinkle on top some fresh chopped cilantro (coriander).

SALTY!!  One cup of soy sauce is WAY too much!  I'm going to try it again with about 1/4 cup- I'm convinced there must be some mistake in the measurements here.

This recipe was very good, but I did cut down the soy sauce a little bit.  I only used 1/3 cup.  I also added carrots 10 mins before the chicken was done.

This was very good. The sauce was very thick so next time I will try to thin it down, but I haven't decided on the best way to do this. I served it with green beans and Asian noodles. My husband, who doesn't like chicken, loved it.

I grilled the chicken and boiled the sauce seperately in a pot because of concerns regarding using marinade for the sauce. This isn't overly spicy, just a good, easy dinner that seems very exotic.

Not the best recipe I've ever tasted, but not completely awful either. Tastes "Asian" but not Thai. Too much peanut butter, it kind of killed the good flavor that it was prior to adding the PB. Sugar should not be added with sesame on anything low heat for any cook that is not well-versed in dissolving sugar in HOT OIL.

Delicious!  Even my kids loved it.  My one daughter said it smelled great in our house after I cooked it.  I even took leftovers to a friends house, but she wasn't crazy about thighs although she did like the flavor.

This recipe tasted fairly good, but did not look very appetizing.  Thai food is usually very pleasing to the eye.  I think I will give this one a miss.   Sorry!

EXCELLENT! I could not believe how good the chicken was. I cut the recipe down to 1 serving and used half tamari sauce and half water. I also added just a few sprinkles of dry ginger because I don't like the taste of ginger. I used chicken drumsticks and they turned out just as tender as could be. Loved the recipe and thanks.

I love thai food and this recipe satisfied me. I also cut the amount of soy sauce to 1/3 c. and added water to the marinade. I added peppers and broccoli to the pan and it was excellent!

My family loved this recipe.  As always I changed it somewhat to fit my family's tastes.  I cut the soy sauce down to 1/3 cup and added 1/4 cup thai fish sauce.  I also cut the pepper down because my kids don't like too spicy of food.  It turned out great!!  Next time I'm going to use boneless chicken breasts cut into strips and add cashews.  This will make it closely resemble a favorite dish at our local thai resaraunt.

I really liked this recipe, but my family could not stand it. I think it will be neccessary to cut the peanut butter in half (especially if you use all natural) because it is a little overpowering.

I thought this was a delicious recipe and my guests at my New Year's Eve party also loved it!
(I served this as an appetizer by cutting the chicken up into bitesize pieces.) The only problem with the printed recipe is that it says "3 ounces of chicken". Someone should correct this. I happened to use 1 pound and used proportionately less sauce ingredients, but it was confusing.
