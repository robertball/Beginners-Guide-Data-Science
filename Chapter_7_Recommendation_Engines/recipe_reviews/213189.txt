Sooo yummy! I just made these and they are so amazing, the only thing more amazing than these cookies is that no one has reviewed them yet! I made mine just a little different, everywhere it said peppermint extract I used almond extract instead and then I also put a little almond sliver inside each one :)

I followed the recipe ingredients but I changed the process.  I baked the cookies first and then filled them.  The dough was too soft to fuss with to attempt filling first.  Great flavor and fun to look at.

These cookies look and taste beautiful!  I got so many compliments on these!  I wasn't able to get 5 dozen, but that's because I didn't roll the dough as thin as the recipe called for.  These were excellent after baking, but got even better the next day or two.  Can't wait to make these again!
