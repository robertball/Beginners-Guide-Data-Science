This is super sweet so you only need a tiny tiny square or you'll feel sick. Make sure to use a very large saucepan because this does expand a fair amount while it is cooking.

My grandmother and mother made this with honey instead of sugar.   It had a wonderful taste as well as this recipe.   Does anyone know the recipe using honey???   I have searched online and cannot find it.   I did have the recipe from my Mom and made it a few times but lost it several years ago.   Can anyone help as measurements are very important for it to work.  Hope there is a kind soul  out there who has the honey recipe.   Either way it is goooooood  :)

Tastes terrific. A wee bit crumbly, but since it's going to melt in your mouth anyway...

My family had a recipe for fudge that was passed down for at least 4 generations, it was always called "Aunt Ruby's Fudge".  I always got confused when I was older and read most fudge recipes, they had marshmallows in it and were much darker and softer than our family fudge, which was harder and sugary.  Now it all makes sense, we were making Chocolate flavored Scottish tablet! I wonder if Aunt Ruby (lived around 1900) was from Scotland?
This is pretty much the same recipe, except we added Ghirardelli cocoa powder to the sugar to make it fudge. (we're from San Francisco, that's our chocolate!) It made a light brown, not dark brown, fudge.
Not at all traditional tablet, but boy oh boy it was good!  The recipe got lost over the years, but this seems close enough to try it out. Thanks so much!
