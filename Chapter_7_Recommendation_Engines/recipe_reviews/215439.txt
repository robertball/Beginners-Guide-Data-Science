Good basic recipe, however I have added cheese on top of the potatoes and then put it into the oven.  I have also put an egg wash on top of the potatoes and baked in the oven - this way there is no need to place under the broiler.

I've been making our shepherd's pie like this since I found Ellie Kreiger's recipe last year.  I add more onion and some chopped celery & bell pepper, and sometimes even some sliced mushrooms, to the turkey saute, along with garlic powder, poultry seasoning and some cajun seasoning as ground turkey can be very bland.  I too add a little grated cheese to the top.  This makes for a delcious and healthy version, plus you can sneak all kinds of veggies into the meal!

Other reviewers suggestions made this recipe extra good. Added the mushrooms, celery, extra onion, and minced garlic. Put shredded cheese over the top and cooked for the last 10 minutes. Will absolutely make again!

My boyfriend and I made this for dinner tonight and boy was I pleasantly surprised!  We did add garlic powder, onion powder, celery salt, paprika, and a few dashes of tapatio to the meat mixture.  Added some cheese to the top before broiling.  And we used a 9x9 dish instead of a 9x12.  Other than that, we followed the recipe to a tee.  I can't believe the mashed potato/cauliflower was so delicious without using milk or butter!  We definitely recommend this recipe!

This recipe is good.

However there is one correction I'd like to make about the description of it on the "daily email". Colcannon with cauliflower tastes good, but it is NOT an "Irish flavor reminiscent of colcannon". Colcannon is mashed potatoes with kale (the Irish call it curly kale).

I really liked this recipe- I've made the same Sheperd's pie recipe for the last several years and wanted something more fresh.

i really enjoyed this variation. So much healthier with the turkey. I actually used beef broth in with the potatoes because i already had it open. I think it gave it a darker taste, which i actually preferred. 
I also took the reviewers suggestions and used a pkg of frozen mixed veggies and also put the cheese and egg wash on top of the potatoes.
(i would have used cauliflower mixed with the potatoes if i had cauliflower on hand, which i didnt. it definitely is an awesome mix together when done though.
Would definitely make this style shepherd's pie again. Thanks for sharing!

Was pretty good, I added Lipton beefy onion soup mix. It gave it a more savory flavor, and still used the ground turkey! Enjoy!

I substituted sweet potatoes for the regular potatoes.  I made them in my InstantPot.  I used a bag of frozen cauliflower rice for the cauliflower and a bag of frozen mixed vegetables for the peas and carrots.  All the frozen vegetables were in microwaveable bags so prep time was reduced.  I ended up only using 1 cup of chicken broth.  I baked it for 25 minutes and had the entire meal ready to go in under an hour.  It tasted great and is wife approved to have again!

Used leftover turkey from a holiday dinner instead of ground turkey but followed everything else the same- it turned out very tasty.

This recipe was okay, but considering the extra veggies, I will try it again.  I added green bell peppers and minced garlic.  I also used an egg wash to brown the potato tops.

I made this a few days after Christmas and my DH and I really enjoyed it. I only gave  4 stars because of some significant changes. I used left over turkey gravy, increased the onion and used left over fresh thyme. In addition, I included left over mashed parsnips with the potatoes and cauliflower for the topping.  Delish!

Everyone loved it! Didn't have peas so used celery and mushrooms. Didn't have Worcestershire so used soy sauce. Used almond milk for the mashed potatoes.

I followed the recipe except for the potatoes.  I used all cauliflower.   Also, I gave the peas their own layer on top of the turkey in the dish.  I baked it at 350 then put sharp cheddar on the top for the last 10 minutes and upped the heat to 375.  It was soo soo soo good!

I used thanksgiving leftovers - and some frozen mixed veggies. Sprinkled with Mitchell street seasoning mix and garlic powder, and since I had leftover mashed potatoes, I used some leftover pot roast broth instead of the potato/cauliflower liquid. Will definitely make this again.

Great idea for ground turkey, but needs more seasoning. I seasoned the meat the second time I made this recipe and liked it.
