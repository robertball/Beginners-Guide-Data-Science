Although the sweet and sour topping was good, the texture and flavor of the meat was disappointing.
Too many cracker crumbs made it dry, and the meat was very bland.  After making this, I compared this recipe to some others and found that, when dry bread crumbs or cracker crumbs were used, the other recipes used only 1/2 cup of cracker crumbs and generally seasonings were added so that the meat wouldn't be bland (garlic, horseradish, worchestershire sauce, etc.)  This is NOT the ultimate meatloaf!

Good. There is way to much sauce. I would half it next time.

This was my first meatloaf and it turned out fantastic!
I did however use ground beef instead and I did not have an onion on hand so I used half a package of onion soup mix and breadcrumbs instead of cracker crumbs, ketchup instead of tomato sauce.  I was afraid that 1/2 cup of brown sugar would be too much because of the ketchup so I used 1/4 cup instead for the sauce and I did not use any vinegar in the sauce...still it turned out perfect!

I have been making this recipe for about 4 years and it is always a huge hit!!  I get asked on a weekly basis but I usually make 1-2 times a month.  I use the recipe as stated except I use ground beef and when it is formed in the pan I take my finger and poke about 3-4 holes through the top down the center, this just allows more of the sauce to absorb.  I also add 3/4 cup brown sugar instead of 1/2 and sometimes I even sprinkle a little on the top of the meatloaf.  When we cut and serve I take the sauce from the pan and we spoon over our meatloaf as a sauce.  Anybody that doesn't like meatloaf definitly try this one, it tastes nothing like the traditional.  Hopefully many more will find this recipe to be great!!!!!!

i had never tasted nor made a brown sugar meatloaf before. this recipe was very easy to make. i followed it word-for-word, and the results were very tasty! the loaf itself was moist and yummy. the sauce was too sweet, and since there was lots of it, i drained if off the next time. i look forward to making it again with less brown sugar. i don't know that i'd change anything else.

Kim, this meatloaf was fabulous! It was so moist, unlike most meatloafs I have tried. I do agree with some of the other reviews that the sauce to go on top was excessive. Literally of course. I poured the sauce over and still had a lot left, so I waited to see if I needed it while in the oven thinking that maybe the sauce would evaporate or absorb into the loaf. It didn't. You could probably half the sauce and it would be fine. But this was still the best meatloaf we have ever had. 

A keeper!!!

Made this for my husband and followed the recipe exactly. I probably should have read the reviews first and omitted the water (it isn't needed) and cut the sugar by half. The recipe is WAY too sweet otherwise. My husband said it tasted as though someone had poured candy all over the meatloaf. We couldn't eat it - what a waste of time and money.

Just wonderful!!!  I did add about 7 cloves of garlic, crushed and chopped and finely diced red bell pepper to the mix.  I also used panko bread crumbs in place of the crackers.  I took others advice and omitted the water.  The meatloaf of juicy and very flavorful.  I will definitely make this again.  It's a keeper!

Wow -- this was the best meatloaf I have ever made, and I've made many recipes! I used lean ground turkey, and bread crumbs instead of crackers. I only had diced tomatoes on hand, no sauce, but I think I will do this again this way -- they chunky tomatoes were fantastic. I also followed other readers' suggestion and halved the sauce, but next time I'll do the original amount (maybe it's less because of the chunky tomatoes). I baked it in a brownie pan in a dome-shape, and would have enjoyed more sauce to cover it. The sauce is delicious! Very tangy and flavorful. My husband HATES meatloaf, and he gobbled this up and went back for seconds! And no ketchup needed! I am adding this to my rotation!

I used italian bread crumbs and only a 1/4 cup water! It is much better with the italian bread crumbs! It has a much better flavor! The best I have ever made and I'm one of those people that doesn't like anything she makes!

I loved this meatloaf! So did my husband. Since lots of people suggested the sauce was too much, I cut it in half -- and had about 1/4 c. left over -- and also used oatmeal instead of cracker crumbs. Moist, with just a hint of sweetness. Yummy!

I used 1 lb. of lamb and 1/2 lb. of ground pork.  I used two slices of dried bread crumbs instead of crackers, and added diced onion to the meat meatloaf.  The sauce was way too watery.  There was also a bunch of grease on top since the meat was a bit fatty.  Next time I might bake it for 20 minutes then drain the fat off before I add the sauce(minus about 2/3 of the water or more).

We liked this meatloaf recipe alot!!  It made too much liquid though so I made a note next time to use 1/2 cup water and maybe a little less brown sugar.

Wish I would have left the water out like reviewers suggested! It was pretty good anyway, I just left it in the oven longer. I'll make this again because it's so easy and I'm sure it will be even better next time w/o water!

I LOVE this recipe, tonight was the first time I used this recipe. I used hamburger meat, it turned out great, meat was moist, glaze on top was wonderful. However, I did not add the water and cut the amount of crushed crackers by half.

This was absolutely delicious! I did make a few changes - I used ground beef, Panko bread crumbs instead of cracker crumbs - and i did poke holes in the meatloaf as someone else had suggested. I did not find that there was too much sauce as someone else mentioned - it was perfect! Thanks for a great recipe!

I should have read the reviews before I made this...  Way too juicy.  Also I learned in future attempts when you put your meat in the pan form a ball that doesn't touch the edge of the pan - you will get better results from the meatloaf and a nice crust on three sides.

This was an easy recipe (especially for a culinary-challenged college student like myself) and turned out delicious! My roommates and I made just the meatloaf part (not the sauce), with the addition of some garlic, and the meatloaf was better than anything we had eaten in a while. I would be careful, as the meatloaf was 'soggy' or very moist, but we cooked it a little longer at a lower temperature and everything was ok.

I made this with ground beef and used ketchup instead of tomato sauce because I love ketchup and can't imagine eating meatloaf without it.  It tasted amazing, the best meatloaf I've ever had!  The only thing I didn't like was the amount of liquid in the bottom of the pan.  Next time I don't think I'll add any water at all to the sauce topping.  Other than the extra liquid, it had amazing taste and texture.

I have made this meatloaf a couple times now.  My husband is a big meatloaf fan. This is very good and easy to make.  Perhaps other reviewers didn't care for the sweet and sour taste, I recommend this.  Another reviewer mentioned the meat overflowed out of the pan, well perhaps a larger pan would make sense.  I bought a wonderful loaf pan from K-mart, made by Martha Stewart.  It is larger than your average pan and works great with quickbreads as well.  Thank you for a super meatloaf recipe !

With the exception of substituting quick oats for cracker crumbs I followed this recipe to the letter.  I questioned the cup of water in the sauce as I thought it was too much water and made the sauce thin but it was perfect.  My son, who would never eat meatloaf consented to take a bite and loved it.  His exact words were, "It's the bomb, Mom!"  For those who aren't in the know, that is high praise.  There were no leftovers so I can't testify to their goodness but I will be making this one again.

Meatloaf never tasted this good.  My friends couldn't believe how moist and "un-meatloaf like" this recipe turned out to be.  Add a little red pepper to it for kick and it's perfect.

Being British, this was an excellent choice of meat, I found it to be very delicious
just  the way Kim has it laid out.  I made no changes and loved it. The kids however
were not as thrilled but that's kids, the adults loved it.

Love this recipe, I won't make meatloaf any other way.  I've been making this for at least 4 years now.  I use ground beef and bread crumbs instead of cracker crumbs.   I also use apple cider vinegar.  My husband LOVES saucy food so I actually DOUBLE the sauce portion and bake it in a 9x13 pan.  We spoon the extra sauce over egg noodles or mashed potatoes.  A huge family favorite, even the kids love this.

DELICIOUS! ..I did however mess up and only add 1/2 cup of cracker crumbs...couldn't tell though..only realized it when i went to make it again and i still had so much of the bread crumbs left lol. I used italian bread crumbs, garlic & herb tomato sauce, and 1 package of mccormick's meatloaf seasoning to give the meat a little more flavor. Not big changes but big results.... this is going to be something i make weekly! The sauce is AMAZING!

Great recipe!  Omitted the water (definitely not needed) and used bread crumbs in place of cracker crumbs.  Next time will cut the sugar in half.  Was too sweet for our tastes.  Always looking for new recipes for lamb and will definitely make again.

This meatloaf is very very good!  One suggestion I have is to leave out the water altogether.  It is already very moist without the water, so I can't imagine it with a whole cup!  My 15 month old absolutely loves it and can't get enough, not to mention my husband!  I have already made this twice, and plan to definitely make it again!

This was good. I made meatloaf "muffins" in my muffin pan bc I didnt have a loaf pan and it was great.  I used Garlic and Herb breadcrumbs instead of crackers and omitted the water for the glaze. The kids and husband all loved it. I used ground turkey meat.

This was very tasty. But very very watery. cut the liquid. I kept cooking and the liquid never cooked off. I made this with turkey and it worked very well. It has great flavor but again, toooo much liquid.

I made this meatloaf last night, which happenend to be the first time I've ever made meatloaf at all and it was delicious! I added a green pepper to it and should have added more salt to taste but I'm learning as I go. Very easy and will definitely make again!

Any meatloaf recipe I've had over the years lacks taste.  I've made this one over and over, always changing things up with either ground turkey or half ground turkey and half ground round.  It's always moist and flavorful.  I make my own bread crumbs instead of using cracker crumbs.  The result is about the same.  Also, I cut back on the brown sugar (I use dark.) because otherwise, it's a little too sweet, and my husband and I like to use horseradish mustard for extra kick.  It's a winner every time!

I've been making Kim's meat loaf for about 7 or 8 years. The best meat loaf ever. The only things I've changed is I use beef, and I don't use any water in the sauce. Fantastic

This was horrible.  The only reason that I am not giving it a one star is because my husband did eat his serving but I just think he didn't want to make me feel bad.  I, however, took one bite and that was it.  The recipe said you could substitute any ground meat so I used ground turkey.  There is something off on the sauce.  I followed the directions and it made so much that it was overflowing in the loaf pan.  I only used half of the sauce (which was really the consistency of water) and then half way through cooking I poured the rest off the top of the loaf.  The meatloaf itself was so soggy when cooked through.  I am sorry but this recipe just didn't work or taste well.

Excellent recipe! I did make a few changes though. I used 1 lb beef & 1/2 lb ground pork. Also, I felt the quantity of the sauce was a bit much, so I used 1/2 C water and 1/4 brown sugar (left the original measurements with the remaining ingredients).

This was a great recipe.  My husband LOVED it.  It was very quick and easy to make.  I didn't have any tomato sauce on hand so I substituted it with ketchup.  It still turned out delicious.  Next time I will use the tomato sauce and I expect it will taste even better.  I gave a copy of the recipe to my mother who is eager to try it.  Thanks alot for such a great recipe that will remain in my family for years to come.

My husband and I loved this recipe. I used half ground turkey and half ground turkey sausage and used stewed tomatoes instead of tomato sauce. My husband even said "I didn't know turkey could taste so good". This recipe was great and easy. I will definitely make again!

This is delicious! I  suggest double the sauce recipe add 1/2 the water, put some of the sauce in the meat, pour some over the loaf & heat up what's left of the sauce & pour over individual servings! Im about to eat this entire loaf to myself & Im not exaggerating. I made it with ground beef & the ingredients I had on hand I used dijon mustard & I think it gave it an even better taste. Also I used traditional pasta sauce, it is prepared with a few herbs in it. I think the minor difference in ingredients I used made a huge difference in flavor. & I will be cooking it again!! sticking with the original recipe & the closest ingredients I have, I'm just uping & thickening that yummy sauce & putting some in the meat, my only adjustments. Oh & I used saltine crackers, it wasnt specific but if it said bread crumbs I'd have skipped this yummy meat loaf. It's so good!! This is my first time making meat loaf & this is now my go to recipe. I have never had a better meatloaf, I love the flavor of the mustard & sugar.

Hmmm...does minced lamb take longer to cook than does beef?  My meatloaf was undercooked after 80 minutes in the oven.  I agree with other reviewers that there was WAY too much sauce and very watery.  Perhaps using ketchup or part ketchup instead of sauce would help.  I did cut the water in half, but it wasn't enough.  The sauce barely fit in the pan with the meatloaf and then was too runny and greasy.  I may try this again, but with many adjustments.

I made this exactly as listed except I used ground beef instead of lamb.  I must say I was disappointed.  I have to agree with others that the water should have been omitted.  Even then, though, I'm not sure this would have been a keeper. It just didn't have that zing or tongue "WOW" factor.

I took the advice of another reviewer and changed this to make it my own and it was fantastic so I am not sure how it would taste made exactly the way it was written.  This is what I changed/did; I used ground Turkey, used a white onion, exchanged tomato sauce for Classico pasta sauce, exchanged crackers for 1/2 cup Italian bread crumbs, used tarragon vinegar, used Dijon, added a fine chopped green bell pepper, 4 garlic cloves and a tsp hot sauce. I also left out the water.  Best meatloaf I have ever made and my husband loved it and he isn't a big meatloaf person.

I bought some ground turkey and wanted a new recipe to try - tired of the turkey meatballs.  I made this last night and it is delicious.  I omitted the water; substitued bread crumbs for the crackers and ran out of onion so, I used onion powder instead.  I also added some garlic.  Yummy!!!  Thanks for sharing.

This recipe is very flavorful, moist and delicious!  I love the sweet-tangy sauce and like another user suggested, I put holes in the loaf using my finger, then poured the sauce over it. Doing this allows the loaf to absorb a great amount of the yummy sauce.

I started with this as the basic recipe but made lots of changes, and it came out fantastic. I used ground turkey and 2 eggs instead of 1, and cut up the ends from a loaf of crusty bread instead of using cracker crumbs. I added 2 stalks of celery, and I put about 2-3 tbs of ketchup and 1 package of french onion soup mis in the meatloaf as well to give it extra flavor. I didn't make the tomato topping, but topped it with french onion soup mix and sour cream instead since i was serving it with borscht. Ok so basically what I made turned out to be a completely different recipe than this one! But it came out very good for my first meatloaf attempt!

I used turkey and this was very good. I did use less water as suggested by other reviewers, and even then I still only used half the sauce on top of the meatloaf. Also, I used tomato sauce that already had garlic and oregano in it - it helped to add more flavor. Yum!

This recipe turned out delicious. I was hesitant to make it because I hadn't made a meatloaf with these ingredients before (like vingar, brown sugar etc.) but it turned out great! My husband loved it, and my daughter clamored for more.

This is my husbands favorite meatloaf.  I use ground turkey and less brown sugar than the original recipe calls for.  Really easy, and really tasty.  It does make quite a bit of sauce, so don't use a loaf pan that's too small.

We did this for Christmas brunch - and I got more compliments than I usually get for doing the traditional turkey! I made it with ground turkey/1/4 ground chuck. I cut back the brown sugar to 1/4, and added red pepper to the top for some additional kick. The family loved it. My husband did not even need any ketchup for his meatloaf!!

This will now be a staple in our home! I made this for the first time last night.I had unexpected guests and was terrifed it would taste good, but it was a hit! The only change that I made was I used balsamic instead of regular vinegar and I put a bit of it in the meat. I used turkey. I used the water in the sauce and basted the meat loaf with the sauce that was in the pan and this worked great. It actually cooked for about 1 hr 20 min. This is a great recipe! Just a side note, this is the first meatloaf I have ever made. Thank you.

Really enjoyed this recipe. Great complimentary flavors, especially the brown sugar against the vinegar in the suace. Used turkey instead of the lamb, which for me was gold. Recipe makes a little too much of the jus, boiled over in the oven.

I used ground turkey for this recipe.  Added some fresh garlic and italian seasoning to the turkey. Also, for the sauce, just omit the water, and it will turn out perfect.....just plain yummy!

Having a definate twist to traditional meatloaf recipies, it's sweeter and more moist due to the sauce that bakes right in. I used all ground beef, rather than the lamb. I'd definately recommend it as I've been asked for the recipie by people who don't typically 'jump for joy' when meatloaf is being served!

This was my first meatloaf and it was fantastic!  Super easy to make and my husband loved it. I didn't add water, but used a little extra tomato sauce.

This was the first meatloaf i have ever made, and it turned out to be a success.  I'm not yeat 18, and was aprehensive about how the meatloaf would turn out being that i misread the amount of meat the recipe called for and added too much.  But my older sister and my dad loved it.  My mom, who is a lite eater, enjoyed a portion, and my poppop, who is one of the best cooks in my family, was pleased as well.  I thought it to be nice and sweet and it was even more delicious the day after it was made.  I also found that a small can of stewed tomatoes is an excellent replacement for the tomato sauce.  I am currently in the process of convincing my younger sister and my brother-in-law who despise meatloaf to try it.  I'm sure they will love it as well.  To Kim, whoever and wherever you are, your recipie rocks!!!

Delicious flavors in this, made with half lamb and half ground beef. As others have posted, way too much sauce/liquid as written. I think perhaps cutting the water completely is the way to go, if you're using tomato sauce (I used some Muir Glen pasta sauce, worked well); might be that it should have been that water + some tomato *paste*? Not sure, but all in all, will make again with the adjustment of cutting the water.

My family is not big on meatloaf, but I wanted something different for supper.  I used ground beef, and decreased the water to 1/2 cup.  As it was, my loaf pan was almost overflowing.  During cooking I scooped off some of the sauce because it looked like a lot.  But then my family complained that there was not enough sauce!  More sauce would have been good for our mashed potatoes.  Everybody liked it and I will make this again.

Just finished this and made the mistake of not reading the reviews first. FAR TOO MUCH LIQUID!!! That is really my only complaint. Neither my wife nor I like meatloaf and we really enjoyed this. (She's in the kitchen right now picking at what's left) Definitely not your typical meatloaf! Juicy and delicious. We, like so many others, used ground turkey. Next time, I may try either cutting out the water in the liquid or just using part of the overall. And my wife says, "rename it" because it's too good to be called "meatloaf".

I made this meatloaf with ground turkey and it turned out delicious.  The flavor is unexpectedly sweet and tangy – not at all like the typical thick, ketchup based sauce that coats most meatloaf.  I had never tasted one with a brown sugar/vinegar sauce before, so at first bite, the flavor threw me off.  It really grew on me though, and now this is my go-to recipe.  Just beware if you're expecting mom's downhome meatloaf, because this is much more exotic.

I used turkey and followed this recipe to the letter but it was very disappointing.  This was the first time my kids didn't want dinner and my husband took forever to finish his.  There was too much sugar and too much liquid but not enough flavor.

I've never made meatloaf but this was amazing! I used turkey, decreased water and sugar amount. I substituted 1/4 c of the bread crumbs for wheat germ to make it healthier. It was super moist, not stiff at all. Melts in the mouth!

Delicious for my first turkey meatloaf! Since I didn't have much meat on hand, I added lots of steamed carrots and peas to bulk it up. I used half white vinegar-half balsamic vinaigrette for the sauce topping and the whole thing was scrumptious!

Easy to make recipe. Made some alterations such as using turkey and added some additional spices. The meat itself was great, but the sauce was too sweet. The again, I don't like to taste "sweetness" on ground turkey. Recommend to either cut down the sugar or not have it at all. A little tomato sauce as a topping works well!

My family loves my meatloaf, but this is by far the best recipe ever.  My husband did not care for the sauce, but the kids and I loved it!  Tastes even better as leftovers.

Tastes good but why is it swimming in sauce? We literally called it meatloaf soup. I used lean ground beef (2 lbs) and only 7 crackers worth of saltines for crumbs. I kept the other ingredients as is.

Depending on your tomato sauce, use less water in the sauce

I used 1/2 cup of water and ground lamb.  It was delicious and I will definitely make it again!

Great basic meatloaf recipe. After reading the recipe thoroughly before I prepared it, The volume of topping appeared to be more than was necessary. I adjusted the recipe by adding a half a pound of ground pork and 6 ounces of ground beef. Because I like oregano with my lamb I added a teaspoon of Mediterranean oregano. I used a two pound loaf pan, I had 1/2 inch of space for the topping. Shrinkage will allow the volume of topping to seep into meat.

This was really surprisingly amazing   The sauce on top seeped into the (lamb)loaf making it so tender. I didn't have crackers so I used seasoned wheat bread crumbs. I also added sautéed onion and chopped garlic  to the meat and a little squirt of ketchup to the sauce along  with a can of tomato paste didn't  understand what type of mustard it was calling for so I used golden cuz I had it. It all worked out perfectly yummy!

Very good-we all loved it!  I used 1 pound of  ground lamb and 1 pound of ground beef. Added an extra egg a little extra crackers some garlic powder and Italian spices.  Used the sauce as written and made it in an 8 x 8 pan. Perfect amount of sauce that way - and we devoured it.

I have been making this meatloaf for a couple of years now, everyone loves it. I do not add the water and not a whole cup of crackers.  Turns out moist and yummy every time.

I've tried this with a meatloaf meat mix & plain ground beef & it was great both times. We do prefer a different topping over this after trying the first time but it was good as is. This will be my go-to basic meatloaf recipe from now on! Thanks Kim!!

I've been making this for a few years now, and everyone who has tried it loves it. Not sure why it calls for water in the sauce. Leave it out. It doesnt need it and makes it way too runny. Otherwise perfect. I also add a little A-1 to the sauce occasionally to add a little kick.

Interesting how some think it is too sweet and some add more sugar.  Some thought it was so moist and others felt there was too much sauce.

Absolutely amazing!!  Like previous posters, I cut the water by 1/2 but kept the other ingredients the same.  I subbed low fat ground beef for lamb as well.  My whole family loved it!!

This is my husband's favorite meatloaf!  I use 2 lbs ground beef and keep all of the other measurements the same.  I use balsamic vinegar in the sauce, pat the meat into a square glass pan with an indent in the center, then poke holes with my finger throughout so some of the sauce soaks in.  Bake it for 1 1/2 hours at 375. Wonderfully sweet and tangy and the sauce goes great with mashed potatoes too, which are a must with meatloaf in our house!

Nice gentle sweet flavor, I didn't have cracker crumbs off hand, so I just used regular bread crumbs instead.  Yummy!

The sauce in this recipe is definitely off.  Too runny, and very bland.  I would not recommend this recipe.

A interesting sweet taste; maybe cut back on the sugar a little.  I used ground beef, not lamb.
