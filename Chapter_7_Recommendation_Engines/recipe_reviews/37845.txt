If you like blue cheese, this recipe is INCREDIBLE.  I cook the green beans in the microwave, and the entire preparation, cooking, everything, takes 10 minutes or so.  Believe me, if you love blue cheese like I love blue cheese, you owe it to yourself to make this recipe!

This is a different yet very simple side dish.  I love blue cheese, and it really makes this dish taste great.  I'll definitely make again.

This is a really neat combination of flavors.  I made it for a potluck.  I put the dressing on the beans and onions, added the cheese just before leaving for the party, and the toasted pecans just before serving.  Excellent when fresh and leftovers were tasty too.

This is a great salad!  I use a little less blue cheese to cut the calories a little bit and mix the salad dressing using the lower fat recipe.  I love to keep this in the refrigerator to snack on.
