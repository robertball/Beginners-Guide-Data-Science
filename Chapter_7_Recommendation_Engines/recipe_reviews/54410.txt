This is my recipe, so I didn't wat to rate it but I had to in order to post this comment. I made them last night and added a tablespoon of ginger puree to the meat mixture and it was delicious. I made just a half batch because there were only 6 of us and they were gone by 9pm!

I used crushed pineapple juice.  Kids liked it but I was not impressed.

OMG! Did I read that right...2 cups of vinegar???  The only way to make this edible was to wipe the sauce off the meatballs.  Nope, will not make this again.  Sorry!

Big hit EVERY TIME! I have ommitted the waterchestnuts only beacuse they were basically in the meatballs to give texture, as they dont give any real taste to the meatball...but thats just my opinion. But they are a huge hit every single time i have made them!

I only used 1 cup of vinegar, added a can of crushed pinapple in place of the juice, only 1 cup of sugar and added a can of diced tomatoes. Next time I will cut back on the ketchup as well.
