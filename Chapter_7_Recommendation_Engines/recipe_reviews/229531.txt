I used this recipe for kids party and all the little monsters loved these!! Make sure the pastry sheet covers the whole sausage or hot dog (do not let the tip show too much) as the pastry will shrink when baking. If the dough is too sticky which will lead to a pastry too crumbly to handle, just simply put one or two more cups of flour into it ( i used whole wheat flour).

It's too flaky and it falls apart easily.

For my first time making this, Iâ€™ve learned that I need to flour the surface a bit more thoroughly, that the dough is more delicate than my usual pie dough, and the mustard flavouring is amazing! Loved it
