This was the first time I tried this recipe and it was awesome!  I used mashed potatoes, stuffing, cranberries, and turkey & chicken and they didn't disappoint.  It takes 20 min. of prep and 20 min to cook when I made them.  I used jar gravy to dip them in and they were great!

Easy and delicious. I don't know why I never thought of doing this before. They remind me of my father's pasties of ground beef and potatoes but with a holiday twist. So so good! Thanks for sharing, Anna.

Yummy. yummy, yummy! My husband and I will surely make these again.  I did not any mashed potatoes leftover so I added 2 TBS of stuffing, 2 TBS Turkey, and 1 TBS  Candied Sweet Potato.  (we like our cranberry sauce cold and on the side).  Served this with a pitcher of hot gravy.  Packed with flavor these were delicious.  I will make them again with other fillings to.
