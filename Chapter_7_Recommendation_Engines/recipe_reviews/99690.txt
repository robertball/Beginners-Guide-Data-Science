Excellent and fast!  The lobsters were great - I ate without using butter - the olive oil added a great, less fattening taste.  Will definitely make again.

I'm a real lobster purist; broiling lobster tails with anything other than butter and paprika was something new for me. I was okay with the olive oil, unsure about the lemon-pepper seasoning, but was open to trying it. As I expected, I really was fine with a light brushing of olive oil on the meat as it helped keep it moist during the broiling process.  I did NOT like the lemon-pepper seasoning, however, which for me dominated the rich flavor of the lobster that is so good all on its own.

Everything the recipe boasted it true.  This was a very simple and easy recipe and didn't take but a few minutes.  I was concerned because I had these partially frozen lobster tails, but this recipe was perfect for them.  They turned out moist and delicious.  With a little fresh lemon served on the side... perfection!  Thanks for a delicious, quick, and easy recipe.

Good!  I didn't have lemon pepper but I used course black pepper and squeezed lemon juice over when I served them.  I also cut off all the soft inner shell and left the hard bottom to leave more meat exposed while broiling.  Some of the family didn't like the texture of them broiled and prefers steaming them.

My oven doesn't work well so I basically turn it to 450 degrees and that's my "broiler".  These were without a doubt the BEST lobsters I've ever made.  Ours were quite large - about 9 ounces and I didn't even take care as to the application  of the olive oil.  I also goofed up and cut the bellies not the backs!
Sprinkled with both garlic pepper and lemon pepper as I goofed up and grabbed the wrong bottle first.  No, I wasn't even drinking!  Just tired I guess.  ALL I CAN SAY IS ABSOLUTELY PHENOMENAL AND done in ten minutes flat! Oh, I should also add that I always place a metal skewer through the entire length of the tail so nothing curls.  It's a helpful little technique.

Yum!  I was drawn to this recipe due to the use of olive oil instead of butter.  I didn't have lemon pepper so used black pepper and squeezed a fresh lemon over the tails.  I think that 10 minutes is too long of a cooking time, when broiling lobster I find that just over one minute per ounce works- I cooked mine for 8 minutes and was happy with the end result- done but not tough or rubbery.  Thanks so much Beach for sharing this recipe with us!

We tried this and it was delicious!  Our lobster tails were 5 oz. each and I didn't have lemon pepper, so I did the olive oil, some sea salt and white pepper with a little drizzle of lemon juice.  My oven has 2 settings for the broil, hi and low, so I did it on low for the first 2 and hi for the second set...Hi is most definitely the right setting for the broiler.  Also, I was super careful to only put olive oil on the exposed meat, not on the shells, and I didn't have a problem with them smoking at all.  Definitely will be using this again!

Four stars rather than five, because I believe seasoning with the boldly flavored lemon pepper would overwhelm the wonderful, sweet taste of the lobster. A little butter, which I used instead of olive oil, is all you need.  Otherwise,  the directions for perfectly broiled tails are right on.

Wow!  Delicious and so simple.  We live in the Yucatan and I was recently given a bag full of little lobster tails,  and this recipe jumped out at me.  They were simpy delicious.  We accompanied them with melted butter and garlic. THANK YOU!

I never cooked lobster before, but this recipe was simple and easy to follow.  Delicious every time. 

The recipe is good as is, but the second time I brushed the lobster meat with butter and bay seasoning (just a pinch) after adding extra virgin olive oil, and I thought they came out more flavorful.

Worked exactly as expected.  You can of course substitute some other (e.g. infused) oil for the olive oil, and some other seasoning (e.g. creole) for the lemon-pepper.  I agree that rubbing a small amount of oil on like this is a great alternative to drenching everything in butter (even aside from the cholesterol and fat issues, not everyone likes or can eat dairy, and lobster has such a delicate flavor, butter can drown it out easily).

Never having had 'broiled' lobster tails, this recipe intrigued me. After reading the reviews, I decided to try one tail brushed with plain butter and the other brushed with olive oil, then salt and peppered. I did not notice a major difference in the two. The only constant was that I had both with a little lemon and garlic butter. That was just a given, and I enjoyed them. I broiled for only about 8 min and enjoyed them as a nice pre-Lenten treat. Thanks for the recipe Beach1990!

Very easy and very good.  We had large tails, so it took a bit more time, but all was good.  Just keep an eye on them.

This turned out great! We had it as Christmas Eve dinner and my husband raved. We added a little lemon juice to finish them off.

I like to brush butter on top of the tails and add one quarter inch of water to a lipped baking sheet then broil. This prevents smoking and burnt tails.

I made this w/o the lemon pepper.  I used clarified butter to paint it prior to broiling and after!!  It worked well, lobster tops MUST be at least 6" below broiler elements.  Mine were about 8".  Further is better than closer. Tails were about 8oz and took 12 minutes with broiler on high.  The recipe does not state which setting,  I used high.

I broiled 1 8 ounce lobster tail on low for 10 minutes. While it was very moist I found that the lemon pepper, I used just a sprinkle, overpowered the delicate flavour of the lobster. I may use the cooking method again as it was super easy but I will choose a different seasoning.

The frozen lobster tails turned out tender and succulent.  The lemon pepper added a nice flavor. I made the recipe as written and it was fast and easy. I  paired this with Allrecipes.com lobster dipping sauce. Delicious dinner!

Since I don't care for Lemon-Pepper, I used Lemon-Dill seasoning instead, and the lobster was absolutely delicious.  I agree that bRoiling is the easiest way to cook lobster tails and is much better than BOILing them.  I would also like to add that bRoiling limits the lingering fishy odor to just part of an evening.  Previously, when I boiled lobster tails, it was days before friends stopped making fish monger jokes!

This was so quick, easy and absolutely delicious! I did use butter, garlic sea salt and pepper. I split the backs open(better presentation), so you could see the meat cook. I put the rack on the 2nd setting for 6min for the little ones. PERFECT! Thank you "Beach", couldn't have made them without you

I followed the recipe to the letter, but the lobsters were under-cooked in the middle and the shells were already beginning to char. I wound up cooking them at 350 for another 10 minutes, but I think that was a little too much, and they wound up a little rubbery. I guess this recipe doesn't account for particularly thick lobster tails maybe.

As a first-time lobster cooker, this recipe was not intimidating and made for a simple & delicious way to broil lobster tails.  I followed the directions to the letter, and it was perfect. Thanks!
