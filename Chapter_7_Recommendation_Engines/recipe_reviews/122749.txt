This is a tasty and versatile recipe! I used 4 of those single serving drink mixes and 3 cups of soymilk (no sugar needed) and it was delicious. I used raspberry white tea and vanilla soymilk. Delcious!

Oh my goodness. This is good stuff. I followed the recipe exactly and used cherry flavored drink mix-- incredible! I could not keep myself from diving in even before it was totally frozen. Of course, the flavor is going to depend a lot on the drink mix you choose. I used skim milk and it still worked great. Sherbet is generally made with 1% to 2% milkfat-- anything more than that is considered ice cream. If you're looking for an easy sherbet recipe, you've definitely found a keeper here!

Very very very good! Definately will be making it again but with less sugar. You have to have a sweet tooth for this one!

Great. I was a little hesitant about this because it almost seemed to easy! But it was really good. You can really get creative and try different kool-aid flavors. Delicious!

OH MY GOODNESS GRACIOUS!  This is so wonderful and easy to make.  I used light vanilla soymilk and blue raspberry lemonade Kool-Aid.  Some of the sugar wasn't necessary because of the sweetness of the soy milk.  Blue raspberry is one of my favorite flavors (juvenile, I know :) and I have never tasted it in an ice cream.  Thank you thank you thank you!

The first time I tried w/orange flavored drink mix.  Tasted way too artifical.  It's such an easy recipe and there are some many varieties of flavors in drink mixes I gave it another try.  This time I used lemonade flavor and I grated lemon peel of 1 lemon into it.  So much better and adding the lemon peel gave it a fresh taste.  I've found the flavor I like and will make it again.  Used my ice cream freezer and the texture came out great!

I'd been looking for a recipe like this for a long time. My grandmother would make this for my sister and I when we were little, only in popsicle form. 

I have to say that it was better when I was a kid. OR, Grandma must have used full cream when making this. I used whole
milk and honestly, it wasn't that good.

I'll stick with 5 Minute Ice Cream.

We followed the recipe with the slight change of using a cherry flavoring rather than orange. It was fairly good, but not what I was expecting. It wasn't much like sherbet and the taste was a bit odd. My sisters on the other hand said that it was awesome.

I love this recipe! I was looking to make blue sherbet for my daughter's birthday party and this was perfect with Berry Blue Kool-Aid. I made it in my ice cream maker and it turned out wonderful.

Ok, first off, I put in lemon drink mix, and it was way too strong! And it said it'd harden in about an hour, but it took over night, and I still didn't care for it.

The texture wasn't great.  It ended up going straight from liquid to solid, not creamy. It doesn't keep all that well in the freezer. The flavor is good.  Tastes like kool-aid!

Pretty Good.  I used the wrong flavor of kool-Aid though and it kind of looked and tasted like medicine.  I'm sure it would be really good in a different flavor.  My younger brothers LOVED it!

I wanted so badly to like this because my daughter and I had such a good time making it together.  Choosing a flavor, mixing and measuring the ingredients and waiting for it to freeze were lots of fun, but the flavor was.....I don't want to be unkind so I'll just say it was disappointing.  So much so that we discarded it after one spoonful each.  I'm still glad we made it because I love to have my daughter help in the kitchen and kids learn just as much from recipe failures as they do from successes.  So five stars for fun, one star for flavor.

I made it with orange flavored Kool-Aid. Instead of sugar I used sweetened condensed milk and 3 cups of 1% milk. It was a little too sweet (because of my substitution) so I added 1 more cup of milk. I was looking for more of a dreamsicle flavor so I added 1/4 packet of pink lemonade and 1 t. vanilla extract. YUM!  I poured the mixture in freezer slush mugs and they were done in 30 minutes after stirring every 10 minutes. My suggestion is to mix it and taste it. If it is too sweet add more milk, if too tangy or tart, add vanilla or a pinch of salt. Don't freeze it if it doesn't taste right. It won't taste different when frozen. Also, these would make awesome popsicles! I'm going to try this with yogurt instead of milk.

Thanks for the recipe!

It's great, but mine tasted like bubblegum (probably because I used purplesaurus rex kool-aid. Have you tried adding fruit to this? It's so easy I'd love a big kid version.
