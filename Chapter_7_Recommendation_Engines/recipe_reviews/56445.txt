Lemon 'tea' is the best thing for a sore throat.  It kills bacteria, and soothes the throat.  I do not think you should add the extra sugar, though! And its best to roll two lemons, juice them, then stick a slice of the lemon in the water.  Very, very good! ^_^

Wonderful on a sore throat! I always remember my Mom and Grandmother making this. For some reason, these old home rememdies just seem to work really well - thanks, I'm starting to feel a little better already!

Really good! The honey makes it slide down the throat really nicely and counteracts the sour flavor of the lemon. The lemon, on the other hand, adds just the right amount of tang to keep the honey from tasting sickly sweet. I will definitely be making this again.

When ever anyone in my family has a sore throat or the flu, We go straight for the tea with honey. I boil water and steep a tea bag in a mug and add a tablespoon of honey. Does not need sugar. I usually make it without the lemon but the lemon is good also. Honey is very good for you and is very soothing on a sore or irritated throat and tea also has many benefits too. Great anytime! Thanks Cookin*kth!

Not exactly tea, but nevertheless it was quite good! I actually had to use about 3 or 4 tsp of lemon juice to make it more flavourful. I liked how I initially tasted only honey, but then a pleasant lemon aftertaste surfaced. I'd make this again.

This is great hot but i like to make it over ice, especially over the summer. I start out with a coffee mug and put the honey and lemon in with a little bit of hot water to melt it together. Pour over ice and add water the rest of the way.

I started drinking this while I had laryngitis and the flu, but this week I'm all better and still craving it.  I'm sippin' on some right now, as a matter of fact!  All the ingredients can be altered to taste, so do your own thing with this one. I guarantee you can figure out a way to like it. Oh, by the way, my grandma used to make these with a shot of whiskey and call it a Hot Tottie.

This works great to ease the pain of a sore throat and it tastes great too. My kids hate tea so this is the perfect alternative for them. I used a bit more honey.

good stuff.  Doesn't need the extra sugar as the honey is sweet enough.

We all had a little cough from a cold, and this worked very well at calming the cough and scratchy throats.  It's great because our children are too young for otc cough and cold remedies, and this offered thenm some relief!  Thank you for posting!!

I love lemon water. I drink it during the summer cold, and in the winter warm. That being said, I really didn't care for the honey in this. I'm really glad I tasted it before adding the extra sugar as well, it would have been way too sweet and strange tasting.

This has helped my throat so much. I am so thankful I stumbled across this recipe. I always get the worst sore throats when I am sick because of a childhood illness, and this is the first thing that has ever given me a decent amount of relief.

I love honey lemon tea.  My mom use to give it to me when I had a cold or the flu. Looked this up when my husband and I both got sore throats and colds.  I alter this recipe like others did and added 4 tsp of honey and 4 tsp of lemon juice.  Terrific!

Tastes weak as written. It will be better if you brew a tea bag or green tea bag in the boiling water for 5 minutes,then add the remaining ingredients. Use decaf if needed.  That is a personal preference.

Just what I needed! Light honey taste with a hint of sweetness (used splenda). I bet it would be good with flavored honey such as rasberry honey my daughter loves from our local honey store.

Brings back memories. My mom would make it for me when I had a sore throat. Now I make it for my kids when they have sore thoats. The only thing I do different from this recipe is that I don't add any sugar. Just add honey to desired sweetness. We love it!

I boil the water in an electric kettle and throw in a chamomile tea bag.  After the tea has steeped I add the honey and lemon (I find it sweet enough without more sugar).  The lemon and honey do wonders for a sore throat, and the chamomile helps soothe aches and pains.  Both me and my husband swear by this any time we get sick.  It's amazing.

I get sore throats a lot during the winter, and this recipe  provides a nice change from the regular tea I usually make.  I love this tea.  I omit the sugar and put in equal amounts of lemon and honey (about 1 to 1-1/2 t. each).

I'm feeling absolutely crummy today and this has helped me get through most of my day. I did not add the sugar, the honey was more than enough for me. This really helped relax me and calm me down.

Yeah, I make this all the time for my husband, especially when he has a cold, it's great! But I always include fresh grated ginger because of the many health benefits, including pain relief and a natural cold remedy (something I learned about in India).

Mmmm! This is good. Well, I did deviate a little from this recipe. I didn't add any sugar as it wasn't necessary. And I added a slice of lemon into my "tea". But it was real good. Sweet with a bit of tartness.

This was tasty!  I accidentally used two tablespoons of honey because I made the recipe from memory.  Tasty drink on a Saturday afternoon.

My mom & gramma used to make this all the time when my siblings and I were sick or had sore throats. Minus the sugar. I now make it for my husband when he's feeling under the weather. It's much tastier & healthier without the sugar. And definitely use fresh lemon juice.

I've always made a similar drink whenever I have a sore throat (but without the sugar). It's delicious and it really helps! Although it's definitely better made with fresh lemon juice, it's fine with non-fresh also.

It is 3:40 in the morning and I was desperate to find something to ease my hacking cough.  This worked!!!! This is the most relieved I have felt in 24 hours!  I am not a tea drinker so adjusting this to my liking(a bit more lemon)has been just what the doctor ordered!  Thanks!

I'd have given 5 stars if not for the fact that Honey/lemon isn't one of my favorite flavors, but, I have a bad chest cold, and my throat is raw from all the coughing. This felt so good going down, and I added no sugar.

Used eyeball measurements and this turned out nicely. Much more pleasant than a salt gargle! I did juice nearly the whole lemon though, rather than using just a little bit, and probably will drop the sugar in the future as well.

My throat was in bad shape due to my dry cough and assorted flu symptoms.  Cough medicine makes me sick to my stomach, so I Googled up this recipe.  I can't wait to try it with a shot of whiskey like some of the other reviewers suggested!

Try this, and you'll never buy cold remedy drinks again! As well as relieving a tickly throat, the steam really helps clear out the sinuses too. Like a previous reviewer, I simply add the ingredients to a mug of freshly brewed tea. I agree that no sugar is needed.

This is very good when your sick with a cold...or a sore throat.  I used lime juice and adjusted the honey accordingly. I even made my son sip on some when he wasn't feeling well.  Honey and lime definitely have medicinal value and this tea is very soothing. Even if your not sick, this is very enjoyable right before bedtime. Thanks for sharing.

I always add lemon and honey to my tea when I have a sore throat, but I never thought of skipping the tea bag and just doing the honey and lemon. I think I actually prefer it this way! I probably added 2 or 3 tbsp of lemon juice (a whole lemon) to this though. My sore throat is feeling much better.

Since I have the sore throat of the century right now, I was sitting on my computer searching recipes for mixing honey and lemon together.  This recipe popped up and I made it immediately.  I ran water through my Mr. Coffee which was super easy and used extra honey to sweeten and then more lemon too for flavor.  It's really helping!

Good, easy, comforting drink. This is the second time I've tried it and now I've memorized the ingredients and amount. Pop it in the microwave and its ready in no time. The other two hot lemon drinks in AR have alcohol in it so this one is better for my family.

This is one of my favorite all-time recipes for a simple, tasty, healthy hot beverage. In addition to it tasting just divine, I use it medicinally (without sugar) when I'm ill, and I have a large cup of it after every vocal performance and after every vocal warm-up. Being a professional singer, this is PERFECT for soothing and helping maintain vocal cord health

I like it but it is too sweet even without sugar
I suggest you make it with less honey and without sugar

Cures my sore throat/cough every time, even cured the worst sore throat my mom says shes ever had. She couldn't talk until I gave her this tea. Great job.

Edit: The only thing I don't care for is the extra sugar.

I did mine a little bit different. I poured the cup of water and did 3 tsp of honey, then pit it the microwave for 1 min. And 3 seconds. Then I took it out and mixed in the honey, then added the lemon. I used lemon juice. Lastly, I add the tsp. Of white sugar

I did have to change it slightly. I did a whole lemon and 3 tsp of honey. With no sugar (my mug was quite large). It was lovely, tasted just right. It's really helped my chest and throat, the only thing to work in 4days. 
Highly recommend.

Wow - I was not expecting this to taste as good as it does. What a pleasant surprise. I put a slice of lemon in mine, just for a bit more flavor. I might make this a drink for everyday instead of just when I have a sore throat. Thanks for the recipe :)

This tea is fabulous. I was looking for something to soothe my boyfriends sore throat and decided to try this. He loved it so much he asked for a second cup. I was intrigued so I decided to try some for myself. Sweet and tangy, the perfect mix! I will definitely be making this again. Thanks!

I am a college student and was really craving tea tonight (but of course, I didn't have any tea bags). So I searched on Google and this came up. Definitely tasty. Great substitute for when you don't actually have tea bags. It even tastes like tea. I'm super glad you posted this because I reallllly wanted tea. Haha

I don't really drink tea, this is similar, but a welcome change. Very tasty, and soothed me. No need for the sugar. And a little more lemon can't hurt.

I didn't have all the ingredients listed so I just used Lipton instant tea with lemon.  I omitted the sugar since it was already in the lipton mix!  Left the honey the same! YUMMM!

I'm 7 wks pregnant right now and have a bit of a sore throat, and this has been the only thing that's really helped. I usually don't like honey in my tea, but it's actually not bad in this. I also use some sugar to kick it up a notch. Also, this would be much safer to consume as many times as you like if you're pregnant and feeling under the weather. With tea, I can only drink a couple of cups before starting to feel a bit nauseous; but I could drink this all day! Thanks for posting!

Very good recipe, great for a sore throat! I would recommend adding vodka. Sounds kind of crazy, but it really helps take the edge off if you're achy.

This works great for laryngitis! I had laryngitis and I drank like 3 or 4 of these one right after another, and the next day I was talking. Though I tweaked it a little. I put 2 tbsp of lemon, 1 tbsp honey and less than a tsp. more or less of sugar.

I added two Tablespoons of honey and about 1/4 th of a cup of lemon juice and didn't need the extra sugar. This is REALLY tasty, and I have a sore throat right now and it's really helping me out! Thanks for posting!

Very good. The lemon gives it a nice tart instead of being straight up sweet.

2nd best lemonade I've ever had. =p though I'm a tad lazy and never have lemons/lemon juice on hand so I prefer to just use Kool-aid and substitute some of the sugar for honey. And I work as a beekeeper so I can use REAL unprocessed honey! decidulous.. Fact: take out the sugar and this is medieval lemonade!

My husband does not like tea. I do. I found this recipe a couple of days before my husband came down with a cold. I made him try it for coughing and sore throat and now it's like the only thing he wants when he's sick. I probably made it for him 15 times the first time he was sick. I love to cuddle up with it and read a book no matter if I'm sick or not. It's just great "tea"

Very helpful to me right now since bf gave me his cold and I'm miserably stuffed up with a sore throat.  I made it as the recipe stated, except I started with boiling water--I hate heating water in the microwave; just one of my quirks.  I agree that the extra sugar isn't really neccessary and I like it better with more lemon.  I'm a big tea drinker, though, and surprisingly, I didn't miss the tea.  Thanks for the recipe!

This is excellent and works very well on the throat. My only addition was throwing a teabag in. Mint tea bags are excellent with it too.

I didn't use fresh lemon juice, but it was still good.  It does the trick for soothing sore throats.

Perfect for colds and sore throats. I don't even use the sugar, the honey is sweet enough--I usually add lots of lemon!

Excellent minus the sugar. Hits the spot when one has a sore throat. Thank you.
