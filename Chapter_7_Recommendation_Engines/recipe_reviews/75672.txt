strange to rate your own recipe... but "allrecipes.com" changed it! :(  It's made with 1-3T southwest seasoning.  I use Emeril's.  This is a smokey, chili powder based seasoning.  However, fajita mix is good too.  :)  Also, 2 bell peppers is a lot unless they're pretty small.  1-2 peppers depending on size.  Hope you enjoy!

How could such simple ingredients create such a delectable dinner??? This was FANTASTIC!!! I used 1 & 1/2 lbs. ground sirloin and increased the baked beans to the larger, 28 oz. size can. I added extra chili powder and cumin; about a big heaping teaspoon of each, and about 1/2 cup of beef broth. You absolutely MUST modify the cornbread topping by adding a 1/2 cup of frozen corn and 1 cup of grated pepperjack cheese to the mix before spreading atop the casserole.
It will come out sooooo good, you'll wonder why you hadn't thought of this before! Excellent dinner and it's quick and easy too!

Ok, I really love this dish, but I changed a lot about it.  Instead of baked beans, I used a can of jalapeno pinto beans.  I left out the onion and bell pepper and added a can of rotel tomatoes with a small spoonful of salsa.  And instead of fajita seasoning, I used enchilada seasoning.  Also, for whatever reason, for step 4, I have to cook it at 400 degrees for the cornbread to cook fully.  One last change: When spreading the beef in the skillet, I spread out half, then a thin layer of cheese, then put the rest of the beef down.  Very good!!  All that being said, I *love* this recipe!

I've actually reviewed this once before, but I made it again and I had to come back and up my rating to five stars.  Four stars just didn't do it justice.  I decided I wanted this last night and when I checked out what ingredients I had, I had only the basics!  I made it anyway.  That's how much I wanted it.  And it still tasted good.  Even with red onion, tomatoes, and corn.  The meal is so versatile, so easy, and so tasty.  :)  My favorite part is still the cornbread on top!

I'm re-reviewing this one - gave it 4 stars last time, but this time, 5 stars.  Instead of chopping onion and peppers, all I did was prepare the ground meat (I used turkey) according to the Taco Seasoning packet, added a can of rinsed pinto beans and a can of baked beans.  Added a can of corn and a can of diced green chiles to the cornbread mix.  SOOOO much easier than the original recipe calls for, and I think that the flavor of the meat was much tastier when prepared according to the packet directions rather than how the recipe called for.  We'll DEFINITELY make it this way again, for sure!

I too was skeptical about the baked beans, but this recipe was really good.  I cooked the ground beef, red peppers, and the onion together.  I also used a pkg. of taco seasoning, instead of fajita seasoning.  I added a pinch of sugar and a little water that I rinsed the bean can out with, since some said it was a little dry.  I sprinkled Mexican cheese on the cornbread mixture and baked it in a 9x13 pan for 25 mins.  I served it with sour cream on top.  It was very quick and easy to make; will definitely serve this one again!!

What a terrific Saturday night supper!  I only used 1 red pepper and chopped a bit smaller than called for. I didn't have cornbread mix and had to use those Pillsbury cornbread twists so I thought it would work better in a 9x13 dish. Threw in an extra can of baked beans to have enough filling. Simply laid the cornbread strips  in a grid pattern on top and baked till golden brown. This meal took 10minutes to throw together and it was a big hit with the family! Thanks....this will  be made again, maybe next time with the cornbread mix if I am not feeling lazy!

I call this "Sheperd's Pie with a twist." I read all of the reviews. I thought this was pretty good. Husband loved it. I used 3/4 of a red pepper, chopped about 7 slices of jalapeno's, added a can of diced tomoatoes and a a handful of corn(frozen). I added the jalapeno's, corn and tomatoes to the meat. I only used 1/2 of a package of fajita seasoning. I will make this again. Easy and good despite the unique combination of ingredients.

This dish was the biggest hit at my table. I took the advice to add a drained can of diced tomatoes, and some frozen corn, and I did not use as much red pepper. Also, I practically doubled the corn bread because I had to fill the top of my skillet.  I need to modify that part but otherwise this was definently something I will make again.

Here's the deal. Whip up your favorite chili (hot or mild/beans or no beans/white chili) in a cast iron skillet. Make package or homemade corn bread (or biscuits if you prefer) and cover the top with the mix. You can add corn and/or cheese if desired. Bake at 400° for 18-20 minutes until bread is done and golden brown. One dish dinner. Serve with salad and any toppings desired--tomatoes, sour cream, salsa, etc.

I really like this recipe because it is so versitile and very hearty. I added corn and used only one red bell pepper with one half green bell pepper and added shredded cheese to the top of the cornbread before baking.  That said, there was a little too much sweetness in this recipe.  When I make it again, I will use black beans if I use sweet cornbread or unsweetened cornbread with baked beans.  Otherwise, it was absolutely delicious.

This was a really easy to make delicious dish!  My 2 year old and husband kept saying "Mmmmmmm" with each bite!!! I followed directions exactly except used very lean groud beef and did add a little chili powder--it is a keeper.  Made with lean ground beef--7% fat--it is only 7 weight watcher points for a hearty serving.  Thanks for this recipe!!!! :)

I made this recipe with my favorite cornbread recipe.  I like a sweeter cornbread so I will caution you NOT to use a sweet cornbread, but more of a salty cornbread.  Sweet cornbread gives this a terrible taste.  Otherwise, it was very good.

We enjoyed this very much.  The only change I made was to use the whole packet of fajita seasoning instead of just 1 Tbsp.  I also did not bake it in the skillet.  I put it in an 8 inch square pan and baked it that way.  Worked great!  This was fast, easy and yummy!

Oh my god! I never ever review, but this I had to review, I made my own cornbread instead of using a cornbread mix, and added jalapeno's into the mix since I LOVE spicy, a long with making my own fajita mix, and the soft cornbread in mix with the spicy flavorful beef is AMAZING! I also omitted the beans since I wasn't in the mood for beans, but I had one bite of this and was SO GLAD I stayed home for xmas to make this instead of going out.

This was  a disaster. Wasted so much meat I used 2 lbs.  My family did not eat it. They tossed it to the dog and ate left over pizza. It will not make my keeper list. Sorry...

Really good!  My Boyfriend loved it when I made it.  But he added Salsa on it just to see how it would go with it and let me tell you it was amazing.  So after you bake this dish, when you serve it make sure you either put the sals on top or on the side.  It really adds extra flavor to this dish.

I've been making this recipe for years. Always used ranch style beans and taco seasoning mix instead of fajita seasoning.  If you really want to kick it up a notch, top with a dollop of sour cream and shredded cheddar cheese. YUM!!

After reading some other suggestions I changed a few things. 
Instead of baked beans, I used chili beans.
Instead of red peppers, I used green.
Instead of fajita seasoning, I used taco.
I also added garlic powder, cumin, 1 cup of corn, and best of all a layer of velveeta cheese in the middle of the meat mixture. It turned out amazing!! : )

I have to tell you, I had my doubts. But this is soooo good! I used chili beans, added 1/3 cup minced jalapenos to the cornbread mix as well as a teaspoon honey as was suggested. Then layered jalapeno pepper cheese with sharp cheddar on top of the meat and bean mixture.. then the corn bread mix, then baked. You won't be dissapointed!!!

Doubled and used extra lean ground chicken, red and green peppers and vegatarian beans drained. I also added some bbq sauce. I used buttermilk instead of regular milk in the cormbread mix. Nice casserole! Thanks!

This was wonderful and easy.  I had a bag of ancient sweets (red peppers) that I bought at Sams.  I was going to make stuffed peppers.  Unfortunately or fortunately, I over steamed them and looked for a different recipe.  I found this one.  I only had a can of Bush's Grillin Beans- the Fiesta variety.  They already have green and red peppers, so I didn't put any peppers in the meat.  I doubled the meat mixture- used taco seasoning instead of the fajita seasoning.  I then doubled the corn bread mixture- I added 1/2 a can of corn and then two handfuls of the steamed red peppers.  In addition to being delicious, the red peppers made the corn bread look on top look gorgeous.  Since I don't have a cast iron skillet, I used a 9 x13 baker.  It took a little while longer to cook the corn bread than the recipe indicated.  This recipe was good enough that I asked my husband to buy the cast iron skillet....he's considering it!  Try it and enjoy

We liked this recipe very much.  As suggested, I doubled the cornbread, I added a can of partly drained tomatoes and threw in a couple of handfuls of frozen corn.  I think it could have used the cheese (which I didn't have), and my son wished it were spicier.  But we all enjoyed it very much.  And it was super-quick to prepare after a long day at work.

This was pretty good , but I didn't make it according to the recipie.  I used ground turkey, chili beans, canned corn and 1 small can of tomato sauce. I used cajun seasoning also.  I doubled the cornbread part and that was too much. I should have left well enough alone, but I had such a big skillet.  Anyway, the taste was good, and would like to make again with the baked beans.

Hokie, I changed a LOT about this recipe simply because we were missing some of the ingredients. I used about 14 ounces of diced kielbasa instead of ground beef, only 1 red pepper, and about one tablespoon of taco seasoning because we didn't have any fajita seasoning. I used a can of baked beans with tomato sauce, plus I added one stalk of celery (diced), a few shakes of garlic powder, and a couple shakes of chili powder. I put a thin layer (maybe ½ cup) of Mexican cheese blend between the meat and cornbread layers plus I sprinkled a little cheese on top of the cornbread. I baked it in an 8x8 inch casserole dish. It was really good!  Next time, I'll probably omit the red pepper because it tastes a little weird with the slightly-sweet-and-spicy sauce. Thanks so much for this versatile recipe!

This was a very different, but not bad recipe.  We decided we'd like chili beans, rather than canned baked beans so as not to have the sweet taste.  Overall, we'd try it again.

Tasty. I did one whole small-ish onion, 1 red pepper, 1 green pepper and used a 16 oz. can of baked beans since that's what the store had. Instead of buying fajita seasoning, I just guesstimated and used cumin, chili powder, garlic powder, cayenne pepper, black pepper and oregano. The spices were good, but I'll use a touch less cumin next time (I think I did around a tsp., but I wasn't strictly measuring.) I added some sharp cheddar to the cornbread mix. Overall, this was easy and I'll make it again.

Easy to pull together on a nite when you are short on time. Added a fresh salad on the side. Would make again.

I omitted the peppers but other than that, I thought this was pretty good. I did add an 8 oz package of shredded cheddar cheese on top of the meat layer.  I used an 8x8 pan and it was perfect.  I will keep it for a now and again recipe.

This recipe is pretty good! Per MZOJIBWAY's own review of the recipe I used 3 T Emeril's Southwest Seasoning, which I will probably cut back to 1.5 or 2 T next time...but I accidentally used 28 oz baked beans instead of 15 oz, and I also added a can of creamed corn so I figured it could use a little extra spice. I also doubled the corn bread, and I'm not sure if it was because of that but I ended up cooking it for 40 minutes instead of 20 because although the corn bread was firm and golden on top it seemed a little runny on the bottom. This is definitely an easy, hearty, satisfying meal.

This was very good! I only had a large can of Bush's Baked Beans, so I used the whole can, but that was about the only change I made. My husband really liked it too so that is great!

This was so good!  I did add some frozen corn to the mix and only put in 1 red bell pepper.  As for my cornbread I added about 2/3 cup shredded cheddar cheese and about 2 tablespoons chopped jalepeno slices and about 1/2 tablespoons honey.  The honey help balance out the jalepeno.  This was also excellent leftover for lunch the next day.

We really enjoyed this hearty meal. I used 1 large red pepper and 1 small onion that I cooked along with the ground beef. Increased the fajita seasoning to 2 Tbsp. and also added about 2 oz. of shredded pepperjack cheese that I had on hand. Also, I didn't have an oven-safe skillet so I used a 7x11 glass pan. Turned out great!

It was too dry for me, (I had to smother it with sour cream) and I think I would have preferred it with taco seasoning.

I was very skeptical of this recipe, given the ingredients and the sometimes mixed reviews but I'm glad I tried it because this was awesome!  My husband and I liked the slight sweetness that the baked beans brought in.  I used Emeril's southwest seasoning for this, used a tablespoon of that, worked great, although I think next time I may just opt for using regular ol' taco seasoning.  Also used 1/2 of a large green bell pepper, didn't really need much more than that.  Last thing I did was that my skillet isn't oven friendly so I just put this all in a 7x11 glass dish and fit perfectly.  Pieces of advice: make sure you use non-sweet cornbread unless you want it very sweet, and if you would prefer your whole dish to be savory, use something other than baked beans.  I really like this dish, it was a definite surprise in a good way and it will definitely be made again!

I'm a recent college grad so cheap and easy is a necessity when it comes to food. This was excellent. I read everyone else's comments and added what i liked and cooked it in a 9 x 13 baking dish. The mixture was made up of ground beef w/taco seasoning, onions, red bell pepper, corn, green chiles, baked and pinto beans, and habanero hot sauce. The cornbread had fresh jalapenos, corn and shredded mexican cheeses. Delicious.

Delicious and very versatile! My husband said that it was the best thing that I had ever cooked! I used black beans instead of baked beans, and I added frozen corn to the cornbread, as well as pepperjack cheese on top of the meat. I also gave a little squeeze of honey to the top of the cornbread before serving. We ate the whole casserole in less than 24 hours!

I loved the ease and quickness!  Overall it was liked by the family, not a regular but a definite go to for those quick fixes!  The beans may have made it a tad sweet so next time will try ranch style beans or pinto with jalapeno!

The printed date on the copy in my book of recipes reads 2005.  I have been planning on making this for over 3 years now.  I look at it quite often and finally got around to making tonight.  It is really good.  I added a can of corn to the mixture because I figured I had a better chance of getting the kids to eat "one thing."  I also used the cornbread recipe from the red Better Homes and Garden cookbook because I like it better than the mix.  I topped the cornbread mixture with cheese and it baked into the bread.  I will make this again and won't wait three years this time.  Thanks for posting.

This was excellent...with a few modifications.  I couldn't imagine using baked beans so I used black beans, rinsed & drained.  I also added some chopped jalepeno peppers and green onions to the corn bread mix.  I will make this many times, I'm sure!

Absolutely the BEST new recipe I've tried in a long time!  I made this recipe as is - no tweaking.  My entire family loved it!  The taste is so different from anything else.  It has become a standard in my home.

I'll give this 3 stars for ease of preparation and the taste was good. But, it didn't rate well with several of my children and with the amount of southwest seasoning, it came off pretty spicy and hot. So if you have kids start off with the lowest amount of seasoning (1 Tbsp.) rather than the full amount. (3 Tbsp)  Also, if having a sweet on top of your main course is unappealing, you might want to serve the cornbread on the side.

Really enjoyed this recipe.  I've made it a couple of times now.  Once using ground turkey and another time I added some corn.  Have also served it to friends who also commented on how much they liked it.

Turned out pretty good for us country folks.  I think I'll add some cheese under the cornbread next time.  I Also think Mexican cornbread on top would be good.  But it was really quick to make and was very good.

I enjoyed this recipe more than I thought I would.  I pretty much followed the recipe but made a few modifications for what I had in the pantry 1) I omitted the bell peppers 2) I used Bush's Black Bean Fiesta Grillin Beans and 3) I used a 15 oz. package of corn bread from Trader Joe's.  I added a can of green peppers and a can of corn to the cornbread mix.

The recipe turned delicious but next time I will use the 8.5 package of cornbread specified in the recipe, rather than the 15 oz. package.  The cornbread to meat-mixture ratio was too high.  Obviously, that was my fault not the recipe's.

Very simple meal and a crowd-pleaser.  Easy weeknight meal that will be added to my meal rotation.

Every time I make this, it is wiped out.  I have played with this recipe a lot, but my favorite change is using ground pork sausage (breakfast sausage).

Love this recipe when we are craving "something different"! Flavors work really well together. I leave out the pepper and instead add a can of fiesta corn that has the peppers already included. I also mix in about a cup of shredded cheese before topping off with the cornbread. What's great is that it is sooo easy to modify and make it your own.

My family loved this dish! I have 5 kids and they loved it.We also had one more child over for dinner that night and she loved it too! She told her mom and her mom wanted the recipe. I doubled the recipe and used a 10x13 pan and that was the only thing I changed. If I can get 6 kids to love it, well that's just saying something!

This was great!!!   We didn't have any fajitas spices, so we used the homemade taco mixture from all recipes and it was spicy but tasted great.   It was easy to make and looked and tasted spicy and wonderful.

Great recipe. Only did 1 red pepper. Would add more fajita spice next time (2 T?).  I used 11 x 8 pan in the oven (instead of using a skillet)
It looked like there wasn't enough cornbread on the top, so I doubled the cornbread part.  That messed up the cook time- needed 40-50 minutes to cook bread through.  Next time I will just use 1 cornbread.

I really like this recipe and wish you could rate it 4.5 stars  because I did have to change a good few things about it.  I had to transfer everything from the skillet to a casserole dish because I don't have an oven proof skillet. The first time I made I found that I needed 2 boxes of Jiffy rather than just one to cover all the material. I found that while it tasted great there wasn't enough sauce and it got a bit dry so I had to keep adding bbq sauce to it while eating. This time I used 2 cans of beans and even added a little extra bbq sauce to the mix. I also added a few spices to taste (cumin, garlic powder, chili powder). When I layered everything in the casserole pan I put a shredded mexican cheese mix on top of the meaty stuff and even mixed some into the cornbread mix and on top of the cornbread. I really like cheese so it was a natural addition for me. This time I have a much better ratio of meat mix to cornbread and plenty of sauce! It's awesome!

This is very good, with some modifications. Only used one red pepper, used 1/2 pack Ortega hot and spicy taco seasoning, used mild chili beans, added frozen corn, and added 1/4 cup Mexican cheese to the corn bread mixture. Had my 8 year old help me make this and she liked helping make it but didnt want to eat it due to the beans.This dish is better when the onions, and peppers are diced fairly small. I will for sure make this again, and again!

This was not popular with my family.  Everyone ate some of it, but we had a lot left over, which wouldn't normally happen with that quantity of food.  The main upside of this recipe is that it's easy to prepare, but I won't make it again.  My husband wants me to try modifying the meat portion to make it less sweet (maybe a can of chili instead of a can of baked beans), but I don't think I like the recipe enough to try to modify it to our tastes.

This is a great base recipe! I merged it with the "Hot Tamale Pie" recipe because I couldn't decide which to make. I made a 9x13 casserole using: 
2 boxes of Jiffy Cornbread mix. To the mix I added:
whole kernel corn (drained)
1 cup of cheddar cheese 
Ground turkey instead of beef and added,
Chili flakes
Ortega Taco Seasoning
Onion & garlic  
1 diced tomato 
1 medium green bell pepper
1 can black beans instead of refried beans 
Cooked at 350 for 40 minutes 
And Yum!!

Hubby gave this one a 3 star, I gave it a 4. I think this recipe has way to much red bell peppers, 1 large red pepper is just enough for the recipe. I had to cut them down smaller due to family preference. However, it has a nice flavor, not all out a fanstatic recipe but a decent one. The one thing about this recipe is that you can interchange ingredients. But had I used my 2 large bell peppers in this recipe...it would not have been good. Other then that...it was good.

Exquisite meal!! I doubled the recipe so my tweak of choice was to add one whole package of dry fajita seasoning to the meat. I also layered the meat with shredded cheese and I must say my family absolutely loved it!!!

I made this last night...It was delicious!  Son and I both had seconds and enough left for work lunch.  I added shredded cheese when it was done and put chili powder in bread mix. Threw a few slices of jalapenos on top of bread mix before I baked it.  It was great...this will be a regular for us.  You can do so many diff things to this.  But...make as is first!

So easy and so yummy!  Just fixed this for dinner tonight.  Needed something quick and fast.  Definitely was and everyone loved it.  They just want it hotter, spicier, so next time I may add some chopped chills or jalapeños.  

Thanks!

You got me with this one.  I  used more ground beef ( I had some already browned and in freezer) and a 28 oz can of baked beans.  This is a keeper.  So easy.

We liked this, but I thought the baked beans made the dish too sweet.  Made it again with ranch style beans and it was perfect.  Great quick dinner for the kids.

Delicious...I added a 1/2 can of corn to the cornbread and left out the peppers and onions (none in the house) and used Bush's Baked Beans with Maple Cured Bacon-YUM!!!!!! My husband and I felt that you definitely can't leave the veggies out of the meat mix, or it lacks that "something". Also, will try to make a little gravy for it next time. Overall, it was delicious, easy, and a keeper!!!!

This was quite a hit. I thought it would be too sweet with baked beans so I used two cans of chili beans. Also, I omitted the peppers and used taco seasoning. The only complaint was that it didn't have enough kick or any cheese. I'm making it again and adding Ro*tel tomatoes and topping with cheese. We'll see if that's enough or if I have to add extra chili powder the next time.

This was a very simple, and fast!  Only took me about 30-40 minutes to make!  I used ground turkey, seasoned with back pepper, one red pepper, 1/2 of an onion, one fresh tomato, 1/2 can of corn, baked beans & the fajita seasonings.  I put a thin layer of mexican style shredded cheese between the meat and cornbread layer.  I will try the southwest seasonings next time.  Thank you for this very simple and yummy recipe!

This was the easiest recipe - and DELICIOUS!  My entire family liked it (even the pickiest 7 year old!).  I added a cup of frozen corn and a can of diced tomatoes to the meat mixture and a handful of grated cheese to the top, before I spread the cornbread.  I topped it off with sour cream and diced jalepenos when it came out of the oven.

This is one of my husband's favorites! If you want to make an easy recipe even easier, double the meat mixture and freeze for later use. The next time you serve it, thaw it out, and the dish prepares in a snap!

This was pretty good...I made some changes including putting a thin layer of mashed potatoes on the bottom and adding cheese both on top of the meat mixture and in the cornbread.  I also put a can of diced tomatoes and a can of corn (drained) into the meat mixture.  I baked it in a 11.5 X 8 pan which was probably too big since the cornbread layer was a little thin.

I'm always a little skeptical about cassaroles like this, but it made a enough for four large servings, was pretty easy and tasted pretty good. I beefed up the meat mixture with a can of diced tomatoes with chilis and some chopped celery. I was going to add some boiled potatoes, but there was no room! The cornbread layer was good but could have been a little thicker. Next time, I would try a larger package of cornbread mix, but not too big so it would overflow. The boiled potatoes went on their own with some leftover cauliflower and a parmesan cheese sauce. It made for a filling, tasty meal.

This was really good and was enjoyed by everyone in the family.  I followed the some of the suggestions given by others and added corn and also used 1 can of fajita pinto beans instead.  Plus I used chipotle pepper seasoning instead of the fajita seasoning since dry fajita seasoning is not available at my local grocery.

This was very good.  Didn't rate it a five because it wasn't like I would pay for it in a restaraunt.  But it was very good.  All kids, hubby and me being pregnant ate it all.  The only thing I did different is used a 29oz can of beans and put cheese on the top.  I will make again and again.  Good for the end of the month meal when you have nothing left but these ingrediants or ramen noodles.  Very economical as well.  Thank you.

This is one of my favorite casserole dishes.  It is very easy to make.  The fajita seasoning gives it a great taste and aroma.  The cornbread makes it stick to your ribs.  A keeper.

I used ground turkey instead of beef to make it a little more healthly.  Also used the SW seasoning as originally submited. I thought it good and my daughter said delicious.  Next time I might add some tomatoes but I like to try a recipe essentially as written the first time.  Update 1/23/06:  Decided to change my rating to 5 because I've made this three times now and added a can of diced tomatoes.  It really is good and my daughter LOVES it.

Simple and incredible! The sweet taste of the beans and the southwestern taste of the seasoning packet are such a wonderful combination. Mine turned out a little dryer then I would like, so I might add more water next time. I used taco seasoning, because that's what I had on hand. I will certainly make this again. My husband and I wanted to eat the whole pan and not leave any leftovers! Thank you for a new family favorite!

I really liked this recipe.  I made some adjustments based on what I had in the house.  I used 1 onion and 1 red bell pepper.  I also added shredded pepper jack cheese to the topping and a can of corn to the filling.  I didn't have any baked beans so I used red beans (S&W), ketsup, dry mustard, brown sugar, and bacon.  I think I would like that better because you can make it as saucey as you like.  It needs a fair amount of sauce.  I also did not use the fajita seasoning so instead of a spicy flavor it was more sweet and smokey which went really well with the cornbread topping.  Great recipe!

My family loved this.  I left out the peppers, used a can of pork and beans (not the sugar sweetened baked beans), added a can of corn, and shredded cheese on top of the corn bread.  I also used 1 recipe of Taco Seasoning I (approx. 3T) from this website instead of the fajita seasoning.  (We LOVE that recipe!) The amount of sweet to spice was perfect.  As others, I baked it in an 8" square pan.  Very easy to tailor to your families preferences or to use what you have in the pantry.

I used refried beans inst of baked, and omitted the red peppers. Added corn (1 15 oz can, drained) and used savory corn bread mix instd of sweet.Husband liked it, but I thot it was dry.  Would probably add tomatoes to the beef so more liquid.

My whole family loved this dish.  Would have given it five stars but it was a little dry.  Next time I will add a can of corn and some Rotel tomatoes.  We can't wait to try it again.

Two stars because I found out too late my cornbread mix was sweet and I used Bush's baked beans which are also sweet. It turned out like candied chili. YUK! I will try again with another brand. I also added jalapeno stewed tomatoes and canned corn and used SW seasoning for fajita as the author admitted. The next day it mellowed out some so I didn't have to throw it out. will review again with the changes.

Delicious but almost a little too sweet.  Next time I'll try to give it some more depth by adding a bit of heat to the meat mixture!  My cooking time was closer to 30 minutes in the oven to cook the cornbread all the way through.

For a quick, hearty meal on a week night, I HAVE to give this a five star rating!  It was so easy and such a comfort food on a cold winter's night.  I'm glad that I read the submitter's additional post regarding the adjustments.  I only used 1 red bell pepper (chopped up small) and added a can of corn.  I also used 3T of cajun, creole seasoning.  Will make again as I always need ideas for a quick meal during the week!  Thanks Mozibway for your submittal!

This is a very quick, easy dish.  Tastes good, but because I used extra lean beef, was a little dry.  To alleviate that, I will add a little chicken broth next time.  Also could only find 6 ounce cornbread mix & that was enough.  Did add more milk to the mix also, because it was so thick.

So easy, so tasty.  You must use your favorite spice packet, I used a mesquite flavor packet, but I'll try the bourbon smokehouse next time.  The Cornbread topping made this casserole seem more labor intensive then it was.  I added different frozen veggies and used more beans and it still turned out perfect.  It will be rotating in my dinner repertoire from now on!

Very easy and yummy. I didn't think it was too sweet like others mentioned and I didn't really change the recipe. I did brown the meat for only two minutes and then added the onion and bell pepper so they would cook more and the meat wouldn't overcook. I only used one bell pepper (plenty) and put cheese all over it before adding the cornbread. The cornbread spread out was really thin, but when it cooked it was the perfect amount. I cooked this in the cast iron skillet and stuck the skillet in the oven making it a one pan meal!

I followed the directions and it proved to be very bland. My family and I agreed we didn't need to save the leftovers because nobody wants to eat it again.

The name caught my eye. I made the whole layered ingredients in a casserole dish and baked it. I adde a little bit of Tony Chachere's, chili powder and a couple of jalepenos chopped fine. It was a good hearty dish. Thanks.

Very good, and a very flexible recipe!  Just use your family's favorite seasonings and vegetables, or follow this exactly--it's wonderful.

Great easy dish to throw together.  I did hamburger meat,  green beans, pinto beans, a bit of tomato sauce and onions. Layered cheese over mix before the cornbread layer. Kids and husband loved it.

I thought this was just ok. I added a cup of pepper jack cheese (which I don't think added anything to the flavor) and a 1/2 cup of frozen corn to the corn bread mixture. I may or may not make this again.

Instead of peppers, I added yellow inion, corn, black beans, rotelle and taco seasoning. Topped meat mixture with pepper jack before the corn bread mix. It was a good meal, with leftovers that are great for lunch. I'll make it again.

Nice easy everyday dish, and I can see that it might take well to variations. I used a homemade fajita seasoning mix, and the little bit of cornstarch in it made a big difference--other times when I've made something similar, it was too runny. This was just right. I doubled it and baked it in a 9 x 13 pan a little longer--half an hour at 350 (because the corn muffin mix I used said 400)

Cowboy Skillet Casserole Haiku: "Used Ranch-style beans, but did the rest as written. Daughter liked, not me." I'm glad that I used Ranch-style beans instead of baked beans b/c the cornbread topping was sweet enough as it was that I wouldn't have wanted the additional sweetness of the baked bean-ey sauce too. Daughter was having a cowboy-themed week at school so this seemed an appropriate recipe to make, and she thought it was great, well, she loved scraping off the cornbread topping, so maybe not. I think I would've preferred a bowl of chili and cornbread on the side.

Made this tonight, came out excellent.  Then again, I am a great cook so yours may be different.  The only change I made was adding mushrooms and garlic when I was sauting the onions and then a few dashes of woshtiiishirrreeeee sauce.

Used taco seasoning, added corn and a little extra beans as suggested and still found a little bland and dry. Not a family favorite. Thanks anyway. It did peak my interest for trying more skillet dinners with my cast iron.

We liked this and it is very easily customized.  I added corn to the meat mixture and cheese to the cornbread.  I also used some cooked pinto beans I had in the freezer instead of the baked beans and used a whole packet of taco seasoning in place of the fajita seasoninig. Will make again!

I changed quite a bit about it, but i'm sure the regular recipe would be great. I used black beans, roasted red peppers (from a jar, they have more flavor), black olives, tomatoes and green chilies in the meat mixture and my own blend of spices for mexican type meals. I was worried the cornbread would be dry on top so I used half a cup of cream corn in that part and it was to die for! You can really customize the meat mixture to your family's taste, and it makes it a new way to eat mexican!

This was great!  I had to make some changes based on what i had available and because i wanted to make enough to eat all week.  I used 1 & 1/2 lbs. of ground beef, a whole onion, a can of jalapeno pintos, my dry rub for grilled meats instead of the fajita seasoning, and added a 10 oz can of "chili fixin's" style chopped tomato and green chilies and an additional 14.5 oz can of diced tomatoes to substitute for the bell peppers... I didn't have any on hand. 
I followed another reviewer's advice to add a 1/2  cup of corn and 1 cup of pepper jack cheese to the cornbread mix and because i had leftover corn and cheese i added the remaining 1/2 cup of corn to the meat mix and topped it with the remaining 1 cup of cheese before adding the cornbread mix on top.  Add a dollop of sour cream when serving and this is irresistible!

I didn't really follow the recipe at all... but thanks for the idea! I mostly only changed it because we didn't have a lot of the ingredients in the house, but I substituted similar ingredients and it was WONDERFUL. I went back to the store and bought all of the ingredients to make this one again but the right way, I'm sure it will be just as good.

Wow - this meal really shocked us.  It has such a unique combination of flavors that is so satisfying.  I used plain corn bread NOT sweet, I also used ground turkey and you couldn't tell the difference.  I used fajita seasoning and maybe 2/3 of a red bell.  I cooked it in a 13x9 baking dish.  So easy to make, you won't be disappointed.

My husband and I loved this dish.  I was looking for something different to do with some ground beef and this was an easy and fitting dish.  I added some corn and sugar to the cornbread mix.  It was a great addition.  I also added some shredded cheddar on top.  That really didn't seem to add much to it and I could probably do without.  I plan to recommend to everyone at work tomorrow.

I am taking this to a horseback trail ride potluck later, so I may update my review and tell you how the "real" cowboys, okay the "weekend" cowboys liked it, but my little taste here at home, it was very very good.  My husband said I shouldn't take it (so he can eat it all here at home)  My changes, I used green pepper instead of red.  I have started a mission of trying to save money and see how much a dish costs.  So the green pepper alone saved me 3.50, since 2 reds were $4 and I only used one green one for 50 cents.  I did add some taco mix cheese in with the cornbread.  All in all, I think it cost me around $7 by not adding alot of extra stuff.  Great value for a great taste.  Thank you for sharing.  Update - not a single crumb left.  :-)

I followed the recipe exactly but I had a huge bell pepper so I only used 1. My family thought that it would have been better with honey butter on the top. We sampled it with sour cream on top and that was yucky. I had very lean ground beef and will probably add a little butter when I put onion in. Tasted great!

This was absolutely delicious!!  I made it exactly as stated and it was great.  Next time I will probably use two tablespoons of the seasoning and, like another reviewer said, add some corn and pepperjack cheese to the cornbread mix.  But really, still delicious as is!

I made this the other night for my boyfriend and I and we both loved it!  I'm not a big fan of baked beans so I used Ranch Style beans instead and also added a can of habenero Rotel.  I cooked it in a 9 x 13 and used Jiffy cornbread with about a 1/8 c. sugar for extra sweetness (I LOVE sweet cornbread). My boyfriend actually ate the leftovers the next day...something he rarely does!

I really enjoyed this!  Unfortunately my kids wouldn't touch it (picky) and my husband (meat & potato guy) wasn't really into it.   I did change it though.  I didn't have baked beans so I used ranch style beans.  I also added a can of cream corn to add some sweetness because of the lack of baked beans.   I also put a cup of shredded cheese into the meat mix and a green pepper.

Sorry, did not care for this. The corn bread was way to sweet. I added cheese and corn but didn't help. Maybe will try the next time with chili beans as other's have suggested and corn bread on the side.

absolutely delish!! Made it for supper and have had constant requests for it ever since.  Love the fact that you cook everything all in one pan.  Only other dish you dirty is for the cornbread topping. Didn't like the sweet cornbread topping so made a small batch of regular...tasted even better.  The sweet cornbread mix made it too sweet for our tastes.

Very good.  I used about 1 1/3lb ground round, sml can baked beans (could use larger can) and one chopped red pepper.  Did not have onions so used shallots.  Used 1 tbl fajita seasoning.  Next time I will try Emeril's Essence.  Added frozen corn and shredded cheddar jack cheese to the cornbread mix, which another reviewer suggested.  Excellent addition!

Haven't actually eaten it yet, it's in the oven right now. I made a few changes  to the recipe. I used garlic, as well as onions. I mixed those, 1/2 the bell pepper, and the fajita seasoning into the meat before cooking, to give the meat some flavor. I also used ranch style beans--baked beans doesn't really sound right. I also added a half can of corn, then I simmered it together for about 5 minutes. For the cornbread, I mixed in 1 chopped jalepeno, 1/4 of the bell pepper, and a 1/2 can of corn, and a few spoons of sugar.

Pretty good but wasn't anything anyone was dying to have again. I don't know that I personally didn't care for the flavor that the baked beans added to it and if I made it again that would be something that I would look at making different. Quick and easy to make though.

We really enjoyed this. I did not have everything so I substituted and it turned out really good. We used chili beans instead of baked beans and added some canned corn. I used the fajita seasoning and liked it but I think next time I will stick with the chili beans and add some bbq sauce and maybe some slice olives. Very versatile! I am going to try it in our dutch oven when were camping!

This recipe is great, but don't overcook the meat and veggies! I would suggest cooking the beef and onions together initially rather than waiting to add the onions. After the beef has started to brown and the onions are clear, then add the peppers and any other veggies you want, waiting to add the beans until right before you coat the skillet with the cornbread mix. If you follow this order then your meat and veggies will be cooked to a proper degree before being baked for 20 minutes. I also used a 15 oz box of cornbread mix rather than 8.5, and it turned out perfectly, enough to coat the entire skillet.

Really delicious, although I did change it to make it a little more "tex-mex" tasting (and so I didn't have to go to the store).  I replaced the baked beans with black beans, and I added corn and salsa to the mix (about a cup of each.  I'll make this again! YUM!!

I cook supper every Wednesday night for our church study group so I am always looking for recipes with 4 or 5 stars. That is why I chose this recipe. It was a big hit and people who normally only take one helping came back for seconds. Very filling and not to expensive to make. Loved it!

I have to review based on my husband's feedback because I am a vegetarian cook feeding an onmivore husband (in other words, I didn't eat it).  Very easy meal that was hearty and seems very flexible.  I see others have added canned corn and tomatoes.  Will have to try that next time.  Served with sour cream.  Leftovers were gone quickly!

I added a few extras but this is a really easy and great dinner to serve if you don't have a whole lot in your cabinets. I had great northern beans drained the juice and had rotel with chilis... i also added a bit more fajita seasoning and a bit of taco seasoning... I added salt and fresh ground pepper and greek seasoning......delicious hope my boyfriend likes it :)

Very tasty.  I probably used to much cornbread and will scale that down next time.  I didn't have the packet and just used my cornmeal.

This recipe was good. I changed it up a little by adding some cream of mushroom soup and chili sauce to the mix. I used taco seasoning instead, and used half of a red pepper and half orange. I added corn and used blackbeans. I also topped the mixture with cheese before pouring the cornbread over it. And then more cheese on top of the cornbread when it was close to being done. The family loved it.

Pretty good. I added a can of diced tomatoes, a scant tablespoon of brown sugar, a 28 oz. can of baked beans instead of 15 oz., the whole package of fajita seasoning, and topped it with Colby/Jack cheese before baking. I will serve the cornbread on the side next time. My son really liked it and he doesn't care for dishes I make with beans.

My husband and I weren't too impressed.  Thought it was too sweet tasting...we added shredded cheese to the left overs, which made it more to our liking.

An absolute favorite among the guys at m house! Always requested or oohed over when mentioned. Thanks for the great recipe! The only thing I change is that I add frozen corn to the meat and beans mixture and top the cornbread with shredded cheese 5 minutes before coming out of the oven. Deliciousness!

Quick and pretty good.  Used pinto beans, 1/3 cup ketchup, 2 cloves chopped garlic, half can of mexi-corn, and one chopped chipotle pepper in adobe.  Didn't have red peppers.  I meant to add cheese before applying the cornbread but forgot.  It was still good.  Next time tryin' cheese . .  .

Something different and fun.  I thought it was a little bland, so if I make it again I will add something to give it a little "kick," or I might use barbecue flavored baked beans.  I put all the ingredients in a 9x13 and baked for 25 minutes.

No one raved about this dish, or really commented at all; however, there was none left at the end of our dinnertime.

This is a very tasty dish. Very simple to make and my husband especially liked the corn bread topping. The bell peppers definitely complimented the other flavors as they are sweet. I will definitely make this a staple.

This was very good.  I was a bit skeptical due to the different flavors being mixed but was pleasantly surprised.  I used Enchilada seasoning because I didn't have Fajita seasoning.  I also added a layer of sharp cheese before putting the corn bread on top.  This gave it a nice kick.  Thanks for the different/wonderful recipe.

I didn't have ground beef so I used browned cubed chuck roast meat after dusting it with flour/corn flour mixture. I browned it with olive oil and then after I added  the peppers and onion I added a little water til I had a nice gravy. My family really liked it. Thanks for the great recipe!

This was one of the worst things I have ever eaten! The mixture of flavors was terrible. No one in my family liked this. Sorry!

I liked this.  It definitely tasted Western!  I liked the mix of savory and sweet.  I will make this again, it was tasty and easy!  I like things that are different, and this is it.

I really liked this.  A good mix of sweet and savory. My boyfriend likes to put maple syrup on it. I served the leftovers to my neighbors, and they really liked it too!  This one is a keeper in my book!

Absolutely love this!  Husband is crazy for it...We like it with sour cream on top.  This should be a hit with any crowd- family dinners or potlucks.  I couldn't find fahita seasoning so I used regular taco seasoning.  A+++++++++

This is a tasty and forgiving dish. I didn't have enough taco sauce so I used the rest of my salsa and chili sauce. It still tasted very good. Great winter meal!

Good.  I used green pepper instead of red pepper.  Tasted good and really easy to put together.  Serve with a salad!

Not out-of-this-world, but will make again at some point.  Easy to make.  I did not "jazz it up" as suggested in the recipe's intro, but will next time to add a bit of flavor and varying texture.

My family loved this...I added shredded chesse to the corn bread mix and use ground country sausage because I didn't have any hamburger meat. Also added corn as suggested in the reviews...great the next day too.  Thanks

I was a little skeptical at first but it was a really snowy night and I had all the ingredients on hand and decided to give it a try!  This had a very unique flavor.  The more we ate the more it became addicting.  Next time I make this though I will add cayne or something to add a little more kick to counter act the sweetness of the corn bread.

My husband LOVED this dish!  I didn't love it as much as he did but it was good.  It's something a little different than the usual casseroles.  I did not have fajita seasoning on hand and the recipe submitter mentioned in a previous review that the original recipe called for Southwest Seasoning.  I went online and found an Emeril recipe for Southwest Seasoning, whipped that together and used it to season the dish.  I used almost 1-1/2 tablespoons and I thought it was spicy.  
I'll be making this one again since my husband raved about it.

Great recipe for a week night.  Very easy to prepare.  I added a can of corn and a can of stewed tomatoes to the beef mixture.  I thought it was a little bit too sweet, but my fiancee loved it.  Next time I will substitute the baked beans for pinto beans.
