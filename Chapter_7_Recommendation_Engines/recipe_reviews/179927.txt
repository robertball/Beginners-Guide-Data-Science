Excellent! I made this as directed except I skipped the cornstarch (maybe my tomatoes, but I didn't need it), and tossed my sauce with the linguine. I also added the shrimp in the last few minutes with the pasta - I think they could have gotten too done as written. Anyway, fabulous idea and flavors - my guys were thrilled. I threw some chopped green and yellow peppers and chopped parsely on when I served it. Thanks for the recipe - nicely done! :)

I used rotini pasta instead of linguine because I like the way it holds the sauce.  I didn't use chicken, but it was still yummy with just the shrimp and sausage.  It was spicy, but my picky daughter liked it too. It made the house smell great while it was cooking.  Will definitely make it again!

I really enjoyed this and had all the ingredients on hand!  I made a roux instead of using corn starch and I used beer instead of water (beer makes everything taste better).  Finally, I added a splash of cream at the end because I realized I added too much hot sauce and needed to mellow it out.  Got great reviews from everyone I served it to.  The sauce was flavorful and spicy.  Served it with some roasted asparagus but next time I think throwing vegetables right into the sauce would be better--but thatâ€™s the Yankee in me.

Recipe is great for the most part, but to be truly authentic 'Pastalaya' as it's called in Louisiana, firm short pasta should be used because long spaghetti, linguini, fettuccini noodles will break up and get kind of mushy. Also, Kebalsa and Cajun just don't do together Shaa, so please use Andouille or a good smoked sausage and you'll have yourself a delicious, authentic Cajun Pastalaya that everyone will love. My pasta preference is Penne or Ziti, but Rotini and Bowtie is also good. Cest bon!

Kids thought it was too spicy, husband and I LOVED it. Even better a day or two later as leftovers with a bit of cheese grated on top.

First I am not a big fan of rice. When I saw this recipe I had to try it and it was the hit of the evening. The only change I made was cooking the tomatoes about 40 min and then added the shrimp. Keep up the good work

Can I give this a 5+++?   This is amazing.   My husband asked for jambalaya but does not like rice so I searched for a recipe that was made with pasta instead and found this one.    I invited all my kids home for dinner==>I have 3 grown sons so I tripled the recipe.  Fantastic.   Only change I made was that I used penne pasta rather than linguini (hubby's preference).   Been making it for almost 3 years now and never get tired of it.   A friend of my sons has had it and then ordered at a restaurant.  He told the staff they needed to ask me for my recipe cuz theirs didn't even come close.  If you get the  chance you have to make this. 
RAESIVE thank you for sharing this.        YUMMY

We've made this a couple of times now, and it's absolutely delicious. It makes a great "one course dinner". The second time I prepared it, I made the following modifications: Added 1/2 tsp cayenne pepper (gives it some heat, which we found to be just right). Added 1/2 cup chicken broth (I used bouillon) and a splash of sherry, plus 2 Tbsp cornstarch dissolved in 1/2 cup water (as written, this sauce is a bit dry). As others have mentioned, this recipe needs peppers! I chopped up some small sweet peppers which were a great addition. I reduced the amount of pasta to 16oz, which is quite enough. That extra 8oz of pasta the recipe calls for is literally 8oz too much. We blended all the sauce and pasta together and found the proportion of sauce to pasta to be very good. I used orecchiette this time, but the linguine is also good - they each hold the sauce a bit differently.

Being from South Louisiana I know this recipe is called Pastalaya here. I love this dish! We use smoked sausage made by our local supplier,
instead of kielbasa and I use Vidalia onions when in season and sweet onions from South America when Vidalia are not in season. I love tomatoes but do not use them in this.

So quick and easy to make.  I didn't think I liked Jambalaya until I made this recipe.  My husband loved it and had several servings.  So yummy!  Can't wait to make it again when family comes to town.

This was so easy to make.  My husband made it for a family birthday celebration for 12 so he doubled the recipe.  My husband went a little light on the cayenne pepper and hot sauce so it wasn't overwhelming for those of us who can't handle the heat.  Excellent dish!

Ive made this a few times now. The family really enjoys it. I think maybe I could cut back on the linguini a bit as every time there is a lot of left over pasta. All in all, a delicious recipe that has been added to our "rotation". Thanks raesive.

Great stuff, made it tonight, loved it.  I used angel hair pasta instead cause I like it better.  I also used a ground chicken sausage that had green and red peppers in it instead of kielbasa.  Did not add sugar or corn starch, was not needed.  It is a keeper.  Thanks

This was good and spicy. I didn't use chicken, just the shrimp and sausage. I also used fettucine instead of linguine. Next time I am going to add some vegetables, I think broccoli and zucchini would go well.

Made a quick version of this tonight when I realized my husband would appreciate this more than plain old kielbasa.....made it with yellow rice though which was fantastic (vs pasta). I also skipped the chicken and the corn starch. Used cocktail sauce instead of hot sauce cause that is what we had and it worked great just the same. Spicy though as is everything that includes cayenne....just modify the amount used to your spice factor! Great for a speedy jambalya!

Very good altho it was a bit too spicy for 2 of the kids! I also threw in a handful of green peppers & used fresh minced garlic. Omitted the sausage only because I'm saving it for another meal but it would be a great with it! Thanks!

This meal is AMAZING! I followed the recipe except for the following changes; I used Hillshire Farm Beef Kielbasa, rice, and cooked shrimp. Tried it with pasta and did not enjoy it as much. The meal is so good as leftovers, that might be my favorite part! This recipe is a definite save!!!

Excellent blend of spices without being TOO hot. I left out the chicken and added garlic sausage because I had a bunch of leftover shrimp to use. Becasue the shrimp was already cooked, I sauted the sausage with the onion and and a diced bell pepper and dumped in the crock pot with all the remaining ingredients except the shrimp. Cooked all afternoon and threw the shrimp in to warm before serving.  Served once over rice and also over spaghetti noodles.  Both equally excellent.

Super good and makes a ton. I made it all minus the cornstarch (didn't seem to need it) and left out the shrimp. I stuck it in the freezer, defrosted today, added the shrimp when I added the noodles (I used coiled fideo). Very easy for a busy night when prepared like this and have plenty for leftover lunch tomorrow.

GREAT!!! A new and tastey addition to my list of dinners to make. It's so simple the kids could help make it! I used pasta I made fresh, and hubby was blown away. Did not have any problems, followed the recipe exactly, except I did not have paprika, cornstarch,  or tobasco, so I put in extra cajun seasoning(tonys brand)used flour,  and tapatio. The only advie I have is to double check your shrimp and make sure they are devained! ( I spent 2hours at the sink doing this on salad shrimP!  Learned my lesson!) And if your shrimp were precooked/cleaned, add them last, after the kielbasa and cornstarch(orr flour), so they don't turn to rubber. Other than my own mistakes, this was a great toss together meal for the well-prepared! THANK YOU!

I would give this 4.5 if I could.  This was really good!  It made a HUGE quantity of food.  I did not need to add the cornstarch either to the mix.  Nice flavor and spice and it will provide dinner another night.  Thanks for sharing.

This was delicious! Although I made a few mods - I used rotini pasta instead of linguine. And I used andouille sausage instead of plain ol' keilbasa. I didn't add the hot sauce, with the Cajun seasoning and sausage it was perfectly spicy for us. And so flavorful! I served it to company and they loved it.

This was great and I'll definitely make it again! I used andouille sausage and otherwise followed the directions exactly. I am not too worried about the "official" name of the dish - it's got a great flavor!

Fantastic. I haved the tomatoes and used only 16 oz box of penne pasta and five Tupperware lunches left over.

Amazing!!!  If you line spicy, it's there. If you want traditional, use rice instead of pasta. Pasta takes away from some of the "heat" for kids!

Made this for a family gathering over the weekend. The only thing I changed was using Andouille instead of Keilbasa and penne instead of linguini. The flavors were amazing and the leftovers even tastier the next day.  This is definitely a keeper and in the monthly rotation at my house! Thank you raesive!

I do not care how it called-pastalaya or jambalasta. Most important thing - it tastes good! The only thing I change-added less pasta. Easy to make, great dish, loved it!

Delish.  Made it exactly as written except we reduced the amount of pasta as we are only three.  I also reduced the amount of hot sauce to 2 teaspoons.  That was a mistake.  It needs the full tablespoon.  I believe it will round out and balance the flavours and shouldn't make it too hot at all.  I didn't have diced tomatoes, so I used the same amount of italian plum tomatoes I had on hand and took my scissors to them.  This dish will be definitely be made again in our house as even my teenager snarfed it.  Next time I might try what one of the other reviewers stated and saute the onions and garlic and then toss everything except the shrimp in the slow cooker for the day to slowly let the flavours evolve and then add the shrimp near the end to cook through.  Oh and if you have a sucky husband like mine, buy larger count shrimp so it's easy to remove the tails so HE doesn't have to!!!

Delicious!  The only change I made was to add heavy cream(just a small amount at the end ) to make it a little creamy.  I have a feeling this will taste even better the next day.   My picky kids liked it too, which is miraculous!

Made this last night, and my family loved it.  My husband compared it to the one at the YardHouse Restaurant, and said it tastes similar, but my version was better (of course).  The only thing I did different, was add chopped green bell peppers.

Wonderful meal.  I did change some minor pieces out of necessity. First I used the crockpot and let it cook the kielbasa and chicken along with the other ingredients.  A bag of thawed cleaned shrimp without shells etc was put in about 20 minutes before turning the pot off  The next item changed on this round of fixing the dish, I substituted a 24 oz jar of corn and black bean salsa for the tomatoes  and a small can of tomato sauce - not because I was being creative but those were here and the tomatoes were at the store. I did cut back on the hot sauce because of the salsa.  A box of dirty rice was cooked and added to the collective mix at the end.   Very pleased.

Taste great! I did make a few changes. I added chopped celery and diced garlic. I also used cooked chicken, and I did not add corn starch. In fact, I added about a cup of water. Oh one more thing, I didn't add my shrimp til' the very end. I did not want them to be over cooked. Seasonings were great though! :)

Cooked this tonight for dinner, was very very good. Other then the fact that I used fully cooked shrimp and they were a little bit tougher then usual. The flavor was wonderful and the recipe I followed except left out sausage as I did not have any in the house.   Will make again for sure.   4.5/5

Just a few changes.  I wanted more vegies so added a grey and a yellow zucchini and some mushrooms.  I used 1/2 the recipe and it will feed 3-4. I used fresh garlic.  Substituded 8 on can tomato sauce with a 1/2 fresh tomato as I didn't want to open a large can of tomatoes.  I would like it a bit spicier.

Wow this is so good!! I love Zatarains Jambalya but this is so much better. I was out of linguine or any other spaghetti noodle so I just used penne, the only type of pasta I had! I omitted the chicken and the cornstarch and added a green pepper with the onion. I thought I had cajon seasoning but it turned out to be sante fe seasoning but I went ahead and used it and it was fine. The tomatoes I used were hot with green chiles, I used two 14.5 oz cans, one drained one undrained and Franks Red Hot for the hot sauce. Will be making this a lot!!! Thank you so much.

This is a great recipe! I've made it several times since finding it.  We have seafood allergies in our family so I omitted the shrimp, but added a can of kidney beans just to bulk it up a bit. Like another reviewer said, I didn't need the cornstarch.

Very Good! My family enjoyed this pasta dish. I only made minor changes. I used rotel tomatos for spice and omitted the hot sauce and onion. I used Texjoy's sausage seasoning and steak seasoning, garlic powder and italian seasoning. I also used corkscrew pasta. The shrimp was added at the last minute as well so that they would not overcook.

My husband loved this! I left out the shrimp because I didn't have any on hand and it was still great. I think you can use any combo of the meats or any one meat by itself. Very good. Different too.

I really enjoyed this meal.  I only changed a couple of things to suit my own taste; I did not use the hot sauce and I used Orzo pasta.  It had a really nice flavor. Will definitely make again!

Very good! I used rotini instead as well, worked awesome. I also added green chilies and scallions.  This was amazing.  I left out the hot sauce, and am glad I did. With the chilies it was plenty hot. Served with buiscuts and was almost gone! Oh, and I'm going to call it Jumbalasta, sounds better than Pastalya.

My husband and his work colleagues loved this.  Due to personal preference, (had an AWFUL experience with market shrimp the last time I used it) so, no shrimp.  I used extra smoked sausage to compensate for the lack of protein.  I'd suggest using a BIT of hot smoked sausage for a BIT of heat.  The flavors to this dish are so delicious, I think too much heat will detract from them.  Also, used half a green pepper, half a red pepper and a few sticks of carrot (all chopped) to go with the onion.  Next time I'll mince some garlic cloves, too.  Again, personal preference, but not at all necessary for a 5-star dish.  One last thing, I used my refrigerated chicken stock instead of water in the cornstarch slurry.  I will definitely make this again and again.  Thank you, raesive!

Made it with jalapeno marinated chicken breast and Bone Rattler hot sauce ( it's a 2 on a scale of 5 of heat) it made a nice spicy dish. The noodles was a nice twist, taste was spot on!

I used only 16 ounces of the linguini and a touch of the hot sauce.  I also omitted the shrimp. Hubby and I thought it was pretty good.

Being from Louisiana my suggestion is to decrease the amount of pasta and to use Andouille sausage. The whole family loves this one!

Good flavors and simple ingredients! I cooked it with smoked deer sausage, pork steak (cubed) and chicken breasts (also cubed). All flavors worked well as written, except I used half the oregano and substituted it with thyme.  I also used chicken broth to slurry the corn starch and multicolored penne pasta.  The pack of hungry teenagers loved it!

We love this.  I used only 16 oz of linguine but kept the rest of the ingredient amounts the same.  It was a new twist on two old favorites, and very tasty.  Also very easy.

This goes into our recipe line-up for sure.  At least according to my grandsons.  Anyone who gave this a low rating because of a "bland flavor" either didn't follow the recipe or has some really weak spices.  Be aware that cajun blends vary greatly.  Mine is by Tones.  I also used smoky paprika and skipped the hot sauce because my tomatoes had jalapenos. Loved it!

I typically do not rate recipes that I do not follow but this recipe is a keeper!  I had a kielbasa that I needed to do something with so I thought I would give this recipe a try with the ingredients I had on hand.  I used some frozen chicken, onion, pepper mixture that I had in the freezer for lettuce wraps.  Also, I used sirracha sauce, oregano, smoked paparika, basil, penne pasta, the kielbasa, garlic powder and added a little pasta sauce to the noodles.  My husband and I were pleasantly surprised how this turned out.  I will definitely try the recipe again maybe as written next time, but it was definitely a great base recipe.  Thanks!!

Made this last night and it was great.  Just like some of the other reviewers, I added some orange peppers.  Next time I will add some yellow peppers also.  My husband lived it and even my lucky daughter said it was good.   The both liked it so much that I am going to have to make more for tonight as I had planned on having enough for leftovers.  This time though, I think I will try it with brown rice.  Great recipe and definitely a keeper!

Jambalasta Haiku: "The flavor just SLAYED. Just didn't like linguine. Pasta switch next time." Clever name for a delicious dish; we love jambalaya in our house, and this recipe didn't disappoint other than not enjoying having to twirl the linguine and then stabby-stab the chicken, veggies, and sausage. (I used Andouille.) Only other change was to include bell pepper and celery, b/c if I'm not mistaken, most Cajun dishes have the holy trinity? Will definitely hold onto this recipe, but use a different type of pasta, as well as skip the cornstarch step at the end and opt for starting w/ a roux maybe.

I thoroughly enjoyed this. As written, the seasonings are perfect--no need to change or modify. However, I did add a chopped green pepper and subbed a 28oz can of plain crushed tomatoes for the called for cans of diced tomatoes. I also used a 16oz box of penne pasta instead of linguine. I also chose to simmer the raw shrimp in the finished sauce, then when fully cooked tossed the pasta with the meat sauce. Oh and I never bothered to thicken the sauce. It stuck to and combined with the pasta beautifully. It's a nice change from cajun dishes with cream added. Thanks for sharing!

I'm originally from Michigan so I'll call it Jambalasta. I'll also call it very excellent!!   Used smoked angus sausage.  Left out the salt.  That can always be added for those who want it.  It doesn't have to be "truly authentic" to Louisiana.  The recipe itself says it is a new "spin" on an old recipe.   So why not a new name?

It was good, but a little salty. May omit extra salt or cut in half next time.  So I added a small can of tomato sauce to take away some of the salty flavor. It took away too much of the cajun flavor, maybe I should've used an extra small can of diced tomatoes. I will make it again.

Some things about this recipe are strange to me. Cornstarch for starters.  And adding the shrimp so early overcooks it and turns it to rubber. I cooked the chicken in spices, added roasted tomatoes and cooked them down for better flavor. No cornstarch! Add the shrimp the last few minutes of cooking along with kielbasa. I only used 16 oz of pasta. flavor is good

This was delicious. Good amount of spice without being overbearing. Allows the other flavors to come through nicely. I make a similar crock pot recipe but this was better and quicker. Added some chopped green pepper otherwise followed the recipe exactly. Served it over pasta as directed but I prefer this dish over rice.

This was a big hit for us. Very easy to make and make your own. I used chicken sausage (not big on kielbasa), and added green and red peppers, and fresh corn off the cob. I put it over zucchini noodles and it was healthy, filling, and delicious!

Used ordinary ingredients, was simple and fast. The taste was great.  A little spicey but you can leave out the hot sauce for a milder taste.

Very good.  I made some changes to use what I had on hand but we really enjoyed it.  It was a little sweet, I'm not sure you need the whole 1 tbsp of sugar.  I added peppers to it.

Loved it!  We left out the shrimp because we don't care for seafood, but other than that we made it exactly as written.  Does anyone know if you can freeze it?  My husband and I will never finish all the leftovers before they go bad and I hate to waste it!
