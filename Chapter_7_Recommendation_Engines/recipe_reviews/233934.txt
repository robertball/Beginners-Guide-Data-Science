This recipe is good but could be better! That spice rack sitting in the corner of your kitchen that you got from Aunt Betty 20 years ago as a wedding gift wasn't given as a show piece. Don't be afraid of those things called spices! They can dress up almost anything and this dish is certainly no exception to that rule. I added a little onion powder, garlic powder, tarragon and thyme for a savory and delicious addition that made these pork chops pop and I only marinaded it for 30 minutes. Imagine what how those chops would taste after sitting in all of that savory goodness overnight!  Try it! Hopefully you'll agree and get creative shaking those pretty jars sitting in the corner of your kitchen taking up counter space!

The mustard I used on this was from a foursome I got from Trader Joe's--Blackcurrant Mustard.  I read one review that said these chops had no taste, so I decided that a sweeter mustard might work better. You can see the seeds in the mustard on the photo I took, so maybe a whole grain mustard works best.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe as written.  We enjoyed these pork chops.  We rate it a 4 1/2!  I've saved some of the reserved sauce for another recipe--maybe chicken.  Thanks, Laura!  This helped us start in the new year!

Loads of flavor. I mixed the Dijon and sugar and set aside half to glaze then added the rest of the ingredients for the marinade. I let them soak overnight then dried on a rack in the fridge for 5 hours. 4 minutes per side on a hot grill- a little glaze- and yum!

10 stars!!! I used frozen apple juice concentrate straight from the carton. I eye balled the rest, added a splash of whiskey and reduced the whole thing by half. I am a poor planner so I used the sauce as a glaze. Fired up the grill and the boneless ribs were MONEY!! Laura, these were Fricken Tastic!! Thank You!!!

This was very good. I did add hot sauce and some minced garlic. I think you should reserve some of the marinade to baste the pork with. That will truly make it flavourful. Great bbq recipe - thanks!

Tasted nice........not a lot of the Dijon flavor at the recommended level--I'll add more next time.  I used 1 tbl spoon less sugar and it was still kinda sweet.  I'll make it again for sure but will tweek it a bit--I guess that is what cooking is all about.  I say, make it, we liked it!!

I followed this recipe to the letter & it had absolutely no taste. I saved some of the marinade for basting as we bbq'd them & they were moist, but that was about it.  Won't make again.

I had to use 3 tablespoons of bourbon in place of the apple juice and I only marinated the pork chops for one hour. I also took the advice of other reviews and added spices.

Bought 1.25" thick fatty pork "steaks" with bone-in, marinated 24 hours, grilled low and long for 35 minutes and they were the best pork "chops" I have ever eaten!   Doubled the sauce for my thick steaks.  Used apple concentrate from the can, undiluted.   The fat marbled in the thick steaks kept them nice and moist.  My father is a pork chop enthusiast and was a bit unsure about grilling something so thick.  Take your time, use a bit lower heat and you will end up with restaurant worthy meat, nicely carmelized and very juicy.  Grill up onions and sweet apples on the side.  Marinade was spot on delicious.  Amazing flavor!  Use good quality Dijon mustard. I do not understand the review about having no flavor, perhaps they used poor mustard and did not marinate overnight...

Fantastic recipe! I didn't have apple juice the first time I made it, so I used orange juice instead. I'm sure the apple juice is terrific, but I will continue using the orange juice!

My pork chops were definitely 5 star quality, however I tweaked the recipe slightly. First, I used stone ground Dijon (because that’s what I had on hand) and I only put about 4 tbsp of brown sugar because that’s all I had left. I also used regular apple juice since I had an open bottle in the fridge. Following the advice of a previous reviewer I added garlic powder, onion powder, and thyme as well. I only had time to marinate the three boneless chops I was cooking for about 30 minutes, then I stuck them in the oven at 350 for 35 minuets (turning over halfway through). While the meat was cooking I put the reserved sauce in a pan on the stove and cooked it down (stirring often) and when the meat was done I brushed it with the sauce, heavily coating the chop. It was delicious and so easy to make! Everyone complimented it! I’m definitely making this on a regular basis from now on.

Tasted good. Don't forget to save aside the marinade. Also can use extra honey in glazing.

My husband and I loved it.  A keeper!!!  I did not even marinate overnight.  I did add a little butter at the end of the cooking.  I served it on a bed of jasmine rice with applesauce.

Great recipe, I doubled it and used it more as a bbq sauce for basting. One addition that really made it sing was adding a splash of white wine.

Absolutely delicious !!!!!!!  I used boneless pork chops and let them sit in the marinade for a day.  Husband used the separate saved marinade and brushed it on as they cooked on the grill.  The pork was tender, juicy  and absolutely delicious.   I have made this exactly as written a couple of times and my most recent batch I added just a couple pinches of ground cayenne pepper we enjoyed the marinade both ways.  Thank You for sharing.

These were very good. We both got seconds! Grilled chops are often dry but these were very moist! Next time I'll cut the sugar in half though. They were a little sweet for me.  I added garlic and tarragon as one reviewer suggested. I buy boneless pork loins when they are on sale and slice my own boneless pork chops. Saves alot of money. I put them in freezer bags with different marinades. Freezing really gets the marinade into the meat.  I wonder how these would taste with Sauerkraut ?

My husband said this chop was the best! I didn't have any apple juice, but I did have Redd's Apple Ale, so I used that instead. I am going to definitely make this again.

OH MY!  I make new recipes every week, we hardly EVER have a repeat.  THIS will be a repeat.  I only marinated it for an hour on the counter and I grilled them.  I was cursing MyFitnessPal for not allowing me to eat two whole pork chops!

The chops had a good flavor, but the sauce doesn't stick to the chops like it is in the photo.  I used mango juice instead of orange juice.

Great and easy marinade.  Made this with boneless pork chops since that's what I had.  Placed in the marinade in the morning and grilled them after work.  Let the juices drip off and sprinkled with black pepper before grilling.  I like the idea I saw from another reviewer suggesting some additional seasonings such as onion powder, will try next time.

Very good! I marinated them all day and they had great flavor. These also came out moist, tender and juicy...even the little guy ate the whole thing, and that's unusual for him. I will def be making these again! Thanks for sharing. :)

I substituted Brandy for the apple juice and used all else as directed.  The alcohol will draw the flame, so you have to watch these a bit more closely, but they turned out nicely.

Wonderful marinade for pork chops. We really enjoyed it and will make it again. Love the Dijon mustard and brown sugar.

I put my own twist on this recipe. I used honey instead of brown sugar, added 2Tbs Asian sea salt blend, 6 cloves of chopped garlic & more worcheshire sauce. I didn't have dijion mustard so I used brown mustard and used almost twice as much. I let it sit in a bowl in the marinate for several hours tossing the chops several times throughout the day.  My family loved it.
