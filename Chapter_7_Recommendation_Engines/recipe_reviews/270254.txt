These are some pretty great muffins--and they don't take hardly any time to make either! I used all brown sugar, a full teaspoon each of cinnamon and vanilla, and almond milk in place of regular milk. They have a wonderful banana bread flavor with the perfect amount of spice! And while the muffin recipe is great as written, I think you could completely tailor the "add-ins" to whatever you like! I want to make them again with the addition of dark chocolate chips, or shredded coconut, or almonds---or all three! I also got 17 muffins out of this, and they were perfectly baked in 18 minutes. Thank you for the recipe--I will definitely make these again!

Yes, I'm biased, but I love them so much and they're so consistently great â€” they deserve 5-stars!
