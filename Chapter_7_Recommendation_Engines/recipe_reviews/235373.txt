Pulled pork roast is a huge hit around our house and last year, my son asked for a pulled pork "meatloaf" for his birthday dinner.  He told me he thought it just "sounded good, Mom."  I'd never heard of such a recipe and finally came across one.  It was an even bigger hit than our pulled pork sandwich recipe!  This recipe is almost exactly the same as the one we found a year ago, only difference is our original recipe calls for 4 cups of pulled pork and I don't chop the pork up further, just leave it shredded.  'Tis easy to add or take away veggies from the loaf, just listen to your tastebuds.  Whether you use 3 cups or 4 cups of pulled pork, do keep with the 2 eggs.  I typically make two loaves using a total of 8 cups of shredded pork and 4 eggs.  We always make this recipe using our favorite mustard BBQ sauce made with balsamic vinegar (not found on this site yet) along with Sweet Restaurant Slaw (found on Allrecipes.com).  This is a wonderful recipe; folks may be surprised just how good!

This was great.  I never want regular meatloaf again.  Left overs make great sandwiches.

Tried this as we had pork leftovers. It was not good and the whole family gave it an epic fail.

**I didn't follow the recipe at all, only used it for a jumping board** That being said, it was an awesome use of pulled pork!! Used about 1.5# pork, whole red & green bell peppers, whole white onion, can of rotel, can of tomato sauce, 2 eggs, and salt, pepper, & garlic. Mixed it all together & baked for an hour. It was delicious :-) I topped it with ketchup, but the hubs put BBQ sauce on it...great either way. Thanks for the brilliant idea AND carbless way to enjoy pulled pork!!!

I doubled the BBQ sauce and added 1/2 of the sauce to the mix. I also added some Liquid smoke. It was good but I think I will stick with ground beef or pork in the future.

This recipe hit the spot for flavor and an interesting  way to use shredded pork.  I kept the recipe the same and only substituted a bag of frozen peppers  because I didn't have any fresh on hand. It came out moist and flavorful! We will make this again.

Really a great recipe.  I accidently added 1/2 c to the mixture before putting it in the pan, and then added another 1/2 c to the top.  Made a wonderful glaze and the Barbeque sauce didn't overpower the meatloaf.  Really will make again!  Easy!

This was delicious! I modified the recipe a bit because I didn't have some of the ingredients. I added celery instead of peppers, and I used a little red pepper instead of black pepper. my husband loves spicy food, and he really enjoyed the extra kick from the red pepper. I also added an additional 1/4-1/2 milk to keep the meat moist. I will definitely make this again.

This was different.  I made it per the recipe. It tasted ok, but probably won't make again.

Like others, I really didn't want the BBQ pulled pork again so I came here and found this recipe. Pretty much followed it as written except I didn't have green pepper. I used celery instead. I really had no idea how this was going to come out but everyone liked it. I think I had way more meat than what was called for so I probably should have added more milk cuz it was dry even though I added another egg. But some brown gravy seemed to help and it was gobbled up and voted To Be Made Again!
