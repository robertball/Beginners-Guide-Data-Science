Gave this to my grandfather for Xmas.  He froze it, then thawed out a slice for after dinner every day until it was gone and raved about it!

Thanks Ms Johnson for such a fine recipe. I was scouring the internet for a real good recipe and I found it. I made this special cheesecake for me and my parents. It was a smash hit. And I already have an order for another one when I visit a friends house. This is one of those no sweat recipes that anyone can make. Sooo easy and sooo quick. And the rewards are many when your friends and family try it.

I always make a basic cheesecake since my family doesn't like change.  I threw caution to the wind and made this recipe for a New Year's Eve party. It was a hit - all the men just loved it! Bacardi Select dark rum makes all the difference.  The sauce was the reason - since prior reviews indicated the sauce was runny, I cut the water down to 3/4 cup.  The secret is to bring the sauce to a boil and continue boiling for 5 more minutes while stirring constantly.  Remove from heat and then add the rum.  This is how the glaze for Rum Cake is made so I figured that had to be the way to make it thicker and it worked like a charm.  I also added a touch of Watkin's vanilla for more flavor.  I will note that the texture on this cake is very dense and somewhat crumbly, not like my usual creamy cheesecake.  I will now make this every year for New Year's Eve!

This got rave reviews at the last event I brought it to.  However, the rum flavoring was a little strong for my taste, and I would probably tone it down next time.

It was wonderful and very rich.  I thought the pecan caramel sauce was the best part.

We loved this.  I changed it a little and made it with a grahm cracker crust because that is what I had on hand, and used caremel ice cream topping too.  It was very creamy and smooth.  Mmmm!

It may be easy, but it is way too rich.  We couldn't finish it.  The Sauce was also very runny.  Not one I will make again.

I had never made a "real" cheesecake before.  This recipe was easy and it tasted great.  My father-in-law said that it was better than at a restaurant.  I did bake it longer than the recipe recommended because the middle took longer to cook.  It turned out perfect!

This is without a doubt one of the best cheesecakes I've ever made.  The caramel sauce is awesome!  I'll definitely make this again (my family demands it!)

I am giving this recipe a 5 because my customers loved it.  I on the other hand thought the rum flavor was a bit overpowering.  However, I did use a very strong rum from Trinidad.  Next time I will half the rum and it should be much better.

I made two of these cheesecakes. One for my family and the other to take to a party. It was so delicious that I decided to make a third one because the family had eaten part of the second one. Everyone enjoyed it and the people at the party asked my wife for the recipe. It is rich in texture, smooth to the palate and so easy to make. This was EXCELLENT!! I can hardly wait for the holiday's that way I have an excuse to make them again.

Oh Boy was this tasty. I brought this to a dinner party and everyone seemed to like it a lot. I used the reduced fat cream cheese and golden rum was on sale and dark wasn't, so I used golden. I personally wasn't crazy about the caramel sauce, but it disappeared so maybe I am just weird. I made 1.5 times the recipe for the sauce and used a tad more cornstarch since it seems other reviews thought the sauce was runny. If I was making this just for myself, I'd use caramel ice cream topping, and add in the rum and pecans. I am sure I'll make this again for another gathering. Thanks.

Although the holidays have passed, I'm still making this cheesecake.  I made it twice during December -- once for a friend's holiday party, the other for Christmas dessert -- and both times it was a big hit!  A family friend asked me to bring it to a get-together this weekend.  It's a winner with or without the pecan caramel sauce!

I made this for Christmas Dinner, and had mixed reviews.  The sauce was far to runny for everyones taste.  Most people said it was good but not with the strong eggnog taste that I had promised. My 3 year old loved it though!

I rated this 3 stars because after reading the reviews, I thought it'd be soooo good.  It was good, but not 'SUPER, OH MY GOODNESS, THIS IS THE BEST CHEESECAKE EVER!' good.  I didn't think it was all that, but I made it for company and everyone was raving over it...perhaps it's just me?...or maybe they were being polite?

I made this for thanksgiving this year. First time I've made a cheesecake and the first time I've done any baking since 2003.  It was incredible! I changed the dark rum and put spiced rum in it instead. Next time I'm going to put in a little more nutmeg. And I crushed my own vanilla wafers which I thought was better than buying the already crushed ones. Amazing recipe, thank you very much. This is definetly going to be a tradition for me considering the family fell in love with it!!

Very good recipe! I got a little nervous while cooking it thinking the rum smelled very strong, so I only put about a tsp of rum in the sauce along with some vanilla to sweeten it up. It was a hit!

Good recipe.  Hardest part was getting the cream cheese opened.  I baked it in the pan, wrapped with foil in a hot water bath.  This ensured a creamy texture.  I topped it with confectioners sugar coated sliced almonds.  Served it with homemade caramel sauce.  It was enjoyed by all.

This is a wonderful cheesecake. I have made it many times and my guests love it. I rated it a 4 because of the sauce. I made my own rum sauce. After the cheesecake was cooled I drizzled it with the sauce and sprinkled it with walnuts.

I make this every year at Christmas.  My entire family loves this recipe, even those who don't like eggnog.

this is a wonderful recipe!Easy and delicious! I didn't even make the sauce, the cheesecake alone is perfect! I do believe next time, and there will be many more next times, I will try the sauce just to put it over the top! Fantastic! Everyone loves it! Thank you!
