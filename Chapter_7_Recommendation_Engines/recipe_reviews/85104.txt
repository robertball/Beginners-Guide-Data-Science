I brought this to the family Christmas dinner.  EVERYONE wanted the recipe.
I did change it...only used frozen veggies: used broccoli florets, super sweet corn and whole green beans.  I cut down on the basil/tomato feta and totally forgot the oregano.  I brought it in my electric fry pan so it was fresh and crisp tender.  AWESOME!

My family enjoyed this dish (even my one-year-old). The only thing we would change is that the green beans didn't quite seem to fit. Next time I think I'll try cauliflower or even throw in some onions or peppers. Great flavor, though! I happened to have sun-dried tomato and basil flavored feta, and it was very tasty.

Per the previous reviewer, I tried this recipe with cauliflower in place of the beans, and it was GREAT!!!!  I can't even imagine using green beans for this.  I also used the feta with sundried tomatoes. Great consistency, and rave reviews from all.  Will make repeatedly!!!

This recipe is GREAT!  I used fresh string beans instead of canned and added a handful of chopped onion and about 1 cup of chopped mushrooms.  I am constantly trying to get my family to eat more veggies and they gobbled up this dish like there was no tomorrow!  Thanks so much!  :)

LOVE this recipe - I used frozen veggies (the ones called for), add a little garlic powder and because I didn't have feta I used gorgonzola to taste - wonderful, I didn't eat much dinner, just a big plate of this YUM!!

The colours and texture are nice but using canned green beans in anything other than three-bean salad is something I never do.  Used haricots verts and in place of broccoli, used broccoli rabe as the slightly bitter/sharp flavour went well with the cheese.  I cooked beans and broccoli rabe, separately, to the crisp stage and then heated with the corn.  Plan to do this one again ~ thank you.

This was great.  My kids even liked it.  A wonderful way to serve vegetables packed with flavor.  I only used 2 tbls of butter as my husband is on a heart healthy diet and also had to substitute dried italian seasoning  for oregano.  I used a couple of sprinkles of parmesean cheese for the feta cause I didn't have any of that either.  I was good anyhow.  Thanks

I like all the ingredients/vegetables in this dish  separately, but for some reason, neither my husband nor I cared for the combination of flavors in  this recipe.  I won't make it again.

This was really good.  I used celery salt instead of regular salt and used Lemon pepper plus a little ginger and it turned out really good..  I would recommend going light on the salt.  The chesse made it salty...

There was a divided decision on this... my husband LOVED this and I just thought it was okay. I thought the feta taste was really too strong. I will probably make again (my husband wants me too) but I will scale back on the feta. Thanks!

Good, but somewhat bland.  I used frozen corn that I had cut off the cob last fall. I steamed the broccoli in the microwave for 3 minutes in a ziploc steam bag.  I topped with the feta when served.  I will try this again this summer with ALL fresh veggies.

I used carrots instead of corn, as I'm trying to keep the carbs down. I also used frozen and fresh, instead of canned. My current diet has to be low in sodium, carbs, and cholesterol, so I nixed the salt and used unsalted butter. I think I will add some garlic or onion next time for additional flavor, either in powdered form or finely minced. What I really like about this recipe is the huge variety of veggies you can interchange.

This was good, but it would have been better with fresh or frozen green beans.  I think next time I'll go with less butter as well.

I left out the butter, green beans and corn. I used plain fat free feta and I forgot to use oregano. I was also going to use french style frozen green beans, but I forgot. I don't like canned veggies. They are soggy and full of sodium. I had some left over red bell peppers I had roasted, so I threw those in as well as green onions. I used butter Pam spray and a little chicken broth. I served this w/ a grilled citrus tilapia topped w/ mango salsa. Very nice meal!

Very good! I made some changes, though. I made stuffed mushrooms for an appetizer before the meal, so I threw in the mushroom stems and a sliced onion & sauteed. As a result, I skipped the green beans. I also only had one broccoli bunch instead of two. For the corn, I added a small can of mexicali corn and skipped the oregano - just because I forgot it! It was still very good. Excellent dish! I will be making this one again.

Loved this! Used a can of corn, a can of green beans and fresh broccoli. 
Didn't use all the feta. Warmed the serving bowl, added cooked veggies and then stirred in the feta.

I used frozen corn (microwaved) and steamed, fresh carrots instead of green beans. I forgot to add salt and pepper, so it was only seasoned with oregano and the flavor of the basil and sun-dried tomato feta (which I stirred until it started to melt and then stopped so there were still crumbles mixed throughout). I thought it was rather tasty and so did my husband.

This is an interesting combination of veggies, but it was good. I added fresh sliced mushrooms and 2 cloves of minced garlic to the melted butter first, then added the frozen corn, fresh broccoli and fresh green beans. I only used 4 TBS of butter. My family thought it was just ok. The feta cheese added an interesting twist.

Loved it.Didn't however add the herbs as my 3 year old isn't too keenon them. And to be honest I look at the recipe, the ingredients and just did my own thing.But we loved it. I used a little more feta, and less butter. I also used fresh steamed broccoli, canned beans ( as I am not over keen on them in the "fresh" form) and the corn only. I also added a clove of garlic to the butter before adding the veg. Will definatly make it again. Just again cutting down on the butter. Had this with garlic chicken which you could easily just add chopped to the dish.

This was really tasty and fresh.  Will be fun to experiment with different flavours of feta, and possibly some other types of cheeses to get different tastes.  Quick and easy and will make again whenever I have some spare feta.

A good buddy of mine made this on our ski-trip this winter. Not a bad recipe, but I wasn't as huge a fan as the rest of our party. I felt it had a good flavour, but it was lacking a bit in the presentation and texture departments. Perhaps if one used frozen green beans instead of canned, it would have been more to my liking.

This was a quick and easy dish that I will cook again! I have a few modifications. I couldn't find the flavored feta so I used a few tablespoons of pesto rosso. I added onion powder, garlic powder and Italian seasoning and a little basil infused olive oil. I also used frozen veggies. Delicious!

Something different, simple, yet absolutely delicious.   Even better after a few days.   And I see nothing wrong with using canned veggies.   You can certainly control salt by omitting it in other ingredients.

This recipe has a good beginning "structure" but definitely needed to be switched up for taste and nutrition. I used Extra Virgin Olive oil instead of butter. Sauteed broccoli and corn (omitted the green beans - not a huge fan). While sauteing, I seasoned to taste with Garlic Salt (very minimal), black pepper, white pepper and Himalayan Pink salt. I ended up throwing in some precooked shredded rotisserie chicken (leftovers from last nights dinner). I tossed the feta cheese in after I turned the fire off to make sure it didn't melt too much. The outcome was delicious! Took less than 20 minutes to put together. Not sure if it makes a big difference but I used fresh organic veggies... prepacked from Trader Joes made for a quick throw together. This is something I will make on a regular basis. Served with a sweet/fruity Pinot Grigio and I have a great date night dinner. Next time I will probably throw in some diced red bell pepper for extra color and some sweetness. Thank you ladies who also commented with other options that led me to mine. Hope everyone enjoys their dinner!

I was simply searching to see if 'corn and green beans' could be used together nicely...ran across this recipe.  Since I had leftover corn AND broccoli in the frig, after reading this, I opened a small can of green beans, and after having assembled all in the pan, tossed in the 'leftover from burritos' tomatoes I had, into the pan...the result---hubby and grandson both thought the veggies were great tonight!  
Sooooo, no need to fret if you don't have fresh or frozen everything in a recipe...often good to check out the leftovers for the same ingredients you need...I did change a lot---since I did not have the named cheese, I used the newly purchased bottle of grated Kraft parmesan, romano and asiago cheese...hey, improvise, I always say...lol...
Oh, my broccoli and corn were both frozen before they became 'leftovers.'  

The main dish was my standby porcupines...these veggies and some sweet potatoe fries were a huge hit tonight!  Thanks, Allrecipes.com!

Holy Cow! My kids took one look at this and said no thank you but after trying it they asked for seconds. I omitted the corn and steamed fresh broccoli and green beans before adding them to the skillet. I didn't have feta so I threw in sun dried tomatoes and sprinkled colby cheese on top. Delish!

This was good!  I didn't have feta so I used gargonzola which was good but will definitely use feta next time.  Hubby really like it which surprised me!

This recipe sounds horrible at first, but it's surprisingly good, and easy to fix.

Surprisingly good - only difference I made was cutting down the butter to two TB. Probably really doesn't need any, really. Interesting use of veggie combinations but it worked for us!

It doesn't look that great when you cook it, but it actually tastes pretty good.  My fiancee thought there were too many different flavors in it and suggested taking out the corn, but I thought it was good with all of it.

I'm giving this five stars even though not all of my kids liked it.  I loved it.  I used frozen veggies because that is what I had on hand but I rinsed them with warm water to thaw a little before cooking.  I only used about 1/2 of the feta cheese it called for and plain is all I had.  I will try it again with the flavored kind.  This dish goes great with "No Name Orange Roughy" from this site.

Used fresh broccoli and green beans, but other than that followed the recipe.  Delicious, will definitely make again!  Would go with just about anything, even a salad.

Great for a jump off base. Grilled the broccoli 1st, then added. Left out the green beens, warmed the feta, but didn't melt. Left out the butter & used a little olive oil & hot sauce.
