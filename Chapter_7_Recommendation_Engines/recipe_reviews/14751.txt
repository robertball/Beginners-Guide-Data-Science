AWESOME!! Having a few guests, I used 2 pkgs of chops(10 chops), but each pkg barely weighed a lb...thus they were very thin chops. I used 4 heaping TBLS of brown sugar, added some minced garlic and chopped onions to the ketchup mix and before pouring the sauce overall, I sprinkled S&P and a dash of garlic powder over each chop.  This was amazing!  They were so tender and full of flavor! It was soo easy...will be making again!

This was quite simply the BEST pork chop recipe I have ever tried.  Following the advice of others who reviewed this recipe, I substituted half the ketchup with my favorite BBQ sauce.  Then I poured a little of the sauce down in the pan before placing the chops in.  Finally I covered the pan with foil and baked them for 45 minutes.  Perfection.  They were so tender they melted in my mouth, and my husband and daughter both thought they were absolutely delicious.  I will definitely be making this dish again and again.  Thanks for the great recipe!

To say I was skeptical would be an understatement. These turned out really good. Only thing I would recommend is cook for 45-50 minutes instead of a full hour.  Will definitely make these again.

I read the other reviews and based on comments of blandness and dryness of the chips, I seasoned first with a little salt, pepper and garlic powder.  I also cooked them on the stove top in a non-stick pan.  I cooked them covered for about 30 minutes (adjust for thickness of chops) and then cooked at medium high heat for 10 minutes with the top off so the sauce would thicken.  You could remove the chops while you thicken the sauce to avoid drying them out.

Great new way to serve pork chops! I mixed in the brown sugar instead of sprinkling on top & marinaded about an hour. Also, if you want the marinade to stay on top of chops, just put a little bit of marinade on bottom so chops don't burn and pack them tightly together without any extra space on the sides. Then pour marinade over and it will come out thick & almost glazed on top. My hubby loved this! Definite keeper! Thank You!!

My husband and kids really like this dish. I do make it a little different and that's browning the chops in the hot skillet first, then sauteeing a little chopped onion and minced garlic in a little butter until it "softens", then adding in the cola, ketchup and brown sugar and letting that all cook together. My boys like this either with hot buttered rice or mashed potatoes. For them, this is pure comfort food.

Recipes do not come much easier than this!  I let my pork chops sit in the ketchup/cola/brown sugar sauce for about 1/2 hour.  Baked at 350 degrees for 45 minutes and the chops turned out perfectly.  This would be great on chicken as well.  Five stars for ease and taste*****.

To thicken the sauce....  lightly flour the chops before you put them in the pan.  Put a bit of sauce in the bottom of the pan, then chops, then sauce.  I have made this for up to 50 people and I can even layer everything.  It comes out great every time!

This is the best pork chop recipe for someone who loves tender chops, but doensn't necessarily like the spicyness of barbeque.  Putting foil on the bottom of the pan helps with cleanup, and the sauce is terrific for pouring over the chops when you serve them!  Thanks for the recipe!!!!!

Very Good!  Sprinkled chops with McCormic Smokehouse Pepper,a little salt, patted it in well, and (make sure chops are DRY) dusted with Wondra flour,browned in (happened to have bacon drippings) and a little olive oil.  Turned out great!  I used thick cut chops and baked , at 325 (convection oven) for 1 1/2  hr in a glass baking dish.  My husband and 2 yr old daughter loved it!  Easy and good!  Chops were very thick and they came out almost falling apart!

This is a favorite in my house. It has such a good flavor. I don't have a lot of time to cook so I coat the chops in flour mixed with seasoning salt and pepper. I then layer chops and sauce in crock pot on low for about 5-6 hrs. They are so tender they melt in your mouth. I serve this over white rice, the sauce is very good on rice.

A wonderful recipe, easy to create and my wife loved it(which is saying alot considering she doesn't care for pork)
I found it delightful in both the ease of preparation and taste. I used 4 centre cut chops and kept the recipe the same and they were very tender and had plenty of sauce to spare. I will be using this recipe again.

This recipe really got me going. I changed the 1 cup ketchup to 1/2 cup ketchup and 1/2 cup combination of smokey barbeque sauce and honey garlic sauce. I cut down on the brown sugar to about 1/2 cup and then I mixed it all up with the Coke and threw in a package of onion soup mix. I baked at 350 for 30 mins. (really thin chops) in a foil covered glass pan.   TALK ABOUT AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

This was simply amazing!  My family loved it.  I added less ketchup because I only had 2/3 cup on hand.  Put the chops in a dutch oven lined with tin foil(didn't even need to clean the pan) and poured sauce over the top.  The chops were completely covered from the sauce.  Baked in the oven, lid off for 40 minutes.  I had 4 chops and they were 1/4" thick.  Served it over rice and black bean mixture and poured extra sauce over everything.  There was nothing left!  Success!

Added some red pepper and hot sauce for kick and cooked in a baking bag to keep them from being dry. Great results.

5 stars because my teen hates porkchops, but his first word after taking a bite was "Mmmm this is good!"
Ive tried many different methods,this one is his winner! 
We all loved how the chops were soft & moist too
I just wish Iknew how to thicken the sauce, it was all runny like water underneath!

This recipe is extremely easy and tasty in a very generic "kid friendly" way.  Next time I will try and zip it up with more spice to make it a "hotter sweet" probably by just adding some hot sauce.  I made an error and tried to double the sauce by adding 2 colas - 2 cups of ketchup and 8 teaspoons of brown sugar.  The extra cola was not necessary it just made the sauce very thin and I ended up adding A LOT more ketchup and brown sugar to get the sauce thicker.  Also, I would recommend checking your chops at 35 minutes depending on the thickness/size of your chops.  Mine were completely done at 45 minutes and wished I had pulled them out a little sooner just to prevent any toughness.  I can't see how this recipe calls for 1 hour of cooking time unless you are in high elevations or have a weak cooking oven.  Cooked with white rice and a veggie. Will keep this for a night when I don't have much time, it's VERY easy.

This was honestly the worst recipe I have ever made from 
 Allrecipes and I'm floored by all the positive reviews.  First of all, I think I was lured in by the main photo which is a total misrepresentation of what you actually end up with.   Had I scrolled through the other photos posted, I would have seen the pork chops swimming in ketchup soup like was pulled from my oven.     It did smell good while cooking, I'll give it that, but ketchup mixed with cola and brown sugar?   What was I thinking?   Because that is exactly what it tasted like....dry chops smothered in super sweet ketchup.   I thought maybe the ketchup would caramelize in the oven or something.  Nope.   I even left it uncovered and it was a watery lake.   One bite and my husband and I both were grossed out.   This one was immediately fed to the dog after all the sauce was dumped.

Fast and easy, didn't change a thing. I marinated the chops for about 2 hours.  The only reason I gave it a 4 star rating is that the chops were a bit dry even though I baked them for only 45 minutes.  Will try again baking them for less time.

I'm giving this five stars for two reasons: it took SO LITTLE time to prepare (great for work-night meal) and my super picky 3 year old couldn't get enough. I will be making this again when I need to use some pork chops.

My husband said "you can make this again" which means he liked it! Only used 4 chops but the same amount of everything else, should have halved the sauce as well. SUPER EASY!

I must admit, at first I quite skeptical, but I said why not.  This dish was easy to prepare and delicious and even my 3 yr old ate all of it which is quite an accomplishment.  I would reccomend this to anyone.  The only alteration I did was to bake it for 45 minutes intead of an hour.  This one is definitely a keeper.

My family loved this recipe!  The house smelled great with this great aroma! My husband couldn't wait to eat dinner.  I did season the pork chops with salt and pepper before adding the mixture. I used Diet Coke since that's all i have in the house, and it turned out well!  This is such an easy recipe to follow without compromising a great tasting dinner!!

I initiall thought the recipe sounded quite strange, but it turned out a lot better than I expected.

I cut the recipe down to two pork chops but halved the other ingredients, leaving plenty of sauce.  I also tried to let the chops marinate for a few hours before baking, and added some garlic powder to the mixture.  I figure the longer the chops soak in cola, the more time the acid in the cola has to tenderize the meat.  Marinating would probably help the flavor soak in (re: earlier reviews of it being bland).  If you like meat a little sweet, and you like the slight tang of ketchup, this will definitely please.

I tend to serve with some white rice and veggies.

Too funny we have been making soda-pop chops for a long time and they are a family favorite.  I don't really like all the sweetness to it so I don't really add as much sugar (I just eyeball it) but this will make your chops so delish.  Don't over bake as chops dry out.  You can also use this for ribs...gosh it is delish!! cleanup can be a pain, make sure you spray your pan with a cooking spray or we have also lined the pan with non-stick foil...no clean up issues!

I followed recipe exactly as written and it was not a big hit with my family. The sauce was thin and watery. I would not make this again.

One thing I don't like is over-cooked pork so I only baked this for 45 minutes, I also sprinkled some minced onion on top and it turned out perfect. Very good recipe.

i think you could half the brown sugar in these because if you use regular soda its pretty sweet already. i used coke zero and all the brown sugar and it was a tad sweet. that said these were super tender and a good change up from pan fried pork chops.

Made this last night according to directions, added onion powder and garlic.  It was just okay.  Was very heavy on the 'ketchup taste'.  I probably wont make again.  I have a recipe for cola pork roast that uses cola, cream of mushroom and onion soup mix and it's way better than this.  Sorry.

Suprisingly delicious!! I didn't tell my husband what was in them until after we ate, as he is always skeptical on sauces with ketchup! hahaha... but it didn't matter because it was sooooooo tasty!! 
Made with vegetable fried rice. Will make again for sure!

This was a great recipe. My family loved it. I did do a few differences, I used about little under 1/4 cup bbq sauce in place of some of the ketchup since I ran out and added minced garlic and chopped onions in the sauce. I also seasoned the chops with garlic powder, S & P. It was real good! Even my pickiest eater had two helpings! It is a keeper for us!

They were pretty good. I used boneless chops and they were very tender. I do think that I will substitute BBQ sauce for the ketchup next time and see what that's like.

Sorry, but this was really, really bad. The mixture tasted like watered down BBQ sauce, and the taste after baking was even worse. Would not recommend, nor would I make it again.

These were absolutely delicious! I halved the recipe as it was only for two people (we're big eaters haha) and I added some Worchester sauce, some onions and minced garlic as well.   I served this with some homemade potato chips and we LOVED it! Will be making again very soon.

If you like sweet and tangy meat, then I think this is a good recipe. I liked the juiciness of the meat, but I realized I personally am not a big fan of the sweetness. However, my husband did like it and he is rather judgemental of food he didn't prepare himself. I did add a little hot sauce for him, but that's all I changed.

I've been a vegetarian for the majority of my life so cooking meat has always been a bit tricky for me, yet necessary to keep my meat-eating family happy. These porkshops were a hit at the dinner table! Even my son, a very picky eater, loved them. What else could a Mom ask for? 5 stars!!!

Very easy to make. I was using 8 thin cut pork chops. Used 1/2 cup of barbeque sauce, just under 1/4 ketchup (all I had left), Pepsi and mixed the brown sugar in all together. Sprinkled salt and pepper on the chops before adding the sauce (poured sauce in the pan, added chops, poured sauce over shops). Cooked for 15 mins at 350, then broiled for 5 mins or so at 400 to get the chops to brown and the sauce to stick a bit more. I found the chops tangy, not sweet like some honey-based recipes I have tried. Will definitely make again.

This recipe is very good. I doubled the sauce and substituted chicken breasts for the chops. I cooked stovetop like another reviewer suggested, and they turned out very tender! The only thing I will do differently next time is reduce the brown sugar by about half. I believe the cola provides enough sugar in this recipe, and with the added brown sugar I found the sauce to be a bit too sweet for my liking. Otherwise, the recipe's great!

My kids and husband loved this, and got a big kick out of knowing there was Coke in it. I substituted about 1/4 cup barbecue sauce for some of the catsup, and added a bit of garlic salt. I'll definitely make this again.

I've made this a lot and it is a favorite with the following changes: I use 3/4 cup of ketchup, a whole can of Coca-Cola, and a tablespoon of brown sugar for 8 chops.  Before I put the sauce on, I sprinkle on kosher salt and coarse ground black pepper. After the sauce is poured on, I liberally sprinkle on cinnamon, then cayenne pepper, and then a bit of crushed red pepper.

Very tasty and I love the fact that Cola can be used to make a sweet and savoury dish!  Very simple and quick too.  Will beusing this again.

This was a good easy main dish. I would make it again. I may try it with chili sauce in place of the ketchup next time as I thought it could have used a bit more zip.

The sauce is sweet but not too sweet. Can be easily convert for any amount of servings. Very simple and easy to make. A five star recipe all the way.

I used chicken with this recipe but it was way too heavy on the ketchup taste. My son, who is a ketchup lover thought it was great though! Sorry - won't be making this one again.

I was intrigued by this, but ended up disappointed. When I suggested a few changes to the recipe, my husband asked if I'd try them while he was out of town. It was definitely easy, but not even close to tasty enough to make again.

This was a good dish. However, I think i would use half of the ketchup. The chops had a strong ketchup flavor for my liking. I would also cut the time down a little when I use thin cut pork chops. I used the sauce for gravy with rice. Thanks for the recipe.

This was a very good recipe.  I really enjoyed the different flavor the sauce gave to the pork chops.  I too used onion and garlic to add additional seasoning to the chops.  I thickened the sauce by adding corstarch to the sauce as well (once I removed the chops from the sauce).  I will be making this again.

One of my husband's favorites as well as mine!!!  Sooooooooooooo flavorable.  We love it!  Shared it with a friend and now it is one of hers as well.  I add a bit more brown sugar to give it that extra sweetness.  Ms. Wine can cook for us anytime!!!  Thank you Chiara!

I have made these several times and it is always a big hit.  I can't see to get the sauce to be consistent though, don't know why, sometimes it is thicker sometimes thinner. There are rarely leftovers, even my young children will eat these.

I don't know if I used too much ketchup, because I cut the recipe down, but the ketchup flavor was a little overpowering.  This turned out okay but I don't think we'll make it again, at least for a while.

VERY GOOD PORK SHOPS, I added some honey and more Dark Brown Sugar, my friend loved it and so did I.  My son makes this all the time for his friends, and they love it.  I am thinking of substituting the ketchup for bbq sauce. I added alot of brown sugar and honey.  TASTES WONDERFUL!!!  Will make this for my family more and more.  Next time, we will try 7 up for the Cola or Ginger Ale.

The sauce was amazing (did half ketchup and half BBQ sauce as suggested and also added minced garlic).  Didn't seem to cook into the meat though.  I'd like the sauce to be thicker to serve it over rice or cous cous though.

It tasted okay. My son thought it was real good and he is not a fan of pork. The meat tasted tender. It just wasn't for me, but if I'm ever get a request for pork chops I would probably choose this recipe.

I only had 4 chops, so I halved the sauce recipe and it worked perfectly! The kids really liked this. The pork chops were so tasty. Only thing I did differently was use 1/2 barbecue sauce like someone suggested then, when it was done, I poured most of the sauce into a microwaveable cup, added 1 tbsp cornstarch (first mixed with a little bit of water, tempered it, then mixed into the rest) and microwaved for a minute to thicken the sauce. Wasn't really necessary as the kids didn't want/need the extra sauce. Also, I threw in a few narrow sweet potatoes and regular potatoes into the oven and all were done at the same time. (Add a quick salad...) Nearly work free and very yummy dinner!

This is nothing fancy, but it's so quick and easy! And, the pork chops turned out perfectly cooked and moist. I used more cola than the recipe calls for (a whole 20 ounce bottle), 1/2 cup each of ketchup and barbeque sauce, and the brown sugar. The chops I used were 1 inch thick and boneless. I marinated the chops in the sauce for about an hour before baking for 1 hour uncovered. There was enough sauce to keep the chops 'bathed' in liquid while in the oven so there was no trouble with them drying out. I think next time I will add some fruit (sliced apples, pineapple rings, or whole cranberries) to the baking dish and serve on top of the chops :)

I use this all the time for chicken.. however I leave out the extra sugar.  It is not by any means needed.  With chicken as the protien this weighs in as 6 ww points per serving.  I will give it a try with pork tenderloin.

Yummy! Per another review I let the pork sit in cola over night.  I also did 1/2 cup ketchup and 1/2 cup BBQ Sauce.  I know its cheap, but I used BBQ sauce from McDonald's because its sweet.  My husband and I both thought it was delicious and I will make this again.  I will probably use more BBQ sauce!

My husband swore he did not like pork until he tried these. When I make these I use Coke Zero, double the recipe, use a pork shoulder or pork chops and cook them in a slow cooker... they turn out moist and tender every time!

I was a bit skeptical at first, but the taste of this sauce is yuumy! I add splash worchiester sauce like another review suggested as well. The sauce is so yummy my husband soaked it up with his roll when he finished his chops. It so easy that it almost seems to be to simple to be good but its not!

I thought the sauce was excellent! Just sweet enough for me. I did think the chops were a little bland, so if I make this again, I wll season them, and maybe even let them soak in the sauce for a couple hours. I enjoyed this.

I followed the recipe exactly and it was pretty good.  Then I made it with just one change, I used 1/2 a cup of BBQ sauce 1/2 a cup of ketchup.  That was all it needed. This is now one of my family's favorite meals!!!!  Great RECIPE!!!!!

Very Tasty.  Some changes I made: season with a mix (I used Country Bob's Seasoning), add a little onion powder, floured it, fried it just to brown it. I only used 3 Tbls brown sugar (it was plenty sweet) with the Ketchup and Cola (2nd time I made it I only had Dr. Pepper and it was great). Then baked as recipe called for 350 for about an hour. One time I let it sit in Dr. Pepper or Cola for a few hours and it came out even more tender (and no it doesn't taste like soda : ) ) **Try adding a little Country Bob's All Purpose Sauce for a little more Sweet/Tangy Taste** MMmm mmmm.

I used a small pork loin rather than the chops.  Like so many others, I seasoned the pork.  I used a mix of garlic powder, onion powder, salt, and pepper.  I also used half BBQ and half ketchup, mixed in the brown sugar, and added in chopped garlic.  Poured it over the loin and baked for an hour.  I do wish I would have basted some to keep the loin moist.

I was craving pork chops and came across this recipe.  Seemed too easy...which it was! So easy and the kids loved it too (BONUS)!! New to cooking for a family as my new boyfriend has 3 boys and I now make dinner every tuesday night for them, because of this recipe.  Even the picky 9 yr old came back for seconds which never happens!! Will definitely make again.

Nothing to rave about.  the sauce tasted good but was watery due to the long cooking time.  I have seen better cola marinades that use chili sauce and aren't added until the end of the cooking time.  Maybe this would make the difference.

This was just okay. I will say I think the cola tenderdized the pork somewhat, but I don't see myself making this one again, unless I'm in a pinch.

This recipe rocks! It was super easy & the chops tasted awesome! At first, my 8-year old son & I were a bit sketchy about the mixture of catsup & cola, but we both came around after the first bite... it will definitely be making an encore in our house!

This was definitely easy to make, but I really didn't like it. It just really tasted like I put ketchup on some pork and baked it. It was sort of a waste of pork to me. But if you really like ketchup and pork, maybe you'll like this.

My son, a picky eater, loved it.  We used diet soda, and it had a great flavor, however, the pork was dry.  I would try it again by cutting the cooking time.

This recipe was good, but not the best.  It was very sweet, and there was just too little sauce for the number of pork chops to keep them from drying out. I think I will take another reviewers suggestion and switch the ketsup to chili sauce and see how that comes out.

These chops were ok, not fabulous but not bad. They were simple to make but I only cooked mine for 40 min. an hour would have really dried them out. I also only used 3/4 cup ketchup because that is all I had. I actually think that was fine because it would have had too strong of a ketchup flavor with a whole cup. Also, I didn't measure the brown sugar I just spread some over the top. This was an easy dish but not as good as some of the other chop recipes I have gotten from this site. Probably won't make again.

I took the advice of others and only baked them for 30-35 minutes - they came out fine.  Just a bit too much ketchup flavor for my taste.  Maybe next time I'll add something for a bit more zip.

We didn't like this recipe.  It didn't have a lot of flavor and didn't save me from drying the pork chops out.  I don't think I will be making this again.

I loved this but you should definitly not cook them for an hour.  I cooked mine for 45 minutes the second time I made them and they were WAY too tough.  But, the kids love the sweetness.

My family loved these! I browned the pork chops in a little bit of olive oil first, and only baked them for 40 minutes to avoid drying them out. The sauce was great over the pasta I served with them. I'll make them again for sure!

The sauce is very good.  "Pop on pork chops??" was the reaction from my family, but they came around then they tasted it.  I only had to cook for 40 min...1 hr would have been too much.

These were pretty flavorful, and my husband did like them - but the first time I made them I didn't like the "look" of them. They were white and not very appetizing looking. The second time I quickly seared each side of the chop in a frying pan to get that golden color, then I followed the recipe from there - this was was better.

I didn't like these at all. The meat came out really tough and there was no taste to them. I followed the directions  so I don't know what happened. I won't make them again though.

This was a great recipe!  I made it for my boyfriend and it turned out so juicy and tender!  I love how easy it is and the taste is fantastic.  The only thing I left out was the brown sugar but I made it later with the sugar and it still turned out great!

What a fantastic and easy way to make pork chops.  I wanted to keep eating more, but I am watching my points!  One porkchop was 4 points.  I am talking Weight Watchers for those who don't know.  The only thing I will do different next time is cook it covered in foil.  They were a bit dry.  Or I may try to dump it in the crock pot.

This has got to be one of the easiest and tastiest pork chop recipes ever! After a hard day at work, this is exactley the kind of recipe you need. These chops do tend to taste a little better if you marinade for 20-30 minutes before cooking. Chiara, this is a super recipe and thanks for posting it:)

I recently made this and everyone was very skeptical as I prepared it.  To our surprise, it was a hit :)  The chops were tender and sweet.  Thanks!

Made this with thick pork chops,they were not tender at all. Maybe it needed to be covered until almost done. Sauce was good over rice. Don't think this is one I will make again.

These were okay.  I must be missing something, as many others thought they were great.  I marinated the chops for an hour before cooking and although the sauce was good, I found the chops to be bland.  I'm not sure I'll make these again.

My husband and I loved this!! Only regret, I didn't make more sauce. I cut the recipe down to only serve 2. I added some garlic. This was actually very close to the Elgant Lemon Pork Chop Bake I found on allrecipes. Will definately make this again.  Next time will add lemon though. My husband and I enjoy the flovor the lemon adds to pork chops! Thanks for this recipe, it was soooooo quick and delicious.

This was so good! I used Diet Coke (Weight Watchers....no points!) and it turned out great. It was SOOOO easy! That was my favorite part. Rice is a good side dish and you can put the sauce over it.

I reduced the recipe down to 2 servings.  It called for 1/4 cup each of cola and ketchup.  I added a bit more than a 1/4 cup of cola though.  We thought it was very good and I want to try it in the slow cooker next time.  The only thing I would do is add some salt and pepper or something to give it a bit more bang.

This was very good. The chops were very moist and flavorful. I didn't use as much brown sugar as the recipe called for, so there there was a slight ketchupy taste (but not overpowering). Next time- I'll use full amount. Will definitely make this again.

This is a very good recipe.  I made it with beef short ribs and substituted a jar of chili sauce for the catsup.  I also adjust the brown sugar to taste sometimes adding a little more.  I brown the short ribs in a little oil and then put them in a roaster pan and bake covered at 350 degrees for a couple hours until tender.  Then I put the ribs and sauce in my slow cooker on low and just let them there until ready to serve.  Yummy !!

I am a person that never liked to prepare pork chops, #1, because I don't really like them, and #2, my husband would always make fun of the way I cooked them, saying they were like "rawhide".  Dry and yucky!  UNTIL I tried this recipe!  So easy, so great, we all loved it, especially my 4 year old daughter, she ate a whole chop by herself.  This is a great recipe!  Thank you!

I made this recipe for mother's day.  We had 10 guests.  Everyone raved about how tender the pork chops were and then were astonished to see how easy the recipe was.  I then sent this recipe to my sister-in-law who has two picky eaters (not including her husband).  They also loved it.  This is definitely a favorite of mine.

These were the best baked chops I have ever eaten!  I cut the amount of ketchup in half and added a little more brown sugar.  I then baked them in a roaster at 350 for about 2-3 hours.  They were the best!!!!!  My whole family enjoyed them very much.  We now have a new favorite!!!  Thank you!

The recipe was ok however  you SHOULD use your favorite spices otherwise chops are very saucy and bland. I will use even more seasoning next  time.

Delicious recipe.  Made four 1" chops, but full sauce recipe using half ketchup and half  barbecue sauce.  Just right proportion.  Took about an hour uncovered and was tender and juicy.  Good for company or family dinners.

Reduced cooking time to 45 mins, next time will test at 30mins as was a tad dry. Flavour delicious, only additives was a sprinkle of onion salt and garlic powder. Added some sauce to bottom of tray first. When finished cooking I transferred sauce to saucepan and reduced it until it thickened. Husband and I loved it. Will definitely do again. Maybe chicken thighs next time.

Really good flavor. Only complaint was sauce was too thin and watery.  Will make again and will try other suggestions to thicken the sauce.

I wanted a quick easy meal to throw in the oven. 
I made chops for two.  Only used about ½ of the ingredients. 
Easy, easy,  served with a wild rice mix. I was concerned it would be too bland so added about ¼ cup of  sweet chili sauce to the sauce mix.  Chops were nice and moist and had a good flavor.  I would make this again.

If you use thicker boneless loin chops like I do be prepared to bake the full hour. I browned on stovetop first baked 45 minutes covered with foil, 15 minutes more foil removed. Yummy!

Good but be sure to adjust the time for the thickness of the chops so they don't dry out.  Also, thickening the liquid portion of the sauce and using it as a "gravy" would be good.

I had high hopes for this recipe because of the reviews and because it was so easy.  Sadly, we found it to be very bland. I did adjust the recipe and cut it in half-there's just my husband and me. Maybe that's why. I think I'll probably be sticking to plain old BBQ chops in the future.

I used boneless chops and didn't feel like the chops absorbed any of this flavor. They just tasted like meat. My chops weren't tender either. Won't be making this again.

Meat was still tough after the hour so I cooked it for another 20 min.  Then it was dry.  The cola sauce did not glaze on the meat.

I didn't need eight chops, so I halved the recipe and it worked great. I would make these again because they were easy, I almost always have all the ingredients, and we enjoyed the flavor and the tenderness.

Based on previous comments I added salt, pepper and Mrs Dash then quickly browned in a hot pan.  Because some complained the sauce was runny I added 2 tablespoons of cornstarch to the cola/ketchup before pouring over chops. Worked great!  I thought it was a little too sweet but hubby thought it was great! I'd definitely make this again.

DELISH! I used 6 large pork chops seasoned with a little salt  pepper followed with other ingredients. Cooked for the hour wasn't tender enough for me covered at that point turned temperature down to 250 cooked additional 30 minutes. Melt in your mouth! I will definitely make again.

it was good.  We have used cola to marinate tough pieces of meat and game for years.  Just add some Good Seasons Italian dressing  to the marinade (discard before cooking) and they will eat it before filet mignon.

Will probably make it again, but may spice it up a little, maybe some Chipotle or onion.
Also, may substitute Dr. Pepper for the Coke, just for my own curiosity. 
Loved that the chops were nice and moist. Really hate dry pork except for the snibbles that accompany a good toast!

Sorry, but I just didn't like this.  Followed the directions, but reduced the servings to two.  The pork turned out dry and tough even after cooking it tightly covered for half the time.

The only change was adding the brown sugar to the liquids. I also marinated pork chops in sauce for 3 hours. 1st half of cooking time it was covered.
The flavor was good and my problem may have been too thick and not enough fat on the chops. Chops were dry.

I use this recipe with some alterations.  Instead of chops, I use a pork loin, put it a smaller crock pot and sprinkle 1 packet of Onion Soup Mix and pour over 1 can of cola.  Set it to low and it will be falling apart in about 4 hours.

This also makes great gravy!  Drain the liquid (to get onion bits out) and let it cool slightly in a saucepan. Sprinkle in Wondra flour whisking the whole time until it is the consistency you want.

My family loved this!  I sliced up a pork tenderloin about 1-1/2 inches thick instead of using pork chops.  I also took another reviewer's advice and used 1/2 ketchup and 1/2 BBQ sauce.  I put salt and pepper, plus sprinkled a little brown sugar on both sides of the pork.  Then covered with the soda/ketchup/BBQ mixture and cooked for 40 minutes.  The pork gets done quickly, you have to watch it!  Served with rice-a-roni and broccoli.  Everything was gone!  So easy.

No, I didn't make any changes and it didn't come out as the picture shown. I dont know if I should have used a thicker cut Pork Loin because I used the thin cut. All the same it came out very tasty but I had way too much juice left over

Only gave 4 stars , since I didn't follow the recipe and learned from previous reviews to spice up the chops first (I used garlic salt and pepper & even a pinch of regular salt).
I can't imagine this recipe being any good without any added spices as it calls for.
I also took the advice and went half & half with ketchup & Bbq sauce.
I only made 1 chop and devided the ingredients appropriately, but made a calculation mistake and almost doubled the bbq/ketchup.
Added a little bit of red wine , too.
And thinly sliced onion on top of chops.
Baked covered for 20min , then turned chop over and stirred sauce. Baked for another 20min uncovered.
Then turned chop around again and broiled for 4min, once again turn and broiled for another 4min.
I served it over macaroni and it tasted awesome.
So good , that I'm already thinking of making it tomorrow again!
I consider myself to be a great cook and make a lot of gravies & dishes from scratch.
This porkchop recipe is definitely a keeper (by making the changes I did).
Almost forgot: I also added butter & pam spray to the bottom of the pan before adding the chop or any other ingredients.

I made it last night - We both liked the sauce with the additions of onions, garlic and worcestershire sauce,  The timing was off for me, though.  I only baked it for 45 mins and the chops were over done.

Followed recipe accordingly other than adding salt, pepper, and garlic powder.  One hour dried out the pork chops and the sauce was a little too "ketchupy" for my taste.  My son and husband liked them, so I may try this again with less time in the oven and less ketchup.

Honestly, I marinated the chops in the sauce for an hour and then grilled them. I tasted no difference between a regular chop. I replaced the ketchup with bbq sauce. I will make again but I will bake them to see if that makes a difference.

I liked it but I think it needed more coke. But we grilled it out and it tastes really great, also it could have marinated longer to make the pork tender. Otherwise I would make this again.

I always cook my baby back ribs in cola (adding nothing else; simmer until the meat literally falls off the bone then grill with favorite bbq sauce) so this was a no-brainer.

I used 1/2 ketchup and 1/2 BBQ sauce added minced garlic, onion flakes and little less than 1/2 brown sugar. It was very good but needed to let the sauce thicken.
We liked the sauce and did let it sit for about an hour to absorb some flavor

Really, really good as is.  But for a twist try skipping the brown sugar and using Baby Ray's Original BBQ sauce rather than ketchup.

Great recipe.  LOVED it.  I followed the suggestion of adding the onion and garlic, but I used the powder instead of sliced/minced.  Still turned out GREAT!

These where really delish, I didn't have enough ketchup,  so I added Bbq sauce to make a full cup Which ended up with about equal parts, so I omitted the brown sugar from the recipe and broiled them at the very end to caramelize the sauce on  top of the chops.... we will definitely make these again!  Thanks for the great recipe

My college roomies and I made this for dinner back in the day (70's)--it was on weekly rotation, it was so easy and tasty!!  And it also kept those inexpensive, thin-cut pork chops from drying out while they cooked.  Thanks for the Blast from the Past!!!

Love this! I season the chops first (salt, pepper, seasoning salt, garlic powder, etc), and I add a bit of minced garlic to the dish. Then I use half ketchup, half BBQ sauce. Sometimes I forget the brown sugar & nobody notices. It's just so tasty! Hubby is always disappointed that there isn't more meat once it's gone.

Very tasty.  I used Pepsi Next because that is what I had and added a palmful of dried onion, one minced garlic clove, wor. sauce, and a couple of dashes of hot sauce.  I used 3/4 cp of ketchup and 1/4 cp of bbq sauce and only three tbsp of brown sugar.  I cooked it in an oven bag and it was very tender and moist.

I'm not a big fan of pork chops, but this was pretty tasty.  I marintated the pork chops for about 1/2 an hour before cooking and only baked for 45 minutes.  Definitely something I will make again for my family.

Great Recipe - I followed the advice of others' and reduced the cooking time.  The first time I made it I followed the ingredients exacty and agree that it is a bit on the bland side but, my picky toddler thought it was great.  The next time I substituted chili sauce for the ketchup and it had some more pep.  SUPER easy!!

Very tasty and easy. I marinated the pork in the cola & ketchup for about 1 hour before cooking. I also added a dash of ground cloves to the marinade. Then I sprinkled with brown sugar and cooked for about 40 minutes. Great with rice!

This was a great recipe, i was a little scared to put ketchup into cola, but it turned out excellent.  Best of all the whole family loved it. It is a great contrast of tastes, and the perfect sweet sauce for the sweet craving pork.

These were okay!  I doubled the recipe but using less ketchup, (as noted in other reviews) for the extra sauce.  Sauce was quite runny, but added in cornstarch and it turned out much better then.  It was great on the rice, and the onions on top were awesome.  Next time I will try with a reg cola pop, not diet to see if there is a change.  Will make again though.

My wife called it "the pork version of meatloaf" (referring to the sweet ketchup-laden sauce).  I think this recipe is fine for when you're in need of making something quickly with pork, but is generally not something that will make my mouth water in the future.  Another note - I used pork loin sliced into 1" thick cuts.  This recipe probably calls for a chop that's less lean.

These were pretty good, but they need something.  They tasted kind of bland.  However, they were very easy to make.  I'm not sure if I'll make them again.

Well, it is quick and easy, but I was disappointed with the flavor and the dryness of the pork chops.  I think if a person used a Renyolds baking bag or covered the pork chops with tin foil it would help with the dryness. As for the flavor, it is good if it was multiplied by 10.  There just isn't enough punch to it.  If you like mildly flavored food you would probably like it.

When my husband looked at the recipe he had this look of disguest on his face.  But luckily whatever I put in front of him he will eat.  He went back for thirds!  This recipe was a hit.  He told me that it was the best pork dish that I have made.  I did sub honey and brown sugar flavored bbq sauce for the ketchup.  Will make again.

My daughter loved this more than I did.  I think I might adjust the recipe next time and maybe try some barbecue sauce instead of ketchup, and a little less cola.

These cola chops were great.  I put them in my roaster and they were wonderful.. My Hubby who does not like sauces, really enjoyed them.  I am going to try it on chicken next.  Thank you for a fast and easy recipe that has now been added to my collection. Jill

These were tasty, but awfully sweet, even after I cut the ketchup in half as others suggested.  Next time I might try using chili sauce instead of ketchup to give a little more kick.

This is the second time I made these. The first time I wasnt all that impressed for some reason. But this time we really enjoyed these chops. I bet they are really good with rice, which I will have with them the next time. Even my picky kids liked them.
