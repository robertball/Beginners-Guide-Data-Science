I love baked apples so I gave this a try to go along side pancakes for breakfast.  I used two Granny Smith apples, brown sugar vs. white and upped the cinnamon a bit.  I baked it longer than 15 minutes... and this can easily be done in the microwave if you're short on time.

Baked two apples, and it took about 25 minutes for them to become tender.  Taste is pretty much like an apple pie filling.  The Granny Smith apple gives you a nice tart contrast to the sweetness of the sugar-cinnamon mixture.  Next time, I'll try using the granulated Splenda to reduce calories.  Very nice, fresh side dish or dessert (either with a dollop of whip cream or a scoop of ice cream).

This rarely happens, but this recipe was strange. It is a new recipe and baked apples sounded great! I thought the cornstarch was different but decided to give it a try. I am unsure of the purpose of the cornstarch because it was like eating apples in paste.

one Tablespoon of corn starch to 2 1/2 Tablespoons of water does make wallpaper paste.  I made it again with two apples, 5 tablespoons of water and a teaspoon of cornstarch, with a bit extra of cinnamon and 3 Tablespoons of honey.  That made the sauce something to spoon over ice cream with the apples.

I tried this exactly as it states and it was good but the cornstarch and water was like a gummy sludge on the bottom of pan. Other than that the apples were very good. Not sure what the cornstarch and water was for.

This recipe is great! It is super easy and fun for the kids. TIP: when the apples are finished baking and you unstick the apples from the baking sheet, there is clear sticky stuff under the apple slice. That is the stuff that you want, that is the sugar and the sweetness of the apple. If you want your apples to be sweet make sure you eat that also. It is not going to hurt you, it is just the sugar that has been baked. Hope this helped!

I did this with two apples and sliced them down like you would for a pie. My toddler loves fruit, so I wanted to give her something a little sweet but still kinda healthy. I didn't change the amounts of sugar, water or cornstarch. I also added 1 tbsp of lemon juice and upped the baking time to 25 minutes (I didn't want the apples too mushy and that was just right). According to a nutrition calculator I use, this makes it around 45.5 calories for 6 servings (remember, I'm serving this to my toddler). All in all, this recipe was great. The only real change I made was using the lemon juice. If the baby doesn't like it, it is not the fault of the recipe! This tastes just like apple pie filling!

After having read the reviews, I decided to use less cornstarch than suggested.  I also baked for a longer time.

My husband and I loved this. I used brown sugar and white sugar and poured melted butter over it. Bake time is a little off for my oven. I had to cook it about 25 minutes. I think next time I'll add oatmeal to give it a nice, crispy topping.

I enjoyed this recipe. I made it almost exactly the way the recipe said, except that I doubled it and didn't put quite as much sugar, since it was for my 2 and 4 year olds. The cornstarch does thicken quite a bit, but I pulled it out and stirred the mix twice during cook time, so it didn't stick to bottom as one reviewer stated. I liked it, but might increase the water to cornstarch ratio, as it seemed a little powdery in the end.

I think I might add a little honey and walnuts when I make it again.

My family loved it.  Very simple to make.  I added a little brown sugar, honey and put more than a dash of  cinnamon on the apples.  Next time I need to have some vanilla ice cream on hand.

The apple slices were done before they were cool. Everyone loved them. Easy to make, but perhaps you should double the recipe when making because they won't last long.

I made with 6 apples, but used one half sugar & one half brown sugar, (about 1/2 cup in total), and added juice from 1/2 lemon and a bunch more cinnamon.  Baked more like 25m.

Served with pork loin  in place of applesauce,  was great.

Found it extremely delicious! Ate them with some buttered toast and they reminded me a lot of apple-cinnamon mermelade but with a lot more substance, which I actually appreciated a lot more. Will bake again!

Took  the suggestions of others and doubled the water and put less cornstarch.  Make this to put apples on top of a casserole and it was a nice addition.

I was craving baked apples and this looked quick and simple. It was a disappointment because of the cornstarch. It was nothing but a paste taste. I will try again and will leave out the cornstarch.

Simple enough to follow, tasty results. When I make them again, I won't use the cornstarch. It didn't become saucy, it was more gelatinous.

I skipped the cornstarch, might try including it next time. My apples turned out slightly over-baked and mushy so I will shorten the cooking time when I make this again.
