This is the best way to cook the cheaper cuts of meat!  I bought 4 cube steaks for $5 bucks.  I cooked the garlic, peppers and onions in oil first then placed in the baking dish.  Then I salted and peppered the flour. Dredging the steaks in that.  I browned both sides of the steaks in vegtable oil, removing them when browned.  Then I deglazed the pan with 1 14.5oz can of beef broth, letting it reduce also.  I then placed the steaks in the bottom of the baking dish and placed the pepper mixture on top, then poured the broth drippings over that and baked.  WONDERFUL....feeds a family of 5 for under $8.00. Add a slice of provolone to the top also for a variation.  THANKS!

I've been making this for a while, but instead of water, I use a large (15oz) can of tomato sauce and a spash of worcestershire sauce.  This is one of those recipes that you can adapt to your own tastes.

We loved it! 
I don't know why a couple of others didn't see the 2 cups of water in the ingredients. (Maybe the contributor added it later??)
I also browned the cube steaks in the
same pan after I removed the peppers, garlic, and onions. I also added beef bullion to the water and poured it over the whole thing. 
It is a great way to make cube steaks!
I served it with mashed potatos and a side dish of yellow squash.
I might try a pressure cooker next time to get it done quicker.

Great recipe!  My husband loved it!  I made it a second time on the stove to save time.  It cooks in about 10 minutes on medium heat and tastes just as wonderful. We love it with fettucine alfredo and green beans.

My husband really liked this pepper steak.   He went back for seconds which means a lot in my household.  I followed the suggestion of another reviewer and sauteed the peppers, onion, and garlic then poured it over the top.  I also added a few beef boulion cubes to the water.  I would make this again.  It takes forever to cook this meat fork tender so dont try it if your in a hurry.

Turned out great, however, instead of water I used a can of Campbells French Onion broth. Also seasoned the meat and flour for a bit more flavor. Served with mashed potatoes and corn on the cob. Boyfriend loved it!

Good recipe,  I made this on the stove top in about 10 minutes instead of putting in the oven.  I browned the steaks and sauted the onions and garlic  in a little butter then I  used 1-1/2 cup beef broth and 1/2 cup of red wine in place of the water to deglaze the pan.  I added the peppers at the last just to warm them.  Last I sprinkled shredded swiss cheese to the top.  I served over some left over rice.  I will fix this again for a quick dinner

Update.  I am no longer eating meat.  I made this with Portabellasin stead of the meat and used vegtable broth.  Yum.

I will give this 3* because I haven't even tried it yet. It sounds good but the directions say to pour in water but doesn't give any amount.

This recipe was quick to prepare and very tastey. However, I was in a hurry to cook something good...fast so I cooked in a hurry and realized only after I had everything going in the stove that I didn't quite follow the cooking method, lol. Good thing this wasn't a complicated dish as I have made pepper steak many times over the years, but was looking for a new way. I found this recipe and read it,went right into the kitchen and began cooking it my old way (I am still trying to figure out that move, but anywho)in a wok, I added about a 1tbs. of oil and stir-fried green peppers, onions, sliced garlic and canned mushrooms. Eyeballed a couple of shakes of soy sauce that sizzled into the pan. Then added the floured cubed beef and the water and then poured into a 13X something pyrex pan that I lined with foil (for easy cleanup), and placed in the oven covered until meat was tender. I served over basmati rice with a tossed garden salad. I had no need to add salt to this as I was serving extra soy souce on the side as a condiment. It was very tastey and have added it to my next months dinners, next time I will try cooking it exactly as the recipe states. Thanks again

It smelled like heaven while it was cooking. I used only a little flour (I'm watching my carb intake), mixed with garlic powder, onion powder, basil and oregano and sauteed it in a tbsp. each of evoo and butter. When it was time to cook the peppers, I added 1/2 sliced onion, minced garlic, a little more basil and oregano and a little more evoo, I used one can Campbells beef broth instead of plain water (I read a lot of reviewers thought that adding a bouillion cube was a good addition but I didn't have that on hand, so I used the beef broth instead) and 1/4 c. Burgundy wine and cooked it down. I poured it over the cube steak and then cooked it for an hour and a half. I was really trying to give it another boost of flavor. My family thought this was really good and nothing remained. Cheap to make and really tasty. I served it with Cauliflower with Dijon Sauce and Garlic Rice for my boys. I'd make this again.

This gets a 5 star from us. Hubby ate 2 plates full. I did cook this on the stove top and add the suggested beef bouillon cube. I hope my review is still considered by those that read it.  It is just to darn hot here in Texas right now to heat up the house with the oven. A keeper for sure!!!!

My family has been making a version of this dish for decades.  We've always made this recipe on the stove top in a dutch oven.  Pretty much follow all the steps described in this recipe but instead of transfering to a casserole dish just keep the mean in the dutch oven and reduce heat to low and cook for an hour and a half.

I have t say, this recipe was great.  It makes a hearty dinner for four, four about $5!  I did make a few changes.  I used top round steak, because its cheaper.  I also took the other suggestions about using beef broth instead of just water.  Also, when I took the pan out of the oven, I used some flour to make a thicker gravy and served over mashed potatoes.  YUMMY!

We really like this recipe.  I followed some advice from previous reviewers.  I used a cup of water/a cup of tomato sauce and 2 TBSP of worchestershire for pizazz and I deglazed the pan with it.  We cooked the vegies a little first too.  Served w/brown rice.  Will make again, for sure.

My fiance loved this recipe when I made it a month ago and asked that I make it again tonight.  I'm terrible at making or thickening gravy so the only change I made was to take the meat out when it was done and simmer it in beef gravy that I bought at the grocery store  :)  Very juicy and tender.  Thanks for the recipe.

This was good and the steak was nice and tender. Took the advice of others and used beef broth instead of water, also deglazed the pan with the beef broth before pouring over the steak. We felt it could have used a little more flavor and we didn't care for the way the outside of the steak got soggy/slimy. I think that dredging the steak in flour caused the unpleasant texture and will try leaving out the flour next time. Will definately make again adding my own adjustment to make it a 4 or 5 star recipe in my book....

I made this for my family about two months ago. It was delicious and I only changed a few things. First, I added one chopped jalapeño and stir fried it when I cooked the onion. Second, it needed a little more flavor so I added 1 tsp of cumin. The last small change I made was to use 1 1/2 cup of water, and 1/2 cup of cream, then cook over the stove to have a quicker meal. It came out simply amazing.

I was surprised I thought this was so bad because I'm not a picky eater. The gravy was weird and the meat needed to cook ALOT longer.

This is so good! My family went nuts over this. The only thing I done different was to mix 1 package of Liptons beefy onion dry soup with the 2 cups of water. Scrumptious!!!  I will definitely make this again.

I liked this but, I can't give it too many stars because I doctored it up quite a bit. I added celery and a ton of pepper and salt. I used beef broth instead of water. After it had cooked for about an hour and a half I made a flour slurry with half a cup of milk and 3 tbs flour and added it to my beef broth. Then put it back in the oven for about half an hour. It cooked down more and was much more flavorful.

I gave this recipe four stars because it was a little bland. But, it is an excellent base dish and can be seasoned with to suit any taste. It is definitley a keeper for our house it gives us something to do with cube steaks other than chicken fry them.

Great way for steak inside, not on grill.  It is nice to just throw it in the oven, very easy!  However, it has to be done on a night when waiting works.

the meat was super tender, but the flavor wasn't all there. It seemed to need something but not sure what.

My Grandmpther made this often with a couple of changes. We used a cup of beef broth and a cup of V-8 juice for a bolder more tomato based gravy. Also I cooked longer it longer. Makes a great family dish, especially when strapped for time and money.

This was a great Sunday dinner!  It takes a little long but worth the wait.  Instead of onions I used carrots and and a 15 oz can of tomato sauce with 1/2 cup of water and served over rice.

I only gave it a 4 because I didn't follow the recipe exact..I took some of the other reviews and swapped the water..I wound up using Classico's Triple Mushroom sauce...and cooked it 1:15.  Other than that..the steak is very tender.  I will definitely use again.

I really wanted to like this one but...I did not so much.  Boyfriend didn't like it either.  The steak was okay, not great, and the vegetables were way too soft and practically falling apart.  It definitely was not worth the hour and a half it took to cook it.  I think it would have been a much better plan to simply omit the flour and cook the steak on the stove, adding the onion, pepper, and garlic and just left it at that.

This is a good recipe for what it is; using flavorful veggies and gravy to hide a cheap cut of meat. I seasoned the meat and flour with seasoned salt, pepper, and garlic. I sauteed the veggies first, and I used a red bell pepper instead of the green since we don't care for green bell peppers. I also added fresh portabello mushrooms, and added a can of beef broth (mixed with veggies, the broth made a tasty gravy). Served this with mashed potatoes, broccoli and cheese sauce, and French bread. Made a yummy, easy, tasty meal.

My family really loved this! I changed a few things after reading some of the previous reviews. I took other reviewers advice and added the 2 bouillon cubes to the water, deglazed the pan with it and then added to the pan. Then about 10 minutes before it was done I added about a 1/4 cup of milk with a Tbsp. or two of flour to the broth which made a really good gravy. 
I normally LOVE green peppers but I didn't care for them in this recipe. I didn't really think it went so I will omit them the next time.

We tried this but omitted the vegetables because we didn't have any onion on hand.  It was still good.  We had some garlic and used that.  We deglazed the skillet with a cup of beef broth, but maybe should have used 2 cups. It was a nice main dish.

This is positively the worst dish I have ever made.  I had to ditch it and have my husband pick up some fried chix.  To me, it tasted like greasy hamburger meat.  I followed the recipe and even took someone else's suggestion of adding beef boullion to the water.  I would probably prefer hamburger helper to this dish.

This was pretty good and the meat was really tender.  Next time I will add some soy sauce and maybe thicken the sauce before serving. I missed that asian edge that most pepper steak recipes seem to have.

A definite keeper!  I followed the suggestion of using a can of French Onion soup instead of the water (Beef broth would work well too).  It really boosted the flavor. I served it with mashed potatoes the first time.  I served leftovers with fried rice.  I love finding different recipes for inexpensive cube steaks.  Well done!

This is SOOOO GOOD... I follow all the recipe, however at the end, I sometimes put some Swiss or Pepper Jack Cheese on top the last 10 min.... My BF loves this & asks for it frequently... It's almost like a Philly Cheese Steak without the rolls (& calories!)  TRY it, you won't be disappointed...

GREAT recipe.  Usually I use a can of cream of mushroom soup when making cube steaks making it so rich.  
This time I used a beef granule and JUST one cup of water. Thoroughly enjoyed it.  Loretta P.

Turned out well. Only 4 stars because for me I like a bit more flavor, and I did not use 2 cups of water ( that would have been too much, only need enough water, to coat the bottom of baking dish. Over all a great recipe.

I used beef broth instead of water and doubled the recipe. Turned out great! Very tender. I made gravy out of the leftover juice and the seasoned flour that I dredged the meat in.

Not a bad recipe.  Meat was nicely tender following the recipe but it had no "kick".  I like spicy food and expected a little more from this.  I'm going to be adding some Cajun spices to it next time I make it.

I followed everything to a T and needless to say both my children and my fiance scrapped their plates and the pan! I needed something different and this just hit the spot! Delicious!

I didn't know how this one would go over with the kids, but they wanted seconds!  That's saying a lot because they usually don't like cube steak no matter what I do to it.

Absolutely good! I too cooked this on the stovetop,simmered for about 20 minutes to allow peppers to cook. I added 2 Tbs of gravy master (or worchester sauce?) to brown and season the liquid.

We thought this was pretty bland, even using beef broth instead of water and adding an extra garlic clove as well mushrooms and red peppers. The steak had a mushy outside from cooking in the water, and the veggies were way too done.

This was really good and super easy!!! I used yellow pepper instead of green just b/c I didn't have green. Added some garlic salt to it as well. Other than that, it turned out great and my husband, Dad and 4 yr old loved it!!! As did I. I served it over mashed potatoes.

I revised this a bit by using beef broth instead of water and also adding a bit of gorgonzola cheese right before serving as a garnish. I thought it was pretty good but still a little tough as far as cube steaks go, the only way I'd ever made cube steaks before was using them for chicken fried steak and they always turn out good like that but I was looking for other ways to use them since they are so budget friendly. MY husband however did not like them at all..said it was really grizzly and thought that they could have used another hour or so in the oven...I will probably not make again with cube steaks but the recipe itself if used with a chuck steak will be on my list to try :)

Made changes like others suggested: sauteed onions, garlic and peppers first and de-glazed the pan (after browning the meat) with beef stock.  Other than that, followed the recipe and still there was something missing.  Served with rice and steamed broccoli.

YES;)  Oh this is good.  I didnt use veg oil, I used virgin oil instead.  Added mushrooms and some beef booblons as well.

I just had my first bite, and it was soooo moist;)  This is good.  For a single guy trying to impress, this will be made again...with a female in mind;)

I did not like this recipe.  The cube steak had no flavor.  I needed to add way more salt then I wanted to for it to taste like anything.

This is good, easy, and cheap. I make it fairly often.I always kind of do my own thing with seasonings, though.

This was great, even with substitutions.  I didn't have stewed tomatoes, so I used a can of Rotelle and I had a can of whole tomatoes, so I drained the juice, chopped up the tomatoes and added them too. It did need a little cornstarch at the end for thickening as others suggested.

My husband said "This is a keeper."  I did take advice of others and sauteed the veggies.  Then seared the meat.  Also added a splash of soy sauce, and used veg. broth instead of water. Thanks for the recipe!
