I  have made this twice and have loved it! I had it as leftovers both times as well, using it for breakfast sides, as well as dinner sides. I didn't have any chipotle pepper, so I used white pepper instead. Also, I chopped everything up, put it into a bowl, then added the oil and seasonings, then tossed. I also lightly oiled the pan as well to prevent sticking. Delicious!

This is one of my go to recipes for Holidays and potlucks. I always peel the potatoes and have tried unsuccessfully to get the original recipe changed. Cooking time depends on the size of your sweet potato chunks. This recipe can be done in the crock-pot or instant-pot as well to save oven space.

This was excellent!  Thanks for the inspiration!  (I believe I posted my review on the wrong recipe--chalk it up to "I got the too-much-to-do Christmas blues"...)

This is the simplest recipe EVER! I actually tripled the recipe for a 4th of July family gathering. Even so, prep was incredibly easy. I also substituted HONEY for coconut oil....cinnamon and red pepper flakes. 

It was a HUGE hit, has been requested twice since and will become a staple in our menu.

The fam loved it, even the ones who don't like sweet potatoes! I used 2 apples, went very light on the Chipotle pepper, didn't use quite a whole Tbsp of cinnamon, and heavy on the Himalayan salt.

This is an absolutely delicious combination of flavors. Both my husband and I loved it. I will definitely be adding this to my dinner rotation list.

I am making it again tonight. My family loved it. I didn't have Chipotle so I used cayenne pepper instead. It was sweet and spicy. I think this time I am going to toss the potatoes with the oil before I put them on the baking sheet and since we love cinnamon I am going to use a bit more this time. Thank you!

I used more cinnamon and a little brown sugar and butter instead of the coconut oil. My potatoes didn't seem to ever get soft, so next time I may cook a little longer. The apples were a great combination and I will be trying this recipe in the future. Thank you !

This is a nice change from my usual baked sweet potato.  We all enjoyed it.  Thanks, Erica B
