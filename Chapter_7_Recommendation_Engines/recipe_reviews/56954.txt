Unbelievably quick and easy. I didn't have time to make my own Alfredo sauce, so I used one by Bertolli (Alfredo with Aged Parmesan). Wow, it was so good! I don't think I'll bother making it myself in future. I omitted the sprimkling of Parmesan as it was already cheesy and rich enough. We had this with garlic bread. Absolutely delicious! Thanks, Angel!

I used a 16oz jar of Classico Roasted Garlic Alfredo sauce and added chopped fresh broccoli with the mushrooms.  Also, I accidentally bought cheese tortellini instead of ravioli - nice change.  You could easily added some cooked meat (chicken breast, ham, etc) if you don't want this to be a meatless dish.

So, yummy and easy.  I used Italian Brown mushrooms, Classico Sundried Tomoto Alfred (in a jar) and Mushroom tortelli.  Everyone raved! They thought it was all made from scratch. Thanks

I did everything the recipe said but I added chicken and artichoke hearts.  My boyfriend always says "it's not a meal without meat" so I went ahead and added chicken.  I will use this recipe again !! Thanks!!!

This was a great weeknight meal. I did add one chopped cooked chicken breast to the mushrooms and added an onion as well. This came together effortlessly. Thanks Angel!

I wasn't going to rate this recipe because I did make some changes.  But if I don't give it 5 stars I won't remember to make it again!  This was delicious.  I did add a can of petite diced tomatoes (drained).  And I also used Ragu light alfredo for the sauce.  It tasted great.  I didn't think my husband would like it so I was prepared to heat him up something else, but he loved it and had three helpings!

I was hesitant to make this at first, but I'm glad I did!  I did however, make 2 pots of it.  One with mushrooms and one without.  Everyone in my family loved it and was begging to eat the leftovers the next day!

Good and simple.  I prepared this recipe as directed.  I think it needs more mushrooms.  Next time I'll double the mushrooms but leave everything else the same. Thanks Angel

Very good, pretty simple recipe.  I would omit the green onions as I do not think they really fit in and added all that much.  I think fresh parsely sprinkled on top would be better.

This was super simple and super easy to make. I didnt have to do much work, I just popped open my alfredo sauce, boiled my pasta. The only thing I had to do was chop my garlic and cook it in the butter with my already sliced mushrooms. I didnt use as much alredo sauce,  prolly only 4 table spoons because I like my sauces light. I added the alfredo to the butter sautee mixture and I got a great buttery taste with the pasta, it was tasty!! Next time Ill skip the onions and red pepper flakes, they add a nice texture, but I thought the taste took away from the reall awesome sauce mixture.

Very good!  I substituted 8oz canned mushrooms, and used Progresso 4-cheese alfredo sauce. So easy and quick to prepare. I'll definately make this again.

"This is great!" quoted from my husband.  Since I doubled the recipe but only had one jar of Alfredo sauce, I made some extra of my own.  I sauted the garlic with the mushrooms, and then added a little flour for a roux.  Added a can of chicken broth to this and thickened.  Added 4 oz. of cream cheese, about a cup of parmesan, and 1/2 cup of milk, with the jar of sauce.  Let this all come to a boil, and then added a can of quartered artichoke hearts and the ravioli.  It was wonderful!

The family really liked this! Very quick and easy. I followed the recipe as written, except I used red onion instead of green and sauteed it with the mushrooms.  This is a great meal that uses things I already have on hand!

Easy, rich and delicious.  I used Classico Roasted Red Pepper Alfredo sauce and it went well with the green onion, pepper flakes and mushrooms.  It made Alfredo Ravioli a little more unique.  Will make again.

Wow... this was awesome. I followed the recipe exactly minus the green onions. As a side I cut up large slices of white onion and tomato, cooked them in a pan with a dash of olive oil, pepper, oregano, sweet basil, rosemary, and lemon juice all topped off with feta cheese. Amazing!

We LOVE this recipe. I add about 2 cups of cooked/cubed chicken breasts, double the sauce, and baby bello mushrooms. I also add in some red pepper flakes for a touch of heat. Its wonderful and we have it probably once a month!

I made this as my second dish ever (I practically just started getting more interested in learning to cook)and it was a complete hit with my normally picky boyfriend. :) Thanks a lot!

**Changes** I used beef ravioli instead es neither my boyfriend and I can't stand cheese ravioli, and parsley instead of green onions and red pepper flakes.

This as good.  We used a smaller package of cheese and spinach ravioli.  Increased the parm to 1/3 cup.  Also, added some sauted spinach.  Will make again with these changes.

Great recipe.  I used Bertolli Alfredo sauce with aged parmesan.  I did not use green onions and added more mushrooms as well as fresh spinach, italian seasoning, and white wine. This is a great recipe for the frozen ravioli and gnocchi I buy at Costco.

My whole family really loved this dish! Both my five year old and two year old had two servings of this, and my oldest asked if he could eat the leftovers for lunch tomorrow. Very easy and quick to make, and pretty inexpensive also. Even though it doesn't have any kind of meat in the recipe this is still really filling, and it doesn't feel like there is anything missing. I wasn't sure how spicy the red pepper would make this so I did leave that off so it wouldn't be too spicy for the kids, and my husband and I added just a little of it to our own individual servings. Great recipe which I'm sure we will make again and again. Thanks, Angel!

This was a really good meal. I added chicken and spinach to the recipe and left out the green onions (only b/c I didn't have any); it came out great!

The only reason I'm giving this a four and not a five is because I messed up on the alfredo sauce; I had packaged alfredo that you mix with milk but I ran out of milk half way though and then had to have my boyfriend run out and get more....it ended up being too thick for us to eat most of.  Otherwise I thought this recipe was great, love the mushrooms with the ravioli!  Next time I will make sure I have milk for the sauce, or simply buy it in a container as the recipe calls for.  Thanks!

This recipe was ok...I think I used ravioli that were a little too big.  I ended up cutting them in quarters and they didn't taste done even after bioling them for over 20 minutes!  The sauce came out good though.  Next time I will try smaller ravioli and hope it comes out better.

We rather liked this dish, but I forgot to rate it.  It was very simple and I loved the taste of the mushrooms with the alfredo sauce.  Even the kids liked this one, so I'll be doing it again.

This was so good!!  We used Bertolli mushroom alfredo sauce and portobello mushrooms.  The green onions, red pepper and garlic go so well together.  We topped it with shredded Italian four cheese blend.  Delicious!  It's definitely going into the dinner rotation.

This was excellent. I did use homemade Alfredo sauce and I also added some spicy ham to the sauce. The taste was very nice and it was easy to make.

we always make our own homemade ravioli and  I usually bake my ravioli after boiling and layer it like a lasagna , but  for my son who has Crohns   and cannot do the tomotoes.  I made this and it was amazingly good.   so easy .  We all   loved it.  I would definitely recommend .

Very quick, easy, tasty, and filling.  It benefitted significantly from a bit more vegetables, and the suggested amount of green onion is too high.  I halved the recipe but used a little more Alfredo sauce to get the right amount (1/2 of a 15 ounce jar of Classico Light Alfredo sauce).  I also added a couple of handfuls of coarsely chopped baby spinach to the mushrooms, which was delicious. I only sprinkled a tiny bit of green onion on, and that was nice but plenty; next time I might try chives or parsley. I may also add the crushed red pepper to the vegetables. My Alfredo sauce was rather salty, so I regretted using the Parmesan.  Btw, I used spinach and ricotta ravioli.

This was delicious, and even better then next day when the flavor got to soak in.
The only change I made was that I used baby portobello mushrooms.

I married my husband a year ago and as a gourmet cook I met a meat and potatoes guy! Needless to say I have gained weight and changed my cooking ways....a bit!?
I found ravioli's at the Dollar Tree and wondered what Meatballs, Alfredo and Ravioli would be like....that's when I found your recipe! Yum....happy husband and oh so easy!!  :)

Great recipe - I sautéed the white part of the green onion and don't forget salt and pepper and extra flakes to give it an extra kick!

This was great! I really loved it as it was my first foray into making ravioli and in cooking with mushrooms. However, boyfriend and good friend and I all agree that in general we like red sauce better. However, for an Alfredo recipe it was fantastic!! I made it exactly as the recipe called.

Loved this easy recipe!  I excluded the red pepper flakes and green onion because they didn't sound like they would add to the dish, but to make it a full meal, I added cooked diced chicken thigh.  Will definitely make again.

i used the alfredo sauce recipe by b. mason instead of the jarred stuff. i had cheese and garlic tortellini available and used baby portabella mushrooms because they were on sale. i also threw some pre-cooked frozen chicken strips in with the shrooms at the beginning. this was so amazing! i give it 5 stars even though i didn't do as exactly stated. it provided the basis of an amazing recipe!
