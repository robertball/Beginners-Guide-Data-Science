This gumbo is really good. I was a bit skeptical about putting the rice in uncooked, but it cooked in the 30 min and really thickened up the gumbo nicely. I pulled meat off a rotisserie chicken and added it before simmering for 2 1/2 hours, in addition to the smoked sausage. One thing I would change: I would make the roux (bacon fat/oil/flour) by itself first, stirring constantly until it was the color of dark peanut butter; then I'd add the veggies to cook them down. In following the instrux as noted, I found that the flour mixture kept sticking to the bottom of the pan and never achieved a gravy-like consistency, which apparently it should have. But the taste is outstanding, so even following the instrux to a T resulted in delicious gumbo!

This is a wonderful recipe with tons of flavor.  It is a good way to use leftover chicken too.  My husband loved it and couldn't believe I made it.

This is a very rich, bit labor intensive, very delicious gumbo. The base (or rou) makes this dish special. I have also added summer squash and zucchini to make this a yummy summer garden potash.

GREAT!!! I have always been afraid of making a dish that calls for a roux, but this was really easy. I also baked chicken, shredded it and added when I added the tomatoes and okra, to make the dish more hearty. Other than that I followed the directions exactly and everyone loved it!!

This is a wonderful recipe. I had only made gumbo a few times before, but this was by far the best. I actually omitted the chicken and added ham and shrimp. I also left the water out, just went with 2 qts of stock. Everyone that had this loved it. I had very little left over.

I really enjoyed this recipe.You can use whatever you have on hand and it comes out good everytime. I like mine a little more spicy,so I used diced tomatoes with green chilies for that extra punch. Also added corn,water chestnuts,and whole wheat flour instead of all-purpose. Love it

I had a whole chicken to use up-and I am pleased that I used it for this recipe.  This gumbo is awesome.  The beauty of this recipe is that it works-even if you don't have all of the ingredients.  I didn't have a bell pepper, fresh parsley or bay leaves.  I put it together in the morning and let it cook in the slow cooker all day.  The rice really thickens it up and makes it hearty.  The next day, the rice turns the gumbo very thick-almost like a super-yummy oatmeal consistency.

THIS....WAS....AWESOME!!!!  
I made this for my family and went exactly by the directions.  I am definately going to make this again.  About the only thing I would change is to add more lemon to the mix.  1 table spoon really wasn't enough. You could only taste a hint of lemon toward the bottom of the pot. If that's how you like it, then the instructions are fine the way they are. My suggestion would be to take a whole lemon, cut it in half, and throw it in the pot. Now that's gumbo!

was awesome! my 3 kids and husband loved it!  I followed the advice of "KC" and did the roux first then added it to the pot.  I live in the midwest but I LOVE southern cooking, and this recipe is perfect recipe for a perfect taste of the south.

This was delicious! I didn't have frozen okra but I used a can of sliced okra, I added chopped green chilies, and I used quite a bit more cayenne. I did serve with more rice (we used brown rice instead). My husband and I loved this, we will certainly have again!

I’ve been using this recipe for years with my leftover thanksgiving turkey.. I use turkey broth instead of chicken broth. One of the best things I make! Hint: use Better Than Bouillon at the end to get the flavor just right.

I made this recipe exactly as is and it was truly spectacular. It's so rare to find a recipe that doesn't require any changes, but I was happy with this one just as it is. I found that it took me about four full hours to cook, and that out of that, about an hour (maybe a bit more) required my full attention, and the rest was just cook time. It's a bit intensive, but the yield is high, and it is as tasty as the other reviews would lead you to believe.

I omitted the parsley. Added the sausage in the last 30 min of the summer,then the thawed out heated  not cooked okra to the gumbo with the rice in the last 30 min. I don't like mushy okra.
