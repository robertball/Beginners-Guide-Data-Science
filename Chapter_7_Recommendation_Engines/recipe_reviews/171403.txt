This is an amazing dish! I made it and especially loved the mix of feta with lemon! I served it over rice with some crusty bread and a greek salad. My guests raved; and the best part is that the whole thing can be made ahead of time, so I didn't have to be toiling int he kitchen while my guests were at the house.

Outstanding!  So FULL of flavor!  I served this over whole wheat rottini.  I didn't have time to bake so after I simmered the wine mixture for an hour, I added the shrimp to the skillet and cooked until pink.  Then I added the feta a simmered for 5 minutes more.  This one is a keeper!!

The sauce was outstanding!  The shrimp became overcooked.  I will make this dish again, but I will cook the shrimp, sprinkle with the feta cheese and run it under the broiler for a few moments.

OMG this recipe is out of this world!  I made it for my husband and I and it is definitely one of our new favourites.  I didn't cook it quite as long as the recipe suggests (I made it on a Tuesday after work), and pre-heated the oven to 325 (instead of 250) and only cooked it for about 20 minutes in the oven.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe pretty closely.  You have to try it!  The lemon at the end was the best!!

Oh my goodness! This is so flavorful!!! I followed the recipe exactly although I might not have cooked it quite as long for each part. This is the most delicious dish! I know some substitute chicken broth for wine, but I don't think you can do this with this recipe. The wine makes the dish. I served it over orzo with crusty bread.

Delicious!  I didn't use cherry tomatoes but otherwise followed recipe pretty much as written.  Served over pasta, with steamed broccoli and homemade rosemary bread on the side.  An easy but impressive meal!

This was quite good. I'd give it 5 stars if it didn't take so long to make. I served it over Orzo and it had a wonderful flavor.

This wasn't quite as good as I expected, but maybe it's because I half cooked it at home and that finished it off at a friend's house when I arrived. When I reheated the leftovers, I sprinkled a little dried basil over it and it really gave the dish a flavor boost.

Loved this, just loved it.  I think you could substitute less expensive meats to make a less pricey dish, probably even tofu for vegetarians, but definitely, make it with the shrimp sometime!

I loved this.  My husband seemed slightly less enthused - he would have preferred no lemon at the end.  The only thing I changed was to not bake it as long - that would have been some really over cooked shrimp.

The perfect mix of flavors. I added a can of Rotel HOT diced tomatoes, Lord have mercy! Also I sautéed the shrimp and added them just before sliding the dish under the broiler for a few minutes tops. (I cannot imagine cooking shrimp longer than a few minutes.) I served over jasmine rice.  Kudos to the submitter.

Very good!  I used1/2 - 3/4 of the wine, doubled the garlic, added a can of white beans to tomato mixture.  
Cooked the shrimp in the reduced tomato sauce & servee over orzo.  (What's with the extra step of the oven??)

OMG, this is so tasty!  The first time I made it as an appetizer and everyone just wanted more.  Now I make it as an entree and serve with lots of crusty bread.

Outstanding!!  I added an onion, salt, pepper, and oregano.  Cook time is a bit long, 20 to 30 min in the oven will do it.

Delicious! We have served it several times to company and they always ask for the recipe. It is simple, you just have to prepare a little ahead of time because cooking down the sauce initial takes one hour, but it is easy and nice that once that is complete it only requires baking and no further time.

Made this for an Alfresco dinner served with a Greek village salad and warm bread... Fantastic...
