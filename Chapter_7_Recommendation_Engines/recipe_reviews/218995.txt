This was a nice change from my usual dipping sauce for artichokes. I would use this when I have fresh basil though I still think my favorite herb to use is tarragon. Lovely change though. UPDATE: I came back today to up this from four to five stars. The flavors of this sauce only improve with a day in the refrigerator. Delicious! Thanks for sharing!

Pretty tasty but I prefer my own dipping sauce. I did add a dash or two of Tabasco sauce and it tasted much better. Served with Elegant Artichokes.

So, this is a quick aioli. I didn't have eggs, so found this.  This is a great quick fix!  My additions:  added a lot more garlic and added 2 tbsp. of white wine. I also used parsley.   It depends on taste preference.  I did five stars because it only takes a little personal preference to make it wonderful..a good cook will know how to make this their own great sauce!

I made this tonight. So yummy. I was out of lemon but had lime so I used that. Plus I didn't have fresh basil so I used dried basil. Turned out great.

Nope I only ate about 5 leaves of the artichoke and had to go make melted butter with lemon for the rest.  We like stuff that will run off, not stick so heavy to it.  I think the Worcestershire was a bit too much also, even though we love that stuff.  I'll keep looking for a butter or olive oil based sauce.

I followed the recipe as written and we were not huge fans.  It was not terrible, but I didn't like it enough to use it for my entire artichoke.  I cannot pinpoint exactly why we didn't like it; I suppose it is just one of those things that some people enjoy and others do not!

Excellent choice! As Worcester was missing I replaced it with a spoon of salted soya, also switched basil to fresh coriander, for a delicious result.

I am a creature of habit and usually grab the mayo as a default dip. But since viewing and preparing this artichoke dipping sauce, its become a staple now, and so easy to prepare. It is incredibly tasty and refreshing. Itâ€™s my new staple!

Simplest and by far the best dipping sauce for Artichokes :
Mix Mayonaise NOT Manaise, with Soy Sauce to taste. Add a small amount of water to thin as you like.

I really enjoyed this recipe. I didn't have any Worcestershire sauce so I had to do without and it still tasted great.  Also it tastes even better  when you make the mayo from scratch vs. store bought.

My wife and I really like artichokes and was looking for a dipping sauce that was a little different. This dip really hit the spot!!

It was interesting but I doubt I ever make it again. I wasn't too crazy for the flavor and it was not thick enough.

Love this dipping sauce, it's so easy.  Excellent as a summer dip for veggies.  I sometimes substitute half the mayo for plain yogurt to cut calories.

This is a nice change from the usual melted butter or thousand island dressing. I add more garlic. Yum!

Excellent blending of flavors. I used fresh ingredients and I will not change a thing about this recipe! I didn't think it was possible to love artichokes more than I did, but  the taste pops with this dipping sauce!

I really loved this, added more lemon and just a dash of the worcestershire  and dried basil on hand.  I really enjoyed it and will use this again.  I would love to try greek yogurt for lower fat.  Perfect pop of citrus lemony brightness for dippin!

This was a great combination, but watery. Do you really use the 1-1/2 T. lemon juice?

This wasn't fully rounded enough for me. Followed the instructions exactly, even used fresh basil from the garden. Just didn't have the right taste.
