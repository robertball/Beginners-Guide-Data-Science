Whenever I come home for the holidays, I usually cook dinner for my dad and I. I found this recipe and it seemed easy enough. It was amazing, it was simple to cook and very delicious. The Pineapples added a nice sweetness to the salsa which worked extremely well with the burger. Definitely going to make this again!

Not that impressed.  Tasted like a hamburger with a slice of pineapple on it.

These were okay, they were not as tasty as I had hoped they would be.  The flavor felt a little "off" somehow, although I cannot explain exactly why. I don't see myself making them again.
