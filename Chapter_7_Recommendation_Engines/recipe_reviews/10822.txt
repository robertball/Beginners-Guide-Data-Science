Hubby gives these 10 stars. He believes the Snickers bars is what puts them over the top.  As others have, I used the full can of sweetened condensed milk which worked out just fine. And for extra chocolatiness, I used a dark chocolate cake mix.  It would be easy and tempting to overbake these, as after the recommended baking time they still were a little jiggly in the pan. I resisted the temptation to bake them longer and I was glad I did--they set up perfectly as they cooled. My only criticism is that these were a little on the greasy side.  Perhaps using the full can of milk rather than the 2/3 c. called for is responsible. Otherwise, I think I'd reduce the butter to 1/2 c. rather than 3/4 c. A creative and easy twist on a boxed cake mix.

I thought I'd alter the recipe just a bit.  I made three changes.  One, I used a smaller pan....Definite mistake.  When I mixed the cake mix, milk, and butter together, I assumed a 9x13 pan was too large.  BOY was I wrong.  I can't stress this enough....USE the 9x13 pan, nothing smaller.  The second and third changes were great though, instead of using snickers, I used milky way and I added pecans.  Great!!!  My co-workers love it.

Mmmmmmm...good!  This is an easy, great recipe.  I used a lowfat devils foods cake mix and used mostly Snickers and a few Recess Peanut Butter Cups. It was a great combination.  The brownies came out chewey and delicious.  I took them to a 4th of July barbecue and brought some to work today.  Both groups loved them.  I'm going to try them with different combinations of candy bars now.  A definite keeper for me.  Thanks!  ****** I just made these again and used other reader's suggestions of using a 1/2 cup butter and almost a whole can of condensed milk, and I baked it in mini muffin cups.  Also, I didn't bake the first layer first...just baked it all at once.  The little cups turned out really cute, but the only thing was that when I took them out of the oven, they fell and had a large dip in the middle.  I ended up putting a mini scoop of ice cream in the middle of the brownie cup and swirling some caramel sauce on top.  It looked realy pretty.

All I can say is 'WOW'! Ok, maybe I can say a little more...I have been looking for this recipe for awhile now...a cookie store in our mall sold 'Snicker Bar Brownies'. They closed a few years ago and I still get cravings for theirs! I have searched the internet for a similar recipe, and I have to say that these come very, very close (theirs might have been a bit more fudgey). I did have trouble putting the second layer on top, so I ended up just dropping the batter by the spoonfuls. I was a little worried that there would not be enough batter, or that it was too thinly spread...but it rose up nicely in the oven. Perfection! Thanks for much for posting this recipe. PS My husband has eaten 1/2 a pan already and I was going to take these to school for a luncheon...I guess I will have to make another batch. Oh, I used mini-Snickers instead of the full-sized.

The second time I made these I used the entire can of the milk and sliced the candy bars instead of cutting them in chunks. I think they turned out better this way. I got great reviews!

I did not care for this recipe.  I don't understand the rave reviews.  I am a chocolate lover and a snickers lover (and a butter lover!), so I thought these would be perfect.  They were WAY WAY too oily.  I had to let them sit on papertowels before plating them, to absorb the butter, and they even soaked through that.  My counters look like an oil slick!  I also made them late at night for a function the following day.  They didn't survive.  By the next day at 6 am, they were crumbly and hard (yet still, strangely greasy).  Will definitely not make these again.  Disappointed.

I like this recipe because it is so fast and easy! I made it just like it says the first time, but it was very oily. The second time I used only 1/2 cup of butter and pretty much the whole can of milk. They were less oily and held together better. I also used yellow cake mix and most of a package of crushed heath the 2nd time. This is my hubby's new fave! Making them again tonight for our women's night!

Love these brownies and have made them numerous times!  The only reason for four stars is that I only use 1/2 cup of margarine -  otherwise no changes and if not for that I would rate them a 10!!!   The margarine I use is 53% vegetable oil.  I'm sure different margarines will produce varied results and using the entire can of sweetened condensed milk will certainly make them greasy.   I make them with Snickers or Milky Way.   Both versions are excellent.  This is my 'go to' brownie recipe.  Everyone I have ever made them for raves about these brownies!

5+ stars. This is the best brownie recipe ever!!!! And don't even taste the batter -- it will never make it to the oven. My grandkids love this recipe and unfortunately, so does their grandmother. Whoa -- don't even want to know the calories.

Awesome recipe. I have made several times and followed directions exactly (except I used MARS bars instead) and they have never ever been anything less than soft and chewy. Highly recommend Mars bars instead though. (so much better without the peanuts--if you can imagine it is possible for it to be better!)

After all the reviews about how unattractive the brownies looked, I decided to sprinkle shredded coconut on top of the batter.  I figured coconut would still go with German Chocolate cake batter.  Also, with all the previous reviews stating that they turned out greasy, I added about a half of a cup of all purpose flour to help soak it.  The brownies themselves tasted ok, not as chocolately as I would have wanted (probably due to the all purpose flour).  But I think I would have added more candy to the batter than what's recommended.

The only reason I gave these three stars is because my mom and aunt (the queens of chocolate in their own minds) LOVED them.  My mixture wasn't crumbly but I think it's because I used the whole can of condensed milk.  My husband ate one of the snicker's bars I had intended on using so I threw in some peanut butter cups and an almond joy. Very very sweet.  AVOID the urge to over bake.  This is a dessert that will be better undercooked than overcooked.  Wait until they are completely cooled to cut them, especially if the middle is still soft.  Not my favorite, but as I said - other's loved it.

These are awesome. I used entire can of condensed milk, and cooked in mini muffin tins for 10-12 min. I also didn't cook bottom layer first, batter was thick enough, almost like dough.
The brownie bites are like a cross between a cookie and a brownie, really delicious, big hit at potluck!

It worked in a smaller pan.  For the 9x13 there wasn't enough for the crust and sprinkled topping.  After using a 8x8 I had some left over, but not enough for a second batch so I ended up throwing it away.  Maybe a 9x9?  I used twix and milk choc & caramel chips.  It was ok, not the greatest thing I've tasted and a bit on the rich side.

There are way better things out there to make for your sweet tooth.

People both love and hate me when I make these... because they're so good and they can't stop eating them.  This is a good base for any additions you care to throw in.  I've used various combinations including baby ruths, rolos, peanut butter cups, pecans and mini-marshmallows (added toward the end of the baking of the first layer, they get slightly toasty and are amaaaaaazing)

Apparently, reading ingredients is an essential part of baking!  I thought I had read evaporated milk, not sweet condensed milk....I didn't have sweet condensed milk. SO, I used 2/3 cup of evaporated milk and 1/2 cup of sugar.  I also used milky way mini candies.  It turned out great!  I gave it 5 stars because despite my issue w/ reading, they turned out fab and I can't blame the recipe for my own mistake.

My sister requested brownies instead of a cake for her birthday, so i wanted to try something different than ordinary boxed brownies. I have to say, when these were finished, i was a little disappointed. they didnt look that great when i cut and plated them.  I quick grabbed the box of brownies I had on standby and got crackin.  while they were baking, i tried one of the Candy Bar Brownies-- and it was delicious! A little hard on the edges, but really gooey and chewy.  I served a platter with the 2 brownies, and these were the ones that disappeared. Everyone dug under the boxed brownies to find more Candy Bar Brownies! My mom and sister both asked for the recipe!  Definately a keeper!

This recipe was ok.  I cut the butter to 1/2 cup.  When I put top layer of batter on I patted out in my hands like hamburger patties and layed on top.  worked good.  But brownies are too gooey in the middle and bland tasting.  They are ok if you plop into bowls and eat with spoon.

I followed other reviewers' advice and used almost the whole 14 oz can of condensed milk, instead of what the recipe says. It turned out great; these are my absolute favorite brownies! Even after a couple days they're still chewy. The nougat and caramel melt together and into the brownie mix and are so delicious!

I LOVED THIS SOOO MUCH!!! So did my family...the only thing was that the batter was too thick and I had to add water to make it spreadable...also if your using butterfingers a warning that it kind of over powers the taste of them...also if u crunch some butterfingers up and sprinkle it over the top it looks pretty as a decoration...I really have no complaints and I will definately be making these again!!!

It's Awesome and delicious! The only change I've made is adding double the amount of condensed milk indicated in the recipe, turns out to be absolutely tasty!

These brownies were fabulous.  I used the entire can of condensed milk (14 oz) and an entire bag of the halloween size snickers.  I put all 3 layers in the pan at once and baked for 30 minutes.

This recipe is fantastic!! I was a little skeptical at first, seeing the ingredients but they are delish! Chewy, and so good! I had leftover Butterfinger bars from Halloween and this was a great way to use them! I am actually making another batch this week!!

I'm a brownie lover, and this is my new recipe!  It takes a little longer because of the double baking, but it's well worth it.  I'd use a little less Snickers next time, and can't wait to experiment with other candy bars!

This recipe was OK.  I kept reading comments to not overbake so I think I went to the extreme and didn't bake it 
enough.  It easily fell apart and was a bit messy but tasted pretty good.  I also used Devils food cake and I think that may have made it a bit too chocolatey.  Would be delicious though if warmed in the micro served with vanilla ice cream.

These are amazing!!  I've never had a chewier brownie - they're chewy without falling apart.  I brought them to work and got rave reviews.  SO easy to make, and i used fat free sweetened condensed milk to try to make them a tiny bit healthier, and i just used plain caramels and peanut butter cups instead of snickers.  i think any candy will work!

These were way too sweet for me, but all my friends seemed to like them a lot.  They were very very very chewy, and they did taste like the Snickers candy.  

When I baked the brownies, I forgot to bake the first layer for 10 minutes, so I ended up placing the candy in between two layers of batter.  However, my brownies weren't dry at all like some previous reviewers had mentioned, so maybe my mistake ended up being for the better.

Also, like others had written, I took the brownies out of the oven after the exact baking time had elapsed, and they looked raw--jiggly in fact.  But I let it cool to room temp, and the texture turned out chewy, not raw.

No one can believe that something this good is so easy!  If you want more chocolate taste, make the recipie with devils food cake mix.  Also, the brownies are better if the snickers are cut into chunks.

There are 15.25 oz. in cake mixes. The recipe calls for 18.25 oz. I bought two cake mixes and added 3 oz. from the second box. The batter was crumbly like it stated in the recipe. I crumbled the second half over the top. I baked exactly like the recipe said. They were perfect and delicious. Baking requires exact measurements and ingredients. I think butter is much better for baking. Thank you for sharing this recipe.

This is not a recipe that I would have tried without a little prompting.  I wanted to make something for my friend's birthday.  She is obsessed with Snicker's bars (eats them like they're granola bars), so I searched for "Snicker's," looking for some sort of recipe I could make for her.  This came up.  The ingredient list looked a little suspicious to me, but the reviews were good enough that I decided to give it a shot.  I followed other reviewers' recommendations to cut back on the butter (to 1/2 cup) and I used the entire can of sweetened condensed milk.  I also subbed a Devil's Food cake mix and used 5 Snicker's bars (mine were just 1.86 oz.) so I could get good coverage over the top of the brownies.  WOW!  Were these good.  She was so impressed!  My husband is a Butterfinger lover.  I made a pan for him and used the 10 oz. bag of Butterfinger bits.  Another hit.  The topping doesn't really crumble.  I just dropped teaspoonfuls over the top and they spread out and filled in the gaps as they finished baking.  I encourage you to try this!  So good!  Thanks, Madonna.

Cake box mixes have shrunk to only 15.25 oz, so I made adjustments based on this and other reviews.  Using chocolate devils food cake, I cut the butter to 1 stick and increased the sweetened condensed milk to 7 oz.  Baked the first layer 7 minutes and the second layer 15 minutes.  Came out great! Co-workers asking for recipe and husband not wanting me to give any more away!

Wow - I made these for a dinner at a friends house and was a little worried about taking them untested.  They were a hit!  Very rich, very sinful!  I'm sure they are off the chart with calories but a nice, rich treat - because of how rich they are, great for a potluck.  A little goes a long way!

delicious and easy!!!  i, too, used the entire 14 oz. can of sweetened condensed milk.  i used a combination of several different candy bars and it was excellent.  the top layer didn't "spread", so i spooned it out in teaspoonfuls all over the top for a "crumbled" look.  i got nothing but compliments on this recipe!

My boss told me she doesn't like brownies but when she tried one of these, she ate 3 of them.  She said it is the only brownie she has tasted that she really liked.

This wasn't too bad. You really have to make sure you don't overbake it though. It gets very dry, easily. The flavor overall was good and it was very simple to make. You could definitely change the candy bars to the flavor you like the best.

Tasted great! I have a hint,though...don't overbake the bottom layer too long,needs to be a little soft. On my second batch,I added coconut along with the snickers,made them even more luscious!

EASY recipe! Taste was great. Unique brownies. Big hit at my office and little work required. I used Devil's food cake mix. Don't overbake even though they seem not quite done. Too bad they're so fattening, or I'd give them a 5.

This recipe is wonderfully easy and delicious!  I've made it several times now--our favorite is using plain chocolate bars on one half (for the kids) and Heath bars on the other.

Cook them only as long as the recipe says.  I didn't think they looked cooked enough and ended up over-cooking them.  They were a big hit - I made one batch with Snickers and one with Heath bars.

These brownies were awesome! They were quite chewey and lasted an entire week without drying out. After a couple days they tasted best if reheated briefly in the microwave. I also used devlis food cake mix instead of German Chocolate. Great recipe!

This recipe was especially timely as my Grandchildren will be visiting this summer and I am sure this will be a great hit with all ages and appetites. We can make it together, it will travel well for picnics or just for an afternoon treat with or without ice cream. Yum Yum!!!

Spectacular! made 5 different brownie recipes for a taste test comparison (have a competition coming up) and this was the unanimous winner. My only change was using a 9x9 pan and adding oreos. The great brownie search is over! 

UPDATE: ended up winning first place in the actual competition!!!!

These are a family favorite and I make them often as gift brownies.  When they're finished baking, I cut the edges to plate them and everyone fights over 'the scraps'!!!   The ONLY change I make is to use 1/2 cup margarine rather than 3/4 cup.  I use either Snicker or Milky Way bars - either way --- they are superb!   Thanks for this great recipe!!!!

These are just ok, but nothing impressive at all. They aren't like a brownie at all and I followed the recipe exactly. I think that the issue is the German Chocolate cake mix. I'd do as others have suggested and use dark chocolate fudge cake mix or something with more flavor. I would have rather had plain pillsbury boxed brownies than these and I do love both Snickers and Brownies, so there's something off here.

This was great. I was very apprehensive about making it since many of the reviews said it was greasy. The brownies do come out of the oven greasy. However, I put the brownies in the fridge and the Butter was able to solidify. It was a great fix. They were no longer greasy!
I substituted milky way bars for snickers. 

I brought these to a party and everyone loved them. People really like the richness, sweetness, and bit of salty-ness of these brownies.

This was just OK to me.  Too sweet and VERY VERY difficult to get out of the pan.  As other reviews suggested, I used a full 14oz can of the sweetened condensed milk.  I was hoping for some bars that I could cut and set on a platter.  These were not it.  They fall apart too easily and don't look "pretty".   I took the pan to work and the brownies are all gone...however, I have yet to recieve a compliment.  I won't be making these again.  Sorry!:(

I was going to take the advice of other users to cook it for a shorter time, but I followed the recipe exactly since one user said theirs came out fine with the recipe as is.  If I make it again, I will cook it for a shorter amount of time so it's not so hard.  It was kind of difficult to spread the bottom layer down.  The crumbled 2nd layer came out a little hard, but the whole brownie tasted good after microwaving for a short time to make it soft and warm.  As other users said, it does get crumbly fast, but microwaving helps.  However, the taste was excellent and my family thought it came out pretty good- taste-wise.

These were pretty good. I liked the idea. I gave one to my mom's friend and she really liked them. I do think I overbaked them a little though and next time will make sure to do it a little less. I liked the idea and may try different candy bars.

The chewy texture is good, and I'll eat anything with Snickers in it.  But this gets crumbly really fast (within a day or two), so it's not a good make-ahead dessert.

I was a little disappointed with the recipe...it was easy to make but just didn't turn out as  delicious as I had hoped for!  It had a strong peanut butter taste so maybe next time I'll use a candy bar with no peanuts!

I like the fact that you can use just about any chocolate bar or chocolate covered confection as an ingredient for these sumptuous brownies.  I needed to use up some cookies &  cream filled truffles leftover from Easter that I chopped up into bite sized pieces and distributed them over the top of the semi- cooked brownies. I used a full can of sweetened condensed milk as suggested by a reviewer and 1 cube of butter. I didn't find these brownies too greasy at all like some of the reviewers! As with all recipes I make using a chocolate cake mix,(in my case a devils food cake mix ) to remedy the cake mix flavor I added a teaspoon or 2 of coffee liqueur ( I used Copa De Oro).I think its important not to over bake these brownies because you want them gooey and fudgy which they definitely are! I brought these to a picnic and liked by all.I I admit they aren't my all time favorite brownie just because I have a frosted browned butter brownie recipe that is just to die for that no brownies can compare. Still,
these brownies are easy to make and easily transportable for outdoor picnics, or potlucks.

I thought these were OK, as I like any kind of sweet food, but they are really for the milk-chocolate lovers, and have a rather bland chocolate taste.  Chocolate chips on top may have made them have a more interesting chocolate flavor.

The one star rating represents "Couldn't eat it" which is literally how these brownies turned out. As soon as they cool they are inedible because they are SO hard that you CANNOT bite through them. In order to eat them you have to microwave them over and over because as soon as they become room temperature again, they would sooner chip than cut or fall apart like a normal brownie.

This was okay.  Followed other reviewers suggestions and used a whole can of sweetened condensed milk and 1/2 cup of butter.  Satisfied my sweet tooth but not probably something I would make again.

Everyone loved these.  Easy recipe.  I used Snickers bars.  My only complaint is that they really stiffened after cooling but  that could have been due to the cooling of the caramel in the candy, I suppose.  We served the brownies warm with vanilla ice cream.  Thanks for the recipe!

So yummy! I followed the other reviewers suggestions and used only 1/2 cup of butter and a whole can of sweetened condensed milk. I also used Milky Way instead of Snickers. I couldn't find German chocolate cake mix, so I used dark chocolate cake mix. Maybe because of that, after I baked it for the first 10 minutes and then added the Milky Way bars, my leftover batter wasn't crumbly at all. I was able to flatten it in my hand though and lay it over the top of the candy. It came out great!
