This smells really good but was waaaay too strong.  I normally love lots of spices, but we couldn't even finish this.  If I were going to make this again, I'd take out one of the cinnamon sticks, and just have 1/2 teaspoon of cloves.  I even watered it down with some fresca (lemon-lime sugar free soda), and that didn't even help much.
