As is, I think the flavor is a little boring, maybe due to the canned soup. My changes: Added garlic and onion to veggies. Used one can each cream of mushroom and cream of chicken. Made garlic mashed potatoes for the topping. Each component needs to taste well seasoned! Tip: I did not have a piping tool so I used a ziploc bag with the end snipped off. Mashed potatoes adapt well to icing techniques, easy and fun for the kids!

I used flour tortillas as the crust and cooked them in a regular cupcake pan. Fast, fun, and delicious!

I cooked this recipe a few different ways. I added biscuit on the bottom. And it  came out good, just make sure that you cook the dough before adding the meat mixture. My family loved it. I would totally make it again.

Flavor needs to be perked up.  I chose to use puff pastry circles on top rather than mashed potatoes.  Incidentally, Shepherds Pie is made with lamb, while cottage pie is made with beef.  Either forms uses rutabakers as the veggie...called Swede in Britain!

didn't bother with the muffin papers, just sprayed large muffin tin with a little spray, added a little tomato sauce and cooked onions and red peppers to the beef and some shredded cheese.  Used canned corn for the veggie instead and topped with the mashed potatoes.  Little muffins of heaven!!

I made a couple changes for practicality.  I used a casserole dish, and I doubled the amount of garlic and vegetables.  It was wonderful!

I didn't include the worcestershire sauce, and it didn't seem to make a difference.  Everyone at the party loved it!

I didn't use the worstershire sauce or garlic because I didn't them in the home. the mini pies were still so yummy! even on the next day for lunch leftovers. I plan to make these again in the near future especially since they were a quick to fix.
