The people who had trouble with this recipe definitely didn't make it correctly.  Eight ounces of macaroni means one-half pound, not one cup.  I mixed the cheese into the milk before adding it to the macaroni.  I also used seasoned croutons in place of bread crumbs and added some bacon bits to the topping mixture.  All in all, a very good recipe.

WOW!!!  This was excellent. Try using extra sharp or sharp cheddar cheese.  I added about 4 oz of processed cheese (velveeta type) and about 1/2 cup sour cream just to make it even creamier. You won't taste the sour cream. Great without the breadcrumbs too.  Nice comfort food.  And even easier to make if you just mix everything together, then add the macaroni and mix well.  This insures every piece of pasta is covered.

This is NOT your Kraft shells and cheese or boxed macaroni. This recipe a typical southern style baked macaroni - chewy and creamy.  Family members fight over the corner pieces.  I weigh my pasta rather than measure and the recipe has turned out perfectly every time - everyone in the family loves this dish.

Great warm-weather comfort food!  It sounded like it had the potential to come out greasy because of the 3 1/2 cups of Cheddar, so I used half Cheddar and half Kraft Melts (4 cheese combo).  It turned out nice and creamy and not runny as others might have mentioned.  Keep in mind, when measuring pasta, they don't mean 8 fluid oz (or 1 cup).  They mean 1/2 pound.  I think this is what confused some people.

This was by far the best homemade mac and cheese I have made. It was even good the next day warmed up. I used skim milk, lowfat cheddar cheese, colby/jack and lowfat mozzerella. Very creamy. I did substitute crushed Ritz crackers for the bread crumbs--that's what my mom used to put on it when I was a kid--adds that buttery taste.

My husband and I really liked this! Unfortunately we didn't get to taste the topping.  I put it in the broiler for two minutes, but I didn't stand guard: when I was ready to take it out, the entire dish was on fire.  My husband blew on it until it went out, we silenced the smoke detector and opened the screen door, and scraped off the top layer.  I am probably the only person inept enough to have this outcome, but I thought I'd pass the warning along just in case.

As written, I couldn't figure out how this could possibly become thick and creamy. So, I first made a roux with butter and flour, added my milk and seasonings, stirred until nicely thickened, turned off the heat and just kept added the cheese until I was happy with the flavor. I used cheddar and pepper jack for some spice. Very yummy!

Yum - great flavor. I added about a cup of sour cream to mine because it wasn't quite creamy enough. Turned out great!

Great recipe. I was skeptical at first because it seemed way too easy, however it turned out great. I did alter the recipe a bit by mixing in a 1/2 cup of fat free sour cream at the end (before adding bread crumbs to the top).

I love homemade mac & cheese. And after reading all the recipes here, I knew this was the recipe I had been looking for. This is good old fashioned, "homestyle" macaroni & cheese like I used to eat at family reunions in Indiana.  I reduce the mustard to just 1 teaspoon and I use half extra sharp/half mild cheddar, and add 4 oz Velveta and it is perfect. 

This recipe is easily adapted to gluten free since it doesn't have any flour.  For "breadcrumbs"  I mix half grated parmasan cheese with rice crumbs.  Works great.

Delish! Total comfort food. I prepared exactly to the recipe and my four year old loved it.  Definitely not low fat, somewhat oily, but good! Keep in mind that the depth of dish you put it into will affect the end result significantly.  I put mine in a lasagna pan and it made it too dry.  Try a deep, small dish.

Had to keep adjusting the seasonings to get this just where I wanted it to be. Ran out of cheddar so I added some colby and American. Not bad, not mindblowing. Probably won't be trying this one again.

This was so good I had to force myself to stop eating it! The Worcestershire sauce and mustard powder really added great flavor. I didn't have any macaroni so I used medium-size shell pasta, which worked just fine. I had looked online to see how many cups of dry pasta = 8 ounces and it said to use 2 cups. However, after I boiled the 2 cups of dry pasta and then mixed everything together, it was really soupy, so I ended up boiling some more and added that into it. And I'm glad I did because it came out nice and moist but not runny whatsoever. So in total, I used about 2 1/2 cups of dry pasta. I also mixed about 1 tsp. of garlic powder into the topping, which I thought added nice flavor. I will definitely be making this again!

THANK YOU!!!  I have been looking for a great macaroni and cheese recipe for ever, and everything I tried came out gritty or just not right.  I tried this one because it had no flour, which I thought was the problem with the others.  This is the first one I have tried that actualy tastes good.  I used 2 cups 2% milk mild cheddar cheese, 2 slices 2% milk american cheese and non-fat milk becuase it's summer and it would be too heavy otherwise.  I didn't bake it, and my chese and milk never mixed together.  I'll try baking it next time to solve that problem.  Awsome mac and cheese!!!  ***Update: I have been making this for a few years now, and I love it with any kind of cheese.  My favorite is a mix of white cheddar, mozerella, fresh parmesean, and havarti.  I usually use about 1 1/2 times as much cheese as it calls for, which makes it extra creamy.  Thanks again!

I will give it 5 stars even though it was just ok. But that was MY fault. i was listening to everyone else saying that it was to runny so when I doubled the recipe i just added an extra 1/2 amount of sauce instead of a complete double. it would have been perfect if i did it right. I also added the cheese to the milk mixture and it looked curdle like. once baked it was fine. The taste though was excellent! and I am a Kraft Gal!! will definatly  make again and Will follow the right directions!!!!

I've made this macaroni almost every big holiday for the past 2 years and it's always a big hit.  The only thing I added is some finely chopped onions; it gives it a nice twang.

We won't be making this again.  I'm not sure if it was the Wor. Sauce or Mustard, but something didn't taste right.
I made sure I weighed my noodles and added croutons on top, which someone had noted.  I also replaced 1/4 cup of the cheese with Velvetta cheese to help make it blend, which worked out well.  The consistancy was fine.  The spices just didn't work.

Awesome recipe!! I make it so much that I pretty much eyeball it now and it's always a big hit. One thing i did do was cut back on the ground mustard just a bit and I also don't do the bread crumb topping, just top off with a bit more cheese and we're set!

This was fairly decent.  I do think there was too much mustard taste for us, it was a little overpowering.  I also replaced the regular milk with evaporated to make it a little creamier.   I liked the addition of the bread crumbs to the top.  Will definitely try this again and decrease the amount of ground mustard.

Thanks for sharing this recipe. It was fantastic.   I pretty much followed the recipe, except I added cooked bacon on the top and put in a little more cheese (maybe even a little too much). The hot pepper sauce is great, and if you like your food a little spicier then go ahead and add a little more!

Loved it! I adjusted the recipe to 24 servings for a family get-together. I substituted 1 cup of jalepeno cheese sauce(from Sam's club)for 2c. of the cheddar, left the ground mustard at the original 1 1/2tsp, & omitted the hot sauce. The jalepeno's just added flavor, but didn't make it spicy! It was perfect!!

If you want creamy mac & cheese skip this recipe.  This was a sticky mac & cheese the kind you need a knife to cut and it keeps it shape of a square when you take it out of the baking dish.  I will not make this again.

Texture was pretty bad....clumpy and gritty.  Also found the mustard flavor to be a bit strong.  This was to be the "main attraction" for dinner, so the meal was a huge let down.

I was some-what excited about dinner today since we were all in the mood to cook. Well, I took one bite of the so-called "Cafeteria Macaroni and Cheese" and totally and completely fell in love with this tasty treat. I could not stop eating it. The classic, yet delicious Macaroni and Cheese with delightfully crispy bread-crumbs, a hint of mustard, sprinkle of paprika, a drip of hot-sauce... This amazingly fantastic dish is one the whole family will enjoy forever.

I made this today and am happy to say it was exactly what I was hoping for...in reading some previous posts I realized that most people here dont realize that baked mac and cheese is very different from ordinary mac and cheese and in being raised up with southern women, I have had the priviledge of being able to get real southern mac and cheese...the only thing different I did was added 2 cups of the sharp cheddar to the milk mixture, 2 C of it in the mac and almost 2 cups on top and I added more breadcrumb mixture...I also used evaporated milk instead of reg. milk...I really liked the way it came out...if you are looking for a creamy sweet processed cheese type then this recipe is NOT for you...

I've been in search of a good baked mac 'n cheese recipe for years.  The recipes I tried were good, but the texture or taste was never quite what I was looking for.  I told my husband I wanted baked mac 'n cheese like we had in the school cafeteria back in the 70's.  I was so happy when I ran across "Cafeteria Macaroni and Cheese."  It was just what I was looking for!  YUM!

I used gluten free penne pasta for this due to gluten allergy.  I prefer the Tinkyada brand made with brown rice. Also used 2% mexcan cheese with cheddar and jack cheese as well as some 2% velveta that I had left.  This turned out very creamy and the entire pan disappeared in no time.  I didn't put the bread crumbs on (due to allergy).  But, I don't think anyone missed it. Also used a bit of cayanne pepper instead of hot sauce, as I didn't have any on hand.  We will be making this again!

This was a welcome change from the boxed mac and cheese I purchase. It has an interesting, tasty, and comforting flavor.  It wasn't as difficult to make from scratch as I had thought. My husband liked it a lot, too. I thought that 8 oz of macaroni appeared too little, so I used a pound instead and (almost) doubled the other ingredients.  When I added more cheese to the hot milk before adding to the macaroni, I found that it came out just a little creamier this second time I made it.  So, if you prefer not to buy Velveeta cheese, that may work for you.  This is a yummy dish!

LOVED this! I like mac & cheese that is chewy with crunch-like my Grandma would make, not all slimy like kraft.  Instead of the buttered bread crumbs I just crushed some Ritz crackers on top.  Will definitely make again.

Have made this numerous times now and it's always been a hit.  Have done it with a variety of cheeses from mild to old as well as added some blue at times.  Only actual change I do make is to add one beaten egg to the milk mix.

I think this macaroni and cheese is classic. Been making it for years now. It is very similar to the baked mac & cheese you might get at a good cafeteria. The texture is chewy and cheesy. The crusy edges are perfection. This is NOT a creamy, velveeta sort of mac & cheese. If that's what you want, you won't like this. I have always followed the recipe to the letter, and it is perfect - my friends love it, my family loves it. The "bite" that it gets from the dry mustard, the hot sauce and worcestershire is great - not too much, so it isn't really spicy. It's just really tasty! This is good, old-fashioned, southern, potluck ladies' mac & cheese. YUM!

Yum.  I tried this recipe one night after a mac & cheese craving.  Since then its been a household favorite.  I use less mustard and have also made with and without hot sauce because we ran out and its still good!  I always use a lot of cheddar, but subsitute 1 cup of mozzerella (just because I love mozzerella). Thanks for the receipe!

This is a great macaroni and cheese recipe.  I added about 2 tbls. of chopped shallots and about 4 oz. of velveta cheese.  The only other suggestion I would make is to double the recipe so you have leftovers - I think it is even better the next day.  In the words of one of my 17 year old male guests "This is slammin' mac and cheese."

Followed exactly;  Pretty good recipe, I would leave off the paprika in the future.  It tends to upstage the flavor of the dish and is a little overpowering.

Macaroni and Cheese is the one dish I’ve never been good at making – that is until now.  This recipe is delicious.  It made too much for a 2 quart dish so I used my Pampered Chef round baker.  Not sure if that can go in the broiler so I omitted that step.  I also decreased the butter a tad. I can’t wait to make this again but I will definitely eliminate the bread crumb topping as my family didn’t care for that part.

This mac and cheese tasted pretty good (I love the crumb topping) but I wish I would have taken the other reviewers' advice and added the cheese to the warm milk mixture before adding it to the noodles.  Instead of a creamy cheese sauce, there were clumps of cheese throughout.

I took more time heating the milk, since other cooks were stating that the dish was "clumping". I added adobo pepper, garlic and a little more spice. I also used ritz crackers on top. I love it!! The hotter the milk (not burnt) and then melt the cheese into the milk before putting on the pasta. the more smoothness you will have.

Both my husband and I absolutely loved this recipe.  We polished off the entire dish in two days (quite a feat for two people).  I will make this over and over again.

Not my favorite (a bit too greasy for my taste). I cut down on bread crumbs (I only put 1/3 of what was requested). Maybe better with more bread... Good, though, but not THE mac & cheese hit. In my opinion at least.

I loved this recipe. I just made it and it not only looks good but it taste good. I used the 3 1/2 cups of sharp cheddar, plus the 4oz of velvetta like everyone else suggested. I used one cup of milk. Next time I might use the cup and a half to see what it turns out like. I also use bread crumbs and croutons. I think I will use croutons, they seem to hold there crunch better and have a better flavor. Wonderful recipe.

This isn't a creamy dish, but it is amazingly tasty.  I used seasoned croutons instead of breadcrumbs the second time around, because the crumbs made it taste a little blah.  I like the mustard/worcestershire/hot pepper combo, which gave the dish a wonderful tangy feel. Thanks for the submission!

I was a little leary about the method for making this - I'm a tried a true "white sauce" maker for mac & cheese.  I have to say that this was just as good and  a lot easier.  Very tasty.  Definately going to make this again.

I wasn't a huge fan of the flavor the worchestershire sauce gave this dish. I added the velveta and sour cream as recomended in some of the reviews and I think that gave it a very nice texture. If I do decide to make this again I would definitely cut back on the cheese to 2.5 cups instead of 3.5 because it was just too rich.

Very good! I made it according to the recipe, and liked it well enough. The mustard is a bit strong, and it isn't as creamy as it could be. Next time, I might add the sour cream others suggested. Still, this is the first 'from scratch' mac and cheese I've made, and it came out well. Use panko breadcrumbs!

Very cheesy and delicious! I added some medium sized shrimp to it along with some sour cream and served it with roasted asparugus.

I started out making this recipe because it sounded like the mac and cheese I grew up on.  I ended up adding more milk and including about 1/2 cup of Velveta to make it creamier.  The extra sharp cheddar that I used make the sauce appear about to break.  The Velvetta smoothed it out, but made it too thick and I was afraid it would curdle.  The extra milk poured over the top at the end make it perfectly creamy.  Good basic recipe, one that's tweakable!

This was actually pretty good. Personally, I will be adding more cheese to the recipe when I make it next--probably as much as an additional 2 cups in order to make it creamy and very cheesy. Garlic flavored bread crumbs really made the topping unique and delicious!

I made this last night for my boys so I could go have dinner with Dad. I actually just prepped it for the crockpot so that I wouldn't heat up the house more than it already was. I used whole wheat pasta, fat free evaporated milk and 2% sharp cheddar cheese. I made my own bread crumbs out of whole wheat bread, too. I did undercook the pasta just a little so it could finish in the crockpot and it was only in the crockpot on HIGH for two hours. My husband and two boys inhaled it. Huge amount made, little amount left. I would say it was a hit.

I recently moved overseas and was looking for a nice taste of home. This definitely did the trick! I made the mistake of adding a bit of garlic powder to it--definitely didn't need it, and I wouldn't recommend it. Follow the recipe, and you'll be in for a treat.

I made this again for tonight's dinner with baked salman and cole slaw.  Didn't have sour cream to increase the amount of sauce so I added about 1/4 cup buttermilk.  Also used Panko bread crumbs.  Very good mac n cheese dish and we'll probably wipe it out at lunchtime tomorrow!

This was a quick way to make mac and cheese but it turned out a bit dry and not as creamy as I usually like mine.  Probably wouldnt this version again but it wasnt terrible...my boyfriend really enjoyed it.

My whole family really liked this recipe. I did not think it would turn out, because when I mixed the milk, mustard, hot sauce and W. Sauce, I thought it smelled weird and looked runny. BUT, after 30 min in the oven it turned into a nice thick creamy delicious sauce. I liked the crumbs on top too. This one is a keeper :)

I have been looking for a good mac and cheese recipe for years.  I never seem to be happy with them, until  i tired this one. It was delicious and everyone loved it and it was the first dish to be gone at our party. I used shredded cheddar a little velveeta and some shredded mozzerella and on top i ueds panko bread crumbs. Perfect, creamy and not gritty or grainy like some.

This was pretty good.  I had to stray a bit from the recipe based on what I had on hand, and will most likely continue making my mac and cheese the way I normally do (Down Home Mac and Cheese from this site), but this was perfect for those don't want to cook nights.  I had everything in the oven 10 minutes after starting to prep.  Thanks for the recipe, it was definitely worth making.

I should have listened to Renee.  This recipe tasted wierd.  I think it was the ground mustard.  As well, considering it had three cups of cheese I didn't find it to be overly cheesy.  I won't be making this one again.

I thought it was okay.  It seemed to have too much breadcrumbs on top.  Next time I might totally omit them.  I also didn't think it was as creamy as others made it out to be.

A good recipe, my 10 year old helped me make it. I followed the recipe exactly, used mild cheddar, and I liked the texture /consistancy. Next time I will try half mild and half sharp to see if it gives it any umph. Hard to find a recipe that doesn't call for processed cheese!

I made this for my family and it did not turn out at all!  It had a strange taste unlike ANY Mac and Cheese I have made in the past.  The mustard did not enhance this dish and the cheese and milk do not blend together very well.  I would try another recipe!

This recipe turned out really great!  I couldn't believe I had all the ingredients.  I did have to use some mozzerella, but it didn't seem to matter.  If you like this mac you should check out a fancier version at food network's site it's called "mac and cheese" by Giada de Laurentis (not to be confused with the spicy version she has listed too).  Thanks again for the great recipe!

My whole family loved this, even my husband, who isn't a fan of macaroni and cheese in general. I  was short on cheddar, so I substituted about 3/4 of a cup with mozarella, and the dish ended up perfectly moist. I'll add the mozarella from now on when I make it. Delicious.

This recipe is really good.  The reason why I only gave it four stars is because of my modifications.  First, instead of milk I used 1 and 1/4 cup of evaporated milk and 1/2 cup chicken stock.  Then I substituted the cheddar cheese with a mixture of cheddar, american, and soft velveeta.  Trust me, it came out great without tasting like artificial cheese - very creamy. Another reason why I really liked this recipe is because I prefer mac and cheese without the milk/flour mixture (roux) some others call for.

I LOVE the flavor of this dish (it's a very different flavor--if you're looking for a purely cheesey, velveta-ish mac, this isn't for you), but I can't quite get the texture right, otherwise I'd give it five stars.  Mine comes out kinda grainy and a bit greasy (but still good!!!).  I don't think I'm overcooking it, as suggested by previous reviewer.  I'd welcome any suggestions on what I may be doing wrong.  Maybe it's the milk I use...

If I could have given this a "0"...believe me...I would have. It was just awful! I can't imagine anyone that could possibly say that they liked this. It was absolutely tasteless. I even tried adding some extra spices and it did nothing for it. It was a waste of time and ingredients. I definitely do not reccomend this to anyone.

Oh boy, oh boy, oh boy.  This was the BEST mac & cheese I've ever had.  I've always done the bechamel bit, and this was soooo much easier, and sooo much better!  Thanks!

8 dry ounces is equilvalent to half a pound. 8 fluid ounces is a cup. When you added a pound of macroni and doubled the rest of the ingredients you essentially doubled the entire original recipe.

Am I missing something here??? Is there a mistake in the amount of macaroni? 8 oz of macaroni is equal to 1 cup by my calculations and I'm supposed to add 3 1/2 cups of cheese and 1 1/2 cups of milk! I ended up with something that resembled cheese soup! As if that wasn't bad enough, when I added the sauces, etc to the milk, the milk became curdled looking. Yuck. On a more positive note, the flavor was pretty good and I think I will try making it again with the following changes... 1) Double the macaroni 2)Cut the milk in half 3)Mix the worcestershire sauce and other ingredients into the drained macaroni before putting it in the casserole dish 4)Put crushed crackers over the top instead of breadcrumbs.

Great macaroni and cheese dish.  I have made it several times.  I increase the cheese using Velvetta by one cup, this makes it creamier.  My sister is a mac and cheese fiend and she declared this was the best mac and cheese she has ever eaten.

I made this for dinner this evening and it was really good. I've been searching for a mac and cheese recipe reminiscent of my childhood and this is the one. I will admit I tweaked a bit. I was half a cup short on cheese so added a dollop of sour cream. I used prepared ground mustard, which I like in in it, but increased it to 2 tsp. I also replaced 1/2 cup of the milk with evaporated milk. It was wonderful. Man and child loved it. Crispy cheesy on top, creamy underneath. The best I've had in years and easy!

Terrific, old-fashioned macaroni pie, all crusty and very tasty. Just like what one gets in a cafeteria, this takes me back to grade school dining hall (in a good way!). Totally different from the creamy, Kraft-dinner style, this style of macaroni and cheese stands on its own: the cheese flavor really comes through, unobstructed by the flavor or texture of thickeners used in creamy sauces such as eggs or flour. This is indeed comfort food!

This isn't very creamy, but it is cheesy which makes it a hit with my family! It's a hit with me because it's so easy. I don't have to stand there and stir a white sauce forever and for me that makes it great!!

I made it as is and it came out perfectly. The seasonings were just right - very similar to my recipe, except I always
made a roux first. Either way, it's a perfect rendition of the traditional Mac and Cheese

I made this recipe exactly as directed, but somehow it came out runny and the cheese was not mixing with the milk. Upon further reading of everyones reviews, it seems you have to make a sauce first. Making a rue from butter and flour, mixing the cheese, milk, and seasonings and cooking to thicken before adding to the macaroni. I think if I try this recipe again I am definately going to try making a sauce instead of doing it as directed. It is a flavorful dish though even if it didn't turn out right.

The fat content of the cheese makes all the difference. I used 1/2 and 1/2 and it was fine. I used all FF cheese in the next batch and it was not nearly as good. I also threw in a (lightly beaten) egg on the first batch because I was afraid of having a soupy casserole but turns out it wasn't needed. Nice flavor but be selective on the cheese you use for best results.

I tried this recipe because I thought the hot sauce and mustard would be a nice change from my recipe.  I was very disappointed.  I found the recipe tasted too buttery and in fact, too rich for me.  I may use the idea of mustard and hot sauce in my recipe.

Mixed cheese with the milk mixture as recommended.  Also added sour cream and used extra sharp cheddar cheese.  Needs more then a dash of hot sauce and more cheese would have made it better.  Otherwise this was a decent base.  Next time I use cream instead of milk.

This is the best macaroni & cheese that I have ever had.  I didn't use all of the ingredients, as I didn't have them.  I only used the macaroni, cheese, milk, butter and bread, but it turned out great.  My kids LOVED it!  This is our new mac & cheese recipe.  It was really easy to make, with little prep time, which is a must with four kids.  Thanks

I think this is a delicious mac and cheese recipe. My oldest daughter wouldn't touch it though! I did add a little sour cream per other reviewers. I didn't do the bread crumb topping it's just not my thing. Will make this again thanks for the recipe.

I don't like most of what my family serves on Christmas Eve so I decided to make something that I could eat as a full meal and this was it.  I was sure glad I did!  This was very good - I love the little bit of zip it had thanks to the Worcestershire sauce, ground mustard & hot pepper sauce.  Later, as a gift, I gave all the women in my family a cookbook assembled with my favorite recipes.  They all wanted to know if this one was in there (it wasn't since I had never made it before) and they were disappointed that it wasn't.  It will definitely be in the add-in pages that I gift this year for their cookbooks!

My family loves this! Even my brother who has never eaten mac& cheese. I use whole wheat macaroni and a combination of medium/sharp and mild cheeses. I never seem to have bread crumbs when I need them so Ritz crackers work well. This recipe is swiftly becoming one of my "old Faithful" standbys. Thanks!

I used cheddar, 50/50 cheddar, and Colby cheeses. Omitted hot sauce in favor of pinch of white pepper. Mixed with milk mixture before combining with macaroni. Used crumbled fried onion topping and crumbled one slice of oat bread on top. Fried onions provided grease to brown the top. Oily, but not bad. Tasted quite good. Will make again, perhaps without the Worcestershire sauce next time. Thanks for a good recipe. It's much better than the first one with cream cheese I tried here!

Very savory and flavorful; not bland at all.  My favorite recipe yet.  I used a cup more cheese and more tabasco to kick it up a little more but the recipe as is is still tasty.  And it's even better the second day

This is definitely the best cafeteria style mac and cheese I've made. I used a mixture of cheeses rather than just the cheddar. This mac and cheese is actually better as a leftover. Seems to pick up more flavor. I would make it the day before you plan to eat it. Very filling and tasty! ;)

Easy to make and the flavor was wonderful.  I baked it and it separated, though, so next time I may just heat on the stove.

My kids loved this recipe.  I ended up using 4 cups of cheese which was due to the fact that I read the directions wrong.  I put all 3 1/2 cups of cheese in the mixture and then had to use another half cup for the topping.  I also did not add butter to the bread crumbs as the cheese kept it moist enough.  We omitted the paprika and I did not broil as it had a nice finish when it was done baking.  Thanks

I make this all the time for parties and everyone loves it.  The only thing I have changed over time is using 1/2 shredded chedder cheese and 1/2 Velveeta cheese which most people say they prefer.

I followed the instructions closely, because I wanted to give the recipe a correct rating. The only thing I changed was melting the cheese in the warm milk, and stirring all the macaroni in it, then baking. The dish came out beautiful and looks great! But the taste just is okay, and didn't come out that the cheese blended well with the milk. (No, the milk wasn't too hot to curdle). It was a good recipe, but i've had better. The amount of Worschester sauce made the milk a little tan too.  The Alton Brown recipe in Food Network is really great, by the way!

I read many of the reviews of this recipe, both good and bad, and was curious enough to give it a try.  I would give it a 4 or 5 for flavor - loved the kick of the mustard, Worcestershire and cayenne (didn't have any hot sauce).  However, I would rate the consistency a 1.  Like other reviewers, I found the mac & cheese too gloopy and would prefer a creamy, white sauce-based mixture.  My breadcrumbs browned enough that I didn't broil the casserole, so I found the butter in the breadcrumbs too much.  The cheese is greasy enough that it could be topped with plain breadcrumbs - just enough to look pretty.

I found this recipe to be very greasy.  I would probably double the amount of pasta next time and only use half the amount of cheese.

This was my first attempt at homemade mac 'n cheese and I might just have to go back to the blue box!

It was bland and not creamy at all - more like clumps of cheese here and there, not throughout the dish. 

I think I once read that you can't use pre-shredded cheese for mac 'n cheese? Maybe that was the problem. 

Either way, I won't be making it again and I'll probably throw out the leftovers  - I'm glad I only made half the recipe!!

the seasonings were great and it was easy to make...BUT

It's too gooey cheesy, greasy and while I normally love me a lot of breadcrumb topping, it was just too much.

if I try this is again I will use part velveeta I think. Also, i did melt the cheese in with the milk first, then I poured that on the noodles and baked.

This was a big hit with my family. I doubled the amount of macaroni and used a little more of the bread crumb topping. Very tasty and it did not get oily like some mac and cheese recipes do.

really nice recipe, but we found that there was way too much cheese (and we love cheese).  i also added 150g chopped bacon and omitted the salt (because the bacon is salty in itself).  next time i'll try it with a little less cheese and let you know how it went. :)

We added peas and a can of albacore tuna for some protein.  I would definitely add more cheese next time.  The worchestshire is a great addition to the traditional mac-n-cheese.

This is easily the worst meal I've ever made.  I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out awful.  It had absolutely no flavor and lacked any 'creaminess'.  I have no idea what I did wrong, but we didn't like it, and my husband and I are NOT picky eaters.

My husband loved this recipe more than any other macaroni he's ever tasted.  He loved it better than my recipe.  I was hoping this was like MCL cafeteria macaroni...but it wasn't.  I prefer a creamier macaroni, however, my husband loved loved this recipe, I personally would give it 2-3 stars, but since hubby loved it, it got 5 stars. Also, our daughter loved it too.

Being a true cheese lover I really liked this recipe.  I generally don't care for processed cheese so this recipe was perfect.  I only gave it 4 stars because the worchestershire was a bit overpowering.  I did make a roux first and made the sauce in the pan, I did end up adding more milk however so it wouldn't be dry.  I probably didn't need the roux.  I also added 4 ounces of cream cheese to make it creamier.  I deleted the crumb topping because it isn't my thing.

I don't know where my craving for Macaroni and Cheese came from, I've never been a fan, in fact it's been at least 20 years since I've eaten it, but I decided to try it.  This is still cooking in the oven, but I can't help but sneak little bites here and there and it is incredible!!!  I think I like Macaroni and Chese now!  I did everything exactly as the recipe calls for except I used sharp cheddar cheese and just a little bit extra mustard and Worcestershire sauce!  Thank you!

Excellent recipe!  Loved the buttered breadcrumbs.  The macaroni wasn't as creamy as I thought, but it was not dry like some people indicated in their reviews.  Nice mellow flavor; good "comfort food" and a great accompaniment for dinner or even as a main meal.

I have to give this one five stars even though my three year old who will usually eat everything, and loves mararoni and cheese spit it out and cried. She didn't like the bread crumbs on top. But, I ate half of the pan of it, sooo good. It was a little dry, but I didn't measure my cheese, so that may have been the reason. Very rich. OH, and I just have to add, it heated up very nicely. Better than any other macaroni.

This was good but not perfect, therefore 4 stars. NOTE: If your cheese is stringy and clumpy you overcooked it. I am still looking for a recipe like my Grandma's..Suggestion: Ritz crakers makes a nice topping instead of the bread crumbs:)

COMFORT FOOD AT ITS BEST!  This was the best Mac and Cheese .  I am a Kraft girl all the way but my husband and I couldn't get enough. Creamy and wonderful.   I used Sharp Cheddarand followed the recipe exactly. I was a little scared since there was no thickening agent, but it turned out perfect and warmed up well the next day. The issue of the 8 ounces of macaroni is 1/2 pound not a cup (8 ounces ) of a liquid measure.

I added some velveeta cheese and it came out nice and cheesy and creamy.  Only thing I would do differently next time is use a little less bread crumbs.

All I can say is OH MY GOSH is this great comfort food!! I melted some Velveeta cheese (4 oz) and then I use crushed Saltines stirred in melted butter to sprinkle over the top. This is the mac and cheese of my childhood!! I also shake some dried minced onion in with the cheese sauce. My kids learned that the box stuff just doesn't compare!

I was so disappointed in this recipe. I was looking forward to good old Southern style mac & cheese.....that's not what I got though. I found this one to be rather dry and the addition of bread crumbs is just terrible. The bread crumbs gave this an odd texture and seriously detracted from the dish in my opinion.

I have been looking for the perfect macaroni and cheese recipe forever and I am sorry to say that this isn't it.  While this recipe had a wonderful flavor, the texture was lacking.  It was NOT creamy and was infact a little watery.  I would probably follow the other posters suggestions of addding velveta for a creamier texture.

Very good!  Although, being a college student with limited resorces, I ended omitting a few things (hot pepper sauce, bread crumbs and paprika)  Still it turned out very good!  Next time I'll have to try it the proper way...

For those people having difficulty with consistency O advise you to check your measurements. 8 oz of elbow macaroni is approximately 1 3/4-cup dry noodles.

I did add sliced pepperoni to the topping and it was fantastic!

This is the only mac n' cheese recipe I use. I do add a large spoonful of sour cream when mixing in the cheese. Makes it just a tad creamier and less dry.

This was very good! It was for Thanksgiving so I doubled the recipe. Only differences I made was to substitute Italian bread crumbs (that's what I had), and rotini for elbow macaroni (store was sold out- day before Thanksgiving). I'd definitely make this again.

I was going to give this four stars because I wished it was creamier, then i realized it may have been my fault because   I should have weighed my pasta to be exact.  I loved the fact that there was no roux to be made...no added flour butter or time!  I used shredded sharp cheddar (out of the bag)...next time I will shred my own...this makes an incredible difference.  I think whatever they put on the pre-shredded cheeses to keep them from clumping into one big mass affects the texture when you melt it.  I also made my own bread crumbs form my 35 calorie whole wheat bread and sprayed them (after I sprinkled them on top of the dish) with  "I can't believe It's Not Butter" .   Talk about easy!!  I saved calories and I didn't need to do the broiler trick because the dish was a beautiful toasty brown.  I tasted it this morning - reheated in the micro. and It really has a nice taste to it....very simple.  Sometimes more is not better...just enjoy the simplicity of this dish...and use a block of really nice sharp cheddar!  Thanks for the recipe!

I used 2 cups uncooked macaroni which is 8 oz and it was the right amount. I also added the cheese to the hot milk after I had taken it off the heat just to melt everything together. I wanted to be sure that the cheese would be evenly distributed. This is a good mac and cheese recipe and we will use it again.

The Worcestershire Sauce and hot pepper sauce really made this recipe 'pop'.  It's still good old-fashioned mac and cheese.  I'm sorry, I did not have ground mustard on hand but I'm sure that would be a good addition too.

My favorite mac and cheese recipe from this site, ESPECIALLY because it DOES NOT call for processed cheese! I will add different cheeses into the mix, depending on what I have on hand, and I'm never disappointed.

I made this recipe twice today! I hate it. The first go 'round I used reduced fat 2% cheese. That kind of cheese just doesn't melt yummy-like so I thought that was the first problem. There was no rich creamy yumminess. The bread crumbs on top remained crusty and dry. Bla! The second go 'round tonight was a little better. I cooked the noodles longer until they were almost done. I added tons and tons of full fat cheddar cheese.  I just think it is a poor recipe for mac n cheese. I'm searching the site for another one.  Sorry!

I changed in the following ways: 1 cup of milk instead of 1-1/2, 1/2 tsp of Wrcestershire instead of 1, 2-1/2 cups cheese instead of 3-1/2, 1/3 c bread crumbs instead of 1/2, and 1-1/2 Tbsp butter instead of 2. I also skipped the paprika because I don't like it. Turned out pretty good.

Easy to make and good tasting recipe! I used bow tie/farfalle pasta because there was no macaroni to be found at Trader Joe's and took other reviewers' advice of mixing the milk mixture with the cheese before mixing with the pasta.  My cheese wasn't completely melted when I mixed it with the milk, but there were still no chunks of cheese after baking. I could have done without the paprika while my boyfriend said he didn't even notice it.  The breadcrumbs are really key, imo.  I didn't mix them with the butter and still thought they tasted great.

Flavor was good, but it wasn't creamy - almost dry.  I melted the cheese in the hot milk - it melted nicely. I will make again, but not our favorite.

I made this recipe and used 3/4 cup half and half and 3/4 cup milk. I omitted the hot sauce and substituted Ritz crackers for the bread crumbs and added them to the top of the mac and cheese closer to the end of the baking time. It was really good.  I will definitely make this again.

I didn't make any changes to this... I should have! It was decent, nothing special. The cheese didn't spread evenly, and overall was bland. The only thing I really enjoyed was the crumbs and paprika after it was under the broiler. I will be making my favorite mac and cheese recipe with that on top next time!

I made this as instructed minus the hot sauce.  I also bought parmesan croutons and crushed them up vs using plain old bread crumbs.  It added a better crunch and flavor to it. As for baking, the broiling at the end is great as it gives it the top the extra crunchy texture.  Overall, I am giving it a 4 as I don't think I'm done tweaking the recipe or searching for something better.  Maybe it was the Worcestershire sauce...don't know yet, but not bad for an easy meal.

The consistency wasn't what I thought it was going to be - too stringy and not creamy enough.  I think velveeta would be helpful in this dish... it was very bland for my family's taste.  Each of us only took the spoonfull we were served and didn't go back for more.  I think I'll try a different recipe from this site next time.

This recipe was good but too greasy for me. If I make it again I will def. make it in a 9X13 dish (I used a round 2 qt dish) I will also omit some of the cheese and melt the cheese in teh milk mixture like suggested. It came out a little lumpy.I

Excellent recipe.  Even my husband who groaned when I told him what we were having for supper loved it - told me it was a keeper.  I doubled the mustard, hot sauce and worcestershire sauce to suit our tastes.  Thanks for posting this recipe.

Better the next day or after it's allowed to sit for a while. The mustard was a nice, unexpected flavoring in mac and cheese.

I was a little skeptical to try after reading a couple of the reviews but this was very good.  I can only assume they did not follow the recipe quite right.  My husband & I are on a low-carb diet so I used the new Dreamfields Pasta and whipping cream (Yum).  I also used extra sharp cheddar which gave it a real cheese flavor. I will make again.

I just don't get the rave reviews.  This was HORRIBLE.  The first time I made it, it was extremely dry and not at all cheesy.  Thinking I did something wrong, I made it again and cut down on the pasta to 6 oz. to make sure it was creamy.  It was still dry and the cheese was stringy.  Don't even bother with this recipe.

Absolutely fabulous recipe.I have been using the same mac & cheese recipe for awhile.It wasn't great just ok.So I was looking for a better recipe.I was skeptical about not adding flour to the sauce mixture,was afraid it would be too runny.But not at all,it was perfect!

Simple and delicious. Nice contrasting textures of crispy crumbs on top of smooth cheese and soft pasta.

The very, very overpowering taste of Worcestershire sauce ruined the entire dish.  I think I'll try the Down Home Mac 'n Cheese recipe the next time.

Not too good.  I really thought this would be great, but the worschestcher sauce yucked up this recipe.  My boyfriend and I had a good laugh over it.  Bottom line, don't mess with a good thing.

The worchestershire sauce in this smelled horrible and I couldn't help but smell it when I was eating it as well, but my little sister liked it!  It tasted ok, but I won't make again.

How disappointing!!!  I was looking forward to making this recipe all day.  I followed the recipe exactly how it said, only with a few more noodles, and it did not turn out well.  I don't mean it tasted bad, the flavor was ok, but I couldn't taste any cheese except for the cheese on top (also omitted the breadcrumbs), which was yummy and crunchy and good.  Unfortunately, it seems that all that milk made the cheese all disappear and it was very, very wet, like soup practically! :oP  I think I'll stick to my even simpler and much tastier recipe:  Boil however much penne pasta (or other kind that's not spaghetti) in salty water, drain, put back in pan with butter (however much you think is good), as many handfuls of cheese (whichever kind you like) that you think it needs, and freshly ground pepper, and stir away over medium/low heat until it's all melted!  It's very, very yummy and looks fantastic.  Or, if you want a crispy top, you can put it in a glass dish under the broiler for a couple minutes.  MMM, mmm!

This mac & cheese recipe is the closest I have gotten to the recipe I've been trying to duplicate for my 4 year old.  The mustard seemed to be a little too much and it wasn't as creamy as I would have liked.  My daughter is VERY picky when it comes to mac & cheese, so I'll keep searching!  Maybe a recipe that combines cheddar and another cheese like american?
