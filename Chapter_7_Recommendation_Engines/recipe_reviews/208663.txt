This was very good! I went a little light on the orange juice - maybe a scant 3/4 cup - and added a half of a frozen banana - couldn't resist!  I like smoothies to be really cold, but I don't like ice.  I didn't really taste any avocado, but it added a nice smooth creaminess to it, and the orange flavor was very refreshing.

I used plain yogurt so added a bit of vanilla.  It didn't taste like a Creamsicle to me.  It tasted like sour orange-- perhaps it needed some sweetener, which would be included in the vanilla yogurt.  I couldn't taste the avocado, which seems like a waste.  And now my stomach feels a little weird.  I won't do this again.  I would have rated this lower except that I didn't make it exactly as stated.

Simple, easy, and tastes great. This is a good shake idea that incorporates the avocado without unhealthy coconut cream and sweet condensed milk. I put all the ingredients into a plastic jug that you might use to pour drinks from and used an immersion blender - worked like a charm!

I love avocado, but with this blend of flavors, I though the avocado flavor was too strong and contrasted poorly with the orange.

I make this all the time when I'm in the mood for something light, but filling- it's delicious and very refreshing! :) The vanilla yogurt can be substituted with the same amount of plain and about a teaspoon of vanilla (pretty obvious, but just thought I'd mention it).

Flavor is fantastic using sugared yogurt, would hope for the same from the all natural stuff as well with maybe a touch of honey for some sweetener!

So refreshing! It honestly tastes just like an orange creamcicle. I can't wait to serve this to company on a hot summer day

I made this for my 3yr old son who won't try Avocados, and he drank it up!  I was worried he would be put off by the color, as it has a slight green tinge, but he liked it.  I thought it was good also, will definately make again!
