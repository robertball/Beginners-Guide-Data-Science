I used flour tortillas instead of corn tortillas, and it still turned out great. My family raved about the recipe!

This turned out ok...I used mild salsa for the kids, and lowfat cream soups and sour cream and I think it would have been too rich otherwise. Not spicy enough for me, and I didn't care for the flavor of the turkey with everything else, but my daughters' 3 teenage male friends who happened to be over ate seconds. Next time I have turkey leftovers, I'll do the Busy Night Turkey Taco soup on the site which I like much better.

This was most excellent.

I had some leftover turkey so I used this recipe. I only used 1 can of Cream of Chicken soup & omitted the salsa and sour cream in the mixture. It was excellent, and my family said it tastes like enchiladas. Topped with sour cream and it was great.

Very good and easy to make.  I scaled to serve 2 and made a few changes: added garlic powder, chili powder and cumin.  Also added a few splashes of hot sauce.  Increased the amount of chilis (used a whole 4  oz can) - good base recipe, easy to modify to your tastes.  Thanks for sharing!

This is a favorite in our house. I now make this dish regularly with either chicken or turkey meat. I now combine chopped green onion & cilantro with meat and I add a dash of cumin and chili powder to the soup/sour cream/salsa mixture. Then I layer as directed, pile on extra cheese & bake as directed. It's easy to make in advance & bake when ready...perfect for bringing dinner to a sick friend. Mmmmm.
