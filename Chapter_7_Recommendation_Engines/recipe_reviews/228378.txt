I liked it a lot. Can't say the same for my 6 year old but she is a picky eater. We used dried cherries because we couldn't find fresh ones and it seemed to work out ok. It was good recipe that I'm looking forward to trying again.

This was amazing! It was even better the next day. I didn't see the added value in the wine so I am going to be using veggie broth next time to save on calories.

I tried it just as it's written and it was delicious. I was looking for a recipe for Farro and this fit the bill.

We enjoyed this recipe, but I was nervous how all of these flavors would go together.  My dinner guests and I all agreed that getting tart and flavorful cherries is important for this recipe.

one of THE best flavor combinations I have ever put together. I put a little extra red wine in, and I had to use quinoa and rice instead of Farrow since we are a GF household and Farro is hulled wheat... but still OH MY LANTA. I just got done cooking it, my husband ugh asnt even tried it yet and I can tell you, this will be a regular thing cooked in our home. Kids probably are gonna not like the heat though.

I never make recipes with so few reviews, but I am glad I gave this one a shot!  My changes were: skipped the olive oil (unnecessary) and salt pinches.  I only had dried parsley, not fresh.  Everything else I followed exactly.  This was absolutely fantastic.  I used Alfresco jalapeno chicken sausages and chopped them up into tiny pieces.  The only thing missing is the recipe does not say how much water to use with a 1/2 cup of farro.  Fortunately, the package did (1 cup water to 1/2 cup farro).  

I found that I had to cook the mushrooms MUCH longer than 5 minutes, more like 10-12.  The flavors and textures were wonderful together.  I normally refuse to eat spinach but wanted to stay as true to the recipe as I could.  I would use the spinach next I cook this as well.  This is definitely a weekend meal as it really does take about an hour start to finish.  I was really surprised at how delicious it was!

This is another example of one of those recipes I really wanted to like and is chocked full of rich flavorful ingredients that I love, but something got lost in the translation.  The flavor of the meal itself was muddled and the textures ended up being to similar.

I had a somewhat different set of ingredients: I cooked the farro in some leftover chicken and vegetable broth; I used chipotle chicken sausage and added two chopped jalopeños; and, I used crumbled sheep's milk feta. Otherwise, I followed the recipe. Oh wow. I'll be making this again.

The estimated time to prep and cook were very accurate for me. I did follow the recipe as submitted and found the results filling and tasty. The boyfriend thought the amount of cheese should be doubled. He made comments about how delicious it was every time he could detect goat cheese.

Delicious! I used dried cherries and it worked out great. I grilled the chicken sausage and doubled the wine to allow it to simmer in the farrow and get really moist. Also added some roasted garlic. My husband loved it to.

Farro needs to be cooked for much longer, it wasn't tender at all. Other than that an OK recipe.
