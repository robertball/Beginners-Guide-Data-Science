Great beef stroganoff recipe! Very good flavor. I added an onion to mine bc I had it in the fridge and it needed to be eaten. Would highly recommend this addition.

This was okay in terms of taste.  I ended up adding a lot of seasonings to this dish to make it more exciting.  I increased the amount of parm. cheese, added garlic to the meat as I cooked it, and topped with a sprinkling of basil.  We ate this dish with garlic bread.  I can see cooking this again on a night when both my husband & I work, & I have limited time to throw something together.  It was definitely a filling meal.

My family loves this meal! I season my mushrooms and meat while I'm cooking them to keep it from being too bland, and I mix in a mozzarella cheese or Italian blend, depending on what I have on hand.
