Wonderful! I saw this recipe, and thought--when I read about the freeze-dried strawberry powder--"GENIUS!" I made them for a BBQ this weekend, but only got 14 cupcakes. I think of my pan as being a standard-sized pan, and I use a scoop for portioning the batter. In any case, I loved these. I made a second batch of chocolate cupcakes (Extreme Chocolate Cake) to bring along with these. I used an Italian meringue buttercream with fresh strawberry puree for the frosting, which was delicious on both flavors. Oh: I used 1/3 cup of the sugar to help grind the strawberries in the food processor (a trick I use when making almond meal or other nut flours), and used the remaining sugar to cream with the butter.

I've been searching for a true, made from scratch strawberry cupcake for awhile that wasn't too wet from the fresh berries, and this recipe is amazingly perfect with great strawberry flavor!  I was always curious about using Trader Joes freeze dried strawberries & this a nice application for them.  Thank you for sharing your recipe - this will be my go-to strawberry cupcake from now on!

These have been a very big hit with everyone I've given to taste test for me. The single most common statement everyone makes is "These really taste like Strawberries, REAL strawberries." And that is what I want to hear. The final test was making for DD Christine-NICU RN's birthday. I made the CC's and frosted with Real Strawberry Frosting. Then I stuffed strawberries with RSF and froze for about 30 minutes before topping the CC's. They were the hit of the evening!

Want to make 18 cupcakes with a REAL strawberry taste?  Here's your answer!  I must tell you about my first attempt to make them!  I emptied the package of freeze dried strawberries into my food processor and found to my dismay that there is a little freshness packet in there that says DO NOT EAT!  So that got dumped!  Second go at it was much more successful.  If you do use a food processor, be sure to hold your hand over the top feeder because there is a lot of strawberry dust that needs to settle.  I did make my own cake flour since Trader Joe's doesn't carry it and I was out (2 tablespoons cornstarch in a measuring cup and then fill with all purpose flour---sift several times before drawing out the 3/4 cup called for).  The cupcakes took 18 minutes to bake.  And while they were in the oven, I worked on the Real Strawberry Frosting---a total must for these cupcakes!  And my verdict is YUM!  Thanks so much for a great treat, Candice!

YUM!  You can really taste the strawberry flavor!  It's not that often that I get to play with my magic bullet.   Watching the freeze dried strawberries turn to powder was fun.  The recipe was really quick and easy to do.  The hardest part was waiting for them to cool.  Actually, they were warm when we had our first.  (Hubby made me do it).  I frosted them with "Real Strawberry Frosting" from this site which is another of Candice's prize recipes.  I made no changes to the recipe.  I got 18 cupcakes and they took 18 minutes to bake.  Thank you Candice for sharing such a YUMMY recipe!

I had such high hopes for this and it fell a little short. They were still good cupcakes and everyone ate them up but they did not have a strong strawberry flavor or even color as I hoped. The disappointing part was that they tasted like freeze dried strawberries -- there is an aftertaste with freeze dried strawberries and it just bugged me a little in these cupcakes. It wasn't pure strawberry. I made the frosting as well and felt that needed more - double - the strawberries. Alas I continue my mission for a true, clean strawberry cake taste. :(

Loved it! I just used frozen strawberries instead and added a little bit more, I chopped them and added them to batter as they were still frozen. Yum!

so moist.  so delicious.  flavorful and absolutely real strawberry flavor.  i can see myself even adding a second bag of the freeze dried strawberries to the mix to REALLY saturate the strawberry flavor.  one of the best cupcakes i have made in a long time -- and also the strawberry frosting linked to this recipe.  what a decadent treat!  would definitely recommend and will definitely make these again.

Batter was too thick to pour. 8-10 minutes for mini cupcakes is not enough time 12-14 maybe.  Mine were more like muffins. Wound up making a box mix to take to party at last minute :(

These were great! I used frozen strawberries instead of freeze dried and they were excellent. I also added a thin layer of vanilla icing on top, and it added that little something to the cake. Will make again.

I made this recipe for my 3-yr-olds birthday party and loved, loved, loved them!  I ended up using more freeze dried strawberries than listed on the ingredients list and was worried the flavor would be too strong but I think they turned out great.  (I frosted with cream cheese frosting). 

I have been dreaming about them since and am going to make my own strawberries tonight and see how that compares to the freeze dried berries.

Made these with the REAL strawberry frosting for my daughter's third birthday.  They were a HUGE hit.  Well, we also decorated them like piggies for her farm-themed party, which helped.  They were delicious.  She can't have dyes or other processed foods due to gastrointestinal issues, so these cupcakes were the perfect way to celebrate.

I made these for a baby shower (mama is having a girl, so pink strawberry cupcakes seemed perfect). Everyone ate them and liked them, but I wouldn't make them again. The batter was too thick to pour, as noted in other reviews, and the texture after baking was more like a muffin than a cupcake. The strawberry flavor was not strong at all in the cake, so I ended up making an intense strawberry frosting with more dried strawberries.

Loved how they turned out for my daughter's 4th birthday.  One note I would like to add - make sure you remove the package of moisture absorber that was packed with the Trader Joe's freeze dried strawberries. I didn't realize that there was a package of moisture absorber in there, poured the whole bag of strawberries in the food processor, pulverized it and then found the moisture absober package in my food processor. I had to throw it out and start over as i did not want to take any chances, eventhough the little package said it was not harmful.

Very good. I tried two different frostings: a chocolate strawberry and a cream cheese. I preferred the cream cheese and my husband the chocolate.

This is a great recipe!  Definitely tasted the strawberry!  I got exactly a 20 cupcakes using a scope (sorry don't remember the size).  I used the oven to dry my strawberries as described in the notes.  Instead of using the food processor grind them up, I just put them in a plastic bag and used the flat side of a meat tenderizer to pound them into dust.  I added a bit of raspberry flavoring (1 tsp) just to make sure they were very flavorful and also added pink food coloring.  I topped with a butter cream (also slightly flavored with the raspberry).  YUM! 

I'm a fairly experienced baker, but this recipe's detailed instructions made it perfect for the beginner!

My batter was very runny and came out more like banana bread texture once baked. It's tasty as a bread or loaf brunch offering... But I was going for a pink strawberry baby girl shower thing and it didn't work for that. Also I had to cook for longer than the suggested time and the bottom was still very most. Just "meh" for me.

Great flavor however even though I followed all my tried and true high altitude directions these cupcakes sank so bad I am pretty sure some of the tops were touching the bottom.  Sadly made this for the 1st time for my 6 year old's birthday.  Guess that just mean more frosting for everyone.  Will continue to tweak recipe until I can get them to come out correctly as the flavor is great.

Strawberry flavor and aroma above and beyond anything you've made in the past. Remember that strawberries have a lot of tiny seeds so you are going to feel them in your mouth. If you want strawberry flavor though, this is it. Mine rose then fell and had a dip in the middle but it might be because of the altitude here. Didn't stop anyone from eating them. :D

Great recipe! Turned out wonderful with great strawberry flavor. I got freeze dried strawberries from Dollar Tree. They can also be ordered online and shipped to your favorite Dollar Tree. Don't overpay for them from Amazon!

Thank you Candice for posting this recipe!! I have been looking for a good cupcake recipe to use with freeze dried fruit powder for a long time and this one is perfection. I get about 14-15 cupcakes from the recipe. I've made the original strawberry recipe which is superb and have also started experimenting with other freeze dried fruit powders such as pure mango, raspberry/strawberry blend, and a raspberry/plum blend that turned out surprisingly delicious. I've also tried subbing out a portion of the white sugar for white chocolate chips and it pairs very well with strawberry. Oh, I love this recipe so much. It's a definite one for the books!!

I made no changes. Two batches came out super dry and more of a muffin texture. The dry may have been due to over-blending, but the flavor just wasn't quite what I wanted either. My 5 year old didn't like them.

Awesome strawberry cake! 
The only changes I made was to bake it in a half sheet pan and then cake assembly.  I cut 3x 6" circles from the sheet pan and layered them with a cream cheese buttercream made with Italian meringue and also spread a thin layer of strawberry preserves on the bottom 2 layers. Then frosted the entire cake with the buttercream. 
Great strawberry flavor and went well with the other added components. Thank you for a flavorful and reliable scratch strawberry cake recipe!

These came out very light and fluffy, I still found myself searching for the strawberry flavor though. I think I'll be trying again with twice the freeze dried strawberry powder.

Overall, the flavor is good. I made a strawberry whip for the topping to lighten it up. I just feel like every time I include cake flour in a batter, the cake turns out more dry than I’d prefer. (baked for 15 mins). Maybe next time I’ll just use all regular flour

Fantastic strawberry flavor. I used more than the suggested amount of strawberries and this cupcakes are fluffy and very must strawberry flavored - you can really smell it too!

I didn't have strawberry powder, but I used about 6 regular sized strawberries and mashed them up, drained the juice and used that instead. I also added 4 drops of red food colouring. Recipe turned out great!

I made a half batch in an effort to "test" the recipe before a birthday party and I wasn't crazy about the flavor or the color. I was hoping for pink, but it just looked like brownish beige. The flavor seemed to be weak in the strawberry department.
