This is a very good way to get in a healthy side dish!  It went perfectly with an omelet that we had for lunch today.  I scaled down the recipe (had to use my food scale to make sure I was getting it right), but I did double the dressing for it.  I LOVE that dressing!  I would suggest making sure that the strawberries and snap peas are dry when you add the dressing.  Mine got a little runny after it sat on the berries and peas because I was impatient!  Thank you very much for the recipe!  EDIT:  Make only enough as you will need for your meal because the leftovers aren't nearly as good, in my opinion!

I served this on Christmas day with a standing rib roast and garlic mashed potatoes. Very tasty sweet, tangy and healthy alternative.

This is a nice alternative to regular salad but must be kept chilled and served immediately after chilling. It will turn sour if it is allowed to get warm.
