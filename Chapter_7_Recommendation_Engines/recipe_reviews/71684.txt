I loved this side dish. However, I made my own cornbread because I prefer a less sweet taste. Also, you could add cooked instant rice to make it more filling. This is a good recipe to use when your main dish is something southern. Really good with fried chicken or pork chips.

I really love this recipe as a side dish to fried pork chops or fried chicken.  My family must have meat, but I could eat this as main dish by itself.  I used the Bush's Blackeyed Peas with bacon as they have a lot of flavor and taste better than the peas without the bacon. Neither kind of Bush's Blackeyed Peas tasted like "dirt" as another reviewed said.

Another reviewer gave a one star rating simply because of the sodium in the recipe.  The reviewer didn't even say they made the recipe or tasted it.  FYI... Sodium is not inherently bad, it is bad for those with high blood pressure.  Consuming sodium does not cause high blood pressure. 

The bottom line is this recipe tastes good, is easy to make, and looks good on a plate when served like the photo.

I've made something similar to this before, using my own buttermilk cornbread recipe.  It is delicious.  And for the "critic" who says this recipe isn't authentic Hoppin' John, I say:  nobody claimed that it is.  Even the name cleary states "cornbread hoppin' john."  It is a variation of a traditional recipe, and no more misnomered than vegetable burgers.

This is very good.  I like to add rice and sausage for a good hearty change!

My family loved this dish. I made my own cornbread (we don't like the sweetness of the boxed kind) and I also mixed the salsa and sour cream with the black eyed peas and then poured it over the cut up cornbread.

We all enjoyed this for a quick lunch or simple dinner. It was surprisingly good "comfort food"... but, I guess you have to enjoy black-eyes before you're gonna like this dish. I've also made it with breakfast sausage instead of the bacon and it's equally as good and maybe a little "meatier" tasting for heartier eaters.

This is wonderful! The perfect meal ever! I usually skip the peppers, though.
