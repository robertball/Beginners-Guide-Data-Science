Surprisingly good, and very easy!  I had about 2/3 of a cucumber and Madeira wine in my kitchen, so I substituted those for the zucchini and red wine.  Madeira has a nice, sweet flavor that I like to use in pasta sauces, and it complemented the sweentess of the corn very well.  My 2 1/2 year old daughter liked it too, but she loves pasta, so that's a given!

I made it with 2 cans of diced tomatoes (with garlic and italian seasoning, I think), and it was great!

Very good. Left out the mushrooms because we don't care for them.I bet it would be even better with sliced chicken in it.

I made this as directed, except I cut the zucchini by about half (I think the zucchinis I had must have been HUGE). We just weren't crazy about it. To quote my husband: "How is it that this soup has so much good stuff in it and no flavor?" It was edible and satisfying, but it didn't make anyone want to go back for seconds, and I took it out of my recipe box afterward.

I did this following the recipe, it was tasty but not exactly amazing.  Good side to it was that it is easy to prepare.

This recipe is quick and tasty. I added in a can of diced tomatoes, more zucchini and only used half the corn called for. It turned out great.

Good!  Great way to use up zucchini from the garden.  I used Madeira wine as another reveiwer suggested and it was very good.  Easy and quick!  Thanks.

I thought this was ok.  My husband really disliked it.  Came out very watery.  Might have to cook the mushrooms longer to evaporate all the water they emit.  Just not for us, so I will not be making again.

Awesome.
I switched the red wine for chicken broth because I had everything else in the house already and didnt want to go out to get wine. 
I left the zucchini quite large though, and diced the mushrooms. All in all. quite delicious.

This was OK, but not quite as good as it sounded. I used whole-wheat rotini, because I thought the chunky veggies would mix better with a thicker pasta. I eat tons of veg, but I didn’t think they went well with the heavier flavors of the red wine and marinara (I used homemade, “imported” from our favorite Jersey deli). I think this would be better as a primavera, with the veggies, olive oil, lots of garlic, fresh herbs, and Parm/reggiano cheese. I also didn’t really care for the corn in this Corny Spaghetti; it reminded me of Hamburger Helper casseroles I had as a kid. Thanks, anyway.

Thanks for the wonderful recipe! This dish was very tasty and extremely quick to prepare. The only changes I made were based on a difference of what I had on hand. I used wheat spaghetti instead of angel hair and I used alcohol-free red wine. The whole family loved the taste and it was a great way to get those veggies in as well. Paired with a nice salad and a slice of Italian bread and you have a perfect meal.

Only giving it three stars because as the way the recipe is written wasn't our favorite.  But I could tell this recipe was onto something.  Eating spaghetti without any meat just tasted so strange so we did add hamburger and the cooked vegetables; mushrooms, zucchini and we used shoepeg corn just because it's a personal favorite.  We skipped out on the red wine again just because of a personal preference and the end result has turned into one of my favorite meals especially in the summer when zucchini is fresh and abundant.

I used this recipe as a base and made changes with what I had on hand... tasted great.
I used chopped frozen veggies (zuchinni, bell pepper, onion) and frozen corn.  Did not use wine or mushroooms.  I added a bit of cumin and garlic powder along with a can of black beans.  
Will make again.
