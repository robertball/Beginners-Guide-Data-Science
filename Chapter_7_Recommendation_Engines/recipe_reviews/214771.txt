It was pretty good. Next time I will skip the Beef Consomme (too much sodium) and use a couple Tablespoons of steak sauce instead.

This is the first bloody mary I actually liked!  This blows away the store-made mixes which pale in comparison.  This  mix has just the right amount of heat to it -- not too much heat in the front on the tongue, but enough heat at the back to give it some heat and a kick.  The flavor, overall, is very balanced.  

We used Campbell's low-sodium tomato juice.  I made this and let the mix meld in the fridge for about two hours before I mixed it with a shot and a half of vodka.  I'm very impressed with this and will certainly make this again.

Thanks for posting the recipe!

Very good with a little kick.  Warms your belly on a cold wintery night.  Will make again and again I'm sure.  My husband likes to add this mixture to his beer.

This is an excellent recipe.  I have used it for several holidays and gotten rave reviews from my guests.  Go easy on the hot sauce and let them add their own fire.  Some serving suggestions: cook some medium shrimp and chill then on a long toothpick (I use cut in half bamboo skewers) add shrimp, cocktail onion and pimento olive or some other green olive (no black olives) and stick in cocktail glass then add vodka and BM mix...be prepared to be amazed.

I have used Demitris for a long time but it is expensive, I found this to be an excellent replacement and for the sodium conscious, substitute a low sodium beef broth from bouillon. I use Better Than Bouillon low sodium and it works great. The beef flavor is important for over all taste in my opinion.

Excellent spice. Exactly what I was hoping for. I did use low-sodium vegetable juice instead of just tomato. And I omitted the beef consomme (vegetarian version).

Wow! Loved it :). Took a week off from work while kids were still in school (before their summer break) and had this for breakfast out back by the pool. Ahhh..it was a good week home :)

I recommend both, this drink mix AND taking a week off from work while the kids aren't around :) 

Cheers!

Made this for easter breakfast. Like the distinct taste of the consomme. Not too hot or spicy at all. Followed ingredients exactly.

This recipe is pretty much like any other, with the exception of beef consume.  technically that makes it a bloody bull.  I find that infusing vodka with fresh peppers makes for a much more interesting and fresh bloody Mary.

I was in the bar business for 15 years and have made hundreds of Bloody Mary's. I had never heard of beef consommé'being used before, so I was intrigued by this recipe. It is fantastic! The perfect amount of spices and flavor. I did add a Tbs. of horseradish. Easy to make. Easier to drink!

I spent the evening trying some other single serving recipies on this site. They were OK. I used the remainder of my big jug of tomato juice to make this stuff, and it was the bomb! The beef consume sets this apart from the pack. The only thing I changed was I used a half a tbsp of celery salt and a half tbsp of Old Bay Seasoning instead of all celery salt. I'm a huge Crystal Hot Sauce fan, so I used that instead of the Tobasco. You will not be disappointed.

I didn't have consummate so I dissolved a beef bullion cube. Other than that, didn't change a thing. Loved it!

This is a great version of the classic Bloody Mary. Horseradish was never used . I didn't have a lemon so I  used a lime.

Beef consume was a bit much. I’ll just put a splash in there next time.

This mix turned out great. Much better than any store bought I've tried. I followed the recipe exact, but for two things. I used the whole 10 oz can of beef consumme and I added about 1/2 tbsp of ground horseradish. It was perfect to my taste and I will definitely use this recipe in the future.

2.11.18  NOTE:  This review disappeared from the site, so I'm reposting.••••••••1.24.12  No need to ever buy another bottle of bloody mary mix, as this is every bit as good and takes just minutes to get into the fridge.  The steak sauce is a nice addition and gives it some tang.  Next time I think I'll add more Tabasco® and horseradish because we like it spicy.  You have options on this.  You can keep it as is for a Virgin Mary (would be fun for the kiddos), or add a shot of vodka for the real thing.  Either way, you won't be disappointed.

A bartender friend of mine used this recipe when he would make pitchers of Bloody Mary's for us.  For those that wanted it he would add a little horseradish,  Yum.

Didn't try recipe but you can buy sodium free beef bouillon powder in most grocery stores so I would use that instead of canned beef bouillon.
