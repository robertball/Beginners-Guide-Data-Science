I wanted to wait until a really hot day to make this.  It was so refreshing and the taste was amazing.  I didn't like the chunks of cantaloupe in the drink so I might strain the drink next time and drink just the juice.

It was GREAT.......... It mostly depends on the kind of cantaloupe you have... Sweet or ripe>>> I tried 1 cup of water and 1 cup of ice....... But the ice did not really crush! But it was great! :)
