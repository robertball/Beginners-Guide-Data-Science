VERY DISAPPOINTED IN THIS RECIPE.  FIRST OF ALL DOES NOT LIST ALL INGRED.  THEN WHEN YOU GET DONE TO MERINGUE IT SAYS YOU NEED CREAM OF TARTAR.  ALSO THE EGG YOLK MIXTURE DOES NOT GET THICK, I HAD TO MORE FLOUR. ALSO THE MERINGUE DID NOT HOLD ITS PEAK.  AND I KNOW HOW TO COOK AND BAKE.  SO NO WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS RECIPE.  COST ME $8.00 TO MAKE AND IT DIDN'T TURN OUT.
