Made it as written but had to add cayenne as I didn’t have a jalepeno. Delicious. We both had seconds!

Delicious!!   Instead of the frozen veggies I used celery, onion. Peppers and pinto beans.  I added cooked spinach when it was ready to serve.  Great recipe.

I might make some changes next time,depending on what I have on hand. I’m thinking about casseroles now,so I’m going to try different ingredients.
