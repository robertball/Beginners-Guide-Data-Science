I was SO excited to try a new dressing recipe and chose this one.  We were all very disappointed.  None of us LOVE bacon and the bacon flavor is overwhelming.  If you LOVE bacon, go for it!

Haven't made this recipe but it sounds a lot like the one I make.  Instead of the cream of chicken soup - I use cream of mushroom soup.  Instead of the bread cubes I buy a packaged unseasoned stuffing mix and use the seasoning packet sparingly (I believe the spices are similar to yours).  Also,for the meat portion I use Hawaiian Portuguese Sausage and add golden raisins.  Instead of the applesauce I dice Fuji apples.  A retired firefighter gave me this recipe a long time ago - I have never made any other stuffing and am always asked to make more!

I am not a stuffing fan, but when I found this recipe I thought it was  worth a shot.  I, along with my entire family LOVE this stuffing.  It is so full of flavor.  It could be a meal in itself.  My kids even like this. HINT: I used a 14 oz bag of dry bread cubes, once with plain and once with seasoned and BOTH were great.

We found this stuffing to be wonderful, not overwhelming bacon favored at all as stated before.  My only suggestion is use low-fat meats and trim the fat from the bacon to ensure that is not greasy.  I used this to make stuffed porkchops and we really loved the flavor it added to the pork chops.

This was the first time I have used this recipe and it was a HUGE hit. Not one ounce was left over (Ill make more next time!). Next time I am going to add one more (Granny Smith) apple as I loved the texture and the sour kick it added to the sweetness of the meats!

This was an excellent stuffing recipe.  I feel quilty only giving 4 stars, but I'm just not a huge stuffing fan.  I chose this because my family loves mushrooms.  For stuffing, it couldn't be any better.  I used straight sausage, about 3/4 pounds because that's what I had leftover from another recipe.  I skipped the apples and applesauce all together, I don't like fruits with veggies in a recipe.  I didn't quite dump in the entire pound of dry bread, cause I was afraid of dry stuffing.  It turned out great.  I will use this recipe again!

We served this for a special dinner, and it was a big hit!  Everyone commented on the great flavor!  I made it pretty much exactly as specified (but I don't really measure) and we really enjoyed it.  We'll be making this again!

I put this stuffing in cupcake tins and they came out wonderful. I tried it at Thanksgiving and I forgot to add the apple sauce and it came it just fine. It was a big hit!

Excellent we love it.  Prep time took a bit - defiantely more than listed and I was not sure if I should have the bacon precooked before adding or not.  I used sage sausage and sage onion stuffing cubes so didn't add he sage.  I also added a few handfuls of fresh baby spinach after the apples and water chesnuts.  I doubled the recipe and used one can cream of chicken and mushroom and one can of cream of mushroom soup.

My husband and I have been trying out stuffing recipes for Thanksgiving.  We tried this one and although we like it, it just has too much meat it in.  The meat flavor takes over and you don't taste the traditional stuffing flavor.

This is the third year making this stuffing. I thought I had lost the recipe. This made me a turkey stuffing pro when I made this. It was a major hit. Great mixture of flavor. It will all be gone before the end of the day.

OMG YUM! Hands down the best stuffing I've ever had and I grew up with a mom that was a great cook. I could have that as a meal in itself.
Things I did to make it more traditional.
Substitute water chestnuts for roasted chestnuts and filberts. I ground up 3 cups. Browned first two cups in butter, then threw in meat. 
2 onions, 4 large stalks celery, pound of mushrooms diced. Full cup turkey stock, condensed cream of mushroom with roasted garlic. Used lean meats so no need to drain. When tossing in bread crumbs I toss in the 3 cup of ground nuts.
Everything else the same.
FYI you'll need a very large skillet and a lasagna pan to roast the stuffing.

I've been making this recipe for years and I absolutely LOVE it... I look forward to Thanksgiving every year mainly for this stuffing! I make a few minor changes... I double up the sausage and remove the ground beef, and instead of medium sausage I use half mild and half hot, which gives it a nice kick.... Also I remove the mushrooms but that's only because I don't like mushrooms.  I buy some nice fresh french bread about 4 days in advance, cut it up and let it dry naturally over 4 days.

It was absolutely excellent. I loved it, my partner (who hates meat) was a fan, and the kiddo lost his mind. Would absolutely add extra nutmeg next time, but that's about it. #MyAllrecipes #AllrecipesAllstars #AllrecipesFaceless

I personally am not a huge fan of stuffing, but this one is a huge hit with my family. They all love it! The only change we make to it is gluten free bread sticks cut up into cubes, and to make sure all other ingredients are gluten free as well. My daughter has asked that we make this again for Christmas!

I’ve made this many times. I omit the ground beef (don’t care for it in stuffing), salt (plenty of salt in the other ingredients) and sage. I bump up the sausage to a full pound and buy it in Sage flavor. I also add an extra apple or two because I love them
