Great combination of sweet and salty! And, I guess this is another one of those "don't knock it 'til you try it" recipes. I used two bagels with one egg, two slices of ham, and a slice of cheese to make two sandwiches. I opted for reduced-fat cheddar and next time I might sub bacon for the ham. Overall, very tasty!

Haven't tried this particular recipie only for the fact I already make the same, however "everything" & "cinnamon raisin" are my favorite bagels to use, & I use Canadian bacon instead of ham. I like the taste better (also if I have any bacon grease available I'll use that instead of butter when I put my CB on the skillet). I know when I make it it's delicious so I know this recipie has to be as well :)

I make this type of sandwich all the time! I never though of adding maple syrup.  Its a great addition and now I don't think I can have a bagel sandwich with out  it now.  Sometimes I like to add some green onions.

Yummy! I only used 1 slice of both ham and cheese and only 1 egg, and that was perfect for me. The combo of flavors is really tasty. I would def makie this again! Thanks for sharing. :)

This tastes great with soft scrambled eggs too!  Perfect start to a chilly morning. Warning though, you might want to follow this by a 2 hour nap!! :)

So Good! Imade it with Thomas Maple Bagels, so I didn't bother with the maple syrup. Also added a touch of sharp cheddar on top of the american slice. Super hardy breakfast for those days when you need to plow the back 40!

I know people get upset when people point out calories/fats, etc. and yell, "There are diet sites," and I generally agree. However, this recipe is so over the top that it could be served in a fast-food restaurant. When I read the ingredient list, I thought, "Where's the second bagel?" I made it with two bagels, with two slices of ham, one egg, and one slice of cheese per bagel. It was excellent although I didn't find the maple syrup necessary, but that's just a matter of preference; I would serve the syrup of the side in a heated pitcher. The two stars are for "as written" which I couldn't in conscience serve to anyone (look at the nutrition information), and 4.5 stars for the slimmed down (but hardly "diet food") version.

It was yummy for sure!!  Although  unless you are really hungry, I suggest you half these ingredients, the ham, cheese, and eggs.   You also don't need  a whole tbsp & 1/2 for frying the eggs.  I will absolutely be making these again tho!

This was a great recipe ! I made it for a nice fall Sunday lunch, and it was perfect! The taste of the maple really completed it! Although I only made one egg, it was great. I recommend this for a nice lunch/brunch!

So good! Just made it this morning for my husband and me. My husband isn’t big on breakfast, but he gobbled it up right away! We didn’t have ham, so I substituted bacon, and it came out great! Will be trying this again with all types of different meats!

This bagel was great!  The only thing I would do next time is cut the bagel in half and DIP it in the maple syrup.  I think it would me less messier :)

This recipe popped up in my inbox this morning so I made it for my breakfast. I didn't have any bagels so I just used bread. What a fantastic idea! It was like a French toast/ham & cheese with egg. So good. Thanks for the recipe!!!

I tried this and really liked it.  Normally I use the toaster oven, and I like the skillet better.
