these were very good.
when doubled, they fit perfectly into a 13 X 9 pan.
however, a full teaspoon of salt was too much, even for the doubled recipe, so i'll just stick to the 1/2t.
i frosted these with a caramel coconut frosting.

I must admit that upon making the batter for this brownie, I was skeptical about the outcome. The batter reminded me of chocolate chip cookie dough without the chips. I put the batter into my prepared pan and thought, owe well it was sooooo simple, if it tastes like "junk", I didn't have to feel bad because it took only minutes to make. To my surprise they tasted great. (As if I made them with Maple Syrup) I plan on serving them today (July 4th) warm with some Haagen Daz Strawberry Ice Cream.  I also threw a few extra walnuts on top before baking. It made it look nice. Great recipe, simple, easy and I'm sure kids would love to prepare it.

GREAT!  The Perfect thing about this Recipe is that you can put anything in it.  I'm now going to use this for a Base whenever I make Blondies.

I did Double the recipe and put it in a 9x13 pan. (for those who have trouble spreading the batter in the pan, you can smooth it out with Wet Hands.)

Thanks!

PERFECT, MOIST! This is the recipe I have been looking for after many many dissapointing recipes. I added just a pinch of cinnamon to the batter and baked in an 8x8 for 27 minutes. WOOOO HOOOO look out Applebees! I served it warm with vanilla ice cream and maple butter sauce. MMMMmmmmmmmmmmmm

Very good - I doubled the recipe (other than the salt - that I kept as 1/2 tsp, and I didn't use the walnuts), and baked these in a 9x13 pan for 25 minutes. I also added 1/2 cup of butterscotch chips, but would be tempted to add more next time. They turned out very nicely - soft, sweet, and just oh so good! I like the fact that you could add almost any bits you wanted - nuts, chocolate chips, butterscotch chips, peanut butter chips, whatever. I think you could also frost these if you wanted, or go without. It's a very good, very versatile recipe that I will definitely be keeping around to use again and again!

I made a few of the blondie recipes on here and they all turned out terrible. This one came out fantastic! I read some reviews on how sticky and thick the batter was so I melted the butter completely and that helped make it easier to spread in an 8 x 8. I cooked it for 27 min. like another reviewer said and they came out perfectly chewy and moist! I did take out the nuts and instead sprinkled a couple handfuls of semi sweet chocolate chips on top. This recipe is definitely going to be a keeper!

I don't know what happened???  The batter was thick and I spread evenly on pan and baked according to directions.  Turned out really hard and unedible.  Seems like liquid is missing from recipe.

These are delicious !  I wanted to make a 9 x 13 pan so I upped the ingredients as follows:  2 cups sifted flower, 1 1/2 tsp baking powder, 1 cup brown sugar and 1/2 cup white sugar, 1 1/2 cups softened butter, 2 eggs, 1 tsp vanilla and left out the walnuts.  I chopped up a white chocolate candy bar and put the pieces on top of the batter.  It took about 35 minutes in the 9 x 13 pan.  Love this recipe and will use it again !

Yummy tasting, but very difficult to spread in a 9x9 pan, even after adding the chocolate chips.  There would be no way to get it in a 9x13 pan, so I suggest using 8x8, if not smaller.

Fabulous!! I got so many compliments on this. I took it to a friends who had just had a baby not knowing her all time favorite dessert was applebees blondies. She said these tasted just like them. I followed the recipe exactly. For the sauce I melted one block of cream cheese, added about 3/4 cup of real maple syrup. Then in a separate bowl made your basic powered sugar/milk icing to the consistency I wanted. Mixed icing to cream cheese mix. Served blondies and sauce hot, sprinkled with walnuts.

The BEST BROWNIE bar none! It's soft and chocolaty and delicious!   If I could give this more stars I would!  I took it to a party in an 8x8 pan and by the end of the night people were scrapping the bottom of the pan for crumbs.  It was so easy to make, this is the only brownie recipe I will ever use.

Really good. The first time I made them, I ran out of brown sugar, so I used 3/4 brown to 1/4 white sugar. They turned out amazing, so I continue to use this ratio! Oh, and I used margarine with no problems whatsoever. As the man-candy says, "these taste like chocolate chip cookies without the chocolate!"

I just read the recipe, wrote it down and immediately went and made them.  They were very easy to make!! Made some plain, some with nuts, and some with butterscotch chips.  I doubled the recipe but not the salt. Will Make these again, you always have the ingredients on hand and can make them in minutes!!

I doubled the recipe and used 1 cup brown sugar and 1 cup white sugar and baked in a 9x13 for about 25 minutes. I did add chocolate chips to the top of the batter prior to baking. They were excellent! Very eay and all the ingredients on hand.

I decreased the brown sugar by 1/4 cup and it was still very sweet but also very good. Spread in 8 by 8 and bake for only 20-25 minutes.

I've been looking for a simple blondie recipe and this is it!  I revised as follows: I pretty much multiplied the recipe by 1.5 and used a 13x9 pan, kept the salt at 1/2 tsp, replaced 3/4 c of brown sugar with butterscotch pudding mix, replaced 1/4c of butter with 3/4c apple sauce and only used 1 egg.  Fantastic flavor and texture.  This is difficult to spread, agreed.  I think this would also make fantastic biscotti, which I will try next.

Mine came out perfectly, absolutely delicious! Ovens vary & I only had to bake for 20 minutes. Followed recipe exactly, with the exception of adding extra vanilla (but that is just a personal preference). Yes the batter was thick, but as long as the end result is good I don't see why that would matter? If you find it difficult to spread in the pan, simply spray 1 hand with cooking spray, rub hands together, then press evenly into pan- ez pz! Just like the recipe- so easy & so yummy!

I'm making my 2nd pan in three days as I write this...this recipe is unbelievably, sinfully delish!  I do melt the butter to help dissolve the br sugar and I do add choc chips; note that by doing so, they will melt into your batter unless you let the mixture cool for 10 min or so before adding (but was delish with the choc swirled through-out!). Baked mine in an 8x8 at 350 for 25 min.

I doubled the recipe, omitting salt altogether. Iam trying to use only what I had in my pantry, so it was 1/2 part whole wheat flour, 1/2 part white flour,  I used powdered eggs and water as appropriate for reconstituting, doubled the vanilla extract and baked in an 11x7 " pan. I used the 1/2 cup of walnuts I had on hand. I drizzled with a little bit of leftover homemade chocolate frosting, and these were quite the hit. Yummy and quick to make too.

Wow! These were really good! I thought they may be to sweet... nope! They were perfect. I left out the walnuts and sprinkled chocolate chips on top, and it was delicious! Kind of like a chocolate chip cookie, except the texture was different and it tasted more of... vanilla? I agree with all of the other 5 star reviews. They were so good! Nothing went wrong at all, and they were very easy to make! The batter was more like cookie dough then batter, but it turned out great in the end. I made them last night and they are almost gone! I think these are more like blondies then brownies, which is what we call them. This recipe is a keeper!

I made these for my Spanish Class (just for fun) and they were a hit! I made them at 5:30 am and they were still slightly warm when served. I added some mini semi-sweet chocolate chips to the top. I also doubled the recipe. The batter is quite thick and nothing like you might expect for a brownie recipe so don't be discouraged! These were great!!

Fair taste, terrible consistency. Brownies felt more like cookies; hard. Followed instructions, read previous reviews. Dont make these go for the "blonde brownies" recipe from this site instead.

i doubled the recipe for a 13x9 inch pan. Left out all salt and walnuts, but added a standard size bag of nestle tollhouse semi sweet choc chips. I must say, it was delightful. VERY easy to make. I would definitely suggest overbeating the butter and brown sugar to make sure the flavors meld. I also kept it in for exactly 30 mins. Definitely glad i didnt go a second over that time because the edges were already a teeny tiny bit dry. Overall - winnnnerrrr, for ease and deliciousness. Tastes like maple syrup morsels!

Great recipe.  I put chocolate chips in mine and (to me) it tasted exactly like chocolate chip cookie bars.  It wasn't like a brownie but good all the same.

Very good brownie recipe. I added the suggested 1/2 cup semi sweet chocolate chips and yes it was a very thick batter but it made it thick enough that I could press it into my pan with my hands. I used a 8 X 12 pyrex dish and used a single batter didnt double like a lot of people did and it came out fine however I wouldnt want to go much bigger than that. Keeping this recipe pretty yummy.

This was really good. I had to use an 8x13 pan so mine turned out more like a giant cookie than a cake/brownie. The dough was really think almost like cookie dough and I had to work to spread it out thinly in the pan, but the end reuslts are fantastic!!! I left out the nuts and used a half cup of semi sweet choc chips instead. Definitely a keeper, Thank You for sharing htis Rosina!

These are good.  I overbaked mine, because when I went to take them out (the edges were browning), the middle seemed jiggly and wet still, so I left it in.  I waited until the middle wasn't jiggly anymore, and I guess I waited too long, because they are a little too dry.  Still good though.  I would make again, and try to underbake them and let them set up before eating.  Great flavor!  We had these as brownie sundaes with Caramel Butter Pecan Ice cream, whipped cream, and caramel sauce.

I thought this was a great recipe.  I sprinkled the chocolate chips on top instead of mixing into the dough.  I would cut back on the salt next time just a little.  It tasted phenomenal hot from the oven but the salt came through a little too much the next day when it cooled.

Extremely sweet, serving these with ice cream made my teeth ache. Nice chewy consistency. I increased the salt to 3/4 tsp to add a salty caramel edge. In my oven, 20 minutes was sufficient. I think these taste better chilled, cut into small squares.

Amazing recipe! This was the perfect base 'blondie' (The name I call them) recipe. I used chopped pecans instead of the walnuts, adding half of the nuts into the batter and then using the other half to sprinkle over the top before baking. After reading reviews from others, I baked this in a 8x8 in square pan, which turned out to be the perfect size. These baked very well and filled the kitchen with a delicious scent. Next time I will definitely add some berries on top and maybe chocolate chips. Such a great recipe!

I was a little skeptical about these seeing how thick my batter was but...I got non stop rave reviews.  I added in a handful of semi sweet chocolate chips to give them some flavor. I also doubled this recipe and it just barely fit into a 9x13. These are RICH brownies. I topped them with caramel frosting from this website. DELICIOUS!

Exactly what I was looking for!  Delicious and chewy.  This recipe makes only enough for a 9x9 pan so I think I will double next time.  I would NOT cut back on the salt.  I think the sweet and the saltiness are perfect.  Also very easy.   I melt the butter and let my kids (4 and 2) do most of the work.

These were just okay. They had a nice butterscotch flavor but I could taste the salt. The texture was on the dry, cakey side. They were bland on their own, so I would suggest adding some kind of frosting or chips to them.

These were not good. They tasted like a ball of salty goo. I added chocolate chips, and that is the only good part. I usually like blondies, but not these.

Good even when prepared without butter.  Wow!  I'm nursing my second baby and she has been having some issues with food allergies, so I've had to cut a bunch of my favorite foods from my diet.  Most recently, her doctor had me cut all dairy products--no milk, no cheese, NO BUTTER!!!  Since I'm also not allowed to eat chocolate, I've been looking for some new dessert recipes that can be adapted for my special diet.  I prepared these blondies with canola oil instead of butter and they are awesome!

I'm giving only 4 stars on this because on its own this recipe is not amazing but it's a really good base recipe for adding whatever you like(nuts, chocolate, fruit). I baked this for 28 minutes and it turned out really gooey. Definitely had to eat it with a fork.

OMG -- my mom used to make these all the times when we were kids.  I lost her recipe and I'm so glad I found it here.  I will be making them this Christmas (for Santa - ha ha).    They are great!  We loved the brownies!  An added bonus is the nutritional information is included.  It also works well with self-rising flour.

I have made these brownies twice in as many days and they just do not last past a few hours! My family LOVED these. So quick and easy to prepare! I tried them with the nuts and they were great, the second time I tried them with 1/4 cup of coconut in the batter and some sprinkled on top before baking. These too were just gobbled up! The combination of crispy yet chewy edges is just perfect. My boyfriend thinks I'm a baking goddess! Thank you for a great recipe!

These were so good.  Took less than 5 minutes to put together, and so tasty!  I only baked for 25 mins, till the edges were brown.  I used an 8x8 pan, but I think a bigger one would be just fine, they came out thick.  I also added some chocolate chips to it, and didn't put in the nuts, you could do both, I just don't care for nuts and I didn't have any.

This was pretty good, the way I would expect blondies to taste.  I followed the recipe making it in an 8x8 pan and cooking it for 27 minutes.  It was a little dry so I think I will try 25 minutes next time.

I went exactly by the recipe and they were really bad.  They were dry and crumbly without any moisture even right from the oven.  I served them with ice cream just to make them so we could eat them.  Will not use this again.

These are really yummy, although maybe a tad too sweet for my taste. We added a cup of Ghirardelli chocolate chips, and skipped the nuts (hubby doesn't like). They taste like a sugary chewy, chocolate chip cookie! Thanks for sharing.

Simplicity at it's best. These are wonderful with chocolate chips. Eliminated nuts [personal preference] but would be equally good with them. The balance of butter and brown sugar is exactly right. This is a keeper!

Since I used 1 cup chocolate chips and no walnuts, this came out like really good cookie bars. I went a touch lighter on the salt, used low-fat margarine, and did 1/3 cup whole wheat flour and 1 cup white. Very tasty.

I rated  this recipe a 5 because it was super simple to make.  The only change i made was to completely melt the butter before mixing it into the dry ingredients.  It was chewy and yummy and went well with my morning coffee!

Delicious! Sweetness was on point, and I added pecans (Had no walnuts) and it added such a nice flavor! I did not have the full 1 cup of brown sugar, I only had 3/4 of a cup, so I just added 1/4 cup of white sugar and it tasted great. I LOVE THIS RECIPE! I will keep this!

Made exactly as recipe stated except added semi sweet chips rather than nuts (allergy family). Used wet hand to pat dough into pan, which worked great.  Love that the recipe only a makes an 8x8 pan--don't always need a big pan of goodies!

For those of you having trouble pressing the dough into the pan, use the wrapper that the butter came in, I first use it to grease the pan, too! I used butterscotch and chocolate chips the first time I made these, but only chocolate chips today. The batter is buttery enough. I used a 9x9 pan but think I will try an 8x8 next time. These brownies are buttery and chewy and we like them very much, also very quick and easy to make.

Instead of butter we used crisco butter flavored......because we were out of butter we improvised.
We left out the salt.  
Total cook time  35 minutes in a glass pan.
It was delicious! 
Next time,  I m going to try ground dried apricots with applesauce with coconut oil versus the /crisco butter to get the same moist texture.

Very good brownie.  It rose nicely, it cut nicely, and it tasted great. Soft, yet chewy, just how we think a brownie should taste! I made both versions of this recipe.  As written for one pan, and submitters idea of adding chocolate chips for a chocolate version.  I took them to Girls Night Out, and they were enjoyed by all. Mine were done at the 25 minute mark.

Can't put it in a 9x13 with the recipe as is but it's perfect in a 9x9.  I make the recipe exactly, with the chocolate chips mixed in.  Comes out perfect every time.  Once I swapped the butter out for coconut oil and added a touch more flour to get the right consistency and it came out just as delicious!

Mmmmm Brown Sugar and Butter. For me that's all I need to hear. This recipe includes simple ingredients that I always have on hand and the directions are easy to follow. The brownies are soft with a good chew, not too cake like. I decided to forgo the nuts and add butterscotch morsels. Doubling this recipe and baking in a 13x9 pan lined with parchment paper worked out very well. Love these!

This was such a breeze to make & delicious! I didn't use nuts or chocolate chips.  I sifted 2 teaspoons of cocoa powder into the flour mixture and they turned out perfect!! Just the right amount of chocolate...enough to satisfy my craving :) I will definitely be keeping this recipe! Thank you!

AMAZING. I read the reviews, wondered if it would go terribly wrong if I just followed the directions as is- it didn't. I tend to think the sifting of the flour is a pretty important step here- though I didn't- so I used  just a tiny bit less flour, not filling the measuring cup all the way...maybe an 1/8 cup less, if that. My walnut chopping (banging with fist) husband measured more like 3/4 of a cup of walnuts, and we threw in a hastily broken (and partially eaten- ahem, John) Hershey bar in the mix. I did taste the salt in it, but I think it complements the sweetness of the brown sugar and the nuttiness of, well, the nuts. One of the best desserts I have ever had.

Great easy recipe.  I put carmel 'pearls' (the kind you can make carmel apples with) instead of white chocolate & everyone loved them!  They became a little harder but still very good!  I'll try them with the white chocolate chips next.

These were great for a chocolate free recipe...I am of the opinion that "if it doesn't have chocolate, what's the point." These had great flavor and a nice "brownie" texture.  I made these as a chocolate free option for a party, everyone loved them.

I added the chocolate chips and omitted the nuts (we're not nut-brownie people). I was a little suspect as the batter was more of a dough consistency, but I squished it into the pan and pressed on. Once it was out of the oven, I cut a large chunk and topped the hot brownie with a scoop of vanilla icecream. If I had a little whipped cream and chocolate sauce, I would never need to go to Moxie's for their dreamy dessert ever again! I made sure to have some the next day to get and accurate taste of the flavours that this brownie had to offer. A little dry, but not insufferably so, and also a little salty. I think that this recipe works best as a component of a dessert moreso than if it were served alone.

By far the best "blondie" bar I've tried - tastes just like one I've had at a well-known restaurant.  The only things I changed were to use pecans instead of walnuts and I did not bake it as long as it said - I set my timer for 20 minutes, checked it, and baked it for another 2 1/2 minutes.  It was perfect - moist without being too gooey.

I just tried this recipe and unfortunately I am disappointed. I read the reviews and decided to decrease the salt, shorten the bake time and size of pan. When I mixed the batter as described in the recipe it was SO thick that I couldn't even stir it. It was so dry that I added an egg-still thick so I added one more egg (totaling 3 eggs) and spread it in the greased pan. I also sprinkled cinnamon on the surface before fully baked. It was nothing like a brownie. Dry, dense, unflavorful. I was truly unhappy with the result. I probably messed it up more.

Wow! Not at all what I expected. Because my husband cannot have chocolate I thought I would give this recipes a try and I am glad I did. I added about 1/2 C of butterscoth chips, these turned out perfect. Thanks for posting such a wonderful alternative to chocolate brownies!

I love brown sugar and this recipe highlights that flavor.  Not overwhelming though.  I used cho. chips because my company was allergic to nuts. Will make next time with nuts and cho. chips. VERY easy and quick. Great with coffee the next morning.

These are good, but I think I was looking for the blondies that my mom made when I was little.  I wanted something a little bit more chewy.

My husband requested the "Butterscotch Brownies" he remembered from years ago.  I had never heard of them, but found many recipes for them here, including this great recipe.  These were excellent, in my opinion.  My ideal dessert - I ate half the pan in a blink of the eye!  If you don't care for sweet, rich, heavy treats, these may not be for you.  Kind of taste like a buttery, dense and chewy chocolate chip cookie minus the chocolate chips.  I had to put my baby to sleep, so I set the timer for 25 minutes and had my husband take them out.  Had I been there to check them, I would have baked them a bit longer...although I generally like things not-quite-baked-enough, these are rich and chewy enough that underbaking isn't necessary to acheive that texture.  A must try!

These are now my favorite brownies.  I put whatever I want in them (chocolate chips,peanut butter chips, nuts, etc.).  The best was when I put in miniature chocolate bars that had been shredded in the food processor.  The brownies came out yellow with chocolate swirls.

These had an overall good flavor, but they were much too dry. If I decide to make them again, I'm going to add a lot more butter and maybe one extra egg, and reduce the amount of flour.

Delicious and great balance of sweet and salty. They were eaten up within minutes.  I added chopped up heath bar to make them toffee blondies.

I made a double recipe to fit a 9 x 13" pan. I used a bit less salt since I bake with salted butter. I also melted the butter before mixing it with sugar and eggs. I believe that made it easier to pour and spread in the pan. Added semi sweet chocolate chunks. Baked about 26 minutes. The taste and texture are fabulous. These were supposed to be for hubby to take to share at his office tomorrow. But now he says we're keeping them. Great recipe!

I had to review this because when I made it I was like wtf is this weird, sticky, consistency batter that I probably could use to spackle a wall? I’ve been used to much thinner batter when making brownies. If you are weirded out by the consistency as well when you make these, don’t fret! Keep going! These are so light and have the perfect amount of sweetness. I don’t like nuts so I didn’t add those but I used some coconut in them and they’re amazing. Love this recipe. Thank you, to whoever posted it.

I did make this but it did not rise as stated and it was very thick.  I had to spray the spatula to spread it in the pan.  Did not have almonds so I baked it plain.  As as someone else said it was more like a cookie than a brownie, I have to agree. it was very tasty.  Not sure if I would make this again.

Very easy and delicious!  I melted my butter before mixing and  added white chocolate chips, toffee chips and walnuts.  OMG!  

ETA:  I have made these a half dozen times now and I am convinced this is the best recipe ever.  I mix and match new  add-ins every time.  I've used pecans, white chocolate chips, toffee chips, chocolate chips, cranberry bits, walnuts....etc.   I don't think you can mess this up if you tried.  

My favorite combo so far is white chocolate chips with cranberries and walnuts.

Delicious! I omitted the walnuts and used almond flour. I also added about a teaspoon or two of cinnamon. Very moist and reminded me a bit of samoas in taste. Maybe that's from the almond flour?

This is my favorite dessert of all time. Takes 5 minutes to make with ingredients we all have. Do not know why I enjoy it so much, but I sure do. Today I added some shredded coconut, not baked yet, so hope it will be just as good. Thanks for this.

They are decent. I didn’t have any chocolate chips so I’m guessing they would be a lot better with chocolate. Easy to make! The dough comes out thick but when it comes out of the oven it’s the right texture. They would also be good with a drizzle of sauce on top, maybe chocolate or a blonde brownie sauce. They are good with milk..

I made this yesterday, and while it tastes good, it is dry especially around the edges..  It probably needed a bigger pan, 11 x 7, so the batter could spread better.

These were a hit here. The texture is a brownie/cookie. The batter concerned me a little, but it tasted very good and had a nice texture. I added white chocolate chips and topped with vanilla ice cream. I made them in a 9" round pie pan which seemed to be the perfect size dish. Baking time is also accurate.

This was fantastic! I have been looking for a good Blondie-type recipe since I don't like chocolate, and this by far exceeds anything I have tried. I followed the suggestion in one of the reviews and used melted butter instead of softened butter, which I think helped keep these moist. I also added a Tablespoon of Cinnamon to make them more of a Snicker doodle taste. I left the nuts out as no one in my family cares for them. Next time, I will try this with butterscotch or white chocolate chips.

These are delicious. I made them as an easy treat with my two young nieces. The girls loved making them, and the bars turned out well. We sprinkled them with a bit of cinnamon just because my niece wanted to, and that was a tasty alteration.

This recipe is rich and sweet.  I made it using the stevia/splenda blended brown sugar and it came out just as good as when I used regular brown sugar.  The most recent attempt I actually layered mini marshmallows and dark chocolate chips between two layers of batter before baking.  Tasted good, but had to let it set up in the pan overnight before cutting as the marshmallow formed a molten layer under the upper crust. Next time I will just mix the marshmallows and chips into the batter.  The batter is rather thick and sticky and can be difficult to spread, but the blondies are so worth it.  Just a tad thicker than my normal chocolate brownie batter.

Delicious!  The dough was thicker than I anticipated, but it ended up so delicious!  I frosted it with a cream cheese brown sugar frosting after eating some, and it tastes so amazing either way.  The entire family loves it.

The second time, I tried it with dark brown sugar and olive oil instead of butter.  There was a richer molasses flavor and obviously it didn't have that buttery taste, but the batter was easier to spread and it turned out even moister.

The third time, I used dark brown sugar and virgin coconut oil instead of butter.  The rich molasses flavor was still there, and the coconut oil added a faint and delicious taste to it, especially once it was chilled.

A fourth time, I made this with two eggs.  I had to cook it a minute longer, but oh my goodness!  I like it best so far with an extra egg, no doubt!

This is a cookie recipe, not a brownie recipe. They came out dry but tasted good. Should  have added chocolate chips and formed into balls on a baking sheet.

I've made these many times, and they're always a hit! I never use the nuts. Sometimes I'll use maple sugar in lieu of some of the brown sugar - then I really see folks smile!

I was craving some kind of blondies and came upon this recipe. I added some cinnamon to it to make it closer to a Graham cracker. The pan I used made it a little thinner when I placed it in so I only baked for 18-20 minutes. After I let them cool I put some mini marshmellows on it and heated some chocolate frosting for 15 minutes in the microwave to drizzle on top. BAM! Smores blondies! Thanks for your recipe!

Made this for a party and they were a hit! I did add chopped pecans to the batter and sprinkled the top with white chocolate chips.I also followed others advice and melted the butter. I added an extra egg  but only because I used gluten free flour. 
DO NOT over-bake them...they will  firm up as they cool. I left mine in the oven  with the heat off for about twenty minutes to firm them up without over-baking.

These are great! I have made them with and without chocolate chips and always add walnuts. I followed everyone else's recommendations about salt and just used 1/2 a teaspoon for the doubled recipe. It is a thick batter, but if you cream the butter well it will help. An electric mixer would make it less hard work too.

Baked these last night. So simple. The batter thickness had me skeptical but turned out great. I left out the nuts and put in white chocolate chips instead. I baked mine in a round disposable cake pan and they came out nice and chewy.  I pulled Alton Brown's trick of pulling them out to sit for a bit and then baking them again.  Great versatile base for lots of playing with mix-ins.

The brownies came out dry and cake like. I didn't modify the recipe with the exception of adding spices (clove nutmeg and cinnamon). Since I don't know exactly which ingredient gives brownies their chewy texture, I don't know how to tweak this. Sooooo I will continue my search...

Great  I had a recipe for brown sugar brownies but couldn't find it and thought this would work and it did.  If you melt the butter in a pan and then add sugar vanilla and egg it will mix easier. Than add flour baking powder salt and nuts and you only used only
 one pan.

I literally just created a profile after years of using Allrecipes to say how freakin' good these blondies/brown sugar brownies/butterscotch brownies were. I made them plain and they were moist, chewy and flavorful. I melted the butter 90% of the way and it made a nice dark brown paste when I added the brown sugar so I'm pretty sure you're supposed to melt it. I baked for 27 minutes but ended up putting them back in for another like 2 minutes. My mom used to make "butterscotch brownies" when I was little and I tried making them a few months ago from the BHG Big Red cookbook and they were sad. These were so good!

I found that they tasted great but the batter was really dry and crummy. I had to press it down in the pan so hit would stick together..... I would have used  only one cup of flour in stead of one 1/3 cups of flour.

as others have posted on this recipe, the batter was super dry, so I added around a quarter cup of milk to get it to consistency.  Also added a bit of cinnamon.  Family loved it, tastes great with ice cream!

Hubby gives 5 stars for taste; I give 5 for ease of prep.  I followed other reviewers using less salt and doubled the recipe using unsalted butter, mixing the chopped walnuts in with the flour mixture before adding, then sprinkling chocolate chips over batter before baking.  Used the Pampered Chef bar pan rather than a 9 x 13 pan and they turned out just great.  Mine baked approx. 30 min. but ovens vary so much.  Oh yeah, it's a keeper.

I reduced the amount of sugar to 3/4 cup. The flavor was good but it turned out super dry. I didn't think reducing the sugar would do that but maybe it got rid of the gooey aspect of a typical blondie bar...

Instead of 20 brownies, I cut mine into 16 larger pieces. I could've eaten the whole pan myself, but my mom frowned on that idea haha My mom had said that I have had these before, but I couldn't remember when. So it must have been a really long time. I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out great! I really love the chewy texture to them.

I doubled the recipe and added 3/4 cup of white chocolate chips, as well as pecans instead of walnuts (or vice versa, can't remember) and baked it in a 9X13 pan for the full 40 minutes. Came out delicious!

Just like Grandmas! Doubled the recipe for 9x13 pan. Used 2 slightly heaped cups of (unsifted) flour... Probably would have measured 2 1/4C... I was being lazy! Also added a bag of heath chips... Couldn't really taste them but they added to the delicious caramely flavor these bars already have. The key with these is to take them out as soon as they're set so they still have that super soft chewy texture to them once they cool. I love that you can add anything to these! Nuts, heath, chocolate, white choc, pb or butterscotch chips... Yum!

very good. The only thing I changed was I used pecans instead of walnuts. I found this recipe because i had last minute company and wasn't able to go to the store. Fortunately  I had all the ingredients for this recipe. It was a huge hit and will make this again

I don't know how this turned out good for anyone.  I read the reviews and was thrilled but it was not eaten.  It was a thick dough, like for cookies, but I spread it in pan.  It baked nicely.  But was thick, dry, not much flavor.  Did not even taste like brown sugar. I am very disappointed.

Super easy & Yummy too! These turned out perfectly thick and moist. I doubled the recipe and per other reviews, I melted the butter which really helped with spreading in the pan. These are very versatile too... I added Heath bar bits! Next time I will try the walnuts with chocolate chips. Thanks for sharing!!

This was very tasty & easy to make, was a tiny bit dry so I made the sauce from Granny's Cake on this site, poked some holes & poured over the top. Would make again, trying some add ins.

These were nicer than I expected, but not totally awesome. I wasn't sure what "blondies" were, but I did a little looking, and that's pretty much what this recipe was. I'm not sure I'd ever had blondies before, and I still love brownies more, but this was nice. I made it exactly as written, and the batch lasted me for about a week. When reheated slightly in the microwave, they were slightly melt-in-your-mouth. I'm not sure I'll make these again, but they were definitely worth trying.

I followed the recipe almost exactly, I doubled the vanilla, added about 1/4 tsp of almond extract and left out the walnuts and they came out moist, chewy and delicious! I baked for about 20 mins and they were perfect! Thanks!

These were delicious!  They really did have the maple flavor that other reviewers talked about and were fairly moist, even though I used applesauce in place of butter.  I will make these again!

These were not bad but the flavor just wasn't there. I think if there was more sugar they might've been better, the texture however was nice, and they were pretty dense.

I decided to add about a teaspoon of maple flavored extract to the dough, and I put in 1 cup of butterscotch chips.  I've had "blondies" without chips before and find them a little lacking.  With the chips and maple, these were awesome. Just know that butterscotch chips are very sweet, so if you don't like very sweet desserts but would still like to add a bit more sweetness to the basic recipe, you can always go with semisweet chocolate chips for a good balance between the two.

these turned out horrible. they took 15 minutes longer then said. The outsides were burnt. the chips fell thru and were stuck to the bottom of the pan. they also there extremely thin. just not good at all. I dont know what happened. I followed the recipe to a T. this happens every-time i make blondies...no matter the recipe. it must be my fault. lol

I added just a pinch of cinnamon and dark chocolate chips instead of nuts.  The edges baked hard and crunchy and the middle was soft and gooey. ( They seemed a little greasy, but it may be that I had to use egg replacer due to an egg allergy so that can affect the final outcome.)  Next time, I'll cut back some of the salt.  Otherwise, they were great.

These will be in heavy rotation at our house!

I LOVED this recipe. I ended up following some of the other reviewers advice and adding chocolate chips (I omitted the walnuts). When I finished the batter I was skeptical because it was very thick, and I didn't think there would be enough to fill the pan, but everything turned out great in the end. I'd recommend baking them for 20-25 minutes.

1 change - bake in small square pan.  I have no idea how this would fit in a 9x13!!  I love this recipe because it makes a small batch for the 2 of us.  I prefer them with walnuts and no choc chips.  It's so easy when you just want something sweet.  It's so simple too! I make this like twice a month.

My kids enjoyed these with vanilla ice cream.  I wish I would have had chocolate chips to add with them b/c I think I would have enjoyed them more.  I used an 8x8 pan and cooked for 25 minutes.  They were slightly moist in the middle.  I think a larger pan would make them much thinner, so decrease the cooking time.

I was expecting a moist brownie but instead, these came out very dry and way too sweet.  I followed the directions to a T.  I will not be making these again.

I followed the recipe except no nuts and added a cup of peanut butter chips and about 6 hershey kisses with caramel inside. I kinda like it, but if I made it again I would only use a half cup of pb chips and more kisses.

Very very good!  I added one King size bag of M&M's, and it reminded me of a big cookie cake! I did use an 8x8 pan- I'm not sure how you could have spread this recipe into anything bigger.  The consistancy of the dough is really sticky but don't be alarmed.  It cooks up really well.  I will definitely use this again- it was super easy!

I still thought they were a little salty. I think the nuts and chocolate really made it taste great though. Also the 8X8 pan was perfect.

These were pretty good. I added about 1 cup of chocolate chips, but there was NO way this was going to fill a 13x9 pan, so I stuck with a 9x9. The taste isn't bad, not the best thing I've ever made. They're very soft, I was hoping for a little more chewy. All in all, a good recipe, I may make it again.

I did not like these that well.  I baked mine for 20 mins and the edges were very dry and crispy.  My husband said they tasted just like a sugar cookie.  I agree.  I was looking for something more gooey/chewy also like one other reviewer said.  I thought these were too dry.

I made 1/2 batch for an overnight trip because I thought they would transport well, which they did.  I did not expect to eat them all!  These are delicious, very dense and chewy.  Good plain, but definitely better with a handful of chocolate chips.

This is incredible.  I used chopped almonds because they were what I had to hand and left the rest as per the recipe.  They came out soft, a bit gooey in the middle and with a wonderful caramel flavour.

These are great!  I used 1 cup AP flour, 1/3 cup WW, as one poster suggested.  I also used 1/4 tsp. of salt, and I did add 2/3 cup of choc. chips (we love chocolate here!).  I cooked them in a 8 X 8 pan for 35 minutes, then cooled 15 before cutting.  They're divine!!  I also like them because they only made 16 small pieces -- they won't tempt me for days and days!!!  :)

My kids and I loved this recipe.  I would porbably reduce the salt next time.  I also used chocolate chips.  My son called it a giant chocolate chip cookie.

I wasn't sure my family would like this one since they are die hard chocolate brownie fans, but this was the only one I had everything to make.  Turns out they loved it!  It's now been added to my regular "cookie jar list".

Delicious!  Quick, easy, and the little ones ate them all up.  I thought that the 9 x 9 pan wouldn't work very well, but it ended up being perfect.
