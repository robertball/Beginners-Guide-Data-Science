It smelled sooooo good cooking and I wanted to love it, but alas, it didn't work for me.  I used the smallest bake dish the ham would fit into so I wouldn't have to dilute the flavors with lots of additional water needed to cover the ham, but the flavors (although good) were still muted.  As the ham baked, it curled up above the cooking liquid.  I flipped it over while cooking, but it still turned out dry.  Perhaps covering the bake dish with foil would prevent the ham from drying out, or double the initial brown sugar/Worcestershire/clove mix.

Incredibly easy and delicious! This ham steak passed the test with all of my picky eaters, too! I used 2 lbs. ham steak, doubled all the ingredients and baked in a 9 x 13 in. baking dish, sprinkled a little ground cloves as I didn't have whole ones on hand, and flipped the ham steaks over halfway through cooking. No dry, curly meat...turned out perfect! It was such easy prep, it was nice to be able to concentrate on the side dishes to accompany this meal.

The ham was nice and moist. I covered the dish with foil as others suggested, and used ground cloves instead of whole cloves. The reason why it gets three stars is because the flavors were simply too muted to really taste past the ham. If I made this again, I would use way less water-- just enough to cover the bottom of the pan, not enough to cover the ham itself-- to see if I could bring the other ingredients to the forefront. Otherwise, a very easy, straightforward recipe for dinner.

This just looked like a decent start so I had to attempt.....with a few modifications of course, the original recipe just seemed to be missing a few flavor opportunities.  First off.....water was replaced with no sodium chicken stock (ham or veggie stock would be great also) and a splash of bourbon.  I then added a few (10) whole black peppercorns, a bay leaf, 1t. salt (on ham only), and the brown sugar I used I smoked to give it that outdoor grill taste.  I also added a pinch of crushed red pepper for a little heat.  Then tossed into a 425° oven ( i run all my ovens @425) for 25 min. or so until tasty hot.  Not to bad for a first run, now to fine tune this and see where it takes me.

I baked my ham covered.  It made a very moist ham slice.  I didn't have whole cloves either so I used about a 1/2 t. of ground cloves.  Easy recipe to throw together after work.

Out of this world! Hubs even requested that I make ham steaks this way all the time. Followed recipe to the letter. 
Covered with foil while cooking and flipped 1/2 way. Highly recommend! Easy, delicious, and fast. Made Mac n cheese and green beans to go with. Recipe saved!

This ham turned out so good for me.  The only thing I did different is I added more brown sugar plus I used ground cloves instead of whole cloves being that I didn't have whole ones.

Tasted really good.  I didn't use a cup of water, though  -- maybe a quarter cup -- and only 1 T. of  Worcester sauce.   I also added about 2 T of butter.  I baked for 20 min covered with foil, turned the ham, then only 10 more min uncovered.  Thirty minutes was more than long enough in the oven.  Husband really liked the sauce.

I had one ham steak (16 oz.) and used the recipe exactly with less water (about 1/2 cup). I cooked at 400 degrees for 30 mins with foil on top. (I was making asparagus as well so wanted the higher temp.) It was very good and very easy. A nice change to plain ham steak with a touch of the clove flavor and very juicy.

I've made this several times with ham steak from Costco (awesome ham steaks) and my family loves it. It couldn't be easier. I make two ham-steaks without doubling the  Worcestershire sauce, sugar and (ground) cloves and it does the trick. I flip half way through. Very adaptable recipe when time is a concern. I've baked as recipe states and I've baked it low and longer when I have to run out but want dinner ready when I get back.

My family really liked this.  I will keep this in my rotation of meals.  It was so easy and quick to make.  The ham was so juicy.  I also,used two ham steaks and the recipe was still fine.  I occasionally basted the ham with liquid from the baking pan.  I highly recommend !

This recipe is just the ticket for a quick weeknight meal.  I also used ground cloves and covered the ham slice while it baked.  Served with Mom's Favorite Baked Mac & Cheese from this site and steamed broccoli.  Will certainly make this again.

Excellent!! I placed a cookie sheet over the baking dish to  avoid dry ham [Thanks to previous posts], and it was a hit!! Additionally, I added a splash of liquid smoke, and substituted ground cloves [had to make due with what was in the cupboard].

Nothing fancy, but a good way to add a bit of flavor to ham steak.  Easy and quick to fix.  Ingredients are common pantry items.  I used 1/2 teaspoon of crushed cloves because I did not have whole cloves.  Used a glass dish covered with foil.  Cooked for 30 minutes at 350.  No problems with curling.  I will probably end up fixing this again.

Delicious and oh so easy.  I followed the recipe exactly as written.  I did need to add additional water to make sure the ham was always covered.  Next time I might add additional brown sugar, Worcestershire sauce and whole clove due to the additional water.........on the hand, it was so good as it was, maybe not.

This had great flavor and smelled wonderful. It's one problem was that, even though I covered it with tin foil, it was still rather dry. It is still by far the best ham steak recipe I've yet made. It tastes great with homemade mashed potatoes.

I made this exactly according to the recipe. It was delicious and simple because I had all the ingrédients in my pantry. It was the  perfect addition to my New Year's Day Brunch. SO EASY!

Next time I make this, I will substitute pineapple juice for the water. I think it will be tasty and I think I will add the pineapple slices as well.

I made this with 2 ham steaks. I didn’t have Worcester sauce so I used Dale’s seasoning. I also had to slow the cook time down because we were away from the house about 3-4 hours before we ate, so I baked it at 275. The meat was SO tender with just enough sweet to it. I covered the pan with foil and had no trouble with dryness. We will do this again!

I liked the sauce recipe except I didn’t use any water in it. I set the ham on a rack in a roasting pan, topped it with the sauce,  Put 2 cups of water in the pan, tented it with aluminum foil,  and baked for 30 minutes. It was moist and perfect!

This had a better flavor than I expected. The cloves we're a nice touch. I covered my ham steaks with tin foil and baked for 35 minutes. A good, simple recipe for weeknights.

Easy, but not a fan.   Really takes away the taste of the ham.

I covered the ham with foil and turned it over halfway through.  It was all right, but it was a little tough.  Maybe it just needs to cook a little longer?

I changed it a little. I didn't have an brown sugar but I did have honey. I only had one ham steak but I coated it in the honey (about five teaspoons). Most of the honey dissolved in the water but the broth it made was awesome. Going to use it and the left overs to make ham bone soup later this week.

this was good. I used chicken broth instead of water and poured in some spiced whiskey. it was easy which is what I wanted. not an amazing meal, but was quick and tasty.

I made to the recipe. But not to my taste.
 But it was easy and fast. 
I will stick to the grill.

Easy and tastes great! After finding this recipe I have used it every time I cook ham. a lot of the time I double it (except for the ham) to better cover the steak.
