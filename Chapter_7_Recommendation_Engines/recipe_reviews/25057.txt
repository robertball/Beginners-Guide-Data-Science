These bars are a good way to use Cream of Wheat. The recipe was modified to say 1/3 cup honey and I used cinnamon instead of cardamom ( I didn't have any).  These taste very good and are more healthy for the kids.

These cookies were not very good at all. They were dry and overpowered by the spice. The recipe called for 1/3 tsp. of honey (did it mean to say 1/3 cup of honey?) They were not sweet at all as fortold in the description.

My family and I love this recipe.  I used cinnamon instead of the cardamom, some lemon juice instead of the lemon zest, used 2 eggs instead of 4 egg whites and doubled the coconut.  It was very moist and had a mild flavor.  Best of all...we know it's healthy!  Yum!  People have already asked for the recipe after trying some.

I will make this again, and again. The basic bars can be flavored many ways. I stuck to the lemon zest, but next time I think I'll add cranberries or raisins.I only used the 1/3 cup of honey to make it more diabetic friendly, and it was just slightly sweet.I also substituted allspice or the cardamom. They were very tasty as great snack or morning bar. I was lazy and added my almonds to the top of the bars turned out fine.

Not sure why I didn't like these, maybe it was texture that put me off.

Made with brown rice farina for a gf recipe. These have a lightly sweet flavor with a bit of a crunch, probably due to the brown rice farina I used. My kids love them and they also satisfied my sweet craving on a warm summer day! I will make them again.

The flavor wasn't too bad, it was interesting with the lemon and cardamom but it was just way way too dry.

I had several boxes of farina and gave it .a try.   I added one chopped apple and one tablespoon dried lemon peel that when rehydrated came to three tablespoons.  Didn't have cardamom at the time so added twice the amount of Apple pie spice.   Also I use two whole slightly beaten eggs instead of four egg whites.  I didn't add the sugar but added one third CUP of honey.   Everyone who had some said it was absolutely delicious and couldn't believe no flour but only farina!    I will make these often!

This tasted fine but it came out pretty dry. Definitely eat it with a glass of milk nearby. I'm willing to try this again though, maybe with added milk to the batter.

Way too dry; very little flavor (lemon zest was not enough). Looking for a way to use a box of Farina, but this was not it!

I enjoyed these as breakfast bars, snack bars, and dessert.  Having a 13 x 9 pan of them was a bit much for two people, hence my need to modify them.
