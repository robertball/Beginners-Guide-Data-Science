"Watermelonade" is exactly what this is - here in Mexico, agua fresca con limon is limonada, or lemonade. Where I live, on the west coast of Mexico, agua fresca is made with every fruit imaginable. I had some guests for dinner recently and the evening was very warm. Half of our guests drank this delightful drink (with added sliced limes) and half had Watermelon Sangria, also from this site. Both were wonderful, but I preferred the agua fresca. And straining the pulp makes all the difference - thanks for the tip, Chef John.

I have made this last month from another recipe I found that was similar, but I used soda water to give it a fizz, you can also add some vodka for an adult drink. Very good.

This was tasty and refreshing.  I think I added too much sugar.  I also made the mistake of making 2 batches at the same time.  It does not keep well.

This was a refreshing  drink. I followed exactly, although I was tempted not to strain it so that  I don't lose any nutritional benefit in the pulp.. But had I done that I would have ended up with a cold watermelon soup verse a drink !

Like other persons suggested I added lots of lemon juice and mint and it turned out very good and refreshing. I did NOT strain the fruit puree/juice as we like the pulp. I shall try again with different combinaisons of summer fruits.

I have made this for many years. It is a favorite beverage in Ecuador as well.  But I never found that any sugar was necessary at all. Perhaps the watermelons were sweeter.

Ok, so this is really like a watermelonade than agua fresco. I added some fresh mint and it was better.

I am making it again today because I loved it.  So refreshing & a great way to use up a whole watermelon before it gets mushy.

I think it might be more appealing with a fizzy water instead of plain water.

I definitely recommend removing the froth from the top of the finished product.  My husband loved this, especially after working outside under the hot Texas sun!

I added a tablespoon of lime juice after reading some review of other recipes, but I didn't notice a difference in flavor. I'll use a little more next time I make it until I like the flavor. I also used a personal-size watermelon instead of  half a regular-size watermelon. I added 5 tablespoons of simple syrup because I didn't want it to be too sweet. The flavor was great -- I am anxious to try it when it is really cold in the morning. I used a fine mesh strainer, but maybe need to find one with finer mesh. There was still a fine sediment of watermelon in the drink, but I hope it settles overnight.

Have made this over a dozen times.  So perfect, just the way it is.  Watermelon is high on the glycemic index, so I'm gonna have to cool it a bit, or maybe just make it for guests, who all loved it too.  The new lemonade.

Too much sugar! I used 3 tablespoons, and it was still sweet enough. I also used juice from 3 limes.

I have never reviewed a recipe before today. Recipes always seem to me to have an "expected result " in the taste and flavor profile. However, this one surprised me. It was so refreshing with a  clean finish. Thank you chef John!

Yum! Didn't have a fine mesh strainer, but a thin kitchen towel worked just fine instead.
