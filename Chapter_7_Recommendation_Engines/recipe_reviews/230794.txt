Didn't change a thing - everyone loved it. It fed 10 people and many had seconds, some had thirds. One slight variation: I used sliced dill pickles because there were some kids who don't like to see anything they don't expect in their food. I strained out what pickles were left and chopped them into invisibility! Fooled them ;) Clever Papa!

I was not really impressed with this recipe.  It was okay, but not that good.

Worked well.  Was a little too juicy after 7 hours, separated the juice and reduced it down; still a little "pickley"...but threw it on a Hawaiian bun with a little more BBQ sauce...worked REALLY well...almost no "pickley" then.

It's always fun to try a new take on an old recipe.  The pickles were actually rather understated, but a good addition I thought.  Made for a crowd, and all enjoyed it on small rolls for sliders.

This was easy and so delicious! My husband, who does not like pickles of any kind, loved it! Even the kids liked it, which is rare for meat of this kind. I only had 28oz of pickles so I added 3/4 cup of chicken broth (not ideal but what I had.) We will definitely make this again!
