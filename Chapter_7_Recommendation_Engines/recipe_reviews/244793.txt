Great sauce! I used 1/2 cup honey which helped reduce it to get a more sticky finish.  Great recipe

This was tasty. I didn't add quite as much mustard as it said, because I ran out. But it was super yummy!!! A good strong flavor for dipping or glazing. I actually glazed grilled chicken breasts with it, and it was delicious. oh, and I was impatient for it to reduce enough, so I did add a little cornstarch and water to thicken it up more quickly. But I don't think that really affects the flavor. I will make this again for sure.

I made this for a party, and it was a big hit!  I couldnâ€™t find ginger paste, so I used 1/4 tsp ground ginger. Great flavor!

We had a "wing off" with a group of friends. We had 7 different styles of wing sauces. This was one of the favorites. I doubled the recipe to have enough for 2 dozen wings. After tasting it I decided to add about 50% more brown sugar to sweeten it up a little bit.

I would suggest using Sambal Chili Garlic sauce in place of the chili flakes.  Next time I would use both red wine vinegar and rice vinegar.   I could have reduced the sauce a bit more than I did.   Over all, these are really tasty.  Serve with a stack of napkins!
