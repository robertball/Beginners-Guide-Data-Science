That an awesome and easy to make pie.  Well, I took a shortcut and used a frozen pie crust.  But, it was so easy.  I picked this recipe becasue I was out of brown sugar and did a search to see if there was such an apple pie using only white- and here it is!   I did take one reviewer's advice and added 1 TB lemon juice and 2 TB cornstarch - then as advised, put it all in a saucepan to ensure the apples cook better.   After about 20 on 'low' (and stirring frequently!), I poured it into my premade crust.  Then, for the topping, I didn't have a pastry cutter, so I used a fork.   And, I'm a sweet tooth, so I doubled the amounts for the crumb crust.  I added cinnamon and a little sugar now and then as I was mashing with my fork.  I loaded the pie with these crumbles.   After about 40 min, I took it out (remember, I already cooked my apples earlier), and it was golden brown and crunchy on top and my crust was not overdone or dry since I didn't have to bake as long.

This recipe is excellent! I made a few slight adjustments, however, that made the pie even better. Use just under the amounts shown for oil and salt for the crust. Add 1 TBS of lemon juice and 2 TBS cornstarch to the filling mixture and cook in a saucepan until tender, then put in the  unbaked pie crust. Use 1/2 cup brown sugar, 1/4 cup sugar, and a few dashes of cinnamon, along with the other ingredients, to make the topping. You can also add some rolled oats and chopped pecans to the topping mixture for added variety. Enjoy!

This was the best apple pie I've ever made, and I've been baking for years. I needed to bake it longer than the recipe called for, but as soon as it was goldening up, I took it out. It got rave reviews from everyone at dinner. I found that the recipe was good just as it was. (Some previous submitters had recommended cutting sugar or butter). If you're extremely health conscious, I guess you could, but it's absolutely delicious as is. Also, those complaining that it was doughy only had to bake it longer. If you tap lightly on the crumb topping, and it leaves an indent, then it still needs to bake some. 
 An absolutely outstanding pie!

I served this for 4th of July and it was the hit of the party. My mother said it was the best apple pie she'd ever tasted - better than her grandmothers! I used small gala apples (6 were just enough) and sliced them pretty thin (about 3 cm. thick) - they were perfect for this pie. I took another reviewer's advice ("1 TB lemon juice and 2 TB cornstarch - then put it all in a saucepan to ensure the apples cook better. After about 20 on 'low' (and stirring frequently!)") and I added more flour and sugar to the crumbly topping which made it firmer, but just as buttery and delicious. The topping still wasn't "firm" when putting it on the pie (it "plops" on) but it bakes to perfection. I also added a few shakes of ground cloves to the apple mixture, as well as dashes of cinnamon, nutmeg and cloves to the top of the crumble before baking and it gave it a nice aroma and look to the top crumble crust. The bottom crust is TO DIE FOR. Take the time to make the crust yourself - it totally makes the pie. Enjoy!

Best apple pie I've ever eaten. I did, however, add more cinnamon and about 2 tablespoons of brown sugar. Also used a 9-inch store bought pie crust. 3 granny smith and 1 golden delicious apple chopped into small chunks were a plenty. For the topping, I pulsated the ingredients in a food processor. It came out almost like a sugar cookie dough. Then, rather than sprinkling it, I dropped gobs on top of the pie and pressed it all together with my fingers, forming a top "crust." I wrapped the edges with aluminum foil to prevent burning, and the end result was a gooey, caramel-like center with a crispy, flaky, sweet crust on top. It was awesome!

Great recipe! I'll admit I had my doubts about the crust but it turned out fine. Nice to be able to make a pie without getting flour all over.
I found that the pie was done after 45 minutes in the oven.
For those of you having trouble with the topping, keep in mind that the butter/margarine needs to be cold (out of the fridge, not at room temperature) in order to make crumbs.
Good luck! Can't go wrong with this one. Thanks Amy.

Excellent pie - sometimes there's nothing better than a really good apple for dessert especially if it's topped with vanilla ice cream!  The crust on this was pretty good, but in the future I think I'd use "Grandma's Secret Pie Crust" from this site because the dough was a bit difficult to work with.  After I got it into the pie plate, I chilled it for a bit.  For the apples, I used Granny Smith and a ton of them! I used 1/2 cup of white sugar and 1/4 brown sugar, upped the cinnamon to 1 tsp., added a couple splashes of lemon juice, 2 tsp. of vanilla, and 2 Tbsp. of cornstarch.  Tossed every thing with the thin sliced apples and placed it into the crust.  For the topping I used half white and half brown sugar and added 1/4 cup of quick cooking oats.  This definitely takes longer than 45 minutes to bake.  For me it took over an hour and I had to keep checking it.  So I guess it all depends on your oven.  It's definitely worth the wait though!

Fabulous! My chef husband was very impressed. I used Fugi apples, sliced very thinly, and also pre-cooked them with lemon juice, cornstarch, and the filling ingredients for about 10 minutes before spreading in crust. I also used a 10" pie pan, so I increased the crust and topping ingredients a bit. I added brown sugar, oats, and bit more flour to topping ingredients to get it more crumbly. Baked for about 43 minutes. Absolutely perfect!

I don't know what more I can say about this EXCELLENT apple pie! We were getting last minute company and I needed a quick dessert and I enlisted my younger daughter to whip this up for me. I had granny smith's on hand, so we used those and added a little bit more sugar to offset the tart flavor of the apple. We cheated and used a packaged pie crust and added cinnamon to the topping. Some other reviewers suggested cutting back on the butter, but I felt the amount for the topping was perfect. Thanks so much Amy for a really great pie recipe!

Okay Ladies; Listen up!!!  I've been getting recipes off this site for 8 years now and have not rated any even fabulous recipes until now.  This is the BEST apple pie you can ever make!!  This is how you fool proof this recipe:  (4 things besides the normal recipe instructions)  #1- use a store bought pie crust for the bottom but still do the topping the recipe calls for.   #2- slice your apples abou 1/8 inch slices. #3- use cold butter to make the topping and cut little chunks into the mixture as you stir.  Use ALL of this mixture on top of your pie!  #4- cook for 1 hour.   If you do this, you're pie will be restaurant perfect!!!  I have attempted to make many pie before this one; this was the best I've ever tasted!

Although you do need to bake this longer than the recipe calls (as much as half an hour), it's very very good. I've used the crust recipe for other pies and it's turned out great! This is definitely a keeper!

This pie is so good!  This morning I woke up thinking I'd like to make an apple pie (never done it before and I've never even really eaten good apple pie), so I came to allrecipes and this is the first recipe I clicked on!  I took it out of the oven about an hour and a half ago, and it's more than half gone already and it's just my mom and I!  I made some changes to the recipe:  First, I only used about three and a half granny smith apples.  I don't see how anyone could fit 6 apples in there?  Are Fuji apples a lot smaller?  In any case, the three and a half apples filled the pie crust so it was sticking an inch or so above the crust!  Also, I added a LOT more cinnamon!  The amount of cinnamon in the recipe is nowhere near enough for our tastes.  And I had less than half a cup of white sugar, so I used that with brown sugar to make 3/4 a cup in the apples.  It was really good that way!  And, all the sugar mixture was too much for the apples so I just added flour and brown sugar to the leftovers for the topping.  The topping wasn't like any other crumb topping I've seen.  Maybe too much butter, because mine went from big chunks of butter to a dough.  In any case, I just spread the topping over the pie with a spatula (added lots of cinnamon, of course).  It got all wonderful and crisp on the outside of the topping but nice and soft on the inside.  I think I'll stick to the changes I made in the future, and also I'm going to try baking the crust for a few minutes before putting

I made this recipe once before, it was a huge hit, everyone loved it!! I love it coz it's quick & easy, and of course delicious! It was a bit too sweet for me though, I guess it was because I used Fuji apples and they're already sweet.
I am baking my second apple pie now as I am typing this review, I decreased the amount of sugar and added more cinnamon n nutmeg into it. 

Thanks for a great recipe!

For the topping, try 1 cup of flour.  I have used the half, half, whole recipe for crumb topping for years (from my mom and her mom before her).  For any crumb topping, use one part sugar, one part butter and 2 parts flour.  Add whatever spices you like.

I am not an apple pie fan, but this is one of my most favorite pies ever!  I have made this same recipe for several years.  The crust really is this easy and good, too.  I prefer to dice instead of slice my apples; this makes the slices easier to cut.  I've never had to precook the apples, either.  Nor  does my crust burn.  All in all, this is a perfect apple pie!

The recipe was really easy to make! It is my first time baking an apple pie. I had a dinner party last night and baked one. The pie was the talk of the night! I have to give all credit to this recipe. A friend who claimed not to like fruit pies was found enjoying a huge slice of pie!! I was so delighted that everyone enjoyed the pie. THanks Amy for your contribution! 
I followed the advice of the other fellow bakers and baked the pie for 1 and a half hours instead. For the crust, I did not use all the 1/2 cup of butter, in fact i think 1/4 was enough (i used about 50g). For those who do not like the pie to be too sweet, i suggest to add lesser sugar, i used about 1 desert spoon of sugar for one apple. It also helps to taste the apples before adding the sugar.

Yum! I agree with others on cooking the apples for 20 minutes or so on the stove top before hand with all of the filling ingredients plus 1 tbsp lemon juice.   The crust is not crumbly as written. Those who suggested adding oats, pecans, extra sugar and flour had the right idea, I will be doing that next time!   It was delicious despite!

Soooo good.  My husband and I ate a piece of this every night for three nights in a row, with butter pecan ice cream on the side.  I was sad when it was gone.  lol.  The only downside is that I missed the "butter" flavor in the crust and could kind of taste the veg. oil.  But, I really liked being able to do a pie with a homemade crust without making a flour-y mess!

Flavor was okay, but I really did'n't care for the crust at all. I found it to have too much oil and fat in the whole pie. I prefer a basic crust, not so greasy feeling.

This is a wonderful recipe, pie and crust!  I would recommend not fluting the crust, as it is very flaky.  Just use a fork to press down the edges.  My two daughters and I made this with many others and found this to be the best tasting crust.  My husband loved it!

Excellent PIE!!  Could not hand out the recipe fast enough.  This was my first attempt at making apple pie, and I won't be looking any further for a recipe; this is the one and only I will have!

I have a Fuji apple tree and this is a wonderful pie using these apples. Mine had to bake extra though. Loved the pat a pie crust, it made it so simple too! Delicious flavor! It is a keeper!

Amazing recipe! Loved my apple pie! I bought frozen crusts from the store. I would agree to add less water and more cinnamon/vanilla extract in the mixture. I used a pie bird and my crust didn't collapse but haven't tried to make it without it - I would have just added a tad bit of the sugar mixture to the apples before hand as others have suggested. Good recipe overall and very easy to make!

I'd give it 5 stars if I didn't make a few changes. I followed what another reviewer said and added the lemon juice and cornstarch. I LOVE THE CRUST! :) Thanks a million for making pie baking no longer scary!

This was delicious and the crust is SO easy. If you want to use a store bought crust for this one--don't--this crust recipe takes less than five minutes to mix and press into the pie pan--just be patient and press it until it's spread out evenly and up onto the edge of your pie pan. I did use granny smiths--leaving the sugar as written--b/c that's what I had! And I added a bit to the topping--which is GREAT as written-- but for personal preferences I added chopped pecans and a touch of cinnamon. I was skeptical of a crumb topping w/o brown sugar, but this recipe is good as is. Like any pie, I do recommend covering the crust edges w/ a pie shield or foil, taking it the protection off for the last few minutes of baking, if necessary. My apples weren't ready after 45 minutes, so, I covered the whole pie loosely with foil for another 10 minutes or so and the apple juices began to run down the side of the pie tin beautifully! :)  Hands down, this is the best crumb top pie I've made. Now I have to be really motivated to bother making my double crust pie as it entails a rolling pin!!!

This is a yummy, quick and easy apple pie. I liked that I didn't have to roll the crust out. Just pressing it into the bottom of the pan gives it a real rustic feel too. It's also nice if you don't like so much crust. The crumble topping was quite nice for a change. I did add a little cinnamon to the crumble mixture. I used 7 Granny Smith apples (it was heaping). I also added more cinnamon, nutmeg and some cloves to enhance the flavor a little bit. Our 24 year old son was visiting and nearly ate half of that pie. I will definitely make this again. Thanks for making my life just a little bit easier.

Wow.  I really didn't think that a press-in-pan crust would turn out so delicious. The pie was very easy to put together and so yummy.  Can't wait to make it again!

the pie is easy to make but needs some improvement.    One person mentioned the use of flavored instant oatmeal for the topping, good idea, but use half the amount of butter and it becomes crumbly.  Also lemon juice for the filling helps its flavor and holds things together.

actually if you wanna know the truth i just did the topping from this recipie and let me tell you it did not work the topping was not crumbly it was really mushy so i tryed to spread it on like a crust and it melted in with the filling i had ready made filling but when it was done the taste was actually good but not what i expectedwhat i did cause everyone said it was to buttery and sweet so i did 1/3 cups of everything instead of 1/2 so it was probably my fault but i am a new baker.

I'm an apple pie fanatic, and this recipe is a good one. The crust is very easy, too. Granny Smith apples are a good substitute for Fuji.

I made this pie today while stranded at home during Hurricane Sandy, LOL. Followed it almost exactly with a few alterations: I added a little bottled lemon juice to the apples and tossed as I cut them up into chunks to keep them from browning (about 1/2 teaspoon for each apple); I added about 1/8 cup more of white sugar to the apples to account for the tartness of the lemon juice; Added about 2 tablespoons of brown sugar as well as a dash of cinnamon & nutmeg to the topping. I used 6 large apples: I had Rome, Gala, and maybe a Courtland in the frig. I don't think the type of apple matters as long as you don't have all mushy apples. Those 6 large apples make a lot when cut up so the pie was heaping. I followed other tips and covered the pie with a loose foil tent after 45-50 mins of cooking. Total cook time was about 1 hr, 15 mins. depending on how brown you like it. CLEANUP TIP! Line the cookie sheet with foil before putting the pie on top b/c it will boil over just a little bit. I don't know why people had problems with gooey pies. Mine had a perfectly golden crunchy top and the shortbready bottom crust was perfect! Apples were cooked through too. No need to cook on stove first.

Delicious! My husband says this is the best apple pie ever! For the topping, I did follow the suggestion of another review and used a 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1/4 cup sugar, with a few dashes of cinnamon, with the other ingredients for the topping (just a personal preference on the brown sugar).

I am not so good with the pastry-like doughs and the pie making skills.  Nope.  Me, I'm a cookie/muffin girl.  So I cheated and used a frozen 9" crust.  But the rest of the recipe was perfect.  The only change I made was using 1/2 cup brown sugar (instead of 3/4 white) on the apples + 1 tbsp cornstarch, because I was using sweet juicy Fujis and didn't want the pie too sicky-sweet or runny.  My tween just said it was "totally awesome" (dude).  Bonus: it was totally easy, even for somebody like me, who doesn't do pie.  This is a keeper for us.  I'd love to try this with pears, too.  Thanks for the great recipe!

This is a good, rich apple pie. I suggest dicing the apples instead of slicing - smaller pieces would let the apple cook better.

I didn't even get to the apple pie part bc the crust was awful, just crumbled and I followed it to a T and have baked many pies....I have a diff crust recipe I always use with no problems, I have no clue how this did not turn out.

This was delicious except I felt like the crust was bland and it may be that I did something wrong but it wasnt as crispy/firm as I wanted. I also over worked the crumblings on top but it still cam out great. Next time I wont over work the top of the crust and may try a different crust recipe for the bottom. I also added a little more brown sugar to everything!

This was my first time ever baking an apple pie. This recipe was very easy and came out delicious! I had a problem with the crumbly topping not being so crumbly, the butter in it made it spread and melt a little, although it didn't affect how good it tasted! Perhaps I should use unsalted butter next time, my mother suggested that that would probably help fix that problem.

My boyfriend, Armando really liked this recipe.  I followed the recipe, with some spice additions, and took some suggestions as to cook the apples for a while.  My boyfriend stated that he thought the apples were a little overcooked. The only change that I made was to add 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon, 1/8 teaspoon of nutmeg and a pinch of allspice to the crust.  So to summarize, next time I will only cook it for 15 minutes and try again.  The crust recipe was super easy to make compared to a rolled crust.  I will use it again to make pumpkin pie later this month.

I did what others suggested and added the 1 Tbsp of lemon juice and 2 Tbsp cornstarch to the rest of the filling ingredients and cooked the apples until they were soft. I also added the 1/4 C sugar and 1/2 C brown sugar and rolled oats to the topping. I used a Mrs. Smith's deep dish frozen pie crust. It turned out fabulous. It even looked pretty. My husband said it was the best apple pie he had ever eaten! This will definitely stay on our short list of special desserts!

initially i thought i was making apple pie - not apple soup.  the filling was way to watery, and the "crumbling" topping tasted like raw dough.  my father kept asking me if the pie was still raw.  the best part was the crust only because i bought an easy to prepare betty crocker crust. will i ever make it again? when pigs fly.. and when that happens, even the pigs wouldn't eat it. what a waste of perfectly good apples.

While it was nice not to have to roll out a homemade crust, it was a little shortbread-like and salty.  The filling tasted great, but the topping definately had too much butter and came out too crispy.

This was a great and easy recipe. I must admit that I had to buy a frozen pie crust and I didn't have nutmeg as I thought. It still came out great. This was my first apple pie, and I'm very proud of it. :-)

Like others, I did have my doubts about the pie crust in the beginning.  Don't expect it replace traditional pie crust, however, it works well with this recipe.  The only change I made was to reduce the cinnamon and increase the nutmeg.  I used Corland apples, fresh from the tree.  My wife gave this a big thumbs up but I found it a little on the rich side, particularily the topping.  This would be a great recipe made with a traditional double pie crust.  Thanks Amy for a great dessert.  Anyone looking for an apple pie recipe should try this one.

It was one of the few times I made a pie and it turned out great. "All American" is really the adjective that describes it. It tasted and looked like one of the pies that one can purchase in stores and fast-food places, Only it was better because it was home-made, and if one wishes to cut some calories, one can cut out the butter and oil content. I put half less of butter and oil, a bit less flour, and some more milk. I also used olive oil because vegetable oil was aparently missing in my home. As for spices I added some allspice in addition to cinnamon. I loved the crunchy shell and crust and the light brown look of the pie.

Great recipe! Easy and tastes great! For the topping, though, I mixed the dry ingreadiance together then cut the butter into it. I have made several of these pies, and they all have come out perfect!

This recipie is AMAZING! I make it for every family event and people are clawing over each other to get it! I took the suggestions of some other reviewers and added oats to the topping and I also added oats to the filling as well. I slice the apples nice and thin on my nandy dandy kitchen slicer (pampered chef!) and it comes out great!  The crumble topping is what really makes this pie so good! I also cook the pie filling over the stove until the apples are soft and then put the whole thing in the oven. So good!

I have been baking this pie for years! I always get rave reviews; it's the best apple pie I've ever tasted. All I do differently is: pile on more apples, and a bit more of the cinnamon & nutmeg. I love this easy crust: I hate rolling out crust! Thank you for such a perfect recipe!

I followed the recipe and the reviews. As for the crust I cut down the butter and sugar to around 1/3 of a cup, it still melted down, covering the entire pie and it was STILL too butterry and sugary. The botton crust was also way toooo oily as I've followed the recipe to a T! people beware!

This review is for the pie only. I used the Butter Flaky Crust recipe from this site. Very good. Thought this pie was better than most that I've had made with brown sugar. I seriously am rethinking that brown sugar isn't always where it's at for pies! I added two tbsp. of fresh lemon juice to the filling before I baked it, I'm glad I did otherwise it really would have been too sweet. When I make this again, I would cut back on the flour in the filling. I royally screwed up the topping but it was tasty so it really didn't matter. NOTE: I used granny smith's because that was all I had.

This is the real thing, folks.  Made it according to directios and it came out just right.  I actually used too many apples (granny smith) so I had to cook it a bit longer.  Was very concerned about the crust when I made it but it turned out wonderfully.  Nothing wrong with this recipe!

Unfortunately I didn't have a pie pan, so I just layered the ingredients...crust-apple mixture-topping...into one of my baking dishes. I took one's advice and doubled the topping mixture to make it extra thick and crumbly. It turned out beautifully! I served it with French Vanilla ice cream to make it even more decadent. It was a huge hit at the Thanksgiving table. Thanks!

Was this recipe easy? YES! I followed it to a T. Was it tasty? Mostly. Was it what I expected? Not a bit. The filling was dry after baking- just cooked apples and spices, inside an odd, goopy, slightly salty crust that never crisped-up like a pie crust. Not bad, really, just not great.

I made this for my sister-in-law's birthday becasue she doesn't like cake.  It was delicious!  I used 3 granny smith and 2 red delicious apples.  Not too sweet.  Also used brown sugar on the crumb topping instead of white.  Also added a handful of oats and sprinkle of cinnamon to the topping.  Will definitely make again!

I've made this twice now.  It's likely the easiest pie to make because there's no rolling out and fretting about the perfect pastry.  Good basic recipe for when you're not inclined to take the prep time for making dough from scratch.   What bugs me though is that the bake time is WAY, WAY off.  Try 65 to 75 minutes if you want your pie actually cooked, and a lightly browned crumb crust.

I was scared going into to this because I've messed up many a crust in my day. But this is a fool proof crust. I chose to double the crust recipe because I like a thick bottom crust and more crust to come up the side of the pan and create the wedges. Once all the ingridients are laid out the crust is together and ready for the pie pan in less than three minutes. The filling is perfect, I didn't change a thing. DELICIOUS!

Absolutely yummy! Followed advice of others: thinly sliced the apples (used 4 fuji and 2 granny smith), cooked apples for 20 minutes on stove, also added 1 TBS fresh lemon, 2 TBS cornstarch and other ingredients. Followed rest of directions exactly except added a little bit of ground cloves to apple mix and some quick oats to the topping. Best apple pie!

This pie was absolutely amazing!  Nice, easy and fairly quick, it's perfect for me as a University student to make when I'm taking a break from studying.  It turned out so delicious!  I was a little worried about the look of the crumble on top, so I turned the oven onto broil for two minutes just to give it a nice browning.  I also found that there was no way I could fit 6 apples into the pie, and only ended up using 3, but it was still wonderful.  My roommates and floormates loved it too :)

The recipe for the 'No-Roll Pie Crust" is one that I've used for years.  It is super light and flaky because of all the oil that's used (I think it was originally a Mazola recipe, printed in some magazine or the other.)

Anyway, try it with any one-crust pie that you choose to make (pumpkin, sweet potato, etc.)  It's always a hit!

The apple filling for this pie sounds great; I may try it on the Fourth!

I scaled this recipe to feed 12, and made it in a 9x13 glass pan for a potluck. It turned out perfectly and got rave reviews. I even made copies of this recipe for friends who asked for it. This pie recipe is now a standard in our home and turns out perfectly every time.

I have had so many compliments on this pie - it helps to use 2 or 3 different kinds of apples, they balance out tartness and sweetness. Its requested at all sorts of get-togethers now!

My 5-yr-old son helped me to make this pie on the weekend. We did enjoy it, however it's not the best I've ever tasted. It seemed quite regular to me. I had the same problem as a few of the other reviewers with the topping being a big sloppy mess, even after adding more flour + sugar to try and "crumble" it. In the end I had no choice but to spread the mixture across the top and bake it that way, which was fine but not really what was expected. I increased the cinnamon and also added a small amount of brown sugar to the filling, which was lovely. I do think this is just a nice pie, but not right up there with my favourites, in my taste.

Absolutely fantastic!  I was concerned when i made the crust that it was going to be dry, but it actually came out flaky and buttery tasting (I greased my pie pan with butter!)  Everyone loved this pie and I kept hearing "This is the best pie I have ever had!"  Thank you!

This is my first attempt at making apple pie, and it turned out delicious!  I tried to cut down on some of the fat that was called for, and it didn't really change the taste, which I'm really happy with.  I also sliced the apples really thin and followed someone else's directions to cook them in lemon juice and cornstarch first.  That really helped make sure the apples were nice and soft by the time the pie finished baking.  The pie crust was also a nice surprise, very good and so simple to make!  This recipe is definitely a keeper!

Very good and simple! I used a premade crust which cut down on the wait time. I love Fuji apples and they worked great.

This pie has made me famous around here!!!! I would highly recommend it! I have baked this pie more times than I can count! I even have to make TWO when I bake them for potlucks at my husbands work! Just a tip, for those whose apples seem "raw"...try slicing them very thin. They come out sooo delicious as they bake through nice and evenly. I also use an "all spice" in addition to the other spices....and try using the spices in the CRUST as well!!! You too can be famous for your PIE!!!!!

I've made this pie 2x and we love it!!! It is a little sweet, but remember, you are what you eat.  If you don't like it that way, add less sugar to it, like any other recipe you use, fix it the way you like it.  One thing I noticed was that my filling the first time was too much, so it was falling apart, so I adjusted it to meet my needs the 2nd time, and it was PERFECT!! I suggest making this recipe, it's so good, and if done right, you'll have people begging you for more!!

This is a super-easy & great tasting pie recipe.  I used 5 Fuji apples, which still made the pie overflow a bit.  I also found that the top was more like dough & not crumbly.  But I think that actually adds to the taste & texture of the pie.  Just don't expect to have a crumbly topping.  My 2 1/2 year old enjoyed rolling the topping into little balls & putting them on top.  It was great!  The pie was for my Dad's b-day & he likes his apple pies almost like applesauce, so I baked it 20 minutes longer & then left it in the oven another 15 minutes after I turned it off.  The crust never burned, which is amazing! Thank you.

I just made a GREAT apple pie!  Very easy recipe that produced a very traditional, bakery quality apple pie.

I used a 27 cm pyrex pie plate (10.63 inches)...so the pie was little thinner than it would have been with a 9" pie plate...but it worked perfectly.  I had just enough bottom crust to go up the side of the plate.

This is THEE best apple pie, and so easy to make.  I make this all the time now b/c I constantly get requests for it.  I've been told by many people that my apple pie is the best they've ever tasted (and I cheat and buy the frozen pie crust...shhh!).  I mix up the types of apples I use each time, and cut the apple pieces smaller than the usual apple pieces and it makes the filling even gooier and more delicious.  Thank you SO much Amy!!

I just made this pie this morning and it is THE best apple pie I've ever tasted.  I love the crumbled topping better than a pastry crust.  I used 1/4 cup of butter instead of the 1/2 cup it called for and the butter was very cold.  It took a little elbow grease to work the butter into the flour and sugar mixture but it did end up being crumbly like it was supposed to and it came out perfect!  Make sure the butter is cold and try 1/4 cup instead of 1/2 cup.  I also used a frozen pie shell for the bottom crust.  It is WONDERFUL!!!  I bet the topping will be great on peach pies, blackberry pies, cherry pies...etc.

WONDERFUL!!!
This was my first apple pie and crust.I was very excited when it came out perfect and more excited when people actually enjoyed it.
I was very proud telling people that it was a homemade pie and crust.I just left out the part about how easy it was to make.Had hubby thinking I was cooking all day so I could go out for dinner.Thanks Amy for sharing.

I really enjoyed this recipe. It was on the simple scale. I did however add some Quick Oats to the topping. When I did the topping it was not crumbly. I thought it was my mistake. Adding the quick oats helped. I also had to bake about a half and hour more than the recipe called for, but it turned out very well. I used tart apples so it wasnt so sweet. Excellent job Amy! It sorta turned out like an apple crisp pie!

Hi, welcome to MacDonalds, can I take your order?  Visions of 10 MacDonald's Apple Pies and a blender haunted me as I ate this doughball of a pie.  Evidently some people rank MacDonalds as fine cuisine..... We love to see you smile.

This recipe showed great promise in the beginning, but when I tasted some of it I thought it was rather dry. I used Granny Smith apples, I don't know if that made a difference.  But I didn't care much for this recipe, contrary to all the positive reviews.

I used gala apples and the pie turned out PERFECT!  Compared to ALL other apples pies I've tasted I would say it's number one.  I'm not looking for another recipe!  Even my son, who doesn't like pie crust, didn't leave any of his pie behind!!

This was my first attempt at an apple pie.  I only used 3 apples (all I had) and added extra cinnamon because I didn't have the nutmeg. I can't believe how easy this recipe was!   It turned out WONDERFUL!!

I was very wary of the top crust, it was crumbly when I put it on but soon in the oven it formed one big almost cake-like crust.  Which tasted good but I think it overwhelmed the apples a little. I was looking for more of a crumble topping.  Also thought the filling was too spicy - I would definitely omit the nutmeg if I made this again. The only reason I would make this again is because I did get a lot of compliments.

This recipe is wonderful! I absolutely loved the crust! I did make one change: I used Splenda instead of sugar. (Personal Preference) Still turned out sweet and golden brown. I will definitely be making this again! Thanks!

This is my first apple pie and it came out absolutely delicious!  My only problem is the the "crumbly" topping came out gooey!  I was really looking forward to that crumbly topping, so next time I'll double the dry ingrediants and stick with the 1/2 cup butter.  If anyone has other suggestions, please let me know!

I have never done a review so I thought I would start with this one.  I made this pie becasue I was looking for a pie that my food allergic son could have as well.  I have made it both ways and love it both.  I subsitute anything dairy for soy, and when baked you can not tell the difference.  Great recipe, it is the only apple pie I bake now.

This did not work for me at all! The filling was thin and juicy and the topping was not crumbly.  The crust was nothing special either. I'm not sure what happened.

This was the best apple pie I have ever made.  Super great flavor, just the right amount of spices.  We will definately make this one again (and again, and again).  My oven temp is correct and I did have to cook this about 10 to 15 minutes longer and increase my oven temp to get the top to brown nicely though.

I too was skeptical on the crust, but It turned out great!! This was my first attempt at apple pie and It was a success! I added nutmeg and will probably add more cinnamon next time.

It's the first time I make an apple pie and it turned out so great. I added some orange zest and the juice of 1 orange in the apple filling mixture.  it will look like too much liquid but I add a little more flour. I used Granny Smith and Fuji apples.

This was really good, and just what I was looking for.  We had the leftovers for breakfast the next morning, and it was just as good the day after.  I used a different crust, though, the butter flaky crust recipe as suggested by another user, which was perfect.  I let the pie bake uncovered for the first 35 minutes, then covered with foil for the last 10 so the crust and topping wouldn't burn.    This was wonderful and I'll be making it again when my family wants apple pie.

Excellent recipe. However, I found that the nutmeg was way too strong. Next time I will put just a sprinkle of nutmeg in or I might eliminate it altogether. I also found that adding the topping about 20 minutes into baking kept things from overflowing and burning.

Lovely pie.  I just inhaled a piece just now.  I don't like my desserts too sweet and rich, so this recipe is very forgiving if you want to make it to suit your taste.  I drastically cut down the sugar and butter and I can't tell the difference.  I ran out of milk, so I used rice milk for the crust.  Very flaky!  As for the filling, I used 7 small gala apples, only 1/3 cup packed brown sugar, 1 tbsp cornstarch, 3 Tbsp flour and only 1/2 tsp cinnamon.  I also used only half the amount of topping and used brown sugar instead of white.  I figure that if it wasn't sweet enough, I could always add ice cream and drizzle some maple syrup on top when serving. :)

With the crust not having to be rolled out and the top being a crumble, this was the fastest apple pie I've ever made.  Also very good flavor with a nice flaky crust.

This is the first apple pie I ever made and it definitely won't be the last time I make it.  Recipe was easy and it tastes excellent...really the best apple pie I've ever had!  I also added some cinnamon to the topping.

This is the first apple pie I've made from scratch. Because my oven cooks hot (I have a small countertop oven - not a toaster oven - and it's hard to control the temperature, as it just has a "pie" setting), I precooked the filling on the stovetop to ensure it would be fully cooked without risking burning the crust. I used to make pie crusts for a friend's business many years ago, and the consistency of the dough seemed strange to me, too oily. I couldn't crimp the edges. Once cooked, it seemed all right, but I think I will make the dough from a different recipe from now on. The crumbles also didn't "crumble" - I ended up with a large mass that I had to tear into little pieces to cover the pie, which melted together and got crunchy as it cooked. Perhaps it would have worked better with less butter. The end product was very delicious, the filling came out perfect. I just think the dough and crumbles need some tweaking. I do think you could cut out some butter/oil and sugar and still have a delicious pie. Fuji apples are very sweet on their own. I only used 5 apples, and they barely fit in the pie, 6 would have been too many.

Great  pie.  It was easy to make.  I used chilled butter in my crust and cream where the recipe called for milk.  I wish I would have read the review saying to add rolled oats and pecans to the topping.  I imagine  that would be quite tasty.  My husband is anxious for me to make this apple pie again.

The proportions for the topping are waaaay off! Too much butter. Also, the crust completely turned to mush. Won't be making this again.

Terrific recipe. It got raves at Thanksgiving, even when I accidentally oversalted the crust!

This is by far the best apple pie recipe I have ever made.  I used a premade crust to save time and it takes less than 15 minutes to put together - even after peeling and slicing the apples.  I use a mandoline or V-slicer to slice the apples really thin - this ensures that the apples are cooked all the way through.  I don't change the recipe in any other way except to use whatever apples I have on hand. Thank you Amy!

Brought this to Christmas last year... it was gone in seconds with requests to bring it again this year.  The key to a good apple pie is used older apples..not fresh juicy ones...Learned that lesson the hard way :)

My neighbor brought over a bushel of apples from his backyard tree.  After two hours peeling and slicing I found this recipe.  Followed others suggestions.  Used cornstarch and lemon in the filling mix and cooked on low for about 20 minutes.  Used half cup brown sugar for the topping.  Refrigerator cold butter is a must to get the pea sized crumbles you want.  Placed under broiler for about 5 minutes to crisp up the crumbles slightly more.  This pie is awesome.  Next time I'll make my own pie crust following the recipe.  I cheated this time and used store bought.

Everyone loved it! I did use half the salt in the crust and it tasted just fine. It was a little to sweet for me but vanilla ice cream helped with that. Make sure your butter comes right from the fridge and I found it easier to cut it up, then you should have no problem with the crust. Thanks for the recipe!

very yummy...but it was a bit too sweet. i don't know if it's because i used empire apples instead or if the filling had too much sugar. and there was way too much crumb topping. i used some of the suggestions and added some cinnamon and nutmeg.

One word can describe this pie--awesome!  I did cheat and use store bought crust though.  I did only make one change to the topping.  I used 1/4 cup white sugar and 1/4 cup brown sugar.  Thanks for sharing your recipe with us!!

So VERY good, the crust takes no time and so much better than store bought. I would maybe use a little less salt for next time. I made this exactly as the recipe suggested. (maybe a little more cinnamon) I highly recommend this recipe!

Awesome!  Definitely put a cookie sheet under the pie to catch drippings.  However do not put it directly under the pie (as I did) and instead put it on the next oven rack down.  I had to keep mine in the oven a lot longer for this mistake!  But in the end it was absolutely delicious with rave reviews from my family!

I'm not sure what I did wrong but the apples were swimming in melted butter and juice. The taste of the pie was fabulous- no problems there- just not sure I could serve this to company. To the best of my knowledge I followed the instructions but something went wrong.

This recipe is awesome! The pie is beautiful and the taste is fabulous! The only thing I haven't been able to master is how to get the liquid out of it after it's done because it is very runny. This was our first attempt ever at a homemade pie. I never realized it was so easy! I will definitely make this again.

My brother had been bugging me to bake him an apple pie so I decided to try this recipe. He and my boyfriend loved it! The entire pie was gone between the two of them within 24 hours. I made a couple small substitutions. I added 1/4 cup of brown sugar to the topping mixture and added a little extra oil and a full tablespoon of sugar to the crust. Oh, and subbed one tablespoon of flour in the filling to one tablespoon of corn starch so that it would be a little thicker. ALso, I used granny smith apples since that is what I had. All minor changes so I am sure the pie is great no matter if you change things or follow the recipe completely. Yum!

I really enjoyed making and eating this pie and I'm not really a huge fan of apple pie.  Couldn't be easier to make (yes, I used a frozen crust, too).  My only criticism is that it was a little sweet for our taste (and I cut back a little on the sugar from the recipe) but we don't really like things overly sweet.  My kids even liked it and they've never liked fruit pie and didn't want to try it.  I will definitely make again- probably very soon!

It turned out really well. The amount of cinnamon and nutmeg was just right and perfectly complimented the apple pie. The top and crust was just right; not to soft, yet not too hard. Personally, I had used a mixture of the fuji apple and Granny Smith's Apple. It was awesome. However, I would recommend using unsalted butter, because in my opinion, the top ended up a little too salty. Nevertheless, still OK. Must Try.

Grandma bought me a case of apples from beautiful Washington State. What to do with some many apples.This is my first pie ever. I am afraid of pies due to the crust. The crust is a make or break when it comes to pies. This was so easy for a first timer like myself! I followed the directions as they are written and it turned out beautifully and delicious!

I really like this recipe! The bottom crust is so easy to make since you pat it right into the pie pan (no need to roll the dough out). The top crust reminds me of the yummy bits of crumb topping on a coffee cake-- tastier than a normal crust. The apples are seasoned just right.  I've tried some of the other apple pie recipes on this site (Grandma Ople's being the most recent), but I always come back to this one!!

My apple pie is still in the oven, though I've already had a slice. I found that after 50 mins of baking the tops are perfect but the juice is runny & quite liquid so I put it back for another 15 mins. let's see what happens. Overall, I like the recipe cause it's easy and delicious. Will make it again with the cornstarch and reduced butter for the topping. thanks Amy.

Really tasty. Quite easy to make and I was quite skeptic since I was making an apple pie for the first time. But it was quite easy and has come out quite tasty. Like someone else said 6 apples are way too much ( I did not use fuji apples) I needed just 3 apples and they were quite enough. I did not have any problem with the baking time. Got done in 45 mts. I found it very sweet though, would probably reduce the sugar next time. Thanks

Great recipe. It does not take forever and it turns out great. I used granny smith apples, I like sour. I made it a few days ago for our Thanksgiving dinner and everyone loved it. They could not believe that there was no Crisco used.

I loved this recipe,  it was so easy, it cooked for an hour until the inside was soft, it tasted really good but a bit to sweet, next time i will reduce the sugar on the apples.

I made this pie when my best friend said she'd like my husband and I to join them for a family cookout celebrating their first wedding anniversary.  She said she was craving an apple pie--and so was my husband, who has decided he will willingly buy apples any time he wants this pie in the house!  The pie was a hit!  I only had 4 large red delicious apples in the house and had more than plenty to make this pie.  I plan to attempt this recipe again soon using Splenda to see how it tastes.

For the past two years this has been the only apple pie recipe I will make and I made a lot of apple pies. I live in an area of the country that has many apple orchards and of course I love to pick apples. I have always used honey crisp apples in this recipe! They are the best! The only thing I change about this recipe is that I bake the pie for a full hour instead of the 45 minutes. I found that the 45 minutes leaves it runny.

I can't figure out how to do this kind of topping! When I made it, it was so greasy, butter everywhere and the top never seems to get done no matter how long or what temperature I cook it at.

I was a bit sceptical about the filling and topping containing only white sugar (I think brown sugar tastes so good in and on an apple pie). The pie cooked beautiful, though, and I became impatient tasting it. I let the pie cool to room temperature and, as I usually do, I took the pie out of the pan... and then it all messed up: the pie fell apart from every sides... I was so disappointed. When I tasted it, though, it was absolutely wonderful. So, don't worry about the pie containing only white sugar, and absolutely let the pie in the pan it cooked in. This pie a real keeper and takes only minutes to prepare (except for peeling, coring and slicing apples!).

I must admit I don't like making pie crust so I stick to those folded pie crusts (Pillsbury makes the best!) as opposed to the dry freezer crusts in the tins. Ergo, I cannot rate the crust. However, it's the filling that really counts to me and this one is delicious! Although I used 4 Red Rome apples (no Fuji on hand), the spices captured the essense of the apples beautifully. The topping was wonderful as I'm not a huge fan of top-crusted pies and held in the juices perfectly. The pie came out sweet--but not sickeningly sweet--and juicy and slightly crispy on top.  Actually, this recipe goes very well with my lazy pie crust! Highly recommended. Since the filling and topping are so delicious, I may even try the crust sometime when I'm feeling especially ambitious...

Simple and quick to prepare. Topping was not crumbly. Apples had a flour taste. Took much longer to cook. Didn't care for the crust. Too oily.

This pie was absolutely wonderful!! Much better than a supermarket bakery or frozen pie, and the crust was superb.  I, too, decreased the sugar added to the apples, sprinkled the topping with sugar and cinnamon, and allowed it to bake about 20 minutes longer than the recipe called for.  The taste was great!! Will be using this recipe over and over...

This pie didn't turn out well for me at all....the apples were still half raw, even after leaving it in the oven for an extra 10 minutes.  The top crust, which was supposed to be a crumb crust, was gooey and globby, and the bottom crust was doughy.  I took this to a church picnic, and only one piece got eaten....it didn't even look appetizing.  I won't be making this one again.  Sorry.

I decided to try this recipe beforehand for 4th of July day.  It was sooooo good.  I never baked pie before and it turned out to be just perfect.  My husband kept sniffing at the pie after it was done the whole time I was cooking dinner.  It was just perfect.  I used Betty Crocker's ready-to-mix crust and it turned out to be great.  Fuji apples were just excellent for this recipe.  Thank you so much.  Now I can call myself a true American!

This was my very first apple pie and everyone loved it!! I cheated & used a frozen deep-dish pie crust. 4 large Granny Smith apples were plenty! My topping ended up doughy instead of crumbly, but I just spread it on with a spatula & it was perfect that way! Overall, a very easy pie to make, especially for first-timers, and it got rave reviews...I'll definitely be making this again!

I thought this recipe was great.  I used less sugar for the apple filling, only 4 apples, and 1/4 c. butter instead of 1/2 like some other reviewers.  It came out and tasted wonderful.

I have never made apple pie before, and this one was pretty easy!  I used Gala apples, which turned out great, but six was way too many.  I ended up using about four.  The crust/dough was a bit crumbly, but I think it would have helped to have just a little more of it.  I  will definitely make this again!

Absolutely delicious!!!  Converted my fruit hating husband!!  Did tinker with it a little, only mixing 1/4cup of butter for topping.  Will tinker further next time - reduce the salt in the crust, and maybe add oats to the topping.  But will definately make again!

Fabulous, fabulous, fabulous!!  Hands down, this recipe is the best and easiest to make.  I did cheat a little though...I used the frozen pie crusts instead of making my own, simply because I happened to have some in my fridge.  If using the frozen pie crusts, be sure to add slits on top to let the steam out.  I sprinkled a mixture of about 1 tsp of sugar and 1/8 tsp of cinnamon on top of the crust before baking and it came out great (not to mention it looks nice).  I also used about 8 Granny Smith apples (6 didn't seem like enough for my pie since I was using a deep dish frozen pie crust).  In any event, I highly recommend to this recipe to anyone looking to make a delicious and quick apple pie.

The first apple pie I've ever made, and it was so easy!  OK, I have to admit that my husband peeled, cored and sliced the apples... :)
It actually made two shallow 9" pies, by the way.

This recipe creates a real dilemma.  As written, it's quite lacking.  With many adjustments, it's absolutely delicious.  I don't write many reviews, but inexperienced cooks and bakers may be swept away by the hundreds of stars and think they've got a sure thing in the making.  Not exactly!  Let's start with the crust - an oily, crumbly mixture that needed to rest at least 15 minutes and required three rollings before it was fit to line a regular pie plate, and there was barely enough dough to climb the sides of the plate. No chance of a nice, crimped edge.  Notice many of the 4 and 5 star reviews used a store-bought, pre-made frozen crust.  What's the point? How can you rate this pie recipe without having actually tried it?  The filling is fine.  It's pretty hard to screw up apples tossed in cinnamon and sugar.  The topping is also "off".  About 1/2 cup off on the flour.  I needed twice as much flour as called for in order to produce a real crumb topping.  As written, you end up with paste, not crumb.  With all this said, and all my adjustments after 45 years of baking, the pie I made - which was a rather substantial departure from this recipe as written - was truly delicious.  If you've got extra time and ingredients and want to experiment, try this.  But this is not a foolproof, quick or easy recipe for apple pie.  First timers should steer clear!
Amy, thank you for a good basic blueprint.

Nice pie. I cooked it for 1 1/2 hours though. I started it in a 375 degree oven then dropped it to 350 for the remaining 45 minutes. I started with raw apples. The crust did not get burnt.

Delicious! The crust was very easy and tasted great, even with my olive oil for veggi oil substitution. The crumble on top was the perfect consistancy. The apples I used were monsters, so I only needed five instead of all six the recipe called for. A simple yet flavorful pie.

I decided to use Granny Smiths, and I know they tend to be a little more sour than other varieties, but the ones I get are not too sour. The crust came out beautiful/not soggy at all (I didn't know what to expect not ever having to NOT prebake the crust).

This is the best apple pie I have ever made. It was so good that no one even touched the pumpkin pie last night. I used slightly more apples, and mounded them up. They cooked down nicely. i pressed the topping to all sides to hold it on, and cooked it for probably an extra 20 minutes to get the top to start to brown. Overall BEST Apple Pie EVER!!!  Easy and amazing!

REALLY good.  I liked that the crust was made with oil and not shortening.  The apple filling was simple yet delicious and the pie tasted even better with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.  Just to note I did'nt try the crumb topping.  I wanted extra pie crust so I made another batch of pie dough to roll out for the top.  But I'm sure the original topping is delicious as well. Thank you for this one :).

When I read the ingredients for the crust, I was a bit leery, but after eating the pie, we found we loved it. I did have to cook it longer then suggested, but in the end it was excellent.

For the crust add 1 tablespoon vinegar and you can handle it all you want and it won't get tough.

Delicious! This is officially my new signature pie recipe! so, easy to make and the crunchy topping was a pleasant suprise.The only changes I made were as follows, extended the cook time by 8 minutes which results in the perfect golden brown.Also, I used a store bought pie crust which was very tasty and time saving! everything else i did as recipe calls, enojy!

I really liked the pie and so did my family I enjoyed the buttery topping and the flaky crust my only complaints: it wasn't very pretty and it took a lot longer than 45 minutes to bake, probably more like 1 hour 15 minutes.

Made this while my 2 small children ate breakfast it was simple and fast! Brought it for dessert at my Grandmothers house and everyone loved it! I did add a little cinnamon to the crust and vanilla extract to the filling. Will be my apple pie recipe from now on!

This is an excellent recipe! I added lemon juice to keep the apples from browning and I needed more flour to make the top crust work. Probably the best apple pie I've ever made.

I loved the topping to this! I used 6 apples (not sure what type since we had picked a variety). Next time I'll add a bit less sugar. I added some cinnamon to the top, used a store bought crust and added the cornstarch and lemon juice and cooked over low heat as others suggested.

We made this recipe the other day and it was terrible. The crust was good but the filling looked good until it came out of the oven. When set it made the crust all wet and soggy and mushy. We followed the directions to a tee. Not recommnded

I made a few of these for a charity bake sale. I had people actually take the whole pies after having a piece. Very good. I too boiled the filling first. I did "test" before without pre cooking and it was just as great. Very good for a favorite to the comfort food must haves!

The filling had a good taste, but it was very runny.  I only used 3 apples, and it still had a LOT of juices.  I can't imagine using 6.

Easy apple pie recipe! I didn't use Fuji apples - instead used the cheap "tote bag" apples on sale at the store, and it was still great. My crumb top didn't really "crumb" - it more baked into a cakey topping - but that might have been me. all in all, would make again!

This was an awesome pie but too sweet for us. I used Cortland apples and substituted the white sugar for brown. I also precooked the apples based on Any Mariez's suggestion. I will continue to make my pie this way, having the apples caramelize in the sugar is fantastic.

I made this pie for the first time at Thanksgiving and my family LOVED IT!  I'm a new baker and still weary of making dough from scratch so I purchased a Philsbury pie crust (comes with 2 to a box) and used one as the crust and the second as the top.

This was okay, pretty good. I think it needed to be cooked for longer b/c the apples were still kind of firm.

My family LOVED this recipe. I sprinkled some cinnamon sugar on top before putting it in the oven to give it a bit of a sweeter taste but I'm sure it would be amazing without as well.

This is a wonderful recipe. My family loved it I had to make three for a family get together in 10 min they were gone I did change a few things I follwed some of the others and cooked the apples and I also added 1/4 tsp of vanilla to the apples and 1 tsp of vanilla to the crust and to the topping mix.

This pie was excellent and very easy to make! I did a test run of this pie on my family before I make it for Thanksgiving,  and it was a hit!!! I did make a few modifications per the other reviews.  I did a quick cook of the Cortland/Gala Apples for 10 minutes adding 1-2 T lemon juice and the  2 T of cornstarch.  That worked very well.  Also increased the sugar and flour by 4 T each for the pie shell and I increased the oil and milk slightly. Overall the crust was very good and quick to make. I did add 4 T brown sugar to the topping as well as sprinkled toppping w/ ground cloves, cinnamon and nutmeg. This pie was so yummy.....I will make it again for Thanksgiving!

This pie was PHENOMENAL!! I used 5 different varieties of apples and I added pure vanilla in the crust after mixing all ingredients and into the apple filling as well. I also used only real butter not oil in the recipe and the pie was a perfect from top to bottom. Baked perfect in the 45 minutes at 175°c

Great pie!.  I didn't make the crust, but the topping was yummy and the filling was perfect.  I didn't take the other reviewers' suggestion of cooking it or adding cornstarch.  I did cut the (granny smith) apples into a 1/2 inch dice, reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup.  It was plenty sweet and the apples were well cooked after 45 min.  It needed 4 minutes on broil at the end to brown up the topping.  Mmmmmm.

This is the best apple pie we've ever had!  If you're not making this crust from scratch then you are cheating yourself on one of the best parts!  It's not your typical roll-it-out crust; it's very easy to make.  Go for it, you won't be sorry.

Loved it!  Used store bought crust and added 1/4 cup oatmeal and 2 Tbl brown sugar to topping.  Baked for close to an hour and crust was perfect - not overly brown.

Yummy!! I cheated and used an already prepared pie crust but the pie was so good and easy to make. My family ate it right up and it was gone in hours. My picky daughter had seconds. Thank you.

I agree with most of the reviews. I found this to be an excellent choice for the newbies in the "apple pie" territory.  I found it a bit sweeter than my taste but, nothing that a good glass of cold milk won't fix. Also, I did bake it for an additional 30 min. Thanks for the recipe!

The pie filling and toping was delicious! I did not use the dough recipe, as I saw that a lot of reviewers had issues with it. So I made the one on the back of a crisco box. Turned out great! Thanks!

As a first time apple pie-er, I'll admit I was nervous.  But this recipe was a complete breeze.  It was beautiful and fun the whole way thru.  Tasty too!  I used organic gala apples, graham cracker pie shells and sprinkled granola on the very top for a little extra crunch.  It was a hit for sure.  Don't pass this one up!

WOW! This apple pie is WONDERFUL. I made this pie for my father in laws birthday, and I had never made one before because I usually always make peach cobbler because I always thought, surely the peach cobbler is easier. So I just searched for apple pies here and looked at a couple other ones but this one seemed easiest! And it was so easy I couldn't believe it. The longest part is coring the apples and I peeled the skin off. I wish I could give it more than 5 stars!!!!!!!!! I will be using this recipe from now on!

PUT THE CRUST IN THE FRIDGE  I have made this pie twice, and the crust works out much better if you put it in the fridge for at least 30 minutes before you use it.    --  This really is the best apple pie I have ever had.  I stuck entirely to the recipe and it was perfect.  You do have to bake it about half an hour longer.  Make this one!

This is a great recipe. Thank you for adding it. I did cut time by using a prepared crust (Marie Calendars - I let it thaw while preparing the filling). I also cooked the ingredients for the filling over the stove top in a pot and added spices to taste. Once the filling was warmed and gooey I put it in the pie crust added the topping (I made a little extra) and in the oven to bake. It was very good!

The topping is amazing!  The crust turned out great. I did what others suggested and cooked the apples a bit on the stove with some lemon juice first.  This is one I actually printed and laminated and plan to make for holidays!  Thanks for sharing!! :D

FABULOUS!!! My 7-year-old son wanted to bake his first pie. I chose this recipe since it looked easy enough and was highly rated. It was PERFECT!! I used a store bought crust and added lemon juice and corn starch to the filling as others suggested. I also added 30 minutes onto the baking time. I repeat...PERFECT!! It was delicious and simple and my son couldn't be more proud of himself! I'll keep this recipe forever!

This was my first fruit pie ever and it turned out perfect!  I did add the cornstarch and lemon juice and cooked apple filling stovetop for about 15 min.  I used cold butter and added a little brown sugar to the topping.  This pie is delicious!!

This was my first time making an apple pie or any type of pie for that matter. It was for the most part a success. Tasted heavenly, only problem was that it was extra soupy in the middle. Any suggestions on how to solve that problem??

All in all an amazingly delicious pie. We went out to dinner and one of my husbands relatives ordered apple pie and told me my pie was better.

Thanks for this recipe!

The very best!! My daughter and I made this quick and easy pie Thanksgiving day. The only changes we made was to use golden delicious apples and cooked for an extra 1/2 hour. Didn't have a cutter so used hands.

I made this pie in summer, exactly as directed, and loved it.  I made it again for Thanksgiving, using 4 apples and 1 cup sour cherries, and finished as directed.  It was a nice variation, and still tasted great.  Remember to cook stove top for 15 or 20 minutes.  yum!

I just had 6 granny smith apples hanging out on my counter so I was motivated to make an apple pie. This recipe was easy to do, but I took everyone's advice and cooked the apple filling for a few minutes on the stove first.  I also added a little extra butter to the filling and reduced all the liquid in the pan to a syrup.  This pie came out great and the topping came out wonderful, like a spattered pie crust top, very pretty without much effort. I'm definitely making this on for Thanksgiving and Christmas, so simple and yummy.

great recipe!  I've gotta work on the crumb topping, but fabulous crust recipe as well.  I also had to bake about 30 mins longer than indicated.  I used extra large fresh crop fuji's so it was sweet but with a little tartness & I only had to use 4. . .wonderful recipe-- thank you!

I don't particularly like apple pie, but we had a surplus of apples in the house. So, Allrecipes it was. This pie is easy to make, and so delicous! It's not too sweet, is moist, and has an excellent balance of flavors. You can really taste the apples, instead of so much sugar and spice. I made just a couple of modifications, in that I cut the sugar by approximately half. I also doubled the cinnamon and skipped the nutmeg, which I don't like. For a moister pie, I added a splash of water to the bottom-layer crust. Any recipe that is easily modified and can still taste terrific is a winner in my house.

I just made this pie for a party and people loved it.  I used a pre-made frozen pie crust (9" deep dish) and it was great.  So easy to make.

Pretty good.  I did have problems with the topping, but the rest of the pie was very tasty, and it was pretty basic and easy to make...even for me who has made very few pies in my time.

This is the 1st time that I have ever baked a pie.  It turned out really well except for the topping.  After making the pie, I was reading the other reviews and saw that I should not have melted the butter.  I thought that should be in the recipe to have cold butter not melted.

I loved the crust on this pie! Everyone else did as well! I didnt put in as much butter or sugar as suggested though as no one in my family likes much butter or suger, but it still turned out really nice! It was a great pie and disappeared really fast! Its now the pie everyone is asking for! THANKS!

Very easy to make. I had to make 9 apple pies for my team and this was a great easy recipe. The only thing i did different was less apples, and when you take it out of the oven i sprinkled brown sugar, milk, white sugar mixture over it to give it a carmel glaze.

I see this pie has people divided, haters and praisers. It went quite well for me: the crust is the quickest you can imagine, and healthier than most, using oil instead of other fats. The juice of the fruit did not overflow while cooking; the apples were a lot when raw, but gradually went down into their crust... and the result was good. A little bit on the "apple crumble pie" side, but a keeper for me. You want to add raisins, or dried apricots or so, you are welcome.

My husband wanted me to make an apple pie, since we has our handpicked apples. I followed this recipe. Husband said: "It's good. The pie is good." It took one additional hour to see the pie was reeady. No way it cooks in 45 minutes. Very good taste and good recipe for those who want to accomplish something simple, and then it can be worked afterwards. I'd say it is a fail  safe.

This is the first time I've made an apple pie and it was so easy and very tasty.  I used allspice instead of nutmeg (didn't have any in the house) and granny smith apples and it turned out perfect.  I will definitely make this again soon!

I don't know why some of the other people who made this recipe "failed" with it....I followed the directions other than I am not a nutmeg fan and added a bit more cinnamon instead and I added some cinnamon to the topping.  It came out great! I let it completely cool before cutting into since I made it so early....All of my family was very pleased.

This was my first pie from scrach, and everyone loved it!  One thing though, since it was my first pie, I didn't know to peel the apples (duh).  I didn't think about it, until it was too late.  Everyone still loved it though.  Great receipe!!!

This is the first pie I have ever made and everybody was really impressed. The topping wasn't crumbly, but I didn't feel like that was a problem. I think that the taste (sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg) is right on. And I really liked the crust. Although I did taste the flour on the apples, so I might change that next time. The only thing I did differently was I added extra cinnamon sugar to the top before I baked it. I used half macintosh apples and half fuji apples. I will bake it a little longer next time; I thought the apples could be softer.

Don't usually make pies as I have no luck with dough but this recipe made it soooo easy for me.  Added a few extra apples for our taste and hubby and I both loved it.  Definately would make this again.  May even try using a different fruit but use this recipe.  Excellent!!

This was the first apple pie I've ever made, and was really easy!I substituted a little brown sugar for white, and added about 1/2c chopped pecans, and had almost a praliney taste, which almost made it too sweet! I also had to add more flour/sugar to the topping mixture to make it crumbly (probably 1/3c more) and had to cook for almost 15 mins more!But, very tasty, just the right amount of cinn/nutmeg!

I thought this was pretty good.  Too sweet!!  And I did not even put the full amount of sugar.  But, that is just my tastes.  Also, I would add extra spices next time.

Absolutely delicious!  I couldn't find a 5oz pack of pudding at the store so I used two 3.4 oz packs instead.  For people who don't like bananas, substitute lightly sweetened, thawed, raspberries.  Fabulous!

Family loved this pie for Thanksgiving. Even got compliments from the in-laws.  Used less butter on topping as suggested and kept it cold. Mixed all dry ingredients prior. Sliced apples very thin...ohhh so nice.  Will use this easy crust for other pies.

I made 3 different apple pies in one day to find the best recipe and this one was clearly the winner. It tasted just like home! The crust is so simple, I'll be using it for all my pies.

I like the crust and topping, but when it came to the filling it was just way too much sugar, the pie came out super mega sweet and watery, the flavor is ok, but not great due to excesive sweetness, I guess next time I will only use half the sugar, and less oil in the crust.  No need to oil and flour the pan.  I love the way the crust and topping are made, I would think it's easy enough for a kid to do it.

I absolutely loved this recipe!!  Before making this, I had never really cooked anything in my life.  When everyone at my 4th of July party found out that I had made this from scratch, they couldn't believe it! It was delicious!!  Thanks Amy for inspiring me to try more recipes!!

Great recipe! I appreciate the input from other reviewers, which helped guide my making this pie. I used Golden Delicious apples because that's what my hubby likes. I also used Truvia (1/2 regular, 1/2 brown sugar blend) instead of regular white sugar to greatly reduce the glycemic impact. As suggested by another reviewer, I made the liquified the filling in a sauce pan on the stove, which required a little butter and heavy cream, plus added 1 tsp of vanilla to the filling.

Reason for 4 stars instead of 5? The crust ingredients did not make enough crust to push up the sides and crimp at the top. It went only about half way up the sides of my glass pie dish.

I’ve been making this apple pie since 2005. It’s my go-to fall recipe and everyone who’s tasted it loves it. I’ve used different varieties of apples in the past. The last pie I made, I used some honeycrisps that were more tart than we liked and a ready-mix crust that I had on hand. It still came out great.

Great recipe! My husband has told me to ditch all other apple pie recipes. He says this one is by far his favorite. I've made this recipe two times so far. The recipe is perfect as is, the only exception is that on the second pie I doubled the crumb topping. I also have had to double my bake times. Both times it took an hour and 30 minutes to finish baking. (I like a nice golden top to the pie)  pie!!!

Great and easy. Use pulls bury pie crust for shortcut. 

I increased cinnamon and nutmeg to 1 tsp and it's much better.  Also I used Granny Smith apples, not Fuji.

Great pie! After looking through lots of comments, I substituted 1/2 of all sugars with brown sugar and I also added 1/4 cup crushed oatmeal to the crumb mixture and added one tsp of cornstarch in addition to the flour.  Came out perfect - first apple pie that was juicy and yet all of the slices stayed together without falling apart.  I'm saving this one for sure!

First time making a pie.  Started with "Easy Pie Crust", then found this recipe.  Made it with 5 Cameos, with the addition of some lemon juice, put it in the pre-baked crust & it turned out so good that it was our dinner-- hubby & I ate the whole thing in one sitting.  So, next morning,  made 3 more pies, this time according to the recipe, putting the apples in the unbaked crust.  It came out a little doughy.  Next morning I made another pie -- pre-baking the crust,  My recommendation:  pre-bake the crust!  I am obsessed.
Thank you, Amy, for this 10-star recipe!

I made this because someone gave me a very large package of apples already peeled an cored. Therefore I didn't use Fuji apples.  Everything else was exactly the same.  I couldn't believe the raves I received and the pie was eaten within twenty-four hours. It went beyond delicious.  The crumb topping  didn't brown as quickly as I would have liked but was ready at the end on the baking time.  This is a real keeper and I am going to make it again this week with Fuji Apples.  Definitely, a five star.recipe.

This has been my daughter's favorite pie for years. I always make it for her on Thanksgiving and Christmas. The recipe is absolutely perfect as is.  My main advice is buy a pastry cutter! I've tried making the topping without one, and it never works.

I really wanted to make this pie, and rate it.. I ended up using a frozen crust, which was fine.. But then, I made so many changes, only because I liked some of the suggestions the other reviewers said.. It just came out of the oven, and smells wonderful.  But I can't rate and review due to all the changes I made.. I WILL make it again soon, and make it as the recipe states.  For now, 5 stars.

by far the best apple pie I've ever had and the hubs said the same thing. I followed the recipe other than apples. I used what apples I had been given. Not Fuji, they were from old neglected apple trees of mixed varieties and small.  I don't think you'll be disappointed with this pie.

So the crust recipe was missing something...so I added an egg and a dash of cinnamon and it came out beautifully. Also added extra butter and some oats to the topping mixture I would have added brown sugar or molasses but I didn't have any on hand! I love a good crunchy dutch apple pie. Good basic EASY apple pie recipe, I think I had this thing in the oven in less than 10 minutes.

Better than expected!  I used Granny Smith apples, and peeled them. I sliced them thin & they baked perfectly in the time called for. I had plenty of sugar/spice mixture for coating the raw apples, so next time I might reduce a little.  I altered the topping slightly so it was more like a crisp. I used 1/4 c white, 1/4 c brown sugar, added some cinnamon & nutmeg and about ½ c oats. I loved how the crust was quick & easy with pie crust taste  without the normal work, fuss, and mess of a rolled crust. I'll definitely make this again.

I used the ingredients listed but used the suggestion of someone else to cook the apples and ingredients on the stove  to soften the apples.  This was the best apple pie I have ever made.

I have made this about 10 times. Great apple pie, but the crumble topping has way too much butter in the recipe. Maybe my problem is I converted to g for the butter.  I added 1 1/2 cups flour to get the right consistency, and also the right amount of topping.

Fantastic and delicious! Super easy. This crust recipe is so easy and turns out so well, i used it on all of my pies this year and will never roll out a crust again. The filling was great too, i used golf=den delicious apples sliced thin, i prefer soft filling not crisp.  Super awesome recipe.

Third time making this pie in the past month, and it is delicious. I can't comment on the crust, I took the easy way with out with a Trader Joe's crust. I used Granny Smith apples and followed the filling and topping  instructions exactly. I believe the recipe should be amended to adjust the ratio of butter to flour in the topping, and also be more explicit that cold butter is required to have good results with the topping. My room temperature butter made a very doughy topping instead of course crumbs. I'd try 1 C flour next time as other people mentioned doing, along with COLD butter for a more crumbly topping. Each time, it required a bit more time to cook, probably 55-65 minutes with a foil rim around the edge to prevent over-browning.  I convinced my daughter and husband to help and it was a fun family affair. We're looking forward to eating it tomorrow after Thanksgiving dinner !

Recipe worked very well as printed and was actually terrific!  I'm not a fan of more traditional/thicker crusts, so this patted oil crust and topping was great.  I made the crumb topping exactly as listed and it was perfect.  The key is to use very cold real butter.  I cut the stick of cold butter into tiny cubes by slicing it into 4 equal, lengthwise slices on each of two adjoining sides and then making 16 cuts across the stick.  Crumble the butter into the flour and sugar mixture, toss with a fork until coated and then use the pastry blender.  It crumbles perfectly .  I piled it evenly on the apples and it all baked down into a nicely topped pie!  I did bake it about an hour to get the topping a light brown.

One of the best pies ever! The main reason I made this one was because it  was the only one with a recipes for the crust. As top reviewers suggested, I cooked my apple first in the sauce pan and added lemon and cornstarch. I also reduced the baking time. Perfect!

Followed directions to the letter. All I got was a watery liquid mess so loaded with sugar it's not worth eating. Well not do this one again. I have been backing for years and never seen anything like it.

This pie is truly amazing!! It was very quick and easy! The flavor was amazing! I made one little adjustment. When I peeled my apples I cut them up and put them in a pan with lemon juice and a lil cinnamon and suger. I didn't add too much suger because the recipe already required a mix for the apples. Everyone wanted me to make it again and loved it. I'll make this for holiday pies

Hands down the best apple pie with non-crust topping I've ever made or had! I used Granny Smith apples instead of Fuji apples. My son never liked apple pie before, until he tasted this. A scoop of vanilla ice cream on top made a really tasty addition too!

I like this recipe, I have made it many times, even my girl is making this for her friends.  The only changes is just using 1 or 2 green apples to balance the taste.  The original recipe is a bit sweet for our family.

Here's a hint you might like to try. Put the pie in a paper bag and staple shut. Bake for 1 hr. 45 min.

I really like this pie! But I find that the bottom crust is too salty. I would use half the salt, and twice the sugar in the bottom crust. Also, in my convection oven, it took me 1h15m to cook the pie to a golden top, which is okay, I don't mind baking it longer if I have to, but I also found that the apples didn't cook that well. They're a little chewey, and not soft. I the future I will cook my apples in a saucepan before putting them in the pie shell. Other than those 2 things (I'm not counting the time as an issue) this pie is definitely A+

Most apple pie recipes here didn't have a recipe for a pie crust so i chose this. Amazing! I'm a new baker and  i was able to make it. Tastes so good too! I added cinnamon and nutmeg to the crumb topping!

We made 2 changes to the recipe: used Granny Smith apples instead and used half the nutmeg and replaced the other half with allspice. Otherwise, followed everything else as best we could. Topping and filling were both EXCELLENT. Did fall apart very easily as others said, but I actually kinda like it that way. Only drawback was the flavor of the crust. Just tasted like oil, and pretty strongly. Didn't notice as much when I had enough filling and topping in a bite with it, but on it's own it's pretty gross. It did make the dough easier to work with than one made with butter or shortening, which makes it a good beginner pie. But we may just try another crust with this one some time.

This was a hit with my family!  I did peel the apples and cook them first as recommended by other reviewers with lemon juice and cornstarch.   I also had to cook the pie for about 30 minutes longer to get the topping firm in the middle.   The topping could be sweeter but the tart apples balance it out.

Love this recipe! I made it exactly how the recipe said to and it turned out amazing!!! If you eat the pie the first night you make it the pie crust is not a firm but still delicious:) the next day the crust is more firm but the topping melts a little when you heat it up, I personally prefered the pie the night of, my husband prefered the pie the next day, amazing either way. Very easy to make and super yummy!!!!

I have made this pie 4 or 5 different times. For the filling I cut back the sugar to 1/4 cup and add an extra tablespoon of cinnamon. It's still a great taste if you follow recipe exactly, but VERY VERY sweet. I have used both gala and Fuji apples, both work great if you slice them very thin. Thanks!

My 11 year old requested apple pie for Thanksgiving this year. This was my first attempt. I will never buy apple pie ever again. I followed the suggestion from other reviewers and cooked the apples for about 15 minutes on medium heat with 2 tablespoons of cornstarch and 1 tablespoon of lemon juice. I also added about 1/4 teaspoon of ground cloves and 1/2 teaspoon more of cinnamon to the filling. For the topping I used 1/4 cup white sugar, 1/4 cup of brown sugar, 1/4 cup of quick cooking rolled oats and a 1/4 teaspoon each of cloves, cinnamon and nutmeg in addition to the other topping ingredients. Ensure that the butter is cold. I used salted butter. I put all the topping ingredients in the food processor and pulsed until it resembled fine crumbs then spread it all on top of the filling. It may look like a lot of topping but just pile it on anyway. I baked for exactly 45 minutes. It was amazing. Between the three of us, the entire pie was gone by 9 pm :-)!

Best recipe ever!!!Don't cheat and use store bought crust. This crust is soooo easy and makes the pie so tasty. I would not use the cookie sheet for a glass pan as mine did not brown until I took it off the sheet. It's a keeper for me and my apples were from my own tree :)

Loved this apple pie recipe, one of the best apple pies I've ever had. I used 4 granny smith and 3 braeburn apples. After combining the apple slices, sugar (I used 1/2 cup white and 1/4 cup brown sugar), spices and flour I put in large sauce pan and cooked on stove top for about 20 minutes. The braeburns break down somewhat while the granny smiths remain fairly firm, some of the juice cooks away and the rest combines to make a thick and delicious sauce that doesn't make the bottom crust soggy. I then baked as recommended. The crumb topping was good, but the texture was slightly off for my taste. I think next time I'm going to make it with 1/2 white and 1/2 brown sugar to see if that's what I was missing. I also used a full tablespoon of cinnamon in the filling and 1 tsp in the topping because we love cinnamon. It was delicious.

I have made this apple pie twice now, and each time I have gotten spectacular feedback.

I made the following modifications: 

I added some water into the crust batter because I wanted to roll it out and it just wasn't happening. Even after adding the water it was very difficult so I ended up just flattening out small pieces and sticking them together in the pan -- it worked great and I actually recommend it as it was super easy and effective. 

The first time I made this pie I used some apples from my backyard and it was amazing -- just the right combination of sweet and tart. The second time, I bought some pink lady apples and I found that while the pie was still delicious, I would have preferred to use a sweeter variety. 

In addition, I added lemon juice to the apples and a tablespoon of brown sugar and less of white sugar. 

The first time I made this pie, I over mixed the crust and ended up with a consistency that was not very good for crumbling, so just like the crust, I pieced together the topping on top of the apples. I did this the second time also because I loved the way it looked!

Anyway, this is a fantastic recipe and it will definitely be my go-to from now on!

Excellent apple pie! For the filling instead of using all white sugar, I used 1/2 cup brown sugar and a 1/4 cup white sugar. The topping I smashed it all over the top of the apples like a crust. Definitely a kkeeper!

I thought this was a great pie.  I hate making traditional pastry and rolling it out.  The bottom crust was surprisingly simple and came out flaky.  I used Cortland apples and brown sugar in the filling and crumble.  I used a glass pie plate and put it on a stone pan in the oven.  I thought it would fall apart but the pieces came out nicely only about 20 min out of the oven.  My husband says he prefers traditional apple pie but as the cook, this will become my preferred apple pie dessert.

one star but only for the picture.  this pie looked good at first, but it ended up coming out ugly. it was not edible! the bottom crust was soggy and the topping was cooking faster than anything else. the filling was super sweet so need to cut back on the sugar. i followed the directions to a T and all i got was a mess. no one liked the pie.  :(

To be fair, I did not make the crust or topping - I had my own pie crust I wanted to use.  However, the filling from this recipe was very easy to put together and delicious!  Next time I will try the crust and topping too :-)

Awesome recipe!  I did as others suggested and cooked apple mixture for 20 minutes and added 1 1/2 T. of cornstarch to filling.  I also cut salt back to 1/2 tsp in the crust.  Very good, my favorite apple pie recipe!

I served this pie to my in laws and my mother in law said it was one of the best pies she has ever had.  Easy, loved the fact that it uses oil in the crust instead of butter (cuts down on the calories and fat content).  GREAT!  EASY!

My family said this was the best apple pie I had ever made. The crust is quick and flaky. It is almost identical to the No Roll Crust II recipe on this site. The slight changes I made were reducing the sugar added to the apples to 1/2 cup, and halving the amount of topping for which I used brown sugar instead of white. I sliced the apples very thinly and baked the pie just over an hour. I did not have a problem with the apples being cooked. I may try an oatmeal based streusal topping next time to make it a little healthier.

I made this GLUTEN FREE and it was awesome.  I followed the recipe and replaced "flour" with Bob's Redmill baking mix and added 2 tsp of xanthan gum.  The crust was easy to work with, which is unusual for GF dough, I did use less sugar on the apples, and used brown sugar in the crumb topping.  I did need to cook it about 30 minutes longer to get the top to brown and cook. The crust stayed together nicely and was easy to cut a peice of pie and remove it. I will use the crust recipe for other GF pies.

This was my first attempt at a homemade apple pie. It was great. I took suggestion to add lemon and cornstarch and pre-cook filling. My first attempt for the topping didn't turn out great but I aced it my second time. It was delicious!

I rated this a 4 because of a few reasons. One, I thought that the crust was to thin. My husband liked it because he's not much of a crust eater, myself on the other hand I love crust. The other reason was both my husband and I thought that there was to much nutmeg, almost over taking. I put in the exact amount. One other thing was I peeled my apples, not sure if I should have or not but after the finished product I was glad I did. Other than all that this was great and for my first apple pie it worked great.

My family loved it, however it did need to stay in the oven longer because the top would not brown.  I put it on broil for about 5 minutes and it turned out just fine.   Will make this again.

very good pie.  although, the topping did not crumble.  it was very doughy and i just "plopped" it on top.  i think it needed more sugar and flour.  i will definitely make this pie again!  very easy and yummy!

Try this as written before you do anything else. It is a very simple, easy recipe and it really is delicious. I did cook it a little longer becauce of my oven. It's not the most attractive but it sure is good.

Delicious!  I cheated by using refrigerated pie crust, but since this has a crumb topping, you don't lose as much.  Very easy.  The filling was perfect.  I added some chopped pecans to the crumb topping which put it over the edge for me.

Out of the oven about one hour and already half of it is gone.  Very quick and easy.... I love the ease of the dough.  I would use less sugar on the filling net run through.  I will make this again...

It turned out a little too sweet for me. Loved the crust! Even though the topping was soft and fell apart when cutting it up.

This pie was AWSOME! But to be honest, I did not even try the crust. I use this recipe for the filling. I made my own crust from a different recipe. This filling was great. It is super easy too.

This was the FIRST apple pie that I made that didn't turn out to be "swimming" in juice!  OMG-- it was sooooo good!  I must admit that I used the recipe for the filling only, and cheated by using a premade pie crust... and I did end up baking it for quite a bit longer, but even still!  It turned out beautiful, tasty, and is now my family's favorite pie!!  I'll be proud to put this on the table for Thanksgiving!!

This was great! and i followed several suggestions to cook the apples with the Lemon juice and corn starch, however my topping did not look crumbled like the picture. not sure if did something wrong for the topping, but does anyone have any suggestions for me? my pie came out looking like a pie not with a crumbled top! thanks!

my family loved it! I used frozen crust and followed recipe for filling. I took previous advice and cooked apples for 20 min on low, added a touch of brown sugar. I used about 10 small yellow apples ( I needed to use them up). Followed recipe for topping. so yummy, warm with vanilla bean ice cream.

Great Recipe!! Not too sweet. I ended up flattening the dough for the top into little pancakes and placing them on the top with extra cinnamon and nutmeg.

The crust fell apart. The crumb topping was a bit too sweet. I would have preferred the apple cut into chunks. I didn't care for the texture of the apple peel left on.

This was my first time making apple pie, and my first time making any pie + crust. It was delicious and my boyfriend loved it too. I had to use butter spread for the topping, so it did not come out crumb-like, but I still put it on top and it turned out nice and crunchy. I did have to bake it for an extra hour, so the apples were pretty soft. Not sure if that is good or bad, but it was great to us. I'll definitely use regular butter next time.  Thanks!

I am glad I picked this apple pie recipe. It was so good. I used a frozen pie crust and cooked the apples for about 30 minutes. I added 1 tbsp lemon juice and 2 tbsp cornstarch as other reviewers. I had used two 9 inch pie crust because 6 apples were more than enough for one. The first pie was gone in 10 minutes. Thanks for submitting such a great recipe.

Yum yum yum! I've made this twice and both times were delicious. I use a store-bought pie crust, only 4 apples (this was definitely enough... 6 apples were WAY too many), used all BROWN sugar for the topping (personal preference), and added cinnamon (1/2 T), rolled oats (1/4 c) and granola (1/4 c) to the crumb topping. Baked at 350 for 1 hour. Wonderful!

Our apples were overripe.  My husband says he used dark brown sugar instead of white, did not pinch the pie crust up the sides of a cake pan, left it thick and dusted with sugar.  This resulted in chewy candied corners!  He added a topping of crunchy turbinado raw cane sugar.  The only thing missing was ice cream!  My husband was impressed with the ease of making this pie and would like to try it with whole wheat, honey, molasses or feta.

I thought this was really yummy I didn't use the pie crust recipe that they gave, however the filling is really yummy.  I added nuts to mine and a handful of raisins the second time around and it turned out really good.

I didn't use the crust portion of this recipe, but the rest was absolutely delicious!  I ,too, cooked my apples with 1 Tbls of lemon juice and 2 Tbls of cornstarch on low for 20 minutes.  This cut my baking time down dramatically (only 40 minutes) and made the top crust just PERFECT.  The filling was absolutely GREAT.  Nice recipe.

An excellent apple pie. Quick, easy, crumbly and sweet. I only used 2 large gala apples, sliced very thin, and added cloves to the dry mix and 1/4 C brown sugar in the crust. My husband is my taste-tester and he is a pie man, not a cake man and really enjoyed this pie. He wants it for his birthday next month - just add vanilla bean icecream! Delish.

I made this for my boyfriend and both him and his parents loved it. I changed it up a bit... I used 7 apples- 4 granny smith and 3 macintosh. With adding another apple I added a little more sugar, cinnamon and nutmeg... just a little bit more. I also used a frozed pie crust for the bottom and instead of using the crumb topping, I used a regular (roll out from the store) crust to make it a more traditional apple pie. He said it was awesome... I will be making this one again!!!

Loved this recipe. My son-in-law gave it a big thumbs up so it must have been good. I added oatmeal to the topping and took the suggestion of cooking the apples a bit first and it turned out wonderful.

delicious!! didnt have any all purpose flour in the house so i used a combination of wheat flour and pastry/cake flour for the crust and wheat flour for the topping. if you like cinnamon like i do, definitely add extra! i added some oats and pecans in the topping for some crunch. for the filling i make the sugar/cinnamon mixture first then sliced the apples into it and stirred to avoid browning. when i was done there was a nice syrup. i also added 1.5 TBSP of cornstarch and baked for 1hr. this took care of the juices...thanks to everyone's reviews!

Everyone loved it!  I used a pre-made crust & the lemon juice with cornstarch that was recommended by another reviewer.  I started making it and realized I didn't have any more cinnamon so used pumpkin pie spice instead.  Fantastic pie!

After making this pie, I am now the official pie maker of the family.  I have taken over Grandma's job.  She even asked for the recipe.  I do add a little oatmeal and brown sugar to the topping mix.  Also works with a pre-made pie crust on the bottom if you are short on time.  Thank you

My first apple pie ever and it was AMAZING!  Yum, yum, YUM!  I took this to a Thanksgiving get together tonight and everyone loved it!  I used a frozen pie crust on the bottom, but other than that, I followed the recipe exactly as written! (I sprinkled extra cinnamon on top too, just for fun!)  I am going to be making this delicious apple pie for years!!!

terrific pie! I always make a tradional 2 crust pie but the crumbly top was great!Used a frozen bottom crust, added more cinnamon and nutmeg to the apples, which were a combo of Granny Smith, fuji and red delicious. Did  not pay much attention to size of chunks and slices and it was a perfect pie. will make again and again.

This apple pie was ok. It really tastes more like apple crisp w/ a crust vs. an apple pie. One thing to note - do not soften the butter for the crumble. I did and it was like a paste. You have to use cold butter. It tasted good but not like pie.

I can't believe how good this pie was!!!!  I am not much of a pie baker, this is one of the best pies I have ever tasted IN MY LIFE, I can't believe that I made it!!  I did use a pie crust mix, because I have failed miserably at pie crusts before.  My husband is a HUGE fan, too.  Best pie ever!

I followed the recipe mostly as written.  With these few modifications, we really enjoyed this apple pie.  I added 1 tbsp lemon juice to the filling, used a pre-made pie crust, and baked the pie for 10 mins at 450 degrees then for 40 mins at 375 degrees.  The only addition I would make is adding 1-2 tbsp of cornstarch to thicken.  The whole family loved it.

My hubby loves apple pie, I am not much of a baker when it comes to pies, anything else I can do.  I loved how easy the crust was.  My hubby said it was the best Pie he has ever had, he had 3 slices and couldnt stop eating it. 
I made it exactly as written, I was a little worried about the top crust, I should of looked at the reviews where it said the butter had to be cold.  So it was a little doughy, but it was sooooo good anyway.  I will be making this again as we have tons of apples from apple picking. I used 6 concord apples.

This apple pie is GREAT!  I'm not a cook, and I have always shied away from pies because I was nervous about the pie crust.  This crust is so easy and tastes great!  The pie comes together so quickly, it will become a regular on our menu!

Good!! i cooked the filling first (golden delicious apples, sugar, white wine, cornstarch and cinnamon). Did not like the topping at all, i found it too sweet and greasy, even after cutting down on butter. 
The crust was scrumptious!!! my mom wants me to make cookies out of it, i'll give it a try adding more sugar and maybe an egg white.
Thanks for sharing!!

I did what other reviewers suggested and added a bit of flour but my pie turned out dry, the apples were completely uncooked and the topping was just a dry, flour-y mess.  Maybe it was the apples I used, but really I'm not going to be trying this again.

Oh wow! This pie is so good, and so easy! I wanted a real American apple pie to serve to our friends in France. They loved it and several asked for the recipe. Merci!

Very good.  I used five large Fuji apples, but should have used 6 as the recipe called for.  My pie also needed to be baked for an hour.  After 45 minutes it wasn't quite done.

I love this pie.  It is delicious.  I've made it twice now and had to cook it longer than instructed because my apples still seemed raw, but it is delicious nonetheless.

I thought the taste was pretty good.  I was looking for a apple pie to make that only took a bottom crust.  I did add a bit more flour to make the topping crumbly and it took a bit longer than the 45 minutes to cook.  At first I thought it was not going to be very good as when I cut into it the pie was still warm and the bottom crust was a little soggy.  The next morning I looked at it and it was held together nicely and the taste reminded me of the apple pies my grandmother used to make.  This is a pie I will make again if I do not have the time to make my own pie crust or if I dont' feel like making it that day.  Thanks for the recipe.

This one even impressed my Gramma!  I made it today and it is all gone.  I love the fact that there is no rolling pin involved.  I'll have to master the technique for pressing the crust in - next time I might put the entire crust in first then push it into place, rather than doing the bottom first.  Definitely do not get your hands wet!!  Everything was great, and I used apples off of my Mum's tree. Thank you!

I made this and was a bit nervous because my aunt was going to be eatting it and she is a master cook\baker. Well to say the least she absolutely loved it and was actually asking ME for a recipe. The best Apple Pie I've ever had, and the easiest to make!

i really love this recipe!  i greatly appreciate how the crust requires no rolling pin/flour all over the place/lots of muss and fuss.  

the first time i tried making the crumb topping, it turned out to be a huge mess (really gloppy) because i wasn't familiar with the usage of a pastry cutter.  but the second time around i got the hang of it...although I always seem to end up using around 1/4 cup of butter instead of the 1/2 (then it starts getting oozy and goopy for me).  

also, fuji apples make for a really sweet pie...my family liked it with granny apples more.

This is by far the best apple pie I have ever had!!  You may want to cook the pie a little longer so the apple get softer.

The filling in this recipe was runny, the crust was greasy and gooey. . . i too had to add more flour and sugar to the topping to make it crumbly. . . This is the second AND FINAL time I will try to cook this apple pie, sorry.

I made only one substitution to this recipe by using Granny Smith apples and it was very good, but a little too sweet.  I was surprised at that, but still, it got rave reviews from my family, therefore I am giving it four stars.

I found this very easy to prepare...I used Granny Smith apples, and the person for whom I prepared this called it "Superb!" (And he considers himself an apple pie connisseur!)  I will definitely make this one again with some of my own homegrown apples!

This is a very simple recipe that tastes like you spent all day on it.  I don't think the pie had cooled 5 minutes when my family started digging in.  It didn't last 24 hours either!  Wonderful apple pie recipe, Amy.

The pie is excellent.  Very easy to make.  I let it bake for an hour and 15 minutes.  I used Golden Delicious apples.  And I found it easier to cut the butter into the flour and sugar mixture before sprinkling it on top of the pie.  But an excellent tasting pie.  Especially warm!  Thanks Amy.

The filling was great.
The crust was too salty and soft.
The topping did not come out crumbly.  
Way too much butter and salt.
We would suggest the measurements be recalculated.

The crummiest pie recipe I have ever used. The crust was doughy and raw even after baking it for longer than the prescribed time. It was aalso way too sweet and syrupy.
