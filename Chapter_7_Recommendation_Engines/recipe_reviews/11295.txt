I make these every year with my children at the request of my entire family.  I suggest rolling them out with a mixture of 1/2 flour and 1/2 powdered sugar for best results.  The frosting recipe that goes with these is as follows: 3 1/2 c. conf. sugar, 3 tbsp. butter softened, 1 tbsp. shortening, 1/2 tsp. vanilla extract, 3-4 tbsp of milk.  This frosting recipe dries quickly and has a nice shine due to the crisco.  Just wanted to share seeing that I would be lost during the holidays without this recipe!

Wow are these ever good and just as the submitter describes "an excellent cookie to decorate".  This has to be some of the easiest (and tastiest) dough to work with for cut-out cookies.  It's easy to roll out and they hold their form during baking.  I increased the amount of white sugar by 1/4 cup and after adding the flour I added 1/4 cup of confectioners' sugar.  I let chill for two hours in the fridge (overnight seemed a bit excessive).  I rolled the dough out onto parchment paper that I lined with a mixture of flour and confectioners' sugar and these baked up beautifully - light, crisp, and buttery with just the right amount of sweetness.

I've been making these cookies for years, I'm glad to see that someone finally posted the recipe here on All Recipes.  I've lost my original recipe so I searched on the internet and ended up here.  Thank God!  Don't know what I'd do without this recipe.  My friends and family absolutely love these cookies!  They hold their shape and taste really good with icing (I use royal icing) or plain.  I even have a habit of eating the dough. hee hee  The cream cheese makes them very soft and rich.  This is by far the best cookie recipe I've ever used...by the way, they are NOT sugar cookies.  Perhaps that's why they are called White Velvet Cutouts...so if you're looking for a traditional sugar cookie, these are definitely not it.  If your dough is sticky (which sometimes mine is...think it has to do with condensation during refrigeration), just use alot of flour when kneading and rolling.  Give them a try, you will not be disappointed with these cookies!

Great cookie!  Glad I read the warnings that it was not a sugar cookie or I would have expected it to be sweeter.  I actually dipped my cut outs in chocolate.  1c. chips to 2T. crisco.  My husband said they reminded him of milano cookies that way.  I plan to do them again with my cookie press and sandwich the chocolate like a milano.  Yummy!

I thought these were exceptionally tasty but my family thought they were only ok.  I make many different recipes of sugar cookies and this was not one of their favorites (but I suppose it's not to be thought of as a sugar cookie). I also found the dough to be extremely sticky. Yes, refrigeration helps but it's still a very sticky dough.  I rolled it between 2 sheets of parchment and used flour. After I rolled it between the 2 sheets of parchment I placed that whole layer on a cookie sheet and placed in the freezer for about 15 minutes - this made the cookie cutter's job alot easier especially since the shapes that I was making were somewhat ornate. If you are decorating your cookies with detail then I think this is a good recipe because the cookie does not lose it's shape while baking. You can definitely taste the cream cheese in these cookies. They are delicious but it does not taste like a true sugar cookie if that is what you are looking for.

This is hands down the best cutout recipe out there! They come out perfect in shape and are great if you want a lot of flavor and not too much sweet. I love to decorate cookies and now use this recipe as my go-to for cut outs. They decorate really well with the    
sugar cookie icing from this site (which also tastes very good!) or if you want them to taste like little cheesecakes (which my husband begs for) use the cream cheese frosting II recipe also from this site.

This is one of the best sugar cookie recipes I've ever made.  Many sugar cookie cut-outs that I've tried end up tasting pretty bland, but these have a wonderfully rich flavor from the cream cheese that makes all the difference in the world.  If I don't want to mess with the precision of frosting, I often just glaze them with a mixture of confectioner's sugar, a splash of corn syrup, and enough milk to make it spreadable.  Gets rave reviews every time.

I've had better sugar cookies, but I really like the unique flavor that the cream cheese gives these ones.  Once you taste the dough, it's hard to make yourself make the cookies!  Two notes: After refrigerating the dough overnight, it was actually TOO stiff to be worked with (but working with it for ten minutes and letting it warm up made it just fine).  Also, don't let the numbers fool you--you have to make awfully small cookies to get 6 dozen out of this recipe.  I used a fairly large pumpkin-shaped cutter, and only got just over two dozen.  They really are tasty, though.

An excellent cookie!  The cream cheese adds wonderful flavor and makes my tried-and-true sugar cookie recipe seem bland in comparison.
I felt that 12 mins. was too long to bake them, though.

These were the best sugar cookies I have ever made!  Much like the shortbread cookies from panera bread.  

I used them for christmas cookies.  but I didn't even frost them.  Still have a batch in my fridge to use.  Definately refridgerate for at least 5 hours.

This is def not a sugar cookie, but it was a cookie my whole family enjoyed.  I would suggest adding at least another 1/2 c of sugar, because even after that, they still weren't too sweet.  I also added 1/4 tsp of salt to help add some flavor.  You can speed things up by freezing the dough for about an hour.  It took a min for the dough to become workable after.  I cut them into shapes and put them in the freezer for 5 min before baking.  Be careful not to burn these, mine started to brown around 10 min.  I would put a thicker frosting, rather than a glaze type, on these next time, but the texture was great.

This is the best cutout recipe!  I'm making these for Easter.  Before putting dough in fridge, be sure to pat it out into a flat 6"round or more.  This way when you take it out of the fridge, it won't be as hard to roll out.  The dough will be hard.  If you like them thin like I do, roll dough out between two sheets of parchment!  This prevents from having to add additional flour, which does change the the cookie.  Also after rolling dough out, use your cutouts to make your shapes, then place back in fridge for about 5 minutes before removing from parchment!  This is a much easier way!  Good luck!

These cookies hold their shape well.   They have very little taste and would make a good cookie for decorating.   I dipped some in a glaze of Peach Schapps and confectioners sugar.  This made them too sweet but my husband enjoyed them.  I prefer the taste of a sugar cookie but these held their shape during baking better than any recipe I've used.

Aside from the fact that the yield is much less than the recipe states, this is an excellent recipe.  I only chilled the dough for just over an hour and that is plenty.  Multiple people commented on how tasty these were.  I'd much rather make these than sugar cookies.

I've had this recipe for years and always loved them. The cream cheese makes them a little tangy and they decorate well. My recipe calls for 1/2 tsp baking powder with the flour otherwise is the same. The dough is sticky, so I usually use a lot of flour and/or roll in between plastic wrap after chilling. I add some lemon juice & milk to 10X sugar for the frosting then put sprinkles on top.

This is my 2nd Christmas making these cookies.  Love them!  We usually eat them plain but I am going to try to dip some of them in chocolate like a previous commenter mentioned.  Mine take longer than the 12 minutes (by about 2 minutes) but I also like mine a bit thicker.  So tasty!  Even my cookie picky husband likes them (he will only eat his mothers cookies....)

These cookies turned out great. Had a nice light flavour...like a shortbread/sugar cookie combo with a twist. Great to decorate too. I used the Sugar Cookie Icing recipe from this site.

These are great.  They hold the shape very well and do not puff up or "melt."  They also taste great (even without frosting) and stay semi-soft.  Yum!

This is THE BEST recipe for cutting out with cookie cutters!  I really like how they pretty much stay the same shape after you bake them!  They taste really good too!  Really good cookie for decorating.  I will make this recipe over and over again!

Easy to make, delicious to eat! I rolled them out thicker than the recommendation, maybe 1/4 of an inch? I wanted them thick enough to make decorating easy, easy to pick up without breaking, etc. I love white velvet cookies better than sugar cookies and this recipe is a keeper!

These turned out great for the suckers I did. I rolled them a little thick and because of that had to bake them a little longer. They were soft but still held up well! I will be using this every time I need cutout cookies!!

Wonderful! Didn't feel like cutting them out, so I just rolled them into little balls and flattened into 1/4" thick circles. Perfect, and so yummy. :-)

These cookies saved me!  I do not consider myself a great baker (and living at very high altitude doesn't help.)  I managed to mess up a recipe for snickerdoodles I was making for my son's preschool holiday party, found this recipe, and, I must say, it is FOOLPROOF.  Didn't change a thing- they look great (this never happens for me) and taste lovely too.  THank you!

These are absolutely the best rolled cookies I have made.  Every year I struggle with sticky dough and cookies that don't hold the shape.  Yay!! I am so happy I found these.

The best cutout cookie that I have ever eaten. These are not sugar cookies, which I hate. These are a more sophisticated, lightly sweetened, rich, buttery cookie. Many requests at all holidays for these.

I was looking for a recipe to use up extra egg yolks and stumbled across this one. Afetr reading the reviews, I could not wait to try it as I have not been successful with several different cut out sugar type cookies. I was pleasantly surprised at how easy this dough cut out and transferred to the cookie sheet. They held their shape and tasted great with or without any icing. I used some leftover chocolate cream cheese icing on some of them and they were awesome. Thank you so much for a great recipe.

This is the best cut out cookie I've ever eaten. The cream cheese makes them so creamy and rich. The cookies had zero spread- which is great for detailed cutters. I rolled mine out using the other reviewer's suggestion that you use 1/2 flour and 1/2 10x sugar. I also kept them pretty thick, and didn't over cook them.

These are great!  They are soft and not too crunchy...especially if you make them a little thicker and big.  I cut mine out in the shape of a football and dipped them in chocolate and then put white icing on top like lacing for the Superbowl.BIG HIT!!

Ok so I didn't read the recipe that good (wine and baking don't mix) I used 1 stick of butter and 1 8oz of cream cheese instead of the required mixture and it turned out even BETTER than the actual recipe!!! My cookies were gorgeous and had a creamy flavor!  TRY IT!!

The PERFECT Rollout Cookie! Soft, tastes great, rolls out easily, holds its shape, and great for decorating... I can't say enough good things about this recipe! I used the "sugar cookie icing" from allrecipes and honestly they taste and look like they came from a bakery. I'm making them as favors for my daughters "High School Musical" birthday party. PS the "sugar cookie icing" is stackable, shiny, easy to make, and very professional looking.

I thought these were average cookies.  I also used light cream cheese.  They were very easy to roll out and cook.  Refrigerate them a bit before putting them in the oven if they get too warm to prevent spreading.  I was very pleased that they didn't spread much at all.  The negatives for us were: 1) too much butter made for a very crunchy/crumbly cookie and a bit greasy 2) not sweet enough - I didn't want a very sweet cookie but I didn't like these without icing 3) just not a whole lot a flavor.  they are a lot like cookie bouquet cookies I think - and I'm just not a huge fan, so I guess you just have to like the right kind of cookie!

These are very good.  The cream cheese makes it different from regular sugar cookies.  The cookies hold their shape well, they don't expand tremendously, as some we've done.

These cookies are awesome.  I have been making them for a few years now.  I actually was on a quest for the best cut out cookie.  My family and friends judged between about five different recipes one Christmas.  This one was by far the winner.  You get a taste of the cream cheese and its butterlicious.  If I'm taking them somewhere I always double the recipe to make enough.  I always get requests for the recipe!  Enjoy!

I did try cut-outs and gave up as they are much better (and saved my impatience) to make as a standard cookie. They got rave reviews from co-workers on my cookie tray for Xmas.

I HATE rolling out any kind of dough- this is by far the easiest dough I have ever worked with. It was very hard straight out of the fridge but beautiful to work with once it started to warm up. Not at all sticky and was so easy to get the perfect thickness. Great tasting, nice and soft, and stayed a gorgeous light color. Perfect! But I did reduce the baking time to 7 minutes and the temp to 325. I think this is variable for everyone depending on your cookie sheets and oven. I always have to experiment a bit with the first batch of any new cookie recipe. Baked these on metal sheets lined with parchment.

I always use this as my cutout recipe. The shapes stay perfect and they are easy to make and roll out. They are not as sweet as sugar cookies but frosting them adds plenty of sweetness! I also use almond extract instead of vanilla because we prefer that taste.

WOW! Made some very charming little heart-shaped cookies for Valentine's Day. They were fabulous! I added 1/4 cup of caster sugar to make them a bit sweeter. The consistency of the finished product was nice... not too crispy and not too soft. The cream cheese adds a nice flavor. Decorate with Barbara's Butter Cream Icing.

For the most part, this recipe worked very well for me.  I did have one minor problem, and I'm not sure if it is the fault of the recipe or of me.  While baking, some of the cookies got air bubbles on the surface of the cookies. These pretty much deflated while cooling, but some were hard to cover with the thin icing that I used.  Otherwise, the dough was easy to work with and had a great flavor with the addition of the cream cheese.  I would most definitely give this recipe another shot!

The flavor of this cookie was good.  It was rich but bordering on a bit heavy.  I used 1/2 butter and 1/2 margarine and cut them and froze them for a few minutes prior to baking.  They held their shape very well but were soooo delicate when I went to move them/icing them that a lost several.  That being said I ate at least 2 and could have eaten more but they are quite rich.  Mixed reviews on this-taste was good but I might need to try again to see if I can get a more durable cookie.

wow.  these cookies are terribly delicious.  i made several variety of cookies from the same dough; i sprinkled colored sugar on some, melted chocolate chips on the top for the others, placed raspberry preserves on a little bit, and left the rest plain.  the plain one was the best.  you can taste the authenticity of the cookie.  and although i almost gave up because the dough was just too darn sticky, i'm glad the cookies didn't turn out to be too "floury" (i added about a cup more).  they were perfect.

This is a good cut out cookie recipe. Not too sweet, but good enough to eat without icing. I put red food coloring in the batter and did Valentine cut outs of hearts of different sizes.

These cookies are so great! Followed the recipe exactly, and they turned out absolutely delicious! Made them to bring to a holiday party. Perfect amount of sweetness for me and the other adults around. I made most of them without frosting, but the few I frosted were devoured by the kids. Definitely will make again and again!

Perfect!  I was looking for a cutout like I use to make with my Mom.  Not a sugar cookie recipe and this was it!  In my opinion this type of cookie is perfect for icing and frosting of the cookies.  It makes a nice balance of not too sweet.  I used the sugar cookie icing on this site and I also make a regular type frosting, for more frosted typed cookies.  Thanks for the recipe

A great cookie.  I added an extra oz cream cheese and doubled the vanillia and they were wonderfully tasty.  I made mine about half an inch thick and cooked until brown on edges it seemed to work great, cooked through but still soft in the middle.  I will always make this from now on for cut outs.

The name of these cookies really fit!! The dough handled so smoothly, and the taste was melt-in-your-mouth! It wasn't overly sweet but you could taste the cream cheese, like a sweet shortbread taste, similar to those Starbucks cookies. I will always make these from now on!!

I doubled the recipe as written and made  the dough ahead of time so  we could decorate later. To store dough I divided into sections and flattened between parchment.  Dough rolled out well and cut easily and has a TERRIFIC flavor! Softer taste than a sugar cookie. Well worth making royal icing for.

wonderful recipe for fancy cookies.  I used Chef Alan (Global Sugar Art) Shiny Cookie Glaze recipe for the icing.  These cookies hold their shape while they cook, they don't spread out all over, they also have a mellow flavor that is good but allows a lovely glaze (I like to flavor mine almond) to shine. 
The dough stores well in the fridge allowing me to bake at my leisure.
A great recipe.

I followed this recipe exactly and these turned out amazingly well.  I would suggest not refrigerating so long - my dough te next morning was rock solid and I had to wait several hours before I  could roll it out.  Maybe just an hour or two in the fridge next time would be sufficient.  The cookies themselves are incredible.  They hold the cookie cutter shape very well.  I had to try one before I got a chance to frost them and they are great even without anything on them.  Next time I think I'll try MIRABLUE's sugggestion for the frosting.

Good recipe. I doubled the vanilla to suit my tastes. I refrigerated the dough overnight and found i had to let it sit out 2 hours before i could roll it out. These cookies aren't very sweet on their own but once they're dressed up with icing I thought it was a perfect balance between the cream cheese cookie and sugary icing.

I’ve been using this recipe for years so I figure it’s time to review and let others know how amazing they are! This is the perfect cut out cookie. The flavor is delicious and it holds its shape perfectly. I roll them pretty thick to get a nice crispy yet chewy cookie. I make mine with King Arthur gluten free flour and they come great. This dough holds up well to making cookie pops on a stick too. I have decorated them and then tied them in cellophane bags for Easter. I personally do not chill the dough overnight. Just long enough to be able to roll it. Otherwise it’s hard as a rock and you have to bring it back to temp anyway. Enjoy!

These are the best cutout cookies I've ever baked, so glad I found this recipe a couple years ago, they are my glamdaughters fave cookie and every one else that tries them too.  Thank you for sharing.  I make them at least once a month for the grandies.  I'm making them again today.  Tried to post a picture...wouldn't let me.

I have a few important tips and tricks to these delicious cookies.Tips... 1.) Do NOT bake until golden brown! - They will be way overdone. You want to pull them just as you start to see light brown on the edges. I have seen way too many pictures of crunchy lookin VELVET cutouts. There should be nothing crunchy about something described as velvet.... 2.)Do not roll with too much flour. - Start with a tiny "test piece" and very lightly flour the surface. Lastly, do not add a bunch of sugar! The cookies are not meant to be like a cross between a shortcake, and traditional sugar cutout. The butter cream frosting recipie adds so much darn sugar....sometimes too much IMO., But I have seen beautiful examples of what they should look like.... the shamrocks, santa heads, lady bugs(all great examples!)... Anyways- I wrote a Short story!  LOL! These cookies are definitly worth it. Good Luck and Enjoy! These are by far my most requested cookie by friends and family. Beware--  done incorrectly- they are the most horrible cookie!

These cookies hold their shape very well. Because they do not spread or expand AT ALL, I recommend rolling the dough a little thicker than you would for normal sugar cookies so the baked cookie will be soft and chewy rather than a little crispy. They do not taste like sugar cookies, but they are tasty for a change from the norm.

This is a great cookie cutout recipe.  I make a sugar cookie every Christmas to decorate, but I found this recipe last year and loved it.  This recipe came out with a firm cookie that was easy to decorate and delicious on top of it!  It's definitely NOT a sugar cookie so don't expect the same sweetness, and I liked the taste the cream cheese lent to the finished product.  I usually use a basic sugar cookie glaze but this year I'm going to try dipping some in chocolate as another reviewer suggested!  With just 6 ingredients you get an awesome result.  Worth checking out!

We loved the dough and the smell coming from the oven, but we couldn't taste the cream cheese in the baked cookie. I thought for the extra money and time (the dough gets rock hard), making sugar cookies would produce similar results.

I used light cream cheese instead of regular. I thought they were very easy to roll out. Very yum. I used half icing sugar and half flour to roll out. Mine did stick to the pan a little though, maybe a really light pan greasing would prevent that.

I'm not the biggest cut-out cookie fan. I just needed an activity for the kids for Christmas. These were good/ok, not Great.  I thought the cream cheese was a little heavy for my taste, but overall, it was a decent cookie.  I added more vanilla to the cookie mix, and I think that helped a bit.

These were the tastiest and easiest cut out cookies I've ever made.  They were a big hit!  The dough was very easy to work with after being refridgerated over night and they baked nicely too.  The best part had to be the taste though-this recipe is a keeper!

I was looking for a cut-out cookie, something not too sweet that I could frost too and this was that cookie.  I used all whole wheat pastry flour and they were perfect.  Like other bakers I will now use this cut-out for every occasion that calls for a delightful melt-in-your mouth cookie.  Thanks so much for sharing.  All-recipes is my first site for recipes.

My husband's eyes got big and he said best cut out cookie he's ever had. He doesn't like floury cookies these do not taste like flour! YUMMY. Thanks!

These were a nice change from the regular sugar cookie.  I iced them and made these for a shower and everyone thought I bought them from a bakery.  I will try it with the chocolate next time as suggested by someone else.

These turned out great!!  This was a really delicate tasting cookie, not to sweet but still a good flavor.  We took these to a halloween party, and they went fast!

Yum!  Sugar cookies can be a litte boring.  This gave it the extra flavor I was looking for while still giving an easy to manage and decorate cut out cookie.  Will definitely use again.

This is a great cookie!  Since I'm not crazy about cutting out cookies, I will use them as a drop cookie like another
reviewer said.

Great cookie, not too sweet. The husband preferred them without icing, the kids fought for the ones heaping. I added a titch more vanilla than called for (I just pour it in). Rolled nicely. Were gone in 3 days.

These cookies were a hit at my daughters 1st birthday. I am even making them for my nephews first birthday. Since I typically do not like most frostings for cut out cookies I opted to melt real white chocolate (not the white "chocolate" coating) and spread it on the flower shaped cookies. The combination was wonderful and perfect for a little girls party.

I have been making these for years with my kids and now my grandkids. I make 3-4 batches and I have all 12 over for a day. They help cut the cookies out.  After they are baked, I set the kids up with several cups of powdered sugar icing colored with food coloring.  Give each one a small paint brush and let them paint the icing on the cookies to their hearts content.  It's a great day, lots of fun, and great cookies. They now start asking me just after Holloween, "when are we having 'our' cookie party!"

This was a wonderful cookie to make cut outs with! I had perfect results and not a single cookie had to be smooshed back into the dough and recut. :o) However, the cookie isn't very sweet but the cream cheese gives it a good "bite". We frosted these and you could never tell that the cookie themselves weren't that sweet. I'll make these every year.

Lovely light cookies; have just a hint of taste of the cream cheese.  These were a big hit at home & work.  Taste very yummy with the cream cheese frosting II recipe on this site.

These cookies fell apart to easy. Not the kind I was looking for. I'll stay on my search for the perfect cut out.

These came out perfect to decorate and had a perfect texture. My family really loved the taste.
