I just made this dip today and it turned out so good I wanted to share the recipe, but see that it's already on here! The proportions in my recipe are a little different: 1 cup mayo, 1 cup sour cream, 3 TBSP each of Beau Monde, parsley & dried minced onion & 3 tsp dill weed. I could not find Beau Monde at my local grocier, so I looked on line and found the ingredients for it:

1 tablespoon ground cloves 
1 1/4 teaspoons ground cinnamon 
1 tablespoon salt 
1 tablespoon ground bay leaf 
1 tablespoon ground allspice 
2 tablespoons ground pepper 
1 tablespoon ground white pepper 
1 teaspoon ground nutmeg 
1 teaspoon ground mace 
1 teaspoon celery seed
In a small mixing bowl, mix together all ingredients. Pour into a tightly closed jar and store in a cool, dry place. Yields approximately 9 tablespoons.

I had everything except the ground mace and white pepper, put it all together and the dip came out great! I have to admit that I didn't use a full 3 TBSP as I was afraid it would be overpowering. I served this dip with Lays potato chips, but tried it with multi-grain tortilla chips and really like it with those! I know it's a long review, but I hope you find it helpful! :)

I liked this. I only gave it 4 stars because I think it would have been better using fresh herbs. I didn't like the consistency of all the dried stuff. I've never heard of beau monde seasoning, and it isn't sold at my grocery store, so I added the seasonings to taste provided by a previous reviewer. I think I will keep this recipe, because it was a nice twist on your regular veggie dip. But next time I will use fresh herbs. This went especially well with the black and green olives and dill pickles on the veggie tray I brought to Thanksgiving tonight. I, like another reviewer, am trying to watch calories and used fat free sour cream and light mayo.

This is a really great recipe that will have your kids begging you for vegetables. Because we are now following a low fat diet I substitute fat free mayonnaise and fat free sour cream. It didn't hurt the flavor or consistancy one bit!

I have made this for at least three parties, served with fresh vegetables, and people go CRAZY for it! It is always the first thing that disappears. I always use low-fat mayonnaise and nobody ever notices. Be sure to let it sit in the refrigerator for a few hours before serving to let the flavors mix together - it makes a huge difference in the taste.

For this easy dip, it was not bad. It was not something my kids would eat though.

I didn't have Beau Monde so I followed recommendations for making it from another review.  this dip is  not suitable for vegetables, chips or crackers.  It was sweet and just did not taste good at all!

Excellent - I served this as a snack for our preschool class - all the toddlers loved it!  I did omit the onions for them though.

This dip is awesome!  I make this all the time to snack on with fresh veggies while I'm cooking dinner. I've left out the dill every time I've made it, but that's only because the first time I made it I didn't have any dill (one of these days I'll buy some).  I also usually add in more minced onion, only cause I love it.  Great to bring to any get-together!!

I'm sorry but I didn't find this to be anything special, and I followed the recipe as written. It just didn't have a significant taste.

This dip was perfect for vege dip.  Just the right combination of all ingredients. I also made the vege dip submitted by ccsick that has curry in it. My kids liked it better and were licking the bowl.  I liked both as they  both have distinctive flavors.

I think AR ate my review.  So I'll try again.  This is a pretty good dip.  Tastes like some store bought dips and is good to jazz up veggies.  Bf took it to a get together and they ate with chips.  They liked it--ate about half of it, and we ate the rest with veggies.  This is the exact same recipe as the Beau Monde dip on this site, though, so I'm a bit confused.

This is the best vegetable dip I have ever had.  A friend got this off the website and used it at a New Year's Eve party two years ago and I have been making it ever since!

This is super easy to make and delicous. My kids love to dip everything in Ranch dressing, but now they dip everything in this dip. Although it is great with veggies it's also super as a dip for fries. I've also put it on hamburgers. I do thhough subsitute real parsley in instead of the dry b/c it makes it more fresh tasting.

The trouble with recipes that call for additional pre-mixed seasonings such as "Beau Monde" seasoning and "Seasoning Salt" is that they include additional salt, sugar, garlic powder, etc., already in the main recipe ingredients. If I must substitute Beau Monde for other ingredients, I can't get the correct amount.

DELICIOUS!! I could't find Beau Monde seasoning- so I googled it and made my own. :) It was a hit at our BBQ with friends with fresh carrots and celery. We had a bit left over and used it instead of Ranch dressing for our pizza today and it was AMAZING!

Loved this!  I didn’t have the Beau Monde so just left it out.  You have to let it refrigerate as directed or it tastes like mayo so enjoy as we did.  We all loved it and I will keep it to use again.

I made this for the first time and had to make a second batch right away. This is delicious and super easy to make. Lawrys seasoning makes a great sub if you don't have beau monde.

I gave it 5 stars because my son loved it with all vegetables.  Husband thought it was very good as well.  I thought it was OK -- not my favorite.  After the flavors blended, I found it to be bland.  So I added another teaspoon of Beau Monde; that improved the flavor.
