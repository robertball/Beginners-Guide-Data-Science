NOTE: I am the original submitter of this recipe. These will not come out crunchy like a traditional crusted fish. They are low carb and do not use breading, therefore they have more of a baked and seasoned texture. I tried to have the title changed, but allrecipes informed me this could not be done and to add a review instead.  This is also tasty made with shredded parmesan (can be found with the bagged shredded cheeses) instead of grated. I sometimes add minced garlic or garlic powder to the seasoning as well.

I can't believe how good this was! Few ingredients, but it tastes like more time went into making it.  Tilapia, by nature, can have a very muddy or earthy flavor if you're not used to it. I don't understand why the other reviewer blames that on the recipe! I would make this again. To avoid a soggy filet on the bottom, I flipped mine halfway through cooking. I also added a bit of garlic powder. I really like that it's low carb - perfect for my south beach diet. I served this with some grilled veggies.

I really liked this. It gave the tilapia a meaty flavor. I wanted to just use a saute pan today, so I made it on the stove top. I put the olive oil in the pan before I realized it was supposed to be drizzled on the fish. So, I probably used quite a bit of olive oil. No problem, the fish was nice and crispy and no sticking. I sauteed it about 3 minutes per side on about a temp of 6 or 6.5 on my stove. It was quick, easy, and delicious. Only change I made was we squeezed fresh lemon juice over ours before eating. ty

This is a good recipe. Tweak the seasonings by tasting the dry mix first. The only thing I did different is to arrange the fish on parchment paper. This will crisp the bottom side without flipping it.

wonderfulness! modern twist on "shake and bake." sooooo easy to make. rather have this then blow $25 on some fish dish downtown over a bed of something pretentious. followed recipe except used cilantro bc i needed to get rid of it and it seems to be tastier than parsley. also, nice usage of paprika. very under utilized condiment if you ask me. wait you didn't. but i told you anyway. go make this dish and woo that hot chick you have wanted to ask out. she'll be dazzled and wonder why those trendy places don't have this dish.

Yes, it's fast and easy, but the bottom is soggy and until I put some lemon on it, it had an off taste.

Made this for the first time tonight and we loved it! I only had 1/2 c. of parmesan left so I added 1/4 c. of Italian seasoned bread crumbs. Quick and easy and it turned out great. One of my 3.5 y/o twins even said he liked it "better than cookies"! ;)

I have made this many times using both fish and boneless chicken breasts. The key to non soggy bottoms? Easy -- place a cooking rack on your baking sheet and place the fillets on the cooling rack. Ta da! No more soggy bottoms! :)   
Also, if you find the olive oil to oily in the finished product, you can use mayo or melted butter (just brush on fillets with a pastry brush), then coat with Parmesan mixture. I often cut back on the Parmesan and add in some seasoned bread crumbs since I don't worry about carbs all that much and the little bit you use here won't make much of a difference anyway. This does add a bit more crunch to the finished product as well. I also add a dash of garlic powder to the breading mixture. Just play around with this recipe and tweak it to you and your family's liking. :)

Really nice fare, for not much prep/cook time. Good for a work and school night. I halved the paprika, and added a bit of panko to the cheese mixture, however.
Delicious!

Great recipe for flavor but I do cook a little differently which makes a crispy crust. Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Heat a non-stick oven-proof skillet on medium heat (no oil). Brown fish 3 minutes on each side. Place skillet in oven and bake 10 minutes. Perfection every time! I do use parmesan, garlic powder, salt and pepper, but have varied spices according to my mood at the time.

Excellent!  I used this reciped for red snapper fillets last night and it was very, very good.  It needs a bit more zip for our taste buds so, as recommended by the originator of the recipe, I'll try some garlic and perhaps some tumeric and quite a bit more pepper next time.

I added breadcrumbs to cheese/paprika/parsley mixture (I'm not worried about carbs). It was by far one of the best tilapia dishes I've made. So delicious!

This was great! Made it for the family and they said it made them feel like they were eating fried fish (only without all that oil!)  I added Mrs. Dash lemon pepper seasoning to the mix and it was fantastic!  Thanks for this recipe it is going in my recipe box.

Tilapia not a good fish so I used Cod! It was fantastic with a salad!  Used freshly grated parm for best flavor and also flipped over for 10 mins to give the "fried" effect. Will try again with thin chicken and veal cutlets

My husband and I loved this recipe. Not sure what the other reviewer was talking about when saying it tasted like "mildew".  The parmesan and paprika give it a great taste. This recipe was super easy to make and best thing was, it called for only 5 common ingredients. I did not make any adjustments to the recipe, great the way it is.

I just made it! I added garlic powder and used lemon pepper instead of black pepper. We don't use salt so that was my substitute. I also turned it after six minutes. This is fantastic!! We love it and will use it often thanks!

My husband and I are working on eating healthier, which made this recipe a great find! I used shredded Parmesan, smoked paprika (because I had it on hand), and I added some garlic powder as well. Delicious! My hubby isn't big on fish, but he raved about this... and went back for more! I love that it's a quick & easy recipe, too. I'll be serving this regularly from now on!

I made this exactly as per the recipe but with one exception.  I used Dover Sole. 

This method was good if you are trying to cut out carbs but I typically add panko crumbs to the parmesan cheese to make it crunchier. You can also cut calories by spraying Pam on a foil covered baking sheet instead of using the olive oil. I would cut the paprika in half next time.



Any good mild fish works well with this recipe.  Also any fresh herbs add a nice flavor but fresh parsley is a good one too.

This recipe has just the right amount of seasoning. I used the grated Parmesan. I lightly seasoned the Tilipia with lawry's seasoning in place of the salt. I also baked it for 16 minutes which seemed to add more to the crust. Great recipe that I know I will make again and again in the future.

This is a great easy meal. Even though it tastes like it took forever to make it is really fast. I have made it like a hundred times and my family loves it every time. I added panko crumbs to mine tp give it a good crunch. Other than that its awesome.

I prepared it as written, but 2/3 of us didn't care for it (I think it was too heavy on the paprika for our tastes). My son loved it, however, but because he ate later than we did, I added a sprinkling of Old Bay, some bread crumbs and some butter to his fish - and broiled it for a few minutes after baking. I really like the idea of this recipe, so I may try again with a few changes. I have to say the fish looks great when it comes out of the oven. I baked the fish on a baking rack inside a jelly roll pan, which helps to reduce any sogginess.

I admit I did make some changes to this.  For two filets, I used 3 T. parmesan cheese and 3 T. panko to ensure a crispy crust.  I first dipped the tilapia in beaten egg, then in the parmesan/panko mixture.  And I pan seared this in olive oil to obtain maximum crispiness on both sides.  If you pan sear these, be careful not to burn them.  The crumb mixture will burn easily at medium-high heat.  Medium would have been better.  I caught ours just in time.    We served these with Tartar Sauce II, also from this site.  Very yummy and I'd definitely make this again!

I have made this so many times and I always forget to put in a review. This is the best recipe. I omit the salt/pepper and add garlic powder. We love this and eat it a minimum of once a month. I’ve tried it with fresh and frozen tilapia and it’s great either way. We like it a little more crunchy so I leave it the full 12 minutes. You can’t go wrong with this recipe - simple, fast and delicious!!

A real winner. Delicious. My son does not care for fish, but he was impressed. I rarely fry food so this seemed on the crunchy side to us. Our fav fish recipe! Thank you, France!

This was awesome! We are a low carb family, so this was perfect!!! The only changes I was I cooked it on the stove top in a mix of butter and avocado oil, flipping once the bottom was a crispy golden brown. Even my oldest daughter, who isn't a fish fan, loved it.

Made for a quick weeknight meal. As suggested by others, I did add some Italian seasoned breadcrumbs & garlic to the coating mixture, used shredded Parmesan rather than grated and placed on parchment paper to bake. It was a BIG hit...even my 5 & 7 year old grandkids ate every bite!

Ridiculously easy and packs so much flavor!  Do NOT use the cheap Parmesan (I'm looking at you Kraft).  Spring for the quality cheese and enjoy!

This recipe was very quick and easy to make. I made a small adjustment and used 1/4 cup of sun-dried tomato parmesan and 1/2 cup of regular parmesan. My only suggestion is to sprinkle salt directly on fish before pressing into parmesan coating mixture. My family loved this and I will definitely make it again.

Outrageously Easy, Quick and Tasty!
Made this tonight.  Ingredients List is short and simple.
Easy Prep and Cooks in a Jiffy.
Other than fresh parsley, always have these ingredients on hand.
Served it over asparagus.
Satisfying, Very Filling dish.
A definite Keeper!

I love this recipe. I have it about once a week. I dont use the paprika or the parsley. I add my own seasonings and i add about 1/2 cup of Italian seasoned bread crumbs. My mom brags about how good this recipe is to all her friends.

To think i was buying these pre-made.  This was sooo much better.  The only extra spice i added was some chives and a touch of bread crumbs, I baked it on 400 like stated turning one time, they stayed crispy! will make over and over!

After reading the reviews on this recipe I decided in order to have a crunchy crust, which I personally prefer, that while my oven was on preheat, and I prepared the coating, I brushed a cast iron griddle with olive oil and let it get hot.  I also used Italian bread crumbs along with the other ingredients listed. I dropped the prepared fillets on the hot griddle and flipped once half way through the cook time. Absolutely delicious. This will be a keeper for me.

As many other reviewers, I added garlic powder to the mix and then pan sautéed the tilapia.  Excellent flavor, and a nice crust.  As one person warned, do this over medium or lower heat as the crust can burn easily.  Three minutes per side was perfect for my fish.  DH was very pleased.

This dish is super easy to make and very tasty. I did tweak the parmesan mixture slightly - I added a little bit of garlic powder, salt and a garlic herb seasoning.

The parmesan I used was very coursely shredded.  It didn't stick that well to both sides, so I just spread it on top. Still delicious!

Very easy, very flavorful, and quick recipe. The only change I made was to add some panko crumbs to the parmesan for some additional crunch.  Just spritzed the filets with a little olive oil spray and then rolled them in the parmesan/panko mix and followed there remainder of the recipe. This is going into our dinner rotation for a easy weeknight dinner.

this is a good and simple recipe. i didn't mind that it wasn't "crunchy", i simply wanted the parmesan crust. i only made 2 minor modifications: i added italian seasoning to the parmesan mixture and i used a baking rack on my sheet pan, so i didn't have to flip it. the fish browned nicely on both sides with no "sogginess". a squeeze of lemon when serving does well too. i served it with wilted spinach and tortellini alfredo and the trio was awesome.

This was so good! Even my picky kids (4 and 2) liked it! I did add some panko bread crumbs like some reviewers noted (I didn't measure out how much, just eyeballed it), and I also realized at the last minute I didn't have any parsley, so I substituted oregano, and it was perfect! I also added a little garlic powder, because I love garlic! I served it over angel hair pasta, so with the added bread crumbs, not a low carb meal, but delicious nonetheless! I'm adding this to our regular meal rotation. I will note that the mixture yields way more than enough to coat 4 pieces of fish, even accounting for the extra bread crumbs.

This came out AMAZING! A true winner. I discovered it about 6 months ago and i have made it at least once a week every since. I have even  swapped out the chicken with tilapia. Outstanding, we LOVE it.

This was amazing! I used fresh parsley from my indoor garden and used Spanish paprika. I also used an olive oil blend from Subway, as that was the only oil I had on hand.  I followed the instructions as baked it accordingly. I baked it at 400 degrees for 12 minutes then flipped it and baked for one more minute. 
The fish was crispy around the edges and flakey and soft in the middle. This was really amazing. Next time I will probably serve it with an avocado creama on the side, just because who doesn't love avocados!!  Great recipe!

I'm not a huge fish fan, but this was edible for me and my hubby loved it.  I added bread crumbs and garlic powder.  I didn't find it to be soggy as some other reviews state.

Really nice flavor, really tender fish. I realized I wanted a little more "crunch" to my fish, though, so I also sprinkled some Panko on top of the fish before I cooked it. It was the perfect texture!

Maybe it was the type of cheese I used, but didn't taste the cheese.  It was soggy.  The one I left in the oven baking longer tasted better.

Since I was making this dish for two , I halved all the ingredients except the Parmesan and substituted melted butter for the olive oil.  I filled a 3/4 cup container with 3/8 cup Parmesan and 3/8 cup Panka crumbs and I added some garlic powder as many others had suggested.  I could have gone  with a 2/3 cup container but I wanted to be sure that I had enough.  I also cooked the filets on parchment paper and didn't turn them.  We loved it and it will be a staple in my menu rotation.

This was a hit with the whole family.  I did add a little garlic and onion powder, but this was quick and easy.  I used parchment paper, but it still ended up a little greasy on the bottom.  I will be making this again!

This was very good. Ended up cooking it for about 16 or 17 minutes at 410F, and it got pretty crispy. I did change the recipe a bit. I used ½ c parm, 1/4 c bread crumbs, 1 tsp paprika, 1 tsp garlic powder, and cilantro instead of parsley. Same process, though. I had three large fillets, and had a good bit of coating left over. It was quick and easy to do, and it turned out tasty, and a gentle flavor even with all the ingredients.

this is really good! i love fish but does not care so much for its fishy smell nor soggy type, i always think its not cook enough. 

i added a little secret to this awesome recipe, for the fish to be little bit crunchy and NOT soggy, I fried it first and right after taking it from the frying pan, coated it right away with permasan mixture. no need of olive oil. 

Thank you dinner was really good!

"Put this on the top of your list."  That's what my husband said after tasting this.  I added garlic powder and lemon pepper to the Parmesan mixture.  Baked it for 20 minutes on parchment paper.  The bottom got crispy, but of course the top didn't.  Next time I will turn the fish after 10 minutes.  I think fresh grated parmesan works best.

My family of fried fish eaters loved this recipe. I added red peppers because we like the spicy flavor and used a mix of finely shredded parmesan cheese and Kraft grated parmesan cheese. This seemed to help give the recipe some of the crunchiness other posters are concerned about. Also, remove the fish immediately from the pan once done. I made enough for leftovers and noticed the pieces that remained in the pan longer did get a bit soggy but that's because they absorbed the remaining oil from the pan. Overall, this is an amazing recipe! I couldn't get over how flaky and done the fish was after just 10-12 minutes.

Made this tonight. Fish was frozen, so used chicken tenders instead! Followed recipe exactly; just added a teaspoon of garlic to the mixture. Cooked about 20 minutes, turning them over 1/2 way through. They came out moist and delicious. Will make again and again. Will try with the fish as soon as it defrosts!

Only thing I changed was used Pollock instead of tilapia (Pollock is easier to find here in the U.P.) and it was AWESOME!  It came out tender, not soggy, and, as we make fish every Friday here in the U.P. I really appreciate this!  Thanks, LilSnoo!

Made this last night, following recipe exactly.  Yes, it's fast, but won't make again.  Since you use olive oil, I'll just pan fry with a few herbs-much tastier.

This was so simple, yet fantastically delicious! It was my first attempt at preparing fresh fish and it turned out wonderful. My husband gobbled it up and at first thought that I had purchased the fish seasoned like that (since that's what I normally would do). For those of you that just can't leave well enough alone and are usually itching to add/remove ingredients from a recipe, leave this one alone and make it as the recipe states. You won't be disappointed. Thanks for the recipe and making it so easy.

When I served my family this dish, my husband wanted to know where the tartar sauce was.  He took a bite and immediately said "forget the tartar sauce this is delicious as is".  We did not have any leftovers!  Thank you for a great easy recipe.

It was very light in flavor. Trying to figure out how to make it a bit more flavorful with the same ingredients.  But enjoyable and quick to make.

Very nice recipe. The changes I made were to use a combo of bread crumbs and parm as I only had a little left of each. Instead of just brushing with olive oil, I added about a teaspoon of horseradish mustard. Only cooked 2 filets for my hubby and I. Added garlic powder and black pepper to the parm/crumb mixture. Cooked it in a stoneware baking pan, no foil, just cooking spray. Flipped fish after 6 min and cooked the other side for 6 min. Very delicious. Thank you! I will definitely make this again!

My husband and I loved this recipe! I made a few changes. I used swai instead of tilapia because that is all I had. I also did not have fresh parsley so I used dried oregano. It turned out great. My husband loved it and he isn't a fish eater. I will make this again.

If you add some pankow bread crumbs, it adds carbs, but makes it crunchie. Increase bake time by about 4 minutes.

This was wonderful.  I made it for the first time last Friday and it came out great.  We have always enjoyed Tilapia as one of our meal time regulars, but I was looking for something different to do with it.  This recipe was exactly what I was looking for.

NOT CRUSTED AT ALL. Half the fish stuck to the foil. Good flavor but it was a MESS and looked horrible when serving.

Great!  Even my picky teenage son that hates fish ate it and liked it.  I changed it a little by adding Old Bay Seasoning instead of paprika, salt, and pepper (mainly because I had some on hand anyway). I also added the Panko bread crumbs as someone else suggested and it was crunchy and delicious.   I don't know if my pieces of fish were bigger than normal but it did take longer than 10 minutes to cook. I cooked each side for 10 minutes and then broiled it for another 5 minutes.  Will try this one again!

For me who doesn't like fish, this was absolutely great. Used Amnon fillet, and sliced yellow cheese because that's what I had. My kids, my husband and I all loved it. Simple to prepare and really tasty. 
I will certainly do this recipe again! :-)

Made this and loved it! So quick and easy to do from prep to finish. I only made 2 fillets for my husband and I and cut the ingredients in half. I put the thawed tilapias in a bowl, drizzled them in the oil, evenly coated, and then smooshed in the seasoning mixture by hand. Once both sides were completely covered, I cooked mine at 400 for 10 mins. Then I immediately lifted them from the foil (beware they can stick because of some of the Parmesan getting melted and burnt on the edges) and noticed most of the cheese on the bottom melted away. So then I smoothed some of the leftover seasoning down and laid the tilapia back down on top of this, and let it cool for a minute, whilst melting the cheese underneath it. They were perfect! No they aren't a crunchy crust - but they are Parmesan crusted.

This was one of the best main dishes I have made for my family.  Rave reviews from them.  I love the simplicity of ingredients, the simplicity of cooking, and the awesome flavor.  It will become one of my 7 main stay dinner recipes- great for the family, great for guests.

Solid recipe, my family enjoyed it very much. I had to cook it longer to get the crispiness we wanted. Other then that, this is simple and you can make enough to last you the week if you live alone.

Made as written.  I did flip them over half way through baking.  We all loved the addition of paprika; thought it gave them a great taste.  Served with baked potatoes and some steamed veggies.  Thank you for sharing, LilSnoo.

pretty good...i would definitely try it like I did...fish was cooked perfectly after 10 minutes, then about 1-2 minutes of broil.  I added bread crumbs and did mash the cauliflower and the extra bread crumbs with the mashed cauliflower were Awesome!...also did a dill sauce for fish from another recipe and THAT MADE the DISH!  So good!

***Try mashed cauliflower with lite butter instead of potatoes...Man its good!

This is an excellent meal. I paired it with some winter squash and baked potatoes. The only thing that I changed was add crushed croutons to the cheese mix. It made it so yummy and added a nice texture to the fish. This is a definite repeat in my house.

Really good. Adds great flavor to a relatively bland fish. Followed the instructions exactly and it was great. Be mindful not to over salt, as Parmesan is naturally salty already. Served with linguini in red pepper red sauce. Dang this fish took only about as long in oven as my pasta took to cook. Seriously my whole entree took me 15 minutes start to finish. Got rav reviews. Will definitely make it again.

This turned out great, next time I will cut down on seasoning. I only used blackening seasoning, with flounder filets also added a little bread crumbs to cheese.  Turned out way better than expected. Definitely will do again, possibly with halibut!

Great recipe, taste and it’s Low carb!! 

Next time I’ll try the parchment paper in case I can get it to crisp a tad on the bottom. 

Ultimately it was great and so easy! Husband and kiddos liked it too (two and four) so that was a big plus!

Great recipe! I substituted the parsley with cilantro and the salt and pepper with “Adobo” All Purpose Seasoning and added four garlic cloves smashed in a mortar (pilón) to the mixed ingredients.

This was super easy and delicious.  I want to tell you that I made it exactly as the recipe says...but the truth is I accidentally used smoked paprika instead of regular.  (Truly it was an accident.)  But it was very good anyway.  In fact, I'll probably always use smoked now.  Also, because the original  creator of the recipe recommended garlic powder (and because I just about don't cook without garlic), I added about a teaspoon of garlic powder.  It was very flavorful and even my picky teenager said it was "pretty good".  Win!.

I thought these were great, added some No Salt Seasoning in with the parmesan, also used my Oil Mister instead of coating the tilapia with oil.  Parchment paper made them come out crispier also.  Good to put in the fish rotation & my husband liked them too!!

I added onion powder, Italian seasoning,  and garlic powder to the Parmesan breading. I did a better job with the breading and it came out very well! Delicious, everyone wanted seconds!

I've made this many times. only I either broil it, or use a cookie cooling rack like another reviewer said to prevent a soggy bottom.   Who wants a soggy crust?  It tastes good brushing a little mayo on it beforehand as well.

Followed suggestions of other reviewers and cooked on parchment paper.  Did not get soggy.  Served with orzo and fresh herbs, salad, and sauvignon blanc.

While i love fish,  my husband does not!  I made it last night for Good Friday and i made him a plate..... after giving him the guilt trip for ordering pizza! He tried it and said it was the best fish he's ever had.  i have to admit i was highly impressed myself.  my filets took about an extra 4 minutes to cook but i think it's because my filets were huge and fleshy.  Delicious and so easy!  Wish i could get them to look as golden brown as the picture showed but the taste was perfect and the filets were flaky. He apologized for ordering the pizza because he loved the fish so much.  Used left overs today for fish tacos at lunch.  Thank you so much for this great recipe.  It's how I'll be making tilapia from now on!!

My family loved this.  Tilapia isn't my favorite fish but this came out well.  I do have a baking sheet with a wire rack, so both sides were well cooked.  Thanks for the recipe.  Very easy weeknight dinner.

I made this tonight for my kids and me. It was very easy and flavorful. My oldest asked for seconds. When I make it again, I will change the process so that it is more crispy by adding flour an frying it before putting it in the oven.

I prepped as is. I thawed Costco frozen tilapia fillets first. I had about 1/4 cup of mixture left (using the prep for 6 fillets). This was delicious and easy. Good for a weeknight meal.

I added some panko and saffron to the crust mix. I tried the suggestion from another reviewer and used parchment instead of aluminum foil, but a lot of the crust got stuck to the paper. Still good, though. Will do again.

It doesn't say so in the recipe, but it would be a good idea to grease the tin foil before putting the fish on. We really enjoyed it!

Super simple recipe that I was excited to make. I've made parmesan crusted pork chops before and they were a huge hit, so I tried this variation for Ash Wednesday. 

I was very disappointed though. The parmesan did not pair well with the fish at all, it just over powered the fish and had more of a stinky cheese vibe. 

I might tweak the recipe and try again though. I want to love this recipe, just not sure where it went wrong. I do love the low carb outlook this dish brings though.

This was a delicious tilapia dish and also very simple to make. The only thing I changed was I used dried basil instead of parsley because I didn't have any parsley. I would definitely make this again.

I’ve followed the exact recipe except paprika cause i dont have one at home. I’ve used Dory as I don’t eat Tilapia. And i also added garlic in the baking pan for flavour. My husband asks me to bake again!

In one word, "Boring." No idea how this could ever be rated as highly as it is as there are simpler, quicker, and frankly way tastier ways to make tilapia (e.g., pan sear). This has to be the most overrated recipe I have ever made.

Wife and daughter thought too cheesy.  I thought to moist, it was not very crusty but very juicy.  Would split the 3/4 cup cheese In half and add in bread crumbs.

I made the recipe mostly as written and it was delicious! I did add some Mrs. dash herb and garlic to the Parmesan mixture and I baked the fish for 14 minutes. I served it with a vegetable and rice pilaf. My family enjoyed it. Will definitely make again!

Someone asked if this recipe could be pan fried.  I don't like baking fish so I tried it that way. I mixed corn flake crumbs with the parm cheese. Only problem (slight problem) I saw was I coated the fish in olive oil then rolled in the dry mixture. Then I fried it in olive oil. While it did look a little oily, it did not taste oily. Very good flavor. Will make again, for sure.

I took from this the cheese, but combined a Satori hard goat cheese with flour to bread fresh haddock and sauteed it in a skillet in butter and sunflower oil. White pepper. Came out very crispy. Served with lemon.

Made these changes after reading the reviews. Goat is easier for me due to lactose intolerance. It was awesome! The goat cheese has a sweet note that worked well with the sauteed fish.

Have made this several  times  and we love it!
It is easy and fast. I use dried parsley as we didn't  have any fresh and it still is great! Gives a rather bland tasting fish a welcome zest and flavor!

I don't know if it's just fish, or tilapia in particular, but this dish (though tasty) wasn't very filling. It's great for diet or health advocates!

Oh my goodness!  We LOVED this recipe!
I followed some recommendations from other reviewer's and increased the spices.  I added panko crumbs to the mix and 2 tsp. Lemon zest.
Amazing, crispy.. (I used a rack in my pan so the air could circulate all around each fillet) and well seasoned.
Thank you for posting this recipe!

This was really good. I will be making again for sure. I think it will be even better with some Old Bay seasoning..
The only advise I would give is to pat dry the fish very well before starting to make the recipe. The tilapia fillets that I used released some liquid  during baking and that made some of the seasoning come of.

Made it just like the directions said. Our oven runs a little bit hotter so I had it about 375 for 12 mins and came out perfect. Will definitely be making again soon.

I have to say this recipe ingredients were wonderful, I think I had purchase a smelly Tilapia piece of fish, better luck next time.

I followed this recipe exactly and it turned out delicious.  Best way I've eaten tilapia.  It added lots of flavor which is what this fish needs.

This is amazing!!! Even my daughter who said she wouldn’t eat fish loved it!!!!  I usually can only eat fish with tartar, but this 100% did not need it.

My best friend and I are not big "fish" fans, but we are trying to eat healthier so thought we would try this. YUMMY!!! I did use shredded parmesan and I did turn it about half-way through baking. We both loved it!! Easy AND yummy!!

The only change I made was to add a small bit of Panko crumbs with the Parmesan mixture.  My husband said his fish was "restaurant" worthy.  Thanks for a terrific, quick recipe.

I'm sorry but I won't be making this again.  The cheese burned on the foil even after I sprayed it generously so the fish was stuck and hard to remove.  The smell while cooking was quite offensive as well.  All in all a waste of ingredients.

My tilapia was still a little cold from thawing, so I added 2 or 4 minuted, not sure which, but otherwise no changes. It was incredibly delicious.

Great quick and simple recipe. I'd certainly recommend some lemons to squeeze over the fillets, otherwise, the little bit of paprika and parmesan work well together

This dish was fairly simple to make and turned out pretty good.  The only thing I will change next time is the amount of parmesan added.  I don't know why but mine did not turn out as the majority of the pictures did, maybe I should try a different parmesan.  Overall, it still turned out to be tasty and I'll more than likely make it again in the future.

Delicious! My husband and son absolutely loved it. My son usually just looks at fish and doesn't even bother so i was surprised when he grabbed and ate without hesitation (probably because it looks a little like chicken strips). The only thing i did differently was mix the parmesan with seasoned bread crumbs to add more crunch and used coconut oil.

I added red crushed pepper flakes and garlic salt instead of regular salt.  Good tip on lining baking sheet with foil. It was moist and delicious and not soggy on the bottom!  I am definantly going to make this again.

The first time I made this, I followed the recipe to the letter... waaay too salty! This time, I omitted the salt and baked it for 3-4 minutes per side- perfect. Excellent recipe!

So very good!  I made a mistake the night I made it, that actually turned out to be a great idea for future meals as well!  After mixing the seasoning for the fish ahead of time, I accidentally used it to season my homemade potato wedges before baking!  I thought my meal was ruined, but rather than waste the potatoes, I went ahead and baked them per the instructions.  They were YUMMY!  So, if you are looking for a new seasoning to spice up some potato wedges, this one is amazing!!  I made another batch for the tilapia and it too was super :)

We loved this, and it's super easy! I added garlic powder and used cod, but those were my only changes. I didn't mind the bottom not crisping up. If you use shredded Parmesan from a bag (rather than grated Parmesan in the can/bottle), you can toss it in a mini food processor and pulse it good for a finer texture that will cling to the fish better. I will definitely make this again!

Excellent.  I followed fairly close except I didn't have parsley so I used cilantro (we like cilantro).  These tasted so good I will use this recipe again soon.

This is very delicious.  When I put the fish in the Parmesan/Romano cheese I made sure to coat both sides completely and when placed in pan I coated the top again with the mixture. It made the coating very cheesy tasting and when it was cooked I covered it to keep it moist, and it was. I would definitely make this again with just a little tweaking.  Paula R.  4/6/17

Truly as easy as can be! And really a 10 min prep ?. The only thing I might do different is put oven on a lil higher and or flip it for a lil more crisp. Truly a pleasant surprise, I'm not to familiar with tilapia. I've only tried it once before and fried it, but I like a healthier version. My husband wanted me to fry it but if I can get it crispy I think he will enjoy it just fine, he still wanted an extra helping and liked the flavor. This was truly a quick easy dinner. As I put it in the oven I pulled out a head of romaine, craisins, feta cheese & cherry tomatoes,  that took care of the salad, had a pasta salad that was already made so it went from wanting to call for pizza to a pleasant semi healthy dinner in 15 max 20 minutes from decision on what I was making- to the table!

Tilapia is a soft fish however it is cooked.  Went fishing for the in Florida and caught an alligator instead. Recipes was great, though I may try a light lemon rub next time...

Very simple, quick and delicious! Will make again. Thanks for posting!       Update 8/15/17:  Made this again tonight and made some changes. I added some Panko bread crumbs to the Parmesan mixture and left out the paprika. I also added some lemon pepper seasoning.  I like this recipe a lot more with my changes.

Turned out great!  The variation I made was to put the coated tilapia on a rack in a 9x13 ceramic cooking dish (since my cooking sheets were tied up prepping other meals).  It took longer to cook, but used a meat thermometer to determine when it was ready.  Served with roasted diced sweet taters (with garlic, onion, and Italian seasoning), and cooked broccoli tossed with olive oil and sea salt. Great meal!  Will definitely make again.

I had better results cooking this on parchment paper instead of the recommended aluminum foil. I also like to add a little bit of freshly grated asiago on top of the fillets after they've been "battered". 

This has become our default "don't know what to cook" dinner, because it is so cheap, easy, fast and super-yummy.

We found that the flavours and saltiness overpowered the fish. If I was to make this dish again, I would not add any salt.

I thought this recipe was just ok.  It was rather bland.  I would have preferred one that was more crispy.  However others added ingredients to enhance the crispiness, but those additions would add more carbs which I am trying to avoid.  I did not find it to be soggy, however, as others shared.

Just finished dinner and husband loved it! Needed something savory to break up the monotony of healthy eating. I never do anything completely to recipe, use them more for inspiration, so here are my mods. Doubled recipe since I was cooking 8 pieces. I added fresh cilantro per another review and garlic powder. Next time I will use fresh minced garlic but I was being lazy. I also added Himalayan sea salt and Mrs. Dash Table Seasoning for an extra boost of flavor. I def recommend setting oven on broil towards end of cooking time (I left in for about 10 min) if you want it to be crispier, especially edges (favorite part!). Enjoy!

Very good recipe, will make again.  I did add a little garlic powder as mentioned in another review.  I think it would have been a little bland for our taste.  It turned out excellent.

I have to say that I did not use tilapia for this recipe as I do not like it. I used all the ingredients but replaced the fish for cod and adjusted cooking time as cod can become dry. It was very good. However, I would use a tid bit less paprika and as a few suggested a bit of lemon juice and maybe try cilantro to see how it turns out. If you prefer and can't live without garlic add a bit. You can't go wrong with those additions. Using Parmesan instead of breading is just fabulous! Try it with other types of fish it is worth it!

It was delicious! My 12yr old grandson, who "hates everything" told me that I have to make it again. It was moist, flavorful, crispy without being dry, and it didnt need anything extra for flavor. I would give it 10 stars if I could!

We are not big fish eaters but I am trying to add it to our diet a couple of times a week. This is the first recipe that both my husband and I actually liked! Super easy to make, light and flaky and tastes great! Will absolutely be added to our  favorites!

I made using Mahi Mahi - with a few changes; 1\4 cup bread crumbs, 1\4 cup Parmesan cheese, teaspoon lemon pepper, teaspoon dried parsley, 1\2 teaspoon smoked paprika, 1\2 teaspoon garlic powder, and a sprinkler of salt and pepper. Prep the same and baked for 30 minutes. Yummy!!!

It was good. It wasn't bursting with flavor or anything but I really enjoyed it. It was still moist and flakey, and the seasoning definitely didn't leave it bland. 
I'll make it again.

Ummmmm this is sooo good! The key to perfectly cooked fish is to NOT over cook it. exactly 10-12 minutes at the 400 degree should be fine. It should look plump and juicy and fork go right through it. No breading used only the seasoning listed and turned our scrumptious!!! I put some mango salsa on the side to dip and give it some kick, but I didn't even need it.

Used extra virgin olive oil, no "off taste" as previous posts mention.  Put it under the broiler to crispie it up when done baking,  delish!

I didn't care for this recipe. Too much paprika, which combined with the parmesan in an unpleasant way.

OMG!! SOOOO Good!  I was out of fresh grated parmesan, so I substituted asiago.  It was out of this WORLD!  My new favorite go-to for tilapia!  I'm going to try this on chicken breasts and on pork chops!  So simple and so good!!(Update) Made on porkchops, this is AWESOME! You can sub parsley for any fresh herb and the parmesan with any hard cheese. So good!

This was ok. It was really oily and it did not "crust up" as the title implies.

I loved this recipe. My kiddos loved this recipe!  I used a combination of freshly grated Parmesan and the park from the recipe. It made a nice crispy coating and I cooked it around 25 minutes. My fillets were on the larger side. I was unable to flip the fillets because they stuck to the foil but that was a minor inconvenience.

Made this for dinner last night & the kids went back for seconds. Added garlic powder to the recipe. I used twice as much fish and doubled everything except the parmesan. I did flip it after 5 minutes.

Absolutely delicious and easy to make, especially if you're just getting started with cooking! 
Just the right amount of flavor, and the dry mix works well with Mac n' Cheese (misjudged the amount of tilapia that was in the freezer, whoops~)

None of the flavors really stood out to me besides the paprika. I guess I was expecting more of the parmesan to shine through. I probably wouldn't make this again.

I did no shave paprika so I added garlic, salt and pepper. Also did not have enough parmesan cheese so I added shredded cheddar jack. Used Pam spray instead of olive oil. Turned out great.

Very good! Could have used more of the coating for 3 tilapia fillets. We used freshly grated Parmesan and it had a strong cheese flavor. Also we didn't have fresh parsley so we used  dried.

I am not a seafood lover, and this is one of the only types of fish that I will eat using this recipe.  Each time I try new seasonings.  Tonight I used the cajun blackened seasoning and it turned out very good.

This recipe is quick to prepare and pretty tasty.  My family doesn't usually like fish, but since Tilapia is pretty mild, I thought I would try this recipe out on them.  They loved the seasoning and they said they couldn't even tell they were eating fish.  High praise from my family!  I will make this one again... but, I think I will try using the broiler during the last few minutes of baking.  I believe a slightly crispy coating would be an improvement.

I added about 1/4 cup of crushed ritz crackers for some extra crusting and some Mrs. Dash Italian blend. I left it in a little longer too because my family likes it kinda crispy. It was excellent!

Great recipe!! Changed it up a bit. I seasoned my fish with Chef Paul Prudhommes's Blackened Redfish Magic. It was awesome!

I've been making this for years and love it! Instead of bake I broil the fish. First with just salt and pepper. Remove from oven, put the coating of spices and Parmesan on, then return to the broiler. Them come out so good and not soggy at all!

I would cook 15 minutes next time. My fish was perfect on the edges, but the middle was a bit undercooked. I used Italian seasoning instead of parsley and added garlic salt. We liked it a lot!

I changed the original a bit based on a few things that I read in other reviews. I made two fillets not four so I grated 1/4 cup parmesan cheese and mixed it with 1/4 cup garlic & herb bread crumbs, used two teaspoons of "seafood magic" spice blend (because it contained most of the spices on the original mixed with what people said they added) and a tablespoon of dried parsley. I baked it on a cooling rack on a baking sheet (based on something I read) and it was crispy on top and bottom. I finished it with lemon juice once out of the oven and it was amazing. 
My 3 and 5 yr old both complained about having fish before dinner and both said it was the best dinner they ever had after word. Clean plates and smiles all around! They asked me to make it again soon and I definitely will. I served it with green beans and cottage cheese. Thanks for the great recipe, skeptical fish eaters loved it!

These. Are. AMAZING. My fish-hating room-mate AND my Parmesan hating mother have both requested I make this recipe on multiple occasions . Foil on the pan is a must, though, unless you want to be chipping the fish off with a very sharp spatula. Absolutely delicious!

My son described this tilapia dish as "aewsome".  It was very easy to make and made some minor adjustments- 1 tsp paprika and then added 2 tsp garlic.   It was absolutely delicious!!!

This is one of my go-to recipes now!  I add garlic powder to the seasoning, and I followed the advice of another reviewer to cook it on parchment paper.  It turns out great!  Add a side of grilled asparagus, and we have ourselves a delicious, filling meal that's very low in calories.

Super-simple.  Like other reviewers, I added some panko breadcrumbs and garlic powder to the dry mix, baked on parchment paper, and flipped the fish halfway through.  It stayed nicely crunchy, though next time I'll add some citrus for a bit of zesty flavor.

I have made per recipe and my adds gave it a 5, as posted 3. I only use sea salt on any seafood. also added about 2 tbls of panko, I use lemon pepper, old bay season, and garlic powder. I put it on parchment paper, therefore no turning needed. Also for the last few minutes, broil for crispness.  It is in my weekly routine.

Extremely  quick & easy recipe! My husband loved the Parmesan cheese topping. I loved it because I'm trying to watch carbs. My 11 year old daughter actually asked me how long I spent cooking this recipe because she thought it was "really gourmet". I've already added this one to my favorite recipes.

This was very nice, easily and quickly made, and a good low carb  recipe.The coating mix was very flavourful. I used cod since I had it on hand and had to bake it for several minutes longer than recipe stated since it was thicker than tilapia. I baked it on parchment so there was minimal clean up and there was a very yummy  bit of sauce on the parchment when I took  it out of the oven, which I used on top of the cod for serving. A squeeze of lime and it was perfect. Thank you for the recipe.A keeper.

sooo yummy and so simple to make. could not believe how tasty this was - it really exceeded my expectations! I did add some bread crumbs, onion powder and garlic powder and i served it with a dip which made the whole dinner AMAZING. Restaurant quality! Dip I used (you must try this!): Mayo, lemon and minced garlic :)

I enjoyed this. Definitely going to make again...but I'm going to add a bit of chili for a tiny kick. Thanks for the recipe.

I like to eat and cook fish, I tried the original recipe and it was good. But the second time, I changed  the recipe.. I used basil oil, and 1/2 cup of Parmesan and 1/2 cup of Italian crumbs. The  extra Italian flavor is from the basil oil. Also I add some power garlic and little bit of salt. Everybody loved it. Great idea put the fish in the oven, so you don't need to fry and get too much oil when you do it.

My mom made this for me when I wasn't feeling well. She made a few changes and I devoured it! Instead of the grated Parmesan cheese she used a shredded blend of Asiago, Parmesan, and Romano. She added some Parmesan herb panko bread crumbs to the mix. We had delicious juicy fish and she did not use the oil, just sprayed the fish with cooking spray on both sides and pushed the coating on-of which there was plenty. She baked it for ten minutes and the fish was still very juicy inside, yet the coating was wonderfully crispy and everyone present loved it. The paprika adds so much. I actually gobbled the fish and scraped every bit of coating up that I could get from the pan. The way she made it was the best piece of fish I have had in a long time. I know that this was meant to be low carb, but the small amount of seasoned panko added so so much flavor and texture. Definitely five stars with those tiny changes!

I  made this last night for the family. My picky husband loved it and even went in for seconds! I followed the recipe exactly. I used more than 4 fillets so I cooked a little longer and I finished it off under the broiler for a minute. Came out great!

I made it just as the recipe was listed. 
I am not a huge  fan of fish but want to eat more, so this seemed the perfect one for me.
It was easy, and I had everything in my fridge for the coating.
The Talapia came out very moist and tasty and I will make it again.

After seeing how mushy the coating was halfway through cooking I turned the fillets over and let them finish up under the broiler. They looked better.. but the end results was an oily mess.

I make this recipe with Swai instead of Tilapia. It's perfect.  I use 1/4 cup of bread  crumbs instead of all cheese.  Everyone loves it--even the kids   In fact,  it's a stand by for people who happen to come by  at dinner time.  Many times I've made it on the grill.   Sometimes I cook the fish on foil rather than directly on the grill.  If it's  your first time cooking this recipe,  I would use foil.  This recipe comes with my 5 star rating!

I bought a bunch of Tilapia on sale, realized I didn't really like the flavor that much, then had to find something to do with the rest. So I made this. Tried it as-is and as a traditional crust; both tasted really good, but the flavor of the herbs was brought out more in the traditional crust.

Fantastic. First time fileting in a long time and first time with Tilapia. It's BONEY. Peel the skin off BEFORE you filet. Excellent recipe. I used half regular paprika and half smoked as well as a "spritz" of cayenne pepper. I used a teaspoon of Kosher salt which was a little too much. Remember the cheese has salt. 3/4 of a teaspoon would have been good. Yum, oh. - and I used Parmigiano Reggiano. My son and I agreed this would have been fine with frozen filets and a quick and easy dinner.

This is an excellent recipe. the first time I prepared and I did it as described. This time I followed some suggestions that were given by others. Used about 3 tablespoons of panko bread. this seemed to prevent the fish from being soggy. Also use some garlic and some Old Bay seasoning.

Excellent. I used flounder instead of tilapia.  Coated fish lightly with oil then sprinkled cheese and spices over fish and baked. Might have it again tomorrow.

Delicious! I had to make a couple substitutions- parsley flakes instead of fresh (I used about half as much as was called for), and I didn't have paprika so I used chile powder. I also added garlic powder. Quick, easy, so yummy! I served it with green beans and potatoes and lemon garnish. I will definitely make this again, I want to try halving the parm and adding bread crumbs, just for something different.

I made this last week and it was AWESOME! I followed everything and it was perfect. I honesty was not expecting this to be that good since I've tasted Tilapia in different flavors and I wasn't so crazy about them. I definitely will be making this again!

Really good!  Really easy!  Really healthy!  I did use the lemon pepper someone had suggested which I think did add a little more zip.  Also added some bread crumbs to the fresh parmesan for coating.  We had this with the asparagus and tomatoes recipe on this site, and it was just perfect.  So easy, I can make it after a long days work.  Aaaaaah!

Loved this super easy fish recipe!  I used cod instead of tilapia.  This would be good on many different types of fish!  I didn't have parsley, so I sprinkled in some garlic powder for extra flavor.  I followed the rest of the recipe as written.  My six year old loved it!  I finished it off under the broiler.  This made it a little more crispy.  This will definitely be included in my regular recipe rotation.

This recipe was delicious!!!!  I added cayenne pepper and Tajin seasoning  and I used coconut oil in place of the olive oil since I didn't have any. I also topped it with diced tomatoes that I seasoned with the same seasonings as the fish and crispy French onions. I will definitely be making this one again.

I've made this recipe several times for a picky eater who professed to hate fish. She now asks for me to make it. I confess that I do add a little panko to the mix and also a touch of garlic powder. Other than that, I leave well-enough alone. One suggestion I'd like to share is to line the pan with parchment paper rather than aluminum foil. Removal from the baking pan is so much easier that way.

I'm on a low carb diet & was skeptical about baking cheese with tilapia, but it was GOOD! I took the rest to lunch & co-workers were saying my fish smelled good. I will add a bit more cheese like the recipe called for ( I sprinkled it on).

I've made this several times and we love it.  I tend to use the recipe exactly as shown but I bake mine on parchment rather than foil and I have added other things occasionally.  I always have fresh lemons to squeeze over the fish for those who like to add lemon.  If you enjoy fish, you'll love this and it's so easy, you'll wonder why you've not tried it before.

To make a crisper preparation, I placed the fish on a wire rack, on top of the baking sheet. Perfection.

This was an easy recipe. I didn't have tilapia, and I had some mahi thawed out, so I used that. Wife loved it. The only things I did were to check the fish for doneness; because my filets were thicker(ended up with 15 minutes in the oven), and I thought there was something missing in the flavor, so I tried a little sweet and sour duck sauce on the side, and that really brought it up to speed. I'd make it again, with the duck sauce on the side.

This was a huge success!! I have only tried making fish once before and it was a fail! I was nervous about trying this. So happy with the results!!!!
Just made for the second time and was pretty much out of olive oil. I just sprinkled the mixture on top of the fish and it turned out wonderful again!!!

WE love salmon so have tried many recipes & thought we had settled on one that we preferred over the others...UNTIL...we had this one. It's the absolute  BEST, ranking right up there with salmon or crab cakes at any expensive restaurant). That & the fact that it's easy to prepare, makes it our go-to salmon cake recipe from now on.

So simple and it tasted amazing! I put it on broil for a few minutes at the end because it wasn't really Browning for me at 400°. Paired it with a cold pesto pasta.

I tried this recipe last night. It was very very simple. I did add garlic powder to the mix and swapped out some breadcrumbs( toasted some bread through it in the blender)  for some of the parmesan cheese. I used frozen tilapia and cooked them at 375 for 20 mins.  They were perfect. I did not have parchment or aluminum foil to line my pan and my fish were a little soggy on the bottom because of that. One of the other reviewers said they used cilantro instead of parsley. I bet that is awesome. We through some lemon juice over the top of them as well. The mix is just enough for 4 tilapia, not much waste, which is great. I might try pan frying these as well. This was a super simple easy to throw together meal. This will definitely be a staple.

Tried this tonite for dinner!  Loved it!  I don't add salt to anything, so I used garlic powder, my salt substitute, and it was great!  Thank you for a different variation for tilapia!  I'm trying to add more fish to my diet and this I will definitely try again!

Recipe is just great as written. If you are concerned about a soggy bottom, put the fish on a cooling rack over the pan.

This was easy to make, however, the flavor of the parmesan seemed to over power this mild fish. It was also too greasy for us.

Really yummy. My two kids and their friend loved it, it was relatively inexpensive and really easy to make. I added a bit of garlic powder and served with garlic mashed potatoes.

Have made this for years because it s quick and easy, sometimes using panko or bread crumbs and different spices just to change it up a bit.  This past year I became a widow and was finding it difficult to cook much less for one, but I discovered at the local grocery store frozen fish servings for one and they have 5 or 6 different kinds and all are good made like this.  The company is "The Great Fish Company".

Easy & with added panko it was a nice texture. Could've used more parsley & garlic powder that the author suggested in update. Probably the best baked fish recipe we've tried.

This recipe was quick and easy. This was my first time preparing talipia. I replaced the paprika and salt and pepper with garlic pepper and cayenne pepper. I also added panko bread crumbs.

I  have been making a very similar recipe to this for several years. Since we are not carb sensitive I do add a mixture of Panko bread crumbs and Italian breadcrumbs. And a wonderful tip is to add an envelope of dry Italian dressing mix to the cheese and breadcrumb mixture!! It enhances the flavor over the top! I also sauté my dredged fish filets (and any mild white fish works) in a little oil to brown the crust. Then I place them on an aluminum foil line cookie sheet in a 325-350 oven to finish cooking.

Really delicious! And healthy! Thank you for this great recipe!!

After reading the comments, I decided to add garlic and to turn the filets over at 5 minutes. It was delicious,  and I normally don't like fish. Even my son liked it, and he's really picky lol.

Fantastic! Tried it as written, using smoked paprika and it was delicious. We do like a little kick, though, so did it the next time using Penzey' s half-sharp paprika.... You won't need quite as much, but the flavor is superb! This is a dinner fave here!

SO good!! I have never posted a review, but this was so amazing I had to. I am trying to cut out red meat from my diet, although I grew up hating fish, I decided I need to start including it as a replacement. Since they had this fresh white tilapia at my shopping centre the other day, I decided to grab a pack. Came across this recipe yesterday since I had all of the ingredients on hand and decided to 'brave' it. Only change I made is that I cooked it on a piece of tinfoil on my BBQ at 450(despite it being winter where I live), as I currently have no working oven. So good that I want to eat it every day! No fish taste or even smell, was also a very meaty texture. Loved!!

This was a great recipe. We were getting bored with tilapia and this was a great change. I did add some French fried crispy onions and garlic powder. So good!

What a great and easy recipe! I used a cup of parmesan and about a teaspoon and a half of paprika. I added some garlic powder and just a hint of chili powder. I also added a dash of tarragon. I cooked it at 400 like it said and I did cook it on a pan with foil. I sprayed Pam on the foil to assure no sticking. I cooked the fish for 5 minutes then flipped the filets and cooked for an additional 7 minutes. Then I set the oven to low broil and cooked for another 2 minutes. This gave it a little bit of a crunch. And boy was it delicious! I almost ran out of the coating because I cooked 7 small filets. Next time I'll know to make a little more coating. Overall this was a quick and easy meal that will turn in to a meal that I will cook often!

This recipe was great! I eliminated the oil on the fish & pan seared it, using all the ingredients as stated.  I sprayed the pan with some oil and when it was done I sprinkled grated parmesan-romano cheese over each piece until it melted.  I served it with fresh multi-colored peppers and onion. Thanks for the recipe!

This was sooo good the entire family had seconds.  It's light and healthy even with the Parmesan cheese. I followed the recipe to the T no adding or taking away.  I wouldn't put to much salt on the tilapia because the paprika and cheese has enough in it. Also spray the bottom of your pan with pam if you don't have pam then butter will always work

Husband and I loved this fish!  I made a few modifications.  I didn't use fresh parsley, I used dried.  I used shredded parmesan, although that is what the author recommends.  I used original Mrs. Dash instead of salt and pepper.  I didn't line the pan with tin foil; I sprayed it with cooking spray and had no sticking.  I used my toaster oven on 400 for 10 minutes and it turned out perfect!  I will add that my pieces of tilapia were rather small.  

Great recipe, quick and very easy!!  Will make it again!  Thank you!

Instead of drizzling in olive oil I pretty much smothered and then covered with the Parmesan cheese, paprika, and parsley mix added lots more flavor to a fairly flavorless fish!

I am not a huge fan of Parmesan however hubby is and I truly enjoyed the flavor. The fact that there were just a handful of ingredients and prep was easy as pie made it all that much better!!  Awesome.

My husband and I loved it!  I did a little tweaking..:)  I added Old Bay fish seasoning, a dab of Lawry's, Panko instead of cornmeal.  I also brushed evoo on the fish instead of drizzling.  It had great flavor and cooked perfectly.

This was delicious!  I took the advice of others...reduced paprika by 1/2 and added a little panko.  I turned the fish over half way through cooking time. Yum!

I added a little old bay to the Parmesan mixture. It was amazing. The old bay was just what the recipe needed to give it a kick without being overwhelming. I agree with the person that suggested flipping it half way through to keep it from being soggy. I made this for my parents and husband and son and my mom went on and on about it tasting restaurant quality! I will for sure make this again.

Very good!  Might try baking and then putting under broiler next time for bit more crispy crust to it.  Seasoning is great though and did not even salt it.

I enjoyed it for a change as I cook tilapia once a week.  However, no one else in the family wanted me to fix it again.  Only my husband and one of my boys ate it.  The other two chose to fix themselves a bowl of cereal.

This was amazing! Today is my hubby's bday and he wanted Talapia. I am not a big fish fan, but I wanted to make him something special. I found this recipe and it was great. I think I have finally found a way to prepare fish that will work for both of us. Best part is I always have these ingredients on hand and it was quick and easy to make so it will be a great go-to meal. The only changes I made were 1/2 cup parmesan cheese with 1/4 cup Italian breadcrumbs and added garlic. I cooked in on the stove over medium heat. I didn't have the parsley, but didn't need it.

I'm not a big fan of tilapia but my husband loves it! I LOVED this recipe.  I add a little garlic powder to the mix.  I also like my fish a little crisper so I baked it about 10 minutes longer than the original recipe time.  Spray the pan the non-stick PAM and this fish just slides right off!

Awesome! But it may be because I added a few ingredients. I didn't have fresh herbs of any kind...so, I added grounded ginger, a little oregano, and some tarragon as well as paprika, salt and pepper. The BF loved it!!

Awesome, I substitued the paprika for cajun seasoning added chopped green onions and this was a delight. Super easy not to salty and the parm added the perfect flavor. Im not big on fried foods so all the calories from the cheese and salt were fine with me

I made this with plantains with cinnamon and brown sugar and pure vanilla, a salad with mango, cilantro, carrots, arugula, tomatoes and red onion. I can't believe how wonderful it all tasted! It was delicious! No need to go out to eat! Make it at home! Thanks for the recipe!

I cooked this for my husband today we got home really late and needed something fast. I come upon this recipe and wanted to try to because I was tired of the way I normally cook Talipia. it said cook it for 10 to 12 min so I did and when it was done I turned the oven off and left it in there for about 5 more mins while I finished my sides. when I served it to my husband he thought I had fried it LOL so when he tasted it he really like it. I gave it to my 2 year old and she asked for seconds and thirds. Thank you for this recipe

Good, easy recipe.  Any mild flavored fish such as haddock or sole can also be used.  Additional seasoning can be added to taste, like garlic salt or fine herbs.  I used 4, 4oz. pieces of tilapia, with 1/4 c. of grated parmesan and 1/4 c. of bread crumbs.  There was plenty of coating mix.  I also reduced the paprika to 1 tablespoon.

One of the best recipes I have made for fish. I did use panko crumbs and olive oil instead of cooking spray. I didn't put in plastic bag, maybe it might have been less messy if I had.

I should have halved the paprika, it was a bit much. Overall very good! I added garlic powder and I think that was a mistake lol! Also, I think other reviewers adding panko bread crumbs wouldve ben awesome as JUST parmesan was a bit too much as well.

When everybody says that it is quick & easy...believe them! I really couldn't believe that the whole time really did take 20 mins. My finicky daughter even loved it. That says a lot. I did not use any paprika, but used the garlic powder instead as suggested many times before. Thank you so much for a very quick & pleasing main dish.

This recipe is amazing! I don't have a lot of experience cooking fish but this was so easy and came out so good in 20 minutes total. I don't love a lot of fish but this recipe quickly went to the top of my favorite dish list!

Deliciously crisp and really tasty.  I didn't have fresh parsley and had to use dried; it still gave a hint of parsley flavor.  Fast and easy with no messy pan.
