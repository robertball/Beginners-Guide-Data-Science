Fantastic!  Used only one onion & apple cider vinegar.  This will be our new family favorite for pork chops!  I bet it even better the next day.

I made as written and left out the optional mushrooms only because I didn't have any on hand. This turned out good and I really liked that it used pork chops instead of a roast. This was a tad too sweet for me so next time I'd reduce the sugar and add more malt vinegar but I'm sure most folks would enjoy this just as written.
