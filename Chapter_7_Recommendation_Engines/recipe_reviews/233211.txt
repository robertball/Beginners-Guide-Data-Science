Quite tasty! My only complaint was not knowing for sure what size tortillas to use. I had 6" and it made 18 enchiladas with still a little extra filling to go. Much spicier than I had expected, but we loved that!

Right up my alley.. yum. I used a high fiber tortillas, Mexican cheese blend, and stacked the tortillas like lasagna noodles.. yumyum. Thank for dinner, Buddy. I made three servings but the full amount of filling.. used that in wraps with fat free cream cheese and slaw for work lunches

Yum Yum Eat ’em Up!! If blindfolded, never would have guessed that zucchini played a prominent role in this dish. Made as written, including the optional cayenne pepper. Used 10" flour tortillas. This made 5 bulging enchiladas which fit perfectly into the suggested 9" x 13" casserole dish. This healthy recipe definitely goes into the ‘Yummy, Make Again’ folder. Great job, ReneePaj.

My husband and I loved this recipe.  I made it the night before and we had it for dinner the next evening.  The flavors really melded together well.  My husband said this was a keeper.  I agree.  The only change I made was to make it with chicken instead of turkey and I sprinkled a little homemade taco seasoning on the chicken.

This is a super spicy dish that is full of flavor!  I love that it uses zucchini( since I have a ton of it in my garden!)and also liked that it uses ground turkey to make it healthier. Super tasty! Thanks for sharing your recipe!

This is a delicious alternative enchilada recipe that might rival your taste for traditional enchiladas.  If I HAD to pick between this alternative and my favorite traditional recipe, I would choose the traditional.  But I don't have to pick so I'll continue to make both.

I didn't really know what to expect from a ground turkey and zucchini enchilada, but, oh my goodness - we loved this recipe!  It was so flavorful and easy to put together.   The tomatillo sauce was spicy, but, perfect for us. I used taco size flour tortillas and cut a little bit off the top and bottom before rolling to fit perfectly in my baking dish.  Give this recipe a try!

Wonderful! Thank you for this delicious recipe! I love it has zucchini in it! I halved the recipe and broiled it get some browning on it after cooking, but other than that I made it exactly as stated in the recipe. This is a keeper! Thanks again!

I substituted diced, cooked chicken (to use up leftovers) and 6-inch yellow corn tortillas (what I had on hand).  Yummylicious!!

The turkey added a flavor that you don't usually get in enchiladas but it tasted fabulous!! I could taste the zucchini but it was faint and oh so wonderful. A complete 5 star recipe, I will be making it more often.

Made this last night with using the veggies from my garden including the onion, chili peppers and my own tomatillos. Super flavorful. Will definitely make again.

This is now my favorite healthy enchilada recipe!  My hubby did not even realize the recipe included zucchini.  He told me he really enjoyed them and to please not tell him the ingredients. LOL!
