This was a really good salad.  I think a little jalapeno would be and excellent addition.  It was crunchy, and very tasty.  I will definately make this one again.

This recipe made enough for probably 12, not 8!  It came out so-so; was much better the next day topped with Dungeness crabmeat moistened with wasabi mayonaise.

I had eaten Jicama before but never new what to do with it.  I love this recipe.  I Julianne the Jicama rather than chopped it.  Next time I think I will chop it, and make all of the piece about the same size.  Great if you are watching your calories 2 cups of this stuff is worth 156 calories.  NOT bad and GOOD.  You can also add spices to your serving such as cumin or a hot pepper to spice it up.   Almost like a salsa, but it never gets juicy.  Keeps well in the refrigerate, stays nice a crunch. An inexpensive dish to make and feeds alot of people.

Good though I was unable to use the main ingredient of Jicama. To follow the recipe makes a HUGE amount of food, would recommend cutting it in half for parties under 10 where other items are to be served. Definately more of a salsa type dish best with corn chips or the like but very fresh and crisp for summer gatherings. I very much wanted to throw in a jalapeno but they are of course not available right now. I think a ripe avacado and some black beans could serve as a substitue for the Jicama here if you, like me, do not have it available in your area.

Salad???  This would be an excellent relish to top chicken or fish.  It would be great as a salsa for tortilla chips (if you add a jalapeno), but it just isn't a very good SALAD.  It doesn't seem complete on its own.

I have to agree with previous reviewers.  Without a little heat, it's so-so.  After adding a jalapeno (finely diced) it was a 5-star, make-again recipe.  We made this to go along with Cuban Pork Roast I from this site, and liked the combination.  Then, leftovers!  Even better the following days.  This salad kept surprisingly well.  I expected the mangos to get icky after a day, but they didn't.

This was so delicious.  I halved the recipe, added a chopped red bell pepper for color, a little red wine vinegar to the red onions to mellow them and a tablespoon of Rooster Sriracha Sauce (organic from Whole Foods) to give it a kick.

I'm not a fan of mango, so I removed it and added a fresh jalapeno diced up! It turned out so yummy! It was the first time I had jicama this way and my boyfriend loved it, too!

I don't know if my jicama wasn't ripe or the mango wasn't ripe but whatever it was my husband and I did not like this. The taste was so so but the textures are what bothered us.

I made this for a quilt retreat and everyone thought it was wonderful.  I did add a can of black beans, jalapeno and cumin.  Would definitely make again. the girls particularly like the crunch of the jicama.
