Wonderful!!!  Family thought it was a special night because they said it seemed like I made something special with this recipe.  Will do again!  Only problem for me was ingredients list one pastry for a double-crust pie but when I got into making it, it appeared I needed both crusts.  Was that true?  I only had one crust to work with so that was a bummer when the whole family scarfed it down and had to have more!  Anyone know?  This is only reason I am giving it four stars.  Oh, I used 2% milk instead of whipping cream and worked well.

Very dry and bland. Needs salt to start with, and then who knows from there. A lot more cheese, a sauce maybe? We won't make these again.

Huge hit! I buy extra crusts because there is always more filling. However, sometimes I use the extra filling for omelets.

This was a keeper, a great way to use extra ham from Easter.  I didn't worry about the whipping cream, keep it healthier.

I made my own pie crust for this.  Wow - absolutely excellent.  Kind of reminded me of a gourmet version of hot pockets. :)

It was okay.  Kids wouldn't eat it and it didn't have a lot of flavor.  Needs to be doctored up beyond the nutmeg and parsley.

These were very good!  I did omit the nutmeg.  Instead, I added about 2 tablespoons of coarse, stone ground musard to the recipe.  This was very easy to make, and quite tasty!
