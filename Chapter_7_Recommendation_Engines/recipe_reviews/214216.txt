The only thing I did differently (here we go changing things) was to add some minced garlic to the recipe, the rest I did according to the author. My biggest problem with this was having to pause to go "mmm" after every bite. The taste was absolutely outstanding. The combination of port, blackberries and pork is a marriage made in heaven! My compliments to the author, this was genius and could easily be a "signature" dish in a restaurant.

This dish was fantastic, I'm not a huge fan of pan fried Pork chops so, I BBQ'd the chops and then put them in the blackberry sauce.  I also added a few more shallots, which gave the sauce a bit more substance. All in all, this recipe was fast, easy and delicious. kudos to the author.

Just had this for dinner. It was a surprisingly better than I thought it would be. I used some blackberry jam I've had for months and wine that has been sitting on my counter for weeks! Don't overcook your pork!

Fantastic!!Blackberries: what a complimentary flavor! I didn't have balckberry juice, so I used white grape. My super-finicky 11-year-old son even loved it! Thank you!!!

Great Recipe!!  I very rarely make the same recipe twice, just because there are so many different thing to try.  But my husband actually requested this be made again- we're already thinking up different dishes to use the sauce in.  I added 2 cloves of minced garlic to the onions, and used grape juice/lime juice & zest in place of the port wine.

My only "complaint" is that I would have preferred a much thicker sauce. Taste was great -- not as tangy as I thought it would be, but that's not a bad thing.

I was skeptical at first (as I always am about mixing fruits in main dishes) but it turned out great! Also I'm not old enough to buy wine so I had to substitute concord grape juice and it worked fine. I saved the extra sauce and am planning to use it on chicken tonight!

The blackberries PERFECTLY compliment the pork chops.  Everything went together.  We had awful trouble finding blackberry juice, and used blueberry juice instead.  If you had handed me a glass, and asked me to tell you what it was, I would've said blackberry juice!  Very good suggestion.  A step I will skip next time: The corn starch paste.  It looked like tiny worms were swimming in the sauce, and I just picked them out.  Didn't use thyme either because I didn't have it on hand.  My husband loved it!  Definitely a keeper.

this was a fabulous dish!  We couldn't find blackberry juice so we used pomegranite blueberry juice.  It still came out fantastic.  This will definitely be made again in the near future.

I also couldn't find blackberry juice, but i did find cran/blackberry V-8, otherwise recipe was made as written. I was disappointed, it was really just Ho Hum. Not bad, but not good either, not a lot of flavor, could have been the blackberries fault, maybe they werent' in season, idk, but I will not make it again.

This was absolutely divine! Like another reviewer, I added garlic to the sauce and it was perfect. I will definitely be making this again!

Very good! Used sugar free blackberry jam and a dry red wine instead of port but kept everything else the same. Husband wiped his plate clean! Will definitely make again.

Like many others I couldn't find blackberry juice so I used a cherry apple juice and we really loved this part of the sauce although it was a bit thin for our taste.  The whole blackberries were the downside of this recipe for us.  If I made again I'd cut back on the broth, add some blackberry jam and skip the berries.

Delicious!  Didn't have port wine so used Marsala - oh yum!  Quick and easy. I did double the shallots (we like them) and the sauce thickened up just fine, more like a glaze.  Will definitely make again!

Excellent recipe, the sauce was the perfect consistency, flavour, and texture to compliment the pork chops. I applaud the creator.
