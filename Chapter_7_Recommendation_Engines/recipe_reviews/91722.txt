OMG; My daddy loved his 53rd birthday; Easy Cholcolate Ice Cream 'N' Cake; I didnt have any problems with the cake being to frozen. But I guess I did take it out a little early to cutt it. It was absolutley amazing and he even cried. Which I love to make him happy; especially since he got back from Iraq! Its so funny but people on this website may not know how much the foods of the world bring us all together! I have a really good picture of the cake! I made mine circular! It was amazing THANK YOU SO MUCH for making our day even more amazing!

The cake was easy to make, and the ice cream was really gooood, but guests commented that the cake part was hard to eat because it was frozen. I had leftovers, so I tried taking the cake out of the freezer 10 minutes before serving, and the cake part was okay, but the ice cream part melted. Next time I will try making the layers early, then put it together right before serving time. (possibly put the cake part on top, then I can frost the and decorate the top early, just putting the cake layer on the ice cream layer and frost the sides at the last minute!)

This is a wonderfully easy recipe and even though the calories are out of sight, it's worth it.  Only thing that needs to be changed is to remove 1/3 to 1/2 of the cake.  Otherwise, it's much too high and just too much cake.

This is may new favorite!! The only change I made was I baked a chocolate cake instead of white.  Double chocolate is much better.
