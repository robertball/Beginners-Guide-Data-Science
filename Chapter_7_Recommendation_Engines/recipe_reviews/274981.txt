Very uncharacteristically,  I didn't stray from the listed ingredients at all for this one. However, I did alter the execution.  I used a meat hammer and pounded the breasts out just a bit. Not into cutlets, but just enough to tenderize them. Then I salted and peppered them, and seared them in a cast iron skillet. I followed the recipe exactly from there, except I cut the cook time down and checked them with a meat thermometer until they registered 165F. It took about 30 mins. Served with onion cous cous and roasted asparagus.  5 stars for this one because it turned out excellent, and I can't say that my method is better than the original instructions seeing as how I've never tried it. I changed it because (in my experience), searing chicken first produces a better final product after baking.

Fantastic recipe. Asiago cheese is not the cheapest of cheeses, but it was well worth the money because the sauce was incredible.
I have already made this recipe again and will continue to do so. One of my favourites.

Oh my gosh! This was so good! I didn't have lite mayo or greek yogurt, so I used regular mayo and sour cream.  I did take the advice of others and pounded the chicken breasts some and doubled the sauce to be able to serve over mashed potatoes. Used some chicken broth in place of some white wine also. Definitely a keeper!

This was fantastic! I purchased the chicken cutlets rather than trying to pound out the chicken breast (as others have recommended). It worked out perfectly. It was a huge hit at dinner. I served it with angel hair pasta. I only wish I had more of the sauce! This will be a staple in my home.

OMG So glad this recipe came my way. The only thing I did different is cut the breasts in halves n doubled the sauce ingredients. Other then that I made it w/exactly the same ingredients. W0W was absolutely great.

I thought I had asiago cheese, but it ended up being gouda, so gouda it was.  It turned out to be a delicious cheesy dinner that everyone thought was wonderful.  As is my habit, I cut the chicken breasts into medallions to decrease the baking time and for serving purposes.  The leftovers were perfect for sandwiches the next day.

I pounded out the chicken breasts to a more even thickness and seared it on both sides. As a part of searing it, I seasoned with salt and pepper, lightly coated in flour, battered in egg, and dredged in Parmesean cheese. Then I baked for about 30 minutes. My husband loved it.

The sauce was too thin. I’d make it again but would thicken the sauce before serving. I omitted the balsamic vinegar bc no one in my family likes it and the recipe was fine without it (the wine gave it enough “zing” even without the vinegar.

Oh my goodness - this is SO delicious!  I only had regular mayo and  Greek yogurt - but it was so worth the extra calories for this amazing dish!  I served it with oven roasted new potatoes and a romaine and fruit salad.  Incredible meal!

As others have mentioned, it's best if you tenderize and sear the chicken breasts before baking. I also found that a generous drizzle of the balsamic went very nicely over the top. Otherwise, it's great!

What a wonderful recipe, my husband couldn't stop commenting on how good it was. I had six large half breasts so had to increase the amount of sauce & cooking time but otherwise  followed the recipe as written. This will go onto our list of favorite recipes and into the menu rotation. Thank you so much for sharing! PS. To all who have advocated for buying a really good bottle  of balsamic vinegar, you were so right!

Didn't  have Asiago, used a mix of cheddar and parmesan. This would be good over pasta, rice, or a bed of spinach.

Delicious and easy to make!   followed recipe exactly, the drizzle of balsamic vinegar at the end is the finishing touch!
Next time I would double the sauce to have plenty for Mashed potatoes, or rice and leftovers.

Great recipe, it is a very rich dish. I did as other suggested and pounded the chicken to tenderize, battered and coated in Parmesan, and seared. Then I baked as directed except I did it all in my cast iron so I didn't dirty two dishes.

This was awesome! The only changes we made were because we didn't have the ingredients on hand; 
Such as yogurt - we used sour cream. And onion powder, we had an onion and finely chopped about a Tbsp and a half. So good. Can't wait to try again with all the ingredients. And the Balsamic vinegar... added just the right twist.

Outstanding. I have made this twice now and have not altered the recipe at all. I love it, and more importantly, my family loves it. This will be a regular at our house for a while.

Only change I would make would be to double the sauce recipe and thicken it will some flour and water.  Great recipe!

10/13/19 - flavor was good but too oily, I'd halve the mayo next time.  Otherwise good and tender.  Easy to prep and looks nice.

This recipe is so quick and easy and SO delicious!  Served over angel hair or with Parmesan cous cous and some sautéed fresh broccoli...yum!  This will stay in my regular rotation of recipes!

Chicken was tender and overall flavor was good. Sauce was very thin but I did use chicken stock instead of wine . I would try to thicken that up a bit. Everything else, very nice.

I made this as written except that I used Parmesan/Romano cheese instead since I have it on hand, and it was still delicious! Everyone in my family loved it including some picky kids!

Family loved it. Everyone preferred this without the balsamic vinegar at the end.
