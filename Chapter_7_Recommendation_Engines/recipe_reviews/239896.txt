I have always wanted to try this recipe and just got around to it. Figuring that the coating would be very delicate I floured the chicken before dipping in the egg and french fried onions. I also placed the chicken on a cooling rack, sprayed with non stick spray, above a cookie sheet so I wouldn't have to turn the chicken during baking and chancing damaging the coating. If you don't have a cooling rack try using sliced raw onion rings to place the chicken on. The results were favorable however I may add seasoning the flour next time.

This was delicious.   I made the following changes:  1) to the fried onions, I added 1/2 cup of panko bread crumbs, 2) I added Morton' s seasoned salt to the breadding mix  to taste ( about 1 TSP),   3) I marinated the chicken breasts in Italian dressing for 3 hours.  Very tasty, I loved it and so did my husband.

I've been making this for years.  It's a family favorite and I'm always asked to make my Crunchy Chicken even when we're camping.  The only differance is that I add 3 tablesooons flour to the onions and smush them in a ziplock bag.  I season my chicken with seasoned salt, pepper, garlick powder and paprika.  I bake at 375 for 30 min covered and then uncover and bake for additional 10-15, goota watch it closely to make sure it doesn;t burn the crust.

We all loved the coating of these crushed onions.  I was concerned though that the recipe might be a bit plain without any other seasoning, so I cut the chicken breasts into large chunks and marinated them for about 30 minutes in a mix of Lipton savory herb & garlic soup mix and a couple tablespoons of vegetable oil.  With the vegetable oil marinade, I didn't use the egg as the onions stuck to the chicken just fine.

This chicken turned out perfect. I followed advise of others. I mixed crushed French fried onions, Italian Seasoned Panko, Garlic Powder, Garlic Salt, and Pepper in a zip lock bag. I mixed 1 tbls. Worchestershire Sauce with the egg and soaked the chicken in it.  Put the chicken in the bag with the crushed onions and Panko one piece at a time.  I baked it at 375 degrees.

This is an great recipe that i have made for years. Its almost fool proof. For an added layer of flavor try adding about a TBLS. Of Worcestershire sauce to the egg before dipping the chicken. But turns out wonderful just as written.

I followed the directions to a T but didn't look as good as yours. But it was yummy. I used parchment paper so it doesn't stick.

This was super easy to make. I did add black pepper to the crushed onion and it turned out great. Next time I will add some grated cheddar (or parm) to the crushed onion just to try something different.

I had a package of french fried onions that I wanted to use up, and had planned some kind of chicken for dinner, so this was an obvious choice. I felt like the chicken needed some flavour, so I made a marinade of buttermilk, worchestershire, and dry onion soup mix, and sat the chicken in it for a couple of hours. Then pulled it out and dredged in the fried onions, then baked in the oven. The fried onions got a bit too brown at 400*, so I would reduce the temperature to 350* instead. It was good and easy. Will make again.

I really enjoyed the taste of this chicken: crunchy and frenchy fried oniony on the outside and SOO moist on the inside. The only complaint I have is crushing the french fried onions. It was messy and they were very sticky. I'm thinking next time I'll add some panko breadcrumbs. I did follow the advice of others and coating it in flower before the egg and baked it on a cooling rack so I wouldn't have to flip it.

Tasty!  One egg was plenty for 2lbs of chicken, and we added some herbs and black pepper to the egg. Didn't measure the onions, just crushed them in my hand and patted on the chicken after dipping in the egg. Our chicken was pretty large and took longer than 20 minutes to reach the right temperature.

This is a fantastic recipe!  I marinated with Italian dressing and added just a few Panko crumbs to the crushed onions...and it tasted great! I also took an extra step of slicing the chicken breasts in half, lengthwise, so the meat was thinner and offered more crunchy goodness with each bite!  Will definitely make again!

I finally got it right!  The trouble I ran into in previous attempts was the chicken breast was too thick. This time it tried  boneless chicken thighs, and it came out perfect!

This is a very tasty chicken recipe. My modifications were as follows:
- first bowl: whole wheat flower for initial coating
-second bowl: egg bowl
- third bowl: the good stuff. I used equal parts french fried onions and french fried jalapeños. I put them in my Ninja and added salt, pepper, Cajun spices, dry basil and garlic powder. Pulse blended them until they looked just like the picture and put them in the third bowl.

I cooked them on convection at 375 and lightly covered them with a sheet of aluminum foil to stop the coating from burning before the chicken was cooked. When the internal temperature was about 150 I took the foil out of the oven. They browned beautifully and the taste was amazing. We will do this again, and again.

floured first, then egg, then onion coating.  Let sit in the fridge for a bit to set the coating.  Be sure to salt and pepper well

We are sold on this! Will make again, for sure. I used recommendations from other reviewers. I added a touch of garlic powder to flour and lightly dredged before dipping in the egg. Crushed the onions in a plastic bag and coated one piece at a time. Baked it on an oiled rack. The coating stayed on and no turning. Crunchy and delicious!

As others suggested, I knew this would need a little tweaking to add flavor.   I first dipped the chicken in seasoned flour.  (I seasoned it with several shakes of Grill mates  roasted garlic and herb ).   I than dipped it in egg with a few dashes of Worcestershire .   I than pressed in the crushed onions.  I baked at 350  until the internal temp reached 165.


Very flavorful and moist.   Next time I will try different seasonings to mix it up a bit.

This is a great recipe! I seasoned my chicken first, dredged it in flour, egg then the smashed onion crisps. I cooked it covered with foil and finished the last 15 minutes or so without the foil. Delicious!!

So flavorful and crunchy! Combined a few suggestions and the perfect changes are as followed:

-Dip in a flour mixture before the egg. In the flour I added paprika, pepper, garlic salt and a half packet of dry ranch.
-Add Worcestershire to egg. 
-Add same ingredients to crushed fried onions as you did flour mixture.
-Bake on cooling rack.
-Bake at 350 for 20 minutes.

This is a very easy tasty way to prepare chicken.  i pounded my chicken and marinated it in Zesty Italian Dressing for  a few hours. Crushed the French's onion rings (used caramelized version) and added panko, garlic powder, pepper,  Italian seasoning to a ziplock bag and put the marinated chicken in bag like shake and bake. Baked on foil sprayed with cooking spray on a baking sheet at 400 degrees for 25 -30 minutes. Super easy and using plastic bag for marinating and shaking made for simple clean up.

I followed some of the suggestions of other folks who made it: seasoned the flour with garlic salt and pepper, used baggies to shake up the ingredients, baked on a cooling rack inside of a baking sheet for cooking the chicken evenly and not needing to turn it. Husband loved it!

This was very tasty. My husband he would eat again in a heartbeat. I didn’t have any eggs on hand, so I used mayo instead. I seasoned my mayo with garlic powder, onion powder, and some Omaha seasoning. I brushed each chicken breast with a thin layer of mayo and then breaded it with the French onions. The breading was very crunchy when it came out of the oven.

I've made this twice now. The first time I followed the recipe exactly and it was good but not as oniony as I thought it would be. When I made it again today I mixed in Italian breadcrumbs as well onion powder, garlic powder,  salt and Italian seasoning It was definitely much more flavor full the second time around. This is definitely one I'll be making again!

My partner loves this meal SO much, he tells all our friends and then when they come over for dinner they ask for the recipe. Simple, easy and I love to serve it with a lemon wedge and jasmine rice. PERFECTION!

The 4 star rating is based on the recipe as written.  However, after reading the reviews, I sprinkled garlic powder, salt & pepper on the chicken breasts before dipping into the egg wash.  Those additions turned it into a 5 star dish.  DH loved it and so did I.  Next time, I will also try adding some parmesan cheese, as suggested by a reviewer, just to see what I think.   I do suggest that you pound the breasts flat if they are very thick so it won't take so long to cook the chicken.  I didn't do that and it took quite a while for the chicken to reach the desired internal temperature.  

My daughter loves French Fried Onions and can eat them right out of the package so, I intend to send her this recipe or to fix it for her next time I am in Dallas to visit.  Thank you for the recipe, Janine S.!

This was a great recipe. I did follow the other changes. I mixed the onions with Panko Bread Crumb's. I beat the cutlets so they were thinner then dredged them in flour then egg, then in the Panko and onion mixture. I also followed  another users ideas and let them sit in the fridge for 20 minutes. I then baked them in the oven on a cooling rack so I didn't have to flip them. They turned out awesome and juicy. My whole family loved them, even my picky eaters. I will definitely make these again!

I really love this recipe, the only thing I would change is that the chicken breasts needed some flavor. The onion pieces don't really add any flavor to the chicken itself. I think next time I make this I am going to take a packet of ranch flavoring, some onion powder, and some garlic powder and mix that into some flour. Then I would do egg wash, dredge in flour mixture first, then egg wash again, and finally dredge in onions.

Just made this recipe for the first time. Delicious. I did add a few panko crumbs to the crushed onions and placed the chicken on  thick sliced onions (someone else had suggested this). Reheated leftovers in a frying pan...very good. This is a keeper.

Loved this recipe!!!! I just added some garlic powder and parm to the egg. Came out crisp on the outside and moist on the inside. Always looking for different ways to make my chicken and this is a keeper. Thanks for the recipe.

I floured the chicken before dipping in the egg. I added 1 t Italian Seasoning, 1/2 t garlic powder and 1/4 t pepper to the flour. No salt was added because of the salt already in the dried French onions. As someone recommended I added 1/2 Panko crumbs to the onions and cooked chicken fillets on raised baking racks. Because I handled the fillets less, little was removed. The family loved it.

Nice and moist on the inside and crunchy on the outside.  I added panko bread crumbs and also dipped in flour before the egg as I find the coating sticks better that way.  Will likely make this again with the changes.

Taste and texture were pretty good - could use a bit more bite I think.  I marinated in Italian Dressing for three hours and didn't bother with the egg dip.  I also cut chicken into smaller pieces to cut down on cooking time.  Best thing about this recipe - virtually no prep time!

Tasty! I followed the suggestion to coat in flour then egg, before pressing the onion crunchies but it's probably OK without that additional step. 
Cover the sheet with foil, and spritz a little oil if you're putting the chicken directly on the foil. 
... Could probably have baked or roasted a side vegetable at the same time, will have to keep that in mind next time.

Delicious and healthy. This will become a standard in the household. I followed other reviewer's suggestions and made these changes: Cooked the chicken on a baking rack to protect the coating. Added Italian Panko crumbs to the mix, along with garlic powder and Montreal steak seasoning. I'm glad I added the extra flavors and will add even more next time.

I made this chicken and it was delicious! The only thing I did differently was that instead of dipping the chicken in egg, I brushed it with a little mayo . Then dipped it in the crunchy onions which I had crushed.  Just a little shortcut!!

I cooked this on a rack as one reviewer suggested and it still wasn't crispy on bottom. Flavor was terrific and top had a great crunch. I will definitely try again and will try using convection to crisp it or turn it halfway through-or both! Definitely a keeper with a few modifications. It is mild flavored-if you want it spicy-marinate it awhile in your favorite.

It was delicious.  I used mayo in place of the egg and added salt, pepper, and garlic powder. 400 degrees is a little too high. Next time probably 375 for 35 to 40 minutes.

I've made this several times and each time, it is delicious...even left over the next day.  I do flour my salt and peppered chicken before dipping in the egg and onions.  Easy and delicious!

It  was ok. I would definitely suggest adding salt or pepper to the breading.

Whenever I make this recipe I use mayonnaise instead of eggs. It helps keep the chicken moist and the breading stick

We had 2 huge breasts that I pounded to be equal in depth all around. I did everything as stated but added a bit if Lawry's Season Salt and a bit of pepper. I also squeezed lime juice on the chicken after I had the crumbs and seasoning on the breasts. They sure were juicy and tasted so good with the crispy onions with some  Kraft Oven Fry for chicken added to it. I will definitely be making this more often.

This was delicious! I coated the chicken with flour, then dipped it in egg - finally coated it with the onions. I placed it on parchment so it would be easy to remove from the pan.

Chicken was full of flavor, moist and crunchy. I'd definitely make this one again!!

YUM! I followed other suggestions (I actually saw the same recipe on the French's fried onions bag, but they recommended added flour to the crushed onions). I cut the boneless skinless chicken breasts in half widthwise, so they were just as big, but thinner. Added spices to the flour. Dipped in flour, egg, and then crushed onions. I baked on 350 for about 18 min. Soft and delicious. No flipping needed.  I also made a honey mustard dip as another review suggested (also from this site). I would have eaten the whole thing!

Another dish that was done quickly for our picnic.  Excellent baked chicken for sandwiches.  as my daughter is allergic to eggs I substituted with yoghurt and added as well ½ cup of crushed carrots.  The children loved it.  Touche!

This tasted very good and was a nice change of pace when making chicken breasts for dinner. I crunched up the French’s fried onions while they were still in the bag, and I ended up needing the entire bag of onions (more than recipe calls for). Thumbs up from family -will make again!

I love this.  Ever since I found the recipe, I've made it 3 times.  However,  I use thin sliced chicken breasts, and I highly recommend using french's caramelized onion flavored fried onions instead of the regular.. gives it amazing flavor.  I also put a lil flour on the chicken before coating it. I was even able to teach my 14 year old son how to cook this.

Came out GREAT!. Made a few little tweaks: 
- Pounded out the breast halves to about 3/4" so they cooked evenly and so there was more surface area to coat  with the crispy onions. 
- Added a little salt and onion powder to the egg wash to give it an extra layer of taste.
- Rather than cook it right on the baking sheet, I cooked it on a rack on top of a baking sheet to the hot air could get all around it.

 Best baked chicken recipe I've had in ages. Was VERY moist and the onion flavor really carried through. I'll have to have this again soon!

I made this dish GF by using gluten free fried onions.  I added a 1/2 cup of GF flour to the mix, 1 tsp of seasoning salt, and pepper to taste.  I used chicken tenders instead of breasts for easier coating and quicker cooking.  I ended up dipping and rolling the chicken twice for each piece.  Any left over crunch and crumbs I put on top of the chicken before going in the oven.  I used used 2 baking sheets, the bottom one was a normal sheet and I placed the chicken directly on a pan with holes all over it to allow for fat and juice to drain (you can use a rack on the pan also).  These turned out great as well as being easy and fast!

This came out absolutely amazing! I did however add some Garlic seasoning salt to the egg batter and Parmesan and Romano cheese to the crispy French onion. I baked for an extra 5 - 7 minutes and it came out crispy on the outside and super moist on the inside! Super yummy dish!

I made this straight by the recipe. My 8 year old said " this is really good dad!" I crushed the onions in a ziplock bag. This is a family meal for the record book.

I made this recipe and it tasted really good. Only problem is the bottom of the chicken was a bit mushy. I had it on a raised baking rack, but still was a bit mushy. I will recommend to use the convection in the oven next time to circulate the air around the meat. Will make again for sure. Reminded me of shake and bake dinners.

Followed the recipe as instructed.  Tasted very good and I will make it again.  Except the next time I will add garlic powder to the ground onions.
Thank you for such a tasty alternative to bread crumbs.

This was fine, but with just my husband and I, it was underwhelming. It felt like Chicken Helper, which was fine, but will not pull this up again. I do see the attraction for families though. Thanks for sharing.

I will make this again and again.  I make several pounds of chicken breasts, cut into strips, baked and freeze much of it for quick meals later on.  I dipped each piece in flour, then beaten eggs, then into the crushed onions, panko bread crumbs and Alpine Touch to taste.  Then baked the strips on parchment covered, cookie sheets with cooling racks. (Very little clean-up that way) Great as a main dish, side dish or with various dips, as appetizers.

Our family enjoyed. I did make a couple changes by adding garlic powder, black pepper and a little salt to the egg mixture. Then sprinkled a little more garlic powder on top of the coated chicken. I baked at 375 for 40 min since my chicken was thick. Came out delicious.

Delicious.  Made with french style green beans and mashed cauliflower.  I did take a suggestion to add panko, but I also added shredded parmesan cheese.  Probably could use some time of gravy next time.

We made this recipe as written and didn't care for it to much. We love the French onion crunch things so thought this would work out well. I had an issue with them not wanting to stick to the chicken, even though I had dipped it in the egg. When we cut it up, any crunch things that were on the chicken, just fell off.  At that point the chicken was very plain. We won't be making this one again.

I really never fry anything, but was looking for a different main dish on a week when we will eat chicken twice. This was easy and delicious. Served it with old fashioned cucumber salad and cantaloupe chunks so it still qualified as "light."

After reading all the positive reviews. I was very excited to try this recipe.  I took several reviewers' suggestion by marinating the chicken with Italian dressing and adding some seasoning to the onion topping for extra flavor .  It was still fairly bland and most of the breading came off on the pan when I tried to flip it.  It also didn't "crunch up" as much as I'd hoped even though I lined the pan with parchment paper.   
At the end, it was edible but underwhelming.  Nothing I'm necessarily in a hurry to make again anytime soon.

I loved this so much and so did my parents and my brother. Would I make it again? Yes, It was so delicious and wonderful and if you make it just right and nice and juicy it will turn out so much better. I recommend this if you need a quick and easy dinner or if you just really like to cook like I do

Very easy to make! The only problem I had was that it was VERY bland. It was perfect for my mom, who loves things a little on the bland side, but I think in the future I'll exchange the egg for a garlic and olive oil mixture, and add some basil into the crushed onions.

I didn't think it was going to have much flavor, I was wrong. The chicken was very moist and did have good flavor didn't need any extra seasoning with salt. I will make this again.

FANTASTIC. I will add this to my regular menu. My picky husband loved it. I tossed in flour with onion powder, salt and pepper before the egg as others have suggested. I tried putting the fillets on onion slices to keep the crunchy onions looking pretty as suggested, while it did not work in that way, it added an awesome onion-rich flavor to the bottom, and moisture! Made with a salad and baby herbed potatoes. Like I said before, FANTASTIC!

Made it exactly as the recipe but sprinkled a bit of Pensy's Red & Black on it before popping in the oven.   I thought the time specified was too short but it was spot on.  Very simple dinner and will make again.

I was actually going to add this recipe if someone hadn't already it is that good! Just make sure to cut the chicken into tenders it doesn't taste as good if you use the whole breast. Use a lot of crushed french fried onions and put a little olive oil in the bottom of the pan cook as instructed no need to flip! This is the absolute best way to make chicken tenders they are  delicious!!

I love this recipe! It's quick, easy and very few ingredients. I do add a little mustard in my egg wash and I use the chicken tenderloins and use a meat tenderizer on them. It also reheats good for me to take to lunch.

Dipped the breasts in seasoned flour, then seasoned egg. Was expecting a great fried onion taste but was disappointed. Chicken had no special flavor. Probably won't make again.

It's my first review and I see this site asks if you make changes. I didn't make any. It had good flavor as is. I used cod and the pieces were thick. I baked them for about 25 minutes and it wasn't long enough. I even browned them for a few minutes under the broiler. I would also crush the chips a little finer. This was a first try and I'll make it again.

I used Trader Joes French fried onions for the 2nd coating, and dipped the chicken breasts in dry Bisquick,and dipped in beaten egg with 1/2 teaspoon each of garlic powder, Old Bay seasoning, and rolled in the crushed French fried onions. I took the advice of one review and used a cookie drying rack sprayed with non stick cooking spray. Delicious! I'll put this on my regular week day dinner routine. Very easy too!

This was very easy and very tasty!!  I used 8 chicken tenders, and just happened to have some of the Jalapeno fried onions, but was a little short on them, so I mixed up some regular too, to make 2 cups.  I used every bit.  They baked up very nice and crispy, but the chicken was very tender.  I will definitely be making this again!  So easy!!

Dipped in egg; flour; egg again; and rolled in crushed onion.  Need a little spice to kick it up a notch.

It was delicious.  Thank you for the idea!  I made it with tenderloins instead of breasts and used the new white cheddar french onions.  I also seasoned the meat before dipping it into the egg.

Excellent substitute for fried chicken.  Quick to fix and needs to be served as quickly as it comes out of the oven for best flavor and crunchy coating.  I like it cold, also, but prefer it hot.

Crunchy French Onion Chicken came out so good. I made garlic mashed potatoes and asparagus with the chicken. It was a hit and I will be making it again.

Juicy baked chicken, just needs some flavor for the chicken itself.  I will try some of the suggestions I found in the comments next time.

Turned out great!  I added Parmesan cheese to the onion strings.  I would bake the chicken for 25 minutes next time.

Yes I will make it again. I may try mayo instead of egg for sticking the onions to the chicken next time, but it was great as is.

pound out the chicken a little.  Coat the chicken in mayo instead of an egg.  Use Panko with the fried onions.  Coat the baking dish  with a good amount of butter first, roll chicken in butter to get both sides.. Comes out way more tender and flavorful... You'er welcome.

This was tasty, quick-cooking, and pretty simple. I halved the recipe for just my husband and me; and used my plastic potato masher to make the onions into coarse crumbs. The French fried onion coating did not cover the chicken completely, but was adequate. Served with a packaged gravy mix lightly drizzled over. Will make again.

I found this chicken to be a  bit bland but very moist. I will make again but season either the chicken or beaten egg before rolling in the onions.

No votes to put this in the rotation. Hubby and children all said they would eat it if I served it again but would never request it. I would not make it again as I felt the oil content of the Frenchs onions was the only flavor I could pick up.
