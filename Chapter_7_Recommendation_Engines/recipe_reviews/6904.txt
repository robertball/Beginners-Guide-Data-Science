The batter turned out a little dry but not bad.  Forming 'balls' out of the coconut mixture was impossible...the mix was too mushy to form into balls or push into the muffins.  Next time I would fill the cups only 1/2 full, place a lump of the coconut mush on top and then top with more batter.  Not bad, but messy to make!

Delicious taste and nice look, black outside and white in the middle, great for my friends. Just one thing: I think coconut quantity should be slightly lowered.

I followed the recipe exactly, made no changes what so ever.  I found these muffins to be incredibly bland as written.  Not enough chocolate taste (I guess adding chips may improve that) and I just found the texture to be dry. The coconut center was the only part with any taste.  I really won't be making these muffins again.

These muffins were pretty good when they were warm, or reheated. They were slightly dry when cold, but then most muffins are best warm. I omitted the almond center and added chocolate chips. I will add that my oven broke down before cooking these so I had to dust off my muffin maker and use it. Maybe this is the reason they didnt come out as good as I hoped, as I have never been happy with how the muffin maker cooks them.

These were ok and I didn't have any trouble making the filling. I made the coconut filling and chilled it, then made little balls and chilled those before I put them in each batter cup. The problem I had with these was a lack of flavor in both the muffin and the coconut filling. I think I should have used some sweetened condesed milk instead of water and powdered milk with the coconut and maybe more chocolate to the muffin batter too. Thanks so much for sharing.

This was sooo good!  The recipe was simple enough without causing too much pain.  I didn't have powdered milk, so I used 1 tbsp. hot water, 1 cup of coconut and 3 tbsps. butter (I should have wet my hands before handling the mix).  I mixed this and formed the filling for the muffins.  Cooked for 20 minutes at 400 degrees, a they were great!  I would recommend trying this and I will be using this recipe again.  Maybe for the office christmas pot lunch party!

I read from a lot of reviews that said these were dry, hard, and bland. So instead of oil I used melted butter, and added about 1 extra teaspoon of cocoa powder...and it turned out wonderful! I didn't have any coconut, so I just left out the filling completely, which made them even better, considering I don't like coconut. So overall these were delicious!
