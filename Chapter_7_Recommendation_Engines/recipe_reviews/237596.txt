Tried this twice and both times my family and I ate it up.  I used a soft, fresh goat cheese (caprino) both times.  The first time I made it with skinless thighs with a 1/2 cup of white wine in the pan to help with keeping it moist.  In fact it created a "sauce" that was delicious and a pity to toss out (which I didn't).  I should have added some potatoes.  I did add some other herbs because my goat cheese had them on top.    The second time I made it just as the directions state and preferred the first way as it was a bit juicier.  But nonetheless the goat cheese stays put on the chicken and even leaves a crust on the chicken.  I was afraid it would melt and slide off but it didn't, it hung on like a trooper.  The first batch my cheese was at room temp and the second time it was cold.  It had no affect on the outcome at all.  My kids liked it so much they literally licked their forks to get the last of the cheese.  Definitely a keeper!  Thanks for sharing.

Lunchtime, I'm hungry and have no plan except I have some plain chicken breast tenders I made last night alongside dinner for lunch the next couple of days.  Saw I had some goat cheese to get rid of, so I put chicken breast and goat cheese into the search tool and came up with your recipe.  I reheated my chicken in a 20 ounce ceramic bakeware dish at 350F, mixed the goat cheese with garlic and chili powder, and sliced 1/4 of an avocado.  Topped the warm chicken with avocado slices and goat cheese mixture and popped it back in the oven to heat through.  Came out PERFECT.  No presentation issues, either, this is guest servable IMO.  Thanks for sharing!

I did not have parsley, but added goat cheese and about 1 1/2 Tbsp margarine to 1/8 tsp of garlic powder, oregano, and thyme with a dash of salt.  I cooked chicken on the George Foreman grill, then topped with cheese mixture and broiled for 5 minutes.  Very tasty!

5 stars for flavor but the visual presentation was dull.  I followed the recipe exactly and ended up putting the chicken under the broiler for a few minutes to brown.  I would recommend a slice or two of roma tomato under the goat cheese, or diced tomato/bruschetta on top, to add color.   Very tasty!

the end result tastes good enough. but honestly...its just semi melted herb goat cheese on a piece of baked chicken. you could get a semi-similar result with a microwave :/

I made it exactly how it was written and we loved it! Even Granddaughter came back for seconds. Great recipe, so tasty and easy to do. We used regular goat cheese but next time I plan on using the goat cheese with garlic and herbs already in it. I like the idea of fresh better though but we'll see how it turns out.

I personally love goat cheese with fruit, so I used this recipe as a starting point. I first stuffed the chicken with a bacon, apple & onion mixture. As I smelled it cooking I remembered how I once had this amazing goat cheese and pear flatbread with a balsamic drizzle and I just had to make a drizzle to put over this chicken. It was fantastic. I can say that I did have some parts of the chicken that contained only what you see in this recipe, and it was definitely good. I simply added a little of my own flair. I'll be making this again for sure.

Super easy and tasty! Only recommendation is to stuff the chicken with the goat cheese instead of putting it on top.

SO GOOD! I added black pepper and crush red pepper for some kick, made all the difference.
