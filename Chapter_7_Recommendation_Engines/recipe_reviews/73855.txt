This recipe will work.  It was delicious, but I made a lot of modifications (hence 4 stars).  My husband did not even use syrup they were so good!  First, I substituted 1 1/2 c whole wheat flour + 1/2 cup wheat bran for the oats.  Second, I used 1 heaping c leftover sweet potato casserole instead of the plain sweat potato.  Third, to combat the thickness of the batter, I used an extra half cup of vanilla yogurt and thinned it a little more with some leftover apple cider.  I'm sure apple juice, milk, or water would work fine.  The final consistency was similar to traditional pancakes and they cooked fine.  For more flavor, double the cinnamon, add a pinch of nutmeg, and try some chopped nuts and raisins.

I loved this recipe, but more importantly, my kids loved it!  I used vanilla yogurt instead of plain, and it was really yummy.  I'm thinking of sneaking other "secret"ingredients in...spinach, anyone???

Mine were really terrific!!  I was glad I had read some of the previous reviews and and I think I manage to avoid some of the problems. I (accidentally) added a tsp. baking powder.  I did use oil (although Canola, not Olive).  I did not use molasses but used 2 tsp. Splenda.  Also, my batter sat in the fridge for several hours before cooking.  It was insanely thick, but cooked through easily.  It satisfied my need for a no flour/no sugar pancake and my kids had something they could put syrup on.  Only four stars just beacuse of the modifications, otherwise it would have been five.  They were delicious.

I enjoyed these hearty, flavorful pancakes! Without a leavening agent, it was hard to tell when they were ready to flip! Even when they crumbled because I flipped them early, they were wonderful!  Thanks for the recipe!

These are incredible!!! Try adding dried cranberries, 1/2 tsp of fresh grated nutmeg and vanilla yogurt (subst. for plain).

The yogurt makes the pancakes very heavy.  They do not turn out light and fluffy like a pancake should be.  The original recipe was extremely thick, and even after thinning it out according to some of the suggestions, I still had trouble getting the "pancakes" to cook all of the way through.  You may also want to add some more seasonings, as they end up tasting quite bland if you don't use syrup.

2 stars because they definitely need some work. The consistency is very thick and does not cook in the middle easily. The flavor still needs a bit of something to give it a little kick. I will update if I find the right somethings to change/add.

I tried to like these, I really did. I baked the pancakes for 10 minutes at 350*F after frying, to be sure they were cooked through. Overall, they were okay, but it really isn't a secret what they're made of.  Too much work for what ended up tasting exactly like sweet potatoes.

These had great flavor, but I agree with the reviewer who said they never really seemed to cook through.  Still good, but the final consistency was more french toast than pancake.  I might try baking the leftovers on low heat to see if they set better that way.

Delicious recipe. I didn't follow all measurements exactly, but they came out well! I didn't blend the oats and liked their thickness in the mix a bit better. I used Agave instead of Molasses, and I also added cinnamon. If you don't want to add a sweetner use vanilla yogurt or a flavor of your choice. Enjoy!

I don't know what happened with these. They were so bad I had to come back and check others' reviews--"Did this recipe really work for someone?" Apparently it did, but not for me.

This is the best recipe for sweet potato pancakes EVER!  My daughter is going through a picky eating phase and this is the only thing she will ALWAYS eat.  It's great that the pancakes taste great and are healthy.

Loved this one.  We didn't have rolled oats so we used 1 cup Irish oats and 1 cup whole wheat flour.  Also, added coconut milk until the right consistency.

I was really excited for these, but was dissapointed in the end.  I didn't think that they had much taste to them.  I did omit the molases, so that may have been the key ingredient.  I gave 3 stars b/c although i didn't like them, my boyfriend said he would eat them again.

I don't know what happend with this recipe. It may be that sweet potatoes here in Germany are different than what is available in the U.S.. Anyway, these things were impossible to lift from the pan, and they never really seemed to be cooked on the inside. The taste was good, but the hassle was not worth it.

I would not make these again...even with modification.  (I did't use the oil or molasses since they were optional.)  My older kids didn't even like the look of them, my husband though they were just "edible," and I thought they didn't cook through to the middle even though the outsides were browned.  The only reason I gave it two stars instead of one, is that my baby gobbled up two of them for breakfast!

These turned out good, makes a moist pancake which I prefer to a fluffy one.  Added nutmeg and a little water thinned it out.  Will make again.

just eh. I used the blender because we don't have a food processor, and I'm not sure the consistency was right. I agree with the others that they didn't seem to cook all the way. I wish they were better--- the kids didn't eat more than a few bites and they normally inhale pancakes.

After his tonsillectomy my son only wanted pancakes and this was the perfect recipe to get some balance of nutrients. Whole grains, fat, protein, vegetable, dairy... as good as a balanced pancake gets! I omitted the molasses because he was eating them with so much maple syrup but I will try them again with. They are soft and dense but I also added some extra water so they wouldn't be dry. I might try adding baking soda next time so they rise a little.

Mine was raw and doughy.

These were really strange. Very dense. Definitely NOT super delicious. they definitely taste healthy. I kept burner heat on low to cook all the way through. I like healthy food so they were decent, i put peanut butter and honey on mine and it made for an interesting and healthy lunch. But I would not make these for my family again.

Flavor was great.  Tried it with Oriental sweet potatoes and vanilla yogurt.  Could not get the pancakes to flip unless thick - but then the middle remained raw.  We are currently trying to make it into a quick bread with baking powder - looks like it might have better potential. Disappointing recipe overall.  Pancakes remain raw even after over-cooking!

This was good.  I did make a few modifications as suggested by others.  To make the recipe dairy-free, I changed the yogurt for applesauce.  The batter seemed a little thick to me so I added some apple juice to thin it down.  I did not add the molasses this time, but want to next time.  I did add a little honey though.  This is so yummy with maple syrup or honey.  Will most likely make again.

Tried this recipe and altered some of the ingredients.  First time I made it, I went exactly by the recipe.......batter way too thick.  Even added more yogurt, but this didn't really solve the problem.  Next time I made it I omitted the yogurt and added a cup of milk (skim) instead, left out the egg white.  Liked the consistency much better.  Next time I make it I'll probably fool with it again.  Even though I changed some things, I absolutely LOVE the flavor.  My husband is crazy about these.

I've never reviewed anything on here in the past 4 years I've been using this site, but these were so disappointing that I decided to take the time to do it.  The only modifications I used were vanilla yogurt instead of plain, and maple syrup instead of molasses. I didn't care for the taste or the texture, and like others had mentioned they don't cook up.  I tried everything to save the batch so I didn't waste the food (and time!), but it was hopeless.  What a huge disappointment.
