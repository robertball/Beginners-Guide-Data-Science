Yum! I'm making it for the second time in two weeks due to popular demand. The entire family loved it and it is good enough to make for company too (even your in-laws!)

I followed the recipe exactly the first time and there wasn't much to change. I did need to double the flour mixture (I ran out the first time) and to save time, I put the flour mixture into a sealed container, added a few pieces of beef at a time, and gave it a good shake. This was a lot faster than rolling pieces individually in the flour like I did the first time.

Make sure you brown the meat in batches don't crowd the cubes in the pan or it will steam rather than get the nice crispy brown crust you want. It will spatter quite a bit so use a splatter screen if you have one. I was worried about browning the meat too much as I thought it might overcook. Do not worry! The meat is soooo tender when the stew is done that there is absolutely no need to worry about overcooking it during browning.

After you add the cider, vinegar and water, wait a few minutes before adding the meat back to the pan. Let the liquids start to get hot and loosen the yummy brown bits on the bottom of the pan.

The recipe didn't specify whether or not to peel the apple. I didn't and the only thing that happened is that there were some pieces of well-cooked apple peel in the stew. Tasty, maybe good fiber, so whether or not to peel the apple is up to you.

All in all, a great recipe! Enjoy!

This may well be the best stew I have ever made and the leftovers get even better when reheated. The cider and apple give it a mellow sweetness.

Absolutely delicious. We followed the instructions to the letter, apart from adding some celery leaves before the simmering got started. The broth is so good!!!

This was too sweet for our tastes unfortunately.  I may make this again with lessening the cider called for and replace with bone beef broth. I think I may even try it with cubed pork instead of beef to see if that helps diminish the sweetness. There is possibility I might leave out the apple,or go with a tart tasting apple such as a granny smith. I really wanted to love this stew but not as written due to our lackluster tastes of sweet and savory.

Zing! We loved the flavors of this delish stew. I have an abundance of apples and cider from a recent trip to a pick-your-own orchard. I also just bought a whole beef tenderloin for a dinner party. The butcher trimmed the end and packaged separately for stew. I made the recipe as written, and well, it's just about the best stew we've ever tasted. Thanks for sharing!

Delicious! This is a repeat in our house. I use unsweetened apple juice when I don't have cider.

This was AMAZING! My husband doubted this after seeing the cider, vinegar and apples. But followed the directions to a T and it was a hit with the whole family! Sweet, bit of spice and very hearty. Definitely adding to our list of regulars!

This stew is amazing. It's very fragrant and full of flavor. I was worried it was going to be bland because the broth was so thin compared to traditional stews but I didn't even add salt and pepper at the table, I followed the recipe as written and the only problem I encountered was having to add more liquid to cover the veggies. But it was a huge success that had my boyfriend making happy noises as he ate. Can't wait for the leftovers tomorrow!

My family loved this and we are eating it fast!  I tried to not make changes- I couldn't find Jonathon apples, so I used Gala.  I used fewer carrots and more potatoes because that is what my family likes.  But the basics were left the same and it was excellent.  I won't make any other kind of stew after this!

My family loved this.  My old Beef Stew recipe called for a soup mix which we can't use any more as two family members are now gluten intolerant. (I dusted the beef cubes in Tapioca flour before browning.  It thickened up very nicely.)  This recipe is a great substitute with a mellow flavor and was loved by the preschoolers, too. 

I cooked this six hours on low in the crock pot and used apple juice as I didn't have cider on hand. The only thing I would do differently is to add a little salt.  We're not salt fanatics, but everyone commented that it lacked some salt.  Can't wait for the leftovers.

I followed the recipe and it was good, but we found it WAY too sweet. It’s been several hours and I still have the sweet apple taste in my mouth.

This is the only way I'm making beef stew ever again!
Few key notes to the recipe- I did not change it at a, just added mushrooms to my veggiesll! 
1- Double your flour mixture
2- Use grass fed beef stew meat and organic apple cider it makes one hell of a difference!!!

this is excellent with a few changes. Not having fresh apples, I used frozen apple slices, and added just a few more herbs.- rosemary, basil, parsley, and a bay leaf . This is a Gluten free household, so I skip  the flour- it still has great body.
Easy recipe that I will make again and again.

Really great stew.  We did cook the onion and celery with the meat, instead of adding later, and added a little garlic.

I followed the recipe on the ingredients, but I placed it in the crockpot to cook. I was having high hopes for this recipe. I love the simplicity of it; as well as, the idea of the apple cider. I was somewhat disappointed; however, on the taste being too "vinegar-y". One has to like vinegar really well to like this 'as written'. I WILL make this again... BUT to my personal taste, and I will lessen the vinegar quite a bit. Thanks for submitting such an interesting recipe...

Very good stew recipe. I added a little cornstarch and water to make it thicker, otherwise I followed the recipe exactly. I served it during the football game and got rave reviews; great served with foccia bread. If you like more of a hearty/heavy beef stew you may not like the sweet/tangy flavor of this one.

Loved it  I made it exactly as written and it was good. Did think it was a tad to sweet so I think I will use gala apple next time instead to reduce some of the sweet. I was worried after boiling the meat that it would be tough or dry but it wasn't. The liquid looked like there wouldn't be enough but I trusted the recipe and didn't add extra and all the liquid from the veggies made it perfect! Going into the recipe jar for sure to add into rotation.

This stew was amazing!! I followed the recipe except for I used a pink lady apple becuz its what i had on hand.I honestly dont think it makes that much of a difference as long as you are using a sweet not tart apple( also,peel it) the meat was tender with just the right hint of sweetness,even my picky kids loved it,give it a try!!

I made one change and two additions.  As I do not eat beef I used bone in pork.
I added, cabbage and my apple spice seasoning. 
This is a wonderful fall recipe!  Next time I will add pumpkin and pumpkin spice. Thank you for sharing.!raf

After the first hour simmering, the stew had thickened too much so I added another half cup of water after putting in the vegetables.  It thickened up again perfectly and my family loved it.  We’ll be making this again.

Good stew. I had lost my old recipe and tried this one. The only thing I would do different is use a little less vinegar. It seemed to overpower the apple cider flavor. I had to add ore cider to balance it out. My old recipe called for a couple of tbl sp so this was way more! But it turned out OK :-) I also like to add green beans and ground clove. Very tasty. I've actually made it two weeks in a row so there you go!

Wonderful flavors...the vinegar was almost too much, but it was just enough to make it interesting. I did make a few changes though, hence the 4 stars. I added about 4 cups of veggie stock I had on hand to make it more of a soup and which probably helped to dilute the concentrated sweet/sour flavors people were complaining about. I also stir fried all of the veggies and apples for about 10 minutes before adding to the stew.

Excellent!  I didn’t have cider, so I used apple juice, even though it is a bit sweeter.  (If you don’t like the sweet, use less juice and add some broth instead.). Like a few others, there wasn’t enough liquid to cover all the vegetables, so I did add about 3 cups of beef broth at that stage.  At the end, it was great. The beef was unbelievably tender.  Loved the unique taste the apple added. I will try it next time to with the cider to see if there is any significant difference. The broth is thinner, but the flavor was superb so I had no problem with that.

It's really good but a little sweet for my taste. Next time, I may try to add some crushed red peppers, adding more salt and black pepper to taste.

The only change I made was using beef broth instead of water. We liked it when we ate it right away after being made. But the leftovers the next day tasted a little too sweet for my husband. (He took it to work). Usually, it's better after having the flavors meld, but not in this case. I did use spiced cider, so maybe that was the problem!

Apple Cider was not in season, so we used apple juice, and it turned out really well.  This is a really great stew and has a sweet/sour flavoring to it. We LOVED it !!!!!
The only thing I will do different, the next time I make this stew, is to add more veggies than called for. There seems to be a lot of beef !!!  Otherwise ... this is really a great tasting stew!

I work at a cafe where I am a barista, but I also make soups a few times a week. I used leftover pot roast to make this one and when it was reheated initially it became too sweet but was easily fixed. The next time I prepared it I just used extra beef broth and it was perfect and sold out within a few hours!

Leaving out apples is the only change I make. 
Just the beef, potaotoes, celery, onion, and carrots.
I make this stew every winter...we love it!
Delicious!

Will absolutely make this again! Such a refreshing take on humble 'stew'. My sons, ages 18 and 15, loved every bite and my stuck-in-her-ways mother (age 83) said several times how much she enjoyed it. 

The recipe presented "as is" would be lovely enough but I did make a few changes, mostly to accommodate time, supplies on hand and a small kitchen. While the beef simmered on the stove top, I roasted the potatoes, carrots, onions and celery in the oven using a drizzle of olive oil - no extra spices - and cooked them until they were just tender. I added the roasted veggies to the stew pot for the final 20-25 minutes. I think the roasting added a heartiness that complimented the sweet/tart apple cider/vinegar base and it kept the vegetables from breaking down. I also substituted low sodium veg broth for the water. Served simply with homemade buttermilk biscuits, butter and jam. 

Just a quick P.S. - we have a coffee/tea brewer that can also use the single brew K-cups. I bought a box of apple cider cups to have for the holidays and am glad to have another use for them. The cider is not too sweet or fragrant so it was PERFECT for this recipe. Thanks for sharing what will be a new standard in our simple, hectic kitchen.

Yum, yum ... but too sweet for this Connecticut Yankee.  I added a bit of lemon zest and juice to temper this sweetness.  I also added more salt and lots of pepper to help boost the blandness through the sweet.  Also, just brown the meat, then simmer in the stew.  If the meat is overcooked, then it will make the meat overly boring and chewy adding little of the meat's flavor to the stew.

I was excited to try this recipe and the rave reviews made it sound so good.  I followed the directions and was really disappointed. Won't be making this again.
