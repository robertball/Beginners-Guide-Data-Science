My kids really enjoyed this as an after school snack. I had to make a few changes to support what I had in the pantry. I used instant vanilla pudding (3.4 oz size not sugar free) and vanilla yogurt. It made 4 generous servings that were gone in about 5 minutes!

This was only ok. I ended up using vanilla pudding and vanilla yogurt as that was all I had, and the shake turned out a little bland. It was mostly like you were just eating banana-flavored pudding. There is a somewhat unpleasant aftertaste too, because of the sugar-free pudding...
