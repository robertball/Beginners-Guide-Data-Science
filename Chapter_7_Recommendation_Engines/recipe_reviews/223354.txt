I call shenanigans! The soup is delicious, but that step at the end where you add butter/flour is completely incorrect. This is the basis for any b√©chamel sauce or gravy, but a cup of flour will NOT be incorporated into 1/4c of any fat. The ratio is normally 1 T fat (butter) to 1 T flour to 1 cup liquid. When mixed this way the "paste" will not take on any more flour than about a half a cup and even then it starts separating and turning into crumbles and will not blend into the soup without creating lumps. I tried this as written, even though I knew it wouldn't work and I am right. Even with a half a cup of flour, I had to add 2 cups of water, take it off the stove, use a stick blender to smooth the lumps, and then added maybe 1/4 of that into the soup. If you want to add this step, and it does add a lusciousness that elevates it from the standard lentil soup, I suggest 2 T butter and 2 T flour. If you toast the flour in the pan over medium heat while stirring before adding the butter, you'll cut down on time and have a better product. 

But again, the soup itself is really tasty and has the perfect amount of spice. I used both french and brown lentils and added a half cup of chives and extra parsley since I'll soon lose my fresh herbs to frost.

This is delicious, but definitely not a soup. I followed the directions exactly , using dried lentils, and after cooking for 1 hour, all the liquid had been absorbed. It makes a great side dish if you substitute chicken broth fir the water. I also did not use the butter and flour at the end, for obvious reasons.

Ive made this recipe for ten years. There are no shenanigans! (: i did, however, make a mistake on the flour. There should be a bit less, and there needs to be a bit more liquid than i wrote. Chicken stock is my fav, but reduce your salt if you use it! Thanks everyone!

I cut the cayenne in half and was very glad I did. You could actually cut it even further. I also added an extra cup or so of water and ran it through the ninja blender because I like my lentil soup that way. Other than that, 100% perfect as written. I did not use the optional butter and flour. This is a very flavorful, satisfying soup that just happens to be both very healthy and vegan. This is going right into the frequently used recipes file.

Nice flavors.   I used 4 cups chicken-vegetable broth in place of some of the water.   I also skipped the optional flour and butter but mixed in a couple generous dollops of non-fat greek yogurt for each serving.

I made this mostly to the recipe, except that I used less than 1 cup of flour after reading other reviews.  I used about a quarter cup and toasted it in a dry pan as another review recommended, then added in about 2.5 T of butter to make a thin paste.  It added a layer of richness to the flavor.  We had it for shabbat with challah and wine and it was very flavorful and satisfying.  The French lentils hold their shape nicely and make an attractive thick soup.

Thank you for this recipe.  I made it but didnt have carrots.  
Also, i made this with 1.5 cups water cause I was using a power pressure cooker XL and it cooked for 15 min. 

Came out lovely, did not  add the thickener it was great without.

I made this as written with the exception of using less flour/butter as many others suggested. Great combination of flavors. This recipe is definitely a keeper.

Mmm, I doubled this recipe and I'm glad I did. Mister Watson stayed out on the town tonight, so I had plenty and there was no rush. After reading up on a lot of Lebanese Lentil Soup recipes today, I trusted this one to be the backbone of my dish, making these adjustments: no celery (it's expensivish), red split lentils (3c. for 2 quarts liquid), no butter or flour, fresh ground red pepper flakes on top instead of cayenne inside, juice of 3/4 a lemon inside ( 1/4 saved for garnish), finally, for the 2 quarts water, I used about 5tsp. of this condensed vegetable bouillon paste that I got for the first time today.  It was easy to adapt this recipe to my tastes and glad I used it. Oh and it only took about an hour! Thanks!

Made my own chicken stock beforehand, which probably made a difference. Recycled the celery from the stock for the soup, but left out carrots from the recipe to fit my personal tastes a little better. I didn't have parsley, so I'll have to use it next time. If you do the optional flour mix, you'll end up with a gruel, if you leave the flour mix out, you might want to make some rice to make the soup heartier. I only used in 2/3 of a cup of flour but about 5 tablespoons of butter for the mixture, and the soup thickened right up. The cumin and cayenne pepper are delicious, but I can't really taste the coriander. All in all delicious, hearty and a great substitute for meat dishes, especially during lent. I can't wait to make this soup for my family!

I will definitely make this again. I made one minor change with respect to recipe ingredients. Instead of 6 cups of water I used 4 cups of vegetable broth and 2 cups of water. Not a big deal. The rest I kept the same. 

I did make two other variations with respect to cooking and thickening.  I wanted to try this recipe in my Instant Pot. I cooked it on manual for 15 minutes (but it took close to 15 minutes to build up the pressure before the cooking started) and then I gave it another 15 minutes of resting before releasing the steam. Please for one second (kinda wet) then release for the remainder of the time. The overall cook time was 45 minutes or half of what was recommended.

As for thickening, I skipped the flour (optional) and the butter (optional), and used an immersion blender to thicken the soup. It was wonderful!

I thought this was very good.  BUT,  unless you like spicy food, cut the cayenne pepper down to a 1/4 tsp. because my whole family thought it was too spicy.  And don't use all of the flour, maybe half.

After sauteing vegetables, I sauteed all spices with garlic and 2 T. tomato paste for 2 minutes just to release aroma.  For 1 pound of lentils I ended up using 8 c. chicken broth and 4 c. water which was needed to have a soup consistency.  Would make again!

I made this soup last night however, I accidentally totally skipped the butter/flour step. And didn't miss it. The only change I will make next time is double the vegetables and OMIT the pepper. It was pepper overload for our taste buds. Thank you.

It was very bland. I expected it to be full of flavor. I need to look for another recipe to add spices to it to make it edible. I was disappointed. It doesn't even say to use the lemons in the soup, it's more of a garnish.

My Husband and I both enjoyed this soup. I liked the lemony taste. He ate his with some crushed red pepper to add more heat. I also changed the amount of butter/flour to 2 TB each. The soup was rich and creamy.

My all time favorite lentil soup, it reminds me of the one my lebanese roommate shared back in College days (when her mom made it)! This time I also threw in some cube tomatoes, some potatoes (leftover and already boiled) and at the last minute a big handfull of chopped black kale. Delicious! The lemon really makes all the difference too!

Great flavor, but as another reviewer mentioned the flour/butter ratio is way off. I knew it would be, however, I followed the directions. I soon saw I would have nothing but a fried dough ball if I followed this recipe, so I successfully whisked in more fat.  You'll have to use at least 1/3 - 1/2 cup fat for that amount of flour (or reduce flour). Also, I used the right amount of lentils and water, but this did not come out as a soup or stew. It was so thick it was more like a lentil side dish. I usually use more like 8 cups of water, at least for lentil soups.  Would definitely make again!

I didn't follow the proportions exactly (the more carrots the merrier!) and I added some potatoes I had lying around, but the soup turned out fantastic! Absolutely scrumptious! Also, I didn't do the optional flour/butter thing. It seemed unnecessary.

So delicious, I've made this recipe many time but I use chicken broth, cut down on the salt to half, add 2 more cups of water (or it's really thick) and before serving I put in my immersion blender to get a soup consistency

Great soup.
I decided I liked it as is before the butter and flour so did not add them.   I used a mixture of brown and green lentils  due to what was on hand.     I made a homemade taziki to have with it.
I also did not have parsley so omitted it.

I thought it was great. I inadvertently made it with split peas, though, because I didn't have green lentils on hand and forgot what they looked like(I haven't cooked with them much LOL). Still came out fantastic.

I liked it, but probably would reduce the amount of pepper the next time.  It was a little too spicy for my taste.  I also cut down significantly on the amount of butter and flour blended in at the end, based on other reviews.

We loved this soup but I did make a few changes.  First off, I used a carton of vegetable stock and then enough water to make that 6 cups.  I also added 2 more cups of water with 2 tsp. vegetable soup base dissolved in it and I also added a large can of crushed tomatoes because this recipe does not have enough liquid for my taste.  I did not make the butter/flour roux because  after this simmered it was delicious just the way it was.  I also juiced 1 lemon and stirred that in after it simmered.  I will definitely make this again and again!!

Delicious. This time I only mixed up a  1/4 cup flour with almost 2 tbsp margarine because I was using 1 cup lentils plus 1 cup of 6 grain sprouted lentil mix that I had which contains some quinoa and rice and I knew that would contribute to some of the thickening plus I used an extra cup and quarter of water with 1/2 cube vegetable broth so I would not dilute the seasoning. Also used dry parsley since I didn't have fresh. This is a very tasty soup!

Nice recipe, but I'm of Lebanese ancestry and no way you need to thicken this with roux. And the recipe called for too much pepper. Lebanese food is not spicy hot. Lastly, you only need to cook the lentils for 30 minutes, unless you want them to soften into mush! With those three corrections you are GOOD!

I think this is an easy lentil recipe with basic ingredients that tastes great. The only thing that is confusing is some of the recipe steps. by Celery stock I'm not sure if they actually mean a celery rib or 2 celery heads. Anyways I used two ribs and it came out still tasting great. I didn't make the gravy.  I definitely plan on making this again.

Loved this hearty soup.  Such a nice bit of spice too. I used a no salt chicken broth for half the liquid required instead of all water.  Will definitely make this again

This came out amazing! Lemon not necessary but an awesome addition (delicious with or without).  I agree with other reviews that a cup of flour is way too much so I suggest using closer to half that amount.. maybe even less.  I made 5 of the 6 cups broth and it was the perfect amount of 'salty'.  Will make this again!!

I reduced the amount of cayenne slightly (for my kids' sake) and added a bit more broth after mixing in the roux.  will definitely make it again - DELICIOUS!

I followed the recipe pretty closely but used 1 can crushed tomatoes as part of the liquid, veg stock for the rest, and I didn't think it needed thickening because the lentils soaked up a lot, so instead I incorporated an avocado cream (avocado, greek yogurt, lime/lemon juice, S+P). Turned out fantastic!

I started this recipe and then realized the time to cook was too long. Soon, I will make the recipe AS WRITTEN and review that.  Here are the changes I made:
1C lentils, 2C water, all the veggies, all the spices, simmered for 30 minutes or so. strained out most liquid so it was not a soup, but a side dish. Good! Thank you for the recipe!

This soup is delicious.  There's one problem, though, with the flour/butter mixture.  As another reviewer noted, 1 cup of flour and 1/4 cup butter does NOT make a paste.  It makes a mess.  I tried it w/one half cup of flour which just made a bunch of unmanageable clumps.  I added a couple of cups of liquid, but even that didn't make a usable paste.  I ended up throwing the flour mixture out and making the paste w/2 TBSP butter and 2 TBSP flour, and it worked much better.  The soup itself if wonderful - perfectly spiced.

This soup is delicious but definitely a) add a couple more glasses of water b) cut the cayenne by at least half unless you can really handle spicy c) cut the flour and butter to about a quarter cup each.

This recipe is GREAT, buuuut after I altered it a bit to my taste. 
1st off I made this recipe last yr and the mistake at the very end ( the part with the butter and flour) is still wrong! I wish the author could edit it and fix it already. 
By yeah, I used 1/4 cup flour and about 4tbs of butter and that worked for me.

ALSO Instead of SERVING it with lemon wedged, I juice a whole lemon and slowly add that directly to the soup and keep tasting it until it is lemony enough for me. I usually put the whole lemon in and it is perfect.

And I also find a lot of the water to evaporate, turning the soup into a stew consistency. I had veggie broth on hand ( thank god) so I put about one cup in and it was perfect.

Also I cut down on the cayenne a tad not much tho.
Then I dollop a nice slab of sour cream on top and call it a day !

My husband and four boys love this meal!  We were just entering some vegetarian meals into our menu, after a few times making it the soup has become a huge hit in our home!  It is so healthy and so flavorful and so filling!  Exactly what all my growing boys need!

So, overall, this is delicious.  It's really hearty and rich and filling and also completely healthy.  I like some heat, so I added a little more cayenne than recommended and also a tablespoon or so of sambal olek (chili paste.)

However, posters saying that it's very thick (it's much more stewlike) and that the flour-to-butter measurement is off are correct.  Essentially you're making a roux to go into the soup, and with a roux you generally want a 1:1 flour-butter ratio.  I did about a half cup of butter and a half cup of flour and it worked out great, and came out a bit more soupy than the original recipe would have.

Very tasty.  I made the soup according to the recipe and enjoyed it.  The lentils tend to absorb liquids, so I did have to add water every now and then.

The soup is very healthy and filling. I guess the flavor wasn't as much to our liking as the Lentil Soup with Lemon by Jodi. That one is delish! This one is less expensive though and still okay. I guess after the other recipe, this one didn't quite hit it with the family.

This soup was bland (and I even added extra cumin) and I couldn't taste the lemon flavor at all. Also, there's very little color in this. Perhaps more carrots and an addition of spinach would add some color and make the soup more visually appealing. My very adventurous twin toddlers (who love foods of all kinds and flavors--chili, hummus, curries, other lentil soups, etc.) would barely touch this soup and said, "Yuck" when they looked at it (the first time they've ever said this). They instead chewed the lemon wedges. I was really hoping to love this recipe, but I will keep searching for a lebanese lentil soup we love.

Delicious! I especially like the cumin in this soup. I combined this with some leftover butternut squash soup, and it was amazing -- so you could very easily add squash to it for extra veggies.
