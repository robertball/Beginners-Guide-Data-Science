This is outstanding! This sweet sour sauce is very tangy and spicy. I'm making more as an appetizer for tomorrow's Bunco game.  Thanks for sharing.

I really enjoyed this recipe!  I love marinated vegetables but "tossed with Italian dressing" gets old!  The only variation that I made was to add a bit of red pepper (cayenne) for a bit of a bump.  Really, the taste is amazing and recipe is easy to make!

Tell Mom this was Delicious... I'm not much for sugar on vegetables.But this was GREAT. It's just a tad to sweet. Next time I will cut the sugar some and maybe add some green and black olives. Thank you very much. Tom

This recipe kicks!  I'm a snob about using canned soup but thought I'd try it.  I cut the sugar by half and added a good couple of squirts of Chinese rooster sauce.  Any combination of vegies will work.  Didn't have cucumber or green pepper but used more cauliflower, red and yellow peppers.  Son and nephew couldn't get enough... and they're NOT big vegetable eaters!  Will definitely make again... and again.

Super Easy and very good!  Reminds me of a French dressing, so if you don't like French dressing you probably won't care for this.  I do think it was a little too sweet for my liking, next time I'll cut the sugar in half (cut in by 1/4th this time).  If you don't have overnight to refrigerate, 4 hours will work.  I drained the marinade in the morning.

Made this for a family BBQ.  It was fine, but I wouldn't make it again.  People seemed to eat it, but I didn't get any compliments. I have to say that I didn't particularly like it.  Another salad on this site with a similar that that I prefer is: Spiral Pasta Salad.

Great recipe for a cookout, picnic, etc. I used a sweet onion and added a dash of cayenne to the marinade.

This same recipe has been in my family for at least 20 years,(in Australia) with slight variation in vegetables. The sweet/sour aspect is really nice, especially with a Barb-o-que's.

I made this for a large gathering and it was slowly eaten up. I following the recipe exactly except cutting the sugar in half.I thought it was still too sweet. I agree with one reviewer who said it tasted like a sweet French dressing.I donâ€™t think I will make it again.

These are awesome!  Can't believe how flavorful these were.  And perfect with mini Beef Wellington and stuffed mushroom caps!

A delicious way to add vegetables to a menu, especially in the summer.  I used a bag of mini carrots to save cutting and peeling time and it worked great.  Kept for several days in the fridge.

I followed the recipe as written and its  very good. The next time I make it I may not add the cucumber since it didn't retain its crispness.  I will be making this for Easter and I'm sure I will make it often especially in the upcoming summer months
