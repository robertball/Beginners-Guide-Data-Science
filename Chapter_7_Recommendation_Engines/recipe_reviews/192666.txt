This is really good! I am having a "chip and dip" bar at my wedding, and I wanted an onion dip that was fancier than what you usually see. This fit the bill perfectly! I made it to take to a wine party and it was well received! My friends were dipping EVERYTHING in this, including sausage!  I didn't have basil so I omitted it. I diced the onions because I figured people wouldn't want big pieces of onions when dipping and it was the perfect consistency. I tried the onions after caramelizing them, and they were fabulous! You could use just the onions to top steaks or veggies or whatever you wanted to put onions on/add onions to! The goat cheese gave a good, creamy consistency but since I will be making this for a lot of people, I think I am going to sub cream cheese for the goat cheese and use a mixer to briefly blend the sour cream and cream cheese.

this recipe was delicious and so easy to make!  instead of sour cream i used plain, nonfat greek yogart.  i did this behind my yogart-hating husbands back, b/c had he known, he'd never had eaten it!  but we ate it with some wheat crisps (trader joe's version of wheat thin) and it was lovely!

This was ok. I would recommend dicing the onions cause it was a little hard to eat with the long slices on onion. I felt like it was missing something though, needed a little more oomph.

DH LOOOOOVES caramelized onions so I had to try this. Soooo good! He doesn`t like basil so much so I left that out and it needed more than a pinch of brown sugar. I put in about a teaspoon. Very yummy with a veggie tray.

This dip was delicious- tangy, sweet, savory, and perfect for a party. I made a double batch, but did not use quite 5 cups of sour cream as the double batch called for- I only used about 4, since I felt that any more would have made it too bland.

It was a little bland so I added a little bit more of the spices but overall this is a great new dip. I love how it uses goat cheese, very different.

I made this for a group event. I diced the onions. Also added a little cumin for a smokey flavor in the back ground. Everyone loved it.

Really yummy! I left out the goat cheese, but wish I hadn't as it needed the salt. I subbed 1c of the sour cream with greek yogurt. Also, diced the onion instead of slicing and added cumin.  So much better than store bought or out of the packet!

Great change from the usual ranch dip.  Make sure your onion is really big, or this is too much oil.  I think I will use less oil next time as I ended up draining the oil and squeezing in paper towel to remove excess oil.  I did not think there was enough goat cheese flavor so I added more goat cheese.  But with the small changes I found this really good and a nice change.  Will definitely make again when I have a raw veggie tray.

This is the ultimate recipe for a low-sodium, rich, savory, tangy and slightly sweet onion dip.  This statement by Color Fell is quite accurate in my opinion.  I made no changes and I will make this again.  One reviewer mentioned cutting the onions into smaller pieces, however the onions break down while cooking with the other ingredients so they work ok as written.
Just sayn.

I've made this recipe in my own variation about 3 times and everybody loves it! it's so addicting and I can't even stop eating it. I'm actually going to make it this Thanksgiving for boyfriend's family to try too. I omit tarragon and goat cheese because ingredients weren't available but the taste is still absolutely extraordinary.

I reduced the sour cream to 1 cup and added 1/2 cup plain yogurt and then combined all ingredients in a food processor to get a smooth creamy, sweet, and savory bowl of goodness.

This is delicious!!! This recipe makes enough for a small crowd (guessing between 3 -3 1/2 cups) and is so much better than buying onion dip in the store. I did find I needed to add a bit more spices to mine because it seemed just a bit bland. I have added it to my recipe box and will definitely make again. I did cut back on the oil and used only 2 T olive oil which was plenty. Thank you for sharing your recipe.

This was OK.  wondering if I did something wrong.  Will try again, tho.
