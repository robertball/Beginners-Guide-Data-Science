I only gave it three stars because the cooking directions are so off, but when I managed to fix the issue it tasted wonderful!

I used the same ingredients/portions...with the exception of adding one small chopped zucchini and only used 2/3 of a large onion.  I used vegetable broth (not chicken).  I cooked as directed - sauteeing the veggies for about 10 minutes then putting all ingredients in a casserole dish, covered it with foil, cooked at 350 for 30 minutes.  When I checked it the grains after 30 minutes they had not even cooked yet - it looked like soup!  So I upped the temp to 400 degrees (and also cooked a piece of salmon separately to make a full meal) and left in the oven 20 more minutes.  I also put the casserole lid on top of the foil to seal it better.  After the 20 minutes it was done and delicious!  I thought it may need more spices but it tasted very flavorful (the veggie broth added a nice flavor).  I think the veggies may have come out a bit over cooked after cooking for almost in an hour in the oven...it may not be a bad idea to simply sautee the veggies and cook the millet/quinoa on the stove...then simply stir together everything - rather than using the oven at all.

I ended up adding a whole red and yellow bell pepper, a cup of corn, and 7 stalks of celery. I wanted it to have more vegetables. I topped it with some salsa and it was super good!

The cooking instructions were perfect! It turned out great in my dutch oven. After 30 minutes of baking, I added some ginger juice and Bragg's Liquid Aminos (organic low sodium soy sauce) to spice it up. Yummm! This recipe is a keeper!

Wonderful taste! I skipped the celery and added cut squash and peas. I had to cook it about 20 min. extra for liquid to be used up.

De-lishous!  This will be a staple side dish in my house, or main dish with the addition of beans or nuts.  I followed Sparksy's cooking method and it turned out perfectly.

This was really great. After reading through some previous comments, I was worried about the cooking time, since I had my main dish cooking already thinking it would take longer. But then, I had the idea to make one small change. I have another pilaf- a lentil rice pilaf I make often that has the same basic method- except that in that recipe you sauté the ingredients in an oven safe  pan, I use an all metal Dutch oven, then you add the liquid directly to the pan, bring it to a boil, then cover the pan and put it in the preheated oven. This recipe instructs you to sauté the vegetables, then remove them from the warm pan, into a casserole pan, add broth from the pantry or fridge, before putting the room temperature dish in the oven. I think that extra time people are talking about are the time it would take for that broth to get hot enough to begin to cook the quinoa and millet. So, I borrowed a bit from my other pilaf recipe, used my Dutch oven, added the broth directly to the warm vegetables and pan, and brought the broth to a slight boil. It did not need a rolling boil, just some bubbles coming up showing me it had come to a good temperature, then I covered the pan with foil and put it in the preheated oven. 30 minutes I checked it, and it was perfect. The millet and quinoa was cooked, and all water was absorbed, but it was not dried out, or burned or anything. 
My husband loved this dish. I am not usually a quinoa fan, but keep it on hand for the health value.

This is delicious!  However, in order to get all the liquid absorbed, I had to raise the temperature to 400 and bake it for 20 minutes longer.  Our patience was rewarded!

Great recipe, thanks! I added carrots and skipped the bell peppers and corn. I also cooked in my dutch oven, stirring after 30 minutes. Then cooked it another 15 minutes.
