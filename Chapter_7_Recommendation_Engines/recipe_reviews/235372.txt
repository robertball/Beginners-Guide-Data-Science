Great way to use up left-over pulled pork! We made the recipe as written, served it with a side of scrambled eggs, and topped it with a bit of hot sauce or ketchup. The whole family enjoyed it.

I love hashes of all varieties and this is a really good idea!  I found it very appealing to my hash love and a good way to change up pulled pork leftovers.  My pulled pork was from a picnic roast that I had used to make some posole.  I was relieved to find something besides BBQ to use up the meat I had left.  I like spicy foods, so I did add a little more cayenne.  Serving this with a nice over-easy or soft poached egg is just perfect.  I will make this again.

I didn't have red onions so I used a yellow onion I cooked it in half the amount of butter.  I also  used garlic salt and a pinch of Italian seasoning, I cut a big russet  potato into small cubes  added a small amount of olive oil just enough to coat potatoes, sprinkle a little garlic salt and microwave for 3 min.  I added the potatoes to the onions then added the shredded pork  added more garlic salt and the Italian seasoning and pepper

Just made this! Used leftover slow cooker baby back ribs recipe  from this site  except mine were boneless...so  instead of puuled it was sliced. The potatoes were leftover roasted red potatoes also from this site, cut up in chunks. I kept mine separate for kid's taste, but yummy mixed together too.

I was raised one of 6  children so Mom never wasted any leftovers. We loved when she made hash with leftover Sunday roast.  I had leftover pulled pork so wanted to try this.  The only thing I changed was I used sweet potato since that was what I had.  My grandchildren had never had hash and they loved it.

Used leftover pork from Carnitas - Pressure Cooker. Added some hot sauce.  Good for breakfast. Served mine with scrambled egg on the side while the hubby had a fried egg on top of his.

I made it just as printed.  It is a good way to use left over pulled pork and my husband liked it, but we were not over-whelmed by the flavors. It was a little bland, and  definitely needed the Cayenne pepper.
