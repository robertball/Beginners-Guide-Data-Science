Very refreshing and the flavors just scream summer! I made this with about half the sugar and that was plenty sweet for me.  If you're using a really ripe honeydew, you may not want to use the full amount of sugar. This makes a lot of dressing and you could probably get away with using half. Next time I might even leave the peel on the cucumber, or peel it in strips, just to add some color contrast to the salad. This salad would be great with some minced fresh mint added.

Was way too sweet, I don't think the dressing was the right combo.

I had never tried mixing honeydew melons and cucumber ... This was so refreshing from our normal way of eating them.
