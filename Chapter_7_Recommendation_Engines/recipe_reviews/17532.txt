These were fantastic.  Didn't make any changes from the original recipe, and they turned out great.  Just spicy enough, with a great flavor.

As with all recipes, the seasonings make all the difference.  I used a very spicy blackening seasoning and these turned out great!!  Serve on an English Muffin.

I made these for my Memorial Day barbeque and got rave reviews.  We liked the spicy cajun barbeque sauce a lot.  I bet these would be great with bacon.  I would consider using less egg and bread crumbs next time, because the combination of the two usually make the burger tough, but the bread crumbs add really good flavor (used Italian seasoned).  If you want the burger spicier I would suggest some extra Cayenne pepper.  Definitely keeping this recipe for my next bbq!

I added a bit of fresh ground chili paste (in a jar in Asian food section) to spice it up more. I did not add green onions to the meat, instead I grilled red onions and put them on top of the cooked burger with the cheese. Next time I will add lettuce and tomato and maybe make some cajun mayo instead of using the BBQ sauce, even though I like the BBQ sauce too.

Wow, talk about juicy burgers.  These are great.  I used Emeril's Essence so they were lot all that spicey.  I will make again because they have a lot of flavor.

These were ok, not bad though, a change from the ordinary.  I did like the BBQ sauce and will use that again on a regular burger .  I did leave out the green onions as I didn't want any "crunch" factor.

great! I forgot to add the onion, so I sprinkled the burgers with onion powder. Worked just fine. This is a real winner.

These burgers were pretty good. I mixed cheddar right into the burgers. It just didn't wow me but they were by no means bad. Nice idea.

These burgers are the only ones my husband and I make now!  They are delicious.  We use Tony's for the Cajun seasoning of course, and they are really tasty.  Good job Gail!

My husband and I tried these and weren't impressed.  We love Cajun but didn't like the flavor of these with or without the BBQ sauce.  I don't think we'll make these again.

Flavorful, but not spicy hot.  Overall moist and good texture.  I used Emeril's Essance as my cajun seasoning and it was very good in the burger AND in the BBQ sauce.  Nice sharp cheddar cheese is a must.  I did these a few minutes on each side on high heat in a cast-iron skillet and then baked them through in a 425 oven for 15 minutes or so, instead of using the grill.  Worked great.

Good burger, even with the egg.  I will say that I'm not much of a fan of "egg burgers" but this went well all around.  My daughter is non-onion tolerant (meaning she's too picky to eat them) but she is coming around when it comes to green onions, so these went over well.  Next time I'll spice mine up a little more, maybe it was my cajun seasoning, but it didn't have the kick that I expected.  Topped with a slice of monterey pepperjack cheese....mmmmm.  Thanks Gail!!

These were spicy and had a lot of flavor. I ended up cooking them on the stovetop. The sauce was really good with them and I think Cajun-Mayo would work well at cooling the heat a little. I used a homemade AR cajun seasoning recipe and Sweet Baby Ray's sauce. I thought these had the texture of meatloaf though and I think next time I will leave out the bread crumbs and the eggs as we don't need the filler to stretch these. It made 4 hearty burgers. I could only finish half of mine they were filling. Thanks Molson7 for the great burger.

The burgers were tasty, but I thought they tasted more like a meatloaf patty than a burger.  The only substitution I made was use regular onions instead of green onions.  I thought the BBQ sauce with the cajun seasoning was excellent and will spice up my BBQ sauce all the time now.

While these burgers were juicy, my hubby and I didn't think they were all that tasty.  The burgers didn't taste bad, we were just expecting more.  The burgers totally fell apart and we weren't able to eat them as burgers.  The sauce was really nice and we enjoyed that.  Thanks for the recipe Gail but I don't think I will make the burgers again.

Yum! My mom and brother ( who eats alot of burgers) both claimed these to be the best they every had. The sauce adds alot the burger. I gave it a four mostly because some fell apart when flipping on the grill.(saved some by useing two flippers and sandwiching the burgers when flipping)

these were great and a wonderful change to the ordinary burger.  i did find that they were a little salty.  does not bother me much but may be something to note is watching sodium intake.

I like the idea of this recipe.  The cajun seasoning spice I bought was way too salty and made the burgers almost uneatable.  I will try another seasoning.

There isn't much to critique about this recipe, other than that the flavor was just so so. I love bbq burgers, so it was a bit disappointing.

Great burgers!  I doubled the recipe using 1 lb ground beef and 1lb ground pork.  Omitted the egg and added 2 Tbsp Worcestershire sauce.  I topped the burgers with the seasoned BBQ, red onions, cheddar cheese and bacon.  Bacon is a must! Better than any restaurant burger I've had in a while!

Very good. Maybe a tad bit spicy for my taste. Used 96% ground beef & left out the green onions. Served on Orroweat whole wheat sandwich thins with Cajun sweet potato fries. Thanks!

I thought these burgers were FABULOUS!  Really, really loved them!  Only change was I used ground turkey.  I did not like the BBQ sauce with the cajun seasoning though.  I only had hickory BBQ so that may have been why.  I will try once more with another BBQ sauce, but did not even use the BBQ sauce on the burger.  Tasted after it was made and wanted to spit it out.  :)  Thanks so much for sharing - will use this burger recipe again and again.

I love this recipe. I tried it the posted way and fell in love with how much taste it had.  Second go around, i left out the bread crumbs and instead of chedder, i used pepper jack. I highly suggest both ways.

The burgers were moist, and juicy and flavourful without overpowering the beef.  Sometimes my burgers fall apart - these held together like a dream.

I think this recipe is great.  For those people who like ordinary burgers I wouldn't recommend, however for those with a sense and taste for adventure it is wonderful.  I would also suggest using seasoning that say "Cajun" versus Creole because the later seams to be saltier. I like to use either Louisiana Style Cajun Seasoning by Spice Islands or Emeril's Essence.  The barbecue sauce is excellent and couldn't be easier to put together.

These were OK.  Nothing spectactular.  The burgers were a bit salty (don't know why...).  The burgers also fell apart easily.  I am not a grill pro, so maybe I did something wrong to cause them to crumble (?).  They had a nice flavor (except for the saltiness), but I don't think I'll make them again.  I'll try something different the next time I have a taste for burgers.  My bf didn't comment (he usually lets me know if he REALLY likes something that I make).  Thanks anyways.

My husband and I did not care for these burgers that much.  Instead of the ingredients enhancing the flavor of the meat it hid the beef taste and they were a bit salty.  We didn't use the barbecue sauce but I doubt we'd feel differently about the burgers if we had.  I won't be making these again.  The "Biggest Bestest Burgers" on this site is a winner.

A great recipe!  I would add the cajun spices to the barbeque sauce to taste, though, instead of automatically adding the amount listed.  The sauce was a little on the spicy side for us.  Yummy!

These were very good! We only tweaked the recipe slightly, we didn't have onions on hand, so we used some onion powder. I found the sauce to be tasty, but lacked a sweetness to balance it out. I added some Ketchup to the burger and it was perfect! I will definitely be making this again!!

I'm giving this 4 stars. These were yummy hamburgers,mmm. I omitted the green onions and added carmelized onions which were perfect to balance out the spiciness. I also formed the patties a few hours before grilling to marinate.

I thought it was ok.  It was a little heavy on the cajun seasoning so I could taste nothing else.  But I think if I  put a little less in the sauce, it might even out just right.

My husband thought these burgers were great!  I halved the recipe (though still used an entire egg), left out the green onions and sprinkled the burgers with onion powder instead.  I also mixed a few tablespoons of shredded cheddar into the meat mixture.  We topped the burgers with the sauce and some sauted mushrooms.  I'll definitely make these again!

This did so well for me and my husband I just had to sign up so I could leave a review!
We didn't include the green onions, my husband hates any kind of vegetable.  We also didn't use the BBQ sauce(simply wasn't in the mood for BBQ that night.)  But it still came out well and very tasty.  I had no problem with it crumbling as I've seen in some reviews.  I used a George Foreman grill, maybe that made the difference.  
I'm going to try this recipe again tonight, but I'm adding some bacon.

There are better burger recipes out there, but there are also many more that are worse.  This was good, but I don't think I'll make again.  These just didn't hit 5 stars but these burgers were above average.

These were good.  I skipped the green onions.  I forgot to add the Cajun seasoning to the barbecue sauce at the end, but they were still good.  A nice basic burger with enough zip to make them quite tasty.  I would make these again.

You'll probably like this recipe if you're used to eating bland, unseasoned burgers.  However, if you regularly spice up your own, this particular recipe is nothing to rave about.

I enjoyed the flavor of this burger. It had just a little heat but not too much.
