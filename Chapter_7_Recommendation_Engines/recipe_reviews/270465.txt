Turned out good. Hubby and I enjoyed it. Added bell peppers and onions as suggested, and used ground turkey and a 15 oz. can of sloppy joe mix in place of the packet if mix and tomato sauce. Wasn't sure about the cottage cheese but I remembered my mom used cottage cheese in her spaghetti casserole, so I gave it a whirl. I actually couldn't taste it much, but I think it made the dish a bit soupy. I recalled later that my mom used to strain the cottage cheese, so I will have to do that next time. Thank you for the great recipe!

Cheated and used canned Sloppy Joe sauce with extra onion and bell pepper added. Came out pretty good, except next time I'll use 1.5 pounds of meat. I used a 9X9 square baking dish and there wasn't enough meat to cover edge to edge. As far as cottage cheese goes, that is verboten in ANYTHING! Nasty stuff. Used shredded colby-jack for the whole thing. Try to make enough so that you'll have leftovers for lunch the next day.

My husband and I really liked this. I forgot to add the water to the sauce and it turned out great. I can see how if you add all that water, it would turn out watery. Next time I'm going to try using ricotta cheese, otherwise it was delicious!

I made a Sloppy Joe Casserole and it was Awesome!  However, I used the canned Sloppy Joe mix instead of the packet.  I didn't use the can of tomato sauce and turned out perfect!  Considering my boys are forced to be at home, and always looking for something to eat, this casserole hit the spot.  God Bless!!!!!

Very easy to make. Very tasty. I didn't give 5 stars because it didn't have ENOUGH of a Sloppy Joe flavor. (Could be the store brand seasoning I used.) I would make it again.

I changed out the sloppy Joe mix for taco mix and replaced the tomato sauce with enchilada sauce. Was yummy

Easier using the canned Sloppy Joe with a little water to rinse out the can.  This is a nice blank palette, going to amp it up a bit next time.

This was a very easy dish to make and very yummy! My husband especially loved it and took all the leftovers for lunch the next day. I think next time I will add 2 ounces more pasta as I felt it could have used a bit more but then perhaps not as it was really good as printed. I think kids - both large and small - will really eat this one up.

It's like a combination of sloppy joes and baked mostaccioli . I prefer this to a sloppy joe on a bun, love the cottage cheese! Simple, delicious and a great comfort food!

Marathon Runner Hubby & kids approved! I doubled the recipe, added 1/2 an onion, a bit of chopped garlic, & seasonings. Instead of tomato sauce, I used a can of mannwich sloppy joe sauce (my Hubs fav)! But, I wish I had more cottage cheese. It was still tasty! My kids have learned how to brown the meat & cook the pasta ahead of time, for a future Scouting campout meal!

This did not go over well. It was pretty bland. maybe if you mixed everything instead of layering it. Also turns out we are not fans of sloppy Joe seasoning packets.

This was actually really good. I made the recipe exactly as described. It wasn't watery for me at all. My fiance only asked that I add more cheddar cheese next time.

Quick meal about an hour.  Kids loved it.  After reading other review and having made it. I agree with straining the cottage cheese.  It was simple to make and yummy.  Nice meal for colder spring day.

Nice twist on Sloppy Joes! I omitted the cottage cheese because we don't like it. You can use any kind of pasta you have on hand! Will make again.

Added green pepper, shallot chopped fresh mushrooms to the ground sirloin I had. Followed the recipe from there, used elbow mac. Drained the cottage cheese as suggested by another review.  It needed a little more, but my boys like zippy and I seem to have caught it as well.  I'll certainly make it again due to ease, and add Italian or Mexican spices.  My sloppy joe mix was generic.

Very good! I suggest using Fire Roasted canned tomatoes. Gives it a much better flavor.

This was just ok for us --  needed more seasoning.  I did add onion, garlic, salt, & some red pepper, but it still needed something more, though I'm not sure what.  We'll finish what's left over, but probably won't make this again.
