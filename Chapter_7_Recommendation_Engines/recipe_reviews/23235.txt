My husband and I really enjoyed this recipe - we added a bit of salt and pepper and we didn't strain it for more of a 'chunky' dip.

This is far from being a "waste of good olive oil", however I felt it need a couple minor tweaks. First off, what a GREAT way to use up leftover roasted red peppers! I always find that when I buy a jar for a recipe, I only end up using about half and end up tossing the rest because it just sits in my fridge. Not anymore! This recipe couldn't be easier! I tried using a double layer of cheesecloth and realized it wasn't straining well, so I removed the cheesecloth and just used my fine mesh strainer. I was able to push the oil mixture through with the back of a spoon to get it all strained.  I seasoned this with some cracked black pepper and a sprinkle of salt. The salt is necessary in my opinion, and takes the oil from just "good" to "amazing"!

I didnt try this recipe exactly as stated but i can improve it based off experience as a professional cook.  Instead of buying expensive roasted peppers in a jar make your own.  Just use the oil from the recipe and cover fresh bell peppers with seeds removed and roughly torn.  Cook in oven at 300 for 1 to 2 hours until very soft.  Then pass through a fine strainer aka shin chinois.  You could also add peeled garlic cloves
