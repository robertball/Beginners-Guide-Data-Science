The cupcakes look wonderful and taste good.  I would make my own frosting next time.  That is the only part I would change.

This recipe was a huge hit with my daughter's class.  The cupcakes were delicious.  I must confess though, by the time we were done making them, I nearly went into sugar shock just from the smell of all those sugary delectables,  whew!!  alot of fun to make.

These cupcakes are cute, and fun to make.  I made 
10 dozen for a church bake sale, had them all ready to go, woke up in the morning and nearly ALL of my cute little basket handles had broken in the middle.  My advice is to use this recipe when they can be enjoyed immediately!

Both kids and adults loved these little cuties at our Easter gathering. I cheated and used a box mix because the fun part is in the decorating!

This is a good recipe but why not just use cake mix and icing and then have all your candy trimmings.  It is much easier and the kids still enjoy decorating the cupcakes.
