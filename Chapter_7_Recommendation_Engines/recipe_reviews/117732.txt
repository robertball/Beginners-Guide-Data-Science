I love this tuna salad! I made a few changes to suit my tastes (and what I had on hand) and to zip it up a tad. I substituted dried cranberries for dates (not a big fan of dates!) and almonds in place of walnuts. Didn't have any plain yogurt so I used non-fat vanilla and it worked out great. I also added green grapes, red bell pepper, red onion, sweet dill relish, dijon mustard, curry powder, salt, and pepper (all in small amounts just to enhance the flavor). Served on lettuce and it was delish!

I make this on Sunday and it is lunch for four days.  I don't use the bread or cheese.  Just put on top of salad greens.  I don't like yogurt so I used cottage cheese instead which works better than you would think.  I'm a bit generous with the celery also. Great healthy lunch.

I made this today for lunch. I didn't have the dates, so I used dried cranberries instead which was good. Also, I used pecans instead of walnuts. The results were very good and made a yummy meal served on greens...but I decided I wanted to jazz it up a little to really suit my taste. I added a little low fat sour cream, 2 tbs. dijon mustard, two baby gherkin pickles diced (sweet relish would suffice), and 1 tsp. garlic salt. Jackpot! Can't wait for my hubby to try it:) Update: My husband raved, so it's a keeper!

I thought this was delicious, and so did my boyfriend (who didn't believe me when I said people put apple in tuna). I didn't have plain yogurt so thought I would chance it with 2/3 vanilla yogurt. Surprisingly didn't clash

Great recipe. I wouldn't subtract anything from the recipe except for maybe less yogurt and mayo (too watery). I dont use on lettuce as I make sandwiches!

WOW!  This is one of the best kept secrets on this site and gives a whole new meaning to the word tuna salad.  I made a few changes, but nothing that would have a major impact on the outcome.  I was out of walnuts and had to use pecans.  I don't care for raisins, so I left those out.  Finally, I omitted the cheese because I was afraid it would overpower the sweet, delicate flavor of the salad.

This was a very good tuna salad!  I did not have any rasins so I substituted dried cranberries and it was delicious!  I also subbed light sour cream for the yogurt and it was a hit!

Excellent recipe. I took this to a pot luck at work and several thought it had chicken (which would be excellent also). Don't be scared by the ingredients - very delicious. I used pecans instead of walnuts.

Just made this for Lent and it is great! I have never had a salad like this with tuna, only chicken, but it is still delicious! I made my own changes partly because it was what I had on hand. I didn't use raisins or dates but instead added fresh grapes and it was still good!

Excellent recipe!  This salad had great flavor and texture!  My husband loved it too!  I bumped up the amount of raisins and used golden instead of regular.  I also added calamata olives.  Great recipe!

For my family, this was good but not great.   I think I will try a few suggestions from other reviewers here or maybe even try it with chicken.  The base flavor is good but, for us, it needs tweaking a bit to be great.

I dunno if it was the texture of the tuna but this wasn't my favorite. The taste was ok but it really was the texture that got me.

Very very good. I omitted the dates (didn't have any and have never tried them before) and lettuce. Instead of lettuce I used a high-fiber wheat tortilla and made it into a wrap. It was very good in the wrap, but you have to be careful since wheat can be an overpowering flavor. I don't like celery or walnuts, but they enhanced the flavors of the dish and add a nice crunch and pop of flavor.  Next time I will use less celery or chop it up smaller so I don't get as much flavor pop. Very good salad/wrap. Tomorrow I'm going to put the leftovers on wheat ritz crackers. :)

So good!  I used half of a yellow apple, almonds, sour cream (just a TB) and cranberries.  Served with lettuce on a whole grain tortilla, it was great!  Definitely a keeper because I'll use whatever I have on hand and play with the recipe.

Short on pantry items, I ended up having to swap walnuts for pecans and tuna for pink salmon, but this turned out fantastic!
