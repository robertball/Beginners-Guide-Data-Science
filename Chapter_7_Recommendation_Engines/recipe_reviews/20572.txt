I didn't have all of the ingredients on hand, so I had to improvise a bit, but I *loved* this dip!  It's the best homemade dip I've had in a long time -- and I constantly have a container of it in the fridge.

I skipped the MSG.  This dip goes great with vegetables.

This recipe is way too salty, and I am a heavy salt user.  I made it according to the servings of 16. The taste of dill was faint. When I make this again, I will use 2 teaspoons of dill, onion and garlic powder, and skip the parsely. I will then salt to taste after it is mixed.

This recipe is WONDERFUL! I get rave reviews every time I take it to an event. Make sure you double the dill. You'll get a nice dill flavor. Leave out the MSG. Chill it well before serving.

I thought this dip was good, but the dried minced onion is overpowering. I was expecting more of a dill flavor. Next time, I am going to omit the onion flakes altogether.

I use this dill dip recipe every time I have a gathering.  It's awesome!  If you don't have any MSG, use 1/4 tsp salt.

Sorry, but I really didn't like this dip very well.  It didn't have much dill flavor, and it also had too much of something else.  I thought perhaps it was the onion flakes and since another reviewer has mentioned this, that's probably it.  I didn't think it very good with veggies and I used it up with some chips.

This is one of my favorites for parties.  So easy and delicious.  I use garlic powder instead of garlic salt because it is already a salty dip.

Fabulous and simple recipe.  I served this at a party I hosted and everyone loved it.  One guest came in asking for the dip that everyone was raving about.  This is for sure a keeper!

I read the reviews first and cut back on the mayo. I do not buy MSG so I skipped that and just added more dill. I agree with others that it was a tad too salty so next time I would cut back on the garlic and celery salt. All in all I cannot complain though except for the MSG.

I wasn't crazy about the amount of mayo in this dip.  I might make it again but 1/2 the mayo.

I used light "real mayo" and no msg. It is salty so next time I'll use garlic powder.  Let it sit in the fridge for 2 hrs so the dried onions weren't still crunchy.
