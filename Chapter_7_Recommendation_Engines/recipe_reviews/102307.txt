Another awesome meal!  There were only three adults at dinner and one child that night and the serving for eight was finished off.  Have tried brown sugar recipe before and was too sweet this is perfect

I've been making a meatloaf similar to this one for 15+yrs; but done in the microwave.  No ginger; instead a dash of A1 Steak Sauce.  I use 6 slices bread torn into pieces.  I cook the loaf ingredients on high for 20 minutes; then combine the brown sugar/ketchup glaze & spread on top the last 5min.    My stepson is a very picky eater -- but loves this recipe!  It's the one that won me over into his heart...

My husband liked the recipe but thought the sugar/ketchup sauce on the bottom was too sweet. I loved that sweet kick! We will make this again. Very good.

"Excellent" was the comment my hubby made on this one. I don't prefer meatloaf but he really likes it. So I decided to try this recipe and I am so glad I did! 
The only thing I changed was that I used BBQ sauce instead of ketchup.

This tasted great, and was so easy (the hardest part was cutting up the onion).  I usually make the Bacon Mushroom Swiss Meatloaf (also on this site), but decided to try this because of all the good reviews.  I followed the recipe exactly, and did not think it was too sweet or bland like other reviewers. My husband doesn't like sweets and he even loved it.

A very sweet meatloaf that was almost too moist.  I usually use meatloaf pan that catches drippings.  Since this recipe calls for the sugar and ketchup on the bottom, I couldn't use the catch.  Looked like grease soup when it came out, but when I sliced it and put it on a plate, it was much more appealing and tasted quite good.

It was a little tiny bit too sweet for my taste, but that can be easily fixed. My husband liked it but didn't rave about it.

This is definitely a winner with the kids. My 11 yr old daughter had a friend over who said, "I usually hate meatloaf but this is GOOD!"  I was hesitant at first to make it.  I thought all the fat would drip into the sauce on the bottom and you would be forced to eat it.  But no:  The fat came up around the sides and I was able to drain most of it off without losing the good sweet sauce on the bottom. I baked it at 375 for exactly an hour.  It was perfect. I added a couple of cloves of finely grated garlic. The ginger is a very nice touch.  Don't leave it out!  I also substituted "Silk" for the milk.  Thank you, Pam. This IS a great recipe.

This must be the same recipe as Starbuck's.  It is an excellent recipe.  The only difference I made was I changed the 1/2 cup of brown sugar to a 1/4 cup of brown sugar.  I found it a bit too sweet with 1/2 cup.

Did not enjoy.  We will be keeping with our regular meatloaf recipe (Mini Meatloaves from this site).
Thanks anyway.

This is one of our favorites!  Before this recipe, my kids turned their noses up at the mention of "meatloaf."  Now, they actually ask me for it!  It is sweet, but I just can't get enough of this dish!  The ultimate in comfort food.

Good stuff...I do agree that it was really moist.  I used Ritz crackers instead (didn't have any Saltines).  Did have a ton of grease that scared me a bit....but liked the end result.  Thanks for the post.

This was very easy to make and tasted great; not too sweet at all. My sons loved it.
