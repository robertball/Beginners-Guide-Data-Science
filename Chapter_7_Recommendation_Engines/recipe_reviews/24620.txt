This is a very good recipie. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was b/c the mayo recommended was way too much even if you cut it in half. Next time I will put in 1/4 the recommended amount.

Only change I made was that I added a full pound of imitation crab since there was sooo much of the dressing.  Excellent recipe and tastes great! The whole family is impressed!

This was great.  I did double the crab meat and cut the dressing in half and it was just as we like it.  I also added some finely chopped onion.  I liked it better than what we get in the deli at the store.

First of all: not enough mayonnaise. Not even close. Seafood salad, like all food, can only be improved upon by adding more mayonnaise. I recommend this recipe with an additional 6 cups of light mayonnaise. For mayonnaise enthusiasts like me, I recommend 12 cups of full strength Hellman's. Also, remove the salt, vinegar, milk, crabmeat, celery, and bell pepper. It's not really necessary, and only hinders the flavor of the mayonnaise.

I love this recipe!  I did use about 1/3 less dressing along with a little more crab meat, but kept everything else the same.  I serve it in a pita pocket with shredded lettuce and my husband and I devour it!

It's a really good recipe, but it needs some tweaking.  I think whoever entered it may have made a mistake.  1 cup of mayo to 1 cup of crabmeat is insane.  It ends up all mayo.  I made it 16 oz of crab and 16 oz of salad shrimp and it tastes great!  I love it on buttercrisp crackers!

I was looking for a quick recipe to use with some imitation crab meat and this was perfect. I followed the recipe and added a little black pepper and a tbsp of chopped green onions. We ate it on bread and with crackers. Great Recipe. I am keeping this one!

Made this recipe as stated.  It turns out that it calls for way to much mayo, so I made pasta and added it to the dish.  The pasta soaked up the rest of the mayo and made the dish even better.

Too much mayonnaise, but otherwise pretty good.  I added some black and white ground pepper, as well as a little cayenne.  It spiced it up a little.  But you definitely need to decrease the mayo!

Very tasty! I added 1 cup of thawed 60/70 size shrimp, cut in half to balance out the amount of dressing. Otherwise, I made the recipe exactly as described. I bought the seafood on sale (2 for 1) and this ended up being far less expensive than what I would have bought at the deli counter.

This is great! I used abot 1 1/2 c. crabmeat imitation and used less mayo. I added sweet corn instead of the celery and the bell pepper... sooo good.

I agree that the dressing is too much for just a cup of imitation crab meat, so I also used more. And because I worried about it being too sweet (after reading a previous review), I used a packet of Splenda instead of a tablespoon of sugar. It was still perhaps just a tad too sweet (I'll use less than a whole 2-tsp packet next time), but very enjoyable. A good basic recipe to work from for seafood salad dressing, which is what I was looking for. (I subtituted fresh diced onion for the green pepper.)

I didn't like this at all. To me, the whole thing tasted like sweetened mayonnaise and green peppers. I tried adding more vinegar, but it didn't improve the taste. I am looking for a recipe like the seafood salads you get in restaurants, but this is not it.

yummy.  I took the advise of others and cut the mayo way down. Also added onions for crunch as I don't like celery.  This is a keeper, it is as good (if not better since I can customize) as the stuff you buy in the deli.

Close to deli made - a little too sweet and too much mayo - use 2 cups crabmeat (one package of sealegs) and 2/3 c mayo and 2 tsp sugar. I added some dill and pepper to taste. Very good!

The salad was as good or better than Deli salads. In Place of the skim milk I used sour cream.  For crunch I added sliced water chesnuts and chopped onion.

Wow!  This is wonderful.  I did make a few changes per other reviews.  First of all, I used 1 lb. of imitation crab meat.  It was the perfect amount of dressing for that amount of meat.  I wonder if it is a typo in the recipe?  I also added about 1/8 tsp. of Old Bay, and added about 1/2 c. of finely shredded sharp Cheddar cheese, since our grocery store deli salad has cheese in it.  Finally, since I wasn't going for healthy with this, I used regular mayo and whole milk.  :)  Way better than our grocery store's deli salad!

Made for Thanksgiving, and it was really popular. 

Made a couple of changes as usual... only used mayo, imitation crab (surimi), celery, green onion, a little salt and a dash of old bay. 

It was fabulous, and everyone who tried it liked it. I've tried to make this before because I like the Subway seafood salad sandwich, and I think this was way better. The surimi was really sweet and delicious (not crab exactly, but it has its own flavor that I really like). I will definitely make this again as it's great, easy to make, and inexpensive.

ALWAYS, ALWAYS, ALWAYS read the reviews. I make a habit of reading the comments before making any recipe. That said, I was in a hurry and the recipe sounded great. I did NOT read the reviews. It was way too much mayo, but it did taste good and I will keep in my recipe box with the above comment.

As there is way too much liquid for the amount of crabmeat, I halved the mayo mixture and doubled the amount of imitation crab...so good! We also left out the green pepper because I have a bell pepper allergy, and substituted some onion for that, just like we do when making salmon spread...this one's definitely a keeper.

I too only used a quarter of the mayonnaise, added a little more celery and red bell pepper. Next time I will use a little less sugar too. Wish I would've had a little bit of onion as I think that would've been a good add to it ingredient. Thanks!!

Great recipe!!! Made a few changes added chopped onions and peas instead of the celery and pepper. Also added cubed mozzarella and a 1 lb of salad shrimp.

Used 8oz of crab meat and there was way to much sauce for the crab meat. Mixed it with avocados and dropped that on some greens and that was quite good. Will do it again.

I'm glad I read another review before I made this that said there was way too much mayo. I used my whole 1lb package of Krab meat, and I only did a half cup of mayonnaise and kept the rest of the ingredients the same amounts. Tasty, but still a little strong mayo taste. Maybe more vinegar or something next time.

If made as the recipe states it is WAY too mayonnaisey!    I should have read all of the reviews before making this.  Next time I will use 1/2 cup of mayo instead.

Thanks for the recipe! I cut the mayo as well - I used 1/3 cup and added just under a pound of crabmeat. It was delicious!

I buy the imitation crab meat at Sam's Club and then just triple the recipe.  It is very good and easy to make.  I don't add the green pepper, but that is just my preference.  You'll love this!!!

I only used about 1/3 to 1/2 of the mayonnaise (as others suggested) and it was still way too much!  After all that, the seafood salad tasted WAY too sweet.  I personally do not like super-sweet seafood salad.  I tried fixing it my adding a little mustard, salt (anything to compensate for the sweetness).  Nothing worked.  No one in the family liked it, not even the kids.  I would highly suggest mixing everything but the crab, and tasting the dressing mix to see if you like it.

This recipe is Very good! Even my 10 yr old son will woof it down and he doesnt care for seafood prepared like this. The only thing that I do differently is not to add the peppers and I only add about half of the mayo and an extra tsp of milk, a dash of dried parsley, garlic powder and some pepper. This dip tastes great on ritz crackers and even cornbread crackers! YUMMY!

MMM. This is the best. It reminded me of a seafood and crab sub I used to get at subway. I ate 2 sandwhiches in 2 days. I left out the celery and peppers becuase I don't like crunch in my salads. Thanks for posting.

This was a great recipe.  Like most others, I felt that there was WAY too much mayo in this.  I will make this again and half the mayo.  I added green onions and used frest crabmeat.  The taste was great.

I agree with others that the mayo amt is way out of whack.  I used only 1/4 of the amount and it was plenty.  I made this salad with half shrimp and half imitation crab and I used lemon juice rather than vinegar.  I was going to omit the sugar but decided to include it and am glad I did.  Thank you to the recipe poster. I'll be making it again soon as a salad, in a bun or a grilled sandwich - though I might increase the cheese substantially in that case.

Skip the green peppers and sub lemon juice for milk after doubling the meat. Let sit overnight and we can’t get enough of this!

The mayo and liquids are way too much for only one cup of imitation crab.  If you are going to use all of the measurements stated, you must use 16 ounces (two 8 ounce packages) of imitation crab.  I use less sugar because we don't like our salad sweet.  Very good when I use 16 ounces of imitation crab.   Yum!

This recipe calls for so much mayonnaise that this was inedible. Basically a bowl of mayo with some crab thrown in. I had to go back out and get more crab to put in. Halve the mayo unless you want to just eat mayo with a spoon.

Try adding sour cream instead of the skim and much less mayo. This will make the sauce thicker and even adds to the flavor. I also added a small amount of finely chopped onion.

I made this recipe w/ a 12 oz package of imitation lobster meat and it had way too much dressing.  It would probably be enough for 2 packages of meat.  The taste was great, though!

This was a wonderful "basic" recipe for seafood salad. I do agree with other reviews that there was a lot of dressing - I used about a one pound package of imitation crab meat, and the dressing was about perfect for that amount!

This is really tasty. I made it with Splenda to lower the carbs even more, and I also used Lactade for the milk. And it came out great. Seeing the other comments, I initially used a pound of crab meat - but even that wasn't enough. I ended up using a pound and a half (glad  I bought the extra!). I think if I'd tried it with just a cup it would've been crab soup. Definitely need to reduce the amount of dressing or increase the amount of crab in the recipe. But it tastes great, and was super easy!
