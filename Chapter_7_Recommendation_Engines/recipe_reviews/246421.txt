Super yummy healthy alternative to regular gumbo. I used 1 pound chicken, 1 pound shrimp, and 1 pound chicken sausage that I had on hand. Turned out great.

Pretty good for a no-roux healthier gumbo. Good taste and flavor.

Added rice, shrimp and okra as suggested. Okra is a must for this not only in flavor but as a thickener since there is no roux. The one mega flaw in this recipe is not calling for celery. While I'm not a cajun food expert, celery is indeed the holy trinity and a must. I ended up adding a tablespoon of cajun blackening spice which I felt a must too. For the turkey sausage I used a turkey kielbasa. Overall good flavor, easy and one I would make again with my tweaks.

We loved it. Not really gumbo without roux but itâ€™s great with some rice added in

Really delicious! I did omit the turkey sausage (since I'm not a big fan of that), but still turned out great. One thing the original recipe left out was celery since it's part of the "Holy Trinity" of gumbo cooking, which I added 1 chopped stalk. While I was sad to not add the traditional dark roux, I did put in two whole okra to thicken. Left it on low while I was at work and all I needed to do was make some brown rice when I returned.
