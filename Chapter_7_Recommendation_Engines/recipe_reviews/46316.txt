I have made this recipe several times, always to rave reviews. Made it most recently with prepackaged "stovetop" stuffing mix, adding the herbs listed in the recipe (we love herb-rich recipes!). Served with simply prepared sweet potatoes, quartered, boiled and augmented with dried cranberries added  the last five minutes with a teaspoon of sweet butter. Simple, easy, and made the house smell like Thanksgiving.

These were tasty.  Very tender, & the stuffing turned out delish, I made extra stuffing which was very similar to this recipe (slow cooker stuffing, also on this web site) on the side because we are stuffing lovers!  Thanks Charles!

Turkey legs were .99/lb. at the store, so I thought I would try this recipe.  I love turkey, and especially dark meat, and I was really hoping this recipe would taste like a little Thanksgiving.  No such luck.  The legs were extremely bland - and I even added onion powder and garlic powder to the salt and pepper.  It was moist though, but thats dark meat for you.  The stuffing, however, was really good, even though I had omitted the walnuts and cranberries.  Thats why this recipe got 3 stars, without the stuffing I would probably only rate this 1 star.  I also used chicken broth in place of the water, and doubled the stuffing recipe - glad I did that, b/c even after doubling, my husband and I (the only ones eating) only got one scoop of stuffing each.  I'm not a picky eater, but I did not like these turkey legs.

This was good but not great.  I liked the list of ingredients but just did not have a lot of flavor.  Maybe if you opened the packet and let the drum legs brown up a little bit it would have been OK.

I made this but made a small change by making stuffed boneless legs. I used two whole turkey legs with thighs still attached. Cracked the bone at the "ankle" and deboned the whole leg (leaving the end of the ankle still on). Then stuffed each one and secured with skewers. Elegant stuffed boneless turkey for the dark meat lovers! Thanks Charles for your recipe and reminding me of my boneless preparation.

Thanks Charles' grandma!  This is indeed a tasty, easy and inexpensive recipe.  Even when I added a step (sauteed veg for stuffing before mixing with breadcrumbs) it still only took 30 minutes to prepare and then was unwatched in the oven. I did remove the skin from the turkey legs but they were still moist and delicious.  Even my meat-avoiding preschoolers gobbled this up--not to mention my husband who nearly sucked the bones dry!

I loved it! I did double the stuffing as suggested by others and forgot to put the egg in it which didn't matter. It turned out fabulous.

These turkey legs need much longer than 1 hour to cook.  After 1 hour I took them out of the oven and grilled them for another 30 minutes over medium heat.  The stuffing was very tasty.

Okay but not quite what I am looking for.  My youngest son really liked the stuffing after he picked out the cranberries.  He had two helpings of that.  Thanks Charles

Turned out real well.  I used a stove top stuffing, but added herbs and spices as per recipe. Cut slits in the legs and stuffed chopped onion. Baked at 400 F for one hour, and everything was well done and succulent.  Served with baked sweet potatoes and cranberry sauce.  Easy and very welcome as an alternative to other meats and fish.

This was yummy! I did substitute a box stuffing mix, but still was outstanding in flavor and tenderness. I would use this recipe again.

This is delicious! I loved the stuffing. I really did not like the texture of the bread crumbs though. For a more authentic texture, I will use actual crumble corn bread. The turkey legs really didn't have much flavor but they were REALLY juicy.

These were a hit at Thanksgiving. I used 2 legs and 2 thighs; each in their own foil package. At the end, I opened each package and turned on the broiler. This helped crisp up the meat. We didn't have any turkey leftover. I brined the turkey for 24 hours. Thank you for this recipe.

Didn't care for this one.  It wasn't bad, just not as what I expected with the reviews.  Not keeper for me.

Good. Need to double the stuffing portion to make enough for everyone. Turkey needs to cook a bit longer, or higher temp than recipe calls for.

Made this on a cold day when it was great to have the oven on!
It was tastey. Roasted carrots inside with the legs & dressing.

12/09-The filling was great although I would prefer it without walnuts. The turkey legs were tough; I ended up using them to make turkey soup.

Thanks Charles! It was awesome! I didn't have any sage or walnuts, but I did subsitute almonds for the walnuts and it was amazing! Thank you and we are going to make the same stuffing for this Thanksgiving.

The turkey was little bland, although this is a very good idea.
