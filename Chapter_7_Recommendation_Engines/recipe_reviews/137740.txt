This soup was hearty and so flavorful. The only thing I did different was added Thyme and two shredded carrots. It's great with a hearty grain bread to dip in it. Try this soup, you won't regret it.

I'm giving this 4 starts as written.  It's very easy to make and is very tasty, but I thought it was missing something.  I tried making it again and added more cayenne pepper and lots of hot curry.  Once I added the the curry it was more the taste I was looking for.

Made it today and turned out great!  I don't have a processor so I just diced the eggplant after roasting.  Also added sliced baby red potatoes.  Filling and has nice sweet garlic flavour!

EXTREMELY delicious. Instead of half-and-half, I used organic nonfat milk and 1 egg. Added more cayenne pepper as well. I thought it tasted better when I cooled it down then reheated it the next day.

Super yummy! I was nervous about all the eggplant seeds and spent a lot of time separating the seeds from the eggplant, but in the end it didn't matter because the food processor pulverized the whole thing. I used the milk/cornstarch trick - the consistency was very nice. I added some spinach, too, just because I had it on hand and didn't want it to go bad.

I made this as written, except for omitting Worcestershire sauce. Delicious!!! Very filling, and a nice warming soup for a cold day. I think next time I will increase the cayenne, as I couldn't tell there was any. This is definitely a keeper!

This soup is epic! I made it vegetarian with vegetable broth and vegan Worcestershire sauce substitutions. I also increased the cayenne to 1/8 tsp., which was fine but may not have been necessary. My husband normally loathes eggplant, but he LIKED this soup. I'd list this one among my top 5 favorite soups of all time.

This was very good!  I followed the recipe exactly since this was my first try.  I only have one suggestion.  Cook the eggplant twice as long and at 325-350 degrees.  My onions were starting to burn before I felt the eggplant was soft enough.  I finally fished them & the garlic out of the pan and let the eggplant finish.  All-in-all my husband and I really liked it.  Thanks for sharing this!  Eggplant soup was a new one to me!

This soup is wonderful I can't wait to try it tomorrow.  I used two Knorr Tom Yam bouillon cubes that I bought when I was in Singapore instead of the cayenne pepper.  I also add some fresh rosemary to the batch.  I left out the Worcestershire sauce because I'm not fond of it.  Just a wonderful delicious soup and a great way to use eggplant.

YUM!  YUM!!  YUMMY!!!
I made this on a whim, looking for a creative way to prepare eggplant and this is it!
My husband and I will probably eat the whole pot before tomorrow's lunch!
I didn't make any changes - used all fresh veggies in my new food processor and it is delicious!
Thanks for posting such a healthy alternative to "fried eggplant"!
KUDOS!!! :)

Added more cayenne for more kick, since other reviewers said the amount called for was almost unnoticeable. We enjoyed it with a nice whole grain and seed crusty bread. Since we don't normally have half and half on hand, I just used roughly half heavy cream and half milk. Also, I used an immersion (stick) blender right in the pot, which worked perfectly.

Excellent soup.  I used a potato instead of the eggplant and added 1/2 tsp. oregano.  I will be making this again.

This recipe was quite nice. The only changes I have done due to the lack of the correct amount of tomato paste and no half and half. I had only 1 tbsp of paste so I added about 1/2 of diced tomatoes with not too much juice. And subed the half half for milk with 1tbsp of cornstarch in it for thickening agent.The final result was quite good since I am not a big fan of eggplant.

This was an excellent soup, I will add lump crab meat next time. That will take it to the next level and will not add a lot of fat or calories.

I didn't make it exactly like the recipe. Instead of half and half I used 1/4 cup buttermilk and 1 cup of heavy whipping cream. I used hunts tomato sauce for the tomato puree. I also added some red pepper flakes as well as ancho chili powder to add a bit of kick. I cooked some spinach in there as well as was recommended by another down below because I too had some spinach in the fridge that needed used. This was a fantastic base for a recipe and you can really play with the ingredients to make it just right.

Absolutely delicious!
I was debating between rating 4 or 5 stars, because I modified the recipe a bit, but I think what's listed here is a great base to which you can add your preference of additional spices/ingredients.

First of all, I had so much eggplant from the garden (and no food scale) that I guesstimated doubling the batch would be best. I only used 1 cup of tomato puree (in the double batch) because that's all I had. I took the recommendations from others and added a lot more cayenne (maybe 2-3x) as well as curry and some thyme. I used light cream and I doubt there's a taste difference from the full - great consistency.

Turned out wonderful. Definitely recommend. Don't be afraid to add your favorite spices/extra ingredients, though I'm sure it's great by itself.

Simple ingredients, not the quickest dish to make, but I've never made soup before and it wasn't hard.  It is unique and flavorful, and my family loved it! Not many people I know can say they've had eggplant soup, so it was definitely worth trying!  I didn't have cayenne pepper, but used a little paprika and it still tasted great.  I had to make my own tomato puree, but that hardly took any time at all, and I didn't have half-and-half, so I used the milk/cornstarch trick I saw in one of the other comments.  Overall a great dish!  I highly recommend it.

excellent soup.  I added chicken and more onion and okra because I was trying to duplicate a soup that I had recently and loved! This was really good.

I found this pretty easy to make (I did it in stages--roasted the eggplants in the morning and put it together in the afternoon) and it really is good--filling as another person mentioned.  It benefits from having a splash of worchestershire sauce in it, and it is great with some chewy bread.

I found the soup bland and unappetizing looking due to the color. It would be better as a soup base instead of as is.

So this turned out better than I was expected, but I did do a couple things differently. First, I should note that I only had one eggplant and I had no idea how much it weighed, so I kinda wung it in regards to that. I also only had one box of chicken stock, which is 4 cups, so I used chicken bouillon cubes and water for the remaining liquid. In the future, I will be peeling the eggplant before I roast it, because it was a pain in the a** doing it afterwards. I'll just wrap it in foil to make sure it doesn't dry out. 

I did use just a dash of cayenne, (albeit a *healthy* dash) and I also added several dashes of curry powder, which I think added a reeeeally nice flavor. I used 1/4 cup of heavy cream, and 1 cup of half and half. 

At the end, I didn't throw all the soup in the blender, instead I just filtered out the chunks of eggplant and garlic and pureed those instead, then stirred it back in. 

My boyfriend also insisted on frying up a few slices of pastrami, and tossing that in as well (after chopping it into pieces, of course) and it added a nice flavor.

This is seriously good soup. It's different than any other soup I've had before, and I'll definitely be making it again. I might stir in a little goat cheese the next time. Mmmmm

I would definitely have it again. I needed something tasty for someone who could only have liquids and everyone enjoyed it. I didn't have any cayenne on hand so I used some curry powder instead.

Just made the soup, it turned out amazing! My husband thought he was in a French restaurant :-) The color turned out beautiful! I added just a little bit more homemade tomato sauce from an Italian restaurant that's close to us. Also, I used whole milk instead of half-and-half.

I had an excess of eggplant from the local farmers market and thought this would be a great recipe to use it up.  I love garlic and eggplant, so I thought it would be a great combination.  The roasted garlic smelled amazing, but when the soup was finally ready, I was quite disappointed.  The tomato puree overpowered the eggplant and the color and appearance were not appetizing at all.  It didn't really have the creamy texture of a chowder or bisque.  In fact, it reminded me of baby food.  It may be better leaving it a chunky soup as some reviewers suggested.  Also, I think the directions make it more difficult than necessary.  The recipe has you peel the eggplant after it's roasted.  That was difficult and time consuming.  Next time, I'll peel it first and wrap it in foil to keep it from drying out.  I ended up adding more garlic and more cayenne to boost the flavors and then I topped it with crumbled feta.  It was much better then, but couldn't make the texture better.  I may make it again if I ever need to use up a lot of eggplant, but it won't be one that I go to often and I'll try some variations from other reviewers.

Subbed in tomato paste and milk and added roasted red pepper.  At first I wasn't too keen on the just-made soup - flavor was very subtle and it didn't seem to taste as good as the ingredients before they went into the soup. But as the days went on, the flavor kept getting better and better.  Don't think it will be on my regular soup schedule, but when I want something 'different', this will be it. PS - For my last bowl, I added some mild-med grating cheese - wow

This is SOOO delicious. Added only 1 cup of half and half, a little more cayenne and some paprika. About 3oz. of tomato paste instead of purée and added the Worcestershire at same time which is not indicated in recipe.  I used an immersion blender.  I will make this again for sure!

I followed this recipe as written with no variations and the end result was just BLAH. At that point, I added rosemary and thyme as some suggested and let it simmer a bit longer --- still blah with a slight hint of flavor. I'm not a huge fan of eggplant so I thought it may have just been me so I brought my son-in-law and grandson in as tasters --- they adore all things eggplant --- and it was thumbs down from both.

Two hours later, it had a miniscule improvement of flavor. A day later, a little better but still nothing I would make again. I think I'll try adding some cubes/slices of leek and fennel and see if I can rescue it. Maybe even some kind of flavorful sausage (kielbasa??).

I LOVED this recipe! I skipped on the onions because they're my nemesis, but it still came out great!!! I topped it with croutons and fresh shredded parmesan and it really added to it!

What a surprisingly good soup! The only changes I made were replacing the half and half with unsweetened almond milk, and adding 1 cup of roasted red/yellow peppers to the mix. Can't believe how good this was. I saved time by using a handheld blender. This recipe is definitely a keeper!

It can feel a little silly to review a recipe that you ended up changing... but wanted to share b/c it was a great success. I had 2 small zucchini that needed to go, so I poked holes in them and roasted them alongside the garlic and eggplant. Peeled and cut them up when I did the eggplant. Other reviewers mentioned rosemary and thyme, so I figured why not and put a scant 1/4 tsp of each along with the cayenne pepper. My husband and I like a little spice, so the amount of cayenne I used was 1/8 tsp + 1 dash. I didn't measure the amount of onion - just diced up about 1/2 of a small-medium sized one and called it good. The soup turned out great. The zucchini was an excellent addition I wouldn't think to leave out when I make this again!
