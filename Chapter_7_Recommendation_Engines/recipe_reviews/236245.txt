I took a risk on this dish with only one other review and I was pleasantly surprised! I did make several modifications based on what was available in the house. I had no butternut squash soup but I did have homemade puree so I used that with additional chicken broth. I made my own Ras al hanout from a recipe I found on Epicurious (minus the allspice and cloves since I had none and generally dislike these). I served it with rice for husband and Naan for me. My husband who despises raisins thought it was really good. I would definitely make this again!

I make this in the slow cooker and it turns out absolutely fab! Just throw all the ingredients straight into the slow cooker and put it on low for four hours! Serve with some rice. Yum! A family favorite in our house. (And, it is equally delish with frozen winter squash as it is with the butternut soup by the way.)

I did not need the extra salt and used one less teaspoon of the ras el hanout. Otherwise, followed recipe. Served over jasmine rice.

I love this recipe. It is a great dish that really warms you up on a cold autumn/ winter day. I had to make the Ras el Hanout from a recipe online which was easy to find.

If you are planning on making it, you better like cinnamon and cloves. They are powerful in this recipe.

This is very good,  a nice stew for a cold winter day.  I had a quart of butternut squash soup in the cupboard that I needed to use up, and I followed the recipe exactly with excellent results.   I  served the Chicken Casablanca over jasmine rice.

This was a great dish to make that doesn't contain fancy hard-to-find ingredients yet it makes a very fun and interesting ethnic dish!
We eat low/no carb around here and this dinner hit the spot for us. Just delicious. We did not have ras-el-hanout spice blend BUT we had a bottle of vinegar flavored with ras-el-hanout spices and herbs, from the farmers market. So I marinaded the chicken in the vinegar blend and added some of the vinegar to the dish while it was cooking. The flavors came across very well. The cinnamon and raisins were just perfect, too.

It was a little sweeter than I expected, so I added some cayenne pepper to contrast the sweetness. It was great over rice.

Used the morrocan spice blend recipe from Epicurious--the sauce was a little spicy from the ginger  but very flavourful. Did not add salt because I used Better than Bouillon which is already salty. Family enjoyed it. I will certainly make it again. Served with a rice/lentil blend and sauteed butternut squash.

This was not an enjoyable recipe. I wonder if they made a mistake with the amount of seasonings. Maybe it should have been teaspoons instead of tablespoons. Nancy

I was extremely disappointed with this. I followed it completely and made no changes. It had a wonderful fragrance, but it didn’t live up to my expectations. I truly wanted to love this as it sounded delicious, but I won’t make this again.

I followed recipe as written except I threw in the whole can of chicken broth instead of just one cup. I looked up the Ras el Hanout recipe on this site. This dish is very flavorful and quite spicy. I had to put a dollop of sour cream on mine. I served over brown rice. I think the title is a little misleading. I think of Italian when I hear Casablana, but this has a more morrocan type flavor. For my taste next time I will double the peas and add a whole cup of raisins and use some more chicken breast. Really great dinner for colder months!

I have made this receipt several times it's definitely one of my favorite things to make. I always use an online receipt for the ras el hanout. It's delicious every time!

This was delicious as written.  I was concerned about adding so much cinnamon but it was great.  Had a nice spicy flavor but well balanced.  The only change I made was using vegetable broth instead of chicken as I already had a container open.  I served with brown rice.  If I can make one recommendation it would be to add more chicken.  I used one pound but could have put around 1/2 - 3/4 more as this made a lot of juice.  Could also add some more peas to stretch it a little.
