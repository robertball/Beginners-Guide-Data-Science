Delicious! Delicious! Delicious! Followed the recipe accurately except for the quantities, can't weigh out grams of this and grams of that... next time it'll come out a bit different - that's the joy of cooking. I used frozen beans and corn and served on basmati rice. Saved and on my list to make again very soon. Thank you.

We've made this many times now and it's always a mind-blower!  Always best when the green beans are nice and fresh and tender.  Made it once with sub-par coconut milk...that was a mistake.  Omitted the lemon grass, otherwise followed the recipe.  The sauce is soupy buy we just add an arrowroot slurry at the end and it thickens it right up.  Will make this again and again and again...

The texture of this curry is really thin, so only use a necessary amount of coconut milk, DO NOT use the whole can. I also thought that the taste was a bit too sour. Otherwise, this would make a good green curry.

I had to omit the lemon grass as it was way too woody to put through the food processor. The only other changes I made were to add more soy sauce (low-sodium) and a splash of fish sauce. I'm not a big fan of canned baby corn but they worked great in this recipe. Served it over wide rice noodles as that's what I had on hand. Good stuff! Thanks, Lee!

I've made this several times and love it. I usually use pan fried tofu instead of prawns and change up the veggies. I also cut down the lime juice a bit, maybe use only one lime instead of two. I've also made the mistake of using low fat coconut milk which was awful - the regular coconut milk really helps cut the heat and thicken the sauce. I agree with other reviews that you can cut down the amount of milk, however.

Delicious and very fragrant! I used 1 lime instead of 2 because it seemed like a lot, yet it still turned out a little on the sour side so I added some sugar and chopped cashews to soften it. As others mentioned, the consistency was watery. Don't skim on the coconut milk because that's what balances out the lime, I used flour to thicken it and it turned out great. Stir in a teaspoon of fish sauce at the end for perfection!

4 stars with my addition of 2 tsp fish sauce and about 1/2 of the coconut milk.  I felt it was a good base recipe, but wasn't at it's best without the fish sauce.

Very tasty curry, but the texture was too soupy. I used only 3/4 can coconut milk and I couldn`t thick it. I used more soy sauce too. I think, you can use chicken (or maybe beef) in this recipe and make it without green beans and corn (or add later). It will be a great dish.

The sauce seemed really unbalanced. First, it was too sour; I added a teaspoon of brown sugar. Then, I added salt—but there was still something missing. We were halfway through dinner before I jumped up, saying, "FISH SAUCE. I knew it was missing something! No 'umami'"! That made it much better. I added red bell pepper and some sliced zucchini and yellow squash instead of baby corn. Leftovers were delicious.

Doesn't everybody have an idea of the perfect curry at their fav Thai restaurant? We sure do, and after reading all the reviews I tweaked it to our taste and this came out very good. I skipped one of the limes after reviewers complained of too much lime. I also subbed a generous tablespoon of lemongrass paste (instead of mincing lemongrass)to make it a bit easier. Added a couple teaspoonsful of fish sauce and used full fat coconut milk. After all that, it was still pretty tart from the lime so I added a couple tablespoons of coconut sport (cream of coconut) to sweeten it and give the sauce a more pronounced coconut flavor. With my changes it was pretty darned close to our favorite restaurant green curry. Topped it with a a handful of fresh mint leaves and we were ready to rock.  Thanks so much for sharing this versatile recipe!

Made this a few times, SO delicious! Its fresh and lively flavor is just perfection! I've never successfully procured lemongrass where I live, so this may hamper my version- not that I'd notice b/c it's so good even without it. One tip I'll share is DON'T use "lite" coconut milk, it makes the sauce slimy and ruins the whole recipe. Try this one, I bet you'll have a new favorite!

This recipe is not good!I normally don’t have the patience or time to sign up to a website just to post a review but the sheer awfulness of this recipe must be broadly communicated to save others from wasting time, money and good ingredients!  As many have said, it is too sour, uses too much lemongrass, is too soupy, etc., etc.  We tried to save the dish but you would need to be Harry fricken Potter to do it successfully.  We decided to abandon it and go out for dinner.  Hey Mr. Author, leave the cooking to the initiated please.   Most of the reviewers here are too nice to say it but your recipe is  and they all had to fix it in some way.

Can't give this 5 stars because of the adjustments I made.  First off, fish sauce is a MUST in order to get the authentic taste of this recipe.   Although I went with the green beans, which were good, it REALLY needed to have green pepper strips in it.  
I also made the fresh spring rolls from this site which included Julianne carrots and bean sprouts so I used the left over veggies and threw them into the dish.
My husband LOVED it so much he had a second helping.
I will make this again and probably use the premade curry paste as it is more balanced, IMHO than this particular recipes measurments.

I loved this recipe! I adapt almost every recipe because, well honestly, who doesn't. That being said, I hardly adapted this one at all. Just a little more garlic, a little more soy. And added bamboo shoots, because I love them.

I used this recipe as a base, but as others have mentioned it definitely needs fish sauce!  Even tho I love coconut, I find I enjoy  dish like this much better if I use less coconut milk and substitute some veggie broth.  My veggies of choice are zucchini, red pepper and bean sprouts; but it's very versatile that way.  Serve with noodles or rice in a big soup bowl, and relax about the thin consistency! There are some beautiful green curry pastes out there so often use that as a short cut.
