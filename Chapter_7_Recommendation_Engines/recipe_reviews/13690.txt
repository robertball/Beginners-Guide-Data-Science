If you don't want the ice what I did was, follow the recipe until you get to the part where you place the ingredients in the pan, stop there and place in the refer until it is cold the place in your ice cream maker and you'll have Cranberry Sorbet an excellent body flush and pallet cleaner.

I've made this dessert for years.  I put it in ice cube trays to freeze and whip with a hand mixer just before serving to fluff it.  Add a mint leaf for garnish. Wonderful!

I made this for my families New Year's day dinner & it was a great dessert after a filling meal! The stores were out of fresh crannberries so I used a can of whole cranberries, pureeeing them in the blender first, I decreased the amount of sugar to compensate. After it froze, I let it it sit out for about 10 minutes & them used a fork to rake it...getting a nice consistency of ice crystals & served it in  glass compotes. It made a very presentation! Thansk for sharing the recipe!!!

Easy to make!  I did not strain this; I just blended everything on high to create a smooth consistency. Delicious!

This was used as a palate cleanser.  Very good, but I halved the recipe.  A little goes a long way.  Next time I'll finish it off in my ice cream maker to give it a softer consistency as another reviewer suggested.

Had a bag of cranberries begging to be used up.  Ran across this recipe and thought my "ice cream" loving family would maybe go for it.  They did!  Made as recipe stated, but filled my ice trays, believe it took two (made a 1/2 batch) and froze.  Then to the food processor to "cream" it up before serving.  It was almost addicting to me...a little sweet and tart at the same time, like cranberries are.  Thank you for posting!

Made this for Thanksgiving.I have a Cuisinart Ice Cream Machine. Half is all you can freeze. Used less than 2 cups sugar, taste as you go.

Average. It tasted like there was an ingredient that didnt belong, maybe the lemon.
