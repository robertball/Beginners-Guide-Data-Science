This sure does feed a crowd. It was huge. The casserole was ok. It didn't stand out as something that I would make again, but it wasn't terrible. This is one of those bland so-so recipes. Someone can most likely tweak this and make it pretty good.  =)

I must've tweaked it pretty good because this was AWESOME!!  I used the family sized can of Cream of Mushroom soup, and a lot of swiss cheese.  Since I was making it for a pot luck, and wanted some to keep at home, I made 1 and 1/2 times the recipe.  Used 3 bags of vegetables, 1 6 oz can of onions, and the proper amount of (lite) sour cream.  We will be eating this again.

I could only find 10.75 oz cans of soup; so, I used a full three cans of 98% fat free soup. To lighten this recipe up a bit I used reduced fat swiss cheese and fat free sour cream. I had some plain bread crumbs that I needed use before the expiration date; so I eliminated the onions and used 1/2 a cup of bread crumbs all mixed in (none reserved for the topping). I then added about a tbsp of onion powder to keep some of the onion flavor. I put the veggies in frozen increased the cooking time to 45 minutes and the veggies turned out perfect! This was easy and delicious! I will definitely make it again.

I fixed this dish for Thanksgiving and it was definitely a "crowd pleaser".....there wasn't a morsel leftover.

I love this recipe and it is so easy which is a huge plus.  It is just me and my husband so I thought we would have a lot of leftovers but my husband ends up eating it all!  Easy to tweak too, I am a vegetarian so I like to add the protein crumbles.

Made this for the first time for Easter dinner. Boy did the family love it! I increased the cheese a little as well as the french fried onions. This was a total winner and will be making this again.

It made a lot, but it wasn't a dish that I would remember.  It was just ok.
