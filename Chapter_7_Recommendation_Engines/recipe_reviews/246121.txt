I haven't made this recipe, but the flaw I believe is in using a pressure cooker to speed up time. The best beef bone stock I have made was with 4 marrow bones simmering in a Crock pot for 4 days. I had to add water three times to top up. It was jello, deep red brown and 1 tablespoon to a pot of rice added big flavour. the bones crumbled and i strained by the end of it.

If you switch to a Crock-Pot and follow this recipe, cooking for 1 day minimum at low heat (use high heat to get pot to a simmer then turn to low) this recipe will be top notch. to avoid cooking out all of the nutrients in the vegetables I recommend adding 2-4 hours to stock before you plan to cool it down.

I followed the ingredients and directions exactly and even used 1 pound 8 oz. of beef bones. The results were watered down "where's the beef" stock. To no fault of the submitter there probably wasn't enough beef on the bones. I will try this again using beefier bones with the hopes of raising this to 5 stars. This has a lot of potential. Stay tuned.

The one way I altered this recipe was that I cooked the bones until they were brown  and the onions which for around 90 minutes and then I deglazed the pan . Yes it was brown and burnt but I figured that would be adding flavoring
I only pressure cooked it for 30 minutes .

My bones came from a prime rib roast so I skipped the roasting part.  I turned out great
