I changed this dressing to give it more of an authentic Asian style flavor by substituting sesame oil for the olive oil and it ended up tasting GREAT!! I also added some pepper for a bit of a kick along with chopped green onions...what a delicious flavor!

The only reason I didn't give this recipe five stars is I made the recommended changes that other reviewers posted.  I cut the soy sauce to 1/4 cup.  I used 1/2 cup olive oil and 1/4 cup sesame oil, and since my carafe was too small I didn't add the water.  I did however have to stop myself from eating the dressing with a spoon.  This stuff is great.  Only additional change I would possibly make is to add more vinegar or less honey, I found it a little too sweet.

My wife loves the ginger dressing you get at japaneese restaurants! When I made this she flipped! It was great. I did however take the suggestion of half the called for soy sacuce.

This is a fantastic recipe and will make it again! I did make a few changes that everyone has loved: I omit the water, and use 1-2Tbs. sugar instead of honey. Instead of olive oil, I used half vegetable oil and half sesame oil. I also added 2 Tbs. fresh lime juice, and chopped green onions, then blended with food processor/blender for the right texture. I have made this dressing a few times and with the little adjustments are always a hit with everyone.

I love the ginger dressing at my favorite Japanese Steakhouse, and this is close.  I cut the amount of soy in half, and substituted half of the olive oil with sesame oil.  It was very good in salad with grilled chicken and mandarin oranges.  I have even marinated my chicken in the dressing, and it makes great marinade.

This is exactly what I was looking for, and it tasted fantastic on the Almond Mandarin Salad also on this web site. I did substitute half the olive oil for sesame oil & left out the water, which I think made a really big (and positive) difference.

I cut down on the soy sauce and added some sesame oil in place of half of the olive oil. I also toasted a few spoons of sesame seeds and added them as well. I used this as the dressing in both a garden salad and a chinese chicken pasta salad. I let the pasta salad marinate in the mixture overnight and it was really good.

Our favorite dressing!  We use reduced sodium soy sauce and agave instead of honey sometimes and it's still delicious!  Another great tip to avoid wasting ginger - peel it, stick it in a freezer bag and freeze it!  It's actually easier to grate frozen anyway.

Good recipe!  I followed the other review suggestions and only used 1/2 cup of soy.  I realized after making the dressing that I had forgotten the water, but it didn't matter!  I liked having a creamy, tangy dressing with bite!  My two friends that I shared it with said they could drink it straight!

The amount of soy sauce called for in this recipe is way too much!!  Either reduce it dramatically or triple the honey.  I used ground ginger and red wine vinegar.  Don't think I'll make this again.  Thanks anyway.

This dressing is flavorful with a lovely hint of ginger sweetened with honey! I scaled this down to only two servings, cutting back on the amount of olive oil plus adding a little sesame oil. I grated fresh ginger (thumb size), added 2 garlic cloves, minced, little rice vinegar, to taste, and about 1 T of honey. I added fresh ground black pepper and one stalk of green onion, minced, to the dressing. I used low-sodium soy sauce (Aloha brand), to taste. I omitted the water. With the adjustments I made, I give this dressing a 5 stars. However, because I added the sesame oil and green onions I'd have to give this a 4 stars. There is room to adjust the amount of honey and vinegar depending on how much sweetness or tartness you prefer. If I were to make this dressing again, I would definitely cut back on the amount of olive oil. I do think this dressing is tasty. And with the addition of the sesame oil and green onions it gives this the "Asian" flair that I was looking for in a dressing! I drizzled this over a bed of fresh organic mixed greens and ate this with, "Sesame Seared Tuna," and "Sweet Pepper Rice," also from this website.

I added 1/4 cup peanut butter which made it delish.  I also put it in the blender to emulsify because the garlic and ginger were dropping to the bottom.  Love this dressing, but I think the peanut butter just tops it off!

Pretty good, just like the one of the brands sold here in Japan.  Will let it age a bit and see if the flavor improves, otherwise I'll add more ginger next time.

This was delicious!  I used 1/2 c. olive oil 1/4 c. sesame oil and followed some of the others advice.  3 scallions, 2 tbls. fresh lime juice, no water and used 2 tbls. honey and only 1/2 the soy sauce called for...wow! Put it over greens, red cabbage, red bell pepper, chicken and chopped peanuts.  Huge flavor!

Mmmmmm!! We have a dressing almost exactly like this one at the restaurant I work at and I always wanted to copy the recipe but this one does the job. As recommended by other reviewers I did half olive oil, half seseme seed oil and halved the amount of soy sauce. I realized at the last minute I had white wine vinegar, not rice vinegar but it worked just the same. As a personal touch I toasted about 1/2 tsp seseme seeds and added them. They add so much flavor and are so easy, just lay them on some foil in the toaster oven at 450, watch them closely because they only take a minute or two, every second counts! I let it sit in the fridge several hours before hand, it came out delicious. My only change would be to add a little more vinegar to make it more like the version at my restaurant.

Take everyone's acvice and cut the soy in half and replace 1/2 the olive oil with sesame oil.  I love garlic, but 3 raw cloves in this dressing was a bit much, so I reduced that too.  I also skipped the step with the honey and the water.  I do enjoy this dressing a great deal and it does remind me of that ginger dressing in Japanese Restaurants!

This is fabulous dressing. I didn't have time to let it cool, so instead of adding the water before microwaving it I just threw in a few ice cubes afterwards to cool it off. Shake it up and you're good to go. So refereshing and delicious!

Great sauce. My husband enjoyed it!! I used the advice and used less soy sauce. Tasted just like the restaurant style, except the consistency was a little watery. Used this sauce in a Chicken Salad, with tomatos, cucumbers, red pepper, and salad mix. Excellent-- if you love ginger dressing!! Will make again!

This is really good- I don't know how close it is to restaurants- seems to be right on to me. This is the first dressing I have made myself and it is very easy and very delicious. I even use it to liven up pasta- I toss it with pasta and diced chicken, a little green onion, some peanuts and voila dinner.

I thought this dressing was ok, but it called for way too much soy sauce, therefore making it really salty.  I also tried using half olive oil and half sesame seed oil to make it more authentic.  That part of the dressing was good.  If I were to make this again, I would cut the amount of soy sauce in half.

It was a great addition to the asian themed dinner I made last night.  My mom thought it was perfect... not to sweet, not too bitter.  My sister thought it could have used a tbsp more honey and I agree.  i thought that with the striking asian flavors of the pad thai with peanuts and shrimp and the chicken fried rice, a sweeter ginger dressing would have worked even better.  so I would add one more tbsp of honey :)  other than that, WONDERFUL!

Really liked this. I changed this based on other comments: vinegar (1/4c), soy sauce (1/3c) and olive oil(1/2c), ginger 2 tbsp, 2 tbsp honey and I cut out the water. I also added 1tsp brown sugar to sweeten this some more. Hint: Store the ginger in your freezer, this way you can just grate it into recipes..works great, lasts longer!

Actual I was a little concerned about how much soy sauce was being used, but I added a tbsp of ground ginger powder and a red habenero pepper to the batch and couldn't get enough of it!!

Delicious.  I would have given it five stars if it had sesame oil (which I added myself).

Every one I serve this recipe to wants to have it.  I did make the recommendations from others about using sesame oil and reducing the soy sauce.  Delicious!

I wanted to preserve the flavors and nutrients and, so, opted not to cook/heat the dressing. I blended all ingredients with two small carrots (for color) and this was excellent! :)

I actually used this as a stir fry marinade by cutting down on the oil (used less than 1/4 c.), soy sauce, vinegar, etc.  I didn't add any water.  Dumped it in the veggies in the wok and WOW! They came out great! Will definately use again, great flavor. Thanks!

Yuck. This was nothing like what I thought. Maybe after it marries for a few days it'll taste better. The watery consistency was completely wrong. My husband liked it, though.

Did you know that heating honey in the microwave kills all the good nutrients??  Add the honey AFTER the rest has been heated let sit for a minute to melt the honey then continue as usual.

Loved this dressing!  The only thing I did differently is to use my immersion blender for mixing instead of shaking.  This made the dressing creamier in consistency.

Excellent salad dressing for any type of salad (not just Asian). If I'm entertaining, my family "special-requests" that I make this dressing (they don't care about the entree). For variety, I sometimes substitue carrot juice for water.

This was extremely tasty, but I wish I did not follow some of the popular reviews and changes.  I did change it to 1/2 EVOO and 1/2 sesame oil - I think the ratio of sesame oil was too much - kind of last that chalky aftertaste that sesame oil sometimes creates.  I halved the soy sauce initially, but found that I need to put the other half in to create the right flavor.  Regardless, the taste was incredible of a mandarin orange salad, and I will definitely make again - but as written!

Really good recipe, with a little changes, I used less soy sauce and since I couldn't find rice wine vinegar, I added red wine vinegar.  Still turned out great!  Everyone wanted the recipe!

Pretty good. Just one serious FYI: if you make this as is, unless you only use a small amount, this does not make 20 servings. If you use only 2 tbs that's 16 servings. If you use more, it will be even less. That aside, I do like this recipe.  Because I felt like it was missing something, I added about 2 tbs chopped onion and ran the whole thing through the blender. I used 1/2 olive oil and 1/2 sesame oil (which works out to about 1/3 cup each) due to my budget limits and decreased the soy to 1/4 cup. Oh and I also decreased the water to 2 tbs and added 2 tbs ketchup. That seemed to do the trick. Loved it that way and will keep that recipe.

I made this recipe as written. Good thing I tested it before I put it on salad...it was not good. I forgot that I was going to take reviewer's advice and use half sesame oil.  I added some along with some crushed red pepper, microwaved it again and shook it. After that, it was so good! It really needs that sesame flavor in there. Otherwise it just tastes like oil and soy sauce.

Excellent. Subbed Splenda for Honey (6 tbs - b/c I don't think splenda is as sweet as the honey), used 4 cloves of garlic and garlic flavored rice vinegar (I loves me some garlic!). Hubby didn't like it - but he doesnt really go for Asian cuisine anyway. This is great as a marinade or sauce (just add a little corn starch) and fabulous as a salad dressing. Yum!!

I am very impressed with the flavors of this dressing!  I followed the suggestions of others who added sesame oil, and reduced the soy sauce and it was perfect. The sesame oil adds so much more depth.  This has become my new favorite salad dressing!

Delicious! This is the second time I've made this and it's wonderful.  I didn't use olive oil this time, as this recipe had flavor enough to override that oil.  I used canola.  I also added about a tablespoon of sesame oil for flavor.  This is definitely a keeper.

I doubled this recipe as is and used it to marinade (overnight)and barbeque chicken thighs (skin and fat removed). I then reduced the marinade on a stove top with a 1/2 cup of brown sugar and used it to based the chicken.. turned out perfect! Will try again with Turkey thighs.. We love dark meat and they grill perfect.Thanks

This was just like you find in a restaurant.  But one batch is too large for a single gal.  I suggest cutting it in half so it doesn't spoil before it can be finished.

I used the changes as some listed but I used 1/8 cup of rice vinegar + 1/8 cup of fig vinegar , 1/4 cup soy and only 1 tb. honey, 1/8 cup olive oil + 1/8 cup sesame oil , added 2 tb. fresh sallots and only 3 tb. water. I like the fact that it was lighter in oil.and the fig vinegar gives it a bit of sweetness so less honey is needed, used an imulsion blender in the jar and WOW!! what a dressing!!  friends just love it .

This recipe is just fabulous.  I promise, you won't be disappointed.  It feels like a lot when you're making it, but wow, you're going to eat a lot of salad...it's just that good.
I used chinese cabbage, yellow peppers, orange peppers, cucumbers, cranberries, black sesame seeds and steam fried chinese noodles.  
It almost hurts it's that good.

My daughter in law made this last night and I couldn't get enough!  It was delicious.  She did not put any ginger in, but replaced it with 1-2 TBS sesame oil.  I also decreased the soy sauce.  But I will keep this in my frig all the time.

This is the flavor I was looking for when trying to match the asian restaurant dressings that I love.  I just eye-balled the measurements and it came out great.  Taste it before you serve it to see if it has the sweetness level you hope for.  You can also add this dressing to cooked Chicken, Mandarin Oranges, Almonds and Rice to make a delicious Asian Chicken Salad!

I am stingy with 5 star ratings, but this dressing deserves all 5 stars.  I wanted to drink this stuff!  I am pregnant and have been having ginger dressing cravings but going to the local Japanese restaurant means I have to tempt myself with sushi I'm not really supposed to eat. Now I can easily make my own at home. I followed the recipe exactly and it was very similar to the restaurant dressing I love.  I'll be making this often from now on.

I cut the olive oil with sesame oil (1/4 sesame and 1/2 olive oil) and only used 1/4 cup soy and 2 table spoons honey. I also added 1 tablespoon chinese mustard.

This is a great dressing, but I did have to cut back on the soy sauce (used about 1/2 the amount) b/c I could tell it would be way too salty for me if I used all of it.  The fresh ginger is a must and I think sesame oil gives a better asian flavor to the dressing than olive oil.  Thanks for the recipe!

Yummy! I add a splash of lemon juice and sesame oil, extra ginger and no water. I ran out of rice vinegar one time, so I used RAW apple cider vinegar, still great! I also do roughly equal parts; vinegar, soy sauce, and oil. (I like it strong and bold!) I just keep tasting and adjusting it till I get the flavor I want; it depends on my mood. 

This is great on a salad topped with mandarin oranges, slivered almonds, shreaded carrots, edamame, etc..

Oh my goodness! What an incredible yummy salad dressing. So easy to prepare. I substituted Agave for the Honey, it disolves quickly, no need to heat in microwave and I also added a splash of sesame oil because I like the flavor or sesame. So glad I found this recipe

I've made this twice now and boy does it go fast!  I cut the soy sauce in half and use a blend of sesame oil and vegetable oil.  I also omitted the water the second time.  Great stuff!

Wonderful salad dressing! Fragrant and so full of flavor! This recipe can easily be tweaked to individual taste buds and is not have an error. I can see the possibilities as an excellent marinade. Our new favorite! I threw in some seasame seeds. It looked pretty and added to the asian effect.

Excellent, I made this last night to go over a Green stuff only salad.I took the advice of another reviewer and used 1/4 cup of sesame oil. I have been looking for a recipe that was as good as the dressing used in the chinese noodle cabbage salad, but with out all the sugar most of them call for. I used low sodium soy and it worked fine.This fits the bill. Thank you

Delicious! I followed the recipe exactly except for half sesame/half olive oil as suggested by others.  But I did NOT omit the water, because I watch what I eat and the water thins out the dressing without sacrificing the taste.  I can't believe I've always bought dressing when these ingredients are always in my pantry, thank you!

Even though I had to make some changes I am giving this dressing 5 stars.  My husband and I both agreed that this is a delicious Asian dressing.  Instead of olive oil I used peanut oil and sesame oil because that is what I had in my pantry but wow did it give this recipe a big tasty kick.  Will make this again!

Just finished making this dressing for my Asian Cabbage salad....tastes fantastic! Took peoples advice and changed the olive oil actually to grapeseed oil with the addition of a little sesame seed oil seeing it can be overpowering....Thanks for this easy tasty recipe...Cant wait to hear the reviews tomorrow especially since once of them is a Vegan!!!!!

I should have read the comments about the soy first. It tasted good, I had to increase the honey because of the soy overpowering the other ingredients.  I did not have olive oil in my cupboard so I used regular vegetable oil and it still turned out well. I will increase the ginger quantity as well.

Ok I am with the person who had to stop herself from eating this dressing with a spoon!  I served it over mixed baby greens & mandarin oranges with a few toasted almonds and sesame seeds sprinkled on top!  This is my new favorite summer salad dressing.

This is a great recipe!  I am going to try sesame oil and add a few toasted sesame seeds like some other reviews have suggested.  I like using the honey as in the recipe instead of sugar as some other people have suggested because I think it is a healthier and still tastes great.  Will definately be making again!

This is a keeper for sure! I made it in my little food processor/blender, and blending the fresh ginger and garlic with the rest of ingredients made it almost creamy! I cut the unused remainder of my peeled fresh ginger into chunks to freeze for my next batch. As others suggested I did use 1/2 cup olive oil and 1/4 cup sesame oil. I thought the soy sauce and honey were perfect, so that may just be a matter of preference. My kids were asking to pour it on their broccoli last night, so it's not just for salads. Thanks for this tasty recipe!

Really tasty salad dressing.  Complimented my soy honey ginger chicken well. Didn't measure the ingredients out, just splashed them all in and mixed them up, but tasted great and the family all agreed. Thank you!

I subsituted sesame oil for about 1/3 of the olive oil, and used less water.  Great on cabbage/broccoli slaw.

This is a great dressing. I only had white wine vinegar, but that worked just fine.
I love sesame flavor, so I subbed in 1/4 cup sesame oil in place of 1/4 cup of olive oil (out of the total 3/4 cup). 
I suggest adding the 1/4 cup water as hot as possible so it can thin the honey out and allow the flavors to develop a bit from the heat.

Cheers, and thanks for the recipe!!!

Excellent.  Initially I was skeptical because it was very thin and I expected it to be thicker, but it was delicious.  I used low sodium soy sauce and still cut it in half.  I added extra ginger and a little bit of sugar as well.

I made a couple changes the first time I made this on instinct, based on our tastes.  After making it, I will make more changes the next time I make it.  This is a good starting point.  I doubled the ginger, however, as well as the garlic.  In addition to mincing both I mushed them up with a mortar & pestle.  The olive oil made this far too heavy in my opinion.  Next time I will use more rice vinegar, less soy sauce and a half cup (instead of 3/4) of SESAME oil.  Still, with just the additional garlic and ginger it was a very tasty, simple dressing.

I halved the recipe, and I did not heat it the mixture.  I ran out of rice vinegar and substituted Trader Joe's Orange Muscat Champagne Vinegar, and used a very dark grade of honey. I added a bit of toasted oil to the olive oil as well. Also, in lieu of regular soy sauce, I used Bragg's Aminos.  Finally, I used my stick immersion blender to make it smooth.  Absolutely delish!

Nothing like I expected.. I was hoping for the traditional dressing you get in the restaurants.But this was still a good recipe.  I would either decrease the amount of oil or substitute seseme seed oil.

I tried the suggestions of halving the soy sauce and using sesame oil as well as olive oil.  I definately wouldn't recomment the latter unless you're a big fan.  I found the flavour overpowering.  I would suggest instead adding sesame seeds to the dressing to give a hint of flavour.

I substituted Braggs amino acids for soy sauce, used brown rice vinegar, agave nectar 2 tbsp instead of 3 honey, and I always prefer to use the ginger juice rather than the ginger in cooking.......but even with all those changes it was delicious!!!

Very tasty! Definitely use both sesame and olive oils, though - I used only olive oil as that was all I had, and it came out tasting a bit too strongly of soy sauce. With 1/4 cup sesame oil, this definitely becomes a 5 star recipe!

Very nice salad dressing!  I combined 3 recipes from this site to make a restaurant quality salad.  I made the Oven-Roasted Vegetables, the Asian Ginger Dressing and the Seared Ahi Tuna Steaks and put all the above on Romaine Lettuce.  Will definately make all 3 again!

I always loved this dressing when dining out, but wow, making your own is great.
The honey is th epivot for the flavour in this one for me, tangy or sweet, either way, a great dressing recipe.

The people saying that it needs less of this and more of that must have really poor palates.

This dressing is perfect as is.  GREAT dressing for a seared ahi tuna salad.  A+++++!

Delicious!  I also adapted the recipe by halving the soy sauce and using canola and sesame oils.  And it does kill as a marinade for tuna steaks - I used the same proportion but 
decreased the amounts.  My husband licked the plate off... literally.

I thought this was pretty good. I added extra honey, vinegar and water because the soy sauce was a little strong for me. I served it warm over green beans, then sprinkled with red pepper flakes and sesame seeds. I'm going to have it cold tomorrow over salad topped with Ginger Steak (from this site).

I followed the recipe as it says, and I agree there's a bit too much soy sauce.  Loved the flavor, I'll make it again using about half the soy & it should be perfect.  Think I'd like it better with sesame oil, but didn't have any on hand.  I'll try that next time, too.

This was a great recipe!  The flavor comes through better after it's been chilled, so if you're not sure about it when you first make it, try it the next day!!I also put all ingredients in the blender like another reviewer recommended and it comes out great! I pour it on pre shredded cabbage for coleslaw.  It's easy, delicious and not your typical salad!!!

This dressing has a lovely 'light'taste. I did follow others recommendations with reducing soy by 1/2, used 1/2 olive oil 1/2 peanut oil with a tablespoon of sesame oil. Served over a green salad with fish parcels. Family enjoyed - even MIL that I didnt think would like it.

I think this is THE BEST asian dressing I have ever made!  Thank you!  I let it sit and absorb the flavors for a day, then strained it.  Yum.

Yummy and easy! I was half way through making Asian chicken wraps when I realized I didn't have any Asian dressing the fridge. This was easy to make and tasted so good! Just make sure to make it far enough in advance so it has time to cool before putting it on the greens. I had to stick it in the freezer speed it along since I made it mid dinner prep.

I took the advice of other reviewers.  I cut the soy sauce in half, only used a half a cup of olive oil with a 1/4 cup of sesame oil.  one tablespoon of sugar and took a taste.  I thought I was in a oriental restaurant tonight.  I'm having homemade shrimp rolls and salad tonight.  I will have to figure out what I'm going to feed my yorkie.

I made it tonite as an afterthought... I had made Chicken Stir-Fry by Katie Sechrist on this site tonite and had minced more ginger than needed for that recipe and thought, what the heck (I had cleaned romaine and a ginger salad sounded too good). I made the recipe to a "t" without looking at any reviews and really liked it. Afterwards I realized I hadn't added any water, but I didn't miss it at all. But the dressing hadn't had any time to sit in the fridge to let the flavors really come out, and I noticed the ginger and garlic all fell to the bottom. After dinner cleanup, I looked at the reviews and noticed some things I would love to do to it, and probably will: add a bit of sesame oil, blend the whole mix in a blender/food processor til smooth, and finish with some chopped green onion. I like the idea of adding a bit of toasted sesame seeds too. I saw many reviews saying the amount of soy sauce was too much, but I used less sodium soy sauce and the taste was great, not overpowering or too salty.  Tastes like a restaurant quality dressing. I think the blending will make the texture spot on.

This was a very tasty dressing! I also appreciated how simple it was to prepare. I used it as a dressing for shredded red cabbage & carrots I made for a potluck & everyone enjoyed it & asked for the recipe. This will be one of my staple salads.

We were looking for a quick dressing for our tofu salad, and this recipe was perfect. We halved the recipe, and following CHI BA's suggestion, we substituted sesame oil for olive oil (about 1 tbp less than suggested since some reviewers commented that it was oily). We also added about a tbsp of peanut butter to make the dressing creamier and give it a nutty flavor. We mix our dressings in workout shaker ball bottles so this came together in no time. Everyone at the table agreed that this dressing was so good, we have to make a gallon it and aren't allowed to make another dressing "from now until forever." Definitely one for the recipe box!

Made Asian Ginger dressing to put on my broccoli slaw. Let just say this - YUM!!! Let me give you all a heads up;  READ THE REVIEWS before making! My changes were half the soy sauce (I used 1/4 cup Organic Low Sodium Tamari) I didn't have sesame oil so I used 1/4 cup coconut oil and 1/2 olive oil. To get the sesame taste, I toasted some sesame seeds and threw all that into my Magic Bullet. Added honey to taste. I put more sesame seeds in it afterward. Then I poured generously over the broccoli slaw, added sliced almonds and since I didn't have mandarin oranges, I sliced dried apricots and threw that in. Enjoy!

It is much better when you use only half a garlic clove. Three whole cloves is way too much. Also a bit less soy and a touch of sesame oil makes it better.

I love the ginger dressing at our regular sushi joint. Although this was not the same it was very good. My hubby loved it. I only had 1 tbs. of fresh ginger to use, but other than that and using an emersion blender to mix, I followed this recipe exactly.  I liked the texture of the dressing without the chunks of ginger so using the blender left all the flavor w/o the chunks. I will make it again, but I think I will try it with sesame oil instead of olive next time.

I'm giving it four stars JUST BECAUSE I did make changes.  Instead of 3/4 cup olive oil, I used 1/4 C sesame oil and 1/2 cup olive oil.  A few years ago I put garlic cloves in a jar and steeped them in EVOO, and they've been that way ever since.  I used that oil.  Also instead of water I used juice off manderine oranges.  Man, I would make this again in a heart beat.  I may have to, too. :)

Followed other suggestions with using half the soy sauce, no water and half olive oil w/half sesame oil and really liked it!  Instead of mincing the garlic, I pressed mine and also doubled all the ingredients into a quart sized jar.  Really yummy!

I made this recipe as is and loved it.  It's got the perfect soy, sweet, gingery taste that I was looking for.  I use it frequently on Asian salads with things like mandarin oranges, edamame, etc.  I read that someone swapped the olive oil for sesame so next time I will try that but as is, I think the recipe is great.

I really liked this.  I decreased the olive olive oil slightly and made up the difference with sesame oil, also decreased the soy some.  Next time I think I'll add some onions before I blend.

Way too much soy sauce, too watery & too oily! I had to add more vinegar & honey to tone it down then ended up skimming some of the oil off. Even after that it was still too strong for salad, so I ended up using it as a dressing for soba noodles. It could be good with some changes.

Please stop rating recipes based upon the modifications made.  This was TERRIBLE when made as the recipe dictates.  Usually, I read reviews before proceeding but I was in a hurry.  As the reviews say, it has way too much soy sauce, doesn't need water (makes it runny), and needs more vinegar.  I ended up pouring it on chicken as a marinade because it was unusable as a salad dressing.  It made a great marinade though.

This dressing is so delicious!! I love ginger dressing but can never find one in the store that tastes as good as what you might get in a restaurant. I have made it a couple times, and although it tastes great as written, the changes below are the result of some experimentation to get what I think is the best flavor. 

Like other reviewers, I substituted sesame oil for olive oil to give it a more authentic flavor. I also added ~1 tablespoon of brown sugar. I think it is safe to say that you can eliminate the water altogether; the recipe does not really need it. If you really like ginger, you can add 1-3 more tablespoons based on taste preference, but be careful because a little ginger goes a long way. 

Lastly, the one thing I would say (which is certainly optional, less authentic, and based on taste preference) is that for those of you who prefer creamy dressing, adding a very small amount of mayo or miracle whip can really customize this dressing to your palate. It makes it more creamy/less purely oily, which a lot of people like. Add sparingly and in iterations, as you don't want the mayo flavor to be overwhelming.

The finished product is great over thinly sliced carrots, broccoli, red & white cabbage (+ any other crunchy vegetables). Toss and finish with some sesame seeds and you have a unique take on cole slaw that will be well-received at any gathering!

I was looking for a recipe to substitute for a store-bought dressing that my husband really likes. Since he's on a diet, I wanted to get the calories as low as possible... so I substituted Splenda for the honey, added 1/8 cup balsamic and extra ginger.

I also did half and half olive oil and sesame oil, used Gourmet Garden ginger blend instead of fresh, sushi vinegar instead of rice wine vinegar and added 2 teaspoons of red pepper flakes.

Only because the numerous adjustments I made did I rate it 4. It's REALLY good. I used 2 Tbsp lemon juice, a bit less honey (approx 2 Tbsp), 1/3 cup soy sauce, an extra shake or two of vinegar, and added some black pepper. Not sure I can see a full cup of soy sauce in this recipe....I think next time for me, even less honey. I like it a little less sweet. The beauty is that you can tweak it as desired :) As close as I get to perfect to get my hubby to eat salad! :)

Pretty awesome and simple. I didn't have rice vinegar so I substituted lemon juice (amount specified for rice vinegar) and a drizzle of cranberry juice; it was great. Will make again

So delicious! I put it on a shredded spinach/cabbage/carrot salad with mandarine oranges and almonds - my family and guests LOVED it. I did substitute canola oil and a tablespoon or so of sesame oil for the olive oil. My advice to those who think the vinegar taste is too strong- mix all ingredients EXCEPT vinegar together- then add vinegar a little bit at a time and taste as you go. I didn't end up using the full 1/3 cup. Thanks for the great recipe!

I found this dressing to be quite bitter and needed to add lots of honey at the end. I suspect it's due to the olive oil, which is out of place - I would use canola or peanut oil next time, as my olive oil has a wonderful, strong olive flavor that simply does not work with the other flavors. That may eliminate the need for so much honey next time. I used my Magic Bullet and pureed the whole batch rather than dicing the garlic and ginger, and it came out pretty and creamy.

Delicious!  I used this as a marinade for chicken breasts that I grilled, and basted the chicken with the marinade as it cooked.  I didn't have the vinegar, so I tried just 1/4 teaspoon of Hoisin sauce (careful with that, it is very 'rich') and added the zest of one orange.  Everyone loved it!

Excellent -- a big hit with hubby, and a huge improvement over the bottled ginger sesame dressings.  I followed Houstongal31's suggestion, substituting the olive oil with half sesame oil and half safflower/canola, and omitted the water.  It smells and tastes authentic.  I also added a few shakes of dried red pepper flakes. Some reviews mention cutting back on the soy sauce, but I used the full amount of soy sauce, and it tasted good to me. I served it over steamed green beans, with a few thin slices of carrot for color.  I let the beans and carrots chill in a small amount of dressing, then sprinkled on a little more dressing before serving. This is also good with spring mix and with sprouts of any kind.

Really tasty! My husband and I love this stuff! I left the garlic and ginger whole and stuck everything in my chopper! I warmed up the honey in the microwave added it to the chopper and it was done! Followed other suggestions and used 1/4 cup sesame oil/ 1/2 cup olive oil and cut soy sauce in half. Perfect!

This stuff is very good - it makes a lot so I will have it to eat with salads all week at least.  I did add just a hint of sesame oil - I'm thinking some toasted sesame seeds would be good in this.  I'm sure this will taste even better after it sits for a few hours.  Thanks for the recipe Dieter-Weber!

This salad dressing turned out fabulously!  I took other reviewer's suggestions and cut the amount of soy sauce in half.  I also used 1/4 cup sesame oil and the rest canola oil.  Rather than using honey, I used a tbsp of splenda.  And I didn't have fresh ginger, so I used ground ginger powder and eyed the amount.  I also added some red pepper flakes, although I'm not sure this made a lot of difference.  My husband raved about it!

The dressing is not what I was expecting. It tastes OK. It reminds of the old-fashion Chinese steam seafood sauce. The texture is too thin that it doesn't sit on the veggies. The sour and saltiness don't blend well with the natural sweetness of the veggies.

This is a good recipe, but for a salad dressing, it doesn't have enough vinegar for me. I like my salad dressing with kick. I made this with 1/4 cup sesame oil and cut the soy sauce in half. In fact, I substituted Bragg's Liquid Aminos, which has only 110 mg sodium per tablespoon. Bragg's tastes like soy sauce but is high in protein and low in sodium. I've substituted it for years. The dressing has less body than I like, too--it's kind of watery. But tastes OK. Like I said, I'd double the vinegar next time.

Bon apetit!

WOW!  This was incredible, not only for salad but this would be wonderful as a marinade for fish or chicken or pork chops!  I did cut back on the ginger a tad and sub'd 1/4 cup of the olive oil with sesame seed oil.  I think next time I'll add some crushed roasted sesame seeds too.  Thanks Bunches for the recipe!  It was really great!

Very good dressing! I added a little sugar, as I felt it wasn't sweet enough.  It was a lot of work though, and you would get the same effect with a bottled Asian Sesame dressing bought from the store!

Made with less soy as others suggested (I liked it with half, but will try with all next time ...I like soy sauce)  ...used blender.....kept fine in fridge (looked a little different once chilled)...but taste was fine. Taste of JAPAN for sure.  And there was a comment about too much sweetness ....no way, it was a perfect blend...and each has their own taste buds...so try as written, then make as you desire.

This is just marvellous!  Not the orange thick kind of dressing I was expecting (Like at my local Japanese restaurant) but it is very delish in its own right.  

I think there are very few people that would not enjoy this dressing.  Its worth checking out, go ahead and make some already!  You'll enjoy it.

This is an simple and delicious recipe.... you really did a good job of making a traditional asian dressing.  I think I think I know what you were going for.  The dressing tastes like a very flavorful chinese chicken salad dressing, awesome in fact, but far from anything that is used for a traditional iceberg lettuce dressing.  It was exactly what you wanted it to be, great!!!

Though this  doesn't taste exactly like the dressing in Japanese restaurants, it was still very good.  I used about 2/3 of the soy recommended, and overall      I like it a lot.

No changes, followed the recipe perfectly, although I was tempered to omit the 1/4 cup of water. In hindsight that may have helped! We did not care at all for the flavour and it was very (too much) liquified .. like running water. It could not sit on the salad greens and vegetables, but sank to the bottom of the bowl. YUK! Will not make again, very disappointing :(

I used sesame oil instead of olive oil and thickened it up on the stove a little. This is dangerous, I could probably eat the whole bowl by itself.

This recipe is amazing!  I chaged it a little bit.  I  made it sugar free by adding artificial sweetner and added 1/4 C sesame oil and 2/4 C olive oil.  This is the best dressing ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I did 1/4 cup of sesame oil and 2/4 of olive oil. 
To me it was the perfect combo. My family loved it.

My husband and I loved this dressing.  I took other reviewer's suggestions and decreased the soy sauce (low sodium) by half, replaced the evoo with half sesame oil and half vegetable oil, and used rice vinegar.   It tastes just like the dressing they serve in Asian restaurants.  I'm so happy to have this recipe and I will be making this often.

This is a wonderful recipe!! I made a few changes based on other reviews. Firstly, I reduced the amount of honey to one tablespoon and substitutes the remaining two tablespoonfuls with sweet chili sauce. Secondly, I substituted one third of the olive oil with sesame oil. Thirdly, as I replaced the sesame oil, I omitted one half of the soy sauce. Finally I used regular vinegar as I had no rice vinegar.

I made this twice: once with EVOO and the next with sesame oil. I just didn't like it at all, either time, and threw it out. I give up on this recipe. I do love the dressing that comes with an Asian salad kit, so maybe my expectations were bad.

Not as flavorful as I hoped. Maybe it was the soy oil brand. I don't know. And I can't tell what is missing. 
I did add hot red pepper flakes.

I would use half of the soy sauce, and sesame oil rather than olive oil and add double the ginger. if I make this again. It’s almost a weak teriyaki sauce in flavor.

I wanted it to be like the store bought. I added 2 T of ground flax seed, as the texture of home made wasn’t as good. That did the trick. I also have used pickled ginger instead of fresh sometimes and that works well too. I’ve made this a bunch of different ways, just using this basic recipe to keep the proportions right. I would suggest a more neutral oil like canola, olive oil has a string taste that interferes with the sesame oil.

Half the soy as suggested by others.  I forgot to put in the vinegar.  It tasted fine anyway. Will try it with rice vinegar next time.

Delicious as is. I didn't find the soy sauce to be too much but I use Tamari soy sauce which isn't as salty & has a deeper flavor.  Nest time I will cut back the olive oil & add 2 Tbs sesame oil and a few chili flakes for some heat.

I was in a panic for an Asian dressing to extend what I had when my husband invited two extra people to dinner.  I used fresh ginger root that I had grown (the best ever).  I used about 1 tablespoon of sesame oil and the rest olive oil.  I used 1/2 the amount of soy sauce.  All the other ingredients as called for.   It really is delicious.

Used 1/4 cup of soy sauce (low sodium) and it was a bit too salty, too soy for me. Not quite sure how to fix this, but it was very tasty. Thanks for a recipe I will make again.

It turned out great with only a few changes, I substituted Braggs Liquid Aminos instead of Soy sauce, and used 1/3 cup of rice vinegar, and avocado oil instead of olive oil.  The dressing was drizzled over spinach/arugula salad with rice and a piece of salmon on top, with thinly sliced red pepper garnish, and avocado.  Delicious!

Pretty good, but not quite what I was hoping for. I tried it a second time and reduced the soy sauce, eliminated the water, increased the amount of garlic and ginger and added some sesame oil in instead. It was pretty good then.

Followed others suggestions and halved the Soy, and sesame instead of olive oil. I also cut the garlic to 1 clove.  Two things I did add was a teaspoon of peanut butter! Helped immersify  it and added a little bit of depth! and a little lime juice. YUM!

I’d give a 3.5 if I could. I was surprised there wasn’t any sesame oil in this recipe. I subbed some of the olive oil for sesame and replaced honey for brown sugar. Was very nice.

Be careful following others "enhancements" -- a little sesame oil goes a long way... With that said, I added a smidge because I like sesame oil. I also added about a teaspoon of sugar  thinking it wasn't sweet enough. Here's the deal... I didn't care for this dressing as soon as I made it. After resting in the fridge and marrying flavors, it improved. And now the next day... WOW WOW WOW this is good! If you haven't made this before, I suggest you go with the original recipe as published and give it a day in your fridge for the flavors to blend. Then see if it needs any whatever. After that, if you don't like your concoction, please don't come back here and give your own recipe a bad rating, because the original is good.

This recipe came out tasting very bitter and salty to me. I'll put in a lot less soy sauce next time and try again.

My family loves this dressing on cabbage salad, as a marinade for chicken, and on rice. Yum!

We used garlic scrapes since they were on hand. Puréed in the food processor with the ginger, they made the dressing thick and flavorful.

I love this dressing.  I have made it as is and with multiple variations and it is always good. I generally don't add the water; it doesn't seem to need to be thinned out in flavor or consistency.

This was delicious! I only gave it a four because I did make a couple changes. I followed others advice and did half olive and half sesame oil. I added crushed red pepper flakes for some kick. Then I only used half the ginger, because I'm not a huge fan of it and didn't add the water. I will definitely make it again.

I used sesame oil instead and added ½ teaspoon of Crushed Red Pepper. I used the dressing in a Mason Jar Salad (layered green cabbage, green onions, diced red pepper, red cabbage, rice, and carrots). I shook the mason jar a few time over the next 24 hours before I served it.

Just OK. Ratios are off for a proper emulsion so it's very watery. Flavorwise is just OK. If I would make it again it would need something to give it a little more dimension and depth.

I made this for an ahi tuna salad almost like a french salade nicoise and it turned out great (using only 1/2 of the soy sauce called for in the recipe). Thanks for sharing the recipe.

This had decent flavor but was too watery. I don't understand why there is water in the recipe. Next time I'll omit the water and use less soy sauce.

I only made a half batch.   I used 1/4 cup evoo and 2 tbsp sesame seed  oil rather than all olive oil. I replaced the honey with 1 tsp. of brown sugar and cut the soy sauce by half. It's really good and I don't think it needs any water.

Like everyone else ...I halved the soy sauce and it was perfect. I've made this a few times and to me it tastes just like the restaurant stuff. Once I used dry ground ginger b/c that's all i had. Still great. Just use 1/4 t for each T. Cheers!

Used this dressing for a salad that had Asian inspired elements.  This dressing was perfect!  I stayed pretty true to the recipe, although I ran out of soy sauce, so I guess that was an adjustment, but it was excellent.  This recipe is a keeper!

Loved this recipe!  Was looking for am Asian dressing with no sesame oil since some of our family is allergic to sesame oil.  Was skeptical about this one because it seemed so simple but we love it!!! Followed the recipe exactly and it was perfect! Refrigerated the leftovers and used it for a while. Great on a cabbage based salad.  Also used a slightly modified version as a marinade for chicken and had amazing results!!!  Will definitely be making this again!!!

I, too, used a combination of olive and sesame oils. I didn't have soy sauce in the house (I don't know how THAT happened!) so I used ketjap manis (sweetened soy sauce) in its place.  Will make again and again, and again...

Great taste and all, but mine doesn't refrigerate well. It turns a semi solid and separates and needs to be almost thawed a bit before being shaken and poured. Not sure what's going on or what I did wrong. Still tastes good though.

It was ok. It was a bit more liquid than I would prefer and the amount of rice vinegar suggested is a bit much; I'd likely reduce the total amount of everything used, specifically the vinegar and the soy sauce. Additionally, I'd mix more sesame oil than olive oil and add grated asian pear. Lastly, I'd substitute brown sugar for the honey so that heating is not necessary. All that said, I loved it and my husband preferred the store bought taste. To sum, I feel a bit guilty grading a recipe I doctored, so take my review with a grain of salt.

Used coconut aminos in place of soy sauce and a few extra garlic cloves.  Also used about 2 inches of ginger and coconut sugar in place of honey.  I blended it in my vitamix.  Very good dressing and I will definitely make over and over.

Used this a while ago and forgot to rate it.  We also used sesame oil (toasted) instead of the olive oil.  We look for a more traditional asian taste.  It turned out great, we loved this dressing.  Hence why I searched it out again. Printing it as I type this review.
*** I have noticed a lot of folks that said it was bad or one starred this recipe.... made significant changes.  I am astounded that they are blaming the recipe for their omission or addition of ingredients.  Mind Boggled

I made this for a greens and chicken salad....lettuce, shredded carrots, scallions, tomato, cucumber and poached chicken. Turned out great!  Based on other reviews I used low sodium soy sauce, the full amount called for. I added lime juice, fresh cilantro, and fresh scallion.  I also used some dark toasted sesame oil, a few Tablespoons, and avocado oil instead of the olive oil. Put everything in the Vitamix and blended it up. Delicious!  I think it would be awesome with some chili sauce or chili oil if you want some heat. Definitely easy to customize to suit your own tastes. My husband absolutely loved this dressing!  And it makes enough for a few two person salads.

We love this. Only change  was to add some chili paste for spice - we like hot -  This is absolutely perfect as written, however, and I can see it being used as a marinade, a dressing, and even a dip for veggies and meat.  Thanks so much for such an easy, tasty recipe.  It will be used often in our home.

Excellent. Omitted the water by mistake and agree with other reviewers--doesn't need it. Also 2 parts olive oil; 1 part sesame oil. Great on one of this sites recipes with iceberg lettuce, shredded bokchoy, toasted sunflower seeds/pine nuts and cooked Asian noodles with a few snap peas. I can see using this in many salad types.

I cut the soy sauce in half and added a few tablespoons sesame oil which was really great. Next time I will cut the garlic back to 2 cloves as I thought it was a bit over powering.

As you can see in the photo, the oil just sits on top of the soy divided by the garlic. Not a good oily feel. It reminds me of the black and tan beverage: Guinness and Cider. Same look as I shook it, whisked it, after making and upon serving. Maybe leave out the oil, as I made another Asian Chili dressing without it with satisfactory taste and feel results.

I don't understand the addition of water. It just makes it runny and bland. I had to add a lot more honey to make it back it a thicker consistency. I also followed the edits of some of the reviews calling for cutting the soy sauce to 1/4 cup and using 1/2 cup olive oil and 1/4 cup sesame oil.

So I just made this recipe (tweaked it a bit) because my son is crazy about the Asian salad at Panera. Instead of 3 whole garlic cloves, I used the equivalent in already minced organic garlic. I also put a little less than 1/2 cup of low sodium soy sauce. A little less than  3/4 cup of olive oil and a little less than 3 tablespoons of honey. Lastly, my carafe wasn't big enough to add the full amount of water so I used a little less of that too. It tastes amazing, my only concern is that the ginger and garlic settle quickly after shaking it. The true test will be when my 9yr old gets off the bus and sits down for dinner later!

This is the greatest Asian-ginger dressing ever. I substituted the olive oil with sesame oil for a more robust flavor.  I use this dressing for my Asian Broccoli Slaw recipe.  Should have 10 stars.

I'm going to give this 4 stars because I think I would have liked it, if I hadn't messed it up.  While reaching for some balsamic vinegar to add to this dressing, I accidentally grabbed the Worcestershire sauce instead!  Definitely not the same!  We used the dressing on our salad anyway and saved the rest for a marinade.  I loved the ginger flavor and I suspect would have liked the salad much more if I had made it according to the directions.

I made a few modifications. Ginger and garlic was fine. I added 1/2 cup coconut aminos. ( instead of soy sauce... Paleo and gluten free.... And not nearly as salty as soy sauce). I used 1/2 cup good sesame see oil , no water, and 3 tbsp honey, although next time I may use maple syrup.  Added good grind of fresh pepper also.  Put everything into food processor except the oil. Added it slowly till well blended. Thin but creamy consistency. Could also use hand blender

Keeper!  Followed other reviewers on the soy and sesame oil and added some toasted sesame seeds.  Will follow advice on freezing ginger next time.

Update - using lower sodium soy, I have done this as written with one enhancement, I placed the ingredients in a blender. This allows you to "blend" the garlic and ginger into the dressing reducing the effort to mince them. Still chop them, but the blender makes for a smoother dressing.

The hint to freeze the ginger also works well, but the blender helps more.

I made this with sesame oil rather than olive.  It was tasty.  I'd go lighter on the honey, heavier on the vinegar and add some heat.  That's just for my preference.  Thank you for a great recipe!  Love it.  I had this on a salad with mixed greens and roasted veggies with roasted garbanzos.

This is AWESOME!  I make this and leave it in the fridge and use it on everything!  It is really good on fresh sliced avocados.  I use it to marinade chicken, or ahi tuna before searing the tuna.  I also add 1 teaspoon of sesame oil because I like the flavor the sesame oil adds.

The only reason I give it a 4 is i thought it was crucial to have sesame oil in the dressing. I replaced 1/4 cup of olive oil for sesame oil. I think I also reduced the soy sauce to 1/4 cup. I didn't have honey so I replaced that with real maple syrup. I don't think it changed the taste much (the honey is there to sweeten anyway). Thumbs up!

modifications - used 1/3 clove garlic not 3, used 1/4 c soy sauce not 1/2, microplaned ginger not minced, used sesame oil not olive oil, I think the most important addition was 2 DROPS of sesame seed oil which is very flavorful

Really good. It tastes like so many of the ginger dressings in Japanese restaurants. I didn't make any changes but I may reduce honey and try sesame oil next time as suggested by others.

This is really good.  I didn't have fresh ginger so I used ginger powder.  Also, I added sesame oil in place of a 1/4 cup of olive oil.  It was great with mandarin oranges and chinese noodles (and lettuce of course).

This recipe is amazing!  We used it on organic power greens with shredded carrots and a sprinkling of bleu cheese crumbles.  The only "upgrade" I would make is to whir the dressing (I used my NutriBullet) to prevent garlic and ginger root from overwhelming the salad.  We will use this recipe again and again!

This recipe was good!  My boyfriend liked it a lot also.  I followed the recipe pretty closely.  I read the other reviews about sesame oil, but I didn't have any so I used all olive oil.  I did take others advice as far as leaving out the water and cutting the soy sauce in half.  Followed all the other ingredients exactly.  While we thought it was good like this I'm betting that the sesame oil adds a kick of flavor that would put it over the top!

In a pinch for a dressing for a salad with grilled salmon, I just tossed together olive oil, rice vinegar, soy sauce, and agave nectar and it tasted just fine!  So don't be afraid to mess with the recipe :)

I'm not usually a salad person...it's not that I don't like vegetables it's just that I get bored. To me they are like sandwiches, everyone else always makes them better than you can at home. After a recent road trip I discovered a wonderful Kale & Beet salad that I so badly wanted to duplicate. It was served with Ginger dressing and I have to say this recipe is PERFECT! Such wonderful flavor. The salad didn't come out exactly like the restaurant, but thanks to this dressing it was still amazing! Can't wait to try it on other salads.

I followed the recipe with the exception of I used sesame and olive oil mix as suggested by other reviewers. We really didn't enjoy this dressing. It is very thin like water and left us feeling it was flavorful but missing something.  Keep in mind this makes a lot of dressing, especially if you don't end up liking the flavor.

Pretty good, but not the creamy stuff from the Japanese place that I was looking for. This tastes exactly like what I make for Oriental Chicken Salad.

I liked this dressing.  Pretty close to what our favorite Japanese sushi joint offers, though not the same.  I used a fairly thick rice wine vinegar from a local Oriental Market, not sure if that's why, but I thought it was a little too overpowering.  Next time I'll cut back and maybe add a touch more water, the flavor of the ginger really came through though which was great.  I served the salad the way our favorite restaurant does, just iceberg lettuce with crispy wonton strips (available at the grocery store) and served with chopsticks!

This recipe is amazing! I also added sesame oil instead of Olive Oil based on other reviews and cut the soy sauce in half. The soy sauce was still a bit overpowering for my family, so next time I think I with cut it in 1/4ths.  I didn't have rice vinegar so I used white and although it still tasted great, next time I will use the rice vinegar!  5 stars!!!

The perfect compliment to an asian-style salad.  I made it by using half the amount of soy sauce as some reviewers suggested and no water.  I thought it was bland.  I then added in the remaining soy and water, like the recipe suggested, and it was perfect.  I used gluten-free Tamari.  Hubby and kids loved it, too.

Delicious dressing.  One of the best asian salad dressings I have ever made.  My husband loved it, too. It paired nicely with a seared tuna steak I made for dinner.  My only change (and I see others did the same): sesame oil instead of olive oil.

I made this dressing with out reading the reviews (which I never do) & the way it came out wasn't very great. I am sure that if I made with the other reviewers adjustments it would taste much better. To me it just tastes like soy sauce. :(

FABULOUS!!!  This dressing was wonderful!  I used it on a salad of baby lettuce from hubby's garden with green onion, pineapple tidbits, and toasted coconut.  Delicious!  We even drizzled some over our grilled pork tenderloin which was really yummy as well.  I did make some changes based on other reviewers suggestions, using half olive oil and half sesame oil and cutting the soy sauce in half.  This is going in my TNT cookbook!  Thank  you!

I just made this dressing and its fantastic!! I'm in Central America, so my soy sauce is a little different and not as strong flavored as the soy sauce in the States, so I used the whole 1/2 cup and it was prefect. Also I did not have olive oil or rice vinegar so I used vegetable oil and red vinegar. I to forgot to add the water (which I think may be necessary if I used the "full flavor" soy sauce) and it still turned out great!!! Thanks for the recipe!

Just made this dressing this morning before work. Very simple, and threw it all in a blender.  I took the advice of another rater (I think healthycook) and substituted the soy sauce for Bragg's liquid amino acids and used agave instead of honey. Additionally, I used organic powdered ginger as the grocery store did not have 1 single piece of ginger in it! Very odd! Anyway, it was delcious! Also, I used 1 pretty big garlic clove. I wish I had cut it in half as the garlic is still lingering even though I have been done with my salad for an hour now! I would also use less liquid aminos. It's salty just like soy sauce. I'm more of a spice person vs. salt; plus I have high blood pressure. Will make this again and maybe make it spicy hot!

Delicious asian dressing!  I cut the olive oil and replace a 1/4 cup with seasme oil.  I squezzed a half of a lime in.  Skipped honey and water, and subtituted with 2 tablespoons of sugar.  I used my food processor.  Delicious!

I made this into an asian pasta salad using brown rice noodles and chopped veggies. I did follow the advice and cut the soy (thanks) The one thing I did to make it extra special was I added a good squirt of sriacha hot sauce to the recipe. Now when I take this to potlucks I print the recipe beforehand because everyone always wants it!!

Followed the suggestions and we loved it! Less soy sauce, no water, and used rice vinegar instead of regular. Finally have a salad dressing to serve with our Asian dishes!

I did not follow it to the T. The vinager threw it off so much I tried to fix it by adding more honey, ginger, soy and honey dijoun dressing. I ended up adding to much ginger because it tasted good at first but then it had an after taste. I will use this as a marinade.

This turned out just okay for me. My husband liked it but I didn't. I followed other reviewers advice and cut back on the soy sauce, omitted the water and used some peanut oil. Maybe I should have stuck to the original recipe because at first it turned out horrible. I ended up using alot of extra honey to doctor it up.

The restaurant dressing I was trying to replicate was packed full of ginger, but when I finished making this dressing as written (except with only 2 tablespoons of honey, as suggested), it was basically just liquid.  Luckily I had a 9oz jar of ginger paste in my pantry.  I added the ginger paste one or two spoon fulls at a time, tasting in between each addition.  It kept getting better until I'd ultimately added the entire jar and had ended up with a very tasty dressing.  Oh yeah, I also used seasame oil instead of olive oil, but didn't have rice vinegar, so I used regular white vinegar.

I did not like this as a salad dressing but it's not bad as a marinade for chicken or steak.  I think it calls for too much soy sauce but if you cut that in half and add a little extra honey, it's fine.  Thanks for sharing.

Per other reviews, I cut back on the soy by 1/2, glad I did. I used this dressing for a quinoa, edamame salad that had pickled ginger in the recipe, so I did not add the ginger. I ended up adding more honey.

After just finishing having this for the first time, I can tell I'll be making it a lot and using it in salads and as a marinade. I skimped a little on the honey and used tamari instead of regular soy sauce, because it was all I had. I also subbed about a teaspoon of sesame oil (all I had) for some of the olive oil. Next time I'll use more sesame oil. This was delicious on my spinach salad with veggies and pepper-crusted tuna steak bites.

This was pretty good. I did have to tweak it a bit after reading other reviews. I added 1/2 EVOO and 1/2 canola oil and 1 TBS. pure dark sesame oil. I cut the honey to 1-1/2 TBS. and I used reduced sodium soy sauce and only 2 TBS. of water. It makes alot of dressing. Next time I think I will half the recipe.I used it sparingly on an Asian Salad I make.It was tangy and flavorful. Sorry I had to tweak this I hate changing recipes, but this was an great starter. Its all about cooking with your own flair.

Great recipe... I made some of the suggested changes, cut out the honey because I prefer salty to sweet. Also, I added a 2 tablespoons of minced onion. Yum!

My husband loved this; I just liked it.  We served it over a spinach salad with hearts of palm, kalamata olives, feta cheese, carrots, grape tomatoes, avocado and cashews.  Sounds like a weird combo but it was pretty good.  Next time I'll add a sprinkle of fresh cilantro.  Topped it with grilled chicken.

I wanted a dressing that could be used on an Asian salad with mandarin oranges.  This dressing was too strong and overpowered everything.

This recipe was so good over salad that we used it as a chicken marinade, and then as a sauce over noodles, chicken and veggies.  We did leave out the water as someone had suggested, and liked it a bit thicker...but even without the water it was still thin and enjoyable.  Since we did not have any ginger root we substituted 1/2 tbsp of ground ginger and it came out wonderfully!  Highly recommend!

My fiance and i thought it was delicious. Only thing is the garlic stays with you for awhile, so i only used 1 clove of garlic the second time i made it. I also followed the suggestion for 1/4 cup of soy sauce.

Great basic recipe. Like others I tweaked it a bit by reducing the soy sauce to 1/4 cup, adding the juice of 1/2 of a fresh lemon, some diced spring onions and with 1/4 cup of sesame oil I slowly added to taste since it can become over powering. If you like it a bit sweeter try adding a 1/2 tsp of sugar or some extra honey. My kids loved it.

To me, it doesn't taste much like restaurant versions, but it's still good. As written it's a bit sweet. I like it with about 1/2 the soy sauce, 1/2 the honey, and twice the ginger.

Just whipped up this dressing for a quick salad and wow this was great.  I've had the one at Japanese restaurants and even tried another recipe for it, but this tastes sooo much better.  Can't wait to try it out with a full Japapnese style dinner. I did add a teaspoon of mayo in place of some of the oil to cream it up a little easier.

This is my boyfriend's favorite dressing – he asks for it regularly!  I make just a few changes:  use 1/2 c olive oil and 1/4 c sesame oil, leave out the water and blend in the food processor.  Definately restaurant quality!

This is a delicious dressing. It reminds me of another Asian dressing I make that uses miso. It's excellent on a mixed-greens salad with watercress, red pepper, mushroom, and bean sprouts. The only change I made is I used about half the amount of water, and I made it in the blender and drizzled in the oil to emulsify it.

Great basic recipe.  I used Canola oil instead of Olive oil.  I also cut the soy sauce as recommended from others.  I added a couple of tablespoons of seasame seeds because I love them.

Delish! I wasn't a fan of the sauce alone until I added it to the cabbage salad but it turned out amazing! I did cut the soy sauce in half and used a food processor to make it creamy. Perfect texture then!
