My family absolutely loves this dish!  I don't use the listed amount of salami. I use ground turkey and/or Italian sausage along with a much smaller amount of salami or pepperoni; whatever is on hand or on sale. This is an easy recipe that provides tasty results. Many recipes on this site must be tweaked to your own family's taste.  This is definately a fave!

This is a delicious dish, but salami is expensive! I spent over $10 on the meat in this casserole. Next time I will halve the recipe. And a little does go a long way!

This is a good recipe for when you're pushed for time and/or are running low on groceries. I admit I simply combined the pasta, sauce, Italian seasoning and salami (plus a little garlic powder) in the baking dish before topping with the cheeses. Baked it as instructed, and it was done in about 15 minutes. Nothing fancy but tasty and filling. Thanks!

This recipe is very good my boyfriend can be very picky sometime but he really liked it.  I added bacon bitz to it and i was wonderful! I only used a little over 1 pound of summer sausage, and it was more than enough!! My boyfriend says the sausage over powers it. A++++

This is a great base recipe to use up leftover veggies! I only had a few slices of salami & added ground turkey, green pepper, onion, & a little frozen spinach. It turned out great!

I love salami so I thought I would try this recipe. First off if you make this recipe make sure you get a pasta sauce you like. I tried Classico pasta sauce and I hated it. This is a really heavy and fattening casserole. I just wasn't impressed and won't make this again.

This was really good. We used summer sausage because bulk salami is very expensive. I did grate about 10 oz. of the summer sausage with a cheese grater instead of chunking it, (personal preference). I used only one jar of sauce, for fear it would have been too soupy.  I don't think you get 16 servings out of it but it is a very quick and easy meal. 
I would have given five stars for flavor but when you add everything up, it was still a little expensive.

Pretty good.  I halved this and still got a full 9x13 pan, so this makes a ton.  I had large salami slices which I just cut up smaller so it would be throughout the dish.  I also tossed in a whole cut up zucchini to add veggies to this.  I cooked th zucchini with olive oil and garlic, then added in the salami to get out some of the grease, then went from there.   It is relatively heavy, so it's good to serve with salad and bread.  Good thing we enjoyed this since it makes so much!  Thanks for the recipe!

There is an error in the recipe but I can't edit now that it has been published.  The amount of salami should be (2) ¼lb chunks salami (total ½ lb).

As the recipe says, it's very heavy, so smaller portions will go a long way.  Also, too much salami for my liking; tends to overpower the dish.  About 1/2 as much salami would probably be about right.
