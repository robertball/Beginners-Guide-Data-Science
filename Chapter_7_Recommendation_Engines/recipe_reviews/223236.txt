very tasty salad.  I serverd it to my women's book club.  They "licked" the bowel clean.
I did make a few changes, I used thinly sliced red peppers and cherry tomatoes, in place of green peppers and celery, also a layer of baby spinach in addition to boston lettuce.  In the mayo I used a premixed spice combination of dried tomatoes, onions,garlic,basil, parsley,salt black pepper.  Also for presentation I layered it in a large truffel bowl.

I prepared this salad as written and loved it. I served it shortly after preparation and it was very good. It was also delicious the second and third day. The dressing doesn't ample as it is  spread over the veggies, but is enough. The salad ingredients stay crisp and crunchy.
