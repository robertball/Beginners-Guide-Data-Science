This was a nice option for using up avocados and eggs. Yum. My only modification was using dijon mustard. You can avoidthe dicoloration when storing if you put ONE avocado pit in the container with the salad before sealing tightly (just like storing guac).

I added Texas 1015's instead of the red onions. We loved it. When storing for left overs place plastic wrap driectly on top and press down lightly. This will help with the discoloration of the salad.

I got the lap band a few months ago and had to be on 2 weeks of liquids and 2 weeks of mushy foods after the surgery. It got old, so I went looking for something new I could do with eggs and avocado. When I saw this recipe I was dubious. Having tasted all these ingredients separately, I just didn't see them tasting good together lol. Boy was I wrong. OMG this is so yummy! Even now that I'm not on mushies anymore, I still make this for lunch weekly. I always try to figure out what makes all these things taste good together, I think it's the sweet pickles. I use a pre-made sweet pickle relish cause I'm lazy lol, it really just ties everything together. So don't doubt it, try it! Yum!

I used to get something similar to this at a deli but it was called the Yankee Doodle and served on soft sub roll. Only the sliced avacodo was sliced along with strips of fried bacon. Yumm.. one of my favs!

This was surprisingly delicious.  The color was weird and only got weirder as leftovers, but if you can get past that and give it a taste, you'll forgive the appearance immediately.  I did not have a fresh red onion, so used dried chopped onions instead.  The sweet pickles really made the dish, I think.

If you love avocados and you love eggs, and you haven't tried the two combined, you are really missing out. I only recently discovered how well the two go together, like they were meant to be. I used pickled jalape√±os instead of sweet relish and a squirt of fresh lime juice, which aids in preserving. I wrapped it up in a flour tortilla sandwich wrap, much neater to eat that way. Nice brunch.

My daughter had friends over for a sleepover. They wanted egg salad for lunch. I mad this and the typical egg salad. This one was gone before the typical.

Really easy to make and tasted great.  For me it is new way to enjoy avocado and the avocado texture really compliments the mash eggs.  I forgot to put salt and pepper in mine and still it was delicious.  I served it in a lettuce wrap instead of with bread.  I also used Branston Pickle Relish (English) instead of regular pickle relish.

Wonderful! Not being a huge egg salad fan I wanted something different that had very little mayo. I tried this recipe using only enough mayo to make is spreadable which is not very much because the avocado helps it bond together. I also left out the onion and pickles. I would never have thought of combining avocado and egg salad but this recipe is wonderful. I have made it several times including when having lucnh guests and I will continue to make this as I really love it!

I really like this version of egg salad, although I only had one avocado on hand and didn't have any red onion.  It was nice a creamy, but definitely missing something. I'd definitely like to try to make this again with all of the ingredients called for.

This was really good! I had one hard boiled egg left and was looking for a way to stretch it into a heartier lunch.  Used one egg and half of a small avocado.  I used dijon mustard and subbed a little chopped green olive for the pickles, and I added just a bit of lemon juice.  Nice change of pace!

I'm not an experienced cook, so this was pretty easy for me to make.  The only thing was after I was done it tasted like it needed something; maybe some lime juice?

What an amazing variation on boring old egg salad. My only change was to use Miracle Whip instead of mayonnaise - just a personal taste preference.

It came out pretty well. I had more avocado than egg because I love avocados. I added a little cheese and lettuce and used white onion instead of red. I think red would have made it taste more like guacamole which could be nice.

Great idea! Tastes delish. Can easily modify to your tastes, and very versatile. Have put on burgers, breakfast sandwiches, or anywhere you'd use mayo.

I have never made an egg salad with avocado before and I have to say, this is SO GOOD!! I added a little red and green pepper and celery too. I also added a little lemon juice to keep the color! I will make this again for sure!

I'd tried this earlier this summer, when we had avocados coming out our ears and loved it. So yesterday, while trying to decide what to do with my newly pickled eggs, I thought I'd give this one a whirl again.
Absolutely delicious. I'd highly recommend trying out a pickled avocado egg salad, for a change of pace. Yum!

I really liked this as is & it was truly amazing!  I wasn't too sure at first, but wow.  I did add a splash of lemon juice in hopes of keeping the discoloration at bay.  I also followed another reviewer by laying saran wrap directly on the egg salad.

This is a wonderful way to add avocado to your diet.  If you can get past the green color this is a healthy new way to eat an old favorite.  The only way I will be making egg salad from now on.  I left out the mayonnaise, mustard, and pickles since I did not have any on hand.  
Mayonnaise is not needed since the avocado adds a lot of creaminess and binds everything together.  You can alter this recipe any way you like.  I added a squeeze of lemon, a squeeze of spicy ketchup, diced onions and bell peppers.

This made for an interesting and tasty lunch today (even rocked it old school cafeteria style and ate it on soft white bread with crisp iceberg).  Used chopped dill pickles instead of the sweet pickles and squeezed lemon over the avocado prior to slicing and dicing.  Next time I might reduce or even omit the mayo as the avocado alone seemed to lend to the expected creaminess of egg salad.  Thanks, ANGELAANDJAKERS, for a new twist on an old favorite.

I'm not a big fan of raw onions, sweet pickle or avocados but this tasted nice. I think I must have put too much pickle in because mine turned out very brown...

The salad came out good. I had people over and I scaled it to more servings (with 9 eggs and 3 avocados). It tastes good, I like avocado, but you can taste eggs. You can't eat a lot of this salad, so I would not suggest to make a lot of it. Although its good to make it for variety.

Loved it!  I did not use the mustard but added sunflower seeds! YUM Also, I was all out of red onion and substituted minced onion flakes.

I was surprised how good this was. I like egg salad and I like avocados but never thought to mix them and honestly it didn't sound appealing. With high rating though I had to just try it and I am glad I did, this is a keeper. I like how you dont have to have a ton of mayo either, thank you.

This was a little bland but not so much that I wouldn't make it again. I think if I add some bacon to this this may be better. Also wasn't able to add the onion because my bf can't have them. That may have been the problem.

This was amazing! I loved it, my husband said it was "spot on" our 1 year old twins loved it also (left out the onion for them). I did not put any pickles in this simply because we did not have any. This was so great I called my mom and told her to make it.

I *never* would have thought to add avocado to egg salad, but this was wonderful!  I, too, had to use dill relish (all I had on hand), but it made it delightfully tangy.  I'm tempted to try adding it to potatoe salad as the flavors seemed as though they would work quite well together - will let you know how it goes.  Thanks for recipe!

This was ok, but not the best - I am not sure exactly how I would want to fix it though. Perhaps too much avocado to the amount of eggs.

This is pretty good sandwich spread, even minus the sweet pickles.  Might even be better without it.  Thanks for the idea.  Made my avocado go a long ways.

This was a really good egg salad sandwitch recipe.  Unfortunately didn't have any red onion on hand, but the egg salad was still very good without it (though I think it would be better with).  My boyfriend was a bit hesitant, as the salad ended up being pastel green, but after eating, preferred the avocado egg salad to regular egg salad.  Will definitely make again.

Very tasty! I didn't use all the mayo, only about 2/3 of what was called for. Eat it up quick as the avocados will start to turn dark over the next couple of days.

This is not bad.  I like the crunchiness from the pickles, and the creaminess from the avocado.  However, my preference would be for dill pickles, not sweet.  Still, a quick and easy recipe.  I generally dice eggs in egg salad but I like mashing better.  So much easier!

I love this way to incorporate avocados into a dish.  I used spicy brown mustard and sprinkled with paprika, but it wasn't needed.  If you don't mash it all up too much and leave the eggs and avocados in small cubes, it makes a great sandwich filling as well.

what a smart way to make a healthy egg salad sandwich! i omitted the mayo and it turned out tasty, but a little too much like guacamole. Next time i'm going to use half the avocado in the recipe.

My sister and I made this when we started craving late one night and were looking for something super easy to make. Bingo! Skipped on a few ingredients and just used avocados, eggs, mayonnaise, salt and pepper annnnd a teaspoon of fresh squeezed lemon juice. We were a bit skeptical but it turned out delicious! We spread it on a few slices of toasted baguette and gulped them down in no time! Leftover looked yucky but tasted yummy so it was all gone the next day. =)

Love this recipe. However, I did not have any pickles, so I had to leave those out. I'm sure it would be better with the relish. Also, I used dried onions because I didn't have any fresh ones. I don't recommend that because of the texture of the onion flakes.

I used 6 eggs but only 1 avocado as my others weren't quite ripe enough yet. Chopped B&B pickles. I left out the mayo completely because it seemed creamy enough without it, and I completely forgot to add mustard. Still very very good! I'll definitely be making this for lunches again soon.

Like stuffypuppet, I had no red onion and used Smiths 4665's instead. Also used Dijon. Egg salad is usually pretty bland but this was the best so far.

I used dill pickles & added celery but it was amazing!!! I had my neighbors try it one of my neighbors came over at lunch asking if I had any left! It tasted even better the next day by the way.

I didn't have mustard...so I used a teaspoon of horseradish and it was delicious :) Other than that I followed the recipe exactly and I will definitely use it again. Great on wraps with lettuce, cheese and pieces of bacon thrown in for good measure! Yummm

This is DELISH!  Best version of egg salad I've ever had (and I've had a lot of egg salad). I'm not a huge mayo fan, so I substituted plain greek yogurt instead. Used grey poupon mustard and chopped dill pickles instead of sweet.  Both my husband and I thought this was amazingly, addictively good -- I didn't tell him about the yogurt and he had no idea! It gave a nice tang and the whole thing was so creamy. Have made it twice in one week and will definitely make again!

Didn't have any red onion so I subbed celery. Don't buy sweet pickles, so I used dill. Always have to have a kick when I eat, so I used a bit of Chipoltle Chili Powder. I was very pleasantly surprised with how good this combo was! Thanks for the recipe!

This was a great way to reduce mayo in egg salad & give it a heightened taste. I used my own recipe but did reduce the light mayo, then added the mashed avacado which I combined with some fresh squeezed lemon juice. Used 12 eggs, 1/2 c mayo, one avacado, 2 Tbls Dijon, 3 Tbsl pickle relish & all my favorite spices plus S&P.  Yes, you must add paprika & dill to make it perfect in my opinion!  A dash of chipotle red pepper kicks it nicely. Easy & delicious.  Served on bed of romaine & croissants to 10 people for luncheon. All loved. Thanks for the avacado idea!

I really enjoyed this. I only made it for 2 so I just eyeballs the ingredients. Next time I will use more pickles, I love the crunch it adds. I served in Hawaiian rolls, was delish.

This is a fantastic recipe. It‚Äôs delicious. The only word of advice is that the avocados should be as ripe as possible to help with the mixing process.

I made the salad for a quick lunch and topped it on a green salad. It was yummy! I chopped up a dill pickle spear for the sweet pickle ingredient. I didn‚Äôt have pickled relish as some have used. I may add paprika or red pepper for some spiciness.

The only thing I did was cut the recipe in half because if we did not like it, I did not want to waste. But it was amazing!  I will be making this again!
*Also used the baking process from this site to "hard boil" the eggs.  Really impressed with those as well.

I love this recipe! Made it exactly as written with one minor exception: I used scallions rather than red onion, since scallions are the only type of onion I am not allergic to. I also always squeeze a little lemon juice on avocado when cooking with them to keep them from turning brown. Thanks for a great recipe!

This was good. I made a few adjustments - I used dill instead of pickles, Dijon mustard in place of regular, Greek yogurt instead of mayonnaise and less in quantity, added lemon juice, red wine vinegar, and paprika. I know it‚Äôs a lot of changes, but this recipe gave me a great base to start from.

My husband loooovvves this! And, well, me too!!! And everyone who's tried it from my kitchen ;)
(P.S. I prefer using dill relish, which I use in my version, and it's SO good this way... and Miracle whip is just great in this, also. Just a thought if you're trying it out!)
Super healthy...crazy it can taste like this! Enjoy! :)

I diced the egg and avocado and used sweet onion instead of red onion because that is what I had on hand. When I realized that I didn't have pickles, I used capers instead. It was delicious! I would definitely make it again.

My husband only likes very basic egg salad. So I made that and added avocado and sweet pickle relish to my sandwich. It was pretty good.

This was GREAT!  I took other people's suggestions, left out the Mayonnaise (El Esposo doesn't need the additional calories, nor do I!) and added a bit of Chili-Garlic sauce to kick it up a notch.  I mashed the egg yolks with the avocado, and then cut up the boiled egg whites to give it some texture.  Another word to the wise (I'm a southern CA gal, so avocados are a staple), yes, DO put a layer of plastic wrap right over the mix, within the container, then cover the container.  the lack of oxygen will keep the mix from taking on a gray-ish color.  That's simply oxidation on the outer layer, and it looks a bit ugly.  The plastic wrap stops that from happening!

So yummy! Took other suggestions and added a squirt of lime juice and Roma tomatoes. Substitute Dijon for regular mustard and sweet pickle relish vs. actual pickles. Tried it on tortillas which was good, but I think I liked triscuits better for the crunch. Next time I'll try it on toast.

I made a half recipe. I also added tomato and bacon for sandwiches  like some of the other reviews suggested! Amazing. I will use this recipe again to replace my egg salad! I also used cracked pepper and Himalayan salt and gf bread.

Can't rave about this recipe enough.  I have made it three times with eggs and it went over well.  I have also tried it with tuna and chicken as the protein and it works well with all of them.  Great protein heavy dish full of green goodness.  I did make one change, but it was minor, instead of yellow mustard, I used Dijon and it really gives a bit more bite to the dish.  Great recipe.

Avocados + eggs = awesomeness! I had to substitue red onion for green onion since that's all I had. I replaced the relish (not a fan) with regular pickles chopped, & lastly added paprika. This was so yummy! I loved it & so did my girlfriend. This will definitely be a staple in our house!

I made a half-batch just to try it as-written. It was really creamy, but perhaps a bit too sweet for my liking. Next time,  I will add less pickles but overall it was a good recipe. I will make it again, just not right away.

My daughter is a vegetarian and we tried this recipe because I wanted to add extra vitamins to an egg salad sandwich.  I added a bit of lime juice so the Avacado would stay green, not for flavor.  Thanks for the recipe!

I saw this and threw some eggs in my pressure cooker and whipped this together. It was delicious. I did add some jalape√±os because we like spicy. Total is July 4th and I am making it again for our BBQ.

I didn't add the mayo (didn't need it with 2 avocados), used Dijon and used a diced yellow onion instead of red (I had a yellow one already). Will be making this again and again (great paleo lunch!)

I was intrigued by the avocado, and I wasn't disappointed! I did add/replace a couple of things according to my taste. Chopped cucumber instead of pickle relish (fresher tasting), and spicy brown instead of regular mustard. Lined my sandwich with spinach, lopped on a bunch of this, and probably could have finished 2 sandwiches! Thanks for this!

Amazing!  And I don't usually like or eat egg salad.  I didn't have any red onion in the house so I used a regular yellow onion, and it was still delicious.

I made this as per instructions and it really was delicious, served on slices of sourdough bread as open-faced sandwiches. However I found that a sprinkle of freshly grated mature cheddar on each sandwich added a  tangy kick. Like previous reviewer  Dana I also half submerge an avocado pit into any leftover mixture before sealing in an airtight container, to prevent the avocado from turning brown.

Loved the idea of using healthy avocados to my basic egg salad.  Made 1/2 the recipe to try the concept.  Used 3 HB eggs, 1 ripe avocado, which made it creamy and easy to mash, no need to dice.  Used 2 Tbs finely diced white onion,  1/4 c. Miracle Whip, which has less cholesterol than mayo and sprinkled dry mustard to taste.   Omitted pickle because husband does not like them.  Certainly easy to serve on the side for  those who love pickles.  Used lightly toasted whole wheat bread, which yielded 2 thick and healthy sandwiches and no leftovers to worry about discoloring.

I will definitely make this again!  What a great taste, and it was so easy, too!  I served the salad in lettuce cups and enjoyed every bite!  Next time, I will add chopped tomatoes and bits of bacon, and maybe use tortilla chips on the side.  Thanks for a very easy dinner.

Delicious!! I left out the pickles (personal preference - I don't like them) and used about 1/4 of a small onion. So yummy!! While I love mustard in my egg salad, I might leave it out of this recipe next time and see what I think. And adding a diced, roma tomato would be a nice addition. So many ways to tweak and personalize! :)

I used less than half the mayo it called for, and it was still great. I also used some yellow onion instead of red, because that's what I had. Good way to use up leftover dyed eggs from Easter!

Green eggs are good! Even without the ham:). I had tried another recipe on this site that was similar but did not include the mayonnaise and it was very bland. The mayo makes a huge difference. Mine ended up very very creamy, perhaps my avocados were big, so I needed another egg. I was looking for an easy way to get more monounsaturated fat in my diet and egg yolks and avocados are full of it. The mayo even has some. This goes down super easy which is important to me because I am looking for a way to keep weight on and it's been hard (due to nausea caused by medication). I added a small amount of very finely minced celery and used a shallot instead red onion. I also squeezed some lime in. Even with the lime and keeping the pit in with the salad, it goes brown faster than I can eat it. Thank you.

Very good! I held off on the sweet pickles, cut down on the mayo and mustard, and spiced it up with some garlic powder, seasoned salt, dill weed and a touch of cumin.

This is the best! Absolutely love it! so healthy too. As other reviewers suggested, I put a pit in the left over salad to help lessen the oxidation (browning). This doesn't keep long because we go right through it. The only tweak I made was add 1 tbs sriracha sauce for a little heat.

I used 3 avocados, onion powder, & sweet relish. I also added a dash of salt, white pepper, & turmeric. I replaced mayo with Miracle Whip.  Very creamy, should've stuck with 2 avocados. I also did not have red onion on hand. Still pretty yummy!

This was really good! A nice change from the normal egg salad. I gave 4 instead of 5 because it seems like it needed a little more seasoning of some sort. Maybe fresh cilantro next time? I used diced cucumber instead of pickles only because thats what I happened to have and Dijon mustard because I prefer its flavor. Will definitely make again!

Yummy!  I use less sweet pickles, because I don't like the flavor as much.  The avocado provides a nice creamy texture, so you don't need as much mayo.   This is an easy recipe to change to your tastes.

Great idea. I have been thinking about something else to use besides the same old same old. I mixed a variety of different vegetables together. Avocado, onions, tomatoes, portabello mushrooms, pickles, spinach and mixed it with hard boiled eggs along with mayonnaise blended with basil. Then I put it in a whole wheat tortilla wrap with cheese. This little concoction came out delicious.

This was delicious! Made some changes just based on what I had on hand. No mayo but it held together without it. Used Dijon mustard, dill pickles, and added some crushed red pepper as well as celery for a little texture. Served it in a pita. Will definitely make this again!

I made two batches for an adoption shower.  
One on wheat, following the recipe except I used swett relish instead of sweet pickles and Dijon mustard instead of mustard.  I chopped up the red onion and sweet relish extra fine.  Cut into triangles.
The other on white bread, without red onions- because I knew the mom didn't like onions at all.  Cut into squares.  The mustard flavor was way too strong.  I give it two stars.  
It turned out that the mom actually like the one with red onions, said it wasn't overwhelming.  
My husband who loves avocados, didn't care for either.

This is a recipe that I have put on toast for quite some time.  Add a little salt & pepper and it is delicious.  I normally whip or mush the avacodo and the egg together in lieu of cubing the avacado to allow it to spread better.

Did not modify the recipe! This is delicious! Our picky teenager who's not a big fan of avocados even loved this.  Best part, no left overs :)

This was amazing! I was sick of the same things for lunch all the time and I made this last night and made it exactly like it said and it tasted great. I had it on toasted bread with lettuce and tomato and it was awesome. I can't wait to bring it in my lunch again tomorrow!

I made this today as an easy meal for my husband and I, and it really tasted great! We will be making this again soon.
