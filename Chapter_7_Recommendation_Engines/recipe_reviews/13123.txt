A really wonderful soup. I would recommend adding a little bit more beans and potato to make it chunkier. I also didn't have white pepper, and it was still delicious. I made it for a luncheon and EVERYONE absolutely raved about it!

We really loved this soup! everybody, including kids loved it too. If you you want more spiciness (for daredevils) add more cayenne pepper! Try this if you love indian food!

The flavor is absolutely delicious.  I used the full amount of Cayenne pepper. I STRONGLY ADVISE everyone who makes this to make it without the cayenne pepper.  Add some at the end if you feel like you need to, but go easy.  This comes from someone who likes it SPICY.

This was really good served over rice or as a soup. I made it vegan by substituting the milk with silken tofu pureed with water (12oz silken tofu in food processor with 1/4c of water makes a creamy liquid). I whisked the tofu mixture into the simmering soup. I also added a can of Navy Beans.

This is a hot, spicy sinus clearing soup!  I used a sweet potato instead of the regular kind, navy pea beans instead of kidney beans, and soy milk instead of cow's milk.  Once I got used to the heat, this was a good soup!

Four stars because i didn't follow the recipe exactly, but it was amazing!!!  The white pepper is a must in my opinion.  I used red kidney beans and a can of canellini because it's what i had on hand (i also doubled the recipe).  I skipped the curry powder because i didn't have any.  I'm glad i did, because the soup had an amazing and unique flavor without it, and i think had i added it would have tasted too indian or thai.  Anyways, i'll be making this again!  It's different, spicy, and perfect for a cold winter night.

Very yummy. No hot pepper powders and used the flower/water combo instead of instant potatoes.

My Moroccan husband absolutely loved this recipe!  He felt it carried an Indian curry flair.  But he gave it 5 stars, said it was super spicy and cleared out his sinuses :-) ! Thanks- this ones a keeper.

Made to recipe, this was an extremely spicy soup.  We had to cool the spices down, but when we did, the flavor was great.

Hearty, tasty, and unique!  Is it legitimately Moroccan?- I don't know, but the flavors are wonderful!  I subbed white beans for kidney beans, only due to what I had on hand, and even my picky roommates ate it up!

Very flavorful.  We love spicy food but were happy with the recipe without the cayenne.  In addition to the kidney beans and potato, I added a can of garbanzo beans and some steamed cauliflower & skipped the potato flakes b/c I didn't have any.  It was a good recipe, I'll make it again with modifications.

This was very tasty! I didn't use the potato flakes because I don't like the texture, so I thickened it a little with some flour and water before I added the milk and cream.  It worked out great.  I think this would be a really good base for a fish or chicken curry.
Thanks for another great recipe!

A fantastic recipe, and easily adjusted based on how much heat your family can handle.  I'm vegetarian so I left the chicken bouillon out and used veggie stock rather than water.  I didn't have white pepper so I just stuck with black pepper, but other than those two things I stuck with the recipe.  This is an excellent recipe and very hearty, perfect for a cold, rainy day.  Thanks for sharing :)

This is my new favorite soup!  I made this in a crockpot, throwing everything in except the milk, cream, and green onions right at the start.  I omitted the white pepper and reduced the cayenne substantially, knowing my kids would not be able to tolerate it that hot.  A few minutes before serving, I stirred in the milk, cream, and onions.  This was delicious!  It had a nice, peppery bite that the kids sort of objected to, but the adults agreed it was a fantastic soup.

I liked this alot. I did add frozen peas to this to give some color and flavor. Next time I would add a few more and definitely add more beans.

Delicious change from every day soups. Swapping out butter beans for half of the kidneys was great. Also used light kidneys, not dark.  Was a bit spicey, so I would also recommend holding back on the pepper the first time.

This was very tasty, however too salty, perhaps my own fault as i used a chicken base soup starter for the boullion which i think was the culprit. I used great northern beans. I didn't have whole milk or 1/2 and 1/2, so i used 1% milk with a splash of whipping cream. I will make this again.  Thank you William.

This soup reminded me of the soup we had on the southern coast of Spain (near Morocco). However, I added a can of butter beans to the recipe and yum!

Wow! This soup rocks! My husband and I ate it over brown rice in a bowl, which adds another yummy layer of flavor! It had the perfect amount of curry for our taste. I didn't have any half-and-half, and my milk had gone bad, so I improvised with 1 cup soy milk with 1 Tbs. butter (melted into the soup). I think that really helped keep the soup from being too spicy. IT WAS FANTASTIC! Thank you!!!

This was deliciously spicy and has a strong heat that makes you want to eat more! I loved the fact that the spice was mellowed by the creaminess of the milf and half n half. What a kicker! Thnx!

I've made this recipe twice, with slight additions/variations each time. Each time it was delicious! I didn't add curry because of my under 2 year old son, but did use the white pepper. Delicious! I also didn't use potato flakes, just real cubed potatoes, and I did add whole milk and romano cheese at the end. It was also lovely to look at with the dark kidney beans, the white cubed potato, and the green Kale, oh yes, I added Kale. YUMMY! I think I'll make this again tomorrow...

Great winter soup.  Very fast and comforting. I use white kidney beans so soup is not this colour and more like a potato soup.

Very tasty and flavorful. I used White/Northern beans instead of white kidney beans and several red potatoes but I think it still turned out fantastic. I docked one star because I think it was less of a soup and more broth-like but was perfect over rice. However, to be fair, I also didn't have 1/2 and 1/2 which would have added a thicker texture (plus kidney beans would have been thicker as well). I will definitely make this again.

I volunteer at a soup kitchen and this was a big hit! I did add extra beans and made a batch of rice. some ate the soup as is and some used it as a sauce on rice I added Cayenne to mine because I like spicy! Everyone loved it. I will make again!

I recently made this soup and two others for a Soup-Off! and it was the clear winner.  The texture combined with the awesome flavour left the judges wanting more!  I used only one tbsp of olive oil and eliminated the white pepper as I didn't have any on hand.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe as written.  Enjoy!

This soup makes a great base for vegetable soup-- just add an assortment of veggies. We added green beans, carrots, peas, and more potatoes and beans than indicated. We also used red bliss potatoes with skins on and added more than indicated.   I think a red bell pepper would be great too.  Also we used a homemade stock instead of water with the bouillon flakes. Another addition was some garlic to the onions. Also I did use more of the black and white peppers. We also used skim milk and low fat half and half.   This soup can easily be made thicker with a bit more potato flake, "brothier" with more water, or creamier with more milk or half and half.  Also, if you have access to a range of peppers, ancho or chipotle powders would make a nice substitute for the cayenne, or use a Hungarian paprika, which would add heat and a different flavor than cayenne as well.
Some hummus and feta on the side or a green salad with a sparkling wine makes a great dinner!
