This is a good basic recipe.... like all southwestern style recipes, it needs to be adjusted to each individuals desired level of heat.  
Also, I seem to be tortilla-rolling impaired. When I roll them up "jelly-roll style" I can't seem to get them rolled tight enough, so when I cut them, they unravel.  I find it much easier to do these quesadilla style.  I put the filling between two tortillas, chill, then cut them into wedges.

This makes a great appetizer at any party. Easy on the salsa picante as the green chilies are already spicy.  I found that to cut them perfectly one has to first roll them and wrap them in Saran wrap and refrigerate for approximately 2 hours. Take the Saran wrap off and cut . They are just perfect.

These are awesome!! I used the entire pack of taco seasoning, eliminated the olives (don't like), and used jalaps instead of chilies.  Some guests thought they were too hot, but I thought they were just right; a nice bite but didn't send you racing for a drink.  My only issue (and it's probably my error) is they don't have as nice of a presentation as I prefer. Maybe it was the tortillas I used....I have already made these 3 times since my initial experince a week ago.  Keeper....and I used 1/3 less fat cream cheese, 2% cheese, and fat free sour cream and they were still fabulous.

These were really good, we made them according to recipe. We weren't too keen on the green chiles though. Next time we make these I would probably substitute chopped jalapenos for the chiles. I may cut the cream cheese a little or up the sour cream a bit (per our tastebuds.) We also thought a bit of avocado would be lovely a lovely addition.

These are really great appetizers for any party function.  I made them and took them to work and everyone that tried them had to come and ask me about them.  Thanks for the great recipe!

These are really tasty! I didn't have the green chiles on hand, so I left them out.  I would recommend not mixing in the olives, cheese and onions, as I think the cream cheese mixture spreads better without all the chunky vegies, just spread on the cream cheese, and sprinkle on the toppings...otherwise, turned out wonderful!

Took these bite size pinwheels to a potluck and received great feedback! Used a very soft flour tortilla; will probably try a firmer jalepeno or tomato flavored wrap next time.

I made these exactly as the recipe calls for.  They are great.  It made a lot for just the two of us.  Would be great for a party appetizer.  They also freeze well.  Just thaw in the refrigerator when you want them.  We will make them again.

These were the first thing to disappear at a weekend party. Lots of compliments! Next time, I will forget the salsa for dipping though because everyone seemed to bypass it anyway.

Great as written but. . .I have taken this recipe and added chopped jalapenos, removed the picante sauce, and added cheddar cheese and it is incredible!!! Tasty enough this way that you don't need to serve it with salsa! I do think the next time I make these I will serve with guacamole, though, I think guac would really compliment these well!. Thanks for a great recipe!

I made these for a baby shower we had for someone at work. They were a big hit! My boss had some and told me later "whoever made those cheese roll-up things did a great job!" I used diced red pepper instead of green onion because the onions at the store were awful looking. Delicious!

These were a cute appetizer. Next time I will use less picante sauce or sour cream, they were a little wet. The flavor was great thanks for sharing.

I followed the recipe exactly and also tried a few variations.  I headed the advice of many of the reviewers and used a little less of the taco seasoning.  I tried it without the seasoning and with.  I liked both but my taste-testers like it with.  I also made it with picante and without.  I preferred the pinwheels with picante sauce but without the seasoning, but my taste testers liked it with picante and seasoning.  My biggest suggestion is to next time omit the sour cream if adding the picante because the pinwheels were a bit soft and didn't hold their shape as nicely.  I also drained the chiles to prevent making the filling too runny.  My taste testers agreed with many of the other reviewers to switch the green chiles for jalapenos.  Tasty recipe in any of the variations!

These were so good and EASY.  I used some diced jarred jalapenos instead of green chilies and omitted the olives because a friend doesn't like them.  Used salsa instead of picante (what I had).  Very tasty!

Excellent and EASY way to be the hero of the next potluck! Flavorful and forgiving recipe that can easily be changed to suit individual tastes. I left out the olives, and used 1 tbsp. chili powder with a small quantity (maybe 1/4 tsp or so?)  of cumin in place of the taco seasoning. I cleaned the mixing bowl with pieces of leftover tortilla but those calories do not count.

These were ok but I think may have used too much filling.  They were a bit thick and rich for my liking but the flavor was good.

Tasty. I thought it had a good amount of spice. However, as something that is not only supposed to be good to eat but have an appealing look, this doesn't quite cut it. The brown color from the taco seasoning make these not great for presentation. Try this for a good presentation: http://allrecipes.com/recipe/party-pinwheels/detail.aspx

These were perfect as an appetizer.  I included avocado in some of the rolls, and while they were still good, the tang of the Sour Cream and Cream Cheese was dulled - and that is what I like most of this recipe.  You can get away with adding chicken and not sacrifice flavor.

Excellent for large get-togethers! I made this for a finger food for Thanksgiving and everyone raved about it. I used small tortillas at first but went to large burrito size tortillas and they worked much better. Leaving overnight in refrigerator really melds the flavors and makes the pinwheels stay together better.

Terrific and easy to make. Added one seeded chopped jalapeno. Used black olives instead of green. These were perfect for a "bring a dish" get together. Made them the night before. They went over big. These pinwheels are easy to grab and pop in your mouth.

These are a great make ahead appetizer/snack recipe. Very easy and delicious! The only change I made was leaving out the olives, since our family doesn't like them. I like to serve with salsa for dipping.

Followed the recipe exactly.  

There's no real flavor to it but cream cheese, and too much of that is in the recipe.

I strongly reccomend you don't make this.

These were okay.  I did follow the recipe exactly. I found them to be a bit much for my taste.  I could only eat a couple, not because of spiciness, but I guess my tastebuds were overwhelmed from all of the ingredients.  Okay, but probably won't make again.

Tasty. Easy. Make ahead.  What's not to like! The cream cheese mixture can be used as a dip with tortilla chips or crackers, too.  Just stir it well when you take it out of the frig to loosen it up and warm it up. Thanks to Diane for sharing the recipe!

Good, people enjoyed them.  I found them to be a little bland, would have liked to taste the green chilies more.  Might cut back on some other stuff next time and increase the chilies.

These are SO good. I've been making these for most get-togethers since first finding the recipe several years back. I suggest making your own taco seasoning and salsa. It makes all the difference.

Made these yesterday for a party and they weren't too bad. Sadly I had to deviate from the recipe to use what I had but here is what I substituted. 1 can of drained tomatoes with green chiles for the picante sauce, and olives. I put cilantro, garlic, salt, pepper and a few other spices in to make it taste the way I liked it but did not use the taco seasoning. These were tasty but it still seemed like it was lacking. I only had 6 oz of cheese so more cheese and less sour cream would probably have made them better.

I am thoroughly disappointed with this :-( I should have know the taco seasoning would be overpowering, but yet I just dumped in 2 TBSP and blech!!  I also don't care for the brownish color it made the filling; it's just not visually appealing IMO.  I think all the other great ingredients could hold their own w/o the taco seasoning.  I am taking this to my friend's family gathering, who are Mexican, and they are all going to know the "white girl" brought it.  It's X-Mas day so I can't just run up to the store, but I might try to pull something else out of my hat and not even take it...

Very tasty and there was none left after the party but i would suggest to double the amount of ingredients to put a little bit more filling in the wrapes but i guess thats all up to personal prefrence very good served with salsa and a hot nacho cheese.

These pinwheels are AMAZING!!  I followed the recipe exactly except omitted the olives (personal preference).  These were the first thing to go at the party, everyone raved about them.  I must have used too much of the mixture on the tortillas, though, b/c it only filled 6, not 8x10" tortillas so will probably double the filling next time.  No one used the salsa for dipping so may skip next time but it helped make a great presentation.  Can't wait to make these again!

Fantastic!!  I left out the green chilies due to using a taco seasoning and 'salsa' that both have some bite already!  These were easy to make ahead and a hit at my sister in law's bridal shower!  So yummy!

I love this as a base recipe and the first time I made it as is....... since then I have kicked it up a bit. I add a hot salsa (my family likes a good kick) I don't measure the taco seasoning I just add but I m pretty sure I add more then 1/4c , I use 2 fresh garlic cloves pressed, I add pepper-jack cheese to the cheddar, as well as rotel diced tomatoes (w chilies)- sometimes hot and sometimes not! plus I will add finely chopped either jalaps OR serrano pepper. I then taste it to see if I like it and then mess with it accordingly. If its too hot then I just add more of the cheeses. _ all with my Pampered Chef products:)

It is 5pm central time on Christmas and my fiesta pinwheels are completely gone.!!!! I have to tell you this is not a evening of entertaining with a large group.  This is a intimate evening with my husband, our daugthter, her husband  and our 2 grandchildren.  THEY ARE GONE and we have not even started on the dinner I have prepared for the evening.  I rest my case on why this gets 5 star.

Pretty good, but I liked my older version better, without taco seasoning or picante sauce.  I think I'll keep the picante sauce but leave out the taco seasoning in the future.  I added roasted red pepper, and still think more veggies wouldn't hurt. I froze them so they would slice easier, but I'm not sure that was a good idea because they weren't as firm in the center as I'd like.  Maybe I need a tougher tortilla.  Will definitely make again.

I didn't want to rate these yet because I didn't have all the ingredients on hand and it wouldn't have been fair, but I had to and you'll see why.
These are delicious- I didn't use the chilis or green onions and I only had less than a half of a cup of cheese. But still they were  amazing. Mine held together nicely with flour tortillas. I liked that this recipe used sour cream and not mayo it added to the flavor of these. They were addicting. I will make them again to clean out the cupboard or as written for parties or if I have the ingredients. No sogginess either. Thanks for this recipe it's awesome.

These are awesome!  Went over really well. To tone down the spiciness for my kids, I made sure all the of things I used were mild.  Including the picante sauce, taco seasoning.  I also left out the chilis.

These got rave reviews from our guests!  Made them just as the recipe said and served them with green salsa.  They kept very well (wrapped whole) for a few days.  My only problem was trying to keep them round - but even a little smushed, they still tasted good!

Took these on a roadtrip and enjoyed them for 3 days. They kept well in a cooler and tasted so good. This is one of those recipes that could be tweeked to fit your tastes, but I followed it as written this time. I will be making these again.

These were OK. I was really excited about them and made them as a party appetizer. They weren't gobbled up. I think they were missing a little something. Couldn't eat more than a couple without getting sick of them. The recipe is a good jumping-off point, but I probably won't be making them again.

These were a hit at the BBQ this last weekend.  I left out the garlic powder and olives. I used tomato, jalapeño, and spinach tortillas. I found that folding a small portion of two adjacent sides then roll up with at non folded side works well.

Made these to go with my Mexican Supper
plans. Only cut the Taco Seasoning back
to 1 TSBP.  But I do believe that it really would be ok to do both TBSP.  It is a keeper.  Hubby loved them.

These are so great and easy for a party or potluck. I have made them as written and they are excellent, but I have also made various adjustments depending on what I have on hand (i.e. one time had no olives or green chiles so left them out, used half cheddar and half monterey jack). Very adaptable and forgiving...and everyone seems to love them!

Very Good. I think it would be perfect with some refriend beans as a base under the spread. Next time I will try that. I used some fresh jalepenos and it was very good!

I have made these a few times for parties and they always go fast.  I make them on four cheese, red pepper and spinach tortillas.  The three colors look nice on a platter.  I make them a day or two before, wrap in plastic wrap, and then slice right before serving.

This wasn't enjoyed by my family, I thought it tasted too much like the packaged taco seasoning.  I might try these again, changing up the seasoning and adding shredded chicken.

These are always a huge hit at parties.  I substitute the cream cheese with reduced fat cream cheese and use non-fat sour cream, along with heart healthy low-fat tortillas and they are still a hit!

The first time I made them I left out the green chilies and made them the night before.  They were very good and everyone seemed to like.  I'm going to make them again tonight but I'll use the green chilies this time. This is a great easy recipe.

Great recipe!  It was very easy to make.  I substituted with light cream cheese and spinach tortillas.  Like someone else said, I'll skip having the salsa to go with them as everyone bypassed it at the party.

I made these once & they're now requested all the time.  I made a few changes:  light sour cream, light cream cheese, 2% shredded cheese.  And I'm not an olive fan so I omitted those. I also added in grilled chicken to it.  They're a great appetizer for a party.

These were very good.  I left off the olives and also green chilis because they were already in the salsa.  I will definitely make these again.

I made these for a bunco party and they were a big hit.  In fact, my children were eating them before the party and I have had them as a snack since then.  I would highly recommend.  It was a learning curve for me to get them rolled up as tight as I wanted but I got better and they all tasted great.

These were great! Everyone loved them!
I omitted the olivesand the green chilis. I added 1 jalapeno finely chopped & I added half a red bell pepper finely chopped.Isntead of picante sauce I used taco sauce. DO NOT use Azteca tortillas as they are too soft and get soggy. Use a tortilla a bit more authentic and thicker.
Wrap each roll in saran wrap and put in fridge for at least 2 hours. I did overnight. Then cut into slices.

These were so good. They were gone within 15 minutes. The taco seasoning gave them a wonderful kick that other recipes like this just don't have. I think I added a little bit more taco seasoning then the recipe called for. I just added the seasoning 1/2 a teaspoon at a time until I got the taste I wanted.

These pinwheels were great, we called them "Broken Bones with Bloody Marrow" for a Halloween party we went to. I liked the scallions with the taco, salsa, cheese combo. I used light cream cheese, garlic herb and whole wheat wraps. A yummy appetizer.

Every now and then when I get bored I head over to my boyfriend's place to make something and I found this recipe and was inspired. They were amazing! We didn't use olives though, because I am not a big fan of them and instead of using a can of chilies we bought 5 or so Anaheim chilies and de-seeded them and cut them up pretty small and mixed them into the cream cheese mixture. My boyfriend is a big meat lover though so we bought a pack of ham and placed them on the tortillas with the mixture and we LOVED them. We only had enough ham to make a few though. One of his room mates ate one of them as a wrap before i sliced them up and said it was heaven. 
I loved these, but did think it was too much without the meat. Will definitely make them again, but probably with the ham again next time. They went quick with 4 boys! We were worried it wouldn't make enough, but this recipe made plenty!

These were very good and convenient!  I made them for tailgating and wrapped each on individually in plastic wrap until it was time to cut them.  I used whole wheat tortillas and had no problem with them getting soggy. As a matter of fact it's three days later and the leftovers still aren't soggy!  I liked these because they are like taco dip and chips all in one easy bite-sized portion!!

Went over well at Christmas time, I will double up my tortillas next time to keep them from getting soggy, but other than that these were excellent.

So easy to make for lots of people with ingredients that most people just have around.  It is definately an easy party hit.  I made them the night before I served them in wheat tortillas and used light sour cream and light cream cheese which did not detract from the taste.
