Great!  I used a bit more onion and celery and used pecans instead of water chestnuts.  Very moist.  I was able to assemble a couple of hours ahead of time, keep in the fridge, and then pop in the oven 1/2 hour before dinner.  Served 8 and still plenty of leftovers.

This is now a request at all family functions!  Very good - I cook the stuffing in broth vs. water and it's just that much tastier.

This was DELICIOUS! However, I did double the recipe because I had a 27 lb. turkey to stuff..I did add a cup of raisins for extra flavor. This was the best stuffing I ever made! This will definitley be back on the table next year:)

Would give 4-1/2 stars. The directions are a bit contradictory as my Pepperidge Farm (sage/onion) dry stuffing mix directions called for chicken broth, butter, onions & celery to prepare. So, all I additionally added was 1 Honey Crisp apple, 1 - 7 oz box of maple flavor turkey sausage (cooked and crumbled) and a handful of toasted coursely chopped walnuts. Didn't have water chestnuts on hand. Added fresh grnd pepper and a bit of fresh grated nutmeg. I bake as a side dish as I don't stuff my turkey. Cooked covered for 30 minutes then stirred it around. Baked for another 15 min uncovered or until top a bit browned . I would add more sausage next time as it wasn't noticable. Otherwise...good idea you can fiddle around with. Oh, can be prepared a day ahead and refrigerated (covered). Bring to room temp before baking or it will need longer cooking time.

This is the 2nd time I've made this recipe.  The first time I didn't read the recipe well (prepare stuffing to package directions) and just made it with the listed ingredients.  This time I followed the directions and it was very good.  I used a whole lb. of sausage and one granny smith apple (a huge one).  Thanks!

Everyone really really loved this, and I thought it was pretty dang tasty, even me, who dislikes sausage.  I made this pretty close to as written, however I did include more celery and onion - closer to 3/4 C celery and 1/2 C onion (diced VERY finely), I omitted the water chestnuts (forgot them at the store!! oops...) and used Granny Smith apples.   It was requested that I bring this again next year... Thanks for a great recipe.

My husband and I wanted to stuff our turkey with this for Thanksgiving this year but unfortunately it was a "dish" stuffing. We cut the apples down to 2 and still feel it was a bit much. We used Jimmy Dean maple flavor breakfast sausage and it added a really nice flavor. We will be using the recipe again

I use Jimmy Dean's Sage Breakfast sausage, and I add the apples (1 granny smith, 1 gala apple) to the celery/onion mix when I'm sauteeing. I use real butter and a little bit of the sausage grease to cook the celery mix. Also, I double the sausage, celery and onion amounts, take out the chestnuts, add a handful of orange flavored craisins and/or chopped nuts. Using broth is better too (low sodium). This is the best stuffing ever. I'm going to try it in the slow cooker this year. My family LOVES this recipe.

This stuffing is so good!  The only thing I would do differently next time is not use as many apples.

I've helped my mom make sausage dressing since I was a little girl. This isn't the same recipe but it is as close as I can find. This is a great recipe, but don't make the same mistake that I did last year. I used Granny Smith apples and the tart flavor was not great. Definitely use sweet apples.

Absolutely the BEST stuffing we have ever had!  Even people who "don't like fruit in stuffing" really enjoyed this.  Used 2 cups apple (half sweet and half tart), a 14 oz bag pepperidge farms herbed cubes.  Also used a can of light, fat free chicken stock to replace most of the water to prepare stuffing. Would be awesome baked on pork chops. Wonderful recipe, thanks!!

i dont normally use many convenience products in my cooking but i only had 1 day notice to throw thanksgiving and this looked good. i loved the apples in this and i was able to use venison sausage from the freezer. everyone raved about it and said it was the best they ever had. i thought you could taste that it was stove top but it was still pretty good. great last minute side dish!

Made this today for the Thanksgiving feast and it got rave reviews, even from my mom who usually does not like stuffing. I used Zatarain's stuffing for the base to add some spice (one package of the cornbread and one package of the french bread, so we had different textures) & followed the suggestions of other posters and cooked the stuffing part in chicken broth part in water. Since my husband hates celery I used crushed almonds instead, and for apples I used Gala apples which gave it a bit of a sweet to offset the spiciness of the stuffing.  The sausage was J.C. Potter regular, and the consensus was anything else would have been too much with that combination.  It took a while to prep but was VERY worth it, and I could not be more pleased.  I already have requests to make this again next year!

Really good!  Nice and moist.  I love how the heat of the sausage and sweetness of the apple work together.  I added a little more celery and onion than called for after reading the reviews and I think that made it really good.  I like the textures that the onions, celery, apples, and water chestnuts give it. Great!!!!  I doubled the recipe and it all got ate!

This was so MOIST and FLAVORFUL!!  The apple adds a touch of sweetness and the sausage is savory.  I didn't add the water chestnuts (didn't have).  I also used low sodium box vegetable broth in place of the water.  I halved the recipe and want to make again but hubby doesn't like apples in his "traditional style" cornbread dressing!  My kids and I loved it.

I made this last year and added slivered almonds to the mix. It was the perfect addition (I think walnuts or another nut would also be great)! This recipe is definitely a keeper! We will absolutely be having it this Thanksgiving.

I made this on Christmas Eve, and then again this week as cold weather comfort food.  I substituted kielbasa for the sausage, which was delish!  Browned it first.  Also, I tend to add more onion and less water chesnuts and celery -- just personal taste.  Both times, I chose not to add the whole third apple.  BEST stuffing I've ever had -- love it!

VERY DISAPPOINTING!!! had such high hopes based on the good reviews.  water chestnuts weren't a good idea, almonds would probably have tasted better and added a nicer texture. Needed more celery and onion. The apples should have been cooked before adding to stuffing mixture.  I was hoping for special treat however, this was a flop.

I trippled this recipe and made it last year for Thanksgiving.  Everyone loved it so much that I came on here to find it again.  I followed the recipe exactly, except for the water chestnuts, and it came out perfect.

I was looking for a stuffing to compare to the one my father made for years  but that was easier and faster to make and this is the closest that I've come. So, for the past few Thanksgiving and Christmas this is the one we now have and and everybody loves it!  I usually substitute turkey sausage for pork as I have some family members who don't eat pork and it still tastes great.  I also add the apples to the saucepan with the celery mix for the last few minutes of cooking and sometimes substitue regular chestnuts for the water chestnuts if I happen to have them on hand.  All in all a fantastic stuffing recipe!

Yummy stuffing!  I used turkey sausage in place of the pork and used only 2 apples (honey crisp).  Really delicious!

One of the best stuffing recipes I've ever tried - and i've tried a lot.  This one was easy and tasty.  I used sweet Italian sausage, for an extra-savory treat.

My guests all enjoyed the stuffing!  I will hold onto this recipe as a favorite! 
Yum! I liked the sausage with the sweet tart goodness of the apple! Delicious! 
I used cubed breadcrumbs, and will use that style again.

The stuffing was the best part of Thanksgiving.  It has a nice sweet flavor that enhances the traditional savory dishes nicely.  It did not keep beyond the second day of leftovers.

This was only okay on the first attempt.  Not much flavor-- perhaps I should blame the stuffing mix I chose.  I also used low-sodium broth; I think the regular broth would have been better.  I won't give up on it, though!

Pretty good. I had never had apple and sausage stuffing before and I enjoyed the flavor. I used almonds instead of water chestnuts, because hubby doesn't like water chestnuts. Next time I will use water chestnuts and make hubby pick them out.

I was disappointed because this turned out to be bland. I think next time I'll use maple flavored breakfast sausage to complement the apples. I actually ended up adding a little maple syrup to the stuffing to give it a little zing.

2.23.20  I used Pepperidge Farm® herb-flavored bread cubes, and added salt and pepper as well as considerably more chicken broth (it seemed dry) and ended up with perfectly moist stuffing.  There’s no reason to ever buy the expensive boxed stuffing (you know what I'm talking about), as this is extremely easy to make, and heats up well as a leftover, too.  Nice stuffing recipe.

I have never gotten any compliments on my stuffing until making this one.  I followed the recipe almost to the letter, except I used pecans instead of water chestnuts because I didn't have them.  I doubled the recipe but only used 4 apples.  Best stuffing ever!

This tastes great. My stuffing mix called for 1c onion,1c celery 1/2c butter so I didn't add more more of the vegetables. I used 14oz of chicken broth and 1/2c water and it was still dry. Maybe next time I will try a different brand of stuffing?

I've made this recipe for years with just few variations.  #1 I have a large family so I use a full pound of sausage.  #2  I use 2 different packages of stuffing...regular bread and corn bread.  #3 I add chopped pecans in place of the water chestnuts.  Always a big hit with the entire family...even the 8 grandbabies!

This is the stuffing recipe i have used for the past two years at Thanksgiving, and let me tell you, I look forward to it every year! Before this recipe, I never liked stuffing at all. Delicious, easy, so flavorful. Complete winner.
