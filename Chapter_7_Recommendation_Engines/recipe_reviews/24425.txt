This is THE BEST filling for lady locks.  I made them all summer long for graduation parties, and a 4th of July picnic. People couldn't get enough of them.  They loved that the filling wasn't too sweet.  It's more like  a pudding that DOES NOT weep after being frozen.  THE PEFECT FILLING!  YUMMY!
Thank you for sharing this recipe.  It will be a family favorite for years to come.

I've never made Lady Locks before and hubby requested them. So glad i found this recipe! However i do not have the forms so here's what i did - at home depot had them cut a dowel rod (sorry not sure on size, went by guessing!) anyway, they cut it into 4-5 inch pieces. I wrapped these in aluminum foil and sprayed with baking pam. Wrapped pre-made pastry puff around them and baked them @ 400 for roughly 12 minutes. With filling these are perfection!

This is very easy and very good.  Not too sweet--but sweet enough.

I made this recipe using the recipe for the pudding mix that was on the box. I ignored the 1 cup of milk that was on the ingredient list. It came out perfect!

Thought this would be good since it had pudding in the filling, but it didn't work on a few levels and came out with too much of a shortening flavor.  I even added some vanilla and some powered sugar to try to cut the shortening taste, but it still didn't mask it.  Also, I was confused on the recipe because it said to use 1 cup of milk and the directions on the pudding said to use 2 cups.  Should I have gone by the pudding drections instead of only using 1 cup?  I may try it again but using the milk qty on the pudding box and replacing 1/2 of the shortening with butter.  Good luck!

I have been making ladylocks for at least 20 years. i was disappointed in the filling. It was easy to make and held it's shape, but it tasted like shortening..no flavor at all. the taste just stays in your mouth..very greasy.
