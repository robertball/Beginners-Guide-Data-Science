Fantastic! though I did tweak it a bit. I did not have any ginger paste or garlic paste so I just added a few dashes of ground ginger and minced garlic along with an extra bit of olive oil. Also instead of jalapenos, I used some hot chili sauce which I think better compliments the spices. This turned out perfectly. I love that it is low fat and full of flavor!

This was a wonderful way to get my picky husband to eat fish.  Rather than use the extensive list of spices, I have a homemade curry powder mix I've made that gave this recipe a wonderful curry flavor.  I threw in baby potatoes in the dish and let it all cook together.  This is a family favorite now - we made it as often as we can get away with it.  I highly recommend this taste!

Great, simple curry that is tasty and quick to make. By the way, curry powder is just a mixture of several different spices, like the ones called for in this recipe. "Curry powder" is not a necessary ingredient for a curry dish.

My family really enjoyed this. The spices blended perfectly to create a delicious, authentic-tasting curry. The only addition I made was to add a little extra salt. I served it with aloo gobhi from another site and whole wheat parathas for a delicious, not too fatty meal. To the reviewer who thought this wasn't a real curry because it did not contain curry powder: the spices in this dish come together to create a curry flavor. Curry powder is just a blend of some of the same spices found in this recipe.

i'm not really sure why this is called 'curry' when there is no curry powder involved. it was ok as stated, but it seemed like it was missing something. since the name involved curry, i decided to add curry powder - 6 tbsp, and 1/4 c fat free half and half. this made it much better in my opinion, something like a korma. definitely worth making again with the changes - and there really wasnt anything lost because i tried the sauce before i served it so i had time to add things.

Good recipe.  My husband suggested salting the fish before adding it to the curry.  Thanks!

This was an easy healthy dish.  I had everything but cilantro and cardamon....I will make it again using the full ingredient list since I questioned the amount of spices...thinking it needed more of everything and definitely a little more salt. Lots of wonderful juice and great over rice.  I cut my cod into 2 inch rectangles from a full fillet.  The fish was done in under the 15 min....I also think the spices would have come through more if I had had time to let it rest more.

the proportions of spices are excellent and this allowed for one to taste the different levels of flavor; one spice did not overpower the other.  I had a 14.5 oz. can of crushed tomatoes and then chopped up some romas that needed using up.  I added 4 cloves of garlic and although I did not double the spices, I heaped each amt. that the recipe called for.  Only other spice addition was anise seed, which I like in fish dishes.  I usually don't use cilantro in Indian cooking because it tends to overpower the spices, so just pinched off a small handful and chopped.  Added some turkish flat beans for a little more veggie, and served w/basmatic saffron rice.  Thanks for this super quick and easy recipe!

This was terrific!  I only had one 14 oz can of tomatoes, so I added a little tomato paste with the garlic and ginger, and a little water with the canned tomatoes.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe.  My husband and I enjoyed this very much.  Thanks for the post!

This was amazingly delicious, quick to prepare and can be easily modified to suit different tastes.  As others suggested,  I increased the spices and used fresh ginger and garlic since that is what I had on hand.  Served over rive, and even my husband who is not a big fish fan loved it.  This recipe I'd a keeper and will work well with any fish or even leftover chicken.  I let the sauce sit for a couple of hours to blend the flavors and then added the fish and cooked for ten minutes more.  Yum!

Yum!  This was just awesome.  I took the advice to cook the sauce ahead of time and let it sit for a few hours before reheating and adding the fish (I used Tilapia since that's what I had on hand).  After reading other reviews, I also added 2 tsp. of curry powder along with the other spices.  I also left the seeds in the jalepenos since we like spice.  This was just so good, I can't wait to make it again!

This was wonderful!  I made a few changes based on what I had already at home: used fresh garlic and ginger instead of the paste, and used cardamom pods instead of the powder (though I hope to try making it with the powder next time).  My husband said this was a "keeper" recipe.  Can't wait to make it again.  Thanks!

I have tried this recipe with several kinds of fish (flounder, tilapia, grouper) and it really works well. I appreciate that it is healthy meal that tastes great. For the spices, I typically put in a bit more for flavoring.

I bought cod for the first time recently and  I'm happy to have this unique fish dish to put into my dinner rotation.  My only modification was to keep the seeds in the chiles for more heat, and add a dash of cayenne.  Very tasty.

fantastic recipe!  I do a lot of Indian cooking, so had all the ingredients (except the fish) on hand;  the recipe whips up in a flash then simmers away, blending, until you're ready to eat---perfect!  My husband loved this;  i served it with warm naan bread, steamed spinach, and store-bought vegetable samosas with tamarind chutney.

This was fantastic and a very easy recipe. I used Alaskan cod and like other reviewers, used fresh garlic and ginger instead of the paste.  Didn't have  jalapenos so I used a couple of dashes of green hot sauce. I also didn't have any cilantro, but it was fine without it. Next time I'll try the fresh jalapenos though.  Served over rice.

Husband hated it. My daughter who loves everything didn't like it either. I thought it was okay but won't make it again because of the response from everybody else. I did everything but the jalapenos.

Personally, I did not care for this recipe.  I did not enjoy the combination of flavors but hubby cleaned his plate.  He is typically a much pickier eater than I am.  Perhaps my taste buds had taken the night off.

My husband caught the cod as it is summer time, so I used fresh tomatoes (about 5 for four servings), and I didn't have the peppers so I used Thai chili sauce.....this is a delicious recipe I shall make it again.......

This was just delicious! I cut it down to 2 servings, but used pretty much the full amount of ingredients except only one 14.4 oz can tomatoes.  I added about 1/2 cup of vegetable stock as there wasn't much liquid with my tomatoes.  I used frozen, thawed cod and this came out PERFECT! (Even though I tend to be a fresh fish snob!)  Great flavor, perfect amount of spice for me. Thanks, Jennifer!

This was OK. I was expecting a more "curry" flavor and, though it had a lot of flavor, it wasn't curry. It ends up looking sort of like salsa. It was a nice change and easy to make.

Love, love, love this. Soooo fresh. Throw in some poblano or switch it out, add a can of diced tomatoes, etc. It's so versatile and healthy. I make extra and bring it to work. Great with a little rice to extend it or as is. A must try even if you don't have all the spices.

It was flavorful, I'll say that for it, but my husband and I both agreed:  the tomatoes were just too much.  It should have been 'a hint,' not the overpowering ingredient.  If I try it again, I will probably use a quarter of the amount of tomatoes .... to get the flavor, but to also be able to taste everything else.  Thanks for the recipe, though -- it's great to have another way to cook cod!

Super delicious!  My husband tweaked it with a bunch more of the spices asked for and we added chopped red and green bell pepper.  We amended a bit due to what we had and didn't have available--Used chopped & powdered garlic and chopped ginger, used korean red chili pepper instead of jalapeno peppers, and we didn't have any cilantro.  We served it over a bed of organic spinach.  Very healthy, easy, and so very delicious!  Thank you to JenniferB3 for this recipe!!!

Excellent! Cooked just as required but my peppers weren't very hot so I added some hot pepper sauce at the table.  Turned out terrific. Added plain yogurt to it at the table which gave it a delicious tang and creaminess as well.

Gorgeous!
I used more garlic and used curry powder instead of all the different spices. Also added a "healthy squirt" of Siracha to it. The Hubs loved it!

Although I will never make this again, I am giving it a high rating because I liked it.  Unfortunately hubby did not and since he usually loves anything with fish in it, it doesn't bode well for this recipe that he did not finish his dinner.  I didn't change anything, just made it exactly as written. If hubby doesn't like it, it doesn't get repeated.  But there's nothing wrong with this recipe as it is.

We love the recipe... I just made it to use the sauce for left over roast chicken that was boring! Sometimes I don't scrape the peppers & will really enjoy a hot treat! This can be used so many different ways... but it is great with fish. 

The first time I made it the sauce was so hot (I didn't scrape the hot peppers) so I cooked the cod on the side instead... Some ate it with the cod or mixed it with the side of Basmati rice that I made... Can't say enough about this one!

This was delicious!!!  I didn't have individual spices so I used Garam Masala spice mix (easy to find in stores) it has the cumin, Coriander, Cardamom, Ginger and more spices in it. I used fresh garlic and fresh jalapenos from my patio garden.Forgot to add cilantro.Found I didn't  need it. It was so good that I had seconds on fish, which I never do. My guy really liked it also. Served with brown rice and peas on the side.

Very good! Husband and friends loved it also. Didn't have tumeric so used curry powder (has it in it) instead. Left out cardemon (didn't have it either). Used 2 cloves garlic and ground ginger instead of paste. Served over jasmine rice. Made sauce earlier in day and then just heated up and added fish about 15 min before dinner.

I love spice and was looking for something different tonight.. This is an amazing dish! I didn't have garlic and ginger paste, so I used chopped garlic and ground ginger. I didn't have cilantro either- I used crushed tomatoes instead of diced and it made a delicious sauce served over brown rice. I cut the cod in 2 inch strips also. This was so good!!! I served it with steamed spinach/mushrooms and a side of sweet smashed potatoes which acccented the spicy cod nicely!! Thank goodness for Curry!! :9)

Very good! My mom loved it and she hates fish. (but she loves cilantro) Not a very strong curry flavour, but I didn't have tumeric or jalapenos so I chopped a green pepper and added a couple dashes of hot sauce.

My husband and I really enjoyed this.  I used finely minced garlic and ginger in place of the pastes, but otherwise made the recipe exactly as written.  We ended up needing to add extra salt.  I served it over millet.  It was a great way to eat frozen fish, as I find strong flavors are helpful when not using fresh fish.

Incredible!  I made it as written.  So flavorful and simple!  Next time I think I'll use crushed tomatoes instead of diced (personal preference) and maybe up the amount of cod a little.  Definitely a keeper!

I am not criticizing this recipe, but was not thrilled with the intensity of the spices in this dish. It was just hard to enjoy with the painfulness of the spice. I do planning on making this again, but will add the heat after I am done cooking and have tasted it first.

I made it and made my own ginger and garlic paste by crushing some in a mortar and adding a bit of olive oil.  I left out the Jalapeno Peppers because my wife doesn't like too spicy.  It was very good.

However, I had the leftovers the next day for lunch and they were AWESOME!  As good as most Indian restaurants.   So, take the optional step of setting the sauce aside or over night and then reheating it with the Cod fish.

I would add red pepper flakes next time because I added a can of coconut milk  which mellowed the heat . My husband loved it and wants it to become a regular on our menu roster.

This recipe was delicious- I omitted the cilantro bc I don’t like it and I didn’t want to buy cardamom for one dish- I accidentally bought the 14oz can of diced tomatoes so I used that and one same size can of tomato paste and about 1/2 cup of chicken broth to make up for the missed juice- also I seasoned the cod after I cut it into chunks with curry and graham masala and garlic salt and black peppers. Other then that I really did follow the recipe, and as Indian food lovers it came out really delicious and authentic tasting- I let the curry cook for 3 hours on low- and let the cod sit in the spices in fridge for 3 hours as well until I was ready to cook. Very good flavor and will def be added to the rotation-  if I would add any comments- id you like more spice to your dish- def add cayenne or any hot spice you like or pepper to add some heat- and I think maybe 3 jalapeños may be better just to add that extra bite- maybe bc I left out cilantro which does add a lot- anyway All and all I followed directions and it came out really tasty- and my husband said it was delicious! I served over riced cauliflower- very healthy and tasty dish

Very easy to make, prepared sauce 2 hours ahead, added fresh tomatoes. Cod cooked very quickly. Might add a few capers to add a bit of saltiness. Jalapeños did not overpower.

I added new potatoes as recommended by another reviewer. I put in some  veg broth to thin it out during the simmer. Also salted the cod before adding. Put in the juice of a whole lemon.

Delicious.  I didn't have cardamom so I left it out.  I used 1/2 tsp ground curry and 1 Tbsp of minced garlic (sauted with onion) in place of pastes.  I also replaced minced jalapenos and diced tomatoes with "Rotel."  Just making do with what I have.  I'm sure the original recipe is great.

This dish is a keeper. It is DELICIOUS!
We loved the aroma of spices while it was cooking.
I diced fresh Roma tomatoes & made my own tomato base instead of using canned tomatoes. 

I will serve this to company.

Really good.  I substituted a can of green chiles for the fresh jalapenos, and added 2 tablespoons of Thai red curry paste for zing when I added the tomatoes.  Very nice, and easy to make.

This recipe is very good. Along with fish tacos this recipe is the best I have found for cod. I have made it many times. The cod blends very well with the sauce and cooks to perfection. Yum!

Great recipe, but the end result is highly dependent on the quality of the fish.   I increased the amount of spice and the curry sauce was  quite good, but the fresh cod I used still lent a fishy flavor that permeated the dish.  I would suggest using this recipe but replacing the cod with shrimp or chicken.

Yes excellent.  Definitely will make again. Very easy. Yummy. Used frozen tomatoes from the garden. Garlic powder instead of garlic paste,  minced frozen ginger instead of ginger paste, and frozen green peppers from the garden instead of the chillis. All the substitutions didn't matter still very good. Also I used what felt right for the amounts of ingredients- did not measure. Served sauce over angel hair. Awesome - not too fishy at all. Was able to re-heat the left overs for lunch at work and no-one was grossed out with a fishy odor at all!

This was a last minute choice on a busy day when I had no idea about what to cook for dinner. I had a couple of cod filets I knew I could quick thaw and this looked interesting. I did not have all the spices or the jalapeno, so I used curry powder and a splash of sriracha instead. This is a good recipe, and I will definitely be making it again. Very tasty.

This recipe was pretty easy to make and turned out awesome! It had a delicious blend of flavor with just the right amount of a spicy kick. I didn't have the garlic paste or ginger paste, so I followed another reviewer's suggestion to use a few dashes of ground ginger and minced fresh garlic. I did feel that the sauce was a little too dry, so I added a couple tab,espoused of water. I highly recommend this recipe!

I really enjoyed this. I was worried that it wouldn't be good but its so flavorful. The lemon was great in it and went so well with the cod. I only made half the amount because I had one can of diced tomatoes (and also I knew I'd be the only one eating it) I used spicy red pepper diced tomatoes, one jalapeño, and about 1/2 teaspoon of chili paste (I love spicy). Also, even though I halved the recipe, I went a little heavy on the seasonings. I was able to make the sauce early in the morning and I cooked the fish when I got home from work and it was very good. If you're not a fan of curry then I don't recommend this recipe to you. Definitely will make again.

Really yummy recipe.  I had to leave out the jalapeno because I wanted to make it palatable for our kids, but the grown-ups added a spicy pickle at the table that went very well.  This recipe is easy to follow and prepare, but takes a bit of time.  Luckily, I had all of the ingredients available except for the ginger/garlic pastes, so I followed a recipe to make it myself, also on allrecipes.com.  I think the recipe would taste wonderful with shrimp or other kinds of seafood as well as the cod.  The only change that I made to the recipe was cooking the cod for only 5 minutes, instead of 15.  You have to be really careful not to overcook fish or else it becomes rubbery.  After 5 minutes, the fish was perfect (I had cut them in about 3/4" cubes, so maybe that's why it took so little time to cook).

This was a really great way to use up cod! I didnt have some of the spices on hand so substituted curry powder and would agree with others that it needs a little bit of salt on the fish before it is added. Other than that this is a great recipe! I served it over brown rice:)

Great flavor and texture!!  I peeled and cut 2 zucchinis into chunks and added them shortly after adding the onion.  I also discovered i had no lemons or lemon juice but did have limes so i substituted lime juice.  I didn't use near as much jalapeno-had a drying one and cut it up and added only some.  It had quite a bite, but my 9yo ate it with lots of rice and enjoyed it. made my own garlic and ginger paste using an allrecipes recipe. I will make this again and hopefully get quicker at prep.

I made this with haddock instead of cod as I prefer the taste, both my husband and I really enjoyed it.  It was perhaps less spicy than it might have been as I only had one chilli pepper, having said that it's probably just as well as I gave it to my 1 year old too - she enjoyed it.  I prepared the sauce and then did exactly as the recipe said, I left it for a few hours whilst we went to see a show at the theatre.  It was definitely a good idea, the taste had really improved and when we came home I just heated it up, added the fish, and wow...it was a really tasty meal.  We had it with rice - I tried coconut rice for the first time from this website.  To be honest I should have stuck with plain basmati, I would have enjoyed my fish even more.  Top marks for this recipe, it's definitely one I will use again.  Thanks.

This is a deliciously tasty recipe but it is not really authentic or hot as it actually has no curry in it.  This very good for a guest or a friend who you know probably isn't to keen on spicy foods and probably wouldn't try something like this.

Amazingly simple - and almost as good as my hand ground curries!  Have used the tomatoe curry base with other meats such as pork - very similar to Vendalloo.

Easy, quick, and scaleable.

Very easy and very flavorful.  I will definitely make this again.  I used my zester to zest the ginger and garlic, rather than buying an expensive tube of the paste.  Worked out wonderfully.
