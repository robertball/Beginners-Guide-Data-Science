Delicious and creamy and goes perfectly with fish. The two changes I made were to use half and half cuz I keep it on hand and to use about half the lemon zest simply out of fear of it being overpowering.

This is excellent. My Jasmine rice called for a cook time of 15 minutes so that is what I did. Added some defrosted peas at the end when I mixed the lemon mixture and the parm. 
Served with salmon and homemade applesauce, yum yum!

I love this rice! I am a huge lemon fan but not a rice fan. This is delicious and so easy to make. The jasmine rice is so soft and creamy. My whole family (8 yo, 11 yo and picky 48 yo) all loved it. I made it 2 days in a row and now I'm making it again. LOVE IT! (I followed the recipe exactly.)

I really liked this, it was different, not something I would make on a weekly basis but for special occacsions with a fancy meal. I cut down a tad on the lemon, which was my preference.

A fresh and pleasant change from my usual rice pilaf.  It goes well with fish!  My family loves this, and I know I'll be making it again

I made this last night and was a little apprehensive because I'm not a huge lemon fan but OMG this was so amazing!  My fiance said it was the best pilaf he's ever had.  The creaminess and hint of lemon was outstanding!  I made it as written except I needed to add 1/4 cup extra chicken broth but that's only because my stovetop cooks fast.  This recipe is a keeper!

Hubs gave this one two thumbs up. I'm not much on jasmine rice but he couldn't stop talking about how creamy and flavorful it was. I served it with grilled steak and shrimp and it went really nice with that. Definite keeper!
