I used frozen mixed veggies in a bag and prepared them just as the recipe states for the carrots and celery. I used frozen mussels out of a bag from Jewel and prepared them the same as the recipe calls for.  I also cooked linguine noodles on the side, tossed with a little extra virgin olive oil and dried parsley before pouring the broth mussels and veggies over the noodles.  It was an excellent and complete meal!

Absolutely the best mussels I have ever tasted!! They simply disappeared from everyone's plate. Perfectly cooked, fantastic flavor.

So, soooo good! I doubled the amount of carrots and celery, and it was like serving a gourmet soup with mussels. I served it over pasta tossed in EVOO. This is a perfect recipe, and I will make it again. My kids loved it - even my super picky 5 year old requested it "tomorrow." :)

The whole family liked this. I did not have fresh spinach on hand so I used frozen spinach and it turned out pretty good. Would make this again.

1 star  All I tasted was the celery and carrots.  The taste of the mussels never came through.  Next time I will steam it just with a little wine and garlic.

First time I ever made a soup with mussels.  My husband and I just loved it!   I had all ingredients for this recipe and then some.  My changes/additions:  I used frozen mussels, added a pinch of  Old Bay seasoning, threw in some leftovers in my fridge--a half cup of brown rice, a quarter cup of diced tomatoes, and a half cup of mixed vegetables (I don't like to waste food and if I can use it up, depending upon what I'm making, I use it.)  I served this soup with some crusty bread, and we had a very satisfying meal.

Excellent. I did add some thyme and used frozen cooked mussels. I added mussels and simmered just till they were thawed and hot.

Great recipe.  Easy to fix and a change from preparing them using wine.
