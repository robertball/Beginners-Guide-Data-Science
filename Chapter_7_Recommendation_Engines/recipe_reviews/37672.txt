Being tired of banana breads, cookies and muffins I decided to try this recipe.  I used 3/4 cup of leftover heavy  sugar syrup to which lemon juice had been added during cooking (2cups sugar, 1 cup water & 1/4 cup lemon juice).  I then processed the bananas and the syrup briefly in food processor until smooth, poured into a tupperware container, froze for a few hours, mashed with a fork and froze again.  Hubby, who's not too fond of banana concoctions, asked for second and third helpings.  DELICIOUS.

This recipe needs an easy fix to be 5 stars.  Use 3 cups of water and yellow food coloring.  I made it according to the recipe and froze it overnight.  The next day it was a gooey heavy frozen banana.  I had nothing to lose so I added 2 more cups of water, yellow food coloring and mixed it in a food processor.  Within 2 hours of refreezing it was a yummy banana sorbet.

I made this for my son who can't eat dairy.  I baked my bananas first for 20 minutes at 400 degrees F which prevents them from browning.  It was very sweet, but for my son it was perfect.  I added chocolate chips for him as a little treat.  I will definitely make this again!

Didn't really care for it...way too sweet & the whole thing turned dark well before it even froze.  Maybe some lemon juice would help?

Good recipe-- and quick.  Here's an even quicker variation:  use the same ingredients and measurements.  
     Put sugar and banana in blender workbowl and blend until sugar dissolved. Add ice water and pulse to mix.  Put cold mixture in freezer bowl of electric ice cream maker and allow to turn and freeze.  My ice cream maker took about 25 minutes to produce ready-to-eat sherbet.

This recipe is really easy - you do need to use much less sugar though. I used 1/2C, next time I will try 1/4C.  I also added a splash of lemon juice to both the syrup and mashed banana to retain the color.  Overall, I liked it.

Due to the reviews I cut back the sugar a bit. I also added a pinch each of cinnamon & nutmeg, an additional banana a dash of cocoa & a splash of milk. It came out beautifully. Next time I'm going to add some strawberries just to see what happens.

This is a very unappetizing dish to look at! Unless of course you like different color browns for dessert! Too sweet also as another reviewer noted.

Sorbets are easy, but this one as are many, was over sweet.  Use less sugar (to your taste), lemon juice to keep the natural color, and some vanilla to keep the sorbet from freezing too hard, it should be slightly soft even when completely set.
FYI, for those of you adding milk, you no longer have a sorbet, it is now sherbet.

Excellent sorbet, but it needed lemon juice to stop the banana from browning.  I added a few squirts to the syrup and a few to the mashed banana.  I added some yellow food colour as well (why not, right?).  I also used an ice cream maker.  Overall, a good base recipe to muck around with... I will try adding mini chocolate chips next time!

This tastes really good, however, I did follow the advice of Shorecook and used 3 cups of water instead of just 1 and the yellow food coloring (I got a bit carried away with it but thats okay) When I mixed it my youngest son had to have a bowl and he scarfed it down. I'm waiting for it to re-freeze so I can scoop mine out =)) A unique simple idea for over ripe bananas.

Kinda plain. In my version, i made the sugar syrup with brown sugar, cinnamon, cocoa powder and vanilla extract> blended in 3 bananas and froze it. YUMMY! kinda like a frozen, virgin bananas foster.

This was tasty, just tastes like yummy sweet banana . Nice for the kids but might need jazzing up for adults. I would be tempted to add coconut milk or maple syrup for a more complex flavour. On a technical note, leave your banana mashing til last to minimise blackening and add yellow food colouring.

I have yet to attempt this so i'll just 3 for a good idea that needs better execution. but i'll comment further after giving it a shot. the reviews looked good enough only problem really being the color. in that case if anyones willing to try it again, add a Tbsp or so of lemon juice. the acid will cut through some of that sweetness and keep the bananas from browning =)

I was amazed how creamy this turned out. I used an ice cream maker and it worked well. Hard to believe that 3 ingredients can make such a great dessert.

I followed the comment of using three cups of water and adding yellow food coloring. That made it work real well. I just kept refreezing and remixing with beaters until it met my consistency. It doesn't look like a creamy sorbet like in the pictures but I thought it was still real good.

I also used a simple syrup as suggested in a prior review,  and added it to taste...I used about 5 overripe banannas, and then just for the heck of it I threw in some strawberrys...it turned out great!  This is a nice recipe that is a bit lighter then the usual bananna bread for leftover banannas, and nice for summer!

Just made this and wish I had read the reviews first.  I agree that you could probably cut the sugar in half -- too sweet.  Great idea though, will definitely be making this again with less sugar and would love to add in other kinds of fruit too.

My family won't eat bananas once they are two hours past ripe!  So, I've been looking for recipes that call for ripe bananas. This tasted pretty good, but I wouldn't call it sorbet.  It did not have the lightness that comes with sorbet.  It was more like frozen sweetened mashed bananas. I did cut back to 3/4 cup sugar based upon others' recommendations.  So, it didn't taste too sweet.  But, we all concluded that we'd rather just eat a banana, or even a frozen banana.  Perhaps it would be more sorbet like if you let chunks of banana flavor the syrup, then strain out half of the banana before mixing and freezing? Sorry. I really wanted to like this one.

NEEDS just a little work, Knowing it would be too sweet from everyone else's input, I chose to start with a little over 1 cup of crushed ice in the blender, 4 sliced up bananas on top of that,pour over a cup of the cooled simple syrup. Blend thoroughly and pour into a gallon freezer ziplok bag. freeeze but pull the bag out every 20 minutes or so to palpate the bag and make sure the mixture stays pliable. You can put it in the blender and reblend after it is frozen. It stays bright and yellow and tasted really good

I double the amt of banana and add a couple spoonfulls of OJ to keep it yellow.  I make this early in the morning and hand-mix it with a fork every few hours so I don't have to deal with an electric mixer.  If ya really want a sugar rush, add some caramel sauce ontop, so good!  :D

Talk about easy!  I used only half the sugar as many had suggested.  To make things a little quicker, I put a 1/2 cup sugar in the microwave with just enough water to make it disolve.  I then added ice cubes and let it melt until I had 1 cup of the mixture.  For those who complained about the browness.  You get out what you put in.  I cut out the couple of brown spots in the banana before mashing them.  My sorbet was not brown at all!

Sometimes, I really should look at the reviews 1st. But alas, I normally don't the 1st time out. The recipe seemed pretty easy with the 1:1:1 ratio and I totally needed to use up 4 cups of bananas. Following the recipe to a T with the correct ratio being multiplied to a 4:4:4 ratio, I was disappointed. It was way way to sugary. It was like frozen syrup even after waiting over 12 hours to scoop and serve. The sugar needs to be cut down to half to get the suttle flavor of the pure banana. As is, the recipe was so sweet it tasted like banana flavored Laffy Taffy....I'll try again with tweaks but won't be adding that much sugar again. Sorry for the poor review.

Well I decided to give the original ingredients a try since I do like extreme sweets.  I couldn't take the sweetness though - WAY too sweet in my opinion.  After I finished the recipe I pulled it out and added more water (1/2 cup) and mixed well.  I put it back in the freezer to set.  It still came out too sweet.  Maybe I will give it another try as others have by using less sugar.

Great recipe. I used 5 very ripe bananas then froze the mixture overnight. The next morning I added about 1/2 cup of peanut butter, mixed in the combination, then returned to the freezer. Very tasty flavor combination.

I made it yesterday and it was a bit too sweet. I wouldn't add so much sugar syrup, but the texture was awesome

The end product is delicious and It has a perfect texture and very sweet. My only suggestion is to use 2 more cups of water. Instead of white sugar I used brown sugar which is still very delicious.

I have made this it tastes great and looks quiet nice. I did add some yellow food coloring after reading the reviews.The size and ripeness of the banana would have a lot to do with it turning brown I used older bananas so I had no problem with the end product.

I had very ripe bananas and didn't want to make banana bread again. I have never made sorbet before and was surprised at how easy it was. My kids love this. My only thought is that the recipe is overly sweet. Next time I will add less sugar and a few tablespoons of lemon juice to liven it up. I have a feeling this will be a regular in our house!
