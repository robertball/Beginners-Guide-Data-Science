I enjoyed this potato salad.  Everyone was trying to figure out the ingrediants because it does have an original taste to it.  It makes people wonder and it's funny to watch their expressions as they notice there is something special and different about this potato salad.  I didn't give it a 5 because while delicious it was not restaurant material, but for home and for anyone that loves potato salad, I do recommend this salad.  I don't think it's for everyone, but everyone in my family did enjoy it.

this is really a wonderful recipe. our traditional family potato salad is basically the same- we just add small bits of fried bacon, green peppers and about a tablespoon of sweet chilli sauce- it makes a world of difference!

I cut the entire recipe in half and the sweetened condensed milk made it too sweet. However, the condensed milk is a nice twist in the recipe for a new flavor every now and then

A bit too sweet and too "soupy".  Using half of the sweetened condensed milk would take care of both of these problems.  I added some bacon bits; the salad needed a bit of salt anyway, which the bacon bits provided.

I would definitely use this recipe again. I added salt and pepper lightly to the potatoes, bell peppers and a twist: some marinated broccoli from a thanksgiving dish for crunch and fiber. A great marriage of flavors.

Ever since first trying this recipe it has been my go to potato salad. Everybody seems to really like it. I add black olives to the mix and it becomes a real treat.
