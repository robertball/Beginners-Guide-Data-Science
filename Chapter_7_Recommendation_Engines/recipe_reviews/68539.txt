We loved this so much, but made some changes as others did.  Added cumin, chili sauce, cilantro to the tomato mixture.  Salt and peppered the chops before browning, as well as added some cayenne.  Biggest change - partially cooked our brown rice before adding to casserole and cooking.  This recipe is a really great mexican variation (no carb loaded tortillas or taco shells!).  We will be using it again and again.

I skipped browning the chops in a skillet and put them directly in the oven.  I think this keeps the chops from drying out.  After baking in the oven, the rice was still uncooked.  So after baking, I transferred everthing but the pork chops to a sauce pan with with a lid and simmered for about 10-15 minutes.  This cooked the rice.  Then, I put the rice mixture back on the pork chops for serving.  It was very yummy.  Next time, I will simmer the rice mixture on the stove first for about 15 minutes, and then, bake in the oven.

Great idea! Like everyone else, I used what I had on-hand - frozen corn, black beans, canned tomatos, and Minute Rice (by the way, this reduced the cooking time immensely!) Added cumin and chili powder and added a can of chicken broth for more liquid.  Served it with cheese quesadillas - a fast and very easy weekday meal.  I ended up with too much tomato/bean/rice/corn mixture, so I froze some for the next time - which will make it even that much faster!  Thanks for a great idea!

We had this tonight and it was really good.  I marinated 6 chops overnight with a rubdown of oil and half a packet of our favortie taco seasoning before browning.  I also used a box of Rice a Roni Spanish Rice, because that was all I had on hand and it worked out fine.  I added the remaining half of the taco seasoning and Rice a Roni packet to the tomato/rice mixture while simmering. I served with a tossed salad and cheese quesadillas(thanks to the poster who suggested that - was the perfect addition to this meal). I got many compliments from the family and this was super easy.  Thank the Lord because anyone who's ever had a six month old to take care of knows about needing easy dinner solutions!!!  Thanks for the post I will make this many more times - we really enjoyed it.

I added comments from other folks and made some changes of my own.  Here is the adjustment: Rub both sides of the pork chops with Taco Seasoning and let it sit in a couple of tablespoons of oil for a few hours.  Salt and pepper pork chops and brown them in a little oil.  Cut up the pork chops into bite size pieces.  Make rice in rice cooker. Mix together the cut up pork chops with 1 can of the following in skillet diced tomatoes, corn, kidney beans, green chili.  Add a generous 1/2 teaspoon of the following seasonings: cumin, cayenne, garlic powder and Tabasco sauce, plus 1 teaspoon of chili powder. Cook in skillet on medium /medium low heat for about 25 min., making sure the pork is cooked.  Get out the pancake griddle (or big skillet).  Spray it with Pam or put a little oil/butter on it.  Place small size flour tortillas on griddle to warm.  While warming on the griddle, top the tortilla with the vegetable/meat mixture, salsa, sour cream, grated cheese. Other ingredients might include black olives, tomatoes, & onion. Serve with the rice as a side dish or add the rice inside the tortilla. Fold the tortilla around the filling and eat. Great with Dos Equis beer.  We all had second helpings.

Both my husband and I really enjoyed this!   I added 1 t. cumin, 1 t. chili powder, 1 t. chipotle chili powder, and it was wonderful (also added 4 chopped green onions)!  Served with cheese quesadillas on the side... yummy! Edited to add:  I made this recipe again, this time adding a little more rice, a scant 3/4 cup, and it was even better!  With just the 1/2 cup, the rice got a little lost in the mix.

Good recipe but it definitively needs spices. I added 1/2 tsp each of chili powder, garlic, cumin and coriander I also sauteed 1 medium sliced onion with the chops. Will definitely make again.

ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS!!  Substituting what I had on hand (1 can tomatoes with jalapenos, frozen Mexican-style corn with black beans & onions & green peppers, black beans) and using other reviewers' opinions (adding 1/4 c more rice, topping chops with cheese, added cumin), this has got to be one of my best meals.  Everyone loved it including my mega-finicky 6-yr-old.  I also Mrs. Dash'd the chops when browning them; they tasted great and were so tender.  I also let the tomato mixture simmer on the stove for about 10 minutes to give the rice a head start.  Turned out to be a good idea.  Pork is not a major part of our diet, but this will be the way I fix it from now on.  Mexican cooking is so versatile so I can't wait to try this with chicken and beef.

This is such a good recipe! I used diced tomatoes with chiles and cilantro and stewed tomatoes. I also added a little taco seasoning to the chops before I browned them. The chops were so moist. The leftovers are also awesome, I cut the leftover chops into strips and put everything in a tortilla shell. This one will be on our menu for good.
Thanks for the recipe!

I found that the rice mixture was alot, enough for 6 servings. It also needed kick, cumin or chili powder needed, as other reviewers have said. It's not a bad recipe though....

Very easy and good base recipe, but definitely needs a few changes to get to 5 star.  Chops are very tender using this cooking method.  I strongly suggest the following changes: -Season chops with seasoned salt and dip in flower before frying in oil -Add cumin, cayenne, crushed red pepper, fresh cilantro, and sliced green onions to the rice mix -Double rice to 1 cup -bake right in the skillet, no need to dirty a baking dish  I would also recommend: -Swap black beans for kidney beans -Add chopped jalapeno peppers

Like some others, I made it easier by rubbing the chops with mexican dry rub and putting straight into the baking dish. Also, I didn't heat everything before rather mixed it all together, dumped it in the casserole and plopped the chops on top. So easy! Changed a few things per what I had on deck like brown rice, pinto beans and added some black olives. Really delicious and a little healthier!

Spice up the pork chops with S&P, garlic powder and chili powder before frying.  Added chili powder and cayenne pepper to rice mixture.  Used brown rice, which I cooked frist. Topped with cheese.  Turned out great, really enjoyed it. 4.5

These were easy and delicious.  We liked them even better with cheese sprinkled on top., but by themselves was good too.  The only real change I made was to put the chops on the bottom of the dish and the tomato mixture on top, I thought this would help the pork to not dry out.

Next time I might add some Mexican style spices or just taco seasoning.  Also, I think this recipe could be pretty easily adapted to a slow cooker recipe.

Delicious! The chops churned out very moist. I did use tomatoes that came with some chili spices and added black beans. My boyfriend is picky about tomatoes and veggies and he loved it!

I fixed the recipe as written and I have to say it wasn't that good. I loved how the pork chops turned out, they were very moist. The rice mixure however was just okay. I'm not sure If I will make this again. Thanks for the recipe though. :)

So I don't usually stray too much from the recipe in front of me but I was looking for a way to use pork in say, a taco or quesadilla. Here's what I did: I took 4 boneless pork chops and cubed into 1/2-1 inch pieces. Browned these slightly on the stove then added 1 can petite diced tomatoes, 1 can diced chiles, 1/2 large browned onion, 1 teaspoons minced garlic, 1 can drained/rinsed black beans, 1 teaspoon cumin and 1 pkg success white rice (out of the bag, of course!) and cooked until the rice was done. I added about a cup of water total as it was cooking as well. SOO good.

I also followed the advice of others and spiced up the dish with some ancho chili powder, cumin, garlic powder, salt & pepper. I sprinkled this on the chops as well before browing. This is a quick easy and also very versatile dish. You could make many additions or subtractions depending on what you do or don't like. 
It's just my husband and I so we had plenty left over for another meal. I cut up the pork chops and mixed it with the rice then I put some shredded taco cheese on a flour tortilla and spread it with the rice and pork. It was even better the second time. 
We WILL be making this AGAIN. Thanks.

Turned out yummy - made a few changes to spice it up a bit:  used chili beans instead of kidney beans, added garlic, cumin and ground black pepper.  Since we prefer frozen veggies when possible, frozen corn worked great.   Used soaked brown rice instead of white rice, just cooked it a bit longer first.  Will be making this again!

This was just OK for us. It was a change from my usual creamy mushroom soup/onion/white wine sauce I usually make with pork chops.

Yummy! Okay now, I made a lot of changes because I didn't have the required items on hand. But, it worked and was dynamite! Here's what I did: I only had a box of Goya Black Beans and Rice so I added to that, 1 drained can of kidney beans, one can of creamed corn (yes, creamed! All I had), and one can of Rotel tomatoes with chiles. I added two cups of water (as suggested on box of rice, and brought to a boil on the stove. I then added 6 pork chops that I seasoned with cumin and garlic salt. Covered and baked for one hour. Easy peasy and delish!!!!! Oh, I also added mexican cheese blend and sour cream on the top of the rice when I served it...

This is nothing but a plain old pork chop! However, the rest of the dish is a nice flavorful concoction if you use Rotel Original(or Extra Hot) Tomatoes for one of the cans of tomatoes. The 2nd time I made this I used a Tex-Mex rub on the pork chops, used minute rice instead of regular and cooked everything covered for 40 minutes. That was much better. The pork chops were juicy and much tastier.

Good starting point but it needed a few tweaks to get it how we like it. First I used Adobo seasoning instead of salt, and also added some ground cumin. The canned chillis really didn't provide much of a kick so I threw in a couple of finely diced jalapenos too. Shame I didn't have any cilantro. I cooked it on the stove top so I could keep an eye on the rice. Not bad at all. Thanks!

DELICIOSO!!  I hesitated a little before making this dish because, frankly, the ingredients just didn't sound good together!  After reading the reviews, I decided to try it.  Several of you had suggested substituting ROTEL and adding taco seasoning to the pork chops.  Wonderful idea!  I love rice so I also added 1 cup instead of 1/2 cup and simmered it on the stove instead of baking. I did not have beans so I didn't worry about that.  I bet the leftovers tomorrow will be even better.  THANKS A BUNCH!

My husband and I really enjoyed this meal. The pork chops were nice and juicy and the beans made it very filling. Great reheated the next day too.

yum! used black beans, added curry, cumin and 1 jalapeno pepper for heat. used brown rice, cooked on the stove then added to casserole. also, i put the chops on the bottom of the dish and poured the rice mixture over it. i think this helped the chops stay moist. will definitely make this again. the whole family loved it.

I tried this recipe last night, when my parents came over, everyone loved it,It does make alot so you may want to adjust measurements.  I browned the chops about 12 mins. either side, with salt & pepper. And I  added a few things, I sauteed 3 cloves garlic,1onion. Added 2tbsp. cilanto, 2 tbsp. ground cumin. And used black beans instead of kidney. I have a toddler so I only used 1/2 can green chilies, she loved it. When I took it out I grated Asadero Mexican cheese on the rice mixture. Yummy, And made homemade corn tortillas with it. If you get a chance try this recipe, this will be a keeper at my house.

This is a great recipe, and a family favorite, we like it hot so we add a few fresh jalapanios and a touch of habanero sauce.

Very good

I had to come back & find this recipe again! I added some fresh cilantro, used taco seasoning, did not brown my pork & served in small flour shells slightly browned in oil. It was such a hit! It tasted GREAT!~

Just made this for dinner!  It was great!  I seasoned the chops with Paula Deens House seasoning and seared on each side.  Cooked the rice 3/4 was through before adding it to the rest of the mix.  Also used rotel instead of stewed tomatoes and green chillies.  Will make again soon!  Thanks!

The porks chops were pointless in this recipes.  Very bland, dry.  The rice mix was pretty good, but definitely not worth making again.

We love it. I did not drain the oil, I sauted the rice until golden brown (as if making spanish rice) then added the rest. I did drain the beans but not the corn, and green chillies, added some flavor.

I tried many of the tips found in other reviews.  I think this was the best.

I didn't brown the pork chops-instead I seasoned them with adobo, chili powder, smoked paprika, Mrs. Dash, and pepper.  They were tender and flavorful.

I added quinoa instead of rice.  I really like the addition of the nuttier flavor.

I also added recaito-cilantro cooking base.  It brought out the chilis and the tang in the tomatoes.

I cooked it covered the whole time.  This was really good.  I will be making it again and sharing with friends.

DH rating this dish a 5!!  I did what a few reviewers suggested.  Rubbed taco seasoning and smokey paprika onto pork chops then browned them.  I actually left them in the skillet, added everything else and just let simmer until pork was done.  One pot, less clean up!!  I used 1 can of rotel tomatoes and 1 can of black beans (did not drain).  Did not have a can of corn so used half a bag of frozen corn.  Seasoned with salt, placed the lid on and let simmer for about 8 to 10 minutes.  Added cooked rice (I keep some cooked up and frozen) right at the end....DELICIOUS!  Thank you for sharing!!

I made this recipe 2 nights ago and have since forwarded to everyone I can think of - my mom's making it tonight.  I took another reviewers suggestion and marinated the chops in a rub down of oil and 1/2 packet taco seasoning overnight and then used the other 1/2 packet of taco seasoning in the tomato mixture.  I had 6 pork chops so I used 3 cans of tomatoes - 2 cans mexican style stewed and 1 regular.  I also used 1 full cup of minute rice and added 1t. each cumin, cayenne and chili powder.  Looking forward to eating the leftovers tonight!!  I will try with chicken breast next time.  Thank you for an awesome and EASY recipe!

This was better than I anticipated - but I did make substitutions and adjustments to it. I substituted a 28oz can of diced tomatoes for stewed tomatoes. I did not have the chiles so I substituted an envelope of taco seasoning. I had six pork chops and used all of them. And also sprinkled grated mexican-style cheese as the previous reviewer suggested. It was great made this way. I am sure it is equally tasty made as the base recipe indicates.

A very good, hearty recipe.  I did not have stewed tomatoes so cooked 6 fresh, with some chopped onion, celery, orange pepper.

This is pretty good. The tomato mixture makes ALOT -- I would say it's enough for 8 chops! I used diced tomatoes with green chilis and cilantro (but I still added the can of chilis for more color), used pinquitos instead of kidney beans, and added taco seasoning to the tomato mixture in the skillet. The chops really didn't have any flavor, but the tomato/rice mixture was delicious. I will try it again, but cut down on the mixture ingredients (or else invite a houseful of people). Thank you, JValentine!

Best pork chop recipe ever.  The only change I made was that I made a rub for the chops consisting of; mexican oregano, smokey paprika, ground cumin, chili powder, garlic and onion powder and a little cayenne.  Rubbed the chops down and let them marinate for several hours.  Made the dish as suggested but added chopped onion and a little cilantro.  Outstanding!!!

As written I had uncooked rice and undone pork...so that would be a "no star", but after I transferred the rice mixture into a fry pan and added the pork chops on top it was amazing!  I doubled the recipe and used 8 thin sliced boneless chops.  I used about 1 1/2 c rice (again...I doubled) as suggested by previous reviewers.  I also did not have chilis, but did have Rotel so I used that instead.  I will absolutely be making this again, but I will not waste my time in the oven and instead just dump all ingredients together and place meat on top in a large fry pan on low/medium heat to simmer until done.  This was a GREAT starting point and I appreciate you sharing such wonderful ideas!  This will be a go-to.

I really enjoyed this, and I felt I was eating pretty healthy (even though it did all come from cans).  This would be great on a weeknight as it takes so little effort.  I did not read the reviews before making, otherwise I would have added some seasoning to the chops as I was browning them.  I definitely will reduce the cooking time by at least 10 min.  The chops, though tender, were too dry and so was the veggie rice mix.

Delicious!  I put fresh jalapenos into the rice and my husband loved it.

I omitted the last 10 minutes of uncovered cooking, and they came out juicy and moist.

This will certainly be a keeper.

I, too, liked this recipe and carefully read / modified based on reviews. Mine changes were:
1 14oz can of HOT Rotel Tomatoes.
1 14oz can of black beans
1Cup of long grain uncooked rice.
1 14oz. can yellow canned corn.
After browning the chops and bringing the veg's to boil I put them in a slow cooker on low for 4 hours.
Moist, tender, and wonderful.

With some of the recommended changes, this was very good. I only had 2 big chops, so I cut them into pieces and browned. Then I mixed corn, black beans instead of kidney, and a can of Rotel tomatoes and chilis. I also added about 1/4 cup taco seasoning and the rice, then simmered for a while. After browning chop pieces, I mixed everything together and baked 30 minutes. I served it in tortillas with cheese and FF sour cream - delish!

I enjoyed this more than I thought I would!  I did make a few changes right out of the gate... used recipe ready diced tomatoes rather than stewed, added half a can of black beans for color/variety, used frozen supersweet corn instead of canned, omitted the can of chilies, added about 1/2 c water when simmering the rice/bean/veg mixture, started the post-pork process by sauteing a diced vidalia onion (about 1.5 cups chopped) first, then adding the other stuff.  Added some cumin and chili powder, per previous reviewers.  I also simmered it for 5 minutes to make sure the rice (calrose) got a jump on cooking.  I know it sounds like a lot of modification, but it really wasn't.  My kids were mixed on the veg/bean stuff (2 of them hate canned tomato) but they ate it. all loved the MOIST pork!  I am always looking for ways to do pork and this one really worked!

Really liked this one.  I used black beans & brown rice and 1 can of Rotel tomatoes which added a little spice.  Pork chops a little dry but will try marinating next time.

Loved the recipe. I've tried it with black beans but there's something I liked better about kidney beans. Also, I marinated the chops in an Italian dressing, to which I like to add the 'juice' from a jar of hot peppers for some more kick. I also added some hot peppers to the mixture. Really a great, spicy dish!

Both my husband and I gave 5 stars to this recipe. This is easy and tastes great! I could not find a canned green chiles at my local deli, so used a canned chiles chipotole instead. I used 3 pieces and two tea spoons of sauce which add this dish just right spiciness. I added a little pinch of cumin for some smoky flavour. I am sure I will make this again.

This is really good!!  My husband loved it.  I did make some changes, though: used brown rice and cooked it on the stovetop with chicken broth for about 30 minutes before mixing into the other ingredients; used black beans, not kidney; used 1-1/2 can chopped tomatoes and 3/4 can Rotel.  Thanks for a great recipe JVALENTINE101.

Not the most amazing dish I've ever made, but good enough to make it into my occasional rotation.  I added cumin & chile powder.  I used frozen corn instead of canned.

Fantastic recipe.  Substituted chicken, which was a little disappointing.  I may marinade the meat next time.

The rice mixture was full of flavor.  I added cumin and chili powder for a little more kick.

Served with cornbread and a cold drink, this will be served again.

Yummy!  We liked this.  I did change it slightly - didn't have kidney beans, so used black beans instead.  Also used brown rice.  Added a bit extra water, and cooked  about an hour.

OH MY GOSH! loved it.  My husband is a very picky eater.  He loved it!  Even my kids ate it up.  I think this would be good if you replace the pork with chicken.

I thought this was a good recipe,my husband liked it alot.  I added some cuman, chili powder and cilantro to add some extra flavor and some shredded cheese on top.  We served it with tortilla chips and sour cream.  Yum  I also to had to cook it for about 45 minutes to get the rice done, but it was still not as soft as it could be.  But good recipe I will make it again.  Thanks

This was quite good, but did make a few changes. I used salsa instead of tomatoes to add a bit of zip. I salted and peppered the chops in the pan and added sliced onions. I didn't have chilies so added chili powder and about 1/2 cup of water. I found that it took about 45 minutes with the lid on for the rice to get soft. We all enjoyed it and will likely have it again. Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe was okay. It wasn't very tasty though. Even after I added pepper, cilantro, & garlic. I suggest browing the pork chops longer than 5 minutes! I will make more changes when I try this recipe again.

This is what I did. The chops were browned as in the recipe, I used a tin of chilli's in adobe sauce and navy beans as that's all I had. I also added chopped peppers and a couple of apples because I had some that were bruised that my kids were refusing to eat.

I won't brown the chops again as they were quite dry, I will use the tinned chilli's in adobe sauce and the navy beans, they seemed to work really well, the apples were quite good too. I did clean and soak my rice, that makes it cook way quicker, I'll make sure I do that again too.

We will be using this again, thank you for sharing it.

This was delish!  I did not brown chop as someone reccommended, and added 1/4 cup rice (another suggestion).  I added chili powder, ommitted chilis.  Pork was so tender, a definate keeper!.

I agree with the reviewer that said the pork chops themselves didn't have much flavor. Maybe they should be on the bottom of the pan instead of on top or when browning in pan add more spices (cumin?) then. I also used black beans instead of kidney beans.

I had 6 bone-in pork chops that I seasoned with taco seasoning mix,salt and garlic powder. After browning chops and removing, I browned rice for a bit. Then added only one can diced tomatos, 8 oz. drained canned corn, 11 oz. can pork and beans(gave it a sweet taste I liked)and the rest of the taco seasoning packet.After bringing to a boil, I turned it to low, put pork chops on top and covered. Simmered for 35 min. on stove top. This was great! Hubby loved it and he doesn't like rice. Adding chunky applesauce to the pork chops really brought out their seasoning. This makes much more of the rice part than you would think-serves at least 6.

I too, think this probably would have been better in the slow cooker adding the rice an hour before it was done. I just don't think the pork was very flavorful. I would also add either more chilies or maybe jalepenos to the mix too!

Made this for my husband and he loved it!!  He is picky about which recipes he gives two thumbs up too, but he couldn't get enough of this.  The pork comes out so tender and the flavors are awesome.  I didn't use the beans as I didn't have any, but it was still excellent.  I'll be making this a couple times a month.  Thank you!!

Everybody liked this. I did sprinkle taco seasoning on both sides of the pork chops before browning them, and added the rest of the packet to the rice mixture. Next time that I make this I'll use some more individual seasonings, because I felt that even with the taco seasoning it was a little bland.

These were so good and a nice change for pork!! I made a few changes. I did what Jan had submitted: Rub both sides of the pork with taco seasoning and added 1/2 tsp of each... cumin, cayenne, garlic powder, and tabasco sauce. And 1 tsp of chili powder. I thought this gave it lots of flavor!  I also just made a pack of Mexican rice and did a can of Rotel insead of the cans of tomatoes and peppers, and I did a can of Black Beans. Very yummy! I will make this again!!!

Excellent recipe. Like others, I made some changes: rubbed 1/2 packet taco seasoning on chops and drizzled with hot chili oil and let marinade 2 hours (gave good spice). Cooked brown rice half way first, subbed black beans for kidney, frozen corn for canned, and didn't have chilis, so used 1/2 an onion and one whole green pepper, minced. Mixed remaining taco seasoning in with rice mixture. Only used 1/2 can diced tomatoes (don't really like tomatoes). Next time will double the amount of rice. My husband REALLY liked it, definitely a keeper. Could be good as vegetarian, just take out the pork - the rice mix was great alone.

This was really tasty if you take the suggestions of others and add some extras.  I rubbed the pork with fajita seasoning and chili oil and then let it sit for a few hours.  I used black beans instead of kidney, added some chili powder and cumin and topped it with a Mexican cheese blend.  Everyone loved it!

I made this for the first time last night and it was really good!  I used "hot" chili beans instead of kidney beans which made it just a little spicy.  A little of the topping mixture was leftover and it was great reheated for lunch.  Only thing I will change when I make it again is I will cook the topping mixture a bit longer because I did not think the rice was cooked quite enough.

This was a very good meal.  The pork chops were very moist.  I will include more rice in the recipe the next time I make it as the two cans of tomatoes (which I have to puree for a very picky eater in my house) made it almost a little TOO tomatoey.  I added shredded cheese on top when serving.

The pork chops turned out okay. I used brown rice in the recipe & had to take the chops out to allow the rice to cook longer. Had I left the chops in the oven they would have turned into pork jerky. I just wasn't too impressed with this one.

We loved this recipe, although we would have added more peppers to make it more spicy. I used spanish rice and mixed it up 24 hours ahead of time and just put it in the fridge.  Baked it the next night and it came out great.

I used chops w/bones because that's what I had on hand.  I added a half pkg of taco seasoning as well as a bit of cumin, pepper and onion flakes.  I liked the extra kick.  One caution:  my rice was a little underdone.  Next time, I'll give it another 10 minutes to bake.

It was ok.  I didn't o eat it so we ahave long grain rice so I had to use regular rice.  It took an additional 10 minutes, but it still came out pretty good.  we ate it with tortillas.  Almost everyone liked it, but we'll probably make it again.  This time with long grain rice and more spice.

Pretty bland and unremarkable.  Next time I'll add Fiesta corn, some spices, and Jalapenos.  Less tomato would help, too.

This dish is beautiful, colorful but something was lacking and I'm not sure what. My husband, who is not a picky eater, ate it good. However, when I asked him to eat the leftovers he didn't want to.  It's good, but not GREAT.

This recipe was quite good...  the only thing that I would change for next time is to reduce the amount of tomato by 1/2 a can. My boyriend really liked this recipe, and I will make it again.

This was pretty good. I used two cans of diced tomatoes, frozen corn (thawed), and two 14-ounce cans of beans (one of kidney and one of black). I added a little extra rice plus some water to make up for the extra rice. This took a LOT longer to cook, closer to 90 minutes. That may have been my fault (the extra rice and beans!), but I DID add extra water. My husband wasn't thrilled with it but I enjoyed it. I might try it with kielbasa to see if he likes it better. Thanks, JV, for a different pork chop recipe. :)

I left out the beans, which are not a favorite in my house. This was good, but the pork chops were a little bland. Next time I will marinate the chops before cooking, but I will make it again, especially considering the lack of leftovers.

My husband and I both love this recipe.  I of course had to "kick it up a notch" by adding chili seasoning to the pork as I cooked it and adding hot chili sauce to the mixture before putting into the oven.  I also found the Cheddar Jack cheese is the perfect topping. (maybe that is to counteract the hot chili sauce)

Good.  But rather plain, most likely because I made w/out chilis and used canned, peeled tomotoes rather than stewed.  Well, that's what I had in the pantry... The chops were VERY tender.  I did add a teaspoon of dried coriander- not even detectable.

Good recipe for one in a hurry.  I used black beans instead of kidney beans as I like them better.  I also tossed in a bit of chili powder and a splash of red wine.  This is a great weeknight dinner, especially if you keep all the ingredients on hand.  Thanks!

I made this from start to finish in a skillet on the stove top.  Very good. I had everything on hand except kidney beans so I used black beans. That doesn't alter the basic recipe so I think 5 stars is appropriate! If you like really spicy food, add some crushed red pepper flakes or a dash of cayenne. Doesn't affect the flavor and adds a delicious kick to the dish. Thank you for sharing.

FANTASTIC!!  Made this last night and is was a super hit.  All I added was some chili powder.  Will definitely make this again and probably the next time the kids come for a visit.  Thank you for sharing this treasure.

Good, easy and filling.  Lot of room for personalization.  I used thick boneless chops and 5 minutes on a side before baking was too much.  Next time I'll do a minute or two on each side.  Thanks for the recipe.

It was so good! I didn't have to add anything to the recipe. My husband ate it up!

Awesome recipe added black beans instead of red put tamed jalapenos in and Mexican blend cheese will definitely make this again.

My husband and I love this recipe! I made slight changes. In addition to the original veggies, I added black beans.  I used diced tomatoes instead of stewed (a salsa style tomato). I also diced the pork and sprinkled it with some spices; paprika, coriander or cilantro (whatever is available), garlic, cumin, onion powder, coarse sea salt, seasoning salt and red pepper then browned it in a skillet. I don't usually measure. I add things and taste it to see how it is. I would guess that I used about a teaspoon of each spice. I added a layer of cheddar cheese over the mixture and threw it in the oven as directed. This is a great recipe idea. Thank you for sharing it!

I liked it but my family did not.  They are not a fan of Mexican anyway and I was trying to convert them.  I added on my plate some sour cream and also covered it with Tortilla Strips from fresh gourmet which added some crunch.

Have made this several times, but will make with my changes & others suggestions for the best flavor. I brown the pork chops with taco seasoning sprinkled on both sides, also I add 1/8 tsp cumin & oregano with the tomatoes, corn etc. I use Mexican stew tomatoes instead of plain stewed & a whole can of diced green chilies. I've baked this dish and put in the crock pot & both work fine. The last few minutes I top with some cheese.

I'm so glad I tried this recipe.  I thought it sounded like a lot of work but it really wasn't and it is just delicious!  I did it with both pork and chicken and enjoyed the chicken more (just a personal preference).  I added a bit of cumin and oregano but only used about half the can of green chilies and it was just right for my wimpy palate!

Very good. The rice and bean mix was a lot, and we ate it for lunch the next day.

I was somewhat disappointed with this in that the tomato mixture was a little too runny and I would have liked more spice. Having said that, the flavor was very nice and my family devoured it. I will definitely make this again and maybe double the chilis.
