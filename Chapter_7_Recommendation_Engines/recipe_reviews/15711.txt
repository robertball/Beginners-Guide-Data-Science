Awesome recipe concept! If you have a tough time finding canned TART cherries (or worse yet, fresh, which only seem to be in season on or about June 17 each year, for about an hour and 13 minutes - what? You missed it?!) this is perfect! Cherry pie is my husband's favorite, and so I'm stocking the freezer with cranberries while they're in season. For a more authentic cherry pie taste, I skipped the vanilla and used 1/2 tsp almond extract, plus 1 Tb fresh lemon juice. This gives it a great tart kick, which is what DH loves about cherry pie. I also used 2/3 Splenda and 1/3 white sugar in place of all sugar, which is now standard practice for me when making any pie. No one is any the wiser, but it allows the diabetics in the bunch to partake without guilt, plus everyone is happier to have skipped the carbs. Thank you for posting this recipe, which will no doubt be requested on every major holiday in this house, until I reach the end of my pie-baking days.

Surprisingly good!
I don't like cranberries OR rasins (I made the pie for my mom) but I tried a slice anyway and was quite pleased.  It really DOES taste like a cherry pie.  It will be making further apearances at family functions.

This recipe is incredible! I took the advice of another reviewer and skipped the vanilla replacing it with 1/2 tsp almond extract plus 1 Tbsp fresh lemon juice. It tastes so much like cherry pie that no one could guess that it wasn't! The ONLY giveaway is the texture. You can tell there are raisins in there. But it's so yummy. I will definitely make this again.

I made the filling from this recipe and used it between two layers of banana oatmeal cookie cake (just a weird personal invention), and it was delicious! I used a can of Thanksgiving cranberries and substituted Craisins for raisins, and the filling was sweet and tangy... and it really does taste like cherries!

This recipe turned out great, very similar to the one I had years ago.  I added 1/2 cup of walnuts per request of my husband.  I tried it with vanilla and then again with almond extract and lemon juice as one review suggested and I like the almond extract with lemon juice better.  Thanks so much for this recipe it is a big hit!

I love cranberries, so it's no surprise that I enjoyed this pie.  I made it for a crowd, and it was very well-received, even by those only marginally interested in cranberries, including those who turn their noses up at raisins.  The tartness of the cranberries mellows out with the first cooking of the berries and makes for a pleasant fruity pie.  It makes a great autumn pie, perfectly appropriate for Thanksgiving dinner, but I plan on making it year-round!

Wonderful!  Really tastes like cherries!  I followed tips from other reviewers and added lemon juice and almond extract instead of vanilla...great!  Hubby said it could be tarter for his taste, so next time, I'm upping the cranberries by 1/4 c to1/2 c and cutting the raisins by the same ratio.  Oh, when I made the filling per directions, I found it a bit too runny, so made a slurry with 1 Tbs. cornstarch and 1/2 tbs. water, stirred it into the filling and cooked to boiling to thicken...came out perfect after pie was cooked.  Tip:  I used the Buttery, Flakey pie crust recipe from this website...that crust is DA BOMB!  I'm adding this pie to my holiday dessert list!

Call this Cranberry-Raisin Pie and you'll get alot more people trying it! We're a family of cranberry fans, and my whole family was delighted with this pie and its sweet/tart mixture....quite unique!  Great with a dab of cream or vanilla ice cream!

These were good...very sweet with all those raisins and all that sugar (and I even reduced sugar to 1 c).  I personally didn't find this overly convincing as a cherry pie, although the almond extract did help in that department.  A very good and simple filling to use when in a pinch.  Thanks!
