I had a head of cauliflower waiting to be Cooked so I made this soup on a cold, damp, rainy day. I used onion in stead of leeks, replaced the chicken broth with vegetable broth and used herbs are instead of marjoram because that is what I had readily available in the house at the time. It was excellent. I am defiantly making this soup again! Next time I will plan it and have all ingredients available.

Added another clove of garlic and a little more leek.  Took it to my Mother who resides in a Nursing Home and she gobbled it down and wanted more.   Only complaint she had was a little bit of leek shreds;should have blenderized it for her. :)

I followed the recipe, but substituted a couple of yukon gold potatoes for 1/2 of the cauliflower.  It was great!  Roasting the garlic and cauliflower gives a depth of flavor that would otherwise not exist.  The leeks give a subtle  flavor that complements the roasted veggies.  Will definitely make it again!

SO good. Had no leeks so I used a chopped onion I already had. Used extra garlic (because you can never have too much IMO), added chopped up carrots, and Cavender's Greek seasoning, and used thyme in place of the marjoram. During the last 10 minutes I added about a half cup of half n half. Also sprinkled shredded Parmesan cheese as a garnish. WILL be making again!

Delicious recipe without any changes. If you want to indulge a bit, add 1/4 cup half and half for a creamy taste. Otherwise skip the extra calories:-)

Delicious!  The only change I made was to add some chopped carrots to the celery and leeks!  An added plus is that it is so low in fat and calories.  Thanks for sharing a great recipe!

I've made different cream of cauliflower soups and I like this one.  I didn't have leeks so I saut√©ed onions and celery with the butter.  I did add a little 1/2 and 1/2 to the end but it was already creamy.  I didn't have marjoram so I added thyme.  I'll make it again.  Thanks!

I did not like this soup.  Very boring even after I added some garam marsala, more salt & pepper etc for spices.  It was also very thick so I had to add some extra broth which didn't help it much.  I'll look for another recipe as I love soups & I love cauliflower.  Try, try again ;)

Delicious! I followed another reviewer's recommendation to add some chopped bacon as a garnish, and so used the bacon fat to saute the veggies. The roasted cauliflower and garlic really made the dish special. Next time, I think I'll only blend half of the soup so there are chunks of veggie. Thanks for sharing!

Delicious!  Added my own spices and left it chunky.  I like a creamier soup so I added the flour as suggested and did add a scant 1/4 of half and half.  It was AMAZING!!!!  Perfect for the first freezing day in Chicago!

This is phenomenal! The only changes I made were to add a sweet onion and sautee it with the celery in bacon grease..a staple that I always have in my fridge. It adds so much depth and flavor to just about anything.

Not much taste.  I added some chicken and potato to make it heartier.  It's a bit blah.

Perfect soup. The roasted cauliflower and garlic with the leek and celery was spot on. I made it as written but omitted the marjoram and added a pinch of nutmeg. I always like nutmeg with cauliflower. I will be making this very often.

Really easy soup to make. Very tasty. Definitely will need more salt and pepper when it's completely done. If you want a completely blended texture to where is smooth, instead of using an immersion blender, I just put it in a blender and it turned out great. Add some rosemary for a more herby taste. I made this for myself, since I just got my wisdom teeth out. Super tasty and easy. Will definitely make it again.

This turned out great!  I used minced garlic instead of fresh, coconut oil (warmed in my little oven to make it liquid) instead of olive oil on the cauliflower, and gluten free baking flour.  I put everything in my Vitamix after to blend it, just be careful not to make it foamy with the vitamix.

Loved this soup! We just did a quick run-through with the immersion blender, to leave some chunks of roasted cauliflower.

Made a double batch of this to stick in the freezer. Have a new baby on the way and my son loves soup. It's a great way to hide some really good veggies for the hubby too. Looking forward to pulling some out of the freezer for lunches and suppers once new baby arrives. Great recipe. Will defiantly make again and share with everyone!

This is the best Cauliflower soup I have ever made. I used Bob's Red Mill gluten free all purpose baking mix instead of flour, and added two extra garlic cloves, otherwise made as noted. This will be my go to method from now on, thanks so much for sharing.

This was yummy and very satisfying.  I'm glad to find such a rich, creamy soup with no dairy products in it.  I am just checking out the ingredients list to make it again.

This was a very tasty soup. I had cauliflower leftover from another recipe. Personally, I'm not a fan of the texture of cauliflower so this soup was perfect. Very nice and flavorful. We did a light drizzle of white truffle oil on the top as well. Fantastic way to eat cauliflower.

What a great soup! I used 3 Tbsp. of olive oil, rather than 4. Also, I didn't have marjoram on hand so I substituted 1/2 tsp of sage, 1/2 tsp of thyme and 1/2 tsp of dried parsley flakes. I also used 4 cups of vegetable broth and pur√©ed in batches in my blender. Very satisfyingly recipe!

So delicious!! Cauliflower left over from not using for another recipe. Had as an appetizer before a roasted chicken and even my husband who doesn't love soup had seconds!! I did reduce the chicken broth to about 6 cups so not so watery.

Absolutely delicious.  I'd recommend reducing the amount of liquid to 5-6 cups instead of 8 otherwise the soup will be too watery.  Otherwise, delishe!

Roasted Cauliflower & Garlic!  how could you go wrong?  I didn't have leeks, but used 1/4 sweet onion and added a carrot to my stock veggies. Husband enjoyed it too!  Keeper!!!
