My husband gives this a 10!!  I took the advice of several other reviewers and decreased the amount of cornstarch (3 Tbls),sugar (1/2 C), and vinegar (1/8 C) in the sauce, but added 1 tsp of chili flakes instead of the peppers at the end.  Also, I cut out the deep frying, as we are trying to cut out the fat in our diets.  I just simply stir fried the chicken in a bit of vegetable oil and added the sauce and green onions.  We didn't even miss the heavy breading!  We served it over steamed rice and had some steamed snow peas to round out the meal.  I'll definitely be adding this figure friendly version of our favorite take-out to our regular menu!

I *JUST* finished eating dinner where i made this recipe, and i had to run upstairs to give my rave reviews. It was the best General Tsao's I've ever had; better than any restaurant - and this is my normal entree when i eat Chinese.

I would have to add,though, that I modified the recipe slightly. I cut up the chicken and marinated it in 1/2 cup each of soy sauce and hot sauce (Texas Pete) for 4-5 hours. I drained off the liquid before performing the chicken preparation portion of the recipe.

I substitued 3-4 Tbsp crushed red pepper for the peppers in the recipe, as the dried peppers are not available in my small town.

In the future, I would also probably increase the sauce by another half, just because I'd like the chicken a tiny bit saucier, and this sauce quantity was just enough to glaze the chicken.

Otherwise, I have to add this this recipe will now become part of my family's repertoire.

This is a great recipe, but if you want a couple of tweaks that make it much more "restaurant like" as well as little healthier , cut the corn starch in half for the sauce. And drop the MSG.

You will create a clearer sauce that won't leave a powdery feel on the upper pallet.  The MSG is simply over kill.  There is plenty of flavor enhancing going on with the sodium in the soy sauce.

Also for a nice decorative touch add a cup of shaved or thin diagonally sliced carrots.

Over all this a goooood  eats!

Great.  Cut down on cornstarch, used less than a 1/4 cup in sauce, and sauteed chicken instead of ddep frying, and used red pepper flakes instead of whole chile peppers.  Marvelous!

I have tryed many recipes for the past year trying to perfect this general Tsoas chicken and this is it. It taste just like from the buffet I like to go to.I did use less corn starch in the sauce. Ive made 11 pounds of chicken with this in 5 days and theres none left. I made it 3 times the 2nd and 3rd time i used 2 tablespoons of crushed red pepper instead of chiles and it was better. I will keep this recipe for ever.

If you cut down on the cornstarch in the marinade (2T was more than enough for me), and add some orange zest (about 1 T), I found that this was a delicious recipe.  I would probably go a little less on the sugar for my personal taste as well.  The other thing I did was delete the MSG with no adverse change in the flavor.

Love the recipe, but definitely had to cut down the cornstarch/add more liquid. I didn't use white wine vinegar, instead I just used regular white vinegar. Turned out great! I tried it twice already and the second one was waaaay better than the first since I know to cut down the cornstarch. And very important, for best results, make the sauce and fry the chicken separately. Pour the sauce over the chicken when it's ready to serve.

The chicken came out great. The sauce was extremely thick and took quite a bit of water to make it the correct consistency. Also found the sauce was much better after adding additional brown sugar and a bit of crushed red pepper. Also added streamed broccoli and green peppers.

We really liked this. Its my favorite food at Chinese places so I was excited to see this! The color wasn't quite right so I added a bit of ketchup to the sauce to make it red but that's only a preference. I think I overdid the cornstarch in the final step so it was seriously gelatinous. My fault! One thing I will change, though, is rather than using cornstarch to batter the chicken, I think I will use flour. I tasted a bit too much starchiness. Otherwise this was awesome!

What a wonderful dish!  Just like many of the other reviewers I believe it is quite close to what is available in restaurants, but the cornstarch was a bit much in the sauce.  I would say at most 1/4 cup cornstarch would make the recipe magnificent.  Until I get a chance to make the dish with the reduced cornstarch, the local chinese restaurant is still tops.

I live near a chinese restaurant that has been voted the best in my state for several years.  It's claim to fame is their General Tsao's chicken.  Clearly, this is where they got their recipe!  With some of the reviewer's modifications, it tastes identicle to theirs. The recommendations on this site that I used to to achieve this copycat recipe are as follows:   I cut the sugar to 2/3 cup.  I used only 2 tablespoons of cornstarch and for the liquid, I used all chicken broth   For the vinegar, I reduced the amount to 2 tablespoons and used rice wine vinegar.   The restaurant stir fries white onion to accompany the chicken (not the green kind) and for some strange reason, it works to catapult this dish into the stratosphere.

Made this last night and it turned out excellent. I followed advice from reviewers re cornstarch - tripled the recipe, but used 1/2 c. cornstarch. Had a little trouble with the chicken sticking to my fryer, didn't see any comments about this so it must be me. Also, next time I don't think I'll put soy sauce on the chicken/in the breading mixture - didn't care for the background flavor of fried soy. All in all, great recipe. Kids and husband loved it - will definitely make again. Thanks!

Very good recipe Shaun! I did play around with the amounts of the ingredients, but it turned out beautifully nonetheless, not to mention, very authentic tasting. I doubled my sauce, but have no clue on how much cornstarch I added. I just did what looked right. The availability of dried chile peppers certainly varies from state to state and store to store, so you never really know what you're going to get. I only found really large Mexican hot chile peppers, so I used two. I made the sauce and fried my chicken in the morning and threw it all together that evening. Again, you don't know what amount of heat you're getting, so I suggest starting out slowly because you can always add, but not take away. I found the sauce to not be not quite spicey enough, so I just added in some cayenne pepper. Superb and loved by my whole gang. Thanks a heap!

I'm really impressed with this recipe. I successfully halved it, and substituted red wine vinegar for white wine vineagar (as I didn't have any WWV), and subbed crushed red peppers and ground chili peppers for the whole chili peppers. I omitted the MSG. The only thing I would do differently next time is cut back on the amount of green onions by about 1/2 or a little more. Also, be warned that throughout the entire process you may be thinking "this is not going well"; it will be ok in the end!  :)

Rated as a 2 based on the recipe as written.  There is no way to achieve the sauce properly unless you modify it.  Instead of how the recipe is written, change to the following - for the sauce-
1.5 c. hot chicken broth, 1/2 c. soy sauce, 1/4 c. white vinegar, 1/4 c. white cooking wine.  I also eliminated the MSG.  For the chicken, decrease the soy sauce to 1/4 c.  That will solve the problem of the chicken tasting like fried soy.  If you follow other peoples suggestions on decreasing the amount of cornstarch in the sauce (which you would have to do to prepare this so it isn't a glob!!) you will not have enough sauce to cover your chicken well.  For the chicken, I put the cornstarch in a ziplock bag and then introduced the chicken, which made it simple to coat and eliminated the need for the extra oil.  With these changes, I found this recipe to be out of this world!

Its fairly close. The restauarant I order it from most makes it with a lot more sugar than this one, but over all its really good. You just have to be careful when adding the sauce to the cooked chicken- the sauce cooks suddenly.

I actually made this a healthy dish. I left off the chicken batter, I didn't fry the chicken and just soaked it in ginger and soy sauce and then sauteed it with the onion and peppers before adding the sauce.  The recipe called for a bit too much cornstarch.  I only used about a tablespoon.  The first time it came out like glue.  My suggestion:  add the cornstarch a little at a time while it cooks.  Also, use the small dried Japanese red peppers.  They are SUPER-hot!  WARNING:  Only use about 3 chopped up in the recipe.  Overall, a definate keeper!!

I am giving this 5 stars because the taste is some of the best general tsao's chicken we have tried. I followed some of the recommendations of cutting the cornstarch but I still didn't cut it enough. I can't wait to try it again!!

OK, but nothing like any General Tsao's chicken we've ever had anywhere else. Very bland in comparison. It's my son's favorite dish, and the leftovers went bad after languishing in the fridge for over a week. Since he's a big eater and loves to scarf up just about any leftovers, this said a lot. He sheepishly told me to just pitch it, that he wasn't interested in eating it. This was definitely not worth the mess to go through the deep fat frying. Considering the cost of the ingredients (especially the large amount of oil) it was a big disappointment. Sorry to say my advice on this one is to head to your nearest Chinese take-out and save yourself the time and mess of cleanup.

Great recipe, LOVED IT! I did as others suggested and halfed the cornstarch in the recipe. Also, next time so it's a bit crispier I plan to flour the chicken before putting it into the batter and make double the amount of sauce! I served it with a red bell pepper and it was delicious! :) I definitely recommend this recipe! *** update, i floured the chicken before putting it into th ebatter and it made it a lot crispier (SO GOOD!)******

I made this recipe for the first time a couple of years ago and it has been a favorite ever since.  While it's not exactly like the General Chicken I get at my local chinese restaurant, it is equally as good if not better.  I cannot imagine anyone not liking this.  It's really not difficult to make at all - just a little extra time to fry up the chicken.  As for ingredients, I've always cut the corn starch in half, omitted the msg, reduced the amt of chicken, and used 1 tsp crushed red pepper in place of the dried peppers.  Perfect every time!!

Great recipe!  I made a few modifications. I doubled the sauce and cooked in pot however only used 2 tsp ginger and 3 Tbsp cornstarch. I also used regular vinegar and no MSG.  I didn't coat the chicken but pan fried in canola oil.  Everyone loved it!

This is the best stuff!!! I didn't have the peppers so I used Red Pepper Flakes (which also allowed me to make my husbands spicier than the rest of the kids) It was also really easy.  It tasted just like the stuff you get from the restaurants - which is really good since we live in Germany!! Great Recipe!

this was great, although i did decrease the cornstarch and add more chicken broth. one thing to note, the longer you saute the dried chili peppers the spicier it gets!

I didn't follow this recipe exactly but I am still giving it a 5. I did not use the ginger (we hate the flavor) or the MSG (I refuse to buy that) but that is just personal preference. The chicken was to die for and I am already thinking up other ways that I can use this. I did it in my Fry Daddy and I couldn't ask for more perfect results. The sauce was great but the chicken was good enough to stand on its own without any sauce. Again, I am so impressed with the chicken preperation/results that it is difficult for me to rate the overall recipe. This was excellent and we both really enjoyed it. I plan on playing around with the chicken preparation with other meats and I look forward to my experiments!

I was a bit hesitant about making this recipe because of all the mixed reviews, but I decided to try it anyway. SO WORTH IT! Using the advice from other reviews I made the following changes: 1. I marinated the chicken for a couple hours in an asian toasted sesame marinade with a little bit of chili garlic sauce.                          2. I doubled the sauce, but only used 1/4 cup of cornstarch                   3. To make things a bit healthier, I sauteed the chicken in a little bit of oil rather than frying it.                                     4. I cooked the chicken and the sauce seperately and when they were both done I poured the sauce over the chicken and let it simmer for a couple of minutes. The recipe turned out really good, and everyone gobbled it down. Defintely making it again!

Rating as 3 stars right now. It's decent but not what I was hoping it would be. The batter for the chicken was a little odd and got soggy really fast. Everyone suggested reducing the amount of cornstarch in the sauce and I did but I found it to be too thin. Huh? I'm a little confused. I am making this in 2 batches. The first was a practice run before my hubby gets home tonight.  I might try to experiment with a different batter and not diluting the sauce. Will update. ***UPDATE***  Ok, I made this for my hubby when he got home and I made several changes and it was divine. 1. I changed the batter to a basic one, milk and egg dipped in flour.  2. I cut the vinegar in half and reduced the ginger to just 1 tsp. 3. Also in the sauce I added about 1/2-3/4 c water. 4. I cooked the sauce completely before putting the chicken in. I noticed the first time that it was completely soggy by the time the sauce thickened. Now I just fry the chicken and heat the sauce at the same time. By the time the chicken is cooked the sauce is too. Turn off the heat and quickly coat the chicken and serve.  Fabulous.  Giving 4 stars bc of all of the changes.

In the words of Rachael Ray, YUM-O! Per other reviewers, I made the following changes: doubled the sauce, using only 3T of cornstarch, and that was a little too much; used only 1/4 c white wine vinegar when doubling the recipe calls for 1/2 cup; omitted the MSG for health concerns; used only 1/2 cup of cornstarch for the chicken; used 1/2T of crushed red pepper flakes. My husband who does not like ANY spice, said this made it waaaay tooooo spicy, so next time I'll use less or just omit it. The recipe probably didn't need it anyway; it was so packed with flavor. Also, I didn't add any oil to help separate the chicken as stated in step 2; after all the work I'd done, I just flat out didn't feel like it LOL! I agree with another reviewer that it probably didn't NEED to be deep fried (as I did); it would cut A LOT of work, not to mention fat and calories by omitting the deep frying. I served this with Beef Egg Rolls (submitted by Trisha Caudill, this site) and House Fried Rice (submitted by Lynda, this site). All in all, this recipe was wonderfully tasty and better than the last serving I had at a restaurant because I KNOW what ingredients are going in to it. Thanks so much Shaun!

I followed the suggestions of other reviewers and replaced the 1/2 cup of cornstarch with 3 Tbsp and the 1 cup of cornstarch with 1/2 cup and I can't imagine how this recipe would have turned out had I used the amounts listed...it would have been terrible.  I also omitted the MSG because I don't cook with it and in the end, we didn't notice that it was gone.  The only other change I made was that I used about 1 Tbsp of dried chili flakes instead of whole chili's and it worked out just fine.  1 Tbsp makes this a VERY fiery dish....a little too fiery for my taste, so next time I make it (and there definitely will be a next time), I will reduce the amount of chili flakes to 1/2 Tbsp.  This is a really great dish...pretty close to our local take-out place.  Thanks for the great recipe Shaun!

Since I'm a vegetarian I prepared  just the sauce, using 1/2 the amount of cornstarch as suggested by other reviewers. I served it over extra firm tofu coated in cornstarch and fried. Absolutely delicious! I've made it 3 times in the past couple weeks. Even better than my local Chinese restaurant's General Tso's tofu. Thanks for the recipe.

General Tsao's chicken is one of hubby's favorite dishes but we can't find it in Tokyo.  I'm glad I found this recipe because it is as it is in restaurants.  I did cut down on the corn starch but found that the chicken is not crispy enough inside.  What I'll do next time is to marinade the chicken in everything except for the corn starch, and then coat the chicken in corn starch before frying.

I was a little nervous to try this after reading the negative reviews.  Don't make that mistake, I wish I would have made it sooner.  It was super yummy. I took the advice of using 1/4 cup of cornstarch in the sauce and I used red chili flakes instead of chili's.  Very tasty.  If you cook a lot you won't find it difficult OR messy!

Me and my fiance love this recipe! He has asked me to make it 3 times this month! I do believe it is important to weigh the chicken to make sure you have exactly the correct amount otherwise it changes the taste and texture.

EWW!!! My husband made this and followed the recipe exactly. It was awful. I ended up grilling hotdogs instead that night. It was quite late because it took forever to make. This tasted absolutely nothing like real Chinese.

Very tasty recipe.  I served it on rice and it was delicious, probably wouldn't recommended eating it straight-up, the garlic and ginger would get to you.  My tip for this recipe is to be sure to VERY finely chop the garlic and ginger since large pieces can overpower the taste.  All in all, a GREAT recipe!  I can't imagine anyone not liking this, unless they were adamently for bland foods!

Very yummy, but still not crispy enough :(. I used 3 T cornstarchfor the sauce and it was still too much. will try 2 T next time, and maybe some orange zest I think would go really well.

Just a word of caution: I do NOT recommend the use of MSG in anything. There have been terrible health issues from it. But the recipe was great otherwise. I reduced the starch and increased the liquid. Marinated the chicken in it over night then drained the marinade (sauce) off, baked it and added the sauce back in during last 15 minutes of baking. Trying to cut down on fried food. This turned out great. BUT NO MSG. My mom nearly died from it. And I know others who have strange and horrible reactions from it. Just a warning.

Could not be happier with this recipe.  Hubby and I gave up on ordering General's Chicken at our local Chinese restaurant because it was mainly breading and some pieces were so gristly you couldn't even chew them.  Looked up this recipe and gave it a try.  It was wonderful.  Like many reviewers, I used only 3 tbsp of cornstarch, 1/2 cup brown sugar, 1/8 cup vinegar and 1 1/2 tsp red pepper flakes for the sauce.  It turned out perfect.

This was just awesome. I've been looking for a recipe, as this is my favorite dish when eating out. I recently found a packet mix for the sauce, and was sorely disappointed. It was extremely salty and had an almost burnt flavor. This recipe is perfect. I took the advice of the other reviewers and cut the sauce corn starch in half, and had to substitute ground ginger for fresh. I also did not have any sherry, but the sauce came out perfect. I added some crushed red pepper to taste and I thought it was perfect. The initial sight of the chicken and even the end result worried me. It was so dark, compared to the light tempura batter look I see at restaurants. However, once covered in the sauce, it complimented perfectly and the overall flavor was perfect. Thank you!

I followed others' advice to go a little light on the corn starch, double the sauce and use crushed red pepper instead of chilis -- and it was fantastic!!! Definitely a big winner. I would advise using no more than 1 TBSP of the peppers though, the heat adds up quickly (and I like it hot).

I did not care for this. Too much sugar in the recipe. It made a brown, thick, sticky goo that was no where near GenTso chicken!  This made a roux that might be okay over lots and lots of steamed vegetables, but if you have your heart set on G/T chicken, better find another recipe.

Tasted like we were at a restaurant.  I broke my tasteless dinner streak with this recipe.  Was easy - prepared everything early afternoon and just popped it into wok at dinner time and was done!  So tasty I was giddy - we almost danced around the kitchen at my success!  Didn't use MSG, and reduced cornstarch as suggested by others.  A great way to reinspire me to keep trying - this one goes to the front of the recipe book!

I tried this one last night and this really worked well.  Like most other reviewers, I scaled way back on the cornstarch and I breaded the chicken with flour instead of cornstarch.  In addition, I microplaned some orange zest into the sauce mixture for a little extra flavor.  I served it with the "Fried Rice Restaurant Style" (also in Allrecipes) and we had a great meal!

This recipe was very good, my family devoured it and were begging from each other for more.  2 important things about this recipe, that I learned from the reviews are:  1. adding the cornstarch to the chicken is fine, but the cornstarch in the sauce mixture, you have to cut in half. 2. Cut down on the soy sauce and sugar.   I also didn't have any chili peppers so I added chile in the jar, turned ourt great.

This was fantastic!! I heeded advise from the many other people who tried this and cut way way down on the cornstarch. For the marinade I only used about a tablespoon of cornstarch. My family kept nibbling on the chicken before I even got to finish it. I did something in error but would recommend doing this: Put all the sauce ingredients into a saucepan and cook it! Again, used way less cornstarch and this way you can judge how thick or thin you want your sauce. Otherwise you may end up with gloop. It also took some of the rawness out of the ginger and garlic. Then just throw in the chicken and sauce and stir fry until hot. So easy.I will do this recipe again and again. My husband is so fussy and he even liked it!

Oh so good!!  Very labor-intensive, but worth it.  Definitely 1/2 the cornstarch whenever it calls for it.  Instead of deep frying, I just cooked in a very hot pan, constantly stirring.  The texture was a little different from traditional recipes, but we liked it (not a fan of deep frying if we can pan-fry instead)  I also halved the oil in the chicken mixture and turned out fine.  Thank you so much for this wonderful recipe!

Firstly, I took the tip to reduce cornstarch as the general consensus recommends, great advice!  However, I took another tip and marinated the chicken in soy sauce for several hours--won't be doing this again, it was too salty for my taste. With that said, this is a good recipe, which needs some tweaking.  I  plan to alter this a tad next time: 2 tablespoons soy sauce and 2 tablespoons Oyster Sauce for the sauce Will reduce the 1/2 cup soy sauce to 1/4 cup plus 1/4 cup chicken broth when combining with chicken.  Lastly, I recommend using the sundried chili peppers and stir fry as directed.  This lends the sauce a wonderful smoky taste & color.

I'm a little puzzled by the negative reviews. This is an excellent dish! I can never make enough, it seems. I can only suggest that those who didn't care for it may have inadvertantly strayed from the original recipe. I,too, cut the cornstarch as advised and added a bit more garlic. I'm making this dish at this very moment!

Been looking for a recipe for general tsao and I was NOT disappointed. I also used 2 TBS cornstarch in the sauce and used white vinegar instead of white wine vinegar. I also omitted the MSG and used plain black pepper as well as crushed red pepper. I did use fresh minced ginger and fresh minced garlic but didnt use onions at all.  WOW what a dish. We are avid eaters of Chinese food and EVERYONE raved about it. If you find this recipe unsatisfactory...  YOU must have done something wrong. THANK YOU  THANK YOU  THANK YOU

This dish was really good, but ONLY with a few important alterations. First of all, no more than 1/4 cup cornstarch in the sauce (you could probably use less). I halved the amount of chicken but still made the full amount of sauce. This was still barely enough sauce. I breaded the chicken in a more traditional way. I marinated it in the soy sauce/egg mixture, then dropped it in a bag of flour to coat it. I also used crushed red pepper flakes instead of the chile peppers and eliminated the MSG. I will certainley make this recipe again though.

I was searching for a General Tso's chicken recipe to make at home. I came across this one, and it seemed to have good reviews, so I thought "ok, this will work". 
I get the ingredients, am prepared for the about 2 hours time to properly make (not including clean up).
I followed the recipe EXACTLY, and it was AWFUL.
I don't know how anyone can like this recipe. It tasted nothing like general tso's at the chinese restaurant's here, and totally ruined my night.
I will never be making this one again, and maybe someday i'll try someone else's. Until then, I'll just buy it.

When I go to the mall, this is the number one item I see kids ordering from the Chinese place.  I too, order it whenever possible.  This recipe is the only one I've ever found that doesn't take unavailable ingredients or pans, and that tastes as good as, if not better than, what we get at a restaurant.  The trick is to wait for the cornstarch to gel up, and not add any in panic! :)

Excellent home version of one of my favorite restaurant meals. Last time I skipped the batter and deep frying, and just stirfried the chicken.  It still turned out well.

I am a chef and did not care for this recipe. In Step 1, I mixed the corn starch and water into a slurry and added to the wok after the chile and scallion and sauce ingredients. As for teh chix itself, the marinade is ok but I omitted the corn starch. I drained marinade from chix, toss in cornstarch, and then fried it. it comes out much crispier.

The flavors are spot on, however DO NOT use that much corn starch. The results are comical, yes, but not edible.

I give this recipe a 2 stars(a D grade for this major mistake) due to the fact you DON'T need monosodium glutamate (MSG) to make food tastier or better. Besides MSG causes health problems with many, and in my opinion, this neurotoxin will cause health problems even slightly in the longrun. Hey this is asian style cooking, and with all of the wonderful herbs, spices, and salt(or no salt), how can you not enjoy such foods without such things as sodium inosinate, sodium guanylate, manmade sweetner substitutes(there are some natural ones for those concerned...do the research), and MSG? Here's 1 of many leads http://www.msgtruth.org/

Recipe is pretty good, but folks are right on the money about it being too much cornstarch. I suspected that the amounts for cornstarch and water were reversed. So, I used 1/2 c. water and only 1/4 c. cornstarch. Turned out perfect. Will make again.

This recipe was excellent with some of the modifications from other reviewers.  I cut the cornstarch to 2 tablespoons in the sauce, and I put half cornstarch/half flour in a plastic bag and put a few pieces of the marinated chicken in at a time to coat.  Also used one tablespoon of crushed red peppers in place of the chili peppers.  Tasted just like a good Chinese restaurant's General Tsao's!  Family loved it and will definitely make again!

I'm sorry but I have to give this recipe 2 stars.All you can taste is cornstarch. My 2 children got all excited when I handed them their plates until they tasted it. My children are very good eaters and they strongly disliked this.I will not be making this again.

This is a great recipe! In the interest of time I used popcorn chicken instead of marinating and frying my own. Also in the interest of time I used 1 t crushed red chilis instead of the 16 sun dried chilie peppers the recipe called for. Next time I will start with 1/2 t , it had plenty of heat and was just a GREAT recipe. The chopped green onions also give it a pretty presentation

OMG! THIS RECIPE IS SUPERB WITH A FEW MINOR MODIFICATIONS. I TOOK THE ADVICE OF OTHER REVIEWERS AND USED LESS CORNSTARCH. 2TBSPS TO BE EXACT AND ADDED EXTRA IF NEEDED. I CHOSE TO LIGHTLY FLOUR MY CHICKEN BREAST PIECES INSTEAD OF USING CORN STARCH  AND I SEASONED THEM A BIT AS WELL MINUS THE SOY MARINADE.I RESERVED THE SOY USASAGE FOR THE SAUCE. I USED 1/4 CP WHITE SUGAR AND 1/4 CUP BROWN SUGAR INSTEAD OF A CP OF WHITE WHICH GAVE THE SAUCE A RICHER CONSISTENCY.I USED WHITE VINEGAR AND CRUSHED RED PEPPER FLAKES IN PLACE OF THE CHILLIES. MY FAM RAVED OVER THIS RECIPE. NOT TO TOOT MY OWN HORN BUT THEY EVERYONE USUALLY LOVE S MY COOKING LOL. THIS PUT AN EXTRA NOTCH ON MY COOKING BELT! THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THIS RECIPE. I WILL BE USING IT AGAIN! IF POSSIBLE CHECK OUT MY PLATE OF GEN. TSO ON MY PROFILE!

General tso's chicken at the chinese restaurant has a crispy batter slight crisp to it that keeps the sauce on the outside of the chicken without absorbing into the batter.  The problem with this recipe and ones like it, is that the chicken becomes soggy after you add the sauce.  If we can solve the soggy batter problem then this recipe would be restaurant quality.

I prefer this sauce sweeter and more tangy, so I'll add more sugar and vinegar next time. This recipe is a good starting point, though. The directions were very easy to follow.

I made this recipe for my best friend because she loves hot food and she was very impressed. The only thing with this recipe is I had to use a whole can of chicken broth and I kept adding water to it like a whole cup & a 1/2. But it was a very good recipe thank you!

This recipe was fantastic. I went ahead and used the full amount of cornstarch for the sauce, and I agree that it was probably too much. I had to add a good bit of water to it to thin it out some. I also used dried red pepper flakes instead of the whole chilies. But again, this is definitely going to be in my repertoire from now on. My husband was so impressed (he loves Chinese food)...he said he wanted to marry me again. :)

I was pretty impressed with this recipe.  It did look just like, or even better than, the restaurant version.  I did leave out the MSG and used half as much cornstarch as other reviewers suggested.  All of my children loved it.  The few leftovers lost a bit of their pizazz when reheated.

I thought this recipe was pretty good.  It had a sweet flavor to it, not really spicy.  I used regular salt instead of MSG and did not have ginger on hand.  I did not deep fry it, just pan fry. Other than that, I followed the recipe.  Very good, thanks!

This recipe called for so much cornstarch that even cut in half it made a jelly like sauce consistency. I had to add so much extra broth just to get this clumpy mixture to mix in the pan. I'll keep looking but will not make this one again.

Decreased cornstarch to 1/4 c, decreased sugar to 1/2 c, added slightly less than 1/4 c of vinegar.  Dipped chicken in egg and soy, then shook in bag with 1/2 c cornstarch and 1/2 c flour (got rid of a lot of the overall starchy taste).  Added thin, diagonally sliced carrots to veg, added water/cornstarch to thicken sauce and water to thin.  Poured sauce over chicken just before serving.  Awesome with revisions.

This is a great recipe I'll make over and over again. After reading other reviews I cut back the cornstartch for the sauce by half. For the chicken I used half the amount of cornstarch and 1/2 cup of flour. It was so good!

This is excellent!  I didn't use the MSG.  It's unnecessary and incredibly unhealthy.  Also, I used honey instead of white sugar, which gave the sauce a really great flavor.  I'm definitely making this again!

This is a good recipe, but there are definitely a couple things I changed. For example, like many mentioned, there is way too much cornstarch in the sauce itself. It becomes so thick it's like a goo. I would halve it and go from there. The flavor is excellent!! Also, I omit the MSG. Is that really needed? I use chicken breast instead of thighs, which is just a personal preference. One last thing - when stir frying the green onion and dried pepper in the wok, I add a splash of cooking sherry. It is so good! If not for the tweaks I had to make I would have rated it 5 stars. But not quite perfect on its own.

I was so excited when I found this recipe. I love General Tsao's chicken but we can't get it where we live. Everything was going great until I mixed the chicken and the sauce. All the batter on the chicken turned to goo and had a horrible texture. Next time I will cook the sauce by its self and then add it to the chicken. Also the sauce wasn't spicy enough for our tastes. Thanks for posting this recipe.

This is a really tasty recipe.  I followed the suggestions to cut down on the cornstarch, and the texture and consistency of the chicken was wonderful.  I have to admit that I was skeptical at first because the chicken looks like a big glob of goo before it's fried!  The sauce was rather thick at first, but it's easy to get to your desired consistency by adding water or pineapple juice, etc.  I'm watching my sugar intake, so I substituted the white sugar for splenda, and nobody could tell!  The one thing I'll change the next time I make it is to cut way back on the amount of soy sauce that the chicken is mixed with... the chicken was too salty for my tastes.  This recipe is definitely a keeper and will be pulled out on comfort food nights!

This is a good recipe to build from but it definitely uses too much cornstarch and too much sugar and vinegar. I also think I would use chicken thigh meat instead of breast and I would also skip the deep frying part of it too. I would just stir-fry without having coated with egg and cornstarch mixture. The sauce has a really good overall flavor and that is what really gets it the four stars. I also think that the addition of celery and nuts would be nice.

I cook almost daily for my picky husband, but he didn't think homemade General Tsao's was possible. I prooved him wrong with this recipe! I did cut the corn starch as noted in the sauce, but used the recipe amount for the chicken chunks. Don't worry if the chicken is kinda glue like before frying, it will come out crispy and taste awesome!

As everyone else says...this recipe is wonderful!  I too used about 3 Tbsp. of corn starch in the sauce and only half a cup to coat the chicken before deep frying.  I also used 1 Tbsp. of red pepper flakes in lieu of dried chiles.  Even my husband who doesn't like Chinese food liked this dish!

Very good recipe.  I didn't have any chile peppers, so I used crushed red peppers.  I also used only 1/4 cup cornstarch for the sauce, and it came out perfect.

I should have read the reviews before making this dish!  1/2 cup of cornstarch is just way too much! Common sense took over, so I only added a little bit over a quarter cup. The end result still turned out a bit jelly like especially after it cooled. Instead of adding 3/4 cup of sugar I only added 1/4 cup and added 2 Tbs. of ketchup.  I misread the ingredient for the white wine vinegar, which I thought was white wine and substituted 1/4 of sherry. When I realized my mistake I added 2 Tbs of vinegar. Also for the chile peppers I use red pepper flakes (2 Tbs. We like it hot.)  Overall I think the taste was similar, but definitely use less cornstarch for the sauce.  I also didn't fry my chicken.  I just added 1-2 Tbs of cornstarch to the chicken (so it'd soak up some of the water/chicken juice from the chicken) then browned on both sides, added the green onions, then added the sauce.

With other reviewers comments noted, a great recipe.  I ALWAYS omit MSG in any recipe,  because it causes some people unmentionable (on a cooking site) medical problems.  MSG also increases sodium content a lot, as well.

Excellent flavor - just like the take-out place down the road.  Would give this 5 stars except that the sauce is just too thick.  Shame on me for not reading these reviews before I made it.  Will make this again very soon to try it out with less starch.  I didn't add the chiles and it was still great.

THIS RECIPE IS MARVELOUS!!!!!!!!!!!!
this is a new favorite in my home. i made this recipe for my husband and brother in law, who both love general tsaos chicken, and they could not believe how close to the real thing it was. i agree with the others to leave out msg and cut starch to 1/4 cup for sauce. the only thing i might recommend is cutting the amount of chicken used in half, or doubling the sauce mixture. i dont think the sauce was too thick, it just had to cover alot of chicken. also, you dont need 16 dried chile peppers, a few will do just fine and provide the perfect amount of flavor. anyways, it was delicous! thank you!

This recipe was delicous!!  I was a little worried about making this after some of the reviews I read,  but it was really good!!  From the suggestions I read,  I used crushed red pepper flakes,  the only problem I had was I put to much red pepper flakes in my dish,  and it was a little too spicy, but this was fault of my own.  I will be making this again and again!  With scaling back on the crushed red pepper of course.  I read on one review that said to use 3-4 tablespoons, and I used 1 and a half tablespoons and it was still to much.  Maybe next time I will only put a couple teaspoons.  Great recipe.

My husband and I LOVE General Tsao’s chicken.  We order it all the time.
I first have to say that this recipe wasn't as bad as I thought it was going to be by reading other reviews.  Although it didn't taste like the General Tsao's I get at my favorite Chinese restaurant, it was still very tasty, with a few modifications.  Next time, I will reduce the sugar to a half-cup.  It was fairly sweet.  I would also reduce the cornstarch to a quarter-cup (instead of half cup) for the sauce.  It does thicken the sauce to glue like paste. All general Tsao’s I have had at restaurants is more the consistency of a thin jelly, not a paste.  I would also add a can of drained water chestnuts and baby corn, because all the general Tsao’s I have ever got had them in the sauce.  Also, I added chili pepper flakes; only because a few people I had over don’t like spicy food.  Next time, I will add LOTS more.  This is supposed to be a spicy dish.
I also didn’t add the MSG because I couldn’t find any in time.
I also made a mistake and put the white wine vinegar in the batter mixture instead of the sauce by accident, and it didn’t turn out bad.  When I realized it, I added the vinegar to the sauce as well.  I won’t do it again though :)
As for level of difficulty, when I make dinner it usually takes me anywhere from 30 minutes to an hour and this recipe wasn’t any different.  It isn’t a “quick” dish, but I didn’t find it that time consuming.  The longest part is deep-frying the chicken, and if you

I think the hardest part of this recipe was cooking all the chicken.......(I have smaller kids and had to cut smaller pieces) but the final result was nice...I had to cook to the kids's taste buds I prefer mine spicy . Maybe next time I will add some hoisin sauce, But will definately make it again.
Thanks sonya

We enjoyed this recipe.  I did take a shortcut and use frozen chicken strips.  The chile amount can be VERY variable depending on the type of chile availible.  In a pinch I would use red pepper flake.

Wow...time-consuming to make, but overall a very tasty recipe. We added partially steamed brocolli to the sauce and did NOT add the chicken to it. This recipe is best if you put the deep-fried chicken on the rice and then pour the sauce over it at the very end. Chicken stays crispy that way.

Very good dish and everyone in my family loved it.  However, the sauce turned out too thick.  I'll definitely reduce the cornstarch the next time.  I may even make the sauce without cornstarch first.  Then add it to the thickness I'm looking for.

CUT THE CORNSTARCH DOWN TO 2 TABLESPOONS.  My gods!  I used 1/4 cup and it was still way too much, leaving something akin to a gravy in the wok. Also, use low sodium soy sauce and brown rice vinegar instead of white wine vinegar.  It'll be a lot better.

Wow, this was SO good! I use a lot of the same ingredients in a lot of my stir-fry recipes, but they created a whole different flavor in this dish! This was how I made it: Marinated the chicken pieces in soysauce, white pepper and garlic powder and added some cornstarch AND flour-just enough to coat it. I fried the pieces until they were golden and crisp(took only about 2 minutes!). For the sauce, I used 2-3 tbsp of cornstarch, 4 tbsp of water, 1/4 cup soysauce, 1/2 cup of sugar, about 1/8 of white vinegar and grated in 3 garlic cloves. I added some thai chili peppers and green onion to a hot pan with a bit of oil, added the sauce and added water to the sauce until I got the consistency I wanted. I then added the chicken and it was fabbb!! I didn't use an egg to coat the chicken because I felt like it would just create a thicker breading around the chicken and I didn't use ginger either.

I made this tonight, but didnt read the reviews first.  I also revised it a little. Instead of frying, I pan grilled chicken tenders, subsituted cider vinegar for the white wine, didnt use onions,  added 2 tblsp red pepper flakes, and used 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/4 cup brown sugar. The flavor was great, but way too much starch. I'm going to try this again with 1/4 cup cornstarch.

I can never remember to read the reviews.  I will use less corn starch in sauce next time.  I didnt have white wine vinegar so I used red.  No MSG here.  I battered with flour instead of more corn starch.  I pan fried instead of deep fried, and used that same pan to finish it.  It was very tasty - a little corn starchy but not bad, it still tasted good.  Thank you for sharing!

Great recipe. Tastes like some of my favorite restaurants do. I cut back on the corn starch as many suggested but I ended up adding more in when i was cooking the sauce. I also added more soy sauce to taste.

The flavor of this is EXCELLENT! I have made this recipe several times now and my husband just loves it. I always replace the chilies with crushed red pepper. However, I do think that there is too much cornstarch in the sauce. I prefer my sauce to be thinner and 3 out of 4 times I've made this recipe the sauce has set up almost instantly and was very very sticky and no amount of added liquid could make it otherwise. Other than that small detail I love this recipe!

This was a wonderful recipe. It turned out great! I did skip the MSG. I also took the advice of previous reviewers and cut down the corn stach in the sauce. I also used pepper flakes in place of the chile peppers. This was my first try at Asian cooking. Thanks for the great recipe.

Not as expected. Good (use less cornstarch, as per other reviews), but a LOT of soy sauce flavor. I was looking for a more honey bbq flavor.

DELICIOUS! I made it for my in laws for their anniversary and it was a huge hit! I had to make changes though because 16 peppers...NO WAY! I cut back on the sugar and cornstarch as suggested by other members. And of course, used waaaaaaaaaaay less peppers. :) I was trying to also feed my children and it was still too hot for them. I think the next time I make this I will make it more figure friendly and not deep fry the chicken. Thanks for a great recipe. I love how everyone kind of customizes it to make it their own. ;) Can't wait for lunch...leftovers!

This recipe turns out perfect every time I make it!  It is definitely a healthier alternative to the take-out Chinese food I typically get that uses questionable meat (still very tasty, though).  I left out the MSG, as I think that is overkill.  I also left out some of the chile peppers so it didn't kill me in the morning.  Thanks for sharing!

This was very good & made the whole house smell wonderful!!! I have another general tsao's recipe that isn't that good at all & will be making this one from now on! My husband & I both love this & always order it when we go out for chinese. It wasn't as good as take out but it was still good. My only changes were that I used 1/4 cup cornstarch like everyone else had mentioned cutting down on that. I also used powdered ginger cause thats what I had on hand & I only used 1 tsp (not a huge fan of it) I completley left out the MSG, didn't have any & don't like adding it to food anyways. I used the chicken broth room temp, didn't bother warming it up since you refrigerated  the sauce when your done anyways & I used red pepper flakes in place of the peppers cause thats what I had on hand. Also stir fried this to save on fat & threw in some chopped carrots as well & served over white rice! It was very good!! Next time though I will cut back on the cornstarch in the breading for the chicken as well either that or replace it with flour. Overall very good though!

very good, I used fried chicken pieces from the store to make it quicker.  The sauce was alittle to sweet for my taste but other than that it was very good.  Will make again with less sugar.

Very nice recipe. I will definitely repeat!  I had my doubts but it all came together in the pan I didn't have a wok, so I used a pan on max 10 heat with peanut oil. mmmmmm good!

this recipe was great using the reviewers' suggestions. i also got a tip from another website...the KEY is when coating the chicken to mix the egg and soy sauce together and put the cornstarch in a ziploc bag. it's easier and less messy to coat the chicken this way. I only used 2T of cornstarch and 2T of apple cider vinegar(all i had) and 3T of sugar for the sauce..then i doubled it (but not the vinegar). it was delicious! Will definitely make again. Thanks to all!

2TBS crushed chili peppers is super hot but it was really good. Just fed it to my husband and sister-in-law and they loved it. I used white vinegar instead of the wine vinegar and used a bit less starch in the sauce. I didn't add the oil to the chicken before cooking either. It was really good!

Delicious! I added more garlic and ginger (about 1 TB each) and only used 2 TB corn starch in the sauce and it was perfect. (I've made several chinese dishes with sauce this consistency before and already knew 1/2 cup waaaaayyyy too much corn starch.) I started by cutting out 4 TB of the sugar and tasting the sauce, but I thought it needed the entire amount so I added it back in. Like some reviewers, I wasn't completely in love with the cooked soy sauce/cornstarch flavor in the chicken. Next time I will just use regular tempura batter (also from this website) but the sauce was exactly what I was looking for. My husband and I relocated to Germany for his job and miss good ol' American Chinese food, since the German idea of Chinese food is quite different. This reminded me of our favorite Chinese place back in Houston. Thanks Shaun. We'll definitely make this sauce again with regular tempura chicken. It's a keeper!

DEEElicious! I was skeptical throught the whole process - "why is the sauce this color? is the chicken batter suppossed to look like peanut butter and be THIS sticky?" I can not tell you all the doubts I had but when I tasted it, it was as good or better than the restaurants. I topped mine with Sriracha sauce. Fantastick, thank you.

While the taste of this is fine there is just WAY TOO much cornstarch in it.  I put about 1/2 what was called for when I coated the chicken, and it was plenty.  As for the sauce, it was so thick we had to add about 5 times the amount of water called for to thin it down at the end.  And we were so desperately trying to get it to thin down before it hardened into concrete that we really didn't have time to think about WHAT we were thinning it with, so it was totally watery, and then we had to add back in some soy sauce, vinegar, and broth and sugar to get back to having some flavor.  It was a big hit when all was said and done, but I have to believe the 1/2 "cup" cornstarch is a mistake.  About 2 Tablespoons would have been more than enough, especially since the chicken is coated with it as well, which also helps thicken the sauce.  Anyway, there are a lot of other Gen. Tso's chicken recipes out there - all more or less the same basic ingredients and procedure - and I would recommend trying a different one.

EXCELLENT! A few notes, don't use MSG and ginger, I marinade the chicken in "hot" soya sauce-then drained. In bag 1/2 c cornstarch and 1/2 c flour. Dip in egg/soy. I didn't use green onions or chile peppers. The sauce is awesome! Will make again!

The flavor was alright, but the the texture was not that great.  The recipe calls for way too much cornstarch.  The sauce was very thick and almost inedible.  Next time I will cut back on the cornstarch.

We rated it 5 stars - tastes just like the General's chicken from our favorite Chinese restaurant. I left out the MSG and halved the sugar and cornstarch amounts. I only used two bunches of chopped green onions (not two cups). I used dried arbol chili pods (rated very hot, but just right for us) and it was even better the next day.

Edible, but not at all General Tsao's Chicken. Followed directions exactly except for halfing the cornstarch for the sauce. It was still too much cornstarch. Will not make again.

I only used cornstarch and egg to make the batter for the chicken.  I used Splenda for the sugar and this worked out great.  There is NO need for MSG (it's not good for you!!) The sauce was delicious and I love that it coated the chicken the same way as General Tso's chicken is at chinese restaurants.  The only down side was that the coating on my chicken lost some of its crunch when I added the saice to the pan.  And be careful your pan isn't too hot when you add the sauce to it!!!

This was amazing!  I doubled the amount of sauce (but only used 1/2 cup cornstarch), omitted the MSG and subbed 2 tbsp red pepper flakes in place of the chile peppers.  I served this with steamed broccoli and white rice - just like we would get from our favorite chinese restaurant.  General Tsao's Chicken is my husband's favorite chinese dish, and he said this was the best version he'd ever had!

Not a bad base for a sauce - but took some modification to get the proper consistency and flavor.  Used a combination of thai chili paste (also contains garlic), dried chilies, hoisin, and brown sugar to really solidify it.  I cook by look and taste, and this recipe (prepared to the letter, anyways) just didn't have an appealing consistency/texture and the flavor just wasn't quite there.

I've made this a couple of times now and it turns out delicious. I made a lot of substitutions- used plain white vinegar, red pepper flakes, and black pepper instead of white- and it was still great. I didn't have a deep fryer either, so just used some oil in a pan and flipped the pieces halfway through. I added quite a bit of extra water to the sauce in the end because it kept thickening even with the heat off. Served it over rice. Will definitely make it again! Thanks!

DON'T TRY THE CHICKEN WITHOUT THE SAUCE. Wow... I just made hubby go and run and get something else for dinner. As the chicken didn't look or taste good. Now I am sitting here sneaking bites because it tastes better with the sauce. I would NEVER cook the chicken like this again. It tastes just like soy sauce...yuck. Instead i will just use the same method I do for my sweet & sour chicken. The sauce is wonderful. I didnt use the peppers, but used crushed red pepper. And unless you like something super spicy...i wouldnt put too much. Some people were like use 2 tbl...ummm no. I just shook it until it looked good & it was way less than 2 tlb (like some suggested) & still VERY spicy!!

Excellent recipe with a little tweaking.  Definitely use less cornstarch, 1/4 is more than enough and will give you sweetness and thickness.  I will add more vinegar next time to give it a kick.  Sauteing with flour instead of cornstarch also helps cut the sweetness.

This recipe was amazing! My husband really enjoys fast food Chinese restaurants and we were looking for an equally delicious, slightly healthier version to enjoy at home. I think it matches up and we like that it isn't as bad for us. I did reduce cornstarch as recommended and used dried chili flakes and it was superb! My husband's comment is that it didn't taste "cheap" enough--it was more "high end" tasting like at a sit-down restaurant. We enjoyed this dish so much that we will make it over and over again!

I am so disappointed in this dish, nothing about it was good and I am sorry I got out the deep fryer for it.  We usually only deep fry for our superbowl party... so once a year, but based on the reviews I decided to give this a try.   This tastes NOTHING like the general tsao chicken I order in the restaurant.  Tastes more like a cheap chinese dish you would get from the frozen section in the grocery store.

I only made the chicken part of this recipe (we had some bottled sauce on hand), and I must say, the chicken was absolutely perfect!  I'm eating leftovers right now and I'm having a hard time convincing myself I'm not eating takeout.  I made no modifications to the recipe.  Next time I'm going to make the sauce too.  Thank you so much!

This turned out really well! I was told by General Tsao's fans that this was very authentic and delicious. I think next time I will lessen the amount of cornstarch for the chicken coating, it seemed to be a bit much.  I served this over white rice with a side of steamed broccoli & sesame oil. I will use this again, thanks (:

Very good.  The cornstarch batter produces tasty chicken nuggets even before the sauce is introduced.  Husband & son liked that on it's own so I'm sure I'll make that part of the recipe again & again.  Like others, I reduced the amount of cornstarch for the sauce considerably (1/4 C).  In future I'll reduce it again to 2 Tbs.  I also left out the MSG, not needed. In an effort to reduce the overall sodium content I halved the 1/2 C soy sauce called for in the batter - making it 1/4 soy sauce 1/4 water.  Next time I'll halve the amount called for in the sauce next time too, as I found it to taste a tad "dark" or heavy.

I'm not even sure if I would call this a Chinese-ish dish. But it is delicious. And Easy. I have even used pre-battered frozen chicken breast strips with this recipe and it's wonderful. Just sprinkle the strips with a little 5-spice and bake as directed. when done toss with the sauce and other ingredients. I've also substituted the vinegar with an equal amount of dry white wine. Equally as good. Serve with a side of jasmine rice. We eat this at least twice a month now.

I read the reviews and made the following changes- 
For the sauce:
Reduced cornstarch to 2 T.
Used brown sugar instead of granulated.
Eliminated the white wine vinegar.
Eliminated the msg.

For the chicken:
Eliminated the soy sauce.
Used white pepper & flour for coating.
Eliminated the cornstarch.
Used pepper flakes instead of chilies.

Dipped the chicken pieces in flour mixture; fried, drained, set aside.  Drained oil; poured sauce in pan; thickened; stirred in chicken pieces.
With modifications, this recipe is a family favorite served over brown rice!

DEEELICIOUS!!!  As I was making this I was a little afraid that it wasn't going to turn out as AWESOME as this did!  Its rather time consuming..but well worth all the effort.  I followed the recipe almost exactly ..NO MSG though...but I followed other reviewers recommendations and doubled the sauce recipe (but I didn't double the sugar..3/4 of a cup seemed like enough to me).  I didn't have the dried chili's so I used some red pepper flakes..  I cooked the red pepper and sauce in the wok a bit first so it would thicken up and then tossed it with the chicken..Served with broccoli (stir fried with some of the extra sauce) and jasmine rice.  This meal is just as good, if not better, than any Chinese restaurant.  Try it, you'll love it!

This recipe has great flavor, my hubby loves it!  However, I found that a few changes needed to be made. I double the sauce, but use only 1/4 cup cornstarch total, in the doubled sauce. I leave out the MSG as it isn't healthy and I like to add a vegetable. P.S. If you like this recipe but don't like the calories or fat, check out Szechwan Shrimp on this site. You can easily replace the shrimp with chicken and save yourself a load of fat and calories without losing much if any flavor.

Very good recipe...also used crushed red peppers as a substitute and used soy sauce from my local Asian market, so it came out A LOT darker than the picture ans also richer. But the taste was wonderful. If you use the real soy sauce, be careful not to add extra salt, because the sauce is very salty. But hubby and I loved it and it tasted better than the local restaurant! We used chicken breasts and served it with Fried Rice II from this site. Also, sauteed it in canola to reduce bad fats.

Awesome Recipe! I took the advice of some of the others, making a tempura batter for the chicken, doubling the sauce, using less cornstarch. I did add more white wine vinegar, and crushed red peppers. I sauteed the vegetables in olive oil, along with chili oil. I added the crushed red peppers after I served my kids. I also added the sauce to each individual serving, so the chicken wouldn't become soggy. I will definitely be using this recipe again!

I'm rating this 5 stars for the sauce alone - JUST LIKE my favorite take-out!  I used the sauce to make a healthy tofu stir-fry:  1 lb cubed extra firm tofu dusted w/ a combination of whole wheat flour, pepper and garlic powder.  Stir fry about 5 minutes, add some veggies and the sauce and simmer another five minutes.  I only used 1 tbsp corn starch, vegetable stock and no MSG.  Added the dried peppers at the end, and although it's not the same a good old chicken, I actually enjoyed the tofu!

I am up to nearly 200 Recipes and my husband (without solicitation) said...."Honey.Out of all the things you have made...this one is my favorite!"  That about says it all.  I felt like I would make 2 batches of sauce next time and make one without the cornstarch.  It needed something to drench the rice a bit that I served it up with.

Way too much cornstarch.  I should have read the reviews and backed off it.  The flavor was great, but the consistency was way too sticky because of the cornstarch.  Also, I just used frozen popcorn chicken from Costco; makes this recipe a snap.

Wow, to be honest, I was a little bit skeptical and thought that this recipe would just turn out okay. I'm very picky when it comes to Asian dishes but I'm just so glad that I gave it a try coz' it turned out to be a really tasty dish. It really is similar to the General Tso's chicken I used to have. I did however, halved the recipe since I wanted to make sure first that this would be a success. Doubled the garlic called for it, reduced the amount of vinegar, stir fried and NOT deep fried the chicken, and everything else just followed what the recipe says. I also didn't put dry chilli coz' I didn't have any, instead I put a little bit of ground chilli (the kind you found at Asian grocery store) and put black pepper powder as desired. After the chicken and sauce were mixed and thoroughly combined, I drizzled some sesame oil into it. This totally made the dish even better!!! You gotta try it, absolutely delicious. =)

This was so good!  I followed the recipe exactly, and it worked out well.  Next time, as a time saver, I will omit the coating and frying of the chicken, and just pan fry the chicken without the breading.  This was easy and simple to make.  The entire time I was making this dish, I kept telling myself that the dish was going to turn out bad, but it did't!  I surprised myself, and don't become alarmed if the chicken looks like goo, it works out!  In short, followed the directions exactly and loved every last bite.  After adding the sauce to the wok, I did have to add water.  LOVED IT, LOVED IT, LOVED IT!!

I can't believe I made this and how great it turned out!!!!!  OMG!!!  I subsituted boneless chicken thighs for breasts just because that is how I have had it in the past.  Great!!!! I also decreased the corn starch as everyone else did in the sauce and with the chicken.  I think next time I may use brown sugar and decrease the vinegar in the sauce as I lean toward the sweeter side.  Also, I only had red wine vinegar in the house.  It worked great.  I omitted the peppers as my family does not care for hot & spicy foods.  Mixing the ingredients for the batter & chicken was really globby and when the recipe indicated to add a cup of oil I thought this wasn't going to turn out but the batter did stay on the chicen and keep your chicken pieces fairly well seperated.  I was really amazed!!! A little time put in but definitely worth it.  Will be making again!  Thanks for the recipe!!

It's hard to find a recipe for General Tsao's, so I was skeptical - but this was very good!!  The red peppers I had weren't all that spicy, so I'll need to look for something different, but the recipe itself is a great one.  I didn't use a deep fryer, just added oil to a pan, it still turned out right!
Thanks - my hubby really enjoyed it!

I loved this recipe! It was a little process but in the end it was yummy. My kids did like the chicken plain after it was fried without the sauce.

YUM!!! My husband and I spent the evening together making this and we were so glad we did!  We followed the suggestions on here and used 1/2 cup of cornstarch for the chicken and about 3 TBS. for the sauce. It turned out great! Next time, we will use less sugar as it was just a tad too sweet for our tastes, but it was wonderful! We will definitely be adding this to our regular rotation of recipes!!

I agree that there is WAY too much corn starch in the sauce. I made this for Husband, and he said he was really put off by the gluey texture. Other than that, this was ok.

WOW!!! We live in the mountains and have a hard time finding good take-out like we are accustomed to in New Jersey and New York. I cut back on the corn starch to a 1/4 cup like past reviews said. I used 1tbs and 1 pinch of crushed red pepper (may be too hot for some, but we loved it) I cooked the sauce separate from the chicken and added it at the plate to keep the chicken crispy. I had my hubby sample the sauce as I cooked it, and he and I found it too tangy. I used some Karo(corn) syrup as a "band-aid" to sweeten it up to our desired taste. After a few quick pours of Karo, we hit "pay dirt"!!! Next Time I will use a smidge less vinegar and a bit more sugar...Otherwise, this dish was WICKED DELICIOUS!!!

Thank you so much for sharing this recipe. I have been searching high and low for a General Tso's recipe like my favorite Chinese restaurant. The husband said it was better than any he's ever had in any restaurant. 

Don't let the negative reviews discourage you from trying this. The taste is phenominal once you get it tailored to your individual tastes. Like everyone else, I cut the cornstarch back in subsequent attempts, and for my taste 2 tbsp is about right. Actually, I was still quite happy with the first batch. I simply thinned the sauce with some pineapple juice. I guess if you don't care for the consistency and you don't want to make it any sweeter, you could thin it out with some chicken broth. I made a few other tweaks like cutting the dried chiles back to six, adding some curry powder, skipping the MSG, substituting red wine vinegar and brown sugar, etc. My only complaint would be the mess, and yet I still find myself making it once every week or two. I'd much rather wash a sink full of dishes than hop in the car, drive 45 miles, then shell out big bucks for a meal I could make better at home.

This was good.  The chicken had a good taste to it, but it didn't taste like the general tsao chicken I've had at restaurants - more like chicken teriyaki.  (I'm not sure if I did something wrong?).  One thing - to make the presentation nicer save some of the slices of the green part of the green onion, and put them on the chicken when you serve it.

The end product on this was delicious! As good if not better than any restaurant. But be prepared to invest some time and mess. 
Made exactly as appeared. I tried frying the chicken in my deep fryer and it stuck to the basket so be sure and fry in a non stick pan.

Very good recipe, loved the sauce, really tasted like chinese which is good cause it is getting scary eating out anymore.  I would decrease the amount of peppers (wow was it hot- for me anyway) I made it twice and the second time I used only 5 peppers which was perfect for me.  Thanks for sharing your recipe.  Oh I did add a little honey and brown sugar cause I like it a little sweeter but an excellent recipe all together.

After viewing all the positive feedback, I had to make this recipe.  It was so beyond my expectations.  My whole family enjoyed it very much, and I can't wait to make it again.  I did make quite a few modifications myself.  I only used two tablespoons of cornstarch for starters and 2 tablespoons of vinegar.  With all the sugar in the sauce, an abundance of cornstarch is not really necessary. I didn't have any chicken broth on hand, so I just substituted 1/2 cup hot water.  I didn't add any MSG.  I used black ground pepper instead of white.  As for the rest, I only used a 1/4-1/2 cup of green onions.  I also used about two tablespoons red pepper flakes in place of the chile peppers.  For a special touch I added in some chopped red bell pepper and broccoli florets.  I guess I made a whole new recipe.  Very delicious.  Thanks!

Excellent.  The flavor was great!   I followed other reviewers'
suggestions and (a) cut the cornstarch in the sauce by more than 50%, down
to less than a quarter of a cup, (b) used red pepper flakes (probably a
teaspoon worth but really just some hefty shakes) instead of chile
peppers, (c) omitted the MSG, and (d) used a bit under two pounds of
chicken (instead of three) to get a better sauce to chicken ratio.   I also tried making two batches
at once, one in which I deep fried the chicken and one in which I sauteed it.
There wasn't much difference between them, probably because most of the flavor comes from the sauce.  From now on I'll just saute it: it's easier to cook, there's no
meaningful taste difference, and it's healthier.

Really good recipe.  I didnt put in any MSG, and cut the starch in half, along with the soy sauce amount.  The first time I made it, it came out way too starchy.  Second time I made it and cut the starch it was fine.

Good recipe!! I've been cooking Asian food for years now.  I find chicken thighs (all fat trimmed) and cubed to be much more juicier than the breast meat.  Also, I never add MSG to anything.. if you add plenty of spice there's no need.  Try this recipe WITHOUT deep frying.. just cook the marinated cubed chicken in a pan until they are no longer pink then add to the sauce to simmer.. this is also good with strips of beef.

This is a very good recipe, that when prepared as according to this recipe exactly, comes out exactly like many restaurant's general tsao's chicken. It is important to get a nice coating on the fried chicken, and to use the MSG. That is the key. I found that adding the oil to the chicken/cornstarch mixture is imperative, and I'm glad that I didn't omit it as I was tempted to do.

This recipe tasted absolutely wonderful! I did only make 3 modifications. I only used 2 of the chili peppers and removed them after sauteing them in the hot oil. I also did not have white wine vinegar, but I did have red wine vinegar flavored with garlic. Lastly, I left out the MSG b/c my family is allergic to it. This recipe took a little extra time to fry the chicken in small batches, but overall it was great. DO NOT WORRY WHEN THE SAUCE COMES OUT ALMOST BLACK. IT TASTES GREAT ANYWAYS. I was just shocked b/c mostly the sauce in restaurants is slightly red. This recipe is a keeper!

Although this was tasty, I doubled it and spent an hour and a half slicing, dicing, and mixing.  When I finally started frying, the chicken stuck in a glob to the fryer basket.  What did I do wrong?  This took me nearly three hours to make.  I would make it again if someone could tell me how to properly make a better batter for the chicken.  I'm tempted to try chicken nuggets. I did follow advice and held back on the corn starch.  I was patient with the sauce, and it thickened eventually without my adding any constarch.

This was GREAT! A girlfriend and I made this and all three of children clean their plates! The're ages are 1, 2, and 5. They loved it! We went for 2nd and were stuffed. For the children we left the chile peppers out. Two nights later we made a double batch to feed our husbands, it was still good, but better to make a single batch at a time.

Although I LOVED the fried chicken, I certainly didn't like the sauce very much.  Better than the chinese restaurant over here when I live now...but defintely still not the best.  I highly recommend the fried chicken though.  I really never thought of coating chicken in just soy sauce and cornstartch and pepper.  The fried chicken alone was a great hit with my husband.

I enjoyed this recipe.  It was a little sweet, but the rice helped to tone it down---can't wait to share it with others!

Tastes just like a entree from a chinese restaraunt! It doesn't take that long to prepare, like others have commented, that is just how long chinese stir-frys take! Besides, I would spend all night in the kitchen for this dinner! Worthy of candlelight too!

This is a pretty good recipe. In fact, this recipe tastes better than the local fast food chinese place's General Tsao's chicken. *sniff* Im going to miss that place...

I didnt have any chille peppers, but I used a couple of dashes of red pepper flakes (ok, more than a couple) and that seemed to give the dish a nice sweet and spicy kick!

The recipe is a bit messy, but the results are great! 

Next time, Im going to cut back a bit on the white pepper.

Excellent!   I followed the recipe with exception of frying the chicken. I cooked it on the griddle to reduce the calories (less batter sticks to it).  My kids love the traditional recipe, but they were pleasantly surprised at how delicious and flavorful it turned out to be!  Also, I served it over Chinese noodles instead of rice...

The flavor of the sauce was very good. After reading the other reviews, I cut the cornstarch to 1/4C and still had to add water in small amounts to get to the right consistancy. Now I wish I had seen the crushed red pepper flakes instead of the dried chili peppers. I used some mild dried chili peppes which I soaked for a few minutes in boiling water before chopping coarsely. The flavor of the sauce was great, but not real hot due to the type of chili pepper I bought and the peppers were hard to chew. Next time I will try the crushed red pepper flakes, or if anyone has some tips on how to use the dried, I would love to hear from you.

This was great! I doubled the ginger and garlic, only used 1/2 cup of sugar, and didn't fry the chicken. I'll use at least 1/2 the corn starch in the sauce next time. I also added one sliced red pepper and I cut up head of broccoli to add some vitamins while only using 2 lbs chicken. It was great!

My. My. My.  By the last spoonful I was gushing with joy.  This truly was amazing.  I substituted flour for cornstarch.  As a reminder add the flour slowly to the water when making the sauce so that it doesn't clump (oops).

Definitely much better than take-out! Used less cornstarch as other people had commented before; used 3/4th cup sugar, but next time I will used the whole cup of sugar. and used less vinegar as well. WILL MOST DEFINITELY MAKE AGAIN! :)

The tempura mixture for this contains WAY to much soy sauce. I recommend cutting back on it by at least half.

One of the best recipes on this site!  I followed other's comments and reduced the cornstarch.  I also pan fried, rather than deep fried, the chicken.  The other substitute that worked is that I used 1 1/2 t of chili garlic paste and 1 1/2 t of crushed red pepper flakes in place of the whole chilies.  It gave it a great spicy flavor and was easy to adjust as we cooked.

5 stars with MARIAT66's alterations. I also used tofu instead of chicken, and skipped both the egg and MSG. Next time I'll use the original amount of vinegar. For tofu, just drizzle soy sauce over the pieces and dip in cornstarch rather than mixing the whole coating together. Just delicious!

This was our first foray into chinese american cuisine; so, perhaps that skewed our experience towards the negative.  The recipe was extremely messy and it took forever to fry all of the chicken.  Most disappointingly though at the end of such a long process, none of us really liked the final product.

This recipe has a good flavor.  However, that flavor is rather weak due to the amount of cornstarch used in the recipe.

The recipe was quite tasty, but I felt the sauce was lacking - perhaps increasing the quantity would provide a sufficient amount to go with some rice and steamed broccoli

Very good but kind of a lot of work.  Didn't deep fry, just browned in some peanut oil in a frying pan.  Used the soy sauce and egg as a wash then coated in cornstarch.  The sauce was a bit sweet.  I used splenda and next time would cut that in half.  My chicken must have been small because it was only four servings (with rice) so there was plenty of sauce to go around.  Added red pepper flakes after to make some of the meal kid friendly and not so hot for everyone.  Hubby loved it, 5 year old ate it but not always willingly.  Will definitely make again, just not on a weeknight.  Reminded me very much of PF Chang's.

Really tasty. I first made this with just the breaded chicken, and used it in a stir fry with some bottled sauce to save time. It was good. The second time I made the sauce as well and it was even better. This gets better every time I make it. Tastes fine without the MSG. I always make it with broccoli.

Wow! This is amazing! I took the advice of several reviews but next time I will cut down on the crushed red pepper (1 Tablespoon would be enough), and I will make more sauce.

I must of erred as my sauce was very vinegary and salty.  I will try again as I really would like this to work out. I reduced the cornstarch as others recommended and it worked out great. I  used 2 tsp of red pepper flakes (but only so I can ensure not too hot for the kids), the rest I followed as per recipe. Next time I am going to make sure on the sugar and slightly reduce vinegar and look for reduced sodium soya.  Goes excellent with lime & cilantro rice which is on this site as well.

We just didn't think this tasted like General Tsao's.   It wasn't terrible, but it definitely wasn't great either.  We thought it was too sweet, and I just couldn't get the sauce to the right consistency.  I made it exactly like the recipe, except I used red pepper flakes instead of chile peppers and I cut back on the cornstarch.  Just not what I was hoping for!

This was ok. Like others, too much corn starch.I changed things the second time around. I made the sauce as per recipe,but a bit less sugar,and mixed the water and corn starch separate, and thickened it at the end. The chicken, I used thigh meat,I like it best, I rolled the meat in corn starch, then egg(1 egg + 1 egg white) then rolled it in Panco.This results in a lighter breading but still crispy. Be careful with Panco because it browns VERY quick. So I cook it at 300-325.It browns fast,but it sort of stops and you can keep cooking it.Play around with it to get the hang of it.Panco also absorbs less oil.Came out tasty!

This is a very good recipe. I did decrease the corn starch in the sauce to 1/4 cup and increased the chicken broth to 1 1/2 cups...it was still fairly thick. I really liked the way the chicken fried up and would use the chicken part of the recipe with honey barbecue or sweet sour also. It feeds  6-8 people generously when served with rice and a vegetable.

The flavor of the breaded chicken was superb.  But the amount of cornstarch was absurd.  Seriously.  You could probably get away with a single tablespoon.  I didn't listen to my instinct, and even after adding a bunch extra chicken broth, it was totally off.  I was glad I'd saved some of the fried chicken outside the sauce.  I might make it again just for the chicken pieces!

The sauce was great. I used 3 pounds of tofu instead of chicken, and realized I should have cut the pieces a *lot* smaller. I didn't deep fry, again realizing my mistake. The sauce was very good though, but I would like it to go a little spicier next time, maybe some hot sauce or red pepper flakes or something. I also cut the corn startch down to 2TB for the marinade, and used about 1/4c for the sauce, which turned it into a thick jelly when heated, which is what I wanted. All and all it was indeed tasty and I will be making it again, albeit with a few tweaks for my own tastes. OH! And I omitted the MSG. I don't even know how to get ahold of it.

As others suggested, I doubled the amount of sauce (except for the corn starch).  Used half white sugar and half brown sugar and also added a couple of tablespoons of honey.   instead of cutting up and frying my own chicken, I used all white meat frozen popcorn chicken.  I made the sauce, tossed in the warmed up chicken and let it thicken up and served it over rice.  Easy and really good.

This is a great recipe.  I have made it a couple of times, and slightly change it up, just for convenience, and to make it a little bit healthier.  I would recommend cutting back the starch though.  You can get the same results with much less.

Im giving this 5 stars even though I had to reduce the corn starch and it was still a bit thick. I made a double batch of sauce (because we eat it on our rice) and I used half the corn starch. I also used 1/2 corn starch and 1/2 flour for the chicken. I also let my chicken sit in the soy sauce about an hour before frying which gave it a really good flavor.  My husband said it need a bit more kick so next time Ill add a bit of chinese pepper paste to the sauce. Other than that this was really good, Ill make this again for sure.

The taste was fantastic! It was spicy but not too spicy, perfect! However, the cornstarch is way too much. When I was cooking the chicken the sauce clumped together because of the cornstarch, I would suggest to anyone thinking about making this to reduce the cornstarch to at least half... Other than that, fantastic! I will make it again.

this was good - not nearly as yummy as what we get from a local chinese restuarant, but good. found it to be a little labor intensive too, but my family liked it.  sauce could have been a little more spicey for my taste.

I am not a fan of General's Chicken...I can't take the heat!  My husband, on the other hand, is addicted to the stuff!  I finally decided to try to make it for him and used this recipe.  He loved it!  I took the recommendation of halving the cornstarch, but it was still pretty thick...so I'll probably use less next time...and I'm sure there'll be a next time.  He really loved this!  Thanks!

Wow!  This was delicious!  I did cut the cornstarch down to 1/4c. like other suggested.  Good move.  It would have been like jello otherwise!  I also went with 1 tsp. of crushed red pepper.  It was perfect for us, but I might use a little less next time if I'm giving this dinner away, 1 tsp was a bit too spicy for the non-spice loving crowd.  Reviewers who suggested 3tsp must really like HOT food!!!

This turned out awesome. The only reason it didn't get 5 stars is that there were some modifications as mentioned from others. I halved the cornstarch in the sauce. I also didn't have fresh ginger root so I used 1/8th of a tsp of ground ginger. I also did have the pepper so used red pepper flakes. I also added green, red and yellow bell peppers and carrot for color and additional flavor. I can't imagine this without the veggies, they made it look and taste much better. I don't have a deep frier and creating one out of one of my pots has never ended good for me so I pan fried the chicken (a much healthier option anyway). It was a lot of work but worth it in the end. I can't wait to eat leftovers.

I gave this recipe a 4-star because I made several changes to make it healthier, but the flavor is excellent.  What I did was make a sauce to pour into the stir-fry or chicken recipe.  In a saucepan I mix together the water, garlic, ginger, sugar (I use sugar substitute), white wine vinegar, chicken broth, 1/4 cup low sodium soy sauce, crushed red pepper flakes to taste (I use about 2t, but add more for more heat), and orange zest from one orange.  I then add cornstarch and boil until desired consistency (I use about 4t-6t).  I use this sauce for fried rice, meatballs, ect.  My husband loves this and requests it a couple times a week!

i'm not sure how to make this better.  it was light color with strong flavors that weren't quite right.  it's missing something and has a chalky flavor from the large amount of corn starch.  it wasn't bad, just not what i was looking for in general tsao's chicken.

Had an Chinese themed dinner party here tonight while watching the Olympics. This was such a hit. I loved the base fried chicken, and used it as a base for sweet and sour chicken for the kids. The best part was I could VERY quickly cook up batches with different levels of spice. After the initial prep. I was able to make 4 batches that ranged from no chilis at all to "The perfect amount of pain mixed with a lot of flavor. Awesome." in under 10 minutes. Served it up with sweet and sour chicken, egg rolls, egg drop soup and shrimp lo mein all off this sight. The whole dinner took under 1 1/2 hours of cook time and I was completely satisfied.

I thought this was very good, however I did follow the previous suggestions. I used flour instead of cornstarch, and half the amount. Also no msg, and I had to substitute 2 tbsps of red pepper flakes for the dried peppers. I served it with steamed broccoli and fried rice. It may too spicy for some, especially kids, but my husband and I liked it.

My husband loves General Tsao's chicken and since we live in an area that doesn't have "real" Chinese food, he asked that I try my hand at making it. This recipe will NOT go into the cookbook. It is VERY salty and doesn't quite have that "Tsao's" taste. If you do choose to make it, I suggest limiting the corn starch to 2 TABLESPOONS for the WHOLE recipe and cutting down on the soy sauce (be sure to use the low salt kind). Also, pepper flakes work just fine and allow guests to enjoy their own level of spiciness. Also a little less vinegar is better.

I followed the advice of many others and used 1/4 c. cornstarch in sauce, I also did not have the peppers, so used 3 t. of crushed red pepper.  (Using less than people recommended because this was dinner for my whole family and the children don't like things "too spicy")I also had only about 2 lbs. of chicken.  I also cooked the sauce and added the chicken afterward.

I LOVED it!!  The children still found it too spicy, so next time I will use only 1 t. of the peppers.  I also had JUST enough sauce for my 2 lbs. of meat.  It kept well, as I am eating leftovers right now...  sauce is thicker and more gelatiness, but about the same as leftover chinese takeout.

I gave 4 stars because the recipe I do believe needed the changes, I could not imagine the sauce with double the corn starch, or trying to cook the sauce with the chicken...  just wouldn't work.

I made some changes and will still alter a few things in the future, but overall, this was an enjoyable meal.  Definitely use less cornstarch.  I used only 1/4 c for the sauce and it was a perfect consistency.  I used flour to lightly coat my chicken and I lightly pan fried rather than deep frying.  The sauce was a tad sweet for my tastes.  I will only add 1/2 sugar next time.  Overall, this is a nice addition to my menu list.  Thanks!

Good recipe. I did not include the MSG or onions because my boyfriend hates onion. But I did add brocolli. It was wonderful. However...I think what this recipe needs is the red sherry wine. When I looked up other authentic chinese general tsao chicken recipes they used Red Sherry wine!!

This was incredible! Just as good as any I have had at the Asian restaurants and better than most and best of all it came right from my own kitchen! I used freeze dried chives a couple of T, a tablespoon full of crushed red pepper, rice vinegar, and some hot oil to saute the onion/pepper in. I had to add quite a bit of water as this thickened and thickened and kept thickening, I think I added at least a good two cups of water as I went and it still thickened after it started to cool. I had trouble with the cornstarch "batter" as it was a soupy mess, (I only had 3/4 c of cornstarch) I didn't bother to try to add oil to separate the pieces, I just fished them out and put them in the frying pan. This was hard to stir with the chicken in the pan and the sauce thickening and starting to get gloppy, next time I'll try finishing the sauce then adding the chicken. I used 6 small/med chicken boneless breasts for this cut into strips, *tenders would have worked great* there was more than enough sauce! Awesome meal, Thanks so much, Shaun! Best when fresh, this did not reheat well. Flavor was still good, but the sauce didn't reheat well at all, was just globs after refrigeration.

For the sauce, add CORNSTARCH A LITTLE AT A TIME until it is a "little thinner than gravy" consistency. I DIDN'T FRY OR BREAD my chicken and it was excellent!! NO MSG! I also used dry pepper flakes...AWESOME!!!

i don't know if i will make this again. Why do you have to coat the chicken in corn starch? If i did make this again i would coat it in flour, you can taste the corn starch. The sauce is really good, but again i only used less than 1/4C. and that was still too much.

This may very well be the best thing I have ever cooked! I only had to make one change. I couldn't get the sun-dried peppers so I used a teaspoon of cyanne pepper. It was so hot that I had to cut the A/C on! If serving this to kids you may wanna cut this in half. O-yea be sure to take a large metal spoon and seperate your chicken 3 minutes into cooking... be very careful!

I wasn't sure exactly how to rate this recipe.  Mine was a disaster.  I take part of the blame, because I believe I heated it too much at the end and the cornstarch made it become incredibly gooey. The taste was ok. It took me an hour to complete this dish, and my husband wouldn't even eat it.  I was very disappointed.

Everyone in my family loved it but when I make it again, I'll reduce the cornstarch in the sauce mixture by at least half; the half cup was far too much and I had to cut the sauce considerably with water/stock.  I substituted powdered ginger for fresh and red pepper flakes for the chilis.  Left out the MSG but even with the substitutions and omission, I know there was still something missing.  Hoisin sauce, maybe?  Don't get me wrong, it was excellent but I'd love to find that missing ingredient. ;)

It was just okay.  The sauce is missing something - didn't really taste like General Tsao's.  Next time I will tinker w/ the sauce by maybe adding fresh orange juice, oyster sauce, and/or hoisin sauce.  I did follow the advice from many reviewers and reduced the amount of cornstarch to 1/4C but I still needed to add additional water to thin the sauce.  The cornstarch batter on the chicken was good - I would repeat that part.

This recipe is awesome!  It is my new "show off" dish for company.  I've made it for guests 3 times now and have recieved rave reviews every time.  I was even invited to teach a cooking class after serving this, and I am not a cook!  I did eliminate the MSG (because it gives my husband migraines) and cut the cornstarch in half.  With those 2 small changes this recipe is perfect!

This was really good.  My husband said that it reminded him of our favorite take out restaurant.  I followed some of the other reviewers' comments and did the following: reduced the amt of corn starch for the sauce; and added the sauce (by spoon) to the chicken (mixing gently) after it was done.  I didn't even use all of my sauce.  Thanks for the delicious and easy recipe!!

I really liked the sauce for this recipe, but the chicken was just yuck. It tasted way to much of soy sauce and was not crisp at all. I may use the sauce again but with a tempura battered chicken instead.

My husband and I have been searching for a great General Tsao recipe, and this comes the closest to what we are used to.  We did cut back on the cornstarch but not much as we are accustomed to quite a thick sauce with that dish.  The taste was very good but next time we will cut back on the ginger.  All in all, a success - we will make this again with some slight changes.  Thanks for the recipe!

I didn't eat this one myself because I'm a vegetarian, but my fiance and his friend told me that it's great!  The only thing I would do is cut down the amount of cornstarch!  We had to add a lot more water before it was done cooking!

My husband absolutely loves this!  The first time I made it I figured it was just by accident that it came out good, as I didn't have some of the ingredients.  But I made it last night, once again without some of the ingredients and it still came out delicious.  I didn't have any ginger, and I substituted red pepper flakes for the pepper, and couldn't tell any difference.  I don't like spicy foods, so I can just make it up to the last step and take my portion out before I add the hot spices for my husband.

I loved this recipe. I will definately cook again. I woud suggest to cut down on the cornstarch though.  I read a review where they said 2 tablespoons was enough.  I didn't have white wine vinegar I had white wine and salad vingegar and it came out great. I think you should add brocolli so you could have some kind of veggie. I also made again with shrimp instead of chicken very yummy. I would suggest you saute it instead of fry though. Thanks again

I love General Tsao's Chicken and when I go out it is one dish I make sure I get off the buffet.  However I followed this recipe to the "t" and it did not turn out as I expected that it would.  To much cornstarch was one of the identified culprits nor was the sauce suitable to light my tastebuds.  However this recipe can still work out if you add some sweet chili sauce for chicken which you can get at the oriental cooking store in place of the sauce that goes with the recipe.  Like I said this dish was dissapointing to a certain degree but can still be savaged.

this was a lot of fun to make, and being vegetarian, i could only taste the sauce (i made it for my husband). i thought, though it was really good, something was just a little off, but at this point i'm not sure what. my husabnd wouldn't eat any, in the end, because he said it had "too much sauce". i'm going to take the leftovers to my parents, where i can get a better review. i'll probably do this again.

I think this is a good base for a recipe, but I didn't care for the strong taste.  Maybe I used too much ginger and should have backed off with the vinegar.  Not sure where I went wrong.  The chicken was really good by its self.  My hubby requested more of the chicken.  Will keep looking.

I read all of the reviews of this recipe (and the tips as well).  I followed most of them (1/2 the cornstarch, red pepper flakes, black pepper, etc).  The frying of the chicken did take quite a bit of time, but it was good.  When I put the sauce & chicken together I thought it was just alright, however my boyfriend thought it was really good.  I think it would have been easier (and tastier) to get take-out.  Overall, if you like to cook and have the ingredients on hand it's not too hard to make.  I think you just have to customize the recipe to your taste.

Not too bad.  I followed the advice of other reviewers and doubled the sauce (but did not double the cornstarch). The sauce was the perfect consistency.  I got too much ginger in it (ok, I didn't have fresh ginger so I guessed on the amount of ground ginger-1tsp is way too much!!) that is my fault.  I will probably try it again. Other than that, the recipe was pretty easy but a little time consuming.

Not like the take-out place... but better. Tasted homemade and not greasy. We used our deep fryer on this one and served it with fried rice and crab-meat ragoons. Will be having "Chinese-night-in" again soon.

This recipe is excellent!  Our local chinese restaurant features this dish, my family asks for it without the "SPICE".  I only eliminated the peppers from the recipe and we loved it!  Tasted almost like the one we go out to enjoy.  Thank you for sharing this spectacular recipe!!!

Phenominal.  Beyond delicious.  In fact, this brings a whole new definition to the word delicious.  The changes I made were standard, I think, to the other reviewers.  I used 2 TBL cornstarch for the sauce itself, but still used 1/2 C. for the batter.  I also deleted the MSG since my poor tummy can't take it.  I also used regular onions because I lacked green onions, and I used red pepper flakes instead of sundried chile peppers.  Man, don't use a whole lot of those unless you want this really spicy...

Anyway, this was unbelievable.  I actually had my fiance thinking I went to the local Oriental Buffett and stocked up on the store bought stuff and served it as if I had made it myself.  :)  It's nice to be able to change the sweetness and spicyness of it depending on what mood I'm in.  It also freezes beautifully.  :)

Thank you a million times over, whomever gave this recipe.  You rock!

This was delicious.  I cooked the rice in my rice cooker and kept it on warm.  I cooked the chicken in hot oil and kept it warm in the oven.  As family arrived in batches, I cooked up a portion of the sauce and added chicken, so they got a fresh cooked meal in about 3 minutes!  Very impressive!

Very good!  On other reviewers' advice, I halved the amount of cornstarch in the sauce and replaced the chiles with crushed red pepper.  My only quibble with the end product:  It was a little more sour than the General Tsao's I'm used to; next time I'll use a little less vinegar.  Also, to those who objected that this doesn't reheat well, you might try setting aside half of the chicken and half of the sauce before combining them.  Reheat both the next day, mix them together, and it's nearly as good as new.  (Barring that, this recipe halves nicely.)

Wonderful recipe! My family loved it. It taste just like food from the local chinese restaurant. The only thing I changed was the amount of cornstarch added to the sauce. I don't like a thick sauce so I cut the amount to half (1/4 cup). Also, this first time I substituted the chicken for vegetarian meat (most of family is vegetarian) and that worked very well with the recipe. Will definitely make again!

This is a great starting point recipe, that has lots of potential.  Unfortunately, I didn't heed the warnings of others, and used the recommended amount of cornstarch.  Way too much!  The sauce thickened so quickly I had to add over a cup of water just to get it edible, which probably cut down on the flavors.  Next time I'll use a fraction of what the recipe says.  Otherwise not bad!

This was excellent!  Just as good as any I've had in a restaurant.  I too cut the cornstarch down.  I had to use red pepper flakes and cider vinegar as I didn't have chili peppers or white wine vinegar.  I also omitted the msg.  This is a keeper at our house!

This turned out great!  We marinated the chicken in soy sauce and red pepper.  We cooked the chiken in a wok instead of frying.  Very good recipe especially with the addition of noodles and some vegetables.

I've tried this recipe a few times and it keeps getting better and better. It's really the closest thing I've been able to find.  After trying the cornstarch batter I decided it was much easier to just simply bread the chicken, using all purpose flour and double coating with the egg, after soaking it in the 1/2c. soy sauce.  I've also cut back on some of the cornstarch that goes into the sauce.  This recipe does take some time.. but it's worth it to hear the whole family rave :)

This is a very tasty recipe.  Even my husband loves it, which is saying a lot.  I love the ginger flavor and always add a tiny bit more.  This dish is perfect with rice.  It is one of our favorites.  We've never added the msg and am not sure if we would even know the difference.  Thank you for a wonderful recipe!

DISGUSTING!!! I made it twice. The first time it was so awful, I couldn't eat it. The second time, I coated the chicken with flour like making fried chicken and only used a Tbs or 2 of cornstarch for the sauce. It was much much better, actually good.

Great recipe for wallpaper glue!  chicken was fair but the sauce was BAD! Way too much cornstarch and not spicy at all. I added more chicken broth and water to thin out the sauce - probably a cup of each. The search for a good General Tsao's chicken recipe goes on.

This is the very worse recipe that I've got from this site or any cookbook. I've spent hours today and a lot of money to put this together and it's awful. When I put it in the mixture to prepare for deep fat frying, it looked like liver and even after it was cooked, like no General Tsao that I've ever seen. BIG BUMMER

i agree the cornstarch was a bit much.  i didn't use the msg which lessened the salt.  i really like what msg does to the taste of food.  My body doesn't appreciate passing out everytime i encounter it

anybody have herbs they have added to a recipe to enhance the flavour without the deadly reactions?

There are so many recipies for this and all of them taste a bit different. Every chinese restuarant has its own variation of this also. I didnt find this to be the same as what I get at my favorite chinese restuarant, but I thought it was excellent and easy to make.

Like other reviewers I found that it called for too much corn starch.  Actually this was my first experience with corn starch and boy was I surprised when the sauce turned into Jello!  It had kind of a grainy taste (presumably from the corn starch).  Next time I'll cut down.  Other than that tastes about right.

Phenomenal! I never thought I could make this. and of course it was messy,  just saying cornstarch makes a mess. I am never eating chinese out again.

My husband and I always get this dish when we get take out chinese.   We were so excited to find a recipe for it!  It came out great, just like a restaurant.  It was time consuming but well worth it!  We made homemade crab rangoons to go w/ it! Will definitely make again!

Although I enjoyed this recipie, and have made it several times, it does not taste like the same dish I have had in restraunts before.  I can never get the chicken crispy enough and the sauce is way too thick.  I cut the cornstarch used in the sauce mixture down by half.  My husband is in the army and we are stationed in Germany, so there are not any good chineese restraunts here at all.  I will continue to make this, but it is a lot of work and it leaves a large mess in my kitchen.

This chicken was great, but I think I over did it on the cornstarch.  I was scared to use too many peppers, so it wasn't spicy, next time I'll know better.  This is a great recipe to feed a crowd.  I will definately be making this again. Thanks.

This is a really yummy recipe for General Tsao's Chicken.  My only suggestion is to add asian chile sauce to the cooking sauce when making it, so that it's spicier.

This worked great with tofu substituted for the chicken.  Good flavor, easy to make, and very similar to what you find in restaurants.  The sauce was very thick; I'll use less cornstarch next time.

I love General Tsao's chicken at chinese resteraunts, and this recipe is by far just as good if not better. I am so happy I can now make this recipe at home.  It's a little time consuming but worth the time in the end.

i didn't have time to fry the chicken, so i used perdue  gen. gao chicken, as a substitute time saver. i defrosted it 1.5 min.  i heated chicken in sesame oil in large wok  to heat it. then I added the sauce and cooked til thickened.  it was a great sauce. the steps to fry chicken would be too lengthy for weeknight dinner, so i got a little creative. served this with coconut rice and broccoli

Fairly easy.  I had everything on hand except dried red chillis and I used 1 tablespoon of red chili flakes.  I cut down on sugar and cornstarch as suggested by others and it came out great.  
Thanks for an easy recipe.

This...was....PHENOMENAL!!!! My husband is gluten-free so I tweaked it....gf soy sauce and gf chicken broth and ta-da! Gluten-Free General Chicken. This recipe made me a hero in his eyes, since he hasn't had Chinese in months and this is always what he ordered. I didn't have 16 chiles, so I subbed 1 tsp of red pepper flakes...he wanted more, but I needed less. Also, only used about a cup of green onions (because that's all I had) and the sauce turned out GREAT! This is, by high request, on our weekly menu now. Thank you so much!!

Awesome recipe! I doubled the sauce however, I would not double next time as it didnt really need it. I only used 1/2 cup corn starch for the doubled recipe, so 1/4 cup would have been good. I used 1.5 tablespoons crushed red pepper rather than chili peppers. Skipped the MSG. Fried the chicken pieces in a pan with about 1.5 cups of oil. Cannot wait to make it again!

Loved it! I also cut down on the cornstarch and deleted the MSG with no consequence.  In addition, I used chopped up ginger instead of the grated fresh ginger root.  Finally, I added carrots and brocolli and substitued red pepper flakes instead of the cayenne peppers.

My husband really likes this recipe. The only caveat that he has is that it is not General Tsao's. Its delicious Chinese-style spicy chicken, but is not quite the same thing as restaurant General Tsao's. This will become a regular part of our home meals. I was also impressed with how easy it was to make!

I absolutely love this recipe!! I make it very often and my boyfriend loves it. I don't use so many peppers cause not everyone likes the spice, but I do love the gelatinious part. I don't add ginger though, or else 1/2 tsp ginger powder. I serve it with sticky thai rice.

Very good recipe! I made it yesterday night with a group of "first time cooks" (myself included) and it turned out great!  Received tons of compliments.  I did follow the advice of others (with regard to using 1/2 the cornstarch) and found that I still had to add a bit of water. I was also a little nervous with the way the sauce tasted after I made it, however once on the chicken and heated over the stove top for several minutes the ginger flavor really came out and the chicken was delicious!!

This recipe was good but not like the real General Tsao's Chicken you would get in a Chinese restaurant.  My kids loved it!  Next time I make it, I will double the sauce as we like sauce on our rice and cut back on the vinegar as we thought it was way too much.

Only giving it a 4 because if i had put in anywhere near what it calls for in cornstarch i probably wouldnt be able to get it out of the pan.  i used 1/4 cup and that was still to much.  Other than that it was very good.  Oh and I didnt have whole dried chilies so I used 1 1/2 tsp red pepper flakes which made it a little to spicey for me but perfect for my husband

This is a great recipe!  My family and friends have tried many versions and this recipe is by far one of the best.  I did as some others did and omitted the MSG.  I also decreased the cornstarch and increased the amount of sauce by 1 1/2 times.  I used red pepper flakes and minced onion and it turned out just fine.  I too did not bread or fry my chicken but lightly stir fried it in a tiny bit of olive oil with the red pepper and onion then added the sauce.  It was much easier and faster!!  Overall, I would definitely recommend this to anyone.  Easy, tasty and fast.

Wow! My first time trying this recipe and it turned out awesome. I feed a large crew so I used 4 1/2 lbs. of chicken and I didn't have the dried peppers so I used 2 tbs. of red pepper flakes. I was 1/2 cup shy on the green onion but made it up with shredded carrot. Everyone raved about it. It was so tongue-tingling good that my teenage son's friend asked me for the recipe.

really good as is

even better with less corn starch.

first time i made it as is.
second time i reduced corn starch as many others have. i also replace white wine vinegar with red wine vintager on a hunch one of my favorite local restaurants used it.

it's almost the best in town mybe 1 or 2 more small changes will get me there.

I really liked the way this chicken was breaded... great flavor.  I took the advice of other reviewers and didn't add all the corn starch... went with half and I can't imagine how thick this would have been with the whole thing.  Also breaded with flour instead of corn starch.  After starting the sauce and tasting, it was missing something.  Added sherry and wok oil...  but I can't figure out what it is...  possibly orange flavor.  This turned out really close to my husband's favorite take out, but we both tried unsuccessfully to make it taste "right."  Texture of the sauce with half the corn starch was dead on tho.  Make sure you watch it while you cook it because it thickens very quickly.  I did cook sauce for a while before adding chicken to keep a little crunch to the breading when serving.  Overall very tasty, but not quite what we are used to.  Will make again and try to figure out what we need to add to "fix" this.

I don't normally make Asian food, but I love getting this dish when I go out and it was just as delicious from this recipe.  I made it for a crowd and everyone was pleased.  I, too, doubled the sauce and used red pepper flakes instead of the chile peppers.  I cut out the MSG and added more cornstarch as other reviews suggested.  Perfect!

This is the only General Tsao recipe that I have tried, but it is very delicious and extremely close to what I have had in Chinese restaurants.  I did adapt the recipe and actually made General Tsao's Pork, but it was still great.  

As others have said, you must cut back on the corn starch!

I've been told there's 2 kinds of General Tsao's, apparently this is not the one I'm familiar with.  I did not enjoy it at all.  I tried to follow the recipe, but it was much too spicy for my liking (my DH enjoyed it) but the sauce tasted off and unpleasant.  I'm glad others are enjoying it more, perhaps a recipe better to my liking will be posted later.  Thanks!

Very good, but a lot of work!  Definitely need to double the sauce, but halve the cornstarch -- way too sticky.  Good with brown rice & broccoli.  Used previous reviewers advice to marinate in Texas Pete & soy sauce, and used 1 1/2 T crushed red pepper in place of the peppers; also, sauteed the chicken instead of deep-frying.  With TX Pete & crushed pepper this dish was WAY too spicy for our 17 mo old - but my husband & I will probably be fighting over the leftovers tomorrow...  Bottom line: Good, spicy, and well worth the extra work.

Very tasty! I used the suggestion of others and doubled the sauce but cut down on the amount of cornstarch and only used a 1/4 cup for the doubled recipe.  I did add a little water when thicken it because I thought that I had it too thick.

this recipe is good. i stopped breading the chicken. i don't use as much cornstarch as stated for the sauce. like other members i used a lot less. the only thing that we started to change recently is we add about 1/4 cup tomato sauce to the sauce. i think that it tastes more like the local resturants that way.

We all enjoyed this recipe with a few minor changes.  I used regular white vinegar because that's all I had and I used a full can of chicken broth no MSG.  I also used chicken thighs and added broccoli to the sauce.  Next time I may cut down on the sugar a little but we will definitely have this again.

I just made this last night and thanks to some of the other reviewers suggestions, and my own modifications, it came out great! We cut back on the cornstarch for the sauce (only used 2 TBS), used 1 TBS of red pepper flakes as opposed to the chili peppers, used vegetable stock instead of chicken stock, and used shrimp for the protein since we don't eat chicken. Taste very close, if not better than the general tso shrimp we get from our favorite Chinese restaurant!

Outstanding!  I actually didn't use any cornstarch in the sauce, and it still thickened up nice once the chicken was added.  Couldn't find whole chili peppers, so I used crushed.  Very, very good.  Much better than any restaurant in my area.  Will definitely make again, and again, and again........

I've made this recipe several times and have found that making 1.5 batches of sauce but decreasing the amount of cornstarch by 1/2 gives you a nice sauce that doesn't turn to jelly.  No MSG, pepper flakes since I can't readily get the peppers and boneless skinless thighs work best for me.  I serve it with Jasmine rice and broccoli.  My family loves this recipe.

This was good. It's my husband's favorite dish so I made it to surprise him. He enjoyed it. It wasn't too hard to make. I did cut back on the cornstarch like the other reviewers recommended. I also used flour to coat the chicken instead of cornstarch & I omitted the MSG. I served it with rice. Really good.

Awesome recipe! I too, substituted brown sugar for the granulated. I also cut back on the cornstarch. Although my husband and kids didn't think that it really tasted like General Tsao's, they gobbled it up and said that this recipe was a keeper. I will definately make it again.

Good recipe.  I followed the recipe with the exception that I used brown sugar instead of white sugar.  Not sure if this made a big difference, but I agree with a previous reviewer that there is something missing.  Taste was sorta bland. I apologize I am a novice chef, so I am not sure what to recommend to enhance flavor.

I have made this recipe twice, and the flavor is great.  However, I made a mistake the second time with the cornstarch.  For some reason, the sauce turned out extraordinarily grainy, as if the starch did not completely dissolve.  I suspect that I might have added too much, and if not, I either did not mix or cook it thoroughly.  A yummy dish!

This was great...better than any I've every had. As other reviewers suggested, I cut the cornstarch for the sauce in half. I also used 1.5 pounds of chicken with the full sauce recipe and added broccoli. Thanks!

I thought the taste was fantastic except for the over-abundance of cornstarch.  Next time I will use flour for the batter of the chicken.  I added some broccoli and mushrooms while cooking and it really added a nice touch.  I will definitely make this recipe again with the exception of the flour substitute for the batter.

This recipe tasted more like carmelized chicken.  Way too sweet and you could really taste the cornstarch.

This was a definite hit in my family! I used red pepper flakes instead of whole chili peppers, and cut down of the cornstarch. next time I would make more sauce. I will definitely make again. Thank you:)

I was disappointed in this recipe. It tasted more like sweet, sticky gravy than the Chinese sauce I've had at restaurants. I won't be making again.

For once, everyone in the family asked and were actually fighting over what was left,
This will become a family favorite!
Sauce was good, chicken was good, although prep time was a bit long, practice will speed it up, and now that everyone has had it, I am sure they will now start to hover around

this is a regular recipe for me.  i make changes to the cornstarch per others suggestions. but do think it is a laborious recipe. also, would absolutely use low sodium soy or it comes out way too salty.

It was OK at best, but a disapointment if you're looking to reproduce what you find at your favorite Chinese restaurant.  I made it exactly as written (even the MSG).  The cornstarch made the sauce gritty.  The flavor seemed a bit bland.  There was definitely something missing.  I think the coating on the chicken came out very nice and visually beautiful.  It could be saved if a better sauce were used.  I'll keep looking for a better recipe.

I thought this recipe was really good. This is my boyfriends favorite dish when we eat out. He thought it was good to. The chicken was great after it was deep fried. I put sweet and sour sauce over the chicken for her, because she does not like spicy food. And I thought that was great to. I think it could have been spicier, but I think my chilis were weak.

The reason I rated this 3 stars is ONLY because I didnt follow the recipe exactly.  I used 1.5 lb of chicken, so I halved the chicken part of the recipe, and used the full amount of sauce. This turned out WAY too thick.. I kept having to add water to it while cooking and it still didnt work. It tasted pretty good, but not exactly like take out.

I didn't have fresh ginger, so I substituted ground (I would recommend using less than 1 tsp. ground).  I also only used 3T cornstarch for the sauce, but I would cut that down as well, as the sauce was too thick for my taste.  We like lots of sauce here, so I made a full recipe of the sauce and a half of the chicken... not too bad!  I'll probably make it again, but with lots of tweaks.

Excellent!  I did decrease corn starch for sauce based on reviews.  I also only added a few few tsp's of soy sauce to the chicken and only added cornstarch until I had a tight mix.  Wonderful, will definetly make again.

This was a pretty good recipe all in all.  A bit "gingery" so next time I'll have to cut back a bit on that.  I also added some crushed red pepper to the mix while in the wok...adding that extra nip.  Following the sauce recpie to the T came out pretty thick...so if you like it thinner definitely add water as someone else mentioned.

This good.  I  tried sauteeing the chicken to keep out some fat, but it didn't work very good.  It did end tasting alright though.  I will try again and deep fry the chicken instead.

i didnt like the way this turned out. When I put the sauce mixture into the pan, it thickened right away. So when I added the chicken, it was hard to mix it all together. I had to add some water for it to mix. Also, the chicken lost its crunchiness. I found the taste to be bland and more sweet than spicey.

Yummy!  I doubled the sauce per other reviews, but felt it was too much.  I may just pour it over the chicken next time.  I substituted flour b/c of a corn allergy, and had some sticking trouble, but it turned out fine.  The oil helped a lot.  I also substituted rice wine vinegar b/c I was out of white wine vinegar.  We will definitely make this again.

This is a very nice recipe, it turned out well the first time I tried it.  However, I took a few minutes to read the comments of other, and cut back on the Cornstarch.  I also replaced the vinegar with Rice Wine.  Second time around a little more soy sause and the color was just like I'm used to seeing at the resturants.  Good recipe, just needs a little tweaking.

Wow, this is the first time I've ever given such a poor review.  I omitted the MSG and used rice vinegar in place of the white wine vinegar (didn't have any).  I used tofu instead of chicken (which came out fantastic), and was glad I didn't add the tofu to the pan of sauce.  The sauce was WAAAY too thick, even after adding an additional 1/4 cup of water at the end--reminded me of a satay sauce.  I also had only used 1/2 cup of sugar and the sauce ended up way too sweet.  I will not make this again.  I am really disappointed because General Tsao's chicken is my husband's favorite, and I was really hoping to find a fab recipe to knock his socks off. :(

good flavor, I have only had General Tsao's once before, so I can't really compare. I used my own chicken batter recipe to fry the chicken and just made the sauce.. I will make again.

I made this awhile back, and my family was not really impressed. After it sat for a few mintues, it jellied up and that was not very appitezing. It is one of those meals that doesn't keep very well. I think my family and I will stick to take-out. I followed alot of the advice in the reviews...less cornstarch, subbed red pepper flakes.

We loved this dish. If you can, get someone to help you in the kitchen. Hubby made the rice and chopped the chicken. That was quite helpful as this was a three step process to make. I didn't have enough corn starch on hand so I used some Bisquik to supplement a bit. I did only use three tablespoons for the first part and I am not sure how much for the breading. I think a little more breading makes this more of an authentic tasting dish. (and we like the breading, let's face  it... if you are making this, you are not watching what you are eating too much.) :)    
The dish was great. I felt like a "gourmet cook" due to the nature of the dish. The flavors were at three different levels we decided: sweet (from the sugar), spicy (from the sun dried chilli peppers), and the ginger really cleanses the pallate  (sp?) in between each bite. Really great and makes you feel like you are a great cook! TFTP

Excelent!  Just like ordering in.  Followed the previous suggestions of less cornstarch and sugar. Was a super good sauce.

Excellent..For us this is a keeper.  I did as some posted and cut the corn starch in half, and used pepper flacks.  But this dish is so tastey, Ive already made it twice.  Whole family loves it.

This had a pretty good flavor but it's definitely way too much cornstarch for our taste. I'll have to alter the recipe a little next time.

This is a very good, easy recipe. I followed to a t, adjusting the cornstarch. The taste of the chicken is excellent and the sauce was terrific. Very similar to our local chinese resteraunt that we love. If I could give it a 10 I would.

This is a very good and quick recipe. I have made it twice now, and both times it was a great hit. Friends and family really love this one. Once I made it without the green onions specifically for some friends who claim not to like onions. This did not seem to matter to those who have had it both ways now. 
I was impressed with how easy it was to make and with the complements that I got from all those who ate it.

I suggest that you add a bit more water to the sause. I like my sauce a little thinner. Other then that, this was a great 'order in', recipe. Very filling.

In our quest for a good homemade General Tsao's chicken, we tried this one. Unfortunately, the result had nothing to do we with what we expected. It doesn't taste at all like the General Tsao's chicken that we eat in restaurant and the consitency was very bad, not crispy at all, with a clumpy sauce even if I had cut the cornstarch to 1/4 cup as many suggested. I would partially forgive if it was tasty but we had difficulty to finish our plates. Will not make again.

This recipe was soooo good!  My husband LOVED it! Even without the sauce, the chicken was wonderful! With the sauce the chicken was even better!  I eyed all the ingrediants and did like other reviews said halved the corn starch and used black pepper and red crushed pepper flakes.  The only problem.. after my husband tried the first peice of chicken I fried, I couldn't get him to leave the kitchen! LOL! Great recipe!

My husband and i love General Tso's chicken i hope this recipe is as good as in the restaurants.  I'm going to leave out the MSG. Why do people use that stuff???  I know it's a preservative but, it can cause migraines...BAD ONES!!  Just a personal observance.  I'll definitely try this one.

This was absolutely wonderful.  The chicken was delicious without the coating usually found on the Chinese restaurant variety.

Great recipe!  The chicken is really good even without the sauce, its crispy and tasty from the soy sauce in the coating, the sauce is just like in restaurants, Be careful how much peppers you add, mine was way too hot and I love spicy food, but not the kind that burns your lips while you eat!  Also I bought white wine vinegar just to make this and I think regular vinegar or even red wine vinegar would do, has the same smell and taste and it's a small amt.  I used half the cornstarch in the sauce like others, it was perfect!

woweeeeee! This recipe was great, very much like what you would get in a restaurant.  I only made a few changes with this recipe : I too like many others used 1/4 c cornstarch in the sauce and used crused chiles instead of fresh, I had white wine and vinegar, so I used a combination of both for the sauce.  I also only used 1 tsp ginger since I'm not crazy about it.  For the ginger and garlic, I used the kind in a jar to make a little less work.  The only thing I didn't like is that I couldn't figure out how to keep the chicken crunchy after mixing it with the sauce.  I loved this recipe!

This is a very good recipe. I did what others suggested with the cornstarch, and it turned out great. I substituted the sugar with splenda and it was good but had a aftertaste so next I will just use sugar.  Thanks Shaun

AUTHENTIC! After pan frying the chicken, I put 1/2 in the freezer to use next time since there are only 2 of us.  I made the full amount of sauce and it was enough to go over the rice I served with it.  I used 3T. cornstarch for the sauce and it was the perfect consistency.  No MSG needed & red pepper flakes instead of peppers.

A little disappointed.  I did the reduction of corn starch like others had posted.  It still was starchy - gritty like.  Edible.

YUM!!!  I, too, only added 1/2 the cornstarch for the sauce, and skipped the MSG.  I only added a handful of green onions, and used red pepper flakes that we usually use for pizza.  My kids thought I had picked this up at the local Chinese place!  It will definitely be served again at my house!

This was good, but because of the great reviews, I think I had high expectations.  I followed other reviewers' directions and cut the corn starch, which was a good idea - it was thick. It was just sort of a thick, sort of weird textured sauce. I served cashews on top and I liked the contrast.  I'll try this again, but will play with the recipe a bit.

This recipe is phenomenal.  We absolutely loved it, but be warned it does not reheat well.  i also omitted the MSG and only used 2Tbsp cornstarch in the sauce.  I also cut the sugar in half.  I substituted red wine vinegar since I did not have white wine vinegar.

I used tofu instead of chicken, and I didn't fry it.  I made it twice.  The first time, I followed the recipe exactly and it was WAY too starchy.  The second time, I halved the starch, and it was still too much.  Added pineapple, though, and that took away from the starch a bit.

I've had General Tsao's Chicken many times in my life.  The sauce was the only nice part of this dish.  The chicken was the downer of the recipe.  I followed every step carefully and the chicken came out soggy and left a slick feeling in my mouth.  My mom doesn't want this dish again and I don't either!  Not worth the hassle to make again.

I just used the chicken portion of the recipe, not the sauce.  I made orange flavored chicken and it was wonderful!

Delicious!  Takes just like I picked it up at a Chinese restaurant.  I substituted shrimp for the chicken, and veggie broth for the chicken broth.   I also decreased the amount of cornstarch. I omitted the MSG, onions (didn't have any) and chili peppers, using red pepper instead. I used a frying pan instead of deep frying. I served with it a fried rice recipe found on this site.  Will definitely make this dish OFTEN...YUMMY !!!!!

This recipe is great, I only added 1/4 cup of cornstarch to the sauce, two teaspoons of crushed red peppers instead of chilis, a few tablespoons of ketchup, and some steamed brocolli. In the future, however, I might just saute the chicken to cut down on the fat content - it doesn't stay that crispy anyway when you add it to the sauce. An excellent recipe, thanks!

This is very similar to my son's favorite General Chicken at a local restaurant.  I followed previous suggestions and cut the cornstarch in half, I still had to add extra water to the sauce.  It was ok because there's plenty of flavor in the sauce, it doesn't taste watered-down.  Even if you don't like spicy sauces, I would recommend this recipe for the breading alone, it's very good.

only 3 stars because this recipe is a lot of work, and I had prepared the sauce ahead of time, but frying the chicken is sort of a pain! We'll order out next time!

I made this dish at the request of my husband.  I did make a few changes.  I omitted the ginger and instead of green onions, I used a regular white onion.  I had never had this dish before so I was not sure what it was supposed to taste like, but my husband said it was good but didn't quite taste like General Tso's chicken that he has had at restaurants.  Despite that, we both liked the recipe and I will make it again.

This recipe was awesome.  My husband loved it and 
said it was better than eating out.  I won't use as 
much cornstarch next time - didn't have enough sauce and was just a bit pasty...

I think maybe I did something wrong because I scaled the recipe down to 2 servings, but the coating on the chicken started to burn up before it was even cooked through, and the sauce turned immediately to paste when I cooked it.  The flavor was interesting, but I think you could add some vegetables to the mix.  I may try this again...

This recipe wasn't bad, but it wasn't great either. Not exactly what i'm looking for, but we all have different tastes. The sauce seemed a bit gingery, and tasted quite a bit like teriyaki only stronger soy sauce taste. Perhaps cut back on the ginger. Even adding the chicken at the last minute results in soggy pieces of chicken. Not unlike restaurant style General Tsao's, probably Cantonese style Chinese cooking, but i'm looking for safeway deli style General Tsao's. Not bad, not great.

This is a great recipe but it is quite starchy. I also decreased the amount considerably. Next time I'll do it even more so. Especially in the mix. I didn't add the MSG also but it still is the closest recipe I've found to General Tsao's which my husband loves and am grateful that I can make it with breast instead of the thighs. Thanks.

Very yummy--but sixteen peppers was a little too many and made the dish so hot that we didn't enjoy it as much as we could have.  Next time, I will use just four or so.

This recipe was a little more difficult to make then most.  It will take some practice
for us to get the sauce just right (as mentioned in other reviews, our sauce turned
out a little too thick).  The flavor was great however and we did enjoy the
dish!

I was not able to find the dried chilies so I used crushed red pepper flakes and it was awesome! It does take some time to prepare, but it is worth it.

This dish is very labor intensive, but believe me, it is WELL worth the effort.  When I order takeout, this is my number one favorite - Now, it's nice to make it at home.
