WOW! I am always a box of pudding mix away from a dessert and never have it on hand. The ingredients needed for this filling are always in my kitchen. I was in an experimental mood and scaled this recipe way down just so I could "taste" and fiddle around with this recipe. I am very glad I did. This basic vanilla pudding is just as tasty as the popular cook & serve boxed kind. Also, I spooned a small amount into a smaller dish and sprinkled a bit of Hershey's unsweetened cocoa into it. I kept adjusting until I found just the right color and taste, and BINGO: delicious chocolate pudding suitable as is or for a pie. I'm looking forward to adding a variety of different ingredients for a wider range of spectacular desserts! Thanks a lot!!

I changed my rating from a 2 star to a 5 star.  At first it is really sweet the cream, but once it is 'aged' in the fridge for at least 2 - 3 days, it really does taste like the cream filling found in the Italian Bakery cakes.  I was impressed.  Mind you, I only discovered this cause I ended up with too much cream filling that I was using for a cake.  Very impressed by discovery.

This recipe is so simple and has so many applications I can't say enough good about it and it's just delicious. I used it the first time in a trifle and it was fantastic but, my family wanted to lick the pudding bowl so now we make it as a simple homemade dessert, would never consider box pudding when this is just as easy and so much better tasting, thank you for sharing.

This pie filling is excellent so easy to make and tastes wonderful.I made the best banana cream pie with this and a coconut pie too and everyone loved them.And there was also enough left over to give to my 6 month old granddaughter as a vanilla pudding and she loved it.This is a great alround pie filling/pudding recipe.

This is DELICIOUS, I follow the cooking instructions exactly and it sets up perfectly with no lumps without fail.  My favorite variation so far has been (for the 8 serving version) adding a square of semi-sweet bakers chocolate to the milk mixture and substituting peppermint extract for the vanilla extract at the end.

This came out good except for a couple of my own mistakes.  I should have simmered it a little longer once it was all together as it didn't set up quite a well as I would have liked it to.  Also, I made a Chocolate Banana Pie with this recipe, and I don't think that the extra sugar is really necessary.  It was very sweet as it was.  Just my preference though.  Very good.  Thank you.

Tried this recipe today after a failed attempt with another recipe yesterday and it came out great! It would be great for many types of pies, Especially coconut cream. I was only making one pie and fearing that it would end up like my previous recipe, I scaled this one down from 16 serving to 4, and it made MORE than enough for one pie, so even if you cut this in half, you'll have some left over (which isn't a bad thing because it is fantastic). I did change the process of cooking like a few others have noted to avoid lumps: 
-First mix milk, sugar, cornstarch & salt in pan first, then bring to boil. This will prevent lumps from forming. The cornstarch and sugar need to dissolve before heat is brought into the picture. 
-Then whisk eggs in a bowl, temper (this means to add some of the hot liquid to the eggs so they do not cook to fast when adding to the whole pan and you don't end up with scrambled eggs in your pie)with milk mixture.
-Add in a steady stream to milk mixture and continue cooking for 5 minutes. 
-Remove from heat and add butter and vanilla.
-Let cool before putting in pie crust, cover with plastic wrap (to avoid a film from forming over the top) and let set for a few hours or overnight in refrigerator.

I made recipe for just one pie. I used 2 yolks and because I was a little short on cornstarch I supplemented with powdered sugar and cut back slightly on granulated sugar. Not big differences. I altered the cooking method slightly as I have not had luck with adding boiling milk to egg mixtures so I mixed all and simmered slowly to thicken stirring constantly and added butter and vanilla at the end. The result is an amazing tasting sweet cream!! This is my new recipe for any cream pie/pudding. Thanks!

This is such an easy and tasty base recipe for pudding or pie filling.  I made mine chocolate by adding cocoa powder, and I didn't even have to adjust the sugar.  Once you try this one, you'll never go back to boxed mix.  The only thing I will make sure and do next time is sift my dry ingredients, because there were little clumps of corn starch and cocoa throughout the pudding.

This has to be one of the best recipes on allrecipes.  I used this for a banana cream pie.  It made enough for a 11x14 pan and I still had some left over!  I was worried about it getting so thick as I cooked it, but I kept stirring for the 5 minutes per instruction and it was great.  The second day was the best, next time I will make the pie a day before and let it set.  SO AMAZING.  It tasted like Marie Calendars.

Absolutely fantastic! I have just made it for Old Years Eve. I left out the white sugar and added a 1 tbs of brown because I added white chocolate to the mixture while boiling. A need to know fact... you have to stir the mixture very fast when adding the corn starch otherwise you will get lumps. I served the cream in waffle ice-cream cones with marshmallows, shaved Cadbury's milk chocolate and home made caramel (from condensed milk). Decadent! South Africans add cinamon and the pie is then called Meltert or Milk Tart

Terrific recipe! Made it to eat just as pudding and it was fantastic! A little sweet for my taste but I'll just cut back the sugar next time. Texture was lovely. This one's a keeper!

yum yum yum! This is an excellent recipe and easy to make too! It's great because it can be made a bit 'firmer' for a pie filling or softer for just some pudding. So tasty, smooth and creamy.

Fantastic!  Scaled recipe down to a fourth ... perfect for dear hubby & I.  Love the process of combining the sugar and cornstarch with the egg ... I usually combine it with the milk first.  Found this method to be much easier in controlling the temp of the eggs.  Thanks so much for recipe!

I found this pie to be very slimy. All the cornstarch made for an awful texture. When the filling was still warm it was ok, but when it cooled it was a disgusting texture. It was also enough filling for 4 pies! It weighed so much my husband had to carry it!
For people that like this recipe... I made it in a 13x9 pan which was bigger than 2 pie shells and worked out because I was out of pie plates. I also took some filling aside and added powdered cocoa to it and made it a chocolate swirl pie.

I was skeptical of making this as I have made many pastry or vanilla creams and this one seemed to simple-how could it be good, right?  It is delicious! I will even use this in my pastry tarts. Look no further for a simple and delicious vanilla cream?

The recipe was easy to follow, I followed it exactly.  The taste was okay but I didn't really care for the texture.  I was not alone in my opinion, 4 of the other five people who tried it agreed.

Made this last night and my first thought was that the dry ingred would be lumpy when added.  They were a little bit but I used a whisk and they all came out.  I used choc chips to make mine chocolate because they melt so easily with no lumps.  I did think the filling was a little starch tasting before I added the choc chips.  I may decrease corn starch a little next time.  Once the chips were added and the filling cooled, the starch taste seemed to go away.  It set up so beautifully, I had enough for two pies plus 3 big servings of pudding.  I used a graham cracker crust with a layer of peanut butter crumbles (conf sugar & peanut butter) on the bottom and on top.  I am serving it tonight as other reviewers thought it was better the next day.  I make pies every week, cream and fruit and this one so far is a keeper.  Unless the entire thing falls apart when I cut it, it is one of the best cream pie recipes I have used.

Great flavour and consistency!!!  I've tried original and chocolate versions - equally great!  Just be careful not to overcook or it will be too thick.

Phenomenal recipe! Very easy to make with things that are usually in my kitchen.  Great as a pie filling, equally great as a bowl of pudding!

Wow! Great flavor and consistency. Not too sweet and not at all bland. I made no changes, using this for a banana cream pie. Thank you for the submission!!

Love this.  Made it dairy free (parve) with almond and soy milk.  I used one quart of soy milk, one good cup of sugar, 3 egg yolks, and 3/4 c of corn starch. 2 T margarine and 1 tsp salt, vanilla extract.  Going to top it with fresh strawberries!

Loved this!! I only used 1 cup and a bit of sugar and all flavors were there...still a tad sweet. When I added the egg and cornstarch mixture back to the milk after tempering the mixture quickly thickened within 2 min. I think I will use almost a cup of cornstarch as it was very thick when removed from heat. Made this to put in tart shells...WILL DEFINATELY USE AGAIN!! THANKS

I used this recipe instead of instant pudding for the Banana cream pie #3 recipe on this site. Exactly the amount needed and i even tried this recipe once with rice milk! It still worked out and tasted great, just a little clearer in color than with regular milk.

It made SOOOOOOOO much custard! I was using it as a cake layer and had a TON of it left over. It also was just OK on its own... with cake or pastry, it is delicious. Maybe I'm just not a huge pudding fan. Would give it 3.5 stars, but can't on this rating system.
