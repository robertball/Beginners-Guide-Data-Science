Thank you so much for posting this recipe! While reading it you had me at Parmesan & Gruyere! I had no qualms trying this recipe with no reviews because between the ingredients you listed and your instructions (refrigerating the dough, oven temp etc) I knew exactly what to expect for texture (similar to sugar cookie dough) & flavor (salty, nutty tang). “Deliciousness”!! I followed recipe to a T & it was lovely! Subsequent batches I played with different spice/herb combinations & all were successful. You really can’t go wrong with such a great recipe, it’s wonderful as is or with small tweaks if you’re craving garlic or cumin or rosemary or fennel, you get the idea lol!
