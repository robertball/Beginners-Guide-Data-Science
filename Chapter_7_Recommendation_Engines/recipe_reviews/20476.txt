Can't be easier than this!  I needed some pumpkin pie spice for a Pumpkin Cranberry bread (also from this site) and voila!  I increased the amounts to make 8x as much so that I have plenty on hand.

Man what a lifesaver! ... There is the Pumpkin Crunch Cake on here that I wanted to make for my family dinner tonight ... calling for
'pumpkin pie spice' ... you think I can find it anywhere in any of the grocery stores! 
Thanks Jacque!

This sure beats buying it! You can adjust the amounts to find the perfect flavor you're looking for, and it's easy to double or triple to keep some on hand.

Terrific! I was making some muffins and needed pumpkin pie spice, which I discovered after I started that I was out, so I found this recipe and made my own. I doubled this since I needed a T worth. This was super in my muffins and my husband loved them. This was perfect for my needs, thanks Jacquie!!! Now I don't even need to buy the premixed spice ever again now that I know how to do it myself. You just saved me several dollars.

Quick and easy recipe for pumpkin pie spice. No need to buy it from the store; make your own! I already had all the individual spices in my cupboard so it was that much easier.I tripled the batch and stored the rest in a spice bottle. Great recipe!

Perfect pumpkin pie spice - The only additional I made was 1/4 teaspoon of allspice to complete the palette. Additionally, you can toast the spice until it just starts to smoke a bit (not BURN it), as it will bring out the rich flavors of the individual spices.

Thanks for a great recipe! To make it easier, I scaled the recipe to 8 servings and measured everything onto a folded sheet of clean paper; then you can just dump the pile into your spice jar, no mess! Shake and Bake!

Perfect blend!  I used this in the "spiced slow cooker applesauce" recipe on this site.  I will use this often.  Thank you for sharing your recipe.

This spice is not just for pumpkin pie. Since I've made this two weeks ago, I've used this spice on so many things. I've put it on oatmeal, applesauce, sprinkled it on my cappuccino, on ice cream, and used it for my pumpkin spice cookies. I'm sure I'll find many more uses for it. It makes everything taste like Autumn.

Very unhappy with this one.  I would call it Gingerbread spice.  My pumpkin bread tastes like gingerbread .

I have used this recipe for years for pumpkin bread, pumpkin cheesecake, and all yummy things pumpkin.  Much less expensive than buying the premade spice.  I substitute allspice for the clove because I don't ground clove on hand.  Works perfectly.  Thanks for sharing!

I have all the individual spices that go into this blend in my spice collection anyhow-why spend addt'l money on the mix too?  I increased the yield to fill an empty spice container I had.  Tastes no different to me than if I had spend the $4 or whatever on it at the market, and it adds more home-made-ness to your cooking!

I used this recipe instead of the Pumpkin Pie Spice One because this one included cloves. I would have rated it 5 stars, but this one left out allspice.  I added 1/8 t. allspice to the recipe.  I filled my empty container of store bought pumpkin spice with this fresh mixture.  Smells devine!

AR's recipe search, this recipe and more than 100 great reviews was a big help to me today. I don't have nearly the selection of spices here at our place in Naples as I do at home and wasn't surprised to see I didn't have Pumpkin Pie Spice when I needed it for a recipe,Libby's Pumpkin Cranberry Bread. Scaling the recipe to 6 servings and adding 1/4 tsp. cinnamon was just the perfect amount.  Thank goodness for this reference recipe!

Great! This came in handy as I needed this for another recipe on this website. It was easy to put together and simple as I had the seasoning ingredients on hand. This is a nice blend of spices that I used for, "Pumpkin Bundt Cake," also on this website. Thank you for sharing.

This is a great money and hassle saver.  I've compared lots of pumpkin pie spice recipes, and I like the relatively high proportion of cinnamon in this one; personally, I don't like to be overpowered by nutmeg or ginger.  I used this to make pumpkin cranberry bread, and it turned out great.

I always used the Libby's pumpkin pie recipe, which lists the spices, so never even knew there was such a thing as "pumpkin pie spice" till I started seeing it called for in other recipes.  I am so glad to be able to make my own; I NEVER buy "convenience" items if I can help it.

This was great, but it didn't make very much, next time I will increase the serving size drastically.

This is perfect.  Thanks for posting.  I did put the servings up to 30 and it made a nice bottle of spice for this time of year.

I was glad to find this recipe here.  It doesn't make a lot of sense to buy it at the store when you have all the ingredients in your spice collection.  I used it to make Pumpkin muffins and the smell/flavor was very good.

Easy (less than two minutes) and has the same ingredients as the organic pumpkin pie spice I buy that costs 6 or 7 bucks a bottle.  I use pp spice all the time, in my coffee, my pancakes, etc., and this will save me a fortune!  I multiplied the recipe easily by 8, which filled to about 2/3 the jar from the store, which was empty, and which I will never buy again.  Thanks!!!

Thank you so much for this!  This recipe is extremely easy to make in bulk, and around this time of year, the price of pumpkin pie spice in the store is definitely ridiculous.

I always make seasonal "spices" like this (that require a combination of spices) myself.  That way I only have what I need on hand and I'm not buying something I technically already have.  Thanks for the recipe.

I used this today, adding an equal amount of allspice as cloves, and so far, it tastes infinitely better than the jarred stuff. Although that being said, the jarred stuff does not have cloves in it.

I loved the fact that this recipe made a just enough for one pie, so you are not left with a container that may sit until the next big holiday or perhaps even the next year. I added allspice to the mix and if I had ground mace I would have added that too (about 1/4 tsp). As I am not a huge pumpkin pie fan; this spice mixture was a wonderful addition to my Oatmeal Pumpkin Pancakes. Thank you Jacquie for sharing this recipe!

Maybe it is just me, but I felt this had too much ginger and clove.  I would reduce both of those by half to better suit my tastes.  I used this in a pumpkin muffin recipe.

I halve the recipe and go a little heavier on the ginger and allspice ... using 1/2 t cinnamon, 1/4 t ginger, 1/8 t allspice/cloves, and 1/8 t nutmeg ... making 1 t pumpkin pie spice.

Perfect blend of spices at a fraction of the cost you would pay for it at the supermarket. I always have these spices in my cupboard. I have never bought pumpkin pie since.

Thanks, I will never buy pumpkin pie spice now. I have no idea how this compares to purchased pumpkin pie spice, but it was a delicious combo in my applesauce, so it's a winner for me!

Tastes great!! To use in ice coffee, first mix a tbsp into an ounce of warm water to help dissolve into a sort of syrup. Then sure into your coffee.

I’ve tried a lot of different recipes and this one is the closest to perfection.  When I use the Libby ratio, my husband always says “more nutmeg, less clove”.  (However, I like ginger so I increase the ginger to 1/2.  Personal preference).  We use it in our oatmeal or simple syrup for coffee.  Also, great for baking by subbing in anywhere there is cinnamon.

Easy good mix of pumpkin pie spices. I used 1/8 teaspoon of it with 1/8 teaspoon of almond extract to 1/2 cup powdered sugar and 2 teaspoons of water to ice a pumpkin almond cranberry bread for Thanksgiving.

I reduced sugar to 2 cups  and used Libby’s pure pumpkin instead. The result was perfect - moist and just the right amount of spice and sweet.

I made this pumpkin pie spice for a pumpkin spiced latte and it turned out perfectly. Both the pumpkin pie spice and the latte were so yummy, I will definitely be making the spice and the latte again.
So easy so yummy.

Addition to consider... a touch of Allspice, to suit your taste.  I have found Allspice useful, now a  spice pantry staple for me, as I expand my Oriental cooking.

Great mix!  My recipe for pumpkin pie called for twice as much as what this recipe makes so I doubled up the amounts but I made a small change in my second batch; instead of 1/8 tsp clove I used 1/8 tsp of all spice.

This recipe tastes more like gingerbread spice. Fortunately it tastes alright in the pumpkin cranberry recipe I made, but I wouldn't recommend it or use it again for pumpkin recipes. Thanks for sharing.

Great pumpkin pie spice mix.  Better than any I have ever purchased.  A nice blend of spices.  No one spice over powers the other.  Only makes about 2 tsp.  Will double the recipe next time.   Used in AR Mrs. Sigg's Fresh Pumpkin Pie which calls for 2 & 1/2 tsp pumpkin pie spice.

Perfect spice mixture! I make a larger batch and keep in a spice jar. In addition to adding it to the pie mixture I sprinkle a bit on top before popping it into the oven for an extra oomph - not just taste wise but visually it looks great!

Tried both single and double servings in pies from scratch(had lots of pumpkins this year!) and the single serving was just barely flavoured.  Great balance, but small quantity. I recommend you double the amounts per pie.

This recipe turned out very well, I mixed it with unsweetened almondmilk and oatmeal. The only change I made was I added 1/8 teaspoon of allspice. Delicious!

No complaints here!  I never buy pre-mixed spices so I wasn't prepared when a recipe called for Pumpkin Pie Spice.  This worked perfectly, Allrecipes to the rescue again!

Good, and convenient since I had all of these spices anyway, but I think this one might have been a bit clove-y for me. I tripled it and it's possible that proportions that work well in small quantities don't work as well in large. I'll either look for a clove-less recipe or reduce them next time. Thanks!

I prefer to make my own spices with what I have on hand in the cupboard, rather than to go out and buy an extra spice,these are the days when you save where you can.  I have used this time and again,and make extra to give to my girls and grand kids when they are in the baking mood. Thank you for your recipe, it is much appreciated and very useful.

This is wonderful. I needed pumpkin pie spice to make Gingersnap Dip. Thought I'd have to go to the store, but I'll never buy pumpkin pie spice again.

perfect measurements for a great spice! i increased servings to 10 and made enough to fill a baby food jar half-way. i did as someone else suggested and put mixed spice on a piece of paper to get it neatly inside the jar and it worked perfectly! thanks for saving me the $5 it cost to buy at the store!

I had everything for a recipe I wanted to make except the pumpkin pie spice. I'm so glad I was able to did this recipe so I didn't have to go to the store. Definitely worth a try if you are in a pinch or if you just don't want to buy an unnecessary spice.

TYVM!  The stores were all out of pumpkin pie spice, but I had all of these ingredients on hand.  I also added 1/8 t of allspice.  We multiplied it by 5 and were able to save a lot for later batches of pumpkin cranberry bread (from this site).

I tripled this recipe for use in the "Libby's Pumpkin Cranberry Bread" on this site.  I think the ginger amount of was a bit strong, so I added a little more cinnamon and nutmeg. It'll do in a pinch!  Thanks for the recipe!

I didn't have any pumpkin pie spice to use in the Chocolate Pumpkin Dessert Cake, but I doubled this recipe and used it for the cake and it turned out great. I'm sure I'll use this from now on as it is so much easier than buying yet another spice to use maybe once a year.
