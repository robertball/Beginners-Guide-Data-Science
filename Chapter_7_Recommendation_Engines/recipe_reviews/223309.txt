As written, this recipe is OFF. I should know, made this recipe 3x. I know most would have stopped at once. But I really wanted this recipe to work & after the third time, it finally did. As written, the recipe, is gritty, oily & a flop. BUT the flavor is there & that's why I took such an interest in perfecting this recipe. When making the recipe the 1st time, a huge issue, don't let the recipe start bubbling, the sugar does not break down or melt in with the chocolate and peanut butter, like you think it would. And if you let the mixture bubbly, you will get an aroma of burnt peanuts. Not a good thing. And I was on that pot like a hawk. Even the 2nd time around, same thing. The other thing is that there was soo much oil at even 1/2 cup with the amount of sugar, the oil never retain & oozed to the point that it was frying the sugar as it was baking in the pan & causing the gritty-ness that you could feel, taste and see. Both 1st two batches, glopped, couldn't be cut into squares, even completely cooled due to the excess of oil. When making the 3rd batch by cutting the oil to 1/4 cup, became a batch of brownies. It still had a slight oily residue left but no where near the 1st two batches. I can tell you, the oil might be even lowered to 2-3 TBSPs but as for modifying this recipe to make it work..lower the oil or you won't have a successful batch to enjoy. The 3rd batch was awesome! Glad I was persistant and got to enjoy a batch! As is 0 stars, as modified 5 star.

First of all, I did not make this recipe because it was vegan, I made it because it is a Myplate sponsored recipe. After reading the reviews, I decided to leave the oil out entirely. The recipe author said that the avocado replaced butter in this recipe, so I couldn't wrap my head around the need for any more oil if it was a replacement for oil. There is enough "oil" with the combination of the avocado, peanut butter and chocolate chips. Next, I halved the recipe and made it in an 8x8 baking dish. I used regular 1% milk in place of the soy milk (Again, not looking for this to be vegan) and doubled the amount called for. I didn't bother with "cooking the chocolate, sugar and pb until bubbly like candy"...I simply melted the pb with the chocolate chips in the microwave. I think cooking melted chocolate chips to this degree of heat would cause the chocolate to seize, giving you a gritty texture. I used my magic bullet to combine the milk and the avocado and then combined the rest of the ingredients in a large bowl (including the sugar, which I reduced to 1/2 cup for half this recipe). I added the melted chocolate/pb, the avocado/milk, a 1/2 tsp of vanilla extract and the flour mixture together and combined until just mixed. I baked them for about 20 -25 minutes in an 8x8" pan and they came out really nice. Not greasy at all. Smooth and fudgy. With my changes, it's a 4 star, but giving it a 3 star because clearly, as written, something is not right.

I'm not vegan, but wondering why white sugar is included in this recipe?  I'm pretty sure that is not an acceptable form of sweetener for vegans, due to the charcoal used in the manufacturing. I use vegan recipes to specifically avoid white sugar, but found it here.  Please correct me if I'm wrong! :)

This recipe was absolutely AMAZING. As other reviewers suggested, I nixed the oil completely. I also only used 1 cup of brown sugar and no salt ("healthy" brownies) and I used almond milk instead of soy. HEAVENLY. I only recently started cooking vegan, so I know what normal brownies taste like. These are comparable if not better! And less guilty! They're perfectly flavored, extremely moist but not too heavy, and delightfully fudgey. I could rave on! Mine are only 245 calories a brownie. I will definitely be making these again!!!!

Since the first review I wrote has mysteriously disappeared, I will try again.  As written this recipe is just this side of indelible. If the avocado is to replace butter then why add oil?  As I originally stated, I melted my peanutbutter chocolate mixture slowly, in a double boiler and reduced the sugar to 1 cup.  This will eliminate the graininess.  3/4 cup of sugar is probably enough.  All in all, I am surprised this recipe is included in the My Plate collection.

These were OK the day that they were made but seemed really greasy and crumbly. However, they were incredible after refrigeration. Great flavor and texture after being in the fridge. Really rich and fudgy.

Following changes recommended by ReneePaj  (additionally, I used the whole avocado in the half recipe and forgot the vanilla) made these brownies deliciously fudgy. They are quite dense.

This recipe is wonderful!!! I have made it so many times I can almost make it without the recipe! My grandparents and one of my cousins are vegan and they just love them! I half the oil and then add an extra 1-3 tablespoons of flour, this makes the brownies nice and thick as well as soft and chewy! :) the rest of the recipe is just fine however.
Enjoy! :)

I was getting all excited about making these until I saw that this recipe calls for Canola Oil.  I am one who normally would change the ingredients because I only eat organic, but, just to know that this recipe is here and promoting the use of unhealthy and heart damaging Canola oil I couldn't even consider making these - yuck!!

I followed the suggestions made by ReneePaj and the brownies were absolutely delicious! Very fudgy and smooth. I highly recommend looking at her review and following the recommendations to omit oil and cut the sugar to only 1/2 cup!

I wasn't necessarily lookin for a vegan recipe, but was very interested in trying it with avocado.  I read the reviews and omitted the oil all together.  I made a few changes only for personal preference.  Since I wasn't necessarily looking for a vegan recipe I used unbleached white flour instead of the whole wheat.  I used dark brown sugar and cut it in half, instead of white sugar and I used butterscotch chips instead of chocolate.  Im not sure how these changes affected this being vegan, but they were so delicious that everyone ate all my brownies.  I am looking forward to experimenting with different flavors.

I gave it four stars because I left out the oil like everyone said and they came out great! So people who are going to make this be warned! Do not use oil the avocado is enough! I will defiantly make these again!

I baked for the 20 minutes the recipe called for.  It was oily.  Baked it nearly 30 minutes more in 10 min. increments.  Still oily each time.  falling apart like sand.

I definitely cut the sugar in half and cut out most of the oil... I think I just did about 2 Tbs. Added a couple Tbs extra flour as well. Recipe should be modified or a new one added with those changes. Do that, and they’ll turn out great!

I did not add the extra oil and only used on cup of sugar but made the recipe exactly the same otherwise. I only melted the chips peanut butter and sugar together on the stove and did not cook any additional time. My vegan son LOVED them and my non vegan relatives did too. Everyone was super impressed with how moist and fudgy these brownies were.
