This is one of the best frostings I have EVER had!  So delicious!  I used it on fresh bananna cake with a vanilla custard filling.  Thank you!  I think this would also be delicious on a butter cookie or chocolate cake.  It's almost like a bannana version of the frosting used for german chocolate cake.

This frosting is super delicious!  It was easy, but just difficult mixing. I gradually creamed together 2 cups of the sugar with the softened butter and it was stiff instead of light & fluffy. So I blended in the banana and then added the remaining sugar gradually until smooth. It was the perfect topping to the banana cake I found at this site.  The coconut made all the difference in giving my cake other flavor than just banana.  I will use this recipe again and again.  Thank you.

This was even more amazing than I thought it was going to be. I only used half of the amount of powdered sugar since the banana cupcakes I was putting it on were plenty sweet. I also used walnuts instead because I prefer them. DEFINATELY toast the coconut and the nuts before you add them it! It adds the best flavor! Be careful not to whip it too much because the banana starts to separate from the butter. To solve this I threw the nuts and coconut in while they were still warm, which melted it all back together. Then I put it in the fridge until it cooled down and was a spreadable consistancy. I frosted 22 cupcakes and still had some leftover.

This frosting is SO easy and it tastes GREAT (it tastes even better the next day). My 4 yr old and I had a great time making it for his Grannies Birthday Cake, especially mashing up the banana.  I will never buy frosting from a tub again!

I did half the recipe for a square cake. I was looking for a frosting to save a rather unsweet banana crumb cake. This frosting worked good for that. I used chopped walnuts as thats what was in the cake. I thought it was rather tasty and suitable before the coconut and nuts were added. I might try it again in the future without them. But, I also prefer a smoother frosting.

This frosting is absolutely delicious. I used it on top of the banana cupcakes from this site and everyone loved it. I didn't mix the pecans and coconut into the frosting, I just sprinkled them on top. Perfect. Thanks for the great recipe.

I made this frosting for the Black chocolate Cake (also from allrecipes).  It was really good together!  I left out the coconut and pecans (because i didn't have any) and it turned out really good with great banana flavor :)

Delicious! Made on top of banana cupcakes. Was a hit! I creamed butter and half the sugar. Then added bananas, pecans and coconut. Then added in sugar to taste. :)

I made this as written, but left out the nuts and coconut as I wanted straight up banana flavor only. Very flavorful, thick & creamy... and it covered my 9x13 cake perfectly.

Such an easy recipe! I used half the amount of confectionery sugar, since I did not want it so sweet. It tasted wonderful, and was so light and fluffy. A perfect mate to the banana cake!

I really like this frosting and others did as well. It was a bit sweet though I might have to cut back on the sugar next time.

Toooooooooooo Sweeeeet! Frostings never turn out good for me, and this one was toooooo sweet! Only one person in the family liked it- the person I baked it for suggested scraping the frosting off (WAH!) My tastebuds are fried from tasting, so I can't tell the difference between sweet and not sweet anymore.

Probably good for people who're used to sweet frosting. Not good for me. Sorry!

I halved this recipe and used it as filling for the cake in the Banana Cake VI recipe on this site.  Delicious combination.  I made a couple of minor changes, substituting walnuts for pecans, and using additional confectioner's sugar to make a stiffer frosting since I was decorating the remainder of my cake with buttercream.  In the interest of time, I didn't toast the nuts or coconut as I had planned, but I can only imagine that would make an out-of-this-world combination with a good banana cake, and I'll prepare it that way next time.

Loved it! A little to stiff to make fluffy but microwaving  it for 30 sec made a easy to mix and frost cake. Love the flavor with the coconut added.

Excellent. So easy! I only used 3 c sugar (started with two since everyone was saying it ends up being too sweet, but found it wouldn't get airy & fluffy with only 2 c sugar). Didn't add coconut or nuts to mix, but sprinkled chopped pecans on after frosting. Put it on banana coconut pineapple muffins. Delicious and easy. Thank you!

I thought this was good (and so did the little guy)! I did change up how it's mixed up though...I creamed the mashed banana and butter together first, mixed in the vanilla and then began to add the confectioners' sugar, it just made more sense to do it this way, IMO. I wanted to pipe this onto cupcakes, so I didn't add the nuts or coconut to the frosting, but after piping it onto the cupcakes I sprinkled them with the nuts and coconut. Really great flavor, but it is pretty sweet, so be warned of that. I would make this again. It was nice to try something different for a change! Thanks for sharing. :)

I felt like it was very very sweet! 4 cups of confectioners' sugar was too much and even after cutting it down it was still very thick & sweet for me. I really wanted to like this one because it's so unique and the perfect filling for a monkey shaped cake I made for my son's b-day.

Used 3 cups of icing sugar instead of 4.  I found that the banana seperated from the icing (my fault I think - I might have over-beaten it), but I put it in the fridge to harden a bit and all was well.  Love the crunch of the pecans and the mild coconut flavour.  Yum!!

YUMMY!!! I must say though it's very sweet!  I didn't use coconut because I didn't have any so I added crushed walnuts instead.  I can't imagine if I had added the flaked coconut from my super market because I'm sure I would've found a tooth cavity :o) But it was delicious!!!  I will make this again!!!

AMAZING...I think that sums it up! Honest, it was the best frosting (especially for a banana cake) that I have ever tasted.  The coconut really puts a yummy twist to the flavour. Thanks for sharing this delicious recipe!
