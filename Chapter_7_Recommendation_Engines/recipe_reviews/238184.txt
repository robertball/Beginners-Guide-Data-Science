This is a very good rice to serve with spicy foods.  The coconut flavour is not too overpowering as in those recipes that call for shredded coconut.  I rinsed my rice, to eliminate some of the starch, before cooking.  I will definitely be making this again.  Thanks for sharing!

I added juice from one lime and cut up some fresh cilantro and added both in for the last few minutes that it was on the stove. I found myself adding water one tablespoon at a time towards the end of the 20 minutes because the liquid had cooked out but the rice was still firm. Adding water and cooking a little longer helped to get it to the desired firmness. Tasted great though! Topped it with fresh avocado and peppercorn crusted seared ahi tuna with a spicy remoulade sauce!!!!

Excellent with a spicy curry - just the kind of side-dish you want to soak up the curry and tamper off some of the heat!

Turned out exactly as I hoped. The rice was slightly sweet and just a little sticky with a mild coconut flavor that won't overpower your main dish (but enough to know you're eating coconut rice).  I added a few sprinkles of kosher salt when serving to boost the flavor.

I agree about the flavor-- balanced and not overpowering. It was super easy to make the cooking time was right on. Can't ask for much more. Served mine with mango and cilantro and Swai with coconut  sauce from this site.

We were disappointed with the lack of flavor. If we are eating coconut rice we want to know there is coconut in it.

Quick and simple recipe, I sometimes substitute coconut cream instead of milk which gives added sweetness or add ginger and garlic, tastes so good!

I have to disagree with the people saying this wasn't strong enough on the coconut, I thought it was perfect! I paired it with some turmeric chicken and they went together perfectly.

I made this and gave it  5 stars because I made a small change, yet it was still great. I left out the sugar, and just added everything and cooked it. I also rinsed the rice 3 times before cooking. Yummy!!
Normally, I just cook it with only Coconut Milk and nothing else. It gives it a strong,  yummy,  coconut flavor. I tried this because I wanted something toned down tonight. This was a little on the mellow side., and hit the spot.

First time trying this recipe.  It was awesome.  The only adjustment I made was to add some chopped fresh cilantro after it was done cooking.  Served it with Terriyaki chicken and everyone raved about it.  Definitely a keeper.

The rice was very good but didn't have as much coconut flavor as I thought it was going to. Maybe it was because I used low fat coconut milk. I added some sweetened coconut to it and that made a big difference. Lots of rice leftovers!
