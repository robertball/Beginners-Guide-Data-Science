I used 4 cloves garlic and sardines in olive oil (drained), and 4 TB tomato and basil pasta sauce.  My husband (who is not a fish fan) absolutely loved it!  I loved not only the taste, but it was very quick to prepare!

If you're looking for an easy,cheap, but unusual meal, this is it!(...if you like sardines) I altered the recipe to use what I had on hand. Instead of the sardines in tomato sauce, I added sardines in olive oil ,one small tomato, 2 t of tomato sauce, and a splash of red wine.I cooked less pasta to serve two, so it was probably a lot more "sardiney" than the original recipe. I'll definately make it again!

This was a good recipe to use some leftover pasta and a few scraps from the cupboard and fridge, and made a decent lunch for two. I added some leftover black olives and reconstituted sundried tomatoes, upped the garlic and threw in some carrot matchsticks for balance and appearance.  I like the distinct taste of seafood that you get, but I think canned sardines are not substantial enough to provide the texture and spectrum of flavor that you expect from seafood pasta. My boyfriend said that it would be great without the "mystery meat" qualities of the sardines. This is a great base recipe, and I think I may try again and add some rinsed canned shrimp or some leftovers from a seafood dinner.  Final verdict: this is a nice filling $2 meal (less if leftovers/scraps) but don't expect the world from it.

A word of caution: canned sardines will stink up your house when heated (if you've ever been to a wharf in the summer, you know the smell).  Prepare some scented candles/inscense if expecting company.

Really good! I used sardines in soybean oil, and just skipped the whole tomato bit, and it still came out fine. Also, when the sardines are in the pan, you can either stir them a lot as they heat and they can turn into a mushier sauce, or just gently turn them for more large chunks of fish in your dish. Either way- delicious! I didn't have any onion, but I added half a cup of chopped fresh parsley and the parmesan straight into the pan when the flavors "absorb." SO tasty!!

I actually thought I invented this recipe))) I have it probably every couple weeks since there are usually lots of canned sardines in olive oil in my pantry))) No lemon,onion and garlic for me though but I add some lettuce/cabbage for crunch. Very versatile like any pasta dish - you can add any veggies you want and if you don't like tomato sauce just use plain sardines in olive oil. Also almost any cheese would do. With whole wheat pasta even healthier!

The lemon juice makes this dish!  I never would have thought to use lemon juice, but it tasted really plain, blah, before adding it.  Used inexpensive herring in hot tomato sauce, two cans for two servings (can says one serving per can).

I like this meal, even though I don't love it and wouldn't serve it to company. But it's darn tasty for something that cooks up in 20 minutes from inexpensive pantry staples, and it's a good base for whatever leftovers you want to use up. Seriously- almost anything you can imagine eating with pasta works well here. Bell pepper, eggplant, zucchini, mushrooms, sausage, it all works.

Completely enjoyed this. Modifications: Add saunce on top of noodles instead of mixing. Used liquid pepper instead of flakes. Add teaspoon of oyster sauce and balsamic to mix.

I'm one of those straight-out-of-the-tin sardine lovers, so this was a good dish to try. This recipe is a good base, but I prefer it to have more of a kick--I added several tablespoons of canned pasta sauce that included hot peppers. I think the quality of the dish depends on the brand of sardines used. Some brands may not actually have sardines, but herring and other types of fish.

Excellent! Used one can of sardines in soy oil and one can of sardines in tomato sauce. Added two fresh tomatoes, some basil, onions, garlic, and a dab of tomato paste. Super quick. Thanks!

Very delicious dish. I give it 4 of 5 stars because i think it called for too much garlic & onion.  it seemed to overpower the dish. I think using half the garlic & onion in this recipe would be just fine. I used the sardines in olive oil and added some sliced cherry tomatoes and 2 tablespoons of marinara sauce - it was delicious and unique - I will be making this again!!!

This was very good. I used the sardines in tomato sauce but there really was hardly even a sauce so expect an olive oily type sauce. I had to add a bit of the pasta cooking water to sauce it a bit more. I also added some parsley from the garden. Reminds me of tuna puttanesca. Served with a caesar salad with homemade croutons and it was the perfect side.

Very nice! I used sardines in olive oil and  added canned tomatoes. I also was lucky enough to have kalamata olives on hand, which really made the dish a 10!

This was easy to make and very basic, a great way to incorporate this healthy fish into your diet.  We used sardines in cayenne olive oil - next time I would use the tomato sauce ones.  

My bf loved it.  I just can't get past the potent sardine smell.  But I ate it - and the flavor was not bad.  I added some garlic salt and lots of red pepper flakes.

Good recipes. Try using the sardines in lemon sauce it does not stink up the house when cooked. Then add a little pasta sauce.

I bought several cans of cheap "sardines" in soy oil a while back, before realizing that you get what you pay for when it comes to sardines (actually they are larger herring). You are better off paying a bit more for bristling sardines that don't smell and taste terrible. I made this recipe in an effort to use up some of my left over low quality sardines. While it was still smelly, the flavor was pretty good. Added tomato sauce, and a lot more pepper flakes. Will make it again with better sardines and more spice next time.

Made only minor modifications (extra 1/2 can of sardines in olive oil, more garlic, less cheese, whole wheat pasta, just a bit of tomato paste and 3/4 C pasta water) but loved it. We always have sardines around. I think this is going to be a staple recipe.

After Coming home with an inexplicable amount of sardines ( pleasures of Costco shopping), I had to find recipes to use them.  This one does not disappoint!  I love that it is so easy and quick to make, not to mention healthy and inexpensive.  Sardines have all kinds of nutrients that are beneficial, not just the omega 3s that we hear so much about.  Thank you SONNYCHIBA!

I was fairly unimpressed with this.  First of all I did have to make a fair amount of alterations - I added tomato sauce as other reviewers had since my sardines were in oil, I had to add more olive oil and a few tablespoons of vegetable broth just to get my sardine and onion goop to resemble something like a sauce, and I only had about half the required amount of lemon juice.  I also used rather more garlic and red pepper than called for.  However, when I was done, the dish was bland, didn't taste particularly like sardines or tomato, and I had to add a generous sprinkling of parsley and more red pepper before I could enjoy eating it.  Perhaps this is a case of my slap-dash cooking methods getting the best of me (measuring? who measures?) but I felt that even had I followed it to a T this recipe probably would not have been worthy of the 5 star rating it currently totes.

This recipe was my first attempt in preparing sardines… and even eating them. I used whole wheat rotini pasta, sardines in olive oil, and freshly ground pepper. I thought this dish was quite tasty and very easy to make. Thanks for the great recipe!

Tried a couple versions of this but could not get past the horrible fishiness of the sardines - and I really like sardines as a dip or spread.

very nice recipe - the only tweak I'll do next time is add a bit more tomato sauce from a jar, as the amount that comes with the sardines in the can isnt really enough to do the job - will make it again.  thanks

So happy and surprised with this recipe. Am low on food...had old whole wheat pasta, canned sardines not much else yet wanted a healthy satisfying dinner. This fit the bill. (and it is so cheap!). The only changes I made is that the sardines I had were in water so I added a bit (few TBS) of canned diced tomatoes and a few Tbs of leftover tom  sauce to make up for that. I also didn't have much parma left so I probably shaved only 2Tbs onto my serving.
This was fresh tasting, and delicious. I think the sardines I buy (at Trader Joes) are high quality. It didn't taste like a canned meat to be honest this was restaurant-tasty. It must be about the quality of the sardines, as others seem to have a different experience. I am happy and full of healthy food...sardines are so good for you!

I'm the kind of cook that kind of throws things together while keeping my fingers crossed and generally use the ingredient search. That's what I did with this one, "sardines" "pasta". This is a wonderful, tasty recipe with potential for individuality by cooks. Thanks Sonnychiba.

Made this dish with sardines in oil and added some diced tomatoes and a little tomato paste.  All of us found it just too fishy in taste.  While it was edible, the leftovers that usually get happily eaten for lunch the next day languished in the fridge and ended up thrown out.  Don't foresee making this again.

I'm a working mom. and in my quest to find the best easy-to-cook recipes - this was... WOW!!! So simple (and let's not forget cheap!!). At first I felt that the garlic didn't quite fuse in well.. so i added a few dashes of garlic salt - YUMMY!!! this is definitely on my to-prep-again list!

I made it with fennel replacing the onion and added about a cup of pasta sauce. Only had ground cyanne so I used about a quarter teaspoon. Used Wild Planet sardines in marinara sauce, smashing them up into the sauce. My husband thought I made clam sauce.  I am definitely making it again.  Served it over spaghetti squash.

I added 1 can of tomato sauce and crushed the sardines to blend them into the sauce. I was out of parmesan and used Dubliner cheese. I also added 1 tbsp pesto sauce. Great recipe with tons of flavor.

This one tasted a bit strange for my buds. I’ll try tweaking it a little if I come across more sardines in the house. Maybe a little less fish or try sardines in oil rather than tomato sauce.

Made the recipe just like it was written,  the only thing I adjusted was the amount of lemon juice and red pepper flakes,  I like more lemon flavor and a little more Spicer than  most people , turned out great, will definitely make it  again.

Used what was in the cupboard: sardines in oil, dried parsley and added 12 oz of store brand onion and garlic pasta sauce. Hard to believe how good it was.

The recipe is very similar to the one that both my Mother and Grandmother used to make on the Feast of St Joseph.  They bought a brand of sardines, imported from Italy, that had fennel leaves in the sauce.  Since I couldn't find a stalk of fennel in the grocery store, I crushed a few fennel seeds and included them in my sauce to preserve the original flavor that I recall.  I also added a small can (8 oz) of tomato sauce.  The recipe was excellent!

Good, but needs way more tomato sauce. I just squirted in some good old ketchup (3 tbsp?) and it balanced the flavours out splendidly. You may want to add some salt and basil as well.

Also, I am a small eater and this serves two people max. Cut down on the amount of fettucine.

Economical and tasty.  I did, however, triple the amount of tomato sauce.  I will make it again.

This is a keeper. I made it both ways, with tomato sauce and without, but added the olive oil from sardines so the sans sauce wasn't too dry. Without sauce was the preferred dish in our house. I think capers would be a good addition as well. I also substituted rice noodles, which we prefer to wheat spaghetti.

Truly an easy and quick dish.  I added more salt to my taste, but I wouldn't change anything.  I was surprised of how creamy in texture this came out and the lemon added a brightness to the dish.  I don't think I will make this a regular rotation in our house.  My husband would not even taste it (his loss), but I thought it was an interesting way to use up some of the leftover canned sardines.

Unfortunately we did not enjoy this dish.  The sardines were a bit overwhelming.  Thanks for putting the recipe out there, it was worth a shot.

Thought I had anchovies but it was sardines so I found this recipe. The sardines were only in the pan for a couple minutes but they turned out rubbery and had a very odd texture. The flavor was fine but I would never heat sardines again.
