After experiencing (and loving!) a Stilton/fennel salad at a local restaurant - I quickly went and bought 5 fennels- with no idea how to make it. This was a crunchy and rich recipe I'll be adding to the recipe book. I also made a version with romaine lettuce instead of arugula and added a little white balsamic- refreshing!!!! Thanks Chrissiek:)

We tried this salad tonight and were not overly impressed.  All we could taste was the parmesan, maybe because we bought is pre-grated?  It's worth another try but we will definitely leave out the cheese.

I usually use a mandolin to slice the fennel and a milk frother stick to mix the dressing.  Be careful with the dressing as it is very tart and a little goes a long way.  This salad is tart and delicious!

This is amazing!  I had some fennel from my CSA which I was looking to use as well as some arugula.  Normally this is nothing I would have made but let me tell you..... it was really terrific!  Even my kids liked it!  I didn't change a thing and it was perfect!   It's important to use freshly squeezed lemon juice and freshly grated parmesan and also to toast the pine nuts.  It combines to be a wonderful salad!

Amazing salad! I've taken this to two dinner parties and everyone was raving about it and asking for the recipe (and it's hard to wow people with salad!). The fennel and arugula are great together but the real winner is the dressing (such fresh flavor...would be good on any salad). I did make one change...I added 2 tsp of honey because it was a little too tart for my taste. But the flavor was great even without the honey and some may like it really tart.

This salad was so delicious! I just love the lemon dressing and how well all these ingredients taste together.  I took this on three occasions to work for lunch, adding the lemon dressing the night before each time.  The arugula and tomatoes soak up all the dressing, and the fennel stays crisp. Don't forget the Parmesan, as it really ties in all of the flavors beautifully.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I have been looking for ways to use arugula and this is a nice basic start. I would add some other flavors but not sure what, maybe orange segments or something. The lemon dressing pairs very nicely with the bitter arugula. Will be eating this more often

I didn't believe it was go delicious after seeing how simple the recipe is. I omitted the pine nuts and parmesan since I didn't have any available and it was superb! I can't stop eating it. Thank you for the recipe, it's a keeper!!

Made a few modifications to suite my taste -- I added orange slices and left out nuts. This recipe made for a great base to build upon.

The first time I made this my husband and I were hooked. We're on a budget but we "splurge" (relative term) on the fennel and arugula for this. I've also made it with kale which doesn't have quite the bold flavor but is still good.

I also sometimes top this one with a dressing of sherry vinegar (or lemon juice) + walnut oil + salt/pepper, which is an awesome combo. We make this at least a couple of times per month. Thanks for sharing!!

My first time using fennel.  Really yummy salad, that looked great too.  I followed the recipe except substituted cashews for the pine nuts, since I forgot them at the grocery store.  I will make this again and again. I think the point nights will be better. The next night I made it with mandarin oranges and grapes, omitting the tomatoes.  This was good too.

I omitted the olive oil for a no-fat version, and it was still delicious.

Added a tablespoon of honey to reduce tartness.  Also, I used parmesan reggiano cheese and shaved it with a vegetable peeler off the block rather than grate it.  Not one bite was left.

Delicious and refreshing! This ended up making salad for the hubs and me for three nights. It was a nice change from the usual lettuce salad. I will definitely be making it again!

I used a persimmon with this, no nuts and no tomatoes. I had it with the Grilled Halibut with Fennel and Orange recipe. I am very happy with my choices. Seriously try it with persimmon!

This is a winner! ! Did this salad as a side and got high ratings - even from a guy!  My grocery store only had a baby spinach and arugula mix but that seemed to work well.  My only other change was that I shaved bigger chunks of parmesan versus grating it.  The little cherry tomatoes added nice sweetness to balance the tang.  Definitely will be making again!
