This tasted pretty good! As written, I think the recipe is a great starting point to customize this dish however you'd like. I tasted it before putting it into the oven, and felt like it needed a bit of something. So I added in mushrooms and peas, and I feel that's what this dish was missing--a few veggies. I could see also adding in carrots, celery, garlic, or bell peppers too. I also used shell pasta in place of penne. Overall, it's a great, simple dish to fix according to what your family likes. Thanks for sharing!

I made this recipe with some adjustments yesterday for dinner and it was so tasty! I used Barilla brand Veggie penne and added some sliced olives and frozen peas. It's a new favorite for me.

Made exactly as written and it was fantastic!  Next time, I'll add mushrooms and peas, maybe some celery.  Loved it though!
