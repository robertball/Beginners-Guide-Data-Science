We have been making this exact recipe for YEARS..it is DELICIOUS! Broccoli rabe is definately an aquired taste, as it is somewhat bitter, but if you love it then you are gonna LOVE this recipe. We usually use mild italian sausage for this, but I bet hot would be great too. Also, we always use chicken broth, as we usually never have white wine in the house (just red, lol). If your looking for something tasty and simple, give this recipe a try, you will NOT be sorry-YUM! :)

The garlic and sausage are a sweet/salty complement to the slight bitterness of the rappini. So many ways to vary this, depending on the pasta and other veggies on hand--cherry tomatoes, red bell pepper.

Other than using regular broccoli, I changed nothing. This recipe is amazing. Not only did my family love it, but my picky in-laws raved about it as well! Try this recipe. You will love it!

Thanks for the recipe. Perhaps I can substitute pork with beef or veggies? I enjoy vegetarian meals too and olive oil and garlic seem to be the VAVAVAVOOM! to any meal. I also add a touch of chilli pepper. Cheers!!

Our store did not carry some of the ingredients called for so I used regular broccoli, piccolini pasta and a grated blend of 4 different Italian cheeses (asiago, romano, parmesan and another). It still turned out yummy! Will definately make it again!

This was just okay for us and I doubt I will ever make it again.  I only used 1/2 cup wine and it was overpowering.  I did use turkey sausage and it was fine.
