Since I discovered this recipe a few months ago I have made this for lunch 2-3 times a week. I use less cheese and occasionally swap out different tomatoes to keep things interesting, plus I use whole wheat pita. Great and simple dish perfect for a quick bite.

This was most delicious....perhaps the best lunch I've ever had and far and away the best pizza I've ever had.  The only changes I made were to add a few more olives, add several quarters of marinated artichoke hearts, and I used whole grain flatbread instead of pita bread.  Thank you.....loved it~

Love every ingredient in this dish.. Simple and satisfying for lunch. My 2 year old had fun making it too! I would suggest either upping the temp to 400 for the time suggested or baking for double time.. As the pita didn't crisp up enough. I broiled mine for 2 minutes at the end. I used a whole wheat Greek pita.

Loved this pizza!  Used a prepared crust and prepared pesto, but would love to try this again with everything homemade.  YUM!!

It was very good. A little to rich with all the feta cheese. Even though I love feta.

I didn't have pita on hand so I made a pizza base instead. This recipe is delicious and I'll be making it again

This is a keeper.  Absolutely delicious low cal pizza.  I didn't have any kalamata olives so I used anchovies.  I also used sliced cherry tomatoes.  I will definitely make this again.

The idea behind this recipe is great.  I didn't have  the listed ingredients, but the recipe lends itself to innovation.  The pesto base works well with many toppings.  I used a sliced tomato, a sliced scallion, and some chopped kale under the mozzarella.  Thank you for the recipe.
