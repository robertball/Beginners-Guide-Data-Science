Thank you!  This Chili is yummy and so easy!  The first time I did it exactly as the recipe, would have rated it 4 1/2 stars.  This time I browned the Turkey (just a matter of preference), I did not have Cayenne, so I substituted 1 tsp Red Pepper Flakes.  Rated it 5 stars based on these changes.

I followed this recipe pretty closely, except for leaving out the hot sauce and halving the cayenne (and it was still a tiny bit spicy, in my kids' opinion). It was really good, especially for something so easy. The liquid part looked a little strange--tiny bits of ground turkey throughout--but my family didn't seem to object. I think I might brown the turkey and drain it next time, but it was okay as is. I would also add more beans next time because I like lots of beans in my chili. Oh, and one other thing--I was doubling it but the store was out of crushed tomatoes, so I used one can of crushed and one of petite diced tomatoes, and it added some nice texture.

I have to admit that I used lean ground beef because I'm not a huge fan of turkey and I only used 1/4 tsp of cumin (also not a fan) but otherwise followed the recipe and it turned out great. Just the right amount of heat and spice, very flavourful and perfect for this time of year. Great and easy to prepare, thanks for the recipe.

I swapped the beans for red bell pepper for a low carb option. Instead of chili powder, I used 1 small jalapeño and 1 tbsp of Slap Your Mama hot sauce. This turned out perfect! Highly recommend!

Doubled the cayenne, no hot sauce though because I don't keep any around, and doubled the recipe (feeding men here lol). COOK THE TURKEY FIRST!

I never really cook, so needless to say, I LOVED how easy this recipe was. In place of hot sauce I added a spicy barbecue sauce and it really did something for it! Also added some corn. I added cheddar cheese and a bit of sour cream on top like recommended...man oh man was it good. A new favorite for sure! :)

Substituted turkey for beef and beans for extra wide egg noodles and replaced the tomato with cream sauce and ended up with a stroganoff but it was still good so 3 stars

Delicious turkey chili! I added an extra can of beans (white beans to mix it up) and used Italian stewed tomatoes instead of crushed tomatoes (for more flavor), as well as added a can of Rotel (diced tomatoes with mild chilis). I also browned the turkey before putting it in the slow cooker. I'll definitely make this meal again! Yummy!

This was a fantastic recipe that was full of flavor, and I would definitely make again!! Some modifications I made: I only had cannellini and black beans in the pantry, so I used those. One 15oz can of each. I skipped the cumin because I was out of it (still delicious) and added probably an extra 1/2 - 3/4 cup of chicken broth to make it a little more 'saucy'. Since I still had leftovers from Thanksgiving in the fridge, I decided to throw in a couple spoonfuls of my sausage stuffing as well. Absolutely delicious!!!! I plan on making this with chicken over the winter as I'm sure it would be equally good. As my hubby said "definitely a keeper "!

Best chili I have ever had and it's really easy to moderate the spiciness which makes it quite a crowd pleaser!  Great for leftovers too!

Not bad, I’d make it again. 6 servings ask for 1.25 pounds of meat, I only had 1lb so I added a can of black beans. I halved the amount of chili powder, skipped cayenne and hot sauce only because I didn’t have it. Kept everything else and it was super tasty, my toddler LOVED it so much he ate it for breakfast.

I liked this recipe.  I made it with only 1lb of ground turkey (due to how it was packaged at my supermarket) and added a can of black beans (because they are my favorite beans).  Just a note: make sure you get enough crushed tomatoes.  I didn't buy enough at first because I didn't notice that the "1 can" in the ingredient list is actually a large can.

This is my go-to chili recipe that everyone in the family loves.  I usually pre-cook the turkey which prevents it from lumping together, though it's not necessary.   Instead of the chicken stock, I use chicken broth which I usually have on hand or can generate with chicken bouillon and water.  We add crumbled tortilla chips and cheese.

My family really enjoyed this.  I browned the onion and ground turkey first. I used black beans instead of pinto beans. I used less hot sauce because we do not like hot foods. I will definitely make it again.

This recipe was definitely a hit. I followed the recipe pretty closely but browned the turkey beforehand and doubled the amount of cayenne pepper. I excluded the salt because the tomatoes I used had salt. Still a little lacking in spice, would add more cayenne pepper next time. Overall great dish.

Versatile recipe. I've made it a few times now, and I've added things like corn, carrots, kale, and just recently made it with ground bison. Excellent every time! I do brown the meat first and I don't like spicy food, so I leave out the hot sauce and cayenne. So easy to start before work and come home to a hot meal!

My kind of slow cooker recipe - dump everything into the pot and cook.  Made it for the first time tonight.  My theory is always make it the first time exactly as written then adjust as needed - except I omitted the garlic and onion due to dietary restrictions.  My husband and I liked it, neither one of us thought that it was too spicy.  Next time I am going to brown the meat before putting into the pot, I thought that the meat texture was a bit weird.  Otherwise, great easy recipe.

I normally don’t rate after making changes but this was so dang delicious, I had to share First, we like a “soupy” chili with a few veggies.  We used 2 lbs of meat.  1 lb mild Italian sausage & 2 lb ground turkey, browned.  I used diced tomatoes versus crushed. And I added a 15 ounce can of rinsed black beans.  I also added 2 large celery sticks, sliced & 3 medium carrots.  I had a packet of McCormacks original chili seasoning & used that.  I also used 32 ounces of chicken stock.  I used a tablespoon or so of Franks wing sauce just because that’s what I had m.  Cooked on low for 8 hours & it was ANAZING.

I made this particular Turkey Chili recipe for a bunch of people coming over for a football game.    It was an absolute hit.  If you follow the ingredients to a "T", it will be a hit for all of you as well..

This is a great basic recipe!!! I browned the turkey breast first added all the ingredients.  Substituted red pepper flakes ILO the cayenne.  Also, sweated the onions and some bell peppers before adding them.  And also added diced jalapenos.  Will definitely make again but add more heat.  Overall, it's a solid recipe that you can customize!!

I used Chili beef instead of turkey.  I added a chopped green pepper.  For the pinto beans, I used Bush's pinto beans Southwestern Style and didn't drain them.  It added a little kick to the chili.  I've made it twice in two weeks and have had rave reviews!

Oh this was good! What a great feeling to make it home, late from work even, and know dinner was ready! I needed something that my husband could enjoy since he is diabetic. This worked great. I used black beans only and I forgot crushed tomatoes so I used stewed tomatoes. It worked great! The extra heat of the cayenne pepper was delicious. I will do this again this fall season!

I made it vegetarian by substituting tofu for the turkey and vegetable broth for the chicken broth. Excellent recipe!

Wonderful basic recipe you can adjust to taste. I added black beans too.
I personally had to brown the turkey first.
It was very healthy and got better tasting with each day, although it went pretty fast!
This will be a regular go to recipe in my kitchen.

Made as is, flavour was good, didn’t care for the texture. Made a second time using 1.25 lbs boneless, skinless chicken breast (boiled and pulled) added a small can of tomato paste, and it was perfect!

Absolutely perfect !! taste as good ir better than Wendy's chilli and that's high praise imo.

I substitute pinto beans for another can of kidney and used vegetable broth. used salsa to replace 1 can tomatoes. excellent ???? that's just what i had on hand. sure its perfect without substitutions...just add some shredded cheddar and sour cream and enjoy ??

It's a tasty and it's a snap to make, however even after eight hours it was a bit watery, so I'd probably recommend backing off the chicken stock a scoche.

I also kinda wimped out on the hot sauce and used half the recommendation, but went with the full recommendation with the cayenne. The end result was good flavor, but pretty much no heat. However the nice thing about that is you can just leave out the bottle of hot sauce and people can heat it up however much they want.

This chili is the best I've come across!! I do tweak it a lot, but for my own personal tastes. I omit the cumin, use garlic powder instead of fresh, and basically triple/quadruple all the other seasonings. The first time I made it, it wasn't as flavorful as I thought it would be. Since we like spicy/hot in our household, I don't even measure I just add and taste a couple of hours later, and add more if needed. I do brown the turkey before starting the crock-pot and with about 2 hours left, I brown 2 sausages and cut that up and place into the crock-pot. Everyone who's ever had it has always asked for the recipe. Thank you for sharing!

This was great!  I used about 10 teaspoons of hot sauce (it still wasn't hot as all) and I'd also recommend seasoning your ground turkey just a little before mixing it in with everything else.  We also ate it with a side of cornbread. It was really good.  My husband loved it. I'll definitely be making this again

I love this recipe!  The only thing I changed was:  I added a can of black beans and cut back on chili powder, cayenne powder,
and cumin.  I didn't add hot sauce.  Reason is I don't like
spicy chili.   Will make this again!

The only problem was that the turkey became too granular; chunkier would have given a better mouth feel. I made it a bit spicier but that is one's perogative

Got lots of compliments on it, but it wasn't my favorite.  part of it was my fault because I used 85% turkey instead of the recommended 93%, which may have made it more soupey with the run off fat, which I ended up draining some of it . I'll have to do it again with 93% and try 6 hours on low instead of 4 on high  :-)

Absolutely loved it.  Made two ingredient changes.  No hot sauce, used two sauteed jalepenos for the heat.  Also used left over turkey from Thanksgiving cut into 1/2" cubes.

Very good flavor, reminds me of the "Coney Island" flavor of chili in Detroit. Topped with onions, cheese and Tortola chips.  Very easy to make and the kids enjoyed it too.

Very good chili that's easy to make and a healthier alternative to ground beef based chili.  We will make this again.

This a really good basic chili recipe, but, like others, I embellished it a bit to make it healthier and I think tastier. I added a can of mild green chili's, chopped green and red peppers, way more garlic, and since I didn't have any chili powder on hand I added some Lawrey's packaged Fajitas seasoning. I also used veggie broth instead of water to enhance the flavor. It turned out fantastic! Sent some to my husbands co-worker and he couldn't thank us enough and even complimented us the following week it was so memorable for him. 
Going to make it again this week!

Tastes great. Just a little too soupy but that can be drained out upon serving or by adding a thickening agent. I like to add cornbread to my serving and that absorbs the extra liquid perfectly.

I was really impressed with how this turned out. This was the first time I had tried making chili with turkey instead of beef, but we like to eat as healthy as possible as long as it doesn't majorly sacrifice taste. This was a very pleasant surprise. It had a slightly different taste than beef, but not in a bad way. My husband and I both liked it, and it was even better as leftovers. I added a green pepper and jalapeño but otherwise stuck to the recipe.

I made it according to the recipe.  It was good, but next time I will brown the meat first.  The texture was odd, almost grainy.  The flavor was good though, and it was easy!

It came out really good. A little liquidy. Didn't add quite so many hot spices. Added shredded cheddar, sour cream and tortilla chips in the end. The kids loved it.

Great!  Made it as is with a few exceptions.  Added a little red wine, some Osem consomme mix, and omitted the cayenne pepper.  I also added half a large green bell pepper, diced.  Browned the meat before adding it.  We served it with Daiya cheddar cheese and fake sour cream.  Even the kid loved it.  Thanks.

I've made this before, but I made even more changes! I added 1/2cup of corn, lots of hot sauce, mixed beans and I browned the turkey BEFORE putting it in the slow cooker. This keeps the texture of the turkey and makes it nice and chunky!! ;-) Perfect for a cold, dreary day. In the summer, it's AWESOME served cold!! Great leftover recipe!!

I sautéed the onion and browned the turkey before adding it to the slow cooker.  For extra heat I added two diced jalapeños and a can of Rotel tomatoes. I also added a diced red bell pepper. This is a good base recipe that you can adjust to your liking.

First time ever making chili. I used 1.5 pounds of ground turkey and browned it first. I did not use the garlic, cayenne pepper, or hot sauce simply because I did not have them. I also added a can of corn. Served over elbow noodles with cheese and sour cream on top. Delicious!!!

The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars is because of the directions. I have never seen a recipe that calls for ground turkey or hamburger directing you to add it raw to your slow cooker! You will create a much tastier and far better looking dish if you brown the meat with your onions and garlic. I did not add the hot sauce because I had small children eating it. This was very simple to put together (even with browning the meat first) and delicious!

This was a hit tonight.  I browned the turkey beforehand like a few people recommended and left out the hot sauce because my little one is not a fan.  Added some corn and cornbread to make this a new favorite in our house.  No one mentioned this, but be sure to drain the beans before adding.

This recipe is almost perfect and just the correct amount of spicy.  It isn't thick enough so I added 2 tablespoons of corn starch to thicken it up.  I assume you could cut the chicken stock as well.  I also added a can of grilled corn kernels for taste and texture.

Added 1lb of ground italian sausage and cooked it with the 1lb of ground turkey. 
Substituted 1 1/2 cup of cooked black beans, for the can of black beans. 
Used a 10oz can of diced tomatoes, instead of 28oz can.  
No hot sauce added.  
Cooked in the crock pot on high for 3 hours, instead of on low for 6-8 hrs

I love this recipe as is! My only change (since I'm feeding a one year old who wasn't a huge fa of how spicy it was) is that I didn't put as many spices in. Instead of 1/2 tsp I used only a 1/4 tsp of all the hot ones. I also like my meat a little chunkier, so I don't stir it as much as I just break the turkey into bite size pieces.

This was bland, but I can't really blame my lack of enthusiasm for this recipe on the recipe - I modified it to reduce the heat, which my wife doesn't like.  I also browned the turkey with the onion, which I think robbed the dish of the flavor of the turkey.

Great recipe! I made this for my girls night in party last night and served it with baked potatoes and chili-bar toppings. I followed it pretty closely, except I didn't use hot sauce in the chili- I served it on the side. I made this for 10 servings (ie 2 pounds of turkey, etc) and put in in the crock pot for 8 hours. I eyeballed the chicken stock when I poured it in so I came out with the perfect texture- not too soupy, not dry.. I sauté the onion and garlic first. Put that in the crock, then BROWN AND DRAIN the turkey (and break it up into chunks) before adding it. If you put it straight in the pot, you might need to cook it longer so it thickens and the liquid evaporates. I don't know how you'd get the perfect size chunks if you just throw the turkey in there raw- I think it would be too hard to break up without squishing all of the beans. The chili bar sides I used: jalepenos, sour cream, Fritos, scallions, shredded cheddar cheese, and baked potatoes that some people put the chili right on top of. No one said it was too spicy- there's a tiny kick, but it adds flavor. It was such a huge hit, I only have one small bowl left over for dinner tonight!! I can't wait to make it again!!

Great flavor and very hearty. I can appreciate that it uses ground turkey instead of beef. Excellent healthy choice there.

Great healthy recipe. The only thing I would change would be to double the beans (just my preference).

The chili was great and easy to make! I browned the turkey meat before putting  it into the crockpot and I left out the hot sauce. Still had plenty of "heat".

Too soupy, too bland, and turkey had weird texture.
