This is my recipe I posted, but just realized that my recipe is a little different than what ended up here.  I use 1/2 C half a half (not 1-1/2) and 2 cups diced onion (or two medium onions, sauteed or not).  Also I use a deep 9" glass pie plate and the Pillsbury refrigerator crust, not the preformed crusts, they aren't as good or as big.  Glad everyone is enjoying this!

Delicious.  Even people who don't like quiche, might like this one.  The onion and green chilies give it a little kick.  I followed the recipe exactly.  I used a regular Pyrex glass pie plate and the recipe amounts were right on target.  No spillover whatsoever.  Puffed up to a golden brown in 60 minutes.  I covered the edges of the pie crust with foil and took the foil off during the last 5 - 10 min. of baking.  It makes a nice presentation.  Don't be tempted to add salt - I thought about it - you really won't need it.  Next time, I would add some pepper.  Some people might prefer the onions to be sauteed before adding to the mixture.  However, I think it's fine to put them in raw - just make sure it's a very small dice.  Thanks for this great recipe, Pam!

I use this as my base recipe, it is so easy and the whole family loves it.   I will either add asparagus spears or brocolli and ham.  The posibilities are endless.

Very nice basic quiche recipe.  I used fat free half and half and 50% reduced fat cheese, yet it was still very rich and creamy.  To make it more appealing to my four year old I left the green chilies out and added fresh snipped chives.  The taste was very mild, but we enjoyed it.  As with other reviewers I had more than enough batter for 2 pie shells.  We ate one for dinner and I froze the other for later.

This was good, but the taste of the green chiles isn't very apparent. I think the bacon overpowers it. I sauteed my onions before adding to the egg mixture because I don't care for the sharp flavor they have otherwise. There was enough filling to fill two frozen store-bought (Marie Callendar brand) piecrusts.

I made this over the weekend and it turned out fantastic.  It was so delicious and my family really enjoyed it. I did change it slightly... I omitted the green chilis and used green onions and added spinach and bacon. The base ingredients are perfect for a quiche. I will make this again. UPDATE 4/13/15 - I use the base ingredients of this recipe all the time for quiche. Most recently I made two batches and put them in 2 greased 8x8 pans and added cooked spicy sausage, green onions and mushrooms to one and kale, bacon, green onions green peppers to the other.  They turned out super fluffy and since I didn't use any pie crust they were also low carb!

We tried this quiche for brunch the other morning. We had company and the guests had seconds, as did I. This is a very good recipe and easy to make. We did use two cans of green chilies 4oz each. This was the only change.

This was my first attempt at a genuine quiche, and it turned out great! After reading the reviews I was afraid there would be too much filling, but while the crust was full there was no mess in the oven. I did have a 9.5" pie pan, however. I also cooked the onions with the bacon for the great flavor, but that's just personal preference. I can't wait to try this with ham and cheese - thanks so much for sharing!

What an awesome presentation this makes.  It truly looked beautiful and was easy to put together.  My brother-in-law asked for the recipe.  I also made it without the green chilies, but I should have added something else for more flavor.  A little bland without the chilis.

I am giving this 5 Star on taste, but a 4 star on proportion.  You most definitely can't use a regular pie crust and fit all the ingredients in.  But since that's all I had, I just changed the 8 servings to 6.  I made this twice the first one for a potluck at work (gone within minutes) and the 2nd time at home for the family.  The first time, I still had about a 1/2 cup or so of leftover mixture.  But other than that, the flavor of it was wonderful.  Thank you for a great recipe!

Do NOT follow the recipe's amounts unless you have a deep pie plate because the amount of mixture will spill over EVERYWHERE!!!  I had to find this out the hard way, as I did not read all the reviews.  My mistake.  I removed some of the liquid, but I fear it's not enough.  I don't know what will become of my oven in the next hour.  It is quite upsetting that a recipe was posted so incorrectly.

This recipe confused me a little because the person that posted it wrote in the review section that some of the portions were wrong. The people who made it before she made that comment seemed to love it, with the wrong portions?? I couldnt decide what portion to use so I went in between. I used 3/4 c half and half and one onion. I sauteed the onion first in some of the bacon dripping and drained it really well before mixing it in. The quiche is SO good! I will definantly make this again. Note: Do not ad salt. It doest need it.

Delicious! Wonderful as written I'm sure but of course I tweaked a bit.  I did 1 cup half and half, 5 eggs, 1 med-large onion (sauteed in a couple Tbls of bacon grease with a little minced garlic), I used freshly grated cheeses and the 4 oz can of chilies.  I added a few shakes of crushed red pepper.  I only had a preformed deep dish and as others said, it was a bit too much filling so I poured the extra into a very small buttered casserole and made a tiny crustless one. For the quiche itself, I flash baked the crust for 10 minutes at 350 and then filled.  60-70 mins seemed like a long time to me.  I checked at 45 minutes and it was perfectly cooked.  I'll def make it again although next time I might reduce the bacon by a couple pcs and add another can of chilis as I think I would like more chili flavor.  Thank you for a great recipe PAMMMY.

This was great! I have made plenty of different quiches in the past but nothing like this and I am SO glad I found this recipe!! It was a huge hit at my brunch! I finely diced onions and put them in raw with the green chilies, bacon and I used pepperjack cheese for a little extra heat. Also, when I made my egg mixture I put salt, pepper, garlic powder and hot sauce in with 6 eggs and milk. I baked this in a spring form pan and it turned out great!

Yum! For the crust, I used the Butter Flaky Pie Crust, which is also from this site. I added sauteed garlic, onion (I increased the onion called for for a whole small diced onion) red pepper and mushrooms to this pie and cut back on the cheddar cheese by half. Because I don't have fat free half-n-half on hand right now, I used fat free evaporated milk. The switch out worked just fine. Very good basic quiche I could fill in my own on hand ingredients to bump up the flavor and clean out my fridge at the same time. We had this with homemade blueberry muffins.

I just came back from vacation where I had the chance to eat a breakfast quiche for the first time.  I knew I could make it better than the bed n breakfast my husband and I had stayed at.  So I went to the grocery store and purchased Pillsbury ready made crust, eggbeaters, Colby jack cheese, bell pepper, bacon, and fresh sliced mushroom.  I returned home and thought “dang it how in the world do I cook this”.  I knew I would find a recipe to follow on here and man did it turn out good!  My Husband ate half of it in less than 30 min.  Recommendations don’t use cream, why do you need cream? I didn’t use cream.  I enjoyed this with sour cream and salsa, and my husband had it with ketchup.  My wish is that this might help someone. Have a blessed day.

I absolutely love making quiches (they're quick, versatile and ALWAYS well received), and this one is particularly "yummy". When I make quiche, I use homogenized milk when it's just the family, half-and-half if it's a "company over for dinner" occasion, and heavy cream for holiday hors d'ouerves. With this quiche, I also put out sour cream, a mild salsa, and some quacamole -- just in case someone (like myself) wants to "dress it up" a bit. I use store bought pie crusts and have never put flour in my egg mixture. In my infrawave oven, it takes just 5 minutes to pre-bake the pie crust and 17 minutes to bake the quiche -- with perfect results just about every single time.

This was sooooo yummy. Followed the recipe exactly as is. The only thing I would change is a little less onion. The whole quiche was eaten, everyone enjoyed. Found it better then the ones we have had at resturants. Thanks for a great recipe will make again definitly.

Not for the faint of heart. Delicious, but I can still feel my arteries protesting.  Serve it with fruit, green salad, and anything else healthy you can think of so you don't end up eating 3 slices (like I did).

FAMILY FAVORITE! We have this quiche at all holidays and I always make 2. I use heavy cream instead of half-and-half, 12 oz bacon, and the pre-shredded "fiesta blend" cheese. Be sure to put foil under your pans in case of run over. I have tried quite a few different quiches recipes and this one is my families favorite. Thank you Pammmy for sharing it with us. DELICIOUS!

Great base quiche recipe.  I left out the green chilies and substituted ham for the bacon because that is what we prefer, but otherwise followed recipe exactly.  My teenage daughter who had never tasted quiche before loved this - and she's usually pretty picky about what she will try.

Mmmm! I added a pkg of light cream cheese, and more onion then called for. Made my own pie crust, and this turned out great! Rich and flavourful :)

I wish that I could give this recipe more than five stars.  'Yummy' is right!  I changed it a little for our taste: used chopped deli turkey instead of bacon, Havarti instead of monterey jack, tripled the amount of green chile and added about 1 tsp. freshly ground black pepper.  I didn't have 1/2 and 1/2 so I used 1 c. of cream and 1/2 c. of milk.  Also, this recipe made two quiches. Thank you for sharing Pamela!

I made this without the bacon but thought it was perfect for what I was looking for.  A friend ate it with me for the first time and she also loved it.  It's very simple with simple quick ingredients.  Perfect for brunch if you're looking for something with cheese to accompany another food item.

I followed this recipe before I read the reviews, along w/ the review from the person who submitted it regarding only 1 cup of half and half and not 1 1/2....I used 1 1/2 and it was way too much, so I  made a note to only use 1 cup next time, as I will be making this again. I added mushrooms and pepper jack cheese crumbles along w/ cilantro on top and it is very good. It took the whole hour to bake, but I can dish it up like pie. Great recipe.

Im new to making quiche but thought the recipe was simple enough and the results outstanding. I questioned no salt and pepper before putting it in the oven, but found that there was enough cheese, bacon and green chilies to make up for both of them! 

Excellent recipe!!

This was the first quiche I have ever made. I made this today for brunch with 1 cup half-and-half and half cup 1% milk, just because that is what I had. I added some chopped red bell pepper. It did overflow inthe oven but that may have been from adding the extra veggies. Delicious!

Delicious!  I used the author's correction of only 1/2 cup of half and half.  Done to a 'T' and was quite a hit.  I didn't have bacon, or chiles, so I used some smoked summer sausage I had and added a bit of seasoned salt for a bit of a kick.  Wonderful recipe and wonderful base recipe to change ingredients around with.

This was great, and I loved the addition of the green chiles. Quiche is one of my favorite recipes, and I'll definitely be making this recipe. I'd like to try this with a different blend of cheeses to try to give it a little more flavor. Thanks for the recipe!

So different than traditional quiches.  Loved the flavors- I only used 2C. + of cheese and it was still wonderful!  A little too spicy for the kids,but I made two different ones and my husband & I enjoyed this one!  Great change!

Excellent, easy recipe!   The only thing I changed was using 1% milk instead of half and half because that's all I had.  I decreased it to 1/2 a cup per the original author's instructions.  I used a Marie Calendar's frozen deep dish pie crust and this was just the right amount of filling.

This is the best recipe I've found for quiche. I use 1-2 chipotle peppers instead of the green chiles, if I have them. It spices the recipe up. Sometimes I use sausage instead of bacon - you don't really taste the bacon much. I use milk, if I don't have half-and-half. I also use a refrigerated pie crust, but cook it in a casserole that is deeper than a regular pie pan. This quiche is beautiful, and good leftover, too. Everybody loves it!!

Very "yummy!"  I used sausage in stead of bacon.  The only change I would make next time would be to use 1/2 the amount of cheese.  Thanks for the recipe!

This really is yummy!  I didn't have cream, so I used milk instead and used diced jalapenos instead of green chiles.  I also used a frozen deep dish pie crust.  Excellent!

Very simple for a basic cook like me. I used half again the measurements and made 2 with a little to spare.  Needed a little more oommph.  I think a good dose of garlic would help.  Maybe some jalepeno too.  Family all liked it.

Fantastic.  I used one less egg and no onion, but I did add garlic powder and ground, black pepper.  I did not have monterray jack, so I used gouda.  It made a lot of filling.  Husband loved it!

My teenage son wanted me to make a quiche, but not like the spinach quiche I made last month (it had spinach and swiss cheese) so I chose this one. Well, my husband, son, and myself loved it. Yes, there was a lot of filling, but it did not overflow - it rose a bit, but having that much filling made it truly a meal. We served it with a nice green salad. Delicious.

Tried 2 other recipes prior to a special luncheon. Was not please with either and then tried this one. This was a keeper. I did add a little freshly shredded parmesan and a few red pepper flakes. It was really good...really easy....and my friends raved about it. Oops...and I did add a little salt and pepper and prebaked the crust for about 8 minutes

This quiche turned out great!  I didn't have MJ cheese but used cheddar and maybe a 1/4C of MOZZ cheese.   I didn't have half/half but used a 1/2 milk and 1/2 heavy cream.   It baked up nice and I had to put foil around the edges so the middle would finish...took less time also-about 50min!

This tasted very good.  However, there was far too much filling for one crust.  I used a 9" Safeway "deep dish" frozen pie crust, and there is a spectacular mess in my oven still waiting to be cleaned. Thank goodness I put it over a cookie sheet or it'd be far worse (unfortunately it's a flat cookie sheet, no rim, otherwise the mess may have been completely contained).  I'd guess about 2/3 of the recipe would be better for a single crust, maybe even split the whole recipe into 2 crusts.

My previous quiche-making experiences made me wary of wateriness, so I left out the green chiles and substituted 1/2 cup plain yogurt plus 1 cup milk for the half-and-half since I had no half-and-half on hand. I also substituted mozz. cheese for the Monterey Jack because that's what I had; added ground garlic pepper; and sauteed the onions in the bacon grease for a bit for extra flavor. This quiche turned out great! Baked in 60 minutes flat, and no unpleasant wateriness. Definitely a keeper!

This was delicious - used 3 eggs and 1/2 cup of egg beaters.  One 9"deep dish store bought  crust was perfect.  Also added 5 ounces of sauteed chopped mushrooms and the chopped onions.  Cooked for 60 minutes and let rest for 15 minutes.  Served with green salad and homemade honey mustard dressing.

This was pretty good, a great base for whatever kind of quiche you want to make. I didn't like the bacon at all in this though. I added frozen spinach which was GREAT, next time I will add artichoke as well. Other than those changes, this recipe was perfect. Measurements were spot on for me, the mixture filled a 9 inch pie crust perfectly. I had to bake for about an hour and 20 minutes, it was still very runny in the middle at 1 hour. Make sure to let it set for 10 to 20 minutes before cutting. I will make this again, very easy and yummy!

I made this recipe using PAMMY's changes (less milk 1/2 c vs 1 1/2c)  I added a few extra things because I had them on hand... I used 2 deep dish store bought crusts, I added 1 1/2 cubed and boiled russet potatoes, and I added a little cubed ham. This turned out marvelous.

This was an excellent recipe.  Like many of us on this site who are more experienced I made a few changes.  I used about 1 cup chopped  turkey ham, 2 cups smoked Swiss cheese and 1 cup NY white sharp cheddar.  I used 3/4 cup of Aldi's brand of Egg beaters combined with 2 whole eggs.  I used a shallot for a more mild onion flavor.  Other than those minor changes/substitutions it was incredible.  Thanks Pammmy!!!

I used a store bought deep dish pie crust.  Reduced cream to 1 1/3 cups, which filled it to the brim but didn't overflow.  Also used green onions instead of regular (for color), and eliminated the green chilies (don't care for them).  Took to a potluck and got several compliments.  So easy and delicious.

omitted the crust for a healthier version i just add a few tbsp flour to the egg mixture which sets up fine for slicing. any good cheese will do. i had sharp cheddar and topped with shredded parm. i highly reccomend sauteed onions, not raw. it adds to the deep rich flavor you don't get otherwise. nice recipe!

A HUGE HIT!  We recently had a brunch at our house, and I made 2 kinds of Quiche (this one and Easy Quiche), both of which were very yummy.   This one definitely was most popular and went fast!  It  was fairly simple to make too!  I used a Pillsbury All-Ready Pie Crust and it was just right.  I doubled the recipe and made two, with no problems. 

Yummy is right!

So tasty!  It's even better the next morning (if it's not all gone the first go-round), after all the flavors really set in.  I added a few fresh spinach leaves and diced fresh tomatoes because we love them, but I'm sure it's delicious without.

Great recipe!  I made this last night and I'm eating leftovers for lunch right now.  The only problem I had was finding a can of diced green chile peppers.  To tell the truth, I'm not even really sure what those are.  Instead, I used half a fresh green bell pepper.  The results were "Yummy" indeed.

This quiche was excellent!!  My husband said it was awesome, just like his mother used to make!  This was my first time making quiche and it turned out great.  The only thing I did different was pre-bake the crust like other reviewers suggested and I added spinach and one extra egg.  Other than that I didn't change a thing!  Will definitely make this again and again and probably try other kinds of meats, cheeses, and vegetables!

This was really good - I didn't have a can of green chilies, so I added part of a can of diced tomatoes/green chilies mixed.  I didn't particularly like the tomatoes, so I wouldn't recommend this, but it was good anyway.  Next time I plan to make it just with the green chilies.

I love quiche and this was a good one. I added garlic and onion powders, black pepper and some hot sauce to the mix. I replaced the bacon with some leftover ham and also threw in mozarella cheese. Didn't have a pie crust in the house so I made a mashed potato crust which I baked for about fifteen minutes before adding the filling. Great quick meal paired with a nice big salad. Thanks so much Pam!

While good, there was too much filling; this really could easily fill two pie shells. I also like to add a bit more seasoning. This, like other quiche recipes, is customizable, so I would recommend this recipe for anyone except a new cook. Thank you.

Very good!!!  I don't usually like quiche but I did love this recipe.  Very easy and fool proof.  I used whole milk instead of half and half and it tasted great (cooked it for 55 mins).  In the future I may saute the onions so they are soft.

I love this stuff!  I've been asked to bring this to several get-togethers and it's always impressive.  I like to use crescent rolls for the crust (spread out in a pretty casserole, and baked until just brown).  More bacon and more chiles make it a really substantial meal - and it's pretty!!!

Brunch would not be the same without this quiche.  We call it chilie relleno quiche and it is requested for every holiday.  Don't change a thing.  Delicious!

I have been making quiche off and on, for years.  This is, by far, the lightest quiche I have made.  Looking at the recipe, I thought, all of this will not fit into a 9" pie pan.  Too much cheese.  It was superb, with all quantities spot on.  I subbed pre diced ham and red bell pepper, all other ingredients were the same.  Just be sure not to over bake.  Bring it out of the oven and let it set, perfect.  Thanks for sharing.  Keeper!

Made the original recipe with 4 oz of fresh green chile peppers, filled one (9 in) pie crust and 3/4 of another pie crust. Delicious as is, at about level 2-3 heat. My husband and I like it hotter, so the next try we tried 5 oz of jalapeno peppers, and 5 oz frozen spinach (liquid squeezed out). We also went half and half on bacon and ham. Even better, with more texture and deep green color from the spinach. The third try, we did not have bacon, but used packaged pre-cut cubed ham, put 6 oz of jalapeno peppers and a full bag (10oz) of the frozen spinach, without changes to the rest of the ingredients, it totally filled 2 (9 inch deep dish) pie shells perfectly without overflowing. Delicious! My husband thinks the bacon flavor is better than ham though I think they are interchangeable, as the ham lets the cheesy/spicy taste shine.

Filling made 2 quiches.  Could add 1 more egg.  Use only 1/2 cup half and half.   1 cup SAUTEED onions.  Added chives and sauteed spinach and garlic.  Added Siracha hot sauce.  Used pepper jack cheese.  Very good.

This is excellent! It came together very quickly & is full of flavor! I was out of sharp cheddar but used a mix of mild cheddar & monterey jack. Skipped the flour completely(on accident). Superb!

This is a wonderful recipe, but I felt it was a little too cheesy. Next time I make this I will cut the cheese in half. Also I used ham instead of bacon and added a tsp of onion powder since I did not have any onions on hand. All in all this recipe is a keeper =)

I didn't have a 9 inch pie crust and felt too lazy to make one. Another recipe on this site uses hash browns to make a crust from that recipe. I used shredded hash brown potates, 1/4 cup butter and season salt. Pressed it into the 9" deep dish pie pan. I baked the "crust" for about 20 minutes before filling it per this recipe. The other half said this was a "keeper". Also substituted 4 green onions for the onion. Turned out great. Thanks Pammmy for an "eggs"cellent recipe we can customize too!

Very tasty! Definitely a keeper!  I did make some changes though...  I used medium-sharp Cheddar because I didn't have sharp.  I also didn't have Monterey Jack, so I used about 1/4 cup of Parmesan cheese to give it more flavor.  I didn't have half-and-half so I used 2% milk and added another egg.  I also added chopped fresh mushrooms (6 medium-sized).  Finally, I omitted the chilli peppers as they give me indigestion.

Thanks for sharing this one!  I'm sure I'll be making this again!

I made this for a Royal Wedding brunch that we had in our office today and it was a big hit!  Normally I will test something before bringing it to a function, but I didn't taste test it this time and it was perfect.  I went by the author's original recipe of 1/2 cup half and half.  I used just slightly more than 1/2 cup onion and I sauteed it in a tbsp. or two of bacon grease until soft and translucent. I kept everything else the way is was published and it turned out PERFECTLY.  It was not runny or bland or anything - it set up beautifully. In fact, I doubled the recipe to make two quiches, one for home, and both turned out perfectly.  Will be making this again for sure!

This recipe was delicious.  My 6 year old devoured it.  I followed the recipe amounts exactly.  The only thing that I did differently was to cut the bacon before frying it.  I think that it renders off more of the fat and gets crispier.  I will definitely keep this in my recipe box!

This is an easy and excellent recipe but I found that the meat in the bottom, stays in the bottom. Ham will probably fall to the bottom otherwise, but I think I'd stir the bacon into the filling instead.

Great for a base quiche recipe. I've been making it in the evenings for my pregnant wife to have a quick and easy breakfast in the mornings (reheats very well as with any quiche). We both love it!

I have made this quiche once a week for the last month - and my family would like it MORE often! It is so easy to make and has such great flavor. I use whole green chilies and chop them up. It gives a stronger chile flavor that is great! Everyone should try this recipe!!

I made this on a whim one day and didn't have a pie crust...so I made it as a casserole instead.  I did saute the onion, personal preference, and also to make a "crust", I added about 5 slices of bread cubes to the top, drizzled with butter and sprinkled with paprika.  It was great.  I'm sure the quiche version would be just as tasty!  I even got asked for the recipe!  Thanks for sharing!

My family and I love this recipe!! We omit the chilis and subsitute sausage for the bacon, and I add onion for my husband. It has turned out perfect every time!! I get the frozen pie crusts and the recipe is enough to fill 2 right to the top. One with onions for hubby, no onions for my kiddos. Thanks for sharing!!

This is a very easy recipe. The quiche set up perfectly and it also reheats excellently. My variations were to omit the green chilies (teenage daughter) but to chop up fresh chives since they get lost in the baking. I also added fresh mushrooms. I added a 1/2 t. of seasoning salt. Delicious.

Exactly as it's name "Yummy".  I've served this many many times with the same results....."please give me the recipe".  It's so easy to make the day before and just pop in the oven.

This was a definite hit at our house! We had some friends over for brunch and one of the women said she never liked quiche growing up-but she loved this recipe. Add a little hot sauce and it's a perfect dish.

I really wanted a good, basic quiche recipe that I could run with - and did I ever! I used the pie crust, eggs and half & half - other than that, I substituted 2 cups of shredded swiss cheese, fresh broccoli florets, and a good quality diced ham, layered on the bottom. It turned out fantastic, and I was able to adapt it to my guests tastes!

I did not like this quiche at all, however my family did, that is why I gave it three stars. All I could taste was the peppers, the cheese and bacon and eggs just went to waste (I thought). I know I won't make this for myself again, maybe for the family.

It was delicious. I went ahead and sautéed onions and I still used a preformed deep dish pie crust. All the mixture got in there and there  was no spillage.  Also, I'm glad I looked at the reviews. The author corrected a few measuring errors and that was much appreciated.

Well I reduced the half and half to 1/2 cup and the filling seems dry or weirdly solid. And the cheese is quite salty. It looks beautiful but lacks something. Perhaps more liquid IS required although the calorie count is right at 1/2 cup. Stymied because I generally love quiche.

My husband and I love this!  We use a frozen crust, which makes it even easier. I cut my onion and veggies and sauté them a little to soften and bring out the flavor before incorporating into the eggs. I also use only 1/2 cup of half and half. Easy and delicious!!!

Delicious! I used Mexican cheese and served with hot sauce and salsa. Didn't have a pie pan so used both the crusts from the package in a larger round baking dish. Took a bit longer but the extra crust was yummy. Should have taken the other scraps and added cinnamon and brown sugar. Next time, I'm definitely adding more meat!

I made this last night with the following changes...7 eggs, 3/4 milk, no flour, just cheddar cheese, added a few dashes of hot sauce to the eggs, baked in a Marie Callendar's deep dish pie shell. I did saute 1/2 a onion, finely chopped and a spoonful of garlic in a bit of the bacon grease. It was a fantastic quiche...a bit heavy on the cheese...I will probably do half the cheese next time and my boyfriend asked for more bacon.

I hesitate to rate this because I made so many changes to make it my own.  Different cheeses, vegetables, spices, etc.  I basically made a completely different quiche than the one listed.  However, because of the conflicting reviews regarding the instructions and the outcome, I decided to give a rating on the instructions relative to the finished product.  5 Stars!  Not runny at all, and just the right amount of filling to fill the classic 9-10 inch deep dish Pyrex glass pie dish.  Don't listen to all of the negative reviews...give this one a try.

Good; wife says it's the best. I substituted a cup of evaporated milk and used a blend of sharp Cheddar, Mexican, and freshly grated Parmesan cheeses. I also used onion powder because I didn't want to bother with sauteing an onion. I also added a little ham to the bacon.  The mild green chiles add to the mix of flavors but don't bop you on the nose. The quiche baked perfectly on time; good thing I used the glass pie plate because it did spill over a bit from my deep dish frozen pie crust. I plan to make this again and probably won't change a thing.  I had all the ingredients available and it's tasty and simple to do.

2.28.13 ... https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/22190/yummy-quiche/ ... So glad I read the review by the submitter reducing half & half - although it coulda used it.  This is extreme cheese with eggs & not much else.  Not bad, but we liked "quiche" better.  I subbed half cup ham for the bacon.  'Didn't prebake the crust & it was fine.

OMG!!!! I made this tonight and it was beyond fabulous! I left out the chilies, used 1/2 cup of  half and half (saw your correction while reading reviews),, added pepper, and used the Pillsbury pie crusts.  I also heated the onions in a bit of the bacon grease for two minutes. This was perfect in every way. Thank you for sharing!!!!!!!!!!!!

Excellent, easy to prepare quiche.  Made it for dinner and my super picky kids loved it.  Sauted onions on the stove with 3 cloves garlic, added pepper and  a little salt and used only one cup half and half.  Had a little egg batter left over so used two ramikan cups and baked along with the quiche and now we have some breakfast too! Will definitely make again!

This is a simple quiche that everyone in my family liked (even my son who hates cheese in eggs).  It came out nice and firm (not runny like some I've tried in the past).  I used 2% milk instead of 1/2 and 1/2 and it turned out fine.  Next time I'm going to add mushrooms and spinach! It does need some pepper.

Great! Very rich and tasty. The filling is too much for one pie crust though. I used 2 deep dish ones. To cut back on fat, you could use reduced fat cheeses & fat free half&half and still have an excellent quiche. I didn't have green chiles so used a can of Rotel drained and some chopped green pepper. Got the same flavor as the chiles I think.

I used this recipe as a guide for a veggie and ham quiche.  I didn't use the peppers or bacon.  I sauteed veggies and put them in the bottome of the pie pan before putting the egg/cheese mixture on top.  It turned out great but I may reduce the amount of half and half next time so it's a little more "eggy".  I will be making it again, and I'll try the chilis next time.

This was very good, but would have been even better with more peppers.  I found that it needed just a bit more zip.

This was very good and very easy to make.  As suggested by others, I cut the recipe down to 5 servings which was just enough to fill a pie shell.  I used refrigerated crescent roll dough for the crust which added to the good taste, although the long cooking time made the crust very dark.  I also substituted chives for the onions. The quiche set up nice and firm the way I like it and the overall flavor was excellent.  Even my picky husband went back for seconds.  I'll keep this recipe to use again!

This is a great recipe.  I really enjoy green chile so I used about 8 ounces of fresh chopped green chile.  I also cut the amount of half-and-half to 1/3 cup.  Thanks for the recipe.

I omitted the green chilies because they aren’t my favorite but otherwise followed the recipe. It was delicious, the eggs were fluffy and flavorful.

Idk what happened but the batter was way too much for the crust and it overflowed. I followed the directions fully.

This is such a versatile recipe.  Shake things up for a different taste, like diced ham instead of bacon, or red pepper instead of chiles.  My version has sharp cheddar cheese, bacon bits, and red/green peppers.  It's always a hit.  Plus, it freezes really well.  Slice it up before you freeze it, and you can have an elegant midweek breakfast.

It was yummy.  I will follow original poster's change of less half-and-half and more onions.

I added ham and spinach, and red and green peppers; I didn't add hot peppers because I didn't have any, but I did add red pepper flakes.  No measurements on any of those.  These additions ended up filling two pies, which was great.  I froze one after cooking.

It was really delicious. My son really enjoyed it; I added the extra meat to up the protein level because he's working out to gain weight.   I'll definitely make it again!

We made this for our Easter brunch and again two weeks later. It was an absolute hit! Everyone loved it, we used a variety of different cheeses and a pre made crust, otherwise stuck to the original recipe. We will definitely be making this a staple for our family. ??

What a super quiche recipe! I had a little bit more than my Marie Callendar pie crust, so I baked the remaining egg batter in a glass pie dish and both turned out perfect! Very well formed, great flavor, and I also added diced zucchini to it. I sautéed the onions just like someone recommended! 5 stars!

Freaking amazing.... I got distracted and forgot to add the butter until I poured the egg mixture over everything, so I haphazardly 'stirred' it in, came out perfect & no one knew. ;)

This was very delish ! Instead of bacon I browned a roll of turkey sausage, added the onions to sausage towards end of cooking to soften it.  The only other change was to add one extra egg and less cream.  I used a deep dish pie plate and puff pastry for the crust, no problem with having the pie over-flow.  This was really good, next time I will add some chopped cooked red bell pepper and maybe even cooked mushrooms.  I'll be serving this to our  ladies breakfast club, they will love it too.

It's fantastic. I also add a can of rotelle and broccoli. I also use about a 1/2 pound of ground beef if you'd like something a little heavier. It's a great starter to do whatever you'd like with.

My gf doesn't like spicy so I took out the green chiles and put in some sliced mushrooms. I've also made it as a "leftover" breakfast after a big family meal using ham instead of bacon... I love this recipe and it's always a hit!

i love this recipe,  it is very versatile and works great as a refrigerator clean out recipe. All your favorite combos work well in this arena. Any veggie I tried so far works... Mushrooms, tomatoes, all cheese, hams. Always yummy.

I've used a bunch of different quiche recipies and this made the best quiche. I used only half a cup of milk and then an extra splash - as author corrected in her comment. Used cheese on bottom and top and a bit in middle. Next time I would maybe wait 20 mins into baking before adding top cheese. Ingredients fit perfectly on deep pie crust. Cooked 50 mins.

Awesome!!! Some changes--- Only used 1/2 cup of half and half and added fresh ground pepper, garlic powder and a little mustard powder for extra flavor. Also substituted the can green pepper for fresh sautéed sweet red bell pepper. Did everything else as recipe indicated and it turned out perfect!!

Oh, my, so good! I used queso fresco instead of Jack cheese b/c I had it on hand. Used sage sausage for same reason. ½ cup half and half as suggested by Pammy. Added asparagus, too.

It looked like this was making too much for one pie shell so I doubled the eggs and split it between two pies. I added the tops of some broccoli and 5 slices of turkey lunch meat as I didn't have enough bacon for two pie shells. I also did a split of cheddar cheese and mozzarella. This was fantastic!! We finished it all in one sitting.

We lined this recipe.  Didn't have bacon so omitted.   The green chilies were subtle but apparent.   Might add more next time.  Did add a cup of chopped frozen spinach, thawed and drained.   Everyone liked it.   I would make again.  I did use 1 1/2 cups of half and half

I make this all the time!  It's fattening but worth it!  I used the base recipe but I've switched around and made it with just about everything. Ham, sausage, veggies. Comes out great every time. I suggest putting the quiche on a cookie sheet in case of spillover. Hasn't happened yet but it's been close and will save you a big mess if it's a little too full.

Followed recipe near exact - I had to use what I had on hand.  Ham replaced bacon, green onion replaced reg. onion and did not have green chilies.  Glad I made it before I read the reviews.  The first review was the recipe owner modifying the recipe to only 1/2 cup of 1/2 & 1/2 and 2 cups of onions.  I used full 1.5 cups of 1/2 and /12 and the recipe was really very very good.  Moist and puffy.  Oh - and no need for a deep dish.  If you layer with meat, cheese, onion then pour mixture slowly - it all fits perfectly into a standard pie plate.

This quiche was great and very easy to make. I lightened it up a bit by using 50% fat free cheddar cheese and 1/2 c. of 1% milk in addition to 1 c. half & half.  (It's 11 PPV for Weight Watchers prepared this way).  Yummy, filling, and satisfying for the whole family!

This was my first quiche! It came out perfectly! I stuck with the original poster's recommendation and only used 1/2 cup of half and half. I sautéed one large onion, used turkey bacon and fat free half and half. I used 6oz. Of turkey bacon, but next time will use less. I also had a fresh jalapeño pepper from my garden and used half of it instead of the green chiles. It added a very nice flavor. Can't wait to make the next one! I used Safeway brand refrigerated crust and. Placed it in a 9 inch pan.

Absolutely delish!  The only issue I had was it was too much for the pie shell.  I would cut back on the half and half and cut one of the eggs out.  Otherwise, it was amazing!

Great recipe.  My first time making quiche.  Was easy to do but a lot of work.  The end result was worth it, follow the amendmant by "Pammyg" turns out perfect.

**Read this before making it. The measurements are OFF. It can fill two store bought pie crusts (preformed).  It makes way too much for eight servings.

This is my go to quiche recipe. It's perfect for using up leftover ham or various veggies. No matter what, it always turns out perfect, as long as I remember to read the author's edit and only use 1/2 cup of milk, not what what the recipe indicates. Also, I only use 4 large eggs. Anything more and it seems excessive. I usually wind up with some extra filling (it would overflow if I used it all) which makes for a tasty omelette while you wait for the quiche to bake.

Perfect Quiche recipe! I served it for a Mother's Day Luncheon & it was a HUGE hit! The only thing I changed was using Light Cream instead of Half & Half since that was what I had on hand. I also sauteed the onions in a little bacon fat before adding to mixture. Use a deep dish pie shell as another poster suggested. FANTASTIC!

I wish I would have read the review because it was way too much for my pie pan and it overflowed all over the place.  I hope it turns out, it looks good.

Really good - I cooked the onions in the bacon grease beforehand, and used Cheddar-MJ cheese blend.  Pretty heavy, not eggy.  Needs the whole hour, even if it looks like it's done before.  I pulled it out 5 minutes early, and I don't think it was quite done in the middle.  Wonderful flavor, though, with the bacon and green chilies (I didn't drain my chilies and the quiche was still quite firm). I saw the author's review, and only used 1/2 cup of HnH.  Probably could have used closed to a cup. Never thought I would say this about any dish ever...  but maybe a little less cheese would be good.  I will definitely make again, though.  Family loved it.

Used a 9-1/2" std pyrex pie plate and this didn't even come close to overflowing, but then again, I didn't use a cup-1/2 of the half n half -- maybe that's the difference.  bake time and temp seemed right on too, even with having used only about +/- 1 cup of half n half.  Super easy, super yummy -- a bazillion different easy change-ups possible to make it your own.  You can't go wrong!

I used bacon instead of ham and it turned out great. I also took out the onions since I'm allergic and added a little red peper as well as garlic herb seasoning.
