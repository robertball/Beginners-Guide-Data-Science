I am kind of strange when it comes to "traditional" recipes, and how to review them.  On the one hand, how does the recipe taste?  On the other, does it really live up to the name?   In this case, we are talking about a very traditional Scottish soup/stew: -a-Leekie.  As far as taste goes, it is OK.  It isn't a bad chicken stew, but there is nothing particularly exciting. Hence the three out of five stars.  BUT... it is NOT a traditional -a-leekie!  The carrots are there for the broth, and should be removed before it is served.  There are no prunes in this recipe, again a part of the original dish.  These may seem like minor problems, but they are vital components to the original.  So, is this a good recipe: it's adequate, but it is not a true -a-leekie stew.

I made it with brown rice instead of barley and it turned out wonderful.  I also used only the tender part of two leeks instead of one full leek.  Healthy and tasty.  Good one-dish meal to eat at home or to take to work.

My son and I enjoyed this recipe but neither of us is crazy about barley.  I thought I'd try it with brown rice.

Really a yummy, filling, stick to your ribs kind of soup/stew. Made as directed for the most part. I did make my own chicken broth and used that in place of the chicken bouillon. And since this is a chicken soup basically, I felt that it needed much more in the way of spices and herbs other than just salt and pepper. I added bay leaves, thyme, sage, oregano, and parsley to the simmering soup. Also, the water proportions are way off for  a cup of barley. I at least doubled or tripled the amount called for and it was fine as a thick soup for dinner. After it sat awhile it still continued to absorb the liquid and is now like a porridge.  2 1/2 stars for the way it's written, 5 stars for taste and tweaks, so 4 stars overall. Relax recipe review police, it's still rated good.

This was really easy to make, and it was delicious. I made it with chicken thighs rather than a whole chicken, and it worked out just fine.  
A great winter dish!

I didn't think that -a-leekie should be thin like a soup. I cut back on the water and used grilled chicken breasts instead of a whole bird. Otherwise, great dish!
