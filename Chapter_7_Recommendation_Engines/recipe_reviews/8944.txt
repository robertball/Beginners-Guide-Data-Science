I actually left out the butter and didn't miss it - chicken was still juicy.  Even used chicken breasts. While it does seem that the nutrition info is a bit high, for those questioning baked vs. fried, you should know that baking (with half a cup of butter!!!) does not mean it's healthier than frying.  It's not JUST the method of cooking, but simply the amount of oil/butter you use.  Look here for the nutritional info for 1 cup of butter: http://www.calorie-count.com/calories/item/1145.html
Half a cup would be around 90 grams of fat and 800 calories, not including the chicken itself.  For each serving, that's over 20 grams of fat in butter alone.  Also, each serving here is 1 pound of chicken (not distinguishing white/dark meat)!  That's a big serving of chicken.  Dark meat also has significantly more fat & calories compared to breast meat (3-4 times more).

We had this for dinner last night and  everyone loved the chicken.  I used boneless chicken breasts, so I cut the cooking time by half and also used half the butter.  I doubled the spices but not the flour as well per all the other reviews.  Chicken was juicy and very good.  All the kids raved! Quick and easy.  Will make again!

Very good. I used skinless, boneless chicken breasts because my family isn't fond of bone-in chicken.  This was very good and very easy to adapt to your own tastes by adding whatever spices you like.  Next time I will add a dash of cayenne pepper.

Like everyone else, I've cooked chicken a million different ways. (Slight eggageration, maybe.) But, this is the best "fried" chicken ever!!! I'll never go back to the pan fried again. I cooked it per the recipe, except I doubled the recipe and used a package of six leg quarters. I separated the legs and thighs and had to use two pans. (Quite reasonable at $.69/lb.) The coating was as if it was fried and had a beautiful golden/brownish color. My octogenarian father raved about it as soon as it hit the table. Wife made excellent gravy..I'm good with gravy only out of a jar. The flavor was great!! This is now my new staple. Thanks Candy!!

I hate chicken skin, so I was apprehensive about making this for my husband.  The skin, when the chicken was done, snapped like a twig.  I'm going to gain ten pounds eating the skin now!
And my husband says it's the best chicken he's ever had.  (even better than his mom's!)

I couldnt stop raving about this chicken the whole time I was eating it!
I used bone in breasts and I tried 1 with the skin on and 1 with the skin off. I liked the one without skin better as it allowed the seasonings to really penetrate the meat. The meat stayed so moist. I doubled all the spices, didnt use sage and added a touch of cayenne pepper. I also added onion powder and garlic powder. A keeper in my recipe box!!

Good chicken! I added some garlic powder and onion powder to the flour mixture and it was soooo good! Also, I removed the skin before cooking and it came out just as crispy and tasty.

This turned out very well. I feared that it would be too bland for our tastes as written, so I made some minor adjustments to ensure the chicken would be flavorful. I did soak the chicken in salt water for about an hour to draw out the blood, but that's just a personal preference. To the seasoning mix, I used heaping measurements of all the spices listed, plus added 1/2 teaspoon of both  onion powder and garlic powder. I also seasoned the chicken itself with garlic powder and black pepper before "shaking". Came out of the oven really crispy and had great flavor. We enjoyed it, thank you :)

My husband really liked this recipe.  I used boneless skinless chicken breasts instead of bone-in.  I also used seasoned salt instead of regular salt, and I added a couple dashes of garlic and onion powder.  Oh and I added a bit more paprika for color.  The chicken was tender, and the "crust" was flavorful.  Will use this recipe again!

Replace the flour with 50/50 bread or corn flake crumbs and freshly grated parmisan cheese. Onion and garlic wouldn't be out of place either, as well as a pinch of cayanne.

This was very good. I did chang two things. I used boneless skinless breast (less fat and calories) and instead of butter in the pan I brushed the chicken with olive oil before coating and bake less time. The chicken was moist and tasty and the change to olive oil reduced the fat and calories and also gave me one of my daily healthy oils for weight watchers.

This is my go to favorite!! Over time, in an attempt to make it healthier, I've started doubling the recipe and making it with whole wheat flour, oat or wheat bran and some flax meal. I also coat my pan with olive oil instead of butter.  LOVE IT!!

I followed the recipe as written and it was delicious! You may want to double up the spices for more flavor though. That's what I did the second time around because I loved this recipe and I knew that if I doubled it, it would be better, and I was right!

I've made this several times, both with and without the skin on the chicken. both are good. To make this with olive oil instead of butter, use about half the oil as there is butter called for (so, for 6 servings, use 1/4 to 1/3 of a cup). Put the oil in the bottom of your pan but DON'T put the pan in the oven until it is almost done preheating--when it reaches about 375 or 400 degrees, depending on how quickly your oven heats. this will allow the oil to get hot and then sear the chicken without smoking. then just cook as directed.

I use italian breadcrumbs with the flour. Add any type of spices that you like. Instead of butter, I use butter flavored pam. Cuts down the the calories.

Made this the other night and the family loved it. I read reviews and like others, I used bone in chicken thighs, reduced the butter to 4 Tbsp & doubled the spices. I started with 2 Tbsp of butter then when flipping the chicken, after 20 minutes, added another 2 for the last 20 minutes. I also used a 12 inch cast iron skillet.

The chicken was KFC crispy on the outside & moist & tender on the inside. There was NO LEFTOVERS, & I wished I had made a couple more pieces. A little red pepper would spice it up a bit for those who prefer it that way.

This is sooo good! When I first saw how simple the recipe was, I thought to myself that it wouldn't be too tasty; however, I was wrong! My family (including my toddler) loved it! I substituted olive oil instead of butter and removed the skins to make it a little healthier and it was so flavorful...tastes like fried chicken.

I fixed this chicken for a family birthday celebration, and every piece disappeared!  It was delicious & have already passed the recipe on to other family members.  I followed the recipe exactly, and it turned out perfectly.  :)

I used half the butter and it still came out perfect. It was a little bland for my taste, even though I upped the spices. I gave it 5 stars because the cooking method is excellent and I'm sure I can work out the seasoning issue.

This recipe caught my attention because I was raised with the original "Shake&Bake" and I always helped.  I tired this, with the help of my daughter, and it came out just like I remember!  I did add a few extra spices - a teaspoon each of garlic powder, dried parsley and Old Bay seasoning - and it was wonderful!  I made it with drumsticks and my kids loved it.  I will reduce the amount of butter next time to 1/4 cup or less. Overall this recipe was, quick, easy and really tasty!

Very good and simple recipe. I have made it with and without the butter. When I made it with the butter, it came out a bit soggy and greasy. I also used it with pork steaks and added a couple tsp of garlic powder, came out great! Thanks!

Excellent!! Doubled the recipe and used approx 6 lbs of chicken. Added 2 teaspoons of Lawrys Seasoned Salt to the flour mixture and that made all the difference - it would have been very bland without it I think. I sprayed the bottom of the pan with Pam Butter spray. Chicken came fantastic. Baked at 450 for 20 min each side and it was perfect. 5 and 6 year old are begging me to make it again!

I made this recipe for my in-laws and it was a huge success.  The chicken came out juicy and tender, it was very delicious and very easy to make.  The only change was I used chicken breasts rather than cutting up a whole chicken.

Very delicious.  No need for butter.  I also added garlic and onion powder.  I served with red skin potatoes which I halved and mixed with fresh parsley, chives, salt and olive oil.  They baked in the same time as the chicken.

I didn't have sage so substituted poultry seasoning.  Also added 1/2 tsp. onion powder ans 1/2 tsp garlic powder, and cut back butter to 1/4 cup.

Great recipe! The chicken turns out really juicy, tastes just like down south fried chicken without the mess. I also tried using in with pork chops instead, and it still tasted delicious.  One suggestion, try using Lawry's seasoned salt instead of regular, it adds a little kick.

This is sooooo good!  I use 1/2 butter and 1/2 olive oil.  I also add additional spices such as onion/garlic powder, extra paprika, cayenne and some Penzey's Northwoods seasoning.  The family devoured it - thank you for posting this recipe!

Delicious! I used raw chicken tenders instead of chicken with skin or chicken breasts. Instead of butter I just drizzled a tiny bit of olive oil in the pan! SOO good! Tasted like the chicken had skin when it didn't and almost tasted like KFC chicken! Will definitely make again!

Overall, a really good recipe and a nice alternative to pan-fried chicken or buying it at a store deli or fast food restaurant.  I used a somewhat larger amount of chicken, 5 pounds of drumsticks and thighs (7 drumsticks, 5 thighs), so I decided to double the coating mixture to make sure there was enough for all the pieces.  As per other reviews, I doubled the spices (actually quadrupled since I doubled the flour) and added 1 tsp. each garlic powder and onion powder.  I also substituted 1/2 tsp. poultry seasoning for the sage.  I was impressed by the fact that the coating stayed dry all the way to the last piece of chicken--didn't get wet and clump up like some coatings do.  I used a 15"x10" pan and I actually used two sticks of margarine (1 cup) so the entire bottom of the pan would be coated.  I cooked the chicken 25 minutes per side so it would come out crispy and golden brown, turning it only once, which is a rule of thumb for successful fried chicken.  Forgive me if I sound excessive to some of you, but it did come out delicious and moist, and a fair amount of the margarine went in the grease can.  There was just a bare minimum of sticking to the pan (a couple of the drumsticks), and the skin stayed on all of the pieces.  Served it with microwave baked potatoes that I prepared while the chicken was in the oven, and sliced carrots.  Great dinner that my husband and son both gobbled up!

This was wonderful! I used chicken breasts with no skin sliced into strips.  The chicken turned out crispy, tender, and juicy.  This is the only way I will 'fry' chicken.  This would be great on salads too.  So easy yet so delicious.

Yummy!!!  Very picky kids even ate this!  I will be making again!  Important to note... MUST use real butter.  I imagine that makes all the difference. It would NOT be the same with margarine. AT ALL.   And I just LOVE the sage in this... yummm!

I used only 2 lbs of boneless, skinless chicken breasts and they were still very juicy.  Doubled the paprika, sage and black pepper.  Also, added little bit of ground red pepper, onion powder, and parmesan cheese.  And used only a couple of tablespoons of butter.  Came out juicy and crispy and delicious!!

I am  just learning to cook and I found this recipe SUPER easy. My 8 year old helped me and she loved the result too. My 11 year old gave it a "10." I used only half the amount of butter that it called for, doubled the spice amount but kept the flour amount the same, added some garlic powder to the flour, and didn't add sage since I didn't have any on hand. This has been an every week dinner. Tender and juicy EVERY TIME.

This recipe was PERFECT! Very quick, very simple. This was the first time in months, the family sat down to eat, and no one complained about the food. I paired it with simple green beans, and easy macaroni (thank you Velveeta!). Fantastic recipe. I will surely be using it again.

I love this chicken, it's become a family favorite.  I add a couple of splashes of cayanne pepper to the flour mix.  It adds a little kick to the chicken.

TIPS:

FORGET THE BAG! I always find more is wasted than used. I sprinkle it on, much better control, not much waste if the meat is all pushed together.

And also some fine ground corn flour. 

Great tasting chicken!

A better option is seal the chicken first on stove top, 5 minutes on both sides.  Then place in oven.  A lot healthier and it is oven fried where as the oil drips off.  Still as tender as this recipe.

The chicken was good but no different then regular baked chicken, just more calories. I followed the recipe exactly as posted. I expected it to taste like fried chicken. If I just wanted baked chicken I wouldn't have taken on the extra calories with the flour coating and baking in butter. No I would not recommend this recipe to friends

Not bad. I really loaded up on all the seasonings (a tablespoon each of paprika and sage, half a tablespoon of pepper) except the salt and omitted the butter because I thought it would make the dish too greasy. The skin was the best part of the dish. It was very crispy. I think it could have used a little something extra though. I might make it again but I think I'll add some rosemary and thyme next time.

Can I give it 6 STARS? It was great and so much cheaper than store bought! Crispy and juicy. My family loved it. The changes I made was adding 1/2 tsp garlic powder and 1/2 tsp season all salt. I also decreased the butter to 1/4 cup. PERFECT!!!

We all loved this! Very tasty! I was looking for a recipe for chicken drumsticks, and this was perfect for them. I like the fact that they're baked, because I don't have too much luck deep frying drumsticks...the outside cooks alot faster for me than the insides, and I certainly don't want undercooked meat. So this was good, and the meat cooked just right. Thanks for sharing this recipe Candy!!

I made this on a whim after finding it in my email.  It was perfect because I had all the ingredients and it would be a fast meal.  I omitted the butter to keep it healthier, lower in fat and calories... it didn't need it.  I did spray the dish with some cooking spray. I used only breast tenderloins  They came out tasty and juicy. I also added a little extra spices.  I used poultry seasoning instead of just sage and I added a little of my hot spice to give it some kick.  My husband couldn't stop raving.  Kids liked it, too.  This is a great 'go to' meal when you need something fast and easy.

It wasn't the seasoning/spices that made this recipe for me as much as it was the "technique." I have never cooked chicken pieces like this before, was always told to cook chicken "LOW HEAT" for tender chicken, but this recipe was Fantastic! The chicken was tender and cooked to perfection. Thanks for a great recipe!

Very, very good and super easy.  I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts and added some onion and garlic powder for personal taste.  I made this tonight and we gobbled it up.  Thanks for the recipe.

This was okay but I wouldn't make it again. I cut the butter back to 3-4 tbs and it was still pretty greasy. Plus I added a lot of seasoning and it didn't really have much flavor. I used all drumsticks. The skin was the best part, as it usually is w/ fried chicken.

This was an easy and tasty recipe.  I only did half of the recipe, in the event that I didn't like and wouldn't waste.  I also used less butter and olive oil as others suggested.  It had a nice flavor, as I thought it would be bland.  It was just right!  A nice way to have fried chicken not cooked in oil!  Thanks for sharing!

Loved this. Did use reviewer suggestions and used boneless/skinless breasts. I also used olive oil instead of butter and I added a bit of garlic powder. Quick and easy and best of all, delish. New family favorite.

Everyone in my family loved it and ate it.  That is hard to do with 3 kids under 6 and a picky husband.  I added some onion powder and used sea salt instead of regular salt.  It would be nice a little spicer with some cayenne, but I think then my kids wouldn't eat it.

I fixed this baked chicken for my mom's 80th birthday dinner. It was a winner by the whole family especially by my sweet husband. I used thighs and legs and changed the spices somewhat. I added onion powder, garlic powder, salt and pepper. I left out the paprika and sage. Also I used only 1/4 cup of butter, as suggested by others. I will be making this again. Thanks Candy for this great idea!

We made it healthier by using boneless, skinless breasts and omitted the butter, using non-stick cooking spray. We loved it, even my picky DH was impressed. I served the chicken with mashed potatoes and cole slaw; all the taste of KFC at a 1/4 of the price!

We like our chicken a little crispier, so we use 1/4 cup all purpose flour and 1/4 cup corn starch. I also add a teaspoon of cayenne pepper.

I read a bunch of reviews so just brushed my chicken and pan with olive oil as some others did. The chicken stuck to the pan and was dry and overcooked. If I make this again, I will use the butter.

Used olive oil to coat the bottom of the dish, added 1/2 tsp each of garlic powder and onion powder. Used 1 tsp of poultry seasoning because I didn't have sage. The chicken was ok, not very flavourful and it just wasn't as good as I had hoped. I'll stick to using store-bought shake and bake seasoning for now.

The name is a little deceiving, its more like oven fried chicken, but still turned out great. I omitted the sage and added cayenne pepper and garlic powder I also used crisco instead of butter. I made 7lbs of it for whole family and there was only a few pieces left. I suggest adding a lot more of the spices than it calls for, I didn't measure just kinda dumped it in there. It was a little greasy and I put it on rack to "dry" after it was done. Definitley a keeper recipe though.

Easy but satisfying dish!  When we crave for a healthy alternative to KFC, we make this.  My modifications are as follows > 1. I substitute chili powder for paprika, and thyme for sage, since I have neither. > 2. I double spices (thyme and pepper), and add equal amount of celery seeds.  > 3. I substitute oil for the butter since I do not usually keep some butter. 

This is a very good base recipe.

Pretty darn good for such an easy recipe.  Cut the butter in half though because it can get pretty greasy.  I drained the excess butter in the end and let the chicken get nice and toasty.  It was delish!

I followed others' reviews and added some 1/2 tsp each ground garlic and onion. I also brined the chicken for as long as possible before taking out of the brine and drying the chicken pieces for shaking them in the flour and spices mixture; the result is wonderful. Even my MIL asked for the recipes and that had never happened with anything I made. Thanks for sharing.

I used boneless skinless chicken breasts.  All my delicious crispy coating ended up in a puddle in the bottom of the pan.  Kind of disappointing.  I even reduced the butter, but it still came out soggy.  I will have to try try again.

Fantastic.  Just the kind of thing I like - simple and it tastes good.  I liked the top reviewer's suggestion of leaving out the butter, but I did use a little bit of it rather than leave it out completely - about a tablespoon of butter and another of olive oil.  Thanks for a quick, easy recipe where I can control the salt and know exactly what's in the coating.

I am rating this 5 stars because I have five in my family and we all thought it was awesome! I used boneless skinless chicken thighs and cut back on the butter. Also added some garlic powder and onion powder as some had suggested. Will be making this again soon!

This was amazing! My son and husband couldn't get enough! I am so excited that I have a new recipe that is SO easy and so delicious for chicken. I cut down the margerine by half, but the next time I'm going to try olive oil and see how that comes out. I wanted to taste the recipe this way first before playing around.

Good, easy recipe for chicken.  You can add any spices/herbs to the flour mixture to change it up & make it lots of different ways.  To cut down on the butter, just bake the chicken skin side up the whole time, and 10 min. before it's done brush with a bit of melted butter (can even cut that with olive or canola oil) for the crispy skin - yum!

The chicken is delicious and moist ... lots of calories ... so don't eat too much ... it smells wonderfully as it is cooking ... I used "I can't believe it's not butter" rather than real butter ... probably as high in calories???  I mixed with just a tat of real butter for flavor ... it is beautiful chicken ... but the cleanup of my pan is going to be difficult ... so be careful and take that into consideration ...

Very good!  A simple and tasty alternative to the expensive packaged chicken coatings.  We will definately make this again!

Great starter recipe! A summary from all the reviews is:  Make the spices your own!!  I sprayed my baking dish and chicken parts (prior to flour coating) with butter flavored Pam.  Of course I threw in some of my trusty Emeril's seasoning to boost the flavor.  Good stuff - a regular in our house and a great use for those more economical (bone in w/skin) cuts of chicken we are using in these tough $$ times. Highly recommend!!!

This was great, but the spices were on the bland side so I doubled it (except the salt) the next time. The chicken was crisp and flavorful, much like baked fried chicken! I'll definitely be making this again when I want a quick and easy dinner.

I LOVED this recipe cuz it calls for REAL chicken, not boneless, skinless chunks of chicken, my family is fond of bone in chicken and this one worked well for us!  tyvm for posting it.  i DID add more seasonings and sprayed the baking pan with oil rather than the butter but was still wonderful.  We are fans of leg quarters and I take delight when I seem recipes for something OTHER than "boneless skinless breasts"  UGHHH

I used the same amount of plain breadcrumbs instead of flour, and added garlic powder and cayenne pepper.  It came out really good.

I made this tonight for dinner. I have 4 very-hard-to-please sons and one husband whose favorite saying is "Chicken....again?" Not tonight!! Even he loved it. And my 4 yr old, who never ever eats dinner, ate every last bit of chicken on his plate.
 I used boneless, skinless chicken breast and it came out super juicy and tasty. I doubled all the spices per others' reviews and added 2tsp of onion powder as well. Will definitely make again!!

I had some chicken and was in search of something new and came upon this.  It is great however I used none of the spices it called for I just used my favorites out of the spice rack.  Cajun Seasoning, Garlic Powder, Onion Salt, White Pepper, Cumin, and some roasted garlic pepper.  It was easy, the chicken was very moist and crunchy.  Everyone loved it and it was so easy serve with a veggie and you have a full meal!  Oh I also added a piece of cheese on top and let it melt what yummy goodness it was.  I will be using this again the great thing is that you can pretty much add whatever spices you want to the dish and the chicken will turn out great.  I did cut the butter down to ¼ cup and it worked just fine I also used chicken breast which were great!  Thanks!

Very quick and easy.  Normally, I follow the recipe to the letter, the first time I do it, but so many other suggested adding garlic powder that I could not over look that.  I also added a little onion powder as well.  Everything else was according to the recipe.
This was very moist, tasty, and best of all, easy to do.  Thanks Candy

This has become a staple at my house.  My kids even like it.  I cut the butter in half (at least) and, if I could get PAM in Switzerland, I'd try that instead of butter.  I also throw in whatever spices I feel like (cumin, cayenne pepper, ginger, you name it) along with the paprika and salt.  A good, basic recipe.

I took the advice of other reviewers and cut the butter - only used 2 T.  Also had to cook the breast pieces about 10-15 min. longer.
This one was a hit, especially with the kids.

the chicken was so moist.  Definately will use less butter next time.  Possibly even cook it a bit shorter.

I actually didn't have sage, so substituted poultry seasoning and this was a hit in our family!  Instead of flour I used panko crumbs.

This is my go-to chicken recipe! Even though there is a lot of butter, you are not eating all of it. Some of it is absorbed but most is left in the juices afterward.

EASY and DELICIOUS chicken - however, I made a few modifications.   You don't need that much butter, 2 Tablespoons worked for me.   I added garlic and onion powder and didn't have sage so substituted poultry seasoning.   My suggestion - make extra to have cold the next day.

Followed this recipe exactly, just seasoned the chicken with salt, pepper, and garlic salt, before coating in the flour...and I also doubled the recipe (we have a family of 6). Perfect....perfect....perfect. Thank you!

When I first saw this recipe I thought it was just like the "oven fried chicken" I've been making for years. And it is except it is baked a little differently. Mine called for covering the chicken with tin foil the first 20 minutes. I decided to try it this way thinking it would be dry, but was I wrong. This was wonderful and tasted better than the one I had been making. My husband couldn't stop raving about it.

I left out the paprika and sage as we are not "a lot of spices" kind of people but it was still very tasty, crunchy on the outside and moist inside. And soooo easy. Will be making this again. Thank you.

Great quick recipe. I used fresh garlic to the flour mixture and i usually leave it marinating longer, about 1 hour. I also reduced in the butter, like some reviews commented and It didn't alter the flavor at all. Very yummy,family loves when I make it. Definitely a keeper!

This is nothing close to fried chicken,but it's SO GOOD!I used olive oil and the results were a wonderful ooey-gooey TASTY chicken so tender and delicious. I could almost eat the bones! I used two huge breast(bone in) and it took a little longer because of their size but it came out perfect. I added a few pepper flakes,garlic powder,and some bread crumbs..otherwise same recipe. AWESOME!

Really, really good chicken. Was looking for a simple alternative to breaded chicken. I needed to make it gluten free, so I substituted Pamela's Gluten Free Baking Mix for the flour here and it worked perfectly. I didn't shake it but just dredged it in the flour in a large bowl. My husband said we'll never have to buy KFC again - and even my very picky 5-year-old, who usually refuses meat of any type, ate his entire serving. The only thing I'd add is that I think you could get away with slightly less butter. Ours turned out really dripping in butter. Perhaps I didn't use enough chicken, but next time I'll try with 2/3 the butter and go from there. Thanks for the terrific recipe!

This turned out really well. Unfortunately I only had boneless and skinless chicken thighs so it was my own fault that they overcooked a bit. I can't blame the recipe for that, and my guys still loved the flavor and crispness. Next time I will get a whole chicken and cut it up as suggested.  I used two pans, one glass, one metal. It was interesting and my husband pointed out, that the chicken in the glass pan turned out crispier than the metal.

I used boneless chicken breasts, so I cut the cooking temp to 400 degrees, but cooked full time.  It was so tender and yummy.  Used half the butter, 1/2 c. flour, 2 1/2 tsp seasoned salt, 2 tsp paprika, 1/2 tsp rosemary or sage & 1/2 tsp. black pepper.

This is the best baked chicken I have made!  I used thin-sliced, skinless, boneless chicken breasts.  I added garlic powder, just because I add garlic to just about everything, but otherwise made the recipe as written.  At first I thought an entire stick of butter seemed like too much, but it really makes the chicken, and it is the perfect amount.  All the boys, including my picky 5-yr. old said this was their favorite chicken so far!  Yay!  Thanks for a great, easy recipe!!!

Great oven fried chicken. I used boneless chicken and dipped the pieces in melted butter before dredging in the flour mix. I added some Panko bread crumbs to the flour mix. I did add some extra butter as it seemed to need it before I turned the pieces over. The breading did come off when I turned these, but it didn't affect the meal. Very good and very easy too. I will be fixing this again.

Great with boneless thighs! I made this using six boneless, skinless chicken thighs, added 1/4 tsp cayenne and 1/4 tsp mustard to add a little flavor and 3 Tbsp. olive oil instead of butter in the pan. Baked for 30 minutes, tested for doneness. It was perfect, well flavored, crispy brown. I will definitely make this again and again.

This was good and so easy! I'm giving it four stars because I followed the seasonings exactly and thought it could have been a little more flavorful. Next time, I might add a little more salt and the garlic and onion powders as others suggested. But this is a great base to which you can add and experiment for a lot of variations.

Need it low carb?  Substitute soy flour for the all-purpose flour and you're good to go!  I've been making my own version of this for a few years using Slap Ya Mama seasoning and it's a favorite in our house.  Works for pork chops, too.

I really liked this recipe, but I made some healthier changes. First, I do not care for sage. So I added oregano (same measurements as the sage) and hard aged Parmesan cheese (two tablespoons). 

Then, I heated up an oil called high five omega cooking oil instead of butter.  It came out amazingly tender and juicy and my husband loved it.

The seasoning did not penetrate the chicken so next time I'm going to take the skin off and add onion and garlic powder as well as use very little butter.

I just tried this recipe (as is) and the coating was awesome but the chicken was way overcooked for my tastes. Next time I will use a thermometer half way through the cooking process to ensure I don't end up with "gray" chicken again. Other than that this recipe is awesome and I will try it again. Thanks! :^)

I used boneless skinless chicken breasts and the 40 minute cooking time was just a little too much.  I also used a small amount of olive oil instead of butter on the bottom of the cooking dish.  The flavor was excellent and it was a quick way to make some yummy chicken.  The only thing I would change next time would be to decrease the cooking time.

Wow, talk about simple and flavourful. I upped the spices by 1/2, but double I think would work too. I didn't have sage, so used poultry seasoning, also seasoned salt and added 1 tsp of garlic powder. I used deboned/skinless turkey thighs and cooked a little longer. By about halfway through, the smoke from the butter compelled me to turn the oven down to 400. Next time I will start at 400, plenty hot enough. Delicious kentucky fried chicken flavour.

We made this recipe as indicated, but did add a few more spices as some others have advised.  I did use a little oil place of the some of the butter, but the oil and butter stayed in the bottom of the pan.  It was very good and will be made again.  The chicken came  out with light brown, crunchy  coat and very moist inside.

Excellent base recipe! I also add any fresh herbs I have...or some extra spice for some kick (like curry). Have used this several times in the past couple of months. Works on the grill, in the oven, or in the frying pan for chicken.

This was great! I made this as written.  The chicken was moist and not the least bit dry.   I don't eat the skin, but having the skin on the chicken and dipping it in the flour mixture sealed in the juices. 
Will try this with boneless chicken next and experiment with different herbs and spices.

I absolutely loved this recipe. My chicken has never tasted so good. This will be the way I cook my chicken from now on. I will be leaving out the butter for a healthier option. The chicken comes outs sooo juicy and flavorful. 5 stars all the way.

Great tasting baked/fried chicken that has less of mess and more taste! This recipe is perfection all I did was add more garlic powder because I love garlic and 2 Tablespoons of Adobo. 
FYI - IMPORTANT, if you don't want your chicken to come out soggy it is imperative that you preheat the oven (like recipe states) and first make sure the butter has melted in the tray before placing the chicken (skin down first) on tray! These are a hit and definitely worth 5 stars!

This was very good. I would also increase the spices a little and found it tasted a bit too buttery, which is why I "only" gave it 4 stars.
I used smoked paprika as I was out of normal paprika. I also had no sage so used a  couple of other herbs and spices.
My 4 year old who doesn't eat much had 2 drumsticks!
Next time I will use a little butter and a little sunflower oil but probably use half the fat. I just don't think it needs quite that much.
For those worried about all that fat: a lot of it stays in the pan and is not eaten. So it's not quite as fatty as it sounds.
I will definitely make it again. So easy and foolproof.

Very good recipe. I used boneless, skinless chicken thighs. Turned out very moist with nice flavor. I ate leftovers the next day - just as good reheated in the microwave.

Very tasty , although for health concerns, I cut the butter amt. in half, and added 2tbsp canola oil. I also added about a tsp each of garlic and onion powder. My biggest complaint was it stuck to the dish, although it was still swimming in fat even after I reduced the fat. It really did taste good, though.

Tender an juicy... everyone enjoyed it!  I did about 3 Tbs. butter and 2 of Olive Oil in the pan.  That helps make it a little healthier.

It was a little dry, and even with garlic and onion added, didn't have a lot of flavor. I used just a little oil on the bottom of the baking dish, and the flour mixture tended to come off when I turned it. A little experimentation is in order. It was quick, easy, and used ingredients I had on hand, which was a plus. I think there is great potential...

I've been making my own shake and bake chicken and pork for a few years now.  This is a good recipe!  For something different, you can also try curry and paprika or for an oriental flare try some wetting it with low-sodium soy then shake with whole wheat bread crumbs, ginger - out of this world!

I made this using a cut up fryer. I removed all of the skin first then shaked it in the spices. I also sprayed my baking dish with butter flavor Pam and omitted the butter to make it healthier. It didn't come out as crispy as it probably would have had I used the butter, but it was still very good. My family enjoyed it and it was definatley a healthier alternative to fried chicken.

Very good. I ran out of paprika, so I used a pinch of cinnamon instead and it came out wonderful! My mom look at me like I was crazy when I told her what I put in the recipe but she was the first one to grab a chicken when it was done.

Very good chicken, its moist and flavorful, I did add some a garlic and onion spices and a little parmasan. I kind of prefer this to a bunch of crust on the chicken, less messy too. I used half the butter called for and it was perfect. The butter gave it a nice flavor. This will be made again. good!

This blows store-bought Shake n' Bake right out of the water! I make this gluten free and casein free by using a gluten free all purpose flour blend and Earth Balance margarine instead of traditional flour and butter. My only change to the recipe otherwise is to use 1/2 tsp of salt instead of the full teaspoon.  I'm afraid to make it for company because my husband and I keep polishing off the entire pan of chicken all by ourselves in one sitting.. it's THAT good!!!  Neither of us likes to eat chicken skin, but this recipe is the lone exception.  We actually divide the skin right down the middle.  If you don't like chicken skin, I highly recommend taking a bite of THIS chicken skin.  It is AMAZING.  Absolutely FABULOUS recipe!!!

This was good. I accidentally pulled a bag of wings from the freezer instead of the chicken legs I was looking for, but it worked perfectly on the wings. They were even better the 2nd day.

Chicken turned out moist and tender with the amount of time as directed, but the seasoning was bland. I ended up adding salt and pepper to it after it was done cooking and everyone at the table said they like it but it could use more flavoring. Otherwise a fairly good recipe. =)

This was really good!!  We really enjoy our "normal" seasonings, so thats exactly what I did!!  I seasoned the chicken on either side and pressed it in.  The I seasoned the flour in the baggy.  Dipped the chicken in and put it in the pan.  Really good!!

Delicious and cooked like a dream! For flavor, I added 1 tspn cumin and 1 tspn cajun seasoning; I also added some onion and garlic powder to the four mix. Instead of butter, I sprayed the pan and the chicken (before and after dipping) with PAM butter flavor. No stick, good flavor and yummy crisp.

wowwwwwsas. like a reviewer said, the butter does add a lot of fat but i made sure to put just a little so the chicken wouldnt stick.. but actually, i don't think you need any butter at all because the meat itself cooks out some fat and so your meat will still brown and be crispy! i made chicken breast and it was moist!! i was pretty surprised. as to the seasoning for the flour.. i dont consider sage one of the typical spices people have laying around.. at least i dont. so i just shaked the chicken in a mixture of flour, salt, pepper, some dried minced onions, and some garlic powder.. whatever tastes good, put it in!! i know some people shake it in bags, etc but i shook it in some tupperware. very fun!!!

Very Good and easy. We always try to eat healthy. I mostly cook with skinless chicken. Increased pepper to a 1/2 tsp. Added 1 tsp each of onion powder and garlic powder. Coated pan with cooking spray instead of butter.

This recipe was fantastic!  It's really chicken oven-fried in butter--certainly not the healthiest "baked" chicken recipe--but Wow! My teenage boys and their friends raved about this dish!  It is so simple and so delicious--this will definitely be a regular treat for my family.

We really enjoyed this recipe! A couple of reviews helped me modify so that my husband (who normally does not like dark meat bone-in chicken) was licking his fingers when he finished.  I used 1/4 c unsalted butter and melted it in the microwave before. Then I put that in my cast iron skillet. I used about 2 lbs. chicken pieces and 1/4 c flour, doubled all the spices from the amounts listed, and added 1 tsp garlic powder. Baked for 25 minutes to get it good and crispy and then turned the chicken and followed the rest of the recipe as written. I did also shake the chicken in a paper bag which worked really well. Loved it and will make again and again!

I love this recipe. I make the coating as is, but when cooking, I leave out the butter. I spray a preheated iron skillet with cooking spray, place the chicken in the skillet and pop it into the oven. It comes out nice and crispy every single time! YUM!

This was really good.. never tried this before. Instead of flour we used cracker crumbs. Worked really nicely. outside was crunchy, inside juicy. we used boneless skinless chicken breasts and timing was about right, 40 min.

This is a really good recipe. I let my chicken soak in buttermilk first.[for a few hours] Then I followed the recipe. The only problem was it was going to be done before my mashed potatoes were.LOL. That was ok, chicken holds its' heat well. Thanks for the recipe. It's great! If your in the mood for Fried Chicken, but you don't have the time I suggest this. It's a forgiving recipe for spices.

Very good flavor.  I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts.  I should say that I did not cook the chicken in butter.  Once seasoned with the mix, I sprayed cooking spray over both sides to moisten it a bit.  I also should have sprayed the pan because some of the flour/seasoning mix stuck to the pan.  I know for next time, and I will definitely use this recipe again.  It is quick and easy and very tasty.

Easy and delicious!  My kids and husband ate every bite tonight!

I would use less butter next time, but it did help add to a yummy crisp coating.

I used boneless/skinless chicken breast.

Simple and Delicious. Used boneless skinless chicken breast instead and modified spices to the ones I had in my pantry at the time, a little bit of Cajun seasoning, garlic powder, Italian seasoning, and seasoned salt with the flour and it was a hit! My husband loved it!

I did tweak the recipe a bit but the entire family loved it. I used about seven chicken legs so I had to increase the amount of flour and seasonings. I added lots of garlic powder and cajun seasoning. I also added onion powder to the mix. I know that everyone is about healthy but fried chicken was my goal, so I actually used more butter than stated. I put 3/4 a stick of butter for the first part of baking and added another 1/2 stick when I turned the legs. I wanted them to be crispy and still juicy...and they were. I love fried chicken but I hate making it in a skillet due to the grease spattering and the tiny deep fryer I have takes way too long to make a meal for 6. So this is the perfect way to do it...I have requests to make it again this week!! Thank you....

Made this tonight and we all loved it, including the sometimes picky kids! This was enough coating for 17 meaty wings. I only put half the salt fearing it would be too salty but then ended up salting my wings so next time I'll put the full amount or might use some seasoned salt. This is every bit as good as the store-bought "oven fry" mix. We cooked just a bit longer and decided it could have gone even longer to get more crispy. Will definitely use this recipe again!

This was super easy and very moist. I added some extra seasonings- onion powder, garlic powder, chili powder and rosemary. I also added extra pepper. I will make these again.

Great recipe! I followed the suggestion of baking in a cast iron frying pan but used canola oil. I also changed the spicing a little, adding garlic powder and onion powder. Thanks for the recipe, I will definitely use it again.

The flavor of the seasonings didn't really knock my socks off.  I used skinless chicken breasts . . perhaps next time I will try chicken with the skin on.

it was good tasting, i added garlc powder,season salt, bay powder, p/salt, and some dryed onion bitz, in the flour. just make sure to watch how long u cook it, it really only does take 20min on each side, even for thick breast, thats what i used, i left it in for 20 on one side and 30 on the other, and it was way to dry and tough....but good flavor.....so next time i will not go over the time, maybe even check it before the time is done....

I tried this again, but this time I coated the chicken with an egg and milk mixture before putting it in the seasoning.  I added crushed regular flavor chips to add a little crispness to it.  Instead of flipping the chicken as others have suggested I just sprayed the tops with butter flavored cooking spray.  Turned out pretty good!!

It was the juciest chicken I ever had and it was pretty crispy, but it was rather bland to us. I suggest adding some tabasco or some gravy for some flavor once it's served.

Excellent! I've got to say that I never eat chicken with the skin but I left it on for this recipe - glad I did. The flavor was to die for. Will make this one of my chicken dishes of choice!

I wish I could give this 4 1/2 stars, it was so good.  It smelled mouth watering while cooking.  I made as directed, but used drumsticks, because that's what we all like.  Also, I admit, added a shake of onion powder and garlic powder to the flour...instead of regular salt I used something new I found at the store yesterday-it's called Krazy mixed up seasonings/ original mixed-up salt.  YUM.  I think it added a kick to the crust on this chicken.  Which, by the way, browned very nicely in the margarine that I used.  I did cut back on that a little, too.  Delicious dinner, will definitely make again next week!  Thanks!

Pretty Good overall.  The sage flavor was a little strong so I think I'll try a different spice combination next time.  My husband said it was pretty good for baked chicken-if it's not grilled or fried it's not food to him.

I just made this tonight and it was a good variety from fried chicken. I also used olive oil rather than butter- healthier but a different taste. With this recipe- you can really experiment with all kinds of spices.

This was a very easy and yummy recipe. My husband and I loved it. I used chicken breasts too. I did add some onion and garlic powder but I think next time I'll add a little more paprika too because it wasn't quite "season-y" enough for us. Also took others tips and lined my pan with foil which made for a no-mess clean-up!

My family loved this recipe.  I added some ground chipotle pepper to the coating mixture and it was delicious.  Really quick and easy to prepare.  I did, however, add about ten minutes to the cooking time because I used really large bone-in split chicken breasts.

Because I've developed an intolerance to gluten products I used a gluten free flour,  I left the rest of the ingredients the same.  Husband is not into GF foods so naturally I didn't tell him I made the switch.  After one bite he was impressed and even said it was excellent.

Family loved this chicken! I reduced the amount of butter by at least half the amount the second time I made it. Even better when I reduced the fat.  I won't fry chicken again now that I have this recipe.

This is just delicious. Up the garlic and paprika, add onion salt, s/p. Double coat chicken and bake with foil. The most amazing gravy.  So easy and so adaptable.

I tried this recipe after reading some reviews and doubled the spices. I also brushed olive oil on the chicken before I dipped it in the flour w/parmesan. In addition I did only use 1/4 cup butter and it was enough for our tastes. It came out tender, moist and the covering was really tasty.I will make this recipe again since my family thoroughly enjoyed the chicken!

Easy and excellent. I doubled all of the spices except the salt and used 1 tsp of lowrys seasoning instead of sage and added 1 tsp of pepper.Great recipe!

This was terrific! 
Heeded some recommendations - put a little butter in the 9x13 pan melted it/preheated as the oven came to temp. Used boneless skinless breasts cut vertically into 4 or 5 pieces each. Used some flour, panko, parm/Asiago and regular crumbs. I seasoned things according suggestions, our tastes and what I had on hand.
I noticed it getting a little too brown, too fast when I turned the pieces so I cut the temp to 425 and that worked. I think I'll start at 425 next time. I piled some extra crumb stuff on top when I  turned the pieces. It took less than 20 min. per side and was tender and juicy.
One caveat. If you're going to add Parmesan to your coating, watch your salt. You may not need more than 1/4-1/2 tsp.
Thanks so much for sharing - everyone at our 3 generation dinner table loved it!

I used less butter and half the amount of salt.  To the person that wanted to use bread crumbs or cornflakes and parm--that makes this an ENTIRELY different recipe.  RATE the recipe written--using less oil and less salt didn't alter the original recipe!

Yes Delicious.  Helpful Hint: Use cereal bags to shake chicken in.  They hold up nice and cheaper than plastic bags.

This is such an easy recipe and turned out nicely golden and crispy. I only used two tablespoons of butter for 4 chicken thighs for hubby and I. I really think you could skip the butter altogether. The chicken was surrounded by lots grease as well as the butter by the time cooking was complete. So skip the butter, you won't need it. I doubled up on the paprika for a little more color and used seasoning salt instead of regular. I also added both onion and garlic powders. So versatile - just add seasonings of your choice to taste. The lightly seasoned coating sure lets the flavor of the chicken shine through. Although I have bought some tasteless chicken in the past I got lucky this time with chicken loaded with natural flavor. I suggest if you know your chicken may be lacking in flavor in advance to amp up the seasoning a bit.

So yummy!! I used oregano in place of sage because I didn't have any. Only used 1/4 cup of butter and just added a touch of olive oil to pan. My picky 4 year old even loved it!! Will make again, thanks!!

I would rate this five stars, but we did makes some changes so I've got to be fair :-) We used all cornflake crumbs instead of flour and I omitted the butter (and greased the baking sheet instead). I didn't miss the butter at all. The chicken was phenomenal! We've already had this twice in the last week.

I don't understand all of the raves for this recipe. I found it to be bland and greasy even though I decreased the butter to 2 tablespoons and increased the seasoning. My family, even my daughter who is a raging carnivore and will eat almost any form of meat. This will become chicken salad.

This is excellent! My husband's grandma made this exact recipe minus the sage and it's his favorite chicken. She didn't write it down and I could never duplicate it but this recipe nails it! It's a no fail when I just can't decide what to do with that Thursday night chicken!

My daughter eats chicken when I cook it and enjoys it but she's not really a at home chicken person and tonight she said, "I'd even ask for you to make this again".  So I'd say it was a big hit!  I cut up 3 leg quarters. I used a little less flour than called for and added some corn starch, to make crispier.  I double the seasonings but did not use the paprika(didn't have)so I replaced with onion and garlic powder. Even though I only used half the butter called for, I could have cut back more.  The skin gave off enough itself. Will make again!*****made again and this time I had the paprika so I used it and didn't use the onion/garlic powder and used bone in breast and it was juicy and skin crispy. Even though I still doubled the seasonings the chicken didn't have as much flavor throughout.  Maybe the breast meat was just to big.  Next time I'll stick to dark meat and maybe still add the onion/garlic powder right on the chicken.

I only used a tablespoon of butter to spread around the casserole dish so the chicken wouldn't stick to it and it really turned out juicy & delicious! This is a recipe I'd use again.

Made these with the option to double the paprika and add season salt and they were a hit. I served them the first try to guests and they compared them to boneless KFC! Kids try and sneak bites while they are cooling. I used half olive oil half butter. This is a hit.

Doubled the recipe and used boneless skinless chicken thighs. I also added garlic powder as well. And instead of using melted butter I used butter flavored Pam and sprayed the pan and the chicken. Cooking time in total was 30 minutes. Was very good, I think it could've used a tiny bit more sage though.

I just made this tonight. It was so delicious!  I do not like baked chicken unless it's slathered with gravy.  I use half of the butter that the recipe call for.  Next time I will use only 2 or 3 tbsp. and maybe use cooking spray. The chicken was moist, tender and really tasted good.  I had it with asparagus and chicken-pasta!

I have been doing chicken like this for a very long time and when I turn the chicken over I place biscuits in the baking pan and they are done when the chicken is done and the biscuits have a very nice tasty bottom crust.

This is an easy, fast, and delicious meal for a weeknight. To lessen the fat content, omit the butter and dip the chicken (whatever cuts you choose) in salted buttermilk before shaking in the coating.  Adding a ratio of 1 part crushed melba toast to one part flour  gives a lot of extra missing cruch and taste to the finished product.

This is pretty good and ever so easy. Skin comes out crisp. Chicken stays moist. I served it with asparagas and a small baked potato. The total time with prep and cooking was 1 hour.

I made this recipe for supper last night. It was easy to make and tasted great.Since there is only two of us I used half the amount of flour spices and butter and two boneless skinless chicken breasts.

I used this recipe as the starting point and made some changes. I added onion and garlic powder, doubled the paprika and tossed in a bit of a speciality flavor called "Barbeque" to the mix. I had a bunch of chicken so I baked it three ways. 

1) on the broiler pan sprayed with Pam (no butter at all)
2) in a baking dish with about 1/2 the butter the recipe calls for
3) in a baking dish sprayed with Pam

All of it was good. The chicken on the broiler pan was the best, crispier and better flavor. That is how I will do this going forward. It was wonderful and how often does the lower fat version taste better?

Oh, before baking I marinated the chicken in a combination of italian salad dressing (fat free), red wine vinegar (just a little--I was almost out), and two cups of seasoned water.

Also added garlic salt, onion salt and Cayanne Pepper. For a healthier meal we used boneless, skinless chicken breast, used a little olive oil instead of butter. This was so good we will never go back to regular fried chicken in oil1

Tried this recipe last night with boneless skinless chicken breasts and it was a huge hit. I made it exactly as written and I'd only make one change next time and that would be to add about a tsp. of garlic but that's just because I use garlic in almost everything! Wonderful addition to my "comfort food" list. Thanks

Hubby prepared it using chicken breasts and it was a total disappointment. The chicken was extremely dry and not edible at all!! Better luck next time!

The chicken was good and my family loved it.  Be aware that it comes out quite salty.  To get the buttery taste but save a few calories, I melted about 2 tablespoons of butter in the casserole dish, then dotted the tops of the chicken with it.  We'll add this to the chicken repertoire.

I haven't tried this particular recipe, it sounds very good. I have done something similar with the paper bag. Used chicken with bones, the sharp tip of the wing bone ripped the bag and I shook flour all over myself and the kitchen.  Since then I use a plastic (tupperware) cannister with a tight lid. No more dust storms.

I used 4 boneless chicken breasts chopped across without skins. Didn't stray from the spice portion of the recipe. The only thing I did was pound chopped breasts to the approximate same thickness and then cook it about 5 minutes less per side, then wrapped it in foil to rest and finish cooking off heat. Sliced and served over a bed of rice in each bowl. EVERYONE came for a second helping! It is so easy and so so tasty - the butter really gave it a bit of southern fried chicken flavor, and a sprinkle of white pepper and salt right out of the oven put it right over the edge. We will be eating this once a week.

the recipe produces delicious chicken (which is more of a fried chicken).  I gave it four out of five stars because the flour mixture, though fine, needed a little more to give the dish a pinch more flavor.  Add what you like to make this dish your own.  I added chili powder, Lawry's salt, oregano, etc.  Onion and/or garlic powder would also be good additions.  Re the butter, there seemed to be quite a bit of butter so I suggest using half what is stated in the recipe.

I used boneless skinless chicken breasts to cut down on the fat and calories, and instead of using butter or margarine I used a few sprays of butter flavoured Pam. I also took the advice of other reviewers and doubled the seasoning and added garlic powder. Turned out fantastic! My fiance and I both loved it. Will definitely be a staple in my menu from now on. Tasted like fried chicken without the effort and expanded waistline!

This is my five year old son's favorite chicken recipe; the more butter added to the pan makes for an even juicier chicken. I use this recipe so often that I finally just made 10 times the amount needed. I keep it in a freezer bag and scoop out just what I need. Thank you for posting this!

Wow! This was so good.  I fixed 4 whole chicken legs and my husband ate three of them!  That says a lot all by itself.  He's not really picky, but I can tell if he really likes it by how much he eats.  Great recipe.  Thanks.  It was really easy to make, which is nice, too.

I read the ingrediants for this and thought it couldn't be that good but I was desperate to get something in the oven.  OMG, this chicken is amazing and everyone I know wants this recipe.  My family even requested I make it twice this past week.  You won't go wrong with this one and you can tweek it to your diet needs.  We used skinless, boneless chicken breast and I'm going to experiment with rice bran oil next.

Delicious! I did double the seasonings (not the flour) for personal preference. To make it lighter next time I'm going to try cutting back on the butter or subbing olive oil.

Very simple and quick! I agree with several other reviews - double the seasonings, leave flour the same. Added garlic powder, fresh chives, and sprinkled Parmesan cheese on top for the last five minutes. I also omitted the butter and didn't miss it. Mine came out slightly dry, but I think I left it in a bit too long, so it's probably my fault! Will make again - my son loved these "chicken nuggets."

I didnt have very good luck with this recipe.  Seemed too bland for my taste even after adding few other spices.  Didnt use full amt of butter and still seemed greasey.  Think i just left in oven too long with too hot of temp.  Even tho mine was a disaster i would be willing to try one more time after reading other reviews !

The family really liked it.  I didn't have sage so I substituted rosemary and it worked fine.  I coated the chicken, then melted a little butter  in a hot pan (maybe a tablespoon, not even close to a half cup) and browned the chicken, then I baked it for thirty minutes.  I didn't want to fry it in all that butter and it still tasted good.  It was a nice alternative to just dumping a bunch of marinade over chicken for a quick dinner.

Not bad. I put a little more sage in it and it tastes the same. I will make this ahead of time in baggies and it's just easy to shake the chicken or pork chops then cook them. I don't use butter at all, I don't find the need for it.

I could only give 4 stars because I had to substitute a couple of ingredients that I didn't have on-hand (I thought I did before I started; shame on me!)  But it was a GREAT consistency and very yummy.  My whole family liked it!  Thank you for this idea!

This was really good.  Although, I put in my own seasoning since I didn't have the parika or sage.  I used Montreal Steak Spice.  I also used whole wheat flour instead of all purpose flour.  Next time I am going to try and use olive oil instead of butter to try to make it a bit healthier.  Thanks for the good recipe.

Maybe I mismanaged something but I found coating from wettish to non-existent.  However, I used skinless breasts and that may have contributed to my disappointment.

Very tasty and easy to make. I cut the recipe in half and still have enough mix left over in the fridge for another dinner. I added a 1/4 tsp of garlic powder and a large pinch of parsley.

This was great and EASY!  I reduced the butter to half of what the recipe called for and cut the chicken into bite sized pieces (for kids).  I added some garlic salt and a bit of red pepper, as well as doubled the other spices as suggested by others.  Will make again!

This chicken is so delicious I can't wait to make it again.  So much better and healthier then store bought shake n bake (shake n bake is made with hydrogenated oil). I mixed a bunch of spices in the flour, I used garlic & onion powder, pepper, peprika, salt, and chili powder.  I removed the skin from the chicken and baked it with out any butter just sprayed the baking dish with Pam.

I added a few more spices (garlic powder, thyme). I used 1-1/2 pounds of boneless, skinless chicken breasts (cut into kid-friendly sized pieces). I baked for 10 minutes, flipped, baked another 10 minutes, flipped, baked for 5 minutes and then did a quick broil to make sure they were crispy. All 3 small boys liked it and my husband told me it definitely was a keeper and to make again. Next time, I might try it with skin-on chicken because the pictures look amazing. Thanks for this simple recipe!

Excellent flavor with the addition of garlic powder & onion powder. Next time I'll try just butter spray & a cast iron skillet in the oven, because I ended up with soggier crust than I like. Still tasty!

When my family is happy - I'm happy, and they sure love this recipe.  I added 2tsp. season salt and 1tsp. each of garlic powder and onion powder, as suggested by reviews.  Now the kids get happy when they smell it cooking!

I made this as the recipe stated with the addition of maybe 1/2 teaspoon of cajun seasoning. Still found it a little bland. Good base recipe though.

I give it 4 stars for what it is, but really the chicken (though juicy) wasn't very flavorful.  Maybe I was wanting something more along the lines of crispy breaded chicken.

This was tasty and my husband really liked it. I added red chili pepper since he likes spicy food. One word of advice: dry the chicken a little bit before putting it in the bag, or you'll end up with a slimy dough that covers only part of the chicken...like I did.  I used boneless breast tenderloins and they were overcooked, so I will shorten the cooking time a bit next time. I'm sure it's not too long for bone-in chicken though.

My family loves this!  We have it once a week.  I only use 1/2 a stick of butter and it still tastes great.  I also remove the skin before coating it and I add one tsp. of Grill Mates Montreal Chicken seasoning.  My husband and I think this chicken tastes really close to KFC but much healthier.  My 3 picky kids love it!  This dish is quick and easy.  Serve with a salad and risotto (Archer Farms) from Target and you have a complete meal. Yum!

This was pretty darn good. I would have rated it 5 stars but I did have to add some things. I also added garlic and onion powder and doubled all other spices except for the salt. My family said that I definitely should make this again. Thanks!

I have four VERY picky eaters, but everyone loved this!  I used drumsticks and boneless skinless thighs.  Did not use the butter, but rather sprayed cooking spray on my pan and then on the chicken before turning.

I followed other members' hints and baked leg quarters in a pan with cooking spray, added some powdered onion, garlic and parmesan. The result was great! The skin was cricpy thin, the flavor was satisfying, the meat was juicy. Now I'll have to try it with skinless chicken.

This is basically the same recipe mix as the fried chicken with gravy also on the site.  But this is less mess, sorry not less fat (look at the butter).  I like them both- both are easy.  I don't even really tweak.

I added extra seasonings as I knew I would want more flavor in the coating. I should have removed the skin on my pieces, but didn't think of it. The chicken came out super moist :)

Great, SO easy, and tasty! I used skinless chicken breasts and it turned out great. I also added some other spices to the flour mix- cayenne, onion & garlic powder. Next time I'll try adding some parmesan to the mix!

It came out really well and I didn't even have to adjust the cooking time. I tried seasoning the chicken before putting it in the flour mix, but I think next time I'll season it even more because the amount I used with the pepper, paprika and sage really wasn't enough to give it flavor.

Everyone in my family loved this, even my picky young children.  This was tastier than store-bought "Shake & Bake," & fast & easy to prepare.  I had no sage, so I left it out, & it was still delicious.  Be careful w/ the baking time, though.  You have to watch the chicken carefully & not go by the 40-minute suggestion.  After turning the chicken over after the initial baking time of 20 minutes, my chicken only needed 5-10 more minutes of cooking or it would have been overdone.

I used to boneless, skinless chicken breast, omitted the butter, added some cayenne pepper and it turned out swell. Will make again with different herbs added.

First, I didn't use the butter, I really didn't want all that fat. I made the mixture (eyeballed ingredients, no sage, but used poultry seasoning) and put in plastic bag. Baked on wire rack on cookie sheet for about 50 minutes, skin nice and crispy despite no butter!! Very good and very moist, but created lots of smoke!!! Grease splatters too from the chicken, not sure I'll use it again due to this reason, but the chicken was great!!!

We really enjoyed this recipe!.  Instead of sage I used Montreal Poultry Spice.  I like baking chicken in a hot 450 oven, the result is always a crispy skin and tender, juicy inside. Smelled really good while baking too!  Thx.

This is an easy way to shake up some tender chicken. I make it with a healthy twist though. I substitute olive oil for the butter and "Just Almond Meal" (from Trader Joe's) for the flour. I also dip the chicken in a little egg whites which helps the almond meal stick better.

So quick & good!  I had only boneless breasts which have little to no fat, so I dried them with paper towels & covered them with mayonnaise before shaking them in the bag.  Cooked for just 20 minutes total & they were yummy & moist.

Yeah... we've had our problems with this recipe; I guess you get it right, or you don't.  The first time around, we got the outside crispy (with half the amount of butter suggested) but the chicken had no taste to it.  The second time, I marinated my chicken first, so it had a LOT of flavor, but it didn't fry up right.  :(  I might have to give up on this one, but maybe I'll try it one more time...

I would have given this 5 stars since I changed it, just a bit, did not feel that I could give it 5 stars. Great recipe, I did not use the butter, used Pam instead, sprayed chicken as well as pan.  I also doubled the spices and used Cajun seasoning, ground cumin, white pepper, fresh garlic, sea salt & ground pepper. This came out tender, crispy and full of flavor.  All family members raved about this chicken and could not believe that it was baked in lieu of fried.

I was a little skeptical about tryign this simply because really the only time you put flour on chicken is when frying.  Well as i thought it did not come out that great.  I folloed the directions exactly except I used wings and thighs. I ended up cooking the chicken twice as long as recommended because the thighs were still relatively gummy.  In a ddition to that I was still able to taste the flour.  It was edible to say the least but I would not try this again (;-(

I agree with the reviews that it is a little bland as it is. Add a tsp. each of garlic powder and onion powder and a dash more seasoning salt and you have something close to Shake and Bake for a fraction of the cost. I also like the idea of marinating the meat in italian dressing first.

Very easy and tasty too.  To make it slightly more 'healthy friendly' I substituted vegetable oil for the butter and used a salt substitute.  Oven heat and timing worked perfectly with baked french fries.

One of the easiest and tastiest ways I have fixed chicken.  I used chunks of chicken breast, as others mentioned, and only 1/2 of the butter.  I also was out of sage for some reason, but used about a tsp of basil, little thyme, and more black pepper.  It was really tasty and moist.  A few reviewers complained about the fat & calories from the butter, but it isn't like you eat all of the pan drippings, so a lot of those calories are left in the pan.  5 stars for sure.

Very good recipe when spices are increased like other reviewers recommended. I plan on reducing amount of butter next time though. Used chicken breast pieces cut in "tender" size and cut bake time in half. Whole family loved it.

My family really liked this chicken. I used boneless skinless chicken breasts and unseasoned bread crumbs instead of flour. I cut the cooking time to 30 minutes total which was good for the thicker breasts. The thinner ones were a little dry - 25 min would work better for them.

Very quick and easy! Just right for mom's and dad's with hectic lives. I am cooking it now and I just turned over the chicken and it appeared to be a little......soggy.....maybe I turned it too early? Other than that it seem's like it will come out good!

Whenever I make this people say "How'd you make this It's good"  Which it is.  I call it oven fried chicken.  I'm always asked for the recipe.

This tasted good, but nothing to wow over.   I'm only giving this 3 stars because it's just like fried chicken, only with a thinner batter.  I don't think it was anything at all like shake n bake myself.  Bread crumbs would've made this more like shake n bake chicken.

Like anyone, I "tweek" the recipes to fit what I have available.  I liked this one for it's simplicity.  The only things I added to the flour were a cup of nacho cheese "Goldfish" that I put through the food processor and a little garlic powder.  It gave the chicken a nice "spicy" taste without being over the top. Thanks, Candy, for the head start on a great recipe.

This recipe ROCKS.  I can't believe how simple, fast, and tasty it is!  I used boneless breasts (on hand) and cut them in half.  I also used olive oil, as my husband can't have dairy.  Because of it's ease and delicious flavor, this is going to become a weekly meal for us.  Thank you Candy!

I also used skinless, boneless chicken breasts.  I didn't have sage, so I used oregano instead.  It was still very good and easy.  I think I will cut down the butter next time though.

Made this last night and it's a keeper! Not sure if you need 1/2 c butter..but then I was using chicken thighs with the skin on. I think I'll use 1/4 butter (or maybe none)if using chicken with the skin on.  Only thing I'll change is play with the spices - I personally think some garlic powder, onion powder and a smidge of red pepper would kick it up nicely.

I read other's reviews and made some adjustments. I used boneless and skinless chicken breasts and added onion and garlic powders, cayenne pepper and reduced the oil to 2T butter and 2T oil. I also pounded the chicken breasts and cut the baking time to 20 minutes, turning the breasts at the 10 minute mark. It was very good and will be making it again.

I followed most of the recipe   I added equal amount of plain panko, instead of sage I use poultry seasoning, and I sprinkle the raw chicken lightly with Natures Seasoning   I’ve made this 4 times and most of the time it came out perfect. One thing to beware of, which ruined one batch is be very careful when you melt your butter to not let it get brownish. Even slightly over doing on the butter gives the chicken a bad flavor  we had to pull all the skin off on one batch because the butter got too brown  
Other than that, this recipe is a hit in my home, and it’s nowhere the clean up you would have if you pan fried your chicken

As is, this is a very easy recipe. My chicken came out moist and the whole family ate it.  I will definitely make this again.  

But next time I will find a way to use less (or no) butter. I will also increase the spices in the flour mixture.

I doubled the spices (kept the flour the same) and added 1 tsp. garlic. I used 6 tbs of butter, instead of 8, and it was plenty. Could use less of that.

The first time I made this I thought it needed a little extra seasoning.  For my 2nd attempt... I added salt/pepper to the chicken before putting it into flour mix. I also added garlic powder, onion powder and a little extra salt to flour mixture. It was fantastic! Cooking it this was with such high heat makes the chicken skin crispy and renders almost all of the fat out without drying the chicken. I felt like I was eating fried chicken...only it wasn't greasy. So good!

Excellent. This came out so good. My husband and I just loved it.  However, we are only two so the 3 lbs of chicken pieces is too much for us. We had to reheat it the next day and it lost it's crispiness.  Does anyone have to know to reheat the chicken so it stays crispy? Because I will definitely make it again without changing a thing.

We loved it, but I tried to cut servings to 3 and I used too much butter, so it didn't get very crispy.  I will make it again (less butter) because it was delicious.

Fantastic recipe.  I used 4 skin on chicken thighs.  My only deviation from the recipe was marinating the chicken in buttermilk for 1/2 hour.

DELISH! Next best thing to frying in Granny’s cast iron skillet! And ohhh so easy. Did I say how yummy the gravy from the buttery drippings was? Line your metal baking pan with foil and make the gravy right in that. Easy clean up.

Delicious! I normally don’t exactly follow savory recipes, instead using them as suggestions, but did on this one (only subbing King Arthur’s Gluten-free Flour). The family couldn’t stop raving! I was desperate for a new dinner and this with some roasted butternut squash was perfection. We will absolutely be doing this again

I took chicken tenders and made this into chicken nuggets. Baked them 25 minutes turning once. This was some of the most tender and moist chicken I have ever eaten. My family felt they could have used more seasoning so I may double the seasoning next time. I also used 1/2tsp  garlic salt, 1/2 tsp salt instead of just salt. Would definitely make again.

I added some coconut oil to the butter.  I'm also gluten-free so I just used gluten-free pancake flour.  It is sooooo good!!!

Excellent, easy and quick. Added sweet potatoes and asparagus for a complete meal. Might add cayenne pepper for a bit more kick.

Excellent shake and bake!  I soaked the chicken in buttermilk for 30 minutes before following the recipe. I also added 3tbsp garlic powder to the flour mixture. Killer chicken!

No changes. But did double the amount for 6 chicken breast. Had to put 1 piece in its own dish cause they wouldn't all fit. Temperature seems high and butter was starting to burn. Second side was only 15 minutes. Came out cooked and juicy. I would like to spice it up a bit more. I removed from dish butter and covered with foil and let stand about 10 minutes. It's not fried chicken and nothing like boxed Shake and Bake, however, it was easy to make and came out very well. The "EASY" part is the key. I will make this again. Use more seasoning like adding thyme or rosemary and some cayenne. And the use of butter wasn't too bad, but maybe grease with Crisco instead.

I removed the skin from my chicken first for a healthier approach. My thighs were larger than normal (lol) so I cooked mine 20 on one side and 25 on the other.  The outside was a little crispier than I preferred so 22 minutes on each side would be perfect for a well cooked, moist, and not too firm piece of chicken. Didn't have sage so I opted for the readily available oregano, used a Tsp of garlic powder,  and badda bing, YUMMEE! :D

I've made this a few times. It is ok as written, but does need more seasoning. I salt and pepper the chicken before shaking and that helps. However, after several tries, I changed this up and would give the improved version 5 stars. 1. Salt and pepper chicken to taste; 2. Shake in the bag as directed; 3. Dredge in an egg bath and then; 4.  coat in Panko bread crumbs. Cook as directed above. You get a crispy chicken that rivals fried without the mess and hassle of frying. Love some of the other suggestions to add parmesan cheese. Will try that next time.

This was excellent and my whole family enjoyed it.  I did a couple of things that was suggested by other reviewers.  1.  I used chicken breast which I cut into strips.  This cut the cooking time in half.  So 10 min one side.  Flip, 10 min other side.  2.  I doubled the spices and kept the flour the same.  3.  I used a smaller amount of butter.  Personally, I think the butter lends a tremendous flavor to it.  4. My family does not like very spicy food so I added a very small amount of Cayenne pepper for flavor.  Served with mashed potatoes and pass and carrots.  Yummy!

Made it twice.  First time I made per instructions, it turn out very well.  Would have preferred the skin a little crispier.  Second time I made it, I added both bread crumbs and a dash of poultry  seasoning.  This time it was much crispier.

This was really easy and good. I substituted rabbit for the chicken. it was good, but at the given temperature and time was overcooked. I'll adjust the temperature down next time. the leftover drippings and butter were great on mashed potatoes.

Made a big batch so we can eat throughout the week, she said it tastes like KFC! I had 6lbs of chicken legs/thighs and wanted an easy shake an bake recipe. This is more like a fried chicken/KFC recipe, much better than shake n bake. I would make it as is, but did add some garlic/onion powder, still tasted awesome. I left out the butter, thighs already have lots of fat oil in them. Used nonstick spray on a roasting pain, placed the coated chicken pieces close together which stops chicken fat oil from splattering out of the pan and burning, also gets absorbed into the flour and pan fries the chicken. Delicious. I think this would work with chicken breasts with bone/skin/fat in on it, but if you use boneless/skinless, might need the butter to add fat to pan fry.  This is so much faster and easier than the normal fried chicken recipes where you coat by hand and dip in a big pot of oil. Next time I might try brining the chicken for extra moistness!

This was a pretty delicious recipe. I did changed it up a bit though. Instead of flour, I used plain bread crumbs by progresso.  Everything else stayed the same. I also used far less butter because my portion size was less and I used chicken tenderloins, so that much butter was not needed. You could probably get away with using spray butter in Pirex dish and it will still taste fantastic. I found that a lot of butter made it less crispy and a little on the soggy side. So just keep that in mind when making this recipe. Otherwise, tastes way better than shake and bake by Kraft. Thanks for sharing!

This was easy and excellent! Two of my favorite words! Doubled all of the spices and added generous amounts of garlic and onion powder. Used two large chicken breasts (1.5lbs total). Cooked at 450 for 10 minutes, flipped, and cooked for another 15 minutes in an 8x8 metal baking dish with half as much butter as called for. Used a meat thermometer to ensure thorough cooking. Very tender, juicy, and flavorful! The "skin" was nice and brown. This will be added to my weekly dinner rotation!

Great EASY-PEASY recipe!  I used skin-on drumsticks, omitted the oil in the pan and the regular salt (but added lower-sodium fakish-salt cause I'm livin' the lowered-sodium life, sadly), then more or less (ok, I eyeball'd) added a couple shakes of garlic and onion powders, a dash of cayenne and "italian herbs" to the suggested sage and black pepper, baked forever, and BAM:  REALLY good chicken!  I can't wait to try other variations of this!  

(I also used homemade breadcrumbs and "crushed rice cereal" when making the coating ...but next time, and I will SO be making this again!, I'll most likely use half homemade breadcrumbs and half panko.)

If made as written, it is good.  But, the next time I made it I changed it up a bit.  Seasoned the chicken lightly with season salt and pepper before putting the flour mixture on.  That really helps to give the chicken itself some extra flavor.   I have used purchased seasoned flour, and I have made my own seasoned flour with season salt, garlic powder, onion powder, celery salt, paprika, pepper and regular salt.  It is important to realize that you have to use more seasoning in the flour mixture than you think you need.  Without enough seasoning, the breading will be bland.  If you don't season the chicken a little before breading it, the chicken is a little bland.  This recipe is an excellent starter recipe that can be changed easily according to your taste.

My family isn't fond of sage and I used lemon pepper in it's place. The  kids love it and it's become a go to recipe weeknights. It's quick simple and versatile. I've used it for chicken wings, drumsticks and pork chops. I highly recommend giving it a try!

this was ok.  I only used 1/2 stick butter. the chicken wasn't very flavorful and wasn't as crispy as I thought it would be.  quick and easy, will make again with my own tweaks.

This was so easy an delicious! Very helpful! I was actually out of flour so I took 1/3 bag of triscuits and hammered them into crumbs! I also used boneless chicken tenders and it also cut the time in half and only used Pam for a nonstick on the pan(no butter-and didn't miss it)! My hubby said it reminded him of growing up!- mission accomplished! Lol thanks again for sharing

Added lots more spices but still bland.  Used flour, corn meal, bread crumbs mixture but still came out limp.  Not crispy at all.  
The thighs cooked exactly as called for were moist. Used a cast iron skillet.  Won't use this recipe again.  Will go back to my own.

This is a moderately good recipe. You can easily replace the butter with a rub on the bottom of the tray and 4-5 on each piece. You can rub lemon juice on pieces before putting in bag. A little tarragon also adds good flavor.

I tried this recipe for the first time. I think it was ok, but I would have preferred if the seasoning of the chicken was done overnight, it would have given it a more flavor. But overall it was ok.....

This was the BEST 'fried' chicken I think I've ever had! With nice tasty and crispy skin. I used approx. a couple of tbsp. of Lighthouse freeze dried Poultry herb mix that I ground down with my fingers, a tsp. worth of fresh ground salt, fresh ground white pepper, and a little ground sage and marjoram leaves into the flour. I had a package of organic chicken thighs, and used approx. (I don't measure)3 tbsp. of Kerrygold Irish butter. I cooked it 15 min. for the first half of cooking, but it only required 9 minutes after turning. Then deglazed the pan with a mix of Simply Organic roasted chicken gravy mix with the required amount of water, that picked up the all the yummy flavors from the pan. This was so easy to make, quick cooking, and just so so SO good!

Good little recipes.  But, I have learned that I can replace many FLOUR ingredients in recipes and replace with CORN STARCH to make this recipe (and many others) gluten-free.  Similar texture, great taste, equally as easy.

This recipe is excellent!  Very quick and easy. I used chicken wings.....but now that I know how good it is, I will make it with a whole chicken next time. I did add some extra spices of my own which included garlic and Sazon  Azafran ( Spanish seasoning). Which helped with the color. The chicken was crispy and flavorful. I hated to tweek the recipe but without it.....it wasn't as flavorful. Great recipe nonetheless.

This recipe we have used for 2 generation now.  Instead of the butter, I use skinless breasts and after shaking the chicken in the bag, I spray it lightly with butter spray to reduce calories and fat.

Made this last night. Changed the recipe a bit with ingredients I had on hand. Made with boneless, skinless chicken breasts. Eyeballed the flour and spices for two pieces of chicken instead of 6 servings. The spices were very good. Made a light breading on chicken. Used olive oil and canola with a small bit of butter for the frying. Chicken came out really well.....moist and delicious.  The paprika added a wonderful taste and color to the dish. Husband really liked it. I will make this again, but may change up the spices for a different flavor.

Made this tonight. Had a good Crisp.  Thought using a halfcup of butter would be too much and I didn't have any so I used 4 pats of margarine.  Very juicy. Family enjoyed.

Absolutely delicious. It was my first time making shake and bake chicken and I will definitely be making it again. I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts. My husband raved about it the entire time he was eating. I also served with mashed potatoes, brown gravy and spinach. The hubby said I have to make it more often!

Fantastic! I used fresh boneless skinless breasts.  They were pretty big so I cut them in halves. They were done perfectly in exactly 1/2 the time (20 minutes total). I used 1/2 olive oil 1/2 butter and brown rice flour (to be gluten free).  Other GF flours would work as well, however they did not have a thick, crunchy crust, but were still delicious! And so easy! Be sure to drizzle that good juice over the chicken when serving. UPDATE: Tried this with white cornmeal instead of rice flour and it was crispier and better. I'm guessing yellow cornmeal would work too.

I made it exactly as written and my son and husband loved it.  My son asked when I was going to make it again.  I did have to blot it with a paper towel though before I served it.  I think the best part was when I had a flashback to my parent's kitchen and helping my mom shake the chicken in the bag.  This is a keeper.

This was the same recipe my mom used when I was a child.  She did add onion powder though.  

When my sisters and I make it we use only 2 Tablespoons butter or EVOO.  We also use garlic and onion powder.  A pinch of cayenne is great too.

I've now made this recipe two weeks in a row for Sunday dinner; it's so good!  It looks and tastes like real fried chicken; the skin is crispy and the chicken is juicy.  I followed the recipe as written, except I also seasoned the chicken prior to putting it into the seasoned flour.

Ok....I have NO idea what I did wrong but this did not come out crispy at ALL.  I used boneless chicken breasts but other review said they did too and they were still crispy...some even said crispy like KFC!  So what happened?  I followed it exactly (added garlic powder and onion powder too but that shouldn't matter) but only used a 1/4 cup butter instead of 1/2 since I only made 2 breasts but that should make it even crispy not soggier.....it was a nice flavor, don't get me wrong but I was expecting nice, crispy chicken and it was just a juicy, flavorful chicken breasts with some spices on it.  What am I missing? Maybe I didn't cook it long enough?  I only did 15 minutes per side since they were boneless and I didn't want them to dry out.  The edges were crispy so maybe that's it?  I want to be able to "fix" what I did wrong and make it again.  Help! I can never find my comment when I try to look for it later so if anyone knows what I did wrong feel free to email me at kcorona10@yahoo.com.  Thanks!  :)

I made this exactly as written and it was very good.  I think that next time I make this I will add a little more salt.  Perhaps some garlic and onion salt might be good.  Thanks for the great and easy recipe!

This is a super simple way to make a good chicken dinner. I changed it up a little, but nothing that changed the overall dish. I did not use all of the butter, and next time I will probably use less.  I also added some italian breadcrumbs and some additional seasoning.

The chicken comes out very juicy and flavorful. However, the breading doesn't crisp up as if it were deep fried, but still a keeper!

WOW!!  I made this using chicken thighs and drumsticks, 4 tbsp. margarine (to keep the cholesterol down), added a 1/2 tsp of poultry seasoning and substituted garlic salt for regular. My husband RAVED over it!  This has got to be the best baked "fried" chicken I have ever had!

This receipe is still going strong on this site. I tried it tonight and it was fabulous. I made a change though. Instead of sage I used Adobo. I also took baker potatoes, sliced them lengthwise into 6 pieces each and put them into the butter as well. Wonderful meal. Thanks Candy for posting this very easy yet very delicious 
recipe.

Tried this last night and the chicken turned out tasty and juicy. I think the butter quantity called for is definitely on the generous side though. I'll be cutting it by at least half next time and I'd like to try a little bit of garlic powder in with the chicken as well. I used chicken legs to make it but I'll try back attached legs/thighs next time too.

Edit: I have made this dish many times now, usually with thighs) and it has quickly become a favourite in our home. I do not use any butter now as it is wholly unnecessary and essentially ends up frying the chicken instead of baking it. I use parchment paper to ease cleanup and prevent the skin from sticking. The skin turns out perfectly browned and crisped, every time.

I marinated the chicken in Italian salad dressing. Very tasty dish but flour coating gets soggy. Still a keeper. This time May 18, 2016, I marinated the chicken in Italian salad dressing, then dipped it in a bowl of bread crumbs mixed w/ spices & Panko. Baked 450 for 30 min. The boneless breasts were done. Bone in pieces 15 more minutes. It came out great.

My family loved this! I used skinless, boneless breasts, cut each in half and pounded until they were about the same thickness. This is important so the thin ones don't dry out! I gave it 5 stars because all 5 people in my family at it, but I used "I can't believe it's not butter" instead of real butter which I will not do again! I thought it had a funny taste but was still good. There was also much more butter than necessary. You can play with the seasonings however you like. I added garlic salt and no sage, and threw in a few things here and there. The high heat makes this dish work, and I think it could have used a little less time given that the breasts were think. Go for it...this one is yummy.

I's rate this chicken higher, but i can't get that cruchy outside it's supposed to. Probably my fault. I cook it whats a "dutch" oven and follow recipe exactly but no brown exterior. Even use "real" sticks of butter for coating. Could it be the size of the dutch oven? What can I try, please?

Very good! I added garlic powder and left out the sage, used 1/2 stick of butter. Used boneless skinless chicken breasts, pounded to even thickness. Cooked at 425F for 10min each side then broiled for 5 min to brown. Very juicy and flavorful! Kids loved it!

I was surprised by how good this is! I am not used to cooking with sage, but it added a nice flavor. I let the chicken sit in the flour mixture for about 15 to 20 minutes while the meat is coming up to temperature for cooking.

This recipe just looked to simple. I gave it a try and my family loved it! They asked me to keep this chicken recipe because they really like it. I didnt have the sage but did add about 1/4 tsp poultry seasoning. It was awesome though I will definately get that sage stocked up again. Thank you Candy, this is truly a keeper.

4.5 stars.  Less than 5 because it wasn't quite as crisp as the old shake and bake . Based on others' suggestions, I used more spices: paprika, chicken seasoning, salt, pepper, garlic and onion powder. I might have thrown in cayenne pepper, but I didn't have any. I'm not sure it was all necessary anyway. I also added 1/4 cup finely crumbed corn flakes to the flour mixture. Not to change the recipe, but to use up some stale cereal. It was quick, painless and the boys loved it.  My DH does not like boneless chicken breasts at all, if it's not fried chicken on the bone, he doesn't want it, and said so...repeatedly.  After eating it, he said it was wonderful, and almost like fried!  By the time I made mashed potatoes and a box of stuffing it was ready. EASY weeknight meal. I would have liked a little more crunch, but I might have used too much butter or the fact that I used parchment paper (I was out of foil and didn't want to scrub the pan) or the addition of corn flakes could have altered the outcome. Either way, this WILL be made again and that is a HUGE deal from my boneless breast hating man :)

I used non-stick spray on my pan and cooked it on the stove because it's just my preference, instead of butter or oil.  And, unfortunately I didn't check my ingredients so I had to switch some.  Rosemary for the sage, and cayanne for the paprika.  

My pieces of chicken were really big so it took a bit longer to cook and a few spots burned, next time I should've thought to cut them into smaller pieces (as the recipe says too)  

The chicken was really moist on the inside, a bit of a bite, but good.  Next time though, I'll actually follow the recipe using the paprika and sage as it calls for.   It was really simple, really easy and good.

I made this last night and it turned out alright. Its really easy to make. I would suggest doubling the spices and adding garlic and onion powder.

This was delicious.  My son-in-law said it was "really good".  I did add garlic and onion powder and only used half the butter.  Next time I will try using oliver oil and no butter.

Not a "shake and bake" chicken... I think bread-crumbs instead of flour would make it look much better.

This has become one of my family's dinner staples. Super easy, super tasty... what else can you ask for? I used organic buttermilk pancake mix (i didn't have flour in the house!) and it turned out fabulous! The other ingredient I didn't have is the sage, but I don't miss it at all. Great recipe, and whole family (picky husband and 5-yr old) LOVE it!

This was the first time I made fried baked chicken and I was surprised at how crisp it was. I did add a few more spices (1/4 tsp of each), onion powder, garlic powder, red pepper flakes and bbq seasoning. It was very flavorful.

I used boneless, skinless chicken breast and only cooked for 30 minutes.  I also added some garlic and onion powder.  Best chicken I've ever had.

This chicken has a really good flavor and is my boyfriend's favorite chicken recipe that I cook for him. I sometimes add a couple more spices, mostly just whatever I feel like at that time and it always comes out spectacular.

This was yummy! We used skinless, boneless chicken breasts and I didn't measure anything, I just added salt, pepper, sage, paprika, onion powder & garlic powder to taste. Ran out of butter so I just used margarine (didn't measure that either). It was great! The kids loved it and it was a nice variation from the regular fried chicken on the stovetop. Will make again and again. :-)

Fabulous chicken that has become a staple in our home. I use chicken tenderloins, double the recipe and add garlic and onion powders. I bake it in a 9x13 dish for 12 minutes on each side. They come out perfect and taste delicious with buttermilk ranch dressing/dip. Great for Superbowl weekend!

Delicious after adding in the additional seasonings everyone suggested. Onion and Garlic powder along with some seasoning salt. Mine turned out a bit soggy on the bottom after turning, but that was probably because some were not completely thawed before I baked.

This was some good chicken.  I used chicken seasoning which has the salt, pepper, paprika in it already.  I added 1/4 tsp garlic powder.  My 5 yr old could not stop eating eat.  She wanted more and more, so did I.  This is a good 'oven-fried' chicken recipe.  I opted for leg-quarters and I took off the skin on half.  Even skinless it was tasty.  Thank you Candy!

This chicken was awesome! I did make a few changes though. I doubled the seasonings except the flour and replaced the sage with poultry seasoning. I also added 1/2 tsp onion powder and 1/2 tsp garlic powder. I also cut the butter in half. Turned out just like fried chicken and not greasy.

Very good and so easy too. I added other spices because of other reviews and I have to agree I think it is needed. Onion powder and garlic powder with a shake or two of cayenne.

This was a great recipe.  I took off the skin.  I only used 2T. butter and about 2T olive oil.  I baked at 450 for 10 minutes, then at 350 for about 40 min.  The chicken was tender and juicy.  I did turn the chicken about halfway though.

This is so much easier than frying on the stove and way less mess too!  I left out the sage and salt and used chili powder and curry instead.  It was really good.

This was the best chicken I have eaten in a long time. The only change I made was added a little more margarine. My husband and son loved this chicken said it was better than fried chicken. It is a keeper for sure.

This a really good recipe! Chicken came out absolutely perfect. The only change I made was adding garlic and onion powder. Will be a regular!

used olive oil to coat cast iron skillet, then heat in oven before adding chicken. Double the salt and paprika. Add 1 tsp. garlic pd. and 1 tsp. onion pd. 40 min. was a little too long.

I was concerned about heating the butter higher than it's smoke point so I cooked my wings with this recipe at 350 sans the sage because I didn't have any.  Turned out great.  I sacrificed some of the crispness but made it a lot more healthy!

I made this recipe to the T...this chicken was yummy...My husband and sister loved it.  I would add a little more sage and probably add onion salt and garlic salt but it was excellent and very moist.

Very Bland tasting if you don't season the chicken or Shake & Bake prior to cooking. I washed, patted dry, & seasoned my chicken to taste (lemon pepper & other herbs) and allowed to sit in the fridge for a few hours. I also further seasoned the coating before I applied it. I also chose to use half the butter the recipe called for and added 1 Tbsp of grapeseed oil (can use veg or canola if you like)It cuts the calories way down & still tastes great. ***If you are making this recipe with bone-in breasts only, you may want to reduce the cooking time by about 10 minutes.

We make this recipe all the time.  I add potatoes cut into large pieces to cook with the chicken.  Works with tough cuts of steak also, with the oven temp lower around 400.

I have made this recipie twice.  The first time I followed the recipie with a few additions like adobo and sazon.  My man is Latino so I like to incorporate some of his seasonings.  left out the butter completely and just sprayed pan and meat with PAM.  It was excellent.  This week I made it again but just put in some of this and some of that for seasonings.  It was FABULOUS!!!!  I used the butter this time and they compared it to KFC.  It is always so juicy and crispy.  This is a keeper and my man's favorite chicken now.  THANK YOU!!!!!

This was the slamminest baked chicken ever!  My husband has been asking for this kind of baked chicken for the last 3 years and each time I try something new, it misses the mark.  This is a for sure keeper.  Followed the advice of the other reviewers and added additional spices.  Also added some breadcrumbs and it was fantastic.

We love this chicken!  So easy, inexpensive, and delicious.  We now make this often.  I've found that the coating recipe (as is) coats about 4-5 drumsticks.

This was a really good quick and easy chicken recipe.  I cut the recipe in half and cooked the second half of it at 450 for 15 min and then turned the oven off and left it inthe oven because we had to go to church.  Two hours later the chicken was a little dry but it was delicious.  Next time I'll make sure I'm here for the entire cooking time and this will definetely go into my recipe box.

OMG!! This is such a good recipe, it was exactly what I was looking for. There is no longer a need to deep fry chicken! Way less mess this way too. I didn't have paprika or sage so I used 1tsp of montreal chicken seasoning and I put in 1/2 tsp of pepper and used less chicken since there is only me and my husband eating. It was so crunchy and good, I will be making this many more times!!
Thanks

Great recipe for baked chicken. I actually did not use the butter either. Just spritzed a little cooking spray after it was coated and on the glass pan.... chicken came out perfect. Full of flavor and very juicy!

This was really good chicken.  My husband told me he really liked it and he isn't a big fan of chicken.  I think I may cut back on the butter a bit next time.  Seemed to be quite a bit of it.

My family loved this chicken!  Because of other reviewers suggestions, I added the garlic powder, onion powder, and some Parmesan to the flour mixture with other ingredients.   This was a great Sunday dinner - will be making again!  THANKS!

I followed this recipe except for using only 1/4 cup of butter as suggested by other reviewers. It was very good.

Kind of blah to me and borderline dry. I did like how quick and easy it was but I doubt I will make again.

It is so much healthier and cheaper to make your own shake and bake.  This recipe is so easy to modify to your tastes.  I did not use any butter at all. This makes it cheaper and easier on the thighs later. I kicked up the combination and amount of spices because the amounts were not enough for good flavor.  What a great idea to make your own Shake and Bake Chicken.  Thanks for sharing.

This was easy, tasty, and very easy.  What more can you ask for?  I added garlic powder and onion powder to the flour.

I do not think this tasted like shake and bake per say.  My husband liked it a lot but the rest of the family found it too spicey.

I love this recipe, and more importantly so does my husband!!! I leave out the butter though and only use chicken breast for a healthier meal. I'm always experimenting with seasonings in this recipe, there are so many possibilities with it!!!

This is, without a word of a lie, the BEST homemade chicken I have ever had.  It comes out moist, juicy and with a crispy coating.  It tastes like what I want out of fried chicken, but with much less work and much less mess!

I made a few small changes -- I only used 1/4 cup of melted butter and I used poultry seasoning instead of sage.  I also turned the oven down to 425 after about 30 minutes because it seemed to be browning very quickly.  The chicken was in the oven for about 50 minutes and came out perfect.  I will never buy Shake and Bake from the store again!  Thanks for a great recipe!

This was good, but needed more spice to suit my taste. I'm not a big fan of sage so I added a bit of garlic & onion powder instead. I did use half the amount of butter than this one calls for, and found that to be more than enough. I used this on some chicken tenders, but will try it again using leg or thigh portions instead which I think would work out better and maybe tweak the spices a bit more.

This is a easy, fast and tasty recipe.  My boys love it!  Chicken usually is finished after 15 min a side.  I only use 2 to 3 tbs of butter and that is plenty! Thanks for a quick weeknight meal recipe!

Not much flavor. Easier to buy Shake and Bake in the store, it has more flavor too. It did turn out very moist.

Sadly I was not fond of this recipe.  It makes way too much and really can't be saved.  Tried cutting it in half and didn't care for the flavor or texture.
sorry

I used this on boneless, skinless chicken breasts as someone suggested. The chicken came out a little dry, so next time I would probably try it with bone-in chicken  pieces. I decreased the amount of butter by half.

I followed another reviewer's advice and used skinless boneless chicken breasts because that was all I had. It came out very good. Next time I think I might use less butter, I think 1/2 cup was too much. I will try this again with drumsticks to see how that comes out as well!
Very easy versatile recipe.
