I followed this recipe until cooking. I baked them at 450 for 10-15 minutes. Still came out crunch and fry like. All my family loved them!!!! Baking it is a good alternative for a healthier meal.

I used pork chops cut into strips and then added salt, pepper, and a little garlic powder to the flour mixture.  My family loved this dish!

I made this dish up for my granddaughters (13 and 7) who practically inhaled them!  I used half a garlic and herb tenderloin that I had left from the Indonesian Pork Noodle Bowl, and because I didn't have quite enough Panko left, I smashed some Rice Krispies for the coating.  We used Honey Mustard II from this site and Semigourmet's version of ranch dressing.  I will have to get more of this delicious pork tenderloin again for a repeat!  I didn't even have time to take a photo!  Thanks, #Smithfield, for a wonderful recipe!

These were good, and the family enjoyed them, but not as much as I had hoped.  The flavor is good, and I baked some and fried some to see which method was better.  Frying makes them crispier, but is more labor intensive.  I'll probably use the breading recipe again with chops or thicker strips of meat.

Like chicken fingers.  Kids loved it.  Not too difficult but takes a long time to fry them if you make a lot.  I'll try baking them next time.

My family loved, loved, loved these pork fries. I used a plain pork loin and marinated it in a garlic - peppercorn marinade for twenty minutes squeezing off the excess before placing in the flour. Make sure you have on hand plenty of panko bread crumbs on hand; they get sticky when transferring the pork from the egg dip. Overall, a WINNER.

I'm still new at cooking food for others so when I started out I messed up the first few fries haha but once I had the oil temp right the fries turned out great! Add a few types of BBQ sauce and/or other sauces and you can turn it into a dipping party.
