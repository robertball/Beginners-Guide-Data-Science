This salad is wonderful and a great summer salad while cantaloupe are in full swing. I have made this twice this week. First time I made just like recipe stated except I did not use fresh mint. We loved it. I did mix all together and added the dressing right before serving. The second time I made it for a girls night out and tripled the recipe! IT was a big hit and is diffently a keeper. Everyone is amazed at the mint/apple jelly. It gives it a very nice and different taste.Try it and you'll enjoy.

This was a huge hit at our Fourth of July party.  First of all, it is beautiful with the colors and the layered look so it makes an impression before anyone even tastes it.  Then the apple/mint jelly takes 'em by surprise and the raving continues.  I couldn't find apple mint jelly, so I bought both apple and mint and used 2TBSP of apple and 1TBSP of mint.  I mixed the chopped mint in with the dressing too, and applied the dressing just before serving.

I also struggled with the avocado at first, not able to get pretty slices.  Finally, I sliced it in half long ways, and removed the pit.  Then I turned each half open side down, and sliced it like you would a pepperoni.  Then the skin peeled off each slice surprisingly easily.

Salad was very good but not the best.  The dressing was voted by my guest to need some salt and pepper.

Elegant and different.  Omitted the mint leaves and used Polaner mint jelly.  I could not find any apple mint jelly.

I prepared the salad ingredients with a balsalmic vinaigrette.  The combination of ingredients along with the mint was delicious.

I prepared this salad exactly according to the recipe, except I doubled the ingredients. It fed 8 adults one side-dish serving each. I like that the salad is so unique and such a beautiful presentation, but I found the dressing just too weird, even though I'm a very adventurous eater. I made three recipes from this site for a barbeque today and got raves on the other two; not a peep about this one. I might try it again with a dressing of my own choosing.

Wow - even my 16 year old brother had seconds and he is a picky eater. I was in such a hurry I forgot the red peppers and it was still amazing! Can't wait to make it the right way!! I followed the reviews and chopped the melon and avocado, but i did have to heat the vinegar and jelly and mint sauce (I found this amazing sauce while shopping for apple mint jelly - it has malt vinegar, white vinegar, sugar and egyptian mint leaves, so i used that and added an extra bit of white wine vinegar); i simmered the full dressing recipe on the stovetop for about 20 minutes on low heat to break down the jelly and bring out the garlic...It was so aromatic and the flavors were amazing. What a fantastic, easy and elegant salad!!

A comment regarding "apple mint jelly."  ALL mint jelly that I have ever made or read about is made with apple juice as its base, therefore "apple mint jelly!"

Made this salad with ingredients on hand, which did not include the vinegar, jelly, or peppers.  Still tasted great, though!

Perfect! The only change I made was to chunk my avocado and cantaloupe instead of slicing it. I thought the dressing might need seasoning, but I was wrong. Perfect as is. Thanks!!!

This is really delicious. I needed something to use up some of my mint that was taking over the herb box on my window sill and this was just the ticket! You can't have mint without lamb, so just add some nice juicy lamb chops and bread and you've got an awesome gourmet meal!

I came across this recipe when looking for a different way to use up some cantaloupe. Unfortunately I did not have the avocado or spinach, but I did have baby cukes and fresh garden lettuce. I also just chunked everything rather than slice. The fresh mint and cantaloupe is a beautiful pairing, and the dressing was a subtle flavor binder, although I found the garlic distracting. I would leave it out next time. Overall, a refreshing and different salad.

We did not care for the dressing, but other than that this salad is perfect.  We eat it constantly during the summer.  It needs no dressing at all.

I loved the idea of a spinach and cantaloupe salad, but adding red bell peppers and avacado didn't sound very appetizing to me. Instead I made my salad with spinach, cantaloupe, and cucumber. I used the recipe for the dressing with some modifications. I took out the garlic and added 1 tsp lemon juice, 1 tsp sugar, an extra tablespoon of apple mint jelly, and dried mint leaves. As I prepared it, this salad was tasty, refreshing, and loved by my family. I will be making this again!

Wow!  I would have never thought to put this combination of flavors together, but it worked so well.  I made it exactly as written and we loved it.  I served shrimp skewers on the side and my husband said he would have liked the shrimp on the salad.  I'm not much of a shrimp person, so I was quite happy eating it as it was.  I'll definitely make this again!

This was a very good salad.  I love the minty flavor.  I did make my own mint jelly, because all of the ones in the store were either made with corn syrup or high fructose corn syrup.  Not something I wanted in my salad.  I mixed the mint jelly with apple butter for this recipe.

OUTSTANDING! Out of all the dishes I prepared for Australia Day, everyone said this was the best - and I didn't even use avocado. Mine weren't quite ripe enough and I only had green bell pepper, and used mint sauce in the dressing. Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly and my kids were fighting over the last pieces of spinach! I have never seen that before. lol. The dressing is the PERFECT compliment to this amazing dish. I plan on making it again tomorrow night as it was that good. Even hubby was nodding with approval and murmuring 'great salad'. I used fresh mint from my potted garden - best salad I have eaten in a while. Thank you for this recipe!!!

I made this recipe in August and it got rave reviews from friends. I tend to be just slightly squeamish when it comes to dressings that are heavy on oil, so I substituted water for some of the oil the second time I made it (as the jelly thickens the mixture anyway), and I much preferred this lighter alternative.

Made it twice. The first time I needed a recipe for a mint party. I doubled the recipe and diced all of the ingredients except for the spinach. I used a Decker melon and it came out great.  Everybody loved it.  I made the dressing per the recipe the first time.  It seemed a bit heavy on the oil so the second time I used half olive oil and half Mediterranean blend oil and it seemed just right.  Also took the leftover salad the next day and added some sliced leftover NY Strip steak and a handful of walnuts. Made a great meal.

this recipe easy to do and get ready in advance.  I the cantalope for mandarin oranges and the garlic for grated ginger.  Had wonderful bursting flavor.

Fantastic salad.  I added very little vegetable oil, which made the dressing slightly more "minty", but still delicious!

Love it!!  The minty dressing is so delicious and the garlic offsets the mint just perfectly.  Definitely chop the mint leaves - if you leave the pieces too big they're too chewy.   Very different kind of summery salad - thanks!

Since I couldn't find apple mint jelly.  I substituted it with    2 T apple and 1 T mint as suggested by another reviewer.  It may need a little tweaking of the two to get the right taste.  I loved the presentation of the romaine/lettuce, cantaloupe, red pepper, chopped mint, and avocado.  I would definitely make this salad again.

I wanted to use fresh mint but didn't have a particular recipe in mind. This is the one that I went with. I found mint jelly with apple juice as an ingredient, and prepped this as set out, with one exception. I added salt and pepper to the dressing. It was so fresh and interesting and different. I will definitely make it again.

Made it without jelly & I used red pepper vinaigrette & olive oil. It was awesome! :)
