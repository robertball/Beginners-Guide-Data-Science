I liked the flavor of this recipe. I did use cilantro instead of the epazote because I've never used it, wasn't sure of the flavor, and didn't want to take a chance on my family not liking it after all the work that goes into this lol. I followed the rest of it to a 't'. I do think it tastes even better the next day (I just mixed everything together in a tupperware instead of saving each layer seperately and it was yummy). I do not however agree with all here that this recipe is worth all the work. I have made some elaborate recipes which are worth all the work, but I am sorry to say, for us this is not one of them. I think it could be done with many shortcuts and have the same flavor. Will tinker with it and find an easier way to make it. But overall flavor deserves 4 stars!

This was very good, however I scaled down the number as well as the quantity of ingredients and made some major modifications in order to make this a little less time consuming to prepare.  Instead of chicken, I used fully-cooked chicken sausage w/spinach and asiago cheese.  Since the sausage had spinach in it I omitted this from the ingredient list.  I used chicken broth instead of water, and I used diced tomatoes instead of whole.  I did not puree the tomatoes in a food processor.  I used tortilla chips instead of corn tortillas, and I also added a dollop of sour cream to the finished dish.  I served this to 4 picky teens and they all had seconds!

This soup is absolutely delicious.  It takes some work and time, but it makes a huge pot and will last several days.

I made half of the recipie.  It was absolutely wonderful, especially since we were able to use fresh zuchini, peppers, tomatoes, oregeno and basil from our garden.    You could leave the chicken out and substitute beans if you wanted to make this an all vegetarian dish, and perhaps use a bit of vegetable stock intead.   I give it an A+.

I tried this recipe leaving out the last two steps, and it's last ingredients (i.e. potatoes, spinach, avacado, cheese, tortilla). I was able to store the soup for a while without those ingredients. The longer the veggies and chicken sat in the broth, the better it tasted!! The whole family loved it.

This recipe was wonderful!  I too made this for several picky teenagers at their New Years Eve party.  They all had seconds.  What a hearty combination of ingredients.  My family has asked that it become a regular meal.  I agree that this is very worth the effort.  The only ingredient we added was our individual choices of hot sauce as we all love a bit of spice.  Thank you for sharing this.

this time-consuming recipe is worth all the trouble. The twenty people who tried it loved it. the quantity is large so you can freeze some for later.

Yum! Yum! Yum! Totally worth busting your butt making. I loved this and there was plenty for me to freeze. It was three meals. The overall taste improves with freezing but I love squash with a little pop when you bite them, so the first meal of it is special too. Great recipe.

I was missing chopped tomatoes, onions, epazote (which i now have to find out what that is), all of the vegetables, but I had potatoes!! But I spiced the heck outta them with salt basil and garlic salt. Put on the cheese, and mmmmmm. I am excited to make this right the next time, especially as the winter is around the bend!

This recipe is a great hearty, HEALTHY, comfort food!  WE all enjoyed it very much!  The reason you need to take the veggies out of the water and put them into each serving bowl is so that they don't get mushy, losing their taste, texture, and nutrients. 

The only thing that needs to change is the order in which you follow the steps.  Cook the chicken first so that you can work on everything else while its cooking. Also, if you have a third burner, parboil (or microwave) the potatoes. This way will save a lot of time!

LOve this soup.. I did reduce the steps though. I did follow the first step on the stovetop, but then I tossed everything into the crockpot.. except for the toppings potatoes and zucchini. I cooked for about 3 1/2 hours, shredded the chicken up, put it back in, added the zucchini and cooked for another 30-45 minutes - not sure of time. I browned the potatoes on the stovetop and then assembled everyrthing. I tasted it the day I made it and it was ok,.. the next day it was terrific. This improves a lot over night. I did add more salt as the tomato paste makes for a sweeter soup..Couldn't find epazote.. used cilantro
