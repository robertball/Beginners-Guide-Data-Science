This is a very good recipe you can tweak. I have made it quite a few times. Unless you LOVE Velveeta, I would highly recommend using half cheddar cheese (otherwise your soup will taste more like Velveeta cheese dip). I always use 1 pound of velveeta and 1/2 - 3/4 pounds of cheddar and I always end up with restaurant quality soup. Also, remember to constantly stir the milk mixture "until it thickens" and you will have a nice and smooth, thickened soup. I do not use white pepper but put in a dash of regular pepper. Substituting a good portion of the velveeta with cheddar makes a great tasting, quality soup. My family loves it - even my three kids. I rate this 5 stars with the addition of cheddar. If I rated this using all Velveeta then the rating would have been 1 star.

Ok, this is REALLY good, I'm eating it as I type.  A few things...1) it makes A LOT.  If you don't want enough for 10 people, half the recipe.  2) When you add the onion/flour/milk mixture to the broccoli, it looks TOTALLY unappetizing!  Just keep plugging along ;).  3) You will think that you're adding an ungodly amount of cheese, but the recipe can handle it.  It's not overly cheesy.  

Excellent!

This is very yummy.  I read all the broccoli cheese soup recipes on this website and decided this is the one i would try. It was a great choice.  Made it just as written but added one clove minced garlic with my onions.  I will be making this again but will cut it in half since it made way more than what my family would consider a serving size. More like 10-12.

This is a WONDERFUL soup. I made a few changes: I used fresh broccili and boiled it in the chicken broth for 30 minutes, I used one large can (48oz) of chicken broth, I only used 1 lb of Velvetta. My husband thinks of this more as a broccili bisque, and my two toddlers LOVED it. It makes a lot, several full meals worth but it is so simple and SO VERY good....

Such a great recipe!  I have also substituted two cans of cheddar cheese soup for the Velveeta in a pinch...it worked great!  We keep making this one.

Guests for dinner tonight and there were lots of compliments for this soup around the dinner table!   I did make some changes that I believe were improvements - butter rather than margarine for its superior flavor, fresh broccoli rather than frozen (cooked easily and lickety-split in the microwave) a clove of garlic and a mix of 2/3 Velveeta and 1/3 Cheddar.  I  cooked the broccoli in advance and set it aside.  Sweated the onion in butter, added the garlic, then the broth and milk. Once it thickened just a little I lowered the heat and slowly stirred in the cheeses, then gently stirred in the broccoli.  Excellent soup - creamy, rich and satisfying. Since we're leaving town again, our guests were only too happy to have the leftovers.

This was wonderful!  I did add a couple cloves of minced garlic and pureed some of the broccoli and put it back in the soup.  My whole family loved this recipe!!!  Definitely a keeper!

Very good starter recipe.  Some very good suggestions:  I only used 1/2 a white onion, but added 2 cloves garlic.  I also used real cheddar, and a bit of pepperjack cheese, to give it a little pep.  A lot of people don't like using real cheese because they think it is grainy, but if you cook it properly, it is just as smooth, and tastes better.

When making the rue (after sauteing the onions and garlic), slowly whisk in the flour, to make a smooth rue.  Them temper it (aka, slowly add a LITTLE bit of milk at a time) until incorporated.  Then cook over a very ow heat for about 15-20 minutes until thick.  After you add the milk mixture to the broccoli, take it off the heat and slowly add you cheese, never letting it boil.  Super smooth, creamy, and REAL.

This soup was wonderful, I cut it in 1/3 and it was perfect for 2. I also added garlic and crushed red pepper to give it a little kick. I'll definately make it again, thanks!!

This is an excellent recipe if you remember to follow the recipe exactly.  It does work out very well if you do that.  I was looking for a recipe to use what I had on hand and this was it.  It is a quick, good tasting, easy to make recipe.

I would suggest this recipe to many of my friends and I have.

Marvelous... however, processed foods make me nervous... so, I used 75% cheddar and 25% mozzarella.  Marvelous!  Even my broccoli hating husband and 3 year old gobbled it up.  Try it; you will love it with all natural ingredients!

Delicious!  I didn't have enough broccoli, only one 16oz bag, could have used another, but we still ate every drop.  Added some minced garlic and extra pepper - I put crushed red pepper on top of mine for some extra zip.  Thanks for a great recipe.

Used fresh broccoli and less broth and 1 lb of cheddar cheese, no velveeta. The trick is to add the cheese to the milk mixture after it is thick and melt it there. Then it will not get stringy like if you try to melt it directly in the soup. Very good and definitely a keeper. My 1 1/2 yr old who hates broccoli ate it up and complimented it highly. MMMMM!!!

Made with a homemade chicken broth and  fresh broccoli. Skipped the flour step by using instant potato flakes. Really good!

We have family cooking night at my mom's house every Tuesday night.  Last week, we decided to give this soup a shot, and it turned out great.  It wasn't as thick as we expected it to be when it was done, but it tasted wonderful.  If you let the soup sit for a while, it does end up thickening up though.  This recipe is definately a keeper!  I used the largest Velveeta cheese block that I could find, and added all of it, which happens to be more than what is called for in the recipe itself.  I also used one whole bunch of broccoli (stems chopped up too).  I boiled the broccoli first, and then added the other ingrediants to the pot.  Thanks!

1/17/10 - this is the second time that I'm making this soup, and the only thing I changed was to add another 1/2 lb cheese to the mixture...it is so yummy!

Very good!  I only did one thing different and that is I used half and half instead of milk.  To go with it I made rosemary ham & swiss cheese toasted sandwiches.  Our deli sells a really good ham that has rosemary in it.  This was a quick and easy soup to make on a chilly, rainy evening.

4 stars as written, because it was a bit bland to me and the order of putting this soup together is silly. I can't think of a good reason to transfer your roux mixture from one dish to another; do it the other way around so you don't lose any of the baked-on flavor at the bottom of the pot. Also, I can't see any reason to add the cheese last. I did it the recipe's way and found myself stirring and stirring trying to figure out if my cheese had melted all the way yet. Do it the other way--put the cheese in the roux before adding the broccoli--and you'll be able to tell precisely when all the cheese has melted. I do think these kinds of soups taste better when cheddar is also used but I used only Velveeta this time, however I did use less than the recipe called for as I also had somewhat less broccoli. Broccoli is the flavor counterpoint for the cheese product in this soup and if you reduce (or increase) the broccoli you'll want to adjust the Velveeta accordingly. Thanks for the recipe :)

Amazing! I haven't even added the cheese yet and I can't stop dipping my spoon into this soup! The only changes I made were adding some julienned carrots and used fresh broccoli. I also pureed it. I will be adding the cheese before serving but I can't even imagine how much better it will be then! Thanks for sharing!

Two stars with just the recipe. 3.5 stars with my adjustments. The finished product was sort of bland. So i added 8oz cheddar cheese, 2 dashes liquid smoke, 1 dash tabasco, 1 tsp oregano and basil, salt and pepper to taste. That helped some but i don't think that this will be my permanent recipe. Will try to find another one with more complex flavors.

THANK YOU for this recipe! My sis and I are broccoli cheese soup finatics and this recipe is amazing. I cut the recipe in half but wish I would've made more! For the most part I followed the recipe and glad I did now. I didn't add the white pepper because I'm not a huge fan of it. I just used a little salt and pepper. I agree, restaurant quality but more fresh and sooo easy. So quick. Looked as gorgeous as the picture too. Can't rave enough how delicious this was. I will make this many more times to come. Thank you so much!

I have made this soup 3 times. I have made it with only 1 lb of velveeta, but every time it has turned out great. When using fresh broccoli, boil the vegetable a little longer until it is tender. Do not chop or puree the broccoli because doing so will cause the soup to become runny. (If you want a runny soup  I would recommend buying it from a can)  This has become my official recipe when making a broccoli soup and it is really easy to make! Thanks

This is very good Soup and is quick and easy to make. I did not have enough of all ingredients on hand to make the full amount so I reduced everything by 1/3.  I used half cheddar cheese and half velveeta cheese.  I was 1oz shy of having enough chicken broth so I added 1oz of beef broth and 2 chicken bouillon cubes.  I also completely forgot to add the pepper. Even in the midst of all the self made chaos this still turned out great.  Here is the recipe reduced by 1/3 -2 10oz bags frozen broccoli, 2 14.5oz cans chicken broth, 4 Tbsp butter, 1 small onion chopped, 3oz flour, 1 1/3 c milk, 1 lb cheese (8oz cheddar & 8 oz velveeta), dash of white pepper- *update* I made this again using only velveeta and it was not as good.  I recommend using half velveeta and half cheddar.

I added finely chopped carrot, celery and garlic with the onion and the end result was awesome! This recipe will be used time and time again.

I didn't put onions in it, but followed the recipe otherwise.  Pretty good!  Although, make sure you use brocolli florets only...I bought "cut brocolli" and it had too many stems in it.

Have made this numerous times.  The original yield is ALOT of soup, so didn't make that mistake twice... usually size the recipe down for 1 can of chicken broth and that's enough for 3 healthy sized servings.  Perfect for a rainy day recipe if you can't make it to your BBQ pit without getting your ribeyes too watery.

Wonderful soup.  Next time I'll reduce the amount of cheese though as I'm not a true-blue velveta lover.  I also julienned  some carrots and threw them in.  I love making it with the roux instead of the cornstartch.  Much better then the rest of the similar recipes I've tried on this site. (It's fantastic the next day, too.)

This soup was delicious and very simple to make.  I made it exactly as the recipe states and it turned out wonderful.  This does make a HUGE pot of soup so be ready for leftovers!

I took some others advice and halved the recipe and it was still plenty! I also used about half velveeta and half sharp cheddar. It was a really good soup. I will be making this again!

I LOVED this recipe! With a few tweaks, as always.. I used fresh broccoli, and let it simmer about a half hour. I added about a tsp of minced garlic to the onion mixture, and instead of using all broth, I used 1 can of cream of broccoli. And used about 1/4 velveeta and 3/4 cheddar. And took out about 3/4 of the milk.. I wanted it to be thicker. I thought this was better than the ones I get at bakeries and restaurants!!

I did use half velveeta and half shredded cheddar the second time I made this and liked it much better....and I love Velveeta cheese.
Update: I use the 1lb. of 2% Velveeta and then the other 1/2lb. of grated cheddar cheese. Comes out perfect.

Very good.  My only changes were due to what was available to me.  I used 2 16 oz bags of broccoli and 2 boxes (32 oz each) broth.  I did use pretty heavy salt and pepper and threw in a couple chopped carrots for color (and to use them up).  We enjoyed it.  I might try throwing in some leftover ham next time to make it a bit heartier.  I bet that would be tasty.  :)

I made this when I couldn't find my usual broccoli cheese soup recipe in my book of recipes.  The taste is excellent and like what I can get at a restaurant.  My wife has requested that I make this recipe again as she likes it better than the recipe I usually use.    Since I didn't have frozen broccoli, I used a large head of fresh broccoli cut into pieces (and some of the middle and upper stem sliced thin and cut into pieces too).  Butter was also used instead of margarine (I don't buy margarine and always have butter in the house).  I used 1/2 of a large onion and guesstimated on the amount of velveeta cheese (on a 32 oz. block I used what I figured was close to 1 1/2 pounds).  Instead of white pepper, regular black pepper was used along with a touch of sea salt.   I'll definitely make this again.  It is wonderful served with a fresh baguette (sliced).   Also I'm wondering how the recipe will do with less velveeta and some butterkase cheese, gouda cheese, or colby jack added.

My daughter and I pay $4 per small bowl of this soup at Panera. If you have ever had their broccoli and cheese soup and you've wanted to make it at home, this is definitely it. I used chopped broccoli and my daughter asked me not to put so much in next time so I might cut down on that. I loved it the way it was. This is soup-erb,

I made this tonight for dinner & my hubby said I need to become a chef... This was SO Yummm-Ooh... I did tweak it a little. I didn't have chicken broth, so I just added 5 cups of water & 5 chicken bouillon cubes to 40 oz (instead of 30 oz) of broccoli. In the onion mixture, Instead of 2 cups milk, I added 1 cup heavy cream & 1 cup milk, for an extra creamy texture. I also put a whole 2 pound block of Velveeta... It was SO Delicious!!!

It was really good.  The recipe should specify that you have to cook it and stir it for awhile at the end to get it to thicken up.

This soup was really good and easy to make. I only made some minor changes because of what I had available. I used chicken bullion to make my own broth and used real cheese instead of the processed cheese.

I used vegetarian vegetable stock instead of chicken broth because I wanted my vegetarian guests to be able to partake.  I just wanted to let others know that the recipe is still good with this change.  I will make this often, and I will try it with the chicken broth next time.

This soup was FANTASTIC! As BroncosFan suggested, I used 1 pound of Velveeta and about 2 cups of (freshly grated) cheddar- I also used two-16oz bags of broccoli rather than 3-10oz bags- These were the only changes I made and the recipe was incredible.  This soup is comparable to one my husband and I love from a local restaurant! I will definitely be making this again!

I loved this recipe... I altered the recipe, I added 1(12oz) can evaporated milk, 1 2lb block of Velveeta and 1 1lb block of american ( on the velveeta shelf).. let it simmer and thicken... then I added 1 cup of 1% milk.... THE best.. if you are on a diet or are worried about  clogged arteries, then DO NOT Eat....

This recipe was so quick and easy! I made it on a snowy day and it was so warm and filling. I did have to mix flour and water as a thickener and add about a cup of that to the finished soup to make it thicker (I like it better that way). It worked, so if you like thicker soup, try that!

This soup is not even ORANGE! It's white, which does not look like yor traditional broccoli-n-cheese soup! I am highly dissatisfied! It's very watery, and it seems to be too much broccoli for the soup. I think the ingredients are 'off'!

Great recipe!  I did change a few things, like adding some mixed veggies along with the broccoli, using skim milk, whole wheat flour and using lower fat cheese.  Next time I would use real cheese, becuse it did kind of taste like velveeta.  I loved the ease of this soup, Thank you!

THIS RECIPE IS AWESOME!!!  I saute mushrooms in butter and add them to the soup.  I have also added cooked chicken pieces.  To serve, I dish up the soup in oven-proof bowls and sprinkle shredded cheddar cheese and sliced green onions on top.  I place the bowls on a cookie sheet and put under broiler in oven for a few minutes to melt cheese.  Everybody in my family loves it!!!

This was awesome - added more brocolli, was a lil thick at the end so I added a little more milk but everyone right down to my picky 1 1/2 yr old twins ate it - I made the Italian bread bowls that are also on this site and filled the bowls w/this soul - I cant say enough about how good they were together! Thanks for another super recipe!

This was delicious!  I changed it just a bit for preference....I substituted Velveeta with regular cheddar cheese, used butter instead of margarine, and halved the recipe.  It was a huge hit with my family and tasted exactly like the soup you would get in a restaurant!

I knew I would be freezing part of this soup, so I went about this a little differently.  I never add milk or cheese before freezing so here’s what I did.  I simmered the broccoli in only two cans of chicken broth.  Once I added the flour to the sautéed onions, I added the third can of broth, instead of the milk, and then added that back to the broccoli mixture.  At this point I stopped and packaged this for the freezer.  Once thawed, I began re-heating and added the milk.  I also cut way back on the Velveeta and just added about two ounces to two servings.  This was good and using frozen chopped broccoli really saved a lot of time.  I did think it needed some salt, but that’s an easy fix.  UPDATE 12/9/13 - We had this again last night and I am changing my star rating from 4 stars to 5.  The second time around (last night) was much better than the first.  I'd advise making this at least a day in advance!

Wow this makes A LOT of soup. Do use your large stock pot. My husband made this and it turned out so delicious we couldn't stop taking "just one more bite" even though we were past full. The leftovers all got eaten today and still got raves. He only used half of a Texas sweet onion, unsalted butter and 2% milk. I added a hefty pinch of kosher salt to the onion gravy right before adding it to the broccoli soup. Delicious and easy. A new favorite here!

Who knew broccoli cheese soup could was this easy to make? I love this recipe! Despite what others say I didn't think it was too velveeta-y. It's so creamy and cheesy...just perfect. I used fresh broccoli instead of frozen and made this in one pot. After sautéing the onion and mixing in the flour I added the liquid and broccoli to the same pot and let it all simmer together. This recipe does make a lot but leftovers heat up well and you can make all of your coworkers jealous by eating your homemade soup in front of them! Enjoy!

This was great.  As is, this was 5 stars.  Like other reviewers I used half velveeta and half cheddar.  I also added a slice of habanero cheese and it gave it a little kick.

This soup is AWESOME!! Tastes like Panera's broccoli cheese soup. I used fresh broccoli, including the broccoli stalks. Just slice the stalks in half and slice thin, simmer an extra 5 mins to make sure it's tender. I served the soup with crusty bread and Stawberry and Feta Salad from this site. So warm and filling.

Wow! This was easy and very tasty.  I changed the serving size to 4.  Served four huge bowls and refrigerated another 3 cups for tomorrow.  I used half Velveeta and half shredded cheddar. Also used skim mild and the soup was still  thick and cheesy.

This was excellent!!! So quick and easy to make! I used broccoli florets, 1/2 & 1/2 in place of milk, added shredded sharp cheddar cheese and bacon bits and just used black pepper. My family LOVED this...said it was just as good if not better than any restaurant!

Got rave reviews and was super easy to make.  I cut the recipe in half at the suggestion of previous reviews and it was the perfect amount for a couple nights worth of dinner for 2.  I will use fewer onions next time, though.

Really great tasting soup.  I gave 4 stars to this recipe because of the frozen broccoli.  Fresh broccoli is so much tastier.  I used about 3 large crowns and I also used vegetable broth instead of chicken broth because I prefer it.  Great consistency.

Not being a huge fan of processed cheese this was not mine or my husbands favorite but my kids loved it.  I will be trying a recipe with real cheddar next time just due to the personal feelings I have about the junk in velveeta.

as follows: I had no flour, so I substituted 1/4 c. cornstarch. I also used fresh broccoli (about 3 heads) and 8 oz. cheddar instead of Velveeta. I also used 1/2 c. half & half in place of part of the milk. (I used 2%). This was without question the best broccoli cheese soup I ever had. Thank you for this recipe!

Great recipe.  I love that it doesn't use cream, yet is exceptionally creamy.  I made this for some friends that just had a baby and the reported that they fought over the leftovers.  I would suggest using fresh broccoli instead of frozen.

Oh my this really is a very good, easy and  versatile recipe. I followed alot of the posted advice and grated a carrot in with the broccoli and added a quart jar of home canned potatoes. I also used a pound of velveeta and a bit less than a half pound of sharp cheddar. I used this amount of cheese while I used 1 1/2 times the other ingredients. Just now realized I forgot to 1 1/2 times the cheese and so glad I didn't it was perfect. I also added some fresh basil and sage. We ate this with pumpernickel bread cause we love it. My husband, three kids and a neighbor kid all cleaned it right up. I do want to add that if you didn't already know, the butter and flour mixture is a FANTASTIC base and you can make most any cream soup with it. Use it and master it-it makes a great clam chowder. Fantasatic!

This soup is quick, easy and totally FANTASTIC!  Served it with some boule bread for dunking.  While the recipes says it serves 6, it made a LOT of soup.  It tastes just like the soup that well-known "bread place" makes!  Cannot say enough about how wonderful this soup is.  I did as others and used only 1 lb of Velveeta and threw in 1/2 pound of sharp cheddar, along with just a PINCH of cayenne and a quick dash of garlic powder.  Wonderful, wonderful soup for a cold winter day!   Will DEFINITELY be making this again!

This was easy to make and very good! I made a mistake early on because I didn't take the time to read through the recipe all the way. I didn't have cans of chicken broth so I just boiled fresh broccoli and added some chicken stock powder type stuff to the water. I didn't measure how much water I used because I thought I would just be draining the broccoli anyway (I was wrong).   Then later it got to the point where I was supposed to add the broccoli mixture to the other mixture and I had already drained my broccoli. OOPS! That's what you get for not paying close attention and not reading ahead!!!   So I just ended up making some more "stock" again and it worked out just fine. I didn't have enough velveeta and literally just ended up throwing in every type of shredded cheese I had in my fridge. The end result was delicious and I will make it again for sure! Thanks!

This recipe came out in the Dec/Jan 2019 AR Magazine, page 104. The recipe has been scaled down to 2 servings and uses a 1 pot approach (which I really like), sautéing 1/3 cup onions in butter first, then adding 2 T.  flour to make a paste, then adding the broth and milk til thickened, then adding the broccoli, and finally the Velveeta and pepper.  I only had a 16 oz bag of broccoli florets and used that with no ill effects. I used the immersion blender at the end, leaving just a few chunks of broccoli.   11-30-2019 Delicious!  Used only 1/2 onion instead of whole and glad I did.  Will definitely make again.  Better than any I've had at any restaurant.

This soup is DELISH! I cut it down by about 1/3 since I'm only cooking for two. I did make only a few minor changes: I didn't have chicken broth so I used mostly beef broth and then added some water and chicken boullion; I added some minced garlic to the onions; and added about 1 cup of 2% cheddar. Also, I used the lowfat (2% milk) velveeta and skim milk and it was still very thick and creamy! My boyfriend went back for seconds and plans on having it for dinner as well :)

Here is the skinny.  I have made this twice now.  The first time, exactly as written.  The velveeta was a bit overwhelming but I could tell that a variation would yeild the perfect soup.  That being said, the second time I made it I used fresh broccoli and seperated the very tips of the broccoli and the stalks and only boiled the stalks.  When they were tender, I put them in the blender and pureed.  I than returned it to the pot and added the tips of the broccoli so they cooked but stayed just a little crisp.  The rest of the directions were followed but 1 pound of velveeta was used and 8 ounces sharp cheddar.  It was really great.  The only other thing that I will change to make it PERFECT next time will be use 8 ounces of velveeta and 1 pound cheddar.    Really fantastic though.  p.s. this makes 8 one cup servings or 6 one and a half cup servings.

I roasted fresh broccoli in the oven, then added it to the warmed chicken broth. I also used all freshly grated monterey jack cheese, and added garlic powder and celery salt.  I also added about a tablespoon of mascarpone cheese (since it was about to expire) at the end.  This was SO good!  Can't wait to make again.  Thanks so much for sharing this recipe.

I started out leary about this recipe but it turned out wonderful, and I have picky eaters. I used the advice of some of the reviews. I kicked it up a little. I used 1lb velveeta and 8oz shredded chedder/pepper jack cheese with jalapenos. Also, I used 7 bouillon cubes to 5 cups water and added some minced garlic to the onions. Warning it does make enough for an army! Great for leftovers on a gloomy day!

I used velveeta & 8 oz. of mild cheddar cheese... All I can say is this is the BEST! I call it 'gas station' soup, because it tastes just like the broccoli/cheese soup you get at many SA's etc.. Thanks sooo much for a great recipe

This came out wonderfully thick and creamy. As others I added a freshly minced garlic clove to the mix. Next time I'll use a little less cheese but that's just because of personal taste.

Quick, easy, yummy.  The only reason I don't consider it a 5 star is the large amount of velveeta (not a fan).  I had no velveeta on hand at all so I used all mild cheddar, shredded finely to mix & melt easily.  I will add a touch of garlic next time and I liked the idea another reviewer mentioned, cauliflower.  The recipe as written does, indeed, make alot!  I scaled it back to 4 servings and still had more than enough to put in the freezer for another quick meal (which is a good thing, quick cook-ahead meal).  All in all, very pleasing (with the change of cheese, for us).

I cut this recipe to 1/3 and it still turned out excellent. I did like other said and used half velveeta and half shredded cheddar. The only thing I think I will do differently next time is thicken it up with some potatoes...yum!

This soup is delicious! I give this a 4 simply because I heeded all the advice of the trusty reviewers which made for a great soup. I used fresh broccoli and cauliflower, 1/2 of a block of light Velveeta (which was plenty), a can of lowfat cheese soup and added garlic. The soup has a smooth creamy texture and is rich and full flavored. It was a hit- next time I will add an extra cup of milk as the Velveeta still dominates the flavor a bit much.

Very good soup with a slight modification.  Per several other reviewers' suggestions, I used half Velveeta and half shredded sharp cheddar cheese and used black pepper because I don't have white pepper on hand.  I also added about 1/2 tsp of salt at the end after tasting the soup.  DELICIOUS!  My 9-year-old daughter went back for seconds and the 12-year-old would have done so if she hadn't had such a huge first helping!  I served it with home made French bread ("French Bread Rolls to Die For" recipe from this site made into a loaf instead of rolls).  Thanks for a great recipe!

Really Yummy!!  I used fresh broccoli (peeled and diced the stalk and kept the florets small).  I also added a can of cream of chicken soup after the milk.  It was creammy and thick and cheesy!  It will be a staple in our house!

Yummy! I loved this recipe, it is super easy to make. I actually sent the recipe to my mom because she had a hard time finding a simple recipe.  I added paprika and some crushed red pepper for a bit of a kick. It adds flavor, not heat. Because the soup makes so much I divided it up into single portion containers and keep them in my freezer. The soup reheats easily in the microwave, just stir every few minutes to make sure it creams well. My strictly carnivore fiance willingly ate and loved the soup.

This was awesome!  I used a head of fresh broccoli, substituted some shredded 4 cheese blend instead of all velveeta.  I added a shredded carrot and 3 cloves of sliced garlic to the broccoli and broth.  

I had some stale french bread left over that I broiled with butter, garlic salt, parmesan cheese and parsely for croutons.

I also added some real grated cheddar cheese and used fresh broccoli, and the flavor is good.  It does make a ton, though, and I was a bit disappointed in the consistency - very thin.  I prefer this soup to be a bit thick.  I think you make a roux by adding the flour to the butter, but you don't boil the end product so it doesn't really thicken (I guess so the cheese doesn't break down).  I might try adding some cornstarch, or less broth next time.  The flavor is good, though, and I will probably make again!

Delicious! I have never made homemade soup and this was easy to make and I had everything in my kitchen. I only made enough for 3 people so I had to cut the recipe down, but it turned out great. I did add garlic to the onion and butter mixture only b/c I love garlic and add it to most things. Thanks for the recipe this will be part of my winter soup rotation.

Very good. Not as thick and creamy as I thought it would be. Maybe that's because I used fat free milk and reduced fat velveeta. Didn't matter because it still tasted great. I will definately make this soup again.

Absolutely yummy and super easy.  Paired with fresh baked bread, it is perfectly comforting to my whole family...I played with the cheeses since Velveeta isn't my favorite flavor.  A little velveeta is good, but this recipe is even better with some real cheddar!

This is excellent!  I've tried a few other recipes for this soup, but this is by far the easiest AND best tasting!  Serving with a simple grilled chicken breast and garlic bread would make a complete meal, although this is wonderful on it's own!

Excellent soup!!  I did, however, tweak the recipe a bit.  I added 1/3 the amount of velveeta, added sharp cheddar cheese and parmesean (to give it a bit of a tang).  I also cut down on the onion and used only 1/2 of what the recipe called for.

I thought it was a little too cheezy. So i ended up adding a little more milk. And it tasted not what i expected so i also added some fine diced celery and carrots. It tasted a lot better after that.

This is a good side soup, but not hearty enough for a full meal.  I did think it was a little too cheesy.  I will make this again, but reduce the cheese just a tad.

This recipe is very, very yummy. My entire family scarfed it down and I will continue to make it. The only difference is I added a little bit of garlic powder to the flour mixture :)

I used fresh broccoli and instead of canned chicken broth I used "better than bouillon "  chicken flavor.  Found in the local groc. store same isle as canned broth and bouillon.  Anyways, it came out very good, my family ate it all up!

This recipe is very good.  The only thing that I would change next time I make it is to find a way to thicken it up a little bit, but the taste is amazing!

This is the first time i have made this type of soup. it was very easy and turned out great!!  This is a must try recipe.  I made a few changes to the recipe that made it even better.  First, i used a 16 oz. package of frozen, chopped brocoli and a 14 oz. package of frozen brocoli florets (whole).  This give the soup more texture and makes it chunky.  (The recipe called for 3- 10oz. bags of frozen chopped brocoli, so it was the same amount that i used, just different cuts.) The other thing i changed was the onion.  my sister hates onions unless they are cut fine-she hates the texture.  i used about 1/4 cup of dried, diced onions instead of one fresh onion.  It turned out awsome!!

This was a great way to get those veggie portions into a diet, especially on a cold night. I did makes some alterations, however, to make it less loaded with fat. I used nonfat milk instead of whole milk, whole wheat flour instead of all-purpose flour and added two tablespoons more of flour, used only about 10 oz of velveeta instead of  1 1/2 lbs, and added a little more than half a teaspoon each of salt and garlic powder. I'm glad I cut back on the cheese because adding 10 oz was enough to make it cheesy but not everwhelmingly cheesy. Yummy!

I halved the recipe, and it turned out very good.  It was too much for me to eat alone (my husband doesn't like the soup by itself), so I made lightly seasoned chicken and rice and poured the soup over top.  Very good also. I also poured this over a baked potato, and it was EXCELLENT!

I took the suggestions in the comments and did 50% Velvetta Cheese and 50% Sharp Cheddar and it was delicious. I divided the recipe by 3 and still had more than enough for myself, my husband and our good friend (who can eat a lot- he is 6'6" 300lbs) to have 2 servings! I ended up using more than 1/4 lb of each cheese (which is what you get if you divide the cheese by 3 and then in half for 2 different cheeses) so I lost track on how much I ended up adding. And the broccoli was lacking. Next time I will use 2 bags instead of just 1 (if you divide the recipe by 3.) I served it with a toasted rustic baguette, salad and TriTip. It has the husband stamp of approval. I don't know how reheating on this will go which is why I made a considerably smaller portion. I feel like this is one of those things you just eat freshly made.

Excellent soup! I halved it, using about 1/2 Velveeta and 1/2 cheddar cheese. I first sauteed the onion in olive oil/butter and added some minced jarred garlic. I then added the broth and whole milk, added the cheeses, stirring until melted and also black pepper. I used fresh broccoli that I had on hand, microwaving for ~4 min before adding.  I had it with some garlic butter croutons. What a delicious and creamy comfort food type of soup!

This was a fantastic recipe! I did tweak it a bit. Instead of the Velveeta, i used seriously sharp cheddar and added a couple cloves of garlic to the onions. I substituted butter (instead of the marjarine) for the rich flavor and used a couple extra TB. Both hubby and adult son loved it! Very thick and creamy! This is a keeper.

This was a simple and easy recipe. I'm sure it's a great tasting soup as written but I couldn't help but amp it up a bit more to my Liking. I used half fresh broccoli and 1 bag frozen broccoli.  I also cut up some fresh cauliflower as well.  I steamed the broccoli and cauliflower for about 10 min before adding to soup. I also only used  about 1/2 lb of the Velveeta cheese and shredded a small block of mild cheddar cheese. It was prob more like a block n a half but u can never have too much cheese:) I also seasoned w a little salt and black pepper as Well.  My husband and 2 little kids loved it. Will Def be making again and again!!!

Finished product was very bland so I had to add more ingredients to make it appealing to our taste buds so the batch wouldn't be wasted. Won't be making this soup again.

This was so delish, better than a restaurant! I followed other's advice and used half velveeta and half shredded sharp cheddar, I also used fresh broccoli and black pepper instead of white because it was all I had. I'll definitely make this again! I wish I didn't half the recipe, I would have loved those leftovers:)

This recipe is perfect exactly the way it's written, though I do prefer to finely chop my onions. If I don't have enough Velveeta I'll use a good quality shredded cheddar cheese to make up the difference. Of course always taste and season to your preference.
Another great alternative is to use Swiss cheese instead of the Velveeta for Broccoli Swiss Soup - Absolutely Delicious!

This just wasn't good.  I have no idea how it has gotten so many good reviews. My 8 year old described it as straight cheese dip.  My 9 year old said the same thing.  My husband who usually eats anything I make said it tasted way too salty and all he tasted was Velveeta. I attempted to save it by adding a bunch of shredded sharp cheddar but there was no way to get rid of the cheese dip taste.  It was also very thin.  Unless you just love eating melted Velveeta, this is not the restaurant quality broccoli cheese soup you are looking for.  It does make a ton.

WOW!!! What an amazing dish. I received much love from my family at a family gathering. They licked their bowls. I only made a few small changes to the soup. I used a little over half of the Velveeta Cheese and a lb. of Cabot's sharp cheddar cheese. I added one large potato that I chopped up fine. I served a bowl of crispy bacon on the side and warm garlic bread. Died and went to heaven.

NUMMY NUMMY NUM!  Made half recipe (still came out with 6 full cups) - only change was to add a little garlic and scale cheese down by a third (dietary restrictions) - also used 2/3rd Velveeta and 1/3 cheddar after pureeing the soup a bit for a slightly smoother texture.  Fantastic recipe - thanks so much :)

What a GREAT recipe!  Not only was it easy and quick to make, it was delish! Will definitely make again.  I tried to follow the recipe but was short on chicken broth....and was not going to the store.  I used a 10 3/4oz can~cream of chicken soup mixed with 1 cup of water then added it to the broth. Family wants more! Thanks for sharing this recipe.

I made this recipe as stated with the following exceptions: I used 1 lb of Velveeta and 8 oz of cheddar (instead of all Velveeta) and I added some garlic. It was very good made this way; creamy texture and lovely flavor. I am not sure we would have liked it as much made with all Velveeta.

I made this as written, except that I used 1 head of cauliflower and 1 32 ounce bag frozen broccoli.  It is very good, thick and creamy.  I will try it again, using another reviewers idea of using 1/2 cheddar cheese and 1/2 velveeta.  That sounds even yummier.  This is a no fail recipe and you can tweek it however, you wish. This is definitely a keeper. Restaurant quality.

I was looking for something similar to the Broccoli Cheddar soup at Panera and this is it!  I used 1 lb of Velveeta and 1/2 lb of cheddar, but otherwise I stuck to the recipe.  I made sure that the milk got pretty thick before I added it to the broccoli and chicken broth, and then when everything was mixed together, I let it sit on medium heat for about 5-10 minutes to thicken it up.  It was delicious... I wouldn't change a thing, and I will definitely be making it again!

My husband and I love broccoli cheese soup but this was just cheese and more cheese. I made many changes to try to save the meal we were both looking forward to. In the end I had to toss the soup out.

As written, this recipe is just ok, good consistency, but it just seemed a little "eh."  To make it a bit more authentically "Wisco," and a lot less "eh," I did the following:  Used a 32 oz carton of Kitchen Basics chicken stock (lower sodium than Swanson's Low-Sodium), a 12-oz bottle of beer (Blue Moon Belgian White this time, but will use a darker, more full-bodied brew in the future), and 2 16-oz bags of WestPac frozen veggies - 1-Broccoli Normandy (broccoli, cauliflower, and carrots), 1-Mixed Dinner veggies (broccoli, cauliflower, carrots, yellow squash, butter beans, and red bell pepper).  I only had a red onion on hand, so I chopped up 1/2 of that (it was pretty big), and sauteed it with sliced pepper jack bratwurst (3 brats) and 3 cloves of fresh minced garlic.  I also added black pepper (can't stand white) and had a little oops! with dried parsley, but it was all good-thank goodness this recipe makes a lot, so the parsley just blended right in. I followed the method to the letter, using @ 13 oz cubed Velveeta and 2 cups shredded Mexican blend cheese.  Holy YUM! and excellent with some take & bake breadsticks.  Mm-mmm...  comfort food at its finest!  Tasty, pretty (with all those colors), & super-easy. :)

Very good! I add only one cup of Veelveta cheese 2 extra cups of chicken broth and an extra cup of milk. I also added a teaspoon of garlic. It came out delicious and it still was nice and thick. It's a keeper!! We had it for dinner and then lunch. Fed 6 adults. I also made homemade bread to dip in. Wow!!! What a meal!

This is a wonderful recipe! I won our family soup cook-off today & this is the recipe I used. I did make it my own by adding 5 coves of garlic (crushed), real butter instead of margarine, then I used 2 cups of the cheddar cheese sauce from Sams Club & 2 cups of shredded cheddar cheese & a handful of motzerella. I also used about 1/2 cup of half & half. I did not use the white pepper, but did use some black pepper & salt. I guess I chaned it a lot, but this recipe was my starting place. This soup turned out so delicious!!!

Wow! This was a HUGE hit! Even the ones that didn't like onions LOVED this! I diced them up too but all 7 people at the table raved about it! I doubled it (I am very glad) and added 1 can of Campbell's Cheese Soup to it instead of double Velveeta.

This soup is GREAT!! Its a bit salty so I would use low sodium broth next time. I also used 1lb velveeta and some aged white cheddar and used broccoli cuts so it would be chunkier. I wish this soup was healthier or Id eat it more often, haha!

I looked at every broccoli cheese soup recipe on the site and chose this one for its simplicity of ingredients. It is a wonderful basic recipe. 

Changes I made this time: added a chopped clove of garlic to the onions, only added 1 1/4 lbs Velveeta, and briefly used my immersion blender. 

Next time I think I will only use 1 lb of Velveeta. Seems almost too processed-cheesy with the recipe as written.

I was blown away with how good this soup was.  Not only was it simple to put together, but it's a real crowd pleaser.  The leftovers were just as delicious the next day.  This will be a regular meal at our home from now on, thank you!

I used this recipe because it called for milk.  I used fresh broccoli and cauliflour and shredded cheddar cheese.  I don't usually use canned soup in creamy dishes.

Wow just made this soup and it was great!!  So quick and easy didn't really have to measure just eyeballed everything.  The only changes that I made to the recipe was adding some garlic and some cheddar cheese.  Soup was a little on the watery side but that's how I prefer it.  Depending on your preference you might want to thicken it up.  GREAT RECIPE!!!

Didn't love it.  I think the predominant flavor was Velveeta cheese.  I would look for something else.

We loved this! Only added 1/2 onion and threw in about a clove of minced garlic. I also used half velveeta and half sharp cheddar. Very similar to the soup at Panera. We found it to make about 8-10 servings.

This was an excellent recipe!!! I did add 1/2 teaspoon of garlic powder and used the chicken broth to thin into desired consistency.  Also, I pureed half of the broccoli before it was cooked. Otherwise, it would have been to chunky.

This was really good soup! I made about 2/3 of the recipe, though. I used one 32 oz. carton of chicken broth, and one 16 oz. bag of frozen broccoli florets. After the broccoli cooked a while, I chopped it up more finely so there weren't big broccoli lumps in the soup. I also substituted cheddar cheese for about half of the Velveeta.

Break out your big pot for this one: I halved it per advice of previous posts and it still made a quart and a half! I used 1 1/2 large heads of fresh broccoli and 1/2 lb. of Velveeta with 1/2 lb. of grated sharp cheddar.  My only complaint about this soup is that I wish I'd left out the onion and perhaps added a dash of onion powder instead. If you're looking for a soup to hold you over until your next Jason's Deli fix, this will do it. I will definately make this again and recommend it to friends.

My kids love this(all 7 of them), they love it with french fried onions and crumbled bacon on top!  I love that it is fast and easy!  I use shredded cheddar in place of velveeta though, and it has always turned out for me.

I took JARRIE's advice from her review and changed the method completely. I also used fresh broccoli and shallots instead of frozen and onion. Used a bit less Velveeta and added a bit of nutmeg. Then I blended most of the soup to smooth it out a bit. With the changes, I LOVED IT!!! My favorite broccoli cheese soup to date. Thanks for the recipe starting point!   EDIT: I used roasted cauliflower to make this soup this weekend, using the same method. WOW...wonderful, wonderful! I will make this often.

Pretty good soup.  I had fresh broccoli, so I processed the broccoli and instead of simmering it separately added it after making the roux and adding chicken stock.  I then simmered for about 15 minutes, then added the cheese.  It worked just fine.  I also added celery at the onion step for a couple of reasons:  1) I didn't have enough onion  and 2) I like celery in soup.  I also added a few processed slices of carrots just for color.  It turned out really well.  One reviewer mentioned it is like Panera's; not quite, but it's close.  I, too, used half velveeta and half cheddar, and I halved the recipe.  It makes a lot, even with halving!  We have three good sized portions left over.  Thanks for the recipe!

I have made this several times now and it's perfect every time.  It's great as written, but most of the time I like to replace a little of the processed cheese food (velveeta) with some nice sharp cheddar.  Thank you for sharing.

Easy to make and delicious, but very rich with all that cheese. I used vegetable broth to make it vegetarian and purees it a bit with my immersion blender. Thanks!

Since I'm a big cheese fan, I added marbled cheddar instead of processed cheese and it worked out great! I also removed about a cup and a half, blended it, and put it back in. It gave the soup a nice green colour but left some big chucks of broccoli. Great recipe!

This is absolutely the best Broccoli Cheese soup recipe I have ever had!  I use the low sodium chicken broth to lessen the amount of salt.  I also use a whisk when I am adding the milk to the butter/onion mixture - always turns out perfectly smooth.  You won't be disappointed with this recipe!

LOVE THIS! 4 stars as written...5 stars if you use 1 lb velveeta & 8 oz shredded cheddar cheese. This gives it the res. quality. I also add in carrot matchsticks (cook it with the broc.)...even better! It just adds something...alot of rest. add them also. OH...this to me is way more than 6 servings...it can feed an army, especially since it is a very filling soup. Be careful how long you cook the veggies if you want the final result to have actual pieces of broc.

This was good, but was wayyy too watery and i did everything right, i also think there was way too much broccoli in it, i did take some out and puree it but still too many big pieces i only used 2 pkgs, shouldve used one or even less because when you eat broccoli cheese soup there isn't big pieces at all maybe a few....definitely won't make this again.l

My family LOVED this one! I also did the 1lb processed cheese food and 3/4 lb cheddar. Excellent combination! Instead of using canned chicken broth I used 5 1/4 cups homemade chicken stock. Turned out AMAZING!

Like others, I cut back on the processed cheese and added more cheddar. I also replaced the chicken stock with veggie stock to make it vegetarian. It was delicious! My daughter, who is picky about her broccoli cheese soup, loved this.

I have attempted to make broccoli cheese soup before, and it did not come out. This recipe tastes good and is easy to make.** I followed others advice and used 1lb. of Velveeta and 1/2lb. of sharp cheddar, one pinch of cayenne and a dash of garlic powder. I also added minced garlic to the onion. Thanks for this recipe.

I followed the suggestions and used 1lb velveeta and 1/2 lb cheddar.  It turned out wonderful!  Almost restaurant quality.  It does make a big batch, about 8 bowl servings.

As other reviewers stated, this is a good basic recipe and easy to make.  This was a little thick for my preference... so I would add a little more liquid or a little less flour next time.  Tossed some shredded carrots in with the broc for color.  My kids LOVED this.  Will make it again.

This is a great recipe! I used a red onion, land o lakes butter spread, jane's krazy mixed up salt instead of white pepper, and I also substituted 2 14.5 oz cans of Campbell's Cheddar Cheese soup in place of the processed cheese. For the chicken broth I used some regular and some reduced sodium. My 14 month old daughter and husband both loved it!

Great recipe. I followed another reviewer's suggestion and substituted cheddar for 1/2  lb of the Velveeta. The flavor is excellent.

this is a yummy soup. I made a few changes: I also used shredded carrot to add another level of flavor and color. I cook in with the onion and used 2 tbsp more butter. because I used more butter I also used 2 tbsp more flour and about 1 cup more chicken broth. Instead of velveeta, I used a package of american singles cheese (kraft) and a 1 1/2 cups shredded cheddar cheese! I got rave reviews from everyone who tried it! It is a keeper- I am actually making another pot of it for the freezer right now!

This recipe is awesome!! It is the best broccoli soup ever, it was a little thin at first ( my fault added to much broth) so I thickened it using some instant mashed potatoe flakes. It came out perfect! Creamy, thick and smooth. The kid loved it too.

Switched the serving size to 4 since I knew my kids wouldn't eat it.  Used 16 oz of broccoli instead of the 20 called for and used a whole onion.  It was easy to make and to die for!  Thanks!

I love this recipe because it is a great budget recipe.  It is inexpensive to make and makes A LOT!  Plus it heats up really well.  As a poor college kid I couldn't ask for more.  Plus its so easy and quick to make.  As some other people have mentioned on here, I like to use the smaller package of Velveeta (I think 1lb) and add some shredded cheddar.  Also I use my immersion blender to blend some of the large broccoli pieces.   If you don't have one, get one!  It is my favorite kitchen tool and perfect for making soups!!!

This is a great recipe. We don't care for onions so I substituted with onion powder and sauteed minced garlic with the butter instead. I also added cheddar cheese in addition to Velveeta. This was a great hit with kids I will have to double the recipe next time because there were no leftovers!

YUMMY!!  I did add some cheddar cheese and decreased the Velvetta to compensate.  I toasted some thin sliced French bread in the oven with olive oil until crunchy and served these as "dippers." Very, very good!

I made this soup following the recipe exactly. About halfway through this recipe the soup began to get really clumpy and thin. I was not impressed with the taste after the soup was done.

My family loved this recipe!  It is easy to make too.  I put some of the cooked broccoli in the blender before adding the cheese.  I also used the broccoli stalks which you would normally discard.  You just have to cook them a little longer than the tops.

Very good, I didn't have some of the ingredients and still it was good. I didn't have broth so I used the chicken Bouillon cubes in water, I only had a tiny bit of onions and I didn't use frozen broccoli-I used fresh. Still came out great. Thanks.

This was not just good but easy. I was out of milk (I know this never happens to anyone else):) So I used 1/2 and 1/2 instead. This was super flavorful! I did chop the cheese into small cubes as stated by other reviewers. I also added the cheese and waited a min or two until I stired it! Thanks for this awesome EASY recipe! Oh Man My husband just added salsa to his bowl wow!

Very good flavor, I followed the suggestions of other when they said half as much velveeta and used some real cheddar. My whole family loved it. I will definitly make this again and again. I am betting it would even taste yummy with some potatos.

This soup is really delicious.  I made as written, but used 1 10-oz pkg chopped broccoli and 2 14-oz bags of baby broccoli florets, cutting off and throwing away any long stems on florets. It does seem like a lot of velveeta, but turned out perfect.  It makes about 10 servings, but why make soup if you can't have leftovers?  Everyone in my family loved it and I will make it again and again.

This was the first time I made broccoli cheese soup. To cut the calories, I cut down the cheese to 8 oz. velvetta and about 4 oz. sharp shredded cheddar and it was absolutely delicious.

I would give it 3.5 on a 5 point scale. I used half Velveeta & half sharp cheddar, but to me the Velveeta flavor was still overwhelming.  Might try again using all cheddar.

My family loved this soup.  We did find it a bit cheesy so I cut the cheese to 2/3 of what the recipe calls for.  The second time they were begging for the leftovers!  I also added a tad more broccoli than what is called for.

Maybe we have been spoiled by Panera Bread's Broccoli soup because my husband and I thought this was too bland. Although a good starter recipe, we felt that it was lacking in flavor plus we had to add corn starch continously to make it thick...

I'm not a big fan of velveta, so I used 1lb cubed velveta and 2 1/2 cups shredded cheddar (both 2% milk brand).  I also added approx 2 tsp minced garlic to my fried chopped onion. (garlic will burn, so add after the onion has cooked for a couple of mins) I also added 4 large potatoes (cubed and with skin on)to the broccoli to cook in chicken broth until fork tender. We like our food alitte spicy, so I added some cajun seasoning and a few hot pepper flakes. Excellent recipe,I didn't miss the extra fat at all- do you really need it with all that butter? Serve with some hot rolls and you got supper!

Great recipe!  My 3 year old is a fanatic about broccoli cheese soup and I wanted to make him some and this is exactly what I was looking for.  I did follow some of the other suggestions and added some cheddar in place of the Velveeta and it was great. I thought it was even better than the kind you get in the restaurant because it had more broccoli.  So good, thanks!

This was really, really good but I have to rate this a 3 bec I dont think Id like it too much without my changes. First off I made this in the slow cooker. Put 4 cups chicken broth, 8 ounces Velveeta and 8 ounces mild chedder cheese on high for an hour to let the cheese melt. While that was cooking I cooked some bacon and sauteed an onion and 3 cloves garlic. Threw some frozen broccoli in the bacon, onion, cloves and cooked on low for 4 hours. Near the end I put 4 tablespoons flour to thicken it up and left the slow cooker uncovered for 15 mins. I didnt put any milk in it didnt seem to need it. Had some butter and toast on the side. I will def make again. Thank you for the inspiration.

My instincts told me I would not like this due to the processed cheese but the reviews on this were good so I went with it anyway. I wish I would have listened to my gut.  I even tried half and half with chedder and velveeta but still the flavor was overwhelmingly processed.  Sorry.  If you like the flavor of velveeta then it is a good soup if not try another recipe.

Great Recipe can't say I did it to exact specifications.  I used fresh broccoli and cooked it through.  I also @ times use part process cheese slices and part shredded cheddar or marble cheese which ever I have on hand.  Thank you for the recipe it is a keeper for me.

Simple and delicious! I like adding a little cayanne, as well as the pepper.  I steamed fresh broccoli almost until desired doneness, let it cool on a baking sheet, and added it to the soup at the very end.

Just made this 5 minutes ago. It is a very good soup--the sauteed onions+flour+milk surprisingly made it the right color, texture, and creamy taste. If you want a less cheesy taste, then put a 1/4 of the cheese recommended and add a tablespoon of salt. If you want all the cheesy taste, then go with the recipe--it'll be so cheesy that it'll taste like cheese dip =)

I changed the recipe a bit and it still turned out wonderfully!  This is a GREAT base recipe for this soup and very easily altered!  It was TOO good!  I was afraid it was all I would eat the next day since it makes so much that I had to give it away!  YUMMY!!!!!!!!

This turned out great.  I will make it again.  I followed the basic recipe, but used fresh broccoli and real butter.  I also cut back on the velveta by almost half and replaced with cheddar cheese.  Great recipe!

Very Good.  Next time will cut down on the processed cheese, and add cheddar as well.  I ended up adding cheddar to my own bowl, and it made all the difference.  I also added chopped onion to the beginning mix.

This was very good. I had not made broccoli cheese soup before and was a little nervous, so I read all the reveiws. Used 1/2 cup heavy cream then the rest milk to make 2/3 cup. Used 4 oz cheddar/4 oz velvetta cheese. It was so easy and so good! Thank you!!

This soup was delicious and easy!  I did follow another person advice and cut the velvetta to 1 pound and added a half pound of sharp cheddar.  I reccommend buying more than one loaf of crusty bread to go with this.

Fabulous soup.  I cut the amount of processed cheese to 2 lbs and added 1 lb of cheddar as others recommended.  I don't know if it made a difference or not but it is an excellent soup.  I will most definetly make it again.  When they say it makes a lot, trust them.  My 6 quart stock pot wasn't big enough.

I just love this soup.  It's so easy & delicious!  I skip the onion step as my husband can't stand onions.  However I do add some minced garlic and one peeled & cubed potato along with the brocoli, then kind of mash them up a bit once they're tender.  It makes for a very hearty delicious soup!

I LOVE THIS SOUP!  Just enough broccoli, some recipes are too skimpy.  I used 1/2 shredded cheddar and 1/2 light velveeta as one reviewer suggested, it was delicious, thanks for the great recipe!

Oh my gosh! This is by far the absolute BEST broccoli cheese soup that I have ever tried! I followed the recipe exactly as is and would not change a thing! A wonderful "comfort food" recipe-if you are a cheese lover and also like broccoli then this is the recipe for you! A definite keeper! Thank you SO MUCH Melissa!

My husband came home last night, sick as a dog and wanted Broccoli cheese soup.  I knew I had frozen broccoli and Velveeta in the kitchen so I came and found this recipe.  It turned out fantastic.  I have never made this type of soup and I was out of flour so I had to substitute cornstarch but it turned out so good.  I don't even really care for Broccoli cheese soup and I liked this!!  Thank you for this recipe.

I hadn't made this before, but due to all the excellent reviews I thought I'd take a chance and make this for a party tomorrow. Would have just made it tomorrow if I'd have known it would be so quick and easy...also, now I'm seriously worried my hubby and I will eat it ALL before the party, and oh gosh darn it, I'd have to make more...yes, it IS that good!!

As other reviewers suggested I went with a 1 lb. block of Velveeta, and 1/2 lb. of shredded sharp cheddar cheese. Also, I shredded a carrot and cooked it with the broccoli for some color contrast. I added fresh ground black pepper to the roux.

I worried there might be too much flour in the roux, but the proportions were perfect and it thickened beautifully with 2% milk.  

Every bit as good as Quizno's...thank you so much for a true keeper!!

Tasted great and my 6 year old son even commented how good it tasted!!  We mixed it with cauliflower as well and made it with fresh veggies instead of frozen.

I made this recipe exactly as written, but with the addition of 1/2 lb grated cheddar. Hubby and I both agreed it just tastes like broccoli with a cheese sauce on it, not broccoli soup (we were looking for something like Quiznos). The next day I added more chicken broth, 2 garlic cloves, a can of cream of celery soup, 2 grated carrots, 1/4 teaspoon of nutmeg, and then enough whole milk to make it creamy and not too thick. It was perfect then, just like Quiznos. But this recipes makes a LOT. We ate it for three days and then I ended up freezing two large containers.

OH MY LORD THIS SOUP WAS AWESOME!!!  My husband loves broccoli/cheese soup and he ate all of this up!  I used 1lb of velveeta and 1/2 lb of grated sharp cheddar as recommended.  IT was SOOO good!  Will definitely make again!

Love this recipe!!
Followed the suggestion of another reviewer and used half valveeta and half old cheddar, not a huge valveeta fan, turned out very good. I've been looking for a good recipe(for this soup)to match Denny's Broccoli and Cheddar soup, pretty darn close. Will be keeping this and making it again!!!!!

This is very good. My family enjoyed it.

 I  substituted sharp cheddar cheese for a half a pound of the velveeta. The taste was still a little too velveeta for me, but that is just personal taste. Next time I will add a little more sharp cheddar, and a little less velveeta. 

 Overall, this is a great recipe. The soup was nice and creamy, and had plenty of broccoli flavor along with the cheese. I will make this again. Thank you.

This soup is GREAT! It is the first time I have ever made broccoli cheese soup, and it is SOOO easy! I halved the recipe just in case it was a flop, but next time, I will double it to share with the neighbors and to freeze for later!

This soup is fabulous! It's thick and hearty and has a ton of flavor. Broccoli Cheese soup is the only kind of soup my husband ever orders in a restaurant, and he thought this recipe was the best he'd ever had. And did I mention that it's incredibly simple and doesn't take much time to throw together!! I did make a couple of changes after reading some of the previous reviews. First of all I cut the recipe in half which made more than enough for the three of us. I also substituted grated cheddar for half of the processed cheese, and used regular pepper instead of white. This is definately a keeper and one that I will be serving on a very regular basis!

This was good and very easy to make. I used 2 cans of regular chicken broth and 1 can of garlic chicken broth. I also used 2 lbs of Velveeta instead of 1 1/2 lbs the recipe calls for. My husband and 3 year old son loved it. It does make a big batch of soup but we love leftovers. This would be good on a baked potato.

This was okay - I wouldn't make again, also too salty for us. I like a brighter taste, less processed cheese flavor. Thanks though.

This was a good recipe,It was my first time making cheese & broccoli soup, I just used it for an idea to start and  ommitted the onion, used shredded cheddar cheese & mozzerella instead of velveeta and added carrots and it came out really good.

This was my first attempt at making any type of soup and it came out wonderfully!  My husband and kids all loved it!  The only change I made to the recipe was I used 1 lb of Velvetta and 1/2 lb of shredded sharp cheddar cheese.  The flavor was perfect and the color was beautiful.    It made a lot of soup so there are plenty of leftovers...which I love!  Thanks so much for this recipe, I will be making this all winter long!

I am a huge fan of Quizno's broccoli cheese soup and always wanted to try making it at home. This is the first recipe I tried and it was awesome, maybe even better than Quizno's!!!! Thanks for the delicious recipe.

I have to give it 4 stars because I was the only one who loved it. My kids didn't like it, and my husband siad "well it's food". I couldn't get enough, I loved it. Only made a 1/3 of the recipe and added a can of cream of broccoli soup to thicken up. Didn't mind using a can of soup since I allready used frozen broccoli and processed cheese.

I love broccoli cheese soup.. but this knocked my socks off!  I used a recipe for french bread and added a pinch of rosemary to the dough to make 4 bread bowls.  The combination of the two was divine.

I have made this several times since first reading the recipe. It is easy AND delicious! I actually used 1/3 of each of the ingredients. This made enough to serve as an accompaniment for my family of three. For those who find the soup to thin, thickening the roux will help to thicken the soup.

I thought this soup was pretty good, but a little to much cheese for me.  Next time I think I'll try a different cheese. I also put my in the blender to smooth it out because I couldn't get the clumps of flour to break down.

Excellent. I had 3 pounds of FRESH broccoli to use up so I chopped some of it up instead of using frozen. Simmered it a little longer in the broth. Added some chopped carrots and minced garlic to the onion. Used a little red pepper for kick.

I gave this 4 stars, just because I switched it up a bit.  After my broccoli cooked, before I added the milk goop, I broke up some of the broccoli with my immersion blender for a smoother texture (I left some chunks).  I subbed 20oz of sharp cheddar for the velveeta, and used black pepper,some salt, garlic salt and a few shakes of dry mustard for some zing.  This is SO fast and easy, very comforting and makes a ton.  I can't wait to have leftovers for lunch today!

This was the first time I made any kind of soup and it turned out really good. I used vegetable broth instead of chicken broth. for the cheese I used Campbell's Condensed Cheddar. My husband andI really enjoyed the soup. Just two servigs lasted 2 whole days for us.

This is the first time I've made broccoli cheese soup, but I've always loved it at restaurants and when other people have made it.  This recipe was SO easy!  I accidentally bought Queso cheese instead of regular cheese, and it still turned out good.  I added a few slices of American cheese and a cup of shredded cheddar cheese since I made that boo boo.  I don't think white pepper is necessary if you don't have any on hand... I bought some since it called for it, but black pepper would work fine. I've never used white pepper, so I wasn't sure.  I loved the soup, and I will definitely make it again.  Next time I'll get the right cheese though.  :o)

This was soo excellent. Rich but not TOO rich like some other Broccoli and Cheese soups I have made in the past. I made a few changes. I added one can chicken broth, one can vegetable broth and a can of water. I also added fresh garlic and cayenne pepper. 

Thanks for the recipe!

I didn't have white pepper and it was still tasty! really easy to make and you never have to come close to boiling it for everything to mix together nicely. I'm serving it to a huge crew of people on a cold wet movie set, and I know they're going to love it! Hearty and crowd pleasing.

Excellent recipe - such a satisfying, comforting soup!  As others suggested, I sauteed some garlic with the onions and added one diced potato withe the broccoli.  Also, I use American Cheese from the deli - prefer the taste over the shelf-stable block type.  I used both white and yellow American cheese along with some cheddar.  Great texture and flavor.

I made it with the following tweaks.  Use 2 1/2 pounds fresh broccoli.  The frozen has too many woody stems. Use 1 pound velveeta and 1/2 pound mild cheddar.  Add 2 cans of diced new potatoes.  Makes a fantastic soup even non soup eaters will love.

This soup was amazing, and relatively quick to make.  I added a clove of garlic with the onions and also added some shredded carrots to give more color and texture.  It came out great.  I did downsize on the ingredients after reading the other reviews.  This is a keeper.

This was a winner! I’ve never made Broccoli Cheese soup before because I thought it would be too hard to make. This recipe was easy and delicious. I cut the recipe down to 4 servings since people said it made a lot. Even after I cut it down, it made six large soup bowls full. I followed the recipe exactly except I put some of the broccoli in the food processor to make some smaller pieces. This was thick and rich. I will make this again. Yummy! :-)

Ruined the broccoli for Christmas dinner so salvaged it with this soup. Agree with doubling the cheese. Used Velveeta to ensure an even melt. A little sharp cheddar would probably enhance the flavor. I used 1% milk but would use 1/2 and 1/2 next time. I did not have enough cornstarch so I made a roux of an equal amount of flour. Thickness good, but flour leaves a slight after taste. Next time I would use cornstarch. I love garlic but did not think it enhanced this soup. I would omit. The recipe does make a lot of soup. Enough for 10 servings at least.

Very tasty! Used two cans of cheddar soup instead of the Velveeta and one clove of chopped fresh garlic. Added a generous amount of pepper and served with warm french bread. Great meal for cold winter nights. Will be making this again.

Amazing soup that  my wife loves.  Only changes made was I use 1 lb of Velveeta and 1 lb of cheddar cheese.  Otherwise it taste like a bowl of Velveeta cheese dip instead of soup.  I also added 1 package of sliced portabella mushrooms and  sautéed them with the onion.  which my wife and I love.    I give this  2.5 stars without this change.  But a strong 4 stars with the change.  
Update:
For extra flavor add bacon crumbles!

Delicious, hearty soup.  I like a thick soup, so I added the whole block of Velveeta plus 1/2 C corn starch dissolved in an additional 1 C milk.

I didn't have milk so I used 1 cup heavy cream. I only had 16 oz bag of broccoli, I chopped it in food processor. I used black pepper instead of  white pepper.  I followed the rest of recipe as is. It came out perfectly. Goes great w/baguette (from Panera Bread). Yum. Thank you for sharing this recipe.

I save the bottom tougher part of the broccoli and freeze it when I cook the florets.   When I have enough, I use it to make soup.  This is the first time I made this particular recipe, but I did not have chicken broth so I substituted watered down beef broth.  I use my immersion blender when the soup is well cooked. The outcome was delicious.  I also used sharp cheddar cheese and put grated Parmesan cheese on top when I served it. Hubby was pleased and I served it with crusty bread.

This turned out wonderful. I substituted a pound and a half of real cheddar for the Velveeta and just mixed it in very slowly, a little at a time, at the end with the heat turned off. I had no trouble and it turned out creamy and delicious. Thanks!

This recipe is GREAT!! I have to agree with previous reviewer that all Velveeta is not my idea of cheese soup. While the Velveeta is a must, as it lends to the creamy texture and makes the real cheese not separate, to make a quality cheese soup you have to use real cheese. I used one lb cheddar and half lb velveeta. I chose mild cheddar but I think sharp would've made it perfect. I used a medium sized onion and while it didnt degrade the soup in terms of flavor, the family thought it was just too much onion to chew, even diced well. Overall the recipe is a winner and went into the recipe box.

Since I was making this for a group of 10, I increased the recipe by 1/3 which worked perfectly.  Typically I don't care for broccoli cheese soup, but this was delicious.  I used low sodium chicken broth and unsalted butter.  No one felt the need to add salt to the soup when served.

I don't write very many reviews because I like to change things on recipes to fit what I like. But this recipe is worth the review.  I read the comments and did change 1 thing but I also think it would be great as written.  I only used 1 pound of velveta and 1/2 pound of cheddar. We had company over and they loved it.  Everyone went back for seconds. This one is a keeper.

Excellent recipe.  Very easy to make.  Delicious.  I also used 1 lb of velveeta and 1/2 pound of mild cheddar and it was very cheesy.  Maybe too much.   But tasted delicious.

Excellent soup.  I used about 3 tablespoons corn starch with 1/2 cup water.  Also, used 2 cups half and half  rather than regular milk.    I'm sure I will make this many times in the future!

Made this soup, and cut the amount of cheese as was too cheesy for our adult tastes. Once adjusted very flavorful and satisfying soup served with a crusty roll.

I tweaked it a bit, I use 2 cups of velveeta cheese, sometimes 1 cup velveeta and 1 cup cheddar cheese depending on what I have.  Instead of flour I use cornstarch mixed in water and drizzle in broth, broccoli mix then add cheese.  If it is too thick add a bit more broth, too thin add more cornstarch mix. Very easy and delicious.

I give my version 5 stars, but I made many adjustments as suggested by others.  Because of that, the recipe as stated isn't perfect, so 4 stars.  I did 1lb Velveeta + 8 oz. cheddar; added one large potato peeled and diced; and used 2 cans reduced sodium + 1 regular can chicken broth.  Also used fresh broccoli, not frozen.

I just made this and want a bowl of it right now!  Very good, nice and smooth.  I did use my blender to blend some of the broccoli, added some white wine to the onions while cooking and a clove of crushed garlic.   Used medium cheddar and 3 year old Balderson cheese.  Added fresh ground pepper by mistake, but flavour is yummy!  All I need now is some fresh tea biscuits and dinner is ready.

I love this recipe but I did follow some reviewers' recommendations.  I used 1 lb. Velveeta and 1/2 lb. sharp cheddar and I was very careful not to let the soup come to a boil.   I also added a large clove of garlic, minced, to the onion but not sure that added anything.  At the end I added some red pepper because my family likes spice.  The best overall tip was to add the cheese to the onion mixture, which I did in portions, and stir to melt, and then add to the broccoli.  I think this was an excellent tip.  I served with warm ham slices and artesian style bread.  My boys loved this and it made a LOT so leftovers for the weekend.  Thanks!

Fabulous soup!!!!  I added a two cloves of garlic for more flavor, and cut the cheese in half to cut calories. To ensure it was creamy, I blended it with a hand blender. I served it at a holiday dinner and it got rave reviews.

This is a great recipe.  The only thing I did different was use fresh broccoli (because it tastes better than frozen)  and used Bob's Red Mill All Purpose Baking Flour because I have a gluten allergy.

This soup was very good and my family just loved it.  It was cheesy but not TOO cheesy.  I couldn't find chopped broccoli so I used some bags of frozen broccoli florets, let them boil for the 15 minutes and then used a strainer to take the broccoli out of the broth, chopped the broccoli up and then added it back in.  The soup seemed a bit too soupy so I added in about 1/3 cup of plain mashed potato flakes which made the soup creamy and perfect.  I also added in a package of chopped up tasso which gave the soup a wonderful smokey quality.  Will definitely make this again!

I took the advise of others and cut the recipe in half,  this fed 4 big servings.  I used raw broccoli and boiled in the broth.  I also took the advise of cutting the velveeta and adding hard cheddar.  This was terrific soup and will make again, i served it with hot sauce on the side for a spicy kick.

This is a very good recipe. I made it exactly as written, so I could give it a fair review. The flavor is excellent and I love the creamy texture of this soup! Will make his recipe over and over again!

Love this recipe! I have taken the suggestions of others on the cheese; I usually double the batch so I use 2 lbs processed cheese and 2 lbs sharp cheddar shredded cheese. I also only use one onion for a double batch; these changes make it taste as close

I will definitely make again!! I did make some of the tweaks that other reviewers suggested.  I added 2 cloves of garlic ( at least), some crushed red pepper flakes, and used 1 pound of Jalapeno Velveeta and 1/2 pound of fresh sharp cheddar cheese.  Also added some mushrooms because my husband and I love them in everything.  I personally liked that the recipe made a large pot because it is one that I want lots of leftovers.

Delicious!!! Best recipe ever!! I have made this twice and agree with a previous comment. It is much easier to melt the cheese with the milk, flower, butter and onion mixture it melts nicer then add it to the broccoli and broth.

Wife and kids loved it.  I did substitute flour instead of corn starch.  If I had it to do all over again I would have useed half and half instead of milk.  I also used real cheese which didn't melt as much as the process cheese would have, but I prefer the real stuff.  Shredded cheese would be better with some left over as a garnish.  I used mild cheddar, but I'm sure sharp cheddar would have worked too.  Great recipe.

husband liked it, but he is a cheese freak and loves anything cheesy! :) i on the other hand am not the biggest fan of just velveeta in recipes,  so i added a couple of handfuls of real cheese in with it as well. i also thinned it out more with extra milk so it had more of a "soup" consistency,instead of dip. i added potatoes and ham chunks in it as well. debated using bacon instead of the ham,might do that next time. all in all though,this is definitely a good basic soup and with a few tweaks to make it your own,it will most likely stay on our dinner rotation. :)

This is a wonderful recipe, and any changes that I made are for health reasons or because I needed to because I didn't have some things in my pantry.  It was so easy to make and the best broccoli soup I've ever made.  Because of a recent dental surgery, I did find that the broccoli was a bit hard, so when I make it again, and I will make it again, I will boil it in the broth for a bit or just cut the broccoli up more before cooking.  I also only had one pound of Velveeta so I put that plus 3/4 pound of sharp cheddar.  Lastly, I'm from Louisiana where we put Tony's seasoning in EVERYTHING so I added this instead of pepper.  I'm sure pepper would have been just fine.  Thank you for the amazing recipe!

This was the easiest soup recipe. I added garlic to the onions and substituted sharp cheddar for the Velvetta. My husband and daughter both loved it. Definitely making this again.

I made this for supper tonight.  Delicious!  I didn't have Velveeta so I used grated sharp cheddar cheese and I used fresh steamed broccoli instead of frozen.  Very good as is but it was quite thick so I think next time I will use more chicken broth.   I am not a big fan of broccoli on it's own but this just fortifies my opinion that you can make anything delicious with cheese. :)

This was a hit at dinner with my family. However you really need to add your own spices; pepper isn't enough. I used Colby-Jack cubes and it was great.

I love how simple and easy this soup is to make. I used fresh broccoli in place of frozen and didn't have any white pepper so just left it out and added a sprinkle of black to my own bowl before enjoying. Very Velveeta-y. Next time I will only put in half the block and then 1/2-3/4 cup of shredded cheddar instead to elevate the taste. Definitely worth making.

I didn't think this was going to turn out very well, but boy was I wrong!  I have been looking for a recipe  that tastes like the broccoli cheese soup I used to eat at a restaurant in Omaha, NE called Little King's.  I found it!  This soup is fantastic!!  On a side note: the only way I deviated from this recipe was I added a few shakes of garlic powder.

This is a great recipe! I used bouillon cubes and freshly shredded cheddar cheese (I only used Cheddar, since Velveeta isn't something I ever want to work with.), which I shredded by hand while fresh broccoli boiled in water for half an hour. I wasn't even sure how much cheese I incorporated, but it worked well anyway! Thanks for the recipe!

Great recipe and easy to make! Instead of doing the onion flour mix in a separate pan, we used our stock pot and added the milk and the broth gradually. For added flavor, we cooked and chopped up some bacon to put in! We also took the advice of another user and did half velvetta and half cheddar! All 4 of my picky kids loved it!!

This is how I have always made my broccoli cream cheese soup with one exception...... After I have everything mixed together, I pour a little beer in it until I can slightly taste it.  You will be amazed at how good that is, and  I get rave reviews on it.  I also put a little beer in my potato cheese soup as well.  I cook a lot with beer and wine.  They enhance the flavor of a lot of dishes.

Just made this and love it, however for fewer calories I used skim milk and low sodium broth.

If I could give this recipie it would be an 11! Very good. Makes a lot which I like, a lot! 

*I added shredded chicken & mushrooms just to put some "filling" into it. We also used half a thing of the off brand velveeta! Melts much faster

I used fresh broccoli and this was very good.  Next time (and there will be a next time) I make it I will use less chicken broth.  This wasn't quite as thick as I would like it.  Other then that this recipe is perfect.

Quick and easy!  Regular ingredients that you keep in your cupboard. A great restaurant style taste. This is definitely one of my "go-to" recipes on a cool Fall day.  Yum... Comfort food.

I pretty much followed the recipe as written - I did take the advice of a few and only made 1/2 of the recipe. Perfect amount for my family. A tad think so next time I will add a little more liquid and a little less cheese, but that's just my preference with regard to texture/consistency.

This was amazing ! Loved it ! I cut everything in half or so because I was only making it for 3 people. Some sides I made with it was just some toast, and cheddar broccoli rice on the bottom of my bowl to add something else to it:) thanks !!!!! Will make again ! :)!

I thought this tasted descent. I had some broccoli leftover from the farmers market close to turning. So, I just did a 1/3 of the posted recipe. That amount made 4-5 servings. Only change I made was just using for Kraft singles for the Velveeta. I am sure the whole amount would have made it more cheesy tasting though. I also added a 1/4 cup of shelf stable whipping cream, to use it up, in addition to the milk. I opted for black pepper instead of white, as it is more handy. My only real issue with the recipe, it is just a bit to salty for me. As to be expected with chicken broth and processed cheese though. It made for a quick lunch either way.

The wonderful thing about soup is that you can put your mark on it and improvise. I added finely chopped carrots, reduced the flour and added mashed potatoes. I put some of the broccoli into the food processor and added it also. I do not use processed cheese for anything so I added cheddar, a touch of heavy cream and some cooked diced potato. Then seasoned to taste. The great thing about this recipe is versatility. One of my favorite soups for sure.

Delicious! I, like many reviewers, added a block of cheddar cheese to velveeta. I added a tablespoon of minced garlic when sauteeing the onions. My friends said it was better than the one at Panera :). I also used 1 can of evaporated milk (1.5 cup) and 1/2 cup of water instead of 2 cups of milk. That was only because I didn't have any regular milk on hand. Still turned out pretty delicious. And so easy! I will definitely be making this again. Frozen broccoli works wonderfully here. I did not detect any compromise in taste by using frozen broccoli instead of fresh.

Easy to make and a good recipe. I tweaked a little - I added a little extra roux and used fresh broccoli. I also reduced Velvetta to used 3/4 lb. It's far from a healthy soup but it sure was delicious!

I like this recipe.  I didn't have any stock so I used 6 chicken buillon things.  I also DOUBLED the amount of broccoli.  Trust me, it isn't too much. I used fresh.  Kroger's sells 24 ounce bags of florets and I used two. I cut the stems and only left the flowers.  One bag just wasn't doing it.  It was like the broccoli melted.  So don't use the 2 cups of milk either or all that flour.  With the added broccoli it thickens ok.  If anything cut the flour in half.

Great recipe! Although, I like less cheese in my soup, so I only added about 1 cup of cubed cheddar. Also,a great add is some spinach!  An easy way to sneak in some protein without the kids or husband noticing.  Delicious!!

I had some leftover steamed broccoli florets and garlic red-skin potatoes in the fridge and decided soup was the best way to use them up. I read a few recipes on this site and chose this one; I liked the idea of cooking the flour into the onions rather than adding it (or cornstarch) later with liquid. Since my broccoli was already cooked, I didn't simmer it in the chicken broth separately; I slowly added the broth to the thickened milk mixture then added the chopped-up broccoli once that was warmed through (along with my leftover potatoes). Seasoned with lots of pepper after I stirred in the cheese ... delicious. I think next time I will try it with a combination of Velveeta and cheddar, as some reviewers have suggested.

I just made this recipe (eating some right now). I have tried a lot of broccoli cheese soup recipes and did not like them. This one is it. I also tweaked a few things...I used 1Lb velveeta and added shredded cheddar. I did not use onions but did add onion powder and garlic powder. I also melted the cheese into the milk mixture before putting it into soup.I will def use this one again!

This was delicious. My whole family loved it. I did change like one of the previous reviewers and used a mix of cheddar and mozzarella instead of the processed cheese because that's what I had on hand.

Just as good if not better than any restaurant's broccoli cheese soup!  I did use only 1 pound of velveeta and then half a pound of cheddar, but did everything else to the letter.  This is a great base too!  I'll be using the leftovers to bake chicken in and then serve it over rice  :-)  thanks for the wonderful recipe!!!

Made a few changes-simmered cauliflower and broccoli in chicken broth for soup. Also, I used fresh not frozen. I used a small loaf of velveeta, which I don't think is 1 1/2 lbs. And I added black pepper and nutmeg to the flour mixture instead of at the end. The whole family loved! My 3 yr old had 2 big bowls! I think next time I might add chopped carrots to it to add even more veggies!

This was excellent - even better than I was expecting. I followed the recipe as written except I used fresh broccoli and butter in place of margarine. Even my kids liked this. Yea!

Outstanding soup. I backed off on the Velvedta and used alittle Mexican mix shredded cheese. I used 2lbs of fresh broccoli instead of the frozen and used salt free chicken stock. I loved this soup. Hearty, filling and very fresh tasting. I highly recommend this recipe.

Very delicious! I used this as a guide because I only wanted to make half of this recipe. I will certainly make again. I added garlic, black pepper and red pepper as my season.

This was a very delicious recipe. My family loved it!
** I chopped 2 huge heads of fresh broccoli instead of frozen- and  I added 2 cups shredded cheddar 
to the 1 pound of velveeta cheese.   Thick rich tasting-perfect!

Made this for my family it was a hit with my sister and her boyfriend.  Used almond milk, little bit of paprika, minced garlic,and pepper. I would have added extra onion if I had one but other than that this recipe rocks!

I used fresh broccoli and let it sit in the chicken broth for a while and added a can of carrots. Instead of onion, I used onion powder and added some garlic powder as well. I couldn't find my white pepper, so I used black. IT IS FANTASTIC! My son who doesn't particularly care for broccoli loves it! YUMMMMOOOO!

Good, but was great with some modifications.  I used butter, not margarine, I also added 1/2-1cp white wine in with the chicken broth.  This really enhanced the flavor of the cheese!  I also used cheddar cheese rather than velveta and added some onion powder and dry mustard as well.

Okay, I admit . . . I tweaked it.  I added some white wine with the broth, some fresh thyme from my herb garden and because I was using the ends from the broccoli I had left from the broccoli salad I also made, I sauteed the onions in the pan I used for cooking the bacon also for the broccoli salad.  It also needs fresh ground pepper and salt to taste!

This soup is so simple to make! I just hated the taste of Velveeta, even with half Velveeta and half real cheddar cheese :P Next time I'll try to substitute cheddar cheese soup.

Yummy! Used fresh broccoli from the garden-cooked it in the broth. Used about half sharp cheddar and half velveeta. I didn't use the whole 1/2 cup of flour. I wanted it a little thinner because it's summer Yummy!

Good as is but much better if you only use about a third processed cheese, replace the rest with real cheese. White pepper is good but you can use black pepper not a huge difference in flavor.

My boyfriend loved this soup. I didn't add the onion in. I used 6 chicken bouillon cubes and 6 cups of water to make the chicken broth. I used Velveeta cheese also. It turned out great!

I've made this recipe several times now and we love it. I did add some chopped carrots in with the onions, about 1 cup and sauteed them together. Like raerae83 suggested I do this all in one pan. After sauteeing I stir in the flour and the slowly mix in cold broth and milk until the flour is dissolved into the liquids. I then add my broccoli, this time I'm using frozen flowerettes  in place of the chopped stuff. I don't like finding those woody stems in my soup and sometimes the chopped has them. I simmer the soup until the carrots and broccoli are tender and then stir in the cheese until melted and heated through. I've also tried using 1 pound of veleeta and 1/2 pound of shredded cheddar. That should take care of the too velveeta-ey taste some complained of. Either way it's a great recipe. Thanks Melissa

I was very pleasantly surprised by this one. I used fresh veggies leftover from a veggie tray for a baby shower (broccoli and cauliflower about 5 or 6 cups), onion powder instead of onions since I didn't have any, and a pound of Velveeta with half pound to a pound of shredded cheddar cheese. I also sauted 3 cloves of garlic with the butter and added some garlic powder (tip from another recipe). It turned out pretty good. I also made this in the crock pot instead of on the stove. I love broccoli and cheese soup but had never made it myself. This recipe now allows me to make it myself and enjoy it whenever I want.

I listened to the reviews about switching out some of the Velveeta for Cheddar Cheese (Campbell's Cheddar Soup) and it was delicious. Restaurant quality! I decided to half the recipe based on the reviews and I wished I hadn't only because I love this soup and leftovers!

I gave this five stars, because it is such a versatile recipe and it came out perfect! Of course I tweaked mine, but I think it would've come out just fine without tweaking. I did not use Velveeta. I used American Cheese from the deli counter. It's not as salty and not really that much more expensive. It made for an excellent soup. Thank you for the wonderful recipe. Mine tastes just like the famous restaurants out there!

I'm seconding other reviewers suggesting different cheese. I used a mix of extra sharp cheddar, provolone, mozzerella, and swiss. 

Also, I added a couple of carrots. Turned out very nice.

This was delicious and very simple to make! My husband loved it as well and he is not a big brocolli fan .... the only thing I changed was the frozen brocolli for fresh.

This recipe is GREAT!!  I have to agree with previous reviewer that all Velveeta is not my idea of cheese soup.  While the Velveeta is a must, as it lends to the creamy texture and makes the real cheese not separate, to make a quality cheese soup you have to use real cheese. I used one lb cheddar and half lb velveeta.  I chose mild cheddar but I think sharp would've made it perfect.  I used a medium sized onion and while it didnt degrade the soup in terms of flavor, the family thought it was just too much onion to chew, even diced well.  Overall the recipe is a winner and went into the recipe box.

OMG, how easy and simple can you get if you are looking for a crowd pleaser, this one you can make ahead the day before a party and it will still be wonderful. I tried this recipe and found it super delicous.

this soup is fantastic ... I've been making it for years now ... the only change I make is to use FF 1/2 & 1/2 in place of the milk to give it a creamier consistency.  Be careful ... don't heat too quickly or the cheese will burn and stick to the bottom of the pan ... heat very gently and it won't burn or curdle!

Super yummy and super easy to make!! My husband has been wanting me to make broccoli cheese soup for awhile but I hadn't found a recipe I really liked until this one. Like many of the reviews here, I cut the recipe in half and it was more than enough for dinner last night and dinner tonight (or more!) for the two of us. Great recipe!

This recipe was great! With the exception of my two year old, the whole family loved it. (But he's extremely picky, and I have a hard time getting him to eat anything.) I didn't change any of the ingredients, but I did add some garlic and pepper chicken cut into chunks. Great recipe!

It was really delicious.
The kids loved it and it made enough for our huge family and for my lunch tomorrow. 
Things I changed:
I did one lb. of velveeta and 1/4 of block cheddar. I am a cheese lover but 1 1/2 of cheese sounded like it would over power it.
I did half of a large yellow onion (minced).
I made garlic mash potatoes (from scratch) and put the soup on top. The two made a great texture. 

My brother gave me a 7.5/10 and he doesn't like soups. His request was bacon in it next time.

This was my first attempt at any recipe for broccoli soup and this recipe came out awesome!! Very easy and tasted great! My only caution would be to know what kind of onion you like and it's taste. I used a small onion but it was on the stronger side and it's taste could have been overwhelming had I used anymore. Other than that the recipe is perfect!!!!

Delicious! I made 2/3 the recipe and used only 8 oz velveeta and 2 oz cheddar. Used one package chopped frozen broccoli and one package frozen broccoli florets. Also added one carrot cut into coins and and one large potato cubed. These two items were added to the boiling broth. Seasoned with black pepper, cayenne pepper. Also added crushed garlic into the broth. Used low sodium chicken broth.

This soup is great! My family raved about it. Even my little girl who turned her nose up at the idea of eating broccoli in a soup. I did however add half the cheese and doubled the amount of flour and milk. This recipe was easy and tasted amazing.

Very tasty! I did the 50/50 Valveeta & cheddar mix. A little salty for this family as we don't cook with it. Maybe the next time I'll make it with lower sodium chicken broth. Definitely worth keeping in the recipe box!

absolutely delicious!!! So simple but so good! I omitted the onions because we don't like onions. And I used black pepper instead of white because I didn't have any. I made the rue with the butter & flour & milk & then added slices of processed cheese (about 6-7 slices). Meanwhile I steamed the broccoli in water. When the cheese sauce was thickened I added 4 chicken boullion cubes for flavor. Then I added the broccoli & simmered well. It was so yummy!!!

I followed the recipe exactly and this soup was perfect!!!  It did make quite a bit... perfect for leftovers.

Edited to add: Next time I make this I will probably put 1/2 in large freezer ziplock bag and freeze for later.

This recipe makes a LOT of soup. I halved it and my husband and I were eating it for days. I liked it, kind of too cheesy for my opinion. Next time I make it I will cut down on the cheese.  I also wish the soup mixture was a little thicker, mine came out a little on the watery side.

Yummm, Did 1 8oz bag of Sharp Cheddar and 8 oz Velveeta. Turned out great! I made a roux out of the flour butter and onions, then added the chicken broth to the roux. I also used around 2 #s of velveeta. I used 1 32(oz) bag of frozen broccoli and 1# of fresh broccoli.

I just made this tonight and after reading some of the other reviews I added a few things.............I used fresh broccoli, 2 fresh shredded carrots, 1 can cream of chicken soup, a dash of half/half, and I omitted the flour.  I added fresh baked whole grain french bread slices for dipping...........Yummy!  This would be great as a starter before Thanksgiving or Christmas dinner when everyone is "starving" and waiting for the turkey =)

Very good! I made this tonight for supper. I followed the recipe exactly as written since we all like Velveeta. Make sure to cook the flour and milk mixture until thick before adding to the broccoli (I used all florets). The Velveeta makes it very smooth and creamy. The whole family liked it as well or better than the restaurant soup. I will be making this often.

I made this for my family, I did make a few minor changes, we do not eat onion so I skipped this part but did everything else, made the cream sauce as stated, instead of using all Velveeta I took the suggestions of others and used half Velveeta and half shredded cheddar.  This was a hit with the family,  I think next time I make I will try to use fresh broccoli instead of frozen.

I made two changes - used fresh broccoli (simply because I had it) and did 1/2 velveeta 1/2 shredded cheddar. It was very good - a bit too thin and a bit too salty. I think one can less of chicken broth would solve both those problems. Overall, though, a very tasty soup!

Great recipe! It was just what I was looking for! I'll be adding this to my soup collection for years to come! Also, it says it makes 6 servings, it's more like 12...

I made this recipe using 4 Cans of Cheese Soup and 3 C Grated Medium Cheddar Cheese instead of the processed cheese.  It was AMAZING.  Also note that this makes a TON of soup.  Easily more like 10 servings, not 6.

Fantastic, and SO easy! Of course, I made a few changes. I had a ton of fresh broccoli, so i used that instead of frozen. I also halved the amount of cheese--and it was still cheesily delicious! I also added a stalk of chopped celery with the onion, based on another recipe. Hard to say if it added anything or not.

This is a really good soup!!  I used a lb and half of velveeta and a handful of shredded cheddar.  I cooked it on the stove just like it said then I left in the  crockpot on warm all day long and when I got home it was waiting for me.  My mom took some home with her and she said it was the best broccoli cheese soup she had ever had!  I also didn't use white pepper but regular pepper and lots of it!

This soup is fabulous! I'm eating leftovers for lunch as I type - and it's even better the next day. I did add some minced garlic with the onion and used butter with olive oil & skim milk to cut a few calories. I also used 1 lb of Velveeta and about 3/4 pound of Sharp White Cheddar. I love cheese and Velveeta grosses me out - so I may try it with all 'real' cheese next time, although I am a bit worried about altering the wonderful, thick consistency. I will DEFINITELY make this again - and it really does taste like Panera!

Good basic recipe.  I played with iit and made it into a potato/broccoli (I even steamed up some shredded carrot) and cheese soup.  Used a small brick of 2% Velveeta and 1/2 bag of pre-shredded cheddar cheese.  1 c fat free milk.  1 box of good chicken stock.  Used 1 tsp pureed garlic with the onion and butter.  (Without the cheddar cheese or the garlic...I would not have rated this a 5).  All in all a good starter recipe.  Thanks for posting it!

Great recipe.  I added more of a kick to it then the other reviewers.  I used Mexican Velveeta, a mined garlic clove, used 2 cans of cream of chicken and 2 cups of water instead of broth and a can of cheddar cheese soup.  That gave it the kick we were looking for :0)

This was a great soup! I used fresh broccoli and just simmered it in the broth for about 20-25 minutes. I also only unsed 1lb of velveeta and 1/2lb of cheddar. To give it a slight kick (we like kick in our house) I added some red pepper flakes to the broccoli when I was simmering it.

Holy smokes this was good. I followed the recipe exactly. When reading the recipe I wasn't sure at the beginning if the chicken broth should be hot before I add the broccoli or not. 15 minutes isn't enough to "simmer" frozen broccoli. Do you cover the pot or not? I put the chicken broth and broccoli in the pot and put it on medium heat (my stove knob on number 4 as I was using a large cast iron pot). I didn't simmer the broccoli but cooked until just soft. A bit later when I added the butter/onion/flour/milk mixture to the broccoli and broth the liquid seemed like it was going to be too much. Once I added the cheese it seemed still like I needed more cheese or it would be very watery. I decided to taste test it first before adding more cheese and I'm glad I did as it was perfect! One other comment- I don't buy the chicken broth in a can as it is pretty expensive. I buy the powdered chicken broth/chicken soup base from an Amish grocery store and it works perfectly. I use 1 heaping tablespoon per 2 cups of water. It's only $2.95/lb and I probably get about 40 tablespoons per pound. Thank you for the recipe!

Followed the suggestion to replace some of the Velveeta with real cheddar and it was PERFECTION.  If i had not done that, I think it would have been a 4 star recipe.

YUMMIE! This was worth the effort, not that it took much. I followed some of the other readers and added a 1/2 lb of cheddar instead of all Velveeta. I also added about a handful of chopped carrot.

Very good and super easy.  I wanted an easy soup to make to warm us up and this did the trick.  I used fresh broccoli because that was what I had and added some garlic pepper.  Very good.

This is the best broccoli soup I've ever had; we make it every couple of mths. Our daughter who is now grown and married and living in another state asks for it every time she visits. I send her home with a container-full. The only changes I make in the recipe is to use fresh broccoli, add a small garlic clove and replace one can of chicken stock with condensed cream of celery soup.

Tasty cheesy goodness! I have three large boys (men) sitting in my livingroom watching Olympic hockey and devouring this great soup! I used fresh broccoli and subsituted part of the called for chicken stock with some water to simmer the broccoli in and it worked out just fine. The only addition I would make is garlic to give it some more zip!  Thanks for the great recipe!

I only had 1/4 bag froz. broccoli so I simmered that along with the onion and a stalk of celery in 1 C chicken broth.Then I mixed some flour and milk and poured that in.  It thickened almost immediately.  Then I threw in a can of Campbell's Cream of Broccoli Soup and 1 cup of milk.  Very good!

Wow - this is SOOOOO good!  I never made this type of soup before and it was surprisingly easy and so delicious!  I followed other reviewer's modifications by using 1 lb velveeta and 1/2 lb of real cheddar cheese and added three chopped potatoes.  To make it a little less fattening, I used skim milk and 2% velveeta & 2% cheddar cheese and you'd never know it.  The consistency is perfect and tastes like restaurant quality soup.  Thanks for this recipe!

This soup was easy and quick to make.  I prefer white and yellow cheddar cheese to the Velveeta. I also used fresh broccoli which a par boiled first in the broth. Don't over do on the flour or your soup will get to thick, as soon as it thickens the soup turn the heat way down so this won't happen. I will make this again!

Excellent. Do not put your broccoli in a blender thinking your kids may prefer it without chunks. That, and using Cheddar cheese ruined my first attempt with this recipe. Gave it a strange texture. Used chunkky broccoli and velveeta the 2nd time around, and received rave reviews from the little ones.

Awesome soup, only modified it a little. To make it gluten free I used 2-3 T cornstarch instead of flour. Also added 2 cans of diced potatoes to make it more of a "meal" soup.

This was fantastic! I made it with cheddar cheese simply because i do not like velveeta and it turned out perfect.

My family loves this soup!!  My 9 year-old twin daughters think it's the best broccoli and cheese soup they've ever had!  I did reduce the Velveeta to 3/4 lb and then added 2 C. cheddar.  Yummy!

The only thing I did different was to add some fresh garlic.  This was good but I found myself not really wanting the leftovers.  It's very rich.

Amazing!!!!!  Used fresh instead of frozen broccoli.  Added some cauliflower.  Made chicken broth from Better than Bouillon paste.  Added half pound of cheddar cheese slices in addition to the Velveeta.  Simply AMAZING and very quick/easy to make!

This soup was fantastic!  I wanted to make it a bit healthier, so I doubled the broccoli and cut the cheese in half.  It was still very creamy and cheesy.  Next time, I'm going to try it with skim milk and an extra onion.  Thanks!

It's good but still not quite like the broccoli cheese soup you get out at places like Atlanta bread co.  I used both cedder cheese and velveeta as others suggested .... will mostly likely make this recipe again with a few more tweeks...

Since it is just Chris and I for the evening, we cut this recipe in half. I have to say we were hoping for something more flavorful. It was pretty bland, and it came out more liquidy than we expected. A quick fix is addding more flour. To fix the blandness, we added a lot of salt, pepper and garlic powder. In the future, we know to brown a few garlic cloves with the onions. We paired the soup with grilled ham and cheese sandwiches on fresh ciabatta rolls. Not to shabby for Monday night football for two.

I just made this over the weekend and this is by far the BEST soup ever! Followed the directions but I did 2 cups of milk and 2 cups of half and half. For the cheese and followed others and did half velveeta half sharp cheddar cheese. Perfect combination. I served it in sourdough bread bowls and I will definately be making it again!!

This recipe is amazing! It was thick and creamy. I added 2 pounds of velveeta, and the broccoli to cheese ratio was perfect. Not to mention it was super easy to make!! For sure going to make it again!

Very, very good! I took the advice of others and used only about 4 ounces of velveeta, and probably about 1-1/2 cups of medium cheddar cheese. I also did not use chopped broccoli, I used florets.   This recipe makes a TON of food! It does keep very well in the fridge for leftovers though!   Great soup, great for getting picky kids to eat broccoli. I have made variations of this using broccoli and carrots, and I made asparagus cheese soup too. Very good base recipe. Add your own seasonings to make it how you like it.

Very good recipe. I took advice from others and doubled the cheese and broccoli and used only three cans of chicken broth instead of four and then used the fourth instead of the water with the cornstarch. It took a while to get thick and then it got very thick Fast and I had to add more broth. Very good recipe.

Amazing soup! I never thought it would be so easy to make broccoli cheese soup that taste like it came from a restaurant. I used half cheddar and half velveeta, I also halved the whole recipe.... it still made about 6 servings of soupd.

This soup was delicious!!  I didn't use as quite as much chicken broth, about 2 1/2 cups and cooked the broccoli in that.  I also added a full brick of velveeta, I didn't have any white pepper, so used regular pepper..and it was wonderful...made it for a fall party and everyone loved it!  Will make it again. Thanks

This soup has a terrific broccoli flavor!  I don't care for the over-thick, over-cheesy soup with a few bits of broccoli floating around, so this soup where the cheese complements, but does not overwhelm, was perfect.  I used a bit less flour, but the full amount probably would have been okay.  I made sure that the sauce was fully 'cooked' by bringing to a low boil and then simmering for a bit, before adding to the broccoli.  I didn't have quite enough Velveeta so used nine ounces Velveeta and four ounces pepper jack.  Oh, yeah...and I had ONE potato.  Whaddya gonna do with ONE potato?  So I boiled it, smashed it, and threw it into the soup pot.  I will definately use this recipe again, and the preparation method.  I like celery with broccoli, and potatoes, so will try that next.  And then cauliflower.  (PS:  I buy four-pound bags of broccoli florets at Sam's.  I slightly mashed the broccoli with a potato masher, right in the pan.)

WOW! I did the same thing as some of the others, added half Velveeta and half cheddar. I also used chicken bouillon, garlic powder and some zucchini. Turned out just yummy!

Wow! Used less Velveeta and threw in some heaping handfuls of shredded cheddar and Monterey jack. Also used powdered chicken bouillon instead of broth. I'm a soup person and this is one of the best soups I've ever made in my life. What a keeper! Nephew said it tastes like Outback.

I LOVED this recipe! it was great. i listened to the reviews and added 1/2 Velveeta 1/2 Cheddar. I also decided to add 1/3 more milk just because it was a little to thick for my taste. But it was great. Ill definitely be making this again.

This soup was wonderful. This is the first time I have ever made soup and my husband and I really enjoyed it. I did add a little garlic powder to give a little more flavor. It was wonderful. Thank you so much. I really enjoyed making this recipe.

I have been looking for a smooth and creamy broccoli soup and this is it..It isn't to cheesy.. The first time making this I made it exactly as the recipe calls. The second time making this I chopped up ham from the days before Ham dinner. It was so good.. I will make it both ways many times over. Thank you for sharing..

This recipe was just what I wanted! I did alter it though, using real cheddar cheese and vegetable broth. My husband refuses to eat broccoli so I did make half a batch without broccoli and used 2 jalapeno peppers in it's place..it turned out to be an interesting, spicy yet good soup.

I made this soup for a luncheon and the prasies just came flying in! I altered the recipe a touch and used a previous suggestion to cut the velveeta in half and put some cheddar. I also added some cauliflower. It was absolutely delicious, thank you for sharing this recipe :-)

Delicious with about 1/2 the amount Velveeta cheese substituted with about 2 cups real sharp cheddar cheese.  I also prefer the celery and onion to be cooked in the chicken broth.  I don't like crunchy celery in a broccoli soup. I added grated carrot and some diced potatoes as well.

This was a pretty good soup and very easy to make.  My only complaint was that it was a little too cheesy.  The velveeta cheese seemed to overpower all of the other flavors.

This is the BEST broccoli cheese soup ever! I cook it all the time because it's quick and easy and I've never had anyone tell me that they didn't like it. A word to the wise, though:  DO NOT USE 2 POUNDS OF VELVEETA! Normally I only use 1/4 pound (and I'm a cheese-a-holic!), but I usually buy the 1/2 pound block in case I want a little extra that day. I also recommend adding a little Tony Chachere's seasoning and a little garlic powder at the end. Be careful not to leave it on the burner too long, though, because the cheese will curdle easily.

This recipe had way too much Velveeta for my liking, I decreased that the following time and increased the broccoli by about double since I was using fresh instead of Frozen as the recipe reads. Overall very easy to make and freezes VERY well for quick meals! Thanks!

This was really good. I should have listened about splitting the velveeta with real cheddar, it came out a little too thick but still good.  I also split this recipe and it came out a large amount, I couldn't imagine if I made the whole recipe. Thank goodness for freezers :) I used one package of chopped broccoli and one of whole florets. I like this texture better, I don't think I would have enjoyed it if it was all chopped. I would definitely make this soup again but with some changes.

My family loves this recipe and I now make it regularly. I followed the tips of others and used the same quantity of cheese, but split is 50/50 between Velveeta and cheddar. Also, I increase the volume of chicken broth from 14.5 ounces to 6 cups, otherwise we find it too thick and rich. With these changes, we'd rate this recipe a 5 star.

Wonderful soup, but it makes a WHOLE LOT of soup.  I halved it and still had enough for 6 (and a few people had 2nds.)  Great flavor... I put everything in the crock pot on low after making the flour/butter/milk mixture on the stove.  Mmmm, a great basic broccoli cheese soup.

This was very tasty.  The sauteed onions was a very nice touch.  I did tweek it a little and scale it to 4 extremely generous servings.  I used olive oil instead of butter, I added garlic, as my family loves it.  I also did not have enough Velveeta and I do not care for a lot of it as it's too overpowering.  I used 6 oz of Velveeta, 1 can of Cheese Soup, and 1 healthy cup of shredded cheddar cheese.  It was just right for us.  My 7 & 13 yr old boys gobbled it up.  We love cheese and broccoli.  This recipe would have gotten a 5 star if it did not call for exclusively Velveeta (it's not real cheese).  Otherwise, it now resides in my cookbook as a soup staple.  Very easy easy easy and quick to make.

Made this for the whole family, age range 71-9. Everyone liked it. They requested it again two days later. I substitued cheddar and colby crumbles for 1/3 of the cheese. Will divide it in half for just hubby and me. Thanks for this keeper recipe. Great comfort food.

I used fresh broccoli and made only 2 servings according to this website (although it makes more), and sliced cheese instead of velveeta. I also used a bit of garlic with the onion too, and the soup is tastes GREAT. It's not all that special though, however, it's very easy to make. I'd make it again.

I've tried a couple other recipes, but this one hits it on the head.  I did 1 lb. Velveeta and 1/2 lb. cheddar, used fresh broccoli, and pureed the broth/broccoli before adding to the soup.  Yum!

I thought this was a good/okay recipe, but not the best. I did what another reviewer did and put in half veleeta and half sharp cheddar cheese. It was okay, but still WAY too much veleeta. Followed the recipe otherwise, but it tasted kind of sweet to me, and I cant figure out why... I guess I am still on the hunt for a recipe like Panera Bread's.

This was the best broccoli cheese soup I have had in a long time.  I did what the others suggested and put 1/2 of the velvetta cheese and used cheddar cheese.  I also added some garlic.  My friend came over for lunch and said is was better than any restaurant broccoli soup.  Will be making again

Great Broccoli Cheese soup.  My granddaughters gave it a quick thumbs up.  Doubled the recipe and made as close to the directions as I am able to follow recipes (you know a little more of this or that).  Pureed the broccoli and broth before addiing the onion/flour mixture and it made a beautiful as well as delicious soup.  I sprinkled ground red peppers (not cayanne) on my bowl to add an extra little zip...delicious.  My son took the leftovers to work the next 2 days...guess the soup met his approval also.  Will make again and again.  Thanks Melissamorgan for a delicious, quick and easy soup!!

Very good recipe.  I was out of chicken broth, so I used a packet of knorr vegtable soup mix with the same amount of water the recipe called for, and it was great.  Next time I might not use quite so much cheese.

I did half and half cheddar and velveeta, but other than that, the BEST broccoli cheese soup I have ever had.

Boy did my family love this soup. Just as others...I was trying to find a recipe similar to that of Panera Bread.  This came pretty close.  Because I don't like processed cheese I used cheddar instead.  I purchased a block and cut into cubes. When everything was finally done, it tasted a bit bland to me so I added chicken bullion to the soup.  I have the kind you sprinkle but I would say it's equivilant to 2 cubes. A winner in my home and I will make this many times over.

I tricked my kids into believing this was mac and cheese soup. I added macaroni, a cup of white beans, and sauteed celery and carrots with the onions. It was a complete meal for everyone.

The recipe was okay. Very easy to make if you follow the directions. I cut the recipe in half and still had leftovers. I'm not a big fan of Velveeta so I used half Velveeta and half cheddar.

I followed the recipe exactly, but now wish I had used less Velveeta and used more shredded cheddar.  It does have a distinct Velveeta feel and taste to it, otherwise.  I might just use a half pound of processed cheese next time, and the rest in real cheese.

Very good--my 4 year old requests it!  It makes way too much for our family of 5, so we scale it down or freeze some for a rainy day then just reheat on the stove.  I followed other users advice and used half velvetta and half cheddar, next time I may even go with more cheddar--I'm not a velvetta fan but this was still really good.  I'm after Panara's recipe, but this is pretty close!

This was a 4 star when I made it, but I only used cheddar cheese because I didn't have velveeta on hand.  With the velveeta, it definately would have been 5 stars!  It was still really good with using all cheddar, so if that is all you have, still worth making.  I purreed half of the broccoli before I added it to the roux mixture, but I wish I hadn't. It cooks down so much, that it breaks down already in the sauce when mixed.  So I didn't have any nice big bites of broccoli, it was all kind of a broccoli mush, but still very smooth and tasty.

Everyone liked the soup, but it did taste too much like Velveeta. Next time I will use 1/2 Velveeta and 1/2 Cheddar Cheese.

i gave it 5 stars based on this specific recipe...does not need to be changed to get 5 stars...I tweaked it a little but. I used almond flour instead of regular, I used milk fed butter, and real cheese-not velveeta. I also added carrots, mushrooms and green onions. Trying to make it a little healthier did not take away at all, so good!

This recipe was sooo yummy - with a few tweaks of my own. First, I cut it in half, because there is only 2 of us. Secondly, I added velveeta and grated, sharp cheddar cheese. I left out the onion. And after the broccoli cooked in the broth, I took it out and processed it in the food processor and returned it to the broth (because I don't like big chunks of broccoli). This was such a delicious soup!! Definitely a keeper, and will use it again!

This is a fabulous recipe, very quick and perfect for getting dinner on the table in a hurry.  I didn't have any trouble with the soup thickening, although I allowed the soup to simmer for a few minutes before adding the cheese (I also used cheddar instead of Velveeta).  This one's a keeper!

This soup was GREAT! I only made half a batch because some of the reviews say it makes too much but now I wish I made the full recipe. I substituted half the Velveeta for grated cheddar as I don't like Velveeta that much. I found that it was a little salty which must have been from the broth I used so next time I'll use low sodium chicken broth.

sooo yummy...I used fresh broccoli and chedder cheese (velvetta scares me!) I also used a "box" of chicken stock the soup was to thin so I added 3 handfuls of instant mashed potato it thickened up great. Will keep and make again!

We love this recipe.  Like others, I choose to use a mix of Velveeta and cheddar.  This recipe makes a ton, so I half the recipe.  Probably due to this adjustment, it sometimes turns out a little thin for my taste so I cut back the broth a bit.

I agree with the previous comment.  I would rate this a 5 star if the recipe called for less velveta and some regular cheddar cheese cubes to substitute.  I, personally don't care for broccoli stems, so I purchased the broccoli florets instead of having to chop all of the stems off myself.  I also pureed the florets.  I love these substitutes with this recipe and will continue to use it.

I am giving this 4 stars because I think it has the potential to be 5 stars. It needs a little more flavor. I added a little chicken bouillion. I think it could be a tad bit thicker too. But all in all it was good. I would make again

Great recipe. My husband found this easy enough to make alone. He isn't much of a cook. He added some fresh cauliflower that we had leftover in the fridge. And we didn't have fresh onion so he used dried, which worked fine.

This is the best soup ever! I add a family size package of Grandma's noodles in the chicken broth and cooked them half way then added the broccoli. The noodles plump up and add a new dimenstion to the soup. Very hearty. At times I have also added some roasted chicken pieces for perfect meal after a long day of skiing.

I followed advice in another review and cut the velveeta in half and added 1lb cheddar.  Can't wait to serve for lunch tomorrow!  I also substituted corn starch for flour since my BF is gluten intolerant.  Will make again.

I tried this recipe last night, and I found it super easy to make.  I read the reviews and did use less velvetta and some cheddar cheese, but I still found this to be too cheesy.  I am hoping leftovers will taste better.  I did use fresh broccoli and just cook it for 20 minutes to soften it up more.  I think next time I use this recipe I will use less cheese.  
This would be five-star if it wasn't so cheesy.  If you are new to cooking this is an easy recipe to try.

Great soup!  Followed the recipe, the only change that I made was to use 1 lb. velvetta and 1/2 - 3/4 cup of cheddar instead of the 1 1/2 lbs. velvetta.  It was actually a shredded cheese blend (Wal-Mart brand).  I could not find boxes of broccoli at the store so I used 3 bags of broccoli florets.

I will definitely add this to my recipe collection.  It's perfect on a cold winter evening.

I used corn starch - sauteed a few cloves of garlic with the onions - halved with cheddar - AND JUST ENJOYED THE HECK OUT OF IT!!! Next time I'm going to try a bit of cream cheese.

The soup was too thin, and I already used less chicken broth.  I could only have a little at a time....something about the taste wasn't quite right, It may have been because of the processed cheese.  Was fun to try, but won't make it again.

This recipe is AWESOME. It is very easy and quick. I halved the amount of onion needed, and it was still almost too much, but very flavorful. The recipe makes a ton... probably enough for 12 or so... so cut it down if needed. I didn't change too much else, but added just a little bit of red pepper when making the roux to give it a bit more snap. I didn't boil the broccoli seperately, so this was a 1-pot dish for me... I did thaw the broccoli in the microwave a little first, though. It's a keeper!

I scaled this down to two servings and it made plenty. I did not have a regular onion so I used a few stalks of green onion. I added a dollop of cream cheese and a couple shakes of celery salt. Will make this again!!! YUMMY!

This is the tastiest soup I've tried. I've tried several other recipes and this one I find has the best and cheesiest taste (and I'm a cheese fiend). I was very impressed by the soup base (made with flour, onions, milk)..I may try doing this in my other cheese based soups. Instead of flour I used corn starch since it's easier for me to handle. Next time I may try using evaporated milk instead of the regular milk since I don't have much regular milk on hand. 

This is truly a winner and a big hit with my friends as well!

10 stars!  I made this for dinner on Friday (day after Thanksgiving) alongside turkey sandwiches.  I added my leftover scalloped potatoes that also had Velveeta cheese in it.  I received compliments from the whole family!

Oh my gosh, this soup is amazing.  It is so delicious and it was really easy to make!  I used the Velveeta with the 2% milk and skim milk to make it lower fat.  I love it!

I searched many recipes before deciding on this one. Wow it is better than any I have  had in any restuarant. It is very easy and makes a large pot. I did use 1 pound velveeta and 1/2 pound chedder as many suggested. It was wonderful. My whole family loved it.I served it in bread bowls , but I think it would be wonderful alone. If anyone is looking for a GREAT recipe try this one. You won't be disappointed.

It was very good, all I did was add garlic to my onions, and decreased the flour used. I also used half velvetta and half sharp cheddar cheese. I even froze some.

Great recipe. Easy to make, big hit with the family.  I served it in bread bowls and my kids loved it!  This recipe is definitely a keeper.  Thanks.

Very good, except i thought the flour made it too thick. I made a few changes to it, i added some thinly sliced carrots, some scallions, and instead of the garlic powder i used to cloves of garlic crushed, i also did half velveeta and 1/2 mild cheddar, added some spices to the veggies when cooking and added once cup of milk and a cup of water.
Next time i don't think i will add the flour to it at all and i might use chicken broth instead of water.

THIS WAS REALLY GREAT!  EASY TO MAKE.  I ADDED REAL BACON BITS, ABOUT 1/4C. THAT GAVE IT ALITTLE EXTRA SOMETHING.  I'M GOING TO TRY SOME MUSHROOMS NEXT TIME!  THINK THAT WILL MAKE IT GREAT ALSO.  TRY IT, IT'S A HIT!!

This recipe is fantastic for a first-timer making Broccoli Cheese soup. I made a few variations to the recipe and it came out great! I used fresh broccoli and cut the florets (broccoli was more fresh that way), 2 cans chicken broth and 1 can of water (less sodium), 3/4 of an onion, skim milk (less fat),  1/4 pounds of Velveeta and omitted the ground white pepper. I served it with fresh baked French bread.

YUMMY!! I lost my cheese soup recipe and used this in place... I'm very happy with the final product. I used a head of fresh broccoli as well as some cauliflower that I had on hand. Used a lb of velveeta (because that's all I had) added a handful of sharp cheddar. Used real butter and skim milk also because that's what I had on hand. I think you could even add more veggies to "hide" them from the kids... some grated carrots for example. This did make more like 10 servings which is what others have said but that's fine with us, we'll have leftovers LOL!

I thought this recipe was great!  Was easy to make.  First attempt at making soup and my husband loved it.  I did change the spices to fit my taste, but otherwise it worked perfectly.  It does make quite a few servings, which is fine because I wanted some to freeze.

This was very good soup.  I've honestly had better at one of my favorite restaurants, but this came pretty close.
I changed a few things.  First, I used half of the Velveeta the recipe originally called for and substituted the rest with shredded cheddar cheese.  Secondly, I followed the suggestion of another reviewer and added a clove of garlic to the onions, which I think greatly improved the flavor.  The last change I made, I hope nobody else does: I used vanilla flavored rice milk in the recipe, thinking the vanilla would not affect the taste.  Unfortunately, it came through.  You can use rice milk but make sure it is not flavored.  It didn't ruin the soup but it would have been better without it.  
If you love broccoli cheese soup, do try this recipe!  It may take some tweaking depending on your personal preferences but you won't be disappointed.

Fantastic recipe.  However the serving size is rather large.  Cooking for two I found even cutting the recipe down was alot.  It worked out.  The soup tastes great reheated as well and works for a nice lunch at work.

This is an incredible recipe! Tonight will be my 3rd time making it, and it turns out wonderful every time! Last time, I doubled the recipe, but only used a 2 lb. block of cheese. It was still delicious. If it needs to be stretched, you can add milk without diluting the richness of it. This will be a regular favorite for our family.

It was okay except it wasn't creamy enough for me.  I think it may have been the cheese.  I'll use Velveeta next time.

I loved it!  The velveeta really melts smooth and creamy, unlike some cheeses I've used.  I cut back a little on broccoli, but the original recipe amount is probably perfect.  Thanks!

This is an excellent as well as very easy soup recipe.  My daughter loves it.  The only change that I made was to add cooked elbow macaroni.  My sister-in-law does this with her Broccoli cheese Soup and it is a nice addition.  Thanks!

Very, very good!  I did reduce the flour portion to 1/4 cup and the cheese.  Even reducing the cheese it was still on the cheesey side, but very good! I would go slow on the cheese until you find the mix that works for you.  Going to pick up a load at Panera for some dipping!

This was a very good Broccoli and Cheese soup. Even my picky six year old ate it. I used shredded sharp cheddar instead of the processed cheese food. It was delicious!

Frozen veggies and plastic cheese are no-nos in our house, so I made this with fresh broc, and a combination of extra-sharp Cheddar and Swiss. Because I prefer a smoother soup consistency, I used a hand blender to whizz it up. Absolutely delicious, and WAY better than BC soups I've had from restaurants. Thanks, Melissa!
