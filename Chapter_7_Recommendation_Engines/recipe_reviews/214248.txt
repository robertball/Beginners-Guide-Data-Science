I loved this recipe so much I've been trying different things with the batter. I just used apples instead of the berries, and cinnamon instead of the lemon zest, and did a fourth a cup of white sugar and a fourth a cup of brown sugar. They tast so good. I cooked down the two apples first so they were a little soft before adding them in. It's great with the berries too really good recipe thanks :]
