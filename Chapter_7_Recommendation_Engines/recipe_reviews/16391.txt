Awesome, with a few minor adjustments I made. Instead of using an onion soup mix, I sauteed 1/2 chopped onion and 1/2 chopped pepper in some butter for about 15 minutes. Then I mixed with the rest of the ingredients. I only used about 1/2 cup of lite sour cream. It turned out absoultely delicious! I'm not usually one for meatloaf since it tends to turn out dry & crumbly, too salty or too greasy and most have a ketchup topping to make it appear moist(not a fave). But this recipe was a great basis for a moist and hearty loaf, and with the alterations I made it is definitely a keeper!

Made this last night and it was yummy!  Used other's suggestions and put in 1/2 c. sour cream, and 1/2 c. ranch dressing.  Also, I only used 3/4 c. of bread crumbs, and 1/2 pkg. of the soup mix, added a splash of A-1 and Tabasco.  Served with mashed potaoes and fresh corn off the cob.  Will definitely make this one again!

This is a really good recipe!  Meatloaf has never been a favorite of mine, but this is delicious.
I added a few touches that my mom always used when she made meatloaf.....I sliced 4-5 potatoes into 1/4" rounds and layered them around the meatloaf, and then poured a can of tomato sauce over the whole thing before covering in foil and baking.

My family LOVES this recipe!!  It's a great come home, whip it together, clean up while it's baking and great leftover recipe!  I usually use 1/2 cup sour cream and 1/2 cup ranch dressing.  I put a glaze of ketchup, brown sugar, minced garlic and a dash of mustard on top.  Makes great sandwiches as leftovers too!!  Wonderful recipe.  Thanks Lindsay!

Very quick and easy to make.  I used fat free ranch dressing and found to result to be OK, but not fantastic.

I really enjoyed this recipe!  I used Lipton's vegetable soup mix instead of the onion mix and made a glaze of dry mustard, ketchup and sugar!  We will definately have this meatloaf again!

This was very good. I only used 1/2 the onion packet and it was still almost too much onion flavor. Taste great the next day!

This was good just not great. I followed the recipe but made it ahead and froze it. Just popped it in the oven and cooked last night.

Let me preface by saying that I HATE MEATLOAF and refuse to eat it, but make it about once a month to please my husband and kids.  Now after sayng that, this was the best meatloaf ever!  I actually ate an entire slice and went back for seconds!  My husband and kids love the flavor and have requested I replace my old recipe with this one.  I doubled the recipe, except for the sour cream and onion soup mix...used the quantities call for in the original recipe since other reviews commented that those two ingredients needed to be cut in half.  Also, I added about a 2 Tbsp of Heinz 57, a Tbsp of Dijon mustard and about 1/4 cup of beef broth.  It's a keeper!

We LOVED this meatloaf!   Based on recommendations, I used 1/2 cup of sour cream, 1 cup bread crumbs, and peppers and onions instead of onion soup mix.  Also put a ketchup and  brown sugar glaze on top. Came out fantastic!!

Yay!  I found it!  I've tried some different recipes for meatloaf, played around with my own ideas, and while I've made some good ones, I've never felt like I found 'The Meatloaf,' until now.  It must be the sour cream, b/c I've tried ones w/ the other ingredients, but this is going to be my meatloaf recipe from now on.  I followed the exact recipe, except I topped it with a ketchup and brown sugar glaze that I got from another recipe on this site.  Yummy and thank you!!!

Prepared the loaf just as recipe calls for - no adjustments, and it turned out excellent. My husband nearly hates anything too out of the ordinary and this is a fine, traditional meatloaf recipe with just the right "extras" for me.  For the two of us, it's the best traditional meatloaf I ever ate.

I'm new to making meatloaf but this was pretty simple to follow. Tasted good but the texture was odd; probably something I did as opposed to the recipe.

WOW!  I've made many meatloaf recipes before, and many that involve much more work than this one, but certainly none better than this!!!  I made it just as the recipe called for the first time (although I only used 1/2 cup sour cream) and it was DELICIOUS!!!!  I look forward to making it again, this time using sauteed onions and some ranch dressing as others have suggested just to see if you CAN improve on this recipe.  Make it, you won't be sorry!!

I have tried several different meatloaf recipes and my kids never liked any of them.  Finally found one in this recipe.  This is a huge hit at my house.

I've never made meatloaf before and decided to make this for my wife tonight.  The meatloaf was excellent.  The only thing that confused me was that it didn't call for ketchup.  Every meatloaf I've eaten was cooked with ketchup on top.

I was afraid that it would come out too dry because of the crumbs and onion mix, but the consistency came out well.

Also, the recipe made about 6 servings rather than 12 servings.  But, I'll have to say that this is my new meatloaf recipe to use.

This turned out fantastic! I did make some changes so heres what I did
I used 1/2 cup of sour cream and 1/2 cup of ranch dressing. I used crackers and toast instead of the italian-style bread crumbs, and I put a glaze on top 45 minutes into baking made of 1/4cup of ketchup 1 tbs of mustard and 2tbs of brown sugar 

I didnt have tinfoil so I didnt cover it and it was still moist and perfect.

I have no complaints with this receipe it was very delicious!

The texture was great with the sour cream, but it wasn't very flavorful.  Next time I will use additional seasonings.

This was a very good meatloaf.  I used panko and Italian seasoning, since I didn't have seasoned bread crumbs, and 2 lbs. of 90% lean ground beef.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly.  We did squeeze on some ketchup, once it was done, but I also think it would be yummy with brown gravy.  If I make this with 2 lbs. of meat again, I will cook it at least 1 1/2 hrs.  It has a very nice texture, and it slices well.  Thanks for the recipe!

My family really enjoyed this recipe. I picked it because I had most of the ingredients.  I only had 1 cup of Italian bread crumbs and a 1/2 pkg of leftover onion soup mix, so that's all I used. Didn't have Worcestershire sauce either, so I used a couple Tbsps of Steak Sauce.  It really came out great--very moist and delicious!

This is awesome. I've always made meatloaf with all of these ingrediants EXCEPT the sourcream and that has been what was missing all these years! It must soak up or neutralize all of the grease you normallly get from meatloaf. It was so moist and it held together wonderfully

It was good, but I wasn't too excited about texture the sour cream gave it. Overall it was very good though. I added both onion soup mix and cooked onions.

I was afraid of the sour cream, but now this is my go to recipe.  I make this meatloaf all of the time and it is delicious.  I don't even need the recipe anymore, I can just eyeball it and it always turns out fabulous.  I've made it into meatballs, or use turkey when I'm feeling "healthy".  Try it, you will not be sorry.

I like my regular meatloaf recipe, but wanted to try something different. I read the other reviews and so decided to tweak this just a little. I had about 1 1/4 lbs of ground beef, so other than the egg, used slightly less than the full measures of the other ingredients. And because some said the whole envelope of soup made it too salty, I first mixed the dry soup with a pint of sour cream and made onion dip. I then used slightly less than a cup of the dip in place of the sour cream and the envelope of soup. I also made a ketchup, mustard and brown sugar topping - just kind of guessing at the amount of each. The result was really tasty. Will definitely make this again.

It was a tasty meatloaf! I didn't use the soup mix but instead opted for sauteed onion (1 small), 1/4 red pepper and 2 cloves of garlic. Just a tiny bit on the drier side but my 2 year old toddler loved it.

I was skeptical when I read the sour cream ingredient but I have to say this turned out delicious and my whole family ate it.  My husband really liked it.  The only change I made was I topped ours near the end of baking with 2 slices of Muenster cheese, yummy.

This was absolutely delicious!! I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of using 2 lbs of beef instead of 1 1/2. I noticed some other reviewers recommended using less soup mix and less sour cream, but I used all of it and it was great! This recipe is definitely a keeper. Thanks for the great recipe Lindsay :)

I have made this meatloaf quite a few times now, and consistently get a great response.  Even fed it to some of my son's friends who ate it with gusto, to have their moms call me the next day, asking how I make my meatloaf because their sons were telling them how great it was!  My husband, who has preferred his mother's to my meatloaf for the better part of 20 years, finally loves my meatloaf!!!  I couldn't thank you more!  ***PLEASE NOTE:***  I followed another reviewer's suggestion, and used ranch DIP instead of sour cream.  WOW!  Those flavors just all make one incredible meatloaf!  We rarely have leftovers when I make this, but when we do, it makes a fantastic sandwich, too!  Yummo!

Couldn't be better - I have a recipe from my mom that I'd been making, but my husband and I got burned out with that.  After a meatloaf hiatus, I found this and decided to make it tonight.  It was super easy to put together, and like the other reviewers used 1/2 cup of ranch and 1/2 cup of light sour cream.  I also found that Lipton dry onion soup mix, makes a "beefy onion soup mix" and I used that.  It was great ~ not dry or bland, just right.  My husband has never really been a fan of meatloaf and he cleaned his plate!  This will be a keeper.

This is by far my favorite meatloaf recipe. Actually, it's the only one I'll use now. After reading some of the reviews I decided to make this with 1/2 cup sour cream, and 1/2 cup of ranch dressing. Amazing!!  As my oldest son and my husband say "it's a keeper"

This is FANTASTIC!!  I needed comfort food for a friend, and boy, did I find it!  I followed a few previous suggestions - 1/2 cup sour cream, 1/2 cup ranch dsg, omit soup mix, added 1/2 sauted onion, and used 3/4 breadcrumbs.

And after the 45 minutes covered, I drained it, and put the glaze of 1/2 cup ketchup, 1/2 cup brown sugar, and dash of mustard, and finished cooking for 15 minutes.  I am making it again right now!

Thank you for a wonderful recipe!

This is the best meatloaf I've ever had.  It breaks all the traditional rules for meatloaf.  I love that you don't need anything like ketchup for this dish.

This is the BEST meatloaf ever! My boyfriend comments every time I make it, says it's the best he's EVER had, always goes back for seconds, sometimes not much left for sandwiches the next day. I made a few changes, I only added 1/2 c sour cream and 1 cup Italian-style bread crumbs, also added some garlic powder & Italian seasoning. For the top I combined 1/2 C chili sauce, 1/4 c brown sugar a squeeze of lemon and a dash of mustard powder, pour on top the last 15 mins of baking. Yummy!

Loved it! I've had a hard time finding a recipe for meatloaf that I like but this is it. I didn't really alter the main ingredients very much but I added 1/3 cup of uncooked instant rice and used only 1/2 cup of bread crumbs. I also topped it off with a ketchup & brownsugar mixture.
We've made this twice in the past 3 weeks. Everyone loved it.

I ate this meatloaf for meals in a row (lunch AND dinner) it was so good. I made my own glaze for the top, ketchup, A1 and sugar and it was great. This is definitely a keeper in the recipe box. The leftovers are just as good. Best meatloaf I've ever eaten.

This recipe is good and different from most meatloaves I have made.  The only thing I changed was that I replaced the Parm. cheese with cubed marble cheese.  My husband and kids all enjoyed this one which is amazing!  The only thing I would change the next time I make this, is to cut the bread crumbs back to 1 C.  Enjoy!

Yum!!! Definately a keeper!!!  I made a 2 1/2 lb loaf and used 1 cup sour cream, 1/2 cup ranch as well as increased the worcestershire sauce and added an extra egg. Came out super moist, and firm! No crumbly loaf  for me!!! Also topped with a brown sugar ketchup glaze.  Dee-Lish!!!

This recipe is great.  The only change that I made (which everyone seems to LOVE) is that I subbed out the sour cream for Yoders French Onion Dip.  I make the glaze out of ketchup, honey, soy sauce and it turns out great.  I also let it cook for 60 minutes instead of 45 so that the meatloaf is a little more firm when serving.

This was my first meatloaf ever. The husband and kids are picky so I was worried! I didn't have worcestersire sause so I used mojo sauce instead(i had to add something cuban). Instead of soup mix I used cooked onions and garlic and added seasoning, reduced the sour cream. We all loved it and it was so easy to make :)

It was moist and easy to slice but way too much onion soup mix in it. I'd make it again but skip the onion soup mix and just add fresh minced onion.

Only giving this 4 stars because we don't really love meatloaf in my house.  However, I'm 6 months pregnant and had this insane maternal instinct to learn how to make a meatloaf!  Every mother has to know!  My husband and I actually really enjoyed this.  I added 2 tbsp of soy sauce and I also topped it with ketchup and brown sugar.  Just make sure to mix it really well to distribute the sour cream perfectly.  This wont be made all the time..but it is a nice change from our usualy staple dinners!  Thanks for the recipe!

I really like how the sour cream gave this a great texture.  I used 1/2c. sour cream, and 1/2c. salsa, and an envelope of taco seasoning instead of the onion soup mix.  I also made a ketchup/spicy mustard/brown sugar glaze on top.  Very good.

This was very good... whoe family loved it and it's so easy.  As other reviewwers suggested, I only used 1/2 of onion soup mix (my kids don't like onions so I didn't want it to overpower) and I added a ketchup/brown sugan glaze to the top.  Will become a regular at my dinner table.

I used +1 tablespoon of Worcestershire sauce and I sauteed the onions instead of using soup mix.  It was a big hit with the family.  Next time I'm going to add an additional tablespoon of Worcestershire, because we like the kick.

Definitely not my favorite.  It only got 3 stars because my husband and son ate it without complaint.  No rave reviews from them, but I'll take no complaining.  I followed the recipe exactly, and ended up with my first meatloaf that could be described as a "brick".  It was dense and heavy, and the flavor was disappointing.  On the plus side, it made decent sandwiches the next day when I sliced and fried it.

The meatloaf had an incredible flavor but... it was way too mushy.  Even though I know the meat was cooked through it seemed undone due to the overly mushy texture.  Next time I will either use less sour cream or none at all.  I did add 2/3 cup ketchup, 1/4 cup brown sugar, & 1.5 tsp of prepared mustard (from the Mini Meatloaves recipe here) as a topping.  To me meatloaf isn't meatloaf without a ketchup topping :o)

YUM!! This is wonderful! I used half the sour cream and 1 cup of breadcrumbs. The last 15 minutes, I topped it with a mixture of: 1/4 cup ketchup  2 tablespoons brown sugar  1 teaspoon dijon mustard  1/2 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce  This makes yummy sandwiches the next day too...Thanks so much for the recipe!

This was a very tasty meatloaf.  My changes were ground turkey instead of ground beef.  I also only added 1/2 pack of the onion mix because I added 1/2 french fried onion rings instead. I also added some ketchup/brown sugar mix on top of the meatloaf the last 15 minutes of cooking.  My kids liked it and will make again.

I make this at least once a month for my family, they love it!! The only thing I change is instead of the onion dry soup package, I use a ranch dry dip package. The best meatloaf ever!

Excellent flavor and texture.  I was so hungry for a good meatloaf and saw a positive review for this one.  I used 2 lbs of very lean ground beef and still only 1/2 a packet of the onion soup mix.  Otherwise, upped the other ingredients as written.  I can't believe there was not any salt or pepper but it's still full of flavor.  The sour cream is not noticeable but gives it the perfect texture for slicing thin for sandwiches, which is our favored way of eating meatloaf.  I baked the 2 lbs for 45 minutes covered, uncovered for 15 minutes and then topped with some squirts of ketchup for another 15 minutes.  Perfectly done and very delicious.  Thanks so much for posting your recipe!

I tried this recipe for the first time tonight.  I loved it.  It was nice, and moist, and flavorful.  I will increase the cooking time just abit the next time as it wasn't quite done in the middle but, it's my favorite meatloaf recipe so far.  Thank you!

I made this last night for my neighbor and his 'non liking meatloaf' girlfriend with a couple of changes, Needless to say they both loved and he took the leftovers for lunch, I didn't use the packaged onion mix I used Mrs. Dash Onion & Herb and I only 1C of the Italian bread crumbs added in 1C of graded cheddar cheese, Other then that I followed as written and I make again soon…

Way too many bread crumbs!  This is meatloaf, not meaty mush!  Also was entirely too salty, but this could have been attributed to the use of a greek yogurt veggie dip in lieu of the sour cream.  IF i make it again, I will cut the bread crumbs in half and either use unseasoned breadcrumbs or just use plain sour cream/greek yogurt.

The flavor was okay; my family and myself didn't think the flavor was excellent. I did like however that the meatloaf "held" together and didn't fall apart which makes it good for leftover sandwiches. We just added lots of BBQ sauce to the top to add additional flavor.

We really liked this meatloaf; great flavor, easy to use ingredients.  Great hot out of the oven and cold on a sandwich.  I didn't have Italian-style bread crumbs so added Italian seasoning to my plain ones.

I made this exactly as the recipe says- and it was SO good. Everyone loved it! It was very easy to make. I served it with corn on the cob, mac and cheese and potatoes. It was like a mini feast with very little effort! Definitely will make again.

I made this recipe for my husband and another couple and they absolutely loved it. I enjoyed it as well. My husband makes an amazing meatloaf dish and he thinks this surpasses his. I followed the recipe as is and I was really impressed with how it came out. I will be making this recipe again for sure.

I have made this recipe several times and it has always been great, but tonight I changed it up a bit, and it was even better.  

I used half ground beef and half ground pork this time.  

Also, I realized too late that I had completely forgotten to add the Parmesan cheese, but it didn't matter.  

The final product was the best meatloaf I have ever made, and quite possibly the best I have ever tasted.

Lovely recipe, it's the first time I've ever had meat loaf and my family really enjoyed it. Thanks!  I used crème fraiche instead of cream and added dry garlic flakes with extra herbs to the bread crumbs.

Fantastic meatloaf. My family of very picky eaters loved it! Only modification I made was adding ketchup to the top . Come on, it's meatloaf! You've got to have ketchup on the top! Delish!

I was a little hesitant about making this with the sour cream. Mixed up this morning, only had 1.27 lbs of ground beef and had to use 1 cup of Panko and 1/2 cup Itailian bread crumbs and put it in the frig. until tonight. I sprayed an 11x7 pan with Pam and as I was pressing the meatloaf in I thought this would turn out terribly dry. Then I forgot to cover it because I have never covered a meatloaf when baking, so I put a couple of tablespoons of spagetti sauce on top. Baked at 350 because I also was baking brown rice. It was fantastic, great flavor. Will definitely be making this again.

I followed the recipe as stated because it was my first time trying it and I don't like to "tweak" a recipe until I taste it. I have to agree that it was a bit too salty for my familie's taste. I believe it to be the combination of the parm cheese and the onion soup mix, both being salty.....I will make again but will use REAL onion and omit the  soup all together. I will also add some grated carrot for some sweetness.

I made this recipe last night and the only changes I made were, instead of using W.sauce, I used 2 tablespoons soy sauce, as its all I had on hand and I accidently added a extra 1/2 cup parm. cheeses and used brown sugar barbque sauce as a glaze for last 5 minutes of baking. My family doesn't care for meatloaf but my husband insisted we try this recipe as it sounded good, well, I listened and did as I just said to the recipe and it was  just wonderful, it sliced so well, never fell apart as  some mixtures will, and the flavor was so good. I will make this the regular way  next time but it sure turned out excellent the way I made it this time. My husband says we'll use this recipe again but make the mixture into mini loaves and burgers next time. Thanks for sharing this with everyone!  For anyone who finds this recipe, trust me, make it for your family, you'll never regret it!!!!!!

This was my first attempt at meatloaf after never having eaten it so I don't have any basis for comparison but I have to say that this meatloaf is awesome!!!! 

I used ground turkey instead of ground beef and nothing was lacking. My boyfriend, my coworker, her husband and my roommate couldn't get enough and neither could I. They said it was better than their mom's! It was moist and had tons of flavor. We had no leftovers, but my coworker took the recipe home and 
said that it's also amazing cold. She said it made great sandwiches the next day.

This has been my go-to recipe for over a year now. My only suggestion would be to only add half the packet of the onion soup mix instead of the whole one. I used the whole one the first time I made it and it was WAY too salty.

Awesome! I have been searching for a great meatloaf recipe and my search nds here! I had to try it, given it's unique ingredients and it was AMAZING! It was a tadd salty so next time I will cut back on the worsceshire and the onion soup mix. But other than that, it's a keeper! I did not use the parm and didn't miss it.

I'n not a meatloaf fan, but I liked this one! Didn't have dry onion soup mix so I just sauteed some onion and threw it in. Added some extra salt to make up for the salt I lost from the soup. I also didn't have an hour for baking so I used a muffin pan like I saw on one of the other recipes and they were done in no time and still very moist. I will make this again.

Husband and kids thought this was very good.  I don't really like meatloaf so it's hard for me to personally judge, however, it was definately better than most meatloaves I have tasted and had a good texture. My slight changes: added ground pork, 1/2 pack of ranch dressing mix (based on users who added ranch dressing) and I used plain bread crumbs because that's all I had.   I did also put ketchup on top toward the end (more for appearance) and served with mashed potatoes and beef/tomato gravy.  It smelled wonderful while it was in the oven.  The cook time/temp were perfect, but I don't think 12 servings is accurate...that's only 1.5 ounces of beef per person.   Good recipe!

I made this for a couple of non-meatloaf believers and it was so delicious, they were converted!! I did tweak the recipe a little like a few others did, I used 1/2 cup sour cream and 1/2 cup ranch. I also made a glaze of ketchup, brown sugar, and minced garlic. I couldn't find italian breadcrumbs at the supermarket for the LIFE of me, so I ended up crushing some crutons, and it worked just fine. SUPER DELICIOUS!!!

I made this tonight.  I was looking through old recipes I had saved and forgot all about this one.  My husband had banned me from making meatloaf because I was so bad at it.  But I decided to try this one and he loved it.  He said "as long as you are making your meatloaf like this, you can make meatloaf all the time."

Wow moist! We opted to use sauteed onions and bell pepper in butter instead of the onion soup mix. Otherwise we followed it as written. We really enjoyed this and ketchup was not necessary.

Delicious. I like onion so I used the full packet of onion soup mix + 3/4 of a large onion.  This made me glad I have a lot of frozen beef on hand. I like the idea of varying it with the ranch or vegetable soup mix.

I made this for dinner last night using ground sirloin.  I used 1/2 lite Ranch and 1/2 light sour cream as suggested.  Also substituted Panko Bread Crumbs (that's all I had on hand) and A-1 Steak Sauce instead of Worcestershire.  It was perfectly moist and had a great texture.  Can't wait for a meat loaf sandwich for lunch!

I love meatloaf and I am always looking for the best recipe and I think I have found it with Eileen's Meatloaf.I used plain bread crumbs. and used  1 teaspoon Italian seasoning bake it till the internal temperture is 160 to 180 and it will not fall a part. also if you have left over slice it 1/2 inch thick put tomato sauce on top and sprinkle mozzarela cheese on top and bake it at 375 till the cheese melts hamburg parmesan, try it you will love it

Sensationally moist, and terrifically flavorful despite not having a glaze. Very impressed!  What I would like to try next time is this recipe topped with the glaze from the Tantalizingly Tangy Meatloaf which I consider the best meatloaf recipe on this site because of that sauce (Worcestshire, ketchup, brown sugar, pineapple preserves). Between this recipe for the meat and that glaze, I think we'll have an undisputed winner...

This was very good.  I used a french onion dip instead of sour cream.  You could taste that in the meatloaf, so next time I will use sour cream.  This is a keeper.

This was okay.  I hesitated making it because I am not a huge sour cream fan.  I did not have the onion soup pkg, but subbed accordingly.  My h liked it and the kids did too.  I felt like it needed something. I added tomato sauce and chili sauce for the last 15 mins.  I would try again with some tweaks.

Perfect meatloaf.  I only used about 1/4 cup of breadcrumbs, and 1/4 cup of grated locatelli parmesano/reggiono cheese. It was very good.

I normally hate meat loaf and only make it because my husband likes it, it's easy and it's cheap! That said, I LOVED this meat loaf!! (oh hubby did too). I poured about 1/4 cup of brown beef gravy over the meat loaf before putting it in the oven and then another 1/4 cup when I took the tin foil cover off. The gravy that didn't get sucked into the loaf sat on the bottom for the loaf to soak in...delicious!!! And even better cold the next day! I will definitely be making this again and again!

We love this meatloaf!  I used Hidden Valley Ranch dip that I needed to use in place of the plain sour cream and only a tablespoon of the onion soup mix. I was worried that the amount of breadcrumbs would really dry it out but it turned out firm and really moist, not falling apart as has been my experience with some meatloaf recipes in the past.  I can't wait to eat the leftovers for lunch today!  My husband went back for seconds and even my 1 year old ate it!  We will be having this again and again.

This was so easy and tasty---I prepared it in the morning and baked it at night for comapny and everyone raved about how delicious it tasted.  I formed it in the loaf pan but turned it out and baked it in a 13x9" pan.  It held its shape and made a nice presentation.

Very tasty, moist meatloaf. Did need to increase the baking time by about 15-20 minutes. Will definately make this one again!

Gotta tell you my husband is no meatloaf lover.  I whipped this one up in no time, using your suggestion to substitute ranch dressing for the sour cream, added some cayenne pepper for a little punch and served to one very skeptical man.
He loved it!  The kids loved it and I had my very favorite dish the next day, a cold meatloaf sandwich...yum.

Scaled down to 1/2 the portion size,used half non fat sour cream/half nf ranch dressing, and used plain bread crumbs w/Italian seasoning, but otherwise stayed true to original recipe.  LOVED the blend of flavors... much more ZIP than plain old meatloaf!!  Added my "special zip" glaze of 1/4 cup ketchup, 1/4 cup cocktail sauce over uncovered loaf for the last 15 minutes... Mmmmm!!

I've tried many meatloaf recipes and wasn't satisfied with any of them, until I found this one. Delicious! I use all of the ingredients as is and top with a mixture of 1/2 c. ketchup and 1/2 c. brown sugar before putting it back in the oven uncovered. Also, the leftovers make extremely tasty meatloaf sandwiches for the following day!

This has some real good flavor.. I did change it a bit. I added 1/2 teaspoon black pepper, 1 tablespoon minced garlic and omitted the Worcestershire sauce. I also made a paste with a small can tomato paste and 1/2 small can of tomato sauce for the top.

Never have been a fan of the sweet ketchup/tomato kind of meatloaf.  The flavors in this recipe better suit my family's tastebuds.  Tried it with ranch instead of sour cream and we all loved it!

Excellent! Followed others and added some ketchup to the top during the last 15 minutes of cooking also did not put in a loaf pan, just shaped it in a baking dish, otherwise followed the recipe exactly. One of the better meatloaves that I have made/eaten...a definite keeper, for sure! Thanks for sharing. :)

At 9 months pregnant, I was looking for easy recipes to make and freeze.  We're naming our daughter Eileen, so this was a no brainer.  I followed the recipe but only used ground turkey (I don't eat beef).  It is FABULOUS!  Anyone that thinks this meatloaf is bland has no taste buds!  This will be my go to meatloaf recipe!

I was looking for something different in a meatloaf.  I'm tired of the ketchup/chili sauce type.  This fit the bill perfectly.  I served it with mashed potatoes and brown gravy.  Perfect comfort food for a rainy evening.  I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out just right!

This was delicious! I  used 1/2 c sour cream but no ranch dressing, and, I had already used about 2 tsp from my onion soup mix packet. I was glad though, as I think the whole packet would have been too salty. This was so flavorful I cannot imagine needing the ranch dressing too. When I removed it from the oven, there was so much liquid that I was concerned it would be soggy, and that was having left out half of sour cream. I just poured the liquid off and it was very moist. It was a bit mushy when we served it right away  but so good we didn't mind.

Meatlof never my forte; loaf shaped meatball has.

Straight from the mouth of my 8 year old "Oh my gosh it's good." That gave me the warm fuzzies because I know I wouldn't go within 10 feet of a loaf of meat when I was a kid. It's still not my favorite, but I'm going to side with my daughter... It is really good. Easy to make. Perfect as written. I might have to fight my daughter for leftovers ;)

I am not a big meatloaf fan. I do not like the ketchup and stuff in the meatloaf. So I decided to try this. I thought the recipe was kind of bland, and my S.O. still put ketchup on his. Hah. Unfortunately, I had no onion soup mix, so i just put some onions in it. Perhaps this would have helped it be less bland. I might try this again, using the soup mix.

Super yummy and so easy my 5 year old made it! I just put all the ingredients into a bowl except the ground beef and mixed those together first. I only had 1/4 c. of sour cream and I also added a few dashes of Tabasco sauce and substituted Panko bread crumbs. He mixed it all up and i added the beef and baked it just as instructed. Amazing and moist and hardly a clean up! What mom doesn't love that?

I loved this recipe.  I did make a few changes after reading the other reviews, but it was delicious!  I used 1 lb ground beef.  1/3 cup BBQ sauce. 1 cup bread crumbs.  1/3 cup sour cream.  1/2 onion soup mix.  Chopped onions/peppers. Minced Garlic. Capful worstershire sauce. 1/4 cup milk. Broiled for 10 minutes uncovered.  Baked for 35 minutes covered.  Then bake uncovered for 10 mintues. At 375 degrees. I have eaten this for the past 3 days and still love every bite!  I also put a little BBQ sauce on the top

Really good meatloaf - it held together well and did not break apart when taking it out of the oven. I may use a little less bread crumbs the next time but this was very good just the way it was written. Thank you!

I followed this recipe exactly, except I had only 1 c. of breadcrumps left, so that's all I used, and it turned out just fine, very moist and delicious. My mother even commented that it was better than her meatloaf and asked for the recipe - a first! I did put a glaze of 1/3 c. ketchup, 2 T. mustard, 2 T. brown sugar, and 1 T. soy sauce whisked together on top before baking - it gave it an extra sweetness and depth of flavor.

This was a great "base" meatloaf recipe....with some alterations it came out absolutely delicious!!  I added 1/2 tsp. thyme, 1/2 tsp. paprika, 1/2 tsp. cumin and a sweet & sour glaze near the end of the cook time (15 min. uncovered).....awesome :)

I was looking for something different in a meatloaf and I certainly found it.  This was inedible.  I used half sour cream and half ranch dressing but otherwise followed the directions to a T.  It was way too salty and I love salty food but that certainly isn't all that's wrong with this salty, sour meatloaf.  My son drowned his with ketchup but still couldn't eat it.  Although there are recipes on this site that my family has enjoyed and that have become a part of the rotation, the vast majority of 4+ rated recipes that I have tried have been so very disappointing that I will not use this site again.  When I first discovered this site, I read a negative review in which the reviewer asked, "Don't you people know what food is suppose to taste like?"  At the time I thought she was very rude.  Now I think it was right on.

I'm 40 and this is the first meatloaf I have ever made. It was awesome. I used 1/2 c sour cream and 1/2 c Dean's French Onion dip, 2 Tbsp of steak sauce instead of W sauce, and 1 c Italian style b crumbs and 1/2 c crushed Italian style instant stuffing mix (out of necessity for lack of required ingred) OMG this was the best meatloaf I have eaten - EVER. My husband scarfed it down and took leftovers in a sandwich the next day and this man does NOT eat leftovers. Even my 5-year old son cleaned his plate. Thanks Eileen!

Followed some other reviewers' advice and substituted 1/2 cup of the sour cream with ranch dressing and only used 3/4 cup bread crumbs. Otherwise followed to a T and it was delicious!  As someone else suggested, I also used 1/2 cup ketchup + 1/2 cup dark brown sugar and a squirt of yellow mustard to glaze it during the last 15 minutes after foil removal/draning. I have 3 ravenous teenage boys and one famished husband to feed here in this house--they all raved!! Thank you for a delicious meatloaf recipe Eileen! We'll be making this again!

I am not a meatloaf fan, but this recipe is incredible!!!    There's no tomatoey stuff you pour on top of it.  It doesn't need it.  It is moist and flavorful.  Love it!  I have made it several times and once for my in-laws and they loved it too!  Great for sandwiches the next day too.

Yummo!!  This was fantastic.  I made a few minor changes, only because I didn't have all the ingredients and it still turned out wonderfully.  I omitted the egg (didn't have any in the house, used 1/2 cup sour cream, substituted onion powder in place of the soup mix, and used 1/2 cup grated mozzarella.  This recipe is fantastic!!!

I have never made a meatloaf that I enjoyed until I made this one last night. I use 1# lean ground and 1/2 # ground pork.

This meatloaf was awesome.  I used a combination of veal, pork and ground beef.    It was even better the next day as leftovers.

Followed recipe exactly except for using reduced sodium soup mix instead of regular.  Was too salty so next time I'll use only half a packet.  After removing lid of loaf pan, for last 10-15 minutes of cooking, I drained the grease but there was only maybe a teaspoon.  Tasty and very moist.

Sorry, but I have had better meatloaf recipes.  I like the fact that their is little work and usually the ingredients are on hand but the onion soup overpowered the whole dish and I used less than half the packet per other reviews.  It was moist and cooked well with a good consistency but the flavor was just too much onion soup.

This was pretty good, the best part about it was that it was MOIST - always what I want from meatloaf.  Will probably make again and use just 1/2 onion soup packet

I am a collector of meatloaf recipes because my hubby loves them, and this one is really, really good.  I made four small loaves to decrease baking time, and made a quick sauce on top of the stove with a can of cream of mushroom soup, some sherry, and some half-n-half.   Yummy!!!!!

This was a must try dish!   Loved it!  My only tweak would be to add a smidge less bread crumbs!  1 1/2 cups was a bit much and made it a little mushy!  Next time I will try 1 cup!

Probably the best meatloaf I've tasted (and I made it!!). I did not put but 1/2 cup of breadcrumbs based on another review.  When I took off the foil (per the recipe) I put the following on top: In a small bowl, combine 1/2 cup ketchup, 1/2 cup brown sugar, 1 tablespoon lemon juice and 1 teaspoon mustard powder. Make sure you drain off the excess fat before you do this. I also put hot & spicy Allegro in the mixture instead of Worcestershire sauce. Delicious.

I thought it was real easy to make, it was not dry at all, if you follow the directions and have the oven temp right as stated, it comes out perfect. it cooks in less then an hour and you still have time to whip some potatoes and a quick  veggi,while the meat is cooking perfect. The parm cheese, I add what I like to my taste so I just sprinkle what I like into the mixture without measuring it :)

Pretty good. Makes a very moist meatloaf. I didn't add all of the onion soup but will next time to add more flavor. Also, I had to add about 20 minutes to the cook time.

This was really good, but I do agree that the full onion packet was too much.  Next time I'll only use half and cut down a little on the bread crumbs as well.  But the sour cream made it very moist and delicious!

I used this recipe to make meatloaf for the first time.  My boyfriend and I loved it.  We had leftovers for a few days and it is just as good.  We made sandwiches out of the leftovers.  Great recipe.  I will make this again!!!

Great recipe, made it for six with 2 lbs of meat, it all went.  I also used the 1/2 sour cream and 1/2 ranch (dressing) with brown sugar and catsup as a topping.  Will make it again and again.  Thanks.

Very good and tasty recipe.  I did make some minor changes. I used the ranch dressing instead of sour cream as some had said to do.  I also used A1 Steak Sauce Bold instead of the Worcestshire Sauce, I added a mixture of ketchup and brown sugar and poured over the meatloaf the last 10 minutes of cooking time.  I extended the total cooking time to 1 hour and 20 minutes.  Also, I needed to only use half of the soup mixture cause it was too salty for my taste.  My family raved about this recipe, it is a keeper. Thanks, Lindsay.

I adjusted the recipe a tad... substituted half of the sour cream with ranch dressing, used 1/2 sauteed chopped onion and red pepper instead of onion soup mix, and added fresh chopped parsley...came out delicious.  Very moist and flavorful.

I used ground turkey to be a little more healthy. I had no sour cream so I used half a can of cream of mushroom and followed every thing else as the recipe stated. It came out great! I also topped with the ketchup brown sugar mixture and the glaze was really good !

My husband will eat no other meatloaf! The only difference I make in the recipe is that I'll use Lipton onion mushroom soup mix. I grew up on my moms meatloaf recipe that was basically made with nothing more than ketchup and saltine crackers.  AWFUL!  Love love love this recipe!

Yummy meatloaf! I would have never thought of putting sour cream in my meat loaf, but it was really good. It had a really good texture. The only thing I did different was, I put ketchup on the top for the last 10 minutes of baking.

My husband went gaga over this meatloaf although I made slight variations. I used half ground beef and half ground chicken. Used half a cup of sour cream and half a cup of Caesar dressing and garlic powder and two eggs. Yummy. Will definitely make again and again.

Delicious! I substituted 2/3 cup lite mayo and 1/3 cup ketchup for the sour cream, plain bread crumbs instead of Italian-style and left out the Parmesan cheese.

Followed recipe as written except only put in 1 cup of bread crumbs (as it just looked like too much with 1 1/2 cups).  Was skeptical as it baked that last 15 minutes uncovered...looked dry.  HOWEVER, the entire family LOVED this meatloaf!  Very moist!  Delicious flavor!  Keeping this recipe on favorites file!

Very good. I swapped the dry onion soup mix for dry garlic soup mix and brushed the top with garlic bbq sauce for the last 15 minutes.

Sorry, everyone.  This meatloaf was dry and bland.  I even used Jalapeno ranch dressing along with the sour cream and added catsup on the top for the last 15 mins.  Didn't help.  Very dissapointed.  I'll go back to the basic meatloaf recipe and go from there. I do give it one star for the ingredients.

This meatloaf was moist and probably one of the best tasting I have found. I followed the recipe to the letter,except I doubled the recipe. This will be the meatloaf recipe I use from now on.

This is the best most flavorful meatloaf I have ever tasted. The only change I made was plain breadcrumbs because most flavored ones contain MSG... There wasn't any left for the next day! You'll love it!

This was not only the first meatloaf I ever made but the first meatloaf I ever ate. I thought it was okay, I honestly don't have anything to compare it too. My husband loved it. Had seconds (which is rare for him) and ate it for breakfast too. I followed the recipe as is and it turned out great. My husband did find that a little bit of ketchup on it was the kicker. I will be making this again.

I myself was never a big fan of meatloaf so quite honestly this is the first time I ever made one.  My son did not care for, my husband thought it was plain, and I on the other hand thought it was very tasty and moist.  I was impressed.  Thank you for sharing!

I am not a fan of meatloaf but really enjoyed this one!  I used turkey instead of beef.  My husband liked it so much he ate half!  I followed the recipe as it was, although I didn't have sour cream or onion soup mix.  So, I used prepared onion dip mix instead.  It was very moist and delicious.  Like others, I made the ketchup, brown sugar and mustard glaze on on top.  Thanks for sharing!

Wasn't very impressed with this recipe tonight.  The meatloaf seemed "mushy" and  did the same thing others did by using 1/2 cup sour cream and 1/2 cup ranch.  Don't think I will be making this one again.  Flavor wasn't terrible, I just couldn't get passed the texture.

Excellent.  I also added some sausage meat, an onion and a red bell pepper to the mix and used crushed Ritz crackers.  I forgot the parmesan and I bet it would have been even better with that!  I might add some oregano and basil next time.  The sour cream makes it so nice!

I made this meatloaf for dinner tonight.  I followed the recipe to a "T".The only change I made was I followed others advise and made the sauce of 1/2 c. ketchup, 1/2 c. of brown sugar and a squirt of yellow mustard.  I put the sauce on in the last 1/2 hour of cooking(I did have to cook it a little longer than suggested because I used 2 lbs. of meat)  But it turned out really good.  In fact the best meat loaf recipe I've ever had.....and the only one I'll ever use from now on.  Great recipe, good flavor, held together well.  Just very, very good.

I was skeptical about sour cream in the meatloaf, but, it was great!  I only added half of the dry onion mix and a half a teaspoon more of the worcestershire.  Great recipe!

This was good...though I only used half the amount of breadcrumbs and thought even that was too much.  And I agree with my husband's assessment: "It needs catsup!"

This is FANTASTIC!  I made it exactly as written the first time and loved the flavor but it was a tad wet.  The second time I made it I took a few suggestions from others and quite honestly, it was perfect.  I do season the beef with a bit of salt, onion powder and garlic salt.  I used half the amount of worcestershire, sour cream and onion soup mix.  Then I use almost 2 cups of fresh breadcrumbs and added a teaspoon of homemade italian seasoning.  (1/4 teaspoon each of marjoram, basil, oregano and thyme.)  Seriously, the best meatloaf I've ever had.

Very good.  Nice and firm but still moist.  I only had3/4 C sour creme so I added a quarter cup of blue cheese dressing to it.  Still came out great.

I've never cooked a meatloaf before and this recipe was perfect. My girlfriend was jealous that I did so well on the first try. In actuality, this recipe was just so simple and perfect

Something didn't work for me in this recipe. The meatloaf was very moist, but my husband didn't care for it too much. I thought it was ok, but nothing special

I found this meatloaf to be a little wet... it didn't have much texture to it.  And flavor-wise, there is definitely something missing.  I'll be looking for another recipe to try and not make this one again.

Mmmm....  I made this meatloaf exactly as written and loved it! I saw a lot of neat ideas and variations however, I recommend trying it at least once as written, I really don't think any changes are necessary, its really, really good!

Hats off to Eileen for this excellent, easy recipe.  I have made a couple of modifications that may be of interest.  1/2 ground beef and 1/2 ground pork or chicken.  I use plain bread crumbs, and add 1 TBSP Italian Seasoning.  After it is in the loaf pan, I "frost" it with Ketchup, and lay strips of bacon over the top.  After baking 45 minutes, I take the foil off and bake it for another 45.  This meatloaf is a guaranteed hit no matter who I serve it to.  I serve it with either baked yam, baked potato, mashed potatoes and gravy, and a green veggie (green beans go well).

This was the best meatloaf i've made! My 5 and 3 yr. old had seconds. I only made a few minor adjustments. After reading another review, I used 1/2 c. sour cream, 1/2 c. ranch dressing, 3/4 c. bread crumbs, 1/2 a pkg. soup mix, and a splash of A-1. Stayed together well. Will definately make again.

I have tried several meatloaf recipes from this site, and I think this is one of the best.  It has few ingredients which I LOVE.  The only thing I slightly changed was to use real bread and saltines for the bread crumbs since I didn't have the Italian bread crumbs on hand.  And I did add the ketchup/brown sugar/bbq topping because we prefer to have something on top.

This is INCREDIBLE!!!  With no ketchup in the recipe, it lowers the sugar content a lot.  My only modification to the recipe is to use 1lb ground sirloin and 1/2 lb pork sausage instead of 1 1/2 lbs sirloin.  Otherwise, I wouldn't change a thing.  My family loves it!!!

I decided to make this recipe based on ingredients and rating and I am so glad I did. I HATE meatloaf so I never eat it. My family enjoyed this so much and my persistent husband kept saying you gotta try this so reluctantly I did. Not only did I eat my own serving I had seconds! It was so good! I have other meatloaf recipes from this site but because the whole family agrees on this one, this is THE ONE! As my 7 yr old put it "this is some good stuff!"
Thank You Eileen

I couldn't figure out how I would get 12 servings out of this with only 1.5 lbs of meat, but it worked out--all the filler must have made it bigger.  It turned out really well and I will make it again.

This is the best meatloaf ever.  My favorite meal is meatloaf and I thought mine was the best, but this matches mine and maybe even better.  Great for sandwiches the next day.  Thx will make again and again.  Loved it.

This meatloaf was pretty good except I tweaked it up a bit. I added a bit of milk and onions. I did not have sour cream so I skipped that. I made my topping with ketchup, worchestire sauce, brown sugar, and mustard. Sweet and yummy.

Meatloaf?  How exciting can that be???  This is the BEST!  I've always liked meatloaf and my family...they could take it or leave it.  Since I've started making this one, it is a weekly request.  

I do make a couple of changes.  I add chopped onion, at least a half of a cup.  I omit a pound of beef and add a pound of ground pork and if I can find it, I also add about a pound of ground veal.  I add about a teaspoon of nutmeg, I know it sounds crazy, but try it!  And best of all...you've got to do this!  Chop one half pound of bacon, cook it to crispy, drain and add to the meatloaf ingriedents! WOW! It is SO good!

I'd never made a meatloaf before, hadn't even eaten one in years, so I' was looking for something relatively easy and good.  This definitely fit the bill.  Even my boyfriend who can be picky about flavors loved it.

Absolutely LOVE this meatloaf... not a big fan of oregano, so this was awesome not having that spice to overpower the recipe! I am actually eating it right now for the second day in a row, and I made it for my boyfriend yesterday and he made a a sandwich out of it first, and said it is the all time best meatloaf! Keeper?  I would say so... I used regular seasoned bread crumbs instead and only one cup as suggested. Also, I added a tablespoon of salsa to the meat mix, and pushed fresh jalepeno pieces into the top of loaf (after washing and deseeding) and then last 15 minutes of baking, added a mix of 2 tbs brown sugar, lil over half cup ketchup and 2 tbs mustard stirred together to the top of loaf as well... I am so satisfied... thank you Eileen...

Wow!  My husband reallly doesn't care for meatloaf, but he said this one was amazing!!  The only thing I changed was reducing the amount of bread crumbs to 1 cup and I added some chopped mushrooms.  This one is DEFINATELY a keeper!!

My family loves this.  I usually use 1-2 lbs ground beef plus another pound of ground sausage.  Instead of onion soup mix, I substitute diced onions, garlic powder, black pepper, and cumin.  I top off with cheddar cheese for the final 10-15 minutes. Plus, always served with mashed potatoes.  Yum!

I have been commanded to never make any other meatloaf recipe again after my boyfriend ate this one!  We loved the texture...held it's shape even though I don't own a loaf pan!  Used seasoned bread crumbs and topped with ketchup.  Made the best leftovers!

This meatloaf turned out very moist and tasty, but was a little heavy.  I used only half of the onion soup mix as my husband doesnt like to strong an onion taste.  I made a topping of brown sugar, ketchup and mustard. I definately had to cook it longer - an hour and a half total.  I would make again. Next time I will try mixing a pound of ground beef with a half pound of ground pork to increase the flavor.

I'm giving this recipe 4 stars because I liked it.  The rest of my family didn't think it was so great--maybe they just don't like any kind of meatloaf.  I added a ketchip, brown sugar and mustard topping per suggestions.  Will make it again when I'm feeding a meatloaf-loving crowd.

Gross.  Sorry, but I didn't like this at all.  It was salty, dry, and the cheese ended up giving it an "off" smell.  There are so many interesting meatloaf recipes out there - this isn't one of them.

My kids and I are not much into meat loaf, but this one even had my little ones asking for more. I did add chopped bell pepper. My husband had meat loaf sandwiches for 3 days.

This is a very good meatloaf recipe. The texture was great and adding the sour cream was a nice touch that I had never considered. I reduced the bread crumbs to 1 cup and added 1/4 cup tomato juice.Thanks for sharing it.

This was a very good meatloaf recipe. My husband liked it. It was full of flavor. I used 1/2c of ranch dressing and 1/2c sour cream. Also I started out with 1/2 of bread crumbs and worked my way up from there. This was a delicious recipe will make it again.

Excellent. I also used 1/2 sour cream & 1/2 ranch dressing.  For last 15 minutes of baking I topped it with a mixture of ketchum & brown sugar.  Best meatloaf I've ever had.  This'll be a regular around our house.

All in all it was easy and my two men at home liked it.

I didn't really like this meatloaf. I found it very dense and not very tasty. I guess I just like lighter meatloaves. It sure was easy though.

Very good. I used Panko bread crumbs but followed the recipe otherwise. Very moist and was good for a few more days. The flavors were even better. Will add to my recipe files and make again.

So much more flavor than the old stand by. I think it might be the sour cream with the parm!

It was very good.  I subbed 1/2 the sour cream for ranch dressing.  Next time I will decrease the breadcrumbs to 1 c., and maybe add an extra egg.  That's all.  I tried the brown sugar/ketchup/mustard/garlic glaze recommended by many, but we all decided we liked it better without the sweet accent.  I will make again with my changes. Oh, and I used the traditional meatloaf mix (beef, pork, veal)

This is my go-to meatloaf recipe. While many reviewers feel the need to tweak it to their own specific tastes, I can tell you without reservations that no changes are necessary. During the last 10 minutes, I do like to top it with a little BBQ sauce. Again, just a preference. One of the best things about it is that leftovers freeze so very well. I like to vacuum-seal individual slices for later. A suggestion for anyone who dislikes mixing the loaf by hand is to use your KitchenAid at it's lowest speed to combine the ingredients. I don't think I'd ever go back to mixing yucky meat by hand.

This meatloaf is delicious with a few modifications. I think it uses too many dry ingredients so I think it is best to leave the parmesan out and to add an extra egg. Add in the bread crumbs slowly and you will be able to tell when it gets to be too many of them.

I've never made my husband meatloaf because I've never been a fan of it. Come to find out..... my husband has never cared for meatloaf either. This recipe changed both of our minds. Super moist!! I used about half of a small onion pureed and sautéed instead of soup mix. I also used regular bread crumbs (its what I had on hand)and added Italian seasoning, salt, pepper, and a bit of garlic. I paired this with Chef John Mushroom meatloaf gravy. Cheesy scalloped potatoes and bacon wrapped green beans. As suggested I also made sandwiches today for hubby's lunch. When he left this morning he said he couldn't wait for lunch. I will not be looking for another meatloaf recipe. Thank You!!

My husband and I really enjoyed this. I have a meatloaf recipe that I've been making for years that my family loves, so I don't normally try other meatloaf recipes, but this was super tasty and will make it into our dinner rotations.  I used 21/4 lbs of ground beef and increased the other ingredients a tad.

I used extra lean ground beef and tore two slices of fresh whole grain bread into small pieces instead of using the crumbs. I also flattened it out more in a larger pan. Otherwise I didn't change anything--just made sure to use Lea and Perrins worcestershire sauce and Breakstone sour cream. The family loved it, and it made great leftovers for sandwiches! Made about 8 servings. Holds together beautifully and quick to prepare. Will keep this in the rotation as an alternative to the more traditional recipe! Thanks, Lindsay (and Eileen)!

Delish! I just made and per the author's suggestion, I substituted onion dip for part of the sour cream (1/3 c dip, 2/3 sour cream). I used full fat dip and sour cream. I think low fat and fat free dips taste bad when used for cooking. Maybe that's my personal taste preference. My cooking results have been more unpredictable with the fat free stuff. I am definitely adding this to my "go to" recipe list!

The BEST meatloaf!  I've made this several times, and even though I may not have all the ingredients at times, it still is amazing.  I like to add fresh cut white onion to the meatloaf, and a glaze of brown sugar, ketchup, w/worcheshire sauce towards the last 15 minutes while it's uncovered.

Fantastic!  My fiance isn't a big meatloaf fan but I refuse to believe that someone cannot like meatloaf - maybe it was just cooked the wrong way ;).  This was the second recipe I tried, the first being too ketchupy so I decided to stay away from that.  This recipe is amazing.  I sauteed 1/2 chopped onion and 2 cloves of garlic in butter in place of the onion soup mix, and this is the honestly the first time I've eaten meatloaf with onion and not been aware of the onion.  Good tip from a previous reviewer!  FI and our boys raved about it.  Definitely a keeper!

This is a very easy and yummy meatloaf. I did use 1/2 cup sour cream and 1/4 cup ranch dressing. Only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is there are several other meatloaf recipes on this site that are truly delicious.

Love this recipe I use it all the time, my go to meatloaf recipe which believe gets used all the time.  I dial back the onion soup mix, only use half a pack.  Also cut back a bit on the sour cream usually.  My favorite substitute for the sour cream is bleu cheese dressing, the little chunks of cheese are phenominal.

I changed too much to really be able to honestly rate this. We were pleased so far, but I didn't have real onion soup mix, so I had to make it and I used turkey burger.  I also used Italian seasoning and bread crumbs. There was a lot of making do tonight. I think it will be better with a little more flavor.  It did hold together well.

Made the 2nd time - delicious!  Made it with onion soup mix, it was excellent.  I think our meatloaf recipe has arrived.

This was an excellent take on meatloaf. Something different than the catsup recipes that we grew up with.  I followed the recipe except I added salt, pepper, garlic, and italian seasonings.  It was a hit with my family, even my daughter who hates meatloaf.

I had yet to find a meat loaf I like until I tried this one... It is amazing. I did use all of the soup mix in it, next time I might just use half. I made it before I went to work and took a piece with me... by the time I got home my bf had already at it all... Will definitely make again! Thanks for the recipe!

Great recipe!  We'll use a little more flavor next time--Maybe more salt & pepper, at least, more worcestire or garlic or something.  But it was a keeper!

Just looking for something a little different from our usual.  Tried this recipe but it did not have enough flavor for us.  Will keep searching.

This was really good. We really enjoyed the sauce. Many reviews thought it was too sweat,, we did not feel that way. The only exception I made was I added green peppers.

Thanks for great recipe. I had one like this but with just dry soup mix, then I lost it...glad I did this one is a keeper. The only change I made was to use swiss cheese (what I had on hand. My grandkids LOVED this. Makes great leftover sandwiches make extra!

I was a little skeptical about making this recipe, I am new to the whole cooking and baking housewife role. Making this was so easy though, the only difference that I had was I did not use the sour cream I used half a can of tomato soup in the mix and then when i took off the foil I pour the rest of the soup ontop of the loaf, which turned out fabulous! Also instead of the brad crumbs I used multi-grain club crackers. When all said and done my husband could not stop complimenting me on the meal.

Meatloaf isn't meatloaf without ketchup.  Slap the ketchup-based glaze from "Glazed meatloaf II" onto this recipe, and you will be very VERY satisfied.

This is the best meatloaf recipe I have found. It turns out so moist and we love having it for left overs the next day for lunch or dinner. I usually use beef, pork, & veal with beef gravy. YUM !

This was SO good! I used half sour cream and half ranch dressing, and also used two pounds of meat, combo of ground turkey and beef.  Everyone loved it, will be making again, especially since I always have these ingredients on hand.  Thanks!!

I am giving this 4 stars because I changed it up a bit. I pretty much used the same ingredients except for the dry onion soup mix i used beefy onion soup i also added some french fried onions in with the other ingredients and after baking for about 45-50 mins covered; I took the foil off and put a glaze of brown sugar ketchup and honey barbecue sauce about 1/4 of each on the top and let it bake for about another 15-20 mins.
I served this with mash potatoes and steamed corn.  My guys tore it up went for seconds, my husband asked for some for his lunch tomorrow... there's only about 2 slices left enough for a good sandwich!!! Thanx for this recipe. Its a good change from my normal meatloaf recipe and very tasty.

I found this meatloaf to be entirely too salty. I imagine that was due to the 1/2 packet of onion soup mix that I used.  I might make this again, but will be sure to omit the onion soup mix.

We LOVED this!  I am not a meatloaf fan at all and probably haven't eaten it since I was a kid, but after making this recipe I couldn't wait to get home from work the next day so I could have some more! I used the 1/2 cup of sour cream and half cup of ranch dressing.  I also topped it with the mixture of ketchup/brown sugar/57-steak sauce (didn't have worchestire)and cheese slices. It was AWESOME!  My 9 year old step-son begged to take it to school for lunch the next day!  Next time I'm going to combine this recipe with another one that tried out on here and flatten the meat mixture and then roll it up with shredded mozzerella cheese inside.  Yummmm!  can't wait!

Great variation on meatloaf,  and there are many.  I used 1 lb lean hamburger and half lb. italian sausage.  1 16 0z. light sour cream.  2 onion soup pkg.  several tb. spoons worchshire. 2 eggs.
Cup and half italian bread crumbs. 1 diced onion and a minced jap for a kick.  Salt and pepper.  Cooked @ 350 for about an hour covered.  Topped with tomato sauce cooked uncovered another 15 minutes.  The result was a giant italian
meatball in the form of a meatloaf.  Very good !!!  Makes good sandwiches or crumble for pizza topping.

This was my very first time making meatloaf, and I'm a terrible cook. But this was great!! My boyfriend loved it!! I don't know if I messed it up, but we thought the consistancy was different than any other meatloaf we have had before, I guess it was the sour cream that made a difference. It also took longer to cook, again, I could have messed up or our oven sucks!! HAHA Anyway we loved it and this will be my offical meatloaf recipe. Thanks

This meatloaf is SO easy and very delicious. I made this with ground turkey instead and my husband didn't know until I told him. I scaled it down to use only 1 lb of turkey and used a 9" round cake pan to cook it in. Because that spread it out more, the cooking time was exactly as stated in the recipe. I did do the sour cream/ranch dressing split and I added the ketchup/brown sugar/lemon juice/dry mustard topping at the end. MMMMM! MMMM!

Update - I now use ground turkey only with this and it is still incredible. My family doesn't even know the difference. I use garlic flavored bread crumbs and A-1 Steak Sauce, removing the Worcestershire. I get this requested all the time from the family AND friends. Yum!

This recipe was awesome.  Even my picky eaters (all 5 of them including my hubby) ate this up.  We did have a little leftover, so he took it to work.  A true sign of something he likes!  My little one's (ages 3 & 4) devoured it.  Definitely a keeper.  Thanks for sharing!

I made this exactly as stated in the recipe and my daughter and I loved it!  It is great for sandwiches because it holds its shape and the flavor is different and very tasty. We will make this again!  I do like a sauce with meatload & wd probably put something on top but not if it affects the flavor.

Unlike many of the past reviewers, I do like meatloaf and I really liked this one.  I used half ground pork and half ground beef.  I also used beefy onion soup mix.  My mother has never covered a meatloaf so I didn't either.  Cooked it for 1 hour and it was great!

I was very disappointed with this meatloaf.  It had absolutely no flavor and definitely needed to cook longer than 45 minutes.  I will not make this again.

My family loved this recipe. I added some chopped onions and made a ketchup glaze (kids can't live without ketchup). It was very moist and flavorful. This one is a keeper!

I thought this recipe was delicious, my husband barely got a forkful in his mouth and said it was a keeper. The only issue I had, like some other reviewers, was I had to cook it for an additional 45 min. I'm not sure why I followed the recipe as it was written. Oh, well, it was worth the wait. I will definetely make again.

I made this last night and my boyfriend and I loved it!!  I followed other users advice and cut the breadcrumbs back to 1 cup.  After uncovering mine, I basted the tops with ketchup, brown sugar, and mustard mixture and baked for an additional 15 minutes.  Loved it!  Will definitely become a staple in our house!!!

My family and I love meatloaf and my two favorites on this site are Mushroom Meatloaf and Italian Style Meatloaf I.  I decided to try this out and it did NOT do it for us. Did not taste like the comfort food meatloaf that I grew up with.

I'm not a meatloaf fan, but my husband and son absolutely loves meatloaf so I decided to try something a little different hoping I would find a meatloaf recipe that I too would love.  Bottom line, I just don't care for meatloaf, however, this recipe was definately better than the standard one I had been using.  It was very moist (not dry like most) and the sour cream gave it a different "twang" which was very good.  I followed the recipe exactly as instructed and agree with other raters that the amount of bread crumbs needs to be cut back to reduce the more "mushy" texture than that of traditional meatloaf.

This meatloaf was wonderful and my kids loved it as well.  I did take the advice of another person and only used 1 cup of bread crumbs.  I did not make any other changes to the recipe.  Thank you very much Eileen, I will definitely make this one again!!

Excellent!! I really hate meatloaf since I was a kid..decided to try to make one for my hubby. He hates ketchup..so this one stood out. I did make it with 1/2 sour cream and 1/2 ranch dressing also cut the breadcrums to 3/4 cups and since I didn't have the soup mix added onion flakes. very very good and moist. Can now say I love meatloaf.  Thanks!

This is the most moist meatloaf my husband and I have had to date, thanks to the sour cream. The onion soup mix and Italian bread crumbs make it flavorful. I used 2 lbs of ground sirloin instead of 1.5 lbs chuck, and it tasted great, plus it's a little leaner.

This meatloaf tasted great. This was only the second time I've ever had meatloaf, and the first time I've ever made it. I was happy it didn't look like other meatloafs, with a ketchupy/tomatoey glazed look to it - which I find unappealing. The only thing I changed was to add a couple of squirts of ketchup into the mix. I also discovered I didn't have the bread crumbs I thought I had. Since I'd already mixed everything else together, I had to improvise by using hot dog buns. I used four and tore them each into two sections, placed them on a cookie sheet, and toasted them for a few minutes in the oven at 375 (this would have probably worked better in a toaster oven.) I then crumbled/tore them up into the mix. They weren't *completely* toasted/crisped through, but they worked in place of the bread crumbs. The meatloaf still tasted great. I also didn't think it was too salty, but I am a person who LOVES salt... so I'd say whether it's too salty or not may be purely dependent upon your tastebuds.

This is the best meatloaf I have made.  I added a bit of ketchup and used onion powder instead of the onion soup.  I might add a bit more worcestershire sauce next time.  Great recipe.

Yummy!  I didn't have onion soup or parmesan, but it turned out great anyway.  I sauteed fresh onion and added that.  I used 1/2 cup of sour cream (all I had in the fridge), and it came out delicious!  So if you're missing or low on a few ingredients, don't hesitate to try this one anyway.

I cannot believe I havent reviewed this one yet. This one I've been making since I found this site a long time ago. It made a believer out of my husband, who hates meatloaf... except for THIS meatloaf.

It's a staple in my recipe box. So easy, always good. I serve it with brown gravy and mashed potatoes and a vegetable. Yum.

I do change one thing - I only use half of the envelope of onion soup mix, otherwise it's too salty for me. Thanks for a great recipe. There is no other way I make meatloaf now.

This was my first time making meatloaf.  I did it mostly for my husband, as I have never been a big fan.  I chose this recipe because it didn't have pieces of peppers and onions, or the sweet glaze on top.  It was WONDERFUL!  I really loved it, thank you so much.  I made some minor adjustments - used only 1 cup of breadcrumbs and 2/3 cup sour cream.  Otherwise, I stick to the recipe.  Very moist and flavorful!

This was very good. Also good with ranch dip instead of the sour cream.
 I think a few people confused ranch sour cream dip with ranch dressing, which would add a lot more fat and only make it more greasy.
 I did use less bread crumbs, which can make meatloaf dry and mealy if too much is used as "filler". 
The onion soup mix is the key to it being juicy and not dry also.

This recipe was okay.  Not a huge hit, however. The parmesan was seemed a bit out of place.  Brown sugar meatloaf on this site is still my favorite.

This was really delicious!!   I used half sour cream and half ranch dressing. I removed the foil after an hour, and I put a mixture of cocktail sauce and ketchup on the top and baked for an additional half hour uncovered.  WOW -- The cocktail sauce REALLY gave it a delicious zing.  Everyone loved this.  Thanks!

This was the perfect meatloaf recipe for our house as it doesn't contain ketchup or mustard, both of which my husband hates.  I made it exactly as written except divided into 4 mini loaves to accomodate the only loaf pan I have and added shredded cheddar to the top during the last 5 mins.  I thought the flavor and consistency were great and it was a breeze to make.  Will make again.

This came out excellent.  My boyfriend asked me to make meatloaf, and I groaned.  My memories (from growing up) are of a dry lump of meat on my plate with plenty of ketchup to cover the flavor.  This recipe was great.  He loved it!  It was SO moist.  For the last 15 minutes, I added a few slices of muenster cheese.

This is a great meatloaf recipe!!  I thought the texture and consistancy were perfect, and it even looked perfect when it came out of the oven (I did need to give it more than the reccommended one-hour cook time).  My daughters, aged four and seven, are the queens of "But mom, I'm full!!", and they BOTH wanted seconds of this meatloaf!!!  That's how you KNOW it's good!

I followed the recipe exactly, but I really didn't care for this recipe. I came out of the oven looking exactly like meatloaf *shouldn't* look. So it wasn't very appetizing. Plus, I didn't think it had enough flavor, and I wasn't thrilled with the texture.

Delicious!  I always thought my own meatloaf was the best, but this one is now my favorite!  And simple to make too.  This was one of the very few recipes that I've tried that I did no modifications to whatsoever.  (Except I used plain breadcrumbs.)  I served it with mashed potatoes and yum!  My husband and 3 pre-k children loved it too.

This was very moist but it needed a topping like ketchup, brown sugar etc.  I will make this again with the topping from Easy Meatloaf recipe on this website.

This was great.  My hubby said it was the best meatloaf that I have ever made.  I checked out other reviews and made a few changes.  I only used 1/2 cup of bread crumbs (this was plenty), I added 2 Tsps of water and topped with a small can of tomato sauce.  I increased cooking time for a total of 1 hour 20 minutes.

Excellent!  Was short on sour cream so I used ranch dressing to make up the difference.  My husband said it’s probably the best meatloaf recipe I’ve ever made.

I've been making meatloaf for over 60 years and I have to say this is the worst I've ever made! I followed the recipe except subbing half Ranch dressing for the sour cream and adding garlic. We found that while the texture was good the taste was completely bland. Except for the sour cream and breadcrumbs this is pretty much my basic recipe so I'm not sure where the problem is but it definitely needed more seasoning.  I'm going to make an onion gravy to serve over this to try to salvage it.

Pretty much our go-to meatloaf recipe.  Make it as written save for just shaping the loaf in a baking dish rather than using a loaf pan, and adding a coat of bbq sauce before putting it into the oven.  Always a winner.

This was delicious & our friends liked it.  I doubled the recipe but used only 1 cup of sour cream & maybe 1/4 c of pepper ranch.  I used chopped onion and red pepper with some minced fresh garlic.  I doubled and used all of the recipe ingredients except the onion soup mix.  I cooked it as per the recipe and it was excellent.  I will put this in my keeper file to make again.  Found nothing wrong with the texture or the flavor.  I think I also added a few shakes of Trader Joe’s “21 Seasoning Salute” for some additional flavor while sautéing the vegetables.  Definitely recommend this recipe with the few changes.

I have played with meatloaf recipes for years.  This is simply the best one.  It is simple and has an excellent flavor and texture.  You can add things of you would like, and I do top it with ketchup, just because I like it, but definitely not necessary.  Just a really good and simple recipe.  I pretty much put it all in together and use a mixer just to combine, as I know not to over mix.  Always my go to recipe after I try another one, which is never as good!

This sounded interesting so gave it a try.  It was very good, moist & flavorful.  I did add a little ranch as reviews recommended.  I didn't like that, personally, but if I had made it as written, it would've been just right. I added a topping someone suggested using ketchup, a little mustard, brown sugar and worcestershire sauce.  We liked it.  Overall, great recipe! Thanks!

I’ve made this recipe for years without the sour cream and Worcestershire and added ketchup. It’s a classic Campbell soup meatloaf recipe.

The best meatloaf! Subbed gluten-free quick oats for the breadcrumbs and ranch dressing mix for the onion soup mix. Added three TBS dried mined onion, 3/4 cup finely diced celery, one shredded carrot and two shredded zucchini.

I usually make pretty standard meatloaf wanted to try something new. Husband wouldn't like all of the sweetened recipes with brown sugar glazes so I tried this. Was very good.  I used what I had on hand - mixture of Greek yogurt and. Sour cream, ranch dressing, Knorrs spring vegetable dip mix, beef bullion cube - and it got raves from the family. Very juicy and flavorful without being too from meatloaf tasting, if that makes sense. Looking forward to trying it with onion soup mix next time. Thanks!

I would not think of using any other recipe!  I have used this for years.  It does make an excellent cold sandwich as well.  I 
 do substitute bread crumbs with crushed saltines.

Excellent Meatloaf.  I made it exactly as written, however I added a  pound of ground pork in order to stretch the portions for company.  Everyone loved it and asked for seconds.  Can't go wrong with this recipe!!

Best meatloaf I have ever made!  I used lean ground beef and only had 1 lb. so I dialed all ingredients except the egg of course back by 1/4.  I did not have Italian breadcrumbs so I used a 1/2 package of Italian season w/Panko Traditional breadcrumbs.  Used 1/2 package of onion soup mix because I had 1/2 package open.  This was so great!  I am looking forward to sandwiches.  I will use 1.5 lbs next time since it is so good.  I think the switch of Italian seasoning w/Panko breadcrumbs will stay.  Thanks for this recipe!

This made a good meatloaf. I made some of the suggested changes to the recipe and it turned out great. I actually just made it again, so it's a keeper.

Very good, I did make a few changes - only 1/2 pack of onion soup mix and I added a few chopped mushrooms. And I added a glaze during the last 10 minutes of cooking. I will likely make again.

I've made this many times and it is my husband's favorite, however tonight it was exceptionally good.  I use about 2+ lbs of ground chuck, 2 eggs, 1 cup of the breadcrumbs, and about 1 cup of sour cream, plus the other ingredients as stated.  I mixed all the ingredients together first  then add them to the gr. beef. I form it into a loaf in a baking pan and let it cook for about a good hour covered then uncovered for about 1/2 hour or so, then top with a mixture of ketchup and brown sugar for about 10 min.  This takes some time to cook through.

I followed this recipe exactly.  It was not good.  It had some kind of weird consistency to it.     I am not too sure what the sour cream thing was all about but I feel like that just made it all very mushy.   Kids didn't care for it.  Will not make again.

I didn't care for the strong taste of the sour cream.  It gave a bit of a sour taste overall.  Also, a tad dry, so I would suggest using a ground beef with a high fat content, because mine came out dry.  Seasoning is on point, though.

Yum! Thankfully my kids and husband loved it! Was worried because I have never made meatloaf before. I did have trouble with the cooking times. It took me a lot longer! Next time I will cook in 2 bread pans or 1/2 the recipe. Will make again.

I don't care for meatloaf with tomatoes or ketchup, so I tried this.  I followed the recipe as closely as I could.  I didn't have Italian bread crumbs, so I used plain wheat bread and Italian seasoning.  I put in a little too much, but it was still moist and delicious.  This is a keeper.

This was good, I liked it. However,  my kids asked where the onions and catchup sauce was. They said it was good but there want me to add that stuff next time. I'd make it again. I also used the lipton onion and mushroom soup mix.

One of my family's  favorites ! Occasionally  will fill center with provolone cheese and cover with tomato sauce. I don't use the all the called for bread crumbs, I use 1 cup and 2 lbs of meat . Either way I love this recipe , your family will love it! That's a promise!

Husband really liked the flavor of this meatloaf. I would have given it five stars if I would have followed the directions exactly. Didn't have soup mix so substituted onion. Forgot to add the cheese although I think it would have been good. Did use the ranch dressing as others suggested. Also used 1/2 pound of sausage. Of course... didn't measure anything. I will keep this recipe as it was delicious and flavorful!

This is the best meatloaf recipe ever.  I used the meatloaf mixture (ground beef, pork, and veal). The parm cheese gives it the hearty flavor, love it.  My family loved it day 2 for sandwiches.  I drizzled a bit of BBQ sauce on top before I placed it in the oven.  AMAZING!

I've made this recipe numerous times exactly as written and it was a hit with people who don't like meatloaf.  I now take liberty to experiment with different ingredients. People PLEASE don't change the ingredients completely (like using fat free ranch dressing--YUCK) and give it a bad rating when it comes out bad.  Come on. Make your OWN recipe.

I loved the idea of this no fuss quick prep meatloaf, but alas, it was pretty yucky. It was nearly inedibly salty (that could be the fault of the particular onion soup mix brand I had I guess) and had no character to it - just a big salty chunk of hamburger. I put some BBQ sauce on the table to eat it with, but even so, my kids choked it down with milk.  Won't be making this one again.

Used other's suggestions and used 1/2 chive sour cream and 1/2 ranch dressing.  Excellent!  Will try the glaze of ketchup, brown sugar, garlic & mustard for top next time.  This recipe is an absolute winner -- either as originally written or with the tweaks.

Hubby really liked this meatloaf.  I liked the tang that the sour cream added.  I used a meat thermometer to determine when it was cooked through.  It took about 1 hour 15 minutes for mine, not 45 minutes.  Easy to put together and a yummy result!

It was really good.  Quick and easy with only 7 ingredients.  I didn't change anything except for adding a layer of 3 parts ketchup to 1 part yellow mustard on top, and I only had Kraft parmesan cheese rather than grated.

It was such an easy recipe to follow and so quick to put together. I did make a few small changes but I think the recipe as written would be good too. I read some of the other suggestions so I used 1/2 cup sour cream and 1/2 ranch dressing. I think the ranch gave it a nice added flavor. I also used 1/4 cup less of the bread crumbs because I thought it might turn out too dry. After baking though, I think the full amount would have been fine. It has a really good flavor and it'll make great sandwiches because it isn't crumbly at all. I'll definately make this again!

I really wanted to like this, as one of the Buzzers made good mention of this recipe.  We did not care for this recipe at all.  Think we will stick with the dill pickle meatloaf recipe.

This was really good. I used half ground beef and half Jimmy Dean sausage.  I also used asiago instead of parm, since that's what I had in the house.   It was delicious, and I'm not even a meatloaf lover.

i followed this recipe, exactly as written and it turned out great!  it was very moist and juicy.  it had a strong flavor of the onion soup mix, but i happen to really like that flavor.  if you don't, i don't recommend using the whole package.  as i saw in other reviews, i put some bread on the bottom of the pan to soak up the grease, and that worked well, and added a ketchup/brown sugar glaze that i found on other meatloaf recipes, that kicked up the flavor a knotch.  overall, great recipe.

i really liked it, except for the fact that i had to leave it in the oven probably about 45 minutes longer than suggested.  i dont know if that was because i didnt followthe recipe EXACT, but nevertheless it was really good, i also added some fresh onions, and that made the finished product even yummier!

I dont even like meatloaf and thought this was good. My MIL gave it 5 stars, my hubs about 3...so I settled on 4. ;)

It has a very light, almost creamy texture which my MIL and I enjoyed. Very tasty too! The flavors are simple but fabulous. :)

Very, very good!  I always thought I hated meatloaf because my mom and grandmother always made the kind with brown sugar and ketchup, but this was fantastic!  I turned the broiler on for about 3-5 minutes at the very end to crisp the top a bit at the end.  Sliced and topped with brown gravy.  Delicious!

Everyone really enjoyed it. The texture was a bit different, yet still yummy.This would be great made into meatballs and served over butter noddles. I topped this meatloaf off with another recipes topping: a ketchup, dry mustard, and brown sugar mixture. YUMMY!

I thought it was delicious and the onion soup is what really gives any meatloaf a REALLY good flavor. It is a very dense meatloaf, much more so than those I had growing up that used bread or oats. Also, I made a glaze with Ketchup, tomato sauce and honey--the sweet and sour combo worked really well.

This was an OK meatloaf, but not outstanding. I used oatmeal instead of breadcrumbs but other than that followed the recipe. I thought it would have more flavor with the addition of the onion soup mix and Worchestershire sauce, but I was disappointed. Not bad, just not a "knock your sox off" recipe.

The meatloaf had a great texture and was  very moist but to our family it was pretty bland. Next time I will probably add more spices and maybe some bell pepper. Thanks for the recipe.

I would give this five stars had it not been so salty.  The onion mix just had too much salt.  It held together really well and made excellent sandwiches the next day. I liked it more than my wife. She REALLY didn't like how salty it was. The sour cream is a great idea.

Very good, easy meatloaf recipe.  Stayed together well.  I added real bacon bits pressed into the top, over a sprinkle of additional worcestershire.

very good meatloaf. i didn't have onion soup mix so just put some onion in from the spice rack. also i used part sourcream part ranch dressing as suggested and also added a little cream of mushroom soup to the mixture and pour the rest on top once in the pan. so there was a little sauce to pour on mash potatos if desired.  turned out really well the kids ate it up!!

Not bad at all...flavorful but still has the traditional meatloaf taste. I prefer tomato sauce poured over it. I tried the 1/2 ranch dressing and half sour cream, but I think it made it too gooey. I like mine a bit more dry.

It was good ... nice thick and moist. I think I'd add onions and green peppers to it next time and some bbq sauce on top during the last several minutes of baking.

This meatloaf was very moist, but I think the recipe calls for too much parmesan cheese.  I found it overpowering.  I used freshly grated parmesan from the deli - perhaps canned parmesan (like Kraft) may have less flavor?  Otherwise, I would recommend this recipe.  Use less cheese and maybe add a tad more worcestershire, pepper or a little bit of tabasco to jazz it up a bit.

Fabulous meatloaf! Nice and moist, but firm. 
I made the dish with 1-lb ground beef and 1/2-lb ground pork. Can't wait to try it cold in sandwiches!

This is the best meatloaf I have ever made!!  I only gave it 4 stars cuz I did tamper a bit with the recipe.  I used 2 pounds of hamburger, 2 eggs, and A-1 steak sauce instead of worcestershire sauce and no parmesan cheese.  My son and boyfriend absolutely loved it, and what little bit I had left over was better the next day!!  It is definitely my new meatloaf recipe!!

Wonderful Meatloaf! Very flavorful and held it's form beautifully. I used beefy onion soup mix rather than just the onion. Also ran out of Parmesean cheese so I left it out. I topped mine with a glaze of ketchup, mustard, honey and brown sugar. It would be great with spaghetti sauce over the top, as well. Served with baked potatoes and corn for a wonderful dinner!

There is nothing bad to say about this meatloaf. That said, there isn't anything truly distinctive in the taste. I used the ranch dip and was expecting something a little different. It tasted like meatloaf. Good meatloaf, but nothing that made it memorable.

Very good meatloaf!  Great flavor, easy to make.  I baked it about 10 minutes longer and it was perfect. Very moist!  I froze the rest for dinner on another night.

Unfortunately we were all disappointed - we  thought it came out a little gooey (seemingly from the bread crumbs) in the loaf itself. I will say the edges were a little better - where it may have dried out more during baking?!? Not likely to try again...and not better the next day. Sorry!

This was a very good meat loaf.  I made it for a couple I know, who commented, "This isn't like my mom's meat loaf at all--I remember it always being very dry."  It's very moist and has great flavor.  And so easy to make!

Thank you Eileen!!  This is undoubtedly the best meatloaf I have ever tasted.  My husband requests this at least once a week.  My mother even admitted it was better than hers!

It took me a long time to find the perfect recipe for meatloaf.  This is it.  It's moist and delicious.  I put a ketchup/brown sugar glaze on top.  Yum!

This was excellent. I finally can make a meatloaf that "sticks" together! The sour cream and onion soup mix really added taste to a otherwise dull dish. Thanks for sharing.

Very good.  I used ranch dip and I think that made a big difference in the taste.  Thanks.

This was a big hit with my family! My daughter asked if I had a copy of the recipe for next time.To make sure that the meatloaf stayed moist,I added 2 tablespoons of water.I used Italiandressing instead of onion soup. Next time,I will use ranch dip--although I do love the sour cream.

I used half Ranch dressing and half sour cream, and I increased the cooking time by 20 mins (based on other reviews).  With peppercorn gravy, it was pretty rich & tasty.

This is a great meatloaf!!  I've made it a couple of times already, as I don't like onions I've left out the onion soup mix and used italian dressing as others have suggested.  Absolutely delicious, very moist!!  I also extended the cooking time by another 15 minutes.  Try it you won't be disappointed!!  :)

A very heavy meatloaf!  At least it did stick together.  Very bland and heavy.  I will not make it again.

It tasted yummy but I think it was a little mushy so maybe it needs to cook longer.  I used 1 pound of meat and cooked it for an hour 15.

This recipe was very good!!!!  It was very very moist.  I added tomato sauce on top to give it even more flavor. The only thing was that Ihad to cook it longer than what the recipe called for.

My family LOVED this meatloaf!  It was very simple.  I did not have any ranch dip so I used half sour cream and half Ranch Dressing.  Based on some of the reviews of the meatloaf being dry I added 1 TBSP of water.  This ended up being the most moist meatloaf I've ever made!  Thanks Lindsay!

My Family liked this meatloaf recipe, my son won't usually eat meatloaf, but he had seconds!  I used the sourcream, but reduced the bread crumbs to 1 cup.  I will try with the Ranch dip.

This recipe is great! I did however manipulate it just a bit. Thanks to all the reviews, I substituted Ranch dressing for sour cream and because I didn't have onion soup mix on hand, I used Italian dressing mix (dry). Yummy!

This recipe is excellent in a lunchbox. Do you know how I know? I printed,
made and ate the recipe myself. It's a winner for sure, even with the kids.
