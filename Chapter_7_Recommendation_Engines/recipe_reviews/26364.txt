This is delicious.   I followed some of the other reviewers' suggestions.  I browned the beef in a cast iron pot.   I removed beef and set aside while I sauteed chopped onion and mushrooms.  I added large carrots and celery pieces, chopped potatoes, frozen green beans, and frozen peas. (skipped the cabbage)  I cut back broth to 32 oz.  I added about 1 TB Worcestershire sauce also.  I covered the pot and placed in 350 degree oven for at least an hour.  I removed the celery and carrot pieces and pureed them in a blender.  I mixed a little corn starch with the pureed veggies and returned to pot.  This thickened up the stew a bit.   My husband loved it.

Really good!  Don't be afraid to add your own little ingredients here and there.  You can basically add and subtract what you want without ruining the stew.  I cut back on the amount of beef broth by one can.  It made my dish thicker.  I omiited the cabbage completely.  I added 3 tablespoons of Worcestershire sauce and it gave it such a great flavor!!!!  I added a little bit of garlic clove too.  It enhances the stew without making it garlicky.  You won't have any leftovers!

Really good stew.  I have made it a few times adding somethings along the way.  I add celery,crushed garlic and onion.  It is good if you follow the recipe or when you add stuff.

This is a basic stew, so while not spectacular, it's a good starting point. I was a little skeptical of the 6 cups of beef broth (I like my stews thick), so I simply dissolved 2 beef bouillon cubes into one cup of water, and added that in place of all of the beef broth. 
I cooked this in my slow-cooker on high heat for 8 hours.

This is the best ever beef stew.  I took out the cabbage and changed the mixed vegetables to one bag of frozen peas and one bag of frozen green beens (both 16 oz. each) and added three sliced fresh carrots.

Very runny. Almost a soup.  I'd recommend either halving the water, doubling the cooking time or making this with dumplings.

This is an AWESOME recipe! I was in a tizzy over what to make for dinner one night, and came across this receipe. It's such a hearty, filling soup, and I added mushrooms & a few spices that made it extra tasty. So easy to make, as well! My husband absolutely ranted and raved about how much he liked this dish. A real winner!!

I wanted to make a beef stew but only had ingredients for this recipe. It was easy to make. Very quick. I subbed veggie juice for tomato juice. And I added fresh carrots instead of frozen. It tasted good and everyone in my family liked it.

I love this - it's so simple to make and tastes great. I added some onion (sauteed in butter first), used diced tomatoes, and used fresh vegetables instead of frozen. The cabbage adds a nice flavor.

I was looking for a recipe that used V8. I could not find it! I made an amazing stew years ago with v8. Anyway, I used three different recipes for this one. Sautéed onion with the floured meat, did not drain, added all the veggies, including celery, onion, garlic, carrots, added 29 fl. oz/ of V8. Plus about 6 knorr bullion cubes and water (8 cups) you need a big pot. Add water  needed, or not. If it's too thin add a potato or two. It needs to cook for at least an hour, two would be better. They key is to sauté the beef in flour and simmer for hours. YUM

Very good easily prepared stew. Needs a few modifications. Beef Broth adds a bit too much saltiness. Probably needs about half as much broth with water being substituted. Stew beef is ok but use of more tender cut would be better do to short cooking time. Fresh carrots help and one small onion. Still a good basic with just a few changes up to the individual.

I didn't like it at all.  My husband loves most beef stews and he said it was "okay" to make me feel better about all the time spent making it (exactly by the recipe).  He took the leftovers to work for lunch, but he might have done that just to avoid wasting so much food.  We won't be making this again.

Really good flavor! I made mine in a cast iron dutch oven. I'm wondering if I should've left it uncovered to cook though. It had so much broth and never thickened up at all. More like soup than stew definitely.

I don't like mixed veggies, so just added additional cabbage.  A little onion also adds great flavor.  I rarely rank recipes, but this one has hit our "regular" dinner line up.  It's quite a treat when you find that kind of recipe.  : )

Very good minestrone type of soup!  I did about 2/3 of the broth, added 1 can of stewed tomatoes, 1/8 c. worcestershire, doubled the cabbage and potatoes, and garlic salt.

Best Ever Beef Stew Haiku: "Just had to make this, due to its boastful title. And it turned out great!" After browning the meat, I put everything in the crock-pot, reducing the beef broth (didn't want it too liquid-ey), and only adding some minced garlic. For some reason, the smell wasn't all that appetizing, but wow, it tasted pretty great, and the leftovers were even better.

This is a great basic stew recipe.  I use a can of tomato soup instead of tomato juice and coat the beef in flour when browning.  I also used just water instead of broth but I think it's a great idea. The flour then acts as a thickener for those who like a more stewy stew rather than a soupy stew. Great with some fresh or sour dough bread.
