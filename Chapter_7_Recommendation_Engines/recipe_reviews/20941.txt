Good recipe.  I added crushed pineapple, real bacon bits, and sunflower seed kernels, used 1 cup mayo plus 1 T white vinegar and 1 T sugar instead of bottled dressing.

I love how easy and delicious this recipe is!  Pistacios were too hard to find so I replaced with pecans and also tried with slivered almonds and both were great.  I also added 1 large cubed Granny Smith apple for added crunch and tartness.  I found that over time the salad becomes a tad bit soggy so hold back on some of the dressing at the beginning and add more if it needs it before you serve.

I love broccoli slaw and it is one way to "hide" the veggies! I also make another version using the slaw mix, poppy seed dressing, pineapple chunks, raisins and sunflower seeds.  YUM!

Really delicious, unique, and a little more gourmet.  The pistachios and dried cranberries (I substituted dried cherries) were creative additions that gave this such a different, nice flavor.  Not wanting to use a bottled dressing, I used "Easy Delicious Old Fashioned Cole Slaw Dressing," also from this site.  One recipe was just the right amount for this slaw recipe, scaled down to four servings.  No one at the dinner table tonight (including me) is a big fan of cole slaw, but they (including me) sure liked this one!

Delicious as is - I wouldn't change a thing! I do recommend letting the slaw sit for severla hours before eating it....it really brings all of the flavors together.

This is a great side dish to take along when going to a family gathering.  You can make it ahead and not have to worry about last minute preparations.  I use one full 12 ounce jar of Marie's Cole Slaw dressing because it is fresh and very creamy, it blends well.

Made this side dish for a cookout yesterday and it was a hit.  I like the sweet and crunchy taste of this dish.  I used a bottle of Marie's Coleslaw Dressing.  This dish is tasty and easy to prepare.

Oh my, shelling the pistachios sure took a long time, BUT it was worth it! This is a great salad. I served it at a large backyard party we gave, and everyone loved it! I love serving dishes with unexpected ingredients, in this case the pistachios and cranberries. I was also able to make this the day before adding only the pistachios just before serving to keep them crunchy. I used Marie Calandar's cole slaw dressing. What a great side to grilled meat on a summer day! Thanks!

So simple and tasty. Made it for two events in a row at the request of my guests! Tastes best if you make it the night before except add the pistachios just before serving so they don't get mushy.

I really liked this. I made my own broccoli slaw with leftover broccoli stems, red cabbage, and carrots in my food processor and my own dressing with mayo, vinegar, sugar, and celery seed. I absolutely LOVED the crasins in this. I had to sub sunflower seeds for the pistachios (too expensive). I will make this again. I served it with broiled tilapia parmesan and orzo rice pilaf, also from this site.

This is the, hands-down, best broccoli slaw recipe I've ever seen or tasted! Colorful and Delicious!! I made it for a ladies' luncheon (enough for 60 servings!) and it got rave reviews - many who said they didn't like broccoli, but LOVED the salad and wanted the recipe to use at home with their families!  I couldn't find pistachio nuts the day I was shopping (shelled or unshelled), so I used cashews instead...and it was still the best! I made the slaw a day and a half ahead to let the flavors blend...adding the dried cranberries the night before and the cashews just prior to serving.  There was nothing left for me to take home!  WOW!  I love this recipe and will use it again and again and again!  Thank you for sharing it!!!!

This was VERY good.  I used 15oz of dressing and 36oz of slaw mix and that was a good dressing/mix ratio.  Added pistachios right before serving.

Really easy way to jazz up broccoli slaw... I used sunflower seeds with the cranberries; it was easy and tasted great! I also found that I didn't need the entire bottle of dressing- I think that would have been way too heavy. This is a easy summer recipe :)

Delicious! The store didn't have the slaw mix, but I used one bunch of broccoli and 1 grated carrot, and was pleased. For the dressing, I mixed equal amounts of low-fat mayo and sour cream, a squirt of mustard, splashes of lemon juice and vinegar, plus a lot of celery salt and some seasoning salt. Very enjoyable, and even better after it sits overnight.

I changed the dressing to Pepper Mill Mango Chardonnay. Added shaved carrots and minced shallots. Also added dried cranberries and chopped cashews. Remember the sea salt and white pepper.

I changed the recipe a little and made my own dressing by mixing 1 cup of mayo with 3 tbsp. of sugar and 3 tbsp. of white wine vinegar.  I also used rasins and cashews instead of the cranberries and pistachios.  I think you could probably use alot of different nuts or dried fruit according to your taste.

I love this recipe and sometimes add turkey or chicken to make it more of a heavier salad.  Trader Joes has shelled pistacios so you don't have to waste time shelling. Cashews work well too!

What an interesting recipe!  I enjoyed it, but only made half a recipe as I'm cooking for just me.  I couldn't eat it all very quickly, so the pistachios got soggy and lost their crunch.  Also, I could only find pistachios in shells, so I had to spend quite a while shelling pistachios.

This recipe is a version of the broccoli salad that uses the chopped broccoli head, sunflower seeds and raisins. 
This recipe is a nice change from that. Love the cranberry-pistachio combination. I toasted the pistachios first to intensify thier flavor.
Super easy to put together.

This was rather good.  I've never tried the broccoli slaw.  My husband didn't even know it was broccoli until I told him.  I only bought a 12 oz bag.  I added about 3/4 cup of pistachios and a little less than 1/2 a cup of craisins.  I just added cole slaw dressing until it looked good - about half a 12oz bottle of Marie's original cole slaw dressing.  I will make this again.

I make this recipe often too, but use vinegar and oil instead of bottled cole slaw dressing.  I've also added walnuts or almonds, but pistacio nuts would be good too.  This recipe is easy, healthy and delicious.

Loved the tangy crunch of slaw with bites of sweet cranberries! Served this along with Byrdhouse Easy Ginger Beef Sandwiches from AR. Delicious.

Love it. I didn't have time for pistacios so I substituted with sunflower seeds and bacon. Really nice combination. Since I used microwaveable bacon it only took me 5 minutes to make!

Great recipe, thanks!  I could only  find a 12 oz. bag of broccoli slaw, so I used 2 of those and a 16 oz. bottle of T. Marzetti's cole slaw dressing, it turned out perfectly! Thanks again!

I took this to a potluck on Memorial Day and every one loved it.  I did have some left over and served for dinner a couple of times.  My husband even ate large servings and I have a real struggle to get him to eat salad.  I will be making this a lot more often just for us.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.  The only thing I did different wast to substitute cashews for the pistachios.  Couldn't find any at the store where I was shopping.

I'm pretty sure this recipe has ruined coleslaw for me.  This broccoli slaw is soooo much better!  I added shredded carrots, chose to use roasted peanuts over pistachio nuts, and used high quality dried cranberries purchased from the health food bins at my grocery store.  There is no need to use sweetened cranberries, the coleslaw dressing is sweet enough (I used Marie's bottled coleslaw dressing).  I finished the dish with a little celery seed, and oh my goodness, it was fantastic.  Hearty, nutty, substantial food that makes a wimp out of coleslaw.

I used a 12 oz. box of broccoli coleslaw, added Craisins to taste, Marie's coleslaw dressing, and chopped almonds since I had no pistachios. Absolutely delicious! Made a marvelous side for our grilled chicken.

Delicious!  Measurements were different between recipe and what I found at the grocery store-- 2x 12 oz broccoli slaw packages, 6 oz shelled pistachios, 6 oz dried cranberries, 12 oz Marie's cole slaw dressing.  Perfect combo together!

This is a very tasty alternative to coleslaw!  The cranberries and green broccoli and pistachios made it perfect for a Christmas get-together.  I'm a little picky about dressings, but I used a bottle of Marie's found in the produce section as other reviewers had recommended, and it was delicious!  I made it a day ahead and forgot to reserve the pistachios until serving, but they were fine.  I will say that some of the picky guests may not have chosen it since I didn't tell anyone what was in it.  The pistachios look a little like shriveled grapes.  So a nice little sign announcing what it is might be helpful.  I liked it so much I'm planning to make it for Christmas.  My 8-year-old granddaughter should enjoy making it with me since it doesn't involve cooking.  You won't be disappointed with this low-carb selection!

First time trying broccoli slaw - not as soft a texture as cabbage-based slaw.  Fine, but kind of bland.  I used low fat poppy seed dressing - maybe I needed something thicker.

I didn't have dried cranberries, but used dried cherries that I had on hand. Also used pine nuts instead, as that is what I had on hand also. I know, people don't yell about changing the recipe, but it is to let you know you can think outside the box, If you don't have the exact ingredients.

I have been making this for years and it has always been very well received.  My original recipe called for Brianne's Poppy Seed dressing, but just about any cole slaw or poppy seed dressing will do.  Also, you can sub any dried fruit (blueberries, cherries, raisins equally well.  Try it!

This recipe is so easy and turns out great.  There are so many options for healthy dressings, you can really keep the calories and fat at great levels.  I made it with Guy Fieri's Carolina slaw dressing and used only the 12 oz that were in the jar and it was awesome.  Also tried it with almonds instead of pistachios, not as tasty but still good.  Pecans would also work well.

Easy peasy.... And great.... I didn't have  coleslaw dressing, so I used miracle whip with a dash of water to water it down.... Did the trick... Will try it with slaw dressing next time...

This is a great recipe, it's easy but also unique.  I add some blue cheese just to step up the taste a little.  My boyfriend has veggie phobias but will eat this salad so that says a lot.

This was a good basic recipe.  A nice jumping off spot to try other things and build your own slaw.  I really enjoyed the cranberries in it

Absolutely a 5 star!  Had family over for dinner, was hoping to have a little left over.  There was, but it was so good I couldn't help but share.  Will make again this weekend.
