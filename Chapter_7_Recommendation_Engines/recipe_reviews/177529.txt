I would actually give it 4 1/2 stars.  I liked it a lot, my husband thought it could use more flavor. Certainly easy and good for you too.

HAD THIS AT MY DAUGHTER'S TONIGHT AND IT Was VERY GOOD. I REALLY ENJOYED ALL THE VEGETABLES, CHICKEN AND PASTA MIXED TOGETHER.

Tried this on my family thinking it would be a quick, healthy, toddler friendly meal.  The sauce was very bland, and too heavy on the basil for our tastes.  Maybe some tweaking would brighten it up a bit but we won't be trying it again.
