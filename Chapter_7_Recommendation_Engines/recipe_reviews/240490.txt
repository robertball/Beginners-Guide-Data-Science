To satisfy DH, I made this without the hot sauce, but sprinkled some on my portion. It was delicious with and without the hot sauce!  Great recipe!  Thanks for sharing!

Problem with the cooking time in the recipe. I cooked it for 1 hour and the black eyed peas were still hard. If all ingredients were precooked maybe recipe as written would work out.
