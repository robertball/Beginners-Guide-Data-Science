We love this pizza. I make mine with a crescent roll crust and instead of chipotle chili powder, I add in a good amount of homemade barbeque rub. If I have it, I'll sprinkle some shredded sharp cheddar or pepperjack cheese over the top. My boys will usually eat a whole pizza in one sitting.

We love, love, love this recipe!  In fact, my husband just had to share a picture on Twitter of the slices I gave him, because he was very excited about how this tasted.  I used the "Quick and Easy Pizza Crust" recipe from this site (with lots of extra herbs in the dough).  I made a few small changes to the toppings that put this beyond 5 stars:  1) Instead of seasoning the BBQ sauce with chipotle chili powder, I spread the sauce and then lightly sprinkled some cayenne pepper and some garlic powder on top.  2)  After the sauce and seasonings, I put an even layer of grated parmesan cheese on top.  3) Then, I put an extra 2T of BBQ sauce on top of the pulled pork layer, b/c I knew it would dry out a bit in the oven. (Don't skip this extra step - it's important!)  4) Sprinkled shredded cheddar on top (b/c pizza doesn't seem right without cheese).  5) Finally, I brushed the outer crust with a mixture of olive oil & garlic powder.  I can't wait to make this recipe again!

Hi this is the author of this recipe and I wanted to note we add and remove different ingredients for this pizza all the time it is so easy to customize. Just recently we added mozzarella, bacon, red onion, red bell pepper and cilantro and it was great. I now always add cheese but still make a no cheese option for the dairy intolerant. I also found if you like it spicy and don't want to mix your own bbq sauce that Trader Joe's Bbq sauce has just a good amount of kick straight in the bottle.

This was a great way to use up leftover pulled pork! I used a crock pot and cooked 2 lb pork butt with 1 jar of Trader Joe's Bold and Spicy bbq sauce for sandwiches. I used the leftovers for this and added shredded cheese and cilantro. No chipotle powder, so I used garlic powder instead.

I was looking for a way to use up leftover Pulled Pork.  I had Pillsbury Pizza Crust in the fridge, so decided on this recipe.  I coated the top of the crust with the BBQ sauce / chili power blend.  Topped with pulled pork, finely chopped red pepper and......finely chopped fresh pineapple (recommend by several reviewers).  I do love pineapple on my pepperoni pizza. I omitted the onion, because I didn't want it to clash with the pineapple. 
Then I sprinkled a little pizza cheese on top before putting in the oven.  Oh my goodness!  This was delicious.  I will definitely make again.

I have made this three times and it is a hit every time. It is easy to save some pork BBQ and sauce from one meal and make it into this meal the next time. I add pineapple to this pizza but the dill pickles are what really make this pizza very good. I have made this on breadmaker pizza crust dough and also on Focaccia bread cut in half. Both came out very well. The trick to a good pizza with dough is a really hot oven. 500 degrees at 15 minutes is what works well for me. It makes the crust crunchy, which is what we like. If the temp is too low, it is doughy.

Amie, thanks for the great recipe! We loved it! I was searching for something to do with almost a whole pork loin that I cooked too long and was quite dry and here you were! I used a quick homemade pizza crust recipe from this site (which was awesome!) and thinly sliced my pork loin then put some bbq sauce on it and a little water and nuked it to rehydrate it. I did add a little bit of sriracha sauce to my bbq sauce to give it a little bite before spreading it on that delicious Italian seasoned crust and topped with the pork, thinly sliced purple onion and red peppers and thin slices of sharp cheddar. It was divine! Hubby wants to try it with pineapple next time! Oh and this looked as beautiful and yummy as it tasted. Including the homemade no rise crust cook time was only about 1 1/2 hours from start to finish. If you read this, don't think about it - "Just Do It"!

I was looking for an alternative to use left over pulled pork. Amazing! I made the pizza dough with recipe suggestion on the back of the "pizza yeast" package. The dough made a 16" pizza; the amount of ingredients used was increased. Sauteed the onion and peppers together on the stove (in small amount of pork juices) until soft, then added the pulled pork, warmed. I kept the mixture on the dry side. Added some mozzarella cheese, baked for 16 minutes.  Kids and husband loved it!

Impossible to give a pizza recipe that doesn't call for cheese 5 stars, but it was pretty good overall.  I prefer more sauce as well.

I was looking for something to make with what I had and did a search with pulled pork and this came up. I had some prepared pulled pork with bbq sauce already mixed in and also found baked naan bread. So, I just used that. Since the pork already had bbq sauce, I just added the red onion and red bell pepper. I also baked it as suggested. I have always liked the bbq chicken pizzas, so this was a bit too salty to me, compared to that. I also couldn't help but miss the cheese on a pizza. It didn't seem like a pizza to me but more like a flat bbq sandwich.
