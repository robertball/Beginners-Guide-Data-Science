I was looking for a no-cook recipe to use some zucchini and this fit the bill.  The first time I made this exactly as written and it was good, although a bit wet.  The second time I made it, I tossed the shredded zucchini and cucumbers in a salad spinner and spun out some of the moisture - made a huge difference!  This recipe is easily adapted to any taste.  I've substituted italian dressing mix for the ranch dressing mix.  This is delicious with ripe tomatoes, and the addition of leftover cubed ham, smoked turkey, grilled shrimp, grilled salmon or mahi mahi. I use fat-free miracle whip in lieu of mayo and set the "additions" up buffet-style on the counter.  Everyone can add whatever they like.  This is a great summertime lunch or light dinner.  Thanks, Vickie!

This is so good with a whole wheat tortilla or pita bread!
It gets pretty soupy as it sits so I would recommend eating it fairly quickly. 
Great recipe!

A great way to use up the cukes/zucchini in the garden. I didn't have ranch dressing mix and used Old Bay seasoning and didn't use the pepper. A very creative sandwich filling, especially with fresh sliced tomatoes.

My son liked this for lunchtime sandwich!  It makes a better sandwich spread than a side salad.  Use the amount of mayonnaise you are comfortable with.  Be prepared to add extra Ranch seasoning because the zucchini and cucumbers are rather bland.  I think that the next time I make this, I might use pesto in the recipe!

Good base recipe. Ive made this twice and Ive used bottled ranch dressing that I had an overabundance of both times. The first time as is its good. When I made this tonight I added in a heavy 1/4 c of shredded red onion. It needs to get cold it says serve immediately.. and you could.. but its better after it has a chance to meld together.  My husband asked if this was the cucumber coleslaw like last time and I think that describes it perfect. A shredded carrot or 2 would also be good. I like that this is easily changeable to what comes out of my garden and crisper.

After shredding the cucumber & zucchin place them in a clean kitchen towel and roll tightly to remove excess water.  Using the mayonnaise and ranch dressing will then still pull out some water so be sure to drain or use a slotted spoon to remove any more water.  One reviewer suggested this as a cole slaw, what a great idea!

I was looking for an easy recipe to use up some of the veggies from my garden. I used a purple bell pepper instead, added salt & pepper, chopped purple onion, and drained chicken from a can. Delicious on some toast with lettuce.

It is a MUST to lightly salt and juice out the water in both veggies. Squeeze and re-squeeze before you add the dressing. I cut the recipe in half and had enough to feed 3-4 servings. My major complaint: too salty. The more you eat of it the more it 'grew on you.'

This was a refreshing salad spread.  I didnt have ranch seasoning so used prepared ranch dressing in place of the mayo & season mix.  I also didnt have green pepper but used green onion instead.  I added a touch of dill seasoning and let it chill as another user stated. It was a bit running, possibly from using the dressing, but overall pretty tasty:)

We really enjoyed this. So refreshing as a summer salad.  A perfect summer dinner with the shrimp added.  I did shred the zucchini, sprinkle with a little salt and let sit in colander for an hour or so to drain much of the moisture.  If it sits to long after it is made, you still need to drain it again.

I just made this recipe and it is delicious!  I doubled the recipe and used 1/2 cup of low-fat Greek yogurt instead of the mayonnaise.  I also drained the vegetable mixture as some others have suggested, added the ranch dressing mix directly to the vegetables, and saved the Greek yogurt to stir in last.  The taste is not bland at all - possibly because I used the full packet of ranch dressing mix in the course of doubling the recipe, but I didn't even add salt or any other seasoning.  Next time, I might try using poblano peppers instead of a green bell pepper, and might also add shredded carrots.  Very simple recipe and very tasty.

A really versatile recipe. We made many different variations of this; added chicken, used horseradish, added tomatoes, etc...

I think I did this one wrong. I like to include the peel on all vegetables for the nutrients. Some said it gets soupy so I tried using cheesecloth to squeeze out the excess moisture. Unfortunately, it was still soupy and the skins...were kind of unpleasant. Will work on this one.

My kids don't like zucchini.  So I presented it to them as a "cucumber salad sandwich". All three loved it and had no idea!  The 11yr old didn't even know. Will definitely make again.

Not much flavor and not a good dish for leftovers. It got very juicy the next day.

I did not care for this recipe.  I had a counterful of garden zucchini and cucumber and thought this would be good to try.  It is bland and tasteless.  I tried to save it with dill, onion flakes and galic, with no success. Will never make this again.
