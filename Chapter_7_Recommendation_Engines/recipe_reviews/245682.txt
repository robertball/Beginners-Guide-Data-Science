To make it more authentic, for a Rwandan, use white sweet potatoes, and don't use chickpeas.  Some areas use them and some don't.  This is a vegetarian recipe, and the reason I like it is that much of east Africa eats mainly vegetarian, and actually much of the world, mainly for economic reasons.  Americans tend to think than all savory main dishes have meat, but that's not true everywhere.

I just realized I forgot to add the garlic, and I still loved it!

I followed the ingredients of this recipe, but left out the green beans. When it was finished cooking, I puréed the entire batch for serving. Flavourful! My daughter had two bowls.  I served it with focaccia bread.

Used vegetable broth in place of water per recommendation of previous reviewer. Served with couscous. Yummy.

Didn't have jalapeno's the first time I made it, but still quite tasty. We might try a half batch next time with the jalapeno and add some meat. Still very good as a vegetarian dish, and nice to have the option to make it either way.

I made this this using only fresh ingredients (with the exception of canned chickpeas) and it came out very good. I used peanut powder instead of peanut butter to keep the fat down and added a great deal more red pepper flakes to increase the heat

I only used one can of chickpeas and one can of tomatoes. I substituted vegetable broth for the water in the recipe. It was great! Would make it again.

I thought it turned out pretty good except that I only have a medium-small crockpot so I had to leave out the second cans of chickpeas and tomatoes and a sweet potato. I liked the flavor level, it was tasty without being too spicy.

Don't look for dessert sweetness, this wonderfully slightly spicy stew is true comfort food of the highest order.  I did add a bit of salt and a dollop of butter at serving, but on the whole it is absolutely delicious.  I took it to an African History Month Luncheon and nothing but raves. Great with sauteed greens!

I tried to make this, following the steps exactly and it did not look anything like the picture (no corn, peas?...) and it was awful.

Didn't add spicy ingredients so my baby could eat it too. Made it in the instant pot- less evaporation than crock pot 12 min high pressure, quick release. In the IP you should either use about 1/2-1 cup less water or i threw in a handful of rice to help thicken the stew.

Really interesting and yummy! The only change I made was using veggie stock instead of water.

I really wanted to like this but it was just missing something. Too sweet for my taste. My husband ate it without complaint but added a lot of chopped raw jalapeño to his.

YUM!!! I made this to the letter except I replaced the water with homemade chicken stock and omitted the canned green beans (Blech!) I'll serve this with rice and top it with a dollop of Greek yogurt and a bit of cilantro. Can't wait to plug in my crock pot in the morning!

Delicious, but needed more peanut butter.  Will change to 1 cup PB next time I make it. We also served it with peanuts for everyone to add on top if they wanted.
We also like things a bit less spicy, so I swapped jalapenos for 4oz mild diced green chilis, and used only a pinch of red pepper flakes.
Kids loved this with rice.  Will make again.

It was as sweet as you might expect from a sweet-potato dish. I added some vegetable bullion, used almond butter instead of peanut butter, and added lots of pepper and cayenne. I also used fresh green beans instead of canned. I will probably make it again (with more spice), but not anytime soon. My 3 yr old liked it (without the chunks).
