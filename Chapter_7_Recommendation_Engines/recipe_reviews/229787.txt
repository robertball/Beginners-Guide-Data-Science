I made this because I was looking for recipes that included leeks.  I'd never really had or made anything with leeks and wanted to give it a try.  I followed the recipe exactly, and they came out great.  I really liked it and thought it would be great to make again for a brunch, holiday lunch, etc.  That was a month ago and I have now made it five times because my husband and 17-year old daughter keep asking for it.  And the recipe is easy enough that my daughter does most of the work when we make it!

The thyme totally overpowers the flavor of the mini-quiche, and you can't even taste the sun dried tomatoes or cheddar.  Also, there was an incredible amount of liquid released by the leeks which was the first layer into the muffin cup.  When removed from the muffin pan, they continued to leak, and my husband said "â€¦this just tastes watery and wet," and that was after blotting each top and bottom with multiple paper towels.   I followed this recipe to the letter, really wanted to like it because I loved how it broke down nutritionally, but it was a disappointment.  Sorry, won't be making this recipe again.

Delicious but I found that pulsing the tomatoes by themselves first worked better and did not over beat the egg.  Thirty minutes was not quite enough as a like eggs to be DONE with no liquid so I added an extra 3 minutes and they cooked perfectly!!

Perfect for a game night with friends where we each bring a unique dish to share. I made one batch with sun-dried tomatoes and one plain batch.

This recipe did not work at all.  After 30 minutes we took them out and they oozed some sort of watery liquid.  Putting them back in for another 5 minutes did nothing to help.  Inedible.
