My battered old 1960s cookbook calls this salad "California Lime Mold", and I agree that the horseradish is essential. 

As for the appearance, I've always added an extra step that gives the salad an airy texture, like a festive mousse.  After the jello is partially set and clinging to the sides of the bowl, just whip the gelatin with an electric beater until quite foamy.  Then fold in the rest of the ingredients thoroughly and pour into a mold or serving dish before the final set.

I have been making this recipe for 40+ years.  My family has always enjoyed it....even the children.  The horseradish gives it an extra "sparkle", and I find it to be especially good when served with ham.

This is a wonderful recipe but I did add one stalk of chopped celery and drained the crushed pineapple. The horseradish gave it a zing to enhance the flavor. I will be making this on a regular basis.

This is a family staple that I’ve had for 50 years. No horseradish and we use walnuts. Never known anyone else to make this. I love it for breakfast! It’s not Thanksgiving without this yummy dish.
