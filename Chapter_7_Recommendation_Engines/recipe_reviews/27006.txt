I took this to an appetizer buffet. Let's just say it was the shining star! I varied the recipe slightly, adding 1 cup sour cream, reducing mayo to 2 Tbsp., and adding 1/4 tsp. basil. I also sprinkled a 4 oz. can of sliced black olives over half the pizza for the olive lovers! I'm still filling requests for the recipe. Thanks, Cindy!

I think the reason this fantastic recipe is overlooked is because it is named "Vegetable Pizza Squares".  I think the name implies a typical pizza-tasting recipe, which this is not.  I also think the recipe lacks directions regarding the presentation.  I followed the recipe exactly (except for the vegetable ingredients).  After the "crust" cooled, I transfered it to a rectangular serving platter (you have to cut it a little to conform to the size of your platter).  I topped it with the cream cheese mixture and then added 1/2 cup chopped fresh broccoli, 1/2 cup shredded carrots and then two handfuls of fresh baby spinach.  I then topped with the cheddar cheese.  Before serving I sliced into squares.  It was so colorful and gourmet-looking.  Everybody loved it!  If someone could post a photo, I think it would help with the popularity of this overlooked recipe.  Thanks Cindy!!!

This is a very yummy recipe. I did make a couple of adjustments though, like using ranch dressing in place of the mayo and seasonings, and also added a variety of vegetables. Thanks!

I halved this recipe, just for my two kids and I. I cut everything in half BUT the spices. I used reduced fat crescent roll dough/cream cheese/mayonnaise but I kept all the spices the same. After I added half of the halved vegetables called for, I didn't feel as if it was enough veggies. I added some halved small cherry tomatoes and quartered zucchini. I've made something like this before--especially during the summer months. I have to say it's one of my most favorite meals. A half recipe makes enough for dinner for the three of us and a small lunch for me the next day. I think the longer this sits, the better it gets. NOTE: Two cans laid on a cookie sheet will almost fill one sheet, if you lay it out horizontally and the sheet is laying long ways up, if that makes sense. Make sure you spritz your baking sheet a little with non stick cooking spray if your sheets have a tendancy to cling to the dough sometimes.

This recipe is always a big hit.  The only change I made was I used garlic powder instead of the minced garlic.  I have also added other types of veggies:  chopped carrots, tomatoes, cucumbers, etc. Very easy to whip up for guests!

Wow, this was great. However, I did follow others' advice: I used lots more vegetables, and I added carrots but omitted cauliflower. I think I used more cheese, too. I think this recipe calls for a small pan, but I used a bigger pan and stretched out the dough rather than having thick dough. Mmmm.

Awesome! Amazing flavor, even with the low fat cream cheese and mayo that I used. 

I increased the quantity of vegetables and added some red peppers for color and taste, but this is a wonderful recipe.

These is an easy, versatile recipe. I made the sauce with the cream cheese, halved the mayo, and added 1/3 cup of sour cream. I'm sure the consistency would have been very similar with all of the mayo, but I had fat free sour cream that I needed to use up. Additionally, I did not have minced onion, so I used onion powder instead. I used the required dill mix and garlic, though. I baked the crescent rolls for exactly ten minutes and spread the sauce on top. For the toppings, I added cauliflower, broccoli, onions, cheese, and a little green pepper. This was really good and easy, and is not bad served room temperature. A more hearty meal could be made by adding some shredded chicken to the top. Great recipe.

I used the recipe for 'Golden crescent rolls' instead of pre-made dough and also used several additional vegetables as toppers. These were delicious!

There are 4 on this site that are all similar. 3 of my friends and I had school functions to go to last week and we each tried one for our own school. Every one of them told me the got rave reviews. If you look at the "More Recipes Like This" link on the recipe page you can find the different recipes and chose one to your liking.

This was really good!  Unfortunately my power was out due to a snowstorm  (I live it Alaska) so I had to try to make the sauce from memory and I screwed it up.  I only put 1/3 cup of mayo and boy was this rich!  Still very good though.  I am sure it would have been perfect if done correctly.

These were very good.  I couldn't quite figure out the two cans, small/or large baking sheet.  One can, jelly roll pan. Walla , Walla, bing bang...After reading all the reviews... Needless to say, I was confused.  So.  I used one can on a baking sheet and pieced the crescent rolls to resemble a rectangular pizza crust.  I baked for 12-15 minutes. I then topped with 1/3 sour cream and 1/3 mayo with the cream cheese. I didn't want to use all mayo because I have a slight taste aversion to mayo. I had no dill weed so I followed someone else's suggestion and used 1/2 package of dry ranch mix.  I smeared the mixture on the on the bottom and I topped with green pepper, grape tomatoes (sliced), chopped broccoli, minced red onion and finally I shredded some carrots on top before adding the cheddar cheese.  I also sprinkled some garlic powder on the top.  Sliced and refrigerated.  Very delicious.  My kids enjoyed it. It's very pretty and colorful.  I felt like fooling around with this recipe so I put a 2nd can in a pie pan and just unrolled all 8 crescent rolls and layed them in the pie pan with the tips overlapping in the middle.  Baked 12-15 minutes.  Same thing... Smeared the cream cheese/mayo/sour cream stuff and topped.  This time I sprinkled the cheddar cheese first and then topped with my veggies.  I actually preferred the rectangular pizza. When I made it in the pie pan the "crust" was more like deep dish.  Will make again using the baking sheet.  Thanks for sharing !

These are great, everyone always loves them. To save time I used a Ranch packet mixed in with the cream cheese (half of the Ranch packet mix). Make sure the cream cheese is room temp. or at least softened a bit. Oh yes, and use green onions. YUM!

I like to use whiped neuftchatel cream cheese (lite cream cheese) and add a little lemon juice and grated or finely sliced lemon vest. Whip smooth add a little skim milk to thin if to stiff to spread. Then I top with finely chopped red, yellow and green pepper, green onion, black olives and capers.
The trick here is similar to making pizza - don't overdo topping amounts - My wife make these for picnics and special occs. They are lite and fluffy and not to fattening. There is never any left overs for these!

I guess a small baking sheet is a jelly roll pan????  Which I think 2 cans of dough is too much.  I used a large cookie sheet and the 2 cans fit nicely, but then I had to make a double batch of the cream cheese mixture.
I think the recipe would work fine as written for a "jelly roll pan", but with only 1 10 oz can of cresent roll dough?
LOL  I tried another veggie pizza recipe from this site which called for ONE can on a LARGE cookie sheet.  Oy vey!  Was good though, typical veggie pizza.  LOL

The pizza squares were delicious and I had everyone ask me for the recipe when I served these at a party.  I used 2-3 times the amount of vegetables on the recipe though and it was a bit messy cutting/serving the squares.

I’d give this recipe 4 stars for taste, but 3 for ease of preparation. The recipe calls for two -10 oz rolls of crescent rolls for a small baking sheet. I found two rolls actually filled up 1 ½ standard baking sheets. The recipe also calls for a 1/2
cup of each kind of veggie, but I needed more like a full cup of each. I also added carrots, onions, and extra cheese to the mix. I refrigerated these overnight and the crust was soft, but not soggy the next day. These are more time consuming then they look!

I've tried it before when someone brought it to a party.  It's very good. Search allrecipes for "Garden Veggie Pizza Squares" -it's virtually the same recipe and has several pictures and hundreds of reviews.

I use this recipe all of the time. I used to use the recipe with the packet of the ranch dressing.  No more.  I like this.  I put tomatoes on it plus fresh mushrooms as well.  I do use a little bit more mayonnaise.  So good and so easy!
