I really liked this recipe, but I did make a few changes which I think made it even better.  After I browned the chicken breasts I removed them from the pan and sauteed the mushrooms along with 3 cloves of crushed garlic.  I then combined one can of cream of mushroom soup with a cup of marsala wine, then poured the mixture over the chicken I returned to the pan.  I let simmer for 15 minutes, and it was the best I ever had.

I made this for my husband last night and it tasted just like the version from the Macaroni Grill.  I took the advice of many of the previous reviewers and used more mushrooms, including chopped portabello, twice as much Marsala wine (the sweet variety), and slivered garlic added with the mushrooms.  I also simmered the entire thing for 35 minutes covered for the first 20 and then uncovered for the last 15.  In addition, I decided to put in a bit of heavy cream at the end, which I figured couldn't hurt!

Wow, what a recipe!  I really didn't think it would turn out to be so tender and juicy, but it was.  So many chicken recipes turn out dry, but this one was just wonderful.  Made my kitchen smell awesome!  I made it with rosemary potatoes and fresh green beans.  What a meal!  Thanks for the recipe!

I've made this recipe numerous times. I like tripling the marsala wine and adding equal parts chicken broth. 5 minutes before serving I add cornstarch to thicken. Serve over linguine. I've made with the chicken breast whole and as strips. Love this recipe!!

Oh, this was just excellent! My boyfriend and I couldn't get enough. The chicken was juicy and tender, the sauce nice and light. I added a tablespoon of minced garlic and about 1/2 cup of extra mushrooms. I served it with steamed spinach and a garlic mashed potatoes recipe I found on this site. I doubled the sauce (but still only used 1 tablespoon of butter) so I would have enough to spoon over the chicken and the potatoes. I will *definitely* be making this one again. 

The sauce is pretty thin, so you'll need to add a little cornstarch/water to thicken it. If you feel there is too much of an "alcohol" taste, just add a couple tablespoons of chicken broth to dilute it. I always do. Also, try adding a little bacon grease to the sauce sometime. (although it will defeat the purpose of having a "light" chicken marsala recipe) It really gives it a smooth, almost creamier taste.

Thanks for the wonderful recipe!

I cooked this for four last night and everyone loved it! I added in minced garlic and onions to the butter, and it gave it a good flavor. I doubled the marsala wine, and it made a perfect amount of extra gravy for the angel hair pasta. Delicious!! Thank you!

The 5 star rating on this recipe didn't lie!!  It was wonderful! My friend who hates mushrooms, ate every single one.  You definitely need to add more marsala wine as there was not enough gravy at all.  I only made 2 chicken breasts with this recipe had increased marsala wine to 1 cup.  We still ran low since it cooked down so much.  I will add 2 cups next time.  The recommendation to let it simmer for 30 minutes was perfect.  If you don't the wine doesn't cook down.  YUMMY! YUMMY! YUMMY! Served over angel hair pasta and used canned mushrooms.

LOVE this recipe.  Even my husband, who is not a chicken eater normally, loves this recipe.  I only have a few adjustments:  I brown the chicken in onions and minced garlic, I double or even triple the amount of Marsala and more than double the amount of mushrooms (because I LOVE mushrooms).  Other than that - this recipe is VERY tasty!!  I've already made it three times.  Thank you SO much for the recipe!!

MAde this tonight for my family of 5, this was wonderful! Made it in no time,even with hungry babies at my feet.

I made some changes do to other comments I has read. . I tripled the wine,and added 3 cups chicken broth. and at the end of cooking added some half and half to make it smooth and creamy(great touch!) and some cornstarch to thicken.

 I had left over sauce,from a whole box of angel hair pasta,perfect! 
I chopped,green oinions fresh mushrooms,and garlic and lightly suateed so not to cook to much, then added to the sauce.

Made angel hair pasta,and cheesey garlic bread with it..PERFECT! FAST! EASY!

I made this chicken for a party I was having for 60 people.  Everyone thought it was wonderful!  I had to add 1/2 c chicken broth to make enough sauce.

This recipe is FANTASTIC!  Definitely "company worthy".  :)  I followed the advice of the "most helpful" reviewer: after browning the chicken, I removed it from the pan and sauteed the mushrooms with about 4 cloves of crushed garlic and one onion (minced).  I combined one can of cream of mushroom soup with a cup of marsala wine, and poured that mixture over the chicken I returned to the pan, and simmered the whole thing for 15 minutes.  And there is enough extra sauce to pour over potatoes or rice or pasta.  Super yummy, thanks D.!  :)

Your chicken marsala's only as good as the wine.  Get  quality marsala wine, and start with a 1/4 cup.  Add to taste.  If you get a strong batch or you accidentally add too much, add cream of mushroom soup. (You may want to plan on doing this anyway... it's a nice touch.)

Fabulous recipe!  Sooo easy to make and tastes so good.  Not only that, it looks great too!  Next time I think I'll add a pinch of salt to the flour mixture though.  I sauteed fresh garlic with the butter and olive oil and that worked great.  I only cooked 2 chicken breasts and had barely enough sauce.  Next time I'll double the marsala wine and mushrooms as recommended.

Excellent recipe!  I followed the helpful suggestions by previous reviewers to sautee the mushrooms with garlic before adding the chicken, add more wine to make more sauce, and to cook longer in order to get rid of the alcohol smell (I simmered for 30 minutes).  The result was a quick and easy dinner that my husband and guests absolutely loved!

What a great recipe!!!  I too added 1/4 cup cooking sherry.  I didn't have garlic salt so I used garlic powder.  However, based on my experience with other Chicken Marsala recipes, after adding the wine & sherry I simmered it for 20 minutes to reduce the "alcoholic taste".  And it was fantastic!!! It's a keeper!!  Thanks for sharing!!

I made this for the first time for my family with a few changes recommended by others reviews (simple changes, like adding mushrooms and using whipping cream). We all found it to be remarkably good and me as the beginner chef found it to be a very simple dish to make.

Nothing short of outrageous and sooo easy!!! Thank you submitter!  I was only cooking two breasts but kept all the ingredients for the sauce for 4 as it was.  I also removed the chicken after browning and cooked the mushrooms with minced garlic on its own then added back the chicken and added the marsala.  I followed the recipe and only cooked it for 10 min. which was on the mark.  (Although I did pound out my chicken breasts a bit since they were very thick.)  Served it with garlic mashed potatoes and broccoli in butter sauce.  Would use this recipe for company!  Oh, I also added a bit of heavy cream to the sauce at the end and let it thicken a bit - but it isn't necessary.

I thought this recipe was okay, but I didn't really think it was that great. My boyfriend really isn't that picky, but even he wouldn't eat it. He ACTUALLY made his own dinner instead. I wouldn't make it again.

Excellent and very easy recipe.  I added more mushrooms because we love them!  Serve over wild rice or egg noodles.  Add more wine to make extra sauce for the noodles!

I have tried numerous chicken Marsala recipes on this site because it is my husband's favorite dish, but none of them have lived up to his expectations except for this one (including a recipe for one from a famous Italian restaurant)!

I would definitely make this again, but next time I would use fresh garlic, more mushrooms and absolutely double the sauce ingredients.  I had just enough sauce to cover two breasts, so I have two leftover breast with very little sauce.  Also, I thickened the sauce before putting the chicken back in, was a little too soupy for me. I cooked the chicken and mushrooms separately and than added back in once the sauce was bubbling. 
Otherwise, taste was exactly as I expected.

Keeps the chicken very moist.  Pound it flat first so that you don't overcook and dry it out!  The mushrooms are the best part, I add a whole bunch.

This was just excellent! The chicken was juicy and tender, the sauce nice and light. I added a tablespoon of minced garlic and about 1/2 cup of extra mushrooms. (as suggested in other reviews) I served it with lightly pan fried Brussels sprouts over rice. I will be making this one again. The sauce is pretty thin, so you'll need to add a little cornstarch/water to thicken it.

This recipe is so tasty and so easy to cook.  My family ate every bite and begged for more.  I did use more marsala (1 cup) and added corn starch to thicken the sauce.  It was wonderful!  Thanks so much for this delicious recipe.

My fiance and I absolutely LOVED this dish.  We think that it was definitely a restaurant-quality Chicken Marsala (even more delicious!)  What was even better was the fact that this is a very inexpensive dinner.  As others have mentioned earlier, we doubled the sauce so that we could pour it over mashed potatoes.  We also put in as many mushrooms as we had because we love them!  Thanks for a great recipie!

Made this for a work potluck - and it was a hit!  Used a bit of butter with the olive oil when browning the chicken for flavor.  First time making Chicken Marsala and this recipe is a keeper!

This is a definite 5 star dish. Changes that I made did not really impact the quality and superb palate pleasure of each and every bite. I used boneless chicken thighs instead of breast. Added a little thyme to the coating mixture. Sauteed a small red onion and 4 cloves fresh chopped garlic. Lightly brown the chicken and finished everything off in the oven for approx 35 mins @ 350 degrees. Oh and did not use the butter called for. Just OO. Excellent, Excellent, Excellent

while it was delicious, it had very little sauce, that's why i'm only giving it 4 stars.  i even tried adding more marsala wine and a tbsp of cream to make more sauce, but still not enough sauce.  it was, VERY, VERY good though!

Very good....a very elegant meal.  I did double mushrooms and wine and used extra sauce to spoon over wild rice.

I made this without any changes for myself because it's Gluten-free that way, but for my friends and family, I made it with the cream of mushroom soup and a full cup of Marsala wine, per Daboogs' review, and that really was much better.  I rated it 4 because I think it really needs the changes to be rated a 5.

Always a crowd favorite. I always double the sauce and increase the mushrooms.  I added some cream and didn't find that it helped much, I'd rather go au natural!

This is a very tasty, easy and quick recipe.  I usually omit the wine, just because I rarely have it and substitute chicken broth.  I up the liquid, because it cooks down so much, you really need more.

I just made this last night and thought it was a very good and easy recipe.  I pounded the chicken breasts which made the chicken very tender and also made it cook faster.  I let the chicken simmer (covered) for 10 minutes as stated in the recipe.  I then removed the cover and let it simmer for an additional 10 minutes to thicken the sauce.  I used 3/4 cup of marsala wine instead of 1/2 cup.  I will be experimenting with this recipe and will definitely make it again.  Overall it is a very good recipe.

Yummy, this is a great fast and easy recipe. I did double the wine amount, plus add another tablespoon of butter and 1/2 tsp minced garlic when I added the mushrooms. Delicious and great served over pasta! I will definitely make this again.

I use a little rosemary and I add beef broth (and extra marsala) as necessary to stretch out the gravy/glaze. And TONS of sauteed sliced mushrooms & onions. It really is so good over angel hair pasta.

I love Chicken Marsala, and this is the best one I've made yet.  I like that it uses oregano and not rosemary.  I also like that you cook the chicken in the marsala wine, instead of removing the chicken once cooked and adding the wine to make a sauce separately.  The chicken came out so juicy this way.  Definitely a keeper.

Just ok. Maybe it was the Holland House marsala wine that was just ok? Easy, yes, but a very bland, boring version of Chicken Marsala if you ask me.

This was good, I added double the mushrooms and wine and threw in some sun-dried tomatoes too.  I added some garlic but could have used some more as the flavor of the sauce was still rather light.
Next time I'll add a little more wine as I felt I still didn't have enough for my pasta!

I cheated and used dry white wine, and I still loved the taste.  I pounded the breasts a little before flouring to make more even pieces.  It was quite and easy, but tasted like I took a lot of time.  I served this with rice and asparagus.  Only down side is that my son hates mushrooms.

This is one of the best Chicken Marsala recipes that I have tried. The chicken was nice and moist, the sauce was flavorful and savory, and the mushrooms were cooked to perfection. My whole family loved this recipe and my husband asked me to make it again. Thank you for sharing this recipe!

LOVE IT, LOVE IT! This recipe is so easy and taste so great I want to slap my momma! I preseason my chicken to give it a little kick then browned it. I took it out of the pan like others suggested and sauted the garlic, onion and mushrooms separately and then added the chicken and wine.

Wow!  I made this last night.  Like the others suggested I took the chicken out of the pan after frying it, and then put the mushrooms in and cooked them before adding the chicken back.  I agree that you could use more mushrooms.  My picky 9 year old cleaned his plate!! We'll definately make this again!!

This is the marsala recipe I use all the time.  I tweaked it a little bit to my liking.  I cook the mushrooms in a separate pan because I found that they didn't cook all the way with the original recipe.  When the chicken is done cooking I add the mushrooms to that pan so they can saute with the marsala sauce.  I also add one cube of beef bullion right before I cover the dish and I use extra marsala wine.

This is a great recipe with some tweaking, I am sure it would have been great as is but here is what I did...  I added mustard powder and doubled the garlic to the chicken coating. Pan fried the chicken for a few minutes each side in just a bit of olive oil.  Sauteed onions and mushrooms separately so they remained crisp. I did not have any marsala so I used sherry instead...I poured generously and let the alcohol evaporate, then added vegetable stock (not a cube but of the paste variety). After it simmered for 10 minutes or so and I was sure the chicken was cooked, I whisked in a couple teaspoons of flour and 1/4 cup or so of milk.  Outstanding! Perfectly thick but not too creamy.  Served over penne with salad. Yum!

Didn't bread my chicken tenderloins; sauteed the chicken with some fresh garlic, increased the Marsala because we love that flavor. Finished off with a bit of heavy whipping cream; served over mashed potatoes. Good dish.

Overall, this was a pretty good recipe. I didn't have garlic salt so I used seasoned salt instead. I also used white wine in place of the marsala. This may have made the sauce a little thinner than it should be. Also, when cooking the chicken in the wine at the end, I would recommend not covering the pan, because this tends to make the chicken tough. Next time, I'll definitely try it with the marsala wine. Thanks for sharing!

This is a great tasting and super easy meal to make (even for those of us who are culinary challenged :) ). I love onions, so I added about 1/2 cup of sweet onion to the recipe, and it tasted awesome.  Highly recommended! Thanks

This is very tasty. I made it for my bf and another couple.  Served with gnocchi and arrabbiatta sauce by Ellen (also from this site).  This recipe is very similar to the "chicken marsala" recipe by Lisa.  Both are basically the same, except that this one requires a couple less ingredients (i.e. no cooking sherry, less butter and EVOO).  The only things I did different were a) purchased pounded chicken cutlets (scaloppine, I think the cut is called?) and b) added fresh minced garlic to the skillet in addition to seasoning each breast with garlic salt (just didn't seem to be enough garlic for my taste without doing so).  Overall good recipe.  Thanks!

The flavor of this recipie was great! I followed the directions exactly,but if you are serving four, then there is definatly not enough sauce! next time i will increase the marsala wine to 2 cups! but it would of been great if there was enough sauce.

I made this on Saturday night for a dinner party of 16.  It was pretty easy to make.  I did add in some corn starch at the end to thicken up the sauce.  However, I felt like it was missing something.  Wasn't flavorful enough for me.  Would add more salt and/or garlic to spice it up a bit.

This was very good. Took the suggestions of others and doubled the Marsala, also added minced garlic. Remember though, if you double the Marsala to also slightly increase your flour to maintain the consistency. We loved it. Thank you!

Delicious! Upon other's suggestions, I made these alterations:
Half the butter and olive oil, double the marsala, a few pinches more garlic salt, pepper, and oregano. I also added a clove of garlic to olive oil and butter and sauteed prior to adding the chicken. The most important step for subtle marsala flavor is to let simmer for about 30 minutes with about 4 tablespoons of chicken broth. It did not at all taste like alcohol and I loved the way the mushrooms soaked up the flavor. Wonderful!

This recipe was so ridiculously easy (and tasty) that even I (a mere beginner cook) didn't mess it up. I suggest using chicken tenderloins instead of chicken breasts...w/the tenderloins, the chicken is so soft that it practically melts in your mouth.

This was very good.  I pounded the chicken between was paper as I like my chicken thin.  I had to fry in 2 batches and kept the chicken warm in the oven until all were done.  I have made several versions of Chicken Marsala and this was good for a low-fat version. I also used Soy Flour to reduce calories.

This is by far the best Chicken Marsala my husband and I have ever had. I did add 3/4 beef broth so we would have some extra sauce. I am sure this will be in my husbands dinner list from now on.

Yum!  This was so easy and tasted just delicious!  One thing I did to make more sauce was to add 3/4 cup marsala wine and 3/4 cup beef broth.  I also added extra mushrooms (portobello work great!) b/c my husband and I love them so much.  I am passing this on to all my friends!

My husband loves when I make this recipe. He believes it's better than any restaurant. The only thing I do differently is add more mushrooms and marsala wine. We love mushrooms so I usually double the amount of both the mushrooms and the wine.

This was really good and really easy. It was a bit too oily and i even cut the butter in half. I didnt add mushrooms but did add crushed garlic. The smell was incredible. In the end i added about 2 or 3 tbs of heavy cream....Mmmm, I love this dish. I served it with garlic mashed potatoes but next time it will be some sort of pasta.  This recipe was easy and definetly worth giving a shot. **UPDATE**  I made this again using a different Marsala wine. What a HUGE difference. Make sure you use a good quality wine. I used one that wasnt the greatest and thats exactly how my dish came out. It was ok, but if i had never made it before and didnt know how good it could be, i would never make again.

This was awesome, as my son puts it, it is his favorite recipe.  Very much like the one they serve at the Olive Garden, and very easy. My son begs for it once a week, and he's even made most of it on his own. If you want to impress someone with your cooking talents, make this one.  You'll both get rave reviews.

Delicious - smells good, looks good and tastes rich!  I'll definitely make this recipe often. The only change I made was to simmer the chicken longer than 10 minutes and at the end I took the chicken out and turned the burner to high to reduce the liquid.

Okay.  I have had this recipe in my allrecipes quick and easy cookbook since 2003 and I have always been intimidated by it.  Because I know that Chicken Marsala is difficult and frankly, I don't like it very much (too salty).  But this... this is so easy and not salty and is so much better.  And yay!  Mushrooms!  This was the best most tender chicken I have ever made.  It is NOT a red Marsala demi glaze, but it is super yummy.  Based on other comments, I doubled the Marsala wine and sautéed both the butter/olive oil and the mushrooms in garlic separate from the chicken.  Otherwise, I changed nothing.  My husband did add salt, but loved it otherwise and said that he would probably add the cream of mushroom soup recommended by so many.  But I liked the lightness as is...  A GREAT recipe.  That I had for 12 years and just found today.

I had such high hopes for this dish, but, didn't like it (although my husband did).  After the 10 minute simmer the chicken was not cooked all the way through.  The flavor of the wine was too overpowering, and I thought the chicken was bland.  Will try another Chicken Marsala recipe but not this one.

Per another review, I increased the wine to 1 cup, added one can of heart healthy cream of mushroom soup, mixed together and poured over the chicken and cooked till no longer pink. 

I also sautéed two gloves of garlic along with the chicken breasts. Delicious!

Quite a special recipe! Instead of Marsala wine I used liasto (sweet traditional Greek wine) but it ended up too sweet so I balanced it with some dry whine(white). I also added coriander seeds and white pepper, they go perfectly with chicken. The only problem is that the sauce was too thick, apart from that it was a succes! I'm tottaly recommending it to friends!

Hubby loves this one. Don't overcook!
Edited to add: I've made this recipe a dozen times now, and it's my go-to quick dinner. Throw rice in the cooker (or pasta in a pot), start the chicken, and both are done by the time I make the salad and heat the other sides. I typically don't change anything, but if I want extra sauce I increase the wine, with or without some chicken broth. Reliable and quick - what's not to love? Thanks!!

Yum - this was so much easier than some of the Marsala recipes I tried..I doubled the wine and mushrooms (we like a lot of sauce to put over pasta)..I then reduced slightly and added a touch of cream to finish it off!...Will definitely use again!!

This was okay... I did make some additions including garlic and onions. I didn't like the texture of the flour dredged chicken, and I think the mushrooms would be better if I'd taken the chicken out of the pan and sauteed them separately. As they were, they just got soggy.

I had ALOT of fresh mushrooms that I wanted to use and was looking for a good recipe to do this. I made this for supper last night and it was SO delicious! My husband and son loved it! We agreed that it really did taste like something you'd eat in a restaurant, for a fraction of the cost. 
I doubled the recipe for leftovers, I pounded the chicken breasts thin, added minced garlic instead of garlic salt, doubled the mushrooms and tripled the marsala wine with a cup of chicken broth to have enough gravy for the noodles. I was afraid that it wouldn't thicken so I did add some corn starch. Also added dried parsley. I sauteed the mushrooms separately with minced garlic and olive oil and simmered it all together with the broth/wine liquid for about 30-40 minutes. We LOVED it!

Good and easy to follow. I listened to previous reviews and doubled the marsala as well as substituted freshly minched garlic for garlic salt. I would add cream as well as salt! Delicious.

Delicious!  Easy!  Fast!   Only change I made was that rather than adding the salt, pepper, and oregano to the flour, I sprinkled them over the chicken after dredged in the flour and putting in the skillet.  Can't wait to make this again for my family!

This was a great recipe and really easy to make.  I took some liberties with the recipe by sauteeing the chicken with diced onion and minced garlic, adding more mushrooms, doubling the amount of marsala, adding a few splashes of chicken broth, and using cornstarch at the end to thicken up the sauce.  I will definitely be making this again!

Took others' advice; added 1 1/4 c marsala, some turkey broth (out of chicken broth!) and let it simmer covered for 20 min, uncovered for 10.  Will add even more marsala and broth next time-we like a LOT of gravy! Tastes AWESOME, will be making again and again!!

I tried this dish, it was "clean" tasting but i didn't like it. I was surprised bcuz i like almost anything and this dish had great reviews. I followed recipe exactly as it was. i wont cook this again. I didn't like the flavor the marsala gave i guess. if anyone has a tip- maybe a certain kind of marsala works better.

Made this for two, using two breast halves flattened. Didn't reduce the other ingredients. Per other reviews I used Italian seasoning instead of oregano, browned the mushrooms after removing the chicken from the pan, I also added two crushed garlic cloves and browned those with the mushrooms, then added the chicken back to the pan and added the wine. I didn't have Marsala wine, so I used a nice Pinot Noir I had on hand. Turned out great. Served it with thin spaghetti tossed with 1 tbsp.butter and  a small amount of Parmesan cheese.Can't wait to make it with the Marsala wine.

Loved it!  I did make several changes.  While the chicken was cooking I added some chopped turkey bacon and garlic.  To increase the sauce, I added a can of cream of mushroom soup, used 3/4 cup of marsala wine, and probably about 1/2 a cup of chicken broth.  I served it over pasta with broccoli on the side and it was extremely tasty!

This is yummy and fast but if you are cooking it for someone who loves chicken marsala, they may be disappointed as it doesn't taste like the "real thing."  If you have time, DO pound the chicken.  Makes a world of difference.

I also added minced fresh garlic and I took the other reviewers' advice and made additional sauce.  I did this by adding 1/2 cup chicken broth and 1/4 cup cream.  This was delicious served over rice.

Very good recipe.  It did need some extra sauce as others have said.  I added some chicken broth (1 cup or so)  and then thickened the sauce with some cornstarch.  It was a hit with my toddlers as well.

Quick and easy recipe. I added minced garlic to oil before frying chicken. Also doubled the amount of marsala wine. Wonderful flavor!

Very good, though I did make a couple changes. I threw in a minced garlic clove to sautee with the mushrooms and at the very end, I added about 1/2 TBS soy sauce and some dried parsely to the sauce just to simmer with the chicken and add a bit more flavor. I served the chicken with fresh green beans - a very healthy meal and very good!! PS: You can make these with pork chops/loins also!! Cooking time is about the same and just as good (if you're tired of chicken!)

I seasoned the chicken instead of the flour and added a can of chicken broth. Turned out great but will also try thickening it up with cornstarch next time.

Easy and fast.  My kids loved it and I was impressed with the ease and quality of the recipe.  The sauce did not thicken very much but it tasted great over angel hair pasta.  Will definitely make this again.

This was pretty good, but the additions of salt, chopped garlic and more wine made it even better.  Pounded chicken thin and simmered low and slow to reduce the 'bite' of the wine, then finished the sauce with a cornstarch/chicken stock slurry.  Served over angel hair pasta with freshly grated Parmesan.  Easy AND delicious.  Thanks!

This is a great recipe that is easy to make.  Although, due to the ruralness of the town that I live in, I could not get Marsala wine.  I used White Port and it worked great.  Of course it gave it a different flavor and its no longer Marala Chicken, but its a great substitute for those who can't get Marsala Wine.

This was so good. Served it over rice, and didn't even have marsala wine. Used cooking sherry and aded a little red wine. It was so delicious.

Good marsala recipe! I dipped my chicken in beaten egg and then the flour. I also used chicken broth in with the wine and I baked it in the oven as I was cooking for a crowd. Crowd loved it!

Pretty darn good!  I have tried other Marsala recipes and was disappointed; not with this one.  Per suggestions, I added more garlic, mushrooms and wine.  I wish I could find a way to make the sauce a bit thicker - I added some cream which was good, but I'd still like it a bit thicker.

I made this for the first time at a dinner party with friends - it got rave reviews about the flavour and tenderness.  I served it with angel hair pasta.  I did add more Marsala for additional sauce, and two gloves of garlic for the browning phase - I also pounded the chicken before cooking. It was fantastic and will be made for my family regularly!

This was definately a hit. I added fresh 2 cloves of garlic to the olive oil and butter and let it saute a little before adding the chicken, and I also added capers to the recipe to add some "zip".  Next time I am going to try adding some proscuitto.  Loved it-thank you!

Great recipe and so easy. Not too heavy but definitely full of flavor. 1 cup of mushrooms isn't enough for our taste, so I cooked the remainder of the 8 oz. container up separately (in wine, butter and garlic salt) and added it to the chicken at the end. Yum!

This was really delicious, but I'm betting it's because of all of that butter!  I also added some chopped onions with the mushrooms, and was a little skimpy on the sherry.  Very good!

Very good. The chicken was full of flavor and sooo tender. Delicious. Sauce was thinner then I had expected, so I will try adding some cornstrach to the sauce next time to bulk it up a little more. My whole family said it was excellent, we will denfinatly use again!!

I am amazed at how easy this recipe is! I had this meal whipped up in no time and it tasted great, too! I'm not a mushroom fan, so I left them out. I also added a little cornstarch to thicken the sauce a bit. My husband and I were fighting for the last of the leftovers just this morning - I won! This is my favorite meal in restaurants, but I think from now on I'll be making it home...once a week!

This recipe is absolutely delicious. I added a 1/4 cup of sherry cooking wine for more sauce and added flavor. The ammount of oil and butter is just right and lowers the fat content !!!!

I used this recipe as a springboard to fit my needs (a/k/a what I  had available, lol).  I made this with very thin center cut pork chops.  The outcome was excellent!  I modified a few of the other ingredients to follow suggestions of other review(ers).  I added a cup of sweet Marsala wine and used a pound of fresh sliced mushrooms.  I also simmered covered for 20 minutes and uncovered for an additional 10-15.  The last 5 minutes, I added about 1/4 cup heavy cream and about a tbsp of corn starch slurrie to thicken.  It turned out so good!!  My husband hates pork and ate in total amazement.  I served this with Wild Rice.  Thanks for a great recipe!!

Yummmmmy!  This was a great recipe!  I took some advice from the other cooks, and doubled the wine and the mushrooms.  I also let the chicken simmer for about 25 minutes.  This was fantastic--and soooo easy!  I will definitely be cooking this again.  Thanks for the recipe!

Very good but simmered the chicken about 25 minutes.. Also, next time would turn up the heat for a few minutes to fully dissipate the alcohol. I got a buz as I don't drink alcohol so would be concerned about children...  Also, next time would add more seasoning and possibly fresh garlic...

Quick, easy, and very tasty! I used 3/4 cup of Marsala wine, 2 cups of sliced mushrooms, and right before covering to simmer, I sprinkled a bit more pepper, garlic salt, and oregano for more flavor. Next time I'll probably add even more spices to give it extra kick, maybe use fresh garlic. TIP: Using more mushrooms helped add more liquid to the sauce. Delicious, FAST recipe to make an ordinary week night more special! We had it with a bottle of reisling wine. Yum!

This is my very first review. I substituted the chicken breasts with boneless, skinless chicken thighs because they are much more moist. Also I make it with mushroom soup rather than Marsala wine. One time I used chicken stock but I love the soup. It's killer and I've made it about 3 times and we just love it!

We loved it!  I used chicken tenders instead of the whole breasts which made it easy to take a smaller portion and I had fresh herbs instead of dried.   I used one package of fresh mushrooms and I followed a previous suggestion of sautéing the mushrooms and 3 cloves of garlic after removing the chicken from the pan.  I also increased the amount of Marsala to 1 cup and let it simmer for about 15 minutes covered and 20 minutes un covered.  It was awesome!

I cooked the chicken cutlets first and then set them aside. Then, I stir-fried the mushrooms in the same pan, and stirred in a cup of Marsala wine and 1/3 cup of chicken broth for the sauce. I thickened it with corn starch and then added sour cream for a slightly creamy sauce, which was delicious. Next time, I would add fresh herbs  to give the sauce slightly more flavor. Overall, it was a good starter recipe!

This was a tasty recipe!  I made some changes because  it was necessary to hold the recipe in the oven.  I removed  the chicken from the skillet after browning  and placed it in a casserole. I added canned mushrooms to the skillet, with some chicken broth and butter.  I then added this thickened sauce to top the chicken and put the casserole in the oven at until  done.

I made this dish tonight for my family. It was very tasty, but the chicken was overcooked and dry, even though I followed the cooking time precisely. Not sure what went wrong. I expected the chicken to be very tender. It definitely needs more gravy. I'll try it again but add more wine and chicken broth.

I thought this was a yummy quick recipe! I also however didn't have time to defrost chicken breasts but i had leftover chicken from a whole roasted chicken. So I sliced the cooked chicken into strips, still coating them with the flour/spice mixture, sautéed them for 4 minutes on medium heat and removed from the pan, then I sautéed the mushrooms & removed them from the pan as well. I made a sauce by using 1 cup of marsala wine vs 1/4 cup (portion size dinner for 2) burned off the alcohol and the drippings from the pan then added a dash of thyme/ crushed rosemary and 3 tablespoons of heavy cream. Simmered for 5 minutes  Added the chicken & mushrooms back into the sauce and it came out really delicious. it cut down the prep time to 5 minutes and cook time to about 12 minutes. Served it over a bed of risotto and stea med veggies. Definitely will make again. Belissimo!

This was outstanding! I used thin chicken breast fillets so that cooking time was minimal. I looked over the reviews and decided on taking chicken out to saute mushrooms and onions with garlic, then added the chicken back with twice the amount of Marsala wine. after simmering for 15 minutes I took out the chicken and the mushrooms and onions then added a little bit of cream to the juices leftover to use as a gravy. 

I paired this with the allrecipes "Garlicky Potatoes" and "Green Bean and Mushroom Medley"

I thickly sliced my chicken breast before I dredged them in the flour mix and added some sea salt .Also I thickened the sauce with cornstarch at the end. Very yummy with vermouth too . I ran out of marsala so vermouth was used with great success. Served with steamed broccoli and whole wheat couscous.

This was really easy to make. I fried the chicken 1st removed it and put it aside in a foil pan. Added the wine and mushrooms to the pan and cooked. I used an exotic mushroom mix of crimini, shitake and oyster mushrooms.

I made the changes suggested by reviewer #150.  Doubled everything but not the chicken, used fresh minced garlic (3 cloves) rather than garlic powder, and added a splash of cream just before serving it along with noodles and a side of fresh broccoli. Oh, I did add 1 t cornstarch to thicken.  Hubby agreed that it was a sophisticated and delicious Italian meal.  Minimal effort for maximum "wow".

Many of the recipe changes I have read,  really up the calorie or fat content of this dish.  I liked it just the way it was.  We added some more mushrooms, simply because we like mushrooms.

Nice and easy but needed salt. Served with rice and frozen vegetables and the whole thing probably took less than 30 minutes.

This recipe will be part of my heavy rotation.  So easy and SO tasty.  Even my husband (who claims to not like mushrooms) loved it.  I was surprised by how tender and juicy the chicken was.  I stuck pretty close to the recipe - just increased the amount of mushrooms and Marsala a little bit. Can't wait to make it again.

My family loved it.  I will make it again. Next time I will make it with real marsala wine instead of cooking wine. It was a little vinegary for me.

Wanted to try this recipe, since I seem to order it out so much.  After reading the reviews, I decided to take their advice.  I doubled the mushrooms and wine.  I dropped the sherry, wanted the sweeter taste to come through.  My fault, but should have pounded the chicken down thinner.  Still a great flavor, will try again.

I followed some others' advise and added 1 can cream of mushroom soup and 1 cup marsala wine. It made ample sauce and required no thickening. My husband rarely comments about food (unless he dislikes it!) but did 3 times and even said the sauce was incredible! That's a first. The kids gobbled it up, too. I thought it was good but not the best I have ever had. Easy and yummy.

What a great dinner!! First time making it tonight and it was a big hit. I used some suggestions from previous reviews. I used garlic pepper for flour mix. After browning chicken put aside and sauté onion and fresh garlic used  a can of cream of mushroom soup a full cup of Marsala wine returned chicken to pan and covered to simmer. We used fettuccine noodles and garlic Alfredo sauce (adding just a touch of Marsala wine,garlic pepper, and mozzarella cheese to Alfredo sauce). And a side of fresh broccoli. I really can't wait to make this again.

This was just okay for me.  It lacked something, and I found the flavor somewhat bland.  The sauce is very thin, so if you like a thicker sauce, add some cornstarch to thicken.  Overall the recipe was fairly simple, but I wouldn't make it again.

Used chicken tenders and stir fried the mushrooms with garlic.  I did not cover the chicken but just let it cook longer on med low for extra 5 minutes.  The sauce reduced perfectly and the chicken was so tender!  Thank you for the recipe!

The first time I made this my family gave this 3.5 stars.  The second time I made it, the rating increased to 4.  but the funny thing is, I was half way through the recipe and realized I didn't have any marsala wine - I know, duh!!!  Anyway just used white wine and chicken broth!  I also increased my mushrooms to 2 cups, I also added 3 garlic cloves slivered.  And I cooked it much longer; 20 minutes covered and 15 minutes uncovered.  I will def make this again.  Thanks D. Alexander

This recipe worked out great. It was my first time ever making Chicken Marsala. I didn't change a thing, but next time I might add more mushrooms. So easy and inexpensive to make. I served it with organic wild rice and sauteed asparagus.

Very easy recipe!  I tripled the oil, butter and wine to make more sauce and added some minced garlic with the chicken and a dash on heavy cream at the end.  I served it with Parmesan risotto for a very tasty meal.  Even my picky kids loved it!  Thanks for sharing!

Great easy meal!  I had all of the ingredients in my pantry/fridge.  I did make a few changes.  I had frozen chix instead of fresh.  I cooked it in about 3/4 cup of chix stock and generously seasoned the chix with garlic powder, italian seasoning and pepper.  After I removed chix and reserved the chix stock.  In the same dish I added about 1 1/2 tablespoons of unsalted butter and 2 large tblspoons of minced garlic.  I added a full container of mushrooms and a small onion.  Then I added in the reserved chix stock with about a cup of the marsala.  I added the chix back in and let it simmer on med low heat for about 20 min then added some corn starch and a small pat of butter to thicken and served with some pasta!  Awesome dish!

I did not care for this at all.....  But to be fair, was I supposed to use dry or sweet marsala?  I used dry one and got the bottle from Trader Joe's.  I am not sure if it was the wine.....  but I also used TJ's $3 white wine for other cooking and any dish I make it with comes out great so I am really not sure if it was eintirely the wine.  Also, I did not like flouring the chicken.....
Since there are many great reviews maybe I should blame on the wine.

Very good!  Needed a chicken recipe that was fast and "not the same 'ol chicken flavor" and this was perfect.  Simple, tasty, and delish.  A couple changes, though- nixed the mushrooms, but added a hair of Sherry Cooking Wine to total the 1/2 cup cooking wine and added some leftover flour mixture to the pan before simmering to thicken the sauce.

If you're not in to rich recipes, you will enjoy this light version of a Marsala dish.  Don't add soup or cream.  If you agree that Marsala dishes served at Carrabas and Macaroni Grill are too heavy then you will enjoy this recipe.

Very tasty and easy!  I did tweak it somewhat, though: added basil and parsley; used fresh garlic instead of garlic salt; took another reviewer's advice and used a can of cream of mushroom soup (low salt/low fat) plus 1/2 c water; and put the chicken in a casserole dish, then poured the sauce over the chicken and baked it in the oven uncovered at 350 for 35 mins.  It came out great.

This was excellent.  I followed other reviews and doubled the wine, added 1 c. broth, and fresh garlic to the sauce.  I simmered the sauce for 30 min. to thicken.  I also put Italian seasoning in the flour which added some extra flavor.  Delicious.  I will be making this again and again.

I read several very helpful reviews before starting this recipe. My concerns were too much salt, and not enough sauce. I doubled the garlic with garlic powder instead of increasing the garlic salt. I also added a little grated Romano to coating(no benefit) Dble the Marsala but, kept losing volume cooking out the alcohol so I blended 1/4 to 1/2 cup water with powdered (plain) creamer, & added that to the sauce to increase volume and some creaminess. Double onions and mushrooms and removed the sauce from the pan. Cooked the breasts in the deglaze from the sauce. Still a little alcohol taste but, I liked it.

This is a great recipe.  I did what others said and doubled the wine, and added some chicken broth. I added thickener to start, and I think I should have added that after instead.  The flavor did not soak into the chicken as much as I would have liked, so I think i will marinate it next time.  I also like this dish on the sweet side, so I added some brown sugar at the end of simmering.  I had to simmer for 10 minutes longer.  I think the chicken was just really thick.  The chicken turned out juicy and tender.  I also ended up adding a little more wine to the final sauce after it was thickened.  After it sat for about 15 minutes the sauce was even better than before.   Thanks for this recipe!

Excellent!  I added 2 cloves of garlic and doubled the Marsala wine and the mushrooms.  Had to use cornstarch to thicken up the sauce.

I really enjoyed this recipe. Did as another user reviewed and added a can of cream of mushroom soup and 1 cup of marsala. It came out creamy and wonderful. I would recommend purchasing quality marsala wine, do not use the "cooking wine" cheap bottled things. Using a quality wine from the actual wine section makes all the difference in the taste. Made buttered noodles with this and served it with a salad, it made a beautiful meal.

I love Marsala, and was craving this dish, but had no Marsala wine in the house and was very unmotivated to go get some. So I used a bottle of sweet white wine someone had given us as a housewarming gift (we don't drink sweet wine, so it sat in the fridge for 2 months.) It turned out great! I also only used baby portobello mushrooms. They have a great texture, like really tender steak. Also added garlic, and like many others said, sauteed them with the mushrooms before adding everything else. I added about 2 TBS of Greek yogurt at the end to make it a but creamier, which worked wonderfully.  Delicious over whole wheat pasta with a spinach salad! Felt like I was dining out!

This recipe is AWESOME.  I only made a few modifications.  I seasoned the chicken breasts with garlic powder, and seasoning salt prior to putting them in the flour.  I added minced garlic to the mushrooms.  I used 1 and 1/4 cup liquid for the sauce. 2/3 cup marsala the rest water and then I added one crushed chicken bullion cube and some corn starch.  I then dumped the liquid and simmered for 15 minutes covered and ten uncovered. Delicous and so easy.

this was a very simple and tasty dish.  I doubled the mushrooms and added a handful of fresh spinach.  Served over egg noodles. I like it because it dosent have as much fat as normal marsala recipes.  Thank you so much for this !!

I've made this twice now & loved it both times!!  Very simple & fast to prepare.  Reasonably nutricious & now is a fave of the kids.  I double the amount of mushrooms & use Italian Seasoning instead of Oregano.  As some others, I cook the chicken then pull it out of the pan & cook the mushrooms with marsala.  After a few minutes I add the chicken back in.  I'm sure this will be a favorite for years to come.

So quick and easy!  We added fresh garlic, onions (about 1 medium onion, chopped) and extra mushrooms to the mix while cooking.  The onions carmelized nicely and the whole thing served over angel hair pasta was delicious!

This is a great recipe.  I only used two chicken breasts (pounded) and doubled the mushrooms and wine. Removed the breasts while mushrooms cooked and then added them back in. I suggest seasoning the pounded chicken breasts first and then dredge in flour.  When I put it in the plastic bag, my seasonings weren't evenly distributed. Oregano and marsala are great together.

This recipe was great!  I followed it almost exactly, except that I took the advice from other reviews and added 1/4 cup chicken broth and 1/4 cup cream.  Then I let it cook down a bit and it thickened right up and had such a full, rich, and creamy flavor! This is a fantastic recipe.  I will definitely make over and over again because of how easy, quick and flavorful it is!

Made this for Velentines dinner and everyone really loved this. I made a few minor adjustments due to what I had on hand. I used thin cut turkey scaloppine instead of the chicken and used a red wine and dry sherry because I didnt have any marsala left. Served with broccoli and pierogies. Yumm!

I made this recipe as is, with the only possible exception that I didn't measure anything, just eyeballed everything, and probably doubled the wine. It was delicious and I served it with French bread which we dipped in the extra sauce. This is an easy, company-worthy meal, and rather inexpensive. I will make this often! All the other reviewers' suggestions sound yummy too. I think if you simmer chicken and mushrooms in some wine, you can't go wrong.

I loved this recipe. I have made Marsalla many times but not like this. I followed another reader's advice and browned the chicken, removed it while I sauteed fresh garlic and double the mushrooms. Adding the cream of mushroom soup took this recipe to *****. Then followed step 3 of the original recipe. I will make this again and again.

I love this recipe! The only change I made was I used an entire bottle of Marsala Wine (about 2 1/2 cups)becuase my family loves the extra sauce served over wild rice. Also, I used whole white mushrooms, quartered. SO GOOD!

I didn't care for this one. I prefer the Easy Chicken Marsala recipe on this website. The sauce is richer, creamier, and has more flavor.

Excellent and very easy.  Use 1 cup of Marsala wine though as 1/2 is not enought.  I also added a little miced garlic for flavor.  I'll definitely make this for company.

Very easy to prepare.  I doubled the amount of butter and oil and increased the marsala wine to 2/3 cup for a bit more juice.  A keeper in my favorites.

I thought this was great!! I used Wondra instead of the flour and also added minced onion with the mushrooms (x-tra mushrooms) I used 1 cup marsala and only 2 breast of chicken.  Served with crusty S.D. Bread and roasted potatoes.  Husband loved it! THanks! I will make again!

This was great!  Increased the Marsala to 3/4 cup as others suggested and used 12 oz. of chicken tenders instead of the breasts so it cooked up very quickly.  Served over whole wheat angel hair pasta.  The only complaint that I would have, would be that it would have been nice to have had more "sauce" to put on the pasta.  Will definitely make again.

The chicken was moist & full of flavor!! I used chicken tenders instead & seasoned the chicken with the garlic salt,pepper & oregano before adding to the seasoned flour.  The only reason why I didn't give it a 5 was because I didn't have any sauce left after simmering.  I'll definitely try this again with more wine, chicken broth & cornstarch for more sauce. This one's a keeper!!

This recipe is awesome in flavor.  I needed to scale the recipe to serve 12, so I prepared 12 chicken cutlets according to the recipe and placed them in a  baking pan.  I then prepared the balance of the recipe, thickened the sauce slightly with flour, poured it over the prepared chicken and baked for 1/2 hour @ 350 degrees just to get it hot.  Awesome!!  Thank you Caroline!!

Very good! I used 3 large chicken breasts, and made sauce for 8 servings (I wanted to make sure there was plenty). I simmered it all for about 20 minutes so that the marsala flavor had mellowed sufficiently. I also added a splash of half-and-half that needed using up. We had it with parmesan-tossed linguine. Delicious. Thanks!

WONDERFULLY YUMMY!!!!
Very easy is the key word.I did take some other reviewers suggestions and added basil and 1/2 cup more wine. Beacause my family loves mushrooms I used Baby portabella. I loved it and am glad I got a big bottle of Marsala to make it again . Thanks

This recipe is tasty and very easy to make!  The only thing wrong is that the sauce is on the skimpy side, so I do recommend doubling up.  My family really enjoyed this one and I know I'll be making it time and time again! Thanks for sharing!

Excellent! I added 1/2 cup more marsala wine, I would suggest cutting the butter and oil down by 1/2 also.  I added chopped fresh basil the last few minutes of cooking.  My DH LOVED it, he said better then any restaurant he has ever had. :)

This was very easy but not enough flavor so I had to salt it at the dinner table for myself.  Husband liked it bland.  I will try this again since it's so easy but will add more spices.

I wish I knew Marsala could be this easy years ago.  One of my husbands favorite resturant treats is now a regular dinner at home.  I chose this recipe over the others because it called for less fats.  Turns out great every time and we've used a variety of different meats.

Great dinner dish. I love making this for my husband and it is one of his very favorite meals. I do let it cook slightly longer and do add more marsala to make more sauce to pour over pasta. When cooked long enough the strong smell is gone... it's all about letting it cook low and SIMMER....makes for a wonderful meal. Thank you from a new Bride just starting out!

Very easy and very good.   I actually brought the marsalla to boil at the VERY END and splashed a dash of heavy whipping cream to it.  Mmmmmmm.......  Husband and I enjoyed!

Everything was great until I added the Marsala. I did exactly as instructed but there was too much alcohol flavor. I don't think I'll be making this again.

I absolutely LOVE this recipe.  Double the Marsala and mushrooms (if u are a mushroom lover).  Make sure to brown enough!! :)  It's just the greatest dish ever.  I've made it 8 times so far and I still don't get enough of it

This dish was so easy to make a had such great flavor! I think it's important to use a good Marsala wine, not the Marsala wine labeled as a "cooking" wine. The only change I made was to add a bit of onion powder and parmesan cheeze to the chicken coating. Turned out wonderfully! I served this with mashed potatoes and steamed broccolli and carrots. I will be making this again for sure!

Amazing!  Used 2+ cups baby bella mushrooms, 1 cup marsala wine, added a little cornstarch at the end, as well as a little heavy cream. Instead of 4 chicken breast halves or used 7? 8? thin slice cutlets.  Sooo good.  Everyone loved it.  Served it with mashed sweet potatoes/red skin potato mix (with butter, lil cream, salt, pepper, oregano) and some steamed brocolli that i breaded and fried in a little olive oil.  The best meal!  Thanks!

Great recipe. Followed recipe first time I made it. I prefer a thicker sauce so I added a 1/2 cup of chicken broth and made a slurry of cornstach and water to thicken. I also pound out the chicken breast and have also used pork cutlets. This is much lower in fat than the recipe I was using for chicken marsala. Thanks for great recipe!

Truly delicious!  I followed the advice of another user and added low fat, low sodium cream of mushroom soup since my husband has a new cholesterol problem.  This was so rich and creamy and even better knowing it wasn't that bad for you.  The chicken was very tender, I used two breasts, thinly sliced.  I served it over rice and with french bread.  My husband loved it and he's a REAL chicken/veal marsala lover from way back.

Oh my goodness, this was absolutely delicious!  I have never prepared chicken marsala before, and I swear it tasted better than the one Im served at my favorite italian restaurant.  I served at a small get together for my husbands birthday, and it went over so well!  Thank you so much!!!

This was an excellent recipe.  I too thought it needed more mushrooms but I thought the flavor of the chicken (and the mushrooms!) was excellent.  My roommate was not quite as impressed, he gave it a four, as did my fiance who doesn't like mushrooms or care much for wine.

Delicious!  The chicken turns out tender - I pounded the chicken.  I followed the recipe, except for adding a little more mushrooms and used about 3/4 c. Marsala and 1/4 c. sherry (since I didn't have any more Marsala) and it was great.  My family really liked this one.

I tried this last night after reading all the wonderful reviews. I doubled the Marsala (which I didn't need to) and because of that the chicken was kind of soggy. My kids didn't appreciate the taste and wouldn't eat it. But my husband and I liked it okay. I don't think I will make it again though. Maybe it was the wine? I used Sweet Marsala instead of Dry because the recipe didn't specify but I think I should've used the dry.

One of my favorites!  I use portabella mushrooms and fresh garlic.  I also skip the flour step, but I do tenderize the chicken first.  It helps to cook more evenly.

This recipe is so simple and delicious!  I bought a marsalla cooking wine and was not sure it would taste that good.  I was pleasantly surprised!  The chicken turned out so tender.  I did add some orzo pasta and spinach to make it a one pot meal.  Next time I will make a larger batch because it was that good!

So easy!  My husband, 5 year old and 1 year old all love this meal. I’ve served it with noodles or rice and they love it every time. It’s a one pan dinner packed with flavor and no fuss. Seriously live this recipe because it tastes like I slaved all day but I really whipped it up in 20 minutes - queue rockstar music!!

My family & I enjoyed it. I did make some changes because not everyone in the family likes the flavor of Marsala wine. I cut the wine down to 1/2 cup, added 1 cup of chicken broth, 1/2 tablespoon flour whisking until blended & thickened.

I used boneless skinless thighs instead of breast. Increased Marsala wine to 1 cup, added minced garlic, a little chicken stock cause we like lots of sauce. Thickened it just a tad with a little arrowroot slurry and served with green salad and risotto...Delicious!

Made this for hubby the other night and he raved about it. (He has in the past refused to eat chicken because  I made it often for health reasons). He said he loved it this way and even ate the leftovers for lunch the next day. Easy and tasty!

This is amazing! The only thing I did differently was to add about 2 tablespoons of the leftover flour mixture I had from the chicken to the 1/2 cup of broth that is mixed in at the end, which made the sauce thicker, and after all it is already added into the calorie content so not a bad idea and gives the sauce a richer texture. Served it with mashed potatoes (made with bone broth instead of butter/cream) and fresh steamed green beans. Kids and husband loved it too! I felt like I was doing something bad by eating it,  that’s when you know you found a keeper recipe!

I added broccoli, bringing to a boil, draining and adding to dish after everything else is done, last 5 minutes, to capture flavor,  (adding a dash more of wine over top). I used pinot grigio wine, I did not use butter; (forgot), used a 12 oz can of mushrooms, taking chicken out after sauteeing mushrooms and then adding 1 Tbs crushed garlic, then adding chicken back to pan when garlic started turning brown, adding little more wine. *I do not use garlic salt, I use *garlic powder so food is not too salty and so I can add more of the garlic powder, (as well as garlic and crushed garlic),  to taste.  I serve over a bed of fettuccini pasta. 
Used all due to what I had on hand. Very tender & moist and flavorful!  Saved this recipe for the future!

I took the advice of a previous reviewer with some modifications. I used bone in but skinless chicken thighs and did not bread them. I browned one side of them and then took them out. Sautéed mushrooms with garlic powder for 3-4 minutes. While they cooked I combined one cup marsala wine and a can of cream of mushroom soup along with the seasonings that would have gone in breading. I combined well and then poured mushrooms into that combination and stirred well. I put the chicken back in the pan and poured this combo over it. Brought to boil and then simmered for about 20-25 minutes until chicken temp was done. After, I took out chicken. Combined 2 tblspoon corn starch with same amount of water and then put into mixture to thicken. Let simmer four minutes after stirring well. It came out great!

This will now be my new go to Chicken recipe. Excellent outcome! Followed the advice of another cook by adding cream of mushroom soup. Did not use garlic this time but will try that next time. Thank you for the advice DABOOGS!  I did not have chicken breast on hand so I used chicken tenders instead which worked great. Made mashed potatoes on the side. Might try pasta on side as well next time. Also I like how you can print the recipe on one page. Ink cartridges are expensive. Thank you Allrecipes!!

Did as one other reviewer suggested and after cooking the chicken I plated it and cooked the mushrooms in butter. When done I combined 1 cup marsala and a can of cream of chicken soup with the mushrooms. I brought this to a boil then reduced the heat and simmered while stirring. The chicken can be added back at that point and heated. Because I wanted to serve it later, I placed mine in a baking dish, poured the mushroom sauce over it, and heated at 350 for 40 minutes. It was perfect!

This was excellent and easy. The longest time is browning the chicken. I added Trader Joe's everyday seasoning to the flour. I cooked the chicken and then removed it and cooked the mushrooms and onions in the wine. We like it a bit saucier so I used more wine and butter than the recipe called for. I used some of the seasoned flour to thicken it and then added the chicken back in and let it cook in the sauce on low for about 15 minutes. Will definitely make this again.

Delicious. made with chicken breast tenders that i pounded. It was very moist, tender and I thickened the sauce slightly with  cold water and cornstarch which I added some broth to before slowly drizzling the mixture into pan so as to not have any lumps in gravy. served with spaghetti, roasted asparagus and sauteed spinach and texas toast.  A Hit with my guests.
I had doubled the recipe so used 1/2 bottle of marsala wine not only a half cup.

Made the following changes after reading other reviewer’s input: 4 Garlic cloves in sliver format. Double mushroom. Double the flour. Change butter to 1 teaspoon. When it is time to add the wine, 1) double the wine and 2) mix the leftover flour/garlic/seasoning mixture from the initial step with the wine by whisk it rapidly and then add the whole mixture immediately over the chicken that’s being cooked in the skillet. Cook covered 35min. Then cook open 15min. Add kale in the last 5 min or longer by stirring it in around the sauce area in the skillet. Came out fantastic!

It was EXCELLENT! I made a few changes as suggested by another poster though. I sauteed the mushrooms with garlic and butter and then added the chicken back in.  Also upped the marsala wine to a full cup and added in cream of mushroom soup. Also the final 10 mins I shaved some truffles on top.  Made this with some pasta and it came out just perfect.

I used chicken thighs because my husband likes dark meat.  It didn’t  flatten them, but they were boneless.  They turned out really good.  Nice to have a choice if you don’t have chicken breast.

After browning the chicken I removed it from the pan and added a little more olive oil and butter and cooked the mushrooms until tender.  Then I added the remaining flour mixture and simmer at low for 2 minutes.  Next I whisked in the marsala wine until the liquid thickened.  Added the chicken and let it simmer for 10 minutes as indicated.  Yes I will make it again.

The in-laws who eat nothing loved it!  Not too heavy.  We had it with garlic mashed potatoes to sop up the sauce.  I also used garlic powder instead of garlic salt in the Marsala.

I only used 2 chicken breasts and cut them in half.   I followed the recipe as written.  It could have had a cup of Marsala, as the half cup was not enough, even with only two chicken breasts.  It could have had more  mushrooms as well, perhaps another half cup.   I made it with brown rice and would have liked more sauce to pour over the rice and chicken.  It was easy to make and if I make it again I will make those changes.

I made it as written and I thought the chicken was overcooked by the time the mushrooms were cooked.  My family also likes more sauce than this makes for over the chicken and some noodles.  So this is how I made a 3 star recipe into a 5 star meal.  Pound the chicken to almost 1/4" thick, cut into smaller pieces for ease cooking and serving, Dregde in the seasoned flour and cook the chicken in usually 2 separate batches.  I remove the chicken while slightly under-cooked  in the center to a glass baking dish in the oven on the lowest temp just to keep warm (the chicken will continue to cook slightly).  I add more butter, add a little marsala to deglaze the pan quickly, add then the mushrooms and cook them fully (that's how my kids like mushrooms).  I place the mushrooms on top of the cooked chicken in the oven, then add chicken broth and more marsala to the skillet, bring to a boil, take some of the leftover seasoned flour from dredging, put it in a small Tupperware container with some water or broth and shake until dissolved.  Add to boiling broth slowly and stir until it's the right consistency for you.  Pour over chicken and mushrooms and serve  with egg noodles.

Incredibly easy and delicious. I browned the mushrooms on the side and added a bit of minced garlic at the end of browning. Then I added the mushrooms to the sautéed chicken before adding the Marsala and covering. Will make again and again for sure!

I think I would not  as much pepper and use real wine instead of cooking wine. It was good and quick but not as great as I thought.

I love how easy this is to make and that it can be used for company dinner or a quick weeknight meal. I have made it twice, and as I am trying to watch my cholesterol, I like the fact this uses much less butter than other recipes I have found.  I served it with whole wheat pasta and steamed broccoli.

Nice, easy and healthy recipe. I'm surprised so many people add canned cream of mushroom soup, loaded with sodium and preservatives.  Too many recipes on this site rely on artificial ingredients in my opinion.

I made this as specified, except for the addition of a little chicken broth to make more sauce. I was looking for lower calorie dinners, and this recipe came up. However, I decided I liked it as well as any other Marsella recipe I've made. This is my new go to. Delicious!

I made this dish for my 9 year old daughter and myself and she LOVES it.  I took the advice of the other reviewers and doubled the mushrooms and doubled the wine.  I think this time I may triple the amount of wine called for though because I do like a little extra sauce.

Added equal amount of chicken broth as marsala wine, added about half a can of fat free cream of chicken soup, added tons of fresh sliced mushrooms. Browned chicken, took out of pan and made everything else, put the chicken back in at the end and simmered about 15 min. Ate over linguine.

My entire family loved this!  Only changes I made was to serve it over angel hair pasta with a little butter and parmesan, add a few black olives, sliced and extra marsala with a splash of sherry. Even my 3 year old grandson wolfed it down. I love this website.

After reading other reviews, I tripled the mushrooms and doubled the marsala wine.  I also added a sauteed onion, because I was concerned that it needed more flavor.  I whisked the marsala wine with the leftover flour and added half of a cup of heavy whipping cream.  The result was bland, so I zipped it up with some spices.  It turned out wonderful, very tender.  Thank you for posting this recipe.

We discovered two things with this recipe: 1) it can be made gluten-free (substitute gluten-safe flour for wheat flour at a 1:1 ratio); and 2) it can be made vegetarian by using thick parboiled potato slices before breading and frying per recipe instructions. I included both chicken and the potato slices in this evening's Marsala to feed all appetites. Every plate left the table clean and conversations were limited to 'mmmm's' and nods of approval from adults and children, alike.

The recipe was easy and the meal a success!  The chicken was tender and moist and the sauce had just the right amount of seasoning. The only thing I changed was to add some corn starch to thicken the sauce.  It was very watery.  Overall a huge hit with my guests.

The only thing I changed is the flour. I used pan searing flour instead of all purpose. Everyone in my family liked it, which almost never happens!

Perfect for a FAST, easy weeknight dinner!! Delicious! I used 2 chicken breasts and they cooked in the same amount of time. I also used both Marsala and cooking Sherry in my dish. Next time I will try to double the sauce next time to go further and would also add more mushrooms and sautee these with a little salt separately from the chicken.

I added ground red pepper to the flour mix for an extra kick of flavor and I added capers and a bit of lemon juice with the marsala.  It was delicious!

Personally it could use a little extra salt. I did what others suggested -added a half a cup of extra mushrooms and I remove my chicken breasts and let the mushroom sauté for a while before I added them back into the pan - all in all it's very delicious

Absolutely excellent flavor! Could be served to company. Doubled the wine (and mushrooms) to make more sauce. Cooked 35 minutes covered....perfect consistency over noodles. It's meant to be lighter by design....so adding heavier ingredients (soup/cream) defeats that purpose. Believe me the flavor is there!

This was awesome with a couple of additions to the existing recipe.  I added a little more marsala, oh ok alot more, a few more mushrooms and mixed it up with the baby bellas and the regular mushrooms, and a chopped onion.  I then added some cream of mushroom soup until it looked nice and creamy.  It was delish.  Good luck making it and/or adding your own additions.  I may make it again and add sour cream next time.  Hmmm the possibilities to change this up is exciting.

Great recipe.  Alcohol from wine cooks off. But we have made it with Chicken Broth,  for friends  with allergies. Do NOT crowd pan. One of the 1st recipes my teenage son made. It's now his signature dish.  We usually make 2 batches, with extra mushrooms , so we have leftovers.

No I made it exactly as called for, I think I would like a few changes like some garlic and maybe something to slightly thicken the marsala sauce.  But all in all, I liked it.

I won't make this again. The interior of the chicken was too soft. Not an appealing texture, in my opinion. The sauce lacked viscosity.

Super easy chicken with juicy, light flavor.  Double the mushrooms.  Could use a bit more seasoning.  Fry in a skillet to get chicken a bit more browned.

Really easy and tasty recipe, but definitely follow others' advice and supplement the liquid and mushrooms. I ended up using 3/4 c. chicken broth and 1 c. wine, My husband has to be gluten-free, so we substituted a GF flour and it still worked great. Sauce thickened on its own as it reduced.

This was a huge hit with my family! After reading some of the reviews we tweaked it just a little for our liking. We used 4 thin slices breasts. Removed chicken after browning and set as side, sautéed 2 CUPS mushroom and ADDED 1/2 tbsp minced garlic and 1 tsp olive oil, returned chicken, poured in 1 1/2 cups Holland House Marsala cooking wine, brought to a simmer and covered for 20 minutes, added about 1/2 cup chicken broth, simmered 10 min UNcovered, added a little cornstarch/water mix to thicken. DELICIOUS!!! We will definitely be making this again and again!

This was amazing! However, only because I followed a lot of other recommendations: I used more than double the mushrooms(they cook down so fill up that skillet)I added 2 big tbs. of minced garlic, 2 whole cups of Marsala, and instead of thickening with starch, cream, or Greece like some suggested, I added a can of fat free cream of mushroom soup! Still healthy but the sauce was AMAZING! There was enough sauce  to either have with pasta, rice, over your veggies or to do what I did and cook 4 more breast halves with it etc. The recipe is good and fine as is but I'd say not 5 stars. With these minor changes my husband and 5 kids didn't leave a bit of leftovers!

Holy freekin' delicious! I made with the following changes: 3x wine, extra cremini mushrooms,  fresh garlic and hit it with some heavy cream at the end. served over angel hair.  Absolutely stunning and so easy!  the sauce reduced quite a bit so next time I will simmer more gently and not let it reduce as much and serve over fettuccine.  so good!

Following some of the other suggestions on here, I tripled the marsala wine added extra mushrooms, and added a can of cream of mushroom soup.  Chicken was tender, there was PLENTY of sauce, and it was good.  But not great, in my opinion.   The alcohol taste was a bit strong to me, so next time I would probably double, not triple the marsala.  I also feel it needs a bit more flavor, so I may increase the garlic, oregano, salt, and pepper next time.  A recipe worth trying again and tweaking.  It was super easy!  I served over rice with green beans.

Absolutely love this recipe and have made it for company with great results.  The only change I make is doubling or tripling the sauce and letting the chicken simmer in the sauce for about an hour.  I also make a larger batch so take chicken out as it cooks, cook mushrooms, and then add the marsala and then put the chicken back in to simmer.

This is good - although I added a ton more mushrooms and marsala sauce like suggested. Second time I made it, I added some heavy whip cream which made it a little more creamy. My husband liked it better that way. I would make this again.

A great simple dish with lots of flavor! I did add a full sliced onion and double mushrooms. I used chicken tenders vs chicken breasts and cut them into chunks.  Over a bed of linguini sprinkled with a bit of fresh parsley this dinner was  perfect.

This recipe is awesome! I did exactly as directed, but I sauteed the mushrooms after I cooked the chicken in the olive oil, then added the chicken back in with the wine, and doubled the mushrooms. Just delicious!

I thought this was a good recipe, however I made a few changes. I pounded my chicken breast almost flat, I used 2 cups of wild mushrooms(Medley), and I added half cup heavy whipping cream after the Marsala wine. The minor changes that I made, created a very tasty dish.

I made it with the edited version of the recipe as other people said, to add a can of cream of mushroom. I don't really like it and so did my husband. I'll make it again with the original recipe sometimes soon. Hopefully it'd be better.

I loved this receipe, the only changes I made was to add 3 crushed garlic gloves to 8 oz. of fresh mushrooms sliced and added  heavy cream in the last ten minutes of  simmering.  It was so good you could eat cold.  Yummy

I was surprised by how easy this was! Like many others, I removed the chicken and sautéed the mushrooms before combining everything and adding the Marsala wine.  Goes well with wild rice.  Fantastic!

Really good!!  I added more mushrooms, wine, half and half cream and some chicken broth.  I served it over bowtie noodles.  Next time I will try substituting cream of chicken soup for the cream.  Yum!  My only mistake was that I waited too long to thicken it (used cornstarch and cold water), losing some of the marsala wine taste and the chicken to get a little tough.

This was great.  I followed others advice and added cream of mushroom soup after browning the chicken.  As a vegetarian, I used Morningstar Farm's "Naked Chicken" and it turned out great.  I will make this again!

This is a good recipe.  But I would use almost 4 cups of Marsala and let it cook down a bit to make the sauce.  I wouldn't use any broth as others have suggested unless you are low on Marsala and need to stretch the sauce to make more.

The only thing I did differently was add more wine.  The recipe was easy and very delicious--my in laws loved it and they are picky about Italian food.  I served it with stuffed shells and a nice salad for my husband's birthday dinner.

This is one of our favorites ever.  I really played with the recipe and have perfected it for our taste by using more marsala wine and more mushrooms.  I also like to thicken the sauce with flour.  The sauce is so yummy that you really need to increase the measurements.  Can never have too much of that sauce.  Served over rice is so nice!

Fantastico!!  If you are looking for that chicken Marsala at your favorite restaurant, this is it!  I prefer to quarter my mushrooms and the butter isn't necessary.  I serve this up with sauteed broccoli and some angel hair pasta with marinara sauce.  This is a family favorite!

Cooked very well.  I added chicken broth as some others suggested, but I think it took away from the Marsala flavor.  Will leave out next time.

This is delicious & easy,definitely  simmer for 30 min. first, though or it is too sweet from the wine.

Delicious! I took to heart the suggestion of adding Cream of Mushroom soup with a cup of Marsala wine and it was truly yummy! I like a lot of mushrooms with my chicken marsala so next time I'll add in three cups of fresh mushrooms - not one. Served with steamed broccoli and french bread and my boyfriend loved it. I have enough for leftovers so tomorrow we're having it again - over pasta, b/c there's enough leftover sauce!

Great flavor...the only thing I didn't like was there was not enough mushrooms and sauce. I think it needs some chicken stock or more wine to make more gravy. Most of mine evaporated. Maybe because I made it in an electric skillet, I don't know...but all the wine evaporated. The flavor was still there though!!! I was amazed since there are very few ingredients. Most of which you have on hand, other than the Marsala cooking wine.

The recipe stated to coat the chicken with the flour mix, but i noticed that the sauce wasn't thickening as it cooked. So, I dumped the rest of the flour mix into the skillet to make it thicker. It worked.

Used this recipe again tonight for dinner. I didn't have mushroom, so I used a can of cream of mushroom instead. I cooked the chicken the same step without the mushroom, then take the chicken out when they are cooked. There should be a bit of wine left on the pot. I poured the can of cream of mushroom to make a thick sauce. Put in penne pasta into the sauce and pour over chicken. Delious!

This was EXCELLENT!  for a quick and easy meal, no worries!  I did scale the recipe for two and used two chicken breasts.  I decided to dice them up and dredge them in the flour/herb mixture.  After browning them, I removed them from the pan and sauteed a tablespoon of garlic, dash of olive oil with 3 cloves of minced garlic, tossed in a cup of sliced fresh mushrooms, and added a can of cream of mushroom soup.  After mixing, I added a quarter cup of red wine and simmered.  After simmering, tossesd in the chicken, and let simmer for 15 mimutes.  This was easy, delicious, and sure to pleased when you have to cook a dinner with next to nothing in the fridge!

Excellent. My kids love it too. I saute some garlic along with the mushrooms after I take the chicken out, then add the wine and return the chicken to the pan. My husband likes chicken thighs and although they do take longer to cook, this is a great recipe for thigh lovers.

This recipe was excellent, with a little tweaking. I took the previous rater's advice and added a can of cream of mushroom soup to thicken the sauce...delicious! I made whole wheat pasta as a side a created a sauce from the chicken sauce. Flavorful and yummy!

WOW!! This was amazing and super easy to make.  I used canned mushrooms instead of fresh that's about the only change that I made.  My entire family loved it even little ones.

Fabulous. So quick and easy, even a little elegant :). All we changed was a sub of garlic powder for the garlic salt, and we used a 10 oz pack of mushrooms instead of measuring out a cup. Used kedem Marsala cooking wine, and a pareve margarine in lieu of the butter to keep it kosher. Just LOVE this, and it's pretty good for our hearts, too :). Thanks so much!

This was great, I didn't give it 5 stars because of the slight changes I made. I also took the chicken out of the pan to make the sauce. Made extra sauce to serve with mashed potatoes, and it was delicious.

Yummy . . . pound chicken breasts first for an even gold brown. I wrapped chicken in foil while cooking mushrooms with added garlic, mixed cream of chicken soup with 1 cup Marsala wine and then added chicken to simmer for 10 minutes or so. Good aroma; good flavor!

This was really good.  I added another cup of wine and thickened the sauce with cornstarch.  If you add just a little brown sugar to the sauce, it might be the taste you think is missing. Because I make alot of sauce I used 3T of brown sugar.  But you should add it according to your taste. One more thing - Use a good marsala wine it will make a difference.

This was pretty good and definitely easy. The chicken was very tender, not dry at all. I will probably make this recipe again. I did use more wine, and some of the leftover flour and seasoning mixture to thicken the wine sauce. Next time I may try some light cream to the mixture as some have suggested.

This was just ok for me.  Flavor was nice, but not great.  I followed the recipe exactlly, but it did not make enough sauce for 4 servings.  Also, the sauce was very thin, and I was expecting a slightly thicker sauce.  Doubt if I will be doing this one again.

So delicious and so much less fat than the other recipes for Chicken Marsala. I used light butter and a touch less than the recipe called for, but it was still incredibly flavorful and rich tasting.  Picky kids and adults loved it.

I love this recipe.  I tweaked it too.  I used a can of chicken broth and 1TB of corstarch.  I also used Tyson frozen breaded chicken breast for an even easier recipe!!!  I just microwaved the breasts for 2 minutes and then added it to the sauce.

YUMMY!!!

Not bad but felt like it was missing something- maybe not enough marsala sauce.  For a quick and satisfying dinner, it comes through.

Seems like fresh garlic would have been better than garlic salt. I can't figure out why the recipe didn't have instructions to reduce the wine at the end of the cooking. Could have been a more thoroughly tested recipe, in my opinion.

I followed the recipe exactly.  I didnt think it was out of this world but it was good.  Certainly made me realize how much cream and butter must go into the restaurant's version.

Very easy recipe.  I always thought chicken marsala had to be more complicated.  I did sautee the mushrooms separately and then added them to the chicken prior to adding the wine.  My family loved it!

My husband enjoyed this meal. I served it with mashed potatoes. Next time I will use other reviewers suggestions and add things to make more of the sauce. The recipe itself was pretty bland, but easy enough to where I will give it a second chance with a few changes. Thanks!

As some suggested I doubled the wine, added lots of garlic and did have to thicken the sauce with corn starch. I bet the wine used makes all the difference. I used a cooking marsala wine. This recipe was just ok and will not make a repeat performance in my house.

I made this and added 1 cup Marsala wine to have more sauce, as per some of the other reviewers suggestions, but it still could have used more sauce. My husband really liked this recipe. I enjoyed it, but it didn't have a nice brown color like what I think chicken marsala should have, and the flavor ust wasn't wuite what I'm looking for. Other recipes call for the addition of sherry - I will try a different marsala recipe next time.

This was easy and good! Didn't have marsala wine on hand, but everything else, so used apple juice that was recommended by another reviewer. Very tender chicken! I also doubled the sauce ingredients plus equal amount of chicken stock and sauce was very good. Had to thicken it with Wondra. Served w/fettucine, but would like to try with mashed potatoes sometime.

Very tasty!  I followed the recipe exactly.  Love the way the wine thickens with the marsala!  Just enough!  This took some time standing at the stove, to make sure chicken was browning just right, but worth the wait!  With a side of fettuccini and zucchini, it was a perfect Italian dinner!

OMG!  This was incredible.  I'm not a big chicken fan so I'm always trying to find a recipe that I like.  I couldn't get enough of this.  It was sooo tender and flavorful.  I doubled the Marsala and added a little flour at the end to thicken.   Had to leave out the mushrooms because kids don't like them.  Thank you so much!

Very Good and have made twice.  I changed the recipe by cutting up the chicken in bite sized pieces, added garlic to the butter and oil and doubled the sauce.  Also used canned mushrooms.  Quick, easy and yummy.

Very easy to make.  Although a bit bland for my taste.  In the end I added some salt, but It seemed like it needed something else.  I also added some conrstrarch diluted in water to thicken the sauce.  Next time I will add minced garlic, some more seasoning to the chicken and some cream.  Overall it was good.

This was good but I had to fatten mine up a bit.  I added some cream at the end.  Turned off the heat and for toppers cut in some butter.  It made for a wonderful rich sauce.  I will try it again but still add the fat!

It was very easy to make but I found it was a bit bland.  I added green onions with the mushrooms, which gave it a little more flavor.  I think the next time I will add some minced garlic to the sauce for some flavor.  My husband liked it better than I did so I'm sure I'll be making it again.

I loved this!  Even though, I doubled the Marsala wine, my husband thought it needed more juice.  I served it over thin spaghetti mixed with grated parmesan cheese as recommended by someone else.

This is an excellent dish!! Perfect for company or just family!! I added extra wine, I did not have any garlic salt, used garlic powder instead. Used more of the flour, garlic, pepper, oregano and wine, because I had a few more chicken breast than it called for.

Good but not fantastic.  The sauce was a bit runny and the flavor didn't have that much mushroom to it.

Not enough sauce or flavor. I was a little disappointed after reading the other reviews. It was OK, but not enough sauce and the flavor was weak. I will try one of the more complicated Marsala recipes next time and see if it is worth the effort.

I love chicken marsala and have been looking for a good recipe. I found it here. This tasted as good as the chicken marsala at my favorite local restaurant. I am currently on the weight watchers points program. With the nutritional values supplied this fit into my points program with 7 pts and the mushrooms count as one of my 5 servings of veggies. Thanks for a great recipe.

I have made this dish several times and it has become a favorite!!  I add about a half a cup of chicken broth and a little more marsala so there is more sauce because I serve it over pasta.  Delicious and comparable to what you would pay big $$ for in a restaurant.

I wasnt sure what type of wine to choose so I ended up with "Fine Sweet Marsala"  Very Strong tasting.  I would try it again with Dry Marsala and hope the flavor isnt as strong.  I had never tried this dish before just saw the pic and thought it looked really good..  We had a guest over that has ordered it and like it very well. My picky hubby & 12 year old even liked it alot however my 2 year old wouldnt touch after one bite.

This is a pretty good version of a marsala dish. I did pound the chicken to about a 1/2 inch thickness and added extra mushrooms and wine.

My husband, and 14 year old daughter and I really love this recipe.
I have made it several times.
It has great flavor.
I think I would add more of the cooking wine, for more liquid. I also did use 2 lg. pkgs. of slices mushrooms. We love mushrooms.
Served it with parsley and buttered fettuccini noodles.

The best chicken marsala ever, and it's not that bad for you.  You can substitute PAM Olive Oil spray to get rid of nearly all fat, but it tastes better with the real oil.  You need a big pan though, especially if you are going to get it all in there together.

This was very good and simple!  My husband loves to order chicken marsala at our favorite italian restaurant, and even he was impressed with my cooking!  My only suggestion is to use thin chicken breasts or tenderloins.  My chicken breasts were very thick and would have been even better if it were thinner.  Great flavor!!!

So easy and very tasty!  I know others have had trouble with the thickness of the sauce but mine came out perfect.  I would advise to simmer just a bit longer to thicken it up a bit.  I am a novice cook and this is definitely something I can handle.  I will be making this recipe again!

Almost perfect.  This recipe is missing something minor and the sauce needs to be thickened just a tad.  I plan on playing around with this to figure out just what it needs to make it worth 5 stars.

This was just ok.  Not enough sauce.  Would have probably been better adding some cream of mushroom soup as others had suggested.

I scaled this recipe down for 2 chicken breasts. I used the "Thin and Fancy" breasts from Tyson and this turned out wonderful.  I used a cup of portabello mushrooms and a little more Marsala (even the cheap Kroger kind).  The sauce was very good.  This went good with the recipe on this site for skin-on mashed potatoes.  Will definitely make again!!

Very easy to make.  I took other suggestions and added cream of mushroom soup, and sauted the fresh mushrooms with garlic.  But felt it was still a bit bland, had to add alot of salt and Pepper, once we were eating it.  Next time will do that while cooking, and add a little Italian spice.  Otherwise very good.

I highly suggest that you remove the cover the last 5 minutes or so of cooking in order to reduce the sauce more so there is less of an alcohol taste (esp if you're doubling the marsala)

Made this for a group of friends and they loved it.  As suggested by others, I doubled the wine and mushrooms and used sweet marsala wine.  This is definitely a keeper :)

This was a good recipe, but would have preferred a richer taste and thicker sauce. Will probably still make it again but try to vary the recipe.

This is the easiest Marsala I've made and it's fantastic!  My husband likes this better than the more complicated recipes.  It's simple and so flavorful!

This is totally easy and so good.  The sauce is very light and flavorful, not heavy at all.  The only change I made was to pound the chicken breast flat.  I always do that, even if the recipe doesn't call for it.  They cook much more evenly and they're so tender, not stringy.  We will be having this one again!

This dish was super easy & delicious!  The only change I made was to add more mushrooms.  I quartered whole mushrooms, so they would soak up the sauce b/c it was so good.  Thanks for sharing!

I'm not a big fan of chicken marsala, but my husband is (I don't really like the wine taste/smell).  I tried this and my family liked it.  The chicken is tender and it was pretty easy to make.  I didn't have marsala wine, so I substituted with Chinese rice wine which is like a dry sherry.  I also did as other reviewers suggested, doubled the wine, plus I added 3/4 cup of chicken broth.  I simmered longer as well.  To thicken the sauce, I added a cornstarch slurry.  Next time I think I'll use less wine and more broth (as a compromise between me & my husband ;-)).

This recipe was very good.  I tried it for the first time tonight, and my whole family loved it.  The next time that I make it, I think I will reduce the marsala wine just a little.  Thanks for the recipe.

As a student, I don't have as much time to cook as I would like.  But this recipe is easy and delicious, thus well worth the time to make it!  I first made it two weeks ago and I have made it three more times since!  I like to add extra mushrooms than the recipe calls for.

It was good, but just okay good.  I added the cream of mushroom soup as well. My husband absolutely loved this - but I've had really good chicken marsala at restaurants, and I can't say it was that good.  I'd make it again though.

I am a novice cooker, and I thought this recipe would be "easier." Unfortunately, it was a failure. The chicken was tough and a horrible color. I didn't rate this as one star because I must have done something wrong. My fiance and I ended up eating at Arby's.

A great recipe, quick & easy.  I added more wine to it.  Also used a jar of sliced mushrooms (it worked out fine).  Also added some onion after browning the chicken.  Next time will use fresh garlic while simmering. My husband loved it!

This recipe was awesome!  I have been looking for a chicken marsala recipe that tastes similar to the one my favorite restraunt has on the menu. I did double the marsala and added a little onion. My boyfriend who hates mushrooms loved it.  Thank you so much.

Very tasty.  I did 1 1/2 times on the sauce because we like our things a littlie saucier.  I highly recommend this one, especially because it is on the lighter side.

Very, very good.  However, take our advice and MAKE EXTRA SAUCE!  I doubled it and it still wasn't enough.  Next time I'll triple it and add extra mushrooms too.  Overall a delicious recipe and a keeper for us!

I love this recipe.  It's quick and easy to make.  the sauce doesn't come out very thick though, so I have  the pasta with red sauce on the side.

You don't have enough stars to tell how easy and delicious this is. I served it with rice and the sauce on it was so great, my wife actually asked for more.(after we both had seconds)

Delicious! I've made this several times, and haven't gotten tired of it.  The last time, I was out of Oregano, but substituted Thyme and it came out wonderful.  I usually serve it with roasted potatoes and creamed spinach.  Thanks!
