I do one like this with an exception - since my husband and I are on Weight Watchers, I substitute balsamic vinegar for the butter.  Makes a heavenly match with the onion and the bouillon!  I also usually use a teaspoon of granulated bouillon instead of the cube.  Husband LOVES this one!

Wow!! I didn't have a vidalia or even better a Texas 1015 onion on hand, so I just used a generic yellow onion. I followed the advice of another poster and used good balsamic vinegar instead of butter because we were going to have mushrooms sauted in butter w/ our grilled ribeyes. I also added minced garlic w/ the beef cube because nothing is done w/o garlic! Ha! Ha! I double foiled it so no juice would leak. It was heavenly!!! Thanks for the recipe.

Delightful. Baked in oven at 400° for 1 hr., and upped it to 450° for an extra 15 min. Did two Vidalia onions – 1 w/ butter per recipe and the other w/ balsamic vinegar substituted for the butter as suggested by at least two reviewers. Follow the recipe for a richer tasting dish, and it receives a 5* rating. The one w/ balsamic vinegar gets 4*. I experimented w/ Tiger Sauce on a portion, and next go round may add that in the cored out center w/ a pat of butter. If you like caramelized onions, give this a try!

This was very good.  I did add 2 whole cloves of garlic (that I crushed).  I liked the addition of the beef bullion.  I don't think it tasted like French Onion Soup (like others mentioned), but it was delicious.  Had a guest and they said it was good.  Thanks for the post.

I used only two onions, sprayed the bottom of the foil with Pam and added some minced garlic.  I poked some holes in the foil to allow steam to escape.  Delicious - tastes just like french onion soup.

I make these onions at almost every cookout.  I have modified the recipe to add a little brown sugar and to add different flavors such as garlic, chicken boullion, crushed red pepper,etc...  These are SO easy and if you have an onion lover in the house, they will do anything for you, if you would just make those grilled onions again. A smash hit at any dinner.

I make recipes all the time from this site but my husband said this one is by far his favorite, and, I do have to admit it might also be mine, or a close second to Southwestern Grilled chicken with Lime Butter. This is absolutley delicious, the only change I made was to use 1 tsp of granulated beef bouillion instead of the cube.  I had heard that sometimes the cube does not melt.  I did double foil them and cooked for 1 hr. and 15 minutes on the grill and cooked indirect but at a higher temp - 425 degrees.Make sure that each person has their own because you are not going to want to share. (don't buy the very large Vidalia onions)   Thanks so much Kate!

Deeee-lish!!!  Neat presentation for company when doing a barb-q with steaks or whatever you like.  It did taste like french onion soup with a little sweetness to it - but who doesnt enjoy french onion soup???  I added a teaspoon full of grated parmesian with the butter and bouillion cube.  You've got my vote!!!

this is just as delicious as everyone says ... my new low-cal sub for french onion soup! do yourself a huge favor and use a bouillon without MSG (it's the primary ingredient in most commercial brands and eeeeew, who needs a big chemical hit?). I used a wonderful natural beef soup base and savored every delicious bite. in the regular rotation!

Been making these for about 15 years now, since a friend's father introduced them to me.  My wife call's them Randall Onions, after me.  We use any type of onions we have on hand.  Keep them on the grill for around an hour and they are always a hit, whether we are grilling for just ourselves or for friends.  There is never anything left of these. Guess we are not making enough ;)

Made recipe exactly as stated except used beef base instead of beef bouillon. (some readers stated the bouillon was gritty) Note: 1 tsp of beef base equals one bouillon cube. Great recipe!!

Taste wise, DH rated this a 3 (onions aren't my thing unless they're an accent to a dish, rather than THE dish). He said that it was good but he could never eat more than two bites. I never really told him what it was, just plopped it down in front of him- the words "french onion soup" may have come up- and not from me. After reading the reviews (just before writing this) and knowing what I do about how it was cooked- I think it never caramelized, or at least it didn't fully. Our grill was on the fritz & wouldn't get nice and flamey. I may try again some time when I have high heat :) and a few more people to test it on.

Wild, this does taste just like French Onion Soup!  I made this in the oven, and I was kind of disappointed that it didn't caramelize.  However, I had a gigantic onion (bigger than a grapefruit).  I added 30 minutes to the baking time, but I guess that wasn't enough.  It was still yummy, though, and I'll try this again with smaller onions in the future.  Thanks for the recipe!

I was out of beef bouillon but had some sweet vidalias & was eager to try this recipe so I subbed chicken bouillon & topped them w/ parmesan cheese. Very good! I can't wait to try them w/ beef bouillon as I love french onion soup.

I was disappointed in these, as I couldn't wait to try them.  They didn't carmelize at all at the temperature suggested.  My husband said it tasted like onion soup!  I will try again at a higher temperature.

These were really quite good although I flubbed it a little (didnt have enough room in the hole for all the butter).  My step daughter who does not care for onion even ate some and said that it was good.  I will use this alot in the summer - Thanks

I followed the recipe to the letter and used the rack above the grill on the BBQ.  I started the onions well before the steaks as the grill was preheating.  although I was careful two onions sprang leaks and I re-wrapped them on the spot.  Taste was great, onion and butter, what's not to like, the bouillion was a nice touch, I bought the best I could find for the first attempt.  In the future I will add bouillion when I do stovetop onions.  This is a great recipe for camping.

Made per recipe with just a dash of brown sugar.
Wrapped in tinfoil and baked in oven @ 325 for 2 hours as I had another dish in the oven with above setting.
The onions turned out great.

I almost only made 1 onion, so glad I made 2, or I would have had to fight my husband for it. They were so good! My husband put some provolone cheese on his when it was done, delicious!!

My hubby and I have used this recipe every time we have grilled out for years, and we're not exactly huge fans of onions. The only thing I do differently is to use bouillion granules instead of cubes. Works well with all kinds of onions. *Be sure to double-wrap these so all that yummy butter doesn't drip out*

We thoroughly enjoyed this. Definitely add a little chopped garlic. You can leave this on the grill for at least 60 minutes. The longer, the better because it to carmelize more. A winner!!

This was pretty good...though even after an hour in the oven it didn't really carmelize. Was hoping it would be a little sweeter. Will make again sometimes but not one of my favorites. Some of the boillion didn't dissolve.

Love these, like the other recipe on here better that calls for salt, pepper and paprika. I like to cook these longer than called for. Thanks!

WOW! So simple yet so delicious. This was a staple for us this summer and now that the weather is colder I have also baked this in the oven and it is just as good.
