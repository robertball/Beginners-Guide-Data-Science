This is excellent Snow Ice Cream! I used my mixer and add the snow into the bowl at the end. I used raspberry preserves, since I did not have frozen berries. This turned out fancy enough to serve at a party or a nice restaurant!

This was very good.  I rated it a four because I had to add more strawberry to give it a better flavor.  FYI, the regular milk is definitely needed; it gives it a better flavor than just the condensed milk.  Overall, it really is a nice recipe.

I made this during a huge blizzard, when the store couldn't get and strawberries, but I liked how it mixed the stuff slowly, and used condensed milk, so I tried it without the strawberries. I mixed the extract and condensed milk together, then added 2-3 tablespoons of the mixture, 2 teaspoons of milk, and 2-3 cups of snow at a time, mixing well as I went. It had a good consistency, but it wasn't sweet enough, according to my 8 and 5 year old and my husband. So I added 5 tablespoons sugar and 3 tablespoons powdered sugar. It was really good then. I agree with them, it had a good vanilla taste, but it just wasn't sweet enough. The next time I make this, I'm going to use more condensed milk. My husband just said he'd give it 4 stars too.
