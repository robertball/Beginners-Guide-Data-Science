This makes great toast, or grilled sandwiches.  I tried it once with an extra egg and an extra 1/4 cup flour, and it came out a lovely golden color with the taste of an egg bagel.

Lovely and easy, though it wasn't like any bagel I'd ever had. It is a lovely light white loaf and popular with the kids.

I add cheese after the rising stage and they come out wonderful every time even though I do have a hard time shaping them.

This bread has become a family favorite!  One thing I have changed though...I substitute half/half for the milk and it comes out even MORE delicious!

Yummy bread.  I mixed in the bread machine and baked in the oven.  I baked at 375*F for about 35 minutes using a 8"x4" loaf pan.  The taste was not exactly like a bagel, but close enough.

It was so easy to put in my machine! I came out with a crispy crust that was golden brown and a tender inside that rates making more.  K.

This bread smelled wonderful when it was baking, actually much better than most of the breads I bake. However, I was upset by its taste and by the fact it was too airy to me; THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH A BAGEL. I won't bake it again, but if you're looking for a light and airy bread with some kind of a "plain" flavor, this one will do the trick.

I just made this bread without a bread machine.  Here is how I did it.  1/3 warm water (around 100 F) add sugar and yeast.  Stir and let it sit for a few minutes until it starts to foam.  Add the milk and an egg, whisk together.  In a large bowl mix the salt and 1 cup of the flour. Mix in the liquid to the flour.  Slowly add the rest of the flour until you can work with the dough with your hands.  Kneed the bread with your hands for 8-10 minutes adding flour as needed.  The dough should be smooth.  Place the dough back in the bowl and cover it with a towel so the dough can rest.  Many times my kitchen is cool so I run the microwave for 15 sec (with nothing in it) and then I put the bowl in there so the dough can rise in a warm place.  Let the dough rise until it has doubled in size which is about 2 hours.  Spray a bread pan with cooking spray.  Form the dough into a smooth log and place in the pan.  Cover again with a towel so it will rise a second time, about 45-60 minutes.  Bake in a 350 degree oven for 30-35 minutes.  A good way to tell if bread is ready to come out is to knock on the bread and if it sounds hollow it is ready!  I was looking for a nice chewy bread and this is great.  I was getting tired of crumbly bread that would get everywhere when I sliced it.  I plan on serving this to my husband for breakfast.  I canâ€™t wait! So much so that there is already a piece missing, well I had to tell you all how it turned out, duh!

This bread is awesome. It turns out nice and crusty, enough to use it as a bread bowl for dips. I do add 1/3 cup sugar however to the recipe, makes it a tad bit sweeter. Try it like that, you're sure to have a winner in your home.

I don't know about the "bagel" part, but this bread was surprisingly good. Will stop looking for other bread machine recipes . . . at least for now!

This is a delicious, easy bread.  Makes 1 *big* loaf!  I made it my bread machine w/bread machine yeast but made a round loaf and baked it on a cookie sheet.  (The photo of a big round loaf on cooling racks is mine.)  Brought it to a pot luck and my foodie friends enjoyed it.  A gluten intolerant friend said it was worth taking a gluten enzyme tablet just to taste it.  I'll make it again, exactly as written.

Nothing "bagel" about this bread, but it wasn't bad.  The crust was way too hard, but the inside was tender.  Taste was fine.

Exactly what the other reviewers have said this is- a wonderful bread with a crispy, chewy crust.  Wonderful with soup!  I added 1 Tbsp dried, minced onion and 1 tsp garlic powder and it turned out very well!

I made this a couple of times, and it naever came out right.  Because the dough is truly watery, I decided to do what one of the other reviewers did and I added another egg and 1/4 c. flour.  I won't be making this again.

This bread had a great texture and baked wonderfully, but it was a bit bland, I think it could use a bit more sugar or something. Over all, it was a good basic bread though, nice golden crust with a light center.

I really wanted to like this recipe and use it as a good ol' stand by in my kitchen but alas it was not meant to be. Sure it barely tastes like a bagel but it's really more of an eggy type of white bread. And even as a white bread it was average. The middle fell on my loaf that was made in my Zojirushi "Home Bakery" bread machine. You could try adding 2 eggs & maybe 1/4  to 1/3 more flour but in my book it wasn't worth experimenting with. As for my machine I increased the servings to 15 and it made a pretty normal size loaf. Anyway try some of the other reviewers tips and maybe you will have better luck, but as for me I'm moving on to new recipe adventures! (ps. if you post a review, tell us what bread machine you used, it would help others narrow down what works in which machine, thanks!)

Though I didn't think it tasted like a bagel, the bread had a nice texture and a chewy crust. It was a bit bland, but was very good with the Orange Honey Butter from this site. I generally only use my bread machine for making dough, but this was a nice alternative.

This makes a tall, beautiful, golden brown loaf in my old Webilt breadmaker.  It is a tasty sandwich bread with nice texture.  It has fast become one of my favorite bread machine recipes.  Thanks for sharing this one!

As many others have reviewed, this is a tasty white bread and lacks bagel quality.  The expectation of the bagel bread is the only reason why I gave this a 4 star rating, but for texture and flavor of a white bread it is 5 star, no contest.  I have a Cuisinart Bread machine put it on a 1.5 lb white bread setting with medium crust.  I added 2 tsp of yeast instead of 1.5, but followed the recipe as instructed.  It came out fabulously and will definately be remade.

Very light with a crispy crust, not sure why it is called Bagel Bread but I will likely make it again.

I added 1 tblsp. granulated Splenda to get the sweetness I wanted; used dough cycle with bread machine; shaped into loaf & placed in loaf pan sprayed with veg. oil; covered with towel and let rise till doubled; baked at 350 deg. for 30 min.   LEAVE THE BREAD IN PAN; cover with moist towel for 10 minutes; remove from pan and again leave covered with moist towel; cool completely before storing.

Hubby liked this, not too soft, not too crispy on the crust. When I made the bread I added shredded parmesan & 1/4 cup of flour I subbed milled flaxseed. I did the dough setting then turned the bread in to bread loaf pan. Cooked it 350 for 35 minutes. Yummmmm!

It IS good bread, however, it tastes nothing like a bagel.  I was very disapointed.
Had this just been a recipe for white bread, I would have rated higher.

Not too 'bagel-y' but it was good loaf of white bread. Actually, bagels aren't too hard to make. I like the 'Bread Machine Bagels' recipe from this site.

This was truely a disappointment.  It didnt taste at all like a bagel, it really didnt taste period.  The texture is way too light for a bagel too.  I made it three times to make sure I didnt mess up somewhere but it came out plain and fluffy every time. Not even a good plain white bread, sorry, I dont like to give bad reviews but this one was not good at all....will not make again.

Doesn't taste like bagels. BUT a nice tasty easy to bread recipe. I added lots of shredded Cheddar cheese and Asiago cheese. Small loaf that's perfect for two. Toasted brings out the cheese flavors.

I loved the taste of this bread! Toasting it with a little butter was perfect! It didnâ€™t rise as much as I was hoping, but the taste certainly made up for it. I will be asking this again.

This has become my "everyday" bread recipe.  It stands up to hot dogs, kielbasa and makes a great sandwich, is still soft, but not chewy like a bagel.  I can even cut it warm without it smashing down.  For a white bread recipe, this is the best I've ever had.

Hubs LOVES this bread.  I've made him 3 batches already since last weekend . . .he devoured the first loaf almost within a day, so I made another batch but doubled it this time, adding 1/2 c of flour because the first batch was pretty sticky.  He complained bitterly, however, that I had changed it and it wasn't as soft . . .blah, blah, blah.  It tasted the same to me, and with an extra 1/2 c flour of the doubled recipe, it was a perfect bread dough consistency!  At any rate, I was skeptical this bread would taste bagel-y without the boiling step you use for bagels, but it surprised me.  It is really chewy and while the crust isn't exactly bagel, it still does remind me of bagel-y goodness.  I usually bake in the oven--I baked at 375 for 45 minutes and it turned out well.  Clearly this is a recipe that is a keeper in our house.  Thanks for the recipe!

I was going to use the recipe as is, but had really wanted more of a whole wheat bread. I used 1 C white flour, 1 C whole wheat flour, and 1/4 C flaxseed meal having no idea how it would impact the results. Otherise I used the recipe as is, though I baked it in the oven as some others did. It came out with good taste and texture. I am excited to have a good whole wheat bread recipe I can use to make the dough in the bread machine.

Nice bread.  Not much in common with a bagel.
