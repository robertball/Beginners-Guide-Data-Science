This recipe has now come full circle, as I am an American teacher living in Russia and I made these blinis for breakfast here in Moscow this morning.  Yum--they're the real deal!  I did not have oil and substituted butter, which is never a bad thing!   Also I cut the recipe in half and will still be eating blinis all week!  I think this volume is for a Maslenitsa celebration!  The other recipes I saw looked too thick, and blinis should be thin and foldable!  This one was perfect.  Thanks for posting!
