This tea is good, but it is certainly not the same sweet tea you receive at your favorite Thai restaurant, and I pretty much knew that going in, but figured I should try it before I rate it. There is a specific Thai tea that is used in this; and it's not black tea. It's actually a red tea and can generally be purchased at any Asian market. That tea makes ALL the difference in the world in the taste.

The key to this is finding the right type of tea, not black tea.  You can find this at an Asian market or whole foods/bristol farms.  Thank you for posting this!  Perfect on a warm summer day while cooking other Thai recipes from AR!

I think "black tea" needs to be more specific.  Didn't taste like traditional thai tea.

If you use Star Anise, Clove, and Vanilla in addition to black tea it's pretty darn close.

Someone mentioned the type of tea used makes a difference.  I agree- using regular black tea will NOT give good results- you will not achieve the orange color or the same flavor. So What tea should you use?
*********
Check your nearest Asian market for  ChaTraMue  Thai Tea Mix- it is a product of Thailand the can is red with a white band at the top and bottom and has a hand with a Thumbs Up on the front, the lid at the top and even embossed onto the bottom.  ChaTraMue means Hand Brand Tea (Or literally Cha=Tea Tra=Brand Mue=Hand)
*********
There is another brand that I have seen used made by Pantai Norasingh Thai Tea Mix. 
*********
Method:.... 1- You steep the tea for 3-5 minutes then put it in the mixing glass(not the glass you will serve it in)......2-Add 2-3 teaspoons of sugar stir......3- Add 2 Tablespoons sweetened condensed milk and  a pinch of salt(optional) and stir.      Note: The tea will turn orange-nothing special, they add food coloring to the tea mix.   *If it is too sweet, don't worry- it will be fixed in the next step.*......4-Fill a glass to the top with ice then pour still warm tea over the ice. This will melt a good bit of the ice and dilute the tea......5-Just before you serve the tea top with evaporated milk or Half and Half.  You can use regular milk, but it won't give the beautiful marbled results the heavier evaporated milk will.  This is NOT a low calorie or a low fat drink. 
*********
You can find the ChaTraMue (bag type- red bag with white at top a

Not too bad, I went to a thai restaurant the other day and had thai tea and wanted to know the recipe so I asked the waiter and he said he uses Jasmine tea and coconut milk.  Well both tea and milk was pretty difficult for me to find in my town but I subbed the tea for spiced chai and I could not find any sweet coconut milk so I got unsweetened and used honey for the sweetener. Its not the same but it taste pretty good in my oopinion :)

Wasn't what we were expecting.  Did not have the traditional Thai Iced Tea flavor at all.

Made his because my boyfriend and I love Thai tea. Sadly, it merely tasted like regular iced tea that was a little sweet. Boo

Very tasty and refreshing even on a winter day (I like hot and iced tea any time of year).  The next time I go to the asian market I'll check out their tea selection, but today this was made with tea in my pantry.  The condensed sweet milk does tend to fall to the bottom, so I found myself stirring frequently.
