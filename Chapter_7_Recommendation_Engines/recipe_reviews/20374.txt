I reviewed this last summer but I have NO idea where my review went. I make this during the summer for both the boys and I. This is expecially great for me when I use SF Jello and artificial sweetener. I've even used cold SF soda in place of the cold water and a couple tablespoons of honey in place of the sweetener. Great for dieters who need something sweet without the calories and moms who want to keep the kids' sugar intake down. NOTE: You really do not need the extra sugar.

These sound great! If using little cups after pouring in the liquid, wrap the tops with foil and poke the sticks in. That way you don't have to wait until they partially freeze. Stick them in and forget about them and the sticks will already be in them.

These are awesome my mom used to make them for me when I was a kid. One thing I like to do is make several different flavors all at once, so I mix all the powders and sugars together then divide mixture between four ziplock bags.I do this with four different flavors then I keep it premixed in the cupboard ready to add boiling water. That way I can have four different flavors at the same time, and have more ready to go for later.

These are sooooo delicious! I made it with cherry and lemonade! MMMM!! I have one suggestion though, when putting them in the freezer it is easier to put them on a plate or pan that way the cups dont tip over and spill all over your freezer....lesson I learned the hard way! :)

I found this exact recipe on another web site.  I made these last night, but I used Watermelon
Cherry Kool-Aid along with a Watermelon JELL-O
gelatin.  With all the new varieties that Kool-Aid
and JELL-O gelatin has come out with lately, making home-made popsicles now-a-days is so much fun.  Can't wait to make them for my granddaughter.  She'll think her grandma makes the best popsicles in the whole world. Bea, I hope your recipe catches on. "Thank You"!!!

Great Pop - Unlimited flavor selections.  If using paper cups and not molds, put the cups in a muffin tin to freeze and you don't have to worry about them spilling.

We just decided that these are the best pops we have ever eaten. Raspberry jello with Cherry Kool Aid was pretty good. Time to hit the grocery store and stock up on all the other flavours. A great recipe for kids at heart.

AMAZING!  These are by far the best tasting ice pops we have ever tried! If  I could I would give the recipe 10 stars! I didn't have any flavored gelatin on hand, so I used one packet of knox unflavored gelatin and increased the sugar to 1 1/2 cups.  I can't wait to try it with lemon flavor gelatin and lemonade drink mix.  I think next time I will freeze them in small cups so we can eat them with a spoon like italian ice.  My only wish is that I had found this recipe at the beginning of summer!

very good ice pops, these have the actual softer texture like store bought pops (not rock hard and icy!).  But they were SO sweet they almost knocked my fillings out (of course, the kids loved them).  Next time I will cut the sugar back to 1/2 cup and go from there.  Very good recipe though, thanks!

My grandma used to make this same recipe for us when we were kids.  We absolutely loved them!  Now I make them for my own kids and they love them as well!  I make them in 3 0z dixie cups and put the sticks in after 2 hours.

These are great and my son loved them...but the recipe made FAR more than would fit in my 8 count mold.  I need to buy at least two more I think.  Makes quite a bit.  We used Berry Blue jello and Blue Moon berry Koolaid.

These were smashing!  I bought some ice pop molds from IKEA which are hard to remove the pop from.  I'll go back to my mom's dixie cup/stick method.

Awesome!!! SOOO much cheaper than store bought-we think they tase better too! I tried it with Splenda too- they were good but had a different texture to them, we like them with the real sugar the best, but will make them with splenda when watching our weight!

These were beyond my expectations.  I love that the gelatin keeps the pops from melting quickly and they give them a nice texture.  I had been making ice pops out of frozen kool aid and these are so much better and the flavor is intense.  I did add two packs of kool aid instead of just one and they were perfect.

Amazingly good!  Got 12 out of it as I have a popsicle freezer tray.  Kids already planning future flavor combinations!  I used sugar free jello.  Will try using Splenda next.

Growing up in the 50's-60's we just put kool-aid in a tall cup with a spoon and froze them.  These are much better using the jello - texture and taste. I'll be making them for my grandkids camp out this weekend - they'll be thrilled!

This is the best recipe I've found so far... Definitely need the jello with the kool-laid to get the texture right.  The flavor options are limitless!  I pre soak my wooden sticks an hour before inserting and let the pops freeze about 2 hrs. Before I  add sticks... Then freeze over nite on a cookie sheet.  Run a lil warm water over to unmold and put each one in a snack zip bag or cellophane treat bag for storage.   (And be QUICK about it as they melt fast!) ;)  then put all the small bags in a gallon slide zip storage bag....     Also I just use a total of 3 cups water.... Stronger flavor that way ;)

I remember making the same recipe for my kids back in the 70's-80's. My mom sold Tupperware and this recipe came with the Tupperware brand pop molds. So yummy! Now I wonder if they would taste as good with low calorie gelatin and splenda?

I made this a second time in the same cherry flavor. I am fairly sure I was a bit too impatient for the first Ice Pops. You see I am extremely sensitive to the taste of sugar substitutes so I guess I was checking my first batch far too often and they just weren't freezing to the handle enough to come out properly. Second Batch was untouched overnight. 8 servings of this recipe with 2/3rds less cold water makes for 16 Ice Pops with the molds I have. Next flavor I try will be Lime. It is so much cheaper and tastier than what the Ice Cream Man or the Grocery Stores offer in pre-made Ice Pops. I still have to figure out a way to get the Liquid into the Molds without dripping all over the place.

There are so many things I love about this recipe.  First of all, I used the small dixie cups.  The kind that you just get a small drink of water that sit by the sink.  The small ones really work well for me, since my kids are fairly small.  Secondly, I made 20 of that size for about $1!  Third, I live in a neighborhood with a lot of kids and we break out the frozen treats in the summer.  They all want RED!  So I made a big batch of cherry gelatin with cherry kool aid.  Perfect!  Everyone is happy!

I was surprised at how much of a real popsicle this tasted.  It was a bit on the sweet-side even after reducing the sugar to 3/4 C.  Next time I'll reduce further to 2/3 C.  I used the blue Koolaide and blue Jell-O.

Fabulous substitute for ice cream.  My pops had a creamy consistency.  I used black cherry KoolAid and cherry sugar free Jello.  Terrific for dieters.  =) Thanks for the recipe!

I used Lime Jello and Fruit Punch Mix. Odd thing is, I really don't like fruit punch, but it tasted REALLY good!

Yum!  Easy, quick, and perfect for summer.  I tried the recipe with cherry Jello and cherry watermelon Kool Aid.  Can't wait to try other flavor combinations.

After tasting how sweet the first batch was, I added about 1 cup of extra water to the recipe.  Doing so means this recipe makes about 20-24 standard size pops.  We have a set from Tovolo. Even after adding the extra water, the pops are similar in texture to the store bought variety--not hard like an ice cubes.  My 3-year-old and husband love them!

When growing up as a kid (in the 50's & 60's), mama made these in her metal ice cube trays.  If she was out of popsicle sticks, she would improvise & use toothpicks.

The best orange popsicles EVER!!!

I made this recipe using lemon-flavor Jello and Crystal Lite lemonade drink mix. They were still on the verge of being too sweet for my tastes, but this combo did have a really nice lemony zing. I can't wait to try different flavor combinations with the next batch.

Delicious!  Like many others, I used to make these as a kid with my mom.  However now that I'm a little older I like some other variatiosn - try making them using 2 cups of strong cold tea instead of the water and kool-aid mix (I also cut the sugar, as others have suggested here) - a perfect little afternoon pick-me-up :)

Fabulous!  I used a little less than 1 cup of sugar.  This batch made enough for 12 of the pops sized the same as in the picture.

I really enjoy making these. This year I tried berry blue Jell-O and blue raspberry Kool-Aid and it was a great combination. I followed the recipe as is.  Everyone in my family enjoys eating these.

These were great!  Gelatin makes all kinds of frozen treats softer.  I use pudding and gelatin in ice cream all the time.  Best to use the non-instant pudding.

These ice pops are really great; very flavorable and they don't freeze as hard as most ice pops.  I took them to a picnic yesterday and everyone (not just the kids) loved them.

This tasted like the traditional ice pops you get at the grocery store. I used 4 of those individual fruit punch KoolAid packets (the ones that you are supposed to throw in your water bottle) and omitted the sugar (they already have it). Also, used sugar-free strawberry Jello. Very good for cooling off on a hot day. Note: recipe made 12, not 6 popsicles.

Good.  Very sweet, though; I will cut back by 1/4-1/3 cup in the future.  Big hit w/ the kids and fun to experiment with different flavors.

This recipe was a godsend when my sick 2 year old and my sick husband were fighting over the last of the red popsicles.    I used cherry gelatin, and since I didn't want to make a special trip to the store for drink mix, I used one single serving sleeve of cranberry-pomegranate sugar-free mix (the kind that flavors a 16 oz. bottle of water).  Since that was sweetened with Splenda, I reduced the sugar to a scant 1/2 cup.  This does make more than 8 popsicles - made 8 popsicle sized pops, and many, many dixie cup sized ones!
