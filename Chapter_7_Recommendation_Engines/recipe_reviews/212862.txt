Ok.  Added the maraschino cherry another reviewer suggested.  The cookies were very sticky on the bottom even after cooling.  I found that a silicone mat worked better than parchment paper.

I had some coconut AND a partial box of frosted flakes I had to use up, so I decided these would be a great way to do so. Because of the "frosted" aspect of the cornflakes, I cut the sugar down to 2/3 of a cup, which helped with the overall sweetness. I threw in about 1/4 cup of cocoa powder (my family members are all chocolate addicts) and it turned out well! I wasn't overly fond of these (I couldn't wrap my taste buds around the corn taste), but they're a great treat for the kids! I made them with sliced almonds, too, which was a nice variation with the chocolate flavor.

I accidentally added red dye when adding vanilla and made RED cookies! OK ALL cooks make mistakes and I got through this one and these were very fragile with corn chip taste so I would add raisins or chocolate chips, or cinnamon or more vanilla next time .  . . and not color them up!

I made creme brule earlier in the week, so I had egg whites to use up.  This recipe caught my eye, because of the corn flakes and coconut addition to a standard meringue cookie...That said, by dropping by rounded tablespoons, I only ended up with 30/cookies versus the 60 the recipe suggests.  I cooked them for 2/hours at 212 degrees on non-stick foil.  They were crunchy and delicious!

These are light and easy to make.  Everyone enjoyed them.  i did cut the sugar down to 3/4 cup and they were still great.

These taste good but they go moist/soft/sticky really quickly. I was making them to store and use in my kids' lunch over the next few weeks and I don't think they'll hold up to storage at all. They wouldn't work well for a pot luck either because of the stickiness factor. It was fun trying out a new cookie recipe we'd never had before but I probably won't make these again.
