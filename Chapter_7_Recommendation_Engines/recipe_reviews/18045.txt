Hey yall, this southern girl added bacon sauteed with the onion prior to cooking.  I have found squash is always good with bacon, and my husband loves this.

I'd give this 10 stars if I could.  My boyfriend's aunt made something similar for us last year and I've been trying to find a recipe like it ever since.  This has to be as close as it gets!  I followed the recipe except I had to use 2 zucchini (I was out of yellow squash), but the green with the yellow actually looked nice - gave it some color.  I HIGHLY recommend this recipe to ANYONE! My mom always made the kind with sour cream and cream of mushroom/chicken soup - this is 10 times better!  Thanks!

The first time I made this recipe, I found it to be a little to bland for my taste. To compensate, the next time I made it, I sprinkled the squash liberally with dried oregano while it was steaming, and added a couple of pinches of nutmeg to the squash when adding the cheese and cracker mix.  A definite improvement.

This is a very good casserole.  I gave it 4 stars because after reading reviews I modified it a little.  I added 1/2 t. garlic powder, 1/2 t. garlic pepper, only 1 egg, and 2 additional T. butter.  If you buy the Ritz 4 pack, 35 crackers is one pack.  I think garlic is a must for this recipe unless there is someone out there that doesn't like garlic.  Over all a very good recipe. My son said it was not his favorite, hubby said, "I like it fine".  As for me, I really liked it.

Recipe is great. Cooking squash in advance will avoid having a mushy end product, as squash is up to 90% water. Most of the water will evaporate when cooked in the skillet. The small amount of water added in the skillet at the start of cooking it is to prevent scorching/sticking until the squash breaks down and releases its own water. Do not put a lid on the skillet to allow for evaporation. Do not omit the other ingredients unless you substitute. The egg, milk, and cracker crumbs act as binders and thickeners (the flour from the crackers). I do not add the extra salt. Dotting the top with butter is an error- the butter will not melt all over. Dotting of butter such as inside an apple pie will work fine as the top crust will seal the pie and allow the butter to spread but not in this case. The butter will only melt downward from where it is placed. Mix the melted butter with the cracker crumbs then spread on the top. This is a standard type recipe and any type of cooked vegetable or type of cracker can be used if you prefer. If you want it to be outstanding (and extra calories but delicious), use only real butter and heavy cream.

Really good!!! I love summer squash and this is a good way to use all the crooknecks from my garden. The texture beneath the crust was mushy (but still yummy) so I tried baking the casserole for 10-15 min and then putting the crust on to brown. It wasn't quite as mushy this way, and I also didnt simmer the veggies first- they still get plenty tender for my taste but you avoid a mushy product. Will try adding some meat next time for a main dish! Thanx for a good recipe!!

Brovo to the creator of this recipe. My husband couldn't get enough of it and was hinted he wanted it for breakfast.  My three and four year old like it too. This is truly one of my favorite kinds of recipes quick and easy.  I will be making this again soon and can't wait to share this recipe with my friends.
  
Changes made per suggested by other reviews: I added 10-15 extra crakers, added extra squash, added 1/2 small can of diced green chilies, cooked my squash until tender but not falling apart, omitted the butter on top.  Sound like a lot but it really isn't.

very tasty...I'm all about simplicity so I cut out a lot of steps.  Simply put uncooked squash,onions and cheese/cracker mixture in greased 9x13, poured egg/milk spices on top.  MIxed a bit.  Poured melted butter on top and added the leftover crumb cheese concoction.  Covered w/foil and placed in  325 oven for an hour while I cooked the rest of  my dinner.  Could've stayed longer or come out sooner! Delicious! and minimal fuss!

This is one of my favorites.  Instead of crackers I used corn flakes.  Also I found if you substitue squash for zucchini it tastes great as well.

This was absolutely great. I cut this in half for the three in our family. One small/med  squash is approx one cup sliced. This is a keeper!

LOVED THIS. I had to health-ify it a little bit though. First, I doubled the amount of yellow squash because I had two very large ones from my garden I needed to use up. No need to double the other ingredients. I used Reduced-Fat Ritz Crackers, Fat Free Cheddar Cheese, Skim Milk and 1/2 cup Egg Beaters instead of the eggs. I also reduced the melted butter to 3 Tablespoons (Don't get rid of it altogether, it is a key flavor). I didn't have light butter or I would have used that and saved even more calories! I also skipped the last 2 Tablespoons of butter on top & just misted the top with a couple sprays of 0 calorie spray-butter. You literally can cut the calories of this recipe in HALF with low-fat/ fat-free ingredients & it is still AMAZING!

Love this dish. As with most cooking, I always add more spices than the recipe calls for, and with some garlic and steak salt makes this wonderful!

Absolutely delicious!  The only thing I did different was cooked it in an oval casserole.  It would have been to thin in a 9x13.

This was absolutely delicious.  I used all the ingrediennts with no substitutions but I did use a different method.  I layered the raw sliced squash overlaping in the bottom of the baking dish.  Sprinkled with salt and pepper, carmelized onions, crushed crackers and cheese.  I did this twice and then I topped with a last layer of squash, S&P, egg and milk mixture, and finally the crackerrs and cheese.  Covered and baked at 350 for an hour.  (actually I cooked it for 40 minutes at 350 and then 20 minutes at 375 b/c it seemed like it wasn't cooking fast enough).  The squash was crisp tender and just fantastic!  My dh doesn't like squash so it's all for me YAY :)

i'm giving it 5 stars even though i didn't follow recipe exactly.  I used two bags of frozen sliced squash (10 oz. each) and cooked them as directed with the addition of the chopped onions.  I also used a boxed dried stuffing mix as the topping since I didn't have crackers, and drizzled it with butter before cooking.  This was absolutely delicious.  Next time I will try to use the ingredients in the recipe so I can get a true taste of what this dish is supposed to taste like, but done the way I did worked just fine!!!

Awesome dish! I just sauteed the squash and onions in little olive oil first with some minced garlic. For those reviews who thought the dish was bland...seasoning is key...as it is with all dishes. The whole family loved it...will definitely make it again.

This was absolutely the hit of my Easter dinner!  I added some cooked bacon but I won't do that next time.  I think it took away from the purity of the taste of the yellow squash.  I also used 2% cheese, skim milk, and light butter.  I used 1 sleeve of Ritz crackers and it was perfect. I'll make this again and again.  Thank you for this great recipe!!!

YUMMMYYY!!!
I have so much squash from my garden - I researched many casserole recipes and this one caught my attention the best. So glad I found it because this dish is DELICIOUS!! I did use extra squash like others and even threw in some green zucchini for color. I took others' advice - cut veges in chunks, instead of boiling I prefer saute in skillet w/ garlic + onions. Used the whole sleeve of crackers and gotta have meat (I used the canadian bacon but I bet it would be great w any other meat of preference). I could eat the whole casserole - dangerous! Thanks for a great recipe :)

I used 1/2 bag of Monterey Jack Cheese-Its in place of the ritz crackers and exchanged about 1 cup of the yellow squash for zucchini. Rather than cooking in water (which has a tendency to make squash mushy if not watched carefully), I sauteed the squash in a olive oil/butter combination with the onions and flat leaf parsley, seasoning the whole mixture during the saute process. It turned out great and was a great hit!

Every time I make this casserole it gets rave reviews.  Guests always ask for the recipe.  I made it more "South Beach" friendly by substituting whole wheat bread crumbs for the cracker crumbs.  I used the canned onion rings on top and in the middle.  My family is already asking me to include it in our Christmas buffet menu in a few weeks.  Happy Holidays!

This dish was delicious although I do agree with other users it was a bit bland the first time around.  Second time I used the new Kraft Philadelphia Cream Cheese Cooking Cremes in Roasted Garlic flavor, just two tablespoons, it also helped thicken the consistency.  Also try adding chopped up chicken breast for a heartier meal!!

I steamed the squash and let it air dry, and cool.Then removed it to a large mixing bowl. I also added bacon to this recipe, a good addition.  I sautéed the onion in the bacon drippings after removing the crisp bacon. I crumbled the bacon into the squash and added the onions to the bowl.  The only other change I made, was to eliminate the milk.  It was not needed and made the dish watery.  I experimented with freezing a portion, and I found it to work fairly well, if the milk was not used!  Good flavor and a good side dish or the main meal. (Needless to say I doubled the onions and cheese, to suit my taste buds!)

I have been looking for a good squash casserole and was very impressed with this one.  I completely omitted the step of steaming the veggies first as I really didn't think it was necessary and the veggies came out perfect - they were nice and tender without being mushy and still had great texture and flavor.  I also added garlic powder to mine as I am a garlic girl.  Since I was making this along side a roasted chicken and the chicken was set to 350 degrees, I baked this at the same temperature, but for about 15 to 30 minutes longer than the recipe called for and it came out just fine.  Some of the casserole had a stronger egg flavor to it than I would prefer and I'm not sure if that was because I didn't beat the egg mixture good enough or if that is how it is supposed to be, so next time I make it I'm going to be sure to beat the egg mixture more thoroughly or maybe even reduce it to just one egg. But I still plan on keeping this recipe and will be adding it to my Thanksgiving menu this year for something different than my usual squash dish.

I thin slice the squash and use yellow squash that are not overly mature (more mature - the larger the seeds will be).   I did make one tweak in this recipe and that is, I lightly grated nutmeg over the squash and onions and then topped with the buttery crackers and cheese.  The seasonings I use are salt, pepper and nutmeg - that's it! Everyone always cleans out the dish! Delicious!  Thanks for sharing!

The first time I made recipe it was a little water on the bottom and the top wasn't as butter as I thought it would be. The second time aroun it was beautiful, I melted the butter instead and poured it over the top it turned out gorgous and tasted great.

This tastes sooo good!  I made changes based on what I had in my kitchen and it still works.  I used 1/4c. mayo instead of eggs.  We do not eat those buttery crackers, so I made my own bread crumbs from day-old bread and mixed those in.  I sauteed the onions in an oven proof skillet, did all the mixing of ingredients in the skillet, and then just put the skillet in the oven instead of using a casserole dish.  This recipe lends itself to all sorts of varieties and still is terrific.

After reading other reviews stating this recipe was bland, I steamed my squash and zucchini with McCormick's Veggie Steamer using the Garlic and Basil flavoring for five minutes, then used one sleeve of Saltines and one cup of Sharp Cheddar cheese in vegetables and added 2 eggs, 1/2 cup of milk and 1/4 cup sour cream, covered and baked until almost set then added additional sharp cheese on top to cover (we like leftovers and did not want soggy top)It was abolutely wonderful!

I have made this for company twice and it was all gone in minutes both times and the recipe was requested both times.  This, to me, makes a sucess!
We all enjoyed it very much.  Could add more squash and perhaps make in smaller pan, it was a little thin in a 9x13 pan.

This recipe was ABSOLUTELY TERRIFIC!!!! We grow and can our own summer squash, and of course we have more than we know what to do with. My husband and sons loved this recipe so much they finished it in one sitting!!! I have to make two batches just so there will  be left overs. When I mix my squash and onions up, I also add a little minced garlic, and that gives it a little "zing!" This casserole has been taken to many get togethers, family holidays, and everyone asks me how to make this recipe. Down here in the deep south, squash casserole is SERIOUS BUSINESS, and this one passed with flying colors!!

Well folks I am back. Dinner is over and the yellow squash casserole was gobbled up by all. OMG it is soooo gooood!! The 8 full cups of squash was perfect. The only change I made was time and tempature because I was baking a meatloaf along side the casserole. I cooked it at 375 for 45 min. Perfect! The bottom was firm and nicely browned and there was nothing mushy or gooey about it. When cooled I cut and removed it from the dish with a spatula.

Very delicious! Yellow squash can be such a bland vegetable and this is such a great way to make it tasty. I made it as-is, however, I think next time I'm going to try it the way the reviewer Lynn suggested and skip the skillet step. I thought the squash was a little on the soggy side and I'm hoping by just cooking it in the oven (and skipping the skillet step) that it will help with that. I didn't think it tasted bland at all like some other reviewers suggested. I will definitely be making this again! Thanks for a great recipe!

Loved this recipe. My only change was I didn't cook the squash first. The baking time made the squash  tender crisp the way I like it. I think cooking first would tend to make it mushy.

I've never made a squash casserole before, so I
thought I'd give this one a try. I see now why it's so
highly rated. Followed the recipe to a tee and it was
good, but precooking the squash made it mushy, to
me. Made it again without precooking the squash,
added a tbs. of minced garlic and it was to die for.
Five stars and highly recommended!

I added one zucchini which was good, i also used corn flakes instead of crackers as i usually do when a recipe calls for crackers or bread crumbs; my husband can't have wheat.  I sprinkled a little garlic powder over this, we really enjoyed it.  Between me and my husband we almost ate the whole dish!

This is absolutely the BEST squash casserole our family has ever eaten!  We all love it.  Company always asks for the recipe.  I cut up the squash into bite-sized chunks instead of slices.

This recipe is exactly what I've been looking for! Like another reviewer did, I added bacon because I love bacon with squash. I sauteed the onion in the drippings, then lightly sauteed the squash before adding water. Instead of using more butter for the top, I sprayed it with butter-flavor Pam. My picky teenage daughter ate a huge serving. THAT is worth five stars in itself! I'd give it ten stars if I could. Great recipe!!

This recipe was so yummy, and a great way to use up the five squash from my produce box.  The only changes I made were frying up four strips of bacon, then adding the onion and squash to saute for about five minutes.  (I did not add water and cover as the recipe stated, and the squash were perfectly cooked out of the oven).  I seasoned with salt, pepper, Italian seasoning and garlic powder, then followed the rest of the recipe exactly (I reduced the melted butter to two tablespoons to account for the bacon fat).  I was a little nervous because the mixture seemed quite soupy after adding the milk/egg, but it baked up well after 30 minutes.  I wouldn't call this recipe healthy, but it is absolutely delicious!!!  PS: My squash-hating hubby had two helpings! :)

Delicious. I cooked the squash using a microwave steam bag and sauteed the onions in some olive oil. For the cheese, I used a mixture of grated cheddar and mozzarella. It was a hit with my husband.

I followed other reviewers and didn't pre-cook the veggies. There was no need. Also, I used a squash and zucchini mix...great idea! Used low fat butter (and a lot less of it) and 2% milk. Added whole wheat crackers because that's what I had on hand. Added fresh italian parsley, garlic powder and crazy jane's. Used a mixture of sharp cheddar and gruyere. This is delicious! A really easy (seriously, don't pre-cook the squash, onion and zucchinis) and basic recipe. Better than any other squash casserole I've had.

Excellent!!  I did add some extra squash (about 2 Cups more, and about an extra 1/4 of cheese, and I used a whole roll of crackers instead of just 32), but it was a BIG hit and this is a definite keeper!! Thanks for sharing!!

halved the recipe and cooked in a ceramic loaf pan. I steamed the large squash slices for 3 minutes with minced garlic and the onion.  I layered the steamed squash slices with the *uncooked* slices. Tossed on the topping, then the egg mixture and then drizzled the butter and baked for 20 minutes.  I was afraid the steamed slices would make the squash overcooked and mushy and it did.  Next time I make this I will not steam the slices first, but slice thinly before baking. VERY GOOD!

Fantastic!  I made this on a whim for my picky in-laws and they loved it (as did my 15 year old picky daughter)!  My neighbor gives me half of his "yellow squash crop" and this is the perfect way to use it up.  This would be awesome at a brunch!  Thanks Rosalie!

I think it would have been really good had there been a white sauce made with the cheese and milk, then add the squash. What I had was squash with mushy cheese cracker bits and scrambled egg bits. Did not care for this.

I made this for a "must impress" family get together, it was a hit!! Everyone raved on and on how this was their favorite dish and when they went back for more.... it was gone.I did change only one thing, instead of the buttery round crackers i used the vegetable flavored ritz,it added an suttle  extra kick of flavor. I will be making it again this weekend!

Very tasty!  I put the squash and onions into a casserole dish (did not sautee) and baked 15 minutes.  Then I added the bread crumbs/butter for another 15 min.  Turned out perfectly!  Very simple. Will try zuccini next time as the squash was out of season and expensive :)

Incredible! I did make a couple changes. I sauted the squash and onion in butter instead of steaming in water; I added 1/4 cup sour cream and 1/2 cup milk instead of just using the 3/4 cup milk; and I had to add some seasoned breadcrumbs since I didn't have as many crackers at home as I thought. DELICIOUS!!!

This is great! I add zucchini and saute red peppers and garlic to this also. I take it to work for lunch, heat it up and put in in a pocket bread! Ive also used many different kinds of crackers..anything works!

Wow! This was such a great recipe! My kids and husband loved it, and I can't get any of them to eat vegetables!  I used Toasted wheat crackers and extra cheese and it came out great.  I also added 2 cloves of garlic to the squash and onion mixture. Instead of 3/4 cup milk, I used 1/2 milk and 1/4 cup sour cream. 
Try this recipe, you won't be dissapointed!!

I made this recipe exactly as written with the only exception being that for the topping, I melted the butter and mixed it in with the crackers so it coated all the crackers instead of just dotting the butter over the top.  Got many compliments on it when I made it for our Christmas family dinner, and was asked to make it again for our Easter dinner this year.  Very good recipe, thanks for sharing.

I did not care for this recipe. There was way too much fat. There's no need for 2T of butter in a recipe that already has buttery Ritz crackers within it. The egg is an attempt at creating a binder to hold all of it together, but it didn't work.

Yummy goodness. The only thing I did different was to melt the 2 T butter and stir it into the topping, rather than dot it on the top. I must have put more than half of the topping in the mixture because there wasn't enough so cover the whole top of the casserole so I just added a little more crackers and cheese (and butter) for the top. This is better than my usual recipe, the one I got from my mother-in-law. Shhhh! Don't tell her I said that.

Doubled the recipe because the squash turned out to be 8 cups.  This was not too much for the 9x13 pan.  Sliced squash thinly (2mm blade) with Cuisinart.    Don't need to use the buttery crackers.  Can use wheat ones instead and it still tastes great.  Used only 2 pinches of salt which was plenty.

Good casserole.  I didn't have any butter round crackers so I used Club crackers.  I'm SURE it would be better with the Ritz (aka buttery round crackers), but we still enjoyed it.

When searching for some hearty casseroles to make with my garden veggies, I stumbled upon this one and I am so glad I did.  Its absolutely delicious!  My husband and I gobbled it up!  The only change I made the second time around was using less butter (hubby has high cholesterol!).

This recipe was VERY GOOD. I added a few things: Thyme and 2 diced jalepeno's which gave it a kick that was amazing!!  Will make this again but add a can of cream of mushroom soup to give it a creamier texture.  All in all, a great addition to any meal!!!

This was insanely good.  My hubby who hates yellow squash and zucchini loved this. Here are the modifications I made.  1. Took the skin off of the squash and zucchini 2. Used 12 oz of velveeta cut into cubes instead of cheddar 3. Added 1/4t of garlic powder 4. Added 8 slices of crispy bacon chopped  I followed another reviewed who did not saute the squash first but put it into the oven for 10-15 minutes and then added the cracker/cheese/butter and baked for 10 more minutes. The squash came out tender and not mushy  Wonderful dish, thanks for sharing!!!

I halved this recipe for us "empty nesters". I used one good size yellow neck squash and one medium zucchini, following directions and put it a glass dish about 6"x9" and baked it in the toaster oven. I added a couple spoonfuls of sour cream with the milk, added about 1/4 cup shredded Parmesan cheese to 1 cup of co-jack cheese. I seasoned the squash while it cooked in the skillet with pepper, Seasoned Salt and garlic powder & onion salts instead of plain salt (for added flavor). I did use more cheese than stated in recipe, but I feel that 1 cup of cheese for a 9x13" pan is too skimpy. My husband loved it. This recipe is a keeper, the topping is crunchy and the squash was tasty.

this was my 1st squash casserole to make and i will def be making again.  I only used a few T of onion, as i don't like a strong taste, and it was still very flavorful.  My husband has never eaten squash before this, and he finished his serving (he's picky picky).  I think i will undercook the squash just a lil less next time so it's a little more firm in the casserole, but that was my only suggestion!

Delicious!  I cut the recipe in half and used a square pyrex casserole dish.  I also used three yellow zucchini (since yellow squash is out of season) and it filled the dish perfectly.  I steamed the onions and squash for about 5 minutes and baked the casserole for about 15-20.  It turned out perfectly.  Great texture, great balance of cheese, crackers, squash and onions.  A classic recipe that I will be making again.

Don't cook the squash before hand! I cut the pieces into 1/2" chunks instead of slices, added more onion AND added a can of Rotel tomatoes (drained). Baked for 45 minutes so everything was cooked through. Mixed more of the cheese/cracker mixture into the squash mixture. leaving a thin coating on top which was perfect. We loved it!!

I had purchased some frozen squash and needed a good QUICK recipe to make with the time saving frozen squash.. AND that my SQUASH HATING sons would eat too ;)  They actually ate some of this... it was REALLY good.

I added 1 teaspoon of honey to the egg mixture so it would be a little sweet, like they make this casserole at "The Black-Eyed Pea" and "Cracker Barrel" restaurants.  

I used the garlic/butter variety of ritz crackers.. not sure if that helped in making this taste even yummier.. it's all I had ;)

I didn't use the last amount of butter (for fat/caloric reasons) either and it was still perfect and still very rich & creamy.

Tasted pretty good.  Could use a bit more seasoning.  I used half yellow squash and half zucchini squash to add some color.

Very good!  It takes some prep work, but it was worth it.  I added one piece of bacon for every squash and sauteed that with the onions and then added the squash to cook together.  I took this to an Easter dinner and there was nothing left!  Even my 5 year old nephew who doesn't like squash thought it was tasty!

Who needs dessert when you have this! I made it for the 1st time when I had company over. I tried this, along with Garlic Chicken (also on this website).  It was wonderful!!!  I made dessert, too, but was so full that we didn't even eat the dessert.  I have made it several times since & it has turned out great every time.  My children who don't eat anything that even resembles vegetables, liked this.  Thanks for such a great way to fix squash.  I'll be making it a lot this summer as my garden is covered up with squash :-)

This is a GREAT use of yellow squash.  I've tried many different squash casseroles in the past couple of years and they always are lacking in flavor.  This one doesn't.  I used reduced-fat Ritz crackers and cheddar cheese to help with the calories.  This is a keeper!!

I filled my baking pan with squash then sprinkled the diced onion and bread crumbs since I didn't have the crackers. I warmed milk, whisked in the eggs and melted butter. My milk wasn't very hot,  just enough to keep the butter melted. Then I poured that over everything.  I did not cook the squash ahead of time. I baked according to directions and served. The squash was not mushy at all and it was a huge hit. Definitely making this again.

I made this for a dinner party last night and it was a hit!  I used yellow squash & zucchini, otherwise I followed the recipe as written. Will be making this again!  Delish!

It's hard to go wrong with crackers, butter and squash. I microwaved the squash and onion and used fewer mixing bowls. Less to clean up and just as good.

Creamy and sweet, with a crisp crust.  I followed recipe exactly, but used low-fat Ritz crackers, 2% Mexican Cheese Blend and 1% milk.  I made a double recipe, and it just fit in my lasagna pan.  Everyone at the Labor Day pool party raved about how good it was.  No leftovers!  Tip:  35 crackers is one tube.

I made a low fat version of this (using reduced calorie Ritz crackers, 2% cheese, 1% milk, olive oil instead of the 1/4 cup butter and omitting the butter on top).  It was both fabulous and only 134 calories for 1/12. When I asked my husband how many stars to give it, he said 4 - until he found out that I made it healthier.  Then, he said it's absolutely 5 stars.  Kudos to Rosecart!

I have made this several times and have used 1/2 zucchini when I didn't have enough yellow squash.   I think using Ritz cracker makes a difference in the taste, so I always use them.

This was great!  My whole family enjoyed, so much that I will be using up many of my fresh summer squash from the garden to freeze this casserole to enjoy during the winter months.  I made the recipe as written for the first batch (since I believe if you are going to rate a recipe it should be as written), but will tweak with reduced fat cheese and less butter next time. 
This was so yummy!!
Thank you for sharing!

My mother requested a good squash casserole with cheese for Easter today, and this did not disappoint. I am making this my go-to squash casserole recipe. Only thing I did differently was using chicken broth in place of the water for steaming the squash. So good! Thanks for sharing, I love it!

Best I have ever eaten.  Didn't have buttery crackers and was afraid that the whole grain low fat wouldn't work but they were very crunchy and will use again.  Thank you for this recipe.  I have tried about 15 other recipes in past but this one was the perfect taste I have been searching for in a squash casserole.

This is so de-lish! We ate it all summer! Instead of sauteing the onion and squash I mircowave for 10-12 minutes. One less pan to wash.  I've doubled the egg and milk and had it as a nice breakfast casserole too.

I find that doubling the cheese (to enhance flavor and help absorb moisture) and baking it in a pan large enough to spread it thinly that it combats that mushiness that no one likes and gives it much more crunch.

I haven't made a squash casserole - this was easy and so tasty. I skimped a little on the butter and added extra squash. I didn't pre-cook the squash and it was fine, not soggy or crunchy. I like that you add some of the cracker mixture to the squash, not just on top. Very, very good.

Really good but just by reading the recipe, I knew it was going to need something extra.  I added chopped red pepper and diced garlic.  I also added a bit more cheese to the the topping.  It came out great!  Served with homemade New Mexico red chile sauce ladled over it!  Yum!

We really liked this and my kids wanted seconds, so it's a winner in our house!  I didn't mix the cheese and crackers.  I mixed half of the cheese in with the squash and then sprinkled the rest on top after putting mixture in the pan.  Sprinkled all the cracker crumbs on top and skipped the extra butter.  Turned out great!

We rarely have a family get-together without this casserole on the table...yes. it's that good!  For those of you having issues with mushy results I would suggest slicing your squash a little on the thick side and not overcooking in the skillet.  The dish might also need to bake a little longer depending on your oven. Mine took 30 minutes to brown evenly.  Let the dish rest for five or ten minutes before serving and it'll come together perfectly.  There are 13 of us at our holiday tables and everyone loves this one!

We are big squash lovers, but I was disappointed in this recipe. I agree with another reviewer that it was quite bland. It's a good base for a recipe, but I would add more spices for sure and maybe 1 cup more of squash.

WOW!  What a great recipe.  Thank you for sharing Rosecart.  I did use more yellow squash and alot more ritz than called for (probably by 1/4 more than called for).  Everything else was spot on.  Thank you!!

Do yourself a favor and skip this recipe. I made it for Thanksgivings and it was very bland. I will not be making this ever again.

My husband and I really enjoyed this recipe and so did my little children.  I used the squash from my garden, too.  I put in a little garlic powder and shredded the squash because my kids would eat it better, but other than that, I didn't change a thing and it was really tasty!  Thanks for the recipe!  I will make it again!!!

The first time I made this dish and everyone loved it and went back for seconds and thirds. I used both squash and zucchini.  Instead of crackers I used Italian flavored bread crumbs. I also did not par boil the veggies. I sweat the onions and layered everything and then added the milk and egg mixture over top. Topped off with cheese, bread crumbs and butter.  It was so delicious!!!!!

This is a very basic, very simple tasty casserole. It is delicious as is and stands on its own without a lot of the extras you find in other squash casseroles. I liked how easy it was to prepare. I took it to work and my co-workers couldn't stop raving. I couldn't help but think that I had made a better squash casserole in the past, but, was very happy with the way this one turned out. I made it exactly as written, only adding a tad of garlic and covering the top in cheese.

I didn't have fresh squash or onion but did have canned squash with vidalia onion, so I completely drained and used three of those; I also was out of crackers so I used 2 cups of boxed chicken flavored stuffing mix (and left out the salt).  This was the best squash casserole I've ever made and I didn't even have all the right ingredients!

Mmmm I loved this!  (Everyone else did too..)  I added 2 crushed cloves of garlic and a sprinkle of nutmeg to the squash/onion saute...gave it some nice flavor.  I'm not a casserole person but it's so hard to resist squash recipes this time of year.  Glad I caved~ thanks for the recipe =)

It was a tad watery and one of the people enjoying it found it a bit too egg-y, but I liked it a lot.  I would perhaps eliminate one of the eggs and add some more squash next time.

Great!  Even better if you coat the sliced squash with Kosher Salt and let it sit in a strainer for a while.  Then, rinse off squash and use in recipe.  This keeps the squash from getting soggy.

Yummy way to use up surplus yellow squash from the garden!  I added a clove of minced garlic, and omitted an egg and the butter on top.  To simplify and cut back on dishes, I mixed the shredded cheese with the cracker crumbs in the zip lock bag I used to crush the crackers, and beat the egg in the cup I used to then measure the milk.  I mixed all the ingredients in the large skillet I used to cook the onions and squash, and then transferred it to the 9x13 dish.  I found it needed an additional 10-15 min. in the oven before the top got lightly browned.  Be sure to wait for it to brown, since that's the best part :)

This casserole is awesome! I didn't expect to like it so much. I cut the recipe in half, baked in a 8x8 dish, and used garlic salt and saltine crackers instead. Turned out great. Thanks for the recipe!!

I absolutely hate squash, but you know how it is when those friends with green thumbs are generous. Great way to get the produce off my counter and unbelievable flavor infused with a comforting warmth.

ALSO, to avoid the mushy crust. If you melt the butter and mix into the cheese/cracker mixture - it makes for a much crispier topping.
I made this for thanksgiving a few years back and it has been requested every year since.

This recipe was excellent!! I did make minimal changes because I wanted more cheese. I used half shredded sharp cheddar and half shredded Blarney Cheese(available at Sam's). I threw in a little extra of both types of cheeses for fun! I also added two heaping spoonfuls of cream cheese to the milk mixture along with the melted butter. The hot butter melted the cream cheese very well. Other than that, I did this recipe exactly as it said to. I made this for a side dish at Christmas and there was none left! Next time I will double the recipe because I had people wanting more!!!

This is a very good and different way to prepare squash.  I added green onion instead of regular onion, and lots of garlic powder and dried basil for flavor.  I also like that this could be served as a main or side dish.  Thanks for the recipe, I'll make this often!

This is now in regular meal rotation. It's quick and well-received. If you want to avoid the partially hydrogenated oils in most buttery round crackers, Cabaret makes a trans fat free version that tastes great.

Can't figure out how to rate this.  We loved the flavors, but if you make it as stated, you would have a squash custard rather than a vegetable dish.  Four cups of squash, uncooked, is about 1 pound and would be less than two cups after cooking.  Based on other recipes I've looked at, I'm pretty sure the ingredient list is supposed to say 4 pounds, not 4 cups.  (Dinner was not a disaster.  I could see that something was wrong and reduce the other ingredients by half, and we really liked the dish.)

Make sure you slice your squash thin. I was a dummy and sliced some of it a bit too thick, so it didn't cook all the way.  The leftovers tasted better than the original dish in my opinion.  I give it 5 stars even though my dish only came out as a 3-star recipe...this was my fault. It's a great recipe and I plan on trying it again very soon.

This was excellent.  I took the advise of prior reviews and only used one egg.  I also had to double the cracker mixture because it was a little too thin in my casserole dish.  It went over really well and I'll be making this again!

I was looking for a yellow squash casserole to remind me of one "like Mom made," and decided to try this one. It was a delicious addition to our Thanksgiving dinner, and even though I was hoping for leftovers, it was scarfed up by absolutely everyone, even those self-proclaimed veggie haters!! I will make this often!

Absolutely the best squash recipe I've ever tried.  I did take a suggestion from another review and use only one egg.  I also sauted the squash and onion in butter for a few minutes.  Thanks!

This squash casserole is delicious!  I made it for a dinner party a few days ago and everyone ranted and raved about how great it was (especially the men).  I liked it so much I plan on making it for Thanksgiving.  I am throwing my other squash casserole recipes out and replacing with this one!

Very good and easy to make.  The melted butter poured over the top of it was deelicious... so much for healthy?  But, it was good and I do not normally like squash.  Thanks

I've now made this several times for guests and every time I do it comes out great and everyone really loves it.  Not too often a vegi side dish is a hit with all!  The buttery crackers make a difference though; I substituted low-fat crackers once and it wasn't quite as good.

I sliced and cut my slices in half... Next time I may sclice thinly, as those who are not a fan of squash, in my house, are still on the fence with this... But it was great. A light casserole, being no meat or rice, makes it the perfect add along to any meal. Great reheated. Butter tastes better than margarine on this. . Worth the extra calories. I myself added a cup of onions, as they are plentiful right now and we eat alot of onions. This dish would probably be great with some garlic added in too... if having an Italian night. It only takes 2 med/large squash. Bought the Dollar General version of ritz for $1.50. Overall, it is cheap, cheezy, buttery goodness . Can cook it of the morning and reheat in microwave for dinner, it comes out just fine.

This is an easy, foolproof recipe which gives you a delicious, cheesy dish every single time. I usually double & 1/2 this recipe because my family loves it so! My sons are the farmers who actually grow the squash we use for this dish!!

I used 2 cups of cheese, 2 tubes of crackers and a whole onion.  I mixed 1/2 the crackers with 1/2 the cheese.  Otherwise, proceed as directed.  A smashing success every time I make it.  Now I need to make 2 pans so everyone has takeout.  It was the most requested dish for Thanksgiving!

I do love this recipe! I made as written the first time, but found it a little to soggy for our tastes. Now when I make it, and it is pretty often, I omit the melted butter, use only one egg and a little splash of milk and will add zucchinni when I have it. I also do not add water to the squash and onions as plenty of moisture is released from the squash when cooking. I season the squash after slicing and drizzle with a touch of olive oil.

Excellent! I cooked the  squash in butter until soft, no water, then added Panko instead of crackers,  spread in baking dish. Layer of shredded cheddar cheese on top of the squash,  (the Panko absorbs any moisture) then poured milk and egg mixture over the cheese.  Panko breadcrumbs on top, dotted with butter and baked per directions.  Turned out perfectly!  This is definitely the best Squash Casserole I have ever made. The Panko makes it so light and crispy on top. Thank you for the recipe.

FYI: 35 Crackers is one sleeve of Ritz or 1 1/2 cups of crumbs.
I am always looking for ways to get my kids to eat veggies and this certainly did the trick.  
I didn't have buttery crackers, so I used cheese crackers instead.
I like to include green veggies with every meal so I added fresh spinach.  It looked and tasted wonderful.  This recipe would taste great with broccoli or zucchini added to the yellow squash too.  I would definitely make this again.

I so love this recipe!!!! This was my first summer to have a garden and since my yellow squash and zucchini came in I have made this casserole three times. It is also good to use both squash in it. Great recipe and my husband (who does not like squash) likes this. Great job.----Robin-TN

I made this a couple nights ago and it came out great! I made some modifications: I sliced 4 cups of yellow squash squash and a bit of zucchini I needed to use up, tossed it with salt and placed it in a colander set over a bowl to let some of the water drain out. Besides that and subbing milk for heavy cream (since I happened to have it on hand), adding more cheese to the mix (I got carried away with the grater), and using a smaller dish (I like a taller/thicker looking casserole - this did increase the cooking time a bit), I did not change the preparation. Well, when I write it all out it seems like I changed a lot... So, let's say that this is flexible recipe that is difficult to mess up, tastes great and uses readily available ingredients! Try it! ^_^

Delicious! After reading many reviews I jazzed it up by starting with 8 slices of thick cut applewood bacon fried in a skillet. Removed the bacon and add a whole small thin sliced onion and one diced jalepeno to bacon grease. I added closer to 8 cups of squash sliced 1/4" thick and quartered to the hot onions in the skillet and stir fried them until almost soft. If the squash is large try slicing and quartering then cut out the large seed section to prevent a mushy casserole. A pack of GLUTEN FREE rice rounds crushed were exchanged for the butter cracker along with using Monterey Jack cheese. I used fresh ground Himalayan Pink sea salt over the top and cooked the dish for about 30 minutes. No butter needed when using the bacon. Bacon makes the dish. Oh yeah and I topped the serving with a small dollop of sour cream. Decadent!

Followed the recipe!! Moist & cheesy at the same time!! A little plain, but husband liked it (not a big squash fan) so I didn't  alter recipe. You could add herbs & spices that you like.

Ladies, Definitely a KEEPER!!! Chopped my
squash into bite size pieces as I did with
the onion,steamed,drained. Instead of 2 eggs
used 1 egg,garlic powder less then 3/4 cup of
milk mix all others to ingredient. Combine butter
with cracker crumbs/cheese, spread on top of
casserole. ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS…..Toejoe..

This was great. I made a few changes. I found this to be a little bland so added garlic powder and dash of red pepper. I added 1/2 cup of sour cream to make it creamier and topped with French fried onions for extra crunch. Loved this recipe and will definitely make again!

I LOVE LOVE LOVE this recipe! I have made it about 5 times, but have modified the recipe a little bit. First, I often cook chicken breast, cut it up into cubes, and mix it in with the casserole. Next, I use both yellow squash and zucchini (it looks much more colorful) and cook them in chicken stock instead of water. I also add minced garlic into the squash while cooking it. The recipe turns out much better this way in my opinion!

A very tasty casserole. I used club crackers, since I had them on hand; also added a little cayenne pepper & granulated garlic and cut down on the butter. I used regular milk and full fat cheese, so I only added the butter dots on the topping -about 1 1/2 tablespoons.

Oh wow!!! Love this dish. I have already made it at least 5 times since I found this recipe. I have had to use different crackers, generally using whatever crackers are currently in my pantry, from garlic herb, to buttery. All taste swell, and you can add bread crumbs if low on crackers. I usually add more cheese and mix up the cheese, but I'm a cheese lover, and I've also added fresh garlic when sautéing my onions, but absolutely love the dish even when following the recipe exactly. This is one side dish that is never leftover! I haven't run across anyone that does not like it so far! And the best part, it's so incredibly easy to make, and does not require a large amount of ingredients or mess.

Very good way to use up your summer squash and make a vegetable the whole family will love. I might try it with bread crumbs or corn flakes next time, I don't usually have crackers on hand and I'm sure it will be good that way as well.

very good. I took the advice from one comment and left the squash raw to bake in the oven. I added left over chicken for some protein. It was a satisfying and healthy meal.

Thanks

This is a super easy and great recipe for squash. I combined yellow squash with zucchini.  I did think it needed a bit more seasoning, but with some additional fresh sea salt and freshly ground pepper it was a big hit.  Next time I will add bacon as suggested by some others.  You won't be disappointed if you try it!

I believe it better to have casserole approximately 1" thick to avoid ingredients drying out.

My family loved this casserole. Instead of adding water and then draining it from the squash I cooked the squash and onion in the 1/4 cup of butter. No draining and wasting all that vegetable goodness. I also used 2 sleeves of buttery crackers, I didn't count out 35 of them. Turned out great!

I made minor adjustments as the original recipe sounded pretty good as is. I cut the butter down quite a bit (both inside and omitted the pats on the top),added garlic powder (next time I'll probably saute minced garlic with the veggies), and I added sliced kielbasa sausage to it to make it a main dish. Not typically the first meat you think of for a casserole but its what I had on hand and it was quick. Better yet it tasted great with the squash. This recipe is definitely a keeper.

Delish!  Changes:  Rather than boiling the squash and onions, I sautéed them with a little olive oil and butter, and I added a squashed garlic clove; I also added 1/2 sleeve of ritz crackers.  Comfort food to die for.

I am in love with this recipe.  I saute the onion with a clove of minced garlic until caramelized, then set that aside and steam the squash and zucchini for about 5 minutes in a little broth.  I also add 1/2 tsp of nutmeg which tastes amazing.  I use low-fat cheese, milk, margarine, and crackers and it still tastes decadent.  I also reduce the amount of margarine on top to just 1 Tbsp instead of 2 and it still tastes deliciously buttery.  It keeps very well in the fridge and actually makes a yummy breakfast dish the next morning.

The egg definitely ruined this dish.  It was like a mushy quiche on the bottom.  The top part (that was not part of the egg milk mixture) was great, a little bland but had a lot of potential and looked more like the picture.  If I were to make this again I would omit the egg and milk and just stir in a small bit of sour cream instead.  and more seasoning.

I grew up eating squash casserole. My grandmother made a super great version. This one pales in comparison. We got summer squash in our CSA box and I was craving this casserole. My husband said that he thinks there are better versions out there. It wasn't horrible, it just wasn't what I was looking for.

Made on 9/3/12 - next time BARELY cook the squash - for 4 cups squash keep it to 1/2 cup onion since I used about 1 cup and didn't like it.  I also used 3 lg. strips bacon which was good.  I used about 40 crackers and 6T butter IN the casserole and still 2T on top.  I drained it VERY well after cooking the veggies but it was just too mushy.

Great use of that abundance of summer squash! I had some leftover turkey bacon to use up, so I diced it and sauteed with a medium onion sliced into thin rings. I added the squash, a few splashes of garlic-infused olive oil, pepper, onion/garlic powders, and sauteed a few minutes more. I used a mix of sharp cheddar cheese and an Italian blend. I used Club crackers, however, next time I'll likely use a mix of crushed croutons and Panko. Thinking the casserole would be too "wet" I decreased the milk a bit, but will use called-for amount next time. I also only used 2 T melted butter total, which worked out well. Easy dinner to prep and make on a busy weeknight and both husband and daughter went nuts for it! Thanks for a great idea that provided a very tasty one-dish meal!

This is a wonderful way to use some of that garden bounty; it's delicious.  I added a couple sliced carrots and a large clove of garlic, minced, to it to punch up the color and flavor and can see using broccoli, cauliflower and/or zuchinni to it as well.  I didn't boil the squash and carrots,  I sauteed them in 1 tbsp each of butter and olive oil for about 5 minutes and followed the instructions from there.  I did add a pinch of my garden thyme to it also.  Will definately make this again.  Family  loved it.

Awesome use of fresh squash and many other ingredients I had in the house already. Tempted to devour the whole thing as a meal itself. My only concern was that it was spread thin in some places because of the pan size. I would live to try a smaller pan with more depth next time to see how it would do.

Very nice flavor and perfect cook time. If I was to change next time I would remove an egg. I love the flavor of squash and don't want to overpower it with the extra egg. My family of 4 ate off of this 3 times.

I grew up eating my Mama's delicious squash casserole.  This one isn't as good, but it's fine.  I really missed the creaminess of my Mama's, so next time I'll add a can of cream of mushroom, 1/2 cup, or more, sour cream and an additional cup of cheddar cheese.  I tried some of the reviewers' tip to not bother pre-cooking the squash, but I wasn't happy with the result.  In squash casserole, I want the squash to be soft and tender and when I didn't pre-cook it, it stayed a tiny bit crispy/crunchy, especially the skin, which I found not to my liking.  So, bottom line, I think you need to pre-cook the squash as the recipe instructs, but also add the cream of mushroom, sour cream and extra cheese found in more traditional, older, squash casserole recipes.

My teenage niece, a very picky eater, was staying with us for a few months, and she fell in love with this mild-flavored, delicious recipe and would eat it for every meal. If you want it a little bit spicier, add a tsp of red pepper flakes, but it's perfect as is.

This is the only recipe for a squash casserole you will ever need. The only thing I changed was to use only 1/2 cup of milk instead of 3/4 and I used a few more onions. If you are a true squash lover, you won't be able to put this dish down without help from someone...it is just that good.

5 stars Best recipe I've found in a long time! I have made it 6 times in the last 2 wks. I made it 20 cups not 4, and added a can of jalapeno salsa, substituted a portion of the cheddar in the mix with mexican velveeta, and added a little chopped jalapenos in the mix. After slicing the squash I put it, the chopped sweet onions and peppers in the processor for just a few quick blends then into the pan for softening..I love this so much, and have shared with so many people now they just can't get enough!!

So good!  My picky eaters loved it.  I used half zucchini and would recommend doubling.  There were 3 adults and 5 kid and we were scraping the pan.

Yummmm!  My aunt who is ok with squash...loved this. I only had the large club like squash in my garden, so after de seeding it I cut it into cubes instead of slicing.  It took about 10 to 15 minutes to soften instead of just 5 minutes.  I also salted and peppered it at this step instead of later on. For those on ww or just low fat diets could easily adjust this recipe. the added butter really isnt necessary...just leave it out. Using low fat cheese and low fat or fat free crackers can also really reduce the amt of calories.

used bread crumbs instead of crackers and heavy cream instead of milk (out of milk) and the kids LOVED it!!  I'm going to make it again this week and use 1/2 zucchini and 1/2 yellow squash.  YUMMY!

Used only 1/2 cup shredded cheese and 1 egg and 2 T melted butter. Added the melted butter to the squash mixture and patted the topping into the casserole to soak up the liquids from the casserole as it baked. I think I could use less crackers to make it even less fattening and not lose any flavor. It baked up nicely and was not runny at all.

This recipes is a little bland for me. Once I added a shake of salt to my plated portion, it was much better. SO, I will add a little more salt (squash is pretty bland, afterall) and maybe some garlic. Oh...and I took the advose of another member and added about 2 tsp. of real bacon bits. Very good once changed for my taste.

Great way to use up yellow squash from the garden.  Made it as stated except I halved the recipe for two of us and baked it in my new toaster oven.  Will definitely make again.

I do not like yellow squash, but was gifted some from a friend's garden. This was fantastic! I added more of the Ritz/cheese mixture to the filling because it seemed very liquidy and it was perfect. Making it again tonight with zucchini. UPDATE: Not as good with zucchini...too watery.

I can't even tell you how good this was. Unfortunately I did not have the onion so I put in a bunch of different peppers that I needed to use, but still it was delicious. I did everything else just as written. You have to try this to believe it

This was so delicious! I used zucchini instead of yellow squash. I got distracted and forgot to stir in the 1/4 cup of melted butter. I already put the rest of the topping on, so I just drizzled it on top. It still came out fantastic!

I was almost shocked and how good and easy this was. It was not a hit with my 5 and 9yr olds (I was hoping I could slip in veggies with this), but my husband who isn't a big fan of veggies (squash specifically) gave it a thumbs up. I didn't change anything from the recipe and it wasn't mushy.

I love love love this!  I'd been looking for a good squash casserole recipe and am so glad I found this one!  I made one substitution just because I'm diabetic.  Instead of using the buttery crackers, I used whole wheat saltine crackers.  It turned out amazingly well and I know I'll make this MANY more times in the future!!  Already planning a double batch this weekend. :)

Dang, this tasted GREAT!!!  Followed as is except I used a combination of squash and zucchini for more color, added garlic and more cheese.  Definitely a flavorful dish.

Excellent!  I left out the onion because we don't like them.  Hubby said several times how good it was and between the 2 of us we almost finished off the whole thing!  I think this is my new favorite way to make yellow squash!  Thank you for an easy recipe that I will make again and again!

I was looking for a squash casserole and found this. I followed the recipe excatly except I left out the black pepper. And, I only had frozen sliced squash and used that. The only downside to doing that was after defrosting them I didn't cook them long enough, because I assumed they were pretty much already cooked. Next time I would cook them longer. I liked that the recipe allowed me to subtitute for lite dairy products as suggested, and I did do that. The only downside is the strange eggy parts and it makes more of a squash with cheese and bread crumbs, but not what I would consider a casserole. But, still a pretty good recipe. It went well with our meal today though, thanks!

This is the best squash recipe ever! I use it quite often. I sometimes mix in zucchini as well, it all tastes great.

Not a filling main dish by itself so this is what I did..  I added 1 can chicken breast in water and cut up celery to the squash/onion mixture, sprinkled garlic salt and heated them together..  In lieu of crackers I used corn flakes..less time consuming and a bit lighter (you may want to add more salt to compensate, but I try to cut down on salt in recipes). Final product was really thin in a 9x13 (and that's with the extra chicken and celery!) and required a pretty big portion to be at all filling. Next time I will double the recipe or use an 8x8 dish.

Delicious, satisfying...an awesome way to use squash.  I had it as my main dish, no meat needed.  Reduced the fat content w/low-fat cheese, margarine & milk.  Didn't have Ritz, so I used a combination of 3 different types of crackers. Definite do-over.

As written, I found this to be too bland.  It might be pretty good if you add seasonings to your own taste, but I rated 3 stars based on the way it was written.

I tried this recipe and it was delicious and buttery even after day # 2.  The only thing I did different was use a bag of frozen squash, but the measurement was the same.

Didn't care for this though my husband and 5 year old enjoyed it. It was very bland and I didn't care for the mushy crackers inside the casserole.

i have been making this recipe for years. Instead of cooking squash in water, I just saute onions with bacon bits then add squash and cook with lid on until tender. Squash has so much liquid in it that you don't need the added water and will keep it from tasting watery.

This recipe was a good base idea but I felt it lacked flavor by itself. I sauteed the onions first with some garlic. I also added a little mustard and curry powder to the milk/egg mixture before I poured it over. It gave it a deeper flavor without being over powering.

This was only ok for me . . . mine looked nothing like the picture.  It was REALLY greasy from the butter.  In fact, when I took it out of the oven, there was so much oil simmering in the pan-and I didn't even add the butter on top, and only added about 3 T to the mix.  The crackers have plenty of oil too I guess so maybe that was why it was so greasy?  Also precooking the squash made mine really soggy and mushy.  And even though there were only 2 eggs, it tasted pretty eggy to me and my DH (who normally loves eggs and never says that).  Overall, while it tasted ok, it was a lot of calories and fat for something that was just average.  I added garlic and a little seasoned salt as some reviewers mentioned it being bland.  Other than that, I followed the recipe but it just didn't turn out the way I hoped!

Delicious!  Perfect way to use summer squash.  I didn't have crackers on hand, so I substituted 1 1/2 cups of seasoned bread crumbs; also added a fair amount of garlic and a little nutmeg.  YUM!

We really liked this recipe, but found the as is one a bit bland.  So, I added 3/4 teaspoon garlic powder and sprinkled the top with cinnamon before baking.  These two additions helped the flavor immensely and it has become one of our favorites.  If you are a nutmeg fan, could sprinkle with nutmeg or a combination of cinnamon and nutmeg.

Perfect simple summer casserole.  I made as recipe recommended, but with whole wheat Ritz crackers, skim milk, and just 2 TB butter in casserole with none dotted on top.  Just simple and yummy!

Added 5 strips of crumbled bacon. Sauteed the onions and squash in the bacon drippings. Added some feta cheese (only because it needed to be used up before spoiling). This almost had a "quiche" taste & texture. We will definitely make this again. The leftovers were even better. Highly recommend.

I made this for our weekly family supper with my in-laws the other night and everyone is still talking about it. The only change I made was to saute bacon while sauteing the squash with the onion & I added garlic powder when I added the salt & pepper. We grow yellow squash in our garden and have an abumdance every summer. My mother-in-law & sister-in-law have both requested the recipe. This will definately be one recipe that will now be a staple for us southerners. Thank you so much for sharing.

YUM!!!!! I used only one egg, a bit of garlic powder and a bit more cheese. Only minor adjustments to a really great dish! My husband and I were snaking out of the baking dish before we served it...we couldn't wait!   OH...and also sprinkled some spare shredded cheese on the top right before it was done baking. It made for a nice chewy addition to the crunchy topping! We will make this again and again!

I made this dish last night and it was wonderful.  I added Parmesan cheese in addition to the cheddar.  I also used 1/2 cup of milk and didn't use all of the egg mixture.  After I crushed the ritz crackers I added melted butter to them.

I made this recipe last night but made a few changes to it.  I prefer my veggies with a little more texture to them so I didn't pre-cook the squash. I just baked it for a little longer than suggested.  I did saute the onions for a few minutes so they would get soft.  I used 2 cups of 2% cheese, non-fat dry milk, and whole wheat ritz crackers. I also chopped up a small tomato and added that to the veggies before baking.  I did not add the remaining crumb topping until about the last ten minutes of cook time. This came out great.  The only thing I will probably change next time is to omit the cracker crumbs from inside the dish (gets kind of mushy) and I would add more tomatoes or possible a can of diced tomatoes.  This is a very versatile recipe.

This is a fantastic dish... its suppossed to be mushy but i have cokked this a lot and experimented with different things and if you cook the squash for the alotted time minus 5 to 7 minutes... it turns out a little crispier. also i added garlic salt and celery to mine and it was fantastic, i use saltine crackers instead of ritz because i dont really enjoy ritz but the salktines made a delicious substitute also im going to also add scallions to this recipe this weekend!

This is fabulous. Very tasty. I was concerned before I put it in the oven because it seemed soupy, but it firmed right up and looked beautiful when it came out.

This is my fav squash cass recipe. You can really make two almost completely different dishes out of it. If you make it exactly as written you have a casserole but if you quarter the squash instead of slice and then boil it down for a while you have more of a souffle type dish. Very yummy either way!

I loved it!  I modified it just a bit so it would be more Weight Watcher friendly.  I used Reduced Fat Ritz Crackers, Weight Watchers Mexican Shredded Cheese, 1 egg and 1 egg white, 1% milk, light butter.  It was excellent, my 5 year old and 11 month old ate.  PLUS it's only 2 points!

Excellent but I changed a bunch of things.  I was afraid it was going to be too mushy and bland with just boiling the squash in the water so I pan fried it with fresh onions, garlic and basil.  I used soy milk instead of regular milk. I also added some left over chicken sausage from the night before that had feta and spinach in it.  It made a full meal for my family and they were all thumbs up!  Thanks, I think it was one of the most satisfying caseroles I've ever made!!  Thanks -Daphne

I have had scalloped yellow squash forever and love it. I decided I needed a change and tried this recipe. I halved it because I was cooking for 2. Could have made the whole recipe and probably would have eaten it all. I used garlic salt and garlic pepper. For the cheese I used seriously sharp cheddar cheese. I did not pre-cook the squash and onions. It took about 15 mins to bake. OMG it was good!!!

Just as I was collection my ingredients for this, I realized I did not have "round buttery crackers".  So, I used mini Ritz cheese filled crackers.  Turned out just great.  The suggestion to put the crumb topping on halfway through the baking time was right on also.  Thanks Rosecart for a good way to use those summer crook neck squash.

I followed this recipe *almost* exactly - the only change I made was to remove the butter, both from inside the dish as well as on top.  In my opinin, the butter was unnecessary because the eggs, milk and crackers gave this dish all the richness it needed.  The end result was quite tasty (although my husband thought it was less so than I did).  The only reason it didn't get 5 stars from me is that the crackers which I added to the squash turned out very mushy so the consistency was a little....off.  If the texture of your food is an issue - you may want to avoid this, but the flavor was certainly good!

First time making squash.  Cut recipe in half.  Omitted butter in middle, used extra crackers.  Next time would recommend cheese then crackers on top (layer rather than mixing).

Awesome recipe, though it does lack pizazz. I added fresh garlic to the butter while it melted (1 giant clove, crushed and minced), a little nutmeg to the top, and some fresh parmesan too... so creamy and decadent with fresh garden squash!

I also added bacon.  And then cooked the onion in the bacon fat.  I think this is a great recipe!  Much better than the canned soup variety!  Anyway, squash +milk +bacon = tasty.

Yummy! I did make a couple small changes... saw another recipie added 2 tbsp. pimentos, which really added a great flavor to this dish. Also did 1/2 yellow squash and 1/2 zucchini with excellent results. Used breadcrumbs instead of crackers because that's what I had. My husband LOVED this dish!

I added 2 large grilled chicken breasts seasoned with salt and pepper to this recipe.  Chop into small bite-sized cubes and stir it into the squash mixture.  I also seasoned the squash with oregano and a cajun seasoning mix.  My husband and I have decided to add this to our weeknight favorites list!  DELICIOUS!!

Where has this recipe been all my life!? It's absolutely wonderful!! I did as someone suggested and cooked my squash and onion in a little olive oil instead of water and I added half a toe of fresh garlic. Other than that I followed the recipe to the letter. Thanks for sharing this recipe.

Very good and relatively easy!  My boys ate it better this way than the plain old way I had been preparing squash and zucchini.  I did use two yellow squash and two zucchini for this recipe.  I also added real bacon bits to the veggies while they were cooking...very good!  Would probably add even more bacon the next time.

Absolutely loved the recipe but I made some minor modifications to suit my taste buds the second time I cooked it.  First I used Cheddar Jack Cheez-Its instead of the butter round crackers and then omitted the 1/4 Cup Melted Butter so it wouldn't be too greasy and mushy.  

I will continue to make this recipe over and over.  Thank you!

I love squash, but this ended up tasting mostly like milk.  Liberal amounts of garlic powder and garlic sea salt on the finished product made it edible, but I won't make it again.

That said, this recipe is great for people who aren't particular to leaner foods - the milky, buttery taste is quite good to most people, especially children who may have a hard time eating their veggies.

Also, it's always a good idea to throw a pinch of salt (no more!) into any water for cooking veggies.  It prevents the water from soaking up all the nutrients & flavor.

I've made this recipe dozens of times. One thing I'd have to say is that this recipe has a fine line for perfection. It can get soggy really easily. If you slice the squash too thin or add too much water to the pan the whole thing comes out a mushy mess. Cut the squash too thick and don't add enough water and it loses that wonderful buttery taste. 
That being said, when it is just right, this recipe is absolutely wonderful. It's definitely a five star favorite!

My grandmother gave me a mess of yellow squash out of her garden.  I had a company cookout to attend and made this casserole for the cookout.  Everyone raved about how good it was and I was asked for the recipe by the hostess.  My husband prefers this recipe over the one I've made for years.

This was delicious!  I was skeptical about this recipe. The ingredients just didn't look that exciting, but based on the excellent reviews, I decided to give it a try and made it exactly as prescribed.  OH MY GOODNESS! My husband and I ate a good 3/4 of it in one sitting.  We finished it off for dinner the next day. It was just as delicious re-heated.  This will definitely be going to our next church potluck.  Thanks for sharing!

This recipe is great. I use my sister's advice and add 1 slice of bacon (chopped) per squash used and cook them up with the onions. The rest of the dish is made as directed in the recipe. Deelish!

This is a great recipe!  I made this as a side dish for Christmas dinner and everyone loved it!  I used low sodium crackers as well as Smart Balance instead of regular butter and it still turned out great!  Thanks!

This was exactly what I was looking for.  I didn't want the runny type of squash casserole made with soup and an over abundance of cheese.  I probably used more squash than the 4 cups (I had bought 2.75 lbs, so that's what I used) and I used about 3/4 cup chopped onion.  I left all the other ingredients the same and ended up with what I would call the perfect squash casserole.  Thanks Rosalie.

This was a big hit at Thanksgiving! I used the suggestion of adding sour cream and bacon and because I didn't have any crackers on hand, I substituted herbed stuffing crumbs. It was to die for! Thanks!

Delicious!! My neighbor gave me some home grown yellow squash and I had to find some recipe quick since I don't eat this vegetable.  Searched here and found this recipe, read all the reviews,twice and took some of the advice of members. I sliced thin  added smidgen of minced garlic  chives from my herb garden  used 45 crackers  1/2 milk plus 1/4 sour cream  and put all into an 8X11 baking dish. This was absolutely delicious and I shall make again and again as I did tonight for a main dish. Can't wait for the tomatoes to ripen completely. They will compliment this dish to a "T". Thank you Rosalie and others for your suggestions.  I now will not shudder at the mention of "yellow squash".

Family keeps asking for this one! THANKS! I did not have enough crackers the last time I made this - I used the crackers for the topping and for the inside of the casserole I took the ends from wheat bread and toasted them extremely well. Then I crumbled them up with the cheese and mixed it into the squash and onions mix. It worked very well.

Very easy and fast to prep. I added a little tarragon to the final  cheese/cracker mixture that goes on top of the caaserole. This added a fragrant, sweet smell that compliments the topping. Next time I think I might add 1/4 cup of suger to the milk mixture to give it a little  sweeter taste.

i hate squash, but every bite of this was great! i ran out of crackers, and had to use about 1/2 c. stuffing mix, and it was still awesome.  Freezes really well.

This is a very good recipe.  However, I don't think 5 mins is enough cooking prior to assembling the casserole.  You don't want mushy squash but I like mine on the softer side.  More like a twice baked casserole.  I have only made this once so just cook the squash until they are good and tender but way before they fall apart.

I made this recipe twice...once at home and my family loved. I then modified it a bit for office luncheon. I added more squash as I like a "thicker" casserole and more onion for more taste. EXCELLENT flavor...everyone is asking for the recipe. Thanks :o)

Very tasty.  A different take on a plain vegetable.  I did not have trouble with it being too "custardy."  If I had one complaint, it was that it was too tame.  The onions didn't really add much; perhaps it might be more interesting with a little green pepper or mushroom, or even some diced tomato.  It was good, though, and quite easy to prepare. I barely precooked the squash, and I did all the mixing right in the 9x13 pan.  I'll use this again.

Made this last night and it was so yummy!  I read a lot of the reviews and made a few changes as suggested.  I added garlic in with the onions but did not saute the squash and I used just one egg.  Covered with foil and that helped the squash be done in the right amount of time.  Excellent way to use up squash from our garden!

I'll admit, I had my doubts about this recipe.  I mean, squash and crackers???  However, it came out great.  After reading the comments, I sauted a clove of garlic with the onion in the melted butter, then mixed it with the raw slices of squash.  I also sprinkled a little oregano in it.

Easy to throw together; all ingredients were on hand.  I used red onion because it's all I had, and it added a nice flavor.  Hubby loved this, which was great because he groaned earlier in the day when I mentioned we'd be having squash for dinner.  We've been having grilled squash a lot this season, and I guess he was tired of it.  Anyway, he loved this!

This was excellent.  The only additions I made were small fresh bread cubes on the top and then a sprinkling of Creole seasoning.  It was rich and filling enough to serve alone with steaks, didn't even need potatoes or rice.

Loved this, but must be a fan of the yellow squash, which I am!  I brought it too a family get together and no one touched it hardly, not squash fans I guess; I loved it and so did my husband, and it is really easy!

I halved the recipe, there are only 4 of us. Was very tasty. A great way to use up the frozen squash I have left from the summer. My kids even liked it.

Sorry, but this didn't cut it with my family. It was too buttery and lacked flavor. I ended up throwing most of it out.

This is a very nice squash casserole and not as fatting as many which typically call for mayo.  I reduced the fat some by adding about 2 T margerine instead of 1/4 cup butter and not using any butter at the end.  I thought it was just as good as if I had used the full amount.  Another nice thing about this recipe is that you could still taste the squash...sometimes the vegetables get lost in this type of dish.

Take it from a southern cook--Do cook your squash first!  It is a watery veggie and you must allow it to drain and then pat dry with a paper towel otherwise you will have a soupy mess.  Sauteed onion is a nice addition. Good basic recipe for a quick side dish.

My goodness! This is delicious. I made it for Church dinner and it was gone when I went to get my dish. I had to do a little subsituting since I didn't have any buttery round crackers. I used Panko bread crumbs and added 4 T of butter to the cheese mixture.  It will be my go to recipe next slummer when I am over run with yellow squash.

I needed to do something with the growing number of summer squash in the garden. This recipe did not disappoint! I had to hide it in the fridge so I didn't eat half of it in one sitting. Oh, I used a 2qt casserole dish instead of  9x13, baked until the top was gold and crispy.

This turned out way better than I thought it would. The family loved it. I did add garlic powder, Creole seasoning and doubled the onions. Easy and good.

Loved this recipe. I did change the way I cooked the squash as suggested by other reviewers, cooking in a frying pan with small amount of water so the squash was not mushy but was soft. I also added the salt and pepper to the squash while it was cooking on the stove top. Ingredient wise, I stuck to the recipe. Next time I will add garlic powder to the squash, I think will make it even better!

This was so good I ate half of it for dinner and I will make it again this week. I added 1 jalapeno, 1/4 cup each red, green, and yellow bell pepper, 1 tsp garlic powder, 1 tsp sugar, 1/2 tsp oregano, extra butter on top, and I substituted yogurt for the milk.

Only thing I did different was to melt the 2 tlbsps. of butter and stir it into the cracker crumbs for the topping.  It makes the topping come out more even.

Amazing! So much better than the sour cream or "cream of" soup recipes!! This was outstanding, even my picky husband who is very particular about his southern food gave it two thumbs up. I'm throwing out my other recipes for squash casserole...this is the one I will use from now on. The only change I made was to use only one egg instead of two, and I used the everything flavored Ritz crackers instead of plain, what good flavor they added to this yummy casserole!
Thanks for the recipe.

I made a few changes to this recipe.  I added 1/2 tsp of garlic powder and 1 tsp of Seven Seasons Dry Italian salad dressing seasoning.  Instead of milk I used evaporated milk (I also use this in my mac and cheese).  I only dotted the top with butter once removed from the oven.  Pretty good if I must say so.

People beg me to bring this to all "Pitchin" and family event cookouts! It's a favorite by all and I never have leftovers unless I make a double batch. Use the smaller size yellow squash because they're sweeter and it usually takes 4-6 of those, 4 when using the larger size. Love this "bunches!" Sheryl

I used this recipe last night to use up some of my squash in the garden, and I was not disappointed!  All I would recommend would be to add a little more cheese (we like it cheesy) and a little less milk (made it just a touch too soupy for our taste).  Other than that, wonderful squash recipe!

This was really good. My only tip is to REALLY drain your squash/onion mixture well. I let mine drain in a colander for a minute or two, and my casserole was still a little soggy. Next time, I'll make sure to press down on the veggies a little to squeeze out the extra water.

Better recipe than the ingredients implicate...I really even like it as an entrée. I did lightly saute & season the Squash & Onions (I also used half zucchini)with herbs de provence. Lovely dish!

I've been wanting to try this recipe for awhile. Finally yellow squash went on sale! I decided it was the perfect time. It would be great as a side dish or like what we did, used it as a main dish for lunch. The creamy squash and cheese filling was a nice contrast to the cracker topping. Next time we make it, if yellow squash is too high in price , we might try zucchini instead.

I made this and we love it.  I made a few changes though.  I didn't have any buttery round crackers so I substituted 1/2 crushed corn chips and 1/2 Italian bread crumbs. I used 1/2t garlic salt because the corn chips are so salty.  I put about 1/2c Mexican blend cheese on top.  I baked it without the topping and with the lid on the casserole dish for about 20 minutes and also baked at a lower temperature:  350 degrees.  I added the topping and Mexican cheese for the last 10 minutes of baking and removed the lid.  I let it sit for 15 minutes after removing it from the oven so it could set up.  It turned out great; we were very pleased.  Thank you very much for the recipe.

Delicious!  This is so simple yet flavorful.  The first time I made it I didn't have any buttery crackers but I did have a half a bag of almost stale potato chips in the pantry so in they went.  It turned out great! The recipe is good as written but I can imagine doing a few little twists on it such as adding bacon and or mushrooms to it.

Excellent! I used Carr's whole wheat crackers which are thick and 15 crackers was too many for 1/2 recipe. This will be my go-to crookneck squash recipe and I'll try with zucchini as another reviewer suggested.

It was tasty, but thicker than I expected. Was very eggy, and I'd like it a little more soupy. Next time will add garlic and nutmeg, and maybe chicken broth.

I made a gluten free version by substituting the Ritz crackers with Panko bread crumbs. It was delicious! My entire family loved it! I also added about 4-5 minced cloves of garlic when I sautéed the squash and onion. Then I used a cast iron skillet andinstead of transferring it to a casserole dish, I just added everything to the skillet and put it in the oven. It turned out fantastic!! Less clean up too with using only the skillet.

My husband and I loved this.  The store was out of yellow squash so I used zucchini squash.  Also, I did not precook in skillet of water.  I just put raw squash and onions in oven.  It was excellent.

Great base for easy variations, and it uses two decent size garden squash, which is a huge plus in August :)  My substitutes were some savory herbs sprinkled in (pick ones you like!) and for health reasons, instead of using packaged crackers, I just made up my own gluten free baking mix, s&p, cayenne pepper, assorted seasonings and just used the mix like bread crumbs. I only used one pot (the Pampered Chef Dutch Oven RockCrok) because it can go on the stove top and in the oven.  Only one pan to clean... I loved that someone recommended this could be eaten for breakfast!

My husband is not a squash fan; but he raved about this. I threw in about a quarter cup of grated parmesan and a little garlic powder to win over his taste buds. Success!

I saw this and thought my Husband would love it (he's an egg lover) I was not wrong. we love this!!! I have modified it a little to our tastes I add more cheese and seasoning as it doesn't call for any. I also add more crackers. I also add zucchini along with the summer squash for added flavor. cant go wrong with the recipe its a keeper!

This recipe is a staple during the summer when the garden squash is ready to be eaten. When ever I make it for dinner/potlucks there's hardly any left. Since it's a small batch you can easily double/triple is and have enough for parties or get togethers. You can also sub in zucchini if you run out of squash and it's still delicious as well as cut the squash into smaller bits so they're more bite-size and you can use more.

This was great!  My daughter even liked it!  I didn't cook the squash so long; I didn't want it to be mushy.  And I added a little Parmesan cheese to the top.  It came out of the oven golden brown and delicious!  Great way to use our garden squash.

Fantastic!  I only added a bit of extra squash, crackers, and cheese to make it a little firmer.  Also, I followed the advice of another reviewer and cooked most of the squash tender as the recipe calls for, but, kept some of the squash raw until it went into the casserole dish.  This made for a nice mixture of texture and prevented mush from happening.  Be sure to cook to a light/med brown top.  This has to be one of my favorites so far.

Great recipe!  I added garlic when softening the onions and squash. 
I think I'm going to have to try adding bacon next, maybe some green chili or jalapenos.  The possibilities are endless.

WOW...this stuff is seriously good.  It's quick & simple to whip up & never disappoints.  I add a little extra squash & cook it for about 10 min on  medium heat & I don't bother to dot with the 2 tbsp of butter before baking (that's just a lot of butter that IMO isn't needed).  DELICIOUS!!

Absolutely fabulous! This is definitely on our weekly, or bi-weekly dinner menu!
Took a gorgeous picture of the casserole, but unfortunately will not upload here on all-recipes,
so up it went on Facebook instead. Beautiful! 
p.s. added 4 pieces cooked bacon to the ingredients list ... yummy!

I love squash and I love casseroles- This is a new favorite way to have squash! :) I did have to cook the squash much longer than the suggested 5-7 minutes until tender, and I occasionally uncovered and stirred them. I used a very low calorie almond milk and egg beaters egg whites instead of real eggs- for lower calories. To cook it (the oven was occupied) I used a toaster oven at the recommended preheated 400 degrees- It ended up being done much earlier around the 15 minute time. Everything was very good and approved by the three other people who enjoyed it as well!

Absolutely delicious as written. The only alteration I did was to melt the 2 TBS of butter and mix that with the topping instead of using dots atop the casserole. However, next time I will use reduced/fat free ingredients.

I kept to the recipe as it called.  However, the Ritz crackers I used were Garlic Butter flavored.  Very easy and very good.  A little different from the ones I've had in the past but, a nice change.  Will make again.

This is very similar to the recipe I've grown up loving.  My mother boiled the squash until it was semi tender, then drained it.  She cooked chopped onions with chopped bacon and used saltine crackers and melted Velveeta.   As I've experimented with it, I've essentially kept the recipe the same, but have mixed yellow and zucchini squash, and regular or the spicy version of Cheese whiz.  It's good hot and cold and when I fix it, I always end up eating WAY TOO MUCH ,,, but it SURE IS GOOD!!!!

five  stars and worth it !  because it's a new way to fix a veggie .. but more then that is the fact my family asked for seconds! It is very "mild" so it will not over take your main dish. The only change I did make is using cream and not milk.. I like richer flavors

I have never reviewed a recipe, but this is delicious!  We had it for dinner and breakfast leftovers.  I used yellow squash/zucchini for contrast but otherwise followed the recipe.  It was just so delicious, and the kids gobbled their vegetables.

Very tasty and very easy to make. Great for a low carb diet also! My kids loved this and my daughter said it tasted alot like stuffing. She was right and I thought this WOULD be a great substitute for stuffing. Will be serving this at Thankgiving from now on in lieu of cornbread stuffing.

Made it exactly as written.  Loved it.  Self, husband and six children all ate it happily and hardly anything left over.  The flavor and texture remind me of homemade macaroni and cheese.  I wasn't expecting that.

Excellent recipe. I used "Everything" flavored Ritz crackers and it helped season the dish. It reminds me of scalloped potatoes, only slightly healthier.

This was a good recipe with some changes from previous reviews.  I omitted the butter and decreased to 1 egg and 1/3 cup milk and did not miss it.  Added crumbled bacon and used 1/2 zucchini and 1/2 yellow squash as well as a Mexican blend cheese and a hint of garlic.  I did not have crackers so used a Panko bread crumb.  I will decrease the original cooking of the zucchini and squash so that it holds up a little better during baking.

I don't know, I didn't care it. I followed the directions and it came out a little mushy for me.. The top was fine but the inside was just to soggy. My husband didn't care for it either. I love yellow squash and was looking for different ways to prepare, but this wasn't a good one.

Whoever said the eggs ruined this recipe apparently did not bother to make it. I've been making a squash like this for years and it is perfect. The only thing I do differently is put a splash of red hot sauce in it to spice it up just a bit and I mash up the squash instead of leaving whole slices. In Texas we grow a lot of yellow crookneck squash so a good recipe like this is a must.

I loved this. Of course, I don't think I've ever made a recipe as it was written. First, I sauteed the onion and squash in a little olive oil until just barely soft. I also used sharp cheddar, added parmesan, added garlic powder, used Garlic Butter Ritz because that's what I had on hand, and mixed a little butter into the cracker mix I used to top the casserole instead of dotting it with butter. When I make this again I'll add another cup of squash, and instead of mixing the crackers and cheese and then dividing, I'll add 1/4 the crackers and 3/4 the cheese to the squash and use the rest to top it. Fantastic base recipe. Just takes a little cooking common sense to make this a winner.

Absolutely perfect! Made exactly as written. I will try adding bacon next time as recommended by another person. This is sooooo easy and good!
Update 5/24/14: added bacon, even better! Everyone loved it at our
Memorial day celebration at the lake!

I have yet to get a bad review from friends and family with this recipe! I add in more pepper because the milk, squash and egg do bland the flavor some. 

If it isn't working for you, try mixing things up a little. Add just egg whites, or use bran flakes or bread crumbs, add extra flavorings to pair for a new taste! Recipes are but a mere guideline to someone that cooks :)

Like many other reviewers I felt the need to add more squash... like 2 more cups, in fact.  Also more cheese, and onion, and crackers for that matter.  It certainly would NOT have filled a 9X13 if I hadn't.  I kicked up the seasoning a notch and added a few diced jalapenos from our garden.  I really like that you don't boil everything to death in this recipe, and the light saute takes so much less time than the boiling aspect.  Also, if you add the extra portions of those ingredients that I mentioned, the casserole needs to cook for about 40 minutes, not 25.

Delicious!  I put a little extra squash in because I had half a squash left when I got to 4 cups. I ended up with around 5 cups.

Made this with yellow squash fresh from the garden and it was delicious. I did add a couple of things. I cooked my onion with some chopped bacon. I also added a little chopped garlic to the pan while the squash was cooking.  Other than that, followed recipe exactly and it was one of the best I've had and that from a true Southern Gal!

This is a go to recipe for me with summer squash. I use corn flakes for crackers and add extra cheese. Great recipe ! I tried using garlic salt and it worked perfectly .

This was excellent and very easy.  I added some minced garlic to the mix, but that was the only change I made. I will definitely make this again and next time I might try it with zucchini.

UPDATE:  I wanted to come back and share how much my family likes this recipe.  It's super easy, quick, and packed with flavor.  My husband hates all things green, but likes this!  I make is throughout the summer, and have done so for several years.  THANK YOU for giving my family a lasting, healthy meal! 

I grilled the veggies first, then added some Mrs. Dash.  It was very good - I will make it again...Thanks!

Excellent recipe.  I made the recipe almost as written.  I sauted the onions first and as another suggested, I cut the squash thinly instead of boiling. Otherwise, I made it just like the recipe called for.  Didn't think it had to many eggs (like some suggested).  I found it a great combination of flavors.   I did bake mine at 350 for about 35 minutes.  It came out perfect.  Will keep and make this many times more.  Because it had the cheese, milk eggs, etc., I made a meal of it alone.  YUMMY!  Thank you for the recipe.

I didn't like how the crackers got mushy.  I've used pepperidge farm herb stuffing before in a similar recipe and it was great.

I added a total of 5 cups steamed (3 mins in a microwave) mixed sliced summer and zucchini, one small vidalia onion & used lowfat milk, 2% cheese, 1/4 cup melted lowfat butter and 2 tbs fat free french onion dip.  I also used about 1/4 teaspoon of freeze-dried basil, finely crushed and garlic pepper instead of black pepper.  Yum!

I made these for Mother's Day dinner for 7 people.  Well liked by most of the adults-I didn't care for it.  2 kids did not like it and will eat grilled/sautéed squash.  I cut the squash into chunks and sautéed it for a few minutes with heaping spoonful of garlic then followed recipe.  It was still bland for me; mushy on the bottom and perfect on top.  I don't think that I will make this again unless requested. 3 stars because 4/7 liked it.

Yummy! I added oregano and garlic as others suggested and this was delicious.  I also broiled it at the end for a couple of minutes so the top got a little brown and crunchy.  I will def make this again.

Very good recipe.    However I did change a couple of things.  I did not add water to the onion and squash while it was cooking, I did however add 2 garlic cloves, minced.   Used 1 egg instead of 2.    Used sour cream in place of the milk.  Added 2 grated carrots to the cracker crumbs and cheese.  Used half extra sharpe cheddar and half Irish white cheddar cheese.  Baked at 325 degrees for 30 minutes.

This was a "second choice" recipe as I was missing an ingredient for what I intended to make. Loved it! Perfect side dish and easy to make. Did not substitute any ingredients and it turned out wonderful and looked nice too. I did use an 8"x8" baking dish though and thought it worked great. I would recommend that instead of the 9x13". Also, I drained the squash and onion and added right to the baking dish, mixed in the cracker mixture & then poured egg mixture & butter over top. (saved a step and dirty dishes) Covered with remaining crumb mixture and bits of butter. Easy!! SO good!!

I've made this recipe on numerous occasions and it has been well received by all who have eaten it, including my children. I cook my squash until tender but not mushy. I also add a touch of garlic powder and extra cheddar cheese. We use sharp cheddar for extra taste.

I have just recently gotten into yellow squash so I have been trying a few different recipes. I really loved this casserole. I used Garlic Butter Ritz and threw in a few fresh thyme leaves which were good but I'd say use very sparingly.  Next time I will cut back on the butter and salt, definitely not add butter on top, this is why I only gave it 4 stars. I omitted the onions and sauteed the squash in butter for 4 minutes prior to mixing everything together.  I followed a previous reviewer and baked for 15 mins before adding the cracker/cheese mix on top.  I can't wait to make this again for my family!

I love this recipe so much i'me made it many times and refined it every time. First the 5 min. cooking time for the squash and onions is off.  I'll cooked the onions for 5 min. before adding the squash.  Cook an add'l 10 min.  Let cool, then drain.  Grate med. cheddar cheese.  Crush  crackers in sleeve.  Mix w/cheese.  Separate eggs.  Beat egg yolks w/2% milk.  Melt 1/4 cup butter.  Whip egg whites.  Add melted butter to egg/milk mixture.  Use enmersion blender to semi-blend squash/onion/egg yolk/milk mixture.  Fold in 1/2 cracker/cheese mix w/squash mixture.  Fold in whipped egg whites.  Add a couple of pinches Kosher salt and fresh ground black pepper to remaining cracker/cheese mixture.  Melt remaining 2 Tbsp. of butter and add to remaining cracker/cheese mix.  Fold.  Add on top.  Cook covered for 25 min.  Uncover, cook add'l 5 min.  Voila!

I made this on Thanksgiving as a side dish since for any vegetarian eaters.  I followed the recipe with no adjustments.  Delicious!!   Best served warm, and leftovers are yummy too.  (Not so great cold, be sure to warm it before eating leftovers!)  I will be adding this to my menu again.

Finally got my daughters to eat squash without them complaining!  I tried to make it a little more healthy so I could also enjoy it without too much guilt.  Used less butter, egg substitute in place of eggs, less cheese & used spray butter on top instead of dotting butter on the top.  Also added garlic powder & Ruscan Tuscan seasoning from Costco.

Great recipe! 
I did tweak it a bit though, for personal taste and based on what I had on hand. I used 2 yellow squash and 1 cucumber. I didn't have buttery crackers so I used good ol' saltines. Per a previous suggestion, I added some already cooked bacon into the squash while cooking. I also added 1 clove of garlic diced and some red onion chopped. In the egg mix I used a little less milk and added a dollup of sour cream. The end result was wonderful and the kids loved it! Thanks for a great recipe!

The best I have ever made, hands down. Didn't change a thing. Squash was not soggy, crackers were crunchy, flavors perfect with just salt and pepper as written.

I'd give this 10 starts if I could.  Made it exactly as written.  I really don't like squash, but someone gave me one and I thought it was a shame to waste it.  After trying this recipe I will BUY the squash to make it.  Just delicious.  Thanks for great recipe!

I made this today in an effort to use up some of our abundant squash, and while I found it tasty, it isn't memorable.  I followed the recipe as is, and it's good enough.  I would make it again, but maybe add green chiles or bacon or sausage to it.  
The texture is good, and the basic ingredients are good, it just lacks a punch of flavor that makes you want to make it for guests or take to a picnic.

This is a great side dish, delicious. And...during the summer there is always a surplus of squash from the garden. The recipe doesn't really require anything that you wouldn't have on hand, and is easy to make.

I didn't have crackers so I used butter pretzels and bread crumbs.  It made a slightly crunchy crust, which my husband and I both loved.

Excellent casserole!  I sauteed the squash and onions in the 1/4 cup butter instead of addiing it later.  Followed the rest of the recipe and amounts as written.  This will stay on my recipe list!

Love this recipe! Have been looking for a squash casserole without a cream of something in it that still tastes good and this is it! Perfect as is, love it with some garlic powder. Thanks for sharing rosecart :)

Great recipe! However, you can eliminate sogginess in the squash if you don't sautee in water, but instead use some olive oil.  I also added garlic and salt and pepper while sauteeing.  You can make this gluten-free by adding crushed Glutino gluten-free crackers and mixing it with butter.  My family LOVED it.

As a guy, and a survivalist, this is something I can really appreciate. Everything that goes into this recipe is something I can and do grow. Personally I modified this after reading the comments, adding a bit of my own additions. And with that said, this is the perfect recipe for a base formula. From here, you can experiment any way you like. Adding more cheese, different types of crackers, etc. I am looking forward to trying my latest version, however I give 5 stars for the basic medium of which we expand. Experiment by diving into the butter nut squash realm of recipes, or stick to southern traditional varients by using meats. Either way, this recipe is an excellent starting point. One thing I want to stress however is that these summer squashes are NEVER skinned. Cut them thin, precook them to your liking (mine being southern is sauteed with butter and onions) and make this your own.

Absolutely delicious! Here are the changes I made: I didn't have any onion, so I just used onion powder. I used a blend of italian cheeses and seasoned bread crumbs in place of cheddar and crackers. I used Jane's Crazy salt in place of salt & pepper. Everyone loved it!

A very good casserole--made just as the recipe said, except that I increased the cracker mix by about 1 1/2 times.  Think that made it a little better, though higher in calories.  Would be nice to do it that way for company, but just for daily cooking might not need to do that.  Anyway, a really good side dish.

I don't know what I did wrong, because everyone else seems to have liked this, but I thought it was kind of unappetizing.  I made the recipe exactly as posted except for substituting zucchini for half of the yellow squash.  Anyway, it was super bland, watery, and I felt like it never really solidifed into a casserole.  Maybe I cooked the squash and zucchini too long?  Or didn't drain it enough?  Either way, I would recommend using about twice the cheese, and make sure it's a medium or sharp cheddar rather than mild.  We couldn't even taste the cheese in ours.  Maybe try some of the other reviewers' suggestions about using only 1 egg?  I really don't know.  I will not be using this recipe again.

I followed the recipe exactly, and DH loved this.  Rewarded me with a big kiss after dinner.  I like squash, and I like the fact that this casserole does not use canned soup.  However, I think I will try to make it with one egg next time.  I don't make many vegetable casseroles any more, due to the extra calories and fat.  This had a good squash flavor, but it was a tad heavy for me.

I think we are in the minority in saying this wasn't one of our favorite ways to eat squash. My family thought it seemed a little greasy and bland for our taste.   It seemed like most people really seemed to enjoy it though, so, I would give it a try and you may like it.

This was a great recipe! I altered it just a bit by added more cheese to suit my cheesy taste but even without this change this casserole is awesome.  If you ever want an alternative to mac n cheese, the squash casserole is a winner!

This past summer, my family had way too many yellow squash from our garden so I searched all recipies for a good recipe and found this one. It was a huge hit and we had no problems using up all the squash. Can't wait till next summer because I have been wanting more and squash is not in season right now. Casserloe had a nice light flavor, you could still taste the squash and its relatively healthy.

This was absolutely delicious! This summer when I had lots of squash, I made two of these, one for dinner and one for the freezer (that one I only partially baked). Last night I took it out of the freezer and put it straight in the oven and it was FABULOUS!

So much lighter than the heavy, creamy squash casseroles I've made in the past, but with just as much flavor.  I used buttery garlic crackers because that's what was in the pantry.  This is a keeper!

I don't know what was wrong but this came out way to dry and just not good at all. Think this would have been better mixing it into a corn bread casserole instead of crackers.

I tried this because I was hoping to find an easier version of my mother's fried zucchini.   This was FABULOUS.  I used soda crackers--because that is what she used--and zucchini.  I could have eaten the whole pan.

This recipe is great, but I add about 1/4 cup of mayo and 2 teaspoons of sugar (at my sisters recommendation). It's perfect for any occasion!

I loved this and actually went back for about 3 helpings.  I will definitely make this again.  The only substitution I made was that I used whole wheat bread crumbs instead of crackers as I was out of the crackers.

If you enjoy yellow squash, onions and breading, you won't be disappointed.

It was okay, but not great.  Squash isn't my favorite food, but I thought since it got many high rating and had cheese in it I would maybe like it, but I didn't.

Modified this to what was on hand,croutons and stove top stuffing dry crumbs,added garlic to onions,four cheese Mexican cheese,layered Canadian bacon down before the crumb top and even those that were skeptical of squash ate it all up. Made about 24 servings without leftovers so am thinking folks enjoyed!

This was the first time I made anything with squash in this manner.  It was soo good :) Of course I didn't really measure anything as listed and it came out so yummy I ate half of it right out of the oven.  I will be making this a lot more now.  A must try.....

Really good!! We had 2 adults and 8 teenagers over tonight for a birthday dinner (I almost doubled the recipe). Two of the teenagers had never had any type of squash before...and, can I just say... everyone tried this and EVERY plate was clean; most went back for seconds; and nearly all of this dish was gone!!! Didn't change anything and I WILL be making this again. YUMMY!!!!

I made this with yellow squash from our CSA.  I added about 15 more crackers and more cheese and milk. Less healthy but both kids age 2.5 and 6 loved this dish.  Husband did also.

I have made this twice now and have cut the cheese down by 1/2 C. Lots of compliments and it was eaten very quickly. I'm making again for a potluck picnic at our church again tomorrow and I've been asked to bring 2. Thanks for the recipe! Enjoy

This is amazingly GOOD :) The only changes I made was I sauteed 1 onion and a few cloves of garlic in a lil olive oil when that was tender I added the squash {I used yellow pear squash it is really good and does not tend to get as mushy as others} cooked til tender.Instead of boiling..Then I added melted 2 tble butter mixed in the topping instead of dabbing it on .This was PERFECT!! TYVM

Simple, and great when squash is cheap or you have an abundance in the garden. My mom taught me to make squash casserole many, many years ago and this recipe is very close to hers. I usually use less butter and just eyeball the amount of crackers and cheese.

This is good, but doesn't taste as good as my Mom's and I think it's because she uses skim milk, garlic, zucchini, egg whites, light cheese, and not as much butter. I will do the same next time-  when i got it out of the oven, all the greasy parts were bubbling...which is good if that's what you're going for!  Simple base recipe that is easy to customize. I added some bell pepper and it was pretty good. Not really thinking about, added some rosemary.  Not sure if i'll do that next time.

This was delicious but I did make a few changes. Some ideas (which granted are less low fat) were to add some sour cream (1/2 cup) and cream cheese( 2 tbsp?) to the egg and milk mixture. Also, I added celery sauteed in chili powder to the crunchy breadcrumb topping. It was delicious and 3 of us finished the entire 9" x 13" pan in one sitting!

I've made this many times, it makes a great side dish!  The only thing I changed was adding corn.  You can pour frozen corn in the pan when you're heating the squash.  Very good!

This is the BEST squash casserole I've ever had. I did add some sauteed chopped bacon (just a slice) in with this dish... Nothing like bacon/cheddar cheese combo to kick it up a notch!!!!   Also, it was so good, I ate it for breakfast!!!

I've made this recipe for years as is with nothing but raves.  I generally add more seasons to things, but I really prefer this casserole as is, with simple onion flavor.  This year however, I ran out of milk and used heavy cream instead. OMG.  It was even better.  Not worth the calories to do that all the time, but it made for an extremely fluffy and creamy casserole!

My boyfriend really enjoyed this but it wasn't my favorite. It was pretty bland; next time I might mix other veggies in and definitely load up on garlic.

I have never been more surprised and pleased with a recipe.  If someone would have mentioned this to me I would have said no thanks.  I'm not a big fan of yellow squash or zucchini.  I only tried it because someone else made it.  It's now one of my favorite side dishes.

This was fantastic! Excellent side dish to go with a full flavoured main dish! Followed your directions to the T and I just gave it an extra sprinkle of Salt when I pulled the baking dish out of the oven. Will definately make this again! (It fit in my 9x9 bakeware) Thank you so much for sharing this recipe. :)

Wow! I made the recipe as written (I was going to add some nutmeg and garlic as some reviewers suggested, but forgot to), and I and my very picky five-year-old son were literally shoveling it into our mouths. He even had seconds, which is rare for anything other than ice cream. Awesome recipe!

I was looking forward to making this but it didn't turn out as flavorful as I hoped.  The onions took away from the flavor and the cheese didn't melt properly.

Oh, my gosh..This casserole is really good.  Even my husband liked it, and he is a "meat and potatoes" kind of guy.  I did add the 15 extra crackers, the extra cheese, and a little bacon grease.. If you make this casserole, you can expect to get a lot of compliments.:)

I made this recipe nearly to directions and it was tasty, I was asked to make it again and my picky husband didn't ask for modifications like he usually does.   The one thing I did do different was I used a pepper-orange seasoning instead of regular pepper.  Yummy recipe!!!

Great recipe; here's what i did-- didn't have onion, so i added peeled carrot to the mix. also added sour cream to the cracker mix and subbed pepper jack for the cheddar. for the squash (and zucchini, plus a spicy pepper i diced up and threw in for good measure) i tossed them with salt, pepper, cumin, cayenne, garlic and onion powder and a light coating of vegetable oil. then i quickly seared them in a smoking hot wok so that they were still crunchy. i added half the cracker/sour cream mix to it, plus the zest of one lime--would have used fresh cilantro if i had it--then i added the 2 eggs to the rest of the cracker mix, spread that on top and broiled it until it was toasted on the top.  but what i felt that it really needed was some fresh lump crab meat in the squash mix, unfortunately, there was none in the house.

This was okay, I added more cheese than recipe called for and I think it was a bit much, so really it is my fault. Next time I will stick to amount of cheese stated in recipe.

I'm giving this 5 stars although I did a lot of improvising with this recipe.  I pretty much used the recipe as a guideline and made things up as I went, but I enjoyed it very much.  It's definitely my favorite way to eat squash.

i have a ton of squash from my moms garden, so ive been trying to find new ways to prepare it. this is DEFINETLY a keeper! i made it almost exactly as directed except i did not precook the squash, i just sliced  it and added the rest of the ingredients as directed. i also added some garlic pepper and steak seasoning to the eggs before i mixed it around. i sprayed a bit of pam on top before i cooked it. and baked it for about 30 min in an 11x7 dish. the veggies were cooked perfect.. not super mushy .. and it was DELISH!! thanks for sharing!!

Delish! I used squash from my own garden which made it so nice to find a way to use them in a different way.  This casserole is creamy and cheesy and I love it.  Will definitely make this again!!!!

Quite good. Other than reducing the amt of butter in half and seasoning the veggies as they cooked vs. afterwards, I followed the recipe. I'd make this again.

Very good! I will use even more squash next time and instead of buttery crackers used a healthier multigrain kind that tasted delicious. I also added some garlic paste to the cracker mix.

This was delicious.  I made a few changes, I used cream instead of milk, and added about a cup of sour cream as well.  I substituted swiss cheese for cheddar, because I did not have any cheddar.  I left off the crackers (less carbs).

Excellent dish!  The kids even came back for 2nds.  I left off the last 2 Tbsp of butter on the top and it still browned fine.  Next time I might even add a little more squash.

Great!  Made a few changes, added potatoes to make up for the amount of yellow squash I didn't have, and used only one egg and 1/3 cup of milk.  It was delicious!

A gluten free friend.  Use GF bread crumbled. Use egg whites. Use Soy milk. Substitute/or add other fresh veggies.  Sub in Parmesan cheese (lots)  Fresh and bottled.  Use (half butter/half olive oil)  Very tasty!

I used half of the cheese and should *not* have added any water or milk since the squash released so much liquid during heating any way.  This tasted so good.

I LOVED this. I tried 2 ways. One with others' suggestions of adding garlic and decreasing the stovetop cooking time and increasing the amount of cheese and Ritz. The other way was just like the recipe calls for but I did decrease the amount of time I cooked the squash stovetop.  I LOVE garlic and thought I'd prefer that one but surprisingly I preferred it the way it was intended EXCEPT that both were a bit too buttery. I don't like butter leaching out of things because there's too much.  I will make it again and follow this recipe but not cook the squash as long as it states (I don't like it too soft) and decrease the amount of butter inside the mix and maybe not drizzle as much on top either. The flavor of the squash really comes through when you don't add more stuff.

This was FABULOUS!  I thought it might be bland, but I had yellow squash to use up, so I gave it a try.  My family of picky eaters had seconds and thirds!  It was great even cold the next morning for breakfast - LOL!  I used whole grain Ritz crackers.  Next time, I might make it with zuchini just to give it some color.  AWESOME casserole!

This was a great recipe! I added some cooked red lentils for extra protein and it turned out delicious! I also used sharp cheddar and a little less crackers than what the recipe suggested. This is definitely a keeper.

Excellent!  This was so easy to make and was perfect on a cold night.  I used it as a side dish and scaled it down to 4 servings.  Everyone loved it, even my picky Father!! As a side note, I used the "Easy Garlic Chicken" recipe by K Grecco as the main dish and they went together nicely.  I will make this over and over again!  A+++

My husband says he doesn't like squash and he really liked this (I loved it!).  I scaled it in 1/2, sort of, using almost the full amount of cheese and made it in an 8x8 pan.  I used 2 large yellow squash and 2 zucchini and steamed them just slightly. I sauteed the onion in the butter (we don't like raw onion) then combined those in a bowl and seasoned with salt, pepper and a little cajun seasoning. I followed the rest of the recipe but skipped the added butter on top and added more seasonings to the crackers.  DELISH!

Pretty tasty!  I didn't have the onion and cooked it in a pan a little larger than the one recommended, so it came out thin, but it was fine when stacked together on a plate.

I doubled the amount of squash and added two slices of cooked and crumbles bacon. I added all the cheese and the crackers to the squash mixture. I omitted the butter simply because I forgot to add it. It was like a souffle and was the best squash recipe I have ever tasted. Everyone that I have made this dish for has raved about it and asked for the recipe.

This was just okay. My changes: I doubled the onion, added some minced garlic, subbed zucchini for the yellow squash, and didn't pre-saute any of the items. I also omitted the two additional table spoons of butter, because 1/4 cup is enough to be pouring all over innocent vegetables. Nothing terrible, nothing great...just okay. At least I used up some of my zucchini!

I was very disappointed by this recipe. I'm only giving it 3 stars because it looked so pretty coming out of the oven! I was expecting something cheesey and crunchy and buttery, instead I got layers of squash surrounded by an eggy, crackery mixture. The two components didn't seem to blend very well. Don't get me wrong, it was quite edible, just not what I was looking for. I won't make it again. (Very pretty though!)

Beware. . . this dish is extremely addictive. What makes this so amazing is that it tastes JUST LIKE macaroni and cheese. . . but so much healthier. To turn it from a size dish into the main event, simply add chicken pieces before popping it in the oven. . . so delicious. We also use zucchini instead of, or in addition to, the yellow squash. My boyfriend and I eat the whole 9X11 pan with alarming speed.

I'm giving it 5 stars because it is a very good base recipe to which I added 1/2 of a chopped bell pepper(sauteed with the onions), 1 minced garlic clove, 1/4 tsp. red pepper flakes and a sprinkle of basil, thyme & parsley. Yellow squash is bland & can use any help you give it. We really enjoyed it & will cook it again.

This was great. I used my food processor to make prep quick: grated the cheese, chopped the crackers (be careful not to pulverize), sliced the squash & onion, mixed the egg & seasoning. Also, to cut down on dirty dishes, I put the squash, onion & butter in a covered casserole in the microwave for 10 min, then added the other ingredients. I added seasoned salt and a tsp of hot sauce. It wasn't spicy, just a hint of pepper flavor. Yum.

I have made this twice this summer with yellow squash from the garden.  It is very good.  I like using the crackers because some casseroles use too much bread or stuffing mix.  I like all the cheese and that makes this easier to get the family to eat it too.

i tried making this for just me.  As a note, for a serving of 1, you'll need 1 tablespoon of squash!  Fortunately I had one tiny squash.  Prepare it in a creme brulee cup with 1 ritz cracker and you'll be delighted!

This was excellent made despite a lot of dishes..they all clean up with a quick rinse.  Perhaps some garlic next time.  It got done before my entree so I just turned off the oven and left it in there and it got a nice golden crust on top--YUM!  4 cups of squash was four medium squash--to my suprise.  I don't think there is any way that this would feed 10--three of us devoured over half of it.

I don't like squash much but was looking for a recipe since my CSA sent us a bunch of squash and zucchini and I didn't want it to go to waste. The only things I did different was I used multigrain saltines instead of buttery crackers (which is probably why I didn't think it was too buttery like some other reviewers) and I forgot to add salt and pepper. I don't tihnk the salt and pepper was needed... it was perfect. The squash wasn't too mushy, which is what I usually dislike about squash casseroles, and the egg and milk combo fluffed up beautifully along with the crackers and cheese to make a almost "light" feeling casserole. It even reheated ok the next day!

We were looking for something different to do with all the squash and zucchini from our garden besides frying. This was wonderful! We added a dash of cajun seasoning as well. I kept going back for "just one more spoonful". This is definitely a keeper!

I made this for a family get together with my first pickings out of my garden. it was a huge success. The only thing different I did was I diced the squash instead of slicing. It was absolutely delish! And easy too!

This casserole is delicious!  Like a couple of other reviewers, I added some garlic and Tony's while I was cooking the squash.  That really added flavor.  I did not add the water and I was glad that I did not, it may have been too runny.  The consistency was perfect and the flavor was wonderful!  Will make again and again!

This is my go-to dish for all get togethers (everyone raves.)  The only thing I add is McCormick's Veggie Magic seasoning, it reall makes a diff.  When cooking at home, instead of crackers I use crushed All Bran cereal (healthier) and add a bit of cajun seasoning to the squash (like Cachere's.)

Delish! I did alter it to our tastes. I used onion powder in place of the onion since my husband doesn't have allergic reactions to that. I added some red pepper flakes for some heat and some garlic powder. I also added a Tbsp of wheat germ to the top of the casserole after i put the topping on, and instead of butter I sprayed the top with pam. We ate as a main dish and it was delicious! I added a dollop of sour cream to the top and thought it was perfect!

Very Good! I made this with a package of saltines - as I did not have the crackers. I used green zucchini instead of yellow. I left out the butter - It didn't need the extra fat. I added some Italian seasoning and McCormick Montreal Steak Seasoning to it. Very good!

This was excellent. I brought it to my family's Thanksgiving and everyone loved it. I did saute the squash with the onions & some garlic in butter instead of boiling it. I also used zucchini and yellow squash for nice color. Besides that, I followed the recipe. Really, it was delish!!!

This was wonderful. This is my first time trying to cook squash and this will now be my only recipe used for when I do it in the future. My husband loved this and said that it tasted better than he can remember from his families cooking.

I would not consider this a casserole but a gratin, as it turned out a lot drier than a casserole. I think if I had eaten the first mouthful blind folded I would have guessed that this was macaroni and cheese instead of squash casserole. To be fair I did take a couple shortcuts which could have contributed to a drier texture; instead of boiling squash in water I used less water and sort of steamed it, so it was still somewhat firm but cooked through as I was afraid it would be too soggy. I only had one egg so to compensate I added a little extra milk. Also, I added some extra cheese. Even so, this was a pretty dry casserole. 

I really liked this but I think I was expecting something with more white sauce like my mother used to make. However, my husband, who usually hates squash, liked this dish because it is less heavy than a regular casserole and said he'd eat it again. So, I am only giving 4 stars because the name is a bit misleading, though I think the tatse for what it is a 5-star dish!

Really really good. I noticed that some reviewers complained that this was recipe too bland. I used sharp cheddar cheese, and I really think that made all the difference! Instead of using water to pre cook the squash and onions, I sauteed them in a little bit of butter. I also added a little extra crackers and cheese topping for some extra crunch. Yum! I might add some garlic next time, but this was very good as is.

Personally, I didn't like this recipe a lot. It was OK but it ended up tasting more like squash au gratin (which I don't care for) than a squash casserole I was expecting. Overall, it was an OK recipe but not one I'd make again.

This is GREAT!  I made it for a family reunion picnic last weekend and the whole thing was gone in no time.  I made it with no changes to the recipe and my husband and I think it was perfect.  I'll definitely make this tasty, EASY, recipe again and again.

I used half and half instead of milk.  If squash is big, peel and scoop out seeds.  This recipe rocks.

This was my first attempt at squash casserole, and I thought it was great.  I just wanted to pass along my experience with cooking overgrown squash (it was about a foot long and about 4-5 inches wide...was hidden in the garden for a while...)--the rind gets very hard and the seeds get very large and hard too (like pumpkin seeds), so just be sure to peel it and scoop out the seeds before you make it (or any other recipe).  Otherwise, you're left with tough rind and seeds in your dish.  Not good!!

This is a WONDERFUL recipe. I love the cheesy onion flavors. I varied the thickness of the slices and chunks of squash to vary the bite feel. Look at it as a squash au gratin and serve it as a warm side to ham or roast chicken or turkey. Depending on what you're serving  with it, you may need to add garlic, peppers or meat. My pickiest kid loved this. I will try and make a pan, freeze, then reheat to see how it fares. Thanks for sharing!!

This is so good.I took it to a covered dish picnic and I only got a small bite thinking I would come back for another bite if I liked it. When I went back the bowl was scraped clean not even a crumb left.LOL  Now I can't wait to fix for my family.

Wow.  If I followed directions exactly it would have made too much (and been way too buttery for a weeknight side dish!)  This was really tasty, with my changes:
I used 3 yellow squashes that I washed, patted dry & sliced thin.  I sauteed them with 1/2 a small yellow onion in 1 pat of butter and a few shakes of good store bought chicken stock.  I was buttery cracker-less, so I used a few handfulls of Pepperidge Farm dry stuffing mix.  Also out of yellow shredded cheddar (what I think the poster had in mind) so I shredded Cabot Jalapeno cheddar and a bit of extra sharp NY Cheddar, only melted 1 pat of butter (with all the cheese you don't need the extra grease) and you really don't need salt, just cracked black pepper.  I did dot the top with butter (if you don't the bread crumbs or whatever will just be dry and nasty) but since I scaled the recipe down to 4, it worked fine with maybe a TOTAL 4 T butter for the entire recipe.
The spicy cheese gave this kick-otherwise I think Guido would have turned his big nose up to it.

When my grandfather passed away, a group of ladies from the church brought dinner over to our home (I was a teenager living at home then).  One of the dishes was Squash Casserole.  I absolutely loved it and tried several recipes to make it.  I finally found this one and WOW! it is just what I was looking for.  This one is awesome - a perfect comfort food.

This was very good, the only reason I gave it 4 stars is because my mom makes one that is much better, with AMERICAN cheese, cream of chicken soup, and green chilis. After having hers I can only give this one 4 stars haha but still it was very good.

This was very tasty and easy to make - a good use of excess summer squash!  I added 1 pound of Italian turkey sausage - sliced and sauteed with the squash and onions to make a main meal.

Fantastic recipe. I've made this several times over the past year and it always gets raves. Didn't change a thing. 
Update:  just came across this in my recipes and have to update. I've been making this for the holidays for almost 10 years. Everyone loves it and expects me to bring it to all family gatherings. Only change is this I add a southern twist by cooking the squash and onions in a pan with a few slices of bacon and a few sprinkles of sugar for about 20 mins or so. Remove the bacon before baking. Amazing dish.

I really enjoyed this recipe.  It wasn't quite the one I was looking for but I will definitely use it again.  The only problem I found was that when you mix the hot squash and onion with the egg mixture the egg gets cooked.  Probably would be better to leave out one egg or let the mixture cool before mixing with the egg.

I was hoping to really love this, as I do love yellow squash and had quite a bit in my garden.  Unfortunately, this was just "ok" for us.  A little bland maybe?

I made exactly as written, was soooo yummy.  To me this was more like a squash quiche (say that 5 times fast :) rather than a casserole, but I still loved it, even had some left overs for breakfast this morning!!!

Wow - this was fabulous.   We have one squash plant and the thing is producing like crazy. I was looking for a baked squash recipe and I found this one.  I really followed the recipe this time and we both loved it.

This was very good. I didn't have crackers so I used dry bread crumbs mixed with the cheese. Next time I'll try one egg instead of two to cut down on the egginess.

i have squash and zucchini coming out of my ears from my garden so i've been trying a few different recipes. this one was really good! i used half squash and half zucchini and diced them up. i also used club crackers instead of butter and a little sugar. i would definitely add more salt next time though!

Very tasty.  A good use of the garden's bounty.  I did not have enough buttery crackers, so I used some cheese crackers to equal the amount needed and it was delicious.

Already our garden is overwhelmed with squash and we were tired of our old soupy casserole.  this is a great change of pace...and yummy too!  I halved the recipe for just the 2 of us and didn't have any Ritz crackers so I crushed some Club crackers and Cheezits.  Had to be even better than the others...more cheesy taste!  Really good....will have to make this one again and again....soooo much squash!!!

I don't know, I just wasn't a huge fan. My husband liked it a little more than me.  I think I should have tried to crush the crackers into finer pieces.  Otherwise it's just chunks of cracker on squash and it doesn't taste very good.

I was so glad to find this recipe again. Many years ago, I had clipped a squash casserole recipe from Southern Living that was always one of my favorites. Somehow, over the years, I had lost it. That wonderful recipe was almost idnetical to this one. I fixed it again tonight and boy was it good. :o)

This is the BEST squash recipe I have seen, ever!! So good that I froze the squash from my summer garden in premeasured packages especially for this recipe. Everytime there's a pot luck and I bring this dish, I get demands for this recipe. You'd think nobody's ever eaten squash before. Well, I think they have, but not this good! Thanks for this delicious recipe!

My family loved this recipie.  My hubby has already asked me to make it again.  I made the original recipe as written.  It was a little bland for my taste so I think I'll add a bit of spice as suggested by other reviews.  It is a great way to use squash.  TRY IT - you won't be sorry.

We really liked this recipe. I didn't have any round buttery crackers, so i used saltines. I just mixed everything together, & put into a 9x13 baking dish. Not adding the extra butter on top, instead i put a light coating of seasoned bread crumbs. We will be using this recipe again. Thanks!

This was very good!  I took the advice of some others and used 1/2 cup milk and 1/4 cup sour cream.  I also used club crackers instead of Ritz and did not add the butter on the top.  It turned out wonderful and my picky husband even had seconds!

Very tasty! Anything made with yellow squash that tastes good deserves five stars.  Will make again, thank you.

Amazing. I DID NOT use the butter and let me tell you, it did not need it, it was delicious.  Yellow squash has a "buttery" flavor to it as is.  Delish!

I wasnt quite sure what to expect when making this recipe, but it turned out wonderful! It was a delicious casserole, while not being too heavy. I used whole wheat crackers instead of Ritz and is was still good. I followed the recipe exactly, except I scaled it for four. Will make again!

Great way to use that extra garden squash.  I made the recipe as written, but added the extra 10 crackers.  This was great.  A true keeper.

I love it!  I take this casserole everywhere I need a vegetable dish.  :)  I also make it in a slightly smaller baking dish so that it is a deeper casserole - same baking time.

Oh this is good, I could eat this stuff for breakfast.  It did not turn out runny like I was afraid it might, it set perfectly. I used sweet yellow onions.  No more fried squash for this family, this is the only way to have squash.  And OH so easy!! Thanks for sharing.

Okay...this was absolutely AWESOME....I will definitely be making this more often.  Very easy.  I used more squash than the recipe called for and it was still delicious.  My father was saying how he could make a meal out of this...I agree with him. We all jumped up at the same time for another helping...then it was gone...don't snooze when it comes to seconds...you will lose.  Thank you Rosalie!

This recipe was delicious.  I skipped the extra butter on top.  If you experienced the "custard" texture, you may have cooked the squash too long.  Will make again.  Thanks!!

Yummy....made this over the weekend for dinner.  Very, very good.  I had been looking for a different way to make squash, since I had an excess of it.  The Ritz crackers made it.  I used garlic and butter flavor because that's what we had, and it was delicious!  Will make again!

I love this recipe. I used zuchini instead of the squash and saltines instead of the round crackers because that is what I had on hand. I steam the zuchini in the microwave before baking. Yummy its soooooo good!

Overated! The actual casserole was yummy (I added garlic & a touch cajun spice as another reviewer suggested) but I just wasn't in to the crackers on top - too dry. I would make again, but just use a cheese topping.

This was a good 'middle of the road' recipe for me.  It was fairly simple to make and no one complained about it.  But, it wasn't as creamy as I had hoped for and it did not reheat well.  Wasn't a bad recipe, but I will keep looking for a recipe that is more my taste.  Thanks.

I'd rate this higher if I could. I first had it at a bikers' party and couldn't get enough of it! One might try putting a coating of cheese over the top before baking, using a little less in the mixture. There won't be any leftovers. Plaudits to the chef!

Very Tasty!  My picky fiance whom "hates" squash, loved this. I used onion flavored butter crackers. At the suggestion of other reviewers, I used half zucchini and I added a little garlic .  Will make again.

Took this to a church luncheon yesterday and there was not a bit left.  It is absolutely delicious.  Made no changes in the ingredients or proportions.  I used the customize feature to make 15 servings.  Thanks for the great recipe, Rosalie!

Pretty good!  In fact it was great.  Nice buttery flavor.  Used Ritz crackers and they added to the rich flavor. Did not add the 1/4 cup of butter to save a few calories. We live in the mountains, so at higher altitude (4500 ft) had to add 15 min. to baking time.  Delicious!!

I made this as a side dish and it looked so yummy.
Nicely browned, and had a great texture.
My husband and I are not much for yellow summer squash but my Sister and Dad had both given me some from their garden. We both did not like it -way to sweet - maybe because I used sweet onions - Not sure

YUM!!!  I didn't have yellow squash so I used zukes instead.  But I was SO impressed with this recipe, I have been making it at least once a week! It is a wonderful, hearty dish that never fails to please. Thank you so much for this recipe!

This tasted great, the only problem was that it was only an inch deep in a 9x13 dish.  Next time I will either use a smaller dish or double the recipe.

This is so good, everyone loved it. I did make a few changes since I cannot eat onions they were omitted and I used swiss cheese. I did not have buttery crackers on hand so I used Ritz. Everyone I have made this for is asking for the recipe!!

It was too buttery and fatty, I would definitely take out the butter in the future and possibly try water instead of milk.

This was a hit at my dinner party last night!  Everyone loved it.  My husband thought it was especially great.  My mother thought it was one of the best parts of the meal.  I thought it was too eggy.  I guess I'm the odd one out.  The cheesy crunchy topping was really good.

It was good.  If I make it again I think I will use less cheese.  I'll probably mix the cheese into the casserole but not top it off with the other 4 oz.  Also, it needs a little spicing up IMO.  A dash of hot sauce made it even better.

I don't know how this gets so many 5 star reviews. I will not make it again. Too many crackers & WAY too much butter. It tasted good, although a little dry considering the amount of butter used. Not good enough to justify 4 bowls, a skillet & a casserole dish to wash just to end up with one side dish. Glad everyone else liked it but we won't make it again.

This was my first time making the dish and I definitely will be making it again. My fiance and I love it so much. We enjoy eating vegetables so trying this was up our alley. I used frozen squash  making the casserole and it was good. The recipe doesn't need any changes.

Delicious. I used zucchini and yellow squash and to keep it lower carb I used Parmesan crips instead of regular crackers. 
Everyone took seconds including my adult son who says he “is sick of zucchini “. 
This will be permanent addition to my repertoire.

This is a great recipe! Made it several times. One tip i would give is to make sure you drain well. If done correctly  the dish comes out perfectly.

This is delicious.   I did however use both yellow squash and zucchini and I added mushrooms (which I precooked).  So good, the were no leftovers.

I didn’t make any changes to the recipe. I liked it but my family felt it needed more flavor. So next time I’ll still follow the basics of the recipe but add my own twist to it.

Deelish!  I made a few changes based on what I had. Frozen squash which I warmed in the microwave and drained first. I also used buttermilk. Next time I will use less crumbs and add garlic, just because I love it ;) also may add more cheese. This type of recipe lends itself well to tweaks. This is going in the file. Thanks!

I used 2 yellow squash and 1 zucchini and it had a great look to it. I sprinkled Mrs. Dash table blend on the squash while they were cooking. I used Colby Jack instead of cheddar and a bit of shredded Parmesan that I had left from a lasagne I made recently. This was the first time I ever made this recipe and everyone loved it!

My husband doesn't really like squash,  but this is a do over! We love this, easy to make and the flavor is great. It's going to be  on our table a lot. I did cut the milk to 1/3C  and used cheddar gold fish crackers ,crushed. 2 C  and it works great!

Made to recipe.  Did add extra cup of cheese only because we are cheese fanatics.  Delicious.  Even my picky eater ate it and wanted more.  Definitely a keeper.  Is now in my regular rotation.

I used Pepperidge farm stuffing mix instead of crackers. I think either would be delicious! Even my son and the neighbor kid raved about this dish! Reminded me of my grandmother’s. Great way to use up the abundance of summer squash!!

The recipe doesn't specify how thick the squash slices should be. I relied on my own cooking knowledge and cut them about 1/4 in. thick so they would hold their shape. 

It took considerably longer than five minutes to steam them until softened. And I'm glad I know to season throughout the cooking process or this would have been quite bland. The only seasoning in the recipe is added right at the end. 

I also doubled the cracker and cheese mixture that's folded in because my husband begged for it, so don't come for me!  Overall, it's a decent recipe that could use a little tweaking. It's a place to start.

I made this gluten free using gf buttery crackers and gf onion rings.  I did add a bit more butter to the crackers just for taste. The gf onion rings should be added the last ten minutes of baking. They will burn easily.

We really like this casserole. It’s easy and almost always made from things I have on hand. My particular preference is to use extra sharp cheddar cheese. I’ve made it many  times and it’s always good comfort food.

Roasted the squash and onion on the grill, that saved a step in having to drain it. Also, I used a variety of squash that is half green/ half yellow. That's just how it grows. No added salt, figured thetree was enough in the crackers. Otherwise, the same recipe.

This is my favorite squash casserole.  I add spinach to the mixture before baking.  It adds additional color and flavor.

Made as written. Very yummy, loved the crispyness of cracker topping. Next time I will butter my baking dish to prevent sticking. Although we loved scraping it for seconds!

I added cubed chicken to this to make it a complete meal for my family.   I baked it a little longer to make sure everything was cooked properly.   I also added a bit more cheese....you can never have too much cheese.

Pretty good.  Use saltines, because I had them in the house.  Used little milk and replaced with sour cream instead.  Add scallions along with onion because I wanted to use them up.  Hubby, a midwesterner guy, gobbled it though!

This recipe is AMAZING!!! I have fresh garden zucchini I needed to use and when I saw this recipe, I knew it'd be perfect. I'm sure it's equally amazing with the Yellow Squash. I made the recipe exactly as written, no changes. It wasn't too mushy at all, it was perfect.  MAKE THIS!!!

Our family really enjoyed this casserole.  I liked that it didn’t use  a soup or sour cream, making it less caloric.  I cut back a bit on the butter and it was still very good.  I will definitely make it again.

I made this for my churches homecoming. It was a big hit. I had people begging for the recipe. The only thing I did different was I added more cheese and crackers. I also added some sour cream.

Had to use saltines since I didn't have butter crackers and it turned out great.  Will add garlic next time though as it was a little bland.

A very good simple and adaptable recipe that is going into my regular rotation. I used zucchini and yellow squash and topped with just a little grated cheese for color. I think some bell pepper would be wonderful. Or use eggplant instead of squash.

Very good and easy recipe.  I did not add all the butter, used bread crumbs in place of the crackers, and used triple cheddar cheese!  AMAZING!  Full of flavor and crunch crust!! See picture!! It was a hit, will definitely make again!

Instead of cooking squash in water; I used cooking oil, olive oil and about a tablespoon of butter. I seasoned with salt, pepper, garlic and 1/4 cup rendered bacon fat. Seemed to be a smash at our family 4th of July dinner. I am not a chef either, I’m a COP that just loves to put out good food for my family.

I am not a squash lover but someone gave me two yellow crookedneck squash so I had to find a recipe! This was delicious! I followed the recipe exactly except that my two squash made a little over 4 cups. It even reheats well in the microwave. When I make it again, I might try using an 8x8 dish to make it thicker.

This was extremely dry.  Next time  I would only put crackers as a topping, not in the dish.  It was really  tasteless.

Made exactly as written. I did peel the squash a bit. Follow times as written so squash doesn’t get too mushy.
Delicious!

Great recipe for Jewish Passover- just use matzo meal or crumbs instead of crackers. I also added walnuts as I often do as an ovo-lacto vegetarian. Great side dish or main course.

Neither Hubby or I liked this dish. The squash got way to mushy. If you try this recipe I would recommend not pan frying the squash first.  Flavor was very much lacking. I won't bother making this again.

I’ve made this about 6 or so times trying to get it right. I love the flavors, but cant figure out how to get the texture right. It’s too moist and mushy for my liking.

I left out the butter that you're supposed to put on top and used textured veggie protein (TVP from Bob's Red Mill) instead of crackers. Mixed half the cheese/TVP into the casserole. Didn't add the top layer of cheese/TVP until the last 10 or 15 minutes. Mine was too watery so I'll cook the squash longer in the skillet next time. I might also salt it while it's in the skillet to draw out extra water.  Will make again.

I'm giving this recipe five stars because of the compliments I received from coworkers at the Thanksgiving dinner at work. They raved about it, otherwise I would have given it four stars... but all those people couldn't be wrong. Now about the recipe... great taste, great texture. Don't change a thing!

It was okay but I didn’t love the crackers in the squash mixture. They just tasted mushy. Crackers for topping is good. Also the video gives different measurements for the Amt of squash and onion unless I made the mistake.

Used breadcrumbs and double cheese! It turned out pretty awesome. I ended up not pre-cooking the squash and onions and just left the casserole in the oven for an extra 20 minutes. It turned out great!

Great casserole and very easy! Any mild squash will do- i even used spaghetti squash chopped and peeled and it turned out really good! Very creamy, comfort food.  I added extra toppings because i like more on top.

This recipe is soooo close to my Mama's recipe.  The only thing I do different (just cause it is easier and the way my Mama did it) is boil the squash and onions in a pot covered in water for about 15 minutes.  I drain it and then carry on with the recipe as written.  Amazing!

I made a double plus batch as I am overun with straight and gooseneck squash. This receipe is just so good as is.  I may add a touch of garlic this go round, not that it needs it . Dang good receipe!
We never tire of or fried squash either:  corn meal, flour, salt and a little pepper fried on moderate hot in your favorite oil until it starts to burn making it both crispy and somewhat soft. Just turn it occasionally to get some of it nicely burned. Darn I could eat squash every day!!!!

Easier than the milk cooked options plus we liked the larger size of the squash pieces.  Lastly we didn't have any crackers, so we used an approximate amount of bread crumbs.

This is a flexible, delicious recipe that gets rid of squash and zucchini!  I can adapt it to be gluten free, easily, by using gf crackers. It’s wonderful.

I followed it closely but also added half cup mozzarella cheese and to the egg mix added some Anaheim ad banana peppers from my garden....about 1/4 cup total of those...I also melted the butter for the topping baked 30 min at 400...husband loved it...gave some to neighbor for dinner who asked for the recipe!!! I hope more squashes grow in my garden!!

The recipe is forgiving. I had to mix club crackers into the butter crackers to have enough for a topping. I have filled out the milk with a enough plain yogurt to fill 3/4 cup of milk. It all works.

To lighten this up a bit, I used 2 cups extra squash, 1 cup of panko instead of the crackers and only 2T. butter.  I also added the oregano per another user's suggestion.  Delicious.

A very simple recipe that turned out great. I added a 10 oz can of RO-TEL original diced tomatoes and green chilies to give it added zing and microwaved 12 slices bacon to sprinkle on top. Everyone loved it!

Great dish! Like others who have reviewed this, I added extra spices: Italian seasoning, garlic, and some red pepper flakes. I changed up the cheese mixture to 1/2 mozzarella and 1/2 Parmesan-Romano mix. I also took the advice of another reviewer and I shortened the steps: no cooking the squash or onions ahead of time; added cheese and cracker mixture directly to the raw squash and onions, poured the milk/egg mixture over it and mixed until it coated everything. I baked covered on 325 for 1-1/2 hours, then uncovered and turned the broiler on for a few minutes to brown the top.

I read all the reviews on this recipe which I find helpful. Many said it was bland while others suggested adding this or decreasing this.  I used the basic recipe but substituted Chicken Stuffing  mix instead of the buttery crackers. I also did not cook my squash in water but sweated the onions and squash. OMG......the result is heavenly! Perfectly seasoned!

This was amazing!  I have made twice, exactly as written EXCEPT with one small change: I added a chopped jalapeno pepper and some chopped tomato and minced garlic to the squash and onion near the end of the saute. I am sure it would have been perfect without those extras, but I had some veggies that I wanted to use up. It was so good that my husband and I put the leftovers back in the oven the next morning and ate it as a breakfast side with our scrambled eggs. Delicious.

This is a good simple recipe, I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because it is a bit plain for my taste. I think next time I would like to try a recipe with other ingredients added. (maybe mushrooms and some kind of cream soup)

I really liked this dish.  Easy to make and so tasty.  I used only 1/2 cup of milk and am glad I did.

Pretty good.  I reduced the melted butter slightly, and blended it together with the crumbs/cheese, so did not dot the top.  I think it would be better with less crumb mixture mixed into the squash and milk, and use more on top.  I'll do that next time. Baking time and methods worked well.

This is a great side dis! Instead of cooking the squash in water, I sautéed the onion in olive oil for 5 minutes, then added the squash and cooked around 7 minutes. I also used multigrain crackers instead of butter crackers because that’s what I had—my husband said he liked this much better!

I made I first following the recipe, it was great. 
Then I made it using my dehydrated squash which was rehydrated, then sauted with the onion.   Used 1/4 cup sour cream in place of 1/4 cup of the milk and used very crisp veggie crackers in place of the buttery crackers.  that to turned out great.
I will make it again.

Made this exactly as the recipe states. I was a little doubtful because it didn’t look like my southern grandmother’s squash casserole, but it was wonderful!!  The only tweak I could suggest is adding a little more salt than it calls for, but of course that’s just for our taste. We have an abundance of squash in our garden so we will be making this again.

Great basic recipe. I used 25 reduced fat trisquits for a extra crunchy topping. Melted all the butter and added to crumb mixture then added half to veggies and used half as topping. Left out the salt added a bit of garlic powder and 4oz of diced green chilies. I will be making this all summer long!

Have made this many times; it's a family favorite.  Easy.  Great way to use up yellow squash and zucchini; I often put both in or any combination depending what is in my refrigerator at the time.  Always delicious; flexible on the type of cheese used as well

I kept the ingredients the same except I used colby jack cheese, what I had. The method I did change to save time and keep from dirtying up dishes. I cut the squash in about 1/2" chunks and sauted them and the onions in the 1/4 cup of butter, with a lid. Crushed the crackers in a gallon zip bag then added the cheese in with them.  It was very thin in my 13x9 pan so I used a round 1 1/2 qt. casserole dish and baked a little longer to get it browned.  It is very delicious!!

I followed the advice of the reviewer who suggested basically dumping it all into a pan and baking it for an hour...turned out a nice easy yummy side dish (but I love squash!)!  I used zucchini and went a little easy on the butter.  Good!  Would make again!

I discovered this casserole about 5 years ago from this site. It was good the first time but the addition of fresh or frozen green chili sent this recipe to the moon. (The canned stuff just isn't the same.) Add as much as will suit your taste...just a little for pizzazz or a lot for a BIG taste of New Mexico. Great as a side dish with meat or solo as a meatless dinner with sliced tomatoes topped with a little Ranch to cool the zing. Thanks to submitter.

This recipe is good. The texture is perfect. It's not to dry or wet, but It needs more flavor. I will definitely try this again adding more ingredients like crushed garlic and a half red onion and a half sweet onion with cream of celery soup and a 1/4 or 1/8 cup of sour cream and perhaps green scallions. I also prefer Cracker  Barrell cheese due to the intense flavor.

This recipe was a hit with my family. We now have a squash casserole that's easy to make but tastes as though it took hours. Our teenagers are so picky when it comes to vegetables, but now It's requested regularly as a side dish.  I used sharp cheddar to give it little more kick and used one egg instead of two.

Easy and delicious. I would give it 5 stars except I agree with some other commenters who suggested additional ingredients to add more flavor. I used some oregano while sautéing the squash. I think a little garlic would also be good. Next time, I might even try adding some Italian sausage or bacon and increase the cheese to make it heartier and serve it as a main dish.

I had a bunch of zucchini as well as yellow squash and used them both in the recipe.  It was fantastic and I even got my husband to eat it! Yummy!

I made this prior to reading any reviews, but added 4 fresh cloves of garlic to it and doubled most everything else.  I boiled then simmered my squash, which was coarsely chopped into chunks close to an inch in length, for 25 minutes, and left to cool.    Added those to the cooled sauteed garlic and onion.  Mixed well, added the scrambled egg and milk mixture, poured the melted butter over it and then added 1/3 of the crushed crackers ( I used two sleeves) mixed well, then spread the remaining crushed crackers over the top.  I baked mine for about 40 mins at 375.

I triple the recipe now as one pan is never enough! I grow my own squash and my family LOVES this recipe, I also added sauteed chicken in butter and garlic to this and it was a home run. One dish meal!

This was very tasty.  Good way to use up all that summer squash.  I did substitute regular soda crackers for the round buttery kind since I didn't have any, but still good the same.  Thanks for the recipe.

This recipe for the Summer Squash Casserole was great.  I usually make a squash casserole that has a lot more ingredients, including Pepperidge Farm Cornmeal Stuffing on top.  And has more ingredients and takes more time to assemble and bake.  I really like it -but for a quick, easy casserole this one is a winner.  I can't stop eating it.

I really needed another recipe for  summer squash, the garden  was over flowing this year.  My husband can't eat onion's so I had to substitute with some garlic, but everything else was the same. Worked perfectly.  I made it twice and the second time I cooked it at 375 for a little longer and it had a perfect crispy topping.

Followed the recipe verbatim. Well I did put a few more crackers and cheese on the top. It was a huge hit. We have a garden that is pumping out the squash like crazy! Nice to find a new way to enjoy it.

I really like this recipe. My Grandmother made this for many years at Thanksgiving and Christmas. I like a little more cheese in the mix, and on top, but this is the perfect basic recipe for squash casserole.

I make this with m y 10 year old son.  We were looking for something to make with all the yellow squash our garden was producing and this was the perfect dish.  Super easy, sweet, creamy and a little crunch from the crackers.  Definetly will make this again.

Been eating squash for weeks and needed a new idea, so I tried this. Didn't have the kind of crackers so used whole wheat crackers and bread crumbs. Also I added diced fresh jalapeno and minced garlic as well as other seasonings we like when I sautéed (rather than the water). It is great! Not mushy at all and very tasty!

I doubled the recipe the last time I made it and it still didn't last long. This is the best Yellow Squash recipe I've ever made. The only change was to add several cloves of minced fresh garlic (to the doubled recipe).

This was a good recipe, and I modified it to my taste. My family enjoys a richer tasting recipe. I sauteed the squash briefly with fresh garlic and a small onion. The sauteing cuts down on the 'watery-ness' that occurs from steaming. Instead of the bacon some people mentioned in their comments, I added a few slices of prosciutto. I used added a can of cream of chicken soup.  Other than these additions I followed the remainder of the recipe.

Did add about a half cup of French' fried onion to cheddar and cracker mix, and did use the Almond milk.  My husband raved about it and since it is squash season in our garden, guess what he'll be getting?

This was delicious! I did add a little more cheese (because we're cheese lovers) and I cut my squash in different thicknesses to have a variation with softness. This way it was soft, but still had texture and wasn't "mushy". I also make my potato salad and mashed potatoes this way. I would most definitely make it again! We loved it!!

Excellent way to use yellow squash. I have never cooked squash except to fry and this dish was a real treat that I will definitely repeat.

Everyone loved it!  Use smaller squash before the seeds get large and mash  the squash and onions before putting them into the casserole as that makes them creamier,  This recipe is a keeper!

This gets 4 stars because I had to modify the recipe a bunch to love it. Here's what I changed:

-its winter and I couldn't find any "yellow squash" up here in Canada (pattypans, crooknecks, etc), so I substituted for zucchini. I found 3 large zucchinis was about 5.5 cups of squash (once peeled and sliced), so I adjusted the rest of the recipe up accordingly
-for extra flavour, I followed the directions of other reviewers and  added oregano flakes (a liberal sprinkling) to the squash/onion mixture while simmering. 
-I also added a couple of pinches of nutmeg to the crust mixture (crackers and cheese). 
-I used mozza cheese instead of cheddar, and used 1.5x what the recipe called for
-I also added about 2tsp of parmesan cheese to the casserole mixture for a little extra "zing"

This is a really good recipe that is super tasty no matter what small tweaks you make. After trying it first as is,  we loved the flavor but wanted it less mushy (for kids w texture issues) so based on other reviews, the second time, I barely cooked the squash and onion, using very little water, so it would stay on the firm side, used only one egg and a little less than 1/2 cup milk. Halved the butter also. Crackers and cheese as listed. Turned out great for us! Thank you so much for posting! It will become a nice staple in our rotation.

This is a super easy and delicious side dish that gives us another option besides potato or green bean casseroles for potlucks. I have now made and served this dish 3 times and everyone raves about it.  All 3 times I have come home with an empty Pyrex dish so that tells me that is is a great dish to serve. Very easy and quick to put together.

I really liked this recipe because it's easy. I don't eat cheese, so I made it without, and it turned out great. I did spice it up a little with a can of  green chilies that I put in with the  onions and sautéed. The last time I made it I didn't use enough butter. Butter makes all the difference it  gives it the crispness on top.

I cooked this as a side dish for Thanksgiving. I had my nephew over who hardly eats anything. We coached him into eating just a bite and boy did he love it. He loved it so much that he wanted more before going to bed. I didn't need to ask the rest of the family how it was because it didn't last a second day. Very delicious meal addition!

I didn’t change anything except that I had to freeze it (without toppings, added that after thawing) before I could cook it. Of course it was a bit soupy but it was very good!

I will make again and will add more squash for a deeper  or more robust  look. The squash required about 15 min cook time to be translucent on med. heat.

The only thing that I changed was that instead of cracker  crumbs, I used Pepperidge Farms Stuffing Mix and increased the amount of sharp  Cheddar Cheese that was used. It's a big hit with my family! Thanks for the recipe!

This casserole is delicious. I made some adjustments and it turned out great! When steaming the squash & onion, I added dried oregano and left the squash slightly crispy (I didn't want it to be mushy) I also added a little bit of garlic salt. I didn't have any crackers, so I substituted it with crushed special k cereal. I also cut up small pieces of sharp white cheddar, as I didn't have shredded cheese. On top of the final crumbs, I also left out the 2 tablespoons of butter. I only ended up cooking it for 20 mins, as it browned fast on top. Overall, it was delicious and not salty. I will definitely be making this recipe again.

I've been looking for a squash casserole recipe like this for years.  This is the closest one I've found to one remembered from my teenage years.   Reading other reviews, I did make some minor changes having more to do with texture than flavor.  I cooked the squash/onion mixture  without a lid so that the excess moisture could evaporate.  I added another 10 crackers but I think it would have been just as good with the original amount. I didn't measure the cheese, just shredded until it looked like the amount I wanted; likely it was more than 1 cup.  And I cooked the casserole for 15 minutes before adding the crumb topping and cooking for the last 10 minutes.   Delicious!!  Yummy!!  So glad my hubby doesn't like squash because that means I get the whole thing to myself.

I think it was the onions in it that made it taste nasty to me. I thought it was very bitter. I'll just go back to sauteing with a bit of butter from now on.

Very good as-is, but next time I will leave out the 2nd egg.  Also needed a bit more spice.  Overall, a keeper with some modifications!

Simple and quick. I made some changes to shorten clean-up time. I had just two yellow squash so I halved the recipe amounts. I put the sliced squash and onions in a pie plate with some water and covered it, then microwaved for 4 minutes. Drain the veggies, melt the butter in a pyrex 1cup measuring glass, then add milk to the ½ point, pour the milk/butter into one beaten egg in a bowl, pour over veggies in pie plate, toss in crushed crackers and cheese, and mix a few times.Note the original recipe is missing "add the cheese". It was perfect for a tired school night.

I really didn't use much of this recipe other than the basics, but it turned out great! no butter, cheese, crackers, or milk. I added minced garlic (3 cloves) plus 6 banana peppers, and 2tsp of Wegmans Tuscan spice. Instead of bread crumbs I used crushed potato chips.

I loved this recipe I needed a recipe with just yellow squash because someone forgot to plant zucchini this year... The only change I would do is add more squash and crackers. It is very delicious!

This is a keeper. I made this recipe as is with one exception.  I only had Ritz Toasted Chips on hand so I used those. Also I melted the butter to pour over the topping. This is now my go-to recipe for squash casserole.

This is a delicious side dish. I followed the recipe exactly. Sauteing the squash is a more time efficient way of cooking it versus boiling as I read in other recipes. Great way to use up the garden squash. I will make this again.

This far exceeded my expectations. Squash casserole really didnt sound that appetizing but I had a lot I wanted to use up. It was delicious!! 
I changed a few things, I sautéed the squash in olive oil with minced garlic, thin sliced onions with salt,  pepper and oregano. I greased thr bottom of the pan, but I didn't add any of the butter it called for. Mine sat for about 20 min before cutting into it, mine wasn't wet or soggy, perfect texture! Great recipe!

Great summertime dish. I use it as the entree. My modifications  are: a mix of zucchini and yellow squash,  removed skin from squash, extre crackers, extra cheese and a shake of cayenne pepper. Enjoyed the leftovers too!

I did not change anything and it was delicious. My husband does not like yellow squash at all and he loved this so much he wants me to make it and take some to my daughter who gave me the squash that a neighbor gave her. She does not like yellow squash either.

This has seriously got to be the best squash casserole recipe I have ever eaten. I made it exactly as written because, honestly, I couldn't see anything to change. My husband are half the pan by himself, so I KNOW it's a great recipe. Not at all wet and runny like others can be, and I thought the one bag of cheese was perfect. Will definitely make this part of my summer recipes for those fresh garden squash!

Turned out amazingly delicious! Followed the recipe to a tee, but sautéed the onions separately and used a special onion/garlic seasoning. Easy to make and extremely tasty.

Cut in half...baked in 9" round casserole dish. Added 1 crumbled crisp strip of bacon. Substituted Boar's Head chipotle smoked gouda cheese for the cheddar to give it a little "oomph". Added a little sliced green onion tops for color. Make sure squash is well drained....do not rush or skip this step.

My family loved this and gobbled it all up. Based on personal preference I chose not to saute the squash prior to baking. We like the squash more whole and tender than casserole-y mush. So if that is you then I would suggest making that change. Besides that the seasoning is perfect.

This is just okay - more like a squash stuffing due to cracker crumbs - did need more seasoning. I did just put squash, onion and some garlic in large frying pan with NO water and cooked until barely tender before mixing. Eliminated the soggy problem.

Skipped the pre-cooking step.  Plenty tender enough for my test without it. And went half squash and half zucchini, as well as bread crumbs for the inside and crackers for the top to cut the sodium a bit.

I followed recipe exactly except I added garlic powder, minced garlic, onion salt and  1/2 can of cream of mushroom soup.  I fried four pieces of bacon and sprinkled it on top of the cracker mixture on top.  If you wanted you could also add chicken and artichoke hearts sour cream and Jalepenos  for an extra kick. :)

Eggs ruined this. And too much butter (I didn't think there was such a thing.) Followed recipe to the letter. Ended up with a greasy mess of scrambled egg bits throughout.

This is a great recipe to work off of.   I used 1 cup of garlic herb bread crumbs instead of the crackers with great results.

I added green, orange, & red peppers diced  for a 2 lb. squash casserole. I also used a whole onion, finely chopped, and sautéed this with the peppers in EVOO  and butter.  I used 1/2 cup+ mayonnaise.  The egg does make it too stiff, but then I used two b/c I broke one. Should have used one or maybe none and mixed cracker crumbs or Panko sparingly to the mix instead. On top I used Panko b/c it gives the surface a lighter weight topping.  I've tried the round crackers and did not like that at all, but I did not mix them with butter either.  In addition I added herbs de Provence to the squash mixture.

I made this pretty much as written. The only thing extra I did was add some extra cheese on top before putting it in the oven. 

This is really good! I used local, Texas sweet onions. Mmmm. I also used yellow squash and zucchini as they both came with our CSA delivery. I would make this again. :)

I made this, but did modify it just a bit.  I added garlic salt and a little nutmeg (like one of the other reviewers suggested) while the squash was cooking.  I also mixed in a few Italian bread crumbs with the crushed crackers.  My husband, who is not a squash fan, actually liked it and said he would eat it again!  I also liked it a lot.

Loved it the original way but after that I tried so other stuff with it. I added garlic Ritz instead and tried some diced tomatoes in it. My husband asks for  me to make this every time he sees Yellow squash in the store. I would give this a 10 star rating if I could too! great for summer easy dinner.

Love Squash Casserole!  Made this in the microwave.  Added a couple of big tablespoons of mayo and subbed dried onion for the fresh and 2 cups dry stuffing for Ritz.  Also reduced to 1/2 cup milk and used garlic salt rather than plain.  Only had frozen squash, so used that.  Good recipe!  Thanks for posting!!!

I made this recipe for Easter and sent my husband to my parents' house with it, since I had to work. I expected to have some leftovers but it was all gone by the time I got off! Wish I could say from experience that it was great, but I think that speaks for itself! Now I have to make another one just so I can try it!

This is always a hit when I make it. I spice up the squash mixture with garlic powder, nutmeg, white pepper, a little sirrachia, and whatever else I'm feeling that day. I also cut the squash into chunks versus slices.  I also melt the butter before I add it to the breadcrumbs. Yummy.

This is divine. It's rare that everybody in my household would all love one recipe this much.  But this one made it to my recipe book.  I didn't have enough Townhouse crackers, so I used half white crackers. And used only about 1 tsp of butter pieces on top.  Baked 22 min.

sautee onion in bacon grease, add 1 t. garlic powder,  only 1 egg, and 2 additional T. butter. If you buy the Ritz 4 pack, 35 crackers is one pack.

I literally just made this and took it out the oven and we ate it for dinner.  It is delicious.  I used egg beaters instead of eggs and skim milk instead of whole milk.  I also added a bit more seasoning.  Because we are trying to eat healthier I chose to use half of the amount of recommended cheese and ritz crakers.

We love this recipe. I made two changes. 1) use only one egg 2) use bacon flavored Ritz crackers.

This is fantastic!  I do think they type of cheese you use matters (I prefer to use sharp cheddar and a 4 cheese Mexican blend).  I use a little more cheese and cracker crumb than it calls for and I also add more onion (preference).  This has become my favorite recipe for a side dish.  LOVE IT!

I have made this numerous times...the only thing I do differently is to use Italian bread crumbs instead of the crackers...we don't eat crackers...I don't know how this might change the taste, but it's delicious this way...it also freezes well as it's just the 2 of us...

It's a fantastic dish!  My mom raved about it and asked for it again.  I had buttery Club crackers on hand instead so went with it, and also used parmesan cheese, along with some kale from the garden.  Delicious and easy, thanks!

Yummy!!  I used half Colby jack/half cheddar, but otherwise followed the recipe.   Even my kids ate it up!  Delicious and easy.  I like another reviewer's idea to add bacon.  I'll have to try that.

Nothing like taking cheese, crackers & butter to make something like squash taste good...and it worked!!  Tasted wonderful!  Wish I had read the comments before I had made it, because I absolutey would have added some bacon to the sauté mix!!

I used 5 cups of thinly sliced squash and an extra cup of sharp cheddar.  It is a good way to use up all that extra squash at the end of the growing season.

I added a half pound of sausage and used Italian bread crumbs instead of cracker crumbs. It was amazing! The entire family enjoyed it! I served it as Sunday lunch with a loaf of crusty Italian bread.

Yummy. I made with 2 cups of crushed corn flakes instead of crackers since I didn't have them. Used one egg since that's all I had. A similar recipe included sour cream so this time I made this I tried it topped with a spoonful which was also yummy. Thanks for the recipe!

I have never rated anything before but this is so worth it!!!  I've recently turned vegetarian so I'm always in the lookout for no meat recipes that will taste good and be satisfying.  This fits both of those categories perfectly!!!  Absolutely delicious and I didn't change anything!!!

I added a few more crackers. I didn't add water to the squash and onions. Instead I put the salt and pepper on them, set on medium heat with a lid and cooked until squash was tender. It doesn't require draining. I've made it several times now. My family and friends love this recipe and has made it their "go to" square casserole like myself. The finer grated cheese works best. You don't have to add the butter to the top. The butter does gives it a prettier golden brown though.

I work in a nursing home. I made this for the patients. I have to improvise on some of the ingredients but stuck to a lot of the actual recipe & the review advice. Mostly because of the size I had to prepare. They LOVED it!!! A few of them said it brought back memories of their own cooking in the past.

This is a good recipe to use some of that garden squash. I think adding a little more cheese works for my family. I also added some Italian seasoning, which added a little more flavor.

I didn't care for it. It was soggy and didn't have a ton of flavor for me and it didn't make a nice creamy sauce.

This was really just okay, the crunchy cracker and cheese topping was good, but the rest was too eggy and with mushy soggy crackers. I think we'll try the condensed soup, sour cream version.

I followed the recipe to a tee.  I put the cooked squash in my Cuisinart and chopped it up a bit b/c my husband has difficulty eating large chunks of food.  Delicious!

Good recipe!  I added one clove of garlic, sliced; a small amount of sweet bell peppers, sliced; seasoned salt instead of table salt, and Wheat Thins, Sweet Onion, crushed (instead of buttery crackers)..all of which was because that's what I had on hand.  Also halved the recipe, cooking for one.  It was delicious!  Will make again and do recommend.  Thanks for sharing.

This recipe was very easy. My guests loved it! I placed ingredients in food processor and pureed after steaming squash and onion. Also added a little red pepper. Great substitute for mashed potatoes as a side dish.

After reading the negative reviews, I made a couple adjustments, and this turned out excellent! This is also my very first making squash casserole, although I have eaten it many times.  I cut the squash into chunks rather than slices, and used a little more than 4 cups. I did not cook the squash too long at all. I reduced to 1 egg, and rather than 3/4 cup of milk I used about 1/3 cup of sour cream. I used a little less than a 1/4 cup melted butter. I used cubed cheddar cheese (only because that was all I had) and cut it into tiny cubes. As far as seasoning, I used plenty of salt and pepper, and added garlic powder and 1 teaspoon of roasted minced garlic. Loved it!

Very good, I sautéed a combo of squash, zucchini, garlic and onions in a bit of bacon fat and let it drain. I added freshly cut corn from three leftover ears at the last minute before I baked it, wonderful savory dish. The top was crunchy and the entire dish is very flavorful.

I liked it fairly well, but next time I will add the butter directly to the cracker crumbs that go on top. That way it will be moist & not super dry! Otherwise, it's a good recipe.

This is so yummy. I had some leftover cornbread that I crumbled up and used instead of the butter crackers and it turned out so delicious similar to cornbread dressing!

This recipe was great, but I added ground turkey. For the cracker crumbs, I used Captain's wafers jalapeño cheddar... It gave it a spicy flavor.. did not add eggs, but I did add bell pepper.

My brother and I loved this side dish! I did make some minor modifications to the recipe: 1) I doubled the onions, softened them with water, and browned/carmelized them in some oil before adding in the yellow squash to the pan for cooking/light browning. It turned out wonderfully! Next time I will decrease the egg and milk each by 1 tsp-1 tbsp. This is an excellent recipe and I look forward to making it again!

DELICIOUS! Lightened up the recipe - only used 2 tbsp Moove Over Butter and a few sprays of butter flavored Pam, Egg Beaters, reduced fat Ritz crackers, 2% cheese, 2% milk. Also added some garlic powder.

Super easy and Super good.  I used half sliced yellow squash and half cubed zucchini for texture and flavor.  Added 1/2-1 tsp of cayenne for a little kick.  Used sharp cheese.  Oh, BTY...one sleeve is 32 crackers for Ritz; not 35.  HA!  Turned out Great!!  Saved recipe to make again.

I had way to much squash from the garden and we were getting tired of fried squash. I was a little skeptical of squash cass. b/c I've tried some that were no good, but this was amazing! I couldn't believe my husband and 2yr old son loved it as well! I did cut the recipe in half b/c it's just us 3 and I didn't know if we would like it.

I loved this dish, simple but lots of classic flavor. Served it with Thanksgiving  dinner, m mother loves everything squash. She said she loved it! Came over late that night asking where the left overs were....

I thought this was delicious.  Will definitely save in my recipe and do again.  I love squash and usually run out of ideas on different ways to cook it.  I did not use all the butter it stated thought it was a little too much.   I sprinkled the top with my olive oil spritzer.

This recipe was really good and definitely used up all that squash that I had leftover from my harvest. The only thing that I noticed was that the onion flavor was a little strong for me so I always saute them first before adding them now but this is a personal preference because I dislike the taste of raw onion.

I've served this recipe to family and friends and always get rave reviews-even from my gourmet cook friend who asked that I bring it to her Thanksgiving dinner. I do add bacon and sauté onion & squash in same pan with a little bacon drippings. It's wonderful.

It was so easy .. AND it tasted so good. 
Decided at the last minute to make it ... even after I had already put the squash on.
 The family loved it. Can't wait to make it again.

I read several reviews before making this, and I agree with others that you can reduce the caloric content,  while still maintaining the integrity of the original recipe. 
I substituted white cheddar Cheez-It crackers for the Ritz, and cut back on the amount of low fat cheddar I used, as the crackers emit a cheese-y, potentially greasy, ooze- all on their own. I added lots of garlic to the sautee pan, and reduced the amount of unsalted butter by about a tablespoon. I used 1% milk, and I used white and black pepper, liberally, and added about a half teaspoon of nutmeg to the squash mixture. 
Make sure you drain really well after cooking the squash and onions, or it will be rather mushy. I also cooked about 10 mins longer. Made this twice in a month, as we had squash overload earlier this summer.  Kids, 18 and 10, both liked it OK, boyfriend loved it, as did I. Didn't last longer than 2 days either time. Will definitely make again.

It was good, I made more squash than the recipe called for and it still couldn't have made 10 servings. It serves about 6. I used crumbled Ritz crackers as the topping.

I have made this several times. I cook in a cast iron skillet in the oven which I have preheated with butter in it. EVERYONE loves it. I do add more cheese and use 1/2 and 1/2 instead of milk. It makes it fluffier and even better. (I only substituted because I did not have milk.)

We enjoyed this very much. We have been searching for ways to use our squash and zuc, and this was one worth making again. I left out the butter, salt, and pepper, so each person could add the amount they like. Next time I think I will add more crackers.

I used zucchini in place of the yellow squash and the family loved it. I was also short a few crackers so I added some panko - a substitution that was virtually unnoticeable. I also reduced the total amount of butter by half - also not noticeably missing anything. Overall, I thought this recipe was easy and reasonably quick. I'll be making this again!

This is a calorie-laden recipe, heavy like quiche.  I am calorie-conscious, and prefer squash/onion/salt/pepper cooked in a pot with a little water.  Drain the liquid, and add a small amount of butter.  Yum!

This is good, but even though I added spices it was still a bit bland. Next time I will add a little more cheese and some bacon. I thin sliced my squash, used it raw and baked it 45 minutes. It was perfectly done

MMMMM Hubby and I loved! I didn't precook at all, after reading other reviews, I didn't want it mushy. Cut back on the butter, added garlic too.

Followed the recipe ingredients as written, no substitutes and we loved it. I did mix the 2T butter into the cracker crumbs and then sprinkled it on top, but it worked great, nice a golden on top.  This was actually the first time I had cooked, and eaten, yellow squash and I couldn't be happier with how it turned out. Very yummy! I was told "this is a keeper" and I totally agree!

Excellent!  To make it low-carb, I cut the number of crackers in half with no crumbs on top.  Will have to try with bacon next time.

Very good, a nice hearty side dish, but a little rich for us. I used less than half the butter (that's a LOT of butter) added several generous squirts of Franks hot sauce and generous black pepper before baking and the taste was perfect. Next time I think more squash, less butter and cheese might suit our tastes better, and I believe I can cut the crackers by at least 1/3 by putting less in with the squash, I don't think we'll miss those, but the topping stays   - it's wonderful!

Very good!  We liked it I cut the recipe in half but used the fool amount of cheese. I also added some left over cooked chicken breast. I baked it in an 8 inch square pan.  Served it as main course.  I would make this again and you could use any meat.

LOVED this recipe!  I was pondering what to make for dinner and what to do with the excess yellow squash from the garden.  This was an easy peasy dish to prepare.  The house still smells amazing and I would love second helpings except one serving filled me up!  My daughter said this recipe is a sure keeper.  I'll be sure to share this recipe on facebook.  Thank you!

I made this tonight and my family loved it!  Only change I made was baking it in a medium sized Corning ware.  It was thicker than it would have been in the 9x13 and soooo delicious and moist.  I might add a few chunks of ham added to it next time, just for variety.   Will definitely recommend it to my friends!

I don't generally write reviews for recipies but this one is amazing!  I did modify it a bit by reducing the butter to 1/8 cup and added a touch more cheese.  I recommend this.  It is easy and tasty!

Wonderful recipe. Used all ingredients except subbed half and half for  milk (was feeling naughty). It kind of reminds me of a really moist quiche but better. Surprised how sweet it tasted, I think it was the crackers but it was enjoyed by all. I will experiment w/the veggies, the base is good and a cubed potato/leek instead of onion combination sounds pretty good to me. Thanks for the recipe!

This one was a winner with my family.  My husband especially liked the crust on top.  I looked at the other reviews and added garlic powder and used melted butter on top instead of the pats of butter.

I didn't have any onion on hand, so I made this without. It was amazing! I cooked my squash a little longer than I was suppose to so it was more mushy. But the flavor was amazing. I could have this with any meal. So good!!!

This is a really terrific recipe and relatively easy as well as quick.  Didn't last long!  I did, however, substitute light butter, red. fat milk, and red. fat cheese.  We didn't miss those calories one little bit either.

My husband said to add this to our dinner circuit as a regular. I tweaked it based on comments. Used 1 zucchini to 3 crooknecks, sweet onion, sliced fresh garlic, and a seeded, finely chopped jalapeno, and cooked it until tender in nonstick skillet w/o additional liquid. I seasoned w/ salt, pepper and .5 tsp. of creole seasoning. Mixed with 1 egg, evaporated milk, no butter (I forgot it) in the casserole, just on top, and mixed in some parmesan cheese on the top. I made the casserole at noon, refrigerated it, then cooked it at supper. It seriously rocked!

Very filling, but bland. I would definitely add some spices next time. I did add russet potatoes to the squash while cooking, and some black beans when I stirred it all up together for some extra oomph. It needs spices of some kind.

I have tried this  recipe many times especially last year my son in law had a garden in our yard and the squash was wonderful so I made this quite often. Ive made it as a side dish and always made so much I would eat it for lunch. The only thing is that I always thought it tasted  better with our homegrown squash than the store bought. But yes this is delicious.....Ive also added bacon  to it on several occasions and also  mixed zucchini with the yellow squash and it was Amazing......Debbie S

I used 2 sm. yellow squash, 1 sm. green zuke, onions, and 1 cup of matchstick carrots (for natural sweetness & color) and sautéed them in Kerrigold Irish Garlic Butter for about 5 minutes, adding minced garlic, parsley, pepper and basil at that time.  I did not drain as this was the basis of the flavors with the melted butter.  In a large baggie, I crunched up a sleeve of Keebler Butter Crackers (love the elves!) and added 2 cups of shredded cheddar & 1/2 cup of shredded parmesan cheese to the crackers.   I added about a quarter of the crumbs & cheeses to the veggies.  In a small bowl I combined 1 beaten egg, 1/2 to 3/4 cup fat free Half & Half, and about 1/4 cup of light sour cream and added that to the veggie mixture.  Poured this into an 8 x 11" buttered oval casserole and topped with the remaining crumbs & cheeses.  After drizzling 2 Tbs. melted butter over top, I baked it in a pre-heated 375 oven for 20 min.  My husband and I devoured half the casserole along with lobster tails, swordfish & rice pilaf.  Absolutely YUMMY!  I have made 3 other recipes, but we agree that this is the best!

Good recipe.  I asked for squash from the grocery store, but my shopper didn't quite get enough for the crowd I had to feed.  This recipe came in handy.  Of course, I added extra cheese and a little Parmesan.  This recipe is a keeper.

Love it!  I cook the squash longer than 5 minutes because that is my personal taste.  I also add less milk to create a more solid casserole. The taste is great!  This is my new squash casserole recipe!!

I wanted to use this recipe for Thanksgiving so made it a few days ahead to try it out first and see if we liked it.  We found it good but too salty for our taste.  The crackers have salt, the cheese is salty, so I omitted the added tsp. of salt when I made it for Thanksgiving.  Came out good and most people liked it.  Overall pretty good.

This was a great recipe.  I was a little skeptical but based on the reviews decided to give it a whirl.  It was very good.  I followed the directions but added some cooked diced chicken to the mixture to make it more of a main dish.  It hit the spot!  Thank you!

I tweaked the recipe for richness. Added an entire onion (suppose it then became a squash and onion casserole) and parboiled both the onions and squash in chicken stock. Also added parmesan cheese, freshly minced garlic, and extra butter (Smart Balance Omega) to the egg and 2% low fat milk mixture which I used my Vitamix to blend well. Also added extra crackers. I plan to use freshly grated parmesan cheese and add mushrooms the next time I prepare this dish.  I won't be able to eat this often, but will enjoy every bite (calorie) when I do!

I used zuchinni instead of yellow squash and sauteed the zuchinni and onions instead of simmering in water.  Turned out absolutely delicious.  Even my husband who doesn't like zuchhini loved it!

Loved this! I struggled to find a summer squash recipe that didn't include cream-of-whatever soup. I try to steer clear of processed foods, so instead of the butter crackers, I created a topping using panko breadcrumbs, which I toasted in a pan with a bit of butter. I added a few tablespoons of freshly grated romano cheese to mimic the saltiness of crackers. These simple ingredients really make for a great side dish!

This was a hit with my family and when I made it the second time I added a 4 oz. can of diced green chili's which made it a bigger hit.  I had more squash from our garden than I knew what to do with so I made up this recipe, packed it in small tins with lids from the dollar store and put them in the freezer.  Now we'll have it all winter too.

I really enjoyed this dish.  I did not have the crackers so I used Panko bread crumbs instead.  I also have two small kids at time and hate to dirty extra dishes so I just put the squash, onions, and milk mixture in the oven and baked it for 25 minutes.  I also added chicken and sprinkled paprika, garlic powder and parsley into the milk mixture.  After baking for 25 minutes, I then added all of the bread crumbs and cheese and baked it for an additional 10 minutes.  Gonna add this to one of my favorites.

I subbed while wheat Ritz crackers and soy milk (still used cheddar cheese) and it tasted great!  I used really great quality mild cheddar, which I think made a big difference. My dairy loving partner could not tell the difference, and loved it!

the only negative thing I have to say is next time I'll use less butter.  Otherwise it was very tasty and easy to prepare

Very tasty! No jalapeños, and I added butter since my bacon did not produce many drippings. We loved it.

Amazingly good! I made it for a family party and everyone wanted the recipe!I added bacon to mine also and little more cheese than it called for. I also used butter club crackers. Delicious!

Enjoyed it (the concept) very much.  After reading other reviews I backed the 2 eggs down to one - more than sufficient to bind.  We used Pepperidge Farm Baked Naturals four cheese Italian herb crips for the crackers (because that is what we had).  The cheese was a combination of cheddar, gouda, and parmesiano reggiano.  For a final modification we did not dot the top with butter, trusting the cheese mixture would be sufficiently "short" to make the topping crisp up nicely.  It was indeed.

We served the casserole as an alternative to potato and vegetable with steak and mushrooms.  Tonight we will reheat what remains and serve alongside lemon garlic marinated chicken breasts.  Will definitely use the concept again with whatever variations make sense at the time.

I baked my squash instead of cooking it on the stove top. Wanted it a little firmer.I used chicken broth instead of the egg.I added Mrs. Dash and minced garlic. It turned out really good. Everyone loved it. I will definitely make it again

I have made this recipe many times.  It is good.  Almost like one I used to make from Southern Living magazine from back in the '90s (minus the milk).  One thing that I do when I make it (and this is after many times of making it) is to add a lot more sweet (Vidalia, Mayan sweets) onions and then add a drained can of Rotel.  Kicks it up a notch while still keeping the squash-y flavor.  I like that this particular squash recipe doesn't call for mushroom soup like a lot of them do.  When I don't have crackers, I've used panko or seasoned crumbs for the topping.

I made this with 1 large zucchini. I cooked the zucchini and onion together in a large ceramic baking dish in the microwave for 8-10 min. I drained off all liquid that formed. Followed the rest of the recipe with the addition of granulated garlic and celery salt, but I cooked in the microwave covered for 10-12 minutes. Makes about 4 large side dish helpings after cooking

I make this all the time, but I grate the zucchini and add 2 more eggs, can of green chillies, chopped ham or bacon and chopped red pepper or sun dried tomatoes for colour. We have it for breakfast. Quick and easy.

I loved this!  It came out perfectly!  Some people suggested sauteing the onions and adding garlic and others suggested adding bacon, so I decided to saute the onions and garlic in bacon grease and cut back on the butter.  To be honest, I didn't try it the original way first, but I can't imagine it tasting any better.

I have made this recipe several times.  It brings great taste to a fairly mild squash.  I have added a bit of parmesan cheese to it as well and is delicious.

we don't eat crackers so I used rice chex cereal instead. Next time I will not add salt. I think that was the biggest problem for us.

I can't believe that such simple ingredients can yield such scrumptious results! This was simple and the perfect side dish for a mid week dinner.  My husbands exact words were "I can eat this all day"! Indeed a winner and we will be making this again.

This was a hit with the whole family. This is especially true with me, since I am not a big squash lover, but I enjoyed the squash prepared this way.

My wife added provolone cheese and said it was even better, so I will try it with an Italian cheese blend next time.

Loved this! I made it exactly as written, and it was amazing. I think i didn't drain the squash quite enough, and next time I may make extra cracker crumb/cheese mixture to make the kids like it more.

My father had these HUGE Italian squashes that took over his entire garden and kept producing throughout the summer.  I explored many different recipes for utilizing them and this one was FANTASTIC!!! Have made it several times now.  Very tastey ;)

Delicious and easy to make!  My 9 year old loved it which says a lot.  It was a tad bit salty and buttery for my taste so I will put less in next time so no biggie.  Thanks!

I only had 3 squash so cut down a bit on all the other ingredients.  It was a HUGE hit at my house.  A visitor declared that she is thinking about becoming a vegetarian and my great nephew declared it was his new favorite vegetable dish.  Loved it, but it doesn't warm up too well.

Very good.  I only used one egg to keep it from being too eggy.  I used a little olive oil when precooking the squash and onion.

My family LOVES this recipe and now I have my mom buying squash just to have this casserole. Dad hates cooked squash but loves this and the 1-year-old eats it like candy. I did add some garlic powder and a bit of perfect pinch to boost the flavor but everything else remained the same.  Next I'll try the zucchini/squash combo.  Thanks for sharing this delicious and easy recipe!

Needed something to do with all those squash in my garden. So glad I found this recipe. It's delicious! I used whole wheat ritz crackers in mine. It was a grand slam with my husband who asked me to make it again and bigger next time.

Loved this recipe!  I added bacon and used Panko bread crumbs instead of crackers.  I added half the cheese and cracker mixture to the casserole.  Covered and baked it as directed.  Then dabbed the oil off the top, sprinkled the remaining cheese and bread crumb mixture over the top and let it melt uncovered for five minutes.  It came out with a nice crust and was not gooey at all.  Awesome!

Wow! I can't stop eating it. It's delicious. I made a low-fat version using reduced fat wheat thins, skim milk, low-fat cheese, and egg beaters. I didn't add any butter or margarine. I seasoned with Trader Joe's 21 Salute Spice, and a bit of salt. My 4 year old loves it too.

This would be a great side dish for Thanksgiving or Christmas. I used the garlic butter ritz crackers and it gave it a nice but mild garlic flavor.

Great recipe!  As other reviewers stated, there is no need to pre-cook the squash, just cut into thin slices.  I softened the onions in the micro with butter and substituted what I had in the house: provolone cheese and club crackers.  I mixed the topping crumbs with melted butter and garlic powder and added to the top of the casserole during the last 10 minutes of baking until browned.  Be sure to grease the pan.

This recipe is delicious, and really easy to adjust on the fly, depending on the quantity of squash.  I made enough to feed the entire street.

Overall, this was pretty good, even my anti-casserole dad ate it and liked it fairly well.  I cooked my squash and onions in a small amount of water in the microwave - just sliced, put in the baking dish I baked the casserole in and added a tiny bit of water for steaming and covered with plastic wrap.  I microwaved for about 8 minutes total, and that really made this dish easy.  I used fresh breadcrumbs instead of crackers and cut back on the cheese a little.  I wanted more of a baked squash than a cheesy casserole.  I would have liked less of the egg mixture, but overall pretty good.  I'll probably make this again but modify it a bit.

THIS WAS GREAT.  
MAKE IT GLUTEN FREE BY USING GLUTEN FREE SEASON BREAD CRUMBS IN PLACE OF THE CRACKERS. ALSO TRY BUTTERMILK IN PLACE OF MILK. YUMMY!

It turned out pretty good, but next time I think I'll use more cheese, a little garlic, and Progresso Italian bread crumbs. It just didn't have enough season to it.

I made this recipe for dinner last night and it was a big hit.  I had just picked my first yellow and zucchini squash from my garden and wanted to try a new recipe..This will be a favorite in my house for a long long time.  I mixed the two squash together and followed recipe completely.

Made exactly as written. I halved the recipe and I'm seriously regretting it. We ate it way too fast!  While I did not grow up eating this, but something about this is so comforting to me.  Delicious!

Cooked this dish for my Luncheon Club and was a big hit.  Was glad to find a new recipe to use the squash from the garden.  My husband when tasting it said "don't forget how you made this".
Thanks for sharing!

We love this casserole and have it often. Of course I changed it a little in that I use 2 yellow squash, one zucchini and two small carrots and then follow the rest of the recipe as written. The additions make a colorful casserole and doesn't really affect the taste. It's a great way to use plentiful squash and with the additions it's easy to get extra veggies in your diet.

too much egg consistency. the squash was stuck together like glue and not enough cheese. will not make again. leftovers were equally unappealing due to the fact that when reheating, the crackers became mushy.

I love this recipe!! It's the bomb!
Ever since I tried making this recipe my family asked me to make it again, and again, and again!
I use gluten free cheddar crackers instead and it's even crunchier! So yummy!!!
I recommend this recipe for any occasion!

This is the best squash casserole.  Simple, easy to make and tastes great.  My only alteration to the recipe was to cut the recipe in half for two people.  This is a keeper.  I wouldn't change a thing!

this turned out yummy.  I used what I had in the house which was a jar of queso (medium, but really could use mild or spicy) in place of cheddar cheese and I used a box of chicken flavored stuffing instead of crackers.  The cheese and the stuffing is salty enough but I added a little Adobo to the squash.  Turned out delicious!

I just made this tonight with fresh squash from my garden and I will never cook squash any other way.  I cooked it just as recipe says and it was a hit with my whole family (even my 10 & 12 yr old sons) loved it.

This was fantastic.  Saw this idea on a tv show and since I'm trying to force myself to eat more vegetables, I decided to make it.  Super easy and tasty. Thanks!

This is my hubby's favorite way to eat squash and I have been making this recipe for years.  For anyone who says they don't eat summer squash or zucchini, give them a helping of this stuff and you'll change their minds.  Just had my leftovers for lunch.  Yum!  Thanks.

I changed this up a bit and added 1 lb. ground beef and 1 can of white beans to make it more of a mean. I also upped the amount of spices and added some cumin. It turned out pretty tasty.

My husband liked this a lot.  I liked it and will definitely make it again at some point, but wouldn't say it's the "best."  The texture was good and I added nutmeg and oregano per another review.  I like the idea of adding bacon and will probably try that next time, and cut the squash into smaller pieces.  Overall easy and good.

Really liked this dish.  I added a few jarred jalapeno slices and it kicked it up a notch.  Yum! Definitely worth trying.  Make sure you salt it enough or it could be bland.

Great squash recipe for a very picky household.  I cant say they dove in and asked for seconds but allmy very picky squash hating boys ate it and said it was good.  
I made a half recipe and baked it as directed in a 8" square pan - perfect.  Also topped with French fried onions to entice my boys - worked well.  I'll definitely make this recipe whe the next batch of garden squash is ready.

Okay, I'm new to this but tried this last night and both of us thought it was great!!!.  I think that the one thing I will do different is not saute the squash before hand but will be making this again.

OMG!!!!  This was an amazing dinner!  Even my children loved it!  I did alter it like a couple of previous raters wrote by adding lump crab and 1/2 part zucchini 3/4 part summer squash.  I used red onion for the onion and wheat Ritz crackers for the crackers and added some Emeril Essence, Seasoning salt and garlic powder to taste.  AMAZING!!!  I will make this again, and again and again!

Excellent.  Just because it's what I had on hand, I used club crackers rather than ritz.  Everyone loved it.  Also used combo of zucchini, yellow squash, patty pan squash, and white scallop squash...just because that is what I had growing in my garden.

I read the recipe online then went to the kitchen to make it - of course I forgot the directions, and I put milk in the crumb/cheese mixture. Ended up having a batter-like topping, but it was still wonderful - hubby flipped! I printed the recipe out so I can do it right next time :)

I give this recipe my highest high-five!! I modified the recipe just a tad by using Town house buttery light WHEAT crackers, adding ten extra, It gave the dish a slightly nutty flavor that was to die for! I also added just a bit more squash and seasoned my onions and squash in the fry pan. I did use a slightly smaller dish to cook this in, so it was a bit deeper.  I liked it so much, I let my babies (my little doggies) taste test as well. They acted like it was the best thing I'd EVER let them sample!! They're still licking their lips and so am I! Will make this again and again...

*I HATE squash*

But this was DELICIOUS!!!!  I even went back for seconds!  

I've had squash once in my life and my tongue attempted to run away.  My neighbor had too much in his garden and brought over some to share.  Oh joy, what am I going to do with this???  I found this recipe with such a high rating I decided to try it.

It is a little greasy, and I forgot to cook my onions when I boiled the squash.  They were slightly crunchy and I like them this way.  We did half the recipe, just in case I hated it.  I will DEFINITELY be cooking this again!

Again, I HATED squash...until I had this.

Awesome! Read the reviews and used a lot less butter and a little more squash and it was delicious. I used bread crumbs in place of cracker and just crushed  a few ritz for the top. Cook time was really about 40 minutes for me. Great recipe, definitely going in the book!

Really, I am super dissapointed in the rating here. This was not a good recipe at all and I love squash. It was edible, but not great. Basically you eat plain squash, and the aggs/crackers seperately because it does not stick together. Not a repeater for sure.

This recipe is the go-to "I have too much squash from the garden" recipe.   It truly is  much better with the bumpy  bright yellow homegrown crookneck sqash.  I fyou use storebought squash, add a couple teaspoons sugar to the squash to get a similar flavor.  I always add a couple  more squash to the recipe, usually cause I am trying to use up squash.  But sooo good when fresh and topping is crunchy.  Husband, who is a confirmed carnivore, says "Yay", when I serve this with a salad for dinner.

This dish was a hit with my family.  I will definitely make it again but will cut back on the butter next time.

The only difference I will make next time is to add a little more cheese.  My husband really likes cheese.  I thought it was good as is.

Yum!  I love the versatility of this recipe.  I used all low fat or fat free products (except the cheese, because I only had regular) and egg whites instead of whole eggs.  I also added a little garlic powder, just 'cause we like it, and zucchini fresh from my garden.  It turned out great!  Thanks for such an easy and tasty recipe.

This didn't work for me at all. I did half of the recipe in 8" square pan, followed everything exactly and just added a dash of nutmeg as another reviewer suggested. It looked like a greasy mess, squash was separating from the rest of the ingredients when serving. It just didn't go together at all. The dish was bland, I had to add almost twice as much salt at the table. To me this was just barely edible, my husband and son wouldn't eat it.

There is no suggestion on the slice thickness. Perhaps slicing thinner/thicker or even chopping would help, as well as adding more spice. But then it would be another recipe... Overall very disapointed.

I love this recipe, since it reminds me so much of the squash casserole my mom used to make for me.  The only thing I changed, to give it a little flavor boost, is I use 1/2 cup of cheddar cheese, and 1/2 cup of shredded velveeta cheese.  So yummy!

Made this for Thanksgiving and it was the hit of the party. Everyone loved it (or at least said they did). I even left off the extra two tbsp of butter that was called for. Def don't think it needed it. It was more than flavorful. I did add some oregano to the onions & squash while they were sauteeing, then added a little crushed red pepper. This added a great spice but wasn't too much. Will def make this again and again! For a lighter option, I'm considering using reduced fat Ritz crackers and maybe even cutting down the butter even more. Like I said, it's very flavorful.

I love squash casserole, but I'm picky about certain recipes.  This was good with a few alterations.  I used a whole chopped onion, added cayenne pepper, and a little bit more salt.  I also greased my pan with cooking spray and added additional cheese on top along with the remaining cracker mixture.  Overall great recipe.

This recipe is awesome, It is just like my husband's mom makes. I like to make it with saltines instead of butter crackers, and for an added kick, sometimes I will use jack cheese or a blend of both. It always comes out delicious!

I made it as written.  I did not read others readers suggestions because I wanted to taste it as is, and it was good.  The next time I make this, I will try it with a little sugar, and then after that I will try it with ingredients that other readers have suggested.

Amazing! I doubled it because my family is full of big eaters. Honestly I think a double service has about 8 servings. I was delicious. I took 3 pieces of bacon and cooked them in tiny pieces, per a precious review. It turned out great! Very good recipe!

This was a nice way to use the 2 medium sized summer squash we received in our Farmer's Market Basket this week! I really liked the cheesy crunchy topping. My son, who tends to be fairly picky about "new" things, ate his all up and said he really liked it! I used whole wheat ritz for the crackers and followed the ingredients/instructions.

I was not impressed by this dish. It came out soggy and the crispy topping people described was not crispy but mushy. I followed the recipe to the tee so I am not sure what happened. I am going to stick to my recipe for squash.

Loved this recipe..only changed a couple things. used garlic herb crackers instead of buttery round crackers and I used shredded squash instead of sliced.  Tasted great and the family loved it, too. Thanks for the recipe!

We got a huge yellow squash from some friends's garden and needed something to do with it.  We invited our neighbors over to try this recipe with us.  Everyone really enjoyed it - including my husband, who, like another reviewer's spouse, does not like squash.  He said that since that other husband enjoyed it, maybe he would, too, and decided to eat it with an open mind.  :)  Our neighbors enjoyed it tremendously and said it was a keeper.  I'm giving the recipe 4 stars, because while it was good, we didn't feel like it was something we'd necessarily crave and deliberately go out and buy squash for, but if we got another yellow squash from a friend, it would definitely get made again.  Thanks for the recipe!

Great recipe, the whole family loved it. I only had cheddar jack cheese so I used that, and added garlic to the mixture. It turned out delicious.

Add one chopped green bell pepper to the squash/onion while steeming; adds much flavor.  My wife and I loved it.  Added a green pepper, we think it might have been very blah without it.  Very good with it!

My family is not fond of onion so I substituted onion powder for the chopped onion. I used a mixture of swiss and cheddar cheese.  My whole family loved it. I will maked this again.  I think it would be excellent with zucchini as well.

I had two medium sized squash that I was hoping to get rid of so I just finished making and eating this recipe and it was delicious.  The only thing that put me off a bit was the onions but other than that I have no complaints.  Even my mother enjoyed it and she never likes to try new things!

My husband and I really liked this dish (he is already asking when I am going to make it again).  I am going to try to make it a little healthier next time (less butter, egg whites) and I may try italian bread crums and parmasan cheese instead of the crackers and cheddar.

I'm not a big squash fan, but this was fantastic!  I added a minced garlic clove, a pinch of nutmeg and some oregeno when sautauing the squash.  Everyone loved it.

I was looking for a way to use the squash from our garden and this was just what I was looking for. My husband doesn't like squash and he liked this! I followed the recipe exactly except I left out the onions. It was delicious! Thanks for sharing!

This did not turn out very well. I added a little extra salt since I had unsalted crackers, but it still seemed rather bland.

This was the easiest squash casserole I've ever made.  It was so good and I can't wait to have the leftovers today.  I'll definitely make this again and I can't wait to try it with bacon (I just read that in another review).  This recipe is a keeper.

I love squash and thought this would be a new and interesting way to serve it up. While it is different I can't say I liked it. Note though that my dislike wasn't all together because of a fault in the recipe but probably more just a personal taste thing. It had a distinctly eggy taste that I just couldn't get into...something like a slightly runny quiche.

I made this for Thanksgiving this year and got lots of compliments.  It's tasty and doesn't have canned soup like several others I've tried.  I assembled it the night before and baked it while the turkey was being carved.  Delicious.

It didn't turn out the way I expected it to, but it still tasted fine. I would have used a lot more squash than the recipe called for.

I absolutely love squash and this recipe is AWESOME! I especially love any recipe that taste good and can be made healthy. Most squash casseroles call for too much butter and cheese...can't keep my weight in-check with those.  I followed directions and will make over and over and over again! Thanks so much!!

I`m soooo disappointed. This casserole had no flavor at all & we were really excited to try it. We ended up having grilled cheese sandwiches because I couldnt get any of the 6 people in my house to eat this.

I had a bunch of squash from the garden and didn't know what to do with them. I tried this recipe due to the rating and reviews. It was delicious! I don't know how healthy it was, but it sure was hearty. I added bacon and garlic like some other reviewers suggested. I also used extra onion and more than four cups of squash- I didn't really measure, just used the five squash I had on hand.  We had two families over and everyone enjoyed it and had seconds. Thanks for the recipe!

Made once with yellow squash and then potatoes both delicious, but instead of milk I used evaporated milk and before adding the crackers I baked in the oven for 15 minutes and then added about 10-15 crackers.  It would have been to dry if I added more.

I had high hopes for this because I love squash.  And butter. And cheddar. For a whole lot of bad for you stuff though, this didn't taste all that special.  It was kind of bland actually.

This is a tasty casserole...it just needs a little tweaking. I cooked the squash on the stove just until it turned bright yellow, not until it was tender, and then proceeded with the recipe. I didn't have any round buttery crackers, so I used some leftover bagel chip crumbs I had lying around. I also added only 2 tbs. of butter to the filling, and completely omitted it in the topping. The casserole was very moist, and still greasy even with less butter. With these changes, the squash came out tender, but not mushy, and the the topping was crisp as well. Thanks for sharing, this is yummy!

We really enjoyed this dish! I followed the suggestion of a recent reviewer and cooked the onion and squash mixture with a little bacon (I used low fat turkey bacon). I'm not usually a big fan of yellow squash but enjoyed this dish very much. Even the kids liked it. I'll make it again. Thanks for sharing!

My husband and I love this recipe.  We tried it last year and he could not wait for his garden to grow this year so he could have some more casserole!  I double the amount of squash in the recipe and bake it for about 5 more minutes, a good use of our squash!

I had some yellow squash on hand, and not a whole lot else. I ended up adding  club house crackers and a few whole wheat crackers, and used minced garlic and dried onion, baby carrots, nutmeg, Frank's Red Hot sauce, and Bacos bits. This was a spur of the moment "I feel like cooking" recipe and it turned out well. It was a bit mushy, but I'm one of those people who dislikes really crunchy food, so it was perfect for me. I like how quick and versatile this recipe is, being a college student I don't have time to cook forever or go grocery shopping often, so I like that I could use whatever I have laying around to make a good meal.

Next time, I want to incorporate kale!  I added 1/2 tsp Sriracha to egg mixture.  Also, added 1/2 c. fresh basil, hatch chili powder, celery salt, 4 cloves minced garlic, and garlic powder.

It's a very versatile recipe. You can add your own flare.  It was so good, I passed the recipe on to my neighbor and she added green chiles for an extra kick.  I made it a second time with a little italian herb seasoning and it tasted like a whole other dish.

I made this with Thanksgiving dinner. It went over very well, not too many leftovers. I will make it again.

This was yummy. I added minced garlic,onion powder, crushed red pepper and cayenne pepper. I think next time I will experiment and try adding tomatoes,zucchini, shredded carrots. Maybe even pimentos or bacon. Who knows !the possibilities are endless. Thankyou Rosecart

This was pretty good.  It was easy enough so my kids could help cook their first squash from the garden.  We added extra crackers for more crunch...

I made the recipe once following all the directions. We loved it! We are making it again tonight but adding zucchini and turkey bacon. We are going to make it a little healthier with skim milk and 2% shredded cheese and a low fat cracker. Oh my! Hopefully it will still taste good!

This was great! Probably the best squash casserole I have ever had!  And my family devoured all in one day!! We always seem to have an over abundance of squash all at once so this was a great recipe to use it up!! I used a mixture of zucchini and yellow squash...I did not change a thing!! It was excellent just the way it states!! Thanx so much for sharing Rosecart!!

This is one of the better squash casseroles. I followed the recipe to a tee except used some zucchini and yellow fresh from our garden. Next time (and there will be a next time) I will cut down on the butter to make it a bit healthier. Thanks for a tasteful recipe indeed!

This was great I may have to eat the whole pan myself because my kids think any kind of casserole is gross and won't even taste it. I made it exactly as written and it turned out perfect. If you have more squash growing in the garden than you know what to do with try this its a good way to use some up.

Simple and very quick, and even my kids ate it so I can't complain! But it did have almost too strong of a butter and cheese flavor. I think both could be cut in 1/2 and it would be fine. I used the Vegetable flavored Ritz which probably added flavor.

Used organic squash from the garden and was pretty good. Nothing earth shattering but different yes. Its missing something. Next time might add bacon or tomato. Its just a tad bland honestly.

This recipe is so easy and sooo good. The only thing I change is to add a bit of garlic powder to the egg mixture and then I do half yellow squash and half zucchini to make it more colorful. Even my husband loves it and that's saying something! :)

My family loved this recipe. The only change I made was to saute the squash instead of boiling it to keep it from becoming mushy. Everyone who ate it swore they did not like squash bt kept coming back for seconds. My other substitution was bread crumbs instead of crackers. Other than that everything else was the same and fabulous!! I will definitely be makin this again.

I love this recipe!  Just make sure you don't over cook the squash before adding to the rest - it will be mushy.  Another great topper is crushed croutons - love the hint of garlic!  So good - simple summer food.

Really good casserole, I used wheat ritz crackers, and half zucchini for half of the yellow squash, it added some color. My only complaint is that next time I will use more crackers on top to make it a little crunchier.

This was devoured at my bar b que this weekend. I used  club house crackers, garlic, and 2 cups of sharp cheddar cheese, but other than those small changes kept it all the same.  One guest even told me it tasted better than his moms usual squash casserole. This is a must try recipe and will be used often.

I loved this dish!  I did make changes.  I sauteed the squash, onions and some broccoli  (added for more color and flavor) in olive oil with for a couple minutes first. (not very long so they wouldn't get soggy) Then I also added basil and parsley when I mixed everything together.  This is a definite keeper!

Very yummy! Great when needing to feed a crowd. I added a bit more pepper and salt to make the squash less bland. Using Ritz crackers worked out well!

I made this recipe for Thanksgiving and it was the star of the buffet. My mother-in-law is the QUEEN of cooking and she wanted this recipe.  She doesn't even like squash but now she is a big fan. She was bragging to the ladies at church about it and now they are all asking for the recipe.

Very, very good.  the only thing I would do a little differently is use a little less butter next time.  Other than that, it was absolutely delicious.

We love this casserole. I used a little more squash, seasoned with basil, pepper and garlic and added some pepperoni, which added some great flavors. So goooood.

We though this one was okay.  Mine seemed dry... not sure if that was the intent or not.  I was expecting a little more "sauce" in the dish.  I have another recipe, which the whole family preferred to this, but thanks so much for something different.

My husband and I both loved this recipe.  I just did a little tweeking of my own.  Instead of milk mixed with the egg I used fat free sourcream..then I used italian spices and put a bit of parmesan cheese on the top and it really browned and made a crusty top on the casserole.  This one is a winner for sure.  In my opinion it really does not need the pats of butter on the top before it goes in the oven.

This squash casserole was very tasty! It was very easy to cook as well. I did go ahead and drizzle melted butter over the crackers on top of the casserole (because I do all me casseroles that way!) This is definitely a recipe to add to your book! I will use it over and over again. 5 stars all the way!!

Excellent! Best I have ever tried. After reading all of the reviews, I made very few adjustments but not many. Mainly tried it as is. Great! However this recipe is wide open for trying different ways to tweak. Thanks!

I have always loved squash casseroles, however I had never tried to make one for myself. After trying this recipe I was BLOWN AWAY! Not only did it remind me of grandma's cooking, it was the fact that I made it. Much props to the cook!

I used no egg, no milk, did use low fat cheese and crackers.  Added some Mrs. Dash Table Blend, onion and garlic powder and I spread it on a cookie sheet.  We really liked it because it was crunchy and a good substitute for fried squash.  This recipe is my inspiration to try oven fried squash now.  Thank you for sharing.  Very yummy!

This was a great recipe that isn't overloaded with mayonnaise, cream, or anything of that sort.  I even used skim milk!  I probably could have added a little more salt - I just eyeballed what I thought looked like about 1/2 teaspoon.

I wanted to incorporate more flavor into the dish during the initial cooking stage so instead of cooking the squash and onions in water I sauteed them in a small amount of oil in a large nonstick skillet and added the salt and pepper to the pan. When it was tender-crisp I deglazed the pan with some white cooking wine and let that cook down until the squash started to caramelize slightly. After that I followed the recipe instructions to get everything mixed together, but instead of using a cake pan I used the bottom of a dutch oven. I also added freshly ground white pepper in addition to the black pepper. With those changes this recipe is definitely five stars. As is, it is definitely a good solid four star recipe, however.

Excellent!  This is my first year growing yellow squash, and I have been trying all kinds of different recipes just to keep up with the 2 squashes a day that my garden is producing!!  This is one of the better recipes I've tried - not too creamy - just delicious!

Delicious. I've searched a very long time for my idea of a perfect squash casserole and this is definitely it!!! I am a cheese lover, so I added a bit extra to suit my taste - also added extra crumbled Ritz crackers on top.

Ths will be a regular staple for Thanksgiving gatherings from now on. Even people who didn't normally go for squash seemed to enjoy it.

I tried to stick to the recipe as much as possible, but did make some changes--saltine crackers instead of buttery ones, soy milk instead of regular milk, and I used half an onion and four squash of various sizes (so didn't measure them). It turned out great, not too soupy or buttery as others suggested. I didn't feel it was too bland, but it would probably be okay to add extra spices to your taste. A good dish that I would make again.

We love this recipe! Our neighbors give us a lot of squash fresh out of their garden. I have three boys two out of three like it and one does not eat any vegetables! I increased the amount of squash, cheese and crackers (just randomly) and still turned out great, don't think you can mess it up. I use a smaller 9x11 pan and it is still crispy and yummy.

I had never made squash casserole before but I had a request for it for a family Christmas dinner. It was the first thing to go! I have frequent requests to make this again. Thanks for a yummy recipe.

This was the YUMMIEST! My husband and I ate almsot the entire dish....we had a bit to spare to share with the neighbors. I used instant stuffing mix instead of crackers and that gave it a unique flavor on the crust. I was also fortunate enough to have squash from my garden to use.....as soon as the others get ready, we'll make this again. And again, and again. GREAT JOB ROSALIE!!!

Being overrun with yellow squash from the garden, I used some of them up with this recipe.  Love the taste and texture of this dish!  I substituted green onions for the regular onions and lightly sauteed the squash and onions in olive oil instead of the water.  I used horseradish cheddar cheese which gave it a nice zip and I omitted the butter on top of the bread crumbs.  Next time I will use 5 cups of squash instead of four, as it seemed a bit thin in my 9x13 pan.  Delicious.

this is a wonderful recipe. I made it for the first time, and everyone wants the recipe. The only thing I done different was used sharp cheese. Since the squash is so bland. Wonderful recipe.

Great Reviews from family.  They said it tasted like macaroni and cheese.  I used cracker barrel extra sharp cheese and added an additional hand full of cheese on the top.  My family loved it.  I will definately make it again.

This was such a tasty dish! I've made it several times before I've actually posted a review.  You can actually leave out the butter and it's just as good.  A variation that I tried is using Cheez-It brand crackers(white chedder flavor), that worked out to give it a little more flavor! Just use 2 Cheez-It's in place of every one round cracker...yummm.

I served this to guests the first time I made it and was hesitant because I hadn't tried it first. It got great reviews and the very picky vegetarian that ate it loved it and asked for the recipe so that was a good test. I will serve this again.

I wanted a second vegetable dish for a dinner.  I found this recipe in my cookbook.  What a crowd pleaser!  Three of my guests were not squash eaters, but all went back for seconds.  It was easy to fix and I plan on using it again.  I may try using zucchini and the yellow.  Thanks for a great recipe.

The BEST squash casserole I have had to date!  I reduced the milk and butter a bit, because I like mine a bit drier - and cooked the squash and onion until they were mushy, to make more of a souffle.  Fab-U!

I make a similar squash casserole except I boil the suash and a whole onion until tender and drain and mash with a fork. I then add a 1/2 bag of cheddar or velveeta cheese, a 8oz carton of sour cream and a can of cream of chicken soup. I mix it all together, top with crackers and pour butter on top. SOOOOO good and everybody loves it!

This recipe was even enjoyed by my father-in-law, and he doesn't eat any veggies that aren't covered in lots of butter and cheese. I did make a few changes. First I pureed the squash and onions after steaming them.(It's easier to get my daughter to eat if she can't see what it is!) I also used egg beaters, and cut down the butter and cheese by half.

This recipe is a keeper.  The only change I made is I used American cheese instead of Cheddar.  Cheddar is too stringy and greasy for me.  I also had to use a smaller dish than instructed.  A 9x9 or something close to that works well. I have already added this to my recipe box and will make it on a regular basis.

I make this at least 3 times a month.  The leftovers (when there are any) heat well. I leave the squash quite big and chunky, so it doesn't get mushy when fully cooked.  Definitely an addition to our "family recipe" archive!

My grandmother use to make this and it was my favorite dish. Since I'm lactose  intolerant substituted the milk (Silk Plain) and cheese for soy milk and cheese. It really reminded me of my grandmothers and she uses real milk and cheese. I let my sister try it and she couldn't tell it wasn't real cheese.

The first time we made this it was phenomenal.  Since then, I can't seem to replicate the same yumminess.  The recipe makes a lot which is great.  I'll keep trying...we don't like yellow squash by itself, so this is a nice way to add squash into our diet.

This is just like Maw-maw used to make.  For people that think the squash is too soggy, don't steam it too much before making the casserole, make it al dente, for lack of a better word.  If you want the dish more sturdy, add another egg.  This casserole is nothing short of comfort food, and my Thanksgiving table will never be without it.

My husband and I LOVED this recipe and my children tolerated it -- not bad for a yellow vegetable!  I did make a few changes.  I used garlic salt in place of the salt, and I used Ritz Whole Wheat crackers.  Next time I may try less butter to make it a little healthier.  I think the crackers give it alot of butter flavor anyway.

Not as good as I'd hoped.  Most likely because I cubed the squash too big (1/2 inch squares) and they just didn't get tender enough (even though I sautaed for over 10 minutes.  The skin seemed dense and rubbery.  Will try again cutting in 1/4 inch cubes.

I don't know what possessed me at the farmer's stand to actually buy a yellow squash (not usually on my produce list).  After getting it home, and reality set in that now I had to do something with it, I came across this recipe.  Although my 6 and 8 year olds wouldn't touch it, my 4 year old (ironically my picky eater) and I thoroughly enjoyed it!  Very good - amazingly good considering that it's primary ingredient was (ugh!) squash.

I decided to do this as a vegetarian dish, except for the egg that I used. I used wheat crackers, rice cheddar cheese, and soy milk. I was HIGHLY impressed with the finished product!

My husband loved this. The kids and I- not so much. The topping was great! I sauteed the squash and onion first and it was mushy in the casserole. Since hubby liked it so much, I'll try again without sauteeing squash.

This is one of my all-time FAVORITE ways to eat squash (albeit, not the healthiest perhaps...).  I cook the squash/onion in the microwave w/ just a little water - simply because that's easier to me.  Otherwise, I don't change a thing.  GREAT recipe - I'll be making it for Turkey Day tomorrow!!

Delish.  My girlfriends made this at one of our "girls' nights."  We didn't worry about mixing in separate bowls...  One girlfriend has never liked squash - she had seconds, then surprised her husband and made it for him the next week!  A winner.

Very Good!  Nobody except me likes yellow squash in my family.  This receipe was a welcome addition.  Everybody loved it. They couldn't believe it was squash.  I have also made it with zucchini and squash.  Super simple and extremely tasty.  Thanks!

Amazing! Unbelievable good!  Terrible for you, I'm sure, with all the butter (and I added cream) but so, so good! I've made this several times.  It works well as a side dish and as the main dish.

I also thought this was a little bland.  I was looking for a new and different way to make squash in hopes that my kids would miraculously begin to like it but even I wasn't that impressed.

This was very good Rosalie. The thought of putting the crackers into the squash didn't appeal to me, so I reserved them for the topping. I did, however, add the cheese to the mix. After the casserole was baked, I placed it under the broiler to brown the buttered crackers I made. So good and thanks!

I thought this dish was incredibly bland. I love squash and I didn't even want to eat it, it wasn't bad, but it wasn't worth the calories. Sorry.

So much squash, so little time. As others, I have mega amounts of yellow and zucchini squash growing in the garden. Was looking for something comforting, instead of the "grilled" "chopped" sorta recipe. 
This was it! I used saltines, (even before reading the reviews) and they turned out great. I added minced garlic, provolone, sharp chedder, swiss, (this is all I had for cheese) and some celery seed. 
Thank you, this is a recipe that will be made over and over, just for comfort sake.

This is awesome. I have looked everywhere for a recipe that tastes just like my grandmother's. This is it. I added a little sour cream to mine. I also used plain saltines. Which my grandmother used. Very, very tasty. Thanks for the recipe.

This is such a tasty comfort dish that is great during the fall.  I use Colby cheese instead when I make this.  I also add artichoke hearts for a kick sometimes

Very good and easy! I didn't have crackers, so I substituted some jalapeno cornbread croutons that I had on hand..YUMMY! I also just threw all the ingredients together into a bowl all at once and then transferred to a baking dish. Eliminated some steps...still turned out fine.

I really liked this recipe. I was actually looking for a casserole like that of Black Eyed Pea. I didn't have enough Ritz crackers. So, I added some plain bread crumbs. I also added a teaspoon or so of sugar since I didn't have all of the crackers the original recipe required.

I knew from the number of reviews that this must be a winner, and it was excellent!  I only had enough squash to make half the recipe, so I used an 8 inch square baking dish and baked it for about 18 to 20 minutes instead of the originial 25.  I also added a bit of oregano to the ingredients for a kick; next time I might try dill or chives.  My husband and I both loved it.  I'm so pleased!

This was a big hit with my crew.  I doubled the squash and used wheat crackers but followed the recipe exactly otherwise.  My husband said it reminded him of his grandmother's country cookin', which is a huge compliment.

Pretty good but not fantastic.  May make again for a potluck or bbq.  Others liked it (it went pretty quickly) but my husband and kids didn't care for it much.

This is a great dish, I got many good comments on it when I took it to a gathering at my daughters home. I'll be making it again soon. Thanks for the great recipe.

I just made this casserole and ate a bowl, and it was absolutly delicious.  I did find that when cooked for the 25 minutes suggested, it was custardy and watery, so I put it back in for another 15 minutes,to make sure the egg was done and set.  I ended up cooking it for one hour,uncovered, it did not burn,was not the least bit dry, crispy, or overdone at all.  It was perfect. I also mixed all the crackers in with the squash, and topped it with a little extra cheese.  For the cheese I used the  new SARGENTO BISTRO BLENDS, MOZERELLA AND SUN DRIED TOMATO it was wonderful, it added extra flavor and flair! I didn't measure my squash, just used what I had, about 2 pounds.  It worked perfectly with the meaurements originally given.  I definately recommend the recipe to everyone, it is superb.  Also, for a richer version, use swiss gureyere-YUMMY! Thanks for the recipe!!!

This was so delicious!  I made this for Easter dinner and someone who doesn't like squash got a helping.  They figured it out, but it didn't matter, because they even loved it!

This recipe was a cinch to make. This is a traditional southern favorite, so I have tried a lot of different versions of this recipe and this one is by far the best. My family raved! This one will become a regular in my menu cycle.

This is an excellent recipe for squash! To tell you the truth, I really didn't care too much for squash until I tried this recipe tonight. I did try it once where it prepared very sweetly, but this was even better! I will definitely keep this recipe to make over, and over, again.

flavor was good with the addition of a few sauteed shallots, chives and a good Spanish goats milk cheese instead of the cheddar. An easy way to use up the last of the summer squash.

We love this recipe.  The only thing I do differently is when sauteeing squash/onions is that I add a few sprinkles of cajun seasoning - Tony Cachere's is my favorite, but Zatarain's or others will do. Careful not to use too much - seasoning has salt in it....

We enjoyed this as a main dish for a change of pace.  Was great for using up an abundance of yellow squash I had, plus it tastes great served with a green salad and bread sticks.  I added garlic and fresh, chopped anaheim green chilies to the vegetables.

I use both yellow squash and zucchini to this casserole. I don't think it's spectacular, but everyone who has it loves it.

This was really excellent! Unlike other reviews I didn't have a problem with it being soggy. Everyone really enjoyed it even those who weren't crazy about squash.

This was an OK recipe but not the best squash recipe I have had.  It seemed to be missing something but I could not figure it out.

Thank you for sharing this recipe. I bought a ton of squash from the store and I didn't know what to do with it. I found this recipe and I thought that I'd serve it as a main course for dinner. My husband does not eat meat (other than fish), so, this was great for us. He said that this dish was tasty and would like me to make it again. My 11 month old liked it too. THANKS!

I started baking this casserole at a lower temp because I had something else in the oven but then increased to 400 later -- took a little longer than 25 minutes, of course, but still turned out beautifully.  A delicious way to eat squash!

Recipe was missing the sour cream and cream of chicken soup to add flavor.  You will like this recipe if you REALLY like the taste of yellow squash.  I am going to try the Squash Casserole recipe from Gayle Cox tonight.

My husband seemed to enjoy this but I thought it was too "shmooshy."  I did use zucchini instead of yellow squash.  Maybe it would be better with one egg instead of 2.

People who think they dislike squash will never be the same after trying this. This dish always receives compliments and most importantly - requests for copies of the recipe.

M M good.. yummy, even the friends who came for dinner who forgot to mention the fact that they didn't like squash, nicely tried it for my sake and liked it! NOT BAD! I'd eat it again! I think that says a lot!
Thanks!

I over-did the topping the first time I made this.  The next time, I didn't make the top so thick and it was outstanding.  I have been asked to make it for Christmas Eve dinner!

Much to my surprise, squash doesn't exist in this area of France so I had to substitute the squash with something like a pumpkin that tastes like chestnuts?? However it turned out great and everyone loved it but I'm sure that it tastes even better with real squash - going home to Canada for Christmas and will try again..

wow!  what a hit at my house this week!  i made this while fighting on the phone with my brother and when i was 9 months pregnant (so it was very easy).  i didn't really measure anything, just threw it all together, and it sort of overshadowed my husband's bbq chicken!  it was wonderful and will be made again.

Excellent side dish.  I used butternut squash instead. The squash and onions took more like 10 minutes to become tender. It was as sweet as could be.  I also omitted the 2 tablespoons of butter on the top of the casserole and it still baked golden after I removed the foil cover the last 10 minutes of cooking.

The topping makes it. It was a little bland but it may have been because I forgot to drain the water. I WILL make this again, and drain it next time. Thanks for the recipe!!

Very tasty. I put in half yellow squash and half zucchini, still very good! The crunchy topping makes it.

My husband really LOVED this recipe.  It tasted even better the second day.  I guess the flavor had a chance to settle. I thought it was a tad bit "eggy".  I'm going to try it with one egg instead of two.
