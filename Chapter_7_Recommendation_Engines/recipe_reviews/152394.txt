I followed this recipe exactly which is a rarity for me. My very picky husband, 8 year old son, and 2 year old daughter all enjoyed it. 
The flavor was amazing..rich and creamy.
Will definitely be making this again!

Easy, especially if you buy already peeled squash. Nice and creamy, even though I used whole milk instead of whipping cream. Didn't feel like croutons, so instead I topped with a dollop of plain yogurt and a sprinkle of pomegranate seeds. Looked pretty and added a nice contrast in taste and texture.

I followed the recipe to the T except for adding the chicken broth until it reached the texture I wanted which turned out to be 3 cups.  This is a really full-bodied soup, and the croutons add another layer of flavor.  Please, don't skip the croutons, as they really are what sets this soup apart from others...they are worth the effort to make!  The Hidden Valley Ranch dressing on the croutons softens and melts into the soup giving you even more depth of flavor.  Just really delicious.

This soup was excellent, my family and I loved it!  I will be making this again very soon and I'm excited to make slight variations to see how they work out.  I think that I'm going to try adding some pumpkin to the puree next time.  I wonder how some mulled apple cider would blend in with the other flavors if I used it in the stock.

Not too bad to me and daughter (who's usually quite picky).  Husband hated it.  Only ate 2 bites.  Felt like he was eating baby food and turned off by texture.

I thought it was really alright and would be good on a cold winter evening.  Croutons were definitely a plus.

MMmm tasty.  I didn't feel like making the croutons, and the soup was fine by itself with some bread.  I'll try them for next time though.

I followed this recipe almost exactly.  I tend to like my soup a little thicker so I put in less chicken broth.  Other then that it was delish.  The croutons where the best I have had.

Fantastic soup, but you definately need the croutons to give it the best flavor.

I used some cider for liquid and skipped the apples. Delicious - especially with sour cream as garnish.

This was great soup! Perfect for the season.  I bought cubed butternut squash at Costco(yay for me!).  I substituted almond milk for the cream--can't stand the xtra calories and fat.  Very deicious.  I'll make this again and again.
