These are a good variation on the classic macaroon recipe, and are quick and easy to make.  I added chocolate chips to mine and they were delicious.  They are not as chewy as other recipes (I noticed there were no eggs in this recipe), but they're still very good.

These are DELICIOUS and super easy. I would note, though, to omit the Almond Extract. The coconut is so yummy it does not need that almond taste and they turn out tastier without it!

A very good and a VERY easy recipe.  However, the first batch I made stuck to the foil.  The second batch put in mini muffin cups and baked--turned out much better!

These tasted very good, but had nothing but trouble removing them from the greased and floured foil. Has anyone tried these on parchment or a non stick sheet?

These were okay but not a hit at my house.  I'm still looking for that perfect macaroon recipe and this just wasn't it.  They did look pretty though because I sprinkled green sugar on top of them.

parchment paper saved the day!! 
Just spray the paper and the cookies come off with ease. Also I used one egg white in theis recipe.
