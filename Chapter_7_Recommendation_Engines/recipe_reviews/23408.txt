This cheesecake has been our dessert for the past three Thanksgiving dinners!  Like others, I also use ground pecans in place of the hazelnuts, but I also find that a spicy gingersnap makes for a better crust.  (Try Christie's Midget Snaps)  This also makes great idividual cheesecakes....just place a ginger snap in the bottom of a muffin tin lined with a paper liner and pour on the filling!

This was amazing.  Thanks Shelley!
Here are some changes I made that you may want to try out readers....
*I used pecans instead of hazelnuts (because I wanted them to compliment the praline garnish I used. 
*I baked the cheesecake in a water bath to avoid cracking.  
*I made my praline with pecans.  After the sugar/water mixture came to a med./ dark caramel color when boiling, I then spread the pecans on a buttered surface until they hardened.  Spread so they don't touch. Set aside enough cute shiny whole pecans for a garnish for each piece. Chop up the rest for your praline garnish.
*  I made fresh whipped cream with vanilla bean, vanilla & sugar.
* Presentation:  take your slice of pumpkin cheesecake, put a large dollop of the vanilla bean whipped cream (letting is slide down each side of the cheesecake slice).  Sprinkle 1-2 TB of the pecan praline on top of the whipped cream and sides of serving plate.  Finally on top of the dollop add one shiny whole praline coated pecan.  Enjoy!

Well, not really sure how to rate this. Overall it was pretty tasty, but I wish the baking directions were a bit more detailed. For one, the crust hieght listed before baking should be about an inch shorter. The crust rises so high that when you cool the cake, the walls stay high and the middle sinks creating a crator like shape (not attractive). Secondly you should probably take the cake out about a half hour sooner than listed. When you leave it out to cool it continues to cook. Mine came out a bit over cooked. Good luck!

I made this cheesecake for christmas and it was awesome!  Everyone loved it!  And, it was my first cheesecake that did not crack (my 3rd attempt).  If yours have a tendency to crack, try cooking for a shorter amount of time, then turn off the oven and leave the cake in there for about an hour--it will continue to cook, but not at the high heat, resulting in less (or no!) cracks.

This cheesecake is very  good. It is smooth and creamy, however, i was hoping for a NY style cheesecake consistancy and this  cake was a little soft for that. I followed the directions but did end up adding some additional spices. I added cloves, nutmeg and extra cinnamon. I think my extra spices made a big difference as the flavor was WONDERFUL!! I enjoyed the gingersnap crust but i had to use pecans because i didnt have any hazelnuts. YUM! I baked it in a water bath and i think it helped keep it from cracking. I would recommend this cake if you like softer cheesecakes with very mild spices.

I read in the allrecipes cheesecake hints that cheesecakes should be baked in a water bath, so that's what I did for this one. Unfortunately, i didn't wrap the pan tightly enough with tinfoil and the cheesecake got a little wet, but it was still fabulous! I will keep this recipe, but next time I will put my pan in a trimmed down turkey cooking oven bag to be sure there are no leaks.

This is a great Thanksgiving recipe. My family always has me bring the chhesecake and this one was a hit. A little tip though. make sure to pat the pumkin dry between some papertowels. If you do that you shouldn't have any trouble with the cheesecake being too soft.

I did what someone else had said they had done before, & substituted a mix of pecans and walnuts in place of the hazelnuts in the crust.  Also added a little more cinnamon and a little less allspice.  This was delicious!

I made this several years ago and had lost the recipe. Everyone was asking last year if I could bring it to Thanksgiving again! I am so glad I found it! I did make a few changes. Instead of hazelnuts I used pecans. You may also drizzle store bought carmel sauce over the top. Goes very well with the pumpkin.

I used the recipe to make mini cheesecakes, as another reviewer suggested.  I used ginger snaps in the bottom of lined muffin cups and filled with batter.  Baked at 325 for about 20 minutes.  Made 28 cheesecakes.

very good cheesecake.... but definetly don't use 6 Tbs of butter in the crust. Way too much, and all it does is spill out the sides and into your oven, or pan below (if you thought to put one there) I would just use 2 or 3 Tbs next time.

I've made this recipe twice. Once as written, and the second time modified into individual cheesecakes. First time it was wonderful--and the individual cheesecakes went over great as well. For individual-sized cheesecakes, just spray muffin/cupcake liners with baker's joy spray (or equivalent), and axed the maple syrup and hazelnuts from the recipe. Halved it... and ended up with 12 perfect mini cheesecakes. (A trip into the freezer is a must before removing the cheesecakes from the liners). Posted a picture. Great recipe!

I give it five stars because it's good on it's own but with my changes it's AWESOME!  I didn't use nuts in the crust because of family nut allergies.  2 cups crumbs to help make the crust crustier.  1.5 CANS of pumpkin.  Double cinnamon and allspice and add nutmeg to taste.  I cook it on a cookie sheet because the butter tends to drip out of the spring form pan and make a giant mess in my oven.  Thanks for this great recipe.  It made me a lot of friends at work too :)

Wonderful pumpkin cheesecake recipe. I made this last year for thanksgiving and everyone devoured it and rated it 2 thumbs up, plus. So this year, I will be making it again. I don't use the hazelnuts but just add more gingersnaps and a bit of graham crackers. Everything else I follow to a T. Also, the key to a crack free top is to avoid overbeating the mix. Watch your oven temp and bring the cheesecake out a bit earlier then listed in the recipe. Cheesecake will keep cooking after the oven is off and will firm up as it cools. Yumm!

4.5 stars.  The crust gets soggy even though I used only 4 T butter as some reviewers suggested.  I think I'll make my standard graham cracker crust next time.  This cake gets better as the days go by, even though I prepared it on Tuesday for Thanksgiving, I would suggest making it at least three days ahead for more intense cheese flavor.  I have baked maybe half a dozen cheesecakes in my life and I've always had cracking problems, even tjough I used the cool down gradually/wooden spoon handle method.  When I was 20, I baked a cake in a water bath and it leaked into the pan and I've always been frightened of using a water bath again.  Well, this time I tried a water bath and used a tip from a reviewer--use the 18" wide aluminium foil (don't skimp and get the cheap kind--get the heavy duty Reynold's) and the cheese cake was perfect.  Looked beautiful, no cracking.  I cooked it on 325 F for 90 min, then 60 min with the door cracked open and the oven off.  Grease the sides of the pan well so it won't stick to the sides when it expands and contracts and crack the edges.  There's a great video on this site that explains cheesecakes in a H2o bath.

AMAZING. This is the BEST cheesecake I have ever made, and I have made many. I did increase the spices (mostly cinnamon and a little ginger) and added some pumpkin spice mix as well. I used a water bath, which resulted in a perfect, crack-free surface. For the topping I whipped cream with a tsp vanilla, a tsp sugar, a tbsp vanilla pudding powder (to help it set better) and a squirt of maple syrup. I put this all over the cake like a frosting and then sifted cinnamon/sugar through a heart cut-out to make a heart pattern on top. It turned out better than I expected! 

Also served on top a drizzle of a maple bourbon caramel sauce: 1/2 c butter, 2 tbsp maple syrup, 1 c brown sugar, splash bourbon and 1/2 c cream, all brought to a boil and then allowed to sit until room temp. Fabulous. Wish I'd taken a picture. Usually my desserts are not very photogenic, but this one turned out great.

Everyone at the Thanksgiving reunion said this was the best cheesecake they had ever eaten!  It is a new tradition!  I only modified the recipe by adding pecans to the crust and a little extra cinnamon to the cake.  I also made my own cinnamon whipped cream to top off this yummy cake.  This cake does leak.  I wrapped my pan in aluminum foil before baking, and I'm sure glad I did!  Also, the cake cracks even when heated with water in the oven.  Make sure you have some whipped cream on hand to cover the crack!  Otherwise, this is a smooth, delicious, light cheesecake.  Enjoy!

I omitted all nuts from the crust and it still turned out great! The pumpkin filling was nice, but next time I want to use pumpkin pie filling instead of pure pumpkin for more flavour.

This was by far the most sumptious cheesecake I have ever made! We are a gluten free family so I used Midal's GF gingersnap cookies and almond flour for the crust. As for the cheesecake part I forgot to buy heavy cream and allspice, so I used half & half and extra cinnamon. I read  Peggy Faulk Ellender's tips on how she bakes cheesecakes from this site and she is right. Not one single crack and my cheesecake was a good 3" thick! Unbelieveable. I also used an extra pie plate with water in it on a lower rack for my 'water bath'. As for taste this cheesecake is not overly rich, it's easy to eat a full piece and enjoy it without it being too much. I will definately make this again.

Made this as the dessert for Christmas dinner.  One of my guests was allergic to nuts, so just used extra cookie crumbs which was fine for the initial serving...but got a little soggy for leftovers.  I also adjusted the spices to taste.  I used 1 tsp cinnamon and 1/2 a teaspoon of both ginger and cloves.  Very yummy!

this recipe was very simple & easy to make. i served it for dessert after xmas dinner, and the family loved it! i used the full amount of butter, and like others said, quite a bit baked out (place your cheesecake on a pizza or cookie sheet in the oven, and the pan will catch the melted butter). the dry ingredients in the crust do need the full amount of butter to mold properly to the bottom & sides of the pan. i used 2 packages of full-fat cream cheese & 1 package of fat-free, and it was delicious & creamy.  make sure to let the cheesecake cool at room temp for the full 30 minutes (longer if you can) before putting it in the fridge. it will allow the cheesecake to settle slowly & prevent cracking. i will definitely be making this again!

This recipe was honestly amazing. It turned out great and I didn't want to share it with anyone. I don't think I changed anything except for the heavy cream, I didn't have any so I think I used condensed milk. Can't really remember but it was SO GOOD, and I got many compliments on it as well. Thank you for this recipe!!

A big hit this Christmas.  Beautiful recipe.  If you are having trouble with cracks wrap your spring form in tin foil and bake in a shallow water bath.  Remember- when using a water bath always start with hot water!

I used the water bath,my cheesecake did not crack,it came out beautiful. The crust was so soggy a couple days after,too greasy. I cut down the butter after reviews,so I guess it needs to cut down more and use more gingersnaps. Why grease when there is so much grease already

I made this with my 9-year-old daughter for Thanksgiving and it was a big hit! It was our first cheesecake. Two things to remember: You might want to use a blender or food processer to crumble the ginger snaps and nuts (we were silly enough to try with our fingers at first!). Also, you might want to add more nuts and ginger snaps than the recipe calls for so you have enough to spread two inches up the sides. Be aware -- the top of the cheesecake may crack a little once it comes out of the oven, but it still tastes terrific!

I just love this cheesecake. Surprsingly easy to put together. Used the cheesecake tips found on this site. Really does make a difference to have ingredients at room temperature, use a water bath, and don't overbeat. Just delish! Make sure your spices are fresh and buy high quality ingredients. They don't cost that much more and makes a real difference in the finished product. Don't even think about using imitation vanilla!

Made this for Christmas dinner at my son's home.  It was delicious and it all went.  I received rave reviews. It was easy to make and I baked it in a water bath.  The only problem was the Ginger Snaps.  They were so fresh that they were hard.  I tried the food processor for crushing, this did not work.  I had to resort to placing them in a kitchen towel and using a hammer to crush them.  Otherwise, the recipe was great!  Thanks Shelley for a great recipe.

The best cheesecake ever! I did 50/50 ginger snap cookies and honey grahams, and added pecan crumbs to crust. And used sour cream instead of heavy cream. Saved 1/4 of the pumpkin and added 1 cup sour cream, 1/2 cup brown sugar, and 1/2 cube cream cheese for topping. Bake again for 15 minutes.

I made this in cupcake papers.  It was perfect for a party! I followed the recipe, but after baking and cooling I topped each cheesecake with chocolate cinnamon ganache. I also made some spiced pumpkin seeds, and put 2-3 on top of each mini-cheesecake for garnish.  They looked beautiful! I wish I had taken a picture.

This is the first cheesecake I have ever made, and I learned a lot from the process. These are the changes I would make: 1. Use less butter, pecans, brown sugar, more gingersnap cookies in crust (crust was greasy). 2. Cook for one hour, then turn oven off for final 30 min (my cheesecake seemed overcooked and cracked). 3. Cool at room temperature for 1 hr, then move to refrig. 4. Add about 1 teaspoon nutmeg to batter. I am anxious to try this one again! Great taste, even though it didn't look so pretty.

This is wonderful, plenty of spices in it as written.  Next time, though, I will use less butter in the crust as it got a little greasy.  I also used a water bath and let it cool in the oven for an hour before the refrigerator.  Great recipe!

Holy cow! I completely forgot the eggs, but it's still delicious! Was heavier handed with the spices, and used International Delights Cinnamon Hazelnut coffee cream instead of the heavy cream. I can't believe I forgot to add the eggs... but it's still delicious! Love the crust!

I made this for a dessert party and it was the favorite!  I left out the hazelnuts and replaced with more gingersnap crumbs instead.  I also garnished with whipping cream with a little sugar and cinnamon and piped it around the top.  Fabulous!   If you've never made a cheesecake before, make this your first.

not only is this just about the best darn thing i've ever made, but it's really easy as far as cheesecakes go.  i added 4-5 times the amount of cinnamon and allspice called for and had to use crushed pecans instead of hazelnuts.  my friends liked it so much i have been asked to make 2 for 2 different families' thanksgiving dinners.  absolutely fabulous!

I received several requests for making this a part of our family Thanksgiving every year! All spices & vanilla were doubled plus an addition of 1/8 tsp ground cloves and 1/8 tsp nutmeg. With these modifications the recipe is perfectly flavored and deserves a 5 star rating. As written, it is a little bland.

Well, the crust was absolutely delicious! Substituted pecans for the hazelnuts, threw those and the gingersnaps in the food processor, and it turned out perfect. I also sprinkled extra crust bits on the top--fantastic!

Wonderful cheese cake, but gingersnaps are rock hard.  I really thought it might break my food processor.  Also, I wasn't able to find hazelnuts.  I used pecans instead.  Result was A+.

I actually only used the crust portion of this recipe for another pumpkin cheesecake.the crust was delicious, even without the nuts. One change I would make is to halve the butter,there was way too much and it oozed out of the bottom of the pan while cooking. If I hadn't had my pan wrapped in foil in a water bath, the butter would have been all over my oven!

This came out great! I forgot to pick up the gingersnap cookies, so I used graham crackers and seasoned them with 1 tsp cinnamon, 1 tsp ginger, 1/2 tsp cloves and 1/2 tsp nutmeg.  I used what I had on hand: pecans for the hazelnuts, two packages of regular cream cheese, one reduced fat and half & half for the cream.  I also used half vanilla and half maple flavoring, and a good Grade B maple syrup.  I rushed things cooling it so I ended up with a big crack - I made Maple Pecan Glaze (since I subbed pecans in the crust)from one of the other recipes here and served that on top.  All in all, FABULOUS! Great flavor and texture, raves reviews.  I have used gingersnap crusts in the past and like them, however the seasoned graham cracker was even better, I think.  A bit more subtle flavor, but still recognizable as "gingersnap" - I think I'll do that again next time I do a pumpkin cheesecake!

Very good recipe! I decided to do this instead of pumpkin pie and my regular plain cheesecake. I've tried and failed with pumpkin cheesecake in the past but this one came out great! The only change I will make the next time is to mix some graham cracker crumbs into the gingersnap crumbs. The gingersnaps seem to carmelize a bit in the baking process. This may, of course, have been caused by too much butter.  In any event, I topped it with fresh whipped cream sprinkled with pumpkin pie spice. Very pretty and very delicious!

This was my first cheesecake that I have ever made. It was so simple and YUMMY!  I shared it with my co-workers and everyone raved and requested their own copy to make for the holidays!  Thanks also to the tips on this site on making cheesecakes!  Those tips helped to ensure it came out perfectly!!

I didn't have any hazelnuts so I used walnuts instead.  The gingersnaps really make this an interesting cheesecake.  It's a wondeful fall treat.

I love this recipe! I love the subtle pumpkin taste, but decided to go with graham cracker crust instead of gingersnap. I made this recipe last Thanksgiving and used honey instead of maple syrup as I didn't have any. It was great! So this year, I'm trying to cut some calories out and am experimenting with the recipe. I made the following changes: 2 pkgs of 1/3 less fat cream cheese and 1 pkg non fat, 3 eggs instead of 4 and 1 tsp. cinnamon instead of 3/4 tsp. as I was out of allspice. Also threw in 1 tsp. cinnamon to the graham cracker crust, as I was mixing it up. The result was a light creamy pumpkin cheesecake. It firmed up nicely overnight, and now have less than half sitting in the fridge only 12 hours after it was originally made. Three people did that damage, FYI. It has been requested at this year's Thanksgiving dinner as a prerequisite for attendence.

Please note that the addition of pumpkin and cream allow for this cheesecake to be lighter, and even when one is using regular cream cheese it will not be as densed as regular New York Cheesecake, IMHO.

This cheesecake is delicious!  I'm not a big pumpkin fan, but this is so good!  I made it for a work party and EVERYONE asked for the recipe.  I used both the pumpkin pie mix and the spices.  I substituted pecans for the hazlenuts.  Also, for the topping, I piped French Vanilla Cool-Whip over the whole thing, crumbled up gingersnaps, and drizzled with caramel.  It was beautiful!  No one could believe I made it!  Definitely give this one a try - you won't be disappointed!

Excellent recipe...
It can be turned into a "diabetic friendly" recipe also!
Replace the ginger snaps with low-cal cookies and add a tsp. of ground ginger.
Replace the sugar with fructose or sweetener (remember to reduce the amount, as fructose and sweeteners have a higher sweetening effect)Instead of maple syrup, add a tsp. of maple flavouring.

I made this recipe as an alternative to pumpkin pie for a family gathering.  It was excellent!  
I did use heaping teaspoonfuls of the cinnamon and allspice.  Per other reader's suggestions, I also cut down on the amount of butter in the crust to avoid any greasiness.  Also, I think because I cut down on the amount of butter, my crust did not stick 2 inches up the side of the pan as instructed in the recipe.  It ended up only being on the bottom.  I would suggest trying to get the gingersnap and hazelnut mixture into a really, really fine grain.  Mine was a bit crunchy!
I also used a water bath.  Baked it for about 1hr15m.  Then let it sit for about 1/2 hour in the pan, outside of the oven, to cool.

I had never made a cheesecake before, and this one turned out wonderful! I replace half of the cream cheese with reduced fat and the other with fat free. Never missed the flavor. I even brought it to work and they didnt believe me when i told them. Thanks!!

The filling was good but I found that the crust was very greasy and cooked alot faster than the inside. I probably wouldn't make this again but if I did I would use my own crust recipe.

This was a big hit! I used pecans instead of hazelnuts and made a Maple Pecan Glaze for a topping. In medium size saucepan, combine 1 cup (1/2 pint) whipping cream and 3/4 cup of pure maple syrup; bring to a boil. Boil rapidly 15-20 min. or until slightly thickened; stir occ. Stir in 1/2 cup chopped pecans. Cover and chill. Stir before serving. This is good over ice cream, too.

YUM!  I made this for Christmas, it was very good.  I left the nuts out of the crust,(because my kids won't eat them) and it was still good.  It makes more than 8 servings, very rich.  I had to bake longer than 90 minutes to get the middle to set up.  I used the pan of water under the cheesecake as was suggested elsewhere in All receipes, and had no problem with cracked top.  It was pretty and yummy!

Very good! I did subsitute pecans for hazelnuts, which completely hid that gingersnap taste rather than compliment. I will stick to the recipe next time!

This is a perfect recipe.  One of the best things I've ever eaten!  I added a tablespoon of grated, fresh ginger to the cheesecake mixture, which works if you're cooking for those who love ginger :)

This cheesecake was a big hit at our family Thanksgiving.  I agree with other reviews that there is too much butter in the crust.  I forgot to put a pan under it when it baked and all the butter dripped onto the bottom of the oven.  So, If you are going to use all the butter, then put a pan underneith to catch the drips.  I also made a pumpkin spiced whipped cream to go with it, that was really good!

This was my second time making a cheese cake, and i wanted to do something different so i made this one for thanksgiving. It turned out so good! I used a water bath to cook it and it came out with a delicious creamy cheese cake texture. Everyone loved it and i am now requested to bring it to family get to gethers! the recipe was easy to follow... it may seem a little over whelming if this is your first time making a cheese cake though!

Quite tasty!  I baked in a waterbath and substituted pecans for the hazelnuts following suggestions in the reviews.
NOTE:  I crushed my gingersnaps in a ziplock bag using a rolling pin --- worked great!

I followed the recipe and am an experienced scratch baker.  Even with some added nutmeg and extra cinnamon this was bland.  The crust needed to be pre seasoned to be crisp.  Not impressed nor were any who tried it.  It was much better after sitting in the fridge overnight.  When I served it 4 hours out of the oven it was mushy.

I have made this 3 years in a row for my BF's bday - he asks for it all the time!  The only change I've made is adding a sour cream topping and the only reason I added that is because I tend to get cracks in my cheesecakes.

Made this for Thanksgiving and it was a big hit. Followed directions as is, no changes. The butter did drip out of the pan, so I would reduce the amount of butter in the crust next time.

Great recipe.  I modified the amounts to make mini cheesecakes and it turned out great.  I also left out the hazelnuts since I do not really like the flavor.  I topped the mini cheesecakes with Bourbon Whipped Cream recipe I found on this site, and a store bought caramel sauce. The flavors of the gingersnap crust, the pumpkin and the whipped cream complemented each  other very nicely.  All my guests loved the cheesecake!  I already have requests to make this for Thanksgiving this year!

I really liked this cheesecake... I saw in other reviews people talking about the center of the cheesecake dropping and forming a crater. Mine also did this but I took advantage of this and filled the top with homemade whip cream. Sprinkled with a little cinnamon. Now the cheesecake both looked and tasted great!!!  PS. Dont forget to put either a cookie sheet or foil below your springe form pan... this cheese cake drips... found out the hard way...Cleaning my oven now...

I've made this twice.  Once as directed and once in a mini muffin tray.  Both times it got rave reviews.  I substituted regular syrup for maple since I didn't have maple.  I would also recommend less butter in the crust.  Both times I made mine, much of the butter ended up seeping out of the springform while baking.

Good recipe.  I made it just as written and I didn't experience any of the troubles others reported, such as the crust being too high.   If your cheesecake sinks, you're doing something wrong.  Mine came out perfectly flat on top.  I used the water bath, and no cracks.    If your water bath is leaking, it's not because you didn't wrap the foil tight enough.  It's because you used small foil.  Get the large roll (18" wide) and tear off a big hunk, you'll have no problem, and it's cheaper than buying a turkey bag.   Do heat the bath water up first, and be sure to check the water level during baking, top up as needed with more hot water.   I had a little cheesecake mix left over so I tried making a couple cupcakes as some suggested, putting a gingersnap on the bottom of the cup and covering with the "batter".  Didn't work out at all.   Ugly, wrinkled and didn't taste very good.

If I could give this recipe 6 stars, I would!  Omg, this was fabulous.  I have to say that I didn't take the time to get gingersnaps or nuts, so I made my own graham cracker crust.  Even with that change, the cheesecake was great.  Everyone who ate it was blown away and I will SURELY make this again in the future.  One more thing, I didn't have any "maple" syrup so I just used the plain old pancake/waffel syrup I had in my pantry and I couldn't tell the difference, it came out fine.  All in all, this will be a family tradition from now on every Fall!!

I altered recipe as follows, turned out PERFECT: Crust: -Omitted brown sugar -4 Tbs butter (instead of 6) -Pecans instead of hazelnuts Cake: -Use REAL CREAM CHEESE (w/o gums or stabilizers; comes in a tube instead of brick and is naturally soft) -Use 1/2 FRESH ROASTED PUMPKIN (instead of canned); cut a medium pumpkin in 1/2, scoop out seeds and brush w/ a little butter & salt, roast at 350 for one hour, scoop out of shell & into cream cheese mixture (no electric tools needed, a wooden spatula works great!) -REDUCE SUGAR - use 1/2 cup dark brown sugar & 1/2 cup grade B organic maple syrup -Use 1/3 cup sour cream instead of heavy cream -Use 1/2 tsp vanilla powder instead of extract (to eliminate alcohol taste) -REDUCE EGGS - use 2 eggs instead of 4.   In general I've found that cakes can be made w/ 1/2 the amount of sugar/butter/eggs called for and taste much better! In this I love the flavor & texture of FRESH pumpkin! Showcase the star ingredient, don't drown it out w/ sugar & eggs. Seriously, this tastes so much better with REAL FRESH ingredients - real cream cheese (instead of hard, sticky, gummy bricks of cheese) and FRESH ROASTED pumpkin (instead of slimy runny canned pumpkin). Give it a try!   Also, I turned the oven off after about an hour and 20 minutes and just let it continue cooking/cooling for another 45 minutes or so in the oven - no cracking or sinking. A work of art!

One of the best cheesecakes I have ever made/had.  It is so very rich and creamy.  I love both pumpkin & cheesecake so this was a perfect combination!  I am not a baker but after seeing this, I just had to try it.  We absolutely loved it!  Thanks so much for sharing the recipe!!

DEElish... we really enjoyed this for our thanksgiving dinner! Didn't have hazelnuts so I used walnuts..served with whipcream maple flavoured. Next time I would double spice and crust..just for our preference.

This was really pretty good but I didn't like the allspice taste or maybe it was the maple syrup. I did use the nuts but used vanilla wafers as gingersnaps is not my favorite. If I try it again I will use corn syrup, some nutmeg and dash of cloves. An old trick my Mom always did was separate eggs; whip whites and than fold in. It has the same flavor but a lighter texture. I have my own version of a water bath: I put in a cold oven a a broiler pan on bottom shelf; fill with water and as the oven gets hot so does the water. This makes it moist without wrapping the bottom of cheesecake pan. I also mixed 1 cup sour cream with 2 T. sugar; spread over hot cheese cake, returned to oven and baked 5 min. more. Next time I would double topping but use only 3 T. sugar.

Made this for Thanksgiving bc I'm not a huge fan of pecan or plain pumpkin pie.  This will be a holiday staple in our house now!  Gingersnap crust is a wonderful compliment to the pumpkin yumminess.

Excellent great alternative to pumpkin pie. I followed the recipe exactly and had great results.  I have made this several times- I have topped it with a sweetened sour cream topping and that works well for a little twist.

This cheesecake was good when it was first served, but actually got better after being in the fridge for a few days.  I would recommend toasting the nuts (I subbed pecans) before using them for a richer flavor & making it 2 days in advance of when you want to serve it to let the flavors fully develop.  We also felt the texture improved after a few days; it became more dense which we like.  I served it simply with some whipped cream on the side & it got rave reviews all Thanksgiving weekend.  This cake can serve 12 easily; you'll get gigantic servings (truly too big as it is very rich) if you stick w/ the 8 serving yield.  I've already had requests to make it again, so it's become a new holiday 'must have'.  Thanks for sharing a winner!

Wow! This was yummy!!! I agree with other users, there was too much butter in the crust... I would leave out at least 1 Tablespoon... but still very good.
I used walnuts in place of hazlenuts and it was great! ALSO, you must have a food processer for those ginger snaps or it's impossible. :)

I have now made this recipe twice in the last few weeks. Everyone has loved it. The only changes I made were to make it in a 9x13 glass dish and cut cheesecake squares. I made a little extra crust but kept the filling at the same amount. Also, I left out the hazelnuts due to a nut allergy in our house. Absolutely wonderful!

INCREDIBLE! WOW did my church family ever love this cheesecake.It came out Beautiful.  I did make some changes tho. I didn't have any heavy cream so I substituted sour cream. I added extra spices since I know my husband and I like alot of flavor. For the crust I used extra ginger snaps and not hazelnuts since I'm not convinced my son can eat them yet. Then to keep the crust from cracking I used some simple tricks. 1: have a seperate container with water in the oven. 2: gently mix eggs then stir them in at the very end of mixing everything else. 3: only bake for 75-80 minutes then turn off oven and leave cake in for another half hour. 
hope your cake turns out as incredible as ours did!

I've never had a lot of luck with baked cheesecakes, but this one is perfect! I didn't use maple syrup the second time I made it, and it was fine. I set it in a water bath, and baked it for 60-70 minutes, and left it in the oven after turning it off, for half an hour. Not only did it look perfect, but it tasted wonderful!

Never made this fancy kind of cheesecake before.  But was pleasantly surprised with the result!  Will definitely make again!!  Listened to others suggestions: make CERTAIN to use a waterbath when baking; used 4 T of butter; used 1/4 c ground hazelnuts; added 1/2 t nutmeg. Will try another suggestion when I make again: bake for just over 1 hour, then turn oven off for final 30 min.  This should make the texture more creamier.  Absolutely best if eaten the following day after being in the refrigerator!

I've made this a few times now and I love this concept. I've made it with both pecans and hazelnuts. I double the spices, and have also used fresh pumpkin which gives it such a different texture and flavor. I make this as opposed to pumpkin pie, and I like this much better. Still experimenting with the crust, as it does get soggy, but I think this recipe is definitely a keeper.

This recipe was amazing!  Tried it this year for Thanksgiving and everyone asked for more!  Very light and fluffy.  I did bake in a water bath to keep from cracking.  I also only baked for one hour and then turned off the oven and left it in there another hour.  I only used gingersnaps in the crust and lessened the butter to keep the crust less greasy.  Turned out great, will definitely be making again.

We thought this was good, but I must have done the wrong thing putting the gingersnaps in the food processor.  They ended up too finely ground, I think.  Because, when I baked the cheesecake, the sugar in the crust seemed to have carmelized and made a harder crust.  So, I think that was my fault, but I didn't like the ginger taste with the pumpkin cheesecake either.  Sorry.

Can't improve on this recipe and it is perfect and great for holidays and celebrations. I have found that if I take the cheesecake out of the oven five minutes sooner than the recipe calls for, the cracks can be avoided.

I mixed gingersnaps and pecan sandies for the crust, and also substituted pecans for the hazelnuts.  There was not enough crust to press 2" up the sides like the recipe stated.  I substituted pumpkin spice coffee creamer for the heavy cream, and also used 2 pkgs. of fat-free cream cheese with one full-fat cream cheese.  I don't think anyone missed the fat.  I only had to cook it about 1 hour, and the top got a little too brown for my taste, so I served it covered with whipped cream.  I got great reviews from the family on Thanksgiving.  I didn't think it was fantastic, though.

I first tried this recipe as a thanksgiving experiment three years ago. I made it for my now-husband's family and it was a huge hit. Now I make it every year for his family, my mom, and my sister's family and everyone loves it! There's no need to make any changes to the recipe, it is wonderful just the way it is!

I didn't actually make the cheesecake part of this recipe, but I had to give it a good rating for the CRUST. I used it with another, more traditional cheesecake recipe from this site and the combination was magic. Thanks for a new spin on an old classic!

Wonderful- the first time I have made a cheesecake EVER. It was beautiful and tasty. No cracks. Followed the recipe except I was a little heavy with the cinnamon. I also turned the oven off after 1hr15min and it had to stay in the oven for an extra 15 minutes. Would try again.

Delicious my husband and I really like it I did add a little extra spices after reading the other reviews.  The curst was perfect with the pumplin cheesecake combo.  I will make this again to take to our holiday gatherings to share with my family.  I think that the water bath would have been helpful because it did crack, but that certainly didn't take away from the flavor of the cheesecake.  Thanks for sharing your recipe!!!!!  I love this website.

This is the best cheesecake recipe I have ever made.  What made it even better was the fact that you don't need an electric mixer....do all your mixing by hand and the cheesecake is perfect when it comes out of the oven.  It doesn't split down the middle, it's smoothe and RICH.  Enjoy!

This is a great recipe although it did need some tweaking...the flavor needed something more so I added 1tsp. nutmeg and 1/2 tsp. cloves. I also will add more sugar next time I make it,not sweet enough for me.I would also put in less hazelnuts since the oils from them leaked out of the bottom of the pan, making the crust a little too greasy. It took an extra 20 minutes in the oven to cook it til set but was well worth it. With the new changes next tiem I am sure it will come out even better. Really nice change from the usual Thanksgiving desserts!

I made a lower fat version of this that came out GREAT.  I used Neufchatel cheese, skim milk instead of cream, and put in 15 oz. of pumpkin.  I also put in more spices.  The cheesecake took longer to cook and the pumpkin seeped out a bit, but it tasted really good!

This cheesecake was a hit at my work Thanksgiving potluck! People talked about it for days.  I read through lots of reviews and took the following advice, which seemed to make the perfect cheesecake: I halved the amount of butter in the crust. Speaking of the crust, it did not make enough to come up the sides 2 inches, but that was fine with me. My crust was primarily on the bottom and slightly up the sides. I also added 1/2 tsp more cinnamon than the recipe called for and included a tsp of pumpkin pie spice as well. I baked this for 1 hour and 15 minutes in a water bath, then turned off the oven and cracked the door with a wooden spoon and let the cheesecake sit in there for 1 hour, then brought it out of the oven and let it sit on the countertop for a little over an hour before refrigerating overnight to cool. I was so proud of my first CRACKLESS cheesecake!!! Next time I make this I will definitely make some homemade cinnamon whipped cream to dollop on top.

My favourite fall desert !  I've made this with both a regular gram crust & the crust the recipe calls for. I didn't find a big difference in overall taste. 
 After letting the cheesecake cool I made pralines & just poured them over the cheesecake while hot. Turned out great

Hello! Love this recipe.
I've done a few different things with it. I always  make my own gingersnap cookies, there is a recipe on here "grandmas old fashioned gingersnap cookies". I make the dough then pat it into the springform pan. I I
Undertake them and then pour the cheesecake mix over. I don't like crumbly crusts, this way it turns out nice and chewy. I also top with a sour cream topping for the last 10 minutes of baking.  Once it's ready to be served I pour warm caramel source over top and serve. It's sooo good! 
Another thing I have done is to make my own pumpkin filling. I roast the pumpkin, when pumpkin isn't in season I use winter squash such as kabocha squash or any sweet squash available. Stay away from butternut as its more difficult to purée (it's a little grainy). I actually prefer the winter squash over pumpkin as it adds a nicer flavor and natural colour. It may take a bit longer but occasions like Christmas are worth it to me!
Happy baking! ??

I made this for a luncheon at work.  Instead of one cheesecake; I used gingersnaps placed in cupcake liners as the crust and made individual cakes.  I baked them about 20-25 minutes.  Once cooled I drizzled salted caramel topping on them and placed a piece of pecan on each one.  These were a hit - everyone loved them!  I also loved them; however I didn't really think the texture was a cheesecake texture - more like a pumpkin pie; that's why it's getting 4 stars not 5.  However, I will make this again and I'll also try it in a springform pan.  Maybe the texture changed because I made it in smaller size in the cupcake liners??

My family is really not into pumpkin, but my mother LOVES pumpkin cheesecake.  We made this with half ginger snaps and half graham crackers for the crust and used pecans instead of hazelnuts, and it was STELLAR!  I think she'll be requesting this every year.

I made this yesterday and served it today for dessert after our Thanksgiving dinner - it was a hit! This is a well-written recipe. It actually came out right on the first try without me having to make any major changes. I omitted the nuts because not everyone in my family likes them - this had no ill effects on the outcome. I also used sour cream instead of heavy cream for a little extra flavor. I baked it in a water bath to prevent cracking and it came out beautifully. No, the texture is not as firm as a NY cheesecake, but I think it's appropriate for a pumpkin cheesecake - it's not as if it has a pudding-like texture like those awful no-bake "cheesecakes" - the texture IS lighter, but holds its shape like a proper cheesecake should. In the future, I may try the recommendations of substituting canned pumpkin pie filling and slightly tweaking the spice profile; however, this recipe is still great as is. I will be using it again.

This has become my favorite cheesecake. The gingersnap crust is so much better than graham crackers. I have used that crust recipe for any other baked items that called for a graham cracker crust. The cheesecake is moist and flavorful.

This was my first attempt at making a cheesecake and it turned out amazing! I was surprised that it did because I made a couple of adjustments (but only because I had to). First of all, I only had 3/4 cup of brown sugar (after the 3 tbsp for the crust). I added about 2 tbsp of white sugar to it. Then I realized I only had 3 eggs left instead of 4. It still turned out perfect.  I didn't even have any problems with it setting properly. It set wonderfully, didn't crack or sag in the middle.

I made this to go with Thanksgiving dinner & it was amazing! I made it in a regular pie dish & ended up only needing 1/2 the filling. Next time I'll cut the filling ingredients in 1/2.

This is the best cheesecake I have ever had. The only changes I made was to replace the maple syrup with 1/3 cup caramel ice cream topping and I omitted the hazelnuts from the crust (ginger snaps, brown sugar and butter only). My husband HATES cheesecakes and even cream cheese but LOVES this recipe!!

WOW. Just as is. The chosen cookie can make a difference in spice combination of course. I like Stauffer's brand gingersnaps. Served this with vanilla bean whipped cream (I keep 10x sugar on hand with snipped beans for fragrance and flavor). Oh my!!

I made this for Christmas Eve and it got rave reviews.  The crust makes this cheesecake!  I left out the hazelnuts and used 2 cups gingersnaps.  I also used one additional cream cheese and added more spices as I had to fill a 10 inch springform pan. I baked it in a water bath for 75 minutes and then left it in the oven to cool for an hour. I wrapped the pan with foil and an oven turkey bag for extra measure to prevent it from getting wet in the water bath.  The cheesecake came out perfect-no cracks and easily cut into pieces which I topped with fresh whipped cream and a sprinkle of nutmeg.  The cheesecake had an wonderful texture--very smooth and creamy.  Next time I will make the crust after making my own gingersnaps.  Excellent!

This was tasty, but not amazing. Made it for tanksgiving. The butter in the crust was too much, as it came out very greasy. Unfortunately, nobody wanted to take the rest of this home with the leftovers. My mom told me she thought it was too rich.

Creamy cool pumpkin goodness! This is one excellent dessert and a nice change from the standard pumpkin pie. I doubled the crust by adding an equal amount of vanilla wafers but left everything for the filling the same. I will definitely be making this one again! Thanks!

Yummy!  I made this a couple years back for Thanksgiving at the in-laws and it made a lasting impression!  I can't believe it's been so long since I made it, but it's one of those special occasion things so I'm going to make it again this year!

I made this cheesecake yesterday and it turned out wonderfully.  As a matter of fact, my daughter didn't want to go to school today because she didn't think there would be any left for her when she got home.  I made a few changes, though.  I used 4 packages of cream cheese instead of just 3. I also threw in about 1 teaspoon of pumpkin pie spice with the other spices as well.  I  used a trimmed down turkey cooking bag instead of wrapping the pan in foil, and it worked much better in the water bath.  The consistency of this cheesecake is much creamier than the typical cheesecake because of the pumpkin, although I did pat the pumpkin down with paper towel.  It was wonderful.  My best so far.  Can't wait to make it for Thanksgiving.  I think I'll do one with the syrup and one without, just to see if there is a difference. ;)

I have never made cheesecake before, and this recipe was amazing!  No one would eat the other pies that we had for Thanksgiving.  I did have difficulty crushing the gingersnap cookies, but I would not eliminate the for anything.  The edges turn slightly brown (before the center had set) is there a way to avoid this? It didn't taste the least bit burnt, so I thought it was just how the gingersnap crust cooked.

This was good, but not what my expectations thought it would be like. The crust was really good, the filling wasn't very firm like cheesecake, it was very silky, mouth fill was not what I was used to. Not very spicey, thought it could be a little more punchy. The family liked it but it wasn't the first thing to go.

This was really good. I wanted to make it once before I made it for Thanksgiving. At first, when I couldnt wait to have a slice before letting it cool ni the fridge overnight, I was a little disappointed. But the next day I had a slice and it was divine. I used walnuts instead and since we are in a temporary house I was only able to crush them in a blender so therewere some pretty big chunks. Despite my worries over that, I think I actually prefer the bigger chucnks of nut. It gives the crust a great texture. I will use less butter (used 5 tbsp instead of 6... next time will cut down to 4 tbsp) and will use 4 packs of cream cheese instead of 3 as I like more of a cheese flavor. Hopefully it turns out as good or better!

Cooking at high elevations can be a challenge.  I followed this recipe with the recommended changes of substituting pecans for the hazelnuts, and I put a pan of water in the oven.  Except for those modifications, I followed the ingredients, temperature & times exactly.  Cooking at 7000 feet can be a challenge, and this came out perfect--no cracks, subtle & wonderful flavors, great texture.  Thanks for this recipe and the reviewer tips.

This cheesecake gets made every year for Thanksgiving and Christmas. The gingersnap crust truely makes the cheesecake, and is an excellent alternative to graham crackers (which I have used in a pinch). A word of caution though - if you bring this to a family gathering, the cheesecake will get scarfed down and your guests won't even TOUCH the other desserts! :D

First cheesecake I ever made and it came out perfect! The second time I made this I left out the pecans from the crust and added more gingersnaps. It was much tastier and less greasy. I highly recommend using all the tips especially the water bath. A yummy keeper at my home!

This was my first time ever making a cheesecake and I used this recipe.  The cheesecake was delicious and rich, just as you would expect a cheesecake to be. The gingersnap crust was a nice change from the ordinary graham crackers! I'll definitely be making this again.

Thought the filling was very tasty, but not a fan of the crust, though some of my guests liked it.  It fell in a bit though, but perhaps that's the baker rather than the recipe?  Definitely need pan of water beneath.

I wish I could rate this recipe better because the flavor was great, but too many things went wrong even though I followed the directions exactly.  I did not have enough crust to bring it up the sides as much as directed to. (Although the crust tasted great & wasn't too buttery or greasy)  I had more filling than would fit in a 9 inch springform pan, so I had to leave 1/3 of the batter out, and it still was too much filling.  It cracked immediately and wouldn't set.  I baked it for almost 2 hours before it set.  It isn't cutting well either.  It tasted good, but doesn't make a good presentation at all.  Had to get up early to make another pie to bring to Thanksgiving as this one won't work.  Dissapointing.

Perfect for after those large Holiday meals. The ginger snaps with hazel nuts is a nice differnce from the standard graham cracker crust, and the filling is a nice not to sweet custard verses the notmally heavier cheese cake filling. A must try, it was GREAT

This was my first attempt at cheesecake, and it was a hit!  Not too difficult either.  Bgased on suggestions from other members, I also doubled the spices.  I would definitely make this cheesecake again.

My daughter made this for Thanksgiving and it was the highlight of our meal.  She used hazelnuts and walnuts in the crust.  It was lovely to look at and tasted even better...a very smooth top - no cracks. We loved the subtle maple flavor with the pumpkin. The crust is divine!

This is the first cheesecake I ever made. I had to substitute almonds for the hazelnuts in the crust, but it didn't matter. By far, this is one of the best desserts I've ever had and the BEST I've ever made!!! It got rave reviews all around. Wonderful replacement for typical pumpkin pie!

This is a new family favorite.  The gingersnap cookie crust is a fabulous combination with this rich, smooth textured cheesecake. I did 1 1/2 times the recipe and used a 10 inch spring form pan.  It is very rich so be careful how big you slice each serving.

This was FANTASTIC...I used a few more spices then it called for since I like a Spicy Pumpkin Taste....The gingersnap crust is a pain since gingersnaps are sooo hard... but it really makes the cheescake....The girls at work were impressed!!  Thanks for sharing!!

I will definitely make this again. It was pretty easy and quite tasty. It isn't too sweet at all, so it's ideal if you like milder desserts. Although I felt I overbaked it a little, everyone I served it to loved it. If you like pumpkin at all, you should love this.

I also used pecans as other have. Next time will add nutmeg and a bit more cinnamon. Also, the tip to put a cookie sheet underneath is perfect.

I’ve made it half a dozen times since I discovered this recipe, and it’s been wonderful each time. 
The only substitutions I made were fresh pumpkin rather than canned, and toasted shredded coconut instead of hazelnuts

I made this recipe as listed here for Thanksgiving and it was delicious, but very hard to cut the crust while chilled. (Hardened butter) So, this time I substituted 2T unsalted butter for the called for 6T and added a Pumpkin Pie Liquor to get the consistency to pack for the crust. I also used 365 (Whole Foods brand) Ginger Snaps...my fav! This alteration was an absolute hit!!!

Excellent recip...easy to make with just a few ingredients. Reduced my baking time by 15 to 20 mins. Just turned the oven off for last 15 mins and left the cheesecake in the oven with the door closed. Then removed it from the oven to allow to cool in pan then chilled overnight in the fridge still in the pan.... Plated the next day and used some left over cookies and fresh whipped cream to decorate! Absolutely delicious! Making this again for sure!!!

Very good as written. I did minimal modification: pecans in the crust, gluten free ginger snaps, a little more cinnamon, and baked in a water bath. I used a 10 inch springform, and it filled the pan nicely. It was nearly done at 65 minutes, so I turned the oven off and let it sit in there for about another 12 minutes. Excellent. Filling was creamy, cheesy, just the right spice, and very flavorful. Will definitely make again.

I did not alter the recipe, but I did read a number of reviews. Careful with the baking time and the potential for cracking. If you make this, odds are very high your guests will love it and be impressed.

This tasted more like pumpkin pie than cheese cake, which is what I hoped.  It is much richer and creamier than a pie.  I only noticed a hint of difference between the ginger snap crust and a traditional graham cracker crust.  I will make it again!

Excellent pumpkin flavor and tall! Followed ingredients for cheesecake. Used a graham cracker crust. Looked too soft at 90 minutes, so baked for 2 hours, which was nice for texture, but also made a big crack on cooling. Covered that with a caramel topping of remaining 1/2 cup cream, 1/2 cup maple syrup, 1 tablespoon butter, 1 tablespoon cornstarch, boiled and constantly stirred until thickened.

It's an annual tradition to make it every Thanksgiving!
We don't use the nuts and we usually have to add a little more of the crust to fit our pan but works great!

This was fantastic! I did make some changes to suit my family's tastes. I used homemade gingersnaps and walnuts in the crust; I also only used about 3 tbsps of melted butter and that was plenty (any more and it would have been greasy). I also pre-baked the crust in the oven at 350 for 10 minutes; which made it set up perfectly for the cheesecake. It wasn't soggy or too dry at all. For the filling, I drained my pumpkin on some paper towels to get rid of any excess moisture. I used 14 oz cream cheese, with 10 oz of sour cream. I added 1/4 tsp salt, zest from a whole orange, 1/4 tsp cardamom, 1/2 tsp allspice, 1/4 tsp nutmeg, 1/2 tsp cloves, and 2 tsps cinnamon. I baked it for 75 minutes at 325 in a water bath, and then shut the oven off and left the cheesecake in there for an hour. It still ended up cracking, but not very much. I allowed it to cool on the counter for another hour before putting it in the fridge. It's a perfect cheesecake, light, but not airy; silky smooth texture; creamy subtle pumpkin taste with the spices just right; and the orange zest added a really nice bright, but not overpowering flavor. It was also pretty easy to make, so I will definitely make it again.

I made this for thanksgiving and it was a big hit! The pumpkin flavour wasn't as pronounced as I would've liked, but that may have been because of my homemade pumpkin purée (I boiled the pumpkin to make it). I ended up making a delicious pumpkin syrup to go on top and that was all it needed :)

This is a great recipe.  The cheesecake turned out really well.  My favourite part was the crust with the gingersnaps and hazelnuts.   The cheesecake itself did not have a very strong flavour and I would likely adjust the spices a little next time, but the consistency was great.   I served with whipped cream and raspberries and blackberries and everyone liked it!

Had my family over for a harvest dinner and I made the pumpkin cheesecake it was great! I loved that it was not so sweet. I drizzled caramel sauce over it and a nice helping of whipped cream, Yummy. Will make this again. I did cut the butter in half.

I used this recipe for Thanksgiving this year, to give my husband a dessert. He developed diabetes this year. I use Splenda Brown sugar, sugar free syrup and nuts and seeds instead of the ginger snaps. the carbohydrates are cut  half. He loves it.

i'd give it 10 stars if i could, easy to make delicious and not overly sweet you get a good amount of flavor for every part of it.  if you want it just a little sweeter make a simple caramel sauce and drizzle it over the top. we also used some graham cracker crumbs mixed in with the ginger snaps, oh one warning is this recipe makes huge cheesecakes so make sure you have the proper pan i used small cake pans and made two cheeses cakes

I made this for thanksgiving dessert, it was fabulous. When I checked after the 90 min it was still soft in the center, so I baked it out of the water bath an additional 20 min. Will make for any special occasion.

Absolutely perfect!  The only struggle I had was with the crust, but that was my issue.  I used ginger snaps and the brown sugar/butter mix, no nuts.  Maybe the nuts would have helped alleviate the toffee-like crust that was nearly impossible to cut through. :( But no cracks!!  (used a small water bath below) BIG TIP: be sure to place the spring form pan on a cookie sheet...it leaks for sure.  But the flavor and consistency was perfect....not too sweet, just right.

Very Good, I used a Water Bath. The trick to that is I put the spring form pan in a oven bag and trim it down, set that on a jelly roll pan, then pour the cheesecake filing into the spring form pan, Put it into the oven and fill the jelly pan with water. Cheesecake did not crack. I was also careful to not over beat. I put my ginger snap cookies in the food processor, left out the nuts due to preference.

I tried this out at a thanksgiving party because I personally am not a big fan of pumpkin pie. At the end of the night half of this pie remained uneaten.  I personally like this pie better than a plain pumpkin, but it didn't come across so well with my friends.

WOW! I have never made a cheesecake in my life. This was quite possibly the best that I have ever eaten though and it was my own!!!!! I actually was too anxious to try it so I did while it was still warm and it was gross. BUT after it SET UP OVERNIGHT like instructed-- it was AMAZING!!! I will make this one time and time again! It's a new fav!!!

****** Well, my cworkers say this is a keeper and I have to agree. I've tried others, but reallike this one a lot. I couldn't find hazelnuts, so I also used pecans, which were fine. I have made many cheesecakes, but this is the first one I made that uses maple syrup. I was skeptical, but it was really great. I love this site.

The only changes I made to this recipe was use pecans in place of hazelnuts and added some pumpkin pie spice.  I did not use a waterbath and had a few cracks, which didn't bother me.  The result was a fairly light, not overly "cheesy" flavorful dessert.  It was exactly what I was hoping for and my family loved it!

I used this recipe for this Thanksgiving. I found it easy to understand and made a decent cheesecake.   I did feel like something was missing. I suggest adding a sour cream topping or serving it with whipped cream.  The hazlenuts in the crust are especially delicious and add a nice crunch along with the ginger snap crust. I used the brand 'Annas Ginger Thins' which are found at any normal grocery store in the cookie idle. They are nice an thin cookies which are easy to smash up into a crumble.   I did not used maple syrup but used regular pancake syrup. Next time I try making this recipe I may use the real stuff and see how it compares.

I made this cheesecake into muffin cups like someone had suggested. Honestly, it didn't do much for me. I probably wouldn't use this recipe again. Maybe it's better when it's a full cheesecake rather than muffins.

Gave this a 3 star rating only because it works more as a base recipe than the real deal (but if I were a first time cheesecake maker, this would be a great recipe!).  I just made this tonight as individual cheesecakes in a muffin pan and they were tasty but missing something.  I'll definitely try this again but I'll be sure to follow some of the modifications listed in the reviews.

I modified the recipe based on member suggestions, with mixed results. Positives: the crust was simple and its flavor was great. I used a very crisp, thin ginger snap (easy to crush with a rolling pin after placing in a Ziploc) and no nuts b/c of an allergy. Negatives: there was definitely too much butter in the crust (at least a tablespoon seeped out of the foil when I took that off) and even though I cooked it 75 min. and also left it in the oven for an hour as many members suggested, the cheesecake was still too soft in the center. Also, it might just be that I prefer regular cheesecake to the pumpkin, but the flavor wasn't the best.

I made this for Thanksgiving, very good.  I would highly recommed leaving out the maple syrup, the maple is too overwhelming.  My cheesecake did have cracks, but once it settled and cooled they were almost gone.  Wonderful addition to Thanksgiving besdies the same old pumpkin pie.

I am rating only crust, because that is all I used. I always had problems with preparing my own crusts but this one came out wonderful. I did use pecans instead of hazelnuts. Great idea.

YUMMY!  What a wonderful combination to add the gingersnaps for the crust!  I've never liked graham cracker crust so it was a great fix for that!  First time I've ever made a cheesecake and it turned out fabulous! Cheesecake baking tips from website were a huge help! I'll definitely make again.

I just made this cheesecake today and I must say that everyone loved it.  The taste of the pumpkin cheesecake was excellent.  I thought it was a perfect blend of spices for my taste.  These are the only things I changed.    I only had 2/5 cup pure maple syrup and didn't have any heavy cream on hand so I just used half and half.  It definitely took 90 minutes even though it was cracked but when it sat for the 1/2 hour, everything settled nicely.  Definitely very good especially with a dollop of cool whip.  Will definitely make again!  Thanks!

Made this for Thanksgiving last weekend and it was a hit.  It was definitely not like traditional cheesecake texture and when I first cut into it, I was a bit nervous.  It almost didn't seem cooked.  The taste was great though.

This recipe is amazing.  I made it for a departmental party and it was the most popular dish that night.  I modified the recipe slightly, eliminating the hazelnuts from the crust and substituting the heavy cream with sour cream.  The cake turned out delicious!

I loved this recipe.  It was very easy to do and tasted great.  This was my first time trying to make a cheese cake and it turned out awesome.  Everyone loved it.  Next time I will follow the advise of another and put it in a water bath because mine did crack pretty bad.  But I think it was great for a first timer.

First let me just say I'm rating the recipe on the flavor combination. I flaked out and forgot to make it the night before so I had to improvise and make a no bake cheesecake. I mixed the softened cream cheese, maple syrup, vanilla, brown sugar and pumpkin for the filling. The crust I made out of the crushed gingersnaps and crused almonds. My variation came out wonderfully and everyone loved the flavor.

Yummy!  Everyone was so impressed with this dessert at Thanksgiving this year.  It will certainly become a family favorite.  I baked it exactly as the recipe stated but I did bake it in a water bath.  The top was very slightly darker that I would have liked it but it tasted wonderful.  Will absolutely make this again!

The flavors in this recipe are amazing, but it is not as easy as the previous reviews made it sound.  If you decide to make individual cakes in muffin tins, use heavy duty papers.  This amount of filling made enough for 24 individual cupcakes, so you need two cupcake pans to make it (unless you want to ruin the first twelve when you try to remove them from the pan, like I did).  But again, the taste makes all the trouble worthwhile.

Delicious cheesecake! I made this for an office party and everyone loved it. It is important to cook this cheesecake carefully. Mine was so thick, that it was difficult to thoroughly cook it inside without burning the edges. Next time I will use a larger diameter pan.

It is very good. It tastes a lot like a creamy pumkin pie. Would make again for T-giving as it isn't overly sweet and it therefore makes for a nice ending for big a meal --with coffee.

Really good cheesecake. I had trouble getting hazelnuts locally and did not seem to get a fine enough grind once I had them all shelled. this was my first attempt at cheesecake in years and it got rave reviews. Oh my pan leaked a little so I guess I should line the oven rack with foil next time.

This cheescake was a BIG hit at family Thanksgiving.  The hazelnuts with the gingersnaps make a great crust.  Loved it and not hard to make.

This recipe makes a delicious cheesecake that is a different twist on pumpkin pie.  I only made the filling part of the recipe because my brother asked me to make it in a regular pie crust.  The gingersnap crust sounds great to me, so I'll have to make another one to try it.  Thanks for sharing!

I made this cheesecake for Thanksgiving, and everybody loved it.  The gingersnap crust really does make a difference in the taste.  I love it, and I'm almost tempted to make it again for Christmas.  It's s great recipe, and I'd recommend it to anyone who likes cheesecake!!

This cheesecake was a huge hit at our last Canadian Thanksgiving!  I did change it by substituting pecans for the hazelnuts in the crust (it's what I had on hand).  It is super creamy and very delicious.  Thanks Shelley!
