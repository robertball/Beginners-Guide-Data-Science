Incredible! I modified the recipe a little using only whole wheat flour (3 1/4 cups) and substituted honey for the sugar. I an extra teaspoon of salt and added 1 t. italian seasoning to the dough for added flavor. I put the ingredients in the bread machine on the dough setting and let it do the work for me!! I precooked the crust for 5 min at 500 degrees and then added the ingredients and cooked it for an additional 14 minutes at 425. Pizza came out PERFECT! even those at the table who were skeptical of whole wheat crust RAVED about this recipe. we will be making this one again and again!

Absolutely delicious!  I tweaked it just a bit.  
Since I'm doing South Beach, I used 3-1/4 c of whole wheat flour and no white flour.  I also added 1 tbl of basil and 1/2 tbl of oregano to the mix.  I used the dough cycle on my bread machine.  
I baked the crust at 500 degrees for 4 minutes and then put the ingredients on and baked it for an additional 6 minutes at 425 degrees.  
It came out crispy on the outside and chewy inside.  What a great recipe and so easy when you use a bread machine!  
Since I had plenty of dough left over, I used it to make some breadsticks. I baked them for 3 minutes at 450 degrees, took them out of the oven and brushed them with melted Smart Balance spread, sprinkled a mixture of parmesan cheese and Kosher salt on the top, and baked them for an additional 4 minutes.  We dipped them in the leftover pizza sauce.  
So good!  And since I didn't have to feel guilty eating pizza since I'm on South Beach, they were even better.  I will definitely be making this recipe again!

OK, so I read all the reviews, and decided to tweak the recipe taking pages from a few of the reviewers.  I used all whole wheat flour (3 1/4c) because I'm doing the South Beach diet.  I also added 2tbs of Italian Seasoning to the flour mixture, and put everything in my bread machine, using the "whole wheat dough" cycle.  I then prebaked the crusts at 500 for 6 minutes, added the toppings and continued baking at 425 for another 6-7 minutes.  I was AMAZED at 1.) how much dough there was.  Easily enough for 2 thick crusts or 3 thin crusts, and 2.) how much it tastes like regular pizza crust.  My husband even said he couldn't tell the difference!

I would recommend this to anyone for sure.

It tastes good but it is not whole wheat unless you use all whole wheat flour.  This recipe should be called "Wheat Pizza Crust" 
I try to eat only whole grains and want people to know this distinction.

Excellent!  i did what others did and used only whole wheat flour - I used 3-1/4 c.  It turned out wonderful.  I meant to add some other spices, but forgot - it still was fabulous.  I made 1 thick crust pizza...baked the crust alone for 5 min at 500 degrees, then added the sauce and toppings and cooked for almost 15 min. at 425 degrees.  My husband who usually doesn't like my cooking - and doesn't like pizza loved it.  So did my boys (5 & 2yrs)  This was a big hit!  Will make again many times.  I made it with a 1/2 a jar of alfredo sauce for the sauce and topped with chicken, onions and garlic sauteed in olive oil.  Topped with part skim mozzarella.  EXCELLENT!!!!!!

Excellent recipe... I used 2 T of honey instead of the 1 tsp of sugar for the yeast.  Made 2 thin crust pizza's but next time i will divide the crust into 3 portions for a more thinner crust.  Used Organic stone ground w/w flour and organic extra virgin first cold press olive oil.  I did use non stick pizza sheets and did not oil the pans and they were fine.  Next time shall add some seasonings to the crust just for a change.  for toppings I used fresh mushrooms, tomatoes, red pepper, pizza sauce, broccoli 'dust' (leftover brocolli floret crumbs from home made frozen brocolli, fresh baby spinach, part skim mozzarella and grated parmesan cheeses.  Very yummy, 2 of us ate 2/3rds of one pizza. :) will definitely make again soon, may even add some ground flax or toasted wheat germ for added healthyness :)  Instructions were very easy to follow, and enjoyed the work out from the kneading ;) Thank you!

I was very happy with this recipe!!  I have had trouble using yeast in the past.  Well, the directions in this recipe were totally clear and easy to follow.  I had no trouble and the results were fantastic!  I threw a bunch of dried herbs into the flour mixture for flavor.  This rose very well and made two pizzas.  Just like the description says: soft and chewy in the middle and crisp on the outside.  The bottom and middle were fully cooked too (I've had trouble with doughy-ness in the past...)  I pre-baked at 500 degrees for 5 minutes (without any sauce or toppings).  Then I put on sauce, cheese, a little bit of pepperoni and lots of veggies and baked at 435.  The yummiest pizza ever!  This will be my standard pizza dough recipe from now on.**** Have made this countless times since first reviewing it, and it gets better and better!  Tonight I divided the dough into 4 smaller pizzas, which was great.  I was able to do different toppings on each one to please each member of the fam.  On mine I put gorgonzola cheese and fresh tomatoes, it was soooo delicious!  They baked up really nice too.  I think I will do it this way from now on!

Very good recipe.  Some suggestions: Use a pizza stone and bake at a higher temperature (500 or higher if you have a good oven).  Also you can use all whole wheat flour, but you onlyl need about 3 cups.

I use all whole wheat flour with 3 tbs of gluten and it is wonderful. Bake slightly before adding toppings.

Awesome!  Made two thin crusts out of this, with the amazing pizza sauce on top.  Followed other cooks' suggestion of pre-baking crust at 500 for 10 min or so, then baked with toppings at 425 for about 7 min.

Pay attention to your yeast!  If you use quick or instant yeast and let it sit in warm water for 10 minutes, it will waste most of the fermentation and your crust will be dense.  If you have quick rise yeast, mix it in dry, and then add warm water.  That's what's happening to everybody who has complained about "bagel-like" crust!

FANTASTIC!  Added 1 tbs italian seasoning and 1 tbs garlic powder to the dough.  Used 3 1/4 cups whole wheat flour. Divided dough in 2 thin crusts.  Put ONLY crust in oven @ 500 for 5 minutes, then added toppings, then back in oven at 400 for 15 mins. Toppings included pizza sauce, marble cheese, green olives, red onions, red and green peppers, and mushrooms. Excellent.

I have been using this recipe for more then a year and it always turns out wonderful.  I divide the dough into 4 sections then after the last rise, shape the balls into 4 small pizza crusts and freeze them.  They keep wonderfully in a gallon freezer bag.  I just pile on my toppings straight out of the freezer and bake.  Perfect amount for 2 people!

This is an excellent pizza crust for someone who likes to eat healthy meals. The crust was very easy to make and had a good crunch to it when it was done. I have to make this crust again.

This is a very good recipe, and I have made it four times, but the prep and cook time stated (ready in 45 minutes) is a little misleading.  It takes mixing time (5 minutes) plus 10 minutes standing time, and then rising time of 60 minutes plus another 45 minutes for resting, and THEN you are ready to make the pizza (maybe another 10 minutes, if you have everything ready).  It bakes for abut 20 minutes.  This adds up to 2 hours and 30 minutes from start to finish.  It certainly is not ready in 45 minutes!  Any bread baker would know this, but a beginner might not.

I love this pizza crust. If you like extra crispy crust and you are using a pizza stone, then place the pizza on the very hot pizza stone without the toppings. Let it cook and get crisp for about 5 minutes at 500F, then reduce heat to 425F and add the toppings, and let cook until your toppings are warm and melted (about 10 min at the most). I have found if I add the pizza fully prepared and then put it into the oven it takes much longer for the pizza to cook, and the crust never gets crispy in the center of the pizza.

This was perfect.  I split this into 2 crusts to make thin crust pizzas.  I was nervous because this was the first time I made my own pizza dough.  I will never go pack to pre-made crusts.  This was AMAZING just like the title says. This definitely beats any pizza crust I've ever had.  This is something you need to commit time at home for....so pizzas will become a sunday evening dinner from now on!

I threw everything in my bread machine in the order that my machine likes, put it on "dough" cycle and pressed start. It couldn't have been easier. Excellent crust - just as promised - crisp on the outside and soft and chewy on the inside ! Thanks for a great recipe.

Went with reviewers tips and used 3 1/4 c King Arthur W/W white flour and added 2 tsp pizza seasonings I found at my local Winco store (think it has traditional italian seasonings with pepper flakes).  I've never baked with yeast and so this is my first attempt. I was very pleased with results and also ease of directions.  I made 4 individual pizzas 2 pepperoni, 1 cheese, and 1 BBQ chicken.  Big hit with the family and healthy too.  can't wait to try again with other topping combinations, using honey, and freezing.

This was my first attempt at pizza and (not to toot my own horn) but it was good!  Great recipe!  I've made this pizza 4 times in 2 weeks.  I've made both the thin crust and thick crust. I didn't change anything about the recipe except following some other reviewers' advise by cooking it for 5 min at 500, then 15-20 min at 425.   It's good if I bake the pizza on the same day and if I prepare the dough the night before.  After shaping the pizza, I let it sit for 10 min (for fresh dough) or 15 min (for refrigerated dough) to let it rise again so that it's light.  The thin crust is good and the thick crust is even better, it was very light and just melted in your mouth.  And it didn't have that grainy kind of whole wheat taste.

I have not tried this recipe yet, but it looks easy and healthy. My question is: can you freeze dough to use later and can it be made in a larger quantity?
Thanks

This recipe is fantastic.  It is easy and never fails.  I actually divide the dough into four balls and make very thin crispy pizzas.  Everyone I've made it for has loved it and asked for the recipe.

Edited to add: normally I follow the recipe exactly, but last night I got home late from work and my husband works nights, and we had really been looking forward to homemade pizza.  I didn't have time to proof the dough properly so I mixed the dough and proofed it for 45 minutes.  I then rolled out the pizza bases and baked them and it came out absolutely delicious.

I can't believe all the reviewers who didn't follow the recipe and still gave it a rating.  This is a site where you are free to post your own recipe, like, say, if you took someone else's recipe and changed the flour, changed the temp., and added extra ingredients.  

So anyway, the blend of flours in this recipe makes a crust with great flavor and texture. It's just chewy enough with good large bubbles from first rolling, then hand-stretching.  I have made this dough twice already, and will be making it many more times.

Used 1/2 bread flour and 1/2whole wheat flour.  Best if dough is left to rest wrapped in plastic in refrigerator for 2-3 days.  Much more pliable, airy and chewy.  The bread flour gives a better texture than all-purpose flour IMHO.

I love this Pizza dough. I change it up a little bit every time. I always use honey. I live with four guys in Minnesota and my house is always cold so I had to improvise when finding a warm place for the dough to rise, so I start the oven for a few minutes and turn it off. This works great for me. I've tried using both all whole wheat, and using the original recipe. Both are great. I also freeze my dough. Last time I split my batch into 5 separate balls rather than 2. This makes a perfect portion for personal pizzas. I let the dough rise and then throw it in the freezer. I'll take it out the night before and set it in the fridge when I want to use it. It works wonderfully. I find it best to chop up all the toppings very small. And I also use pasta sauce. Works great. Breakfast pizzas are delicious as well. To cook, I grease a cookie sheet with olive oil, roll the dough out on it. Curl the edges. Place the ingredients on top, and bake at 425 for 16-18 min. Its always perfect. I'll never buy a pre made pizza again.

This is the pizza crust recipe I ALWAYS use. To save time, I first dissolve the sugar in the water, and sprinkle the yeast, and once that's ready, I put all the ingredients into my bread machine -- set it on dough/whole wheat cycle and it's good to go! So easy and very good.

This was delicious and I have tried A LOT of pizza crusts, white and wheat and this was the best.  My only suggestion would be to cook the dough for 10 minutes before putting the toppings on because the cheese browned before the crust was crispy on a pizza stone. It was still good though. For those of you who are health conscious, I figured out that making 2 crusts and putting pizza sauce and pizza cheese on it (1/2 bottle and 1/2 package) with spices and a serving of pepperoni that it was about 180 cal. and 7g of fat per slice of an 8 slice pizza made on a standard pizza stone. :-)

I had to add about half a cup of extra flour, as the dough was pretty sticky. I used a sprinkle of corn meal in the pizza pan to ensure the dough wouldn't stick. I baked the crust for 5 minutes brushed with olive oil then added toppings and cooked for 18 more minutes.  Try drizzling a small amount of honey over the finished pizza (regardless of toppings) for a really nice compliment to the wheat flavor!

This recipe has never failed me. I cook for a living and use this recipe whenever I make pizza. Sometimes I use only wheat flour, and it still turns out great.

Very tasty crust! I followed the recipe exactly. I've also made breadsticks out of this with only a few minor changes. I found that my dough was pretty sticky, so I added just a little extra flour (slightly less than 1/4 cup. You may or may not need to do this). I put all ingredients into my bread machine, liquid/salt first, dry ingredients last, and set it on the "dough" cycle. When that was complete, I rolled the dough out on a lightly floured surface to 1/4 inch thickness and sliced it into strips using a pizza cutter. I then brushed the tops with an olive oil and garlic powder mixture (you could use butter!) and sprinkled on some parmesan cheese. I let them rise on a greased cookie sheet for 45 mins and then baked them at 350 for about 12 minutes. Made for a great breadstick, very soft! Thank you for sharing this awesome recipe!

Really tasty - even the picky 4 y.o. ate it.  Followed others reccommendation and used only whole wheat, but used King Arthur whole wheat white flour.  Made 2 large crusts, par baked each for 10 minutes and thoroughly cooled them.  Wrapped them in freezer wrap and put them in the freezer.  When I got around to using them I defrosted them and topped as usual (plain cheese and buffalo chicken - YUM).  Baked at 425 until golden and bubbly, roughly 10 min.  Excellent to have on hand when I don't feel like cooking.  Making calzones tonight, plus extra crusts for the freezer!

I've made this recipe several times now and it only gets better the more you do it.  The instructions are easy to follow and the product is absolutely amazing.  I like to use honey instead of sugar and I also like to add basic Italian seasoning and cayenne pepper to the mix.  Prebaking the crust is a must!  Thanks for a great recipe!

I used a pizza stone baked at 500 for 10 minutes to brown the crust, as somone suggested, then removed the crust, lightly coated with extra virgin olive oil (to make the crust extra cripsy on the outside) and added the toppings.  Once the toppings were added baked an additional 10-12 minutes at 450 with the toppings.

I subbed 2 Tablespoons of Honey for the White Sugar, and 1 Cup Self-Rising Flour for the All-purpose+yeast.  Not only did this cut down on prep time, the honey really went very well with the wheat.

I cook this recipe at 500 degrees and it never fails. Kid-friendly. Feeds lots of people easily. Delicious. Super easy if you use a meat or candy thermometer to get the right temperature.

Great whole wheat pizza dough. I made mine using white whole wheat flour. Definitely wheatier than my standard pizza dough but it is really tasty. My kids loved it.

I also baked at 450 degrees on a preheated pizza stone. Since I make pizzas in all different sizes for whomever is going to eat them, they varied on time.

Truly amazing! Followed the recipe exactly, but added a few spices (1/2 tsp garlic powder, 1 tsp oregano) b/c I always add those to any pizza crust dough recipe. Used the dough cycle in my bread machine, and prebaked each of the two 14" thin crusts for about 10 mins at 400 degrees (my nonstick-coated holed pans don't allow higher temps than this). Baked another 10-15 mins at 350 after topping. These were so easy to roll out. Crust is crispy and chewy and light. Will make this my usual recipe from now on!

This was my first successful attempt to make pizza crust and it turned out fantastic!  It was so much easier than I thought it would be. I used 3 1/4 cup whole wheat flour to make it "whole wheat" as other reviewers stated.  I mixed it with the dough hook in my kitchenaid mixer so there was no need to knead it.  I seperated it in 2 and just pressed it out to the edges of my 2 large pizza stones so it made fairly thin crusts.  I prebaked 1 for 5 minutes then topped it and baked 8 more minutes, the other I just topped and baked for 13 minutes without prebaking it and they both came out great.  Instead of brushing the pan with oil I just sprinkled it with cornmeal.  We'll definitely be making this crust again!

Fabulous!  I did use all whole wheat flour and it turned out great--enough for 2 generous pizzas.  Chewy, versatile (you could add some Italian herbs and/or grated parmesan for extra flavor), and easy.  I LOVE the fact that there are minimal ingredients.  Why buy premade crust again?  Thanks for sharing!

Have never attempted home made pizza dough before for fear of being disappointed. This recipe sets a new standard for delicious!! I used 3 cups multigrain best for bread flour, added basil and Italian seasoning, and followed the suggested baking at 500 for 5 minutes, applied topping, then continued for 12 minutes at 450. Perfect!! I also misted the dough with water at the 2 minute mark to ensure a really crisp crust, leaving the inside soft. Honestly, will never try another recipe for pizza dough and will definitely think twice about ordering take out! Thank you Marla!

i'm just adding that I've been making pizza on a pizza stone for years and have never precooked my crust and have no problems with it baking all the way through. It usually takes 6 to 7 minutes total with my oven set at 505.

I am AMAZED. This crust is delicious. I only used 1 cup of all-purpose flour and you can't even tell that this a whole-wheat crust. I also added some italian spices (basil, oregano) to the dough for an added kick. The dough was a bit sticky at first and hard to roll out so I ended up needing more flour.

I divided the dough into thirds because I like really thin crust. 

I baked the thin crust at 500 degrees for 5 minutes, then added toppings and cooked an additional 10 minutes to get it nice and crispy. 

Delicious!

This turned out great!  I make pizza for my roommates all the time and have been looking for a good whole wheat pizza crust. I was worried because the dough didn't quite double in size and didn't puff up at all after I baked it, but it was a little crispy on the outside and still soft on the inside.  I will definitely be using this recipe from now on!!  

Oh, and I used all whole wheat flour instead of using some all purpose flour

I have made this several times now and the family just loves it.  I did make a few changes for ease and healthiness.  First I use all whole wheat flour and 5 tsp of vital wheat gluten.  I also dump all ingred into my bread maker and process on the dough cycle.  When finished, I divide the dough into two pieces and kneed a few times before putting into greased bowls.  I cover and let rise about 30 minutes or so before rolling out.  Thanks for sharing this amazing recipe!

I don't know how people can give an honest review if they alter the recipe. It's confusing and one of pet peeves with this site. That being said- I made this twice so far and it was awesome. Even tho it's not entirely whole wheat it still makes me feel like I'm eating healthier and my kids can't tell the difference.

SO GOOD, will never make another crust.  Adds nice flavor!  I followed others' advice and used all whole wheat flour, actually 3 1/4 cups total.  AND, I used the dough cycle of my breadmaker!  Made two thin crusts, yummmm...

Terrific whole wheaty pizza crust.  Cooks up crispy especially is you double the recipe and make 3 dough balls out of it.  Freezes beautifully.  If you use white whole wheat (just one gram less fiber than regular whole wheat) no one will even think it's a "healthier" pizza crust.  This recipe has become our Friday night ritual and use fresh mozzerella and lots of veggie toppings.  No guilt and no need to get take out pizza.  Also a very quick dough to put together, even with the rise.  A++++

Excellent recipe with modifications. Didn't add sugar - whole wheat is already sweet. Used all whole wheat, no white flour, which caused me to increase flour by at least 1 cup. As a thin crust, it is perfection.  As a deep-dish crust, it tastes like eating wheat bread with toppings (not so great, so I would use the wheat/white mix as recipe is written if I wanted deep dish).  I doubled the recipe and made 4 pizzas (several different size pans). As long as the crust was rolled thinly, it was yummy with different toppings (canadian bacon/pineapple, traditional pepperoni, and vegetable).  Used "Pizza Without the Red Sauce" recipe for the vegetable pizza. Used a combination of "Easy Pizza Sauce III" and "Exquisite Pizza Sauce" recipes for the traditional pizzas. My whole family was raving!

I followed the recipe exactly as written and my pizza crust turned out fabulous! I did use a bit of cornmeal on my pizza stone to insure a crisp crust, and I prebaked the crust for about 5 minutes before adding my toppings. Easy recipe. I will definitely be making this again. Thanks for sharing, Maria.

This is my go-to pizza crust. It's much tastier than   all-white flour pizza crust, and healthier. The recipe makes enough dough for two pizzas, so I freeze half the dough for next time :-)

This is the best thin-crust pizza dough recipe I have found yet!  I just mix it up in the food processor and it turns out perfect every time!  The flavor of the dough really shines through, it's not just a toppings holder.
To make this dough even better and easy to manage, add about 2 Tb and 2 tsp vital gluten.  Let the dough sit overnight in the refrigerator and bring it out about 2 hours before you're ready to stretch it out.  Amazing what a difference this makes.

Best pizza crust I have ever made and it is healthy too!  Changed it up a bit, used 2 1/2 cups whole wheat flour and 1 1/4 cups white flour and just used one packet of yeast which I think is 2 1/4 teaspoons.  Makes 2 large size thin crust pizza's.

This was my first attempt at making pizza crust at home (other than working at a pizza place making dough in my high school days) and it turned out wonderfully. This definitely makes enough for two 12 inch regular crusts, but if you are looking for thin thin crust, this could make three. I used corn meal on my pan instead of oil and that worked fine (no sticking to the pan). Because I didn't want bland pizza from using whole wheat flour, I used "Exquisite Pizza Sauce" also on this site and it had a fabulous taste. I made one pizza right after making the dough and refrigerated in plastic wrap the other portion for use the next day. If you refrigerate, make sure you let the dough sit for a half hour or so because mine didn't rise like the first one did because it didn't "proof" properly. It still tasted great though.

I finally found it!  Recently I changed my family's diet from white to brown.  My kids love pizza and were begging for take out.  I have been trying different whole grain recipes and they didn't cut it with them until now!  WE HAVE A WINNER!!!  Thank you!

Pretty easy and simple recipe!  
I used all the dough for one crust, and next time I will split it in to two as it makes for a very thick crust.
I used instant yeast instead, one package, and let it sit for half an hour until rolling it out.  I also covered my pizza pan with corn meal before putting the dough on the pan.
I baked it at 425 for about 15 minutes until it started to brown and then I added my toppings and baked for another 10 minutes. (I like a crispy crust) 
Other then it having thick crusts it is a great recipe!

it was ok.............i only used whole wheat flour and I think that our taste buds were not used to such an intense wheat taste.  Might try it again with the all purpose.

My 5 star rating is based on the recipe as written! It delicious! I have used this recipe twice so far and the first time, I followed the recipe exactly and that's where the rating came from... The second time I used ONLY whole wheat flour 3 1/2 cups total... It was also delicious!! From now on I will use this recipe but with that small adjustment! :)

I love the recipe!  I just stack it in the bread machine, throw in a tbsp of minced garlic, and a tsp of sea salt - maybe a few tbsp of flaxseed, and walk away!

Perfect for vegan pizza!

Great Recipe! Made 4 large, really thin crust pizzas. Because they were so thin, I par baked the crusts for 6 mins , topped them and baked 5 min. Worked really well with pepperoni & cheese, but the all veggie pizza was a little limp in the middle. Next time, I will par bake it 8mins for veggie. Will be making again tomorrow, to par bake and freeze for quick week day meal!

This was a great helthy pizza crust to make in the breadmaker. I used all whole wheat flour. I would pre-bake the crust for a few minutes after putting toppings on though, otherwise it is harder for the dough to cook.

I followed the instructions for baking, but there was no mention of letting the dough rise once you shape it onto pizza pans.  As a result, mine didn't rise much in the oven and was pretty heavy/dense.  I was pretty bummed, since I'd doubled the recipe.  I've made pizza tons of times successfully, but I hadn't done so in a couple years.  It may have been my fault, which is why I still gave the recipe a three (after all, others thought it was fine, but they may have just been being nice).  But the instructions were so specific about the length of the first two rise times that I thought it would've told me if I needed to let it sit out before baking (after adding the toppings).

For a whole wheat pizza, this is incredibly good!  WOW!  One of the best crusts I have ever made.  Yes, it took some time to rise, but so worth it!  Also, my dough rose quicker than stated because I preheated my oven to 200 degrees and turned it off when it reached that and placed my dough in there.  It shaved about 1/2 the rising time off.  SO good!  I will be making this again!

Needed a few changes but overall a great recipe. I added some italian seasonings & garlic to give it more flavor. I also split the flours evenly. I've made it several times. I ususally freeze half the recipe and it is still great after thawing in the fridge!

This was wonderful!! I too used all whole wheat flour and added 3 tsp gluten.  Since I used fast rising yeast, I only let the first rise last 30 minutes, and the second rise for only about 20 minutes (due to time constraints, as I neglected to read ahead!). To make a great authentic tasting crispy crust, I folded the edges and pinched them over, prebaked the crust at 500 degrees for 7 minutes, brushed with olive oil, reduced the heat to 450 and added toppings.  It was fantastic! (For a very tasty pizza, top the sauce with garlic, spinach and goat cheese - yum!)
This recipe made one "large" pizza and two personal size with a fairly thick crust (but not too thick!)  I will definitely make this again - thanks!!

I used to only have one whole wheat pizza crust recipe that was good enough to please our family.  Now I have another.  This crust is crispy and very to easy to make, especially with a food processor.  I've made it several times and it was great even without the second rising time.  I also froze a batch and after thawing, rolled it out in the pan.   I let it rest for about 30 minutes and it still turned out wonderfully!

This the same recipe that I have been using. I do like an extra 1/2 kosher salt and I add a tablespoon of gluten for each cup of flour to give it a chewier, stretchier consistency. This recipe works well in a processer with a dough blade attachment.

My new favorite pizza crust! I like whole wheat foods, but I served this to my entire family, many of them who don't care too much for whole wheat. They all loved it!!! Even my little nephew was crying because he wanted more. It was pretty easy to make, and it tasted fantastic. I had my crust a bit thicker (which is how I like it). I will definitely make this again.

I made 11 inch round deep dish pizza. This crust turned out perfect. Nice outside crust with soft inside.

My crust did not come out very crisp, but my friend's did when she made it. The only difference we could figure was that she used pizza pans with holes in them. If you make 2 pizzas and eat 1/3 of one crust the WW point value is 6. It also takes 1 hr 45 min (total) to rise)

It was just ok. Whole wheat flour has a strong taste to me. It didn't go well with the goat cheese, pesto, arugala pizza I made.

Taste Amazing and my boyfriend who is super picky asked if I could make it into a bread as well. He loved it. 
I made a artichoke heart, spinach, chicken, canadian bacon, olive pizza with it.

Great classic dough!  When feeling squirrely, I'll mix add a couple Tbsp of Italian seasoning to it.

Thank you Maria! The recipe worked perfectly -- nice dough center to hold the toppings, but a nice crispy crust to nibble on... I've tried one of Martha's and Emeril's recipes, but yours is the best one so far. Brava!

I must have done something wrong because this came out hard as a rock.  I followed the recipe exactly.  I live at a high altitude, maybe that was the problem.

I halved the recipe to make just one thin crust pizza.  I put everything in the bread machine and let it do the hard work for me.  It turned out great.  I will definitely make this again.

Definitely a keeper! I tried this recipe for the first time last night, and followed the suggestions of substituting 2 TBL honey for the sugar, and all whole wheat flour instead of the mix, and EVOO of course. I did not use a bread machine. Forgot to mix in the italian seasonings, but will try that next time. For thin crust, I agree that this is enough to make 3 crusts. If you want to dissolve the honey in the water and still have it at 110 for the yeast, I suggest starting with very hot water, and let it cool after you mix in the honey. It's winter time and everything is cold here so that method worked perfect for me. I also heated the oven to "warm" and turned it off as soon as it reached temp for a warm place to put the dough to rise. For this too you want the oven to cool a bit as the "keep warm" setting is around 170 for most ovens, and you only need 80-85. For a nice crispy crust, pre-cooking it is a must. I topped it with pesto, smoked chicken and sauteed red onions, mushrooms, arugula, broccoli, shredded carrots & low fat cheese. Very different but delicious!

My husband was soo impressed with this crust, he kept raving about it. It was light and crispy like a cracker but very flavorful. I made the recipe as directed above, I enjoyed the mix of whole wheat and white flour. Wouldn't change a thing, the recipe was time consuming yet fairly simple to put together. Highly recommended. I am actually making it again tomorrow with a pesto sauce and tomato and cheese toppings. I took the advice of another user and precooked the crust using a pizza stone at 500 degrees, toasting both sides for about 5-7 minutes before taking it out and adding the sauce and toppings. Be sure to poke a few holes in the crust before you pre-cook or you will see large bubbles (some people like that though).

This was my first attempt for whole wheat pizza crust and it was DELICIOUS. It was far better than some of the better local pizza shoppe's whole wheat. The only thing I did differently was to replace the sugar with honey, I added about 1 tsp of oregano.  I prebaked the crust for about 10 minutes and then added my ingredients and cooked another 15 minutes until the crust was crispy and brown. I added carmelized onions, tomatoes, mozzarella and goat cheeses and fresh basil. I drizzled it with mushroom/sage EVOO.  Thank you for sharing such a wonderful recipe.

Excellent! Crispy on the outside and soft in the middle. I used 3 1/4 cup whole wheat flour and added some oregano and basil. I used my mixer for the mixing and kneading....very easy recipe!

Great wheat crust! I made the dough in my bread machine on the regular dough cycle, took it out and let it rise again. It was easy to roll out. Made enough for 2 large pizzas. I don't love the taste of whole wheat but wanted a healthier pizza crust for my family, and this was not too "wheaty". Nice flavor and great texture. Will definitely make this again!

I have tried many whole wheat pizza crust recipes over the years and all have fallen short of being what I hoped they would be.  This one passed the test!  Amazing!!!  I used all whole wheat flour (3-1/2 cups) and added about 4 tsp. of gluten because of the absence of white flour.  I also added 1/4 tsp crushed red pepper, 1 T Italian seasoning, and some garlic powder as the dough mixed.  Again, this crust was amazing!  As stated in the description, chewy on the inside and crisp on the outside.  Delicious!  Baked my crusts at 425* as the recipe indicated and they turned out perfectly golden brown.  I could go on and on about how much my family and I loved this recipe!  Will be making again and again and again and again!

The recipe in itself is good. I am just taking issue with the fact that it is called whole wheat pizza dough, when in fact only half of the flour in it is whole wheat.

This turned out really well.  The only reason I gave it four stars instead of five is because I changed the recipe a little.  I used all whole wheat flour and made the dough in my bread machine.  I've never made dough in my bread machine before and it actually turned out really well.  I think next time I will cut the recipe in half.  It made a very large, thick crust and we tend to like a thinner crust but other than that it was very good!  So much better for you than a store bought pizza crust, will be making this in the future for sure!

Great! again with what everyone has been saying. It is not whole wheat unless all your flour is whole wheat flour. So i used whole wheat flour, but i didnt end up using a 3 cups. I used about 2 1/2 cups maybe just a little more. I also used honey in replace of sugar! turned out awesome. My husband ate it when i he at first reffused to eat a whole wheat pizza. :o)

Loved it! Healthy and works prefect with out pizzas at home! Walmart's pizza sauce is all-natural so I bake the crust for about 10 minutes without anything on top. Then I spread the sauce on top, italian cheese blend, and add bell pepper, onion, mushrooms, basil, oregano...delicious!

I thought this was a good dough actually.  I made it as is, but made pizza turnovers with the dough.  I was able to make 16 turnovers.  For a whole wheat crust I was quite impressed.  I just brushed the tops of my turnovers with a bit of olive oil.  Im sure the crust would be just as nice with the spice changes.  And I used my Kitchen Aid Bread dough hook and the dough came out great.  Thanks for sharing.

This had a wonderful flavor.  Next time, we might prebake the crust for a few minutes before topping just to make sure that the bottom isn't soggy and the toppings aren't burnt.  We came close to that happening but it turned out okay. Thanks for the great recipe!

This turned out so much better than I expected!  I used freshly ground hard white wheat and put it on the dough cycle in my bread machine.  We also precooked at 475 for about 5 minutes.  Once we added the toppings, we reduced the heat to 425 and cooked for another 10-12 minutes or until the crust was golden brown.  Wonderful!

Very good dough. The only problem I had was when I was rolling it out, it was sticky and when I tried to stretch it using my fist it tore. I blame the humidity but not sure. I ended up rolling it on the oiled baking sheet and gently stretching it out. Will definately make this again.

Great recipe.. Cooked my pizza at 400 for 20 minutes, crust was chewy but also crispy - though it wasn't burnt.  This is my go-to recipe for pizza dough

If you're looking for a crispy whole wheat crust, look no further. Following the recommendations of others, I used only whole wheat flour (3 cups) and used white flour only for dusting the counter. I made 4 smaller pizzas with thin crusts. Dusting the pizza stone or tray with semolina flour/cornmeal works really well to keep it from sticking and gives it that pizza-restaurant taste. I baked the crusts on their own first at 550F for about 4 minutes, and then baked again at same temp with toppings for about 5 minutes. Yum!

This was great. I made 1 larger thick crust pizza and it was a hit. I followed the instructions exactly, and had no problems at all....very easy, though something you'd have to plan earlier in the day. My family loved it, and my (picky) father didn't notice it was whole wheat at all!

Didn't like this one. It  took too long to make, plus the texture was soft, barely crispy on the bottom. It was more like bread than a crust. I made it with all whole wheat flour. My husband took 2 bites and wouldn't eat any more, although he isn't a fan of whole wheat in general. Will use my regular crust recipe in the future.

Excellent!  I mixed the dough in my bread machine, used all whole wheat and added gluten.  Made two thin crusts and parbaked at 500 degrees for 5 minutes, then loaded them up and baked at 500 degrees for another 15 minutes.  I used a pizza stone.

This crust was good and hardy. I added 1 TBS of garlic, Italian seasoning, and crushed red pepper. I did brown the crust at 500 degrees for 10 minutes and then topped it and cooked it for the additional 18 minutes at 425. I found my crust was still not quite as done as I would have liked. Next time I would probably cook it for 5-7 minutes longer.

This recipe is great.  I doubled this recipe for dinner.  I changed the sugar to honey - 2 tablespoons honey instead of the 1 tsp. of white sugar.  We had company arrive at five,  the pizza I started at 4:30.   We ate about 8:45 P.M.  everyone said it was wonderful.   We used pizza sauce, red onions 2 kinds of cheese, Italian seasoning, ham sliced and pineapple tidbits... I baked each crust in a 450 degree oven until it was about 1/2 baked through, then I removed the crust and added all the toppings; baked each pizza again at 425 about 15 minutes or untill the cheese was hot and bubbly.  The pizza crust rose nicely, it was quite thick!!!   I also added a 1/2 teaspoon more salt to the single recipe. Ginny 1/15/2010

I made this dough last week and it came out delicious!  Crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside was its wonderful texture.  I used half the dough the night I made it and refrigerated the other half. I used the refrigerated dough a few days later and it turned out just as great. Thanks for the recipe :)

Lovely pizza crust if you like a bready crust.  We make this every week for our family "pizza night".  I dump the ingredients into my bread machine on the "Dough" setting.  We avoid white sugar so usually use 100% maple syrup in place of the sugar, and it works beautifully.  Sometimes I'll add garlic powder/basil/oregano or a bit of parmesan to the crust for extra flavor.

I don't know about amazing, but it was o'k. The only change I made was to add a teaspoon of garlic herb mix to the dough; I had to add an extra half cup of flour while kneading, but the dough turned out smooth and fairly easy to work with. It was just a little too dry for my taste. I cooked it at 425 for 16 minutes, then turned the temp down to 375 for another 10.

I have been trying different variations of wheat crust for pizzas and this one is by far the best.  My only change to it is adding 1/4 cup honey in the first step and it came worked out perfect.  I also baked it for about 7 mins without the toppings first to get it a little crispier.  Even my boyfriend, who works at a pizza place so never wants pizza, loved it!  Thanks for the awesome recipe!

I too modified this recipe but agree with some others that it is better as a gourmet pizza dough than regular cheese and pepperoni.  Although my 3 year old ate 3 pieces of of the cheese and pepperoni, so he must really like it.  I used all whole wheat flour (3 1/4 cups) and 1 Tbsp of Honey in place of the sugar.  I sprinkled cornmeal on the pizza stone so it wouldn't stick.  I  made a medium cheese and pepperoni and a olive oil garlic base with chicken, tomatoes, green peppers and monterrey jack cheese and it was GREAT!!!  Would highly recommend.

We use this recipe all the time.  It is one of the few things my husband will attempt and I have to say he does a better job with this recipe than I.  We love the texture, taste, and the fact that it uses whole wheat flour.  Sometimes we replace some of the white with even more whole wheat.  I usually add a bit of italian seasoning and garlic pwd when I roll out the crust.  We also use this recipe for calzones.  Yum!

I made this pizza crust last night but modified it a little bit. I didn't use the sugar it calls for in the recipe and I used whole wheat flour only. It turned out absolutely awesome. I had tried other whole wheat pizza crust recipes before and they never quite came out right. I topped the crust with pizza sauce, mozzarella & feta cheese, tomatoes and spinach. Delicious. Thanks so much for the recipe!

We love whole wheat pizza crusts and this is one we will be adding to our list of ones we enjoyed and loved!! We subbed honey for the sugar and pre-baked our crust as others have suggested.  Thanks for a great recipe!! PS..I have been adding 1 Tbsp of vital wheat gluten to this and it comes out nice and fluffy!!

So far so good.  One note, if you pre-cook the crust, prick with a fork so it doen't rize into bubbles.  Let you know when we eat it if it was worth the effort.

Wonderful recipe! I used only whole wheat flour and substituted honey for the sugar as well. While I was kneading, I added in about a tablespoon each of garlic powder, basil, and oregano. It was a hit! While topping the pizza, I spread a homemade garlic butter on the crust, which really brought out the flavor (2 minced garlic cloves, 2 tbsp butter or margarine, splash olive oil, basil, parsley, and oregano).  Even with only whole wheat flour, it still came out light and fluffy! I also cooked it for about 5 minutes before the toppings, that way I could dress the pizza and when the men came in I could throw it in the oven without it getting soggy. Thanks!

This is a very good pizza crust.  It definitely makes more than one crust, and it works best on a pizza stone (gets crunchy throughout).  Don't be shy about adding your favorite herbs to the dough.  Good stuff!

This pizza dough is what it claims to be-- AMAZING! The dough definitely needs to be baked before adding the toppings, though, or it will be flat and gooey.  Bake the dough for about five to seven minutes before adding the toppings.  It's awesome with "Exquisite Pizza Sauce" from this site.

Wow, this was an amazing recipe. The only change we made was to reduce the white flour to 1/2 cup. The texture was exactly how I like it - moist and chewy and a little crispy on the outside. We topped it with Alfredo Light sauce - a recipe from this site - grilled chicken, sauteed broccoli, spinach, low-fat feta and mozzarella cheeses and it was a perfect gourmet, low-calorie meal. Thank-you for this recipe!

This is my favorite whole wheat pizza crust recipe. I make it with all whole wheat and don't use any all purpose flour and it still comes out great.

I didn't split up the dough because I like a thick crust.  Came out wonderful and very filling.  Next time I will probably add some dried herbs in the dough for a little more flavor.

Great but really hearty. My husband is the pizza maker and uses 1 cup whole wheat flour and 2 1/2 cups of all purpose.  Rolls it out very thin because we like a thinner crust. Also to help with a thinner crust, but still get great flavour (and make it simpler) he only lets it stand once, then rolls it out and puts it in the fridge for 15mins to arrest the yeast.  Bake at 500 on pizza pan for 2-3 mins then transfer to pizza stone for 10-12 mins for an awesome, crisp and chewy crust.

These turned out fantastic! I cut the recipe in half since it looked like it would make a lot. I substituted olive oil for the shortening, a pinch of baking soda, and I had to add a little extra water and oil(it may have been my flour was dry), and mixed in with my kitchenaid. The dough seemed a touch stiff, but after resting for about 1 1/2 hours, it rolled out beautifully. The tortillas were paper thin, cooked up light and perfect.I will never buy store bought again!

My wife kept asking me if it was worth all this trouble to make pizza crust. I told her that the reviews for this recipe were all good, so I forged ahead. We were not disappointed. My 6-year-old son proclaimed "You make the best pizza ever dad!" The only thing I added was a teaspoon of pizza seasoning along with the olive oil and salt. We have a 12-inch pizza stone and half of the dough is too much for a stone of this size. Next time I will divide the dough into thirds. Thanks for a great recipe!

This crust was nice and more wholesome than the usual whitecrust we make. We substituted the salt for 1/2 tsp garlic salt mixed with 1/2 tsp salt. Also we added about a tsp each of basil and oregano to the warm water mixture before adding flour. 
We used about 1/3 of the dough to make garlic knots (which were BETTER than the pizza) and the rest for a large thick crust pizza. For the garlic knots, we drizzled them with olive oil mixed with garlic salt and oregano and parseley, baked at 425 for 8-10 minutes on olive oil greased baking sheet, and sprinkled with grated parmesan when hot out of the oven. Dip with marinara, they were delicious!

This is a GREAT recipe for low fat, low carb and low calorie diets.  I like to stretch this out even more by making one medium thin crust pizza, and 2 to 3 personal sized pizzas out of the same recipe.  I prepare all 4 pizzas, but I only bake the big one and then freeze the other 3 for a quick meal later.  (It only takes about 10 min. for the small ones)  I recommend using paper plates to hold the pizza and then cover w/ plastic wrap or foil.

This is the best pizza crust recipe!  I had never made pizza before and I found this recipe to be very easy!  Generally, I am culinarily deficient, and husband and I were both stunned at how great the pizza turned out. The crust was tender and soft.  For several hours after we ate the pizza we kept saying to each other "I can't believe how good that pizza was!"

hubby wanted pizza and I was low on AP flour, so decided to use this.  It was good, a bit bland even after adding some roasted chopped garlic to it.  I think I could have added more salt to the dough.  The dough rose very nicely and it made one large round pizza.  The crust was a nice consistency and with the toppings, it was good. **directions state to add salt to the yeast mixture.  I was taught never to add salt directly to yeast, as it can kill it.  I always add salt to the second cup of flour that I add to the dough.  Allow 2 hours for the rising alone, so it does take a bit longer, but I didn't feel as guilty eating it because of the 'good' carbs.

Easy recipe. We found one recipe enough for 2 pizzas. They were not very fluffy but were very tasty and healthy.
We made a white pizza:
Take 2 tablespoons of EVOO and add one cracked garlic clove and 1/4 red pepper flake and let infuse for 1 hour. Add oil on top of crust with 1/2 cup fontina 1/2 cup mozzerella 1/2 cup cooked diced chicken and 1/2 cup thawed and squeezed dry frozen spinach. YUM!

This was very good. I cut the dough into fourths and made individual pizzas, since everyone in our family likes something different.
I added a teaspoon of Italian seasoning to the liquid before I added the flours. I think it really made this dough a treat and gave it another layer of flavor.

I made this in the bread machine on the dough setting and it worked well.  I added about a 1/2 cup of flour because  of how wet it was, but otherwise I think the recipe is great.  I also prebaked the crust, and am glad I did because it puffed up in the oven.

I have made this recipe 2 times, with no changes to the ingredients, and find it to be outstanding. I mixed the ingredients in a stand mixer and let the dough rise in my convection oven on the bread proofing cycle, which makes it rise very nicely. I found this dough to be slightly less elastic than a white pizza crust and I started tearing small holes when stretching it by hand, so I just used my fingers and pressed the dough on a floured countertop until it was the right size and thickness. This method worked perfectly. A rolling pin also worked just as well, but I liked working the dough with my fingers.  I put the dough on a floured peel and topped it with chili, chopped onions and cheddar cheese, then baked it on a stone at the recommeded temp for about 12-14 minutes and got great results.  I think I will try prebaking the crust for 10 minutes as others suggested, but it wasn't really an issue.  I may also increase the temp, but again, it was fine this way.  The second time I made the crust recipe I topped it with chopped smoked duck, hoisin sauce, scallions and mozzerella for the most amazing peking duck pizza you will ever taste.  This recipe made 3 good sized thin crusts.  I used one of them to make rolls instead of a pizza.  I brushed them with melted margarine and garlic powder, and baked them on the stone for about 15 minutes (I think), and they were absolutely fantastic - so this is a great recipe for more than just pizza.

Okay... I had to try this again. I bought FRESH whole wheat flour and made this a second time. I would rate this 10 stars if I could! Crisp on the outside, chewy on the inside, AMAZING flavour! I have to admit that I used all whole wheat flour instead of some all-purpose (it only requires 3 cups total if using all whole wheat.) The kids loved it, my husband RAVED about it. We are addicted... Paired with the "Exquisite Pizza Sauce " from this site, and you cannot go wrong.

I loved this recipe!  I too used all whole wheat flour, and I added italian spices and parmesan cheese.  It made 3 thin crusts.  I also baked it about 10 minutes first and then added toppings, and then baked another 10-15.  I bet this would make great bread sticks too.

This pizza crust got the big thumbs up from the entire family.  The pizza was too hot to eat so I tore off small bits of the   crust and dipped it in salt.  OMG!  It was absolutelly delicious.  I couldn't believe the kids said it was the best crust I ever made and I make pizza all the time.  This is my new crust recipe!  Thank you for posting it Maria.  Fabulous.

I made this with all whole-wheat flour, no white flour, and it was excellent. I froze half the dough after letting it rise, and used it a week later to make an equally tasty healthy pizza!

This pizza crust works wonderfully! I added about 2 t Italian seasoning and an extra t of salt. Freezing it is no problem either. I made mine and let it rise, then froze it for a couple days. I let in thaw on the counter for about 12 hours and it was ready to go at dinnertime.

I also altered this recipe to my particular diet and tastes, but it was fantastic! It did need more seasoning so I doubled the salt,but I make a vegan pizza with only sauce and veggies so it may not be needed with traditional pizza toppings. 

I also eat low fat so I eliminated the oils. I cook the pizza on parchment paper to make it oil-free nonstick. I also eliminated the all purpose flour and increased the whole wheat. I ended up with 3 1/4 cups of whole wheat flour, more or less may be needed depending on humidity. I swapped out the sugar for honey. A very adaptable recipe anyone can play with and enjoy in good health. It was a breeze to make. Thank you!

Made this crust following the exact recipe and wow! Never gonna make another pizza dough again  besides this one!  Letting it rise for the whole amount of time is crucial for it to come out súper soft and perfectly chewy- conpliment with vegan cheese for a truly healthy and absolutely delicious pizza!

I was pleasantly surprised with this recipe.  I always associated whole wheat pizza dough as being somewhat dense like making whole wheat bread is.  It was delicious.  Same chewy texture as with bread flour ( I used a pizza stone) and I also used all whole wheat.  Awesome.  I was scared to try, but we are going with this recipe from now on

I tried this last night and really enjoyed it, my husband not so much. But, he still is into white bread and doesn't care for wheat anything. I made it the night before and stuck the dough in the fridge for the next night. It was a little bland, but that's the beauty of a base recipe. Next time I will add more salt, garlic, herbs and all wheat flour(since it looks like it will just be me eating it). Very simple to make and so much cheaper than buying the pre-made crust. Thanks!

Made as-is this is a great recipe, but I feel like it is a little bland. Maybe it needs a little honey.

I used honey instead of sugar and all bread flour for this recipe.  I brushed the edges of the crust with grapeseed oil and sparsely sprinkled coarse sea salt on it.  I would also recommend pre-cooking the crust for a few minutes before putting sauce and toppings.  Mine got done in the time but it wasn't a pretty golden color.  It was still crispy even though it did not brown.  I am anxious to try it with my whole wheat flour.

I've ruined a lot of pizzas and I am happy to report that I made two successful pizzas with this recipe!  It's crispy and delicious.  I made the recipe as is according to the directions, but next time I'll try swapping out the white flower.  I like kneading the dough, so I wont be using the machine, but pizza stones are where it's at!  The first one I made was topped with spicy turkey sausage and mushrooms.  The second was topped with uncured bacon and spinach sauted in garlic and chili flakes.  Awesome!

This was very, very good.  I made my dough in the bread machine, with the wet ingredients on bottom.  I put the salt in before the flour to keep it away from the yeast, which was bread machine yeast.  After a couple of attempts I finally omitted the white flour and used 3 1/4 Cups whole-wheat flour, to make it truly "whole wheat".  

I also followed the suggestions I read below to bake at 500 with no toppings, then top the pizza and return to the oven at 425 for 15 minutes.  The texture of the crust was even better that way!

Very good.  We prefer two thin crusts.  It even freezes well.  I make the dough ahead of time and leave it in the refrigerator to thaw in the morning and it is ready by the time I make dinner.

This was soooo good!!! I've probably made it a dozen times since discovering it recently!  I did use honey instead of sugar, all whole wheat flour with 4T of vital wheat gluten and also added some Italian Seasoning to the dough to give it more flavor!

Wonderful pizza crust. Not 100% whole wheat but worth the trade-off for a yummier crust imo. Next time I'll try it with even more whole wheat and see if we like it as much

I used a tablespoon of honey instead of white sugar, and brushed the crust with olive oil, granulated garlic and a little dried basil. I also prebaked it for a couple of minutes before adding the toppings. Turned out great rolled thin. Admittedly it's not a fully whole-wheat recipe, but it's still a lot healthier than a fully white flour recipe and doesn't sacrifice the traditional white flour flavor and texture.

Made as directed and this pizza crust is very good.  I rolled ours out very thin and it held all of our toppings and the taste was very good.  Paired this with "Essanaye's Pizza Sauce" from this site.  We got 2 large pies and everyone (our neighbors too) were very pleased.  Will be making again for sure.

Loved this pizza crust. I used only whole wheat flour and added some seasonings to add flavor. A favorite I discovered is Jamaican Jerk. It's a blend of red pepper flakes, thyme and allspice. Delicious! will make again.

Thank you so much for this pizza dough recipe.  We use it all the time to make pizza for our family.  We keep our flour mixed half/half whole wheat and white all the time, so that is the only difference.

Wow what an amazing dough recipe, I peferred to use all whole wheat flour so I followed the reviews and used 31/4 of flour. It was excellent tasting, and making it with the electric stand mixer did all the work for me.

This is a light and absolutely delicious crust.  I loved the taste that the whole wheat brings to the pizza.  I have made it as is and have subbed all whole wheat flour and both ways it is delicious.  I usually just throw everything in the bread machine and it turns out absolutely perfect.  A definite keeper in our house!

This took more time that what I had originally planned on, but it was worth the wait!  This makes a delightfully tasty crust that you can also feel pretty good about serving your family.  1/4 cup of whole wheat flour has 6 grams of fiber!  Yay!

I liked it the first time I made it but I did think it was a bit bland.  I use brown sugar instead of white and I add pepper, garlic powder and minced onion flakes to it.  I actually make mini pizzas and freeze them so I can have something quick and easy after a long day.  The crust is pretty dense but that is good because my sauce is very wet and heavy.

Wonderful pizza dough! I made this recipe and it was enough for two pizzas (the extra dough kept in the freezer just fine). It was thin and crispy, but not dry at all. I pre-baked the crust for 10 minutes without toppings and then backed for another 12 minutes with the toppings.

I make this using only whole wheat flour (just over 3 cups), and it is, as promised- amazing. We rarely use store-bought crust anymore, I try to always have a couple dough balls in the freezer! I've made it dozens of times and it's So easy and perfect.

great pizza crust.  I substitute Ultragrain Flour (in stores under the Eagle Mills Brand) that has 100% whole wheat nutritionals but it more like your traditional white flour and sweeter in taste than whole wheat.

For the size of pizza I make (~18x13 inches) I find that using 3/4 of the dough makes a crust that is not too thick. It remains soft on the inside yet still crispy on the outside.  I also tend to increase the amount of yeast so that the rising process is a bit faster.

I really enjoyed this recipe.  I felt the crust did taste good.  Definitely need to be careful to over pack w/ toppings because it can make the crust a bit soggy.  If you plan on freezing the crust for future use, make sure to roll it out and freeze it.  Otherwise, it may turn out very dry.

loved this recipe! I used a pizza stone and it came out great! I did add 1tsp each of crushed garlic, oregano, & basil to the olive oil & salt mixture before the first rise. Thank you for this healthier option! I'm making it again tonight :)

I've made a ton of bread with similar ingredients and this just wasn't that good.  If you want healthy pizza make this a thin crust and use a higher fat content for a yummy flavor.

Hands down, the best pizza crust I have ever had! But this could also be due to the fact that this is my first homemade crust. Amazing!! And so easy to make.

Excellent!  I made with 3 1/4 C of whole wheat flour and added rosemary and garlic powder to dough.  This dough was excellent, will be making again.

We ALL loved this crust ... I did all whole wheat flour (3 1/4 cups) to make it a true whole wheat crust. It was also a hit for a playdate of 6 boys ... so I would say it is amazing!

I'm a beginner baker and I'm pretty lousy. I made a variation of this where I used 2 cups of bread flour and 1.5 cups of whole wheat flour. I used the dough to make calzones. It was FABULOUS! Thank you! This one is a keeper!

I modified it using 3 cups of whole wheat flour and then 1/2 cups when I was kneading it. Absolutely delicious and super easy to make! If you blind bake it for 10 minutes without topping, you can save the crust for another time. Also, using a pizza stone helps the crust become lighter and chewier.

I have made this twice and think it is very good.  I am just impressed that I actually made this and it was edible.  I think I will try some of the other suggestions on here in the future when I make this.  It's a little bland.

A healthier option, but one that was too dense and tasted too bitter for me to ever make again.  The recipe makes a lot of dough, but I was hoping for better flavor.

I'm used to making pizza dough that you only let rise once, so I don't like the 2nd rising time this recipe.  I made it exactly as stated and found it rather dry and not particularly tasty.

I advise to NOT preheat the crust as others have suggested. By the time my sausage was cooked and the tomatoe sause was bubbly, the bottom of the crust was hard. I had to reuse my topping mixture and through the rest away.  Next try I'm going to roll it really thin and not preheat it.

Great recipe and easy to make.  I wasn't able to use a bread machine like others on here, but I followed the directions and it turn out perfect.  I agree with folks who have reviewed that honey and some extra spices like dried basil and oregano make a huge difference.  I grilled this on one side, added my ingredients on the side just grilled, then finished off the other side.  My wife and I loved it!

Sweet recipe. My family loved it =) I paired it with the Pizza without Red sauce recipe and the family loved it!!!! I also took the reviewers suggestion and prebaked my crust. Thank you for a wonderful recipe, I no longer have to search for a good one =)

Meh.  I went with all whole wheat and it turned out okay, but it did not have the texture of pizza crust.  I have a feeling it was due to using all whole wheat flour.  I think the next time I make it I will try it with the white/wheat mix.  I'll post if it turns out better.

Really good recipe. I used it to make one pizza and dough was too thick will definately divide it next time. I also used all wheat flour and still turned out great.

Great dough, easy to make. I make this dough for pizza at least once a month, especially with turkey pepperoni and/or turkey Italian Sausage. You end up with a great pizza that's roughly about 250 calories per slice.

This was okay - it rose pretty well but I think it was too thick for one crust. I prefer the Whole Wheat and Honey Pizza Dough recipe.   I made it with teriyaki chicken (Teriyaki Chicken Pizza), but next time I would go with barbecue.

I have tried many reipes for whole wheat pizza dough, and was ready to give up.  Now that I found this recipe I will make it over and over again.  I modiefied by using all whole wheat flour and adding one talbe spoon of vital wheat gluten.  I precooked the crust for 5 minutes at 500 degrees for 5 minutes, then topped and baked for 14 minutes at 425 degrees.  Results were OUTSTANDING!

I made this recipe using on whole wheat flour, and I cut the recipe in half to make just one thin crust pizza - its really awesome.  I added some minced garlic to my dough along with italian seasonings.  It's great the day you make it - but doesn't make good for "morning" pizza.

The first time I made this I did not have all the correct ingredients, I made some substitutions. It was ok, but not great. The next time I had all the right supplies and followed the directions exactly. It turned out "perfect". It was the best pizza crust we ever had. I have made it several times since. This is a real "keeper".

VERY good pizzas crust, but like other reviewers have mentioned, it is not WHOLE wheat.  I made this with the reviewers' suggestion of replacing the all-purpose flour with whole wheat, using 3-1/4 cups total.  I also added a bit of dried Italian seasoning to the dough.  I didn't prebake the crust as some reviewers suggested because I use a pizza stone.  I put the unbaked crust on the preheated stone, topped pizza and baked for 10-15 minutes (depending on thickness of the crust).  Yummy!

It's definitely amazing! It's the first time I make pizza dough and I'll be making this every weekend! It was so good! I divided the dough in 2, made one large thin crust (close to 16 in) and froze the other one. Topped it off with Easy Pizza Sauce III, cheese, lots and lots of veggies and turkey bacon. The only change was to add some dried basil and parsley to the dough. IT is so so good! My hubby was so impressed!

Great recipe! I made it with the exact ingredients. Perfect for freezing! I usually form out two crusts after letting the dough rise for the first time, and then I'll just put them on a baking sheet in the freezer. When frozen, I take them back out, wrap them up, and put them back. Then, when I want a pizza, all I have to do is take out the already formed crust, put on toppings of my choice and pop it in the oven! No need to let it thaw!

This recipe was fantastic!! I also used all whole wheat flour and it was great. Instead of putting the pizza in the oven to bake. I put it on the BBBQ grill and it was awesome! I will never put pizza in the oven again.

This is the best whole wheat pizza crust I have ever had!  If you do use it to make just one pizza make sure you have a pan big enough for it. :)  It makes a big pizza that is absolutely fabulous!  I put corn meal on my pan instead of oil and it worked great keeping the crust from sticking

Nice recipe! I used the 3 1/4 wheat flour readers suggested. It worked out great. For healthy minded people, this recipe is a nice one. We made a fantastic veggie pizza with the thinner crust.

This is a good basic wheat crust.  I followed the recipe with one exception, instead of using all purpose flour I used bread flour. The dough is very easy to manipulate into the shape you want and we always have bunches of leftovers since the whole wheat makes it more filling.  One tip for rising, I live in an old house that is on the cool side so I use my oven to help the dougn rise; while mixing the dough I warm the oven then turn it off let it cool a littleso its warmer than room temp and then put the dough inside the warm(ish) oven; I've also used a cabinet with another bowl filled with hot/warm water.  Both provide a warmer than room temp for rising (but not hot enough to cook at all) since bread rises best at 75-85*F.

This is great and so easy.  The only set back is it does not reheat well.  It tastes excellent straight from the oven.  My family loves it.  This is how I get to give them healthy foods.

This crust was soooo good. I made a double batch and froze the remaining three dough balls. Later I just moved them from the freezer to the fridge and they were just as good the next time as the first. It was a good amount of work since I don't have a bread machine but if you make a few at a time you end up with some quick mid week dinners later.

I haven't made pizza crust in a few years, only because I was frustrated as other recipes just didn't do it for me.  This one was PERFECT! I got 2 thin crust pizzas out of it.   I also followed other reviewers advice and baked it at 500 for 5 minutes before adding the toppings.  The result was great!

I baked the crust with a little olive oil first for about 15 minutes (until it was firm and golden!)... then added the toppings and baked again until the cheese was golden and bubbling.  I have used this crust twice and cannot get enough of it!  The extra bake time makes the crust crispy.  Even though the crust is crispy, the inside is fluffy and light!  AWESOME!

Best whole wheat pizza recipe I could find.  I actually replaced the sugar with honey and used 3 cups of whole wheat flour and no white flour.  It was a little dry though so a little more sauce on the pizza make it more moist and easier to swallow.  Overall a great recipe.

I've used this recipe several times now and we really like it. I've followed the directions exactly and I've tried using all wheat flour. Both turn out very well. I usually brush the outer edge of the crust with olive oil halfway through baking. Thank you, I'll continue to use this recipe regularly. :)

I added about 1/2 cup to 1 cup of wheat bran to the dough, lots of fresh basil and some dried  oregano and parsley. I baked it for a few minutes at 500ish and topped it with a bunch of red, green and yellow peppers, onions and basil with some feta cheese and Gimme Lean sausage. I didn't bother letting the dough rise at all and the crust was still soft and chewy with really good flavor.

First of all, I used 3-1/4 cups of whole wheat (no all-purpose) flour for the recipe.

I found that this recipe did NOT yield enough dough for 2 amply-sized thin crust pizzas.  My pizza stone is about 14" in diameter and when I rolled out my halved thin crust pizza dough, the dough was pretty much like a cracker and the crust not too far from that description.  Next time, I will not half the dough even for a thin crust.

I baked the pizzas both ways.  1) baking at 500 for a few minutes then adding the ingredients and baking at 425 until the cheese was melted, etc. 2) baking at 350 for about 20 minutes.  Given the amount of toppings I used, I found that the traditional #2 method worked better for me, although not by much.

I couldn't even compare this to a regular white crust made with bread flour, but seeing as I was looking for a healthy alternative, the whole wheat crust sufficed (by taste, not texture).  Next time I will definitely use the whole lot in one 14" pizza.

sooooo good!!!!!!  I just put everything in my bread machine and I was impressed that I didn't have to add any more flour/liquid--the proportions are perfect as written!  I made individual roll-up appetizers today (filled them with a spanakopita filling from this site) and I'm planning on making pizza tomorrow.  thank you for this great recipe!!!

I used the dough cycle on my bread machine and it turned out great.  I made one thick crust but will try 2 thin crusts next time.  Thanks for a great recipe.

This pizza crust was very tasty.  The "Ready In" time is wrong, as it doesn't take into account all the rising times.  but, if you are baking this on a  stone, then you don't need to let it rise at all, it rises in the oven.

Although it wasn't as crispy as we like, we really enjoyed the taste of this crust and the fact that it was healthy. The ingredient proportions were excellent, although I used just slightly less flour, and the dough was easy to handle. Per the suggestions of previous reviewers, I used honey in place of sugar and added a heaping tablespoon of ground flaxseed. A good, basic recipe that I will use again.

I've never made anything with yeast from scratch before. I was emboldened to try it after the rave reviews. My family and I were not disappointed and would like to try it again sometime. I'm grateful for the other reviewers who mentioned using a dough mixing attachment on the food processor (I used the attachment for the hand mixer) and that it DOES take 2 hours for the dough to rise. The best topping we added was ham cubes with chopped pineapple - yum!

Followed the recipe exactly but allowed about an hour and a half to 2 hrs for dough to rise. If you are a fan of thicker crust pizzas this recipe is great. :)

"amazing" is definitely the right word to describe this crust! it is so delicious and healthy, but it doesn't have that really chewy, bland taste that some whole wheat breads tend to take on; therefore my picky little sister will even eat it! i usually double this and then make a lot more crusts than the recipe says. you can press it out pretty thin, and it still poofs up relatively nicely when baking. it's the perfect base for creating any sort of pizza. delish!!!!

This really was amazing!  I added some dried basil and oregeno to the crust for a little extra flavor.  It tasted wonderful.  Possibly the best pizza I've ever had.  Great recipe!

I made this pizza crust for my birthday party where we made homemade pizza.  I made the crust in the morning and then put it in the fridge until we needed it.  It was fantastic!  It baked up nice and light and I spent the rest of the night handing out recipes!

Turns out great.  I even usually skip the 45 minute rise.  I just make the one thick crust and spread it in my pan and start topping it right away.  Comes out great.
This is our favorite pizza dough.

Easy to make. Divided the dough in half to freeze one portion. My "circle" was ~12 inches in diameter. Great texture and moist.  I did brush olive oil on the crust.

I used this recipe as the dough for the "Bierrocks II" submitted by Laurel.  The original recipe serving size of both recipes turns out to be the perfect amount to make 6-7 Bierrocks!  I used only whole wheat flour, it turned out great. thanks

Well my 3, almost 4, year old is eating her 3rd piece!  We enjoyed this pizza crust at our house.  I used the dough cycle on my bread maker and did pre-cook the crust for about 8 minutes before adding our toppings and then cooked for about 10 minutes more, on a pizza stone.  Made two pizzas.  Next time I will try putting some spices or garlic in the crust but I thought the flavor was just fine.  It was more filling than regular pizza.

Did notice that the "Ready in" time approx is off, you have to add in the time for rising of the dough.

Very Good Recipe! My only suggestion would be to add some seasonings to the crust. It can be a little bland if you don't. We had a thin and thicker crust and preferred the thin crust. I did prebake the crust for 8 minutes before adding the toppings! Thanks for the recipe. I will definetly make this again.

This crust was truly amazing.  The only thing I changed was that I added 4 tbsp of italian seasoning to the dough and it was fantastic.  I prefer a thin crust and half the recipe is perfect for a thin crust.

I did not find this crust to be chewy or crispy.  It had a uniform consistency inside and out, and it was more similar to bread than to other pizza crusts that I have had.  I also did not like the flavor.  I think that the taste of the wheat flour was overpowering.  The recipe was still edible because the rest of the toppings masked the taste that I did not like, but I didn't eat the crust by itself after my initial taste.

This is the best whole wheat crust I've made to date.  I went ahead and put it in my bread machine, on the dough cycle.  Turned out really nice.  I used this recipe for the crust on the BBQ Chicken Pizza, and it was really yummy.  This crust came out a little thicker than pizza bought at the store, but we thought it was really filling that way, and it wasn't too doughy or super thick, just right for us.

I always get a bit hesitant when making pizza dough/crust....the first time I attempted to do this (not using this recipe), I used all whole wheat flour and I believe I didn't have the right water temperature to let the yeast sit; I also hadn't added a sweetener to the yeast/water. That dough came out with a "bite" to it. 

This recipe is fabulous and very foundational. I followed many of the commenters' adjustments--I did all whole wheat (3 1/4 c.) and substituted sugar for honey. Even dividing this recipe in half, the one-half pizza dough is enough to create a medium-crust pizza.

It's essential to pre-bake the dough before putting toppings on it. Put the oven at 500 F, oil your pan lightly, and put the flattened dough on top. I would suggest taking a pastry brush and lightly brushing the dough with olive oil. This ensures the pizza will not become soggy, esp. if you put a ton of toppings on it--like me! I also stuff my crusts--diced/minced garlic and diced cilantro along the pre-oiled edges and fold over. Creates a layer and depth of flavor that complements toppings. Take crust out w/n 6 mins, lower oven temp to 450 F, layer your toppings and put pizza back in oven. 

Also, I decided to freeze the second half of the dough for later use --just pat it/knead it down after 2nd time letting it sit, wrap it in saran wrap and put it in a freezer baggy. Cuts down a lot of time for the future! 

Likely to put this recipe in my toolbox.

It was my first time making pizza from scratch. This recipe is amazing and easy to make. I wanted to make a thin pizza so I used only half the dough and saved the other half in the fridge for future use. The wheat pizza crust was easy to roll and the crust turned out perfectly! The crust is slightly crunchy on the edge and soft and chewy inside. I will try this recipe again using my dough hook next time. Also I may use only a third of the dough next time to see if the crust will turn crunchy. 

If this is the only pizza crust recipe you want to try, this recipe is the one for you! It is  a wheat crust so it is tasty and healthy for your whole family too!

I have made this many times. My whole family loves it. I like it just the way it is. Our new favorite is to split the dough in two and use half of the dough to make breadsticks. I make the Cheese Dipping Sauce (with some modifications) from this site to go along with it. The only problem I have is I can't help but eat to much!

Awesome! This was my first time making pizza dough, and I've always been a fan of the whole wheat stuff. My boyfriend loves it. I used Just 1 cup of all-purpose flour and subbed an extra (just under) half a cup of whole wheat for the remaining AP. I bake at 425F for 16 minutes, then broiled on low for another four minutes. My crust was medium thickness. I like thin but I was too lazy to put the work into making it thinner, plus I had already rationed out the dough and that's the size that allowed two pizzas to fit on one baking sheet. I do not have a pizza stone, but after having this pizza I just don't see the need.

I have made this dough a few times. I like to substitute the sugar for a bit of honey also sometimes switching out the water for a little beer.. I throw cooked chicken and the works on my pizza and top it with mozzarella. It always turns out amazing!

OMG! This is the recipe I was always looking for!!! As many others I skipped the all-purpose flour and used whole wheat flour only and added garlic powder, dried basil leaves and dried oregano to the dough. Absolutely fantastic. We made one thin crust pizza and one smaller deep dish pizza. The edges of the thin crust were crispy and even had those bubble holes, which tipped of my excitement. This will be the only recipe we will use from now on. Baking times and temperatures worked also great on our oven.

I really like this recipe, it is the best whole wheat pizza crust I have found.  I made it as written in my bread maker, had to add more flour and I did pre-cook the crust a bit as suggested by others.  I froze some of the dough and it was just as good as fresh.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was GREAT!  Used all whole wheat flour, added 1 teaspoon extra salt, and a healthy teaspoon of Italian seasoning--next time I'll add more Italian seasoning. Did as others suggested and pre-baked the crust for 5 minutes--but be forewarned, I had to puncture it before adding toppings because it puffed up like a pillow! My husband loved it, and so did I.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This is the first and only pizza dough recipe I have ever used and will ever use!! Its absolutely fantastic. Hands down. Like other users, I made this recipe 100% whole wheat by using white whole wheat for the full 3 1/2 cups. It's truly a lovely recipe. We grill our pizza and don't bake it, and it turns out great everytime!

I've been searching for a good whole wheat pizza crust and this is it!  I followed the directions exactly, except I let mine rise for a bit longer (hour and a half.)  This made a lovely crust that was nice and light, especially for whole wheat.  Yummy!

Meh. Tasted like a whole wheat crust to me, and it was hard all the way through, definitely not soft and chewy on the inside. Probably won't try this one again.

great recipe, dough turns out very consistent and moist.  only tweak i would suggest is adding the salt to the all purpose flour instead of mixing it in with the water/sugar/yeast directly.  although everything is being mixed together right after this step, the salt may deactivate some of the yeast, leaving your dough dense and lowering your yeild.

It was my first attempt at making pizza from scratch and I wanted to keep it healthy. I must say the recipe instructions were simple to follow and the pizzas came out just the way I wanted. I only substituted honey for sugar.This will be my go to recipe.

I've made this recipe many times, and I always wind up using 3 or more cups of all-purpose flour.  It's simply too soupy for the 2 cups of whole wheat and 1 1/2 cups all purpose.  There's no way you could knead this dough. Don't get me wrong, it's delicious and makes great crust, but I simply don't understand how it could be made as written.

I followed the recipe, and it gave me a nice thick crust by only doing one ball. The crust tasted excellent. The only con I had was step 3 which was unclear what to do with the dough after separating it or leaving it as one ball. So, I just put it back into the bowl lubricated with olive oil and let it sit for another 45 minutes. Other than that, perfect recipe and excellent crust!

Excellent recipe! After reading other reviews, I decided to cut the recipe in half. I'm glad I did because it made two large sized thin crust pizzas. This was a very easy recipe and I will defintely use this as my only pizza dough recipe from now on. Thanks!!

I was trying to imitate Trader Joe's pesto pizza and this crust was a great start.  I love a thin crispy crust so next time I'll divide the dough into thirds, partially bake it without toppings, then finish it off directly on the oven rack.  I used the pesto recipe from  this site made with my garden pesto.  Topped it with mozzarella, fresh tomato slices and pre-steamed broccoli.  Very delish.

Perfect!  I used all whole wheat flour (3 cups), then kneaded about 1/4-1/2 cup of flour into the dough after it rose.   Flattened into on big thick crust, baked 5 min at 425, then 15 min with toppings on.  It was so good!

Yeast requires the nutrients found in sugar to properly form. Therefore, using a sugar subsitute will not work. 
"@sblackwood1 I was not pleased with this crust. I followed the recipe to the letter except I substituted a teaspoon of Stevia for the sugar. :("

YUMMY! I have never made pizza dough from scratch before, but have tried several times to make bread, but it has never turned out right. I was skeptical about attempting this..... It was SUPER easy and tasted terrific!  I used my Kitchenaid to mix the ingredients and "knead" the dough and followed the recipe exactly. The dough came out PERFECTLY! I don't have a pizza pan so I used a Pampered Chef 9" shallow round stone pan. I rolled the dough out to fit the bottom only of the pan, then added my toppings. I made BBQ chicken pizza. My whole family loved it!! I will be making pizza from scratch from now on!

Soft and flavorful whole wheat crust.  White whole wheat flour makes the WW flavor milder.  We divided the recipe into fourths for calzones that easily serve 2 a piece.  (Baked on a pizza stone at 500 convection for 7 minutes).  It is a softer dough than many pizza doughs I have worked with, and more fragile too, so handle with care.

My first time making pizza dough, and it was perfect.  I made to semi thin crusts that fit on my pampered chef pizza stone.  Parchment paper on top of the stone worked like a charm!  I per baked crust for 12 min first.

used all whole wheat flour, would like to try it again with with ratio. All whole wheat flour makes it taste really healthy. But sometimes when you have pizza its a treat and supposed to be fun :) if you know what I mean. even with the ratio of flours, its still way healthier than deliverry, because you can dictate all the healthy topings you put on top

Added garlic powder, italian seasoning and basil.  Used all whole wheat flour instead of all-purpose. Topped it with pizza sauce, chicken, artichoke hearts, red onions, black olives, spinach and cheese.  My husband said it was the best pizza he has ever had!

Delicious!!! Crispy, tasty, absolutely wouldn't change a thing! Made 2 thin crusts with mozzarella, cheddar, black olives, mushrooms, green peppers, onions, and diced tomatoes, topped with garlic, pepper, and basil. Soooooooo good. My boyfriend and I agreed its the best pizza either of us have ever had!

Amazing! I do like the other reviews suggest and use all whole wheat flour and honey instead of sugar. I also added 1 tbsp of basil and 1/2 tbsp of oregano to the crust. Yum!

What I liked best about this recipe is that the directions are very simple. It has basic ingredients, which can be found at the local market, and also instructions that are simple to follow as one, two, and three. It is a fast recipe that produces a yummy crust that can be topped with anything from mushrooms to pineapples. Now, when making the pizza dough I ran into a couple small snags. I was getting the yeast ready, and ended up making my water too hot, which then killed the yeast. The water needs to be around 110 degrees to activate the yeast. If you don’t have a thermometer just heat the water until it is warm, but not scolding hot. Another thing is that I didn’t use all of the white flour the recipe called for. I used about 2/3 cups for my flour when mixing, because if I had added any more it would have made the dough dry. It is good to keep the dough a little moist. I discovered the best way to tell when it is ready, is when it doesn’t stick to my hands when kneading it. I would suggest watching the dough closely, so that too much flour doesn’t get added. The last issue is the timing. I cooked the pizza at 350 for 20 minutes, and it came out well done the recipe said; cook it at 425 for 20 minutes, which would have left the pizza burnt. I strongly suggest you keep to 350 and ignore the 425. If it doesn’t cook all the way in 20 minutes just leave it in for a few minutes longer. I toped my pizza with mozzarella cheese, pepperonis, pineapple and spinach and I loved it!

Amazing whole wheat crust recipe!  I have never made homemade pizza, but dying to try it.  We used all organic ingredients and followed the recipe to a tee, using half of the recipe for the thinner crust.  We topped it with grilled eggplant, roasted Roma tomatoes and red onion, and a sprinkling of parmesan and Italian seasoning.  Delicious!  The crust held together beautifully for a thin crust and was golden brown on the bottom.  Nice light whole wheat taste.  It's exciting to know we have another crust in the freezer!  We can't wait to have a few friends over for pizza, wine, and movie night!

This is a great recipe.  I made it exactly as written and it is a very good dough.  I make 3 pizzas out of it.  I also roll it out over corn meal the last time before I stretch out and it adds a great texture, but it is great make it as is too.  The only down is that it has to be a weekend meal because it takes a long time to rise, but hey it's dough what can you do.

I followed recommendations for only whole wheat flour (3 1/4 - 3 1/2 cups) and used maple syrup since I didn't have sugar and the yeast reacted just the same! I added a handful of fresh chopped Italian herbs from the garden and it made the crust! We split into two balls and made a pizza out of one with a garlic cream sauce, loads of veges, and chicken sauteed in pesto. Precooked at 500 for 5 min then added ingredients and cooked for another 20 min at 425.  With the other, we made the yummiest, easiest bread sticks slathered in olive oil to give a crispy outside. With the herbs in the bread they were great even without anything else. I don't think I've seen my boyfriend so speechless over something so simple. This one went in the recipe box as a keeper.

I made a thick crust with this and am trying a thin crust this time (its rising right now). The changes I made are using all whole wheat flour, adding 3TBS ground flax, doubling the oil and this time I threw in some basil and oregano. It's really yummy but I found the thick crust a little bready. I'm also going to bake it for 5 mins before putting the toppings on this time.

You definitely must bake this pizza crust before putting toppings on it. I baked mine for 10 minutes and it still wasn't enough, I'd recommend at least 15. I think this recipe has potential to be amazing as long as its not doughy in the center like mine. :)

My partner is a picky eater and use to the white bread pizza, but this seems to be a smash. Using the other reviews to make a 100% whole wheat pizza. I recommend doing a thin crust with this pizza, the flavors all seem to mesh better without one canceling out the other . The thick crust was just a little to much , but thats just my personal opinion

Made for lunch today, everybody loved it. My teen sis hates when my mom makes anything with 100% or any W wheat. I made this useing only WW and even she gobbled it up! My 2 year old loved it too and he's picky. I used honey instead of sugar and 1 tbls of italian season and 1 tsp of oregono.

I am making this recipe for the second time. Found it to be very palatable following the recipe as given. Would like to note that I froze some of the dough to use later and it WAS BETTER (texture) than when fresh. I cut this recipe into 6 loaves since I cook for one and it is very neutral in flavor for accommodating ANY toppings.

Love this crust - it is easy and comes out perfect every time. I only let it rise the one time, once I split it into 2 I roll it out. Also, I highly recommend King Arthur whole wheat flour, and I use their Whole Wheat White instead of white flour so that it is 100% whole wheat.

This pizza crust is delicious.  I really adore this recipe.  Now I can make pizza healthier by using whole wheat flour as opposed to white.  From now on, I'm always using this pizza crust recipe.

I went by the instructions except for I used my bread machine and added 2tsp of garlic powder to the recipe. The dough was very sticky but not too hard to work with once I put shortening on my hands. I made it into two thin crust pizzas and they came out pretty good. We like our crust well done (see picture) and it came out well done AND not rock hard. Thank you!

Just the wheat crust I've been looking for!  Came out perfect.  I did add oregano and basil to the crust and it was just wonderful!

I've been making pizza since I was ten years old with the same recipe. When I came across this recipe I decided to give it a try and I'm glad I did. It was amazing. Easily the best pizza I've ever had. No complaints. My husband and son couldn't get enough for dinner tonight. Great recipe, thanks Marla : )

Made this with the single substitution of honey instead of sugar.  It truly is amazing, well worth the wait for rise time.  Thanks for sharing it.

I made half the dough into a pizza and half into a calzone.  The pizza was a bit dry...I made it like the other reviewers said-all wheat dough and precooked it..the flavor was still great though.  The calzone I made though was fabulous!  the dough was perfect and the flavor was great too!

Thought this was okay.  I used only whole wheat flour and next time, I would probably try the recipe but with a different type of flour.

This was awesome!!  The only change I made was, adding extra sugar and some spices.  We like the dough a bit sweeter, so I used 2 tbsps, plus added some parmesan cheese and italian seasoning to my flour.  When it rose the first time (didn't turn it out, left it in the bowl), I cut it in half, rolled it out, and put it on a 9x13 pan (lined with parchment paper to cut back on fat) and then let them rise again.  Then dressed them all up.  Baked at 425, for about 15 mins or so, until the sides were nicely browned.  Make sure to let sit about 5 mins before cutting into it.  I made a mean BBQ Chicken pizza with it!!  LOL

Great! Took a while to cook but well worth it. I hosted a make your own pizza night and got great reviews from all my guests. I topped my pizza with a pesto base, chicken breast, feta, pineapple and skim milk mozzarella! So good.

We like this so much we make it 2x a week. I also use solely whole wheat flour (a little under 3 1/4 cups total) and add 1/2 tsp garlic salt and italian seasoning. I brush the crust lightly with oil before baking. It makes a good size pizza that is healthier and more economical!

I needed a pizza crust for frozen pizzas for my hungry son as I am working on avoiding store bought. I made this dough, quartered it, prebaked it for five minutes, topped it, froze it and they are perfect! Just the right size for a meal or snack. He loves them!

This pizza crust really was "amazing!"  I added about 1/3 c flour because I am at a high altitude and cooked in 25 degrees cooler, but for a longer period of time.  This will be my new go-to

Crust was DELICIOUS!  It was perfect...soft and chewy.  Went great with the toppings I used, which were mushrooms, red and yellow bell peppers, grilled chicken breast pieces, and fresh basil.  My whole family loved it...My kids even ate the crust parts of the pizza slices, which they usually leave on their plates.  Will make this again!

I love to make pizzas at home, and usually I buy pre-made crusts... from now on I will be making this crust instead! It was a bit of work, but the crust turned out perfectly thin and crispy. I oiled the pizza pans and dusted them with ground flax to prevent the dough from sticking. I also used a tsp of honey rather than white sugar. My boyfriend and I are huge pizza fans, and he raved about this crust so much, that I made another batch the very next day to freeze and have on hand. Excellent recipe!

Really liked this.  Like others I used all whole wheat flour and based on other reviews should have cut back the flour a bit since it was all whole wheat.  Regardless, I added a little more water and it turned out fine.  It will make 2 crusts, I baked one and froze the other.

LOVED this!  I used ALL wheat flour and honey instead of sugar, and it was a huge crowd pleaser!  I made 6 different kinds (broc and feta/ chicken and red onions on vodka sauce/ mushrooms, spinach, pesto on Alfredo/ pepperoni/sausage and fresh oregano/ tom, basil and smoked mozzarella).  I made 2 batches of dough and most of the pizzas were a personal size.  Great recipe, easy to make (I don't have a bread maker, and I had never made bread on my own before), and pretty cheap to make as well.  I will certainly be making this again! :)

I'm a fan of this recipe but I altered it in the same manner that the first reviewer did only using whole wheat flour and doubling the salt.  I just ate a healthy and delicious pizza for dinner.

I used my Kitchen Aid to make this crust. I doubled the recipe for two seperate pizza recipes and used all whole wheat flour and honey instead of sugar. I thought that these crusts were pretty good, though I think I need a little practice on how to make them more visually appealing. My family was less than thrilled but hey, it's healthier and cheaper than take out. I'd use this again, though I would use one recipe for two thin-crust recipes because I want to lower my carb intake. As is, it came out more like bread with toppings and it was a bit too much.

This was a very good pizza crust.  We made two pizzas out of it, cheese and margarita, they were both medium size, but the dough tasted really good.  I browned it before I put on the toppings.

Very good!  Has a nice bistro pizza flavor.  I put this on the dough setting in the bread maker and subbed honey for sugar and added 1 tsp of Italian seasoning.  I used King Arthur flours.  I did preheat as others suggested before adding toppings and it came out great!  After making 1 pizza, I still have more than enough dough for 1 regular or 2 personal pizzas.

I used all whole wheat flour instead of the mix. Turned out awesome. I froze half of the dough for later use, just thawed for a couple hours, just enough that I was able to roll it out. Will make again

We love it! I have to add probably close to a cup of flour when kneading it because it's so sticky. I use all organic stuff, and I even substitute honey for sugar or organic cane sugar for sugar. No complaints!

This crust is a hit in our house.  I don't think I'll try any more recipes.  We do have to bake it for a little longer than the recipe suggests, but I think that's typical on stoneware.

Amazing!! Right out of the oven into my familiys mouths!!! But I used 3 1/4 whole wheat flour to make it more healthy....You can't even notice! This recipe made about two thin crust pizzas, but beware to check on it repeatadly.

I think it's an excellent, flavourful pizza crust that crisps up nicely on a pizza stone or perforated pizza pan at 425°F-450°F for 15-20 minutes.   I make the dough in a bread machine on a dough setting so it's super easy. The mixing and rising are taken care of while go about other things. I find it's enough dough for two 12 to 14 inch pizzas.  I couple it with the recipe for Exquisite Pizza Sauce by Angie Gorkoff on this site and I'm off to the races.  Both recipes are easy and very good.

My family of picky eaters LOVES this pizza crust! We haven't altered the recipe whatsoever, but I can see that basic dough has a lot of potential for different versions. Thank you!

This recipe came out great. So delicious. I stuck with the recipe because my husband is not too fond of whole wheat but when he tasted it he loved it. I will definately keep this as my pizza night recipe.

This was very tasty and easy to roll out into a nice thin crust.  I did prebake it for 5 minutes before adding toppings and it came out crispy

I halved the dough.  It didn't turn out as crispy as I would have liked.  I plan to bake it again and try putting the dough on my pizza stone after it has preheated in the oven.  Froze the 2nd half of the dough.  We'll see how it thaws.

I really liked this recipe!  Once the toppings are on the crust, you can't tell that it is wheat!  I used all whole wheat flour and it was great!  Very easy and the dough was easy to work with, too.  Now, I won't have to feel bad for eating pizza!  :)

This was an amazing wheat pizza crust. I mixed it in my bread machine and added 4 tsp vital wheat gluten although I think it would have risen well without it. It made one big batch of dough. I split it in half and refrigerated it to make during the work week. It was amazing. I think next time I will skip the all purpose flour and go 100% whole wheat with the vital wheat gluten to help it rise. Thanks Maria for such a great recipe.

I think the texture is good but I did't like the taste. may be it needs a special sauce ( not the traditional pizza sauce ) and creative toppings to make it taste much better, I love the whole wheat bread but I did't like a whole wheat pizza crust.

My hubby and I love this crust!  So easy and good!  I bake just the crust at 500 degrees for 6-7 minutes, then add toppings, turn the heat to 425, and bake another 12-15 minutes.  We make this typically about every-other week.

I made this months ago but didn't rate it because I dinked around with the recipe too much trying to make it "WHOLE" Wheat Pizza Dough... and it wouldn't have been fair to the author of the recipe to hack it to pieces and then rate it.... but lo and behold, I made this for pizza night a few days ago....as written... and it was excellent... my kids even noted how much better this was than my lame-o attempt (love ya guys!)... it wasn't "that lame".... this is just more like "real" pizza to them.  I agree... it is not "whole wheat" without the only flour being 100% whole wheat... but beyond the title, I give this five stars as written and will turn to this recipe again!  Thanks for sharing!!

Great crust! I prefer bread flour to all-purpose in pizza crusts, 00 would be even better though. Also good if you add some herbs to the dough.

I too decided to use all ww flour and it turned out great.  I also added garlic powder to the dough and it gave it a really nice kick.  Definitely will use this recipe again.  Now for the pizza, that's a whole other story....

I was honestly a little worried I wouldn't ever be able to make my own pizza dough cause I don't have any types of machines but this recipe was indeed amazing and so easy. I did only use 100% whole wheat because like others I want the good healthy stuff and I also added pizza seasoning to it. Turned out really yummy as both a Hawaiian (red sauce, Canadian bacon, pineapple) and a more of a Mediterranean style pizza (garlic butter sauce, olives, artichoke hearts, and I used up the rest of the Canadian bacon). Definitely a much healthier and budget friendly alternative to ordering out.

Texture was good if a bit dry, but flavor was overwhelmingly "wheaty." I used King Arthur whole wheat white flour, which is good quality so I was disappointed. I will look for a recipe with honey and/or more seasoning next time.

We loved this wheat version.  I ended up needing to add more flour when I rolled the crusts out in addition to adding a couple of extra tablespoons to the bread machine.  I added corn meal to my pizza pans sprayed with cooking spray.  The crust was light and crunchy.

Used this pizza crust to make white garlic pizza. It was amazing. I used all whole wheat flour and it wasn't hard or chewy at all. Next time I think I will add some parmesan or some herbs to it.

Very easy to make and it baked up nice and crispy - exactly how I like it, but it seemed like it was missing something. I think next time I will add some herbs and spices or even mix crushed garlic into the dough. It made 3 small-ish pizzas, pre-baked it for a few minutes before adding the toppings.

OMG do I love this pizza crust! I used all whole wheat flower as other reviewers said and it tasted perfect! I've made it twice so far and the only thing I can recommend is to NOT FORGET the olive oil while it's rising, I forgot that the second time and it wasn't nearly as tender and moist.

Tastes good, I let the bread machine do the mixing.   I made two 12" pizzas and they held up to alot of toppings.  Nice to know you're getting a little extra with this recipe.

This was a hit at my house. I did change the recipe a little. I used all whole wheat flour (3 1/4) cups as others have suggested, added some flax seed and some italian seasoning.I did pre cook the dough @ 500 for 5 min. Then I put the toppings and cooked it @ 425 for about 10 minutes. All in the best whole wheat pizza I have ever had. Thanks.

Friends warned us that whole wheat pizza crust usually turns out dense or soggy. Not this recipe! It turned out crisp on the bottom and chewy. Perfect. I split the recipe in half, kept the dough in the fridge for two days and made a second pizza later. This will be a staple recipe in my house! We topped our pizza with spinach, garlic, onions, roasted peppers, eggplant, sauce and mozeralla. Delicious and filling!

Fantastic!  Used it to make calzones and it came out perfect.  We've had trouble in the past with doughy centers, even with commercially prepared dough, but not this time.  Was amazed at how much the crust rose.  My hubbie's Italian family has a long history of making pizza and pepperoni bread, but this is our new favorite!

This turned out GREAT, but i changed it, so...  I used 3 1/2 Cups WW flour, and dusted with Barley flour during kneading because it was sticky.  I used a tablespoon of honey instead of sugar, and loaded it with dried basil, garlic, and onion powder.  It was the best WW crust ever.

This was my first attempt at homemade pizza crust and this recipe was wonderful.  The only change I made was to use honey instead of sugar.  I also prebaked the crust at 500 degrees as some others had suggested and the texture was perfect.  I made a double batch of dough and am going to freeze one so I can make homemade pizza any time.

Made with all whole wheat flour and turned out great.  The only way you even now it’s a wheat pizza is if you eat the crust.

I've been looking for a whole wheat pizza crust recipe for awhile as I'm type 2. I made the recipe as is, I only subbed honey for the sugar, and blended in a few cloves of crushed garlic and a blend of Italian seasonings to the mix and it came out light and delicious! It was my first attempt at making pizza from total scratch, even the sauce (which i did not like, but thats a review for another recipe). Topped it with pepperoni, black olives, fresh mushrooms and artichoke hearts! was a total hit! It's not as good as old fashioned "horrible for you" pizza crust, but it's excellent for what it is, a healthy whole wheat alternative.

I cut the recipe was down to two portion sizes for a personal sized pizza.  
I used all whole wheat flour instead of part white flour.
I found that making the personal size worked really well, I was able to knead the dough in my hands and also work it into a pie shape with my hands.  It turned out to be the best wheat crust I have ever made.

I have also made this recipe in the full size, and I don't think it is quite as good, probably because I had to roll it out because it was too much for me to work with.

I would definitely recommend making mini pizzas.

This really didn't work out for me that well... I know it was something I did but I just can't figure out what. The taste was great but it just didn't seem like "pizza crust" to me. I think I need more work with yeast products.

We go with all whole wheat - as a result, much more water is needed.

Great to prep, freeze and pull out during the week!

This is a really great recipe! I made 1 14" large pizza and 7 mini individual ones with one dough. I used "exquisite pizza sauce" from this site. I place vegetables on the large one - for my husband and me and leave the mini ones for our children who like it plain. I place the pizzas in a 500 degree oven - without the cheese, wait till the crust begins to harden, and sprinkle cheese ontop 1 minute before I am ready to take the pizza out - this way the cheese melts, and doesn't burn, but I still get a crispy crust.

YUM! Made this last night. I spread olive oil and 'Tomato, Basil, Garlic' Mrs. Dash instead of sauce then topped with squash, zucchini, sweet onion, tomatoes (all fresh from the garden) cooked chicken, and skim Mozzerella. It was perfect for a low fat, healthy pizza. A+. will use from now on!!!

Great crust! Nice and soft on the inside crispy on outside. I used a pizza stone and 1 c. whole wheat flour and the rest white wheat flour which is also a whole grain flour (try experimenting with other wonderful whole grain flours like Spelt and Oat Flour. King Arthur Flour has an amazing whole grain cookbook if you're interested).

By far the easiest pizza dough I've ever worked with! It was easy to handle, not too sticky at all. I followed the recipe exactly, and I doubled it and made 3 "medium thickness" crust pizzas. I pre-baked at 500 degrees, then topped, and baked for another 10 minutes at 425 degrees. Turned out great! Definitely my go-to pizza dough recipe now!

I have made this recipe many times and it always turns out perfect.  Very easy to make and my whole family enjoys it (husband and four year old twins).  I do add some Italian seasoning mix and garlic powder to the dough while adding the flour for extra flavor.  I have also made the second portion of crust into four personal size pizza's for my boys to decorate themselves.  Baked all four on a cookie sheet for 16 minutes, which turned out really well.

I used all whole wheat flour, 3 1/2 cups and 4 Tbsps. gluten with perfect results. Important to let it rise twice. We chose to make 2 thin crusts 18" thin. I'm filing this recipe away for future use.

This works really well in the bread maker.  I used the regular "dough" setting instead of the shorter "pizza dough" setting.  I pre-cooked the crust for about 5 minutes before adding toppings.  I also used entirely whole wheat flour as others did.  Next time I think I might add a little more honey.

I have been living in Alberta for two years and have been craving pizza from home(Nova Scotia) FINALLY...I have found a pizza crust that tastes like home!!! Delicious!! The only alterations were some italian seasoning and garlic powder and prebaking for about 8 minutes...don't forget to poke holes in the crust first!! Fantastic!!

This is the first whole wheat pizza crust I've made and it came out delish.  It is very hearty and heavy.  It was crispy on the outside and warm and soft on the inside.  Next time I may add a little more sugar..but other wise great.

I let the dough sit over night in the fridge. In the morning I worked the dough again and put it back in the fridge until I got home from work.  It is amazing how much it rises each time.  
An hour before dinner I took the it out and sat it on a floured counter to warm up.  I split it into 4 pieces and rolled it out as thin as I could.  
Then I made calzones with turkey pepperoni, artichokes, sundried tomatoes and green olives.  I used a mix of mozz cheese and provolone.  The sauce was a family recipe.
5 minutes before it was done I sprinkled cheese on top to brown.  YUMMY!
The only downside was the dough gets soggy when it starts to cool.

I'm not sure what went wrong with this one. I've always made my own crust and I've used whole wheat flour before (I didn't bother with any white all- purpose flour). But this time it just didn't pan out. I think my mistake was in letting the bread machine save me some time and do the work for me. I've never done that for crust. The dough was impossible to work with. Terribly terribly gooey, even after I added WAY more flour than was called for (I was trying to save it.) Learned my lesson though. Never use a machine to do the work of a cook! Ruins the recipe. I ended up chucking the stuff and kicking myself and using prefab crusts. I suppose that's what I get for trying to cut corners. I'll just stick to my other crust recipe.

I just made this for dinner tonight and it was awesome.  I will never buy storebought crust again!  It is a lot of work but it is definately worth it.  I prebaked the crust for 10 minutes then added the toppings and baked for another ten.  Even my boyfriend liked it, which is great because being that I am a dietitian I am always looking for healthy alternatives to his favorite foods.  Thanks so much for this great recipe.

I love this pizza crust!  My family gobbled it all up and they normally refuse to eat anything with whole wheat in it! It was enough to make two thin crust pizzas.  I'll be making this every Friday night on movie night!

Very good crust. I used all whole wheat flour and pre baked my crust before adding the toppings. A keeper!

Amazing recipe. I added about a TBSP of italian seasoning because I wasn't sure how "wheat bread-y" this was going to be. I did use all whole wheat flour and honey for the sugar. I individually wrapped the left over slices in tin foil then put them in freezer bags, and just reheated in a low temp oven, and perfection!!

This truly lives up to its name.  Amazing!!  I've made it once and am making it again for dinner tonight.  It's so easy to work with, not sticky like some doughs.  Also freezes well.  A fav with my husband.

I tried to make this twice today. I couldn't get the dough to rise. I tried to keep it warm enough... not sure what the problem was. Maybe my yeast was old? I'm ordering Papa John's tonight.

I made this for the second time today, used my kitchenaid mixer and dough hook.  I did have to add a little extra flour both times so it wasn't too sticky.

The BEST if you are a whole wheat lover. This crust is terrific also as a white pizza (no red sauce). It's a "staple" recipe in my home. Thanks very much!

Very good.  I used my KitchenAid mixer with the dough hook attachment, which made kneading a snap.  Made two thin crusts.  Texture was a bit chewy.  Will try again, but next time I'll try a thick crust.

Easy, tasty crust. I made it in my KitchenAid with the dough hook instead of hand kneading. Worked like a charm! I have since made the recipe adding some ground flax seed, and subbing rice flour for part of the whole wheat flour. Both variations worked just as well. I do pre-bake the crust for about 6-7 minutes prior to topping.

This crust is amazing!  It came out perfect, was so easy, and was just what I was looking for!

The only changes I made were to halve the recipe (I just wanted one, thin crust pizza), and used all whole wheat flour (I don't buy white flour).

I'm so happy to have found this recipe!  I've never ever baked anything with yeast before, so I was a little intimidated with the kneading, then rising, then kneading process, but it was fun!!  And the crust was delicious, perfect consistency, healthy, and my husband loved it.  I made two thin crusts, baked at 475 10 min, added toppings, and baked for 10 more min.  For toppings, we added pesto, artichoke hearts, sundried tomatoes, and feta cheese...yummy!

We didn't have enough time to let it rise fully, about 30 mins, then 20, but it was Awesome!!! Exactly what I had hoped it would be like. Crunchy on the outside, chewy inside. Next time I'll make only 2/3 or so of the recipe because the whole amount makes one huge pizza. I will also try adding some diced sundried tomatoes and italian seasoning. Thank you for this recipe, I'll never use anything else!!

This is fabulous. I make it with the children I nanny. They love to knead and roll the dough. It turns out beautifully and delicious. I have made the regular recipe and also switched the flour amounts (1 cup of whole wheat and 2 cups of white flour). Both were great.

Good recipe and much healthier than our favorite white flour crust.  Maybe it was our homemade pizza sauce - but this crust was a little soggy in the middle.

Awesome pizza dough! Was a total success at my house. The only changes I made were to sub honey for sugar and sprinkled some garlic and onion powder in too. Will definitely try again! Made a HUGE dough for a pizza though, might make 2 next time instead of one.

This crust is very good - a couple things to note though:
1.) If you want to make 2 decently sized pizzas make double the recipe, I used the whole thing for one thin crust.
2.) I think that 110 degrees is a bit hot for adding yeast - the first time I made this I killed the yeast and the crust did not rise! I put the water in the microwave for 20-30 secs and then mixed the sugar, etc. and it worked better.

This is very easy and very good.  It mixes up well and rolls out with ease.  I used only 1 tsp of yeast, and it worked  fine, and had no overly yeasty flavor.  Thank you for a keeper recipe!

i was comfortable following the recipe but I think the prep time stated is misleading. It says 25 minutes prep time but that does not include the time you have to let the dough rise. But the dough was delicious as a calzone and I will use it again.

This was the first time I made my own pizza from scratch and it turned out delicious.  I was so impress with the pizza myself and everyone loved it.  I only let the dough rise for about 45 minutes total, but it still came out perfect.  Since it is whole wheat I don't feel so guilty about having seconds.  Really great recipe, will definitely make again and again!!!  :)

This tasted great with barbecue chicken pizza (I used barbecue sauce, red onions, and cooked chicken), but we found that we prefer a regular crust with our favorite supreme pizza.  Great alternative though!

This is my new standard pizza crust recipe!  I love that it uses whole wheat flour, but it's not super-heavy.  Even my husband - who hates all things healthy - loves this crust.  When I roll it out, I like to roll some Italian seasoning, or other pizza seasoning out with it for extra flavor.

This was my first ever attempt at making pizza dough from scratch...and it turned out wonderfully!!! I made this into a gourmet pizza by topping it with the "best ever marinara sauce," mozzerella and a little ghouda + sauteed mushrooms, onions, baby spinach, grilled chicken, olives, and pine nuts...I highly recommend it!

I agree with some of the others that it tastes alot like bread and not like a pizza crust should.  My husband really liked it but eh, not my favotite.

This is my favorite homemade crust!  I use a little more wheat flour and a little less white flour than the recipe calls for.  I get two crusts out the recipe and cook it on my pizza stone at 500 degrees.

This is my favorite whole wheat crust. I start with the whole wheat flour, and only use enough white flour to make it come together. I've found that using 1/2c less than that specified yields the most tender crust, but this has not always been true - I've found that all dough acts differently each time you make it. I have also substituted honey for the sugar with great results.

The first time I made it I don't know what happened.  Way too sticky no matter how much flour I added.  I made a new batch the next day and it turned out great.  A little extra flour was needed.  I separated in to 2 crusts and froze one.  Looking forward to making my next pizza!

This was great! I skipped the 45 min rise b/c I was short on time but it still turned out perfect! Usually the wheat crust we get from the store tends to be too soft in the middle- this was perfect- this will become a staple in our recipe book, thank you.

This was an awesome pizza crust.  I read that it would be ready in 45 minutes so I thought we would have it for dinner.  I got home from work and started making the recipe, not reading the directions ahead.  Well needless to say we ate dinner late that night because I did not think about the dough needing to rise.  Anyhow the crust was worth the wait and I toped it with the ingredients from the Black and White pizza recipe on allrecipies. I got 2 crusts from the recipe too.  Very good and will do again.

Excellent Recipe...It was a snap to make and the family LOVED it...Thanks for much. Note: the summary says it will take 45 mins but that doesn't account for the 2 hours of waiting for the dough to rise :)

I was sorry to say I did not care for this as much as I had hoped.  I also replaced all of the flour with whole wheat flour and perhaps will give it another try as written.  A lot of my dislike for the crust comes from personal preferance.  I like thin, crispy pizza crust, even with only half the dough I found the crust to be too chewy and it never really got crispy.  The taste itself is obviously heavier due to the whole wheat flour.  I often found it tasted like bread more than pizza.

This was great! Changed it a little, used only whole wheat flour (3 1/4 cups) and used the dough cycle on the bread machine, turned out great. Kids loved it.

Delicious crust (we ate one right away and froze the other one).  My husband and kids can't wait to make pizza again and I love that it's healthy for them.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.

I was amazed at how good this crust tasted and it was my first time ever making pizza dough.  However, I would recommend breaking the dough into two parts and making 2 pizzas instead of one.  The pizza ends up being too thick (I never thought that I would say that about a pizza) and therefore a high proportion of wheat crust to toppings.

I used half for a pizza that didn't quite make it off the peel and became a calzone instead. I baked it on my stone, and the bottom was great- good flavor, good chew. It was a little more dense than I had expected (but that's probably because of the calzone business).

Great, easy to do. I added some Mrs. Dash to the dough so it wouldn't be bland. I also prebaked it for 7 minutes. then added topping and baked pizza for 15 minutes. I also added a little cornmeal to the baking pan before and it came out crunchy and delicious. This is my recipe from now on. I like that it is high in fiber and really keeps you full. Use this, you will never be unhappy!

I made this exactly according to the recipe, and it turned out great!  This was my FIRST time making fresh dough of any kind, but the directions were so clear that the crust came out nearly perfectly.  I made this with the Exquisite Pizza Sauce, and my first pizza attempt was really quite good!  I made one thick crust, and it does turn out quite thick; might try 2 crusts next time.  Also will probably try pre-baking without toppings and adding some spices next time.  Excellent, easy recipe!

I thought this was an excellent recipe. So did all of my kids. I thought the dough was going to be too tight to do much rising but it did fine. I got three 12" thin crusts out of this instead of 2 but I wanted really thin crusts. It stood up well to all of the toppings and had an excellent flavor and texture. Thanks for sharing an excellent recipe!

Tried this last night and the family enjoyed it. The dough handled easily and made a tasty crust with a nice texture.  Good for a thin crust, but I'm not sure about a "deep dish".

Tonight I figured out how to make astounding homemade pizza crust. I followed this recipe but brought water temp between 115 and 120, and let the second rising of the dough go for 6hours in the fridge

Technically not whole wheat, but for a healthier pizza crust it was great! Super thick if you don't divide into 2. I used melted butter instead of olive oil and added Italian seasonings. Next time I want to try making the dough in bread machine and have it thinner. Also after baking I want to brush the outer crust with butter for a little more flavor. I'm trying to find a tasty healthy crust so I don't eat delivery pizza though.

It’s really good. My kids love it. We put the crust in the oven for five minutes before adding toppings. We also don’t let the pizza rise as long as they recommend if I don’t have enough time.

I thought it was bland.  The husband thought it was tough.  The only reason I tried this was because I couldn't find my copycat Mellow Mushroom crust.  I will go back to my original recipe.

I've made a few different pizza doughs. This one is, by far, the most elastic. It tastes great and the finished texture is fantasic. I cut the recipe in half as I wanted to make a smaller pizza and the dough rose in about 1/2 hour each time. It still filled a smaller size rectangular cookie sheet.  I definitely will use this recipe again.

Just what I was looking for.   I followed these modifications due to dietary needs.

Incredible! I modified the recipe a little using only whole wheat flour (3 1/4 cups) and substituted honey for the sugar. I an extra teaspoon of salt and added 1 t. italian seasoning to the dough for added flavor. I put the ingredients in the bread machine on the dough setting and let it do the work for me!! I precooked the crust for 5 min at 500 degrees and then added the ingredients and cooked it for an additional 14 minutes at 425. Pizza came out PERFECT! even those at the table who were skeptical of whole wheat crust RAVED about this recipe. we will be making this one again and again!

This is a pretty good recipe. It is easy to double and has a light flavor.  I was in a time crunch, so I didn't let it rise for a full hour before making pizza with it.  The dough rises nicely, is crisp on the outside, and light on the inside.  I will be making this recipe again.  In time I am sure I will tweak it somehow, just because I like to tinker with recipes, but as it stands, this is a solid go-to recipe.

Followed the instructions to the letter. The dough turned out ok. You really need to divide into 4 if you are making thin crust pizzas. My crust still turned out rather thick. It cooked and crisped up nicely, but really lacked in flavour. Needs more salt or some herbs perhaps. No matter what toppings you put on, nothing can make up for a bland crust.

This crust was very easy to make. I had never made pizza dough before and I would call it a success. The crust has a good flavor and crisps up well; I did the thin crust version. The crust does not become cracker-like as some other thin crusts do, so don't make my mistake of putting too much sauce or toppings on your pizza. The crust isn't strong enough for that.  Less is more in this case it seems.  Good crust overall though!

I made this recipe but with a few changes. I left out the sugar, and used whole wheat flour only. Same amount of flour, just whole wheat only. Also I didn't wait for the dough to rise, I just mixed it kneaded it and rolled it out. Rolled it thin and baked for 20 min.  Made for a great this crust, whole wheat pizza crust!

I thoroughly enjoyed using this recipe.  I have been searching for a tasty whole wheat crust recipe for a long time, and this is one of the best I have found.  We often have a pizza night at the house.  Everyone gets their own dough and makes whatever they want on their individual pizza.  This recipe makes 5-6 individual crusts, which is perfect for our family.  We've used this recipe several times now, all successful  The most important step in this recipe IMHO is that second rise. Don't skip or skimp on that step - you'll regret it if you do. No substitutions needed - this is a winner!

I made this dough and absolutely loved it. I did add 1 tbs oregano, 1 tbs basil, 1 tsp cinnamon. I baked the crust for 5 minutes at 500 before adding toppings, then for about 9 minutes at 425 with toppings. The cinnamon definitely made the dough a little sweeter. We have big pizza fans in our family and everyone absolutely loved this crust. :)

This was the best pizza crust I've ever made.  I added a little ground flax, heaping TB corn meal and some italian seasoning, dumped it all in my bread machine and let it do the work.  Very good and will repeat.

I'm an inexperienced baker & have to use my KitchenAid mixer with dough hook for kneading (I have tendonitis). Following the recipe, my dough "ball" after ten minutes of kneading was still really shaggy. I added more white flour, kneaded some more, repeated that. Finally I gave up, dumping the sticky, shaggy mess into the bowl. I had to add more olive oil to keep it from sticking to the bowl. So I have  a giant shaggy wad of olive oil goo over there in a bowl! No idea how it's going to turn out.

It tasted very good, stayed fluffy and soft, I'm very happy with the results. Made the dough with Whole Wheat flour and separated it into quarters to make personal pizzas. I made 3, with a homemade sauce and used the last quarter to make tiny pizza bites that looked like calzones. The dough was a little tough to get thin enough for my son's taste but that could just mean that I need practice. :-) The pizza bites were a little hard to do too, couldn't get enough sauce and cheese inside.

Very easy to make.  I added the salt to the flour as opposed to adding it to the yeast mixture, as I did not want the salt to 'kill' the yeast.

Excellent recipe! I used 3 1/4 whole wheat flour only (+ 1/2 c for the kneading, which btw was made in 5 minutes using a stand mixer).  Got 2 thin pizza crusts (13" & 15") and baked them first at 500 F for 5 minutes, then added de ingredients and baked at 425 F  for 10-14 min as some reviewers suggested.  Thanks for sharing, will definitely make again!

I had to freeze it in the middle of it rising in the bowl, but it was still really good. My family loved it and I would definitely make it again.

Loved this. It worked well in the bread machine on the dough setting. I did add a little oregano and basil and cooked it for a few minutes before adding the toppings like others suggested. Will definitely make again and again!

I followed along with other reviewers and omitted the all purpose flour in favor of using all white whole wheat flour.  I kept the 1 tsp of sugar instead of using honey. I split the dough into two crusts and got two thin crusted ovals about 10 inches long. Plenty of food for 5 people! Loved the crunchy outside and slight softness of the inside. I'd make it again.

I would recommend this recipe to anyone! I bought a bread maker just to try this recipe and my family loves it! I followed the recommendation of other reviews for wheat flour only and it turned out perfect! My family and I are going to try this for "Family Night"!

We made this crust tonight except we took advice from another reviewer and used 3 1/4 c whole wheat flour instead of the all purpose. It was EXCELLENT. We also kneaded in some Italian seasoning and garlic powder to the dough which worked out very well. Highly recommend!

This was my first attempt at making pizza dough.  I did use all whole wheat flour and honey instead of sugar. My hands wimped out at kneading  so I used a dough hook to do the work after the first rise.  The dough seemed dry, I had to play with liquids to get what I thought was the right texture/consistency.  Did bake for 5 minutes at 500 and then added toppings and finished at 425 like reviewers suggested.  It made 4 personal pizzas, at Boboli size,  it was crispy on the outside and chewy inside.  I actually oiled three  dough balls and froze them, made one a week later, and still just as good.  The last two I am going to roll thinner to see if I can get more crisp than chew.   And next time will add spices to the crust. Overall a great basic recipe.

Excellent pizza crust!  The dough was just slightly on the dry side as it was coming together so I did end up adding a little bit extra olive oil to pull it together.  Definitely a keeper!

I make homemade crust all the time but this is a winner! I used King Arthur white whole wheat flour for the whole wheat and regular AP flour. Followed recipe exactly except for adding salt with the flour not with the yeast. The dough rose beautifully and was so easy to work with. I've made this 3 times in the past 2 weeks and intend to make it again this week.  The texture is light which I didn't expect with the whole wheat and so delicious. My family loves it so goodbye to all other recipes. After spreading the dough onto my greased pizza pans, I bake at 450-500 for about 10 minutes to precook the pizza before adding sauce and cheese. I might even freeze the precooked crusts for the next party to make my life easier!

Great recipe!  Much better than the pre-made pizza doughs.  
This is the perfect amount of dough for two medium sized pizzas with a crust not too thin or deep.  Didn't change a thing, however, I did need to cook it in the oven for longer than the reccommended time.

The only substitution I made was honey for sugar.   The flavor was good and the instructions produced a very good thin crust when divided into two pizzas.

I made this and loved it.  I put it on the pizza pan and put it in the oven while the oven was heating up to the right temp.  When the oven was at temp, I pulled it out and put on the sauce and toppings, and then baked it.  The crust was incredibly crusty (I hate soggy, doughy crust).  I will make this over and over again!

Great crust! The only thing I added was a half tsp of garlic powder to give it a little extra zip.  In response to another reviewer's comment: You are referring to whole grain wheat not whole wheat. White flour is in fact 100% wheat, it is just not 100% of the wheat (ie. including the germ, bran, etc.). Commercially ground whole grain wheat flour is not available in the US. Even the flour labeled as such is actually only white flour that has had some of the bran and germ added back. The only way to get true whole grain flour is to grind it yourself, which I do. This receipe is equally tasty made either way.

This is my all-time favourite pizza dough recipe. I have tried several, and none even come close to this. As someone who was scared to try making pizza dough for years due to the assumption of it being challenging, this recipe has proved me wrong! Super easy, fool proof even.  Everyone who has tried it absolutely loves it. Thank you for a great recipe!

I think for a simple, healthy, whole wheat crust (I used 3.25 cups of white whole wheat flour and added NO white flour, subbed honey for sugar, and added 1tsp of salt), this is a consistent recipe. I have made it several times, and it's not my kids favorite compared to a white flour crust, but they still eat it happily and it's better for them! It always turns out the same. I love recipes you can depend on.

My large family loves homemade pizza, and we are always on the lookout for a whole wheat twist on things we love. This recipe did not disappoint! The texture was wonderful, crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside. We tossed it, dusted the bottom with cornmeal, then baked it on a pizza tray (not a stone) at 325 for 10 minutes, THEN added toppings and baked 10 minutes more. It came out perfect. The second time we made it, we added some spices to the dough, and a little honey and it came out very good that way as well. Very versatile. Thank you for a wonderful share!

This was an ideal recipe. The only additions I made were fresh chopped garlic and fresh basil in the dough. the crust was thin, but chewy and crisp at the same time. For my topping I roasted red peppers, eggplant, mushroom and onions, plus chicken sausage. raves reviews all around.

So I read the reviews and used 3 3/4 cup whole wheat flour. I forgot to let it rise the second time and it still came out great! I made two batches and froze the second batch prior to second rise. I will just thaw it and let it rise before cooking it. Everyone loved it, and using a food processor made it a breeze.

I really like this recipe a lot - I will not buy store-bough pizza crusts again! I made a couple of adjustments - some  due to preference and some for my breadmaker. I used all whole-wheat flour - 3 1/4 cups and I usually have to add an additional 1-2 tablespoons of water during the kneading phase to get the dough the right consistency. I use a teaspoon of honey instead of white sugar, and sometimes I add a tablespoon of Italian seasoning to the mix. Set the breadmaker on the dough setting, and this makes enough for 2 large thin crusts. I bake the crust for 5-6 minutes at 475 degrees, then add topping and cook for another 10-12 minutes. I usually use 1 crust and freeze the other for the next week.  To thaw, I put it in the fridge for a day & let it set on the counter for 30 minutes before using.  Seriously, after making this, I see no reason to buy dough or crusts anymore!

Good recipe! I tried it out for the first time and it was good.. It turned out to be a little thick as I had used 3 cups of whole wheat flour and 1/2 cup of all purpose flour. Thanks for sharing this recipe.

I admit I still prefer the traditional pizza dough, but this was nice for a change.  It baked beautifully on my cast iron pizza pan and had good flavor and texture.

It tasted no different than normal pizza crust. Just a different and good texture. I used only whole grain flour and honey instead of sugar. Gonna make it again this coming week also!

I really did not like this, found it very gritty, but other members of my family did so I'll split the difference.

Awesome Recipe for a Whole Wheat Dough.  I used dark corn syrup instead of sugar and did a grilled chicken pizza on the BBQ and broiled the top in the over.  Have to say it was very good.

This was delicious! After reading the other reviews- I used 1Tbsp of honey instead of the sugar and I added 1Tbsp each of basil and oregano. I also pre-cooked the crust for about 5 minutes before adding the toppings and then cooking for about another 12 minutes (until the dough was golden and the cheese was melted).  I split the dough in half and froze one half for another time and my husband and I each made a "personal" pizza using the other half! So much better than ordering from a local take-away pizza parlor!

Only change I made was two tbs of dough enhancer as I was using whole grain home ground wheat.  Topped it with mozzarella, sauce, roasted red peppers, pepperoni and Provolone cheese.  Forgot to drizzle olive oil on the cheese so it got a little to brown but they raved about it at a meeting said it was the best pizza they ever had.   This is going into my recipe box here and on the computer.

This is the BEST pizza dough recipe I have found.  I substituted 1/4 cup buckwheat and 1/4 cup bread flour instead of the 1/2 cup flour called for.  I also used white wheat flour and bread flour.  Due to the activities of my day I let it rise for about a total of 5 hours.  It turned out great, except was a bit thicker than I had hoped.  I think next time I will not let it rise so long as well as dividing the dough into 4 balls instead of 2.  Oh, make sure your hot water is temped correctly.  Too hot or too cold will greatly affect the outcome.  Also, I just watched a cooking show where they used honey instead of sugar, I will try that next time.

Made as it is written the first time and it was a little bland.  2nd time around was 5 stars: I made it entirely with whole wheat and added Italian seasoning.  Great recipe!

This recipe was very good. I used 3 cups of whole wheat flour (as some other users suggested) but it was very sticky. I ended up adding 1/4 - 1/2 cup of extra whole wheat flour. Turned out great using a pizza stone pre-heated at 500 for about 10-12 minutes. Very crispy but still chewy on top. I also brushed the edges with olive oil but will have to do something better next time - just needs a little something else...Will make again!

Made this pretty much exactly as it calls for, used exactly these ingredients, only thing I did different was only let it rise once..it was DELICIOUS!!!
I'm switching my family to healthier foods and this is a BIG step for them!
I love the slightly nutty flavor and was surprised at how light it was!
Excellent recipe!  This one is going in my book!

The dough was delicious, but the texture was more like bread than a pizza crust- too fluffy and soft for my taste, but I might use the recipe for dinner rolls in the future.

OUTSTANDING!!! I, too opted for using 3 1/2 cups of wheat flour, as white flour gives me TERRIBLE heartburn...the 1/2 c was actually used to flour the work area...it was fantastic! I made mine thin and rectaangular, so I didn't need the second ball of dough and froze it! I didn't feel like making a homemade sauce, and tried out 2 tiny cans of Hunt's tomato sauce seasoned with garlic and basil (HINT: all that's on the label is "Hunt's Sauce")..it was shockingly good! Then topped with generous portions of mozzarella,  turkey sausage and turkey pepperoni, fresh mushrooms onions and tri colored bell peppers, and of course a bit more cheese!...Baked for 15 minutes, which would have been ok for some, but I like a really crispy crust (which I folded over to give a small amount of thickness) and baked for another 10 minutes...AWESOME THX FOR THE RECIPE AND SUGGESTIONS FROM THE COMMUNITY!!! Can't wait to try this as a white chicken or chrimp and mushroom pizza!!!

I made this for my family because we wanted a healthier alternative for pizza nights and it was a hit!! My boys gobbled it down and DH loved it!! We all know the crust of a pizza is the hardest to get down but I think this recipe does a great job! I also substitute honey for sugar and use 100% whole wheat flour. I added pizza spices to the crust and placed it all in my bread maker in the dough cycle...came out perfect! Will definitely make again!!

I have been using this recipe for years and LOVE it! It's really simple and the directions are great. I also use all wheat flour and bake for 5 or 6 minutes at 500 then add toppings and bake again at 425 for 10 - 15 minutes (until the cheese browns). It comes out great every time! My family and friends all love my pizzas! My sister even asked for the crusts for Christmas a couple years ago! Sometimes I double the recipe and freeze the crusts. They are still amazing! Kudos to Marla!

really good and really easy. Followed the recipe as written, minus the suggestion from others to do 3 and 1/4 cups whole wheat flour (I actally did white whole wheat flour).   I think next time I will add a touch more oil, salt and sugar. I made two thin pizzas. I think next time I will leave as a whole to make one thicker crust pizza. Next time I will use less cornmeal on the bottom of the pan. I let it rise an hour the first time, and then an hour the second time. I think this would be good to turn into breadsicks and add in some herbs to the dough.

Exactly what I was looking for! Next time I think I'll try using all whole wheat flour and making the crust thicker and making it more like a bowl. But definitely going to use it again!

Great recipe!! Follow it exactly, and made a thick crust the first time, little too much bread. The second time made two thinner crusts and it was perfect! Cooked it on a Pampered Chef pizza stone, it was awesome!

Made this dough for my partner and i, and the only thing i did different (though i'm not sure what actually is the difference) was that i used a brand of "pizza yeast".  It was still Active Dry, and bought at a grocery, but the name spoke to me.  Anyway, the crust was more then enough for two medium sized pizzas, and mmm, it was soooo good!!  Will tweak it next time with some of the other review recommendations.

I make pizza often and wanted to try a different crust.  I enjoyed this one but it didn't have the same crunch and chewiness of my other crust.  It did taste great for a whole wheat pizza crust.  Thanks for the recipe!

The best pizza crust ever. Didn't change a thing from the original. The dough was a bit much for 2 so I refrigerated it for a whole day n made it for dinner the next day n it still tasted awesome... Just remember to bring it to room temp before baking.
Will never store buy crust again...

I used entirely whole wheat flour and no AP for a stronger whole wheat taste and came out great.  Liberally added some Italian seasoning also for a more enhanced flavor in the pizza. Used entire dough ball for one thick crust pan pizza and it was just fabulous, came out crispy on the outside and soft inside.  Would definitely make my future homemade pizzas using this recipe.

Very easy to work with! I tried to make a whole wheat dough in the past but it came out to crisp and not so tasty! The dough in this recipe was amazing..very easy! It's in the oven now..finger crossed! :))

As far as pizza crusts go, this one is pretty good. However, as far as wheat pizza crusts go, this is the best I have found.

This was the best whole wheat crust I've ever made! I read a lot of the other reviews and made a few changes from others' suggestions and one of my own: I used 100% whole wheat flour that I ground from whole soft white wheat, added 2 Tbs of gluten and 1 Tbs dough enhancer, added about 2 Tbs of italian seasoning and an extra tsp of salt. I made it in my bread machine on the dough setting and it rose beautifully in there. I rolled mozzarella cheese into the edge of the crust to make it stuffed-crust, topped it, and baked it on my preheated pizza stone.  It turned out delicious! Though it was a little too salty with all the other toppings so next time I won't an extra tsp of salt. But great texture and flavor! Soft and chewy on the inside, crisp on the outside just like it claims.

I wish I'd never tried this recipe. It is way, way better than the 20-minute crust I used to make (which I'd actually quite liked until I tried this). Unfortunately, I usually only have 20 minutes to make crust. I may have to make pizza a Sunday night thing so I can continue to make and devour this truly amazing pizza crust!

I didn't reeeeally like this too much, mostly because it kind of lacked in taste... It might taste better if you spread it out thinner in the pan and drizzle extra olive oil in the pan before putting the crust in the pan.  But it did get the job done

I loved this healthy pizza crust, it turned out very thin and crunchy. I halved the recipe since I wanted to have 1 medium pizza. I also added 1/4 cup of wheat bran to the dough and took out 1/4 cup of all purpose flour. So my flour proportions were: Whole Wheat - 1 cup, All purpose - 1/2 cup, Wheat bran- 1/4 cup. The dough was so soft to work with, that I just pressed it with my fingers until it was as big as my pizza stone.
Turned out amazing!

I've made this several times.  Use 3 1/2 cups of whole wheat flour instead of using the white flour.  Baked the crust for 5 minutes untopped before topping followed by baking the last 15 minutes.  I turned my oven on and let the dough in the ball proof in the pan for about 20 minutes instead of letting it sit for the hour.  Worked fine.  DELICIOUS

This recipe turned out perfect. I used only whole wheat flour, and devided the dough into 8 personal size pizza's and they were about the size of a small pita bread. I baked the dough for about 6-8 minutes, and then used them all week for my lunch at work.

*Update* After making this crust twice, I have to say that it just tastes to much like bread. With this in mind, I have to knock the rating down to 3. 

Very good recipe.  I followed the ingredients of the recipe pretty closely, but not the directions.  

On the third paragraph ("When the dough is doubled..."), instead of letting it rise for 45 minutes, I just covered it with some foil and let it sit in my fridge overnight. Afterwards, I pulled it out and let it warm up for about 2 hours.

I then put some AP flour on my pizza pan (12-14") and threw my dough on top of it. From there, I smoothed it out until the pan was pretty well covered with dough, put my toppings on, and then cooked it at 375F for between 11-16 minutes.

This was very easy to make. The next time I will use a flavored salt and maybe double it in the recipe as the crust is quite simple. I made two pizzas with this but it easily could have easily made 3 thin crust.

I just recently switched to using more whole wheat flour in all my cooking. I make homemade pizza about once a week and was in need of a new recipe that included whole wheat flour. I followed this recipe and made it in my breadmaker. This made a great pizza crust! Easy to roll out! And exactly what I was looking for! Thanks!

I made this a few months ago and like every ten days all summer. My 12 year old loves it.  I made a bigger dough and froze baseball size pieces in baggies. We may never buy another frozen pizza.

We used this recipe to make grilled pizza.  While kneading, the dough was very dry so I left out a 1/2 cup of flour.  But it continued to rise throughout the process, even right before grilling so the yeast was an excellent amount.  It was fluffy even though we opted for the thin crust option.  I would definitely love to test this out as an oven-style pizza because I think it would be perfect.  (Grilling makes it dry out, so its a little crunchier than I like it.)

Not bad.  It needed a boost of flavor though.  I blended olive oil, sage, rosemary and minced garlic and added it to the dough mixture.  Made a much more flavorful crust!

Incredibly easy recipe resulting in a silky soft dough. I kneaded blue cheese into the dough for a blue cheese crust. The crust tasted great (I couldn't taste the whole wheat) and had a crispy texture around the edges.

This is a wonderful crust. I made it with all whole wheat flour and some italian spices, lovely and thin and crisp. Also I froze one portion and it thawed and rolled out beautifully. This is a staple in our kitchen now.

I make dough all the time.  While this was delicious once we finally consumed it, it was SO sticky.  I've looked over the recipes a hundred times and am positive I didn't do anything wrong, so I don't know what the problem was, because I didn't see many others mentioning it being too sticky!  I probably ended up adding another 1/2c. of flour and it was still very sticky when I finally just decided to roll it out on the pizza stone and go with it.  Thankfully, I just sprayed the pizza stone with a bit of olive oil and it ended up turning out okay and did not stick.  Changes I made:  I made it in the bread machine and pre-baked the crust at 500* for 5 minutes and then added toppings and lowered the temp to 425* for about 10-12 minutes.  Next time: I'd like to try using all whole wheat flour (3 1/4 cups), as many suggested.  I'd also like to add some Italian seasoning (1T) or substitute honey (2T) for sugar for a different taste.  Tonight we topped it with pesto, spinach, feta and tomato.  Mmmm.  Very good and definitely a keeper!  EDIT: Made it again with all whole wheat flour (3 1/4c).  While it wasn't as sticky as last time, it was still sticky and I had to work in some more flour.  Good, for whole wheat crust.

I used all whole wheat flour and it worked quite well. I had never made my own bread or pizza crust before and this recipe was very easy to follow. I added Italian seasoning, onion powder, and garlic powder and it worked well. I also precooked at 500 degrees for 5 mins, before adding toppings, then baked the whole with at 425 for about 18 mins. I will definitely use this one again!

I just added more wheat flour instead of white flour to this recipe.  I grilled these bad boys on a pan on the grill.  The best crunchy crust ever!  My fiance even loved them!  I raved about it so much, I took the recipe on the road to make for my family while on vacation.  They all loved it too, even the kids!  Fantastic!

This was the very first dough I have made of any kind and I was not expecting much, but I followed the recipe just like it says and it was absolutely fabulous! My husband and I were both very pleasantly surprised! Thanks for a great, easy to follow recipe! Will definitely be making again!

Instead of using 1 1/2 cups all purpose flour I used 1 cup and used the 1/2 cup as just more whole wheat flour. I added mushrooms, sun dried tomato's, yellow peppers, green peppers, turkey pepperoni, cherry tomatoes, red onion, then topped it off with basil. It came out good, but when I cup the slices up to put on a plate, it kind of fell apart, the dough didn't hold the stuff, maybe because I added too much stuff. or too much pizza sauce. I don't think I added too much pizza sauce, maybe the cherry tomato's were too liquidy. Maybe my pizza dough was too thin.

I made this twice once with all whole wheat and once as written. Both turned out well however the all whole wheat was a bit hard to roll out but I managed. The texture and taste were good. My two year old actually ate more of the crust than the toppings. I think I will stick with my reg Whole Wheat and Honey Pizza Dough from this site..I think the honey makes all the difference. However I will use this one for pizza bread dipped in meat sauce. Thank you for posting.

I added some italian seasoning, garlic salt, and oregano. I topped with onion, green olive, and chicken breast and a sprinkle of parmesan and I must say this was delicious :) so yummy and crisp! I did bake the crust for about 8 minutes on 350 before topping and sending into the oven for the final cookout and it was soo good :) will be making this crust again for sure. Thanks for posting!

Turned out OK, Was alittle on the dry side. I did add garlic and onion powder for a little more taste. It was pizza so of course the kids ate it up!  Nice change from ordering pizza and a healthier choice for sure. (Its a 4 star because its a healthier choice)

My mother-in-law gave me her Emeril T-fal bread maker and this is the first thing I made. It was simple, easy and very tasty. I only used whole wheat flour and I did add some dried italian spices and basil to the dough. It made two regular sized pizza crusts. My 3 year old son loved it. I'll be making it again.

Followed the advice of others and pre-baked for 5 min.  The only thing I did differently was sprinkle corn meal to the bottom of the pan, like they do at pizza shops in NYC.

I use to work in a pizza restaurant so I had an idea on how to prepare crust from scratch.  I made this and thought it was pretty darn good for whole wheat.  I am now going to tinker with it to perfect it for my tastes.  I would recommend this crust to anyone who wants to try something healthier.

absolutely wonderful.  I made just one 12 in. pizza and the crust was sooo thick.  Too thick for me so next time I will make 2 pizzas with this amount of dough.  Other wise this is a keeper!!!

This was pretty good. I really liked the texture. I added some flax seeds to it, which I think was nice. Next time, I will add maybe a bit more sugar and a bit more salt.

This pizza dough recipe had easy to understand instructions and the dough came out perfect!  Instead of a mix of flours, I used all whole wheat, and it was wonderful.  Next time I think I'll try adding a little sweetness to the dough - maybe a little sugar?  It was wonderful and impressive for my guest!

Pretty good, but it needed a little something extra for flavour. I think I will add some herbs next time as suggested by other reviewers.

Followed the recipe except used a food processor to combine the ingredients. It rose fine, rolled out and baked fine. Good texture, but the flavor was off putting to me. I won't be making this again.

Very tasty and easy.  I prebaked for 5 minutes, topped, then baked another 15.  Came out with a nice, crisp crust and was very delicious.  Thanks for sharing!

I wanted to try this as is and try as other reviews with only 3 1/4 C whole wheat flour.  The batch with just the whole wheat flour was good, but a bit more dense, almost like a pita.  I made just as the recipe was and added 2t garlic powder. It was Fantastic! Chewy on the inside. I did bake each one for 5 min @ 500 degrees and then added toppings. My husband was eating it before he even added toppings.  It made really good breadsticks too. I have tried many recipes with the ww flour and never could get a good pizza crust.  This is a keeper. Thanks.

Really yummy pizza crust! I, too, prebaked the crust for about ten minutes.I think honey would be a good addition, too.

I always end up adding a lot more flour so the dough isn't so sticky while kneading.  It's very yummy and has been a big hit at parties!

halved the recipe, was decent, would make again...would work much better on a pizza stone, a pizza pan made for a too-soft crust. overall will try again. Update 4/11, Made full batch and used a pizza stone, with these changes it is excellent. Not great for bread-sticks though.

Very good, it was a little soggy though.  I think I will bake it for about 5mins before I add the toppings to it the next time.  It probably only happened because my family loads the toppings on so it just had too much to get done right.  My own fault!

I use whole wheat flour for the entire recipie to keep in healthy.  I've tried alot of wheat pizza dough recipies and this is by far the best one.  It takes a little longer to make because of the rising but it's worth it.  My husband loved it also and he is a die hard Pizza Hut guy.

AMAZING is right!  My very picky 5.5 year old cries and BEGS for this pizza!! I've made it exactly as per the recipe, and I've also used only WW flour.  I like it better with the white flour, but really, it's the best pizza crust recipe ever.  Thanks so much for posting!

Good, it did taste a little yeasty. I made two mini deep dish pizzas. Should have done three! I didn't expect the second rise to be so fluffy but it was. I ended up with really fat crusts. I filled them with veggie beef, tomato sauce, spinach, sundried tomatoes and mozza cheese. Yum! I think next time with some tweaking it'll be amazing.

Amazing crust! I didn't modify the recipe other than to include some chopped fresh rosemary and flax, which turned out really nicely. I also rubbed the dough balls with an herby-garlicy-olive oil for the second fermentation, which I think turned out nicely. I baked my pizza in a pre-heated cast iron pan, which gave an amazing golden brown crust on the bottom. highly recommended!

I was a bit mixed on how to rate this one as my dough turned out OK.  It was definitely easy to work with, but I found the end result to be very dense and chewy.  I did use all whole wheat per some other reviewers b/c they noted it was great doing like that.  I have made Jay's Signature Pizza Crust a few times from this site (which is fab), so I have always used some white and some whole wheat flour.  End of the day, not sure if using all ww flour made a difference or not, might just have to give this one another whirl!

I haven't cooked it yet, but it was so easy to make!  I made it yesterday (a Wednesday) so it is ready for when I make pizza Friday night in just minutes.  It was very easy and most of the time is inactive.  Anyone can do this!! :)  I also used only whole wheat flour, as a lot of reviewers did.

This recipe didn't work for me. I followed the advice of one reviewer and used 3 1/4 cup of whole wheat flour. The dough rose well but when I cooked it it didn't rise and was hard (it was tasty though) What did I do wrong? Too thin? Too much kneading?

I came here looking for a whole wheat pizza dough recipe that got lots of great, consistant reviews.  I found it! :)  I didn't have any WW flour on hand, but couldn't wait to try it, so i did, using all AP flour, and honey in place of the sugar.  I put it all in the bread machine after mixing the yeast/water.  It turned out wonderful!  So soft and easy to work with.  Rolled out beautifully.  I make 4 pizzas out of it.  The first was too thin, couldn't really taste the crust it was soo thin.  So the others we made a little thicker.  YUM!  I did as some others did and added italian seasoning to the dough.  It is a really tasty dough!  I can't wait to try it with whole wheat flour!

Great Crust!  I used 100% whole wheat, so I'm sure it's even better if you stick exactly to the recipe, but it works great with that alteration.

This was the first pizza crust I have ever made! I rolled it out very thin and it made 2 large pizzas. I enjoyed the whole wheat taste as opposed to regular pizza crust. Thanks so much!

This pizza was one of the best pizza crusts I've ever had. But it was to thin so maybe double to recipe.

This recipe came out perfect, very light and healthy.  I used the breadmaker to mix and knead the dough, I took it out covered and let it rise more then cut it in half and rolled out.  We like our crust thin and crispy.  I topped with our fav toppings and baked at 425 for approx 20 mins.  It turned out really good.  I will use this recipe from now on.  Thanks!

The name says it all - it is truly an amazing pizza crust!!  I also added a tablespoon of italian seasoning and used all whole wheat flour.  I grind my own grains and used mostly hard white wheat with a little hard red wheat.  I did end up using the full 3 1/2 cups of flour.  I couldn't be happier with the results!

Not the best crust I've had by far. Too much like a bisquick crust. It needed something, but not sure what...It was just a little too bland.

This is truly amazing! I found the recipe over a year ago and have been making it every Friday since. My 2 year old loves to help make the dough and then decorate her own pizza. The only problem I find is the serving sizes! I usually make 2 1/2 thin crust pizzas and the 3 of us manage to eat most of the pizza! Thankfully it's easily doubled for when we have friends over! Thanks to whomever posted this recipe!

This recipe is good. I wanted to make pizza dough because I have been buying it raw for a long time.  This recipe tastes good but I find it has too much of a flour taste compared to the Wegmans whole wheat pizza dough I usually buy that's absolutely delicious.   Any suggestions? more sugar, salt, more wheat flour?

What a wonderful pizza crust recipe!!!  I followed the directions and my husband, two daughters (10 & 7), 20 month old son, and I LOVED the pizzas.  The directions are easy to follow, and the results are delicious.

It was good, but I felt like it needs some tweaking still.  Maybe its just not quiet the right flavor I was looking for...I wanted something more airy and less thick - though the flavor was good.  I added some garlic powder to the mix and used all whole wheat flour.  I brushed it with garlic/olive oil, sprinkled with truffle cheese, shiitake mushrooms, roasted red potatoes, crispy proscuitto and topped with arugula once it came out of the oven.  I added my toppings to the raw dough and cooked for 16 minutes and it was perfect.  I made another with garlic/tomato sauce, mozzarella and basil for the kids and they loved it.

I used this whole wheat pizza crust for a pizza party and it was a hit. I made traditional pizzas for children and gourmet pizzas for the adults. No crust was left behind! This is a family favorite to be used often.

The best pizza crust for my family by far. I use the Gold Medal Unbleached All Purpose Flour instead of the whole wheat, which makes it a little lighter. Whenever it's pizza night I'm sure to allow myself plenty of time to prepare the dough. Rushing the process will not produce a good result.

I use this recipe all the time now. It is great. I throw all of the ingredients into my bread machine on the dough cycle and it does the heavy work, and then I cut it in half, roll out one half into a crust and make breadsticks with the other. I use all whole wheat flour and add a T. of wheat gluten to help it rise. My family loves it for our weekly pizza night! For the breadsticks, I just drizzle olive oil and sprinkle with coarse kosher salt and freshly ground pepper, and pop in the oven with the pizza. All are done in 10-12 minutes at 425. Thanks for a great recipe!

This pizza crust is great.  I used all wheat flour and made the dough in the bread machine.  Had to use about 2 cups of water because it was looking a little grainy.  Made 1 pizza and some breadsticks with butter, mozz cheese and garlic. Awesome.

I made this recipe as written and it turned out much better than expected.  My 10 yo daughter helped me make it last weekend and we froze it after the first rising.  My 21 yo daughter came home from college this weekend and we made pizza together.  She loved it!  I was afraid that she wouldn't like it but she raved about it.  Now I am going to try added spiced to the dough and then will venture out to gradually making it a complete whole wheat dough.  This is a great recipe as is though.  Thank you for a wonderful healthy version of pizza dough.

This was my first attempt at making my own pizza crust.  It turned out pretty good.  I still have to practice a bit.  What I did notice was that this dough is much easier to work with (roll-out) than the dough I buy at the store.  I will be making this again soon.

I followed the directions exactly and it made 2 hand-tossed style pizzas.  I think next time I will divide it into 3 or 4 and make thin crust pizzas instead.  Next time, I might try doing whole wheat or adding some herbs for extra flavor.  Overall, it was pretty yummy and easy to make.

For really being a novice cook, I have made this crust over and over because it's so good.  I tried the 1/2 recipe for thin crust as directed, and it was phenomenal.  I also swapped out the bleached flour and made the crust with only whole wheat flour.  The thin crust didn't rise much, which was fine by me, and it cooked very well.  AMAZING.  That said, I'm an impatient dude and wish I didn't have to wait so long to make a pizza.  An hour of wait time...after prep... I did prep the full recipe then freeze the second ball of dough and used it later, and everything remained fine.

so much better than other recipes I have tried.  I like to let the dough do another rise in the pan and then prebake the plain crust for a few minutes at 400 degrees.  This recipe has received raves!

I used all whole-wheat flour (3 1/4 cups) and added 1 teaspoon of Italian seasoning as others suggested.  It smelled awesome when it was cooking!  This came out perfect but it would be better as a "gourmet" style pizza instead of the traditional pepperoni I made with it.  In any case, very flavorful and just the right combination of fluffy/crunchy.  I loved it!

This recipe is absolutely fantastic!  I had never made my own crust before so this was a great experience.  I did bake in the oven for six minutes at 500 degrees before adding toppings as stated in previous posts.  We truly enjoyed it!  Thanks!

I have to say that as I was making it, I was skeptical based on the looks, but I really liked this a LOT!  I took some of the suggestions and used my bread machine, and baked the crust before topping.  My hubby is "white bread" kind of guy, so he will be the real test, but my kids gobbled it up without even realizing it was not my usual homemade pizza dough.  YUM!  Will make again!

Great pizza crust recipe. I used all whole wheat flour to make it South Beach friendly and it still turned out wonderfully.

GREAT healthy and inexpensive recipe!  I make 4 batches at a time, freeze the remaining 3 on cookie sheets till frozen then bag in the freezer.  When I'm making pizza then, I'll thaw it out all day on the counter or throw in a bowl of warm water for quick thaw.  VERY good, my anti whole wheat husband loves this pizza and my kids eat it up!

I have made this recipe several times exactly as stated and I love it.  I'm not bold enough to try variations, but I love it as is.  Comes out cripsy on the outside, crunchy on the inside, and is so good my husband prefers it to other white flour pizza crust recipes!

i have always had trouble making homemade pizza crust, i found this recipe and first off was excited it used whole wheat flour so i just had to try it...plus it had great reviews...now i see why...it was easy and delicious!  i made two thin crust pizzas and followed the recipe, except i did heat just the crust for about ten min. then added the toppings and put back in oven for another ten min.(approx.)...will definitely be making again...thanks for a great recipe!

I followed the recipe but took the advice of others baking the crusts alone @ 500 for 10 minutes *more than enough time in my oven*. I sauted my toppings (peppers, onions, garlic, and broccoli)and placed them first on the pie (after the sauce) and then added the cheese. This recipe is great because the crust came out just the way I hoped- crunchy on my pizza pan with holes and nice and soft on the regular pie pan. Thanks for the great recipe!

My daughter requested pizza for her birthday dinner. Since I was making more than one pizza, I made one using this crust. I added garlic and basil to the dough and used my breadmaker...about 20 min. I immediately rolled out the dough, placed the toppings and baked. This was a very good whole wheat crust. I'll definitely use again. Thanks for sharing!

I have used this recipe many times.  I follow it exactly.  I use two 11-inch dark perforated pans and the crust comes out perfectly every time; cooked through, chewy on the inside, crusty on the outside.  Instead of using pizza sauce, I start with a layer of thinly sliced tomatoes before topping with other ingredients.

My only addition was maybe a tablespoon of tarragon. Wasn't hard but is time consuming with all the proofing time. My husband does a great hand toss because he managed a pizza place for 10 years. That probably helped too. But the texture was just right and the flavor is great. Doesn't taste too "healthy" but has a bit of nuttiness as all whole wheat bread things do. Husband and I both loved it. I will be using this recipe often.

What have I done???!!! Hubby won't want to order pizza out ever again!!! He loves, loves, loves this crust. I made 1 margerita pizza with fresh basil, thin slices of tomatos and fresh mozzarella, and 1 plain old sauce and packaged, grated mozzarella pizza for my 2 girls but they ate the whole thing! I can't wait to make this again with the exquisite pizza sauce from this site....I didn't have the ingredients for that this time around but Barilla roasted garlic sauce was great. This crust is the start of homemade pizza nite once a week at our house. I can't wait to play with other toppings!

now that I reflect back, I think I may have forgotten 1 cup of whole wheat flour.  That would explain why my dough was a sticky mess.  :(  I was in a hurry to get it all into the bread machine.  I added some italian seasoning to the dough, and once it was out of the bread machine, I spread it out onto my Pampered Chef baking stone.  Even though it was traumatically ugly, I baked it at 500 for 5 minutes, then added sauce (exquisite pizza sauce from this site), and sauteed ground turkey, hot turkey sausage, green peppers, onions, and mushrooms, and baked at 425 for 15 minutes.  It was gooooood; the italian seasonings made the crust.  Ugly, but good.  Next time, I will get it right.

excellent recipe! I also used the bread machine and all whole wheat and it came out wonderfully crunchy. I will probally use the actual recipe with white flour for a less wheat-ey taste. Made a tomato sauce with extra garlic that went great with my veggie pepperoni slices, shrooms and vegan mozza (which didn't melt!! Grr!)

We just didn't like the taste of this crust for pizza. It was very easy to make though. As another person did I put it in the bread machine on the dough function. It came out very nicely. I added some Italian seasoning too. I would try this again replacing the wheat flout with white.

This was absolutely wonderful! Next time I will half the recipe for a thinner crust -- the thicker crust was just tad too bread-y for our tastes. I used the Chicken Pesto pizza recipe from this site for toppings and it was simply delish!

This is very good pizza crust. It would have been better if I had used my baking stone but overall it was awesome. Very easy to work with and it made a beautiful pizza. Tasted great as well!

highly recommended.  I made two thin crusts, and they were wonderful.  I also replaced the sugar with honey as others recommended, and it was soooooo good.  I'm making this all the time now.

Tasted great, I did use it to make 2 thin crust pizzas, it was perfectly crispy.  Only 4 stars because I did have to add an extra cup of flour to for it to knead, maybe because I used my mixer and didn't do it by hand?

This crust is by far the best one I have made and I have tried to make many. I used only whole wheat flour but it was fabulous. Soft but not too chewy and it was still crispy enough for my tastes. I'm going to be making it again shortly.

I really liked this recipe and I would have given it five stars if my 7 year old would have eaten it and my other girls would have gone nuts over it but this did not happen.  I also think that I would double this recipe next time to make a thicker crust.  Thanks for a great recipe!  My husband really liked this crust as did I

The recipe gave me two thin-crust pizzas, which I partially baked before adding the toppings.  We had ham, pineapple, green peppers and mozarella this time, but will definitely try others as well.  I froze the other crust.  Definitely a great recipe.  My husband and I each at half of the pizza!  Definitely the best pizza we've ever had.

Best pizza crust I have ever made. I partially baked one pizza crust for later and froze it.
I used 1 cup of bread flour in place of 1 cup of all purpose to get a chewyer dough.

This was the best wheat pizza crust I ever tasted!  I was a little skeptical when I was kneading the dough because it was so sticky.  I just kept adding a little flour and it worked out just fine!

I had never made my own dough before and was scared before trying this, however I was very pleasantly suprised. This pizza crust was good, but next time I will try it in my bread maker to try to lessen the time and work involved.

I may come back to this again, but the crust on tonight's pizza was a little too thick and bready for me and I thought I had it stretched pretty thin.  I'm still so new to dough making, that it could have been me though.  But I followed the recipe verbatim; too scared to experiment at this stage!

This pizza crust is great! Neither I nor my husband could find any fault with it. I am pretty new to yeast breads and followed the recipe exactly, except for cutting it in half to make just one crust.  I did have to add a tad more flour while kneading and I used a pizza stone. I topped the crust with one of the alfredo sauce recipes from this site, and added some chicken and veggies.  Yum!  Will definitely be using this recipe again.

This baked up crispy, tasty, and best of all, it was so easy!  I've never made dough before and didn't want to waste a lot of ingredients if I got it wrong, so I scaled it down to 2 servings and made two individual bases.  It did require more flour this way as the dough was to sticky to knead properly, but that was the only change I had to make to the recipe.  It stretched out easily, fluffed up quite high for what looked like a small amount of dough, and I could hardly tell it was whole wheat.  Fantastic recipe, thanks!

The pizza crust tasted fairly good; however, the crust came out too crisp at the bottom (used a pizza stone).  I also used a pizza sauce from this website "Mike's Home made Pizza" and it was fantastic!  I will make the dough again, but I will  experiment with time/heat.

It might have been the fact that Canadian wheat is harder, and thus has more gluten, but I found this recipe a little dry. On the plus side, I packed this to prepare at work for lunch -- I just cut off about a fifth of the recipe, flattened it with my hands, sprinkled some cornmeal on to a sheet of parchment paper, and rolled the whole thing up (just be sure to not let the dough touch itself). It was fantastic in a portabello, fresh pepper, and goat cheese pizza (recipe on this site)!! I'd make this again, but would add the all purpose flour in increments of 1/2 cup or less at a time. Thumbs up!

Very tasty!  I bit grainy, but that could be the flour I used.  Pair with lowfat cheese and veggies for a very healthy meal!

Everyone really raved about this recipe so it must be something I did.  I made the recipe exactly, except I had to add just a little more flour in to get the right consistency, because it was too gooey still.  I made 2 crusts, about 11" across, baked them first for about 10 mins., and then added toppings and baked again.  The crust stayed flat and chewy, almost hard.  It was not crispy on the outside and light and fluffy on the inside.  Perhaps if I had made one big pizza or used 1 cookie sheet instead.  Also, I was looking for a wheat flavor and didn't notice the taste at all.  Everyone else liked it so don't let my review dissuade you from trying.  Sorry.

Thank you so very much for this recipe.  My family and I have been trying to find healthier recipes to incorporate in our daily eating.  We made 2 thin crust and they were great.

Excellent recipe. Made with my mixer instead of manual kneading.  My old oven couldn't tolerate that kind of heat but at 350 for about 30 minutes the pizza came out really nice.  We made two thin crust 12" with dough to spare.  Highly recommend this, will try next time with some added spices.

I really liked this pizza crust.  It was just as it was described - soft on the inside and crisp on the outside.  This was the first time I had made a homemade pizza crust and it was relatively easy.

This crust was amazing. It was soft and chewy on the inside and crispy on the outside. I've always tried to make a whole wheat crust and was always unsuccessful. It takes a little bit more time than most crusts but it's well worth the time it takes.

I topped mine with grilled chicken, white onion, cheddar and mozzarella and it was delicious!  I reheated it the next day and it was still great.  The crust was a touch undercooked in the centre but overall it was still great.

I loved this pizza base.  It had a different flavour to it that I cant quite put my finger on, but I think thats what makes me like it more.
