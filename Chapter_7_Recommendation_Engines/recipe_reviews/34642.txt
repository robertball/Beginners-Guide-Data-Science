I agree with Angela & Brianne very elegant indeed. The sauce gives it a lovely lift without taking anything away from the salmon just enhancing it. Deane from Australia.

This was good salmon!  I do wish I had added more salt and pepper, and it probably could have used more than the whole day of marinating I gave it.  I found myself wanting a little of the sauce over the finished salmon, but the hazelnuts did make this very tasty.  Thanks for the recipe!  EDIT:  In thinking more about this dish, I wish I would have saved off a little of the marinade in the beginning, thickened it a little, and poured it over the finished fish.  I'll have to try that!

A touch bland. Would benefit from longer marinade time which I did not do
