Very excellent base recipe!  Rated 4 stars instead of 5 for unnecessary prep time.  

I made a couple preparation changes which simplified and cut the time
.
1. Whizzed olive oil and raw garlic with stick blender, spread on pizza crust and skipped the pre-baking garlic step
.
2. Sliced pears thinly and skipped pre-baking them as well.  They were nice and tender nonetheless.

Substituted feta cheese for the mozzarella, which gave a great tangy-ness against the sweetness of the pears.  My 14 y/o daughter said "this taste's awesome!" and hubby said, "you could open a restaurant with this pizza".    Will definitely make again with the above changes.

Thanks for the great idea, Bostoncook!

This was really good, I liked the combination of salty and sweet.  I thin sliced the pears, and I also raosted the garlic and cooked the pears at the same time in the oven.  Will make again.

This pizza is soooo good!  When first reading the ingredients, I didn't see how Swiss would be the right cheese for this pizza....but it was perfect.  Making it again tonight!

This pizza is great. Instead of just the mashed garlic, I added the roasted garlic to a balsamic fig reduction, added a little honey and oil, and blended, then just put a thin coat of this sauce on the dough and followed the rest of the recipe as directed.

This was really, really good.  We loved the saltiness of the prosciutto balanced with the sweetness of the sliced pears.  I used a prebaked flatbread for the crust.  I also used canned pears that I drained well and sliced.  (I skipped the baking of the pears as they were soft out of the can.)  This one is definitely going in the rotation.  Thanks for an awesome and unique recipe, bostoncook.

I absolutely love this but because of the alterations I made to the recipe I am only giving it 4 stars. I used garlic naan bread (already cooked) instead of pizza dough because it is more personal sized. I also used a small amount of pesto as a sauce and then diced up the cooked garlic and sprinkled it on pesto. After placing pears, I drizzled honey over them, then put prosciutto and mozzerella and gorgonzola crumbs for a stronger cheese flavor. Turned out amazing!

This is wonderful.  The flavors truly compliment each other.  I used flat bread purchased at Whole Foods for the crust.  It made for a quick and easy yet different appetizer.

Yum! I thought this was an excellent combo. I loved the Swiss and mozzerella together. I followed the recipe exactly except I used a prebaked crust instead of an unbaked crust. My pears were not as ripe as I wished they were, but they came out perfectly when roasted as directed. I think very ripe pears could probably go directly on the pizza without pre-roasting. Great method for quick-roasting garlic. Thanks for the recipe!

This pizza was AWESOME.  I was invited to a fig, pear, and beet party so this was perfect.  The best part was the goat cheese mozz I used instead of cow's milk mozz!!

This was pretty good I was just surprised at how much all the cheese over took the pears and they really weren't that sweet.  Next time I might do without the swiss.  I really just didn't get much sweetness that I wanted from the pears.  Loved the way the garlic is done in this though.  4 stars.

I made this for an office party, and I was very nervous about pear on a pizza. I am new to cooking, and pears with prosciutto seemed beyond strange to me, but I figured I would try it to impress my new coworkers. I made one pizza as a tester, and it didn't last 20 minutes, between me, my boyfriend and his friend. It was excellent! I made two more pizzas to take to work, and everyone could not get enough! I even had to print out this recipe to give to a couple of women who were begging for it.

A little time consuming, but yummy.  I also roasted the garlic and pears together. Am giving four stars b/c the yumminess and time it takes don't quite match.  More yumminess needed for me to take the time to make this pizza, just my preference...

I thought this was going to be phenomenal but it was alright. I followed the directions and used d'anjou pears (very ripe and lovely!) The pizza was 1/4 eaten - it's a nice taste but I've tasted better pizzas. Thanks for the recipe though!

Good but not a whole lot of flavor. I would have added more proscuitto and spices. Maybe add parmesan to instead of some of the mozerella.

Very good...different combination but went very well together...definitely slice the pears smaller.  Would like to come up with an alternative to the roasted garlic only because it's a pain.

Deliciously Unique! I made this on Garlic Naan instead of pizza dough, added some Basil/Tomato Feta, and (accidentally) omitted the Swiss Cheese, and it still turned out great!

I will definitely make this again. My only suggestion is to cut the pears in thin slices, probably skipping the pre-baking of them. Those chunks were definitely too big.

This pizza was delicious! I had a problem though rolling out the refrigerated pizza dough.....it wouldn't roll out, just stayed in a ball. Any suggestions on using the premade pizza dough? Next time I might use Boboli or make my own dough. I think I might also add more garlic. Overall, the pizza was very good and my husband and I enjoyed it.

Interesting tastes and would make a nice appetizer - I didn't use mozzarella, though, and used Gorgonzola instead as I like a stronger flavor with the pears.  I also didn't cook the pears ahead of time as mine were very ripe - I think if I cooked them ahead, they would have been too mushy.  I'll definitely make this again.

As another reviewer stated I used a Naan Garlic flat bread as my crust.  Then added 1 clove of minced garlic and olive oil as my base. Made the recipe as directed otherwise.  Loved the pear and prosciutto combo, with swiss and mozarella.  Then finished it off with a drizzle of balsamic vinegar.  Cooked it for 15 minutes on a cookie sheet, don't put it directly on oven rack as it will drip.  I like thin and crispy crust, it didn't get as crispy as I would have preferred but still wonderful.  Thank You!

I followed the recipe, did roast garlic and pears concurrently. We loved it! Might add feta and red pepper flakes next time for a little zip.

My family and friends love this pizza! I've made it several times, both as written and with adjustments, and it's always yummy and impressive-looking. If you want to save time, use the chopped roasted garlic in a jar, a Boboli-type crust and don't prebake the pears.  Prebaking does have the advantage of drying the pears a bit, which can keep the crust from getting soggy.  I've used goat's milk mozzarella before, which adds a little more tanginess.  You can also make mini-sized pizzas and slice them thinly for an appetizer plate.  Thanks for upping the creativity of my supper repetoire, Bostoncook!

Delicious.  The pear flavor is subtle but adds just enough sweetness to complement the other ingredients nicely.  The roasted garlic in the crust is a nice touch.  I used a Pillsbury refrigerated crust and did not preheat the baking sheet.  Otherwise I followed the recipe as written.
