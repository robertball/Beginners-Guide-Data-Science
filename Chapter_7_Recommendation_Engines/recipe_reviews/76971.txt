This is an excellent sauce...perfect with Steak.  It makes the steak!  I coat my steaks with oil, salt and pepper and throw them on an extremely hot skillet.  They cook fast!  When they are off, the sauce takes about 3 minutes.

This was good. I changed it, though. I added beef broth instead of chicken, and spicy brown mustard instead of dijon. I also put in a clove of garlic. Delicious!

Added some pepper and chopped shallots. Used a Napa Valley cab. Liked this but didn't love it.

I made this sauce with steak, it literally takes 5 minutes, very easy, and tastes great.  It was a lot lighter then expected, my boyfriend didnt think it was all that amazing, he said it didnt have enough kick.

Wine and mustard worked really well in this. Need to use a bold Cabernet for this one. I added garlic as well

Made this with a beef tenderloin and mashed potatoes. Was absolutely perfect. Used the juices from the skillet for the sauce as well.
