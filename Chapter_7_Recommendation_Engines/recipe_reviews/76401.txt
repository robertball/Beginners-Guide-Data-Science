This is good. It is different kinda sweet and I do agree, make with all of the ingredients. I am not a big fan of green peppers but I followed the advice given and I am glad I did. Then you can adjust if you want to. I think that next time I might just add alittle more jalapeno just to spice it up a bit. Took a tally at the Super Bowl game and they thought it was  great!! Thanks Redirg !! I will make this again.

I needed to find a dip that was gluten-free and dairy-free. This fit the bill. I’ve made it twice and it’s a big hit. I've been told I have to bring this to every get together. 

The best way to describe the taste is a sweet-hot spaghetti sauce. I end up not taking it all to the party, so the leftovers I just throw into spaghetti sauce or chili I have in the freezer.

I partially agree that you should add all the ingredients the first time you make it. I’ve made it twice and the only substitution I would suggest is instead of jalapenos, use red pepper flakes. The first time I made this with jalapenos there was no heat, so I added a few sprinkles of red pepper flakes. The second time I made it I skipped the hassle of chopping jalapenos and added 1.5- 2 teaspoons of red pepper flakes. (I don’t like things too hot and this was the perfect amount of slow-building heat.)

Quick summary of my changes—no jalapenos, 1.5-2 tsp. red pepper flakes, jar of roasted red peppers (instead of pimentos) and 1.5 TBSP sugar.

This is really good.  I too say make with all the ingredients, then if you want to tweak do it on the second go around.  I think I would omit the sugar as is it on the sweet side.  I was happy that the jalapeno did not overpower this.  It does need to simmer to marry the flavors.

I've had this recipe for years and just never got around to making it.  Well, made it yesterday to enjoy with the football games, and I have to say, DH and I were a little disappointed.  Made the recipe just as printed - another reviewer said it tasted like a sweet spaghetti sauce- and that is a fair take.  Served it with Fritos, but sorry, it just didn't float our boat.  Thanks for submitting though.
