Very simple. Very quick and very tasty! I loved this recipe. I followed the recipe exactly and added half an onion, sliced very thin, and sauteed until very tender and transparent. A great side item with this recipe is the chicken Stove Top with the extra thickened sauce on top. Great! Thanks!

This is a great recipe to get on the table in no time flat.  I served it with wild rice and corn.  Easy, fast, very little clean up.   I did not have the canned soup so I substituted 1 packet of dry Lipton Onion Soup mix in 1.5 cups of water.   Very flavorful gravy.

With apologies to Campbell's, lacking a can of French Onion soup, I used left-over beef gravy from the Christmas roast, sauteed some sliced onion (and diced mushroom bits) in first the oil and then the added brown suger, and let the chops simmer in the mixture until tender. If handy, a splash of red wine would be nice. Tasty dish, and one I will make again.

This was a great meal. The onion soup & brown sugar combination made a glaze that had the perfect amount of sweetness. Even my fiance loved it.

The chops/sauce were very very salty and sweet.  Almost uneatable.

These were really good.  I loved the taste.  I overbrowned the pork chops by accident, but I couldn't tell that much.  I really loved the sweet and sour taste of the gravy.  Yummy!!

This was a great recipe and I followed to the letter.  I had the really thin pork chops and this worked out great for them.  Next time, however, I would half or omit the sugar altogether.  It was just too sweet.  Otherwise great and I will make again!

Quick, easy and good enough to make again, on occasion though. After reading the other reviews, I decided to switch things up a bit. Cut the brown sugar in half, seasoned the meat with fresh ground black pepper, granulated garlic and some granulated onion. I also used unsalted butter. I would like to think that it all helped to tame the sweetness a bit and it turned out perfect for my first try. I will make it again however I feel that it's not something that we could eat all of the time. Just "once in awhile". Great for something different for dinner.

I make this at least twice amonth for my family... I always triple the gravy (soup) and serve with mashed potato. That way there are always leftovers! I love how simple this is and they love it!
