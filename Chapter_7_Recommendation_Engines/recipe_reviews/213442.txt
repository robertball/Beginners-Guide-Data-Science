I made these for an outdoor concert at Ravinia.  Please look at the serving size.  I missed that part  before mixing up the cream cheese mixture.  These were very good but a little oily.  Perfect for the venue that they were prepared for.

Fantastic recipe! I cut the recipe in half, using 3 tortillas and one 8-oz. cream cheese, but I used almost 1/4 pound each of the meats and cheeses and about 3/4 of a 16-oz. jar of store-bought muffuletta salad (olive salad). Like I always do when making pinwheels, I cut the rounded edges off the tortillas to make them square before I spread on the cream cheese so there's less waste. These were very quick and easy to make and tasted great....a lot like a muffuletta sandwich, but less filling. My guests loved them.

The flavor is great but I'm giving it 3 instead of 5 stars because the ingredient quantities are way off.  I made it exactly as posted but the quantity of olive mixture was WAY less than shown in the video.   Double the olive amounts to get something resembling the video.  As is, you get tiny dots of olive mix on each tortilla.  The cream cheese amount is spot on.  The meats and cheeses were a little scanty compared to the video so I'd increase these by 1/2 if I made this again.

These were very tasty.  I will definitely make these again.  A suggestion for those making them...the olive dressing didn't go as far as it needed to compared to the cream cheese mixture.  I will double the olive dressing next time.

I gave this 5 stars because its a great basic recipe. I too used a pre-made olive mix. Used whole wheat tortillas and omitted the cream cheese and used a tomato-basil hummus instead. I also omitted the olive oil dried seasonings. Lots of oohs and aahs - nothing was left!

I made these for my daughter's birthday party and used only organics/no nitrates/raw ingredients directly exchanged for the listed.  Oh, goodness!  I'm so glad I doubled the batch because they were inhaled by kids and adults alike!  Definitely going in the "keep" file!

These were super tasty! I used garden vegetable flavored cream cheese instead and didn't add anything to it. I also left out the salami and mozzarella and they were still very filling. They disappeared pretty quickly at my party!

Not bad. I made Amazing Muffaletta Olive Salad to use for these pinwheels, and it was perfect.

Have had the yummy Muffuletta from Central Grocery in NOLA with a group of friends several years back and hoped that these pinwheels would fit the bill for a Labor Day party that included that same group. I used prepared Solestado Muffuletta Olive Salad that I picked up in Costco (adding a bit more red wine vinegar) and went with ham, combo of Genoa salami and pepperoni, and mozzarella (which was the only cheese I had on hand other than the cream cheese...oh, yeah,  I spread the cream cheese on the tortillas and simply sprinkled on the garlic powder and dried oregano...didn’t want an additional bowl to clean) Was super easy to put together and they were a hit! I kept seeing folks going back for another couple of slices. Thanks very much for posting! I’m glad I was inspired to give this a try!

Very good but definitely need to put olive salad or whatever over about half the tortilla. Doing just a row does not carry enough of the flavor.

I wasn't paying attention and I mixed the olives with the cream cheese.  Actually, I think that was better since it allowed for an even distribution of the olives.  I sliced the meat and cheese into strips and put the slices all over the tortillas for more even distribution, and I used shredded mozzarella.  I think more olives would have given them better flavor.  I made these for a pot luck, and while many were eaten, I didn't hear any raves.

Best pinwheel recipe I've made overall... like others, I doubled the olive salad portion.  Next time I will spread it out over 6 or 7 tortillas instead of 5, to make them easier to roll...

Thought these were great!  Did a test run with them before making them for a wedding reception.  The only difference was I added some sour cream to the cream cheese and mixed the olives with the cream cheese mixture.  Very good.

Husband wants this to become our go to appetizer. Was very good and even was a hit with my toddlers. I did a number of the suggestions like using 1/2crm cheese and 1/2 sun dried tomato as well as doubling the olive spread.

This was a big hit. I made as directed but after reading the other reviews I made a few quantity changes. I didn’t need as many so I used 3 extra large tortillas (about 12-13 inches) halved the cream cheese and spices but left all of the other ingredient quantities the same (olive mixture, meat, cheeses). Yum!

I chopped the olives and combined with spices and cream cheese leaving out the oil and spread over tortillas before layering meat and cheese.  While we really liked these they just didn't stand out to us.

Loved the recipe!  Read the reviews before I made it and I'm glad I did!  Followed one reviewers example and doubled the olive mix - gald I did that!  I'm an olive lover, and I liked the coverage with double the olives.  Made it for a potluck at work and the pinwheels were gone in a flash.  Will make again.

Delicious. My whole family loved it.  They want to make sure when they come to visit I make the pinwheels. Have been making Muffuletta sandwiches for years.  These are just as good and not nearly so heavy.
