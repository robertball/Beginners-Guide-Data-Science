For those who thought the cookies were too thin, you didn't follow the recipe!   These cookies are basic, but oh so delicious.  No changes to the recipe are necessary.   Like any cookie, if you over mix in the flour, or let the butter get too soft, they will flatten out.  Mine were picture perfect, and tasted so sweet with a tad of the honey cinnamon taste.    I try not to eat sweets, but gobbled up six before I had a chance to pack them up.   Yummy!!!!

The only reason this got four stars is that it spread wayyy too much.  I would suggest to spread the batter in a 9"x13"x2" (height) pan, and then cut them up and serve them as bars.  It tastes just as good, but you prevent the cookies from spreading out all over the place!

Really nice cookies, very easy to make and perfect for when you dont have many ingredients on hand!  I poped my dough in the fridge for about 10 min while the oven preheated and they were perfect.

I followed the recipie exactly how it was writen. The cookies came out wonderful! I do recomend to mix cinnimon and sugar and sprinkle it on top of the cookies RIGHT when they come out of the oven.  They are delisious! I might add some chocolate bits to them next time.

These cookies are soft and chewy, but almost taste like a ginger snap. They are simply wonderful. Easy to make and easy to bake. The batch isn't huge, which is good for our waistlines,but double it if you want to feed people than a few.

My dad and brother really liked these cookies. Personally, I didn't like them that much. The cookies turn out really flat and have a feeling of being undercooked (but my dad really likes that). So go figure... I guess the verdict isn't clear on this one: jury's divided.

I made a half-batch based on the mixed reviews.  Also, due to others' complaints about flat cookies, I popped the dough in the fridge to chill before baking.  The first batch came out insanely flat.  I added 2 tbsp flour to the second batch, but it didn't help.  Though it was tasty and I do intend to make them again, these didn't work for me as-is.  I will definitely try again with more spice, less butter, and definitely more flour.

Made this for my older brothers, They all loved it and my 15 year old brother even packed up 5 for Lunch at high school the next day. The people that wound up with flat ones must have not followed the recipe, mine turned out just like the picture, but I only got about 2 dozen. Maybe it was me making them to big, Or was it the multiple trips to the batter my brothers made?? Anyways, this is a GREAT cookie for parties, your family, anything. and I suggest using sour-wood honey! but for extra sweet, Orange blossom honey!

Wonderful cookies! I added an additional 1/2 cup of flour. Plus I put the cookies in the refrigerator for 20 mins before cooking them. Great recipe!

Average cookies. Easy to make, and I didn't have too much trouble with them spreading like others did. i did howeve,r have the slightly undercooked texture that one reviewer mentioned. They were ok when warm, and the batter was yummy!;) But once they cooled they were not that great. i can't really put my finger on what was wrong...maybe too gooey? I didn't get as much cinnamon flavor as I would have liked either, they were almost too sweet. (I know, weird thing to say about a cookie.) I think they were over mixed, hence the congealed batter texture. My fiance's daughter helped me and she mixed extra hard, haha. The only things I did differently were using wheat flour, (What I had at the time) and I tried the adding cereal thing (frosted flakes and that didn't work, but since that wasn't part of the original recipe, my review is based on the rest of the cookie.)

This was easy to follow, I think I over beat it not intending to, I have made fluffy cookies that look like its a cake batter but not before, this recipe wasn;t the case.  They were flat but still tasted okay, I might try to make these again in a different oven.  I'd suggest reading everyones comments before attempting to bake these.

These were tasty cookies, but just not the texture that I rave about- thin, and chew.  After reading some reviews I think I may have over mixed them so it may be a recipe I will make again and be cautious with mixing. I made some plain and some with chocolate chips and some with coconut- The coconut was my favorite by far!

I found that these cookies had okay flavour, not great but okay. The cookies turned out nice and soft, but they spread quite a bite. I would make these again but I would add flour (1/2 cup more) and maybe a little allspice for more flavour or just additional cinnamon.

Not impressive, we probably won't make them again.  Tasted like little pancakes.  I added a butter icing and it didn't help much.

These are my absolute favorite cookies!  If you like sugar cookies and honey, you will love these!  They come out soft due to the honey.  I always cook them for 15 minutes because they are never brown around the edges and were way too undercooked when I followed the 7-10 minute directions.

These are AWESOME!!! I eyeballed my measurements of butter and honey, doubled the cinnamon and added a cup of raisin bran (without the raisins, I are all of those) to the dry mixture before combining. I also didn't have brown sugar on hand so I used a bit less white sugar. They did not flatten out, however I did hand mix the wet ingredients (no mixer) and handled the dough to shape them into little balls before placing them on an ungreased cookie sheet (no wax paper) ... they did not stick, don't worry. This recipe is VERY forgiving. I would not suggest melting the butter before mixing. Just strong arm that batter and you should do fine. Will be making these again and again.

I made these for the kids while they were out playing in the snow and had to control myself, because I almost ate them all before they came in! They have a very strong honey taste (hints the name). I was very careful not to over mix them after reading some of the other reviews and they turned out GREAT. The only thing I changed was that I added half a bag of chocolate chips as we are a chocolate eating family.

Very delicious! They do flatten out but not more than any other cookies. I topped mine with some cinnamon and sugar. I also did another batch with banana extract. It added just a little something extra that was really good as well. Only complaint is that the recipe only made about a bakers dozen and not the 36 that it says but other than that really good cookies.

I was kind of disappointed with this recipe. Although my cookies turned out a little flatter than I would have hoped, that wasn't the problem. I followed the recipe exactly but found that these cookies lacked flavor. They would be better with vanilla or nuts added in, or maybe a glaze on top. They had a nice consistency, but all I could taste was sweetness, not honey or cinnamon. This recipe has potential but definitely needs improvement.

I was hoping for a simple but good cookie, like a shortbread cookie. I made these without alterations and they were BLAH. The first ones came out tasting undercooked and doughy so I left the next batch in longer but then they were slightly burned on the bottom. My husband said he liked them and they all got eaten but I won't be making these again.

I know these cookies by the name of Honey Drop cookies. My mom has been making these as long as I can remember. The only difference is Honey Drops are sandwich cookies. Using your favorite jam or marmelade. We have always used my grandmas homemade apple butter. Sandwich when the cookies are just a little warm still as this helps the apple butter to soak into the cookie just a little.

These are great! I made them gluten free with rice flour (not a blend) and they turned out soft and chewy, sweet and delicious. A fabulous addition to any fall menu. Loved by kids and adults, too.

The recipie is very good. the cookie melts in your mouth.  I found it to be a little sweet so next time i'll cut down the honey a little bit.  I added some mini chocolate chips--turned out good.  then I also added some coconut--reduce the honey even more if adding this.  I gave it a 4 only because the recipie as is is a little sweet for me.

pretty good, but plain, like the honey in the recipe, nice alternative to sugar with a sweet taste, would probably make them again if I wanted a simple cookie recipe.

the cookies tasted GREAT, my friend's described them as "sugar cookies on crack", because they have a similar flavor, but the honey gives them a bit of a boost.  I was disappointed in the texture and shape, the recipe is very touchy so you have to follow it exactly or they turn out a bit gooey...but its taste that matters right?

I make these all the time, but I roll them into balls or use a small ice cream scoop to get them round and perfect. A little sticky, yes, but try it, you'll like it. Also make sure to use hard margarine, I don't melt marg as a rule with cookies.
Also, keep in mind that there are different kinds of honey, which will effect the flavor. I usually use clover honey from the farmers market.

I made no changes to the recipe. I did not chill the dough.  The cookies turned out beautifully. I did put a pecan on the top of each cookies before baking . I will be using this recipe a lot in the future and adding different touches.

We weren’t a big fan of these. The flavor is just ok, not really worth making. They did flatten out a ton so I chilled the dough and added an extra half a cup of flour which helped. The consistency was very odd, almost like they absorbed all the moisture in the room even though they were fresh. I won’t be making these again.

First time making these this morning. My Daughter is working with some others to supply lunches for kids going to Summer School so I made a double batch of these. I LOVE them and will be sad to give them all away to the kiddos! LOL I did put a little sugar/cinnamon mixture on top. They are somewhat thin but very soft. Took about 15 min in my oven. I used Texas wildflower honey. Yummy, Yummy, Yummy.

These are delish!  Here is a helpful hint to prevent any drop cookie from spreading- use bread flour rather than all purpose flour. Bread flour has more protein and is "stronger" I used bread flour in this recipe and they didn't spread too much.

These cookies are yuuuumy! I tweaked the recipe to make a bit healthier too. I substituted the brown sugar with coconut palm sugar, flour: 1/2 C whole wheat, 1 C unbleached flour, 1/2C instant Oates.  Before putting in the oven I sprinkled with cinnamon/sugar. I think the whole wheat flour and Oates made them fluffier and not runny or thin. Just delicious. Oh, I also put about a 1/4 tsp of lemon zest. Great holiday cookie. ??

I read the reviews before trying this one, 'cuz you guys are just so helpful here! And I was very glad I did. I did not change anything but at least I was forewarned about the result. They smell heavenly while baking! But mine, too, fell very flat. They actually looked liked un-flipped pancakes. The first batch did seem underdone, gooey, almost greasy.  I tried baking the next batch a bit longer. They seem to have set better, but are still gooey in the middle. All that being said, my daughter loved them and kept coming back for more. I will definitely try this again, but will try some if the changes other people have suggested.

Followed recipe as written, but maybe with less brown sugar (mine was clumpy). Very good! They're really soft, but in a good way, and I'm not a soft-cookier.

Great honey flavor and the texture is interesting, I enjoyed it but others found it odd. I found it was really important to stick these in the fridge for a bit before putting them in the oven, they do have a tendency to spread and keeping the dough chilled helps with that. Thanks for sharing!

I'm going to roll the dough into a waxed paper cylinder, then chill and slice it.  An older friend taught me this trick with her walnut cookies. I will add vanilla. I'm doing an Arabian/Phoenician  meal (Chawarma, or Shah-warma) and needed honey cookies for my  fruit dessert, all ingredients would have been commonly found except white flour.

Fabulous!  We're not big sugar eaters, and this was wonderfully tasty and rich without being sickeningly sweet.  Thanks!

These cookies are so easy to make and they turn out so delicious! Perfect over tea or as a snack. They might work for an ice cream sandwich too!

Did not taste like cookies.  After the first batch I added chocolate chips and butterscotch chips to the rest of the batter in order for them to have some flavor and to make them SOMEWHAT resemble a cookie.  They tasted like pancakes, as one reviewer said.
