A good, quick dinner.  I doubled the recipe and it turned very good.  A nice blend of flavors.  I did add an extra package of ramen noodles as I used a little more than 2 pounds of ground beef.  Since the tomatoes contained liquid, I opted not to use the water as I thought it might water down the beef flavoring.  It seemed to be just right.  A keeper for a quick meal.  The leftovers were good too!

I can't believe this recipe is on here, I always thought my mom created this. My mom used to make this for me growing up. Money was tight, and what is cheaper than canned corn and ramen? I make it for my husband to take to work for lunch, as it heats up even better. I always add at least a half of an onion. I usually add 2 packets of ramen, but usually only 1 flavoring packet, to cut down on salt. I try to get the canned diced tomatoes with a seasoning in them, like oregano and basil to add flavor. Not gourmet, but leftovers are great for lunch.

Surprisingly good!  Used turkey, added a whole onion, some garlic, and two packs ramen noodles.  Kids liked it and so did I.  It was cheap, too!

I was so impressed with this meal!  Not only did I happen to have the ingredients, but it looked and tasted like I had spent a lot of time preparing this wonderful creation!!  I did what the previous reviewer suggested and didn't add the water. Also, I used ground turkey and chicken flavored ramen noodles instead of the beef because that is what I had on hand

This recipe is so easy and tastes amazing! The best part is that it tastes even better reheated the next day. I added some shredded cheddar cheese to top it off and it made it taste even better!

I didn't really like the taste too much but my family loved it! I think I may try adding different things to it to see if I like it better. I didn't have any diced tomatoes so I used a can of tomato soup. I think I'll try adding a few spices.

I really wanted to like this recipe but in the end it just wasn't great. Honestly though I think a big part of that was because of the ramen noodles I used. I used a beef flavored package that was a brand I hadn't tried before. The beef flavoring of these was just really strange and I think that was the biggest problem. The other thing was that it just didn't look very appealing. I'm big on casseroles and skillet dinners and I don't need my meals to always look beautiful. This just really did not look appetizing at all.  In the end I ate it but my husband and kids really didn't like it. My seven year old thought it was "really nasty hamburger helper." Again though I think this was in big part because of the ramen noodle flavoring. I'd like to try this againw with the oriental flavor that the recipe calls for but I don't think I could get my family to try it again.

Our family was not impressed (although we may try adding taco seasoning instead of the ramen seasoning if we try again.)

I had to adjust recipe due to family dislikes canned tomatoes. Added two 8 oz cans of tomatoe sauce only had chicken flavored Ramens I melted cheese on top to serve. Husband stated he probably wouldn't request meal but would eat it if made again.
