Oh My Oh My what a ham!! I made this for Easter and fixed it exactly as written but I didn't need all the water.  Full of moister and great taste too! I also added a teaspoon of ground cloves to the sugar mixture. My family LOVED this ham!! Thank You Thank YOU aellis0923. A True keeper:) YYYEEEAAAHHH BTW, the sauce this ham creates along with it's own juices is terrific on sweet potatoes, which I served along with roasted asparagus, mushrooms,mashed roasted potatoes and rolls. Delish Dish:)Bon Appetit!

Wonderful, good, moist ham.  I made this ham with only a few changes.  Cut about an inch diamond pattern over the outside approximately 1/4 inch deep, place a clove in the center of each diamond.  Insert a cherry on a toothpick and insert that into the ham and add a pineapple ring - do this over the entire ham. No water, just placed the ham cut side down in a foil lined 9 x 13 baking dish and cooked at 325 for about 1 1/2 hours.  Mix the rest of the ingredients along with the drained pineapple juice and cook in the microwave for 3-5 minutes untill thickened.  Use the mixture to baste the ham every 15 to 20 minutes for the next 1 1/2 hours.

This was DELICIOUS!  I wanted a sweet thick sauce to pour over the meat to transport easier to a carry-in banquet, and this worked great!  While baking the ham as directed, I prepared the glaze over low heat in a sauce pan, with a tad of the pineapple and cherry juice stirred in. When the ham was done I cut it into slices/pieces and placed them in a crock pot.  I then mixed a little of the ham (water) juices from the baking pan in with the glaze to make it a little thinner.  I poured the glaze over the ham slices and added the pineapple chunks and cherries and stirred to mix it all up.  I got lots of compliments, and the ham was so moist cooked this way!  LOVED IT!

When my son said he wanted ham for his 5th birthday dinner, I freaked out.  I had never made a ham a day in my life.  My mom suggested buying the already cooked ham cubes and mixing it in with mac and cheese.  I was bound and determined to make him a ham with all the fixins.  This one was the first one I came across that looked good to me so I tried it.  I followed the directions to a tee.  The only thing I did differently was placed the ham directly in the pan (no rack as I didn't have one) with the water right in it like stated.  Three hours later, it was dinner time and I was stressing.  I had no back up plan and my whole family was hungry.  This was the most amazing ham I had ever eaten in all of my existance.  I had so many compliments.  Thank you so much for posting this.  This recipe is so fool-proof, its unreal.  I felt no need to make any changes to the recipe.   I will definitely make this again.  Who knows, maybe I'll confidently take on Easter dinner this year.  Thanks again!

Fantastic recipe. One change that I made was to use a little lemon juice and then add juice from the can of pineapple to reduce the coating to the right consistency.

I gave this 5 stars because the ham was so juicy and tender. I didn't like the honey in the glaze, probably because I'm not a huge fan of honey.  so I mixed brown sugar and yellow mustard for a glaze!

I decided to make this recipe on Mother's Day! OMG this turned out to be the best ham I've ever made. Everyone loved it and raved about how moist and flavorful it was. I made it EXACTLY as indicated. No modifications required as far as I'm concerned.  This recipe is a keeper!  Thanks!!!

OMG!!! We made this for my husband's birthday dinner. As I'm typing, he's still sitting there saying, "Oh my gosh!!," and, "Really?"
I honestly think this is the best ham I've ever eaten, and so does he. We don't care for the extra candying of the pineapple and cherries...instead we had applesauce on the side. But I can assure you, even without those extras, this was the best ham we've ever had. Thank you so much for making me look good on a special day! :-)

So delicious!  We have some kiddos with pineapple allergies, so I left off the pineapple and cherries but kept the other ingredients the same.  My oven was busy with other things, so I cooked this in a roaster oven.  I was a little worried that it wouldn't form a nice crust in there, but I was wrong!  It was so moist, so permeated with flavor, and had an excellent crust.  We will definitely be making this again!  Thanks, aellis0923!

My ham turn out excellent; the best I've made yet! I followed the instructions with minor changes. I used yellow mustard instead of dry and corn syrup instead of honey only because its what I had on hand.  I also added a little pineapple juice to the mixture.  When the ham was done.  I added the cherries and pineapples and secured with tooth picks. I poured the sauce mixture over the ham and put it back in the oven for 15 minutes.  It was moist, looked great and tasted even better!  Everyone LOVED it!  Thanks for a wonderful recipe.

I started out at 400F, but had to turn it down to 350F, as it was burning my ham too fast. The ham came out super juicy and moist! I would make again. Thank you for the recipe!

I had to add some liquid because mine was not turning into a paste. Additionally, much of the baste burned onto the ham, which made those outside pieces inedible, and overall, while it probably reduced some of the saltiness, this did not really flavor the ham well. I did, however, enjoy eating the pineapples.

I used this recipe for a Christmas Ham. I substituted the Honey with Pure Maple Syrup and It was Impeccable! I skimmed the dripping when finished cooking and then added Black Coffee from my pot to Thin into a Gravy, Not your socks Off! Just remember, Do not Cover the Ham with foil or Lid when baking, I did and the bottom of the ham split.  I saved it though, Wonderful Ham!

I made this for Thanksgiving this year and it was fabulous! I did cut the diamonds and score them with cloves as someone had recommended in the comments. I also added some of the pineapple and cherry juice to my glaze mix! I basted it with the glaze for the last hr. Next time I will make double the glaze because I felt I could have used more, but that is just personal preference!

Wow! Who knew perfect baked ham could be so easy? I didn't have a rack, didn't use the pineapples & cherries and still this is by far the best ham I have ever baked. It reminded me of the ham from the famous Honey Baked Ham company in my area. My son says it was the best ever. Thanks so much for sharing this wonderfully easy and delicious recipe.

I am now the biggest fan of this recipe! I was SO forgiving. I had no idea that my probe thermometer was not reading correctly until after I had cooked my ham for 3+ hours and checked with the instant-read thermometer. Thought all was lost. In fact I apologized to my husband beforehand, thinking that the ham would be dry. It was NOT. It was amazing, moist, and the best ever! Thank you for my new favorite baked ham recipe.

Just made this today, it tastes so good and very moist. I made some tiny adjustments, switch the mustard out for garlic powder, 2 cups of brown sugar and I had the crushed pineapple so I drizzled it all over the top. My roaster is huge so I used just over 8 ups.

Oh, this was so good!! I only used a little water mixed with the juices from the ham and used a 9x13 glass baking dish. I used 2 tbl. spicy brown mustard instead of powder and sprinkled in some cloves to the baste. I cut some fresh pineapple in chunks instead of canned. I didn't have the cherries. I started basting the ham right from the start and made extra, stirring some in with the water and juices in the bottom of pan so all could drizzle some on their meat and potatoes as desired while eating. Oh, and I covered the ham loosely  with foil while baking. The whole family love this!!

Oh My Gosh!  There is no reason this should be as good as it is!  This turned out wonderful. I made it for the entire Family's  Easter meal (no pressure there, right) and we were so happy with the results. Amazing how moist and tender it was.  I'll never cook a ham any other way.

This was both easy and delicious! I had to add about 3 Tbsp water to the paste because it was so dry (I think my honey was a bit "old"). I scored the ham before cooking and added the glaze half hour before as per directions, basting once. I didn't use pineapple and cherries, it was plenty sweet enough as it was. They would look pretty but I was cooking for a bunch of men so that didn't matter as much. They loved it!

I made this glaze exactly as indicated, but did not add the fruit at the end. I do like pineapple on ham and the cherries make it really pretty, but I made a spicy cherry jelly on the side instead. As for the glaze, it was exactly what I wanted. It thickened beautifully with the addition of the flour, had a great balance of flavor from the brightness of the lemon juice and the depth of the dry mustard, all harmonizing nicely with the general sweetness. I liked that the honey was included, adding a broader base than the brown sugar alone. It was very simple, added some beautiful color due to the caramelization, and was a huge hit with everyone present. For what it's worth, it also paired wonderfully with the cherry concoction, which gave it the fruitiness it was designed to work with as well as a little heat to couple with the sweet (the cherry stuff is actually meant to be a glaze, too, but we served it on the side for dipping hams, mixing with baked sweet potatoes, onions, & apples, or adding to rolls with butter. Thank you so much for sharing!

I made this recipe for Easter, it was delicious. The ham was moist & not salty. I was preparing quite a few dishes in the oven, so I used a Nesco roaster for the ham. That's the only thing I did differently.

I altered the recipe. Yes I did place quarter cup of water in pan..My glaze was made with mustard, vinegar, pineapple juice, brown sugar and orange marmalade. Yes marmalade. My grandmother always used vinegar and mustard to tenderize the pork. Old southern trick. I used pineapple slices and navel orange slices to cover ham.  Baked at 400 degrees for 30 minutes. Turned oven down to 350. Began using second covering of glaze.  It was delicious. My family even tasted the garnish.

fantastic glaze. the only difference I make is the temperature, and I cut a diamond pattern into the ham as well. I begin at 350 and end at 325. I think 400 would be too hot. this is simple enough for anyone to make but it tastes amazing and looks very impressive. I've been making it since I was 14 and was hostessing my first family function. I'm nearly 19 now and I make it whenever I host an Easter, thanksgiving, or Christmas.

Unfortunately, this recipe didn't work for us as written. I was really looking forward to this recipe too. This never came close to forming a paste. It was a very dry/crumbly mixture. We tried adding more water and lemon juice, but gave up as it seemed way grainy. I didn't want to keep adding more water and lemon--especially lemon as I didn't want to risk too much of a lemon flavor for the ham. I may try to play with this again if I catch a good deal on another ham. Went with a different recipe, in part, just to have a little glaze.

I used the ingredients as written and added a little onion soup mix to taste. I smoked my ham with hickory for 2 1/2 hours at 180 degrees than add fruit and back on smoker for 30mins. The ham turned out amazing! The fruit  was not so good, so next time I will remove the ham from the smoker, add fruit and bake in the oven 30mins.

Excellent result. I didn't need to cook it as long-about an hour at first then another hour with the glaze. Easy and tasty.

I would TOTALLY make this again! The ham was a little crisp on the outside, so in the future I am going to reduce the temp to 325 for the first 2 hours THEN raise it to 375 for the glazing and basting time. Also was unclear as to if it were dark or light brown sugar. I used dark and I think it hid the mustard flavor, I'll be using light brown sugar in the future. The ham was SO juicy and moist though!

I made a mistake and used a ham that was cut already.  I put it in a cooking bag and  cooked it for 2 hours and it had started to burn around the edges. The spirals did not hold together so it was messy and hard to get the pineapple and sauce on top.  It did make great pea soup the next day! I would use a whole unsliced ham the next time.

My 7 yr old was sure she wouldn't like it. She ate a few bites and then had 2 big helpings. She said she "loves it". We used a pre-cooked ham and sliced it in big sections. Poured everything over the slices in a 9x13 and baked for 30 minutes. Fast and easy.

My family loved this recipe!! We will be making this again.  The ham was juicy and had tons of flavor.   We followed the recipe almost exactly as written.  The only changes we made to the recipe was to lightly sprinkle the ham with ground cloves, prior to baking.  We also added some of the pineapple juice from the can of sliced pineapples, to make the paste.   This was a great recipe!!

Delicious! I added cloves in the ham. Mixed four more tbsp of flour to water in a jar...mixed with lid on then stirred it into the boiling sauce after removing ham. Stir until thickened. Makes a light creamy gravy. Soooo good!!!

Made this for Easter dinner. Rave reviews. I added a little extra dry mustard and lemon juice though. Would definitely make this again.

WHOA....THAT WAS GOOD. I didn't have lemon juice or the pineapple/cherries and much to my relief it was still awesome. I added water instead and then some spicy mustard in a squeeze bottle to help make the sugar, etc. wet. It was fantastic. Glad I chose this recipe. Thanks for sharing!

This was so good, I only had pineapple slices and no cherries.  I will make sure I have them next time just for presentation.  I didn't have much juice left to baste the ham with so I used the pineapple juice.  Thanks for sharing
