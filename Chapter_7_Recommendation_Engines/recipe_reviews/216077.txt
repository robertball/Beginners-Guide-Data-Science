Delicious! This is definitely enough spread for a large loaf of Italian bread.  I just eyeballed the amounts of spices and added a little extra garlic and oregano, a splash of olive oil to make it spread nicer and left out the Parmesan cheese (personal preference). I baked mine at a slightly higher oven temperature (400) and then proceeded to get it nice and crispy under the broiler.

This was great! My husband loves the store-made garlic spread that you can buy in most grocery store bakery departments. This was absolutely the one. He was beyond thrilled. I did use day-old baguettes that I bought off the discount bread shelf as I'm tight on money for a while. I swear, this could make shoe leather taste good. ;)

This is exactly how I used to make the garlic bread at a grocery store I used to work at. The only difference is the only dry herb we used was parsley, we didn't add the italian herbs, so it had a more mild taste and went with more meals. In the end we would sprinkle on some "paprika" for a little bit of red color and then wrap each half for sale. It makes garlic bread similar to the ones you get at the grocery store deli, and I even think it tastes a little like the frozen ones, but the ingredients are more natural and it is cheaper to make.

Great spread, lots of flavor. Much less mess than sprinkling the seasoning over the top. Thanks this was perfect with our spaghetti supper.

My husband is not real fond of bread, but he ate 2 pieces pieces!!!! I did change it up a bit, I used italian seasoning instead of the Fines, marjorum, basil, oregano & parsley. I also used French Bread and sprinkled a small amount of sharp cheddar to the top before baking, it came out great!!!

This was an absolute winner at the recent bbq i had with a group of friends. i followed the recipe almost exactly, though i played around with the herbs since i didn't have everthing on hand. Then since there was no toaster at the bbq, i applied the spread on  slices of baguette, wrapped them individually with aluminium foil, and tossed them on the bbq grill for 5 minutes. they came out toasty and warm and cheesy, and people couldn't stop raving about it. An absolute keeper!

This was good! I added a little salt and cracked pepper and in place of all the other herbs, I used italian seasoning. This really reminded me of a traditional garlic bread and we enjoyed it very much! Thanks for sharing. :)

Very good! I made it to go along with the "Worlds Best Lasagna" recipe. I didn't have Fines Herbes (equal parts Tarragon, Parsley, Chervil, Chives), so mine had to go without the 1/16 tsp of Tarragon and Chervil. It was still great though!  I used unsalted butter, but maybe next time a little salt would be nice (or maybe just use margarine like someone suggested?) I tried both baking it into the bread and spreading it onto warm bread, and yeah, duh, baking it in makes a world of difference. This recipe makes enough to spread onto 1 small loaf of Italian bread. Dang good though.

Very Good! Less expensive & you could probably spread thinly onto 2 whole loafs- makes quite a bit. I used butter (which I would normally prefer)but next time I will use margarine.

The perfect side to any Italian meal! I served it with lasagna and salad. I was surprised it didn't call for salt so I added 1/4 t. I also used garlic powder instead of minced garlic to reduce the garlic breath effect. Finally, I didn't have fines herbs so I skipped it. Still turned out great!

My family loved this recipe.  The only changes I made was leaving out the fine herbs and adding olive oil to the butter to make it more spreadable.  The best garlic bread I've ever had!

Amazing! I made this for a football game and everyone loved it! I substituted Tuscan spices for the ones listed and used a Naan bread in place of the Italian loaf, and it was fantastic. I had so much of the spread left over that I know I'll be happy to use it quite a lot for my next few meals. Definitely worth a try or two or ten thousand!

I halved the recipe to try it and used it on two Italian rolls that needed to be used up. Trimmed tops of the rolls a little to expose more bread. Used a few extra cloves of garlic because I love it and some Italian seasoning in place of the fines herbs. I spread BOTH sides of rolls and put on a foil-lined sheet sprayed with cooking spray. Baked at 375 deg for about 6-7 min, turned over and baked another 5 min or so (didn't need to be broiled). Just realized I forgot the parmesan cheese and parsley, but they were still excellent! Much better than the frozen store-bought I had last week. Thanks for the great recipe, mika! It's a keeper!

Loved the butter mixture. If using unsalted butter, add 1/4 tsp salt. And don't overbroil like I did :(

Fab-U-lous! Didn't have "fines" herbs and added a couple dashes of paprika. This recipe was enough for two loaves of bread, for us. Baked one loaf and spread, then froze the other without baking. Can't wait to make it again.

I don't think I would use this recipe again, as I've had much better. It definitely lacked that "garlicky goodness" that should be in garlic bread.

I had been looking for a great garlic butter spread recipe and this is definitely the one.  I did make some minor adjustments/additions.  I didn't have all the herbs, so instead I substituted 1 tsp. Italian Seasoning, and some times for an added bit of cheese, I sprinkle 1 cup shredded mozzarella over the bread before placing in the oven!  My family and I absolutely love this as a compliment to any Italian dish!

I made this and used some of it on a couple of pieces of baquette for Hubs and me.  The rest is in the fridge waiting for the next time.  I made it as written, but omitted the fines herbs because I didn’t have any, and I did add just a pinch of salt.   Next time I might bump up the garlic a bit.  I was roasting a pork tenderloin, so my oven was already heated to 400 degrees, so I just put my two little pieces in for about 4 minutes, then broiled to get a little more color.  I think I’m going to like having this on hand.  Might be great with fresh herbs as well.

I added some mayo to the softened butter (about 1/4 cup) and then added the seasonings.  I used sliced bread and wrapped it in foil to bake it.  This also freezes well!   Great recipe!

Sauce was absolutely delicious, and it ended up making wonderful lasagna. I did make some minor changes, which included adding 1/4 cup of sugar instead of what the recipe called for; 1 lb of hamburger instead of 3/4 lb; fresh basil instead of dried basil leaves; & Barilla no-boil lasagna noodles (I have always used these when making lasagne since it makes lasagna so much easier & always turns out great). I ended up with 4 layers of delicious lasagna in a 9x13 pan, and about 1-1/2 cups of sauce left over, which we'll probably use for spaghetti or tortellini later this week.

It was fantastic! The whole family liked it.  It just barely covered a large loaf of Italian bread from the store. I used salted butter and didn't have all the spices on hand so I used 1/4 tsp of each of the following; basil, parsley & Italian seasoning.  I will double or triple it next time, wrap the extra in plastic wrap and freeze it to have on hand for next time.

I thought this recipe was for a "nice" traditional garlic bread.  It's nothing spectacular but it's easy, quick and good with spaghetti.  I used a Mexican three cheese blend and added it at the last few minutes cooking. I will make again.

I used some about a tablespoon of minced garlic (from the jar) and I used Italian seasoning, salt, pepper, and parsley as others mentioned.  I also used some olive oil (eye balled it, so I can't give a measurement).  It was delicious!  I will definitely make it again, my husband and I liked it a lot, and we're not really bread eaters.

I had  a loaf of Italian  bread that I would have normally served with butter.. when I started to slice bread I found that it wasn't as fresh as I expected. With my spaghetti and meatball dinner ready to go,  I searched for a quick garlic bread recipe and tried this recipe. 
To save some time, I sliced the bread first and spread the mixture on each individual slice.  The ingredients and spices are a great mixture!

I made this last night w/3 day-old Italian bread to go with our spaghetti & meat sauce. Used all the spices; subbed olive oil for the butter & provolone for mozzarella cheese. Really good! A definite keeper. Thanks for 'enhancing' my garlic bread! Hubby loved it!

This recipe was very simple yet made an immediate impact on all the senses.  It is both quick and delicious, it tastes great on any type of bread.
