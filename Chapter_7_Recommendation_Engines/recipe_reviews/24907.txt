I live in southern New Meixco and right now, the harvest of eggplants, green chile, garlic, basil and onions are pouring in faster than we can keep up. This recipe was a GREAT way to take advantage of the local ingredients. Thank you so much for sharing!

I did make several minor changes: I punctured the eggplants with a toothpick all over, then blackened them on the grill (it was 4th of July!) all over. Plunging them into a bowl of ice water made the black skins slip off easily. I also did this with 2 green chiles and added them in addition to the 2 fresh green chiles the recipe calls for. I doubled the garlic and increased the basil by about 50%. Lastly, I used lime juice instead of lemon, as that is what is local around here.

The end result was a smoky, garlicky spread, remeniscent of baba ganoush (but better!) that we spread on tortillas and filled with other roasted local veggies from the harvest. AMAZING!

I grew up in the Middle East and had never tried this...So much wasted time!  This is delicious, healthy, and relatively easy.  I peeled the outer part of the eggplants, then wrung them out a bit, and tore them apart before adding them to the food processor; that just seemed easier to me.
This is going to be a regular in my house!

I wanted to try something new and this was it.  It was easy to make and very good.  Also, very versatile.  My family and I used it as a dip, but I also used it on sandwiches like I would with hummus.  So, if you are looking for something to do with this, it is good as a spread with melted feta or Indian paneer, and sundried tomatoes.  I plan on making this again, often, and trying it on other things as well.  I quartered the recipe and used half of a serrano chile--the dip ended up being very spicy, so a caution: use less chile than the recipe suggests if you do not want a lot of heat.

Good, very spicy.  I quartered the recipe -- it would make alot as written.  If you're in the mood to try something new, this is a good choice.

Followed several reviews and this was a HIT!  Not too much tahini, it still tastes like an eggplant dip.  Charred eggplants and peeled.  Increased basil (1/4 packed cup for 2 eggplants) and garlic (3 cloves for 2 eggplants.  Didn't seed the peppers.    Sprinkled a little cayenne on top at end for color and zing.

Mine turned out bitter.  I added a touch of cumin and sugar to try to fix it, but to no avail.  I don't know what I can do with it now.  At least it didn't take long to make.

This was a fantastic recipe.  I also halfed the recipe but it was a big hit with homemade pita chips prior to Christmas dinner.  The kids were shocked that egg plant was the primary ingredient.  I also added a few drops of liquid smoke to give it that cooked on the grill taste

I made half of this recipe, and I really wouldn't have wanted any more than that.  My batch was dominated by tahini as I added a little more to make it thicker.  Don't take out the seeds of the pepper, otherwise you won't be able to taste it!

I used a very mild pepper when making this the first time and it was bland. When we add Tabasco Sause it added a kick to it. Now I use hot peppers. This is a great low-fat side dish.

Very good.  I only made a half batch and had plenty for an appetizer tray.

Wonderful way to use eggplant. Very flavorful. My husband doesn't care for it so there was plenty for me. Will probably eat as a dip for sliced cukes and zucchini. Great for a low-fat lunch or snack.

This recipe was very easy to make.  I quartered it, using only one eggplant, and since I did (but my family did NOT) want it to be spicy I eased up on the hot peppers and instead added black pepper, turmeric, and cumin.  I also added sweet red peppers to make up for blandness.  The dip turned out well but until I can make & serve it properly (i.e. with full eye-watering heat) I do not think I will be making it again.
