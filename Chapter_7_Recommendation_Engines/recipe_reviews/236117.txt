Burgers came out great. Good flavor and real juicy. At first i was concerned  the patties would fall though the grates. I put them in the
 freezer  for about 10 minutes  before grilling to firm  them up . I 'll be making these for my. next family cookout.

I also 1/2'd the recipe because I didn't have 2# of burger.  Revisions:  I added about an 1/8th of a cup of Panko bread crumbs and about a Tablespoon of brown sugar instead of Coke.  YUM!  Will definitely save this recipie and use it again.

Very good! I halved the recipe, and could not find smoked cheddar, so I used regular. Very moist and juicy, and you could really taste all of the added flavors. I would make these again! Thanks for sharing. :)

instead of putting a slice of cheese on top, I put 1/8 cup per burger of shredded cheese mixed into the burger

I wasn't sure what to expect from these burgers and frankly, we were shocked at how good they were! I can honestly say they were the best burgers I've ever made. Seriously. I cut the recipe in half for the two of us, and made eight mini burgers. I used Canadian rye whiskey instead of bourbon because that's what I had, that being the only change I made. What Canadian isn't craving a good burger in February? These satisfied the craving, alright!
