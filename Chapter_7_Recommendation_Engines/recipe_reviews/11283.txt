I would really like to give this recipe 5 stars, because these cookies are so yummy.  However, they are extremely temperamental.  I ruined a few dozen cookies trying to figure out the trick to this recipe.  Follow my advice exactly, and you shouldn't have a problem.
1) DO NOT make these cookies without either a silpat or parchment paper.  Greasing the cookie sheet is not enough.  The cookies will still stick like cement.  2) These cookies spread - A LOT.  Place only 9 teaspoon-sized drops on a standard sized sheet.  Any more than that and they will spread together into one big cookie.  3) Bake for only 9 minutes.  They won't look done, but they are.  4) Follow the instructions of leaving the cookies on the pan for 5 minutes before removing to a rack.  Any less time and you will completely mutilate the cookies.  Don't let my comments scare you away from this recipe - the cookies are fabulous!

incredible cookies. to make this recipe properly make sure you follow kjstrom's advice very seriously. they turned out perfect. and thanks to them i didnt have to make any of the mistakes. The only things i will add is 1)dont necissarily bake them for 9 minutes, i took mine out at that point and they were a little tiny bit {but enough to spoil them} raw in the middle, i went with 10 minutes. this will depend on your oven. 2)the recipe calls for toffee bits and then the directions say to add the chocolate covered caramels i didnt know what was accurate. i used the toffee bits. turned out great. i will make them many more times, thank you

I haven't tried this recipe yet, since it doesn't mention chocolate covered caramels until it says to stir them in at the end of this recipe.  Should the toffee bits be chocolate covered caramels?  Otherwise it seems to be very good.
