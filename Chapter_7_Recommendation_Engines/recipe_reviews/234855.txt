I made this with just a few changes, adding refried black beans, fresh salsa and a can of corn. I boiled 2 small chicken breasts, then cut up and added to the skillet. I added 1 tbsp minced garlic, 1 tsp Cumin and 1 tsp. Chili Powder for flavor. It was very quick and easy to throw together in a hurry, but satisfying.  This would be good as a topping for brown rice. Tortilla chips on the top made for a nice crunch.

My boyfriend's top favourite food is chili, but I really don't enjoy it much. We compromised on making a chicken chili instead, and he very much enjoyed this recipe. It's not thick like a chili though, we just used it as a dip for chips. Otherwise very good. ?

For the time and simplicity in making this chili, it is quite respectable.   How well you like this chili will be determined by the quality of the salsa you use.

Yummy! Added a can of diced tomatoes that were flavoured with garlic and olive oil as well as a can of Bush's chili beans. Doubled the chicken and added over 2 cups of homemade salsa.

We loved the chili, but I found it needed about twice as much salsa and 8 oz. Of tomato sauce. Otherwise it was too dry. We like rotisserie chicken and that made it good.

I followed the recipe exactly as written. It was quick and easy and tasty. When I make it again I will probably tweek the spices to my own tastes.

We thought this was fantastic!  I did double the chicken and salsa and added 8oz of tomato sauce and 1 can of Brooke's chili beans in addition to the black beans. Delicious!  This will be great for a dish to pass served in a crock pot.   Thank you for a great recipe.

We really enjoyed this - we made it with a 16 oz. jar of salsa verde and 3/4 cup of water.
