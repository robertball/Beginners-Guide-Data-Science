I'm giving these 3 stars because 2T of olive oil isn't going to fry your zucchini, especially when sliced half of an inch thick!  I started with a little more than that and it still wasn't enough.  I ended up using enough oil to half submerge the slices, and also ended up making the slices only half as thick.  I don't keep buttery crackers in the pantry so I melted a generous amount of butter and mixed it with plain bread crumbs.  If you do use the crackers though, I recommend giving them a good spin through the food processor to get the crumbs nice and small.  My final outcome was quite tasty; served with warm marinara.

So fast & easy to make. The crackers help give it a buttery taste. Will definitely make again! We substituted seasoning salt for the salt & pepper. Yum!

I don't like zucchini but I was given a ginormous one and my husband says he likes it fried so here I came for a recipe!  This was very good! I did mix up a bowl with a little flour mixed with salt, pepper,  garlic powder and dipped the pieces in the flour, then egg, then the crackers. I sliced it thin and definitely used more oil (I put about 1/2 in in pan I think). My kids gobbled them up and my husband said they were just like he remembered!

Breading does not stick, had to use a lot more than 2 tbs. of oil, they burned before the zuccini got soft.

I loved this recipe!!! I changed the serving size from 4 to 2 and the ingredients were calculated correctly and the fried zucchini turned out great!!! I actually liked it better with the cracker crumbs than using bread crumbs! I will definitely make this again!!!

Instead of coating with egg, I coated them with olive oil and used shake and bake. Easier and faster to coat with the breadcrumbs in the bag provided, definitely worked just as well! I also coated the frying pan with a thin layer of veggie oil (probably a 1/4 cup or so) and they fried up fine.

really good... i used more seasoning because i like strong flavors... also just keep the bottle of oil by you because you need to keep adding more... 1/2 inch is way too thick and takes a very long time to cook... i should've looked at the reviews first lol.... but a very good dish. bravo!

We made these tonight. 1/2 inch is too thick, so we cut that in half. We had to use way more than 2T of oil for frying. Otherwise, not too bad a recipe. Will make again, but switch it up.

It worked pretty well. Make sure the crackers are crushed fine so they stick better and it does need way more than 2 Tbs oil.

I added parmesan cheese to the crumbs and avocado oil for frying.  A little more oil than what the recipe called for was needed for a crisp coating.  My husband is a  very fussy eater, he liked them which means they will be on the menu again!

I thought it actually turned out really well, I did use 4 tablespoons of olive oil but could not find reason to add more did not want to cover it in it, I enjoyed the butter flavor the Ritz added to it without having to add butter, and found that you could serve it as is or with a dipping of your choice either is fine.  I did end up cooking them four minutes to a side and they were great.

Now my changes were not willingly.  I was out of parmesan cheese which I would have liked the nutty tastes that comes with powder parmesan when it's fried or roasted on foods.  This recipe must have been "the bomb" anyway; because even with a missing ingredient; it was "nitro".  A great "tailgater" appetizer and it makes a wonderful addition to a lasagna dinner.  Five thumbs up for this one.

I had a fairly slow oven going and lots of zucchini, so a slight variation:

cute zucchini on the diagonal into thick slices (1/4"), heaped with parmesan and breadcrumbs, roasted for about 15 minutes.  Cooked but still crunchy and DELICIOUS!  Thank you!

Only 4 stars because an essential step for breading veggies(AND boneless skinless chicken and pork or beef) is dredging in FLOUR FIRST!  This is what helps the egg stick and makes the crumb coating work.  Without the flour, you'll be chasing the final coating all over the bubbling oil.

I used more oil but I also used a large skillet. Used Townhouse crackers. Dredged in flour first. Just like I wanted! I would totally make this again. Didn't need S&P. Plenty of flavor as is.

Fried zucchini is better when you slice it thin lengthwise.  All the flavor in fried zucchini comes from the coating so the thinner you slice it, the more flavorful it is.  I dredge it in flour first and then in an egg wash and then fry it

My family loved this recipe! I used cornmeal instead of crackers because that's what I had at home. I also used seasoned salt and pepper. This was a delicious use of our garden produce.

I made two batches. The first I followed the recipe exactly and it came out pretty well. The second time, I Sprinkled shredded mozzarella on the zucchini once it was in the pan. I thought this added a little extra flavor and I personally liked that better.

Tastes ok. The ritz crackers did not sick to the zucchini well and turned into mush and became unusable halfway through from mixing with the egg. I used canola oil since I saw in the reviews the olive oil was not hot enough but it seems that 3 min each side is a little long. I will try a different recipe next time.

I cut the zucchini into 1/4 inch medallions and pan fried in 3 tbsp organic unflavored coconut oil  and 1 tbsp butter. The whole family loved it and there were no left overs. I am definitely going to pass the recipe on to other family members. Super easy and very tasty!

I sliced the zucchini rather thin, dipped in beaten egg, then low-carb biscuit mix, seasoned with salt & pepper. Fried in pan with olive oil, didn’t measure, made sure it was hot enough to add zucchini. Made sure to move them around so they wouldn’t stick, turned when browned, both sides, not too dark. Delicious!
