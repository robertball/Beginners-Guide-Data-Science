Excellent recipe.  I hesitated to purchase the huge jar of tahini at $5+, but now have confidence that it will get used up just from this recipe alone.  I only added about 3 tablespoons fresh lemon juice, and it's perfect.  By the way, garbanzo beans and chickpeas are the same thing.

This is awesome!! It gets better after sitting in the fridge.  I attempted hummus one other time with a yucky mess...this is THE recipe for great hummus. It's basic, quick, and very flavorful. While my kids (2yrs & 5yrs) thought it was too garlicky, I thought it was exactly right (it also mellows a little after a day or two)Also, I don't buy tahini (since I can never find small amounts) I just toasted sesame seeds until fragrant (not browned) and whipped them into a paste with 1 tsp. oil and used that for my recipe. This will be a staple in our house.

This was wonderful! Made a few small changes though: only added 1 clove of garlic, reduced lemon juice to 2 tablespoons, subbed in 2 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil for the tahini (I had none), and used chickpeas in place of the garbonzo beans. After that there was no reason to season with salt and pepper because it was perfect. Great recipe!

I was unsure about red peppers in hummus, normally a favorite sammie filling for me, but I gathered up my courage and dumped them in anyway and am I glad!  My children ate this up, my eight yo said she likes it better than our usual recipe and my toddler decided to forego the pita bread altogether and just eat the hummus with a spoon!  I put it in sammies with kalamata olives, chopped fresh red pepper, chopped cucumber, feta cheese with lemon juice, olive oil and balsamic vinegar sprinkled on top. One problem with the instructions:  the intro says bring to room temp before serving but the directions say to chill until ready to serve.  Maybe you are supposed to keep your house very cold?  :)

This is a nice recipe although I would cut down on the amount of tahini; I found that it had a little bitter after taste that wasn't exactly what I was aiming for.  It was well received by the adults at the party but virtually every kid turned their nose up (as kids are apt to do!).

I usually prefer my hummus to be more grainy, and I'd never had it with roasted red peppers before, but I was in the mood for something different.  Well, I'm glad that this was the recipe I picked!  It was very good with home-baked pita chips.  I only had Realemon juice on hand, so I cut down on the listed amount and it was fine.  For sure something I would make for a party.

I modified this.  I did not use basil.  I added 1/2 Tsp. of ground cumin and 1/4 tsp. cayanne pepper and 1/4 tsp. salt.  I only used 2 T lemon juice, and 1 T tahini, and 1 T olive oil....

We love hummus, and the roasted red peppers make it even better.  1/3 cup tahini is perfect for us, because we like more than just a couple tablespoons of that.  But 1/3 cup lemon juice would have ruined it for us--I used the juice of 1/4 fresh lemon...about a tablespoon and a half, and that was plenty for us.  I love the tip I read on this site to put the chickpeas in a bowl of water to remove the outer skins.  It worked like a charm and made the hummus wonderfully creamy.  We'll make again and again--oh, and we left out the basil...we didn't need it.

I am sure this could be better with a bit more spice as I found it a little bland.  **TIP** peel the skins off your garbanzos for a better texture, it really should state that in the recipe. I added more basil than called for but it could use some more zing.  Overall, easy to make (just wish I had a food processor, all I have is a stick blender and it was a bit of a pain) and a perfect afternoon treat with homemade tortilla chips!

I didn't have  tahini  so I toasted some sesame seeds and crushed between two spoons. I also added a little olive oil to make it smoother as my sister had said she didn't like the texture. I had her try it and she ate most of it! Guess we fixed the 'texture' issue!

I know hummus is traditionally made with tahini butter but it honestly tastes just as good if you substitute it with extra virgin olive oil. I use this recipe time and time again! It goes perfect with pita chips, crackers, or as a dip for raw vegetables.

We use 3 tbsp. of tahini, 3 tbsp. of lemon juice and 3 tbsp. of EVOO. This stuff rocks and is way better than store bought. We use celery, sliced peppers, carrots and pita chips for dipping.

I have been eating this a lot lately- a great (simple) recipe.  It doesn't make much difference if you use the lemon juice or basil -I skip them both, and use chickpeas instead of garbanzo beans.  I also like this recipe with an entire head of oven-roasted garlic and a few drops of the oil it was roasted in!

I've made this twice, once without tahini and then I finally went and bought the tahini and it was so much better!  I also cooked the beans and added a t. olive oil and I think it made for a smoother consistency.  It's really good!

I used the foundation of this recipe (garlic, beans, tahini, lemon) and omitted the red pepper in place of 1 can of artichoke hearts and 8-10 ounces cooked/drained frozen spinach to make spinach-artichoke hummus. It was a huge hit! I also used minced garlic and garlic powder instead and added salt.

Delicious! Next time around I will cut down a little on the lemon juice, it came through a little too strong for my taste. Overall this is a wonderful, easy hummus recipe and all of my roommates loved it!

Fantastic! I just finished making this and tasted it. Roasted my own red pepper (used 1 whole one) and followed the recipe pretty closely except I added a dash of salt and used half the lemon. This couldn't be an easier recipe and it is SOOOO much better than store bought! For those who said it was missing something, it's probably all those chemicals in the store bought we are all used to eating. :) Will make this again and again, also trying other flavors. It was great even before I added the red pepper. Thanks Marbalet! Highly recommended.

That was easy!  This is very good, just threw everything in the food processor and it was ready in a minute, but I will let it chill overnight.  I did not add any salt or pepper, it tasted good already on a wheat thin.  Thanks :)

I was a bit disappointed in this recipe.  In my opinion, the flavors aren't as balanced as I would prefer: the tahini and lemon juice slightly overpowered the chickpeas and red pepper.  Next time, I plan on using AllRecipes' user ROYHOBBS' "Real Hummus" recipe, with a roasted red pepper thrown in for flavor.

Very tasty and so easy to make.  I reserved some of the liquid from the drained beans and added it to make a more creamy texture.  Using fresh squeezed lemon juice makes a huge difference.

It's a good base recipe like the kind you get at grocery store delis.  It needed herbs and spice.  Thank you though

After reading the other reviews, I tweaked the recipe a bit. I started with 2 cups dried beans which I cooked and drained. I used 3 large cloves of garlic and 2 tbsp. of lemon juice. I used 2 red peppers which I roasted and peeled. I added 1 tsp. of salt and 3 tbsp. of olive oil and omitted the dried basil and tahini (I don't even know what tahini is). The humus turned out very good. I will be making all my own humus from now on.

This is really good but definitely needed an extra punch to it for me & my husband. We like spicy. First time I made it I added red pepper flakes, cayenne, 3 cloves of garlic and a dash of hot sauce. YUM..second time I added a fresh diced jalapeno, double YUM! it's a very good base recipe to add what you want to it. Next time I will try adding a bit of cumin and maybe cilantro?

This came out quite well. I used dried beans that I had previously cooked and frozen, so I found it necessary to add salt. I added black pepper just for kicks :-) Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe is perfect just the way it is. It leaves a slight garlic taste in your mouth after the matter, but who doesn't like garlic. I doubled the recipe and followed it to a T - I thought it was great....tasted like the stuff you get at Sam's club. But since it was just me and my boyfriend, I ended up adding crushed red pepper since I like everything with a little BANG. Either way, the recipe is delicious without any additions and would be great for a party. By the way, this was my first time making hummus (just got a new food processor) and I will NEVER buy it from the store again...what I made for about 5 bucks worth of ingredients would have cost me over 20 at the store!! Thanks again for the wonderful recipe.

Followed the recipe exactly and it's not bad. Extremely easy and tasty. We used fresh pepper and lemon juice and I didn't find the lemon taste overpowering at all. I think next time I'll use a tad less tahini, roast the garlic, and toss in some cumin. It's definitely a keeper, and I think with a few minor modifications it would be restaurant quality.

Very good hummus recipe!  I did as others suggested which was to put the beans in water and take their skins off (easy to do they just pop right off - just takes a couple of minutes).  One thing people should be aware of is that once the skins are off there is only about 2/3 - 3/4 can of beans left so adjust ingredients accordingly.  We were out of lemons so we Googled substitutes and substituted white wine vinegar 1/2 per tsp. of lemon juice called for.  Worked out fine.  I can't wait to try it with the lemon though!  One thing we found is that right after youmake it and it is at room temp., the hummus is creamy once it is refridgerated though it becomes at little dry.  Just added a little olive oil as other's mentioned and it became nice and creamy again.  Thanks for the recipe!  It's a keeper!

Great recipe! It's the perfect combination of flavors to make a smooth hummus. However, I didn't use as much lemon juice and I left out the dried basil.

This recipe is great!  It is good with the roasted red pepper and also a great base recipe to make other kinds of hummus.  I have already used this base to make chipotle and garlic hummus.

Really good!  Doubled it just to use up a full jar of roasted red peppers.  So glad I did!  I did reduce the lemon juice as some suggested and I sauteed the minced garlic in a little olive oil to mellow it.

WAY too lemon-y.  Maybe this was compounded by my use of store bought lemon juice but it was really overwhelming.  I'm sure with the right proportions this would be a good recipe since it only really uses standard hummus ingredients, but you may want to add as you go along to ensure that you don't over do it.

This came out DELICIOUS!! I ate this stuff right from a spoon, and had to stop myself from eating too much! :) it was so easy to prepare, just threw everything into the food processor and refrigerated it for a few hours. i only used 2 TBSP of tahini, and used lime juice instead (that's all i had).

This was a good base. Four stars because it was fabulous with a few changes. 

used 1/4c tahini
1/4c lemon juice
1 whole head of roasted garlic instead of the raw cloves
1 roasted red pepper
1 roasted pablano pepper (because we like a little heat)
and then drizzled olive oil thru the chute until the consistency was as we liked it.  It was very dry without the oil probably because I cut down on the tahini and lemon juice.  I did "peel" the chickpeas.

I did use salt and pepper for some added interest.   when my 14 yo boy tasted it he asked "is that all you made?"  LOL!  

Anyway start with this recipe, it is solid and then adjust as you wish.

I usually make hummus on the fly without a recipe and it turns out differently every time, so I thought I would search for a good recipe.  This one got so many great reviews and I was excited to try it.  Not sure what happened with mine, but I did not like this at all.  WAY too much lemon juice (and I even put in less than the 1/3 of a cup).......tasted like raw garlic....and needed salt! I didn't eat the first batch. Tried it again with sauteed garlic, the juice from 1 lemon (about 2 Tblsp), and a pinch of salt.  So much better.  But I can't give a recipe more than 1 or 2 stars if I had to make major changes to it.

I did reduced the amount of Tahini like the other viewer recommended, and I added hand full of left over dry roasted pine nuts I had in the fridge. The color is absolutely beautiful and taste is stunning! With all these beans, nuts and seeds with garlic and lemon? I feel healthier already!!!

We eat this almost daily at the office. To keep calories at bay, omit the tahini altogether. We substitute lime juice for the lemon and find the basil isn't necessary at all. Thanks for the great starting point!

Better with less lemon juice. Also, process peppers separate and strain, then stir in. Better consistency

I LOVE hummus but I found this variation kind of boring.  Maybe it would be better with fresh basil?  Thanks for the opportunity to give it a try though.

I make recipes from this website all the time, but never write reviews.  This recipe, however, is so good that I couldn't NOT write one!  This is now the only hummus recipe I use.  My husband and I both love it!  The only tiny change I made was adding a little of the liquid from the garbanzo beans simply because I like my hummus a little bit smoother.  Otherwise, this is perfect!

Seriously great.  I added cumin and paprika instead of basil (sorry marbalet) - I tend to like the more traditional spices in hummus.  Maybe next time I will try the basil.  :)

Good recipe, although next time I will use only half of the lemon juice. The lemon taste overpowered everything.  I added a teaspoon of cayenne pepper because we like it a bit spicier.

Hummus is one of those things you can change and play with and it becomes your own.  I like this version except I had to play with it.  Do not use basil, use paprika and cumin which is traditional to hummus.  I love love the red peppers.  Thanks for sharing.

This has waaaaay too much lemon in it. I actually reduced it to 1/4 of a cup and the lemon was still over powering. It was also gritty, so I added olive oil until it was smooth.

Excellent recipe.  I used white beans instead of garbanzos because it was what I had on hand and it tasted wonderful, although I added more spices to taste (Penzey's Turkish Seasoning) and less lemon juice (2 Tbsp).  Even in the blender it was smooth and had a lovely sweet and garlicky taste.

This was WAAAY too much tahini for me, and I think I'll also reduce the lemon juice. I used (and liked) 1 T. of tahini. I tried 1/4 c. lemon juice, but I think that's still too much. Also needed to add 1/2 t. salt after rinsing the beans. Might try roasting the garlic next time. This recipe gave me a base to start working from, but I will definitely continue to tweak.

Oh yum! This is so much better (and cheaper) than store bought hummus. I only used 1 clove of garlic (which was plenty, and I'm a garlic lover) and omitted the basil. Didn't bother to measure out the lemon juice, I just squeezed in half a large lemon. I also didn't have tahini, so I threw in a couple tablespoons of olive oil instead to make it creamy. Worked out great. Oh and its so easy to roast your own peppers instead of buying them jarred. Just cut them in half and broil for about 8 min, set in a paper bag for 25 min, then peel off the skin. Delish. I used one pepper for this recipe. Thanks!

It's good but it needs something.  I added olive oil like someone suggested and cumin but it's still lacking flavor.  I didn't add the basil.  I also added salt.  I don't think I would add the olive oil next time.  The olive oil overpowers the delicate taste of the hummus.

I had to modify this a bit and it turned out very well.  I felt the lemon flavor was over powering so I added more beans and peppers.  I didn't have tahini but didn't miss it so I wont bother to get it for next time I make this.  My only suggestion would be to cut down on the lemon and it will be fantastic.

If I am roasting the peppers in the oven(as opposed to store bought), I add the garlic as well so it gets a sweeter flavor. Also, I use fresh parsley in place of the basil. I add the tahini slowly and taste at intervals as sometimes I feel it overpowers the dip.

This was so good.  I didn't have the tahini, however, I was going to the Asian store and got a huge bag of sesame seeds which I use all the time.  I roasted 1/2 cup of them in a dry stainless steel skillet and put them in the food processor by themselves for a minute or two before I added the other ingredients.  The consistency was a little coarser, but it had a fresher taste and was a little more cost effective.

This is great. It reminds me of the hummus we use to buy at the Farmer's Market in CA. I substituted peanut butter for tahini. and 4 cloves of garlic. The above reviewer is correct you must blend this for a very long time. The flavors keep getting stronger as it sets. My advice would be to make it a day ahead.

Ilove hummus but was disappointed with this recipe.  I followed the directions and used fresh, good quality ingredients.  In my own opinion, this was way too lemon-y.  It was a nice texture but mostly all I could taste was lemon. Probably would not make this again but thank you for sharing this recipe.

This was awsome, awsome.  I did make a few changes, but same basic concept.  I used chipotle peppers in adobo instead of roasted red pepper, and olive oil instead of tahini.  I think next time I'll cut back a little on the lemon juice, and also I added cumin...how can you have hummus without cumin??

Surprised as it has no olive oil. I think it lacks some bite to it even with the cayenne. I added a wee bit more tahini and i think I will also add some more lemon juice next time. I roasted a red bell pepper with some olive oil and then peeled and minced it. Instead of putting all of it in the food processor, I just mixed it along with the hummus. Spread a spoonful of olive oil on top. Then added a few peeled crumbled chickpeas, minced red bell pepper and finally some cilantro. Great presentation, hubby and son liked it but wasn't the best for me.  My regular hummus recipes are better.

I'd never have thought you could have something better than classic hummus. But this was so good I don't know if O'm going to make regular hummus ever again! As suggested in several other reviews, I used less lemon juice than requested in the recipe.

This was great!  My first time making hummus, and it was so easy.  I roasted the red pepper under the broiler for about 15 minutes.  I was short lemon juice, so if I added more of that I'm sure it would have been better.  Next I think I'm going to try making black olive hummus...

This was very tasty and exceptionally easy to make! I could not fing tahini in a small container so I made my own with roasted sesame seeds blended with olive oil in the food processer. Although this was tasty, you neeed to be careful to not over cook the seeds or else you will have a burnt taste. I also recommend a little less lemon juice. I thought it was too much.

I have used this recipe several times. I find it makes a wonderful spread on wholemeal bread with some salad leaves, shredded carrot and cucumber, and as a dip for just about everything! I have tried it a few times with dried chick peas instead of tinned, and I found the flavour to be much less like that of something coming out of a tin, but with all of the additions, tinned chick peas are perfect too! I love it and the guests I have prepared it for have loved it too! Delish!

This recipe was a good foundation for hummus; however, I recommend adding only 1-2 teaspoons of lemon juice instead of a third of a cup. Otherwise, the lemon taste is very overpowering and sour. 

Also, you might add some cumin for more flavor.

The raw garlic was too overwhelming. Next time I will try garlic salt. I added some EVO too change the consistency as I found it too grainy. I added a bit more roasted peppers and 1/2 teaspoon each of cumin and cayenne.

I really liked the recipe, but will definitely cut the lemon juice down a lot next time.  It has a lemony aftertaste that I could do without.  I doubled the recipe and peeled the garbanzo beans [same as chick peas]. I added more basil and more red peppers.

I couldn't find tahini at my store and maybe it would have had a 5 star review with it, but as it is, I had to sub the tahini with 1 TBSP peanut butter and 1/4 c. sesame oil; I reduced the lemon juice as per other reviews and the end product was good.  I come short of saying "Great" but if I could find the tahini it might be that.  Thank for for the recipe.

I was not a big fan of this. I did not use the freshest ingredients, (canned roasted red peppers and bottled lemon juice)but I still thought the lemon juice was too strong, the texture grainy and the garlic flavor disappeared.. I would tweak the recipe next time with less lemon juice, and fresh roasted red peppers to help with the texture..

I've made this recipe for a cocktail party and the guests raved about it. The only change I made was I used fresh basil since I have an abundance in the garden. I never knew hummus was so easy to make! I never have to buy it in the store again!

This is a good recipe.  I think the amount of lemon is good - not too much, not too little.  I like garlic, so I added a bit more.  I roasted my pepper on the grill, so there wasn't any added liquid from the pepper that you would get from peppers from a jar.  It seemed a bit thick, so I just added a little water to get the right consistency.  Good flavor!

This is a wonderful recipe but rather than using tahini, I grated 1 cup Havarti cheese and added 1/4 teas cayenne pepper..I'm sure most fans would love the original recipe, but I like things somewhat spicy!

Cooking my own garbanzo beans definitely punched up the flavor.  I just soak dried beans for 8 hours )or up to 24 hours), and cook them with lots of herbs - basil, bay leaf, garlic - to make things a bit more interesting.  Having fresh lemon juice makes a big difference as well.

This is the first time I have tried Red Pepper Hummus and did not like it. It was very bitter. I have only had Hummus two other times and I am not sure what really makes a good hummus or what it is supposed to taste like for that matter. I see lots of great reviews for this recipe by lots of people. I am going to assume that I did something wrong when making this, or I just am not a fan of Hummus. I give this recipe 5 stars simply because I have no experience with making hummus, and because any recipe is worth trying, I appreciate the chance to try it!

I'm very pleased with this recipe. Simple to make. I used grapeseed oil to roast my peppers, because it has a high flash point. I was worried about the Tahini sauce which I opened a few months back and hadn't used since - but it was still good. The roasted pepper, lemon, tahini all combine for a very nice flavor. I will make it again.

i didn't have any tahini in the house, though i quite like someone's idea of making their own.  will try this.  roasted my cloves of garlic first, used fresh basil...  delicious even without the tahini!

A very smooth but light hummus.  The roasted peppers were subtle.  Very satisfying.  About to make a second batch!

This is excellent.  I added slightly less lemon juice because I only had the bottled stuff- other than that, I followed exactly.  I'll make this again for sure- my whole family enjoyed it.  Thanks for the recipe, Marbalet- it's a nice twist on an old favorite!

This had way too much tahini in it for me, and I like tahini. It's a bit bland, and needed salt.

I doubled this, and served to guests who really enjoyed it. We all agreed that it needed less pepper, but tasted great regardless. I used Jarred roasted red peppers that were in garlic oil, so I drained as much oil as I could. The only change I made was cutting the lemon juice in half. Definitely a keeper!

Really good recipe for a twist on hummus. I would decrease the amount of tahini and use chopped fresh basil. Whole different experience fresh basil in this is. I also added sun dried tomatoes for a bit of tangy sweetness, but that's just a personal preference.

I can say that my store bought roasted red pepper hummus is better. I peeled the chickpeas, I used a little olive oil instead of tahini, 1/4 cup of lemon juice, and 2 cloves of garlic. I think I put too much garlic in, I may try this recipe again without the garlic. And, I added cumin. I agree that hummus needs that. Oh, and basil seemed out of place so I didn't add it. So, thanks for giving me something new to try!

Very yummy, very quick and easy in my food processor! Thanks for a great recipe. It was a hit at my party. It goes great with Wheat Thins and wheat flavored Toasteds crackers. Print extra copies of your recipe, if you're serving this to guests... they will ask for it!

This was absolutely delicious, and just a one-bowl dish.  Because I couldn't find the tahini, I substituted peanut butter.  I also added a touch of sesame oil to enhance the flavor.  Would definitely make this again.

I thought this was somewhat flavorless.  I cut the lemon back to 1/4 cup and kept everything else the same.  I followed the advice others and removed the skin on the chickpeas (this does make for very smooth hummus). I am not sure what happened, but it does not "pop" like some of the other hummus recipes on here (Lemon garlic and Jalapeno).  Maybe it was the jar of red peppers we used.

Maybe I've become a hummus snob lately, but I really feel like this was too lemony for "red pepper" hummus. Next time I make it I will use less lemon juice. It's not a bad flavor just a hint to bitter w/the juice.

My husband and I love this recipe.  I take this whenever I am asked to bring along a snack.  I rarely alter the ratios but will use fresh lemon juice when possible.

Really good!  I used garlic powder instead of actual garlic and reduced the lemon juice and tahini to 2 tablespoons each.  I thought I had a jar of red peppers on hand, but when I found I didn't, I used sundried tomatoes instead!  It turned out a little dry, so I added a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil and some liquid from the jar of sundried tomatoes.  Delicious!  I think it will taste even better after some time in the fridge.  Thanks!

this was my first Hummus recipe to try, and it turned out very good.  I used it to dip veggies in.  After realizing how easy it is to make, I will never buy store-bought again!

I am giving this 4 stars because it was a bit dry, to begin with, and I added just a drizzle of oil to smooth it out. The flavor is great and I added just enough salt. The thing about this stuff is it really needs to sit and let the flavors blend for a while to come together.

Very good. If you find the end result a bit thick just add some water while the processor is running until you get your desired consistency. You could also add a couple of roasted jalepeño peppers to the mix for some spice if you like that sort of thing.

I had to leave out the garlic due to an allergy and thin k it came out a bit too thick because all I had was crystallized lemon instead of lemon juice.  But beside that my kids loved it!  I even roasted my own red peppers.

We made a few changes, but stuck to the core recipe.

5 cloves garlic (this is a garlic-loving house!)
Fresh basil (~6 leaves), since we had some on hand
3/4 c. roasted red pepper
1/4 c. lemon juice
1/8 c. water (wanted the zing of the lemon juice, but not as much; used water to reach the right consistency)

Roasted Red pepper hummus. This is a very easy recipe. The hardest part was peeling the roasted bell peppers. The recipe did not include a portion of plain yogurt or plain sour cream or anything like that to make it even more creamy. It needs the sour cream or the yogurt to bring a little tang and extra creaminess to the hummus. Suggest adding equal parts yogurt to tahini to the blender while making at start. Add more to taste.  Also added a quarter cup of extra virgin olive oil. For that reason, you give a four star.

I followed the changes that another reviewer made - using 2 tablespooons of minced garlic and substituting a few tablespoons of olive oil instead of tahini. It definitely turned out yummy!

As written this was incredibly bland and not appetizing.  I ended up adding more lemon juice and roasted red pepper and then adding a bunch of seasonings from other recipes online to fix it.  I added half of a jalapeño, garlic, toasted onion powder, roasted garlic powder, chipotle powder, smoked paprika, black pepper, salt, cayenne, cumin, and some olive oil.  I wasn't measuring, just sprinkling in small amounts of the seasonings until there was more flavor and kick.  I took this to an event and people raved over it and kept asking for the recipe! (Fun tip: it sounds bizarre, but if you find yourself with overly runny hummus- say your tahini is too thin or you've added extra lemon juice- a little bit of potato flakes added to the mixture doesn't change the flavor and allows you to thicken it to your desired texture.)

Made this last night.  Super easy!  My husband is gobbling it up with baby carrots.  I like the flavor okay, although the lemon is a bit too strong for my taste, and the hummus a tad too moist.  I think next time I will only do a 1/4 cup lemon juice. But otherwise, really great!

I had to add 2 tbsp of olive oil  because my tahini separated, added a pinch of ground cumin and no salt. I also cut down on lemon.This hummus recipe is better than store bought plus it is quick and easy to make. Loved it.

This was much better after I added a couple more seasonings. It certainly was easy to make!

So good!  Changes I made were using cooked dry organic chick peas (added enough water so it would move in my blender) and a half of a hot pepper - just because!  I will make this a lot!

Easy to make.....Didn't have roasted peppers, but had some pickled red peppers...It was hotter than it probably would have been with roasted peppers...but all and all it is delicious...

When you make it for the first time I would have preferred to have the salt amount....I put in a 1/2 tsp and about 1/8 tsp of pepper....that worked but will adjust for the next time.

A nice basic recipe but too bland for me. I think it needs spice. I will say that it needs to set in the refrigerator a day for the flavors to develop but still it was bland. I would add some chili pepper or cayenne or something, not sure.

This was wonderful, and it made more than I could eat at one sitting. I made 2 mistakes, though. (1) I included 1/2 of the liquid from my canned beans, which made it kind of watery (so don't do that, lol); and (2) I didn't include enough roasted red peppers; next time, I'll definitely add more. I gave the recipe a "5" because any flaws in it were of my own making and not the fault of the  recipe. I ate it for lunch with pita chips but tonight I'm going to use it as the "topper" for my baked potato. Yum!

This was pretty good. I made it in my Blendtec blender. We ate it right away. It needed salt and maybe some olive oil. It was a little garlicky for my taste and doesn't necessarily need the basil.   There is a little bit left over. I will see how it tastes tomorrow.

This was the worst hummus recipe I've ever made, it was way too runny and it ended up in the trash.  Kind of pissed that I didn't just add red peppers to my normal recipe....won't ever make this again!!!

This is probably the best hummus recipe I have made yet.  I live in small town, so roasted red peppers were not available, so I simply chopped up regular red peppers and added those.  Turned out very tasty.

This recipe makes the best hummus I've ever eaten. I no longer buy hummus unless I do not have ingredients which is when I'm on a trip away from home for days. I've used this recipe minus the red peppers (which I roast at home, so easy) but I also use home roasted garlic when I have the time.

This was a very good recipe. I didn't have garbanzo beans so I just used chickpeas.  I roasted the garlic as well which gave it an even better flavour.  I entered my hummus at our local country fair and it came in 2nd place.  But I think it was #1

I followed the recipe with some minor variations, i.e. I roasted the garlic as well and replaced half of tahini with some olive oil. I think this recipe is a keeper.

Did not like this. It was sour from all the lemon juice, and super bitter from the tahini. Also, no olive oil? No salt? Will not be making this again. I had to process another can of garbanzos, another clove of garlic, and another half cup of peppers into this.

My family and I really enjoyed this recipe.  My picky 4 year old even asked if she could have some for breakfast!   It's very easy to make and you could even leave out the peppers and add other flavors.  I will definitely be making this again.

Five stars for the peppers and the easiness of the recipe! Basil just doesn't seem right for hummus (and I'm not sure 1/4 tsp. would even be noticed). I used a scant tsp. of cumin and I think it worked better with the tahini. A good drizzle of excellent olive oil and the lemon juice make more sense. That being said, I'm sure that there are as many hummus recipes as there are cooks who make it, all of us tweaking it to our tastes once we are familiar with the method and the tradition.

I thought the recipe was good and had my friend try it before i jazzed it up. My friend thought the original version was bland.  I added some sea salt, cumin,  and crushed red pepper flakes taste. I had him try it again, and he loved it.

I made this today for the second time.for Clean Monday, which is the first day of Lent in Greece. I followed the recipe practically as written - the only changes I made were to add some spices (cumin, cayenne powder) as I wanted it a little spicier, and omitted the dried basil, which I find tasteless. I also included the juice from my home-cooked garbanzos, having taken note of reviews saying it was too thick. The result was tasty, but mine turned out a little soupy, probably because my tahini was more runny than my usual brand. I really like the sweetness added by the roasted red peppers, as tahini can be a little bitter. Overall, a very good recipe that I will continue to make.

Super yummy, plus a little something different for the regular hummus fans. Also, fun side note, if you ever forget about the tahini in your fridge and it goes bad, peanut butter can be used as a substitute.

With a few changes this recipe was great. I added more garlic, some olive oil, a couple dashes of smoked paprika, and a touch of sesame oil. The smooth consistency I like in my hummus was achieved with the olive oil. If grainy is your thing then leave it out.

Just made this recipe.  Overall it is very yummy.  Only thing I didn't like is the more coarse texture; I like hummus a bit smoother.  Next time I am going to try to add a few Tbsp of olive oil to see if that helps and and also add salt and pepper prior to blending to ensure even flavor.  Overall, good easy recipe!

I made this for a Christmas party and it was yummy! I did cut back on the tahini to 1/4 cup as it's not one my favorite flavors, but you do need it. Used one whole red pepper I roasted in the oven and fresh lemon juice.  Upped the dried basil to 1/2 tsp and added 1/4 tsp salt.  DELISH!! You could also do this with cannellini beans or whatever bean you prefer! Very good recipe and very healthy! Thank you Marbalet!

Roasted red pepper hummus is the only kind I like. This is my first time making my own. I always buy store bought. This was just as good! Next time I'll probably add one or two more cloves of garlic. I don't have a food processor, so I used my blender. It has one of those things that you can use to mash and stir things around as you blend.

A good way to use roasted red peppers, olives, basil, cumin. Easy on the red pepper. Add salt.

I couldn't find tahini at the store I went to, and didn't feel like making another stop. Other reviewers said they left it out and it was fine, so I did as well. Likely because of omitting the tahini, it was a little on the runny side, but it still tasted really good and had a decent texture. Next time I will plan ahead and look for tahini to see if it makes a difference.

Easy, beautiful, and delicious.  I used bottled lemon juice ( that's what I had around) and added a little olive oil to make it process through my blender a little easier.  Don't forget to add a little salt, it makes a big difference.

So easy with my super-dooper new food processor. Turned out better than the gourmet stuff I used to buy at Whole Foods. I only used one clove of garlic and it was more than enough...

HOWEVER, I had roasted cecis (garbanzos) left over (about 1/4 c) and I used those along with canellini beans (can you tell I'm Italian?).  I used a little very fruity olive oil and a little tahini, not much lemon juice.  The roasted beans REALLY made it toasty!!

I made the hummus in my blender which was kind of a pain because of the thickness, but it turned out nice and smooth.  I also made my own tahini.  Homemade tahini is really quite strong so I think next time I will add a little less, maybe 1/4 cup.  Served with home baked pita chips.  Overall, it was delicious and didn't last long!

Excellent and easy hummus recipe. I have to say though that when I first made it, it tasted bitter. Once I refrigerated it overnight, the bitterness was gone and it was delicious. I made it exactly according to the recipe.

Wow!  What a great overall taste.  The only change I would make is to use one clove of garlic next time.  And I too removed the skin off the beans by rubbing them, so the creaminess really stood out.  I'll make this again and again.  Wish I could freeze it.

it wasnt the best hummus i've ever tasted, but it was pretty good. a little too much tahini, and it definately needed cumin. i could barely notice the roasted red pepper, so i would suggest using a little bit more pepper

OMGosh this is so EASY and GOOD.  I was out of basil (imagine!) so used marjoram. I used the juice from a 1/2 lemon.  I cannot stress enough how EASY this is and... Good!  Thank you thank you for a great recipe.  Next time I will make a double batch and try to leave enough to chill.  :)

Easy and nearly fool proof. I skipped the tahini (I'm not a fan of it) and used 3 Tbsp. of lemon juice and a small drizzle of olive oil, maybe 1 tsp. worth. Delicious with warm naan or everything bagel chips. I bet this will be even better the second day!

I've been making a great Weightwatcher's recipe for years, but wanted something different.  This one is delicious, but I made a few changes to reduce fat and also because of the comments about so much lemon juice.  I reduced the tahini -- which has a lot of fat in it -- and lemon juice to 2 tablespoons each and added 2 heaping tablespoons of plain, nonfat yogurt.  Then, I used some roasted red pepper bruschetta spread, as I did not have roasted red peppers.  It turned out creamy and flavorful.

If I make this again I will definitely cut down on the lemon juice. It is too tart for our taste, I also added about 1/2 teaspoon of kosher salt and a pinch of sugar to try to correct the lemon taste.

I originally rated this with one star.  However after adding to it, I went in and edited my review the day after I made this.  After first making this hummus I found it to be quite horrible.  It tasted nothing like hummus.  Then after looking at some other recipes, hoping to find something to add to it, I realized it was missing a KEY ingredient....Cumin!  I went home and added about 1 TB of cumin, let it sit in the fridge for a few hours and tried it again.  Now it tastes like hummus!  I also added a little E.V.O.O. to the food processor as well.  I thought the basil was a little out of sorts but added it anyways.  I didn't really think it added anything to the recipe though.  If you make this make sure to add the cumin.  It wouldn't be hummus without it!

I have never made hummus before, but I love the storebought stuff.  This was very good.  I added about 1/4 tsp of salt for flavor and a couple Tbs of olive oil, because my Magic Bullet was having a little bit of difficulty with the thickness.  It was delicious right after mixing up and I can't wait to try it tomorrow after letting it sit in the fridge to mingle the flavors.  Thank you for an easy, yummy recipe!

Very easy and tasty. It was way too lemony though, so I would cut way down on lemon juice. I used an entire jar of roasted red peppers and drizzled in some olive oil. I also added some chopped roasted red peppers and olive oil to the top.

This was pretty good. Although next time I make it I think I'll roast my own pepers. I used peppers from a jar and the colour was a bit unappetziing. All the same my friends enjoyed this. Many Thanks.

This was my first time making Hummus, but it was very easy.  I bought a very small quantity of the tahini at a health food store, so the cost was minimal.  The second time I made it, I realized I was out of lemon juice, so I replaced it with hot sauce!   OMG it was so delicious and everyone loved it!  I am going to make several batches to put in Christmas gift baskets.  Keep up the good work!

Delicious! So easy and so much better than the store bought. I have made this many times. People are always impressed.  I sometimes double the recipe and use 1 can of cannellini beans along with 1 can of garbanzo beans. Thanks!

I've never tasted hummus before so I bought some just so I would know about what it was to taste like.  It's not one of my favorite appetizers but I needed to prepare roasted red pepper hummus for a wedding this past week-end. I received wonderful comments. One gentleman said,
"I eat hummus all the time & this beats all I've ever tasted!" He came back for more... many times. Thank You so much for the great recipe!

We liked this recipes but for 4 servings we did make a few changes. We added an entire 12 oz jar of roasted red peppers and included 1/3 cup of the liquid from them. We also added 1 tsp salt. For the 4 servings we still only used 1/3 cup of lemon juice. These changes enhanced the flavor and consistancy of the Hummus greatly.

This recipe is DELICIOUS!  I will be making it weekly to bring into work for a veggie dip :)  I stuck to the recipe and DID NOT use olive oil (trying to cut out fat) and it was delicious-- creamy, smooth... I won't buy hummus at the store ever again!

I made this and initially thought it sucked - but after letting it sit overnight in the fridge the flavors married and it is VERY tasty - I added 1/2 tsp of red pepper flakes for some heat(hence the 4 stars).  Don't judge it by first taste! Delish!

A good foundation, but so bland.  I added capers, balsamic vinegarette dressing, thyme, oregano, salt, pepper, sage, celery salt, more lemon juice, more basil, sesame seeds (for texture), and of course olive oil.  But, a great start!  Just gotta spice it up a bit (a lot)!

This was extremely easy to make and was a hit! I served with toasted pita chips and also added roasted red peppers on top of it for a garnish.

This recipe was soooo easy to follow, and exceptional!  I added a little bit more of the basil then required.  Also, after it's done, I sprinkled some paprika on top and added some plain crumbled feta cheese.  Thank you for this quick and easy recipe!

I love this recipe! I ended up putting in 2 and a half to 3 cloves of garlic (kept grabbing small ones). It was much more lemony then I expected but I liked that. Gave it a fresh taste. And the peppers definatly added greatly. I intend to make this often.

It was just OK. I made a few other dips and no one commented on this one. I should have read the other reviews and added olive oil. It was a bit on the dry side. Too bad cause we love roasted red peppers and it was easy to make. Just nothing to write home about.

I added 1/2 cup of yogurt and skipped the basil. It was exactly what I was looking for.
