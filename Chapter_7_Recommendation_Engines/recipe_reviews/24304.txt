I made these for Easter.  They turned out super cute and are fairly good as far as taste.  The only substitution I made was pecans vs walnuts.  The cookie is a pecan sandy type texture.  The fondant eggs are actually very good - they taste like frosting - and add sweetness and temper the dryness of the cookie.  I had been very tempted to use jelly beans or other egg shaped candies for the eggs and I'm very glad I didn't!  The fondant eggs were easy to make and were a perfect compliment to the cookie.

I love this recipe.  The cookies turn out so cute!  I'll post a picture of the batch I made.  I greased the cookie sheet, but there's a lot of butter in the dough so it may not be necessary.  The recipe says to make the dough balls 1 teaspoon size, but I recommend at least a tablespoon of dough per nest.  The dough and fondant were easy to work with so I suppose you could make the nests and eggs any size you like.  They taste like a shortbread cookie rolled in walnuts, and the almond flavored fondant eggs are a perfect flavor match.  I made three tiny eggs per nest, by rolling little pieces of fondant in a ball.  I'll definitely make this recipe again!

Wow!  Every cookie platter should have at least one beautiful, colorful cookie, and this is it!  The "nest" is a wonderful, buttery, crunchy shortbread-type cookie, not overly sweet. The eggs are the perfect counterpart; sweet little almond flavored morsels that melt in your mouth. I made the mistake of flattening my nests too much, because I wanted to have enough room for 3 eggs in each nest. They flattened and spread a little more while baking, so it would have been better to just make a ball, with a thumbprint-sized depression, like the recipe says. The eggs are easy to make, kind of like playing with clay, but do take time. Because they are sweet, it is better to make them small, and they will fit into the nests better that way, too.  I baked the cookies first, then made the eggs while watching tv.  Very easy, and fun, too. These will definitely be a staple on my Christmas, Easter, etc. cookie platters. It is not always easy to find something that both looks pretty and tastes good, but these fit the bill. Thank you, so much, for sharing the recipe!

I fell in love with how these cookies looked, but wasn't sure I was really going to like the taste. I made a batch and they taste as AWESOME as they look. I had to add extra powdered sugar to the fondant eggs because they were too sticky, but it didn't effect the taste. I love these so much.

Pretty darn cute and yummy too. I followed the recipe, for the most part, but I did substitute pecans for walnuts. I also mixed a few of the chopped pecans into the dough. I baked on parchment. I will probably make these again next Easter.

These are great!  The egg wash helps secure the walnuts.  Almond in the fondant is wonderful.

These cookies are precious!  The dough has a very mild flavor, and the eggs make them a showstopper.  Next time I might experiment and add butter flavor instead (to the dough).

These were cute and the fondant like eggs really looked the color of a robin's egg. The cookies were easy to make and using a standard cookie scoop, did yield the suggested amount. I just made a 1/2 recipe to test them. The cookies I had to leave in a little longer than suggested and a minute or so before removing I had to repress the centers as they had puffed up some. The cookies kind of tasted like a soft pecan sandy. Where I had trouble with was the eggs. They actually taste good with the cookie because eaten with the cookie it is like added frosting. However, I mixed the dough and it wasn't coming together completely. Then, I ended up adding about 1/4 tsp. of water. That made them too soft and flatten some after shaping. I think, next time I would just keep kneading or even try some jelly beans with a little icing to make them stick to change it up. After finishing the cookie I put them on a tray with plastic wrap in the fridge and they held up nicely. They were fun to make and were a nice and different Easter treat.

You could also make them with chow mein noodles and chocolate.They stick together better with the noodles.They also have cadbury eggs speckled,and in different colors. You could make many different kinds of nests!

Awesome cookie! For anyone thinking about making these, PLEASE make the fondant eggs as stated in the recipe instead of just using chocolate covered eggs to save time. They *make* the cookie into the five-star treats that they are.  The only thing I did differently was to use pecans instead of walnuts. I'm just not a walnut fan, otherwise I followed the directions exactly.

Eventually these came out looking great but I had some trouble with making the eggs. I had to probably another whole cup of confectioners' sugar as they were way too stick for me with just 2 cups. I also had to grease my hands with baking cooking spray to be able to release them into nests. They tasted OK to me - definitely a dry cookie, but with the eggs they tasted decent. Thanks for the recipe!

Cookies did not cook after 12 minutes, I did pre-heat, but the again I guess it was ok because they kind of flattened out (I did make little teaspoon sized balls & just depressed them with my thumb) so after 12 minutes I could make another indentation because they were still soft.
