Terrific soup, without question one of the best potato soups ever.  It's not a picky recipe either...I made a double recipe of it (large family) and had to substitute about a cup of the 5 cups of milk I needed with evaporated milk, soft cheese, sour cream, and half and half; plus, we were all out of swiss chesse, so I used two and half cups of Cabot extra sharp cheddar.  The results were delicious--my mom loved it so much she had seconds and even thirds!  

Since I hadn't read the reviews before I cooked it, I was a little surprised about how peppery it turned out, but I didn't think it was TOO peppery, necessarily.  Anyway, this soup does take some time, but it is so wonderful that it's definitely worth it.  I will make it again in the winter, I'm sure.

This is a great soup, I tried it with Sharp Cheddar cheese instead of Swiss cheese and it was great!

Just let me say that I am not the biggest swiss cheese fan, well, I wasn't the biggest swiss cheese until now.  This soup is fantastic.  I was sooo leary about the swiss, and as others stated, it really is tasty in this soup, in fact I wished that I had bought more, so that I could add more.  My 11 yr. old ate 3 helpings!  I used skim milk, added a few pieces of left over broccoli, chopped, & 1/4 c. of left over corn.  I WILL make this again, it was great!  Thanks Marilyn!

A wonderful soup for a cold autumn day. Next time I will definitely add some bacon pieces either to individual bowls or in the soup itself. It needs a bit more flavor. I had some leeks I needed to use up, so used that instead of onion. I cut up my potatoes in small pieces, not quarters, and for six servings used just two rather large (baking size) yukon gold potatoes. Personal preference. I didn't have vegetable broth, so used chicken broth. To keep soup from having a flour taste, and from getting lumps, I melted my butter, added the flour, cooked for about three minutes then added the milk. Let the milk heat a bit (but not to boiling) then after mashing up the veggies, added it to the vegetables. That is the best way to cook this so there are no lumps. I used coarsely ground black pepper, and I didn't have enough Swiss cheese, only a couple of slices, so I used up some other cheeses along with the Swiss: cheddar, a white cheddar, and parmasan. It was a great soup. Rates a five or more stores. Thick, yes it is rich, but oh so good.

I thought this was a great recipe.  I did change it up a bit.  First, I used sharp cheddar instead.  Second, I added a bit of cayenne pepper. And thirdly, while the broth and vegetables were cooking I added a tea strainer with fresh garlic cloves and then took out before adding the milk.  That said, it was a great recipe and I really, really enjoyed it and will definently make it again.

One word...WoW!  We doubled it, (lg family) and it was a hit.  When I read recipe reviews here, I pay close attention to the ones that comment about how their picky eater loved the dish.  I have yet to have my daughter love a dish that other finicky children chow on.  Well, this recipe is the first time I have had her eat a soup!  I have tried many potatoe soups, and this is the one she ate!  Aside form that I made a few substitutions.  I used reconstituted dry skim milk, a whole red onion (pulverized), and I used low fat swiss and cheddar.  I think I may try asome dill havarti next time for a change.  This will be a regular on our monthly menu.

Sliced the potatoes and carrots and then cooked in my steamer for 20 minutes. Added veggies to liquid in crock pot and cooked for 30 minutes on high. Also, added 1 tsp onion powder, 1 tbsp minced garlic, and 2 cups Italian cheese blend. Turned out fantastic!!

I liked this soup, but the addition of the swiss cheese really disagreed with me, and I wasn't interested in the leftovers.  Next time I make this, I'll use cheddar cheese.  I used a homemade vegetable broth, and added a dash of cayenne, which made it much more flavorful.  The texture is perfect, though, and overall it's a very hearty meal!  I chose to serve it with a green vegetable and small slices of bread from a baguette.

As other reviewers have said, I too, do NOT like swiss cheese.  I used it anyway and thought it turned out great!  I used chicken broth instead of vegetable broth because that is what I had on hand.  I changed the method by making a roux...melt the butter in a pot, whisk in the flour, add the milk and stir over heat until thick.  Add the cheese to the milk mixture.  Then I added the milk mixture to the potato mixture.  It was great!

This soup tastes great.  The recipe's a little ambiguous about the potatos.  I used 8 large baking potatos, intending to double the recipe, only to end up more than quadrupling it.  This is a great recipe for people who don't eat meat.  Very hearty.

I have made this soup three times now, and it's delicious.  I use frozen skinless hash browns to cut down on prep time.  Rather than mash the cooked veggies and broth, I run it through my blender.  This "hides" the veggies from my picky children.  I've used both vegetable and chicken broth, and both swiss and cheddar cheese, and still had great results.

This is the BEST potato soup that my boyfriend and I have ever had... My boyfriend was sick when I made this so I doubled the recipe (I knew we would be eating it alot). I am so happy that I did because we ate every bite. Before it was all gone, he was asking when I was going to make it again! I altered the recipe a little bit (just for personal taste). I omitted the celery & corn. I used a few more potatoes than the recipe called for and I used sharp cheddar cheese instead of the swiss. I liked the cheddar but next time I will try the swiss and see how it works. Thank you for submitting this recipe, this will be a tradition in our family for years to come.

This is so good. I have made it several times and it is always a favorite on those cold days. ***Very important that you follow the recipe in order. I made the mistake of swapping some steps and I did not get the same result.***

Really good soup but I adjusted this soup a little bit and I have to admit it is the best soup I have ever made. Instead of vegetable broth, I used a can of cheese soup and I added a 3/4 cup of Pale Ale ( Bridgeport's if you are wondering). I also added 1/2 cup of cheddar and jack cheese. This recipe came out amazing! Everyone loved it and they are begging for seconds! Might be good to add broccoli too if you like it.

This dish is excellent..and you don't need the exact ingredience. I used a fish called SWEI? ever heard of it? neither did I..It's sort of like tilapia, also new to my vocabulary..I made adjustments to my italian taste buds, and added a little garlic powder and pepper to the fish when I layed them out on the baking sheets, plus used a combination of mozzarella, romano and parmesan cheese in my potato chip mixture..it turned out great..

Definitely use less pepper (I used half of what was called for, still a little peppery) and used half of parsley called for, would do the same again.  Cooked and mashed up my potatoes ahead of time, boiled the celery and carrot in the chicken broth (did not have veg. broth).  Ended up adding canned corn to the soup for the kids and they liked it better that way.  Good recipe, tasted great on a cool fall night.

Amazing potato soup, first had it at a friend's house and just had to get the recipe.  This soup I can eat for days at a time!  Also good to freeze if you want to make a huge pot and save some for later.

I must confess...my husband does most of the cooking.  But I find the recipes!  I gave him the recipe for this soup, and he said it sounded great, so he made it, and everyone loved it!!!  I thought it was a bit peppery, but even the kids ate it up.  Two days later, I discovered he hadn't used the Swiss cheese, but made a mistake and used Mozzarella.  It was so delicious the way it was, but I can't wait to try it with the Swiss!  And maybe next time we'll use a little dill instead of pepper.

Loved it.  My daughter is a vegetarian so I cooked following the recipe until almost complete, I put some aside for her and added cubed ham into the rest.  Let the ham heat through and then added cheddar cheese instead of swiss.  Delicious.

This was my first potato soup! I used 5 small/medium sized potatoes, a whole can of veggie broth (almost 2 cups) and added a dash of garlic salt. It turned out amazing! I topped it with fresh chives and some shredded colby jack cheese. 

I was hesitant about the Swiss cheese, but it was perfect. Other than my minor additions, I wouldn't have changed anything about this recipe.

Not the best Potato soup I've ever had, but still really good.  I omitted the onion and didn't peel the red potatoes (I love skins!).

very good recipe!  i used red potatoes and sauteed the celery and onions before i added them to the broth. I also used cheddar cheese because I am not a big fan of swiss.   My husband and I both enjoyed it.  Great for a cold winter day!

I made this soup gluten free by using a gluten free flour mix to thicken it in place of the regular flour, and I used grated Gruyere instead of Swiss.  My husband called it "restaurant quality" soup.  Very complex flavors and so easy!

This soup is awesome, we make it all the time.  It's just as good with mozzarella instead of the swiss, and I always add some cheddar cheese as well.  I also tried making it with zucchini and frozen corn once when I realized I didn't have any celery, and my fiancee liked it even better.  A little time consuming, but well worth it!

Love this recipe! A friend brought it over after we had our first baby, and it was so delicious I asked for the recipe.  I make it "as is" and it is just perfect for us!  Thanks for sharing!!

This is a great soup.  My family loves it.  I don't give it 5 stars because it definitely needs about twice the broth called for.  I also increase the carrot and celery to make it a bit more healthy.  For the  non-vegetarians in our house, adding fried, crumbled bacon is a hit.

A good soup if modifications are made. 4 cups vegetable broth (I needed that much to cover the potatoes in my saucepan), 2-3 cups cheese, 1/2 tsp. or less black pepper. Plain soy milk worked well as a substitute for regular milk.

This is pretty good.  The only changes I made were to use 1 c. veggie broth and 1/2 c. chicken broth (that's all I had) and extra sharp white cheddar in place of the swiss.  I think this soup would benefit greatly from the addition of ham or bacon.

Really, really great recipe! My husband substituted  fresh chopped thyme, rosemary, and oregano for the dried parsley and it was amazing! Also, we used good chicken stock instead of veggie broth. Very earthy and chowder-like. Easy and totally worth it!!

A really tasty soup.  Did not have vege broth so I made some of my own with chicken bones, celery & carrot.  Also substituted Swiss cheese with Cheddar cheese and made the soup really thick with more potatoes.

Excellent!!!! 
I made it a bit lower in fat by using 3 Tbsp. of the hot soup instead of the melted butter.  Served it with croutons on top.

I just finished making this (and tasting it) for dinner!  Yum yum.  Like several people I swapped out the cheese - not because I don't like Swiss, but because I didn't have it on hand.  I used a Mexican cheese blend.  I doubled the recipe and it came out delicious.  My only complaint is the potatoes.  I used 8 potatoes and it isn't quite enough.  I wish that instead of a # of potatoes it had a # of cups of potatoes.  I am about to cut up some more potatoes, soften them up and throw them in the soup.  Yum yum!

We love this soup! I leave out the salt and use shredded Mexican blend cheese. Great for my vegetarian daughter and the rest of us can add bacon or ham if we choose.

Loved the overall taste, but found it to be really peppery.  I think next time I'll cut it in half and see how that turns out.

Excellent soup. Extremely easy to make, simple.  Only changes I made was to add broccoli instead of celery as I did not have. Used regular marble cheese in place of swiss.  I made 4 servings and found that it was about right for only two people. Make the full recipe if you want leftovers! Loved it!

This is a very filling soup!  I used sharp cheddar and added some fresh mushrooms.  I only added some cayenne pepper after it was finished to see if it really needed it.  I like spicy so it was delicious!

This is a good basic recipe.  I changed some things though.  I didn't have any celery so I skipped it although I did put in a little celery salt.  I added a couple cloves of garlic as well.  I pureed the soup instead of just partially mashing it and hid some frozen corn in it as well.  I have a picky 5 year old to try to get veggies into.  Other than that I followed it in terms of ingredients and procedure.  Good recipe!!

Yum! The first time I made it I didn't cook long enough after adding the flour mixture so the soup had an uncooked  flour taste, but the second time I made sure to cook longer, and it turned out great! Thanks!

I JUST GOT DONE MAKING THIS AND IT'S THE BOMB,THE CLOSEST I'VE COME TO THAT OLD FASHIONED SOUP FROM MY CHILDHOOD. I HAD TO USE CHICKEN BROTH INSTEAD OF VEG, I DOUBLED THE RECIPE AND IT CAME OUT A LITTLE SOUPY. THOUGHT I HAD SOME MASHED POTATO FLAKES TO THICKEN IT UP, DIDN'T, SO I USED A PACKET OF INSTANT GRITS. THIS IS *REALLY* GOOD,THANK YOU FOR THE POST.

This is the best potato soup I have ever had--never would have though swiss cheese would do the trick.

Very tasty and easy to make.  The only suggestion is to make it with more liquid.  The left overs is more like mashed potatoes.

This was a very good potato cheese soup!  I used chicken broth instead of veggie, Cheddar instead of Swiss (since my husband HATES Swiss), added an extra potato, and omitted the carrot.  I also cut my potatoes into smaller chunks than the recipe states so I didn't have to do as much mashing.  Note that I cut down on the salt & pepper as suggested by other reviewers, but then ended up adding more of both later, so next time I'll use the s&p amounts as stated.  This soup was good on it's own, but even better with some crumbled bacon added when it was served.  YUM!  I'll definitely make this again!

Very good soup!  I liked the Swiss cheese instead of the usual Cheddar.  I did not add the tsp. of salt as there is plenty in the broth, and I also used low-sodium Swiss cheese and then let people salt as they wanted.  I used a hand masher to slightly mash the ingredients.  Great for a cool evening.

Very good potato soup recipe.  I omitted the carrots and celery and it still came out wonderful.  Nice 'n' thick and creamy! Warms you right up on a cold, chilly night.

Okay, not as good as I expected after all the rave reviews, I don't think I'll even eat the leftovers.  I will keep searching for a better potato soup recipe.

I love, love, LOVE this recipe! I make it at least once every two weeks, and have made other people try it -- everyone loves it, vegetarian and non-vegetarian alike. I usually double it and add more potatoes to make it thicker. I also substitute broccoli for the celery, and sometimes add other veggies like parsnips or corn. And I've tried different cheeses -- monterey jack, cheddar, mozzarella, havarti -- all taste great. I'd definitely recommend this hearty soup to anyone!

I don't even like Swiss cheese but this soup was awesome!  Put 1/2 tsp pepper after reading some of the other reviews.  Added some frozen broccoli.  Served it with Italian bread and butter.  Yummy and very filling!

It was absolutely fabulous. One of my favorite soups
of all time! It was also much more filling than I had anticipated.
I didn't have celery, and wound up using reduced-fat
swiss cheese and it was still great!

I made this soup when I found I was having visitors.  I didn't have much time to prepare.  It was super easy and quick to fix.  It was also delicious, everyone had seconds!  My husband also said it was a keeper.

This soup was fantastic! The only changes I made was to add a dash of rosemary, thyme, and basil in place of the parsley, and I added cheddar instead of swiss. I will definitely be making this again!

minor tweaks - added parsnip along with carrot (they're in season), substituted sharp cheddar because in the US most swiss is too mild. easy and fun to make - took an hour start to finish.

I actually tripled the recipe and used chicken broth that I had, and the added some garlic pepper seasoning instead of all the plain pepper that it called for. I didn't have any Swiss cheese so I added four cups of sharp cheddar. Heck yeah! Next time I think I might try leaving out the carrot and add in some kind of sausage!

I doubled the recipe as many have also done. I still used the same amount of onion though. Used a white cheddar instead of Swiss. My husband, myself enjoyed this soup a lot. Very simple, quick hot meal for a busy work week. Will certainly make again.

This was the first soup recipe I ever made and it was absolutely delicious. I added everything in my refrigerator that was going bad and also put in some Velveeta cheese. I didn't have time to measure any of the ingredients out so I just threw everything in and it still came out perfect! One thing the recipe doesn't mention is  after bringing it to a boil, use a spatula or a spoon to stir it because it will be HOT. Still a five star recipe, just don't forget to add the potatoes like I did!

I didn't have any swiss cheese on hand, so I used sharp / ex. sharp cheddar and I omitted the carrots. I also made a roux  with the butter, milk, & flour which was seasoned with the parsley &  pepper prior to adding it to the stock & veggies. I enjoyed it, but my S.O. would have liked more seasoning.

This is a delicious recipe!!  I doubled the recipe, subbed two cups of low fat buttermilk, left the skins on the potatoes, added 1 cup of sliced baby Bella mushrooms and about 1 1/2 tsp of cayenne pepper.

So so so good!! I usually use half sweet potato and half potato, but this time it was all potatoes. I also use cheddar instead of swiss and top it off with bacon bits. It's always a hit in our home.

Sort of boring.  I think using chicken broth instead of veggie broth would help it. I added heavy cream to mine along with additional herbs. I didn't particularly care for the Swiss cheese addition either.

This soup was really good. I made a couple of changes only because 1) I thought I had vegetable broth on hand but did not so I used a vegetarian chicken base. ) I fudged with the liquid as I felt I did not have enough liquid to simmer the potatoes in (I don't know if my potatoes were larger or if it should call for more liquid). So I think I used an extra cup of water, 1/2 cup of milk and TBSP each of butter/flour. I also did not use all the pepper it called for. Even with my changes this is a great soup!

This was excellent. I used what I had on hand so it was slightly different. I didn't want to add carrots or celery, and I had lots of shredded Colby jack cheese on hand so thats what I used. Next time I will make it as directed. I also added chopped bacon when it was done.

This is a great recipe.  And like another reviewer said, it is not picky.  I used red potatoes and had to use 2 full cans of veggie broth to cover all of the veggies.  I was worried it wouldn't get thick enough with the extra broth but I followed everything else exact and it was perfect.  I also subbed sharp cheddar for swiss again because it's what I had on hand.  The only other things I did different was add a bay leaf and 2 cloves minced garlic while simmering, and i also added some frozen peas and broccoli to give it some color.  Served with crusty bread and topped with green onions... Delicious!

An excellent soup that I will make again. I diced the vegetables very small and sautéed them in a bit of olive oil with salt and pepper before I added homemade chicken broth. When the vegetables were cooked I continued the recipe as directed. I did not mash the vegetables. The Swiss cheese was better than cheddar cheese used in other recipes,  in my opinion.  I noticed the picture had bacon, cheese, onion added on top which was not listed or needed. I look forward to making this soup again.

Sounded so good that I wanted to make it and had to improvise with what I had on hand. I didn't peel my potatoes, the skins added to the flavor. I used  chicken stock, little bit of heavy cream and milk together, added broccoli and no pepper. Didn't have swiss, used a mexican blend that I use for quesadillas. Yummo.

My husband and I loved this soup.  I used tilsit cheese since I had it on hand and it was delicious.  I used a little over half of the milk, too.  I also added a little minced fresh rosemary because I don't think you can ever go wrong adding rosemary, and a little more salt.  I am not a salt lover and rarely salt my food, but this seemed to need a little more, but not much.  It was really good and definitely something I will make again.

I did not need the flour mixture. I added cream instead of milk, and by the time the notates where partially mashed and the cheese was added the soup was thick enough. Yummy.

I thought the recipe didn't call for nearly enough broth. I ended up adding an entire 32 oz container of stock and some water in order to submerge everything. Otherwise, this is amazing. Awesome dish for those cold nights---especially Fridays in Lent!

First off, the recipe is so simple and almost impossible to mess up.  It is a great soup originally but also phenomenal when you add stuff to your taste! I added a little more celery, used cheddar cheese and even added some of my own seasonings. The first time making it and i am already in love. Great soup, easy and quick to make and fun to get creative with! 10/10

I doubled the recipe and because the vegetable broth had more than 5 cups of broth in the box I just added it.  I did not have the parsley so did without that and on another occasion I used fresh parsley.  I also made my thickening out of flour and milk  and the second time used mashed potato flakes.  You can do whatever you want with this recipe and it will be good I do believe.  It was delicious and everyone loved it.  Will use it again and again.

Made it today and our pickiest eater ate it all! I omitted the carrots, added cooked bacon in the soup, and used cheddar cheese instead for Swiss and it was good. Very simple recipe and didn't take long to make.

One word... DELICIOUS! I sautéed the onions and celery before hand, swapped the Swiss out for sharp cheddar made from 2% and used brown rice floor. Thank you so much for the wonderful yet simple recipe!

Could have more flavor if you added some additional spices.  Otherwise pretty bland but healthy and cheap.

Combined this with the advice of The Pioneer Woman's "perfect potato soup" recipe which adds Cajun seasoning mix and adjusted the dairy to (1/2 cup) heavy cream and (1.5 cup) 2% milk. I also added water (about 1/2 can of the broth can) and 5 potatoes. No cheese needed until you're serving (mine turned out good even without).

I only had beef broth on hand, so I used that. Also, used monterey jack/cheddar mix. Only made the substitutions because I didn't have the original ingredients on had. Delicious! Perfect on a cold winter afternoon.

I LOVE this soup! Though, it's so rich an creamy it's more of a chowder. Still, I've made it about 4 times and just gorge myself. I took the advice of a previous reviewer and melted the butter in a large saucepan, then added the flour. I added the milk, parsley (no pepper) and stirred until heated, then added it to the potato pot. I've nearly tripled this recipe when making it, but I need to remind myself the next time not to triple the amount of flour. This soup gets nice and thick with no difficulty. It truly is a forgiving recipe. Oh and the cheese. The cheese with this soup is divine. I use cheddar everytime, as I love the taste of cheddar. I suppose sometime I should try Swiss and see if it tastes any different. Overall this is one of my favorite recipes to have ever come across on this site.

Soup was a hit!  I doubled the cheese and used sharp cheddar instead of swiss.  Also added more salt, pepper and cayenne.  I ended up putting more vegetable broth into it since I had extra - 2 1/2 cups total.  Easy enough - will make again.

I too, substituted cheddar for swiss because I can't stand swiss and already had cheddar in the fridge, along with everything else in house to make this simple recipe.
Was delicious. My (chef) husband came home from work and was skeptical that I actually made it and didn't buy it from somewhere! He already requested I make it again in the future!

Great base to this soup!  I did use sharp cheddar as some recommended, but may give it a try with the swiss next time.  I doubled the recipe and also chopped up 12 pieces of precooked bacon and added at the end.  Was a huge hit!

Yum! I left the skin on the potatoes and ended up needing a lot more broth, but it was still very good! I used cheddar cheese and left out the flour all together since it was already so thick. I'll probably use only half a teaspoon of pepper next time, too. Bacon and green onions on top added a nice touch! I'll definitely make this again!

This recipe got big raves at my dinner party tonight! 
I used the recipe adjuster to work to serve 10 people. 
It called for a little over 1/4 of a cup butter. I added 1/2 cup butter. Instead of adding 4 cups of milk, I added 3 cups of milk and 1 cup half and half cream. I skipped adding pepper. Substituted celery for green bell pepper. I was amazing! I wish I had done a double batch!

This soup was SOOOO good! But I made changes cuz' I forgot to buy some stuff..

I used 3 cups whole milk instead
I used Velveeta and Sharp Cheddar cheeses
I didn't have celery seed so I added some garlic and a cajun seasoning
I didn't have flour so I used biscuit mix that was an All-Purpose Mix
I used maybe 8-10 potatoes, 2 carrots chopped, and 2 stalks of celery chopped.
I used 1.5 cup of vegetable broth and 1.5 cups of chicken broth.
Because of adding more of things, I also had to add more parsley, salt and pepper as it went along.

it made about 6 bowls worth but I was really hoping I'd have leftovers. Next time i will add more of everything so I have some left over. It was SOOO good! I "garnish" it with smoked sausage because the men need their beef; so we put sausage on top of the soup and serve with french bread.

Delicious! My son, who doesn't usually like potato soup, loved it too. He said if I make it like this everytime, he'll always eat it. The only thing I did differently was I used colby jack cheese because that is what I had on hand. Would like to try it with the swiss next time though.

It was okay. Like some have said it was bland. I also do NOT like how they tell you to thicken it. I like my roues cooked a little before putting into liquids, should have gone with my gut on that and not the recipe. Next time ill add some ham with the bone.

I did some minor adjustments to the recipe to suit personal taste.  I used sweet potatoes instead of regular potatoes, marble cheese instead of swiss cheese, and some sweet potato squash that I had been looking for something to do with, but all in all it was a great recipe.  Perfect for a chilly November evening.  I will definitely make this again.

Great soup for fall although I did have to tinker with some of the amounts.  One and a half cups of veggie broth just wasn't enough liquid to boil the veggies.

Easy and delicious!  Even my pickiest eaters (who started out very suspicious) liked this one!  I did use the grated cheese I had on hand--a cheddar blend of some kind--instead of the swiss, but other than that I made it exactly according to the recipe.  It cooked up faster than I expected, and it was fantastic.

I make this soup all the time for my room mate and I, and have also gone to my parents' house and made it for them, it's always a hit! I'm not a swiss fan, so I usually use sharp yellow or white cheddar, and throw in a few strips of crumbled cooked bacon for some extra oomph. Good with sliced chives on top and a pretzel roll.

Good soup, but too heavy. Next time I'll use half the cheese (in fact, I thought it tasted great BEFORE adding the cheese). Also, I used rice milk instead of cows milk so it's even lighter than it would have been. Also, used celery instead of onions since neither my son or me like onions. Also, chopped up fresh parsley instead of dried. Thought that added some great flavor. Will definitely make it again...just with a couple more modifications (I like to experiment). Maybe with cheddar instead of Swiss cheese next time...

Very easy to make and very good on this cold night.  I doubled the recipe and my family of four ate almost the whole pot!  I didn't have celery so I didn't use and used onion powder instead of onions (kids don't care much for them.)  I didn't have vegetable broth so I used chicken.  Amazing recipe - will be used over and over!  Thanks so much for posting!

This is a recipe that I have been making, over and over again, for a few years ago for my friends and family. I have never gotten anything but rave reviews. The only substitutions I make are using Muenster cheese, more pepper, and sometimes a little more veggie broth. Thanks for the recipe!

Great stuff! Swiss cheese rounded out the taste, almost sweet. Didn't add very much pepper either.

This was really good!  I too added ingredients such as mushrooms.  It's a great base to do what you like with it, or to eat as-is.

This recipe calls for far too much pepper. Between the steak seasoning and the pepper, this ended up tasting like pepper soup! Next time i'll omit the extra pepper, so I can actually taste the other ingredients

The soup was extremely savory and my diners loved it. I did add garlic, more broth (enough to cover the potato, celery, carrot mixture), red chili powder, and more salt and black pepper. I also blended half of my potato mixture in a blender and mixed in the rest which created a wonderfully creamy texture with chunks of vegetables. Also used sharp chedder and added corn. This recipe is a perfect base recipe to get you started; add what you want. The I'll be using and tweaking this recipe for a long time to come.

Excellent and easy recipe... I made exactly as described but, added more celery in place of the carrot I didn't have. Also, decided to not mash and I just originally diced the tatties. I also added the broth and milk in equal proportions. 2 and half cups of each. Brilliant... will definately make again!

After my first taste I re-read the recipe to make sure I hadn't forgotten to add an ingredient (or 12) because this had so little flavor.  We added cajun seasoning (me) and seasoned salt (husband) which helped.  I feel bad for my husband -- I'm traveling so he has to eat the leftovers!

What a delicious thick soup! I substituted fresh chopped spinach and mushrooms (thank you salad bar!) for the celery and carrots and I left out the parsely. It came out beautifully... and I am picky about soups. Many more than six servings, however. Probably closer to 10-12. I will make this many times again!

Yes - I will be making this again and again and again!! I did tweak it a bit.  We had no celery and I used yellow american instead and it was delicious. Great with a good italian bread and don't be afraid to add (many) more potatoes either.

Great recipe! We didn't have any Swiss cheese, so used a mixture of Red Leicster and Mozarella and it was delicious. Also added a dash of garlic powder for a little kick. Really nice, thick soup for a cold winter night.

This was very good.  I actually just put it in my slow cooker so that I could get other things done and not worry about it. Once it started boiling I just turned it down to low, mashed slightly (like the directions stated), added the milk and other ingredients and came back to it later when I was ready to serve it.  The only thing I will change, is the amount of pepper.  I love pepper, but it seemed a little spicy.  So next time I'll just half the amount and then add according to my liking.

This was pretty good.  I used a mix of Jarlsberg and Cheddar.  I might try it with Gruyere.  The cheese seemed pretty mild, and all that really came through was the vegetable stock.  I think I prefer other potato soup recipes I've found, in general.  This just seemed kind of boring.

A very good soup recipe.  It turned out much like Grandma's home made potatoe soup, but this was better, especially with the addition of the swiss cheese!  Although, and I guess this is a personal taste, I thought the recipe called for way too much pepper.  Even being the pepper lover I am, I thought that it was way to peppery.  But other than that, a great dish!

A very satisfying and creamy soup.  The cheese gives the potatos the extra something that potato soup usually needs without adding any strong flavors.

My whole family agreed this recipe was a keeper (even my finicky 8 year old).  I think I will use a little less pepper next time, tho.  We loved it.  Thanks, Marilyn!
