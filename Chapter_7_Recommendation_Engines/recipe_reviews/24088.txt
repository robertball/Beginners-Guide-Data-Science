Easy version of buffalo wings.  I was looking for a version that did not involve deep frying the wings, and this was a good adaptation.  The final product was excellent.

My only qualm is that it took much longer than 40-45 minutes to cook the wings at 350 to the point where they were well-browned and the skin was crispy.  Next time I will bake them in a 400-degree oven.

Delicious! I cooked at 450 degrees at the time specified and they came out perfectly - brown and crispy. Thanks for the recipe!

I love how fast this cooks up.  I use the hot sauce recipe noted and I also use a sweet sauce of brown sugar, honey, lemon, and butter for the family members (girls) that prefer sweet to hot!  Thanks Christine!

great recipe.  i followed other viewers ideas... added bread crumbs to flour, baked at higher temp, used more hot sauce and doubled the amount of sauce  used.  Also added extra seasoning to the flour mixture.  Our local fave restaurant uses ranch dressing instead of blue cheese, so I tried that.... very yum.  one more thing.... parchment paper in the bottom of the pan helps the wings get even crispier!

Delicious and so easy!! We will make these all the time now. Definitely increase the oven temp to 400. I'm lazy and like to cook the whole wing instead of separating it into two pieces. Cook for 20 minutes one side and then 15 minutes or so for the other side. Also, as suggested in other reviews, add bread crumbs for a crispier texture.

My family liked this recipe very much.  I added honey to the sauce for a slightly sweeter taste. It took a longer to cook than stated.  I will fix this again.

I gave this recipe 5 stars because I love the sauce! I did have to double it but the flavor was fabulous! Instead of flour next time i'm gonna try some breadcrumbs just to see if that will crisp them up a bit more.

This recipe was good.  I seasoned the chicken wings with garlic powder and black pepper before coating them with flour.  I took the advice of other viewers and doubled the sauce.  I added some garlic powder and 2 Tbsp of ketsup to the sauce and simmered it for a few minutes before pouring it over the chicken.

These were FANTASTIC! I used chicken thighs instead of wings, dredged them in a combination of 1/3 c breadcrumbs & 1/4 c flour and baked them at 350* for 30 minutes on each side and they came out PERFECT! Loved the hot sauce - I used Tabasco and the whole family thought the combination of butter,vinegar, hot sauce & salt was unbeatable. I did make extra hot sauce (1 T butter, 3 T vinegar, 3 T Tabasco, and 1/4 t salt) and put the extra sauce on the table so we could dip our chicken pieces in it...A definite keeper of a recipe! Can't wait for football season or a reason to entertain - these are definitely going to be a mainstay in my kitchen!!

These were great and so easy to make.  I defrosted them and mixed up all the ingrediants and baked them in my confection toaster oven for the full 45 minutes.  Really, really good.

I left my wings whole and broke them up after cooking.  Raised the oven temp to 400 as suggested by previous reviewers.  The wings were SUPER crispy and the sauce was awesome!  I substituted red wine vinegar and added garlic powder.  Fantastic!

This is a good recipe but has one serious flaw, the cooking time is NOT LONG enough and undercooked chicken is to be avoided at all costs. I baked these at 350 for 25 minutes, then turned and baked at 425 for about 30 minutes more. There is no way they would've been done following the instructions precisely. Otherwise, flavor was good, recipe was easy, and I love baking instead of frying wings because it's much better for you. I'd use this recipe again. Oh, and I used 3 Tablespoons of hot sauce, because I misread the directions, and that actually worked out better. And omitted the salt.

These wings were perfect for Friday wing night! I loved the crunch of the skin (I loathe slimy chicken skin). I coated 1/2 the wings in a bottled wing sauce and the other in BBQ sauce. I completed the dish with french fries, celery, and ranch dressing. 
Everyone is looking forward to the next wing night!

Well, I cheated and used bottled hot chicken wing sauce, and took them on a camping trip, and everyone LOVED them! Pretty darn easy recipe, and will definitely make again!

These had no flavor whatsoever.I used Frank's Red Hot Sauce. I had even doubled the sauce part since it seemed pretty skimpy just by reading it. We added quite a bit more sauce at the table too and it didn't help. Definitely next time I'm using a recipe that calls for a marinade for the chicken first to get the flavor into the meat itself as my husband suggested and then grill them. Sorry, we just weren't impressed.

We made these for super bowl last night and they were great. We had always marinated then grilled wings but these turned out crispy and delicious. For the sauce I just mixed hot sauce, cumin, chilli powder, soy sauce and a touch of red wine vinegar. The sauce was spicy and delicious.

Very good sauce, cooked at 400 for a little longer and add sweet and sour sauce.  Perfect temp on hot sauce if you like it a bit spicy

Easy recipe.  I like a little more crisp with my wings. i also felt that wasting the excess flour is not necessary.  I used remaining drippings to help make a better sauce

This recipe was a great start! I had never made buffalo wings, and my fiance RAVED and practically ate them all.
I did make a few changes like others had suggested:
-I mixed flour and bread crumbs
-I tripled the amount of hot sauce, and added an extra 3/4 tablespoon or so (by eye). Next time I might add a bit of BW for stickiness and sweetness.
-I cooked at 450 (20 mins each side)
One suggestion - buy the wings cut up. Cutting them up was tough and took up a lot of time. That's my fault though.
This is going in my box of printed recipes :)

Totally Kickin!  These are great.  Only complaint is that more sauce is needed to coat the wings.  Other than that they are AWESOME! Oh, if you like the heat, jack up the amount of hot pepper sauce!  Enjoy!

Not bad, eacy & somewhat quick way to make homemade chicken wings, healthier alternative to deep frying.
I added less vinegar, more hot sauce & addtl flavors(chilli powder, garlic,pepper, honey, and a splash of soy sauce).

These were good, my family like them.  There were on the spicy side, so you need to like spicy.  I also added honey for a bit of a sweet taste.  Turned out great.

I'm sorry, but these wings were not good.  The sauce was so vinegary that I had to add more hot sauce to make them edible.

Great alternative to higher fat, fried wings. I make mine exactly the same except I do not use butter on the baking sheet but instead use parchment or non stick foil to avoid the wings sticking. I also flour the wings and let them hang out in the fridge for at least an hour so the coating can adhere. I found baking at 400 (instead of 350) for approx 45-50 min, depending on the size of the wings and also flipping halfway through, they come out fairly crisp this way, very closed to the fried variety. Toss with sauce and good to go. You can also pop them back in the oven or under the broiler after saucing for extra crispiness and baked in sauce flavor.

excellent wing recipe...I baked them at 425 for the specified time!  Great because they are not deep fried..  I alos shook them in Southern Fried Shake and Bake instead of flour then tossed in hot sauce and put back in oven for last 5 mins...boyfriend loved them better than going to the pub!

These wings were just so-so.  I followed the recipe exactly.  They didn't get crisp the way we like them.  I upped the temperature to 375 degrees F when I turned them over.  So I only gave these a 3 Star.

5 stars from hubby!  I prepared the chicken and he baked them and did the sauce all by himself!  (So thats 5 stars for me!!)  Anyways, he liked these way more than the oil fried recipe I tried last week.  I will be making these again for "guys night."

very good, I like the fact that they are baked and not fried!!! I do use more hot pepper sauce than the recipe calls for- specifically Frank's red hot, with a dash of the vinegar and that's really all they need!!! Great!!

I was really disappointed with the way these turned out.  I took these to a family party where everyone loves spicy food and it was actually embarrassing how mild these were (even to me, and I am really wimpy).  Not only were they not spicy enough, they were quite bland and kind of greasy.  I also made the Glazed chicken wings off this website (honey, soy & bbq) and they were a much bigger hit, they were all eaten up!

I leave the tips on, mmm, bake at 450 and use blue cheese instead of vinegar in the sauce. My husband and I love these crisp wings, we make them every few weeks. Thanks!

These wings did not get crispy in the oven. 350 degrees is just not hot enough to crisp up the skin, especially if it's dredged in flour and sitting in a puddle of melted butter. There simply was not enough sauce, per the recipe. It needed to be tripled, at least.  The sauce was tasty, but a bit too vinegary.  Could have used more hot sauce, I think.  Not the best flavor.  Overall, these wings were a huge disappointment.

I would give this 4.5 stars. I modified a little. First, I cooked the chicken in the first step only 15 minutes. Second, I added about three times the hot sauce (personal taste, and it depends on the type of hot sauce). Third, instead of tossing the cooked wings in the sauce, I braised them in the sauce in about a cup of beer on medium high heat for ten minutes. They did not end up crispy but they were tasty and we loved them!

I used chicken legs in place of wings. This had flavor but not nearly as much as I expected. I probably won't be making this again but thanks anyway.

I made some but w/ olive oil only, baked them, & then coated them w/ Buffalo Wing Sauce. They came out pretty good, but since I only cook for myself, I'll stick to ordering them out.

These were ok...too much breading for my taste and it wasn't hot enough.
