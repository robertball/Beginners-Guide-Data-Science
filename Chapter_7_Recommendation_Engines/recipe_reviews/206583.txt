It's not often I'm this impressed with a recipe, especially one I had only average expectations for. This proves not to underestimate the potential of simple and humble dishes. In this case, since hubs detests feta, I took the submitter's suggestion to use smoked gouda and I'm telling you, these little tomato gems were outstandingly delicious. I mixed these together exactly as directed, using fresh tomatoes and herbs from my garden (that could be part of the reason these were so good) and let them set a bit before roasting while I prepared the rest of dinner. Everything was perfect, from the amounts of ingredients to the cooking time. These were a bigger hit than the main course! With more tomatoes on the vine, and gouda in the fridge these will be making an encore appearance real soon!

Made this exactly as is and it was wonderful!  They looked very impressive and tasted great.  Will try to experiment with different cheese.

These were very good. Next time I will slice them rather than halving them though, it made them very difficult to eat.

Super yummy way to make some leftover tomatoes!  My husband generally doesn't even care for tomatoes, but he ate a few of these!

Loved these.  I used campari tomatoes, as that's what I had on hand.  Also used smoked gouda cheese instead of the feta.  Next time I will cut back a little bit on the garlic (at hubby's suggestion).  The kids even liked them.  Thanks for the recipe!

I halved the recipe, but pretty much made it as written otherwise.  Delicious!  I'll definitely make these again.

So good! I used smoked gouda and dried spices instead of fresh since it's what I had on hand. For 4 romas, I just put a light sprinkling of everything called for, including garlic powder instead of chopped garlic. All just small tweaks, and I cooked the tomatoes for about 11 mins instead of 15 since my oven runs a little hot. Very yummy recipe, I highly recommend it! **Update: I've made this with other non-roma tomatoes (cut into smaller than half slices) and any smokey cheese and it's still wonderful. This is a great recipe.

A most excellent recipe.  In a small glass bowl with extra virgin olive oil, I added dried basil, dried oregano, dried dill weed, garlic powder, crushed red pepper, salt, and pepper.  I tossed and coated the Roma tomato halves in the oil and herb mixture.  Baked at 375 degrees F. for 20 minutes.  Then sprinkled on some Feta cheese and returned the tomatoes to the oven for an additional 10 minutes.  Man!  This so, so, so very good.  I'm licking my lips for more, I tell you.  This recipe earned me the coveted Stamp of Approval (SOA) from Mi Gato Loco.

I had farm fresh grape tomatoes, so I made a "mini" version. These were super delicious and using the smaller tomatoes would made them a great addition to an appetizer menu. My feta was a little crispy around the edges and perfectly delicious!

Very good!  I love roasted tomatoes so much!  The freshness from the herbs was perfect with the tomatoes and I loved the feta!  Thanks!

I made this recipe and didnâ€™t substitute anything. After the tomatoes were done, I let them cool a bit and then put them in my blender and made a nice tomato sauce for pasta. I highly recommend you try this. My family was pleasantly surprised with the outcome!!

I liked them, but I am not sure if I made them correctly, I mixed the solution with the tomatos, but I think if I would have scooped the mixture into the tomatos it would be better.

I found cooking  15 minutes too long ... the tomatoes were over cooked.... filling was delish, but had to spread each one on a slice of toasted sourdough toast for taste satisfaction.

This was a very tasty tomato dish. I used mozzarella because that is what I had on hand.  I also used dried herbs but will try with fresh another time.  I will definitely be making these again.  Another reviewer suggested that you might scoop the filling inside the tomatoes.  I did this but next time I will just brush the tomatoes with olive oil and mix herbs and cheeses and stuff tomatoes with that.  This is a great recipe if you want pizza or pasta flavor without all the calories.

Flavorful and delicious!  Followed the recipe except for feta, as I did not have any.  Substituted with mozzerella.  Easy to make too!

I chopped my tomatoes instead of halving them and used crumbled goat cheese instead of feta. I also added crushed rosemary and some chopped onion to mine. I took the same herbs and coated a pork loin with them and cooked that for 35 minutes before adding the tomato mixture for another 15 minutes at 425 degrees. It was excellent!

Yum! I didn't have oregano and pepper on hand, but it was still delicious! I also had to use goat cheese instead of feta, cuz I had it available. I'll be making this all summer. I put it on top of some toasted bread and it was like little mini delicious pizzas :)

I omitted the basil, parsley and oregano from this recipe since my husband hates having "leaves in his food", as he says and this recipe still tasted wonderful.
