I work at a Japanese restaurant, and with very little tweaking this recipe tasted exactly the same!!  I used less onion than called for, and I used fresh shiitake mushrooms.  I also cubed the chicken instead of cutting it into strips, just personal preference.  Also, I substituted 1 Tbsp mirin for soy in the sauce, and I added a pat of butter to the sauce (a trick I learned from the cooks where I work) and it was delicious!  Also needed to cover the pan while the eggs were cooking, so the sauce did not evaporate too much.

Having lived in Hawaii and Okinawa,Japan, I was thrilled to find this recipe and couldn't wait to try it. It seemed too easy to make but once made, was right on the mark in flavor and authenticity. My kids were thrilled to be able to get oyako at home once again. Super , super recipe! Mahalo Kay!

Suggestion: You can replace the chicken breast with chicken katsu and make it a chicken katsu donburi!! I also added 3-4 tbls of mirin in it. And for a twist, replace the green onion with cilantro gives  it a even more refreshing taste! Also instead of chicken broth, I used water and bonito powder for the broth. Regular white mushroom also works great in it if you don't have shitake in hand.

This was just as good as the dish that usually costs me $10 at my favorite Japanese place!  I would recommend slicing the chicken into thin strips and marinating it in about 1 Tbs cornstarch, 1 Tbs soy sauce, and 1 Tbs sesame oil (all approximations...) at least 30 minutes prior to cooking.  This adds flavor and makes the chicken more tender.    Instead of simmering the egg, I tried cracking an egg over each bowl of hot rice like they do in the restaurants.  But I think you need a special clay pot to make that work, because my egg never cooked and I ended up microwaving my bowl in fears of salmonella...yeah....not ideal.  So follow the directions for simmering the egg in the recipe :).

AI!!  Thank you so much for this amazing dish!! I can die happy now.

By the way, it certainly tastes better when its Shitake mushrooms and Kikkoman soy sauce. The first time I made this dish I only had canned mushrooms (I don't even know what kind they were...) and La Choy soy sauce... I WILL NEVER DO THAT AGAIN!! Sacrilege, really...

This is fast, easy, AND delicious.  I added about a tablespoon more soy sauce. It's the closest thing I've found to the oyako don served at local Japanese restaurants.  Really, really good!

It was delicious! I used some straight noodles in the dish instead of serving on rice. I put in three large carrots and used the white parts of the green onion instead of the "half onion". I marinaded the chicken in soy sauce, chili garlic sauce, and drops of sesame oil and fish sauce.

This is a great dish to prepare if you like Oriental food, the sauce is perfect and great over rice.  I also like how the eggs hold everything together while letting the sauce penetrate into the rice.  Overall a 4.5/5, only because it does take some time to make, but is definately worth it.

Wow!  Super yummy!  I'm from Hawaii and definitely restaurant quality.   After reading the reviews, I added 1 tbsp mirin, 3 tbsp soy sauce, and a pat of butter.  I marinated the chicken in 1 tsp cornstarch, soy sauce, and sesame oil for about 20 mins to help keep it moist and tasty.  I also used 3 jumbo eggs and it was perfect.  Next time, I will add 1-2 cups more chicken broth.  Cover while the eggs are simmering!  Great recipe, Mahalo!

AMAZING! I made this for an anime night at our house, and I got rave reviews. ^_^ My only change to the recipe were to add 1 TBSP mirin. It was so good! Domo arigato gozaimasu!

this was great.  It reminded me of moms oyako dons from when I was a child.  I added some sliced bamboo shoots to add a crunchy texture to it.

With no prior knowledge of what oyako donburi tastes like, I decided to make this recipe. I made it a couple of times and it tasted good enough. I finally had oyako donburi in Japantown in SF last month and it is spot on! I was pleasantly surprised. Highly recommended.

This is very good! When I first read that it uses 5 eggs, I was very hesitant and was seriously considering reducing it to 3. But I stuck with the recipe and am glad that I did. Turned out very tasty and very Japanese!

This was so easy and fast its sure to be a new staple in my home. The flavor was amazing and its easy to see why its called a comfort food. Next time though, ill be sure to use fresh mushrooms (or soak them longer) and Ill probably use less sugar to make it healthier. Also, I just let the chicken cook a little while I prepped the veggies, then shredded it with my fingers. Saved the raw chicken/cutting board mess, but no big deal.

Delicious! The only change I made (that I wish I didn't have to) was I switched the shittake mushrooms for just plain old canned mushrooms, as I couldn't find the shittake in our local grocery. Still good!

This was very good!  I also decreased the eggs.  I made it for 8 servings and used six eggs.  I also added sliced button mushrooms.  Thanks for a terrific and authentic tasting recipe.

I grew up with this food, but we didn't cook this dish at home so I was happy to find such a great recipe for it.  We absolutely loved the flavors. I reduced the eggs from 5 to 3 (personal preference) and used boneless skinless thighs instead of the chicken breasts. The shitake mushrooms really make this dish. Thanks, Kay!

I was impressed how simple it was to follow this recipe!  In Hawaii, there is a very big asian influence and Japanese food is regularly eaten here.  I must admit that this recipe tastes just like it does in a Japanese restaurant!  Good job!

Really nice. At first I doubted if there weren't too many eggs but it was just fine. Maybe a little too much sugar for my taste, next time I'm going to try with only one tablespoon. Definitely recommend it though!

All three men in the house (two of which are 6 and 8) enjoyed this.   It only made enough for the three of them.  There were no raves about how good it was and my husband even added some ginger sauce to his....  hence the 4 stars.  Good...but not great.  (I did not add mushrooms as my husband hates them.)

Excellent!  One of my favorite dishes at our local Hawaiian and Japanese places, although one of them stopped serving it.    Only changes I made were I used 1/2 of the sugar called for and substituted 1T of Mirin for 1T of soy sauce.  I omitted carrots b/c I don't like them in this dish, used white mushrooms 'cuz I had them, added bean sprouts 'cuz I love them and next time will add celery.    5 eggs were perfect, use them all.  Did take the advise to cover the pan for awhile to let the eggs cook, but took it off for a few minutes at the end to let some liquid evaporate.  Thanks so much for this recipe it's a keeper and one I will make again and again.

Oishii! My Japanese boyfriend devoured this, making yummy noises throughout.  Alterations: I halved the recipe, only used 2 eggs, and four shiitake mushrooms instead of three (we both love them) and thighs instead of breats, but only about 2/3 of what was called for, not big meat eaters.  I ended up not having any fat to drain, but in bigger quantities I can see how this would be a problem.  I had to use about 1/4 cup more chicken broth, and then another 1/4 cup water to give it an soupiness at all, which is what I was after.  I will make this again, it is so easy! Oh, I also used 1/2 T of mirin in place of 1/2 T of the soy sauce.

The first time I made this for my Japanese class I followed the recipe except for a change that my Japanese professor said I should do.  She said to remove the sugar and use Mirin instead splitting the Mirin with the amount of soy sauce called for.  So 2 T Soy and 2 T Mirin.  She also said she doesn't use carrots but that was just a preference thing for her, I still used the carrots when I made it.  The second time I made it I followed the recipe so I could write a fair review and it was not as good as it was the first time.  It was much too sweet and the egg cooked differently in it the second time.  I think I will stick with making this with the 50/50 split of Mirin and Soy and also with the suggested marinade from another reviewer of 1T each Soy,Cornstarch, and Sesame Oil for a minimum of 30 minutes.

I tweaked it a little: less sugar, did Asian noodles and did hard boiled eggs on the side so each person can add if they wanted egg. was delish.

Super delicious.  Made some changes to it.  Used about 5 tbsp soy sauce, 3 tbsp mirin, and one tbsp sugar as suggested by another reviewer.  Also add bamboo shoots if i have.   

But this is what puts it over the top.  Instead of chicken stock I make simple dashi using nobu's recipe -  Konbu in pot of water, med heat, just before it boils take out konbu, remove from heat, and add bonito flakes.  Drain.  

Then I soak dried shiitakes in warm water, then save the water and pour that (about a cup) into the pan as well.  Sometimes it tends to evaporate so ill throw in a little chicken stock, or just cover it.  

My parents are vegetarian, so I'll make theirs with tofu and extra mushrooms - shiitake, regular, and enoki.

I love Okyakodon so I was excited to make it at home for the first time.  I omitted mushrooms and the carrot, since when I order it around here it doesn't have these ingredients.  I also added 1 tbsp of mirin per other reviews.  Everything turned out great and was delicious over sticky rice.

Very good, I've made it several times. However, I prefer to use boneless chicken thighs, which usually need no additional chicken broth.

My family thought this was great.  I used fresh instead of dried shiitake mushrooms.  I used 4 eggs because that was all I had.  The directions should be rewritten to include more steps and to specify whether or not the pan is covered or uncovered.

I just made this recipe and loved it at first.  My Mom said it was too salty.  I thought the eggs were the only part of the dish that was too salty.  Other than that, I love the recipe.  I might omit the salt and maybe use low sodium chicken broth next time.

Probably an okay recipe but I doubled it for my family and it seemed too eggy.  I have made a beef donburi that didn't call for egg and I enjoyed that more.  But I'm a beef person so that could be it.  Very comfort food though.

I'm on weight watchers so decided to reduce the sugar by half, used half a pound of chicken and only 4 eggs  to get the points down (5 sp per serving).   It was delicious!   I served it over  cup of brown rice (6sp).   I love this and think it will be a weekly treat from now on.

Tried it yesterday and it was a real hit! The kids loved it and so did everyone else. Only change....because the soy sauce I had on hand was saltier than most I only used 2 tbsp and substituted the other 2 tbsp with bonito soup base. I was amazed how fast it was to make it. Would definitely make again and again.

This is a favorite dish in our family.  In addition to making it with the chicken, we also make it using a spicy ahi. Everyone loves that.  It's easy to make, and very flavorful!

Yum! This recipe is easy and delicious. I omit the 1/2 tp salt because it doesn't need it with all the soy sauce. My husband loved it too.

Maybe I didn't make this correct but I think it had too much egg, I'd lower the amount of egg by half and add more broth. The shiitake mushrooms were the best part!

While ours looked less than apptizing, it was good, I thought it was a bit sweet, everyone else thought it was salty. Our mushroom were tinned and had an odd texture, and I used corn instead of green onion. I definantly think my parents will allow it to be made again , specially since it isn't expensive.

Tastes good, but can't get past the soy sauce covered (brown) eggs.  Leftovers are a no go on this dish.

DH loved this and requested it be put into weekly rotation. I haven't had it anywhere but the version I made from this recipe. Now I want to try it at a restaurant! Will definitely make again & again!

This was a favorite dish of mine at a restaurant that unfortunately closed down. I could not find this in any restaurant after that. I have been looking for this recipe for 7+ years! The other recipes/variations do not even come close to this one. I can just hug you right now. Thank you so much for posting.  I had some thigh meat in the freezer and used it instead of breast meat and it turned out fabulous.  Thanks again!

This was tasty but the chicken I used just didn't taste right for some reason. Served with regular rice, "Japanese-Style Sesame Green Beans" and "Japanese Zucchini and Onions."

This was great, I can't wait to make it again!! I did have to add another cup of broth to make it soup like...I also didn't have mushrooms, but next time I'll be sure to get some! My 4 and 5 yr olds even gobbled this up.

After cooking alot of the liquid evaporated and I added an extra cup of broth towards the end. This was big enough for 2 hearty servings and so I only ended up using one egg. Overall, it was a completely new taste to me but I really enjoyed it and will most certainly make again!

I always feel ripped off when I order this at a Japanese restaurant for $8. (It's just rice, eggs, and chicken, c'mon!) So, I'm really glad I found this great recipe!  I loved the flavors, aroma, and COLORS of the dish!  Definitely serve with Japanese rice (Kokuho Rose brand is best), if possible.  The shitake mushrooms and fine chopped green onions were my favorite part.

This is delicious. I made it for the first time last night with a few changes - added a dash of sesame oil, some toasted sesame seeds, and only used 4 eggs. Will definitely make this again. My boyfriend loved it!

Oh my goodness! So good! So easy! And cheap for the amount it makes! I'd suggest using less soy sauce your first time making it, as well as less egg. Vegetables are also good too.

We have made many recipes from allrecipes and this is definitely one of the best so far.  We had never had Oyako Donburi before however we will be having this again.  Very good.

I first had this at a restaurant here in Phoenix, and I was delighted to find it on Allrecipes! I change my recipe a bit, but only in that I use a whole bag of frozen stir-fry veggies, and add an egg or two. It feeds my whole family, and they LOVE it! Edited to add- I add a dash of sesame oil, and it gives a wonderful boost to the flavor of the dish!

Yummy! Tweaked the recipe a bit by decreasing mushrooms to 3 and eggs to 3.

This does taste just like the Oyako Donburi at the Japanese restaurant.  I could eat it everyday.

I halfed the recipe but I think it came out fine. I put a lot more vegetables that said was needed & I think they made it better. Tasted just like the ones in the restaraunts. I also used low sodium soy sauce & low sodium chicken broth b/c the dried mushrooms already add lots of salt to the dish.
