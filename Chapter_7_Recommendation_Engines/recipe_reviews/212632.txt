This was wonderful!  So easy to prepare and fairly healthy!  The ingredients were things I usually have on-hand and this made a nice, elegant sauce that I would happily serve to guests!  Hubby said he would definitely order it again from a restaurant!  :-)  Even the kids ate it, the flavor was light enough.  I also cooked it for 5 hours on HIGH setting and it was very tender.  I made this over egg noodles and the chicken breasts fell apart while cooking so it was more of a sauce over noodles with chunks of chicken.  Delicious!

Decent - I found it was a little runny, so I added a brick of reduced-fat cream cheese.  Much creamier than what I think the recipe intended...but yummier.

This dish was incredible! The only changes I made were I used Chardonnay instead of Chablis, and I used low fat, low sodium soup. It tasted great and was super creamy. We will definitely make this again!

I really enjoyed this recipe! I used the High setting and the chicken turned out so tender, we didn't even need knives to cut it! The artichokes and kalamatas gave it a really nice flavor. It was great served over rice; we will definitely have this again!

I made this without the cream of chicken soup (sorry, Campbell's) and added some chicken stock to the wine to make sure there was enough liquid to cook.  After cooking, I added some goat cheese and cream for the creaminess.  It was pretty tasty that way, but next time I'll drain off some of the liquid first to make a thicker sauce.  Because it does turn brown after cooking as some people have said -- doesn't really look like the sauce in the picture -- I think next time I'll also add a can of diced fire-roasted tomatoes with the cream and goat cheese at the end, that would add more veggies and make for a more attractive color.

I loved this recipe, it was so easy to do and something different for my crock-pot than a pot roast! I made it as is, except I added mushrooms instead of capers (don't like them).  I served it with orzo sprinkled with parmesan cheese. My husband and I really liked this, and my 2 1/2 year old actually ate it too! Definitely a keeper.

This is my favorite dish at a restaurant that is not close to my house.  I have been on a quest to find the recipe.  I should have known that allrecipes.com would have it.  It turned out perfect!  The next time, I'll pound out the meat like the restaurant does.  Otherwise, I wouldn't change a thing!  Thanks allrecipes.com!

It's got a good flavor. I changed it up because I was in a hurry and I was short on ingredients. I substituted one can of cream of chicken soup for a creamy portabello soup. I spiced it up a bit with a dash of sundried tomato salad dressing. I added 5 cloves of garlic. I had to grill the chicken instead of doing a slow cook. I added some spinach for color.

From the title, I expected a sauce that tasted like Sun Dried Tomatoes, but instead, I was treated to a sauce heavily flavored with brine. The Combination of Kalamata olives, and canned artichoke hearts was overpowering, to say the least. I used the chicken broth instead of the white wine, as suggested, and I'm glad I did. If you ENJOY the pickled taste of canned artichoke hearts, and you enjoy the briny taste of Kalmata olives, then you will love this recipe. If you find either of those tastes distasteful, then this is not the recipe for you. They overpower the sun-dried tomatoes till the only thing they are good for is a splash of color.

I made this for Valentines day dinner and it was a big hit.  For starters I didn't make in the croc pot nor did I use soup.  I grilled 2 chicken breasts and seasoned with mccormic perfect pinch mediteranian seasoning.  I cooled them and chopped.  Used small container heavy cream and cooking wine for sauce.  Added everthing else as directed to pan on stove top.  Simmered 20 minutes and served over whole wheat rotini.  I did leave out capers because I couldn't find any in my local grocery store.  I rinsed the olives and artichokes before chopping and adding.  Very good the hubby loved this.

So yummy!  (I didn't use olives b/c I don't like them, but tossed in a little olive oil for flavor.)  The dish color was exactly as pictured.  Mysteriously, the sauce was like a restaurant-quality lemon-caper-wine sauce.  We went nuts for this recipe.

Delicious! But next time I might wait until half-way thru to add the tomatoes as they were too mushy for my taste.. Also, I will add more olives. It did get rave reviews with my husband, so we will be trying this one again!

Really yummy and nice for guests! Used Chicken soup, cooking sherry, and marinated artichokes. I will not use the sherry next time if using the marinated artichokes because I found it had too much of a "vinegary" taste that covered up the sundried tomatoes. Put fresh parmasan cheese on the top, served with mashed potatoes. Got rave reviews!

Fair. It was an unapplealing dish to look at. I make a similar dish in a skillet that turns out very colorful and only takes 15 minutes. Will not fix again.

I've made this several times.  It's part of our rotation.  
Changes?  I don't like cream of chicken soup so I use cream of mushroom (sometimes homemade) but do have to add a few herbs to make up for the lack from the soup.  I also don't like olives.  I just leave them out.  Oh and I use chicken thighs - only because my family likes them better.
As to others that have rated this very poorly ("Too salty" "Too briny")  Don't use artichokes from a can - use either frozen or jarred packed in water.  Olives are very briny - choose some milder ones.  Don't like the wine?  Leave it out.

Delicious!  I was going to an italian-style potluck and wanted to bring something other than the expected ziti.  This got many compliments!  I didn't have white-wine, so I substitued with 4 oz cream cheese and 1/4 cup italian dressing.  And I also did not have the capers.  I used a whole box of noodles and 2 cooked half chicken breasts shredded. I mixed it all together, sprinkled the top with parmesan cheese, and baked it in a covered 9x13 dish at 350 for 45 minutes.   I will definitely make it again!

I followed this recipe exactly and despite what some of the other review say this did make a thick creamy sauce. But I was not impressed with the over all taste. The chicken was very dry (even though I used my usual organic chicken) and something about the flavoring just did not seem to work well together.  I served with gnocchi.  I will not be using this recipe again.

I tried this and we loved it, BUT my boyfriend takes so much allergy medication that his taste buds are a little insensitive. Has anyone tried it with the addition of garlic? or maybe lemon juice (or is that a no-no with the cream soup?)? Also, I used sun-dried tomatoes not packed in oil (boiled them first, of course) but wondered if others had had better results with the oil-packed variety

Ok, this was awful. A bit salty for my taste, and sort of a strange texture. The different flavors in this dish were at war with one another.

This was a great crock-pot meal- easy and delicious! I think I over cooked it, but since I usually leave for a full 7 hours, I would change a few things: I would skip the artichokes, they got too soft and the texture was slimy. I would also use only one can of condensed soup and use both broth and wine. Next, I would add the capers and olives a halfway through or an hour before complete- I didn't get the burst of flavor that I enjoy with these ingredients. I used rosemary instead of basil- still turned out great- I think either would work. I served over rice, and that made the broth just perfect! Definitely a great base recipe, just needs a little timing adjustment to fit with my schedule better- I will definitely make this again!

I did the faster cooking method of putting my cooker on high for 4 hours. With the amount of negative reviews about the taste, I added a dollop of cream cheese just at the end of the cooking. I served it over couscous and I got rave reviews....however, I think I will experiment the next time and use chicken thighs with cream of mushroom, fresh mushrooms, sun dried tomatoes and peas (omitting the capers and olives). I will have completely changed the taste and the original recipe, but hey....that's the fun with cooking!

I followed the recipe exactly, with the addition of a 1/4 tsp of pepper. It was good, and filling, and made a lot... but I was not wowed by the flavor. The tomato flavor got lost in everything else. I was also hoping for more flavor, but with the lack of spices there was not a lot there. But I feel like this dish has a lot of potential!

When I retry this recipe, I plan to make a few changes. I want to marinate the chicken in Italian marinade. I want to add a can of diced tomatoes with Italian seasoning to give me more tomato flavor and add some more veggies to this meat heavy dish. I will probably double the dried tomatoes as well. Adding some cumin may pump up the flavor profile a bit.

Meh. I didn't add the capers or artichokes, as I didn't have them on hand. And my slow cooker only has a high setting, so I let it cook for 4 hrs. Unfortunately that was too long! The chicken was dry, dry, dry even though there was plenty of sauce covering it. The sauce smelled amazing, but sadly there wasn't much flavor there - maybe that's where the capers/artichokes would come in handy. Overall, I was disappointed.

Hardly knew how to rate this so I split it in the middle and rated 3 stars because of the other ingredients listed and how easy it was to prepare. Sorry Campbell's, I didn't use your soup. I devised my own sauce using cream cheese, some of the juice from the capers, the wine, a little chicken broth and milk.  I threw in some mixed herbs and it turned out delicious!!!  I then added the capers, etc. according to recipe except for the olives...not a fan of them.  Poured this mixture over the chicken and cooked on low.  Loved the infusion of flavors!

We didn't care for it.  It sounded great on paper but it was lacking in taste.  It's missing something. Followed the recipe exactly.

This was absolutely scrumptious!! I substituted the artichokes for marinated mushrooms and it was just delicious. Putting in the slow cooker was also a great idea. I was able to do some baking while that was cooking away. Thank you.

This recipe was OK. I gave 4 stars because I thought the sauce had too much wine in it. Perhaps if the amount of wine is reduced or maybe it was the wine I selected: Sauvignon Blanc by Bare Foot (California). I couldn't find the wine listed in the recipe but someone recommend me this wine for cooking white sauces.

meh.  it didn't turn out as i would expect, but it wasnt bad.  my husband doesn't like the olives in there, and though i like the flavor of olives, i don't think i'll be putting them in next time.  better served on the side in my opinion.  i served on a mix of 1/2 instant potatoes and 1/2 real mashed potatoes and will do that next time.

My husband and kids love this recipe. I omit the artichokes and olives since nobody likes that. I add in 1/2 tsp of Cayenne pepper and a 9oz jar of sund dried tomato pesto. I Have even thrown in a jar of roasted red peppers. I serve it over elbow or rotini pasta. This is such and easy recipe to throw together and it tastes really great!

Very good recipe but a little rich for my taste. It could be because i only used half of the chicken that the recipe called for and didn't cut back on anything else. I may try to cut back on some of the soup next time.

Excellent!!!  I can't wait to make it again.  It went over so well with my family.  It's makes quite a bit for just my husband and I so we shared with my mom. She loved it as well.  Still left overs for the next day.  There is nothing about this recipe that needs changing.

I agree with some of the other posters; the sauce had an odd taste to it. Next time I make this, I will use canned or fresh diced tomatoes. The chicken was good, and the sauce was hearty and creamy, but a little bland, too.

It was okay but not special.  I tried several variations as recommended - added mushrooms & spinach, made homemade cream of chicken soup, added italian herbs to the base.  Even added some cream cheese to thicken at the end.  really just bland.  I definitely would add salt, pepper and parmesan cheese if I make again.

Instead of using canned soup I made 2 cups of white sauce flavoured with Italian herbs.  I used boneless skinless chicken thighs. It was delicious.

Sun dried tomatoes, artichokes, capers...yum. This sounded like a terrific combination with chicken. But I don't like "cream of" soups. So I substituted 2-1/2 cups of chicken broth for the soup and otherwise followed the instructions as written. Aft the cooking was done, I removed the chicken and shredded it - which was easy to do since it was fall apart tender. I whisked in about 1 cup of softened cream cheese to the liquid left in the crockpot, per another posters suggestion, to give the creaminess that was missing from not using the soup. Then I put everything back in the crockpot and left it on low until heated through. 

My husband raved about  how much he loved this. I liked it because the chicken was really tender and the brininess of the tomatoes, artichokes and capers were a nice complement to the creaminess of the 'gravy'.  I served this over noodles and the leftovers over rice. Both ways were delicious.

I will definitely make this again. But I think that I will save out some of the tomatoes, artichokes and capers to add in at the end. They added a good flavor for the cooking but there wasn't much left of them once cooking was done and I would like to see some of the ingredients. I will also add in less broth since there was a lot of 'gravy' for the amount of meat.

I followed the recipe exactly except for the olives, I left those out because we don't like them.  We ate it but did not care for it that much.  I thought the sun dried tomatoes would really pop, but it tasted mostly like the soup.  Will not make again.

This was a very tasty dish and was so easy to make!  I didn't have any white wine, so I substituted chicken broth as suggested.  I also didn't have any Kalamata olives, but I added a few chopped black olives during the last 15 minutes of cooking to add color and they tasted just fine.  Served with steamed broccoli and a side of orzo, to which I added butter, parsley, fresh ground pepper, and parmesan cheese.  My husband loved this meal!

I liked the flavor of the chicken, but found the liquid in the slow cooker to be too thin and oily to be appealing to use as a sauce and without it the chicken was very dry. I may try figuring out a different way to incorporate the same flavor profile into a more appealing dish.

Very tasty. I skipped the olives and added mushrooms. I also served it over aborio rice. Unlike some other reviews, I didn't find it too salty, even after accidently adding more capers than was needed.

I made this for my night to cook, and it was a huge hit!  I'm not a huge fan of olives, but they weren't too strong in this.  My mom loved it!  It was a little watery, so might have to reduce the liquids a little. next time, but otherwise, I can't recommend this enough!  Definitely a dish that will impress!  (I served it over rice, btw.)

This was NOT good at all.  I followed the recipe exactly and it smelled bad when I came home from work. I can't describe the taste, but it was worse than the smell.

The sauce was an unappealing brown color, there wasn't much flavor.  I would not likely make this recipie again.

This is a great recipe. My family loved it. I followed it to a tea with no changes and it was delish! I recommend it!

Delicious! The only change I made was to omit the capers because I didn't have any. I cooked it on low for about 9 hours while I was at work. The sauce turned out a lot darker than the photo - not sure if it was the longer cooking time, or coloring from the olives/tomatoes. It looked a little unappetizing, but luckily I don't have kids so it didn't matter :) Tastes great!
