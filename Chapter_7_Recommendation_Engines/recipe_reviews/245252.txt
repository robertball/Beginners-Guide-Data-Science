Skip the butter for less fat. I used frozen onion, green, red pepper mix.  Use nonfat spray to coat pan. Even using lower fat cheddar cheese will produce plenty of fat. Add lid to cook to soften all veg.  The black beans give the meatiness. Tried original. Loved my less fat, less cooking-time version. Great for summer dish. In a pinch, can even use can mushrooms.

I made this to take to a breakfast meeting and it was well received. I am vegetarian and liked that it had beans instead of meat. Very tasty, got asked for the recipe. I did not add another tablespoon of butter (melted) to the mix and did not miss it. This makes just enough for 3-4 people, so I would double the recipe if you are making it for a crowd.

I also doubled this recipe and used one red pepper instead the extra green pepper. Otherwise, I made it just as it was presented. Great served with salsa.

Fantastic dish! Doubled the recipe, chopped veggies the night before so it was easy to saut√©, mix and bake the next morning prior to my guests arriving. They loved it and want the recipe!!

This was just ok.  I omitted the black beans and used spinach instead.  It was bland.  If I were to make it again I think I'd add some garlic and more salt.

Made this for a quick and easy dinner. Will definitely be adding it to the regular category. My 2 year old and 1 year old absolutely loved it! Only thing I did was puree the beans to a chunky consistancy as the kids will not eat whole beans. Super delicious.

Was doubtful the egg would overwhelm and it'd taste like a huge omelette, but I was delightfully surprised.  Used basil instead of parsley, that was the only change.  Great with kale salad on the side.  Will make again.
