Another winner from Chef John! The only change I made was with the flour. I thought it was an odd amount - technically, 1 7/8 cups is 1 3/4 cups plus 2 tablespoons. So I added the 2 tablespoons to the streusel mixture instead. This helped the streusel retain its crumbled texture without melting entirely into the cake. I used the remaining 1 3/4 cups of flour in the cake mixture, and it didn't adversely affect the crumb of the cake at all. It was deliciously moist!

Jan 2019 - This is my husband's, my mom's and my all time favourite! We are huge nut, cinnamon and brown sugar lovers!!!

I tweaked the recipe only a bit: 
1) I doubled the amount of nuts (used walnuts instead of pecans) and chopped them with a knife, not too fine; 
2) I used only brown sugar for the crumb and doubled the cinnamon (we love cinnamon); 
3) I used organic sugar instead of white for the batter and put 3 eggs instead of 2, which made it easier to spread in the pan before baking. 

I have now made this cake 4 times (in 1 month) due to requests and that is the ultimate recipe for my family. Both husband's and my families absolutely love it!!! Thank you so much!

UPDATE July 2019 - I cannot express how loved this cake is. My husband took a bunch to work and it was gone within 3 minutes, with people asking for recipes or begging him to have me make it again. I have been making it at least once a month. Over time, I have mastered it. The change is to put a whole large container of sour cream- about 500ml. It makes the cake even more fluffy! I have now made it so many times that I eyeball all the ingredients and measure nothing! It turns out great every time!

Used 8 X 8 pan, cooking about an extra 10 minutes. Make as directed...no changes!  Best coffee cake ever. Never have to worry about this one lying around. Just when you think you'll sneak a piece... ha! It's gone!

My family loved this cake. Made it by recipe and it turned out perfect. The only thing I was wondering is if I can double the recipe for a bigger pan. Didn't want to ruin it so I did it in 8x8, but would like to do a bigger one.

I made individual cakes, cup cake size.  They are light with a sweet crunchy top.  I didn't change a thing but the cooking time was changed for the cupcake.  The recipe made 24, I am going to freeze some!

This cake was delicious! My daughter doesn't usually eat cakes but she asked to try a piece of mine, after which she proceeded to steal the rest for herself.  I think the ingredient proportions were spot on, wouldn't change anything and will definitely make it again.

I doubled this and used a 9x13. So of course I had to bake it longer. Delicious! Also lowered the flour  by 2T  per original recipe and added it to the topping. Huge hit!!

Phenomenal coffee cake Chef John!  Yummy filling/ Topping and super moist!  Everyone loves this!  To get that great layer of yummy goodness in the middle make sure to chop the pecans first, then measure out the 1 1/2 cups. I've made this twice this week. The first time I doubled the recipe, and used a total of 3 cups of whole pecans that I coarsely chopped.  It filled two 8x8x2 pans and a 6 large muffin tin.  My husband and I loved it, but thought it needed more filling, and  I realized after looking at  Chef John's photo, my filling seemed lost (didn't chop the pecans up enough) but everyone still LOVED it and asked for the recipe). The second time I made a triple batch, decided to chop the pecans with my food processor, then measured them out (4 1/2 cups total). PERFECTION!  This time I filled both a  9x13x2, and an 8x8x2 pan with a beautiful layer in the middle and topping. I ate one piece right out of the oven, and of course it wasn't set yet, buy YUMMY!  Served it at a party the next day, everyone loved it!  I camp monthly as an assistant scout master with a boy scout troop. I'll for sure be making this on a future campout in a Dutch oven over charcoals, for the "old goat (adult leaders) patrol". pretty sure this will be one the scouts will want to learn to make after they try it. Thank you Chef John!!

I have made this so many times and it's always a hit! 
I especially love the way Chef John instructs to put melted butter in the streusel  - it's like a praline topping.
Most of the time I add blueberries in the middle and on top with the streusel. And if you want to prepare in advance,  it even freezes well!
Talk about GOOD! Thanks Chef John!

This is a delicious coffee cake! I made it for company and got lots of compliments on it. I like the fact that I didn't need to haul out the electric mixer to put it together. And while I hate to admit it, I did substitute plain yogurt + one teaspoon of baking soda for the sour cream. But that was ONLY because I forgot to purchase the sour cream and I had the yogurt on hand.  Otherwise I made it according to the recipe.

Our family agrees with Chef John that the buttery topping is the best!  We love this version!  I made two of these the other day, one to use as a hostess gift and the other for us.  Both are now gone!  You can cut back on any of the ingredients you feel you need to, but I don't understand why you would!  This is perfect just the way it is.  Thanks, Chef, for another winner!

Followed the recipe exactly in terms of ingredients and quantities . I didn't have an 8"x10" , and so instead used an 8" round tin , and baked for approx. 40mins . Also, for the topping, I made a coarse powder of half the pecans and finely chopped the remaining, made it fairly easy to spread. Thanks to one of the other comments , I figured out that 7/8th of a cup is 3/4th and 2 tablespoons..??. Personally, I'd probably reduce the white sugar quantity in the topping next time , as I found it a tad too sweet. but thats a matter of individual taste. The end result is really moist and delicious. Overall , this is a fantastic recipe and a keeper.

One of the best coffee cakes I have ever made.  The trick is in how the ingredients are mixed together.

Took the advice and used 8x8 baking dish and added 15 minutes to the cooking time. Also use creme fraiche. It was perfect. Thank you again Chef John for a great recipe. Can't wait to try and make your focaccia di Recco recipe next. Thanks again..

I did a little tweaking to lighten up the cake...I used 3/4 cup of splenda and a 1/4 of brown sugar...egg whites, and 0% fat greek yogurt as substitutes. It turned out great , very moist. I also used a butter pecan extract I bought off amazon! Gives the cake that rich flavor.  I also used a bundt pan and it worked out great...same baking time.

This coffee cake is very good! The only thing I had to change was the baking time. It seemed to not get done in the middle so I left it in for five minute intervals until I felt like it was not sticking to my toothpick. Just a longer cooking time than expected. But that's it!

This turned out pretty good. My husband loved it. I did double the topping amounts because that is the best part, left out the nuts and added one small green apple diced finely to the batter. Baked in an 8 by 11 pan for 33 minutes. I'd make it again.

Delicious. I made it with walnuts instead of the pecans increasing the amount of ground walnuts to 2 cups. I also added a pinch of nutmeg and allspice.

YUM. I doubled the topping (duh) and added cream cheese frosting on top! Tasted like a cinnamon roll. I baked it in an 8 x 8. Had to cook it for much longer, but placed foil over the top once I could tell the pecans were about to get burnt. Will 100% make again.

Meh. I know I'm in the minority but this was not the style of coffee cake I was looking for.  It was too eggy for me and not that light and fluffy coffee cake like you get at the bakery.

I've made this several times as a treat to have around for myself to snack on here and there throughout the week. Turns out the teens in our house absolutely love it. The whole cake is usually gone within a day or two.

Excellent Recipe!!!  I made it in a Bundt pan, increased sugars to 1/2 c each and added 2 Tbsps flour and all the pecans to the crumb mixture. After buttering pan, sprinkled 1/3 crumb mixture in bottom, spooned in 1/2 batter, sprinkled another 1/3 of crumb mixture, spooned in remaining half of batter, and sprinkled the last 1/3 of crumb mixture. Baked for 45 min - carefully went around outside edge with a butter knife, put a plate on top of pan, flipped Cake onto plate and let it cool slightly before cutting.  It was loved by all who partook!??

I cannot compliment this recipe enough. This is the coffee cake recipe I’ve been looking for all my life. I live in Texas, and we love pecans down here. I can’t wait to make this for the holidays.

We loved this cake!  I made it according to the directions but subbed walnuts for the pecans, because that's what I had at home.  My oven is a little off and I had to bake it a little longer.  Great coffee cake, perfect amount of sweetness and crunch.  Thanks, Chef John!

Haven’t got the finished product out of the oven, however, I felt the pan size was not accurate. The batter barely spread across my 8x8 pan!

Fantastic! I just made mine in a 9x13 pan and it turn out perfect.. there wasn’t enough batter for me to do a layered bundt cake. Had several coworkers ask for the recipe.. and of course I shared!!

Excellent recipe. Only change I made was to bake it in a 8 x 8 dish instead of the slightly larger one that was recommended, so I needed to adjust the baking time by 15 additional minutes.  I appreciate the conversion of 1 7/8 cups of flour. 1 3/4 plus 2 tablespoon is much easier to measure. I definitely will be making this one again!

This is a really good coffee cake- I pretty much followed the recipe although I did find the 7/8 cup of flour annoying and guesstimated it. The husband is loving it!However, I do think delicate sweet flavor of the pecans kind of gets lost in the sugary cinnamon mix so the next time I'll try it with walnuts which should give a bolder nutty flavor.

This was truly delicious and did you notice you don't use your mixer?  
The only changes I made were based on a reviewer who used the extra 2 TBLSP flour (1 7/8 cup flour = 1 cup + 3/4 cup plus 2 TBLSP) in the crumb section.  I also cut my sugar in the cake to 3/4 cup from a cup.  It was still plenty sweet.  I used a pyrex dish, 7x11 and baked it 35 minutes.  The longest task was spreading the 2nd layer but using my frosting utensil was a big  help.  One person suggested using a 3rd egg, which made her spreading easier. Can't decide if I should try it.  
Thanks for this great recipe!

Such a delicious cake!!! Followed the recipe as written but doubled the nut mixture  out half in Bundt pan topped with cake more nuts, another layer of cake batter. flipped out then dusted with confection sugar when cooled. The nit topping gave a nice caramalized crunch to the top, but was nice and moist on the inside. I will definitely be making this over and over

Excellent in every way. I served it warm which made it extra special and I made it in a 10 Cheesecake pan so we cut it in wedges. 
Wonderful and easy. This will be a regular.

This is an amazing recipe! Super moist. My boys said this recipe should be my go to for coffee cake. I didn't have pecans on hand so I used walnuts, still so delicious. It pairs perfectly with rich dark coffee as the sweetness is a nice contrast. Will definitely make over and over!

This is DELISH!!! I was looking for a dessert to use up some of the pecans I bought for Christmas baking.  I didn't tinker with the recipe. I did have to bake it a bit longer than called for. So yummy! I will make again!

I gave this cake top-star billing, and it deserves it.  But, it wasn't easy!  I mean, a cup and 7/8ths of flour....what's up with that???  Well, I have made this cake four times (yes, four) in the last two days, and each time it got easier and better.  I have for years been searching for the perfect coffee cake recipe, and I have made more coffee cakes than Drake's, and the results were anywhere from blah up to so-so.  I wasn't expecting a WOW from this one, but it IS Chef John's recipe, and I trust him.  So, cake #1...made according to directions.  Not bad, but the prep was annoying...there was that aforementioned one and 7/8's cup of flour, and also that 8 x 10" cake pan.  I don't own one that size.  I had to go to an 8 x 8, and there was a lot, a lot, of leftover batter which I put in a smaller pan.  That smaller cake didn't get a lot of crumbs, and in the 8x8, the inside crumbs sank to the bottom. Cake #2,  I doubled The Chef's crumb mixture, used two 8x8 pans, split the batter and crumbs between the two pans, and got two nice but thinnish good tasting coffee cakes.  Next day, Cake #3, doubled the crumbs,  split the crumb mixture in half, and put the pecans only in the topping crumbs of the cake,  used a 9x13 pan,  perfect.  Now We're Cooking.  So finally, with Cake #4, I've got it.  Doubled the crumbs, only put pecans in the topping crumbs, and used a 9x13 pan.  I think I have finally found my perfect coffee cake.  You can follow Chef John's recipe, I will follow my alte

Delicious recipe. I used an 8x8 baking pan, so had to cook about 57 mins. I also substituted Greek yogurt for the sour cream for a more lactose free recipe. The cake turned out moist and light, and the 2 layers of crumble made every bite yummy. Think this will be my go-to coffee cake recipe.

Wow! The flavor of the cake and crumb topping is amazing. The cake is moist, topping is crunchy and not too overpowering. Just the right amount of cinnamon and right quantity of crumb for middle and top. 

This is the first time I have made it and I followed directions except I added slightly less than 2 cups flour and substituted slivered almonds for pecans.  I also cooked it in an 8 X 11 glass dish.

The reason for one less star is the cake is very slightly overdone on the edges and corners.  It may be due to my convection oven but it took a while for the cake to be done in the center so the edges are over done.  Total time was 39 minutes which I thought would be less using convection and a slightly larger pan.  Also, the batter is thick so spreading it can be tricky.

Overall great coffee cake and I will be making it again!

This coffee cake is very good! It is very moist :) my only complaint was for me there were to many nuts ( just my own personal preference)  so next time I will tweak the topping a bit! But as we all know if Chef John makes it well then you know it is going to be good!!

Oh my goodness!!!  Delicious!  I doubled the recipe and probably needed to bake longer than I did as it sunk a bit in the middle.  However, fantastic flavor!!  Love this!!

very super tasty, perfect as a coffee cake should be.  I did double, at the review of another, the crumbly stuff.  

Easy to make and even better to eat!!!

This is a moist and lovely dream cake. Easy peasy to make too. I made this for weekend company to have with our coffee in the morning because they are not the traditional breakfast type and it was a big hit. My friend's hubby had a second piece and kept saying it was the best coffee cake he ever tasted. Thanks Chef John!

Made this in an 11 X 7 and baked for close to 45 minutes.  Plenty done.  While this was a good coffee cake, i didn't think it was anything to write home about considering the work. I had made a similar one a few weeks prior so i used maple extract and it offered a nice change.

Followed the recipe exactly and it turned out perfectly. Make sure you’re using the correct size baking pan as mine was too big and it was hard to spread the batter so thin

This is by far my coworkers favorite coffee cake. It is absolutely delicious and a must have for the mid-week blues. The recipe was super easy and it produced amazing results! I will definitely be making it again.

Amazing my mother in-law said it’s the best she’s ever had. That means a lot. It looks really thin when you spread it out but it turns out perfectly in the end.

I loved this coffee cake! People kept coming back for more. I made it for 15.  I appreciate that you can adjust the servings, but some of the adjustments didn’t translate well or adjust in the instructions of the recipe.

This is absolutely DELICIOUS!  Made exactly as written, but found I was short on pecans.  I had some almonds, and the combo was great.  Nest time...because there will DEFINITELY be many more next times...I'll use all pecans as written.  It did more time than called for.

Very Good!! I followed recipe exactly. I'd just offer or be curious about 2 slight adjustments. Initially, i'd double the amount of pecan crumbles, cause lets be honest thats the part we all love the most. 

Second, I'd find a way (or be curious) how to make it a bit more moist. True to form, it was the perfect consistency, but I tend to like my cakes more on the moist side, so not sure what that means for this dish. Maybe more sour cream and butter? THANKS anyway, i'll absolutely add this to the recipe book!

Fantastic as written. I did use 1 C. pecans and 1/2  C. walnuts. Also added 3 tsp.  flour to topping to keep together better. Yummy served warm. Thank you Chef John.

Made it for my husband's birthday.  Used a 9x9 pan but it was a little thin for that. I might do an 8x8 next time.  I am not a huge coffeecake fan but thought it was good.  Still looking for the perfect recipe that will WOW everyone!

When I got to the designated amount of time I started doing the toothpick test. Each time it kept coming out with batter on it. So I'd do it a little longer.  This happened several times.  Which is obviously over the  alled for baking time. 
I just tried a piece and it's dry. Flavor is wonderful,  but I obviously overcooked it.

This cake had good flavor and consistency (a bit too sweet for me). I used a glass 8x8 square baking dish and it took 50 minutes in a 350 degree oven to cook thoroughly, as opposed to the 30 in the instructions.

I doubled the recipe, for a 9 x 13 dish. Baked it for 50 minutes at 350  degrees.    Definitely filled the whole pan!   Did not change anything, and it turned out perfect! Everyone loved it.

I made this for my very picky mothers birthday - WOW!!! She absolutely LOVED it! I was shocked because usually I hear- it's to sweet,- whenever I bake for my parents- dad is not so hard to please! .I followed the recipe exactly as written.  Already have a request 2 make it again. This will b in heavy rotation I bet! Thanks Chef John for another outstanding recipe!

I doubled the recipe, placed it in a 9x13 pan baked it 45-50 minutes. PS: If you spray the spatula with canola spray or butter it, the batter doesn’t stick and it spreads easily ??

This is a really terrific recipe! I read the other reviews and decided to double the recipe so it made more. Baked in a 9x13 glass casserole dish. Baked at 350 for 65 minutes, came out perfect and moist. When baking it appeared it would overflow the dish but though high, didn’t spill over. Follow John’s advice spooning flour into cup measurement gently so as not to pack it and end up with too much flour. Some pecans taste a little burnt so next time I’ll cover the cake the last 20 minutes with aluminum foil. This is going to be a real hit at the office!

Delicious flavors, but I'd have to play a bit more with the time in the oven, because I only had an 8x8 pan. Next time I would bake it for 50 minutes off the bat; as it was I was taking it in and out of the oven after 35 min and it still turned out gloopy in the middle. But seriously, excellent taste. The crumb mixture is crispy on top but keeps the cake moist in the middle.

YEA!!!! it was great. I don't usually change what the baker does to his recipe but i was wondering how these would be in muffins.  I am always unsure if i should try different pan etc.  I do not like when the great recipe doesn't  work as good as the original is.  So please let me know your opinion. Thank you.

Made for Easter brunch today and it was a huge hit.  That said the finished product was a little unusual.  It def wasn't a lighter fluffy cake vibe. Much more dense and "wet" if you will. Still, super flavorful and naughty.    One thing I would do differently is add a Tbsp or 2 of flour to streusel.  We omitted the nuts which may have been the issue, but the streusel on top sunk right into the cake.  So the top didn't look as pretty as the middle. That said, it was rich enough you didn't need that layer other than for optics.

This recipe was delicious! I have made it twice . The second time , I doubled it for a family party. 
The cake is  moist, light and tasty. I think the next time I make it, I’ll make more cinnamon/sugar/ pecan crumb on top.
Thank you Chef John!

Last night I made  it exactly as described. Today it is all gone. The family LOVED it. The only complaint is less nuts next time.  I am making it again but will use 1 cup of pecans instead of 1 1/2 cups.

Very moist, Super good and pretty straight forward to assemble.  I didn't use pecans (because, ya know - kids..), and it was still delicious.   I just added a little flour to the crumble top, mixed well and it worked great!  I put mine in an 8x8 and it took closer to 45 min.

Made it exactly as directed. Tasted wonderful. Make sure pecans are quite finely chopped for ease of distribution. Had to cook much longer than it said by several 6 min. increments. This caused a bit of overcooking in the corners. Nevertheless, rave reviews were given by those who tried it. Will make again.

Holy smokes was this easy to make and so delicious. Made it for a ladies brunch and most of it was gone by the end. Most of the fresh chocolate croissants remained but there were only 2 pieces of this left.  I made it exactly as stated except that I used the 2 T of flour with the crumb mixture as many on here suggested. Yum!!!!.

This is delicious. I omitted the salt, otherwise made as written.
I brought it to my work office, straight from the oven and everyone is raving about how yummy it is. Great recipe.

I made this for a ladies morning meeting and received many compliments. The leftovers are still great even days later. Will definitely make it again. My only issue was uncertainty about the size of the pan (who has an 8x10”?) I used a 9x13” and thanks to “How to Make Your Baking Recipe Fit Your Pan Size” (Food 52) I was able to see that 1-1/2 times this recipe worked out perfectly. Every baker should bookmark this site and everyone needs to try this wonderful coffee cake. Make it exactly as the recipe instructs. It’s perfect!

I took other reviewers' advice and doubled the topping but cutting the sugars a bit.  I think it's waaaaay too much, and way too sweet.
I made this in a loaf pan and placed half the crumble in the middle and the remainder on top (with added flour).  It all found its way to the middle, and made for a solid sweet mass.
Next time (because the cake is delicious ), I will make the crumb reducing each of the sugars to 1/4, add 2Tbsp flour and only place it on top.
I used vanilla flavoured greek yogurt in place of sour cream + vanilla.  It still needs 1 tsp of vanilla.

Cut back on sugar.  I will definitely make this again.   I was looking for a yeast coffee cake recipe, but after making this, there is no need to go to all  that time and trouble. The cake in this recipe rose nicely, very light and fluffy.  Rave reviews from the family.

This coffee cake is the exact same as I made when I was a kid some 40 years ago.  This is so moist and has so many yummy parts!  I followed the entire recipe except for dividing the flour that was previously discussed.  Awesome coffeecake!  Thank you chef!!

This is the first coffee cake I have ever made, but it was at the request of my daughter so I was happy to find this recipe with so many positive reviews. I am in Denver, CO, so that may have affected my cooking time, but I had to go an extra 5 minutes (40 total) and probably should have gone another 5 because my cake sunk in the middle when it was cooling. I also noticed in the video (after I made the cake) that they amount of butter he drizzles into the topping is way more than the 3 tablespoons called for in the recipe. Looked more like 1/3 cup butter to me.  I'll try that next time, because my topping was too dry and crumbly. Have my eyes on the blueberry coffee cake recipe to try next time.

I'll definitely make this again but with the following changes: 1) I cut the sugar in the batter down by 1/4 c. and next time will cut the sugar in the topping by the same ratio.  I used walnuts instead of pecans. This was excellent, just too sweet for our taste. I baked it in a two piece cheese cake pan, lined the bottom with a round of parchment paper and the sides with parchment paper (oiling the pan, then placing in the parchment, then oiling again). I wanted to be able to serve it on a plate rather than in the pan.

Its a very good recipe, well written and easy to follow.  Just a note, when adding the second layer dollop the cake batter with a large soup spoon and gently spread it with your fingers.

After years of looking at recipes, putting them in collections, and making a few, I finally decided that I should comment on one of them :).  This was delicious!  Thank you for the recipe, Chef John!  I think it was my first coffee cake that I've ever made, and wow.  The crumble was great and the little taste of the sea salt made this coffee cake terrific.  I made it for my husband and parents, who don't eat a lot of super sweet desserts.  They loved it- served warm with vanilla ice cream, and hubby had three more pieces after they left.  I used a square 9 inch pan.

I’m an avid baker & cook, however there is something with chef johns recipes that don’t work out for me. I followed the recipes to the T with one small exception, I used walnuts instead of pecans Bc that’s what I had. Same size pan, same measured ingredients, same temp, etc., mine came out under cooked in the middle & I ran out of sugar topping to put in the middle & top. (His comments state he is generous with the topping.)

Wonderful.  

Made for coworkers.  I didn't have enough of the batter for the top layer but it still came out heavenly, even though it was unevenly filled!

It was devoured and someone insisted I give them the recipe.  

I also loved the video tutorial.

So delicious. Not over mixing is key here. I did reduce the sugar simply because my family doesn’t like baked goods to be too sweet. I did 1/4 c white and brown in the crumble mixture and reduced the amount of sugar in the batter to 3/4 cup (instead of one cup). Perfect recipe if you have some leftover sour cream you don’t know what to do with.

Rich, dense cake that goes great with coffee without sugar; the cake is sweet enough. Since I don't own an 8" x 10" pan, I used a medium, oval-shaped, Corning Ware dish. I think my dish was too small because the pecans we're piled on top of each other, giving this cake a strong pecan flavor (I followed the directions exactly). Also, the middle collapsed. Other reviews suggest an 8" x 8" pan; I will use that next time. Next day, the pecan taste evened out. The streusel in the middle remains moist, while the top is a little crunchy.  This is an elegant treat.

This is a wonderful coffee cake. Chef John's recipes are almost great, and this is no exception. Sweet enough without being too sweet. Moist cake, crunchy topping. I had to bake in an 8x8 baking pan and added about five extra minutes. I will make this again

I liked it a lot!
I had it with a cup of black tea. It was crumbly on top. Moist and yet dry at the same time inside.

Good, enjoyed the crumble inside the cake  -- helped keep things moist. I plan to make this again, perhaps adding the top crumble in the last 5-10 minutes of baking.

I was out of sour cream so I substituted whole milk greek yogurt.  I used a 9 x 7 baking dish.  It took 15 minutes longer to cook than directions say.  It was good.  Will  make again using  sour cream and a bigger baking dish.

I love this recipe! I usually double the crumb and use a angel food cake pan to bake in. Make at least two of these as the first one will be gone within the hour! Lol

This is by far the best pecan coffee cake recipe! It’s a hit every time I make it. The only change I make is cut back on the sugar in the cake itself to 1/4 cup but that’s just my preference since I don’t like cakes that are too sweet. There’s more than enough sugar in the streusel part anyway. Definitely will be making this forever!!! Thanks chef John!!!!

Without question the best coffee cake I've ever made!  The base mix - before nut mixture - is fabulous.  I would love to try this adding fruit as well.  I will DEFINITELY make this again!

Used 8"X8" pan. Very thick batter. I put teaspoonfuls close together & then spread them together. Timely but worth it.  I thought about putting batter in bag and piping it out, but haven't tried yet. Baked 40 -45 minutes.  Delicious!!!!

This was very good - nothing wrong with it.  Tip for newbies, chop pecans fine but not too fine.  You want something for your teeth to sink into.  
We were missing the traditional streusel topping.  Kids and hubby all said they preferred that.   
We're going to look around for a different coffee cake recipe.

I used walnuts and only used half of the crumb mixture in two layers of cake.  Saved extra mixture on wax paper in freezer bag for next cake to be made.  I only used half of the amounts of sugar mentioned in recipe.

This was the best ever.  Made it several times at my daughter's house over holidays and it was such a hit.   Everyone loved it and requested it to be made often.  I usually don't like coffee cake but this was so moist and full of flavor I would give it more than 5 stars.  Made as listed with no changes and a definite keeper.

Raves all around for this delicious dessert! It was perfect for a cold, rainy day treat. Everyone wanted the recipe and other friends who heard about it have requested this bread pudding when they come over! This has never happened before.
If you're looking for low cal - don't make this one!

My husband loves anything with nuts, so I made him this recipe. He was in heaven! Everyone loved it. The cinnamon and brown sugar covered pecans in the middle were a delightful surprise. I made it in an 8x8 pan and it worked out perfectly. I highly recommend you make this coffee cake. It'll become one of your favorites too!

This recipe was amazing! I made my own creme fraiche by using 1 cup heavy creme and 2 tbs buttermilk ... Letting it sit out for 24 hrs. Yum!

Everyone loved this, but all my pecan mixture sunk to the bottom. What did I do wrong? I didn't see others having this problem. I might just put all of the pecan mixture on top next time.

Great coffee cake recipe. I used it for a catering job. Great flavor. I substituted almonds for pecans and baked in individual brownie pan.

I used a loaf pan, instead of the square pan, so it took longer to bake, but it is delicious! The crumbs are the best part!
