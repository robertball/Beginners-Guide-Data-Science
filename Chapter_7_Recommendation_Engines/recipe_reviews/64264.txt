Very good recipe.  When I make it again I will probably make the meatballs smaller.  I used fresh thyme instead of the Italian seasoning because I had that on hand.  I also added an extra can of broth to make the soup serve more people

YUM!!!!! My family loved this recipe! I modified the recipe a bit by sauteing an onion, garlic and olive oil in the stock pot before adding the tomatoes and broth. I also used bread crumbs instead of the wheat germ.

EXCELLENT! This was truly an easy and delicious recipe!  I used Italian Bread crumbs in lieu of the wheat germ and added generous amounts of garlic salt to the meatballs.  My husband asked me why I haven't made this sooner! I didn't use spinach, and I used 2 chicken buillion cubes as opposed to the chicken stock,much easier!  The broth/soup is AMAZING! You will not be disappointed! This will be a staple in my recipe box, thank you!!!

This was delicious!  I added a 1/4 cup of Diced Onion and a 1/2 Tsp. Garlic Powder to the meatballs.  In addition, I substituted regular spinach for baby spinach to take the bitterness out.  Really, really, good.  I plan to make it again and again.

I substituted bread crumbs for wheat germ and came out pretty good.  I'll make the meat balls slightly smaller next time, otherwise I won't change a thing.  We'll make this again once it drops below 90 degrees or so.

My husband could not get enough of this soup.  I added extra chicken broth, fresh thyme, garlic and orzo and it was so good.

I followed this recipe and 3 others to make Italian Wedding soup. I included the wheat germ from this recipe in my half ground beef, half ground chicken recipe. Very good.

My husband prepared this with 1lb of pre-cooked meatballs (quartered) and a shake of red pepper flakes.  Very thick and tasty.  You could easily add extra broth to stretch the recipe.

Turned out really good, my husband really enjoyed it, and so did I, especially with the cheese on top makes it so yummy, but I don't think I'll use the wheatgerm next time, think I'll just use italian bread crumbs. Overall really good

This is one of our favorite soup recipes. It is incredibly easy, although a little time consuming because of the meatballs, but it makes such a wonderful pot of soup it is well worth the effort. I have made this recipe several times and it is easily adaptable. I always use seasoned bread crumbs instead of the wheat germ and add some garlic to the meatballs as well as the broth. I also use frozen spinach most of the time, chopped because my fiance doesn't like to admit he is eating spinach. I also use crushed tomatoes most of the time for a smoother soup. Served with a salad or a nice crusty bread this makes a wonderful light meal.

Wonderful simple recipe. I can not speak to the meatballs, I had some leftover stuffing turkey meatballs I had made for an earlier meal. My husband was not looking forward to this dish, but ended up loveing it!  I used big bow tie pasta since that is what I had on hand and ended having to double the broth and tomatos.  I took left overs to our friends and they really enjoyed it too! Great with a crusty garlic bread. Next time I may add zuchinni or squash to it!

Hubby & I both liked this a lot.  I used a package of soy crumbles instead of the meat balls.  That made this SO FAST & EASY!  From start to table >20 minutes and it's GOOD.  I served w/ leftover corn bread. I will make sure I have corn bread next time I make this.  EXCELLENT combo!

This was really easy and tasted fantastic.  I would recommend a bit more spice in the meatballs, but other than that a really good soup!
