I made this for my husband who is from Slovakia. He thought is was so authentic and very delicious that I will definitely be making this again for him. I served this with dumplings and it made a fantasic meal for him. Thanks for the recipe.

This is so so good.....one of my all-time favorite recipes on this website.  I've made this recipe with stew meat and also tried it with flat iron steak.  I must say I liked it a little better with the flat iron steak....either way though, you can't really go wrong.  Honestly, I wouldn't want to add tomatoes, potatoes, carrots and all that.  I feel like it would take away from the flavor.  Out of all the hungarian goulash recipes on this site, hungarian goulash III is the best

We made this two nights ago for dinner and really enjoyed it.  The only thing different I did was not add salt to the recipe (Hubs is salt restricted).  I, on the other hand, am not salt restricted so I added it after it was on my plate.  I leave you with one last comment - YUM!  Thanks for sharing this delicious recipe.

Delicious!  I only made two changes;I used less brown sugar per another person's suggestion, and I thickened it up with a little bit of corn starch right before serving. The meat was tender, the sauce was flavorful. Husband loved it! Will definitely make this again.

I usually triple this recipe and eat a few meals through the week.  When I triple I only put in 3 cups of water.  This is best when you cook it long enough for the sauce to get nice and thick!

Recipe was too sweet. Suggest cutting down on the brown sugar - maybe by half. Otherwise, easy to make.

This was very yummy.  I had some potatoes to be used up, so I served this with mashed potatoes per another reviewer's suggestion.  I had to cook the sauce down until it was thick with the pot uncovered to make it perfect.  Thanks for the recipe!

I found that their was not enough meat in the dish and I had doubled the meat for the recipe already. Although the flavor was outstanding.

This is a keeper!  I just made this tonight, used Hungarian paprika and followed the recipe, it came out great!  The next time I'll use a bit more beef, I just thought one pound was not enough for my family.  Thanks for the recipe!

I only gave it 4 stars because I had to make some adjustments.  I didn't think the vinegar was necessary.  I decreased the amount of brown sugar to one tablespoon and increased the ketchup to one cup.  Very tasty though.  My husband gave it 4 stars too.

from my understanding, every time i have gone to a Hungarian restaurant, there should be diced potatoes and caraway added to this recipe. Definitely not the same without it!

I think this recipe was very good, as did my family. It had a perfect blend of flavors, & my kids loved it, & they're usually pretty hard to please. Only things I would do differently next time, double the recipe, & thicken it up a bit. Very tasty!

Tried this for something different than my own recipe.  Did not like using ketchup instead of tomato paste.  The gravy was too thin too.

I've been making this recipe for about 15 years and we love it! There seems to be a lot of variations in "hungarian goulash" but this is the
one I learned to make and my family enjoys it tremendously! I noticed some said to cut down on the brown sugar but personally I wouldn't. I like it just the way it is! I do at least double and sometimes triple this recipe because we like it good and saucy for dipping our bread in too! Thank you for posting this recipe

I found this rather bland and it didn't really reduce to a saucy consistency after the meat turned tender.

Yum, yum, YUM! I will be making this recipe again, and often! An hour before it was finished simmering, I added 4 peeled and cubed potatoes. At that stage I had to add more water as well....and it worked out VERY nicely! :-)

I used cubed chicken steak (very tender) Next time I will use 1 tb of sugar instead of 2 - I also thickened  the liquid at the end with instant mash. A very good winter meal..

Very tasty.  My whole family enjoyed this recipe.  I doubled the recipe and cut the brown sugar in half and still found it a little sweet for my taste.  I would probably omit the brown sugar next time but there will definitely be a next time!

Thank you!! My mother made this for us also. I love this and it's a great comfort food. I lost the recipe from my mom. I've been searching for awhile and finally found this. Thanks again!

A nice easy dish to make. I changed it a little. I added a little carrots for color and potatoes. I alao cut the brown sugar down to a pinch. I served with fusilli and a dollop of sour cream. It was very tasty.

A new family favorite!  I actually used the slow cooker.  I swapped out turkey cutlets for the beef (we have a been allergy I the house) and put the turkey and onion in the slow cooker.  Then I mixed up the sauce (omitted the sugar, we have another allergy), poured it in and let it cook on low for 8 hours.  Last half hour I turned up to high and left the lid slightly open to thicken the sauce a bit.  I did not add thickener so it never got thick, but it was really nice and tasted great over noodles.  Everyone raved about it and asked me to make it again.  Nice job!

I made this for dinner last night.  No changes to recipe as I personally like to try them as written and then see if I need to make changes here and there.  Plus, to give a proper review I feel it must be made on the recipe as written...IMO.  My entire family LOVED this meal and wanted more...just wish I had more to serve.  Next time the only change I will make is I will double the recipe.  Excellent & very tasty just the way it is.

I made this in my Instant Pot electric pressure cooker and it turned out great. However with reducing the brown sugar to 1 Tbs it was still fairly sweet, and would reduce this further. My kids commented that it was like"BBQ soup", so I'll have to think of a way to thicken this slightly, but I liked it soupy. For the Instant Pot, I browned the beef followed by the onions using the sauté function. Then mixed everything else in, but replaced the water with 1 cup of low sodium beef broth ( less liquid needed for the pressure cooker) and set on the Meat/Stew function (or 35 min on high). I let it naturally release the pressure(~20 min) to cook my egg noodles.

I tried this recipe with a little reservation looking at the ingredients but it turned out great! My hubby (who is very picky) enjoyed this dish and looking forward to having it on rotation.

Good 'deep' taste but to my mind tasted more like a good casserole rather than my previous experience of cooking goulash. Maybe my previous attempts were less than authentic but I prefer this much more tomatoes and spicy. Will adjust to this end next time.
I added one teaspoon of sugar having needed advice in previous reviews. Also an Oxo cube.  Cooked in oven for convenience, for about 2 1/2hours.  No reduction of sauce needed as wonderfully thick sauce.
Thanks for recipe.

I followed the reviewers suggestions and halved the brown sugar. I also used low sodium beef broth instead of the water, thought that was good, made the dish more balanced.  I was reading about Paprika, and found that real Hungarian Paprika of good quality is now in many grocery stores like Safeway. I used some Hungarian Paprika and also a half tsp of the Hot Hungarian Paprika for fun, as I like a little heat.  And there was no pepper in this dish.  Another reviewer mentioned caraway seeds in authentic traditional Hungarian Goulash, and I found that is true, what they do is take a tsp of caraway seeds and toast them before adding to the dish (bake on a cookie sheet until toasted on low heat) so that is a good idea and I did try it!!  It was wonderful.  So easy.  You can add anything you want, potatoes, cabbage, carrot, etc... so why not?  Versatile and delicious just simple as well. I liked it on the egg noodles but mashed potatoes would be delicious as well.  What a fun and easy recipe!  My grocery store has (beef) stew meat that is "tenderized" and already all cut up so it was quite tender and had great flavor.

Made this using ground beef instead of cubed beef. It was delicious. This will be a regular in the dinner line up.

This is really good!  Didn't add or omit anything. We browned the meat and threw it all in the Nesco. Only thing I would do next time is double the sauce and meat! Thanks for good recipe

I took the advice of other reviewers and did NOT add the brown sugar.  The ketchup makes it plenty sweet. One thing I DID add was a couple of pinches of red pepper flakes.  It made for a "Spicy Hungarian". YUM!!

Great taste and so simple. I used ground beef and less water and used it on a bun, like sloppy joes.

I have been making this for a few years when I saw it here. I like to add even more paprika, some red wine and lots of peppers. It turns out very rich and hearty. My teenager LOVES it!

So tasty and was even better the next day.  Probably the only time my boyfriend was excited about leftovers!
