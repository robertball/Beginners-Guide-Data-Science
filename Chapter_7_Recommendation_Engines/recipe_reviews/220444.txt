I wasn't a fan of these. The flavor was fine (I left out the almond extract in order to accentuate the flavor of the Bailey's) but I was not impressed with the texture. I found the batter too loose and the resulting cupcake heavy, dense and moist - TOO heavy, dense and moist.  Perhaps both the Bailey's and the sour cream should both be reduced but I'm afraid I'm not interested in this recipe enough to play around with it. These were just passable.

Absolutely marvelous - delightfully moist with an excellent texture. Kept very well in the fridge. A nice hit with the sailors at hubby's squadron.

Well done!

These taste good, but the recipe has serious flaws, which cause the cakes to be very small.  There needs to be more flour and less liquid.  I would suggest eliminating the sour cream and instead adding the egg whites, beaten to a soft peak.

I have made this twice and both times it's been delicious but I've noticed something I wonder if anyone else has had a problem with. When I take them out of the oven they are perfect, but then they deflate and recede.  Why does that happen and is there anything to fix it?

Ok the flavor... Was great.  I paired with a chocolate Irish Cream frosting?  But I must agree with the last review... These cupcakes were too moist.  I will try again with 2 tablespoons less butter...

They didn't taste very good.. the Irish cream made them heavy and gave them a strange texture. maybe add less creme then the recommended amount.

My family rated these cupcakes a 3 and I agree with them. The flavor was just ok. I frosted them with a homemade Buttercream which I added some Bailey's to. Not a cupcake I would make again.

I always rate the recipe by the exact way it is presented, never changing any of the ingredients, otherwise how could it be rated?!. This was a good one. The only thing was that the cupcakes were not as puffed up as I'd have liked. I noticed in the photo, same thing, but it didn't take away from the taste. I do like my Baileys! Meggy

I was very excited to try these cupcakes and was optimistic based on the other reviews but was in the end sorely disappointed! I'm not sure what the other reviewers tasted that I didn't but I followed the recipe to a T. When I took out the cupcakes, I tried one and promptly threw the rest in the garbage. The texture was just awful and the almond extract overpowering. Will definitely not be making these again and would definitely not recommend this recipe to anyone....

Moist and tasty. I think this tastes too much like almond extract, not enough like Bailey's. I am trying again today with less almond extract. However, my office-mates raved about these as they are...maybe it's just me.

The flavor is super yummy but my cupcakes sank. I think I will play with the ingredients a bit the next time and see if I can make these raise up a bit.
