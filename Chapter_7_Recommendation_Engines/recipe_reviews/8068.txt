This cake is good. I like the flavor and the texture. I didn't love the orange in the recommended fruit filling so next time I try this recipe it will be with a different topping: either I will modify the fruit filling and use apples or maybe try a mocha or cream cheese frosting. A few things: it makes lots of batter - it almost overflowed in my 9" pans. This is a massive hearty cake. Also make sure you really mix in the jam or else you will get holes in your cake from where there were chunks of jam that have melted.

This was pretty yummy. Almost like carrot cake. I did not have dates or nuts but used raisins instead. They sank to the bottom. I used the recipe for Cinnamon Coffee frosting to go on top. Very yummy together!!!
