I seasoned the meat with Lawry's Seasoned Salt and fresh cracked pepper.  I used beef broth instead of water, mixed it with the cream of mushroom soup and the dry onion soup mix and cooked on high for 2 hours.  I then added potatoes, carrots, onions and celery and cooked another 1.5 hours. Meat was very tender and the veggies cooked perfectly.

I have been making this recipe over the past 55 years, it isn't my favorite but it is certainly my husbands favorite.  When we were newly wed we had little to spend on the weekly grocery bill and at that time a chuck roast was a very cheap cut of meat to buy, it was on a par with ground beef.  The dish certainly wowed him at the time, it has always stuck in his mind as one of his favorites so every now and then I fix it.  One reviewer mentioned the high salt content of mushroom soup, well.....one very well known soup company (starts with a C) makes a sodium free mushroom soup, it's rather bland for me but I use it anyway and just salt my dinner after it's plated.

I started using dry onion soup mix and cream of mushroom soup on pot roast, when I was first married, early 70's.  It's a great combo.  We like big chunks of carrot, onion, potato and celery, but I've also added other veggies, parsnips, turnips and sweet potatoes.      I don't think zucchini would hold up , it would get mushy.  Also, the amount of potatoes and carrots might work for a 2# roast, but not a 5# roast.

Wonderful.  I added 2 large chopped sweet onions, one small can low salt tomato paste and used 2tsp chopped garlic.  Mix the liquids  and dry mix together, put the meat on top, spooned sauce over meat, then added the veggies.  Used eye round.  Took longer than 5 hours I suppose because the pot was very full.  But flavor was awesome.

I've  been making this since 1979. My recipe calls for everything yours does except I use a whole small bottle of A1 steak sauce. This recipe makes its own gravy. I make mash potatoes and use the sauce as gravy. Take the cut up potatoes out. Always been a favorite in my household. Made it for friends over the years. They keep coming back for more.

The only change I made was adding the yellow and green zucchini  after  roast had been in crock pot  for 2 hrs.--this made the zucchini more firm.
My son is a big eater and loves left-overs so this only lasted a couple of days. If my  husband was still  alive (he passed away a yr ago)  it would have been gone the same day--this was a great Sunday dinner.

I make something similar.  Because I suffered from overkill on zucchini during the 10 year I lived in an Italian neighborhood, I do NOT include zucchini.   And instead of combining all the liquids specified, I use ONE Undiluted can of cream of mushroom soup, upon which I set the roast, surrounded by the veggies plus a few sticks of celery and a quartered onion; I then pour over the roast and veggies One Undiluted can of French onion soup and then sprinkle the dry contents of one envelope of dry onion soup/dip mix.  It gets raves.

It unfortunately is a poorly written recipe.  This recipe as written will produce a very bland meal.  Keep in mind that you can make adjustments  and I highly recommend that you do so for this recipe.

Preparing this meal was very easy and using the crockpot was easier.  I liked the way my meal turned out.  At first I was worried that the meat was not getting tender enough. In the end the meat was extremely tender and succulent.  I let my line cook for 2 hours at High I then put in my vegetables and cook it for another 4 hours on low.

A 2.5 lb piece of meat gave me plenty of leftovers as a single person.

Some helpful tips:
Do season the meat ( salt & pepper at least)
Do sear the meat
Do season the pot ingredients - think about garlic powder, garlic, red pepper flake, paprika, Italian herb, and any other herbs that you may like with this cut of meat
Do remember to peal your squah,zucchini and potatoes
Do wait 2-3 hours before putting squah, zucchini and carrots into the pot 


Have fun

I have two changes: I use Lipton Beefy Onion soup mix and I strain the dried onions out of it, then chop my own fresh onions in place of the dried onions.

This was a great starter pot roast. Folks who make it and don't like it should try modifying it with a bit of hot sauce, minced garlic, and just a little curry. I usually do not measure the things I add because I add them to taste. Try it, you'll like it!

It was delicious but I didn't add my veggies until the roast had cooked for 3 hours.   I also seared it first.  Also did not do the squashes.  As any of these recipes minor adjustments can be made without changing the integrity of the dish.

I'd like to recommend you just simply use chicken or beef stock one of those paper cartons instead of mushroom or chicken soup Save-A-Lot of the calories and allow the fat I always just buy a bag of Frozen vegetables and cut up a sweet onion and add some pepper and salt to the Crock-Pot TV coverage for 3 to 5 hours on either high or low and at the end you'll have a delicious soft beef dinner. If you want to get adventuresome cook bag of egg noodles separately drain well put your mother dish first and then do the beef on top with vegetables you don't have a goulash type dish

I used salt, pepper and garlic powder on the roast before browning it.  Also added a cup of beef broth and simmered in 300 degree oven for 3 hours, adding par-boiled veggies the last 45 minutes.

I´ve made this  exact recipe for many years (but minus the zucchini and yellow squash)...it is quite good! However, in recent years, I´ve added a small jar of fresh horseradish (4 oz) to the pot! You won´t believe the fragrance while it´s cooking and the marvelous flavor it imparts to the beef and veggies! It is no longer spicy, but a marvelous, and a fantastic addition to good old pot roast...that would be a 5 star winner for sure!

Easy and pretty good but, even with substituting red wine for half the water and beef stock for the other half, my family found it a little bland. Next time I will generously salt and pepper the beef before adding to the pot and add some cayenne pepper and garlic powder to the liquids before adding to pot.

This was an okay recipe for roast. I did use beef broth also instead of water. I thought the gravy lacked a more beefy flavor. I also seared my roast prior. I will make this again, but only use potatoes, carrots, & onion as my veggies & definitely beef the flavor of gravy up. The roast did have a great flavor & was tender. I also added onion, chopped garlic, & a meat rub before searing my roast.

This is on my favourites list. I brown my roast first. It makes the meat melt in your mouth tender. I also use round steak or London broil.

I only used 1/2 bag onion soup mix and adjusted the water as I had a smaller roast. I added about 3 cups of blue lake green beans and some jarred sliced mushrooms (next time I will use fresh 'shrooms). Browning the meat, to me, is essential (on both sides AND edges)! If you put to many veggies in (nearly up to the top) as I tend to do, just take the meat out @ 160 degrees and let the veggies sit in the "gravy" on warm until right for you.

I cannot say enough about how delicious this was. I did not use a 5 1/2 lb pot roast but lean 2 3/4 lb roast and there was plenty for 5 great sized meals. Based on other reviews, I left out the zucchini, but added a large sliced sweet onion, minced garlic and used double the carrots (wish I had used more) I also added some extra yellow squash and, instead of the water used 1 1/2 cups of beef broth. I cooked it on low for almost 9 hours (I work) and this was by far the best pot roast dish I have made and everyone who tasted it loved it. I even brought left overs to my office and the staff could not get over how great it smelled. I will make this over and over again!

Awesomely easy to make and forget!  Kudos for posting this one.  I had never heard of the onion soup mix and mushroom soup combo.  The family gave it 2 thumbs-up so I will be making it again and again.

I used a smaller roast for 2 of us. Then I braised the beef before adding to slow cooker. Added some worsteshire to the meat and replaced squash with mushrooms and celery.

This was so delicious, but I didn't buy the package of onion soup mix. I just mixed up my own using onion powder, onion salt and soy sauce. That eliminates all the preservatives and other yukky stuff found in those packages of dry soup mixes. It would be even better if you chopped up your own onions. Seriously good recipe otherwise.

I always use Golden Mushroom Soup instead of the Cream of Mushroom.  It has a much richer flavor and makes an awesome gravy combined with the Onion Mushroom Dry Soup.

A nice simple, quick-do recipe, but If you really want excellent flavor, making your own mushroom/onion cream soup/gravy is easy also.   Saute chopped onions in butter, add sliced fresh mushrooms After sauteing a minute or so, stir in a couple of tablespoons of flour and saute another couple minutes.  Stir in a mix of milk or cream and beef broth and cook stirring constantly until hot and bubbling. Season with salt and pepper.  Pour over your roast and veggies in the slow cooker.

This is an old but great recipe, especially for newly weds and inexperienced cooks. Easy-pezzee and you can't hardly mess it up. Substitute a can of cream of celery, get fancy and add a little wine, there's no end to what you can do and it will satisfy a hungry family. If your a beginner cook and you want to impress someone, go for this recipe.

My mom and I have made this same recipe since the 70's. The only difference  is we use only 1 can of mushroom soup. I've tweeked it over the years. I use mushroom and roasted garlic soup,  and put the onion and mushroom soups on top of the roast to keep it moist. When the roast is cooked, I turn it off and flip the roast over in the gravy, when it cools, I take it out, and add a can of beef consume` to the gravy to cook the veggies in. This lets you have plenty of room to submerge the veggies. I find the roast not only tastes better if you wait till the next day,  but it doesn't fall apart either when slicing. My husband loves it too.

I've been doing this for over 35 years, minus the squash and potatoes.  Carrots, yes.  We like mashed potatoes with our pot roast so I do them separately, and this makes a lot of gravy to have on the potatoes as well as everything else.

I saw this recipe on here last year and immediately made it!!! It is now my whole family’s favorite!! I make it all the time!! The gravy has the best flavor!  It’s the mushroom soup onion soup mix combo! I just substituted carrots for squash.

The cream of mushroom and onion soup mix made the gravy amazing.  This time I did not add the squash and zucchini because it just seemed strange but I might add it next time.

I hadn't made beef stew in probably 20 yrs. Came across this recipe awhile back and thought it would be a great fast fix. Through everything together this morning before the family got up.  (Only deviation was I added more broth.) I was able to enjoy Christmas morning without worrying about fixing lunch. Turned out great and even the kiddos like it!

Made this, but used 16-18 oz of stew beef cubed instead of a roast & added 2 1/2 cups of water instead of 1 1/4 cups. Made a great stew!

Fanastic- however, I was a little hesitant to use squash and zucchini, I substituted with other veggies for the first tine being made. I couldn't get enough of it! 
I'll be brave and try it with squash and zucchini next time!!

The gravy, in my opinion, needs some work.  I didn't find it very flavorful, but it was ok, and can be improved upon.  Other than that everything turned out great, and meat was tender.  I did add some worcestershire sauce, red wine and chicken broth instead of water, but will have to work in some more spices.

I cooked this roast for a COVERED DISH  in my slow cooker  for church today. It was delicious and all of it was eaten. The funny thing, I only had a 2 1/2 pound roast, but I used the same amount of added ingredients. It worked out beautifully. I served it with the roast cut up and as a Beef Roast Soup.

I thought it could have used less water.  Gravy was runny.  It was  very good though and I would make it again.  A little frozen corn would be nice.

This was delicious.  I put in the crockpot on low for 9 hours and the meat was so tender we didn't have to cut it with a knife.  The flavor was great too.

I followed the recipe , but  added a bunch of scallions and quart of beef stock. My wife and I both love onions, it added a lot of zest to the beef , veggies and especially the broth.

Easy, yields enough to enjoy leftovers and after school meals for a couple of day.  Can’t say it was the most favorable.  Didn’t taste bad but didn’t knock anyone out or inspire, “cook again” comments.

Cut this recipe in half since I had a not quite 3# roast. Changes I made were to stud roast with garlic, used more carrots, and  some sliced onion. Left out squashes and potatoes. Made mashed potatoes instead. Beef made great hash the next day!

I have been making this version of a pot roast for many years without the vegetables.  I tried putting vegetables in the with the pot roast and my family did not care for it.  They loved the pot roast and gravy without the vegetables.

I made this about a month ago and it was perfect.  
Now, I am making it again, but not for a crowd, so my roast is only a 2lb.  I am going to cut everything in half on the other ingredients.  Anyone have anything to add about cutting the ingredients in half?  I would like to get others opinions.

Very good flavor!I used heart healthy low sodium soup. I did add red onion for more flavor as well as a little kosher salt and pepper to the meat.  It tasted amazing.
