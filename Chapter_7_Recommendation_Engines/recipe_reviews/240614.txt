The taste reminds me of those wonderful chocolate-orange balls sold at stores during Christmas time. This is a real gourmet delight. The o.j. gives a perfect touch of orange flavor not too strong...just right. The cinnamon adds a bit of spice for a nice little finish. I made my own rich homemade hot chocolate instead of the package brand. Thanks Erica for sharing such a special treat.

I always like to add my own taste to the recipes i choose. This time i substituted the orange juice with orange zest and the chocolate powder with dark chocolate chunks and cheated with a bit of unsweetened cocoa powder. Turned out amazing as well ^.^

This is really special. It made me think of an expensive chocolate with an orange interior. The hint of orange and cinnamon are subtle but present. I will definitely be making this again!
