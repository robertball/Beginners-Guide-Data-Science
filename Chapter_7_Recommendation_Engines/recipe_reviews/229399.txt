Used just 2 cloves garlic and added one extra tbsp brown sugar which seemed to spike up the flavor.  Delicious!

Overall this salad was tasty. I do however believe that an entire cup of salad dressing would be too much for 6 servings, but i only made enough for myself, and adjusted the amount i made to taste. I used a yellow Bartlett pear, because that's what i had on hand, but would be tasty with any pear.I also omitted the pecans, and added extra almonds. I used shredded Havarti cheese with some cubes of sharp cheddar and added some slivers of red onion, because i love the contrast of that onion flavor with the sweetness of the cranberries. Its a great change from the typical salad, and reminds me of one you would order in a restaurant! Next time i will add a bit of Dijon mustard to the dressing.

This salad rocks! No need to change a thing! If anything double the mustard vinaigrette because people can’t get enough of it! My family says they want it at least once a week or they’re going to throw a fit. Simply a delicious salad that you can’t put down. I made some the next day and chopped up grilled chicken breast from the night before and it was a meal in itself.

Great salad and one I will make again. I was fortunate to have pear basalmic  vinegar in the cupboard which was an added bonus.

I used blue cheese crumbles, green onion, no sliced almonds instead of the cheese listed and spinach for greens.
I used 1/4 cup less oil but left the rest alone.

This salad rocks! I just love it!

Ever since making it for the first time 3 years, this has become our family's go-to salad for Thanksgiving and Christmas - and any other special dinner where we want a refreshing sweet/tangy salad to include in the meal. I usually make these few changes to adjust to our tastes. 1) Reduce oil to 1/2 cup. 2) Increase brown sugar to 2 or 3 Tablespoons. 3) Omit the onions and almonds. 4) Use candied or glazed pecans. 5) Increase the salad to 8+ cups. I always make ahead several hours (usually overnight) so the flavors really mix together. I've been asked for this recipe at each meal at which I've served it.

I halved the dressing and still didn't use it all.  Added a little basil and garlic salt to the dressing as well.  To the salad I added some red onion, and  goat cheese, and used chopped pecans and sliced almonds within browning. Turned out great!

I made it for Thanksgiving and it was well received.  All the different flavors blended well together.  I doubled the recipe and it could have served 20 as a side dish.

Made this for Thanksgiving & family loved it so much my sister-in-law asked me to bring it for Christmas.  I did use less olive oil,  as Chef V suggested, and added 1/2 cup nut-free seed mix (Mountain Mambo) because I didn't have almonds.

Made this salad for a family gathering to celebrate Dad's 81st birthday. Had to double the recipe but it turned out that I should have tripled it, everyone wanted more. It was absolutely delicious and so very easy to put together.

Too much olive oil . I just added more balsamic vinegar and a lot more brown sugar. I used honey glazed pecans. I did like the salad after I tweak it to my taste.
