We really enjoyed these. Even my 4 yr old picky eater liked them. I stuffed them with feta cheese- very yummy! They cooked very quickly, and sort of looked like fried chicken when done. Now I have something fun to make with all of the zucchini flowers from my veggie garden!

olive oil caused these to burn. When I used canola oil they came out much better...probably 3 and 1/2 stars.

I was so excited to try squash blossoms for the first time. However, this was a disappointment.  5 min is way too long on each side. I overcooked one side.  You will have to adjust to your own stove temperatures. I should have cooked it on medium instead or cooked at less time.  It only took about a min on each side to brown well.  We weren't all that crazy about the flavor.  In fact, my husband said it tasted like fish.  I think I will attempt another recipe next time.
