Soo good! I added a pinch of pepper and used a grated sweet onion, then put on the grill like a regular pancake. It only made 6 regular size pancakes so it left us wishing we had more!

DELICIOUS! I squeezed my zucchini dry instead of using the paper towels and added some garlic powder and black pepper to the mix. Also, I ised vidalia onion instead of green b/c that's what I had on hand. These came out great! Will def be making these again! Thanks for sharing. :)

This was pretty good.  I did as suggested in other reviews and added some herbs/spices.  The flavor was definitely there, but it was more cakey than I would have liked, I think there was too much batter.  I think next time I make it, I will leave out one egg and half of the flour so the zucchini is really the star.  Also, a tip whenever using zucchini - shred the zucchini and toss it with a bit of salt, then leave in a colander over a bowl in the fridge for 30-60 minutes, when you take it out from the fridge, squeeze the zucchini, and you'll be amazed how much water comes out.

Delish! I decided to make these because I didn't have  the ingredients for anything else, and I am so glad I did! Savory and simple.  I will be eating these for years to come!

Delicious! Used vidalia onion that I grated with the zucchini, also used pecorino roamno cheese instead of parmesan. Family loves these served with the sour cream as suggested or marinara sauce. Thanks for a great recipe!

I just tried this - yummy! Really excited to find this to use up some zucchini and really enjoy it! I did amend this by adding more onion and cheese - then some parsley, a touch of garlic powder and pepper. They fried up wonderfully and were very tasty, thank you for sharing!

Really good!  Make sure you cook in a skillet (not on a griddle) with hot oil so they crisp up.

I made 3 alterations: I sautéed half a diced onion before adding it to the batter (I didn't have green onions)and used 1/2 cup of bisquick & omitted the baking powder. I grated the zucchini onto cheesecloth and squeezed the water out. They were excellent!!

Very easy recipe to follow. We liked them, but they needed something! Next time I'll add a few more spices I think. Love the texture.

These were amazing! I tried them because I had a huge zucchini from my friends garden at home.....not much else. But boy will they be a staple from now on! Only change I did was add garlic salt instead of regular salt. DELISH! Thanks Suefood!

These were really good. Although, I have to admit I like Allrecipes zucchini patties recipe and another one of mine better. Only reason being is these were more of a floury type. Others are more heavy on the zucchini, cheese, and onions. What I liked about these though is they cooked up so nicely. There was not sticking and they just kept such a nice roundish shape and even browning. If you have a Vitamix, or similar high-speed blender, I highly suggest sticking 2" or so pieces of zucchini, in the machine, filling it with water, and processing it that way. It takes only 10 seconds, or so, on low, to shredded zucchini. I drained well pressing out the water, in the strainer, and then again patted dry with a paper towel. I made 1.5 times the recipe and it took 2 small/medium sized zucchini for 3 cups. I was able to cook them in 2 batches in an ex-large sauté pan I have with tall sides. First batch was 7 patties and the second was 6. I used a #16, or muffin scoop, for portioning.  For the oil I just used 2 tablespoons of grape seed oil divided between the two batches and cooked them on temperature 6 on my stove. First batch was 3 minutes per side and then flipping twice more for 2 minutes per side. Second batch was the same, but second flipping was 1 minute per side once the pan was hot. I got 13 total with 1.5 times the recipe. I did the calorie calculation, as made, and it came to 75 calories per patty! ty

I love these!  Even my 3 year old whom hates vegetables loves these.  I was even able to make them gluten free by using a 1/2 cup King Arthur Flour all purpose baking mix.  I also added fresh ground pepper, herbamare/seasoned salt and garlic powder.  it's hard not to eat them all myself!

Loved this recipe. My husband loved it (and he is not a fan of zucchini) and my daughter really liked it too. My son is very picky and didn't care for it. I only had a sweet onion on hand, so I grated a little bit of that into the zucchini mix (was about 1 1/2 Tbsp). We really enjoyed the crunchy edges. I set out ranch, ketchup, and sour cream as the options to serve with it. A keeper for sure. Thanks for sharing.

These were so good! I used egg beaters instead of eggs and squeezed the zucchini to get the water out, but those are the only things I did differently. Excellent recipe and a keeper!

I’ve made them before, but as fritters, this time I did the pancake version, really good.  I didn’t have green onion so I grated a red onion along with garlic powder. Rather than using oregano, I replaced it with a dry french seasoning called persillade. I usually serve a side salad with it, but I was too hungry so I sliced up an avacado.  I put a dollop of sour cream on them.  That was my lunch for both my mom and I.  My mom gobbled them up, which was a joy for me to see as she usually has a little appetite,  but they had so much flavor that it really appealed to her.  I love this recipe because it’s so versatile and it can be a main dish or side as well as for brunch or a light dinner.  I hope others try it as it’s a really nice dish.  Enjoy!

Hmmm...these are a solid no for me. I did drain the zucchini as recommended and other than that I followed the recipe. I also used freshly grated parm. These are too soft, I was expecting a crispier texture and it needed a little something extra to juxtapose all the savory elements. I did try several batches and although they came out with varying textures the flavor remained the same and at its base that's what I'm not a fan of. Glad to see other people liked this!

I subbed in wheat flour for the white, and used this as a lower-carb, higher-fiber alternative to potato pancakes.

I followed recipe but used mandolin slicer on medium to small size zuchinni and coarsely chopped after slices vs shredding.  Liquid was not a problem this way.  Brushed a pan with minimal olive oil and baked at 400 vs fry.  Very good and will definitely make again.

I added a bit of grated onion to the zucchini and used seasoned salt. It came out really good. I would have added a bit more spice, however I was cooking for picky kids so this was great as is. Getting the zucchini dry was a bit of a hassle. I ended up grating about 1/3c more zucchini because I was losing so much as it kept sticking to the paper towels. However, the results were worth the extra work. I got my picky kid to eat zucchini without resorting to bribery.

We loved these but used grated onion instead of green onion because that's what was on hand and we like the savory flavor it adds. I might use  another cup of zucchini in order to increase the zucchini to batter ratio next time. 
I used a griddle and less oil and  because we didn't want them real crispy.
Made twice in one week because it's zucchini season in my garden and had leftovers cold with my lunch too.
This recipe is a keeper!

This is a foolproof recipe. There is no need to tweak anything about it. I cooked mine on an electric skillet because I wanted to cook them all at one time instead of batches. They turned out fantastic!   I used a quarter cup measure for each pancake, this yielded six nice sized pancakes.

This recipe is not just for zucchini!  I've made it a bunch of times with a variety of veggie combos.  Tonight instead of zucchini and green onion, I used eggplant, green pepper and a shallot.  So good!  Kids gobble them up as fast as I can cook them.

Very easy to make, added more Parmesan  and garlic powder. Makes about 10 small to medium pancakes. Very yummy! Feeds about 3 people.

Holy mother of zucchini! Had no green onion; added onion powder and a pinch of black pepper for flavor, and my family was blown away! My picky 2 year old, who mistrusts all vegetables, devoured his first and immediately asked for another. No sour cream on top, either. This recipe is absolutely going into our regular rotation!

Wow!  I added 1/8t of chili powder, 1/4t of garlic powder and a carrot and blended everything to a chunky batter. Served it with sour cream and pico de gallo for a savory breakfast.  Super easy and tasty.

Awesome recipe!  I did add a bit more spices including a pinch of cayenne.  It was perfect!  I also took another users idea and used grated onion instead of green onion slices.

Awesome recipe. I too used regular onion in place of the green onion (diced fine and 1/4 cup) and added black pepper.
If for more than two people, I highly recommend doubling the recipe. We were fighting over the last one!

I accidentally submitted before finishing my review.  Do not press ‘done’ thinking it’s the return key!   Anyway, a lifetime of potato latkes and one big zucchini to use up and I tried these tonight.  Used same ingredients but tweaked to utilize the decades of latke experience.  My changes are:  I shredded the zucchini and 1/4 small Visalia onion and squeezed it dry.  Added pepper, onion powder and mixed well and thoroughly with large fork to fully be corporate the flour.  A huge trick to crispy latkes (potato pancakes) is to get the oil really hot and to only turn the latke once... some people use a too low heat for fear of burning and keep flipping them.. don’t!  They will get soggy and not crisp up.  I followed my own advice and used super hot oil, flipped only once and they turned out absolutely delicious, crisp and will be a great way to add more zucchini into our meals.  (Not a huge fan of their normally bland taste).   I will definitely be using his recipe again (with my little adjustments).

I've been making zucchini pancakes for years and I have always loved them. After reading the reviews, I substituted potato flakes for the flour and I served the green onions as a garnish. Now my whole family loves them. They were a big hit. I served them with fresh pasta, red sauce and Parmesan cheese!

Omit the salt (too salty), add more parmesan cheese and onion for better flavor.  Use less oil.

Love these! I’ve made them a couple times & like this revipe better with a grated a sweet onion instead of the green onions. I have also made them with some left over corn on the cob added. Great w/sour cream & salsa too! Always make a double batch now since we enjoy them so much & sometimes have a few left for lunch the next day! Yum!

These were easy to make VEGAN and turned out fantastic! I substituted each egg for a "flax seed egg" (1 tbsp ground flax + 3 tbsp water = 1 egg), and  replaced the Parmesan cheese with nutritional yeast seasoning. They were absolutely delicious!

I made it per the recipe except for squeezing the grated zucchini by hand.  This was a big hit with my wife and myself. This will be made  again, many times. A great side dish.

These were amazing!!  I did tweak the recipe a bit, I live in New Mexico where green chili, not peppers or jalapeños, is almost exclusively grown here.  It is also a staple in most New Mexican's meals and it being harvest there is plenty of it around.  I added a couple tables spoons of chopped roasted chili and used about a half cup of Panko bread crumbs to compensate for the added moisture from the chili. I also added about a 1/2 C shredded Colby/cheddar cheese.  My husband whom is not very fond of veggies loved them as did I! I highly recommend trying this recipe and feeling free to add to it

Added 1 cup of left over grilled corn that I cut off of the cob and about 1/2 tsp black pepper. The oregano added a surprising flavor!  Will definitely make this as a must each zucchini season.

This was delicious.  Great way to use up extra zucchini.  I didn't add the cheese or oregano.  I grated about 1/4 cup onion instead of green onion.  It is basically the same as potato pancakes, but just using zucchini instead. I will make again.

Made these as a side dish to london broil last night.  They were delicious!  Great reheated in the toaster oven served with a dollop of sour cream.  I have another zucchini, so I'll be making another batch for the fridge to have on hand for an easy snack.  Thank you!  This one is definitely a "keeper".

Delicious… I edited the recipe slightly.  I added a quarter teaspoon of sugar.  Instead of oregano , I use Parsley and instead of so much onion fresh, I used onion powder and garlic powder to reduce the moisture.

Salt the grated zucchini and allow to sit in a colander for an hour. Rinse well and then spin in a salad spinner or squeeze by hand or in cheesecloth to get rid of the extra liquid

Just picked some zucchini from the garden and found this recipe. Very quick to make.  Made according to the directions except I squeezed the zucchini to get more water out, and I ended up cooking them longer (I think my spoonfuls were too big). Delicious! And I'm happy to have something other than zucchini bread to make with my crop.

I took other reviewers suggestions and livened things up a bit--added a generous pinch of red pepper flakes and 2 gloves of freshly grated garlic with the onion. Served with lemon wedges.  Really good!

While I will eat zucchini, I rarely truly enjoy it. These were DELICIOUS! I did add a bit of garlic powder and basil along with the oregano. They are good by themselves, but even better with the sour cream. My incredibly picky husband LOVES them! These are now in my recipe box, because I will be making them again.

Great way to use up zucchini. I cooked it like a pancake and coated the pan with olive oil. Half the recipe made 3 pancakes. Easy to make and you can get veggies in at breakfast. Love it.

This was  something I never tried before but I had very much zucchini in my garden so I thought I'd give it a try.   We just loved  it and I now made it serveral times.

Loved it. I think I had the heat on a bit too high because some of them cooked on the outside but were mushy on the inside. I will make again today and put the heat a little lower.

I added a tablespoon more flour (I used gluten free) to absorb some of the moisture.  Added 1/2 tsp of black pepper and 1/2 teaspoon of garlic salt for flavor.  My daughter added extra cheese to hers while cooking.  Dipped in marinara, pesto, aioli - all great!  Great for breakfast with a poached egg on top and a bit of avocado.

I made these last night as a side with dinner using zucchini from my garden. Because I'm trying to stay away from white flour I used brown rice flour instead. They were delicious! In fact I doubled the recipe thinking I would freeze half for another time but there weren't many left.
Really good!

These are yummy!  I always put my grated squash and put in a bowl and salt for about 10 minutes.  It helps draw out the moisture.  Then pat dry, and followed the recipe exactly from that point on:)  The sour cream was just a perfect compliment.

This is the best Zucchini pancake recipe! Delicious. I did make a mistake. I put the oil into the batter, but it urned out just fine. I used extra virgin olive oil instead of vegetable oil and regular onions. I will try to follow the recipe again without error!

I added other seasonings and made sure they were flat when I fried them so they were browned and drier.  I use them as breakfast pancakes with syrup.  Really good.

Delicious, and easy.  I made exactly as written with one exception.  I added 2 tsp of garlic powder by mistake.  They were delicious!  Great way to use zucchini out of the garden, and I found they reheated very well the next day.  I may even try freezing them next time for a quick dinner side dish in the future.  Thank you, Mom!

They are very tasty. We ate them as pancakes and as hamburger patty substitutes.

I add no salt, like 10x more green onion, and only do 1/4tsp baking powder.

Nice quick recipe when you have a food processor to shred the zucchini!  This is a healthier version of other recipes I have used and loved.  This is our main dish served with a salad and feeds two as written for serving 5.  I replaced the salt with garlic salt and used a little less than called for.  Also added a little pepper.  Thanks!

Yum! So easy, light, and crispy. I used olive oil to fry them up and added some garlic powder, but it was essentially the same recipe. I’d been making zucchini potato pancakes for years, but I realize that I didn’t need potato and the scallions are better than the yellow onion I had used. My new favorite for a lunch or with breakfast. I think I might be able to get my picky eater son to love these.

Delicious! I used yellow squash because that’s what I had on hand, and I added a little more flour because I was worried it looked too wet before cooking. They turned out delicious, especially with some Siracha mayo!

I was excited to try these but have to admit I was disappointed.  Made as directed.  Not much flavour.  My husband and I had to put ketchup on just for some flavour.  The pancakes would not hold together.  I had to cook much longer than recipe said.  The outside was cooked but not inside.  I wouldn’t make these again, sorry

I have used this recipe many times and it's always good. Recently I got an air fryer and thought I would try an experiment. I fried two of the pancakes in olive oil in a cast-iron pan as usual and the other two I put in the air fryer with a little spray of olive oil. I set the air fryer on 390 for 18 minutes and flipped them to brown the other side for 5 minutes. They were brown, crispy on the outside and perfectly cooked on the inside.  I had only used one egg in the batter because that's all I had and didn't drain the zucchini. They held together better than ever. I'll be making them in the air fryer from now on.

I am saving this one. I wanted something different for Shrove Tuesday. When my husband and son heard dinner was zucchini pancakes and salad, their reaction was less than enthusiastic. Well, that changed as soon as they tasted these pancakes. The look of surprise, wow these are fantastic! Wish you had made more! My son wants the recipe too! Seriously good recipe.

I made it basically as the recipe was written.  I squeezed the zuc pretty dry and added a pinch of red pepper and had to use Spanish onions because that is what  I had.  They were wonderful, served them with sour cream. Yummy !!!  I will make these for many years to come.  Thank you for sharing your recipe.

The zucchini pancakes could've been better if we added less flour because the recipe called for 2 cups. What made the pancakes taste dry instead of crispy is the baking powder& flour. I couldn't taste the zucchini.   Instead of adding a teaspoon of salt I added a pinch. I like things to be more sweet then sour. Instead of using a green onion I used a sweet onion. All in all,  the pancakes were eatable& ehhh average.

my family really appreciated these patties/pancakes and gobbled them up in no time, as promised by "mom" (and they are picky, I guarantee). I  forgot the onion, and grated the zucchinis so thinly that to pat them with paper to get the extra moisture out was nealy impossible; I gota lot of soggy paper and after a while I had to put dinner on the table so I decided to give it a go regardless. But they were good, relly good: soft on the inside a somewhat crisp on the outside. Also, a different trick to have them eat vegetables. TY!

These were the best zucchini pancakes I've ever made. The batter was the perfect consistency. I didn't have green onions so I finely chopped a red onion and used the specified amount and it wasn't too onion-y. I doubled the recipe and I was so happy I did because our fam of 4 ate them all up!

These were wonderful. We made one slight change  of adding salt to the zucchini after shredding and let it sit for 10 minutes. Everyone loved them.

Made the recipe exactly as written, and they're really good. To the reviewers who say these are too "cakey", remember, these are pancakes, they're supposed to be "cakey"! If you're looking for something crispier, look for a zucchini fritter recipe, there isn't as much flour in those.  I'll definitely be making these again.

These zucchini pancakes are great!  The baking powder makes them nice and light. I added some leftover sweet corn that I needed to use up and that was really good. This recipe will become part of my regular zucchini repertoire.

I used 1-1/2 cups of zucchini and slid back the other ingredients accordingly.  I would use a little more salt next time for taste but overall, it's a keeper!

Can make it in one bowl.  One shredded zucchini seems to equal 2 cups shredded .

A lot of work, but very good. I used a pinch of chilli flakes. Could use more of a kick. Maybe some pepper is a good idea. I also made a yogurt- garlic sauce. This really worked well. I highly suggest it .

These were delicious, quick and simple.  I added some shredded sweet onion, garlic, pepper and Italian herbs.  Served it with some marinara sauce, which was perfect.  Will definitely be making this for years to come!

Oh these were so good.  I doubled the recipe and made bigger pancakes and very yummy.   left out the onion but will try the recipe again and use the onions.  I have found a better way to use the zucchini that I somehow keep ignoring in my refrigerator.

Insulin pump requires me to look for low-carb items to keep a leash on the numbers. Here are the changes I made to the recipe to suit my needs.
Increase zucchini to 3 cups 
Increase eggs to 3 each
Substitute equal parts coconut flour for AP flour
Add 1/4 cup heavy cream

Served with whipped cream cheese

Great classic.  Made mine without green onion because didn't want to go to store.  Were still good, but would have been great as listed.  Excellent way to use up that extra zucchini, especially since you can shred and freeze for later use.

These turned out great! Used whole wheat flour instead, otherwise stuck to the recipe.  I followed the suggestion to toss the zucchini with salt and strain in the fridge with a bowl under it. It really did work well to get a lot of the water out.

This is fantastic! I didn't have green onions so I used red onions (next time I'd shred them as other suggested). Also didn't have sour cream, but it would have been better, so I had it with butter salt and pepper. DELICIOUS!

Excellent side dish!  You need to get the water out of the zucchini by putting in a strainer and blotting with paper towels.  I added some extra seasoning to taste- think garlic, fresh parsley, etc.  I did salt the zucchini as it was draining and then added more to taste.  Plus i used bread crumbs and flour to get it to the right consistency... this was a little tricky.  Rolling the mixed balls in flour/ bread crumbs and then allowing them to set in the fridge for 10-15min worked wonderfully.

Delicious!  I made this with my mom and we loved it!  The whole family loved it!  We substituted red onions for green onions and added jalapeño peppers.  We also substituted basil for the oregano because we didn't have any.  It was great and we can't wait to make it again!

WONDERFUL!  Easy!  Quick!  I used basil instead of oregano, since I'm not fond of oregano -- they were great!

Made these at home and let the zucchini sit with the chives that I substituted for about 6 hours - delicious!

I used them as buns for open faced burgers... as I agree with MIGHTISARAH they were way too cakie, not a whole lot of flavor, but I was so excited to use up my giant zucchini that I didn't take the time to read others comments.  Cooked them on the grill for a minute or two to crisp up, and they looked great.
