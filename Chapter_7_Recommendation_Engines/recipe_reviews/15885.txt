My father wanted a peach custard pie, so I found this recipe and gave it a try.  I followed the directions exactly as written, and the pie was delicious.  I will definitely make it again.

About peeling peaches, I also do this for potatoes, put them in a pot of boiling water for a few minutes. Take out and place in cold water. The peels will come right off in your hands by just rubbing them a little. This only works with well ripened peaches. (Which is what your going to cook with anyway.)

This was an extremely east recipe to make. The hard part for me was peeling the peaches - they're slippery!!  I can't really judge the "Kids" part as I had no kids to try it on. Also, I mixed the milk, egg, sugar, flour & spices together in one bowl to cut down on dishes. It worked just fine.

I changed this into Peach/apple custard pies! and they were great! 1. I made a double recipe of Crisco shortening pastry but didn't have quite  enough Crisco to make up the required 2 cups so used about 1/4 to 1/3 cup (combined) of Becel Margarine and butter to make up the difference. So in total 2 cups 'fat' blended with 4 cups all-purpose flour. Whisk together, 2 eggs, 4 Tbsp cold water, 2 Tbsp white vinegar, 1 1/2 tsp salt and add to flour mixture.  This was to yield 2  9" pie shells and 2 lids. I divided the dough into 4 balls for refridgeration and found that only 2 balls rolled out enough pastry for 3 pie shells (bottoms). The dough was a little sticky but once you add flour to your board for rolling, the texture was just right and you didn't have to be stingy with the flour thinking that it would make the dough too tough. I refridgerated this overnight but an hour is fine just to chill the dough. 2. I sliced up 5 or 6 small ripe peaches (moon shaped)as well as 1 large 'Pink Lady' apple and 1 smaller 'Ida Red' apple (cut into small pcs. about the size of my thumb nail and as thick as three nickels.  I placed them in a container with approx. 4 oz orange/tangerine juice to keep them from discolouring with a tight fitting lid and could toss them to cover all the fruit.  3. Being as I was intending to make two pies initially, I also doubled the custard ingredients. I blended 2 cans (each 375 ml) Carnation Evaporated milk with 2 eggs, 1 1/3 cup white sugar, 1 tsp cinnamon, 1

I found using halfed peaches made for uneven custard to peach ratio. Some bites were all peach, some all custard. Also, the exposed peach bits dried out and the spinkled topping did not absorb into them making for an odd texture. If I were to make it again I'd cut the peaches much smaller.

I made the peach pieces a little smaller, rather than halving.  Also, this took 50 minutes to cook, not 30 for me.  Great recipe. Enjoyed!

I sliced the peaches and didn't peel them, it worked fine.  I would say add some salt to bring out the peach sweetness. Very easy recipe, very good.

We liked this pie, and the fact that it wasn't too bad fat- and calorie-wise for a slice of pie. Sweetness was just right.  Used another reviewer's suggestion of brushing the unbaked pie shell with egg - baked crust was perfect, not soggy at all.

I did not peel the peaches and sliced them instead of halving them.  Everyone loved this pie and requested more.  I am making two today, since the first one went so quickly.

I used frozen pie shells which cooked up fine. But, I found that there was too much liquid using the 1.5 cups of evaporated milk. Also, I cut the peaches into slices, otherwise I made it as per recipe with a touch of salt as someone noted. My peaches are really ripe and juicy! The end result is very tasty~

Although the pie turned our having a good flavor, the sugar mixture on top of the pie never did anything. I expected it to soak into the filling and turn into a sugary topping. It just sat there and turned a powdery brown. The pie was no where done in 30 minutes, so I took it out and tried to mush the topping into the filling, but that didn't work. I made with peaches and only needed 3 peaches, sliced. Even with fewer peaches, the deep dish pie shell was over filled with the liquid.  Pie was done after a total of 50 minutes and the flavor was nice. Made with peaches, but any fruit would do.

Other than cutting the peaches in to slices, The pie was built as the recipe called, but it was quite a disaster. There was much too much milk and egg mixture which boiled over so thankful I lined pans to put the pie plate on. There was way too much sugar and flour sprinkled on top of the pie. I definitely will not use this recipe again.

Nope! Followed the recipe and did not care for it. We had juicy sweet July peaches that were entirely masked by WAY too much cinnamon and spice. I wish I had made a classic fruit pie or more of a vanilla flavored custard but this mixture tasted medicinal from the nutmeg and more like a Pumpkin Pie base poured over perfectly good peaches.

I have never had peach custard pie before, just thought it looked interesting since I love peaches.  I was not a fan.  It turned out just like it should have though.
