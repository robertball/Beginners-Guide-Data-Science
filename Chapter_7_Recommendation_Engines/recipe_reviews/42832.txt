Nice texture and taste. The pumpkin flavor was very subtle, and I felt it could have used more pumpkin pie spice. The bread is just slightly sweet, and would be perfect to serve with Thanksgiving dinner.

It's a solid bread recipe, but no flavor. Not only no pumpkin or brandy flavor, but really, no flavor to set it apart from white bread.

People who pitch a fit about reviews made on an altered recipe, do not read further.
whiskey. I also don't keep pumpkin pie spice, so used my usual spices for pumpkin pie: cinnamon, ginger, cloves, nutmeg. Per 1/2 cup of pumpkin, it's 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon and 1/4 teaspoon of the remaining three. I like this recipe. Good toasted for breakfast. Try it with something along the lines of cinnamon-honey butter. It's also good if you want to toss in dried fruit (cranberries, dates, or raisins) and chopped, toasted pecans (or whatever nut you prefer). I'm definitely keeping the recipe. It worked very well on the white bread setting. I admit to being somewhat confused about why the directions give the option of either the basic or the sweet bread setting. This is not a sweet bread recipe. na ja.

Followed the recipe but used 2 Tsp whiskey and allspice instead of pumpkin pie spice. Don't expect a sweet dessert. Using the machine setting in the recipe, the bread came out VERY nicely, cut easily, and held its shape. The bread is not dense and not fluffy, but still light. The taste is a low-key pumpkin, more spiced pumpkin instead of all sugary. I am going to try a cina-butter on it for when I want it a little sweeter!

I really liked it. Glad I read a few of the others reviews first as I added twice as much pumpkin spice and I was quite pleased.

I just made this, and it's really awesome, although my bread looks, well, homemade, I  left 1/2 cup of flour sitting on my counter,, but who cares, I'm not showing it around, this one is solely for me to eat, to enjoy.

I made some changes to this recipe so I can eat it without concern for diabetes.  

Let's Beginn;
First to the Butternut Squash, getting it ready for the dough is not for the faint of heart.  A carpenter with an electric saw would have been great. I had the biggest Squash to work with, a monster. A friend did the shopping for me that's how I became the proud owner of an eight pound butternut squash,  yikes!  
I read all the recommendations on how to cut/prepare butternut squash and not losing my fingers. These are some of the recommendation;   -Cut into three pieces,  -cut lengthwise, 
- bake for an hour,  - cook in microwave,  -cut a hole or -and something with paper towels,
They all sounded daunting and even dangerous to me, goodness, probably  they work well with small Butternut Squash, but, mine was from a different universe.

I couldn't decide, so I decided to try the first suggestion,; 
cut length wise.  Mercy Thelma-Louise!   I couldn't see  this eight inch long eight pounder cut lengthwise. I don't have a knife that long,  and am just too old to play with knives and oversized squash. Just considering that adventure made me shudder.
On to the next recommendation:  cut into three pieces then cook in microwave turning the squash every three minutes. fo

I enjoyed the bread and there was just enough hint of pumpkin to satisfy me. Was great spreading butter on bread and leftover puree. I cooked mine on basic medium and did like the crust although next time I will dry on light side. I would make this again.
