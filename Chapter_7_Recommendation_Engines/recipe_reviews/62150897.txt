These were awesome. I usually don't care much for beans and only make them because my wife likes to have some on the side whenever we have tacos or enchiladas. But adding the Taco Seasoning and the combo of mashed beans and unmashed really made this side dish the star of the show. I will definitely make these again and again whenever I make any sort of Mexican or Spanish main dish. Thanks so much for the recipe. Hope you make it back home soon :D
