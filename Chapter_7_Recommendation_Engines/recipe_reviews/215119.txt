I used a frozen banana which eliminated the need for ice. I also did not add any extra sugar. I thought this was good--the kids did not like it though. I'd make this again for me.

This was yummy! Mine had more of a banana flavor than apricot but that could have been the size of the apricots. I only used 3 t of sugar to save on the calories and it turned out super. Thanks for the fun treat!

This is more of a milkshake rather than a smoothie even thought I did add extra ice. The banana flavor totally overwhelmed the mild apricots. All I could taste was banana and sweetness. In spite of that it still was good but doubtful I'd make again.
