Easy to make. Great way to use those leftovers. I loved it but my kids didn't eat much. (My kids are picky eaters anyway, so they don't count.) I would definitely recommend this to anybody wanting to make a Tetrazzini!

Excellent and easy recipe to make.  I used leftover Thanksgiving turkey, preparing everything the night before so all that had to be done was bake it the next night for dinner.  I left out the salt as the broth was salty enough.  I used two small cans of mushrooms as I was out of fresh.  Also, I put a layer of french fried onion rings on the top for the last 5 minutes of baking and that provided a wonderful flavor and texture.  Definitely do that!  Also, I baked it at 375 instead of 400 which seemed a bit high.  Finally, I used a 16 ounce box of angel hair pasta but had much of it left over after filling the 13x9" baking dish.  So the unused cooked spaghetti provides a starter for another meal!

very good! I added 1 more clove of garlic and black pepper to add more flavor.  A combination of cheeses adds more depth to the dish- very good for a freeze-ahead meal.

I didn't love this... but may try again with different spices, make the sauce a bit differently. The recipe has potential.

My family took a vote:  we all agreed that this is the weirdest thing we've ever tasted.  Thank you for the idea, but I think we're going to stick with  sandwiches to use up the turkey.

Luckily I sampled it before I put it into the oven. For our tastes it was too bland.  I added a few tablespoons of "Chef Pauls magic salt free seasoning" It's a great all purpose blend to kick up the flavor-Made a big difference.

Sorry but I am probably pushing it with 3 stars.  This did serve the purpose of using the leftover turkey up but it was very bland and not saucy enough.  My family did not really want to eat it and we did not even keep the leftovers.  I followed the recipe exactly so it must just be our tastes!

My family loved this.  It was a great way to use up our leftover turkey.  I am going to make this for a work potluck.

very tasty and easy way to use dark meat leftovers! i topped with leftover french fried onions and this enhanced the flavors.
