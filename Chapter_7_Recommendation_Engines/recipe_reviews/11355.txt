I cut this recipe in half, back to 36 servings. No shortening on hand today, I used half butter/half margerine instead. I also ran my oats through the mini food processor for a finer consistancy. Baked at 350*, my cookies were done at just about 9 minutes. I let them cool on the baking sheet for a minute or so to let them firm up before I pulled them off of the baking sheet, just so that they wouldn't break apart. These look wonderful and taste even better. I loved that I didn't have to chill the dough, it was ready to go right out of the mixer. Great little cookie recipe!

This cookie contains everything except the kitchen sink!  I re-calculated the serving size to 18 and wish I had made more.  They are delicious - the different textures create a pleasant tasting experience - they are chewy, sweet, crunchy, crispy, nutty and bake up to a beautiful golden color.  I used a small cookie scoop and scooped  the dough onto parchment lined baking pans.  I baked for 10 minutes at 350 degrees, allowed them to cool and then lifted them right off the paper.  This is a keeper and next time I make them, I may add a few dried cherries or cranberries and chocolate chips.  This recipe has unlimited possibilities and I'm glad I found it.  Thanks Vonieta Sogner for sharing!

These are yummy cookies! I used margarine instead of shortening, and regular oats instead of quick cooking. Also, I didn't have parchment paper, but I wish I did because they are very hard to remove. I tried grease and aluminum foil, but they both worked only so-so. I also omitted the nuts for my husband's sake, and they were yummy. May try adding raisins next time. Very sweet, flat, chewy cookie. Enjoy!

This is a delicious cookie! I made this cookie last weekend. I enjoy trying a new cookie each time that I bake along with an old stand-by. I wasn't sure how it was going to turn out with the shortening instead of butter, but it works. The shortening and sugar do not really "cream" together. They blend into a grainy mixture. I mixed the rest of the ingredients with ease. 

These cookies came out of the 350* oven soft as described in the recipe. I left them on the baking sheet for about 10 minutes before moving to a cooling rack. Make sure to let them rest for a little because they will fall apart otherwise. 

Wow! These cookies are so chewy and have so many textures. A few people thought that they had toffee in them. They loved the name too! My boyfriend is a big Chocolate Chip fan, but found these to be delicious. My co-workers enjoyed these immensely. A few people sought me out for more! 

I will make these again!

This cookie recipe is my favourite one on this website.  I have made it for every picnic and party this summer and everyone just raves about them.  A number of people have said that they are the best cookies they ever tasted!  A word of caution, the orginal recipe makes a lot of cookies, but don't worry, they won't last long!  You'll love them!

These cookies are fantastic!  I altered the recipe slightly: I took advice from other reviews and reduced both sugars to 3/4 cup each, I used 1/2 cup butter and 1/2 cup butter flavored shortening, I used old fashioned oats instead of quick oats, and I had to add 1 cup of milk chocolate chips to help with my chocolate addiction.  They turned out perfectly!  Great recipe.

these were nothing special. they are not very chewy ( i did not over-bake and am storing in airtight container). Also they are way too sweet in my opinion. If you are looking for a coconut cookie then the "chewy coconut cookie" recipe on this site is better and if it's oatmeal cookies you are after there are tonnes of good  recipes to use. I won't be making these again.

This is the recipe of my favorite chewy coconut cookie from childhood. I finally found it!!! I would have never known by the name of it. My mom told me the night I made it that her recipe was from a school or church cookbook she had and they were called Ranger Cookies. I am so happy I found it! And everybody loves it! It freezes well too.(Doesn't taste stale once thawed like Nestle chocolate chip cookie package recipe. I have to test all my cookie recipes for freezing after that disappointment.)

I loved them. I pretty much made them exactly as the directions said and had no problems. They are very chewy and delicious. I did leave out about 1/4 cup of sugar.

These are great tasting cookies and have all the same ingredients as a "Ranger Cookie".  I believe next time I will add an additional cup of flour.

Delicious cookies!  Substituted real butter for shortening, used almond extract instead of vanilla, substituted Honey Bunches of Oats for the rice cereal and used whole oats instead of quick cooking.   Great hit, baked to perfection and will make these again!

My daughter made these for our Christmas Day get together.  I thought they tasted familiar (very good) and then compared to the Ranger Cookies that I had in the 50s, same recipe except Rangers have 1 cup more flour, Rangers area also called Cowboy Cookies and go back to the 20s and 30s..no matter their name, they are an excellent cookie.  Daughter used butter instead of shortening also, and no pecans (kinda pricey right now).

Loved this recipe, just used margarine instead of the shortening, and added a little almond extract as well.  Nice texture, great taste, will make again!  Thanks
