I have maded this lasagna several times it is a hit in my home. I make a few changes for my taste but ill share with everyone. I use 1 container of ricotta and 1 container of cottage chesse large curd instead of the 2 containers of ricotta. I also add cooked ground beef 1 lb to the sause mixture along with a little shredded chesse.

This turned out great! I added 1 -10 o pkg of chopped frozen spinach (thawed) to the cheese mixture and also only used 3 noodles per layer. Definitely a keeper!

This is the first lasagna I've ever made and it turned out very well. I added spinach to give it some more substance and it tasted wonderful.

This is a great recipe.  You can add anything to it that is your favorite!  I added shredded chicken and fresh spinach.  It was sooooo good!!  I also substituted 1 container of cottage cheese for the ricotta.  Not sure what a difference it made - but this was fantastic!  (I did add a few italian spices to the ricotta cheese mixture just for some added flavor).  Good!!!!

I've only made lasagna one other time and it turned out runny. This was great! Very simple! I followed the recipe to the "T" except I used the 'oven ready' lasagna noodles. I will make it again, but next time I will add some ground beef or sausage and probably substitute one of the containers of ricotta cheese with cottage cheese.
