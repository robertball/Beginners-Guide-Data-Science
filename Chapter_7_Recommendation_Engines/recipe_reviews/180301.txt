This dip is quick to make and it's pretty good. Only thing I didn't care for was the garlic seemed to overpower the other flavors in this. I LOVE garlic too, never thought there was a such thing as too much. It actually burned a bit, that's how strong the garlic seemed. I can't figure it out being it's only one clove. Be sure to chill this about 2 hours before serving, because the flavors seemed to be much better. I served this with red and green tortilla chips, very pretty for the holidays. I will try this again using less garlic or garlic powder. Thanks :)

LOVE THIS quick and easy dip! Made it last wknd and making it again today! I add an extra clove of garlic and I don't include the chives (just for lack of not finding any).  It is still delicious!  I serve it w/mini slices of garlic/oregano seasoned toasted bread (pre-packaged).

I had some left over cream cheese from Panera Bread which we were not going to be able to use before it expired so I decided to try this out with it.  It turned out great!  I had a little bit of plain cream cheese and some of their sun dried tomato one which I combined with low fat mayonnaise.  I used slightly more than one clove of garlic because all the cloves in the bulb were small and it didn't seem like too much to me.  I also used dried chives from my spice cabinet because I didn't have fresh ones and didn't want to make a special trip to the store just for them.  I highly recommend this, it turned out wonderful and was so easy to whip together!
