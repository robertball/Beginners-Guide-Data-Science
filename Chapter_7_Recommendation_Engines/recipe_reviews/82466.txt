This was pretty good. I tweaked it a bit by adding a little soy sauce, lemon juice, milk, curry powder, and some sugar to the dressing.  I used light mayo as a base, but used a lot less than a cup and used honey mustard instead of yellow.  I also doubled the tuna, but I wished I had used chicken instead. I didn't have shoestring potatoes, so I just used crunched up potato chips.
