I layered sliced deli ham onto the dough first, tastes a whole lot better that way

this was great.  this particular recipe only loses a star because garlic makes it complete.  a half teaspoon of garlic powder in the butter mixture.

I made these for thanksgiving because my husband wanted crescent rolls and I wanted to do something more interesting ;) I added the 1/2 teaspoon garlic like the other reviewer mentioned. I also made two packages of crescent rolls (16 rolls total) but used the amount of butter and herbs called for in the recipe. With all the other unhealthy dishes at thanksgiving, I didn't want the rolls to be doused in butter. They turned out great and I had compliments from everyone and my mom asked me for the recipe. This is saying something because everyone knows my mom is the best cook in our family and we all get or recipes from her. These would be great as an appetizer served with marinara sauce which is what I plan do
