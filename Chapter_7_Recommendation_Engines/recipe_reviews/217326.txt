I make this every once and a while for my husband and kids. Instead of string cheese, I use shredded mozzerella and I use my own homemade italian seasoning and homemade marinara. It's always a hit. If you're feeling lazy, this recipe also works if you quarter your biscuits and then layer them in your baking pan, spread the sauce (combined with the spices) over the top of the biscuits (you might need more sauce), then sprinkle with the cheeses. It will also be like Pull Apart Bread, but more like pizza. GREAT way for couponers to use their many canisters of whomp biscuits.

I used to make this for my younger siblings, brings back memories :)  One tip I have to maximize the taste is to sprinkle some garlic powder and a bit of whatever seasonings you sprinkle on top of the biscuits (in lieu of Italian seasoning I use basil and parsley) into the greased pan before placing the dough in the pan.  Oh and I use homemade sauce and shredded mozzarella, but those are just personal preferences.  Just a warning, this flies off the table! ;)

LOVED, LOVED, LOVED this! Not only was it so simple to assemble, but it was beautiful and VERY yummy! I think I ate more of this than our pasta tonight, lol. I did just eyeball the Italian seasoning, just to taste, and added some parsley as well. I could see just making this an appetizer or a side to a nice salad and calling it dinner...that's how much we enjoyed it! I will ALWAYS keep the ingredients on hand for this awesome bread~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

2 biscuit cans+1 jar Prego+1 Kraft mozz. cheese+pepperoni= SUPER CHEAP SIDE DISH. Go to the 99c store and make life easier on yourself. 

Mmmmmm, after 15 mins exactly the bread was really browned on top, which actually wasn't too bad, crunchy on the outside, soft and chewy on the inside.

I almost burned my mouth trying to eat this too quickly! I did make a few changes: I'm not a biscuit fan so I used refrigerated crescent dough instead I flattene out a triangle and put a tiny spoon of marinara at the short end with a cube of cheese on top, folded in the corners and rolled it up, pinching the sides to make sure nothing leaked out. I also took another reviewer's advise and seasoned the bottom of the pan after spraying it with Pam (garlic salt, oregano, basil). I baked it according to the package directions, although it needed about 10 extra minutes to cook through. But I was totally delicious and simple, I will def make this again and again!!!

My nephew and nieces loved making and eating this! I found the cook time a little short, I baked for 25 minutes with foil over top after 5.

These are really good.  I did use frozen bread dough balls, though, instead of biscuits.  They were soft, fluffy, and flavorful.  Thanks for a great idea!

I'm not a big fan of refrigerated biscuit dough. If I make these again, I would try Rhodes dough.

I was so hopeful about this one but unfortunately, it didn't work out for me.  It was very bland and the biscuits didn't cook well.  I'm wondering if I didn't pack the baking dish too tight.

I only had one canof biscuits but it still tasted great. I had overlapped the biscuits so the corners that were covered were still doughy. So I had to separate and pop back in the oven for a couple of minutes. I look forward to making this again.

This is a wonderful recipe with so many options! I made this recipe exactly as stated and it was awesome! I highly recommend you pay close attention to it as it bakes because store bought biscuits tend to overbake easily. I can't wait to play with fillings and toppings!

I had all of the ingredients on hand and needed to use the biscuits (they always get me with the coupons then I'm scrambling to use them up).  I too think these would be better with homemade or rhode's dough but they were good.  Added Chef Paul Prudhomme's Magic Pizza Seasoning and parmesan cheese to the cheese/sauce filling.  Pepperoni would be great too.  I served with Chicken Parmesan and pasta.

I followed the recipe mostly but I feel the dough was too thick. Croissant rolls would work better in my opinion. I also used basil and oregano for seasoning, not italian seasoning, and shredded moss cheese. Other than the dough, it was great! Big hit on Christmas!

I found the cooking temperature and time way off. Unfortunately I didn't realize it in time. Served it at our Christmas party and the outside was beautifully golden, but the inside was completely raw. Had to throw it out. Definitely would lower the temp to 350 next time and cook maybe 30 minutes and see what happens.

These did not cook properly. Crispy on the bottom , raw dough in the middle.  The canned biscuits had nasty taste.  I doubled the recipe for a party , so it was a lot of work for  poor results.  Sorry, just not for us.

Very good recipe!   Easy to assemble.  My only problem was it was still a bit doughy in the center after the 15mins.  It was fine for us as we used the middle as left overs and were able to bake to reheat without drying out.  Will try longer next time.

I made 2 pans of these tonight. First pan was made in a glass one and cooked perfectly. Second was in a dark metal pan and they all burnt on the bottoms. Both were cooked the same amount of time (15 min.). Will definitely be making them again, but only in my glass pan. Fantastic recipe.
