I've made this kind of pie so many times and have always stapled my paper grocery bag together.  It makes the most delicious apple pie and there is NEVER any problem with the staples being near the food.

Oh - my - gosh, Mamadellie!!  I have made three different apple pies over the weekend (all from the website) and I must say, yours gets five stars!  The ladies at church voted on your pie the most often and it was the first to go!  Congrats, and thank you for this recipe, which I have been looking for for the last ten years because when my grandmammy died, her recipes died with her...and this was one of them. Thank you!!

I have made this pie on many occassions.  I use a large Reynolds Turkey roasting bag to put my pie in.  I don't have to worry about fire and I close the bag using the twisty tie.  The bag is not to touch the top of teh pie.

This is my husband's favorite pie. I have been making it for at least thirty years.  It is always delicious, and I always bake it in a brown (grocery) bag.  It will smell like paper toasting for a little while, but it is fine!  You can close it with a couple of large paper clips, that's what I use.

Given a 5 star for flavour.  We don't like apples that stay crisp when cooked, so I won't make it with Granny Smith's again, but the flavour was really good.  Mother in law LOVED it said it reminded her of the "BIG APPLE" in Colborne, Ontario's pie, which she loves!  She nicknamed it sweet and sour pie!  Thanks for sharing!

Amazing Pie! Omitted the ginger and doubled the crust, flattened it out in my hands and formed a soft "crust" all over the top of the pie rather than "dot them randomly". The top is supposed to be a crust, not a cobbler style topping. It's my family's favorite part so I personally decided not to skimp. The graham crackers are of pure genius! Never thought of it before. I also used a plain brown grocery bag instead of parchment paper. Folded it over under the pie plate. Smelled a little of burning paper in the beginning but then transformed into the usual "drool until time to eat smell" we all know so well. Yes, my bag was recycled - no problems using them ever in my oven.
Can't wait for Thanksgiving to show this pie off to family and friends. Thanks! Great Recipe

This is still the best apple pie ever.  We have never had any problems with cooking it in a brown paper bag for the last 25 years.

I changed the recipe a bit, but the outcome was delicious.  I used 3 granny smith apples and 3 golden delicious apples. I used a store bought refrigerated crust and didn't use graham cracker crumbs as I didn't have any.  I followed the rest of the recipe as written.  My family especially enjoyed the carmelized, lightly crisp top.  I served it not too long after it came out of the oven as we like our pies warm. I will definitely make this pie again.

Excellent recipe!  The top crust is what makes this taste like the one from The Elegant Farmer in WI.  I followed other suggestions and doubled the top crust recipe.  Other than that followed it to the letter and it tasted superb!  Next time I will try baking the bottom crust a bit first before filling so it isn't so mushy.

An interesting baking method, which I'll use again. Average flavor. Crumb topping was not at all crumbly.

This is a great recipe, but proportions are wrong for the apples for sure. I cooked it with the 5 pounds, and it took FOREVER to cook, and apples still have a bit of crisp to them. The top layer is great tho.  :)  Worth tinkering with the recipe.

Oh heaven in my mouth!  It is more time consuming to make because of the two different crusts and the apple coring process, but it is so worth it.  The two different crusts are just perfect.  I have had apple pies with crusts that are too salty and it just ruined the pie for me. To make my life a little easier, I chill the topping (top crust) for 10 minutes just prior to step #5.  Since it has a lot of butter, it tends to soften in my fingers rather quickly, so cooling it makes the pinching process less messy.  I don't know if the bag is totally necessary because I've made it successfully both with and without it. But there is an element fun and surprise making it inside the paper bag.  Thank you, Mamadellie.  This apple pie is awesome!

I use another recipe I have had for years but you can no longer use paper bags as they are now recycled and the bag will burn.  So I am going to try parchment paper as I think that is what makes the pie so good in covering it up. This is a very good recipe.

I used my my Mom's recipe, but baked it in the brown bag.  I will never go back to baking it without!  It bakes perfectly.

I'm glad I found this recipe!  I go to a local farmer's stand and they are famous for the apple pie baked in a brown paper bag which is quite costly!  I always have to cook my apples down after slicing them because my boyfriend doesn't like the texture of apples and wants them soft instead of crunchy and it still turns out great!

I had never made an apple pie before. However, we have had  sack apple pies, the  last one from The Elegant Farmer in Wisconsin. They are great. I followed the recipe almost exactly. Changes were: I added 1/2 teaspoon vanilla to the apple mixture because everything just tastes better with it! I also cut a hole in the paper bag for the last 15 minutes but that really wasn't necessary. I precooked the crust for 5 minutes. The end result was delicious! A few comments though. There was way too much apple mixture. Next time I will only use 3 pounds of apples. Oh, I used a combination of Breaburn and Golden Delicious apples; both kinds hold up well, they don't turn to mush. I really mounded them up in the pie tin. As the finished pie cooled, it fell somewhat, so the result was pretty much a flat pie. It was really good and beautiful. I did use a recycled,  brown paper bag without problems.

Update: 9/10/18: I made this for a pie contest and won 1st prize!!!

This is our favorite apple pie. I make bottom from scratch, I use store bought,  I do use brown paper bag with paper clips. No problem. I have one in the oven now. I have a peeler and then I used my microplane slicer and went around the core. Nice thin slices and easy peasy.

This pie came out beautiful and very delicious!  I used a 3 pound bag of Cortlands and it was perfect.  I didn't have any graham crackers so I used gingersnaps instead and left out the ginger spice.  Could not find superfine sugar at my small grocery store, so substituted confectioners sugar and it came out fine.  Here's a hint: butter your fingers when working with the top filling and don't worry if it looks ugly going into the oven.  It will bake into a nice dome. Keeping this recipe!

I loved the idea of a "lazy-man's" top crust! It was very very messy, an lots got wasted on my hands. And I loved the idea of a paper-bag oven, but using the safer parchment paper made this old-school "waste-not, want-not" recipe quite costly. Regardless, it worked! I made two pies with this recipe, using one frozen GF bottom crust and one Tenderflake one. I wrapped them separately, and put each on their own cookie sheet - thank goodness for that! They boiled inside that parchment after an hour and then I removed the parchment and threw them back in the same oven for another 10 minutes to brown them up. Then we had to wait quite some time for them to cool before we were able to scoop out a decently solid piece. But, OMG, so so delish. Used frozen bottom crusts, and everything else was identical. Cannot keep leftovers, because there aren't any!!

Fantastic! Just make sure to keep most of the topping crumbled. I flattened to much of it. This was the best pie yet :)
Parchment paper worked well

This pie is just delicious! I have made many apple pies as we have friends with trees that are unsprayed yet still bear too many for their own use. But this is the best I've baked. I used cinnamon grahams 2 full double crackers crushed up under the fruit, on top of the crust. I also sprinkled about a half teaspoon of vanilla before adding the topping. I used parchment paper because I didn't have a brown bag, but I will stock up now. The topping was soft and buttery with just enough crunch. Much better than the apple crumb pie I usually bake.

Super easy, and fun to make. It did make an awful burning smell at first, and I had to keep telling my family not to worry. It's super fun to tear open the bag and see this beautiful creation when it's done baking. I went an hour at 400 degrees, and that was just perfect. Thank you!

One note... if you bake it in a paper bag, cut a hole in the top to match the circumference of the pie and let it brown the crust a bit before serving.

Went well, I love the paper bag method as its so easy and hands off.
Aldi has full size paper bags for 10¢ea.  I got mine from Kroger, but they were half the size.  For this those bags are fine, for a turkey pay for full size paper bag.
