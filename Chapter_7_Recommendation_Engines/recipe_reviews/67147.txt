Another great recipe from George R!  The only thing I ommitted was the parsley which I dont care for.  This was a fantastic recipe that was elegant while simple to make.

Really good!  The stuffing is a delicious mixture that really complements the meat. I roasted mine at a higher temperature for a little longer than the recipe called for because we like ours more medium.

I made this beef the other night and it was pretty good.  We had a whole tenderloin which we butchered down to steaks and were left with about a 1 lb roast, so I scaled the recipe for this roast.  I followed the recipe exactly except for the breadcrumbs; what was called for was way too much in my opinion.  I ended up using about 2 Tbsp which I think was the perfect amount; enough to keep the ingredients together but not too much that bread crumbs are all you could taste.

OUTSTANDING !
Was worried that a couple of reviewers complained that it was dry, so I substituted shredded zucchini for half of the bread crumbs. Zucchini kept stuffing moist. Also seared tenderloin on grill, then stuffed and wrapped in Bacon. (Everything's bettter with bacon) Got rave reviews from party of gourmet cooks. Made enough that I ate the leftovers for three days. My cardiologist will have lots to talk about.

First time making a Beef Tenderloin and oh were we thrilled with the results.  We needed to bake longer to get to the correct temperature but I think my oven temp may be off plus we were baking 2 at the same time.  It was not dried out at all - absolutely DELICIOUS.  We did this Christmas Eve dinner and everyone at the table was thrilled with it.  My husband also raved of the sandwiches he got from the the next couple days.  Definately a do over for a special meal.

Reviewed this in 2010 and made this again today using the Prime Roast from Peapod which works well and is only 1-2 pounds.  I find that dry toasting the pine nuts first and then adding them to mixture with the bread crumbs gives the pine nuts more flavor.  Sometimes I add a little parmesan or romano cheese too, but this is a great recipe as written!

The stuffing was really dry and completely lacked flavor. If you do make this, I strongly suggest adding some olive oil or butter to the stuffing and also adding extra sun-dried tomatoes, because the tomatoes seem to be the only thing that gives the stuffing any flavor. Perhaps add some garlic as well.

The flavors were wonderful, but we found the stuffing to be too dry and hard to serve.

I made this with my Hunny for Valentines.  We both agreed it was by far the best steak we had ever eaten, after recounting all the expensive nights out where filet mignon was served (we used filet mignon not a big tenderloin). The stuffing flavors were to die for, but I did make a few changes.  I did not use the bread crumbs.  Instead I took some cooked black rice from another meals leftovers, sweetened it a touch and pureed it with pinenuts to match the measurements of the bread crumbs.  Obviously this made a big diffrence, but I really recomend it, IT WAS SOOO GOOD!  We drank pink champgne and laughed with every bite!  It was THAT good!

Perfect today for Christmas Eve dinner.  Had to cook a bit longer but perhaps my roast was a little larger.  Added a tablespoon of oil from the sun-dried tomatoes to make slightly more moist.  I also used panko bread crumbs which I swear by.  I would make again and again.  That's how good it is.

IT was a nice tenderloin but the pine nuts were a little salty to me for some reason. I will make it again but maybe leave out the pine nuts.

Very nice stuffing. However, to prevent the meat from getting dry, I put puff pastry around the meat. Just roll it out slightly (otherwise you loose all the 'puff'), and put it around the meat. Put it on a rack to prevent the dough of getting soggy on the bottom. Depending on the size of the meat, the pastry and the meat should be done at the same time (about 20 minutes).

I was very disappointed, considering the cost of this meal. :( It was dry, not as flavorful as I had hoped, and not worth the over-$100 I spent for a 5-lb. tenderloin and the stuffing. Next time I am sticking with a juicier crock pot recipe.

Absolutely Fantastic!  I added in one extra teaspoon of oil from the sun dried tomatoes to the stuffing, everything else was the same as the recipe.  This will now be a standard on Christmas Eve!

We love a tenderloin - but this comes out dry.  I have made it twice first time the only modification was to leave out the pine nuts because one of the guests had an allergy.  It was dry - I followed the recipe again the 2nd time cutting down the bread to 1/2 cup and adding in the pine nuts - still dry.  we like our meat very rare and I think the cooking temp/time is for medium to well done.  If we try again we will reduce cooking time and temperature.

Wonderful recipe and the "stuffing" is versatile enough to use with lamb too.  Perfect for a special dinner.

This roast has become a Christmas tradition for my family and it is one my family looks forward to every year.  I make one major modification.  I make three "butterfly" cuts into the meat in order to flatten it out for rolling.  I then take the stuffing and spread it evenly along the meat and carefully roll it.  with the help of a spare pare of hands I then tie 2 or 3 times depending on the size of the roast.

This year we had a sun-dried tomato accident (dropped the glass bottle on the floor).  As such I improvised and used a small can of tomato paste and added olive oil until it had the right texture.  The taste was the same and some of my family preferred the texture and taste over the sun-dried tomatoes.
