These muffins were scrumptious.  I added an extra cup of bananas & upped the vanilla to 1 tablespoon.  I added 1/4 cup more flour & a few extra chocolate chips. They baked for about 7 minutes longer.  They turned out wonderful.  Great recipe.

Good recipe. I followed the recipe almost exactly the way it was stated however, I did take the advice of the previous reviews and only added 1 cup of sugar. Also, I used 2 large sized, ripe bananas. The muffins turned out great!

I made these in a hurry for a gathering of friends.  I didn't have bananas or chocolate chips, instead I substituted a can of peaches (drained and pureed in blender) and dried cranberries.  They turned out incredibly moist and well set.  I think this recipe is a great base recipe for muffins, and you could add/substitute anything you want.

This is my new go-to recipe for muffins.  They tasted delicious!  I made a batch of 24 and we ate some every morning for a week.  Thanks for a great recipe!

These were pretty good. A little dense but maybe because I added a bit too much banana (Had 3 that I just wanted to use up). Nice flavour though with the nuts AND chocolate. *Keep in mind that these will not rise very much... I underfilled my first batch...*

These are great muffins.  My toddlers adore them; we make them once a week. I was never a fan of banana muffins before, but this has a nice, mild banana flavor. I changed the recipe as follows:  I use half whole wheat flour, add about a cup of chopped walnuts, and use only half a cup of mini chocolate chips.  It's much lighter with mini chips, and I can make lots more batches out of one bag this way.  These muffins are a staple in our house.

Oh My Gosh! These are absolutely delicious! I followed the recipe almost exactly: I used slightly less than the called-for butter and sugar, using equal parts white and brown sugar. I also used 1/2 c. semi-sweet chocolate chips and 1/2 c. walnuts. I added cinnamon.

If anything, these muffins were a little on the sweet side. To make these a little more nutritious next time, I will probably substitute applesauce for some of the fat, decrease sugar even more, try yogurt instead of sour cream, and use 1 c. whole wheat flour/1 c. all-purpose flour.

All in all, a fine, fine recipe. My daughter LOVES them.

These are absolutely delicious! I didn't change a thing with the recipe (besides cutting it in half). I can certainly tell where the "Oh my Gosh" came from! Perfect amounts of banana and chocolate. Thank you Friendsfreak8518 for a lovely recipe!

Because I'm out of sour cream but I had plain nonfat yogurt, I switched it out and used the yogurt instead. I also cut back on the sugar because my bananas were VERY ripe. I only used about a half cup. To make them a little healthier, I used whole wheat white flour.  These were good, rich and moist, but I wish there had been more of a banana flavor. Next time when I make these, I'll cut out a little of the butter and one of the eggs and add another half cup or so of banana.

These were good, not the best I've ever had but I would serve them and be proud. The banana is not overpowering, it's just right.  Unlike most of the other reviewers I did not think mine were too sweet, in fact I considered making some cream cheese frosting for them. Maybe my oven is running hot these days but 22 minutes was morethan enough time for me, they were way too brown at 25.

I thought these were moist and delicious.  I only used 1/2 cup sugar, and one banana,then substituted mayonnaise for the sour cream.  I then baked for 15 minutes.

OH MY GOSH!  Made exactly per recipe except made 12 large muffins, and baked them for 30 minutes.  They were perfect in every way. 25 minutes seems too much time for small muffins, so I expect if your muffins were dry, they were cooked too long.

The first time, I followed the recipe exactly. Very light. Nice yellow color. The second time, I reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup for more banana flavor. (I don't like it too sweet.) Next time, I'll try 3/4 cup sugar, and increase the banana slightly, perhaps to 1 1/2 cups.

Another recipe to use up bananas.  I made these in to minis and the recipe made 48.  I tried baking without cupcake papers and they stuck to my greased pans.  I then added the papers and they worked great.  This recipe freezes well for a quick grab-and-go breakfast.  Thanks Lisa for sharing.

I "healthied" up this recipe & they were still excellent. I dramatically reduced the sugar & they were still plenty sweet to me. I don't think I would *ever* put 1.5 cups of sugar to 2 cups flour + 1 cup of supersweet overripe bananas. I think I might go into diabetic shock then & there and I'm not diabetic LOL. The serving size is a bit off but perhaps that's because I reduced the sugar, I may have lost a good bit of volume doing that. (My picture will (eventually) reflect a wheaty, coarse texture. That is caused by whole wheat flour, wheat germ, and milled flaxseed. If you don't use make those substitutions, you need not worry about getting a texture like mine.) Thanks for the recipe, it is a lovely way to use up bananas!

Very easy & yummy!  I did make a few small changes.  I used 1 c. sugar and 3 bananas.  I also subbed fresh blueberries for the chocolate.  I baked them in a mini-muffin pan and it made 24 exactly (filled 3/4 full).  I don't like giving my 4 yr. old an adult size muffin and she doesn't like it when I cut one in half.  Giving her a mini-muffin is perfect.  They had the right amount of sweetness.  The banana/blueberry combo is great!  I will make with banana/choco combo a later time, maybe with some coconut sprinkled in.  Yum!

These are good.  They are light and sweet and have a very buttery, creamy taste.  The banana flavour was a bit muted.  I think it also has the right amount of chocolate chips.  THX

The only changes I made to this recipe was to reduce the sugar by a third, and swapped  in some brown sugar. The recipe worked great.

I tried this recipe yesterday with my friend.  We both said "Oh My Gosh" these are good!  I changed a few things on the recipe though.  I forgot to get sour cream so I used plain vanilla yogurt and instead of vanilla extract I used Almond!  I will be making more of these for my Easter Brunch for sure!!  I will just have to print a bunch of recipes off for everyone that will be asking how I made them!!  Try them you will love them!!!!!!!!!

Very moist and tasty!  Like some other reviewers suggested, I cut the sugar by about half a cup, and I didn't bother measuring the bananas... just used whatever I had.  They turned out delicious!  I will definately make them again!

Really easy to make and taste great! 
I subbed white chocolate chips for the semi-sweet ones!

Husband says 5 stars!  He loves them!  Followed the recipe exactly except added 1/2 tsp salt based on others suggestions.  A great way to used up some overripe bananas!

I see where these get their name... Oh My Gosh they are good! Strangely enough I thought they were better cold the next morning but nevertheless- they were delicious. I made as directed but substituted whole wheat flower. As others said, i may try to add applesauce to cut down on fat, but other than that- no changes needed!!!

These are good muffins. I think the amount of sugar is too high though. Next time I make them, I think I will only use half the sugar.  Good basic recipe though.

Pretty darn good muffins.  Didn't rise very much, but had great flavor.  Normally, I would use mini chocolate chips in a muffin recipe, but I didn't have any, so I used the regular.  Love the big chunks of chocolate.  I cut the recipe in half, but left the amount of banana the same.

These were very good muffins. I made these the first time as recipe stated and found them very good.  I prefer muffins and such not quite so sweet, so I would take out some of the sugar.  As for adding more bananas as a few others have suggested, if you do this, then you have banana bread or muffins.  The one banana adds some sweetness and moisture w/o the big banana taste.

I freaking love these muffins. I have been doubling the batch and making them at least once a week since I found it.I do put some milk chocolate chips in and some walnuts in the mix----yummy! Thank you for sharing. I also freeze them when they are done cooling and they taste great even after they have been frozen.

These were good, but they were quite dense. I'm not a huge fan of banana muffins, but I have to admit they smelled so good coming out of the oven I did utter 'O my gosh!' without thinking. I don't think I'll be making them again, however, because everyone in the house preferred other muffins I'd made before.

These muffins are FANTASTIC tasting.  I reduced the sugar to one cup and substituted half of the all-purpose with whole wheat flour, and the muffins still turned out beautifully - not too sweet and not too dense.  I am planning on following some more reviewer suggestions (applesauce for butter, more bananas) for my next batch. These tasty things don't last long!

Followed the recipe exactly but used a mixture of m&m's, chocolate chips and nuts.  Came out more dense and heavier than I thought they'd be.  Also seemed to have too much sugar.  Maybe better as a dessert.

Moist, tender muffins!  I exchanged frozen raspberries and sweetened coconut for the bananas and chocolate chips - just a taste preference.  Oh My Gosh Muffins truly worthy of their name.

These turned out great! I split the batter in half and added peanut butter chips instead of chocolate to one half because I have one anti chocolate kid. I also cooked half as regular muffins and half as mini muffins. The mini muffins were done after 11 minutes.

I can eat these all day! So delicious and moist. I baked these in baking cups rather than greasing the muffin pan, and only baked for 22 minutes at 350 degrees. Personally, I've found that they taste better when I use ripe bananas. They were still good with bright yellow bananas, but better when they're ripe. I also like to use a pinch more baking soda to get more rise, and I like milk chocolate chips, rather than semi-sweet.

The best banana muffin. Instead of choc-chips, I chop up 1 plain and 1 milk chocolate. Very nice to have a variety of chocolatey flavors.

I made these for the second time today. Last time they were good but today they came out great! I added 1 1/2 cups banana and 2 tsp of cinnamon. Other then that I followed the receipe. They are so much more moist and fluffy. And the cinnamon makes smell wonderful. This receipe is a winner!!

These were really good and everyone enjoyed them. I used milk chocolate chips and the banana flavor is very complimentary, not overpowering. They are also very moist. Update- I make these on a regular basis and use mini chocolate chips and sometimes use almond extract instead of vanilla, changes the flavor a bit and is really good.

Wonderful tasty morsels! I only made the following changes- 1/2 applesauce and 1/2 butter, 1/2 sourcream and 1/2 yogurt, bittersweet chocolate chips. I may make them even healthier next time!

I thought this was a great recipe. I used spelt flour as a substitute and it worked really well with this muffin recipe. I am not a big banana fan so I only added 1 banana and the small hint of flavor it added was a nice subtle compliment. I did keep the original sugar measurement but added some vegan semi sweet chips, which helped make it not so sweet...just perfect. Thank you for the recipe!

These are so easy to make and turned out really well. I used natural yoghurt instead of sour cream and added chopped nuts. I will definitely make these again.

Very good but a tad too sweet for my taste. If I make these again, I'll use a lot less sugar. Other than that, the muffins turned out very moist with a nice light banana-y flavor.

Very tasty!  And the kids love them too.  I'd like a little more banana flavor and I use mini chocolate chips instead to spread the chocolate flavor.

I liked these, but the idea of putting more banana in them sounds like a good one.  They were a little dry, but we ate them hot out of the oven and put a little butter on them.  Yum!

Wow, these are amazing!  I could have easily eaten all of them in one sitting but I do try to restrain myself!  The sour cream makes the difference because they're moist and a little dense but not heavy.  I used 3 bananas and could easily taste them.  Thanks for sharing this awesome recipe!

They were good with a unique taste from the sour cream. They were just the right amount of sweetness for me, the kid's thought they were "ok".

These are FABulous!  My family ate all 24 muffins in less than 1 day!  I used 5 very ripe, organic bananas like one of the suggestions.  I have a hot oven, so I cooked them for 22 minutes, not 25.  I will most definitely make these again!  THANKS!!

I tried to make the muffins healther so here's what I did: sugar = brown sugar, 3 bananas (1 1/2 cups), flour = wheat flour. Next time I'll use less butter and maybe applesauce instead as well as dark chocolate chips. I like my version a lot, not quite "oh my gosh" but tasty!

8.22.19 ... https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/85387/oh-my-gosh-muffins/ ... I loafed - ;D - this, one 9x5.  'Definitely heavy enough for a quickbread; close, if not too dense, for a muffin - in my book.  I didn't add the chips, added a t of salt, reduced sugar to 3/4c; 350, 1hr.  Subtle banana flavor, lessthanusual moistness.

I reduced the sugar by 2/3, I figured they would be sweet enough from the chocolate chips and the overripe bananas that I used. They still turned out quite sweet for me, but my friends loved them! I also substituted greek yoghurt for sour cream since I had some, used half whole grain flour and half plain flour, plus I added 1/2 teaspoon of salt and some toasted walnuts. I made these as mini muffins, which were nice for a small party. They took about 25mins in the oven at 175deg, but I left them in a bit longer until they had a nice light brown on their tops. They turned out moist and delicious. Next time I will try to further reduce the sugar and see how they turn out.

These were so yummy! I was looking for a blueberry muffin recipe and found this one in my file. I don't think I ever made them before, but I thought I'd try them before searching online.  I made a few minor tweaks in addition to substituting a pint of blueberries for the chocolate chips. I used I cup white sugar and a half of brown. Next time I'll try a half cup of each. I used a little less flour  and added a half cup old fashioned oats. I didn't measure the bananas, and just used 2 medium. As soon as these are gone, I'm making another batch. So GOOD!

My family loves these muffins. They are light and fluffy with good flavour. I did modify the recipe slightly. I added 1/2 cup of apple sauce and only used 1/2 cup butter. I also only used 1 cup sugar. I used 3/4 cup brown flour and 1 cup white flour.

These were very good, but I didn't have normal size muffin cups, so I used cooking spray on mini muffin sheets. Also, you can subsitute a small pocket of nutella in the finished muffin instead of the chocolate chips. If you do make these into mini muffins, cook them only 10-15 minutes. You can use the extra batter to make a muffin-textured loaf.

I have made these several times now, and they always get eaten quickly. My kids love them! A couple tips: if you're not using muffin papers, I recommend greasing and flouring your pans so they don't stick, and I always coat the chocolate chips in the flour mixture before I add it into the wet ingredients; that way the chocolate chips don't all sink to the bottom. Other than that, I follow the recipe as written, and love them!

Great recipe! I only put 1 cup of sugar and it was enough. This one is a keeper.

I tried this recipe and the muffins were very tasty but the recipe calls for 24 muffins but I only got 12 and I did only fill them 3/4 full as directed. muffin tins were regular size..was the recipe for mini muffins what could I have done wrong.

These are yummy. I doubled the recipe as I had a ton of bananas. As others said the sugar amount is too high with adding sweet bananas! For a double batch the sugar would be 3 cups by the recipe...I did a bit less then 2 of regular sugar and then a small half cup of loose packed brown sugar...they are still very very very sweet...next time I'll cut the sugar significantly! Otherwise it's a great recipe... has a nice mild banana flavor, I also added a couple drops of almond extract and a tad extra vanilla. Thanks for a great muffin.

Very good recipe! I only made 1/2 a batch to check it out and see if Grandkids liked them or not, and they were a hit. They are better warm to me, a bit more dense  than fluffy but still very good.  I followed 1/2 recipe as written and was pleased, definitely a keeper!

Made these this morning but wish I had read the reviews first.  They were ok but way too sweet.  I doubt I'll make them again but if I did, I'd reduce the sugar to just one cup and maybe leave out the chocolate chips.  I don't think the chips did anything for the muffins and just sunk to the bottom.  They also stuck badly to the muffin tin but that could be my fault.  They were moist but also dense and flat.  We prefer a fluffier muffin. One to the next experiment :)
