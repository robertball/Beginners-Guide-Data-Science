I belong to a food coop and have an abundance of eggplant.  Ergo: this recipe.  I added a little more salt and some pepper.  I roasted a whole head of garlic with the eggplant and squeezed that in at the finish.  I also added one large spoonfull of tahini and the juice of half a lemon, and it was MARVELOUS!

This hummus was easy to make, and came out with a somewhat decent texture. I liked that it's quick to make and that the ingredients are affordable. However, the hummus was very bland. After making it according to instructions, I had to doctor the recipe up quite a bit to make it enjoyable. This might be a good base, but I would not serve it as-is. I give it two stars for affordability, accessibility, nutritional value and texture. It severely lacks in flavor.

The eggplant in this helps to make this a very creamy dip. However, it is not really a hummus. It was more like an eggplant dip with some garbanzo. It is pretty bland and tasteless as is. It needs tahini, lemon, cumin and a dash of cayenne pepper. I used 1/2  of a large eggplant and did not include the skin. I was worried about it not blending smooth enough.  It was much better after the addition of the other ingredients.

The recipe title promises a lot and does not deliver.  Very, very bland.  I added lemon juice, additional garlic, tahini and curry powder.  Now THAT was good.

This was sooo delicious. I ate spoonfuls of it right out of the food processor. Even my 15 month old son gobbled it up. I ran out of olive oil so I just used regular canola oil, but I didn't change anything else. It was great, thanks.

Yummy. A little chewy. Not really worth the effort of the eggplant. Needed tahini, lemon juice and lots of garlic.

Used dried beans instead of canned.  Needed to add water as consistency was too thick.   Agree w/ other review - this was too bland.  Added more salt and fresh ground black pepper.  Will probably add cayanne pepper to give it a little kick as well.

Turned out too bland. Had to add peppers and tomatoes and more garlic. Easy recipe, though.

I can't say I agree with a lot of the other viewers. I thought this was delicious! You really do have to follow the proportions though. I halved everything and tasted it and it was delicious. (I did also sweat the eggplant, slice, peel and roast it about 25 minutes at 400). Then I added the other half can of garbanzos and totally lost the wonderful, roasted flavor. At that point I tried adding things in like tahini, more garlic, lemon, etc., to try to fix my error, but to no avail. The new version is ok, but the exact recipe was great! It comes out pretty chunky (see photo) but that's great because you get the individual flavors of the ingredients. Go into this with an open mind. It might have been better to call it a dip rather than a hummus because then people expect it to take like hummus. It doesn't. But if you savor the flavors for a moment, you'll realize it has a great, natural flavor in its own right. Can't wait to make it again, thanks Stengah!

I had an abundance of eggplant from my local farmers co-op so I thought I would try something different.  I wish I hadn't.  I apologize to those of you who like this recipe but I found it completely unedible.  I don't know how any of the usual hummus additions like lemon juice, tahini, peppers etc.. could possibly help.

I didn't like the texture the eggplant gave to the hummus.

I agree with some of the others that it doesn't have much flavour as is.  I am on weight watchers and everything I eat has to be very flavourful and satisfying.  It has to be WORTH IT to eat it:)  The only thing I found that added that POP of flavour (after adding oregano, lemon juice and a bit of feta) was roasted red peppers.  Now it's delish!

It's a good base, but we thought it lacked pizzazz. We added a tablespoon of tahini, 2 tablespoons of lemon juice, at least a teaspoon each of garlic salt, black pepper, and chili powder.

I will definitely make it again with the additions.

Good recipe, I love Eggplant. And I love Hummus. But not much flavor in it.. What did I do wrong? I skipped the salt because I have hypertension..
