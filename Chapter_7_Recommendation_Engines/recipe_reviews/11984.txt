In all the years I have been making Pierogi, I have never put sour cream in the filling.  You can use mashed potatoes to hold the filling together.  It makes it easier to work with.

I always add brown sugar to this (about 2 T, or more, depending on your own taste).  It cuts the tartness of the sauerkraut, and really make the filling.

These were AWESOME!!! I love sauerkraut and just had to try these. 1/4 of the pierogis I boiled then fried and 1/4 of them I just fried. Hubby liked the boiled one but I liked just fried. I used a sour cream, lemon juice, garlic powder, onion powder, and dill weed dipping sauce.

This is DELICIOUS!!!  I got rave reviews.  I also love the addition of the sour cream...gives it a nice texture without too much  moisture.  A very nice change from the standard potato filling.

Very tasty on its own!  This filling makes a delicious quick, light meal.  I did not actually make pierogies with it.  I will definitely be making this again.  Next time I will add a lot more mushrooms, just because I like them.  I will also try this with sour cream, as I didn't have any.  I subbed it for a smidge of cream cheese and it still tasted great.  I have a very Ukrainian/Polish step family, and I grew up eating pirogies. I love sauerkraut and mushroom pirogies but they are not exactly health food.  This recipe is great on its own, as you can enjoy the great flavors while not having to feel guilty about the carbs and fat.

I will definitely be making this again.  Next time I will add a lot more mushrooms, just because I like them.  I will also try this with sour cream.

I used my home made sauerkraut and I added bacon. Plus cooked everything in the bacon pan. Great. I doubled this recipe and only had a little too much for the "Grandmas polish perogies" recipe on this site. I would have ran out had I not doubled this.

Love this filling!! When I told my daughter what was in the filling, she  said 'not sure about the mushrooms', but guess who ate most of them?!!!!!
A keeper! I also used the filling in a calzone and it was even more amazing!! (added 2 cups mashed potato to the mix to make it go farther)

Delicious!  My new favorite Pierogi filling!  I omitted the mushrooms, but otherwise made as written.  The sour cream gave it a nice tang.  I'm so glad to have found another great recipe that highlights sauerkraut!

This filling is just perfect.  I followed the recipe exactly.  I used this filling  in Grandma's Polish Perogies recipe from this site.  The filling was exactly the amount I needed to fill the dough cut outs. Really really good!

I made these with this recipe and I added a tablespoon of cream cheese, (really wasn't needed) but I have never made pierogis before. I will never buy my sauerkraut pierogis out any where. This is the best tasting pierogi I have ever had. Thanks so much for sharing.

Delicious and worked great for filling pierogi's that I made. I wouldn't think a filling like this would have sour cream in it as an ingredient, but it really helps keep it together and moist. I'll definitely use this again! Thanks for the recipe!

My husband loved this filling for pierogi.  I made it as written except I didn't have any mushrooms on hand, he still loved it!
