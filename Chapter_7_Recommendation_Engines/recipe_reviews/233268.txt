This tasted all right but I am unlikely to make it again. I definitely think the cinnamon should be mixed into the pumpkin batter rather than sprinkled on top. I can also vouch that you need the entire two tablespoons. I personally think it could have used an extra egg and a larger pinch of baking soda - maybe one teaspoon instead of the one half I used.

I liked it but I would cut back on the sugar in the custard next time.  The sugar in top is great and would make up for the lack of sugar inside.

This is a very easy dessert to put together and it actually tastes good. It ends up tasting like a crispy cinnamon toast topping over pumpkin pie. The problem is the appearance of this dessert. I had to cover the top with aluminum foil toward the end of the bake time to keep it from burning. The topping has a lot of cinnamon in it so it is very dark almost black which detracts from the presentation.

I used almond milk because I didn't have evaporated milk. It was still good but the evaporated milk would definitely be better I'm sure. The custard is light with good flavor. The topping is a LOT of sugar but don't cut it. It makes a crust on top. I love cinnamon but my roommate doesn't. She preferred the custard without the top crust but it's easily scooped off. Either way we'll make it again.

This is a good basic recipe. I modified the recipe to make it dairy free and gluten free and it was really tasty. I mixed the cinnamon into the filling and sprinkled just a couple tablespoons of sugar on top. No problems with it burning as another commenter mentioned. Next time I will bake it a few minutes longer and use only 3/4 cup of sugar in the filling.

I skipped the topping and added spices to the pudding mix. It was a bit too sweet I m going to cut the sugar in half next time. I spiced it with the same ingredients for pumpkin pie.

We thought it was great. Maybe some people didn't follow the recipe and thought their own tweaks would improve it? Who knows. Its simple and quick and is perfect in the fall.

I did love it! Added my pumpkin spice mix to the batter as there isn't any. For those who didn't like the sugar on top I guess you never had creme brûlée as this was just like it. I had to "break" into the pudding which was not creamy like a pudding would be as there is a bit of flour in it. Just love this and making for Christmas. Couldn't stop eating this.
