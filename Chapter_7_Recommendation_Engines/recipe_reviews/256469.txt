I used sugar and baked them, rather than frying.  They were very good - basicallya popover with apples.

2 stars cause it's my fault that I got my oil too hot and they weren't cooked on the inside. They were only a little doughy though, normally wouldn't have been a throw away batch but the taste was awful. So maybe if I cooked them better the taste of apple cider wouldn't have been so overpowering! Maybe. It called for a lot!
