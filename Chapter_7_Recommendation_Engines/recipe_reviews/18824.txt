Yummy!  I loved this.  I was serving it at an early brunch so I prepared the vegies the night before and put them in a baggie.  The next morning, all I had to do was mix the eggs, sour cream, cheese and dump the baggie contents.  Voila...it was ready for the oven in minutes.  It did take longer to cook than 30 minutes, but it was well worth it.  I decreased the amount of black beans to one cup and will increase the red pepper to 1/2 cup next time.  I served with real chopped bacon and fresh salsa...PERFECT.

My husband and I truly enjoyed this recipe.  We served it with salsa and sour cream and had it for an easy week night dinner.

I substituted diced yellow squash for the black beans to suit my family's preference.  Served it with homemade biscuits and applesauce for a yummy summer supper.  Would definitely make again.

I did not have a red pepper, bacon bits or corn so I drained a can of rotel and used that instead.  I had to cook it for 45 minutes because the casserole was too wet.  It was still a little moist but I took it out of the oven because I didn't want it to over cook.  It tasted really great with the rotel and I am glad that I substituted it for the corn and red pepper. You might give it a try.

This was okay.  By itself it was kind of bland but really needed the salsa and I put mine in a ww tortilla as well after trying it on it's own.  My daughter didn't even care for it in the tortilla.  I think the SC is a bit much, maybe half it and then add egg whites or something to make up for it but it taste like a lot of SC.  Thanks but needs doctoring.

This tasted ok.  I probably won't be making it again though.  It was a little bland.  I had to put a lot of salt and pepper on mine to give it flavor.

It was a bit bland - without the spicy salsa it would not have tasted good. Simple to make. Took longer than 30 minutes to cook.

Great flavor, and it's appealing to the eye as well.
I'll be serving this dish a lot.

Tasty, quick and easy!  I used canned corn instead of frozen.  Definitely takes at least 40 minutes.  Great weeknight dinner, we'll be having again!

I thought this was a wonderful recipe. I didn't use the full 4 ounce can of chile peppers. The kids aren't to keen on that yet. We raise our own chickens , so this was a great way to use up the eggs ! I shared the recipe with my MIL it was so good. Will be making this again !

WONDERFUL!!!  Great for breakfast, brunch or dinner... did have to bake for an additional 15 minutes.  I also used cilantro instead of parsley, just cause that's what I had.  I thought it turned out great - didn't even need salt.  (Used Homemade Gourmet Maria's Salsa - AWESOME.)

This looked great, but was a real disappointment. I think cilantro would have been much better. There was just not much flavor, but i guess there's hot sauce for that!

I don't like chile peppers so dumped that but threw in some cayenne (liberally) to add some zing back.  Didn't have green onion so tossed in some chives.  Used real bacon.  This was fairly good but not very filling.  I can't figure the 12 servings except as just a little snack.  I used as a main dish, ate 1/4 of it, and even that wasn't filling.  It was pretty easy to make.  I'd make again - just have to make more or feed less.

My family enjoyed this dish. It did take 40 minutes to cook, not the 30 listed.  Also, it was very light in texture, not like a frittata usually is.  This made the beans sink to the bottom and separate from the egg when served.  My family liked the flavor and I will probably make it again with changes.  I did not put in the bacon  because of vegetarians in the family.

This recipe turned out really great! I made some slight modifications - used light sour cream, half the black beans, added jalapeno peppers, mushrooms, salt and black pepper. Skipped the bacon bits. It turned out very well indeed. Took it to a breakfast metting and had people asking me for the recipe. Worked for the vegetarians in the group too. I did have to bake it for around 40 mts instead of the recommended 30 mts.
Would definitely make it again, with more jalapeno peppers - I like it zesty! Thank you for sharing this recipe.

This was very good.  The only thing I changed was to use cilantro instead of pasley.  Hubby said I can definitely make this again.  This will be good for tailgating, as well

Made a few changes. Added 1lb. of chopped up sausage links & 3 cubes of frozen cilantro & skipped bacon & red pepper just because I didn't have it. Added about 1/3-1/2 cup salsa.

I work at a homeless shelter and have to fix dinner for folks every Saturday night. I'm always looking for recipes that are easy and come together fast. Biggest problem with this one: THE TIME!! It takes WAY longer than 30 minutes, and when you've got a house full of hungry people, time is of the essence. Plan on closer to an hour, and that's at 400 degrees.

Well, first of all, I sort of messed up.  I halved the recipe, but still used a 9x13" pan.  So, it was EXTREMELY thin (and not very filling).  My boyfriend doesn't eat beans, so I omitted those.  We ran out of bacon bits, so I didn't use those.  But, despite these issues, we will probably make it again.  However, we decided it needs more "stuff" in it.  I would add mushrooms for certain, and maybe some diced tomatoes.  I think it will be excellent, when I make it properly!!  :)

This was yummy - but next time I'll follow the instructions a little better. I tried to cut it in half until I got to the canned ingredients - I just dumped the whole cans in. It was good, but I think it would have been better the way the recipe was written.
