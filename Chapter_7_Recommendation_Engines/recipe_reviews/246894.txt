Having lived in japan, this a weekly staple in my house. My only changes are,  5 Tbsps of soy sauce and 3 Tbsps of rice vinegar instead of  Mirin. Oh and adding the egg to the top the sauce at the end and letting them harden up. This is four servings FYI.

this is a good groundwork recipe, but i definately recommend adding some more seasonings to your taste as the recipe is a bit bland. (we added more soy sauce as a trial but will definately experiment more with it)

I made a few changes,  I didn't have sake, so I just put in 2  GPS of Miriam. This is soooo delicious, I will make this one again. All of the sets are easy to do.

I thought it was bland.  I will make again, but will definitely add vegetables, ginger and salt .  Will also double the sauce as we like it to soak into the rice

A sweet and savoury delight hot or cold. I used mirin because I didn't have sake,  and the outcome was a bit too sweet. I served it with the optional ingredients all over rice noodles. Thank you for the recipe.
