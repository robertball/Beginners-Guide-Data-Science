This is a recipe I could eat at least once a week. I love shrimp, especially lemony garlicy shrimp! I do think the red pepper flakes it calls for was a little much so I halved it to 3/4 teaspoon and that was perfect. I did NOT add the pasta water. I thought the pasta water would dilute all the other favors and I'm glad I didn't add it. I was really able to taste the lemon, garlic, wine and butter with each bite. I may add a little more garlic and some lemon zest the next time I make this and see how that goes. Oh and I cut the red and yellow peppers with a tiny heart cookie cutter just for some fun.

WONDERFUL, WONDERFUL, WONDERFUL! We had this tonight for the first time and it definintly replaces my old scampi recipe! Followed the directions exactly, topped with some fresh shredded parm/romano and served with warm bread. Can't wait to have it again.

Thanks so much for sharing, misterme.  This recipe was delicious, and so easy!  I did a few tweaks:  I didn't have heavy cream, so I substituted greek yogurt.  Delicious.  I was also out of red pepper flakes, so I too a few whole dried red peppers, and added them to the roux when the pasta was absorbing the liquid.  They added just the right amount of pazazz.  I took them out when I served, of course.    I dusted the dinner with a little Parmesian, which is a no-brainer. But after dinner, I thought it would be a good touch to drizzle on a little lime juice, just before serving.  Sliced black olives seem to make sense to me, too.

We loved this recipe. Omitted the red and  yellow peppers...I like but my husband doesn't.  He thought it was a bit spicy and I even cut down on the red pepper. I thought the amount of red pepper was fine. If you have someone in your family that is a spicy wimp, might want to cut down on red pepper.

I made this nearly exactly as instructed except I used pre-cooked shrimp and threw those in later.  Also, because I had to open a can of clams for the juice, I went ahead and put in the claim pieces.  This turned out wonderfully...great flavor!  Thanks, I'll be making this again!!

I ended up tweaking it a bit based on another recipe I'd seen and it turned out perfect! Added 1/4 to 1/2 tsp. of saffon, just 1/2 tsp. red pepper, one tsp. lemonjuice and 2 green onions. It won rave reviews from my book club and had the perfect amount of kick!!

it was good but it was definitely missing something i didn't add all the pepper flakes only a third of what it called for used what it called for in garlic plus some garlic powder and also added some Parmesan cheese and Romano. I didn't like the pepper flakes next time i am going to hardly use any it gave a weird burn after taste that i didn't like i will definitely use even less next time

I loved this recipe.  But, I use store bought Alfredo sauce when I'm in a hurry.  It still turns out great.  I like the idea of adding scallops.  I will definately give that a try.  Maybe tonight.  :)

Loved this recipe. Followed it exactly except that I used half shrimp and half scallops (3/4 lb) and opted for angel hair pasta. The amount of red pepper flakes may be too spicy for some, but I enjoyed it. Warm bread made a good companion.

Made this recipe at the last minute because I hade all the ingredients; good base but was missing something.  My husband thought it was too spicy and lacking other flavors.  In the future I will use less red pepper flakes because they overpowered the dish.  I will increase the salt, lemon juice, clam juice, and pepper slightly.  Additionally, add some parmesan cheese and crusty bread.

Excellent! Followed recipe as is but used 1 teaspoon lemon zest with the juice. Next time would double sauce for 1 lb of pasta and would use large sized shrimp instead of medium. My husband loved it!!

I made this while camping at Hermit Island in Maine!! So good...very good!!!! I have made this dish twice....Love the sauce this makes so I double those ingredients and used already cooked shrimp...just added them at the very end. Made with fresh and dried parsley and have to say I didn't mind the dried(even though I prefer to use fresh for color!)

A new favorite!  This was delicious and not complicated to make.  I left out the bell peppers, simply because we don't care for them, used Pinot Grigio wine, and 1/2 the hot pepper.  I will cut the hot pepper even more next time.  I used a fat noodle, which sucked up the flavor wonderfully.  I did add the pasta water at the end, I felt it needed it as the noodles sucked up most of the sauce.  This recipe will definitely go into our regular rotation, it's great to play with and change as what you like or based on ingredients you have on hand.  A must try!

I made this tonight for my family. This recipe was super easy!! I added shallots with the garlic since I love onions. My wife loves bell peppers so I added extra, 3 bell and to be honest I wish I would have added more. This recipe is perfect for anyone wanting to try a shrimp dish. Add some bread and your good to go! A+

I made shrimp scampi for the first time tonight using this recipe and it was easy to follow! Next time I make it I will probably use less butter and fresh shrimp instead of frozen, but overall this was very good!

This was delicious and very easy! I made some changes from the original:  I used frozen medium shrimp that were mostly defrosted by running under cool water.  My son loves cream sauces, but I didn't want so much fat so I swapped out the heavy cream for 1/3 less fat cream cheese plus some skim milk.  I skipped the clam juice, added about half of the pasta water amount, and whisked the sauce while it bubbled.  My family has requested this again.  Thanks for the original recipe!

Absolutely loved it. As it was not a thick sticky  sauce and the flavours were distinct.  
Did not have clam juice and would have cooked shrimp immediately prior to mixing with the pasta  as I like my shrimp translucent in the middle. 
Overall one of the best shrimp and pasta dishes ever!

This was a scrumptious dish and I liked the versatility of it.  My own additions included fresh sliced button mushrooms and cherry tomatoes with the seeds removed.  I wanted a thicker sauce after adding the pasta water so I sprinkled some corn starch and stirred just so this delicious sauce stuck to the noodles.  I also cut back on the hot pepper flakes to about 1/2 tsp.  Definitely will make again.

This was my first time making a seafood linguine, and I had mixture of seafood to add. I was looking for a nice simple  sauce that wouldn't overpower the seafood. 
Besides adding different seafood (shrimp, scallops, lobster and salmon), I followed the recipe almost exactly - to get the sauce! The only two exceptions were garlic (I have an intoleranc, substituted chopped scallions) and clam juice (I made a broth by boiling up the shrimp peel). The result was pleasantly satisfying.  I found it hard to mix up the linguine and the seafood, so I tonged out the linguine, then scooped out the seafood on top.  Looking forward to the leftovers!

Oh so good! We loved it. I didn't have clam juice, so I subbed with chicken broth. I also added a splash more lemon juice and cut down on the red pepper flakes because my husband does not like them. I do, so I just added more to my plate. To be sure to have enough sauce, I doubled everything (except shrimp and pasta), and it was perfect. Because of that, I didn't add the pasta water at all. It was garlicy, lemony, and delicious! Just perfect with a fresh green salad and some crusty Italian bread.

My family loved this recipe. We fall on the wimpy side when it comes to "hot" food, so I used onions, mushrooms, and halved grape tomatoes (added at the end). I also followed the advice of another reviewer and thickened the sauce along with adding the clams with the clsm juice. I also decided to make it more a seafood scampi and added some crab. My husband Loved it!

Excellent, and I made as written. Next time, however, I will use less red pepper (shrimp flavor is fragile ad this drowned out the lemon, cream and shrimp flavors. Also, I will not add the shrimp back in for another 5 minutes. I will reserve it til the end and just add it before serving to warm it. It was dreadfully over Cooked!  Maybe I will add it in raw and then cook it the last 5 minutes. Either way, it does not need all the cook time.

Simple to make.  I was glad I almost doubled the ingredients for the sauce so it wasn't dry.  It seemed somewhat bland though.  I will make again but look for ways to spice it up!

Used green bell peppers only as that's what I had on hand. Also used some minced smoked garlic in addition to the sliced cloves. Added a bit more crushed red pepper just to give a little pop. Ended up leaving out the clam juice as I realized too late that I had none - turned out just fine and my family ate all but what was in the picture!  Two of us had 3rds, 3 of us had 2nds. Might make this a family favorite!

This recipe was OK. It definitely needed some salt, though. That certainly helped, but I also would have preferred it to have more sauce. I may or may not try it again with those tweaks.

The family loved the dish. We held back the crushed red peppers & let everyone add as they wished. We will try again using angle hair pasta. Also used 1/3 cups of peppers instead of 1/2 cups.

I never follow a recipe 100%, so with my minor adjustments, it was just alright. I used fat free sour cream instead of heavy. Probably could use something more flavorful and rich. I cut the pasta in half- I can't imagine using an entire pound. Way too much! I even used an entire bag of frozen peppers and onions. I would have been happy with less than 8oz of pasta. Not sure I'll make this again.

This is definitely worth making again! I did tweak it a bit; instead of using heavy cream, i used 3 tablespoons of plain yogurt. And i also added clams and scallops, and left out the red chili flakes and pasta water. It was good, however, it was a bit bland in my opinion. A good recipe nonetheless!

My 5 year old and myself made this. Minus the clam juice.. And less red pepper flakes. It came out delicious. We both enjoyed it!! I may add some scallops to it next time oh! And I did substitute the Chardonnay for some dry white cooking wine. So good. I'm thinking I can also add some green peppers and maybe some mushrooms. We will definitely be making this again! Thank you

I just made this tonight and we thought it was great. Since my husband loves spicy food it was right up his alley.  I squeezed a little lemon before I served it. Freshly ground pepper also enhanced the flavor. Next time I may chop some arugula and put it in for that little peppery flavor. A salad, a bottle of wine-perfect dinner. Thought I was still in Italy

This is absolutely amazing! I am by no means a good cook, but the combined efforts of my mom and I turned out a tasty product! I have some spice wimps in my family, so I cut the  red pepper flakes in half. The next time I made it, I had to sub cayenne pepper, but it was still fantastic! I've used dried parsley both times. I didn't have wine the second time I made it, so I used white grape/apple juice with a little lemon and chicken broth instead. Wonderful submission!

Just okay.  Needs more lemon juice and less red pepper flakes I think.
