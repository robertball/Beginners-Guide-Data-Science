Very different, and good.  I made it the night before and served it cold the next day.  I also really liked how it tasted warm, with the cheese all melty, before I baked it.  You could eat it just like that, too.  I had a hard time getting it out of the pan and recommend lining the bottom of your pan with parchment paper to make this easier.  I think I would take this to a summer cookout; its nice and refreshing for a hot day and something different from potato salad!

I LOVE Risotto so I couldn't wait to try this. DO use Italian Arborio Rice for this and all risotto dishes. I also add the chicken broth (heated) in about 3 amounts as it helps to soak.  I followed the recipe exactly and used a springform pan.  (Next time I'll try parmesan cheese instead) I made two and the first one I did not cook long enough so when I took it out it was not a beautiful brown color.  The second worked perfectly.

I have been looking for a recipe for this dish for years. I used to buy these cold from an Italian cafe. I adapted the recipe to their version- using a muffin pan to make individual cakes. I also threw in some corn kernels and chopped fresh asparagus and finally, drizzled with balsamic vinegar and served with a side salad. Thanks for the recipe!

I had something like this in a restaurant and this recipe was so close!  I used 1/2 parmesan 1/2 mozzarella.  I would definitely make this again and my husband asked me for the recipe to make it at the firehall so I know he liked it.

I used this recipe as a side dish to bring to a pig roast. Awesome recipe...everyone kept asking for the recipe. My husband was bummed that there wasn't any left to bring home. Instead of using leaks I used green onion. I also added garlic and ginger. I baked the rice in a muffin pan to get individual servings. I will definitly being cooking this again for my dinners at home as well as a side dish or appetizer to bring to gatherings. View the pics to see how these turn out when baking in the muffin pan.

I  saved this recipe last year. My father birthday was yesterday and I finally found an opportunity to use this recipe. I wanted to make something light, and bright to combat the incredibly sad weather we are having on the east coast right now… WOW this recipe did not disappoint. I was so impressed. This tasted like awesome slow made risotto and it was supper easy. I love risotto and I will probably never make the slow stove top version again… Why waste the time? Let the oven do the work! I doubled the recipe, but still used the same sized pan. It turned out light and fluffy. The leftovers were the perfect light lunch. I still have all the ingredients and I am going to make more of this latter this week… Everyone asked for the recipe because it was so super easy and so super good. I hope you enjoy it as much as my family did.

Love this recipe!  Great for a luncheon.  I omitted the chives, and used cilantro instead of parsely.  Also, you can change the chicken stock to vegtable stock and make a great vegetarian dish. It never really got crispy and cutable for me until I removed the foil and let it cook ~10 minutes without the foil.

I really enjoyed this recipe. I substituted a green onion for the leek and used a provolone/mozza/parmesan mix as well as freshly grated parmesan and it turned out really well! I will bake it for longer next time, as the middle was not quite set after half an hour. It was also very good (perhaps even better) cold the next day!

This was a great recipe.  My family really enjoyed, even the two "rice haters"!  When I flipped the pan over, it did stick a little, but I think it was still a little to warm when I did it.  The next time I make this, I might add a little lemon juice to the mix to give it a little zip of flavor.  If not, serve with the garnished lemon wedges and suggest your guests squeeze a little on their portion.  It is almost like chicken lemon rice soup without the soup!

Actually used risotto for the dish and since I forgot mozzarella at the store substituted parmesan.  In the interest of time decided to serve as risotto and not bake it, it was wonderful and a do over.

Very good.  I made it vegetarian with vegetable stock instead of chicken. It was tasty and everyone enjoyed it..

I really enjoyed the first bite of this but as I continued eating I wanted more lemon flavor inside(squeezing the lemon garnish over top didn't cut it). I liked the leek and chive flavor but I wished for a little yellow onion too. I wanted more herbs like  basil, marjoram or thyme. I wanted less cheese and a more flavorful cheese(Asiago maybe). I found myself adding lots of black pepper that I wish I had stirred in while it was cooking.

This recipe came out really well and was easy to put together.  The only thing I would change next time would be to use kitchen scissors to cut the leek stems crosswise because they were too long and I had to twirl the pieces around my fork like they were spaghetti in order to eat them!

Nice fresh taste.  Maybe a little too much lemon.  I would definitely make this again.  I did have to bake this for an additional 15 min to get the golden crust.  Definitely use the parchment paper on the bottom of the pan.

Fantastic!!! Super easy. even for a novice like me! I didn't have any tin foil and cooked it in a glass dish but it set and browned perfectly. I also added some red onion along with the leek. Turned out beautiful! Thankyou for restoring my newlywed husbands faith in my cooking skills! ;)

As another reviewer did, I decided to make into individual "muffins" (to cook faster). Very nice flavor and paired well with my Chicken Piccata and asparagas. Thank you, "Ken in CA", (from the Recipe Exchange), for suggesting, and EGRIVNER for sharing this different (for me, anyway) way to serve rice.

I typically like unusual dishes but this didn't really do much for me. It wasn't bad but I don't think I would make it again. It never really "baked". At 35 minutes it wasn't browned or firm at all so I left it in longer but all that did was make the edges VERY crispy.

Tasted good.  You know you're basically tasting the chicken stock but it still tastes good.  Mozzarella makes it chewy, so can add/reduce to tailor it to individual's preference for chewiness.  Simple dish.  Easy to make and easy to eat, especially for breakfast.

I loved this idea. I enjoyed the recipe, though used vegetable stock to make it vegetarian, and will try it with other risottos I like.  Thanks!

This was easy to make and had a refreshing lemon zing that set it apart from other risottos I've had. My boyfriend liked it as well.

I halved the recipe for the two of us.  The risotto cooked up beautifully but the overall result was bland tasting.  I love the concept, but this recipe needs a little more punch.

It has a nice flavor, but I found the edges too crunchy and it hurt my teeth.  I know it's a bit more work, but I'd rather use the same ingredients but make a traditional risotto.  Thanks for sharing.

My husband and I both enjoyed this recipe. I followed it to the letter, with the exception of using vegetable broth rather than chicken to make it vegetarian. Nice lemon taste overall. Made a wonderful light dinner with a salad.

This was absolutely wonderful, very aromatic and quite easy to make.  This will be a great new addition for my collection - family loved it!
