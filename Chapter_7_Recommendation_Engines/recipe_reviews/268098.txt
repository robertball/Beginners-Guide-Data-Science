One suggestion: Drop the first batch of french-fried onions atop the mix after stirring it in the instant pot. If you stir it in, it increases the chances of getting a "burn" warning." 

Very quick and good recipe!

Liked the flavor.  Followed the directions exactly but the dish came out too watery and grainy. Did not thicken to our preferred point. Too much corn starch?  Not enough?  Weâ€™ll blame this attempt on our cornstarch - maybe old. As for making it again... will try the recipe but use the oven. Can fix any problems as we go that way. Still... liked the flavor .

I have made this recipe at least half a dozen times and never once got a burn notice. If you follow the directions exactly as stated, you will not get the burn notice.
