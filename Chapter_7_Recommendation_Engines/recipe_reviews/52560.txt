This turned out great... BUT there should be a warning in the recipe for us beginners- do not slice habanero peppers with your bare hands!!  I still can't eat the next morning with my hands- my lips are burning off if I touch them.  Washing with soap and water will NOT help.  Best bet- wear gloves.

I just called my husband to tell him that I couldn't promise there would be any chili left for him for dinner tonight!  I did tinker a bit with the recipe, but nothing drastic.  I cut the recipe in 1/2 first.  I don't like beef, so I use a turkey and sausage mixture for most anything calling for it(1/2 and 1/2), ommitted all peppers, used 1 (15 oz.) can Mexican chili beans instead of kidney beans, used an 8 oz. can of tomato sauce, and added 1/2 tsp of cumin to the orginal spices.  It came out absolutely amazing.  Thick, a bit spicy (not much b/c I have two small children), and wonderful with Club crackers.  No more buying chili in a can for me, ever!  Thanks so much for the recipe.  I love it!

Good , basic chili. Since it requires 3 cans of tomato sauce I shouldn't have been surprised that it tasted so 'tomatoey'...but I was. Also, be careful with the habaneros. They are evil hot! Don't touch your eyes after chopping them. Of course your fingers will be tingling a little after handling them so I doubt you'll forget. Next time, I'll reduce the amount of tomato sauce and use a variety of peppers.

Oh boy, this is like the best chili we've ever had.  The only thing I did different is I added some brown sugar to take away some of the tomatoeness, but, I always do that to my tomato based dishes. It helps with the taste.  We loved it and will be making this again. We're going to buy some hot dogs and serve this over them. Yum!!

This chili is extremely bland.  No flavor.  Liked the peppers and onions though.  We added the spices from Flatlander chili and it was much better.  Still needed heat though.  Would not make it again.

Yum, great recipe.  I only used one pound of ground beef and one can of tomato sauce and a can of diced tomatoes, then added some cumin, oregano and a teaspoon of cocoa.  I also skipped the habanero and added a sprinkle of ground red pepper instead of the hot sauce.  This is great served with tortilla chips and tastes even better the second day.  It's great served with a little shredded cheddar and some fresh chopped onion.

This is a very good recipe.  I cooked for football game and people loved it.  I added a can of hot rotel tomatoes (drained) to give it an extra kick.

I thought this was really good! I have never made chili before, but it turned out great! I added 2 cloves of garlic with the peppers and onions, and used an extra can of tomato sauce. I ended up putting in about 3 tsp. of sugar to cut back on the acidity from the tomatoes. I also left out the pepper, so it wasn't very spicy, but I added a little bit of Cayenne pepper. Will definitely make again!

Loved it.  Like others, I skipped the habanero and used one can of Rotel tomatoes, then made up the difference with tomato sauce.  Topped with shredded cheddar.  Good, hearty meal.

This was tasty recipe.  I usually like my chilli a little thicker than what this recipe makes.  I will make this again, but next time I'll only add one can of tomatoe sauce, and try 2 cans of diced tomatoes instead.  It is also very spicy!!!  So caution is advised!  Don't add an extra habanero like I did.  I love spicy stuff, but with the extra habanero it was a little over the top.

I made this for a Bridal Shower of 30 people and it turned out WONDERFUL - Everyone raved about it and it was really easy to make.  I did leave out the hababero because I am always afraid to add "heat" to items since you can not remove it once it is in there!

I made this Sunday for football, and it came out great, although, I added too much salt and wasnt sure how to fix this!! I ended up adding a can of rotel diced tomatoes with green chili, I figured this would also accomodate for the missing habanero pepper...After my salt disaster, this meal was great, oh yeah and GONE by the end of the game! Thank you!

This chili was really good. I didn't care for all the green peppers so next time I make it I will leave those out.

this was a great recipe for someone (a college student) just learning how too cook.  It was easy, and made great leftovers.  my only change was cutting back on the beans.

This is great chili. I don't eat meat so I made this without obviously and instead of 3 cans of tomato sauce I did 2 cans sauce and 1 can of tomato paste because without the meat I was worried it would be too soupy. It turned out just like my mom's chili. I've been trying to get that recipe for years and this is as close as I will ever get. Great recipe thanks!

I found this to be a wonderful recipe.  I made some modifications with the amount of spices.
I added more garlic and chili pepper.  I also added black pepper and left out the beans (not a big fan of them) and also the habnero pepper.  It was great the first night and even better when I had it for lunch the next day.  Thank You Brandy.  I will be making this again and again.  -Melissa

Fantastic chili! The habanero peppers didn't make it in (this time) but it was still very tasty. I added black beans, left out the green peppers and used diced tomoatoes with green chiles. I let it cook for about 90 minutes and ate with oyster crackers...and as always, it's even better the next day! Yummm.

This chili was pretty good.  I did add extra spices to it though.  I tripled the chili powder and and added some cumin.  I think if I hadn't done that, it would have been too bland.  It was nice and thick though.

This chili was good! Not the best, but easy and tasty. I don't like soupy chili so i took the advice of a previous reviewer and used only 2/3s of the tomato sauce and added a can of diced tomatoes.  Also, to keep it on the lighter side, I used ground turkey instead of beef. In the end it lacked a little somthing, so I added a cube of mexican chocolate and a dash of cumin and that made it really yummy!
Over all, this is a quick, easy, and tasty chili.

The two stars are just for thickness.  I didn't care for this chili.  It doesn't have any other taste but tomatoes.  Won't be making this again.

Very good recipe! I changed it a little bit by adding 2 cloves of minced garlic, and instead of habenero pepper I did 2 jalepeno peppers not seeded.

Excellent ~ I only used 1/2 habanero, but could have used the whole thing.  I added extra hot sauce (Frank's), and a pinch of ground cumin seed.  I also added some elbow macaroni because I like chili-mac!  One more thing, a half a bottle of beer added right before simmering was great to add also!

I've made this several times during this Winter season, and it's delicious! We don't like food that's too spicy, so I eliminated the peppers and the super-hot hot pepper sauce. It's just right! Not too spicy, but yet has awesome taste.
I would recommend this anyone!

Delicious!  Used 1-1/3 lbs ground beef, 2/3 lb chorizo because that was what we had thawed in the refrigerator.  Used two cans tomato sauce, two cans Hunt's Fire Roasted diced tomatoes, two cans kidney beans (one light, one dark).  Fresh ingredients consisted of two bell peppers, one poblano pepper, one jalapeno pepper, and three cloves of garlic.  Used spices as found in the recipe, but added two teaspoons of unsweetened cocoa for a distinct flavor.  
Served with the "Golden Sweet Cornbread" recipe found on this website, this stuff was gone before I got a chance to grab some at our company potluck.

This was the first time I ever made chili, and I have to say it turned out pretty good.  However, I did add a bit more habanero pepper because I like it hot, however it wasnt a great idea, as it turned out to be a little too hot.  It was still really good though.

My husband and daughter loved this chili because of its thickness. Personally, I thought it was too "tomatoey" and was planning to add a little bit of sugar to combat the acidity of the tomatoes when they went on and on about this chili. I would rate it between a 3.5 and 4 for my personal taste. Thought it lacked heat and spice.

I used 1/2 sausage and 1/2 hamburger, based on what I had available in the freezer, and the taste was excellent.  This recipe received rave reviews from my wife and son--both somewhat particular eaters.  This recipe doesn't offer chunks of tomato, which I missed a little, but the flavor was excellent.  I used several drops of hot sauce and probably 1/2 teaspoon of hot wings sauce and though the chili was hotter than a normal batch, I didn't end up with a flavor even close to tex/mex hot.  If you like HOT, consider adding more hot sauce than the recipe calls for -- but use caution (add a little at a time).

Great Chili!  I added hot chili beans and had a jalapeno instead of the hotter pepper, but it worked out nicely.  Everyone in my family loved it!  I will use this as my basic chili recipe.

with some grated cheese on top and a big dollup of sour cream - this chili has become a household favorite!  and if you don't like it hot, it still has great flavor without the harbanero pepper.  it also freezes very well for quick meals down the road.

This recipe was indeed wonderful!  I carefully added every ingredient and followed the recipe using the exact measurements and quantities.  I made the chili the night before a heavy snow, somthe next day I announced to my family and neighbours when they had enough of the white stuff they could come in and enjoy some of the red hot stuff.    No my hair is blonde I was referring to the chili!  

Now, I've been using Allrecipes for about a year now and so what I'm about to write is certainly something you've heard before........ But how..... please tell me how can anyone rate a recipe, this recipe, their mothers recipe or even  the dogs recipe if they make changes to the recipe.?  If you make changes to someone's recipe have the decency to pay the fee to become a pro and post your newly revised recipe.  With any luck someone will make your newly revised recipe as its posted and rate it accordingly...

I was making chili for 25 people. So I modified the recipe a little. 2 pounds of turkey and 2 pounds of beef. I added pinto beans, kidney beans and black beans...to make it different. Big can of Tomato sauce and a big can of diced tomatoes. I added chili powder ( I got this seasonig for chili ready to use). Some sugar. Oh yeah....white and green onions. Garlic. Also, I added turkey broth. YUM! Everyone ate and they had more. Cheddar cheese on top and corn bread.

Delicious!  I made for four and used can of sweet onion diced tomatoes and one small can tomato sauce.  Also plenty of peppers and about 1-1/2 cups of leftover pork & beans.   Wonderful flavor.  And since my husband is on low salt diet no extra salt yet it was salty enough and very flavorful.

Did this recipe on a Boy Scout camping trip.  Did not use the hot sauce nor the hot pepper.  Used instead of the Jalapeno (sp). Scouts loved it and it came in 2nd place in the chili cook-off out of 16 other chili entries.

Pretty good overall, but the flavor wasn't as strong as I was hoping.  It is a good one with cheese, crackers and sour cream on top.

I've made this dish several times, and it's become one of my favorites.  As with most great chilies, it just gets better after an overnight stay in the fridge.  I enjoy this over rice, or simply by itself.  Great, simple, and filling!
