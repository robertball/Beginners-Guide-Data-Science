This recipe was absolutely delicious!  I made it tonight for dinner, and my husband had two servings.  Very tasty.  I did substitute soy meat for the kasha and bulgar, and added a little rosemary, but other than that the flavor was wonderful and I will definitely make this again!

I cannot have a pie without a bottom crust at least. Adding that gives this recipe some of the savory-ness to send it over the top. I also added some leftover green bean casserole and because my husband brought home a couscous mix rather than plain couscous, 'n that seasoning packet (Marakesh Express Wild Mushroom) added something so it wasn't overly bland. [Husband still wanted meat and gravy, but teenaged son said, Mmm...mushrooms!]

This was a hit at Thanksgiving! It does take a while in prep time, but is worth it. Very good flavors and textures. It also freezes well. I have made it several times since November and my family loves it.

The kasha and bulgar did not impress me.  The rest of the recipe works pretty well, but I think I'll look for a recipe that uses fake meat next time for my Shepard's pie fix.
