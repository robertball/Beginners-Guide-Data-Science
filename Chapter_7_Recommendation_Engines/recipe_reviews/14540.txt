Best steak I have ever made!  BTW -- I did deviate a bit from the written instructions.  I used 2 good sized ribeye steaks.  (it's what I had.)  Also, I didn't have the sesame oil, so I used Canola.  Also, my oranges were being sorta lame, and didn't want to zest, so I used what zest I could get, and used some of the juice (maybe a few tablespoons) for good measure.  One tip if you live near a Safeway or Vons grocery store, their store brand Teriyaki (in the asian foods section - I think it is called safeway select) worked beautifully in this.  And the bottle was only 1.79 for 10 ounces.  Very affordable!  Also, I didn't have a grill, so I just pan fried, if you call it that, with a bit of the marinade.  Oh, and I marinated it in a ziploc for about 3 hours.  It was seriously fantastic!!

Delicious.  I only marinated it for 2 hours but it should have been marinated for a longer time.  Still the steak was nice and juicy and tender.

This is for sure a teriyaki maranade. Was good but a little strong, I may have let the meat stay in the maranade to long, I think 3 - 4 hrs. max.would lighten the taste. Will use this again as guest left nothing but the bone. Thanks Sandi

I have made this recipe several times in my crockpot. Use the same ingredients for the marinade and instead of marinading, just pile them in the crockpot with the flank steak. They make wonderful teriyaki beef sandwiches! Just pull the meat apart after cooking. I make some challah dough  (Bread Machine Challah I) in my bread machine and bake it into large buns to serve with it. This is a family favorite and has been served to company!

Great recipe!  It tones down the harshness of the bottled teriyaki sauce, and adds fresh flavor.  Plus, you get to say you made the sauce, where you can't say that with the bottled ones.

Didn't have sesame oil so used canola and only used about half the amount of teriyaki sauce.  Marinated most of the day.  All else the same and family loved it. Thanks!

I liked this recipe, although my boyfriend wasn't as thrilled. Be sure to use a good teriyaki sauce as it's the primary ingredient. I also think the ginger adds an element that probably isn't necessary unless you love ginger.

This was pretty good -- not spectacular.  I followed the recipe exactly.  Will probably make again.
