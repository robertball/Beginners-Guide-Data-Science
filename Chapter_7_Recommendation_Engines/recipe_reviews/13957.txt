Added extra cheese cut in small chunks(used a lite variety). Added more corn, a 1/2 can of creamed corn, some chopped cauliflower (about 3/4 cup), and 2 Tbsps mild jalepeno peppers, chopped. Added little more flour and baking powder and fried this like fritters, and.... oh my - they turned out delicious! Try them spread with a little hot pepper jelly.

I tried these last night, but with the following changes: I had a leftover zucchini so I grated it and tossed it into the batter, I had a 12oz can of corn so I drained it and used the whole thing, I used olive oil instead of butter, and I grated and extra half a cup of cheese and topped the cooked pancakes with it. We're vegetraians, so it was our dinner main dish. I served this with spicy black bean salsa and sour cream. My fiance really loved them. I'd say they are worth a try, but perhaps as a southwest/mexican type dish - not a sweet breakfast one.

I tried out this recipe last week, and found the results to be mediocre. SO, I tried it again this weekend with some changes. I raided a PACKET OF POWDERED CHEESE from a mac n'cheese box and stirred it into 1/4 cup SOUR CREAM and stirred that into the batter. Also, I added 1/2 cup more shredded CHEDDAR CHEESE and the pancakes were superb!

These were good, but we found that they could use more cheese.  We flipped the pancake, then sprinkled on extra cheese.  That made them better!

These were good, I'd call them corn cakes instead of pancakes and I was told by the dad I made them for today that they were dry. He had never heard of making them with cornmeal so may be a little less cornmeal?

I tried this and added a few things to change it up a little with leftovers. I added some cream corn with the liquids and some left over chicken I had.  served it with sour cream and salsa it was a hit.

Too much corn meal made them a little too firm, would prefer more leavaning too.

I loved these - we went for a more southwest style meal. Here's what we did: add a 4oz can diced chilies, and serve topped with refried beans, sour cream, salsa, and sliced avocados.  I was looking for a recipe that could work this way, and this one totally does.  I have added grated zucchini, chopped sauteed onions, chopped kale, and other veggies to the batter in the past with great results.  I'm not sure I would like these with maple syrup...but great for dinner with all the toppings!

This is a great recipe.  I substituted whole wheat flour for white and used havarti cheese.  YUMMY I froze some and they held up fine.

I decreased the corn meal to 2/3 cup and increased the flour by 1/3 cup.    ** I local restaurant (ower is from S.America) serves corn cakes with COTILLA cheese to be sprinkled (generously) on top.  It a white cheese that can be grated (not as firm of a texture as parmesan or romano - it's light and has a hint of sea salt).  It's an awesome addition (the sweet & salt contrast with the syrup)!  Our large food chains carry it but I'm sure there are parts of the country where you might need to look for it at a cheese specialty shop or a grocery that caters to the Hispanic community.

Noah, 7 yrs. old, says, "These are yummy!"

We substituted fresh corn, boiled and cut off the cob. We added more flour and corn meal after mixing in the corn until the batter stuck together.

My family enjoyed them for breakfast.  I did omit the corn and cheese, but will try with cheese next time.  Thanks for sharing.

I really liked these, and my husband thought that they were pretty good too, which is a big compliment coming from him. We just had them for breakfast with maple syrup and think that these pancakes would be better showcased at dinner with a mexican/southwestern meal.  They reminded me of the corn side dish you get at Chi Chi's ~ which is one of my favorites!  I followed the recipe exactly except for we found only a 15 oz. can of corn and used the whole thing (drained as the recipe states). I would maybe at a bit more sugar, but these are definetly a keeper! Thanks for this yummy recipe!

I actually wanted a chocolate chip pancake recipe, but alas there were'nt ANY except one which I could not and did not want to use. So I saw this recipe and since I *Love* cheese and corn and corn breadI figured this would be a *GREAT* recipe!!! 

 Well I am eating the cakes right now, and they're not bad. I always *loathe* syrup so I am eating them without syrup. They're good except I added an extra cup of cheese and I STILL can't hardly taste the cheese. But I expected that so that's why I added extra cheeze. If you like Sweet Pancakes these are NOT for you, but if you like something more along the line of regular bread then you prolly love these, but also if you're lookin' for something new you should give'm a try!!! They may taste better with syrup, but they're STILL *GOOD*(to me). Prolly will make em again!!!

God Bless ~Amy

End result was attractive, but overall, pancakes were heavy and laden with cornmeal taste. Cheese melted, so we couldn't taste it. Fiance (who dares to try new things and thinks pancakes should be a staple) didn't like at all. They were only edible soaked in syrup. Our quest continues...

Here's a tip:  I didn't have cornmeal in the house but I did have a cornbread mix.  I substituted 1 cup of the cornbread mix for the cornmeal and the pancakes turned out great!  I served these for breakfast so I omited the cheese and added a teaspoon of vanilla.
Great tasting pancakes!!

Very, very, very good! I added the 1/2 can cream corn someone mentioned, but that was my bad because I had about 1/4 cup of my cornmeal in the bag left and I didn't want to waste it, so I thought they'd even each other out. And I don't know if it needed it, but I used a 1/2 packet of the Mac-n-cheese powder because I probably had about 3/4th of the cheese needed. 
I doubled the recipe and I'm SO glad I did - made to serve with my chili - all rave reviews around. OH - I did add 2 tbsp butter before each batch of four both to cool the pan and for added flavor. Less healthy but I thought it took it right over the top! 
Most definitely making again - heck, we might have leftovers in the morning with maple syrup with a dash of chipotle powder in it. That too is awesome!!!
