I enjoyed these pops and will be making them more often this summer. Nice change from the more 'traditional' flavors. For an even creamier richer pop use half the water. My preference was to also use half the Agave and no salt. I liked using Agave because I didn't have to make a simple syrup. Don't forget to lightly bang your pop mold on the counter a few times to 'burp' out any air bubbles. Great recipe that is an ideal way to use extra avocados and is easily adjustable to personal taste.

So, so good! I used a whole lime. Might go even limier next time and maybe a bit less agave - it's not too sweet, this is just my taste. I keep thinking that they are like vegan creamsicles. My mother-in-law has a recipe for vegan chocolate pudding that is basically avocado, maple syrup, a bit of lime juice and a bunch of cocoa powder to taste. I think you could make vegan fudgesicles using this concept just by adding some water to thin. Will be making again / experimenting with the inspiration!

My 10 yr. old son and I love avocado smoothies that I make at home with ice, milk and sugar. I had to try this recipe when I saw it. It was very yummy and it is handy for when you have a lot that are ripe and can't figure out what to do with 'em all. Healthy dessert too! Thanks.

Did not like these as much as I liked a different avocado popsicle recipe I made "here." The creaminess was nice though.

thought it was ok, but kids didn't care for it at all.  even made in ice trays for smaller portions (as it can be quite rich), but still not a winner in our home.

This recipe is great! I did add extra lime. Made it once with honey instead of agave because we ran out. It was good, but the flavor was a little off.
