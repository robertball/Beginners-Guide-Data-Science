I had some ripe bananas and flour tortillas to use this morning and the kids didn't want something hot and opted out of cereal, so I made this. I actually used chunky peanut butter and strawberry jam. For added crunch, I sprinkled on some homemade granola. The kids loved them. Next time, I'll use jam or honey--not both.

Wow - this was really good! I love peanut butter and I swear just about anything you stick in a tortilla is bound to be good. I didn't have apricot jelly, so I used the kind I had on hand along with reduced fat peanut butter. Try adding raisins or miniature chocolate chips for something a little different. I cut it in half diagonally and seved it with an ice cold glass of milk! Hat's off to the inventor of this tasty little treat - Merrick!

Easy and fun recipe to make and eat. However, upon reading this recipe was created by an 8 year old child, I found the suggested "what to drink" "suggestion box" (to the right) a little perplexing when it suggested "Beer" rather than Milk.  Suggest hiding the beer from those after school treats.

My son loves this! I make a bit different though. Instead of using jelly we dice up half an apple and sprinkle that over the peanut butter, add the banana slices then sprinkle on some raisins. This is a great easy meal to eat on the run for sport practices!

How about just Nutella and bananas?  We loved these in Germany.

I fed this to my 4-year old son for lunch today, and he gobbled it up!  I scaled the recipe to use a small 6-inch, whole wheat tortilla and I used blueberry jam in place of the apricot jelly (only because that's what I had on hand).  The end result was consumed in record speed!  This will be a favourite go-to in our house!!

Sounds good, but Beer for what to drink? Maybe Milk would be better.

A sticky, but tasty alternative to a typical PB&J! I love trying out new, fun lunch ideas for my pre-schooler, and this one fit the bill. I used a 6" tortilla, Whole Foods' freshly-ground honey roasted P.B., peach preserves, and a drizzle of blackberry honey. I zapped the tortilla (wrapped in a dry dishtowel) in the microwave for 10 sec. b4 spreading on the ingredients. I'm tempted to try this recipe out as a grilled quesadilla next time around, moreso for myself, b/c I think peanut butter + bananas = chewing bliss.

I make this a little differently.  Tortilla, 1 TBSP Peanut Butter, and one small banana.  Mine are really sweet and healthy with a low sugar content and only 250 calories instead of the 459 that this recipe has.

It was SO yummy.  When I made it, I added in raisins and used grape jelly instead of apricot jelly.  My younger siblings LOVED it, even though I used whole wheat tortillas.
