!!!AWESOME!!! I made this recipe last night for dinner. My husband, two children and I loved this recipe.
I washed the chicken and then I pan seared it with extra virgin olive oil and Promise butter and then I poked both sides of the chicken with the fork while they were cooking. I then took a fairly large lemon and coated the bottom of my pan and then I added the lemon pepper, garlic powder and onion powder on each side of the chicken breast. Before I put them into the oven I added a dab of butter to each chicken breast and then squeezed the remainder of the lemon onto the breast. I then baked them in the oven @ 350 degrees for 20-25 minutes. You will not be disappointed. A family favorite

I came across this recipe one night when I absolutely had nothing on hand and needed a good quick meal.  I never measured any of the ingredients, I just sprinkled both sides of the chicken breasts with the spices and then browned them on both sides in a large skillet with some white wine, lemon juice and butter.  Then I baked them in the oven to finish them for about 20 minutes at 375.  The white wine really made the chicken juicy and tender, and the lemon juice and butter helped give it a creamy sauce to pour over the chicken when serving.

This is a great easy recipe, but it takes a good deal longer to cook in the oven than the recipe calls for.

I made quite of bit of changes but over all still lemon-pepper chicken.
I put frozen chicken breast in oven to thaw for 10 min, this made its owen juice. I sprinked italian seasoning and some Mrs. Dash. Squarded about tsp of real lemon juice in the juice. Cut up two cloves of garlic and scallions and put right on top with pepper. Creates a great fresh aroma. The last ten minutes added minute rice (soaked in water in a cup to make soft so it cookes througly) into the dish and covered with tin foil.
               Fantastic 
creamy lemon,pepper,garlic,herb,onion chicken and rice.

Last evening I took some short cuts with this recipe, and it was very tasty.
I put 2 Tblsp margarine, 2 Tblsp chicken broth and a dash of Real Lemon in a medium frying pan with 9" base.  Tenderized two breasts so they would cook faster.  Sprinkled them with lemon pepper and garlic salt, as others suggested.  Browned them well on both sides and put them in the oven for 15 minutes while I prepared some vegetables.  This will definitely be added to my favorites.

Recipe great.  I used fresh onions and served all on a rice pilaf.  Also used more lemon pepper than the recipe calls for.

I have been making this recipe for a long time with both fresh onions and the onion/garlic powder.  I have also used some roasted garlic in place of the garlic powder in the past.  The flavors of the lemon pepper, garlic, and onion all meld together nicely for this chicken.  Only thing I can add on the review is that it seems to take longer to bake in the oven, but that could be just my oven too.

I thought this would be too bland, so I substituted garlic salt for the garlic powder and cooked it on my George Foreman grill...tasty and low fat too!

This chicken is fabulous!  We seared the chicken in butter and olive oil, and added lemon juice to the baking dish.  Our whole family loved it.

This has got to be the easiest way to make this type of Chicken.  The only hard part is waiting for it to cook so you can sink your teeth into something good.  Goes good with Stuffing with Chicken gravy.

This recipe was an excellent start to nice juicy chicken. I took the advice of several below and seared the chicken in 1/2 tablespooon of olive oil. Then I added 1/4 cup lemon juice and 1/4 cup white wine and let simmer for approx 3-5 minutes. You could even use less liquid if you wanted to. Once the chicken was browned and the liquid reduced, I placed the chicken in a lightly greased oven safe dish and then put the spices as per this recipe.

I topped the chicken with more lemon juice and white wine. I added about 1/4 cup each, BUT found this was too much. I would do this again and only add 1/4 cup of lemon juice and white wine together (NOT each).... 

Baked the chicken in the oven for 45 minutes and turned half way through. Delicious! So tender and juicy it was awesome!

This is a very tasty recipe. It was very simple to make as it took me less than 5 minutes to prepare it. This is a great recipe to make especially if you're short on time to prepare a meal. I put all of the ingredients in a bowl and mixed them up before adding it on both sides of the chicken. Of note, the proportion  for each of the ingredients - lemon pepper, garlic powder and onion powder - had to be increased to make sure the chicken was well coated. Further, to ensure the chicken was properly cooked, I put it in the oven for 40 minutes at 400 degrees. Safe to say, this was a very tasty dish and as mentioned, it was very easy to make. I will definitely make this recipe again.

I needed a quick chicken recipe and this one fit the bill perfectly. I only made 3 breasts, but used the same amount of spices, after reading reviews that it was a little bland on taste. 
I also baked the chicken in a dish with 1 TBL of melted butter, 2 TBL of lemon juice, and a couple sprinkles of garlic salt. I added a dot of butter to the top of each breast and baked it as called for in the recipe. It was amazing, very juicy and tender. 
I used the leftover breast and cut it up for chicken wraps for lunch..YUM! Thanks for a great recipe.

I LOOOOOVE Chicken, I usually havent found a chicken I don't like. This looked good but was VERY bland and I even used real garlic! and it just had a very bizzare flavor. I also think there is too much onion. I won't be making this again.

Love it!! I didnt measure seasonings but I used a ton more than called for. I also added sesoning salt and more back pepper. I put a dollop of canola oil on each piece of chicken. Also I cooked it in a greased glass baking pan. Make sure to cover the pan  with aluminum foil to keep the chicken moist and flavorful. It's super easy n super flavorful!!

I absolutely LOVED this recipe! I didn't follow the recipe as directed though. I did follow fellow reviews and browned my chicken first, then I baked it for about 25 minutes. I used lemon pepper, garlic powder, and a tad bit of garlic salt. I also squeezed some fresh lemon juice on my chicken when I was browning it. This was such a flavorful recipe! I served it over pesto pasta. DELICIOUS!

Good!  I did what many before me did, I used butter and olive oil to help keep the chicken moist.  I ran out of garlic powder so I used minced garlic.

We made this for gluten-intolerant company, and it was a big hit!  Typically I'm not a fan of lemon or pepper flavors, but this was good, not too overpowering, just right.  I even had seconds.

Simple and tasty! I wanted to top a Caesar salad with some chicken and this was perfect. I butterflied and pounded the chicken breast first, pan-seared it with a bit of olive oil and finished it off in the oven. I only made one breast and seared it on medium-high heat for about 2 minutes on each side and baked @ 350 for 12 minutes. Will make again!

It was okay. It would be much better if it would have marinated in the seasoning with some butter for an hour or so.

My family loved this recipe.  I covered the chicken with extra virgin olive oil, then kosher salt, lemon pepper, garlic powder and onion powder.  It did take 20 min. per side to cook all the way through.  Very tasty.  Roasted garlic potatoes are a great side to this dish.

DELISH!! Seared the chicken in a little white wine and chicken broth first, then baked them for about 40 minutes with lemon pepper, onion salt and garlic powder, as well as a little more wine and broth.

My boyfriend LOVES lemon pepper chicken, so I make it frequently. I actually cook the chicken breasts first in the skillet to brown on the outside (about 7 minutes each side, seasoned) and then bake for about 15-20 minutes in the oven. I also like to drizzle the chicken in EVOO, lemon juice and some extra seasoning to allow for it to make a small amount of sauce in the dish. Great served with rice.

This was my first time using lemon pepper on chicken will be using again. Wonderful dish flavorful and tender. I did not have any onion powder, so i used dried onions. I also used more than 1 teaspoon of lemon pepper and more than a pinch of garlic powder.

Very quick and easy recipe. The chicken was tender coming out of the oven. I would add other spices next time however and perhaps some more pepper.

It was a bit bland tasting, but because it is so easy and simple I will try it again and just up the spices. I dotted the chicken with some butter.

I just made this recipe for dinner. With in the first 10 minutes the whole house smelld great. So I was very let down when we finally ate it. I baked with the skin on (for my boyfriend) so when I took the skin off to eat it, the chicken had no flavor. Maybe next time I will bake with the skin off so the seasonings penetrate the meat....

This was amazing! My fiance's trying to get in shape for bootcamp, so I decided to give it a try. It was absolutely perfect. The chicken literally melted in your mouth. It was even soft enough for my baby to eat. My fiance is still raving about it, and I will definitely be making this again.

I made this chicken tonight, and I thought it came out really bland. I even added some real lemon juice to make it more flavorful as suggested by some reviewers. I think next time I will use much more seasoning, and bake it in a foil pack so it won't dry out. I may even make a little butter-lemon pan sauce to add extra flavor kick. Overall, it needs more pizazz for my tastebuds to be happy.

It was very good. I did make a few changes because I did not have chicken breast, only chicken thighs and they worked amazingly. I also seared the chicken in the frying pan with some butter to crisp the outside, and then put the chicken in the oven for 25 mins instead of 15 due to the thickness of my chicken. I will use this recipe again.

I used Gracie's idea with the lemon juice and this came out amazing. Even my 7 year old daughter who hates meat ate it and has requested it again. Delicious! Thanks! The recipe as written is an excellent starter recipe to play with as well. Thanks!

This was a great recipe, I used a lot more lemon and pepper in my recipe though. That is how my mother always made her version. Great recipe overall! Thanks!

I didn't use exact measurements, but the ingredients were kept pretty much the same (I used lawry's garlic salt as opposed to garlic powder and lots of black pepper) I seared the chicken in butter and olive with with some garlic and shallots and then baked the chicken for a half hour or so.  I got lots of compliments from my husband and my sister.  great recipe :)

My boyfriend and I both love this recipe.We can easily change it to suit our tastes or the amount of chicken breasts.I also used Garlic salt rather than powder and covered the chicken breasts in extra virgin olive oil.This recipe is one that will stick for quite awhile!

Delicious! I took other reviewers advice and added lemon juice and browned them in a skillet first with the lemon juice and also broiled it for 5 minutes after it was cooked. Definately will make again! DH says 4 stars I say 5 so 4 1/2 :p

Great- just great!  I used the lemon juice as well, like other reviewers.  I made this for 2 people so there was room in the dish...I added a bag of frozen cauliflower/broccoli arranged around the chicken, seasoned with garlic salt.  Cooked perfectly in the time allotted.  Quick, easy, light, and delicious.  Thanks!

Really good recipe!  The only thing I changed was a put some lemon juice on the bottom of my dish before I put the chicken in.  It gave it a little extra lemon taste.  My husband, 3 year old, & 10 month old all loved it!!!!

This was delicious! It was easy and my son, who has food allergies, was able to eat it. It was nice to prepare a meal we all could eat. Next time, I will make extra to cut up onto pasta or a salad.

The Earth moved at the dinner table tonight....my entire family loved this chicken!! (This never happens!!) Thank you for sharing a healthy, easy, & delicious recipe :) The only change I made was to sear the chicken in some olive oil & white wine before baking as suggested by some other reviewers.

This recipe is great.  I added some lemon juice to the baking pan to really bring out the lemon flavor, and I added a little salt and pepper as well.  It goes great with egg noodles sprinkled with garlic powder and melted butter :)

I very much liked one reviewers idea of mixing everything up in the same pan you cook the chicken in (saving an extra bowl to clean), I halved the honey, used minced rosemary and oregano, lemon-flavored olive oil and then covered the pan for half the baking time.  This trick produces a lot of liquid in the pan and cuts way back on the number of times you have to baste.  Once the chicken was cooked (which took me an hour because the breasts were on the bone and HUGE) I sliced it and tossed the meat with some of the baking liquid.  This ratchets the flavor up enormously.

This was fine, but it needed a little more zip. Next time I will add extra seasonings and be sure to brine the chicken first. Also, I don't know if it's just my oven or what, but I had to cook the chicken breasts almost twice as long as recommended before they were cooked through. If I make this recipe again, I'll be sure to cut this into filets or nuggets first, which I think might add more seasoning all the way through, and would make this cooking time more accurate.

It was okay. The chicken was a little dry. I used thinly cut chicken breast. The recipe definitely needs to be altered but it is a good start.

I made many of the changes suggested by the other reviewers and still didn't love it. DH and kids liked it.  I don't think it will make it into my list of go to recipes.

I also used more spice than the recipe calls for, browned the chicken and then baked, covered with foil for 30 minutes at 350.  I did not need to turn the pieces that way. I served with pan gravy, baked potato, and spinach.

We are on a lowfat/calorie diet so I was looking for a recipe like that. I had a bag of raw chicken breast tenders that I wanted to use. I added some olive oil to a skillet and went by the recipe but used Lemon herb seasoning. I was SHOCKED at how flavorful it was!! It was really good!! I made lemon rice and red leaf salad with garlic and herb dressing and every bit was gone!!! We LOVED it and there was no guilt afterwards!! If you cook your chicken in Olive oil the lemon herb seasoning sort of makes its own gravy. It was very juicy and tender!! Thank you for the recipe!! We will be using it often!!

I followed the recipe to the T. Wish I would have read everyones reviews before cooking it but there was no time as we were running REALLY late for dinner. It tasted okay and it only took the 30 minutes to cook the chicken but the flavor didn't really soak into the chicken.

Very good, very tasty, but I made a few changes. I used boneless chicken breasts that I cut into strips. I browned the chicken in butter about 3 minutes on each side on med. high, removed the chicken and made a quick sauce with the pan dripping, 2/3 cup of chicken broth, 3 tablespoon of honey and one tablespoon of lemon juice, then reduced it, taking about 5 minutes. I poured it over the chicken and baked it in the oven  @375, making the sauce into a wonder dark spicy sweet sauce, which I drizzled over the chicken  before serving. Served with rice with apples and walnuts and roasted brussel sprouts.

Super quick and easy! Not as lemon-flavored as some other lemon chicken recipes, but the onion and garlic powder give it great flavor.

This recipe was SO easy and flavorful.  I used chicken breast tenders, which are smaller, and baked 15 minutes on one side, and only 10 on the other.  Used salted lemon pepper, and applied the seasonings generously.  It was delicious!

Worth doing again!  I'll pre-brown it next time.  I was too liberal with the spices and it was too peppery for my kids.  Easy, quick, went well with white rice & steamed broccoli.

This made a really simple and nice tasting rub.  I'll try some lemon juice and minced garlic with it next time to add even more flavor, possibly as a marinade.

I made this last night for dinner when I was in a rush. Although I had to cook the chicken longer than the recipe said it was still good. It was alot faster than maranating the chicken overnight and dint come out dry in the least bit. Thanks for this quick recipe!

I made this for my dad and my boyfiend, I'm trying to prove to my boyfriend that I can cook, or at least follow a recipe. They both loved it. I actually liked it too, I wasn't too sure about the lemon pepper, cause I'd never tried it before, but it was great!

Delicious, easy, healthy.

I didn't cut breasts in half, and it still turned out fine.

Highly recommended.

How could such a simple recipe me so delish?  I guess it's the low baking time and mixture of spices.  Super yummy.  I served with brown rice and broccoli.

Easy and good, though I don't think 1 teaspoon would be nearly enough for that much chicken! In addition to what the recipe calls for, we used extra lemon pepper, some freshly grated pepper, and baked the chicken with a fresh slice of lemon on top. I'm on a diet and dishes like this make it seem effortless. Thanks Gina.

Simple and tasty, although I used way more seasoning, especially lemon pepper, since I like it so much.

Very easy and very fast but not very good. I thought that this was just allright but I am not the biggest fan of lemon pepper chicken, I think.

This recipe is very tasty. The chicken is nicely seasoned and stays very moist. I'll definitely be making this again!

We really weren't very impressed with the flavor on this one.  It didn't help that my husband doesn't care for lemon pepper much.  I probably won't be using this again - it needed a little something.

We just tryed this recipe and the chicken was good. It was a bit dry for me and my family.
I think next time i will cut it up into strips and then put in on top of pasta and a white sauce.

I didn't really follow the exact measurements because I prefer a ton of lemon and pepper. I also used fresh chopped onions instead, which added great flavour and some tasty roasted onion on the side.
From a cooking novice, this is super easy and tasty!

I used drumsticks and didn't even measure the seasonings, I just sprinkled each one on.  So yummy and so easy.  There's no added extra fat so it's pretty healthy too.  I always take the skins off my chicken as well.

I used 2 -3 freshly squeezed lemon juice poured into the baking dish with the chicken while it was baking. Came out GREAT and simple to make. Used the leftovers to make chicken burritos

This was a light and kinda healthy option for a dinner 1 night.  It was good, but seemed a little bland and seems like it needs a little something to help it out.  It's a nice and easy option though!

It was good for a weekday meal! Quick and easy! Served with white rice and a side of broccoli. Since previous reviewers stating it was kinda bland, I added more ingredients and cooked it on a pan with butter. I used lemon pepper, onion and garlic powder but added salt, juice of half of lemon AND rosemary! The rosemary is was brought it together! I would say next time I'm going to add some broth or maybe sear it and then put it in the over.. it wasn't dry but some juice or sauce would have make it a lot better! I'm saving this one!

Put more of the seasoning that was said still used lemon pepper, onion powder, garlic powder, minced garlic and lemon juice. Also (as seasoned) used virgin olive oil and butter in pan to cook chicken 7 min per side once done placed in baking pan that I filled with lemon juiced.. Placed in oven for 35 min. Came out amazing

Made this recipe for my girlfriend and her mom last night. I made it with leg quarters instead of breasts and cooked it an extra ten minutes. Turned out to be very good but I'm using more of the seasoning next time. Definitely making this again!

Such a simple recipe with a great end result!  Based on such few ingredients, this turned out to be very good.  Along with the lemon pepper, I added a dried three onion blend (instead of onion powder which I didn't have) and squeezed fresh lemon juice over each piece at the end, yummy!

If you're looking for a lowfat baked chicken dish, as I was when I came upon this, this is the recipe for you! The lemon pepper gave it just enough flavor to not have to add salt which is always good to skip if you're eating healthy! Thanks for the recipe GINA!

I usually try to follow recipes exactly the first time around before tweaking it, but since other reviews said this was a little bland, I thought it would be more flavorful to brown it first in some butter and lemon juice.  I also used the proportions of spices that the recipe called for but a more generous amount.  Hubby and I both loved it -- quick and easy, with a nice light flavor.  Low fat too!

If your on a diet or looking for something simple and light this is a recipe for you! I found it to be extremely easy but if you don't pair it with something flavorful, your dish will be pretty bland. I think next time I will cook the chicken as directed and chop it up to put on a salad.

This is the simplest of all chicken recipes! It can easily be scaled down to serve 2 people. I often make this when I haven't been to the grocery store because I have everything on hand already. You can stick the chicken in the oven or grill it outside.

This is good for busy nights and quick prep. I love that I don't have to dirty extra dishes just to make the chicken. Like others, I also used more seasoning than called for. Super healthy too.  :)

Nothing extraordinary, but tasty enough to make again.

I thought this was really good. I did brown the chicken in a small amount of olive oil before baking. I then poured a little lemon juice over it and then baked. I also left off the onion powder because I couldn't find it. I don't know why some others thought it was bland. I thought it had just the right amount of flavor....of course, I like my meat to taste like meat. What would be the point otherwise?

This recipe was a big hit when I served it to our guests last night. I only gave it four stars because I think following Allie's suggestions about browning the chicken in wine made a really big difference. Will definitely make again- thanks for sharing!

Excellent. I cut chicken into large chunks, sprinkled with lemon pepper, garlic and seasoning salt. Added some olive oil and cooked @350 for about 30 minutes (covered). I also added some chunks of onion and summer squash.

Okay.  I didn"t really measure the dry spices,  I just sprinkled at will.  I might try adding some thyme next time.

I was surprised at the results of this chicken dish.  I thought the chicken would be dry, due to baking without any liquid, but it turned out really juicy and tasty.  This recipe is soooo very simple, there's no reason not to try it!

I wasnt too impressed with the recipe. Was a bit too bland for me. It does take more time to cook then what it calls for.

I was in need of a fast chicken recipe to cook for my boyfriend.  I came across this recipe on the search engine of this site.  I followed the instructions that "Queenie" had left on her review but added some chopped mushrooms as well & served it up with yummy mashed potatoes!  My boyfriend raved the dish!  Thank you so much for the recipe!

This recipe was real easy to make and is pretty good but needs sauce.  I concocted a little cream, lemon, white wine and butter sauce that complimented it very nicely.  Everyone loved it.

Absolutely nothing wrong with this dish, however, I wasn't, nor expected to be wowed by it. It was something I made for myself as my lunch and sliced the chicken over some spring salad greens.
