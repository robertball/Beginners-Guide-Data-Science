I was a little skeptical about this recipe, but was looking for a quick pie crust.  It was easy and very tender and flaky. If you are using deep dish pie plates, you won't get two crusts out of it.

Easy?  Not really - this was really soft, fragile dough to work with, even after chilling.   It tasted fine - it just wasn't any easier than regular pie crust - in fact it was harder to work with.  A novel idea though. It just goes to show you there is more than one method for making pie crust.   Thanks.

Works for me! I like the simplicity and the results. Each cook has their own crust recipe, and this has become mine!
