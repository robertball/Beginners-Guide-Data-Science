I have made these enchiladas for years and everyone loves them.  A couple things I do differently....I always shred my chicken instead of cubing it - I really think it improves the dish and I spoon some of the soup mixture on top of the chicken inside of the tortillas then spread the rest of the soup mix on top.  Awesome meal with some mexican rice and a simple salad.

You will love this.  I use a little cream cheese in the sour cream mixture to make an even richer taste.  I also use a extra chicken breast and make HUGE enchiladas.  When you do this, it's hard to get them out of the pan without them falling apart, but by the time they make it out of the oven, no one cares.  Try it.  You'll like it!

I loved this recipe!  I made it last night for my husband and picky 8 year old and they ate it all! I lowered the fat and calories by using 97% fat free tortillas, weight watchers shredded cheese, and fat free sour cream.  They didn't know the difference and it was yummy!

This is an awesome recipe. I did make a few changes. I sauted the chicken, onions, and added garlic salt and fresh mushrooms. I took the advice of the other review on here and made them bigger and I used more cheese. It turned out great and my man loved it!

I like this recipe however I have done things a little different.  I stir in the soup mix with the chicken, add a block of cream cheese, can of sweet corn, can of black beans and a can of rotel (spicey). I put the cheese on top.

This is great recipe.  I love the sauce.  I did stuff them bigger and used more cheese.  Next time, I want to add more spices and maybe peppers with the chicken.  Will make again though!

This is an excellent recipe. I did change it up by using 3 chicken breasts, 3/4 8oz block of cream cheese, 8-10 mild jalepenos chopped (adding them to the sour cream mixture) and spooning it on the chicken before rolling the enchiladas up giving it a superb flavor.

The easiest and best recipe for enchiladas! The onions were a little crispy and I didn't like it at first. After the second helping, I decided I loved the texture of the onions. I will cook this again without ANY deviations from the original recipe. Awesome!

This was tasty. A solid recipe to feed a large crowd. I made mine into a casserole. I browned the onion, added garlic powder then shredded chicken to the skillet. I then added the soups and sour cream. I put a light layer of the mixture on the bottom of the baking dish. Next I layered the tortillas, chicken mixture again, cheese, and repeated, ending with the layer of cheese on top. I can see why reviewers said more chicken. I will probably cook up one more chicken breast next time.

Quite tasty.  Followed recipe-used rotisserie chicken which worked well.  Added some hot sauce to the sour cream mixture as well as some jarred jalapenos.  Even with the above alteration had mild spice.  Will make again but would use jalapenos instead of the green chilies to add more spice.

This was great. I followed some of the suggestions, cooked the onions with the chicken to soften it, then added cream cheese for a little smoother flavor.

I've been making this for years and the only thing missing is I add cilantro to the soup mx. Probably about a handful. It completly makes the meal. I also shred my chicken instead of cubing it.

I have been making this recipe for about 15 years.  My whole family loves it. My daughter has carried it over to her new family and they all love it.  The only difference in mine, is that I add enchilada sauce to the chicken and I don't put the cheese inside.  My husband wants extra sauce, so I double the sour cream and soup mixture.It's great!

4.5 on the very first night that I made them, but a definite 5 on the next day!!  Just something about sitting over night that made them explode with flavor the next day.  Good idea about doubling the sauce.  DH was absolutely raving about these the next day.  I did saute the chicken with fajita seasoning.  thank you for sharing.

Great base recipe! It tastes great "as is", but as you can see from other reviews, it's easy to spice up with jalepenos, salsa, add rice or beans to, shred chicken instead of dice - whatever suits you. Nicely done lara!

I used the shredded Mexican Blend Cheese instead of Cheddar and I also mixed green chile sauce in with the soup instead of chopped green chiles.
I served it up with Spanish Rice and made my own Cinnamon/Sugar tortilla chips.
Everyone raved about the dish and said we need to make this more often.  Very easy to make, kudos for the recipe!

This was SO yummy! I had about 2 1/2 lbs of chicken breast that I used for this. It made 13 enchiladas using 8" flour tortillas. I doubled the sauce and also added about 6oz of cream cheese and instead of the 3oz can of green chiles I added a whole can of Rotel. I laid the onions down on the tortilla, then some shredded chicken, then the sauce, and finally some cheese. These were so delicious, will defnitely be making these a lot more!

Simple to prepare a great weeknight meal. A few changes... I boiled and shredded my chicken breasts instead of cutting into cubes.  I used corn tortillas (warmed in oil in a frying pan) instead of flour. I also doubled the sauce mixture took half and mixed with shredded chicken and spooned into tortilla with onions and cheese then after all were filled I poured remaining sauce mixture over tortillas and sprinkled cheese on top. Very delicious everyone loved them!!!

So simple, quick, and delicious. I make these when I am short on time and it takes me about 35 minutes to have these ready to serve. I wait until the last 5 minutes of baking to top with the remaining cheese, otherwise it gets burnt in my experience. I also add a few jalapenos to each enchilada, but I like things spicy.

I thought the flavor was really good, but I didn't have enough sauce to cover 12 enchiladas.  Thankfully I had a small (10 oz) can of green enchilada sauce in the cupboard that I threw in.  Maybe I just prefer my enchiladas saucier than others.  Either way, I will definitely make this again!

Definitely a recipe to put in with the family favorites.  I was surprised how amazing the sauce turned out.  The thought of cream of chicken soup just didn't appeal to me but with the green chili's and sour cream it tasted like I really slaved to make the sauce.  The only thing I did differently was added enchilada sauce with the chicken, cheese and onions.  It really gave it a great kick and besides, how can it be enchiladas without enchilada sauce : )

Yum! I left out the chicken and used organic condensed cream of mushroom soup to make it vegetarian. I sauteed the onion in the saucepan until soft before adding the soup and green chilies. I used corn tortillas instead and layered the tortillas, sauce, and cheese instead of rolling them. Thanks for the great and very easy recipe!

So I made this last night and YUM!!!! Never, EVER liked enchiladas made like this but I LOVED this version! I used "fajita seasoning" when I cooked the chicken; I cooked some onions with it, added pepper jack for a 'kick', topped it with jarred jalapenos and HOLY MOLY - to die for! Thanks for posting and THANKS for making me love enchiladas this way!!!

I made the filling in the crockpot and mixed in the sour cream at the end.  I then assembled the enchiladas and did rest of recipe as is.  Perfection!!  I used leftover filling as a dip:)

We sauteed the chicken and onions together with one each -- jalapeno and serrano -- peppers and some taco seasoning and a little water and let water cook down. They are very good!

I loved these enchiladas!! The only things that I did differently, was that I added twice as many chiles to the soup mixture, and I also spooned some of the mix into the tortillas. Serve it with some hot sauce, and it was perfectamente!!!

Pretty good, but a little bland. They'll need some doctoring next time. Will definitely make again, just use this recipe as a base.

This was very easy but also very bland.  It needs some serious kick added to it.  Maybe salsa and cumin and garlic....  Just kind of boring as is.

Very yummy!  Like others suggested, we put some sauce in the wrap, and added cream cheese to the sauce.  We didn't have green chilies, so we used jalepenos, and was still great!

The ingredient proportions are way off.  How can you fill 12 10-inch tortillas with two cubed chicken breasts?  I used four chicken breasts and I still only filled 6 tortillas (the last one pretty skimpy).  The sauce had a good flavor, but I would recommend putting some on the bottom of the casserole dish before placing the filled tortillas.  The bottoms stayed dry because the sauce was just poured over the top.  Onions did stay crunchy, but I actually liked that.  Wasn't keen on the texture of the chicken, which I cut into very small pieces after cooking.  I would make again, but would add rice, vegetables, beans.  I'd probably just skip the chicken and make them vegetarian altogether.

Quick and easy! I added mexican rice to the filling to make it more hearty. Sprinkled sliced black olives on the top before I baked. For next time I'll make double of the sauce, good amount as already but a little more would be nice. I also like some heat, and this recipe didn't have much, so and chop up some jalepenos and throw it into the sauce! A keeper!

I cooked the chicken with some salt and onion powder to flavor it up a bit.  I also didn't put the green chiles in since I thought it might be too spicy for my 18 month old son.  So I added about 1/2 cup of taco sauce to the sauce mixture.  I also doubled the sour cream to make more sauce.  It turned out great!!  We all loved it and will definitely be making it again.

This was a good recipe. I 'cheated' and used canned chicken instead of cooking my own in order to save time. However, it was rather bland that way. When I make it next time I will saute chicken breasts in garlic, onion, butter and olive oil and add some chili pepper. I would also put some of the sour cream mixture inside the enchiladas, maybe just a spoonful in each. I added tomatoes and sliced black olives to the top of the casserole and served with shredded lettuce on top. My husband really liked it and said, "you can make this again."

YUMMY- a huge hit with my family! The only thing I "changed" was, like another reviewer advised, I added some of the cream sauce inside the tortillas in addition to spreading it on top of them. Also, I shredded the chicken a bit - this just makes it mix up easier I think.  Absolutely fabulous!

Very good and quick recipe.  I took the advice of one reviewer and shredded the meat instead of cubing it.  I also put a bit of the sauce inside the enchilada before rolling it up.  Will make again.

Very easy recipe to follow, I will definitely be making this again. 

As a side note: You can shred your chicken in a kitchen aid stand mixer on stir. I added the onions and a little pepper, once it cooled down I also added the cheddar cheese. It makes it so much easier to roll, I also boiled my chicken with a pinch of kosher salt instead of using the skillet.

This goes together fast.  I use the pre-cooked Perdue roasted, sliced chicken (that is sold with the lunchmeat/prepared foods).  I chop it up a little more after taking it from the package.  Sometimes if I am feeling lazy, I don't even add the chopped onion before rolling the cheese and chicken up in a tortilla.  (I use Mama Lupes low carb tortillas.  The best!)  The first time I made it, it was a little dry, so after that, I doubled all the sauce ingredients.  I put a thin layer on the bottom of the pan before placing the rolled enchiladas in the pan.  Double sauce is a little bit too much, but you can't really buy 1/2 cans of soup to keep the proportions correct.  The sauce is really yummy, just a little spicy from the green chiles.  This travels pretty well, too, since it is in a casserole dish.

These were a delicious and quick dinner!  Even the kids ate them.  The only thing I changed was I boiled the chicken breasts, then cubed/shredded and mixed with sauted onions and the cheese.  Will definately make these again!  Very flavorful.

After I made this recipe, it didn't look like it was going to taste all that great, but then looks can be deceiving.  There was not much left and one of the guests took the leftover home.

I have been making something similar to these for years. I combin all ingredients in a large bowl and then spoon into flour tortillas, roll em up, and bake. They come out of the oven crunchy and soooooo delicious. I serve them with queso, salsa, quac, etc. Try it!

These were simple to make and delicious.  My husband (who is hard to please) agreed.  I also shredded the chicken and addsed some seasoning when cooking the chicken.  Also, I did as others suggested and put the sauce on the bottome of the pan and inside of the shells as well as on top of the the shells. This is a must make!

Delicious! I loved the alternative to the traditional red enchilada and the creamy spice this recipe offers. I followed the suggestions of other reviewers and added some of the sauce to the inside of each enchilada as well as on top  - YUM! I added a bit of hot sauce for kick. Awesome!

I 'm a  Nanny, so making delicious dinners that can please 3 children (ages 3, 7, 14) does prove difficult. But let me tell you,I end up having to double the recipes as it quickly disappears enchilada night. I do spend a bit  more time focusing on the chicken as I do with every recipe, seeing as bland chicken is a pet peeve.  I cube the chicken and cook with onion, diced tomatoes and green chilies, in about an inch water with bouillon and spices. I put the same spices in with the sour cream mixture, though I make my own cream of chicken soup with broth and roux. I also put tomatoes in with the sour cream as well. After the chicken is cooked I shred and stuff! Wonderful recipe I make at home and at work. Give it a try!

Very good recipe. I used shredded chicken that I cooked in some salsa, chili powder, cumin, and garlic. The sauce is awesome and will definately be making this again.

Very good. I had some friends over the other night and I made this. Was a bit nervous having never used the recipe before but it was a huge hit! The kids LOVED it. I think next time I will add 1 more can of soup and more sour cream. We like it a little creamier.

This was the best Sour Cream Chicken Enchiladas I have found! Small changes. 8 chicken tenders, seasoned with salt, pepper, onion salt and garlic powder. Shredded after cooking. Returned to pan with a can of rotel and warmed through. I didn't put the cheese inside. The rest was just the same. Soooo Yummy!

Pretty good, simple and easy. I would suggest sauteing the onions first though. Plus, I added salsa and Tobasco on top. Yum!

Okay...... so I'm 43 and believe it or not cooking has never been my gig.  But I'm trying to be better at it now and this was my first attempt at using a recipe from Allrecipes.com. My husband and I LOVED these enchiladas!  I purchased a rotisserie chicken and used it for shredded chicken instead of cubed.  It was a huge hit in this household!!

The only things I did differently was add black beans inside the tortillas, used half the amount of cheese as called for, and used Colby Jack cheese instead of cheddar. I think not using Cheddar was my downfall. It was too bland. I've made this many times as written and normally it's yummy.

flavor is great but I add some cumin, salt, pepper, and chili powder to the chicken while cooking it, I also shred the chicken instead of cubing. it's also a good idea idea to put some sauce down in the dish before the enchiladas to prevent them from sticking

Such a great dish! I doubled the sauce but that's just because, we like our enchiladas saucy. When we want a little spice, we add some chopped jalapenos to the sauce. But, even without these changes the recipe is great.

The first time I made it almost exactly as the recipe says and they were really good.  I roasted chicken breast halves and shredded it instead of cubing.

The second time, I doubled the sauce, added a can of rotel, soup can full of milk, and used pepper jack and colby jack cheeses.

Both are great and a nice variation.

This was a great change from using a green chili sauce and my husband loved it. I however, did make some adjustments; the sauce was too thick for me so I thinned it out to a medium consistency by adding some of the seasoned water I poached my chicken in ( I did not cube my chicken or cook it in a skillet ). I poached my chicken breast        in water with onions, cumin, onion powder, garlic salt, oregano and black pepper; then I shredded it, topped off the dish with olives and green onions. I will definitely make this again, it's a twist on enchilada suizas to me. I also used yellow corn tortillas, otherwise it's a burrito not an enchilada.

This is a great recipe! I made it kid-friendly and left out the onions. I also used corn tortillas instead of flour. The sauce is fantastic and such an easy delicious idea!!

I love these enchiladas! They are so easy and fast when I need to get dinner on the table on a week night. I add fajita seasoning to the chicken while sauteing but thats the only thing different I do, and its so great!

I love this recipe, my picky husband and daughter love it too! I slowly boil my chicken and season the water/broth with garlic. I also saute my onions with a little minced garlic in a little olive oil until they are tender. I followed Patti's suggestion and put a little of the sauce on the chicken before rolling the tortilla. I don't make quite as many because I put more chicken in the enchilada. I would suggest this recipe to anyone that wants a different way to fix chicken every once and a while.

Made this for friends, doubling it, who love mexican food. I don't, so I didn't eat it. The couple, and their teenage son , LOVED it. Their teenage daughter and mine, didn't. The lady, RAVED about it, and wants the recipe for herself. I used a 48 oz. can of boned chicken with broth, since I doubled it, and put it in the food processor, after draining. Bought the chicken at GFS Marketplace. Can't wait to make for my Hubby.

Perfect family meal. Sauce was great especially if you dig sour cream. I followed the advise of some of the reviewers and shredded the chicken. We had this with a side of mexican style rice. Thanks for the recipe.

Very easy and delicious! Unless you have two gigantic chicken breasts, two breasts will not be enough. I used four average size breasts. I used low fat sour cream and whole wheat tortillas and the recipe was still delicious. I loved the crunch of the raw onions in the sauce.

This was a delicious and quick recipe that I will definitely make again!  I was looking for a recipe using chicken breasts and sour cream, and found I had everything to make this - except the green chiles.  I substituted about half cup of salsa and a couple teaspoons of green hot sauce when I made the sauce, which made it tasty but not actually spicy.  It does make for a slightly pink topping, but that disappears after it cooks.  Was also a great way to use up leftover flour tortillas that had gotten a bit hard around the edges.  Soaking and cooking in the sauce softened them right up.  Delicious!

This dish was great....easy to make and very tasty. I was worried about baking them seem side down but they stayed rolled when I served them. Next time I'd make more sauce and add more cheese to the top but thats just personal preference. The changes I did make this time were using smaller tortillas and since I didn't have a whole onion on hand I just used instant chopped onions, which were cooked with the chicken...and the chicken was seasoned with pepper, seasoned salt, cayenne, garlic powder and crushed red pepper.

This is a great recipe. I use corn tortillas instead. I put the soup, sour cream and chilies in a skillet and dip the tortillas in the sauce to make them more pliable. I use monterey pepper jack cheese. My family requests this dish.

Thought this was really tasty.  I would give it a 4.5 if I could.  I cooked the onion in a tablespoon of butter then added the shredded chicken, I also added some of the sauce mix to the chicken.  I will make it again, maybe next time I will add something to spice it up a bit more.  Overall a really good dish worth making.

This recipe was a hit!!!  I doubled the sour cream and chix soup like many others, topped with black olives and after cooking the chicken, i added a packet of taco seasoning.  It really worked!  We will make many more times.

These were really, really good.  I used leftover fried chicken and left out the sour cream (b/c I realized at the last second that I was out).  Will make again.  Hubby LOVED them!

Really good... but the sauce needed a little "kick". I like that I didn't feel the need to eat these with sour cream, as they were saucy enough.   I've never used flour tortillas for enchiladas before, and I have to say they were pretty good. Never take the place of corn, in my opinion, but really chewy and soft and good!   Instead of sauteing chicken breast, I used a rotisserie chicken because I was in a hurry and it was (seriously) cheaper than skinless/boneless breasts. I sauted mushrooms and oinions together and added the chiken just to really heat through.   Very tasty!

this is the most delicious dish I have ever made!  Followed a couple of tips and cooked the onions with the chicken, and I add green or red peppers, whatever I have on hand.  This dish makes great leftovers too!  I can't get enough!!!

These were delicious! We LOVED the sauce on top! Only used about 1/6 of the onion it called for. Also I semi-shredded my chicken cubes after I cooked them.

These were great! By the time the night was over and my husband and kids had gone back for leftovers they were all gone.  I made the following changes: I added 1/2 c. cream cheese to the sauce mixture.  I used 1/2 of the sauce and mixed it with the chicken, onion, and cheese for the enchilada filling.  I then added 1 can of mild red enchilada sauce to the remaining 1/2 of the sauce mixture to pour on top.  They were delicious!

Followed this as is but next time I will add some of the sauce to the inside of the enchilada.  These were so good I made more the next day and froze them.  Everyone loved them!!!

This was fabulous but I changed it up a bit. I sauteed onions and garlic in butter then added that and my chicken to the creamy mixture. Along with some chili and garlic powder. I used that as my filling then made some enchilada sauce to pour over them. It was soooooo good!

Very good, my 7 year old ate lots.  My picky husband cleaned his plate, but didn't do any leftovers.  I wish I knew how to keep the flour tortillas from getting "soggy".

This was delicious!! My husband and 6 year old loved this.  I had left over pot roast, so I used it in replace of the chicken and it was YUMMY!  I sauteed the oninions in butter and used extra cheese. Huge hit.

Really yummy and super easy.  I will not be so skimp on the sauce next time, though.  I sauteed some of the onions with the chicken and added them inside with the fresh ones.  I froze it and had it a couple weeks later -- exactly what I was looking for as a quick meal!
