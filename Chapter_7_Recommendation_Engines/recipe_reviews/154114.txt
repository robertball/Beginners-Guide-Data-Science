Fantastic! I added about tsp of cumin, but made no other changes. Made a great lunch served on a whole wheat pita. Thanks for the recipe.

I used a substitute for fava beans, lima beans.  Basically, this is a hummus recipe, and I love hummus!  This is very tasty!

great, simple weeknight quickie. I added cumin and coriander. Also, I was out of lemon juice so I used white wine vinegar, tasted great!

This is great - I didn't have a lemon and made it with lime juice instead, but it was still good.  Just wish I'd had some parsley on hand.

Very good recipe. I used a pestle after it was done cooking and smashed the beans up a bit not too much though and added a bit of Olive oil on top of each serving.

Great recipe but made a few changes.  I substituted garbanzos and a lime because it's what I had available.  I blended about half the bean mixture to give it a creamier texture like the picture.  I thought it tasted a little bland so added a tsp of paprika and 2 tbs of chili powder.  It was great loaded into a flour tortilla to serve as a wrap.  Next time I think I would serve this with tomato and cucumber slices along with some feta crumbles for a complete meal.  Also might add a pinch of cayenne for a kick.
