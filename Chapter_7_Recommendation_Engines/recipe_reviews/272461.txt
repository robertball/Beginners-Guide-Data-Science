It takes a bit more time than Chef John implies (say, 20 minutes) but the results are, as advertised, excellent.  The consistency and flavor are perfect (using the cheese combination recommended) and when showered with the toasted Panko bread crums, which do NOT require much effort, the whole family enjoyed.  This will be a regular for nights when I don't have much time to cook.

I prepared it with 2% milk and a light cheddar. Was unsure but the magic still worked. Much tastier than box mixes yet totally easy. Will definitely make again. Thank you Chef John!

This is a really good one-pot mac and cheese. I made it three times, with and without the panko topping. The first two times I made it, my sauce broke--despite the fact that I turned off the heat when adding the cheese. The first batch,  I let sit for 3 minutes, covered. The second time, I left the lid off the saucepan for 3 minutes and it still broke. Batch #3? Victory! I pulled the pan from the heat, stirred in the cheese, transferred the batch to a serving dish and *then* let it sit, covered. I used mini shells as the pasta and the cook time was a bit longer, 10 - 11 minutes, but the amount of liquid was still fine. Oh, and I've made it using nonfat and 2% milks and all extra-sharp cheddar.

I’ve made this several times with great success. I think it’s some of the easiest and best mac & cheese when it comes to homemade. It’s very simple and easy to make and everybody enjoys it.

I made two batches.   one with whole fat milk, and one with 2% milk ( am counting my calories and fat intake, hubby isn't).
Honestly, I couldn't taste the difference between the two..
 We both loved it.
My  advice  to the person who stated that the noodles were too firm,  cook them a bit longer, until you are happy with the texture.

Great recipe and comes out perfect. However, It’s not one pot as per your recipe so that is misleading. Does not change it take away from the fact this is a solid recipe I will put in my rotation.

It's great! had looked for a recipe like this before; so glad it was posted. I sorta took my eyes away and the milk boiled over (oops), but still came out perfect:)

it's like magic how the sauce thickens. My only issue with this recipe is the salt. I'm not a big salt fan, so my review might not help many, but cheese has plenty of salt already. When I make this again, I'll leave out the salt. ps, my toddler loved it.

It was okay, but a bit too moist for my taste.

Good quick recipe. The salt was overbearing however. I’ll cut that by 2/3 next time. Also, definitely let the cheese mix cook for the full amount of time, if not a little longer to blend it really well.

The flavor is awesome, but the noodles need more liquid to cook in. I would double the amount of milk as the noodles were too firm.

I had been craving Mac and cheese but didn’t want a big mess of pots to wash. One pot Mac and cheese is genius! Watch the salt tho. Mine was a little salty due to not having any unsalted butter. Also used some velveeta, which is probably a little saltier.

I used Cracker Barrel Sharp White Cheddar cheese and the sauce never came together.  I will try a different cheese the next time because the flavor was great, perhaps it just wasn’t a very good melting cheese.  But who doesn’t love a big clump of cheese, so it was eaten!!
