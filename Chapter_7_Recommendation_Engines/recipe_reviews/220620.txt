I made this salad for an extended family Father's Day dinner and it was liked by people of all ages.  The number of compliments was impressive.  The only change I made to the recipe was to roast the red onion (add it to the roasting mix at the same time as the asparagus), add a tablespoon of balsamic vinegar to the mixture, and roast the vegetables (green beans, red onion, and asparagus) for at least 30 minutes.  With the roasting time in the original recipe, the veggies were too hard for easy eating.

Great flavor with the parsley.  Made a few changes which gave this 5 stars- I used only green beans and doubled them as I had a ton of excess from our garden. We also roasted the onion and 3 cloves garlic with the green beans and added a little balsamic vinegar as well. Already have made twice!

Very good and pretty to serve.  I used the frozen green beans from Costo instead of fresh.  Just watch the texture of beans and asparagus until it is to your liking.  Will make again.

Guests loved it.
Will make it again.

I normally do not stray from the original recipe when I make something the first time but today I did.  I followed other reviewers advice about roasting the tomatoes and onions with the asparagus but instead of using olive oil to roast, I tossed all veggies with Italian dressing.  Once it was out of the oven, I cooled, put it in a bowl and let it chill overnight then added 4 oz of crumbled feta cheese in the morning before I portioned some to take to work for lunch.  Holy moly I could eat this EVERY DAY!  I had 5 lb of asparagus in the fridge to use and I will probably make this again for next week's lunches!

I have made this three times for potluck dinners. There is never any left over! I have tweaked a little each time. I also roast the onion, but only for the last 10 minutes. Also, I add about 2 tablespoons of balsamic vinegar when I toss it all together. A really nice change from typical tossed salad and it doesn't get soggy while waiting to serve.

I decided to make this dish on Easter. Delicious! This was a different variety of veggies that I hadn't introduced to guests before and received lots of compliments.  I would also recommend sliced almonds sprinked on top for a nice crunchy texture.

First of all, I rely on reviews for shopping and recipes. It is no help if someone does not follow the original recipe and rates it on their changes. And as for crisp vegetables, this  one clearly says for roasting the asparagus ten minutes"or until tender". Ten minutes is a guideline.  This is a good basic recipe and certainly will make it again.  Already saved in my AnyList file.

This was delicious. I steamed the vegetables rather than roasting them in order to avoid the oil. Recommended!

Wonderfully simple to make and great recipe.   It doesn't have a lot of flavors in it, but it doesn't need it.   I made just as written, except I grilled instead of using the oven.   I will definitely make this again.   Thank you Sarah for a nice recipe.

Super yummy and super healthy. I did not use olive oil or onions because I did not have them on hand. Next time I may try steaming the veggies to make it a bit healthier (? I think it's healthier that way). Anyway, this tasted great and was a fun and easy recipe to make.

Used this for Easter. It was a hit.  We added all the vegetables - tomatoes and onions - at the same time as the asparagus.  It was great!!

I did change this slightly as not a fan of raw onions.  I added all the vegis to the baking sheet. They all roasted well and were a delicious way to use up some of the fresh summer vegis in the fridge.

I took a couple of suggestions from other reviewers and made the following alterations: Tossed the veggies with balsamic vinegar in addition to the oil (I used olive oil), and roasted the tomatoes and onion along with the asparagus. Turned out so amazing! I served it warm, but I think if you were planning to serve this dish cold, the fresh tomatoes and onion would work well. I think the addition of feta cheese, as one reviewer suggested, would also work well with a chilled version. I will absolutely make this again!

Super Salad!  I got lots of compliments and requests for the recipe.  One change I made is that 
I tossed a TBS of Balsamic  vinegar just before serving.

Made this exactly as described without extra oil and the warm vs cold was a bit off putting. No one else liked it, and the after taste from it lasted a long time. It wasn't great. I stuffed it in the freezer and cranked the thermostat to get the air flowing. After some time to chill it became better, but still had the after taste that I personally didn't enjoy, but during the eat I did enjoy the chilled version. 
Tried it again the next day... but added Feta to it. The Feta helped so much to kill the taste of the oil. 
Finally I added half an Italian dressing packet to the remainder. Add Feta when plated. Now I love this combination. everything has a bit of a crunch, and the after flavor is nice as well.

Great combination, just needs an extra kick in my book.

Nice and simple!

Follow the time in the recipe if you want a restaurant/chef-quality  firmness to your veggies.  My veggies had the perfect crunch, roasted char and color.   Add time if you prefer a softer, "home-style" wellness.

I added balsamic like others suggested...    ...also consider feta cheese to contrast against the red onion!

Simple and delish! I had carrots that were begging not to be left out of the pan so I chopped several and roasted them too. Loved the light touch of balsamic and salt as they really brought the flavors of the veggies out. Will definitely roast again and share widely. Many thanks and cheers!

This was so yummy, and very easy to prepare and make.  I added the fresh lemon juice of 1/4 lemon wedge and crispy fried bacon bits (about 1/4 cup). I didn't add salt because the bacon was already salty. YUM!

I had planned  to add feta cheese, as another reviewer mentioned, but forgot to buy it, oy!  I think that would have made the difference.  As such, this was bland, even though I added a bit of vinegar.  Just not a great marriage of veggies.  We added some parmesan, which helped but didn't redeem this.

So good I made it twice in the same week!  I roasted the onions and tomatoes along with the asparagus.

Delicious!  We also added toasted slivered almonds.  Definitely worth making again with the almonds!

This was great! My hubby can take or leave asparagus, but even he thought this was a hit. I had to use frozen asparagus spears but it didn't seem to hurt. It it was really easy to make too. We will definitely make this again.
