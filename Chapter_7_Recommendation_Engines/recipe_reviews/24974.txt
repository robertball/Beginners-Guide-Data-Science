Moist and fluffy!  Works well with fresh figs= 1lb. Added lemon zest for extra aroma. Nonfat yogurt can be substituted for butter milk.

I really liked this cake. I made it once with just white sugar. Then I made it a second time and used half white and half brown. Excellent both ways! The buttermilk really makes the difference too. I used pecans instead of walnuts too. Just as good.

delicious! I made a few modifications... mainly due to what I had on hand. I used yogurt instead of buttermilk and hazelnuts instead of walnuts. next time I will use a little more spices, not quite spiced enough for my taste, but still quite lovely. I also baked the batter in a mini-muffin pan (15 minutes) which makes them easy, handy snacks.

I usually don't bother writing reviews, but this recipe is amazing. I substituted the buttermilk with my homemade yogurt and it turned out great. It is now my absolutely favorite recipe.

I made this with fresh figs from my tree. 1lb 1 oz. and dident add any extra water. I dident have any buttermilk so sub'ed regular milk with a little bit of vinager. This cake was so incredibly moist it was barly a cake anymore. That being said everyone LOVED it. I brought half pan to my trainer and he ate the whole thing without sharing. 
Its not real pretty to look at. I supose you could add some purple food coloring. I am thinking about making some marscapone or goat cheese whip cream and reduced lemon drizzle to fancy it up a bit. I will repost when I have tried it. Heaven knows I have enough figs!

So good!!!  I made it for four people and we ate most of it within  an hour.  I substituted pecans for walnuts and per the advice of another reviewer, put the figs into the food processor instead of chopping them.  I will be making this over and over!

This is an excellent base recipe for some great fruit cakes. I actually made a recipe of bananas foster and coarse mashed half of the cooked bananas into the spice cake batter. the remaining sauce and bananas were used to glaze and top the cake. the results were outstanding!! definitely a keeper!!

Yum! I cut the recipe in half,except for the spices, and added a little nutmeg. Put the figs in the processor and left out the nuts. Baked 20 min in an 8 inch glass baking dish. My daughter and I had some warm and it was great, but just as good for the next couple days. So moist:)........just made this again, still cutting in half and keeping the spice measurements whole. Found this stores very well for several days in Tupperware on the counter. The spices seem to get stronger as it sits and a taster and I both thought that it tasted like a cross between a fig Neuton and gingerbread. Was good warm with some Haagen Dazs, too.

Made this for a lunch time treat with tea for some freind and they all had seconds!  I added a mashed banana and some random dried apricots and prunes to clear from cupboards and it was delicious.  Without these the cake is fine and very moist.  I made this to get rid of some dried figs I have had for ages but now I think Ill have to by some more figs and make it again!

I checked on this at 45 minutes and it was done -- if I'd have left it longer it would have burnt. The figs did burn a bit where they were touching the pan. I only had 3/4 pound of figs and I found them to be a tad too sweet as it was [and I'm not usually one to complain about things being too sweet], but the cake itself was great. I guess I'm not a huge fan of figs, but I did like the muffin-y texture. My husband and mother both said it was good. I love spiced cake, so I doubled the cinnamon and cloves, and added 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg as well. ////////// UPDATE Feb 2015: I tried again, this time using an immersion blender on the figs, subbing light sour cream for the buttermilk, using two whole eggs instead of just whites, and increasing the spices and leaving out the nuts like before. I've a new oven so this one baked perfectly in 50 minutes. I've decided that I definitely don't like figs. But the cake was still good enough that I had several slices. My husband and mother liked it as much as before. I think I'll try this modified recipe with a different dried fruit like cherries.

Really good - several people asked me for the recipe or to make it again. I too put the figs in a food processor, and made the cake in a bundt pan, and then in mini bundt pans the second time around. make sure you grease and flour the pan really well, the cake will stick a bit otherwise.

I love figs -- fresh, dried, canned, preserved, you name it; when I purchased a package of dried figs recently, I found them drier than I like them.  So, I looked for fig recipes and found this one.  All the 5-star ratings caught my attention, and the reviews were very helpful.  I took the advice of several bakers and puréed the figs in my small food processor after stewing them and used plain Greek yogurt instead of buttermilk because that's what was in the fridge.  I typically cut back a little on the sugar and used 3/4 cup instead of 1.  Finally, I didn't add nuts because my husband prefers without.  Using a Bundt pan, I baked this cake for 50 minutes as directed.  It is really delicious!  My husband loves it, and I gave a piece to our 14-year-old granddaughter who was visiting.  I didn't tell her there were figs in the cake -- just said it's a spice cake (she's very fussy).  She ate it all up, every crumb!  I will be making this cake again, for sure.

This cake is delicious! I didn't have buttermilk so I squeezed the juice of one orange into the 1/2 cup of milk and it was amazing! The house smelled sooo good while it was baking too. Will definitely make this again! Thanks for sharing this recipe!

I followed the recipe as written except I used brown sugar. The flavor is good, fruity and not too  sweet. It came out denser  than I expected, more like a bread pudding. I paired it with a cream cheese icing.

great recipe.  I used my fresh frozen figs.  I cut them in half and cooked for a small amount of time with small amount of water.  I drained them and weighed out one pound.  I used only 1/4 of the remaining fig juice.  So nice to figure out how to use fresh frozen figs.  Niki

I had a pound of dried figs that no one was eating in the pantry and wanted to make something sweet with them. I'm glad I picked this recipe because it made a perfect 5-star cake as written: moist but not mushy, flavorful but not overpowering, and the density was right on.  The proportions are accurate, no need for adjustments.

I made this without any changes in recipe at all.  I did use a double walled sheetcake pan instead of tube pan, worried about scorching with fruit...It came out absolute perfect.  We all loved it.  Imagine would also be good with dates.....

This was great!  The only thing I changed was to use pecans instead of walnuts and I chopped my dates a bit finer (next time I'll chop as finely as possible and maybe even use the pureed version that other reviewers mentioned.)  I could see other fruits used in this but the figs are great.  I'll definitely make this again.

Absolutely luscious cake ... I just cut the sugar to 3/4 cup. That brought the flavors of figs and spice out beautifully. I substituted the buttermilk with homemade watery  yogurt .

I baked the recipe in two loaf 8" tins.

I bake all my goodies in an LG microwave convection oven on convection mode. 
Baked this one for 50 minutes at 170deg C.
Came out nice, brown and just right.

This cake is wonderful!!  It does cook under 60 minutes though as it only took 50 in my oven.  I am going to try and freeze it as I've read all the reviews but there is no mention of being able to freeze it.  I will give it a try!

Excellent, moist cake. After making it once I decided to make a second, but discovered I was out of figs, so I used dates instead and doubled the spices. I preferred it with dates and more spice, but the original recipe is also fabulous, especially if you're a big fig fan. Even better with ice cream.
