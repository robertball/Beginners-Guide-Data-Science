Wow -- this is so easy and delicious and pretty.  The perfect thing I was looking for to round out my Christmas-cookie routine.  I did add a few dark chocolate chips because I love the taste of chocolate-coconut-cherries, but the recipe would be just as delicious without the chocolate.

I too remember my mom making me these back in Wisconsin where I grew up.  I buzzed the crust ingredients in the food processor until the butter was mostly incorporated, like coarse sand.      I did use unsalted butter in the crust, but next time I'll use salted or add 1/4 tsp. salt, because I think it needed a little salt.      I also liked the way the recipe is printed out, nice clear directions.  And even though the bar comes out on the thin side, the filling just works together so well, that you get a little bite of sweet, without it being overwheling.
****Update: (12-07-10)   I just made these again, but this time I put them in a 9x9-inch pan and used salted butter in the crust.   I also ran out of the maraschino cherries and filled up the 1/2 cup measure with candied ginger,  and now I think I like them even  better!

I love, LOVE, this recipe!  It reminds me of the bars I ate as a kid.  What I like best about this recipe is that the bars bake up moist and chewy NOT wet. The original recipe called for an 8 x 8 OR 9 x 9 pan.  However, when baked in that size pan, the bars baked up too wet and gooey for my taste.  This recipe is PERFECT as is and requires no changes.  Thank you!!! I will make these often!

These are delicious! I have wanted to make these for some time and was sure I had everything. But...no walnuts. So, I used almonds and substituted almond extract for the vanilla. They end up being a little on the thin side but that works out great because there is just enough to not be overly sweet or rich. I will be making these again to add to the Holiday trays. Thanks for sharing!

My parents are normally pretty hard to please, and these were great! They didnt turn out as pretty as the picture, but that's okay, because they tasted amazing! I subbed chocolate chips for the nuts. Thanks!

I also make these cookies. They are everyone's favorite. My recipe is the same, however my cookies are alot thicker! I found that if you do not mix the egg and sugar mixture too long they will rise to about 1 1/2 inches to 2 inches. Then if I over beat the mixture they come out flat. I use candied cherries instead of marachino cherries.

I don't think I did anything in error, but we did not like these.  They sound delicious, but I won't make again.  Thanks for the recipe!

After Christmas Holidays I was looking for something to use up the extra maraschino cherries & coconut, and this was perfect. The bars are so simple to make; so light with an amazing flavor. The only thing is after 3 or 4 days they start to dry out. There is only 2 in our family so next time I will half the recipe if just making for us. Great recipe. Just wished I had found it before Christmas, but it will perfect for anytime.

I've been making these for over 40 years.  I got the recipe from a bag of Gold Medal flour.  40 some years ago, Gold Metal used to put little fanfold recipes in the bags of flour.  This on had spritz cookies, the cherry coconut bars, filled Christmas stocking cookies and many others.  The recipe called for an 8X8" baking dish.  The butter at room temperature and with your hands you combined the butter, flour and powdered suger to form a dough which you spread in the baking dish.  All the quantities and ingredients were identical to this recipe.  The end result was a thicker bar, somewhat difficult to get out of the pan and a little on the gooey side but delicious.  I tried this version and liked it much better.  I combined the flour and powdered sugar in my food processor and sliced my cold butter into 1/4" slices and then pulsed until the butter was in small pieces then ran it until the mixture was crumbly but not in a ball of dough.  I sprayed my 9X13" baking dish with Pam for baking with flour.  Spread the mixture in the pan and patted it down.  Baked it about 20 min.  Added the filling and baked another 25 min.  This sliced a lot easier and was every bit as good as the original recipe from 40+ years ago.  This is the way I'm making these from now on.

Can't wait to make this again. Had them for dessert and then with coffee the next day. My company asked to take some home with them. Quick note-Cutting the cherries into quarters stain your fingers.

EXCELLENT with Craisins and Macadamia nuts. Would be good with dried blueberries or cherry-berry mix.

My husband ate 3/4 the pan in one day if that tells you anything. It has all his favorite things in it - the cherries, the walnuts and just enough coconut. I will try some toasted pecans in the crust just for fun next time, but honestly this recipe is wonderful just the way it is.

Like someone else said, if you use a 9x13 pan, the crust is too thin.  It was also really hard to cut through the gooey texture and get them out of the pan.  Next time I would add chocolate chips as suggested and try a smaller pan.  Maybe they'll be better if I try again.

Wow!  Absolutely the best tasting dessert.  I too added chocolate chips, 1/4 Cup, and it was a very nice addition.  I tried putting the crust in the size pan that was called for, but it barely covered the bottom of the pan, so I ended up cooking it in an 8x8 and cooked it (crust & filling) for 40 minutes.  Wonderful!!!

I'm not a fan of maraschino cherries so I thought I would try this recipe with frozen cherries.  I love cherries and coconut and the bars turned out really well.  The texture was a lot like a lemon bar.   I couldn't really taste my 1/2 cup of frozen cherries (chopped) at all so I just wanted to give a review about it in case anyone else thought to try it.  They were still really good and have a delightful texture.

Ok..I rarely give bad reviews here.  First of all, the flavor of this bar is very good.  However, it doesn't have near enough cherries to barely even cover it!  Secondly, it is so messy when you go to cut this, the top cracks and is not very presentable on a cookie tray.  3 stars is pushing it in my opinion.

This was ok for me. I have other bar cookies that I enjoy more. The crust was kind of flaky and there didn't seem to be enough of the ingredients for the top layer. I made it exactly as written. It wasn't bad, it wasn't over the top either and I'm at a point in my recipe collection, that I want "over the top" recipes.

These were unexpectedly delicious, the top is crusty, the middle soft almost runny and the bottom a perfect flaky buttery crust.  

I had trouble with the cooking time. I used a 8x11.5 glass pan and the crust took 16 mins and the filling almost 35 minutes. After 20 they looked cooked but runny, I added 10 more minutes and they still did not seem firm on the inside. Maybe that is how they are supposed to be? Perhaps I will make these for Christmas with dark chocolate as recommended by others! Thanks!

These are really, really good!  Hubby was wanting chocolate and I wasn't, so I sprinkled chocolate chips on half of the pan before baking.  He liked that side better, but I prefered the non-chocolate side.  However you make them, they are great!

These bars turned out great. I also added a few chocolate chips for my husband. The bars are pretty sweet. I thought perhaps the bars might also work well with regular dried cherries to add tartness.

Easy to make, everyone enjoyed them.  Not a WOW, but a terrific alternative to chocolate.
