2.20.16   The orange flavor comes through nicely in these pancakes.  They cooked up beautifully, tender, and moist.  As suggested by the recipe author, I did use coconut oil instead of butter.  At 1/4 cup each, I ended up with 8 pancakes.  Thanks for sharing.

I topped these with creme cheese to actually give it a creme flavor and drizzled half of a fresh orange on top using the orange I had originally zested. It gives it a more fresh vibrant orange taste. And honey on top is always delicious

I followed the recipe exactly as written and I could not taste the orange juice, let alone the Creamsicle effect. My orange juice was fresh squeezed and my oranges were organic. I don't know what went wrong.

Tasty, tasty!  Used fresh-squeezed OJ, left out zest.  Wonderful, creamy orange flavor.  Made 8 using a 1/4 cup scoop.  If time is not an issue, let pancake batter rest for 10-15 minutes for even fluffier cakes!

Great recipe, pancakes had great flavor.   I was running late so the only thing I didn't measure was the orange zest but I zested 1 large orange and the end result was wonderful.  Will definitely make again.

Absolutely amazing! I doubled the recipe and I'm so glad I did! I did not use any oil or butter to cook these in and they turned out light and fluffy.  I definitely will be making these again.

I had to multiply the recipie by 4 to feed my family of 6.  I had no orange zest, so I used 1/2 a teaspoon of orange extract per recipe, and the orange flavor  is rather subtle but good. I like these pancakes very much!

These turned out delicious ! Very fluffy and flavorful. They were very easy and quick to make. I followed the recipe exactly, maybe used a little extra vanilla but that’s it. I could taste the orange just fine but if you really want it to stand out double the orange zest. Super yummy! I’ll make them again for sure.

We used water instead of milk, added dried cherries, topped with walnuts and maple syrup and they were yummy!

My 10 year old daughter wanted to make pancakes for her brother and I. She searched recipes and picked this one she made the recipe exactly as written and they were the best pancakes ever!! We did let the batter sit for about 10 minutes and they came out very fluffy and the orange flavor came through very well. We had to make two batches, each batch made 8-9 cakes

My family and I loved these.  The only modification I made was to add fresh blueberries to it.  The orange taste was there and it was just fantastic!

ABSOLUTELY DELISH!! Made these for brunch for my girls and I, they were soo good. Simple and satisfying. I used 2 teaspoons of orange zest and 1/4 cup of the juice from a freshly squeezed cara cara orange. I topped the pancakes with a homemade vanilla cream cheese icing.

Very good, next time I may add a touch of orange extract too because my child wanted more orange taste.  The recipe is great as is though, subtitle, but noticeable.

Great chg of pace breakfast. Only change I'll make next time is to double the zest. It is correct, serves 4 (barely if you love pancakes!). Wife loves maple syrup, my fav is my homemade blackberry syrup which really brings out the orange flavor. Plus the color metric is off the chart!

These are just wonderful as is. I have made them many times and they are a hit with the whole family. A few ways I have modified them over the years is to use buttermilk instead of milk and to let the batter rest 10 minutes or so. Both of these subtle changes really increase the fluffiness. During the holidays I like to add dried cranberries and 1/2 - 1 tsp of cinnamon for holiday pancakes. Yum!!

We just made this and it was exactly as is says, orange and creamy. Besides the original we added white chocolate to some that turned out great too. Another batch we made with lemon juice and zest with blueberries, awesome! We can't wait to try out other flavors. Thanks for posting!

Yes, I will definitely make these again in the near future, they really hit the spot.  The only problem I had is the serving amount.  There was hardly enough to go around to 3 kids and I had to make them very small.  Portion control, I suppose!  I used freshly squeezed clementines (took 4 of them) and their zest as well.  The aroma alone was enough to make this mommy happy.  Thanks for sharing this recipe, my kids are in pancake heaven right now.

Finished off buttermilk as most of milk; never know with pancake recipes if serves number is how many people or how many pancakes. Doubled the recipe and this will serve two meals worth for my husband and self. Very tasty.
