This recipe has quite a good flavor, but I, like Michelle live in Louisiana - and this isn't creole red beans and rice.  Like she said, leave out the tomatoes for the traditional version...   I added plenty more garlic, a good dose of Tony's (a Louisiana must!), and jalepano-style Tabasco sauce.  We like more rice here, as well.  Still, this is a good recipe - and a great option when short on time.  I'll make it again with the extras :).

This recipe is not like a traditional red beans and rice recipe. I was trying to find one and made this. No tomatoes are in real red beans and rice. I live in Louisiana and these were not even close to how they are served down south. They tasted OK, but I was disappointed in the results.

YUM.  I love this, I skipped the sausage, so I sauted the onion & garlic (two cloves) in a tsp. of olive oil.  I also used brown rice, cajun-seasoned diced tomatoes and added about 2 Tbsp. of fresh chopped parsley.  Very light & healthy, thanks Paula!

This is a really great receipe for rice and beans!  I am a vegetarian, so I cut out the sausage and sauteed in olive oil.  I also added 1/8 tspn. of cayenne to spice it up a little. This dish has an excellent flavor and is one of the better receipes for rice and beans I have come across.  Highly Recommended!

Kind of a funky meal.  Except for the sausage, the ingredients didn't have much flavour and created a strange texture.  I followed the recipe almost exactly except I used 3 clove of garlic and at the end I combined everything including the rice into one bowl.  I will not be making this again.

I thought this was very good and super easy to make.  I did add some cajun seasoning but the spicy cajun sausage I used provided plenty of "kick."  We'll definitely make this again.

WOW, was this good. My husband and I had it for dinner and we both liked it very much. So much so, that we ate it all ourselves. I improvised a little and added one hot green pepper, mushrooms and some extra garlic. It was tasty and had a perfect kick to it. Thanks for the recipe, Paula. I'll be making this again and again.

I liked this.  It might not be "authentic" (I have no idea), but it sure was tasty!  I only used one can of beans, 1/2 an onion and I used chicken sausage, because that is what I had.  I added some extra garlic, too.  I combined it with the rice before serving - it was a really filling, satisfying meal.  Served it with Jalapeno Corn Bread.

This was so easy to make and delicious!!  I used fat free smoked turkey sausage, a little parsley, and a couple of bay leaves.  My 15 year old raved about it.  I will definitely add this to my list to family favorites.

This is an easy and healthy recipe.  I offer cajun seasoning for sprinkling for those that like it spicy.  My toddler loves it as is! A definite keeper.

I made this last night in anticipation of Fat Tuesday.  I understand that this is not a totally traditional red beans and rice recipe, so I did not expect totally authentic RB&R.   That being said, I made this dish as written, but using andouille sausage and adding two chopped stalks of celery with the onions and about a half cup of chicken broth.  With these changes, it was fabulous.  Quick and easy for a busy work night meal!!  Plenty of seasoning from the andouille, so I didnâ€™t need to add the extra cajun seasoning I had ready.  Just a couple of shakes of Tabasco was all it needed.  Next time I make this, and there will be a nex time, I will make it the same way I did, but probably add another can of beans.

This is a really good, quick version of the "real" thing.  I have family in Louisiana and lived there for a while myself so I know what red beans and rice is.  A few things I would suggest doing to give a little more flavor is definitely use andouille sausage instead of just smoked or kielbasa.  It's a New Orleans style sausage that has a tiny bit of a kick but not to much.  I haven't been able to find it at Wal-Mart but most regular grocery stores carry it.  I also added an extra clove of garlic, one can of diced tomatoes with green chilies instead of the whole tomatoes, and two bay leaves while everything is simmering.  This is good to eat right away but even better the next day after the leftovers sit all night.  Btw, a secret to Cajun cooking is that the cook adds what they like.  If they like tomatoes, then they add tomatoes.

As a new cook, I look for easy recipes, and this looked like (and was) a relatively easy dish to make.  I used a can of diced tomatoes instead of chopping whole tomatoes, omitted the green bell pepper (my mom doesn't like them), and added cajun seasoning.  It turned out a tasty meal that I will make again!  Mom liked to too, so that was a plus!

Very tasty! This has become a weekly regular at my house. Makes a filling lunch and a rather simple dinner. Sometimes I skip the sausage and its still very good. I also think it benefits from some celery sauteed with the other veggies.

This was GREAT, though I altered it considerably based on my tastes and what I had on hand:
-Used 2x the amount of sausage (Jennie-O lean smoked turkey sausage, couldn't find kielbasa)
-2 green bell peppers (I omitted the onion)
-2 cans of Del Monte zesty diced tomatoes with green pepper and onion
-2 cans red beans, one undrained
-3 minced garlic cloves, onion powder, garlic powder, black pepper, 3 tsp Emeril's Bayou Blast seasoning, 1 tsp red pepper flakes
-Substituted brown rice instead of white rice

My husband and I both loved this dish, though I think if you followed the recipe as written, it would come out bland.  But if that's your preference, that's cool! :)

This turned out pretty good. Wife and I enjoyed it, although it could've had a little bit more heat. Overall, good recipe when looking for something quick.

Made this tonight with a few changes. I didn't have tomatoes so I used Progresso hearty tomatoe soup. Left out the pepper. More garlic. Emerils bayou seasoning. Left out oregano since soup had seasoning. Added some hot sauce. Moral is it was quick and easy AND my kids ate whole plates of it... That's a winner. For me I would add more seasoning and heat.

ok, so not authentic if you are from LA. Fine, rename it and call it Rice and Tomato Red Beans. I loved this recipe!! sooo easy. Yes I added more garlic, yes I added celery, but that's just the veggies I like in a dish like this! Great for a cold night with French bread bagette!

I didn't have kielbasa on hand, so I cooked a German sausage. I used rotel with green chilis to make it more spicy, which it did! I will be making this again, but next time as the recipe calls for.

This is a great recipe that I've made a few times. I've used Ro-tel tomatoes before but I'm a bit wimpy so that tends to turn out a bit too spicy for me. I use regular kielbasa rather than turkey. Nice recipe that's easy and tasty!

Very tasty, especially when substituting a jar of salsa for the tomatoes.  I used a chunky salsa with medium flavor and I think it made the difference--there was nothing bland about the dish. I also added a few stalks of celery and more garlic; used a red pepper instead of green. Served it over brown rice.  I also did double the rice; there was more beans/vegetable mix and I think 1 cup of rice won't go as far. Now I have a nice leftover dish for later in the week.

As is, this recipe is a three star, in my opinion. The second time I made it, I made a few changes, and it was amazing. Once I took out the tomatoes, and added a lot of cajun seasoning, this was awesome. This will be added into my regular rotation with the changes I mentioned. If my boyfriend hadn't insisted on trying it again, without the tomato, I probably never would have bothered with it. I'm glad he pushed me to make the necessary changes.

This was inexpensive, but unexpectedly crazy delicious with not a scrap left for lunch. I didn't change a thing- used kielbasa and kept the tomatoes. Try it as is and you won't be sorry. Well, I did change it a wee bit by draining most of the tomato juice before adding them. Seriously, this is gonna become a staple. Thanks for the recipe!

I am giving this 5 stars even though I tweaked it a bit. I used 1/2 bag of dried black beans (soaked cooked of course) because my family does not like red beans. I used a can of crushed tomatoes because I didn't want to do any chopping.  At a friend's suggestion, I used a pack of Carolina Saffron yellow rice mix with seasonings found in the grocery store rice aisle.  One packet was barely enough for my family of 4 so you may need to use 2 (it cost 75 cents!).  My entire family LOVED this meal.  We are from PA and don't care if it's authentic or not.  It was easy and delicious!

I wanted to try red beans and rice and made this for my husband and a friend (who hates rice).  Both loved it!  I rather liked it too, and I don't even care for spicy foods. (I added a few shakes of hot sauce and some homemade cajun seasoning blend-hubby likes it hot).  I had to omit bell pepper-didn't have any, but I think next time I would like to use red bell pepper. I cut the recipe in half but still used a full can of tomatoes-used fire roasted diced.  Also, I cook plain rice in chicken stock, not water, for flavor.  Will definitely make this one again and again!  This recipe is described as an "easy take on a LA classic." If you're looking to make an easy meal with red beans and rice, TRY THIS: IT'S GOOOOD!

I decided to cook this dish AFTER seeing the word "easy" and AFTER reading the most helpful reviews.  So I knew going in that this wouldn't be like authentic red beans and rice and I knew that I would have to spice it up a bit.  With that being said, I gave this 5-stars because it's a great base recipe and it's truly very easy, which is much appreciated when you have a big family to feed.  Plus, this kind of reminds me of chili, which is a dish you have to make your own.  If you like to spice up foods and add your own touch then this might be a good dish for you.  The changes I made were: I used smoked beef sausage and drained the fat before adding the green peppers, onions and garlic, I used canned red beans because that's what I had in my pantry, and I added a couple of sprinkles of hot sauce, cajun seasoning, and cumin.  My family loved it!  Even hubby liked it and he's quite the "food critic".  Thanks for this stress-free, family-filling and frugal recipe!

I just made this dish, it was easy and fast. I made basmati rice and it was delicious! I used turkey kielbasa sausage and added chopped onion and minced garlic. After simmering I added pace picante sauce, 1/2 can of diced tomatoes, a stalk of celery, and a can of red beans. I sprinkled a little bit of cumin and it was a wrap.

DELICIOUS!  Even picky teen liked it!  Left out meat for vegetarian son, followed recommendations for extra garlic & 1 stalk of celery.  I used 1/4 onion because thats what I had on hand.  Sauteed veggies in olive oil but I didn't have any peppers.  I used a can of Italian diced tomatoes & 1 tsp Cajun seasoning (some family members don't like spicey).  I didn't realize I was supposed to drain the beans so I washed them & replaced the can water with chicken broth (don't tell my vegetarian son!).  Gently crushed some of the beans to thicken up the sauce & it turned out perfectly, not too watery at all!  We will definately make this one again!

I like this recipe and have made it several times.  Instead of kielbasa I use smoked sausage and brown the sausage along with the onion, peppers, and garlic.  I also use Penzey's Spices Cajun Seasoning to give it additional heat and a stronger flavor.  Delicious!

I think this is a good recipe.  I made it because we are beginning to eat healthier and I liked the nutrition facts on this.  While I agree some spices are lacking (I used 2 tsp of my Emeril's "Bayou Blast" and will add more garlic and onion powder next time), I think some people need to be reminded that this is "EASY" red beans and rice.  Nowhere in the recipe title does it state "cajun" or "authentic".  If you are looking for something that's quick, healthy and tasty (with a little help from some extra seasoning), then this is for you.  If you are looking for something "authentic", then you may want to look elsewhere.

An incredibly easy to follow and came out so GOOD!  I used chipotle seasoned kielbasa, a purple pepper (that's what I had on hand), salsa instead of the canned tomatoes, and cajun seasoning -- all recommendations from a previous poster and what a great result - see my picture!  It took me no time to prepare and it was a hit.  This is an easy dish that will have everyone thinking you worked far harder on it than you actually did.  Thanks for a great recipe.

I have made this recipe a few times and we always love it - even my kids.  I substitute a can of pinto beans and black beans instead of kidney bean (personal preference) and omit the green pepper.  I didn't have flavored tomatoes so I just added a tsp of cajun seasoning.

This is a delicious (if less than authentic) dish! I added jalapenos and a few shakes of Tobasco to give it some kick, and served over steamed short-grain brown and wild rice...my hubbie and I loved it!

Very easy to make and tastes great. I used a 16 oz. jar of salsa in place of the can of tomatoes. After reading the reviews I added extra garlic and sprinkled cayenne and red pepper flakes in the skillet. I over did it, very hot, I am the kind of cook the has measuring cups and spoons out when I am cooking and this is why, way too much spice, my bad.  I'm going to mix in a can of plain sauce today to try and mellow the heat. Will definitely make this again.

Delicious! I used dehydrated onions, green and red peppers and just rehydrated them with some water in the microwave before adding to the sausage. I also doubled the garlic and oregano and added 1tsp sage. It went great with brown and white rice mixed as well as a light garden salad.

Based on other reviews, I knew this might be a bit bland for my liking, but I thought it was a good starting point (I wasn't going for "traditional" at all here).  I ended up building in more flavor after tasting it half way through the simmering time.

Ingredient changes are as follows:  I used 2 cloves of garlic, diced canned tomatoes, 2 tsp Weber's N'Orleans Cajun Seasoning, 1-2 tbsp apple cider vinegar (sounds weird, but just trust me on this one) and served it over brown rice.  Seriously delish.

My family LOVED it!  I have 10 & 7 year olds so that means something. 
I made it minus the sausage. And I didn't have green pepper so I added a healthy dash of red pepper powder which gave it a nice little kick. If you want the sauce a bit thicker, mash some of the red beans and add back in.

So easy. Family loved it so much they oooddd and aaauuued and applauded. They do that when they enjoy their meal. Cause once I watched a chef cooking show and said no one does that when I make dinner like the audience does. They felt this recipe is well worthy. Easy to make and hummu.

This was nothing like 'traditional' red beans and rice flavor.  Not a bad taste, but if you're looking for a quick recipe to get the traditional red beans and rice flavor this was not it.

OMG this was so yummy, tasty and easy.  I believe it will go on company rotation!!  Thanks for posting such an awesome recipe.

I did tweak it.  I used Rotel tomatoes with green chilies.  and instead of oregano used 2 tsp of italian seasoning.  It really took the flavor to a whole new level.

I made this dish twice.  The first time I followed the recipe exactly and it came out pretty good.  My only problem is that it was a bit bland.  I don't think there was enough flavor in the turkey Kielbasa I used.  The 2nd time I made it I used smoked beef Kielbasa and added one more garlic clove.  It was good the fist time, but fantastic the 2nd time.  If you don't mind the added calories and fat, use real Kielbasa.  You'll love it especially the leftovers.  Make a lot, it gets better after a night in the fridge.

This isn't bad for a quick fix meal, but as a previous reviewer stated, the flavors don't really meld together as I imagined they would.

I really liked this regardless of the authenticity of the recipe.  I followed the recipe pretty closely, but added about 1 tbsp of creole seasoning and 1/8 tsp of red pepper.  Used a 12 ounce turkey kilbasa and one whole tetrapack of Pomi chopped tomatoes.  Didn't have green pepper so I used a red pepper, also had only one can of red kidneys so for the second can, I used white kidneys.  Colorful, but I also put the whole thing over brown rice.   My family and I really enjoyed the taste and I will probably make this again and experiment with other favors and seasonings.

This was pretty darn good!  I ended up using smoked sausage - but would like to track down some andouille sausage for the next time I make it.  To make it more authentic, I didn't use the tomatoes, I used 3 cloves of garlic, and I added some chopped celery and Cajun / creole seasoning.  I also used 4 cans of red beans and made sure to smash some of them before serving (I used a potato masher - but you could also just smash some on the side of the pan with your spoon)

This is great tasting and EASY so it gets a 5!!!  If your looking for an authentic beans and rice this isn't it but it is tastes great!!!  I've made it several times and think its more flavorful with real kielbasa - the grease adds something lol - not as healthy but has a fuller flavor - also don't be afraid to add additional spices for a kick. I make the rice in my rice cooker so it's even easier!

Wow.  This is incredibly easy and so delicious! I subbed brown rice and only put in half the beans.  Next time, I'll use diced tomatoes as recommended. I had never tried turkey sausage and was floored that I could tell NO DIFFERENCE! This is going in my permanent recipe box!

This was good and a cinch to make.  I made it for a potluck and there was nothing to take home. I would make 2 suggestions. This recipe has way too many beans.  I would cut the beans in half otherwise it's overwhelming (still good but overwhelming especially for kids) or you could use 2 cups rice instead of one.  Also, I would follow the other user's suggestion and use a can of diced tomatoes.

Great recipe!  The kids liked it and it was a good quick and filling meal.  I will definitely have this recipe on hand for regular use.  The only thing I would change is I would triple the amount of rice

The dish was edible, however, I will not be making this again. I kicked it up with the addition of cayenne, but found it to be dry, not very saucy. And I agree with other reviewers that tomatoes seemed out of place. Not impressed what so ever.

Mmmmmm.  Used hot Italian sausage for my meat lover ( I picked out the sausage).  Used red pepper and one onion and lots of garlic. After reading reviews decided to go with tomatoes because I love them. Stuck with the 2 cans of beans. Also added a little soffrito (?) that I found in the Goya section of market. Lots of oregano, a little cumin and a bit of cayenne on top of salt and pepper. Covered and cooked for 15 and then a few more minutes uncovered.  It was a huge hit.  I added avocado to my sausage-less portion and I was so happy.  The hubs loved and I will definitely make again.

My fiance and I enjoyed this recipe, although it was a bit bland.  I used a can of diced tomatoes instead of chopping up the whole tomatoes.  Next time I'll add a couple of dashes of Frank's Hot Sauce or Tabasco for some extra spice!  It's a nice, easy to prepare meal!  Enjoy!

This was SO good. I did make a few changes; I used brown rice (more healthy) and I used Cajun seasonings to make it taste a bit more southern. Tasted amazing!!!

LOVED IT! I looked at other reviews before preparation and it did look like this would be bland so I used Zatarain's Creole seasoning like one reviewers mentioned. Don't need to add salt since this seasoning has a lot of salt. I didn't have sausage, so I used beef that I thinly sliced and added diced habanero pepper to spice it up (i love peppery/spicy food). I used dried beans and cooked it in a slow cooker. Omitted the tomatoes. This is a great way to eat beans!!

It was ok. I ended up adding some flour (mixed in water) to the sausage mixture because it was too juicy. I agree with other reviewers, it tasted kind of flat and bland, even with all the good stuff in it. I think next time I will use seasoned rice. It's pretty healthy and quick so I will probably make again, thanks!

Delicious!!!

I used Italian sausage instead of Kielbasa and Zatarans Creole Seasoning instead of salt.

I also cooked the entire meal, minus the rice, in my slow cooker.  Came out very savory. 

Thank you for this awesome recipe.  Great work.

I loved this recipe! It definitly wasnt like the traditional red beans and rice but it was really good and it was healtly. I sauted the onions, pepper, garlic and sausage together first and i added and extra can of kidney beans. I also combined the cooked rice at the end and i served it with cornbread. MMMMMM!

I enjoyed this dish very much.  It is lighter and not as heavy as regular red beans and rice which I liked for a change.  I used chopped celery and a few extra cloves of garlic just because I had it. I also added in about 1 tbsp. of cajun seasoning.  It was really good.

FIVE stars for being super easy!  3.5 for taste...I thought it was okay, but the boyfriend said it was delicious and gave it a 5.  This dish would definitely need more herbs/spices though.  I upped the garlic and added a few teaspoons of cajun seasoning....still seemed to be missing something.

This was simply edible. It was easy to make with things in the cupboard. But even after adding some good smoked paprika, cumin, salt and more italian seasoning, I just was not impressed. Hot sauce didn't even help.  So it was something to eat, but that's about it.  Check out Vikki's Red Bean Sausage recipe on this site...it's my fave so far.

I have no idea how "authentic" red beans and rice taste but I liked the ease of this recipe. I sauteed some onions in vegetable oil.  I then added a can of Original Rotel as suggessted by another review.  I let that simmer for a few minutes and then added a can of drained red beans and half a link of Hilshire Farms Beef Smoked sausage sliced diagonally.  I added the seasonings from the "Authentic Louisian Red Beans and Rice" recipe found on this site and let it all simmer some more with a lid.  Before serving I found the  concoction didnt have enough "gravy" to mix with the rice, so I added a little more water and thickened the whole batch with cornstarch until it had the thickness I wanted.  What resulted was a spicy and savory and hearty dish that tasted great served over steamed white rice (I use a rice cooker because I'm lazy).  This recipe is a great start for anyone to create a "red beans & rice" dish that suits their tastes.

I know this isn't authentic red beans and rice, but it sure is good.  I ended up using one 14-oz can of diced tomatoes and then chopped up 2 small tomatoes I had on hand.  Also used 3 cans of kidney beans (one can undrained on purpose) and added a bunch of seasoning to taste (cajun, cumin, red pepper, etc.).  A definite keeper.

This was a really good quick recipe for tinkering with to suit your family's tastes. I was looking for a more "cajun" style flavor so I replaced the turkey kielbasa with andouille sausage and used about a tbsp of creole seasoning and a few dashes of hot sauce instead of the oregano. I also didn't drain the kidney beans before adding them (whoops, my mistake) and just cooked it a little longer to reduce the liquid. It came out delicious, husband and son really enjoyed it!

I ended up doubling the recipe because my parents wanted some. The flavor was good but I did add salt. I bought 2 16oz bags of beans and soaked them over night. The next day I threw everything into the crockpot on 10 hours. (I browned the turkey sausage first.) OH, I also added lots of water to cook the beans in. This meant that I'd have to thicken the water -- which I did with cornstarch and water mixture. I skipped the sage because I did not have any. The flavor turned out great, but only 4 stars because I was just unsure how to cook those beans! Next time I will probably use cans.

Yum! I added some cajun seasoning to make is more spicy. I used the closest amount of indredients as I could find. I couldn't find cans in the amount the recipe called for but it still turned out great.

My roommate said it reminded him of a small restaurant in the french quarter of New Orleans. :)

Goes great with cornbread! Especially cajun cornbread.

This dish was good but a little bland.  I tweaked it a bit by adding additional seasoning which included cajun.  I don't measure, I just added till it was just right for my taste.

I give this 3 stars because, as is, it's very bland. After tasting it in its originally intended state, I took cues from other reviewers and added crushed red pepper, hot sauce, and cajun seasoning; that helped. There was not enough rice for the amount of other ingredients; next time, I'd triple the rice. I used a pound of turkey kielbasa, and it wasn't enough; next time I'd add at least another 8 oz. I'd also drain the tomatoes a bit; there was too much liquid that didn't evaporate, so the mixture was a bit too watery. Other than that, it was pretty good, and I'd have given it 4 or 5 stars had the original recipe included my alterations.

I inherited a very similar recipe from my mother. This is vastly improved by adding basil (1 tsp) and crushed red pepper (1/2 tsp). I also increase the oregano to 1 tsp. Serve with pepper sauce or cider vinegar and Texas Pete's. Also, since I cook for two, I generally half the recipe and use a can of rotel (which is smaller) instead a 16 oz can of tomatoes.

Finally, I reduce the amount of sausage (that way I don't feel bad about using kielbasa instead of turkey sausage) and I serve it over brown rice instead of white.

I like this dish because it's pretty healthy, can be whipped up quickly with ingredients I usually have on hand, and even my picky husband likes it. Plus, since I have a rice cooker, it's an easy leftover-lunch the next day!

Quick easy way to make red beans and rice.  May not be authentic, but my family loves it.  I also use cajun spice, for that added kick.  Any cooking recipe is just a guide, you can add an subtract as you want to suit your taste.

This was a very good, easy to make recipe. I added hot sauce, red pepper flakes, chilli powder and creole seasoning for a lil more spice. Otherwise, I made the recipe as is. Very tasty and I will definitely make again.

good basic recipe but needs adjusting to the amt. of heat/spice for your own individual taste. If you use canned beans i would recommend letting the "sauce" simmer to let the flavors marry together and add the beans last 20 min. or so to keep them from getting too soft. I prefer the taste if the tomatoes have slow simmered for a while ( at least 40 min. or more)

I did like some other commenters had done and cut out the tomato from the sauce. I added some jalapeno hot sauce and doubled the amount of rice. It was really great served with a side of sliced fresh tomatoes- I'll definitely be making this again!

Yummy! My husband made this for dinner and said it was so easy to make. Even all our kids enjoyed it!!
He did say he would add an extra can of beans and even though it's not traditional to have the tomatoes, I like the "healthy factor" they bring. :)
We'll keep it for sure!

This was good but for my family way too tomato-y. I will cut the tomatoes by half next time and use crushed tomatoes instead of whole. Worked well with turkey kielbasa.

Pretty good.  I used spicy pork sausage because I am not a big fan of turkey kielbasa, also left out the green pepper.  It wasn't quite spicy enough for me so I added quite a bit of cayenne.  This is an easy dish to whip up over the weekend and then take the leftovers for lunch during week.

This is a tasty recipe; however, I agree with the reviewers who say it's not really red beans and rice.  There is no gravy, it needs more beans, etc.  BUT, if you look at it as a Cajun or Creole dish, it is good.  The title is just misleading.  It needs more liquid and more beans.

I made this for my family and really enjoyed it. However I tweeked it a bit. I used Mexican Stewed Tomatoes, and Tony's Creole Herb Seasoning both in the rice water and the sausage mix. It isn't authentic but it works if you are pressed for time.

Good recipe.  I also added hot chile sauce and jalepeno sauce while simmering.  Gave 4 stars b/c I guess I'm not a fan of this kind of dish.  Good recipe and VERY easy, though.

I think this is yummy! I agree that it is not a "traditional" red beans and rice recipe.  However, it is very good!  I omit the meat and add some shredded sharp cheddar on top - YUM!

Quick and tasty. My only change is to use diced and peeled tomatoes, rather than chopping up whole peeled tomatoes.

This is a nice change from what I usually make for dinner. My little girls love beans, so it wasn't hard to convince them to eat it.

Best beans ever.  I only had dry beans so thats what I used.  Skipped bell pepper since I didn't have it.  Had diced tomatoes with chilli peppers instead of whole so I used them.  I also added cajun seasoning, 1tsp cumin, and 8 sliced jalepenos.  Spicy but even my kids liked them.

Very tasty. I didn't have any green pepper, so I added chopped celery for some color and crunch. I also added quite a few healthy shakes of Tony's Creole Seasoning. Yummy :)

Us from New Orleans don't put tomatoes in red beans...weird. If you are gonna used canned beans shoot for Blue Runner brand, that was my grandma's short cut, just throw some meat in (ham or sausage) and your good to go.

Super easy to make, and flavorful (we used chicken andouille sausages) but definitely not Cajun. But we liked it in its own right, and my teenage son and husband both declared it a keeper.

The key word is easy. If you want authentic stuff it will take time and effort.  I was worried about this not tasting right but I was pleasantly surprised. This was quick and my two year old liked it. Great recipe for busy families.

Yummy!  Added creole seasoning and hot sauce, and used deeeliious ful fat sausage.  Could've put in a little more sausage as my man and I had to fight for it.  Will definitely make again!

This recipe came out really good, but I added a LOT more spice. I think it would have been pretty bland if I hadn't. I ended up adding about 2 or 3 tbs of Emeril's Essence, and about 4 more garlic cloves than it called for. The result is perfection! Yum yum!

This was pretty good, although I made some changes to add a little more taste. First, I used broth instead of water. Second, I let all the ingredients simmer together, instead of boiling the rice separately. Finally, I added a little Cajun spice to it.

Very decent, economical dinner, although very filling. You don't need much rice with this one. It would also be good without rice but with a side of cornbread. Tasty and easy and fast. Thanks!

This came out good with some changes. Used a can of diced tomatoes at other's suggestions. Also added a fair amount of creole seasoning and favorite hot sauce. Used 2 cloves of garlic instead of 1 and eliminated bell pepper. Husband liked it. Will make again.

This is really good!  It's a simple meal with lots of flavor.  I used Chorico instead of kielbasi, quite a few shakes of Red Hot sauce, and added 8 oz. tomato sauce -- we like things spicy and "saucy."  Next time I would add more green peppers though, they add a nice flavor.

Going on the advice of other reviews I added more spices to make it hotter.  It worked!  I added red pepper flakes and Louisiana hot sauce.  Hubbie loved it, which makes this a keeper!

This is quite good, but I think I would like it better with regular smoked sausage or polska kielbasa rather than the turkey sausage.  The turkey sausage I used was a little too sweet for my liking.

Followed the recipe exactly, and it was very good. A lot of food for 2 empty-nesters, so I can vouch that the leftovers were just as good, maybe better than the first meal. My wife likes more sauce in her food, so next time I make it, I plan to add a can of tomato sauce, and maybe some shrimp, to the recipe.

I am not a Louisiana purist who doesnâ€™t like tomatoes in red bean and rice, so I used a can of roasted tomatoes. I grew up in Alabama, and my granny always added chopped fresh tomatoes from her garden to almost everything she cooked.

I subbed andouille sausage and totes for the kielbasa and stewed tomatoes. No onions, extra garlic. Extra thyme and Cajun seasoning. Delicious.  This was a great base recipe to get what I wanted!

Turned out very well.   I baked the rice in a covered dish in the oven for 45 minutes at 350 while I was cooking so I didn't have to worry about it.  Also substituted andouille sausage to make it more authentic.  And I was able to find some Bush's brand small red beans that were "New Orleans" spiced that added some spiciness.  Real red beans and rice isn't made with kidney beans, they're made with a smaller red bean and these Bush's beans were the real thing.  Also skipped the oregano and added a few bay leaves while it was simmering. So I guess, overall, this recipe was just a guideline.  ;-)

The kids enjoyed this and so did the adults. Nice flavors and quick and easy to prepare. Would have preferred a different type of meat. The kielbasa didn't really do it for us but still an all around solid dish.

It may not be traditional, but whatever.  Kielbasa is okay, but you can find different kinds of Andouille sausage in grocery stores, even up here in NW Indiana.  I used red beans I cooked in my InstaPot as well as brown rice from there.  This is a nice, easy staple dinner.

Although its not "authentic" red beans and rice it was still good for something quick and easy. I doubled the rice and cooked it with some cilantro and tomato bouillon (California style) which was super tasty. Added some cayenne pepper and McCormick cajun seasoning for a kick and dinner was served.

I just made this recipe and it was so delicious! The only things I did differently were using a can of petite diced tomatoes instead of whole tomatoes, adding 4 stalks of celery (just because I had some that needed to be used), and I added 1 TBS of Creole seasoning. After I tasted it, I thought it needed a little kick, and that did the trick! Will definitely be making this again and again! Thanks Paula for sharing!

This is very close to the red beans and rice where I used to work. I did use cajun seasoning and added some red pepperflakes. I think i will use more tomatoes the next time as I like it a little more like stew. I had ben craving this and live outside of the US now so these kind of dishes are hard to find. Was very happy to be able to make it myself. Thanks!!

I loved this dish....My fiance was amazed when he found out I used canned beans instead of cooking them myself. I will most definetely use this recipe again. I did do some-what of a remix to it to make it a little bit more spicier, but overall it was great..

NO this isn't authentic red beans and rice but I'm not an authentic louisiannian either.  If that's how you spell it. This was very good I really enjoyed it for my lunch. I didn't have any green pepper so I used the frozen mix of celery onion and green peppers and a can of diced tomatoes with jalapenos. Very good will make again. Thanks.

Great Recipe!!  I added 1/2 t thyme, a dash of parsley, some celery salt, and 1/2 t cayenne pepper.  I omitted the oregano and used mild italian sausage and stewed tomatoes.  I used about twice the rice and it was just right.  Make sure that you let the beans simmer for a while so they soak up the flavor.  Add a little water if you want it a little more saucy.

It was easy and good.  I cooked my own red beans first, & I used hot turkey sausage and also added a minced jalapeno and some cajun seasoning as we like our red beans really spicy.  I still had to had a splash of hot pepper sauce when I served. This is a good basic recipe that you can easily adapt to suit your family's tastes.

This recipe is so easy! I used more garlic and added Cajun seasoning. I made it without the sausage once and simply added a bit of olive oil to replace the fat from the meat(it needs a little fat for flavour). We've had it plain, with corn chips, rolled up in tortillas with hot sauce and ranch dressing. Some of us melted cheese on top too. I also have added extra water and cooked the rice in with everything else to make things faster but the presentation and consistency cooked this way is not quite as nice. Thanks for an awesome recipe!

Great recipe!  I took a note from others and doubled the recipe.  I used regular Polska Kielbasa and Bush's red beans (drain AND rinse to remove sodium and the thick juice its in) instead of kidney beans.  I added much more garlic, used Del Monte basil, oregano and garlic diced tomatoes (still added the oregano the recipe called for), added generous sprinkles of Emeril's Bayou Blast creole seasoning, but only a little at a time to prevent over salting (did not use individual salt and pepper since these are already in the seasoning), and only used half a green pepper although I doubled the recipe because I'm not a big fan of them; I may even it completely next time.  Also, some complained that the juice was runny but if you allow the everything to simmer (I even put a lid on for about 15 minutes unlike what the recipe says), the beans will thicken the juice.  After everything was in the pan, I believe I allowed this to simmer for at least 35 to 40 minutes since I doubled the recipe but honestly, I was just looking for the juices to thicken and they did.  I had my heat on medium high then reduced it medium low once it achieved a low boil.  Once I saw the thickness I wanted, I turned off the heat.  This recipe will definitely be in regular rotation for dinner meals.  We loved it and most of all, it's quick!  I was never willing to try red beans and rice because it didn't look appetizing but I figured I'd try this since some reviewers said that their young children liked it.

Had this for supper last night, and it was wonderful! The flavors were absolutely delicious! I made this with Polish  Kilbasa, but will try this again using Turkey, hopefully the flavors will be the same, if not, I'll eat it and enjoy it the fattening way!!!!

This recipe is pretty darned good as isâ€”I make it regularly. The only note I would add is that it needs a LOT of salt and pepper. I usually season, taste, season, taste, and so on . . . many times.

Yum! This made a lot, but my kids and my husband all had seconds, so it is gone in just one night. Instead of the can of whole tomatoes, I used Italian seasoned diced tomatoes. I still used an additional clove of garlic and the oregano, along with the diced pepper and onion. And my kids like pintos over red beans, so I used two cans of drained pinto beans. Very good! I'll make this again.

No this isn't a traditional recipe for rice and beans.  I can't eat those just to dang hot.  This was a wonderful "different take" with great flavor and a family hit that we will def be having again.  If you don't want spicy however want some good flavor this is the way to go.  

I used dried beans, instead of canned, and regular polish sausgae.  I did use more garlic than what was required as well as can of small diced tomatoes which means I used some additional water.  

Fast, easy and very good thanks for the good meal!!

My husband really enjoyed this dish, but I grew up on my parent's red beans and rice which was thicker, and more flavorful.  I wasn't a huge fan of the gr. peppers and tomatoes in my red beans and rice, but since my husband loved it, I'll give it 4 stars.  Plus it was easy to make.  I think I'll go back to soaking and cooking my beans as that route is more flavorful to me than canned beans.

This tasted great!  My husband, daughter and I all really enjoyed it.  I would definitely double the rice next time though. I used smoked sausage, and made the recipe exactly as written, except for a tiny pinch of red pepper flakes for a "kick".

Yum! Easy and fast---I only used one can of beans, chili instead of kidney, and half a red pepper... and I totally forgot to add the oregano and pepper (I never add salt) and it still came out great, but next time I will definitely add the seasonings, as the pepper will give a nice kick.  Great recipe!

This is a good basic recipe but with a little tweaking it's awesome. I added some browned bulk chorizo sausage,used stewed tomatoes and black beans (because thats what I had on hand when I made the second batch) then I served it over fried potatoes that had a variety of mixed vegetables added to them (not to many rice fans in this household). Some reviews said it was to soupy, but what ever it is that your serving it over will asorb that gravy and make that taste good also!

I've never had red beans and rice before, I recieved this in a the allrecipes daily email and I decided to try it!  It was so good.  I did substitute a can of rotel for the tomatoes and then added my desired amount of hot pepper sauce.  I have already passed this recipe on to a neighbor!  My husband loved the taste and the leftovers are yummy!

Awesome!  It did need cayenne pepper, tobasco, and a good bit of salt, but the tomatoes and beans together were great!  I served over brown rise (it's better for you!).

I liked this, but I left out the tomatoes, and added cajun seasoning and a heckuva lot of tobasco.  Since we like our food very spicy, I also served alongside some "Scorned Woman" hot sauce, (made in Louisiana) which is very heavy on the black-pepper.  I also cooked the beans from their dried state first, rather than using cans.  Oh, and I added some finely chopped celery, because it needed using.  I'll probably make this again, but I may tweak it some more.

Fair, but not great.  I found the red bean mixture to be a bit gooey and bland for my taste.  I added a lot of hot pepper sauce and that made it better.  I think I will look for another recipe for this dish.

This is a good recipe. I too found it needed a little more spice. I added cajun spice, some parsley, and I used red beans instead of kidney. I also found that you don't need a lot of rice. It's good almost by itself.

I added a good dose of Tony Catcher's seasoning and a couple shakes of hot sauce. I used Andoille sausage and mixed the rice in for the final simmer. We absolutely loved it and will definitely make it again. Great recipe.

I used 1.5 pounds kielbasa and two bell peppers; I sauteed the meat and veggies for about 8 mins then added 2 cups uncooked rice, canned tomatoes plus their juice, drained kidney beans and about 3 cups of water and let the whole thing simmer for about 15 mins until rice was done. For seasoning, I added 1.5 teaspoons garlic powder (omitting garlic clove), 1.5 teaspoons oregano, 1.5 teaspoons beef boullion and 2 teaspoons Cajun seasoning. I served it to rave reviews with sour cream and cheddar biscuits, I will make again!

I made this one from the basic stuff I usually have in my home.  The only thing I didn't have for this recipe was the green pepper, so I used diced green chilies and it was really good and spicy.  We are a lover of mexican spices so, the green chilies worked good in it.  I think the only thing I would add would be a bit more spice as the oregano wouldn't be enough for us.

I made half the recipe since there's only two of us.  I didn't have kidney beans so used black beans and used a 14 oz. can of diced tomatoes.  I liked the extra bit of juice and turned out very good.

It's not traditional red beans and rice,  but it's quick and tasty.  I added Tony's cajun seasoning as well; just sprinkled it in to taste.  And I used the 90 second Uncle Ben's microwave brown rice. 
My daughter loves it, and it's quick and easy.  So we'll make it again. We're not purists.

Made this last weekend. Doubled the recipe to make some for freezing and to take to work for lunches. I've made red beans and rice using dried beans, which I prefer, but this came out really good!

I tweeked the recipe a bit: I don't care too much for kidney beans so I sub'd pinto beans and instead of kielbasa I used andoullie sausage.
Turned the heat up with cayenne and cajun seasoning.
Turned out excellent (critique from my crew)! Had some for breakfast the next day and it tasted even better.
I am definitely making this again but will have to dial the heat down as I am the only one at home that likes it kicked-up!
Keep cooking and always do it with an opened mind and open mouth.
Peace y'all

Beans and Rice are seldom served around here for a reason I do not know.   So, thought I would try this.    I did not use turkey kielbasas becuz  I couldn't find it, so more of a mixture of pork, turkey and beef I believe.   It was not spicy.   After reading the others reviews, I only put about a cup of the tomatoes in to create some juice.   Also, added some southern Tony's which always creates a great flavor.  It turned out very well and such an easy dish to make especially with the peppers and onions and tomatoes right from the garden.

I made this with Yves Mediterranean Harissa Veggie Sausages (spicy),  2 tsp. Club House Cajun seasonings  and 1/8th tsp. Frankâ€™s Red Hot Sauce instead of Italian Seasoning..  It made enough for 4 people and was spicy delicious!  Served it with Seeds of Change Brown Rice & Quinoa with Garlic for a garlicky great meal.

I used jalapeno peppers instead of a green pepper because I didn't have a green pepper. That added a little zing that would not have been there otherwise. I used Tofurkey slices instead of kielbasa, but found they didn't add anything until a few days later when they had a chance to absorb the flavors. The red beans and rice would be fine without kielbasa and without Tofurkey. They would be fine on their own.

Made this for dinner.  The only change I made was I used the package of rice that cooks in 90 seconds in the microwave.  
This was easy and delicious.  Will definitely make again.

Great reheated as a leftover too!

This one was good...quite simple, flavourful, and quck to make.  Doubled the recipe and made a couple changes.  28 oz of tomato puree and 28 oz of diced tomatoes.  16 oz can of no salt kidney and no salt Black beans.  I added 2 heaping tablespoons  cajun spice (from this site) to the rice while it cooked.  I used Costco Sausages because its all I had on hand...5 of them.  Fresh mushrooms too.  Twas a big hit...thanks!

I used red and yellow peppers and added 1/8 tsp of cayenne pepper. My son and I enjoyed it very much. Excellent recipe.

It was delicious.  I used Turkey, Beef, and smoked Beef kielbasa.  I used petite diced tomatoes.  Served over rice  with collard greens and cornbread.  I will definitely be making again.

I enjoyed this easy meal.  I did not add the sausage and added some diced celery and cajan seasoning.  Will certainly make it again.

This is called Easy beans and rice, and it is!  Itâ€™s really tasty too!  We like  it very much.  This last time I made it, I had forgotten to pick up bell pepper, so I used a small can of Ortega diced green peppers.  That was really good too.  Thanks for the recipe!  Itâ€™s a keeper

We also like it with  andouille sausage.  It is always popular for tailgating, as it is easy to double or triple the recipe.  Yum!

I made it with a few changes:
Cannellini beans instead of red kidney beans
1/2 jalapeno (seeded)
Tony's Creole Seasoning (dash) 
No tomatoes were used
It was very good! Next time I will substitute andouille sausage instead

I made it as written except I used one can of red kidney beans and one can of Bushâ€™s Chili Beans, and it turned out good and was spicy enough. Hubby liked it a lot. Easy way to use sausage for a meal.

Good recipe! The only change I made was I threw in a couple of jalapenos from the garden. As others have said, this isn't really southern red beans & rice so our family calls it "Gumbolaya"

I replaced the sausage with 93% lean ground beef. We've never been big fans of sausage and only use it sparingly. My family absolutely loved my version. I also use freshly shredded medium Cheddar cheese as a garnish.

Have made several times.  I add about 1/2 cup chicken broth to make more liquid that can soak into rice.  I also use andouille sausage.  Easy recipe but good.

This was a descent dish. Easy to prepare. I also used the turkey kielbasa. Which gave it some flavour.  I would probably make it again.

This is decidedly not authentic. However, I chose this recipe because it was easy and called for ingredients I already had on hand. I rinsed my beans first. I deglazed the pan with  red blend wine after adding the veggies, I used 1/4 tsp ground cayenne and 1/4 tsp ground red pepper as well as a good dose of freshly ground black pepper, then added about 1/4 tsp cocoa powder for extra smokiness. Very tasty!

Love this easy recipe.  I let my preschooler choose the bell pepper color. It's also a great recipe to substitute almost any of the ingredients. I use whatever kind of canned tomato I have on hand (normally diced), and sometimes skip the onion and tomato and throw in a can of Rotel (if we're feeling like extra spicy).

Made the recipe as listed but used actual andouille sausage. Also added a generous pinch of cayanne pepper and about a 1/2 tsp of adobo paste. Also smashed the beans and veggies a little bit before adding the sausage back in. Also, the longer you let it simmer, the better it gets. Good recipe, will make it again. Now where's my omeprazole?

Five stars for how Easy and Fast and the fact items on hand.  Made exactly like recipe above--only added 1 extra garlic clove.    Not a ton of flavor.   Kind of on the bland side for husband.  I liked it ok.  If I make it again I would add more onions  - a couple more cloves of garlic - maybe a smidge of hot sauce or Cajun seasoning  and maybe cook the tomatoes down some to have some sauce to mix in the rice.   I don't know what all I would do until I made it again but as is-needs a little "something".

This recipe is really flavorful and a nice easy quick meal for a weeknight.  I used mild Italian sausage, but that was what I found at the store.  Turned out really good!  It's makes a nice leftover as well.  Definitely a keeper.

Personal tweaks: add cumin and file (a common Cajun seasoning and pronounced as fee-lay) powder to taste, a few stalks chopped celery, 1 - 2 fresh jalapeno peppers (seeds and white removed) finely diced.  And why use canned whole tomato's if you're going to chop them.  Get diced tomato's instead.  This is a regular part of my dinner repertoire otherwise I get requests for it.

I loved this dish! I changed it up a bit though; I swapped andouille sausage for kielbasa and swapped celery for bell pepper because I'm not a big fan of it. I also used 3 cloves of garlic instead of one, and only used 1 can of beans instead of two. From reading other comments I realize that tomatoes aren't part of the authentic recipe, but I love them, so I left them in and I think they added a great element to the dish. I also felt that it was even better as leftovers the day after! Yum!

Easy and good, as other posters suggested I added 1/8 tsp. of cayenne. Everyone enjoyed, will make again.  Very easy to make  a vegan version too.

This was a really good and easy recipe, especially for a rainy day.  Doubled the recipe (beans and sausage) and used what I had on hand including a can of Rotel for the tomatoes, and vegetable broth for the water.  Used minced onion, and omitted the celery.  Added the garlic and oregano, as well as two bay leaves and Weber N'Orleans Cajun Seasoning.  Family, including three teenagers, husband and myself ate it up in one evening.  Will definitely make it again.

MY husband and I were at our beach condo and made this for ballgame day. We did not have oregano in the pantry so we used what we had, seasoned salt and red pepper. Everyone loved it. Great heated up the next day!

It was a tasty and fast dish to cook up.  You can cook up as is (which I did this time) or modify for what you have on hand.  It was a quick and easy dish.  I can also see this recipe as a basis for more embellishments and changes.  Definitely will make again.

This was really good and very simple for a weeknight meal. I used a can of "fire-roasted" diced tomatoes, and added some garlic powder, onion powder, paprika and cayenne in with the seasonings.  I also threw in a couple shakes of Louisiana hot sauce, because, why not? Will definitely make again.

this is a great base recipe for red beans and rice. I added a little more ingredients after reading reviews. 

I add:
1 pound of bacon (hubby loves bacon)
1 can of Rotel (mild)
2 cans of diced tomatoes flavored cilantro and onion (instead of the 1 can of whole tomatoes diced)
1/2 red bell pepper
1/2 green bell pepper
1/2 yellow bell pepper
(I like seeing different colors in my food)
and a couple of bay leaves 

I add the bay leaves last and let it simmer for a couple of minutes I take this to family events and I never come home with leftovers :)

This is an awesome base recipe.  I used a can of diced tomatoes with green chiles instead of whole peeled tomatoes and added cayenne, creole seasoning, and a few other spices to jazz it up.  It was very easy and was a great weeknight meal.  Thanks for sharing!

This was definitely an easy recipe and quite tasty! We live in Texas, so we are not far from Louisiana, but still trying to figure out the difference between Cajun and CrÃ©ole styles of cooking.  It seems that everyone that I ask in Louisiana has a different answer? I think the authentic red beans and rice has a ham hoc that is boiled for many hours. Although incredibly delicious, the real thing can put some pounds on you!  I like this version, because it is healthier. I also used brown rice. Tony Chachere's CrÃ©ole Seasoning is a must, so I used that instead of the oregano and salt.  Louisiana Hot sauce on top completes the flavor profile. We like more rice, so we will do that next time.  I also used a frozen Mirepoix Cajun style blend of onions, green bell pepper, and celery. This made it even faster because I didn't have to cut anything up. Great recipe!  Thanks for sharing.

I followed the recipe almost exactly, as I included a few helpful suggestions from other reviewers -- easy and FANTASTIC!  1. Increased garlic to 3 teaspoons (minced).  2. Used one 15-oz. can diced tomatoes with green chilies instead of chopping a can of whole tomatoes.  3. Added 1-2 teaspoons Tony's Creole Seasoning; this stuff's salty so use accordingly.  4. Added three bay leaves at the start of the simmer.  I'm not the fastest chef, but I can get this recipe done and on the table in under 45 minutes.  Soooo good!

We eat this once every 10 days. It is so quick and easy and delicious. I use Italian style diced tomatoes and it is LOVE! We have a VERY picky 6 year old and it is easy to give him a modified version of this meal without making him something "special" which I don't do. I simply remove his serving of sausages before I add the onions, peppers, garlic, etc. and serve him plain rice. One of the few fuss free family meals we eat.

I added some chopped squash cause I have to sneak as much vegies as I can into my food.  I also used regular kilbasa.  My hubby can't eat high spice food so we really liked this.  I have to say I used the Hunts chopped tomatoes with oregano and garlic so I think the added flavor really made it over the top!  It was super yummy!

I've made this before and I love it. I used to get zatarans version every now and then for an easy dinner, but I wanted to try something more homemade, but with minimal ingredients. The only thing different I did was only use 1 can of beans, and I added a cajun seasoning blend in place of salt and pepper. Putting the ingredients on my shopping list to make again this week.

My family liked this meal, and it got all eaten up!  I added a little Cajun seasoning and used crushed tomatoes and regular smoked sausage.  I made instant rice in the microwave.  Easy and tasty!

We really liked this! It may not be authentic, but it tastes good, and that's the important part to us! We used one can of chili beans (not rinsed), and a can of kidney beans (rinsed). A lot of the flavor probably came from that can of chili beans though, so 4 stars.

This was wonderful. So much better than the boxed stuff I usually buy. I used half and onion & half a red pepper (both leftover in the fridge) and one can of small beans and I eyeballed the tomatoes since I only had a 28oz can, but left everything else the same. This will now be my go to recipe from now on...However DBF said that it was lacking something...what that something is, neither of us could figure out...I'll make this again and tweak it here and there!!

Good flavor, very easy, fairly quick, hard to screw up. I'm from Texas, so I can't say much about "traditional" red beans and rice. Even if this recipe doesn't pass muster for traditional, it was pretty good! I would advise spicing it up a bit (Tobasco is your friend), and I thought more rice was in order.

This one was just ok for us.  I thought it only needed 1 can of beans, but I discovered it to late.  I actually had to add another can of tomatoes because it would have been way to dry.  It also needed a lot more spice IMO.  With some tweaks this could be a good recipe, but as written there are some minor problems.

I added a couple teaspoons of Penzey's Cajun seasoning instead of the herbs/spices in the recipe, and that gave it a nice kick.  Cooking with the lid of was evaporating all the liquid, so I put the lid back on the pan for most of the cooking time, took it off the last 5 minutes or so.  To allow for the tomatoes in a recipe that shouldn't have them, I told my family this was Yankee Red Beans and Rice.  The leftovers had almost no liquid, but better flavor than the 1st day.

I thought this recipe was great.  I did make a couple MINOR changes.  First, I boiled the sausage, whole, in about 1/2" of water until it was ALMOST done.  Then I sliced it.      I omitted the green pepper and used garlic powder.  I added a dash of beef bouillon powder.   I strained the tomatoesâ€¦but did not strain the beans, as I wanted the dish to taste more like beans than tomatoes.  I brought it all to a boil, and added a little bit of water to give it more of a sauce, then let it simmer until the sauce was the thickness I wanted.  I also added red pepper, as my family likes things spicy.  It turned out wonderful!  My husband is loves beans, but is really picky about the way they're cooked.  Iâ€™ve tried several different recipesâ€¦and he hasnâ€™t liked any of them.  Until this one.  He absolutely loved it, and has requested it twice more already!    Iâ€™ll definitely be making this many more times.

I made this as is except that I added a lot more spices: garlic powder, onion powder and Tony's saltless seasoning.  It was pretty good and I enjoyed it over rice but it was not like red beans and rice I have ever had before.  But still good though!

As it says it was easy.  I really liked it.  Did add more garlic but I like garlic.  Could not understand why anyone would leave out the tomatoes. Since I live alone I used 1/2 the kiebasa and one can of beans. Give it a try.

We did enjoy this recipe but as others said, it was not the normal spanish beans & rice.  But it is very good when you don't know how to make the "real" thing.  I kept most of the recipe the same, just changed a couple things.  We did turkey kielbasa & used 3 garlic cloves, added a dash of cayenne pepper along with garlic salt & fresh cilantro.  My friend who makes the "real" thing uses cilantro & I think that is what made this recipe have the yummy taste it did, next time I will use even more.  I used diced tomatoes with oregano & garlic in the can.  My 10 year old loved it..my 7 year old didn't like it, he ended up having a PB sandwich!

This is awesome!!!  I wasn't sure if my family would like this, and they loved it!  It is going to become a staple in my family!  I only made a couple changes.  I omitted the tomatoes, and added maybe an 1/8 to 1/4 Texas Pete hot sauce, also added several generous dashes of a store bought Cajun seasoning mix.  It was spicy!  But so good!  If you want to add a little more color, (as I did) add yellow peppers instead of green, it looks nice. Thanks for the recipe!!!

This was great with the addition of a little cayenne pepper and some celery.  I have had traditional red beans and rice, and while this is not the same, it is still really, really good for what it is. Just add some additional spices if you like it spicy!  Even my boy loved it, although he has seen me eat red beans and rice at cajun restaurants and declared it looked "disgusting."

I recommend that you use a little olive oil (1 tbs). This recipe in my opinion does not need tomatoes and green peppers. Let rice and beans be rice and beans.

I can agree this was an easy recipe.I followed the recipe.  But it lacked something.I just didnt taste like the red beans and rice with sausage I am used to.So I rated it a 4 instead of five.Maybe I will change the type of sausage next time and see how it comes out.

Good but bland.  I added a couple shakes of Creole seasoning, but it still wasn't flavorful enough for me.  I think something is lost in the "Easy."

This was very easy to make and we loved the taste. I pureed the tomatoes in a blender because some family members don't like chunks of tomatoes. That is the only change I made. Great recipe. Thanks!

A bit bland but added cajun spice which was nice.  Next time, instead of diced tomatoes I'm going to try using a medium salsa to add more flavor.

I used this recipe as an outline for my beans and rice meal and it worked well.  I made the rice with some leftover broth.  Also, I added some extra black beans plus triple garlic, a jalapeno and red pepper flakes.  I do like my food hot, but it wasn't over powering for the dish.

Delicious recipe! I would suggest cooking the beans alone until they become very soft. This made better consistency for my dish. I also used smoked cured ham in place of sausage.

I scaled the recipe to 4 servings but used one regular-sized can of tomatoes. I upped the amount of garlic, and threw in some red pepper flakes for a bit of a kick. Great comfort food. Thanks, Paula!

Wow!  This really tastes flavorful and authentic and is so easy!  I didn't even have the onion or the pepper and it was still good.  I used a can of tomatoes that already had onions, peppers and celery in it, and it turned out just fine. And I used the larger can of tomatoes instead of the smaller one.  It was so yummy!

What I love about this recipe is how quick and easy it is to make and it comes out very tasty. I used a can of ro-tel instead of tomatoes for a little spice.

I read other reviews, and here is my take:
I used some chicken broth to fix the rice.  I added Cajun Seasoning for flavor, and added shrimp, that had been shelled and rinced, about the last 10 minutes to allow it to turn pink and done.  Also, if using brown rice, add more water and allow more time.  I will be fixing this twice a month after this.

I have made this for years, from the first time the recipe was excellent..I'm sure over the years I have varied from the original (I mix it all together and add Tony's and Frank's) but it was great right from the start.  I use turkey sausage.  I used it while on weight watchers, and even when I was vegan (no meat).  It's and all around fantastic recipe!

i used the recipe to the t and we all liked it but it had more of a chili taste to me than that of red beans and rice. It was still very good and we will have it again.

I've never had "authentic" red beans and rice, but I do like this version.  Simple, quick and tasty, a winner with me.  Also, I've never been a big fan of turkey kielbasa, but it works wonderfully in this recipe.

I thought this was a good, solid recipe.  I didn't have two cans of beans, so I subbed a can of corn.  I would have liked more tomatoes and a little more heat, but the latter can easily be added.  All in all, a solid dish that can be tailored to your tastebuds.

I followed the recipe exactly and although it was good and my hubby and I ate it, it wasn't the best. We will eat the leftovers for lunch tomorrow because we don't waste food, but it was just ok. There wasn't really any sauce for the bean, sausage and onion pepper mixture, it was just kind of sitting on top of the rice with a little tomato juice in the bottom of the bowl. I'm from the south and this isn't what red beans and rice is supposed to taste like. I've never made red beans and rice so I've ben looking for a good recipe. I've been cooking for over 10 years and I follow recipes all the time with fantastic results and so I really don't think it was something I did. If you want a vegetable/sausage/bean   over rice meal, then this fits the bill. But if you want real red beans and rice, look somewhere else.

Good base recipe. I added basil, cumin, celery seed, and Cajun seasoning in addition to the oregano. I also used diced tomatoes & jalapeÃ±os. My husband, who doesn't much care for red beans & rice, said it was the best he'd ever had.

Cooked up easy enough, but if I hadn't added the Zatarain's it would have been as bland as heck. Even after that it just wasn't very good. Ended up throwing most of it out, which was disappointing.

With a little extra flavoring this recipe was very good. I used more oregano, some basil, and a little celery salt. I used tomato sauce instead of whole tomatoes (my boyfriend doesn't like them). Instead of turkey, I put in some lime, tequila, black bean chicken sausage from my local health food store, and it was very tasty. I also sprinkled some cheese on top before serving. I will be making this recipe again.

Good stuff!  I like my sausage a little more browned, so did so over med-hi heat, not low as stated in recipe, until we had a good sizzle going.  Added 1/2t of cumin, a dash of thyme, some Red Hot sauce, and some dried chile pepper to give it some kick.  Next time, I will just add the water and cook the rice right in the same pot.  We enjoyed this very much.

Fantastic! Easy and surprisingly delicious.  Instead of using plain tomatoes and adding oregano and garlic, I use the tomatoes with oregano, basil and garlic - just as good and even easier.  Awesome!

This is a keeper! I added lots of extra garlic, used a can of diced tomatoes, and served it over brown rice. Very good and very easy.

I just tried this recipe today.  I think its a great recipe although a little bland.  I added a little Zatarain's creole seasoning, garlic powder, 2 cans of pinto beans (all I had on hand), hot sauce  and dash of sugar.  All in all, its very tasty & will make this again.  Super easy.

This was really good, but a little bland.  Was better the next day as leftovers when flavors had blended.  Not sure what spices I  might add next time.  I couldn't find turkey kielbasa, but used the regular kind.

This was pretty good. I have made it a couple of times, and I really like the flavor of the turkey kielbasa. I like to add some cumin, because the flavor alone isn't much. You should play around with different spices to suit your tastes.

This is yummy and easy to make.  I doubt that I will ever buy beans and rice in a box from the grocer again.

Pretty good, lacked a little kick.  Made it with turkey sausage and didn't really care for its texture.

This recipe lives up to it's name of being easy and quick. It was mild enough for my child to eat while my husband just added a dash of hot sauce for his tastes. I used diced tomatoes instead of whole ones to save time and I threw in some chopped celery with other veggies. I will make this again.

being a soputhern gal i have had red beans & rice  about a million times but i have never made it.. this recipe is very easy. i did  few things different tho. i omitted the tomatoes all together. i had no bell pepper, so i rooted around in my fridge and found two 1/2 full jars of ortega cooking sauces. one was onions & garlic , the other was tomatillias & jalpenos. i added them and it gave it a kick. i also put a littel crystal hot sauce and some tony chacheres in it.. not bad for a quick fix

Really good.  I used chorizo sausage.  I didn't use the tomato at all, but I did have a heavy hand with the hot sauce (I prefer Cholula).  I did sprinkle it with a little bit of Cajun seasoning and also a little bit of Goya Sazon, only because I had it on hand.  It was very good.  Will definitely make again.  Thanks!

I added some favorite variations. This is a great base recipe for canned beans especially for us quick meal cooks! I added sugar and a cup of gravy, no tomato,I also used red pepper and a pan seared prime rib steak I had in the freezer. It tastes great! Havent gotten the childrens opinion yet, but a dash of sugar always does it for them when we have beans.
