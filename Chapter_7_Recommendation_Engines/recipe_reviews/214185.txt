Glad to see that your recipe finally got published, Cindy! I grew up with Mom making something like this when I was little, so this is total comfort food. Sometimes, I'll change the ingredients up and instead of beef broth and milk, I use lemon-lime soda. This is also good with a mixture of Campbell's french onion soup, Campbells beef broth and cream of mushroom soup. I also use fresh mushrooms, whatever I have on hand. If I think of it, sometimes I'll add a few spices, a bay leaf or two. It's really good. This is also very adaptable for the crockpot. Just brown the meat like the recipe states, then layer it in the crockpot with the other ingredients. I like this best over mashed potatoes but my boys like it best over steamed rice.

While this is certainly not a 'fancy' recipe I'm giving it a five because of the ingredient/result ratio.  This is an excellent 'poor man's stroganoff'.  You get the same flavor as using a more expensive meat cut, but the seasoning and the slow simmer allow you to use stew meat and get a tender and flavorful result.  The gravy cooks down beautifully and is nice and beefy without being overly salty.  I used a bit more of the seasonings than was called for (personal taste) and also used an 8 oz package of fresh baby bellas instead of canned mushrooms.  I followed the cooking directions faithfully and this turned out beautifully.  Thanks Cindy!

Cindy, what an awesome recipe!  Made this over the week-end and it was a great hit.  I added some sour cream at the end and served it over egg noodles.  My family loved it.  Thank you so much for the great recipe that will be a regular at my house time and again.

Tons of flavor + easy = 100% awesome! I did mine in the slow cooker. Don't skip the pan frying! It really keeps the juice locked into your stew meat and helps hold the pieces together over the 7-8 hour cooking time (on low).

The meat was very tender, but the sauce was fairly bland. I used more meat than the recipe called for and there was still way too much sauce. The only thing that made this special was that I served it over spaetzle. Sorry, but I won't be making this again.

Ahhh-MaZinG!  Thanx for sharing such a great comfort food recipe.  I simplified by using the crockpot after browning the meat.

This was great! Dh said I need to make it again(which doesn't happen very often). I did add rice into the pot the last twenty minutes of cooking so we had a one pot meal! The beef was fall apart tender and so good! Thanks for a wonderfull easy meal that will frequent our dinner table often!

Comfort food at its best... we really enjoyed this one, but did find it needed a little more flavor.  I used 1.5 lbs of stew meat and like many other reviewers found there was still a lot of sauce/gravy for the amount of meat.  Next time I will only use 2 cups of beef stock.  I also dialed up the flavor a little with some extra black pepper, a little soy sauce, some worcestershire and a little steak sauce.  I simmered uncovered for about 3 hours and the sauce thickened nicely on its own and the meat was nice an tender.  I loved it over egg noodles and served with broccoli.

This was good with a few changes. The gravy was a bit bland but I added some boullion and a lot of pepper and we enjoyed it. I followed the recipe as written other then that but didn't have to thicken up the gravy as it thicken just fine with out the cornstarch and water. It did seem like it was going to be a lot of extra gravy but I took the lid off the pan the last hour and it was perfect. We all enjoyed this.

This was great. I didn't have any mushrooms so I left them out. Next time I think I'm going to try using a homemade soup mix instead of the cream of mushroom but that's just a personal preference of trying to not eat prepackaged food. Thank so much Cindy!

Cindy, really enjoyed your recipe. It was easy and very flavorful. I did not have the exact ingredients for your recipe but pretty close. I had to sub golden mushroom soup for the cream of mushroom and 1% milk for the skim milk. I omitted the mushrooms because Dh does not care for them. I browned the meat and onions in a skilllet and put them in my slow cooker, mixed the rest of the ingredients and poured over meat and onions. Cooked on low for 7 hours. Served over whole wheat noodles. The meat was so tender. Will make this often, not only was it tasty but I can get it going before the grandkids arrive in the morning and just boil the noodles when they leave. Keep your recipes coming Cindy.

After browning the meat & onions in the skillet, I combined everything in the slow cooker (just because I had lots of time to kill). Turned out Delish! Gravy was really wonderful. True comfort food. Thanks, Cindy!

Wow, my kids are slurping this dinner up as I type! Really, really good and hearty. I went pretty much exactly as recipe except only had full fat cream of mushroom soup.  Many people were complaining of blandness but doesn't everyone taste as they go and add accordingly to their own preferences? For my taste I added more salt, pepper and some worchestire sauce. Served over egg noodles.  Had more than enough sauce and I doubled the meat.  Did not need to "thicken" it.
I used a better cut of meat so I only had to simmer it for an hour.  Will be making again!

I made this as written and we thought it was a bit bland in the end. If I could I would give this 4.5 stars. The meat was very tender which was nice. My whole family loved it but I didn't. Next time I will season it up a little better. Otherwise, great winter comfort food.

I too used the altered for the crockpot version and it is fabulous. So easy to get this prepped and then toss it in the crockpot to cook all day (and smell so GOOD all day!). The meat was flavorful and was so tender! I did cut the liquids down since I was cooking it in the crockpot...I used 1 10.75oz can of Mushroom soup, 1 10.75oz can of whole milk and 1 14.5oz can of beef broth + one packet of Beefy Mushroom Lipton mix. The sauce is thick but not glumpy.

This is a really excellent recipe, tastes very much like beef stroganoff.  I didn't change much, just adjusted the seasoning to my family's liking and used non fat Greek yogurt in place of the milk.  I also used olive oil in place of canola, and fresh portabella mushrooms.  I did need a couple of tablespoons of cornstarch at the end to thicken the gravy up.  It was delicious with whole wheat rigatoni (cooked a few minutes extra to make it less dense) and steamed broccoli.  Thanks very much for sharing!

I was very pleased with how tender this meat turned out. I made exactly as stated but dumped it in the slow cooker to finish.  I was not crazy about the flavor of the sauce. Meat tasted fine but the sauce was rather bland. If I make this again, I will up the spices and maybe add some garlic.  There was not a strong beef flavor like I was expecting in the sauce.

My family would give this a four, but I'm going to rate it a 5. It was easy to make and everyone went back for seconds. I did cook it in the crockpot. The gravy might have turned out thicker if I would've cooked it in the skillet.

Yummy!  Made a lot of the sauce though, I followed the recipe with .8 lbs of stew meat (closest in the store to a pound), and it really could've used twice that amount.  Maybe next time I will double the meat, onions and mushrooms to give it more substance.  I did not add the cormstarch, just let it simmer for 2.5 hours.  It looked like a lot of liquid, so I left the lid off, and it really came together at the end.  Even the hubby liked it, and he doesn't really like many beef dishes besides steaks and all.

I've made this twice, the first time exact to the recipe, and it's perfect!  The second time I used venison instead of beef, and because of the cut I reduced the cooking time by 1/3.  I also added 8 oz of frozen peas and carrots at the end and heated through.  Over egg noodles, it's great!

I've never gotten to review a recipe first. I made this several times when it was a personal recipe. It was a big hit with my family. I used a lot less flour the second time and we liked it better with just a light dusting of flour on the meat. Cooked it in a cast iron dutch oven for the three hours. Make more than you think you will need, it will go quickly.

Excellent, fall-apart!  Cooked in cast iron skillet.  Had to turn heat higher than low to maintain simmer.  Added brown rice an hour or so before.  Did not need cornstarch then.  No mushrooms.

My family loved this.  I thought it was pretty good.  I did need to thicken it a bit at the end.  Served over mashed potatoes.  I used about 1.2 pounds of stew beef and it was plenty for 3 of us.  I also used fresh mushrooms (cant remember if it calls for canned or fresh).

Thank you Cindy! Very easy and great flavor! The gravy thickened by itself, no need for cornstarch. After reading reviews I used nearly 2 lbs of meat for a family of 5 and there was still plenty of gravy. My family doesn't care for mushrooms so I left the can of them out. I still used the soup and they never knew! ; )

The cooking method produced tender, flavorful meat. I found the sauce lacking in flavor though, so next time I would adjust the seasonings more to our liking. I would also at least double the meat as it wasn't nearly enough for the sauce, or for six servings.

I made this recipe entirely in my cast iron pot. It turned out great. I browned the meat in the oven on top of the stove and took it out and added a little of the broth and onions, green peppers, and fresh mushrooms. After they had cooked down, I added the meat and the soup/broth/milk mixture back to the pot. I placed the entire thing in my oven at 325 for 2 hours. The gravy thickened up very nicely this way.

Delicious Cindy! Only changes I made were to use fresh mushrooms, garlic and I added fresh parsley.    I subbed soy milk for the skim and soy sour cream  for the can of cream soup.  Will make again and try adding some Merlot for half the beef broth.  Thanks for a nice, easy recipe!

Basically, the recipe was good, tender and tasty. Some concerns though. One, never use canned anything if you can help it. Canned mushrooms was a crime. Why not use fresh...difference is day & night. Two, I was wondering why the poster said serve over mashed potatoes or rice yet the picture was over egg noodles. Finally using beef base is NOT making your own broth. Easy to make beef stock...boil some beef bones with a small onion. Much better tasting. All in all, a good recipe.

I made this for dinner last night. It didn't state how many it fed so I made a double batch. Woww, lots of food. I did add more seasoning than was called for but it turned out amazing. I had a lot of juices, more than I needed, so I put my egg noddles in the pot about a half hour before I wanted to eat. It soaked up just enough of the extra juices and the noodles were infused with the flavor. I also used fresh mushrooms instead of canned, if you have the love of fresh veggies this is the way to go. This dish was a huge hit in my house, including all three of my kids. I will be making this again and again, thanks for the great recipe!!!

Too much liquid in the recipe.
Too much milk, so the sauce broke.
Seasonings are good but need more seasoning salt.  
Generally a waste of time and good food

This recipe was very good.  I followed the directions exactly, but added additional cornstarch to thicken the gravy.  I also didn't have 3 hours to wait for dinner, so I turned up the heat to high for a while until the liquid started to thicken and then added the cornstarch.  Served over mashed potatoes.

I doubled the meat and thought there was still too much liquid.  Flouring the meat made it kind of curdled looking as well.  The flavor was fine, but I'm not sure it was worth the time spent in the oven.

This was easy and excellent.  We made it in the slow cooker. The only change I would make is to use 2 or even 3 pounds of stew meat.  The gravy was excellent, but there wasn't enough meat for our family.

This is perfect! Made this today for dinner and Husband and Kids are still raving past dessert. Sent hubby and daughter to the store this morning for Beef Stew Meat and they "said" they were sold out. Ended up using Boneless Sirloin and it was fantastic. This did cut the cooking time down but it smelled so good we were happy to eat earlier. Only other change was I used fresh sliced button mushrooms. Served over rice this time, which was excellent. Will try Egg Noddles next time and maybe Mashed Potatoes the time after that. This will be a regular around here. Thank you for sharing, Cindy!!

I made this this evening but used pork tenderloin chopped up since I had that in the freezer already. Thats the only change I made & it was delicious! I'll be making this again with beef & maybe even woth diced chicken over noodles. Whoever said it made too much gravy is crazy. If you simmer it with the lid cracked it does condense quite a bit. If you leave the lid on you won't have as much evaporate leaving your gravy thinner. I give my pup some gravy on her food when we have it & you can do the same for your fur babies too if you feel theres too much gravy.

Pretty good. Made one time following recipe, 2nd time this is what I did. Bought a beef roast on sale and made my own beef cubes because it’s cheaper. Cooked in crock pot in about 1 cup beef broth. Cut up medium onion. Cooked on high for few hours til meat was tender then put on low. After meat was tender I then added the cream of mushroom soup and milk to make gravy. I added the garlic powder and pepper. Salt wasn’t needed because of the beef broth and can soup have enough salt to me. Took the lid off to thicken up sauce without adding a thickening agent. Served over egg noodles. Had enough for leftovers

I thought this was pretty good but after I read the reviews, it did need some doctoring.  Nothing big, just some extra black pepper, a few bay leaves, a a tsp of Worcestershire sauce and a splash of red wine made it perfect.  I will definitely make this again.  Thanks for the recipe, Cindy.

Made it as instructed except I added an additional touch of salt, a couple of touches of pepper, and a pinch of Hungarian paprika. Also, if you don't cover it during simmering, it thickens up quite nicely. plus the occasional stir to incorporate the bits in the bottom. I served this over roasted buttercup squash (a mock mashed potato kind of texture) and it was quite good!

My family loved this! I cut up a 3 lb chuck roast, but otherwise followed the recipe ingredients-wise.  Although I used more meat than recipe stated, did not need to double the sauce - there was plenty! I did braise the meat and then cooked in my crockpot on low.  Meat was super tender, and was delicious on rice, but noodles would work too. Thanks for the recipe; will be making this again!

I made this recipe in a Dutch Oven.  I cooked it for the recommended time.  The flavor and the texture of the gravy were excellent.  I did not need to add cornstarch or any thickening ingredients.  However, I felt like the beef, although tender, was a little dry.  Overall, though, it was a great comfort food dinner with my Amish noodles.

I used the  ingredients as described, but instead of canned beef broth, the key to a wonderful dish was taking the suggestion of the author to use a tablespoon of beef paste in 3 cups of warm water. I did the browning in an enameled cast iron Dutch oven, then finished in a 325 degree oven for 2 hours. It was perfectly tender and required no further thickening, therefore no need of the cornstarch mixture. 

The change I would make that would result in the best recipe I have ever tried of this type is this: Leave out the mushroom soup entirely. It will give a more elegant and rich presentation instead of the pale, almost unappetizing one as represented in the original. I served it over rice, but on the second day over wide egg noodles which was much favored by us. This is a dish that will freeze very well.

This was some of the most tender beef I have ever eaten! I used this recipe as a springboard and am only docking a star because as other reviewers have mentioned, the beef almost gets lost in gravy, even after reducing the broth to 2 cups and omitting the cream of mushroom soup. To get the creaminess I wanted, I added the remaining flour mixture to the cooked onions before adding the browned beef & broth. I substituted butter for oil, chicken broth and a splash of Worcestershire sauce for the beef broth, and fresh mushrooms for canned. The gravy was perfection, so I think I'll just increase the beef to 1 1/2 - 2 lbs next time. Thank you, Cindy, for the inspiration!

Loved this! I substituted zucchini and eggplant for the mushrooms since some members of my family don't like them. I used more meat than the recipie called for and I definitely used more than a can's worth of zucchini and eggplant. The amount of sauce worked for me since my family loves to drown rice in the "juice" of whatever else we're eating. One thing I might do differently is add some more seasonings directly to the gravy instead of having them just in the flour mix.

It was easy to prepare and tasty. However I did make some adjustments to the recipe. As a lot of the seasoning is lost in the discarded flour, I added another 3/4 tsp of garlic powder, 1 tsp of black pepper and 1 tbsp of Worchestershire sauce to the mushroom mixture..
The whole family loved it.

I made this for my husband substituting low salt alternatives where possible. It was delicious and I will be making this recipe again.

THis was delicious. Tasted like beef stroganoff .  I was hesitant  about the mushroom soup ,  but it tasted more like sour cream that is usually in strogonoff.  I didn't use canned milk, just  8 oz regular 2% milk .  I had some cooked mushrooms left over and used that instead of canned mush.  I did not find that 3 cups of broth was too much. it came out thick and creamy  without using  cornstarch, maybe because there was so much flour on beef.  I will definitely make this again.  My husband really liked it also.

I was hopeful that this recipe would work for us, but we were disappointed in the lack of flavor. It was served over mashed potatoes and looked very appetizing but just had no flavor even though I had added Worcestershire and cayenne pepper. I am not fond of recipes using canned soup as an ingredient as I find they do not offer much flavor. Thank you for the offering, glad I tried it, but I don't think we will be using this one again.

Recipe was good only change I've made was to add some beef granules to the gravy and more black pepper to the sauce. It turned out very good.

I didn't realize until the end that it needed to cook 3 hours so I put it in the pressure cooker for half an hour and it was fantastic! The meat fell apart. Will definitely make again

ALthough the meat was fork tender, this recipe is good, but lacks flavor.

We loved it. Even my extremely picky husband! He even had left over tips the next day. ( He doesn't like any kind of leftovers). Try it- you will not regret it.

This is comfort food. I tweaked it a bit to our tastes I used bacon fat instead of canola oil for browning the meat. Also since we don't use low fat or non fat anything I used regular cream soup and swapped out the skim milk for half and half. It kind of reminded me of beef stroganoff. I served it over mashed potatoes because that is our preference and had fried corn and onions on the side.

I made this but, I doubled the meat and seasoning. If I would have made one lb of meat my husband would have said that was good snack, now what's for supper? LOL.  I made this with Mashed potatoes and roasted broccoli, it all went well together. I also made some noodles  just in case my husband would want those instead of potatoes. He ate the potatoes instead. Thank you Cindy  for this tasty recipe.

Very good recipe.  One can adjust the spices for personal preference.  I prepare it in a skillet as directed, but put it in the crockpot  to cook all day and serve it over noodles or rice.
