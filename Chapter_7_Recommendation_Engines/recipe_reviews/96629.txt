I lost 70lbs last year and am back to my high school weight but refused to give up lattes!  I made this with non-fat milk and used a battery powered frother and got lots of foam, and it tasted fantastic!  Thanks!

Pretty good!  If you don't have expresso, I recommend using equal amounts of coffee and milk.  (I used a medium roast coffee.)  A half teaspoon of sugar brought out the flavor very nicely.

This is a really good basic recipe for a latte. I added 1/2 tsp of vanilla to the coffee while brewing for a different flavor and found cinnamon works just as well for a different flavor.

Full cream milk is important to get good froth and don't forget to add sugar to taste. I have this every morning except I put it in a bowl and throw my cereal in too...it's a habit acquired from childhood. Yep, soggy hot coffee cereal. My whole family does it! (Even more wicked if you leave out the cereal altogether and instead, throw in a bunch of plain cookies for a good soak and eat it with a spoon. It's dunking en masse)

Hubs does love his espresso (even tho' I'm Italian, I do not!) and he enjoys making it for himself with his little stovetop espresso maker on those rare weekend mornings when he doesn't go into the office and we can linger over breakfast. He also likes trying something new and he had fun making this coffee drink this morning. To froth it, he rapidly twirled the whisk between the palms of his hands.  He enjoyed it (and himself!) and it was certainly a lot cheaper than getting something like this at a coffee house!

I drizzled chocolate syrup in the cup prior to adding the hot espresso and milk.  Just like those expensive chain mocha lattes!

The best way to steam milk for your latte or cappuccino is to use put 1/4 of skim milk (skim bubbles best) in a microwave safe jar with a lid (mason jar).  Shake the milk until you get bubbles..take off the lid and microwave about 30 seconds. That's it!  Foamy steamed milk!

At first when I saw this recipe I kind of laughed as I figured coffee and milk has been around forever. But, then when I read the directions I realized it was for making lattes using a pot of milk and a whisk. I normally just use this tool I have called an Aerolatte to whisk the milk that I heat in the microwave. Out of curiosity I tried this method and I thought it tasted great! I even used a strong brewed coffee, which I normally drink, as making the espresso is time consuming and something I save for the weekend. I will more likely make it like this again as it was so easy to do.

Delicious! I love coffee, so as soon as I saw this recipe I wanted to try it out. It was easy to make and tasted just as good as Starbucks, only it was cheaper! I definitely keep this recipe handy in the kitchen

I have tried this recipe, and its actually not a latte, the correct term for this drink is a Cafe Au Lait', or Cafe Misto. Latte means that you use espresso shots, but if you brew an espresso roast in a coffee pot its still just coffee and not espresso, just the way it was roasted was designed to be used in an espresso machine.

Thank goodness, I have been searching for how to make the Latte without an espresso machine.  Budgeting now and one place to make a difference on weekly spending is going to be Starbucks.  
So Simple I can do it.

Not a huge fan... The coffee and heted milk with vanilla tasted good, but NOT at all like a caffe latte that I was expecting. Next time I will just put milk and sugar with my coffee to get the same effect. Maybe I will try to "whip" the milk more when it is on the heat. It just did not create a foam whatsoever. It was okay, just not a favorite.

This my favorite at home coffee drink. I like to use strong hazelnut coffee and sprinkle a little cinnamon and nutmeg on top.

It never occurred to me until today that, hey - I can do this!  We just bought one of those mini whisks (bsttery powered) that really makes the foam.  I also heated the milk in the microwave and used my french press to make very strong coffee.

Made this with brewed coffee, and did half coffee, half milk. It whisks really nicely, with 1% and whole milk.

This is great. I used 2% milk, and it worked perfectly. As soon as the milk started to heat, it was slightly foaming, and once I started whisking, it made lots of nice foam. So easy! (I didn't have espresso, so I took another reviewer suggestion and used equal parts strong brewed coffee and milk.)

I scaled this down to 1 serving (1/2 cup milk to 1/3 cup espresso). I made the espresso using an entire Starbuck's Via Italian Roast decaf packet to 1/3 cup water and added stevia. After adding the milk and foam, I sprinkled cinnamon on top. A perfectly delicious afternoon treat!

I happened to have whipping cream on hand so I added half whipping cream and half milk and a tablespoon of chocolate chips to make it chocolatey and sprinkled a heavy amount of cinnamon on top - delicious! The whipping cream made it very creamy with sturdy foam. Will definitely make again for a chilly day treat!

Very easy and fast latte! Taste great with a swirl of hersy caramel syrup and a sprinkle of cinnamon.
