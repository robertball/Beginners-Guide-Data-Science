Wonderful side dish that takes so little time to prepare! I used only 1 pint of cherry tomatoes and kept the rest of the ingredients the same. I used a bit of kosher salt and fresh cracked black pepper to season. I love the fresh basil on these. Definitely serve hot off the stove as these cool down quickly. You could add a little shaved Parmesan or feta cheese to this to take it over the top - great with grilled steak or grilled chicken.

I've made this recipe with fresh basil and dried basil.  Dried rates 4 stars, so try your hardest to get fresh!  A fast, tasty side to Baby Spinach Omelet.  I didn't have any problems with tough grape tomato skins, but I did pierce each with a sharp knife during cooking.  Maybe this helped?

Made this for my husband and he really enjoyed eating them this way!    I sprinkled a little parmesan cheese over the dish. A great way to serve cherry tomatoes! Thanks! A keeper!

Cook at last moment when preparing dinner so you can get them right to the table when they're ready; they cool quickly and when that happens the texture fails.   Great dish, though!

Quick, fresh and delicious! I used a bag of grape tomatoes, garlic and fresh minced basil. I added Hawaiian sea salt and fresh ground black pepper while the tomatoes were sauteeing, shaking the pan frequently. In mere minutes they were done. I really like how the sweet juices of the tomatoes bursts in my mouth along with the sauteed garlic and fresh basil. Oooh what a wonderful blend of fresh flavors! The sprinkles of fresh basil over the tomatoes stand out-very pretty. This is a terrific side dish and a good way to use up grape tomatoes. One that I will keep in mind for use again in the future.  I served this along with, "Portuguese Pork with Red Peppers," "Lemon-Sesame Asparagus," and "Parsley Red Potatoes," all from this website.

These are good- I really enjoyed the flavor sauteeing brought to the tomatoes.  I used on-the-vine cherry tomatoes.  Just make sure your tomatoes are completely dry before adding to the pan- I guess mine were still a little wet from rinsing and it wasn't pretty.  But I just covered the pan to solve that problem.

I loved this! The skins were a little bit annoying, but the flavor is just so delicious! I let is sit for a while to cool down, and had it on top of a toasted English muffin. Would be great topped with cheese, and broiled, bruscetta style. Thanks!

Obviously a subjective thing - I really could take or leave these and much prefer tomatoes uncooked. I don't regret trying something different but once was enough for me.   Maybe it's those stewed tomatoes Mom served us as kids....

I cut each tomato in half first.  For a super quick dinner, I serve this over boxed rice pilaf or couscous, and add a grilled chicken breast.

I have done something similar to this for years, but use 1 T butter & 1 T olive oil, 1 T dill weed (fresh is best), & saute` mushrooms first, then add thinly sliced zucchini, the tomatoes last & finish with a splash of fresh lemon juice.. Green veggies covered & it is so wonderful, quick & easy. I slice the cherry or grape tomatoes in half & just get them hot - not really cooking, it makes them mushy. Sooo good!

Can you say delicious!??  I made this recipe using grape tomatoes and since I was short on time I used garlic powder instead of minced garlic cloves.  I added a little salt and pepper and a little onion powder.  I cut my grape tomatoes in half and sauteed them in the olive oil.  I didn't have any fresh basil so I didn't stir in basil or extra olive oil, I just ate them straight from the pan and they were delicious!  I ate them with a sauteed chicken breast that I cooked in the same pan.  I can't wait to try them again with the fresh basil.  Thank you for a wonderul and healthy recipe!

These are a tasty and simple way to use up cherry or grape tomatoes. I used extra basil after I sampled them, but that was just my preference. Great recipe. Thanks!

Everyone seemed to enjoy this.  I just received them in my bountiful basket and needed to find a recipe to make them.  I'm giving this 5 stars because I thought it was good.  I'm not a tomato fan, so for me to even like them a little makes it a 5 star :)

This is an excellent side dish. Make sure you use FRESH basil or you get an entirely different taste. To me it's just not as good. Cherry tomatoes are much sweeter in taste than grape tomatoes. So choose your tomatoes for the taste you would like to achieve.

How can you go wrong with tomato, basil and garlic?  This was really delicious - my mother especially loved it, but I did find that I needed to increase the garlic (I slivered mine) and basil to get it well enough seasoned.  Did you notice that the grape tomato skins were a little tough after sauteeing?  You know, they kind of slip off and are hard to chew.  Not "very" hard to chew, but I noticed it.  (btw, these were great at room temp after sitting on the buffet)  I've wanted to try this with grape tomatoes for quite some time.  Thanks for posting the recipe and reminder.

This was a perfect veggie side to the dinner I cooked. It was quick and easy, and tasted wonderful. I added sliced zucchini to mine, along with fresh basil and garlic. Next time I may include sliced onion.

I actually cut the cherry tomatoes in half...then when they are almost soft - squish with a fork - be careful cause they squirt...then service with fresh pasta, like a linguine.

Very good! I made this with my 10 year old brother (I'm 16) this afternoon using some sweet yellow cherry tomatoes from our garden. I then topped some rice with the sauteed tomatoes; it was so good. I added cilantro while we sauteed. Thank you~

Fast and easy (be a bit careful, as it set off smoke alarm even with down draft vent going full).  Followed recipe exactly, but added some half spinach leaves at the end for a bit of color.  Recipe requested by all at our dinner.

These were just ok...nothing special.  Made with dried basil instead of fresh.

Very yummy and easy!  I cooked mine about 10 minutes because I like the tomatoes soft.  Will make again.

this sounds awesome and smells great but my father, boyfriend and i all were not crazy about this.. i wanted something different than the traditional veggie side dish so i decided to try this one--more than likely will not try again. maybe our taste is different than everyone else's since this got such great reviews.

This was just ok. My daughter, who loves cherry tomatoes, did not like this. I found the skins to be too tough to eat. The flavors were nice though.

I loved this! Sauteeing really intensifies the tomato taste, which means it's good even with bland winter tomatoes. I love that you get the great flavor quickly by sauteing instead of roasting. I added a splash of balsamic vinegar and a handful of kalamata olives for a delicious sweet-and-salty combination. A definite keeper!

I really wanted to love these because I have a prolific supply of cherry tomtoes growing along my front walk (so kids can munch on them when they walk up to the house), but...we just didn't care for them. We love tomatoes, and garlic, and basil...and I love tomato slices broiled with basil, garlic powder and cheese, but I won't make these again. I hate to give bad reviews...sorry.

I was so glad to see this recipe...I've been making sauteed tomatoes for a long time & was about to submit the recipe!  I always use grape tomatoes, a TON of garlic, & always fresh basil!  Tomatoes, basil, & garlic is one of my favorite combinations!

This was delicious.  I used it as a "sauce" for bow tie pasta.  Because I love garlic, I added an additional clove, and also added just a splash of balsamic vinegar.  Also used grape tomatoes instead of cherry tomatoes.

I used grape tomatoes and combined the dish with a couple of small coursely cut zucchini.  Even my daughter loved it.  Simple and easy.  Great if you love garlic and basil.  A nice change to every day veggies.

A different twist to use up all of the cherry tomatoes from my garden. I made these exactly as written which took no time at all. The fresh basil on top is definitely key! Next  time I am going to add some grated parmigiana cheese or feta on top. My husband did not care for the texture of the skins after they were cooked.

Tasty and SO  quick, though I did find that I needed to sauté on a lower heat setting.  I actually forgot the salt and pepper but sprinkled some Parmesan on top so it turned out well anyway.  I used freeze-dried, jarred basil.

What a quick and DELICIOUS side dish! I used butter instead of oil and cut the cherry tomatoes in half. Compliments from all. Will be making over and over.

I do not know how to cook very well, and I even manage to screw up recipes. But this recipe was delicious! I needed something inexpensive to take to a holiday potluck. Everybody loved it - even self-described tomato-haters.   I used frozen basil cubes instead of fresh basil.

I omitted the last tablespoon of oil at the end; it didn't need it.  This was quick, simple and easy.  I would make again and again. :)

The tomatoes turned out to be a pretty good side dish. I think next time, I will roast them in the oven with some crushed garlic and add the basil at the end. But this was a fast, easy alternative.

Great way to use the overabundance of cherry tomatoes. Will make again.
