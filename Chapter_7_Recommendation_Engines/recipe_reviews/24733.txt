We love this recipe. Always keep some in the fridge.  It is great as a dip but also as a dressing in souvlaki pitas (instead of tzatziki) or on burgers.

We use 1/2 cup of mayo instead of the full cup and add 1/2 cup of yogurt (total of 1 1/2 cups of yogurt).  We prefer the consistency and the flavours stand out more with yogurt than mayo.

Yum!  Huge hit!  I used fat free yogurt, 1 10-oz package of extremely well-thawed and well-drained frozen spinach that I ran the knife through just to make sure there weren't any big pieces, 1 tsp of Italian seasoning instead of opening 3 separate containers for oregano, basil and parsley, garlic powder instead of garlic salt and Old Bay instead of Lawry's seasoning salt (what I had on hand).  Delicious and not too salty for us...because of the Old Bay??

This is tasty and nutritious.  Can't beat that.  I used low-fat yogurt and mayo.  I accidentally changed the spice measurement from 1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon and I'm glad I did.  I added onion powder and used garlic powder instead of garlic salt.  I used one teaspoon of season salt to cut back on the salt and it was still pretty noticeable.  I added a heaping 1/4 teaspoon of crushed red pepper that really was great with it but it still could have used some water-chestnuts.  I used about a cup of left-over steamed spinach and could have used more.  Over all, very good stuff though.  It's good to know that yogurt can be used in place of its less nutritious counterparts.

So easy and delicious!  This tastes creamy and bright without the bitter taste you get with the frozen spinach type dips.  I used baby spinach leaves, and and used non-fat yogurt.  It's just really really good!

Super Bowl Sunday and I had a box of frozen spinach & took to the all recipes! Took everyones reviews into consideration on this recipe - cut way back on the mayo & added little sour cream - cut back on the seasoning salt & picked up differnce with the Old Bay, went with the fronzen spinach because had that on hand. Last went light on garlic powder in place of the garlic salt. Also added little ground pepper & a little grated Parmesan. With everyones helpful reviews - I think this creation is worth 5 stars! Will be a yummy hit at the big game!

I don't usually like plain yogurt, but this was a good use for it! I omitted all of the salt because people said it was too salty, added (1/3 cup?) shredded parmesan cheese and diced onions, and used around 3 cups of fresh chopped spinach instead of 1. Served with Hawaiian bread for the sweet contrast! Will use again.

This was a great recipe. I made a double batch for a cookout and people loved it. I did do less mayo and more yogurt, but I also added artichoke hearts and chopped water chestnuts. Also instead of the herbs suggested, I added a pack of onion soup mix...Yummy!

Good flavor, but DO NOT make this in a food processor.  It becomes too watery.  I'm not sure how I'll thicken this up...
EDIT - added a small container of sour cream to thicken, and it definitely helped -- both with flavor and consistency.  I hadn't realized before just how salty this was by the recipe.  Much better now.

Way too much salt. After I doubled the recipe without adding the seasoning salt and garlic salt, it was perfect.

Honestly, I would have given this 2 stars, but some of my guy friends liked it (but they think frozen pizza is a gourmet dinner, soooo....).  The only changes I made were to omit the mustard, used garlic powder instead of garlic salt, and used frozen spinach.  The recipe was so runny & mostly tasted like seasoning salt.  :(

I thought this dip was much too salty.  However, it had a delicious flavor.  I would recommend cutting down on the seasoning salt and maybe using garlic powder instead of garlic salt.

This was great and easy!  I used Miracle Whip instead of mayo, and I will definitely use mayo next time.  Using fresh spinach is the way to go with this recipe. If you're serving a large group, I'd double the recipe, it goes fast! Thanks!

Yummy! Didn't have dry mustard so used 1/4 tsp spicy brown mustard, also used lo-fat mayo. Put it in my bullet so it was a dressing. Hand stir for thicker dip.

The yogurt made the dip too sour. This review may not be fair since I didn't follow the original recipe. I followed the recipe posted by library lady, which looked very interesting but turned out to be a mistake - too many different flavors - Italian Seasoning, Old Bay seasoning... None of the family liked the dip. I will continue to look for a spinach dip recipe that can equal or rival the one I buy from Treasure Island food store which everyone loves.

This was pretty good.  Made and served with Hawaiian bread.  There's something missing in it...I think it needs a bit of a kick but I'll definitely make this before I ever buy that chemical tasting stuff in the store! I might add some cayenne next time.  Just a pinch.

The worst recipe I've tried so far. No redeeming factors whatsoever. Used garlic instead of garlic salt & still WAAAAAY too salty. Sorry, but I followed everything to a "T", but no good.

So yummy! I followed the advice of other reviewers and did 1 1/2 cups of yogurt and 1/2 cup mayo, and I cut the seasoning salt in half (so just added 1 tsp).  It turned out great!

I think this is quick, easy and refreshing. I reduced the mayo by half and upped the yogurt by half. Also, I used salt substitute allowing the salt from chips to be the salty. Mine seemed as though it could handle more spinach, so I added more than the one cup. But with fresh spinach how does one measure 1 cup? Anyway, this is a refreshing take on spinach dip; I think it does lend itself to topping hot meat sandwiches or stuffed pitas. For winter I might go with a hot cheesy recipe. This, though, chilled is refreshing, and since yogurt and mayo are used and low fat versions are available, it can be made with an eye on fat. So, not the richest tasting, but simple, quick, tasty.

We all loved it. I added a whole bag of spinach and used greek joghurt and only half the mayo. I choose to make it creamy with my hand blender and left only a few bigger spinach pieces, so it is easier to eat.

In order to keep this from becoming too "liquidy" I buy my yogurt (nonfat) a few days ahead of time and drain it in the refrigerator through a cheesecloth lined strainer over another bowl. This will yield about 1/3 less yogurt but it then has the consistency of soft cream cheese. I also use 1 1/2 cups yogurt and 1/2 cup mayo rather than 50/50.

Best healthy dip ever!!! I really enjoy the fresh flavors and the nutritious component of this recipe. I used 3 cups of spinach instead, used nonfat plain yogurt, 1/2 cup of reduced fat mayonnaise and 1 tsp of dijon mustard, fresh basil along with the dried seasoning suggested. Taste fantastic.

This turned out pretty good.  It doesn't taste exactly like the spinach dips at the store, but it's definitely a lot healthier and pretty good tasting too!  I also cut down the mayo by half a cup and increased the yogurt by half a cup.  I put in all the spinach I had, which was the whole bunch that they sell at the stores in the fresh produce section.

This was pretty gross, which is such a shame because I really wanted it to be good!  I took the suggestion of another reviewer and subed an extra 1/2 cup of yogurt for the mayo, but I think that made it worse.  I also ended up with waaaaay too much "sauce", so I kept throwing spinich in.  I added artichokes, onions, parm, and still it wasn't very tasty :(        It did taste the best when I ate it on bell pepper "chips"

This was allll the rage at my block party.  My brother and his friends almost ate all of it before most of our guests arrived!  I even used FAT FREE yogurt, and no one knew!  I used more spinach for it too, as it seemed you can keep adding and adding. My boyfriend cut up some whole wheat pitas, brushed with olive oil and basil, and viola! Perfect combo. I like it better than any other spinach dip I had, and felt it was a healthier too.

This definitely tastes mayo-y, but it got good reviews from my guests.

A very good, low-calorie spinach dip using fresh spinach.  I had Greek yogurt and low-fat mayonnaise on hand, so that is what I used.  I mixed the dip up the night before and gave it a quick stir before serving.  Nice flavor to go with any vegetables and would be good as a baked potato topper.

I used 500 ml of Oikos low fat yogurt, 1 cup mayonnaise and 3 onion and herb and garlic dip mix from epicure.  1 frozen chopped and fresh about 2 cups.  Made it tonight for tomorrow.

Amazing that this doesn't have oil in it.  I'd say it was comparable to many on the shelves.  I too drained the yogurt in a strainer with a coffee filter, for a few hours, added less of the low fat mayo, dry seasonings, baby spinach and we spread it on a baguette and it was just lovely. I chopped that baby spinach in my Cuisinart, so it doesn't look like the pictured recipe, better!

Used chopped water chestnuts & green onions like usual spinach dip. I also cut down the mayo,(1/2 cup), & used fat free, increasing the yogurt to 1 1/2 c. Using fresh herbs makes it even better, if your wanting to find ways to use up herbs from your garden. Pretty good.

This is a good, healthy alternative to sour cream type spinach dip. It is a little more watery, but this is due to the less fat content. It isn't too watery though. I added artichokes and a little less mayo and it was very tasty :)
