I've tried a couple of different cheesecake receipies and keep coming back to this one. The flour gives the cheesecake a little extra creaminess. Love it!

I made my own crust which added to the prep time but it was still very easy and quick to make.  Also I used fat free cream cheese but the result was still very creamy and tasty.

I made two of these for Thanksgiving dinner, and they absolutely stole the show!  

I used my own crust, rather than using a pre-made one (mostly because I couldn't find a premade one at the supermarket) and that did add to the time, but after that, following the recipe to the letter, they came out beautifully!

They came out so well, that my cousin, whose house I had Thangsgiving dinner at, STOLE one whole cheesecake for herself!  They also told me to make more for Christmas... *sighs* well, here I go, slaving into the kitchen again :)

I really like this recipe. I was great tasting. Only required one egg. It is my favorite cheesecake recipe now.  I never make cheesecake from a box after tasting this recipe. I make it about once a month. It baked perfectly, it held together well while serving. I like it right out of the oven and cold. My family thanks you for this recipe.

Loved it. I used the "2 extra servings" pre-made crust, and it came out just fine. Tastes great with "supreme strawberry topping". will definitely make again.

This was a good cheesecake.  Maybe a little bit dry, not as creamy as I would prefer.  Good taste though and good enough when you need a cheesecake fix!  Also, this was very easy to make.  Didn't need the springform pan and didn't need to mess with a water bath (which always gets me into trouble).

YUM!  I'm not usually a big fan of cheesecake... my boyfriend wanted cherry cheesecake for his birthday instead of the traditional cake, so I tried this recipe and topped it with cherry pie filling and it was a HIT! 
I've only made cheesecake once, and it was the "no-bake" kind... this recipe was easy and wow what a wonderful smooth texture. I've made it twice in one week to satisty my boyfriend's craving!! Thanks for sharing this recipe.
NB: I did remove the cheesecake from the oven 5 minutes before it called for and let it cool, as someone else advised in the reviews, it worked great; no cracks, smoothest texture

This recipe was ok. The flavor was good but it was missing something. Would have been great with a fruit topping. The vanilla flavor was strong so I would omit the 1/2 tbl. for a tsp. This is a very simple dessert.

So good and easy to fix! Mine did crack in the middle but it was just for the family so I didn't mind. This is a lighter cheesecake which is just what I like!

Wonderful cheesecake, everyone in the family thinks this is the best.  Only change I made is that I make my own crust (using the recipe on the Honey Maid Graham Cracker Crumbs box) - and blind-bake it before I fill it with the cheesecake mixture.  Next time I'm going to try using ginger-snap crumbs instead of the graham cracker in the crust, but otherwise, as written this recipe is totally a keeper -- thanks for sharing!

I was a little nervous about this recipe because I hadn't made a baked cheesecake before and was cooking for company, but it turned out amazing...  I used Splenda instead of sugar and I also used some fresh pineapple and made my own topping and everyone raved... I'll be making this again...

I'm impressed.  I changed some quantities - used 3 pkg cream cheese, subbed cream for milk.  Crushed 8 graham crackers, mixed with melted butter for a homemade graham cracker crust.  

Used fat-free cream cheese to make recipe healthier (ha).

I don't know what happened... but this turned out just awful. Maybe because i used 1/3 less fat cream cheese? It looked great, but tasted awful, more specifically, it tasted very egg-y. I'm not sure why.. but the taste of egg was overwhelming. Maybe it will taste better tomorrow because I just baked it today.. but thus far i give this 1 star, sorry!

This was a very good cheesecake!  It was my first time attempting a homemade cheesecake. The only modification I made was to add crumbeled reese's peanut butter cups and carmel to the top right before serving.  My husband accidently got me a 6oz pie crust instead of a 9 oz pie crust so it took almost 55 minutes to bake.

This cheesecake was just ok.  The flavor was good, but the texture was odd...and just not right when it comes to cheesecake.  It was an easy enough recipe though.

This is a delicious and easy cheesecake recipe!  The vanilla gave it a great flavor...it didn't even need any kind of topping.  I used Mexican vanilla but would try clear vanilla next time to keep the beautiful yellow color.

I replaced the milk with kahlua and added about two tablespoons of extra sugar.  Then when it came out of the oven, I thinned a little nutella with cream and spread it over the top!  Topped with crushed nuts!!!  YUM!!!

I love the simplicity of this recipe. I did add a little extra vanilla but other than that I followed it exactly. Next time I would make my own crust. Personally, I really liked the cheesecake, but my husband couldn't stand it. He felt it was too 'cream cheesy'. So definitely will make this again, just not for my hubby. :)

This is probably the best cheesecake I have had!  It's better than the Cheesecake Factory; and that's saying alot b/c that's my favorite restaurant.  I used the shortbread pie crust from Keebler.  Even better than Graham crust.

This was my very first attempt at making a cheesecake and I was very impressed.  I used a graham cracker crust and followed the recipe exactly.  The texture is amazing on this cake.  It is very dense and solid.  I have been searching for a dense cheesecake for my fiancee and finally found it.  Thank you, thank you!!

Passed on presentation, but texture's really bad. It looks good enough to eat but once it's in the mouth, it's rubbery. Yes..that's the word my husband used and what I thought too. Won't try this again.

Thanks you! Really good! Goes well with a cup of coffee or tea, it was easy to make, I liked the texture rather than the creamy cheesecakes, the reason I made this was the addition of flour,  topped with strawberries and glace. Next time I will add some lemon flavoring or pineapple flavoring. I used regular pre-made pie crust, the graham cracker pie crust would have been better.

Does anyone out there have a cheesecake recipe that is more cakelike? I've been searching for a cheesecake like the one Rhea's bakery in PA used to sell, it had the hole in the middle, it must of been baked in the tube pan. Would really appreciate it. Thanks

This recipe is a 5 star with or without my changes. However I still wanted to change it up and I loved it the way I made it. I used 2 scant cups powdered sugar instead of the 3/4 cup granulated sugar. 1/4 cup egg product instead of the egg. Cream instead of milk and a shortbread crust instead of a graham cracker crust. Shortbread crust works well with this cheesecake because its a denser cheesecake due to the flour. Its a nice change from a more typical creamcheese/sour cream cheesecak. its very original due to the addition of flour but still very very good!

I found this recipe about 3 years ago & I continue going back to it. It's simple & has a perfect New York style texture. It's not over sweet & always a crowd pleaser!

I have served this three different times now and each time it received Rave reviews!  Everyone wants the recipes.  It's so easy to make!  I put some strawberries or raspberries in a little fancy dish off to the side of the cheesecake so people can put those on top, if desired.

This recipe was excellent. I don't really care for cheesecake but this was really good. I made it for Easter. Thanks!
