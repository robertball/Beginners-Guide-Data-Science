I've found that you really need to whip the egg whites to a stiff peak to make this work.  I use 1/2 C splenda, and always include a little bit of vanilla to give it more flavor.  If you put the mixture into a pastry bag (or a plastic bag with a cut tip) you can pipe them into shapes.  I made ghosts for halloween with little mini-chocolate chip eyes.  Great for kids' halloween parties.

Just didn't taste good and texture wasn't any better.   I tried again with double the Splenda but it didn't help.  The outer "skin" literally sticks to my teeth.  Will not attempt again.

A fun dessert but quite bland.  You can taste the egg.

To whip the egg whites, they should be room temperature  They will only whip correctly in a glass or metal bowl.

Anytime you whip egg whites add 1/4 teaspoon Cream of Tartar - it stablizes the end product.  To me they tasted better not great, the next day.

These were excellent!  We paired them with CoolWhip Free and no sugar added sliced peaches.  This was an incredible dessert for about 60 calories!  I would recommend to anyone!

These cookies are a big hit when I make them at my parent's house. 

I like to experiment with these cookies and I've found that they are great when you use raspberry flavoring with the vanilla or in place of the vanilla.
My dad likes them the most when I put cocoa in them!

Granted they're not as sweet as a real cookie, they're still a great guiltless snack.
