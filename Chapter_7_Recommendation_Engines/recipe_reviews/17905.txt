I actually haven't tried this recipe yet, I just wanted to know if the submitter could please comment and say what the recipe is for the pastry? This sounds like a recipe my grandmother used to make and when she passed away no one knew how to make this anymore. I would really love to try this recipe.

I use  puff pastry. I buy a package of frozen puff pastry and it works a treat. Also I use brown sugar not white.

I made 2 changes. I omitted the peel  (I don't like it) and I made them smaller so it would make more. They turned out really well.  Just like I remember them growing up. My husband loved them. I would definatly make them again.

Use store bought puff pastry.  I use water to brush the tops before sprinkling with sugar, and make sure you seal them well on the underside.  The sugar in the currant mixture will melt and caramalize and leak out.  Traditionally they have 3 small cuts on the surface.

This pastry is pretty tasty!  I found that I had a lot of filling left over (perhaps I didn't put enough in them?)  I was afraid the currants would be over powering but they weren't.  

I used puff pastry as I don't know what shortdough pastry is.  I will definitely make this one again!  They're great with coffee.
