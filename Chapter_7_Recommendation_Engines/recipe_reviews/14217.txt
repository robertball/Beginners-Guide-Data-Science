I love using lemon yogurt as a dressing for fruit.  However, this combination didn't turn out as well as I would have liked.

This was bland and flavorless. It needs something to spice it up.

This was light and tasty. Just what I was looking for. I added some pears also as I had some ripe. Really nice.
