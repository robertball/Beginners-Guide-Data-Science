I used honey instead of syrup but it was not sweet enough with 1 tablespoon so I added an tablespoon of honey and entire banana to make it sweet enough I also added 2 teaspoons of vanilla. It was delicious this way.

We made these yesterday and they were delicious! My husband thought it was "too eggy" So we used one egg, one whisked egg white, and greek yogurt this time, and man oh man was it a game changer! AMAZING!! We also added vanilla extract, nutmeg, and cinnamon both times we made these!

Good but needs some doctoring.  Add 1/2 tsp baking soda and a dash of lemon juice. This will help create the fluffiness of real wheat pancakes.  Also fluff the almond meal a bit prior to measuring to avoid overly thick batter.  Lastly, I used honey instead of maple syrup.

I substituted whole milk for water, although can use almond and/or coconut milk; and substituted oil with coconut oil. I also substituted coconut/agave sugar in place of the maple syrup. I will add a banana next time to make it a bit sweeter (didn't have any in the house). I added baking soda and baking powder to make the pancakes fluffy, cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger, and cloves. I also added walnut pieces, but you may want to add a smidgen more milk or oil to make the batter a bit less hearty. The walnuts thicken the batter a bit. Definitely a lot quicker than other recipes, although, my substitutions may have lengthened the cook time a bit; it's still quicker! Yummy!

This is a quick recipe, however the pancakes turned out a little dry. I think since most other reviewers  added more syrup or honey, that probably helped with it. I would definitely add a teaspoon of vanilla next time and maybe even half a tsp baking soda.

This was an easy, quick recipe for making almond flour pancakes. I halved it, exactly, because I made them just for myself.  I did sub honey for the maple syrup (I don't use syrup on mine, I had them with a pear/apple butter). 
The one big change I would make is to omit, or switch to just a pinch, of salt. Following the recipe, I found them to be too salty.  I would probably add almond or vanilla extract in the future as well. Good consistency, though, and a good base for someone who has little experience cooking with alternative flours!

We really liked them. It made 8 good sized pancakes. Added a ripe banana, cinnamon, cloves, and allspice. I did not add any maple syrup to the batter but did pour some on the finished pancakes. Also boosted the rise with a half teaspoon each of baking soda and baking powder and a splash of lemon juice. What took me by surprise in the first lot was how fast they began to burn on the bottom! I flipped the second and final lot sooner and that worked better. I was also surprised that they had to be turned before they set so they were wet inside and did not hold their shape when flipped. That being said, I found them much tastier than any wheat flour pancake I have ever eaten. I am keeping this recipe in my Allrecipes recipe box!

These were quick and easy and great starter recipe for those looking for a gluten free/paleo pancake alternative. I halved the recipe and only used a pinch of salt. I think more would have been too much. Vanilla extract would be a nice addition and I will try that the next time I make them.

I followed this recipe and these were amazing! I made five inch pancakes. The batter allowed for a total of five pancakes. The nutty flavor was a major plus for this dish. I let the batter sit for about ten minutes before I started cooking. I melted real butter before each batter pour to get a crispy pancake.

Simple and quick. I was able to make 1/2 the recipe quickly to enjoy eating pancakes along with my family (who cook up the non gluten free kind). I adjusted with a pinch of salt and used a little raw honey with blueberries when having bites  here and there. Very tasty and filing. The 1/2 recipe made 3 small pancakes and I had 2 (saving one as a mid day snack vs nuts today). They are high in calories/fat to eat all 3 in one sitting if you are watching intake there.

If you are gluten free this is a good recipe. Like others, I used milk instead of water and I added a teaspoon of gluten free baking power. The baking power helped the pancakes to puff up and gave them that traditional pancake texture. If you are following a paleo diet, skip the baking powder.

Very easy and satisfied my bread craving.  They are very dense, so I was only able to eat just one.  My hubby is a BIG guy and he was only able to eat two.  I only used one egg, added extra vanilla and used sf syrup.  Next time I will add REAL bacon bits or diced cooked sausage to the batter to give them even more flavor.  This recipe is a winner for me.

I used honey and a banana instead of maple syrup. Doubled the batch to feed 4. I think next time I'll use almond milk instead of water. Delish!!

I give this recipe five stars because of its tremendous value in being simple, gluten-free, and low-carb (if you sub for the syrup).  The recipe does work, and the pancakes do taste good.  I left out the sweetener and it probably really needs some. I will add stevia next time. Also I would add vanilla or almond extract next time as others suggested. Thank you Allie!

Very easy to make and combine. I left out the salt and added 2 teaspoons of vanilla and cinnamon and used honey as the sweetener. The pancake itself was a little dry but complimented well with the banana on the side to sweeten it and moisten it while eating. I also added a dash of cinnamon to serve. Nice change to breakfast on a Saturday morning, will definitely make it again and serve with maple syrup and blueberries if I am ever lucky enough to find them where I live here in Africa.

Oh yeah!  I just finished making, and eating, a batch of these pancakes.  The taste is literally still hanging on my palate.  I incorporated some of the changes, others suggested, such as the addition of a tsp of vanilla, 2 tbs of oil, a couple pinches of cinnamon, and stevia instead of maple syrup, to lower the carb count.  These are very tasty.  I served them with breakfast sausage links, and sugar free blueberry syrup, not bad, but next time I'll make sure I have a sugar free maple syrup on hand to top them with.  I think a sugar free honey, instead of stevia, will give them a richer flavor, and maybe an extra tsp of vanilla.  I will also not make these again until I have some unsweetened coconut almond milk, to wash them down with.  It should be illegal to have pancakes without milk to wash them down with.  :-) Inspite of the changes made, this is a very good recipe, and a welcome addition to my low carb lifestyle.  Low carb breakfasts are usually dominated by eggs, either fried or scrambled, and bacon or sausage; which can get old, over the long run; thanks Allie, for giving me another tasty option, as they will help me to stay on course. These pancakes, either with a breakfast meat, or as a platform for low carb eggs benedict, broadens the possibilities, of what a low carb breakfast can be.

Very moist, quite dense. Filling, tasty, and I'll make them again for sure. Be sure to mix very well or else you'll have spots of scrambled egg.

I will not make it again. It wasn't batter----too dry and crumbly.  I tried to fix it by adding ingredients suggested by others in reviews, and it still didn't work.  It was an almond goulash that just fell apart in the pan. I put the rest of the batter in a pan in the oven...and it's just a dry pile of almond flour that's brown on top. Don't think I can use it for anything.

This was a great base recipe.

1) I used coconut milk instead of water (unsweetened, plain)
2) I added vanilla extract to taste (maybe 1 tsp)
3) I added cinnamon
4) I used about 1 tsp of maple syrup, and 1 tbsp coconut sugar
5) I am allergic to eggs, so I substituted the following for the 2 eggs: 1 TBSP flax seeds mixed with 3 TBSP water, and extra coconut milk (not measured; I added a splash here and there while stirring to get the consistency I wanted).
6) On my first pancake, it got way too "done" on the bottom, as I saw other reviewers post, so I added 1/4 tsp baking soda and 1/4 tsp baking powder to fluff up the next three pancakes so they weren't as dense. This helped them cook all the way through more quickly so they weren't still extremely doughy when I flipped them.

All in all, a great malleable base recipe for using almond flour as a substitute for regular flour. I will make these again!

Added 1/4 tsp of baking powder, 1/4 tsp of baking soda, and 1 tbsp of white vinegar; made it nice and fluffy with a mild sourdough flavour. Also, used almond milk instead of water, and liquid Sugar-Twin with a dash of maple extract instead of maple syrup. Adjusted the liquid ingredients to account for the vinegar.

I should mention, I made a double batch, so all my additions should be adjusted for a single batch.

This is a great base recipe!  I did make a few changes....First, I used all purpose rice flour instead of almond flour than I added 1 tsp. sugar, vanilla and raw honey(no syrup). I cook the first one and saw how thin the pancakes were I added 1/4 tsp of baking powder and 1/8 tsp baking soda.  The kids really liked them!.  If you are looking for a gluden and dairy free pancake recipe? This is pretty easy and good.

I was looking for a gluten-free pancake recipe, and this was a good foundation for almond pancakes. I added: Vanilla Extract and 1 tbsp crushed walnuts. I also substituted almond milk for water and coconut oil for the oil suggestion. Turned out super yummy!

I'm not on any special eating plan, just reducing some carbs.  Some people mentioned the batter is too thick. Thickness depends on egg size and the brand of almond flour.  Just add enough liquid (I used milk) to make it like pancake batter.  I also added 1 tsp vanilla, 1/2 tsp almond extract, 1/2 tsp baking powder, 1/2 tsp baking soda, and 1/2 teaspoon of cider vinegar (activates the powder and soda).  With the above doctoring, they were really tasty. Consider leaving out the maple syrup especially if you're eating them with syrup or jam on the side, otherwise, they're too sweet (and would have lots of added, unnecessary carbs).  If you add 1/4 c of ground flax seed (in place of one egg), it takes your net carbs to under 5 and you're adding good fiber.   Also, this recipe says it makes 4 LARGE pancakes.  If you scroll to the bottom of the recipe and click on "full nutrition" after the general nutritional amounts,  you get the entire nutritional profile with the number of servings listed at the top.  This is why some people say the listed calories are wrong - they don't realize the recipe is based on only 4 pancakes.

So, first time, they were a 2star...
For the second attempt, I adapted the recipe by adding 1/2 tsp baking powder, increasing the oil to 2 Tablespoons of oil which did the trick for me and these pancakes turned out fantastic!  This recipe is perfect and yields 4  medium sized pancakes.  Breakfast is back baby!  Family loves them...And that makes me a happy mommy.

It took me a few times to get this right. I kept trying to flip them too early (like they were regular pancakes, but these take much longer to cook) and they would fall apart. Then I would leave them too long or turn up the heat to try to hurry the process and they would get really dark or burn. Don't make these when you're in a rush. I also double the water because they are too dense otherwise. I add a few chocolate chips and eat them without any syrup and they are very good.

Really surprised how these turned out. I probably used a little more almond flour (kind of a heaping cup) and jazzed them up as others suggested. Dash of baking powder, dash of cinnamon (i think this really helped them) , just pinch of salt, used whole milk and cooked in coconut oil. Measured them out with a quarter cup measuring cup. 5 small pancakes. Really pretty tastey considering im not gluten free

Very good recipe. I added a couple of things though chia seed, flax seed, and some sugar free applesauce to moisten it. They were good and very feeling after eating a single serving which is a plus. Thank you for sharing!

Great recipe!  Very easy, though it took me a couple tries to perfect them.  I omit the maple syrup and sweeten with crushed raspberries.  I also add a bit of vanilla extract.  

I cook them on a lot of butter so that they slide easy on the pan. 

As with all pancakes, wait for the pan to be hot and don't flip too soon.  :)

Easy to mix up the batter and leave it in the fridge to use the next day if you have extra.

I used chocolate almond milk instead of water and put chocolate chips in it! also I mushed up a banana and put it in there too it adds a little bit of flavor but mostly I like it because it adds some fluffiness to these pancakes! yum yum :)

I took advice from others and decreased salt and added vanilla.  I also had a feeling it would not be enough for four so I increased it by half.  It still was not enough.  They burn easily so I recommend watching temp carefully.  Main thing is they are DELICIOUS!

Delicious and super filling.  It doesn't take many of these pancakes to feel full.  They came out awesome...I added some cinnamon and used more maple syrup.  Although, I feel that the pancakes themselves don't need to be that sweet because I top them with syrup anyway.  I did notice one batch was a little dry; I added real butter and used avocado oil to cook them in...the last batch didn't have an issue.  Will definitely be using this again.  Thank you for the recipe :)

These were pretty good! It came together very quickly. I followed the recipe as written, and was pleasantly surprised. I just started doing the Paleo Diet this week, and I'm glad I don't have to give up pancakes.

Very easy and tasty pancake recipe. I like the fact it is dairy and wheat free and it's something I enjoyed eating. I did not add salt and I added a touch of almond extract, had some maple syrup poured over them YUM. Thank you Allie.

I loved how simple and quick these were!  I doubled the recipe for my family of three, but almost didn't need to, they are so filling- and my two-year old absolutely loves them as well!  We will definitely be making these again.

Delicious! Great taste! I do substitute Maple syrup with Steen's 100% Pure Cane Syrup. I use pure cane syrup, 1. because I was raised on it here in Louisiana, 2. taste great, 3. better for you because, it's the real thing, and 4. a lot lower in carbs than other syrups. I already ate one, that's why there is only 3 on the plate. One is all I can eat. Very filling.

These were delicious! I love the nuttiness of the almond flour.  I did make 2 adjustments that I think made them less dense than they were reported as being (mine were nice and light): Substituted 1% Milk for the water and added a teaspoon of Baking Powder, and I let the batter rest for about an hour before I made them. I also threw some cinnamon in...because I like cinnamon in my pancakes! Will definitely make these again!

I didn’t make any changes to this recipe but I think I’ll add cinnamon next time. I like that the cakes are not too sweet. I also like that it only makes 4 cakes so that I don’t overindulge.  These are a welcome change.

I made these pancakes just as they are and they were good.  Next time though, I will add just a touch more Monk Fruit to the recipe and see if that will make them a little better.  If not, I will try a different ingredient to enhance the flavor a little more.  All in all though, they are good.

I use one tablespoon of Lakanto monk fruit sweetener instead of syrup, and add a half teaspoon of baking powder to make them a little fluffier. I also like to add some vanilla, almond, or lemon extract for some fun flavor!

Sadly, this didn’t work at all for me. And I doubled the recipe in hopes of freezing some for breakfast during the week. I couldn’t get the batter to bind, even with an extra egg. I tried it both waffle and pancake style. Waffles just wedged in my maker. Pancakes heated beautifully, but crumbled and smoothed on flip. *sad face*

It’s real easy to make, the consistency is perfect for cooking. Not too runny and not super thick. The flavor is kind of plain for my kids, with some pure maple syrup it taste fine though, they still gobble them all up.

It was a decent recipe. Very easy to make. It was also my 1st experience using almond flour. I can't blame the recipe for not liking it a whole lot. Almond flour just has a less satisfying texture for me. That being said, my kids both liked them so as a healthier option I may make them again and grow to like them more. I did use milk instead of water and after I tried a couple I ended up adding a quarter cup greek yogurt and a few pinches of baking powder. It helped a little but I still felt I was chewing on ground nuts. lol (I hope someone else gets a good laugh with me.)

My husband and I really love these pancakes. I didn’t make any changes. Yes I will make them often. I served my pancakes with sugar-free maple syrup.

They fell apart when I flipped them. But the only eggs we had were frozen from the back of our fridge, so I had to use the whites after thawing them and I probably flipped too soon. Oh well. Better luck next time.

Just made this this morning  For my kids and they definitely were not happy the did not want to eat them after trying them for myself they were a bit dry and didn't have much   Flavor. If I make these again I will definitely add a sugar substitute and maybe a banana or something.

I made these, just a few minutes ago, actually-- And taste wise, they are amazing, instead of maple syrup, I used 1 and a 1/2 tsp of Pyure sugar substitute, 2/8th cinnamon (Smell was there, but taste didn't follow through, so needed a bit more!), 1 tsp of vanilla, 1/2 tsp of baking soda (After reading comments for less denser pancakes), and only used 1 egg, and 1/4th cup of unsweetened almond milk, with a splash extra to give it a nice smooth consistency--- The batter looked so nice, and smelled heavenly, but like many of the other commenters, it did end up being on the dry side, and a few fell apart on the edges , I suppose that has more to do with the almond flour, than anything else, though. Would definitely make these again, but double the recipe, because it only made 12 slight bigger than silver dollar sized, so it fed 3 people, 4 lil pancakes each. Small dollop of whipped cream and fresh fruit, you can easily dress this up and make it beautiful and elegant. Great base recipe

Used whole milk instead of water, added another slosh of maple syrup, 1/8 cup more almond flour, 1 tsp baking powder and 1/2 cup fresh blueberries. I wanted a thicker, fluffier pancake that held blueberries well and they turned out wonderfully!

Doing whole 30 so adjusted the recipe a bit. Used a mashed banana instead of syrup and added a little cinnamon. Cooked in coconut oil. Pretty tasty, not sweet, but good with some berries for a different breakfast.

We added 2 tablespoons of shredded unsweetened coconut.  I think that blueberries would be a great addition - we didn’t have any so next time we will add them!

This was my first go at almond pancakes. Made it 2 separate ways. The recipe made as is was ok. Second round I added some coconut flower and coconut, blueberries, white sugar and almond milk. It was very thick and pasty. I added quite a bit of almond milk, but still super thick. It was ok. I don’t have much experience with almond flour though to be fair. Will definitely try again!

I would make these again, as they are a very good substitute for white or wheat flour.  I didn't get the carb and sugar crash after eating.  As other reviewers noted, they are on the denser side.  I added vanilla, nutmeg and bananas.  Substituted milk for the water.

First time I ever made pancakes using almond flour. I substituted almond milk in place of the water. My grandaughters ages 7 and 9 liked them too. when they say "Mmm" while eating them, you know they're good!

I had to add some Stevia to bring the sweetness up to a level I like.  I also used sugar free maple syrup instead of the regular maple syrup.

these pancakes tastes amazing. but a couple of things to note, they do have a different consistency as compared to normal fluffy pancakes, due to almond flour not as finely ground as wheat flour. also these will burn fast...cook on lower heat setting, don't wait for bubbles, and cook for minimal amount fallout if not maybe a little less especially on the second side

Thanks for the great recipe. I doubled the batch and added 1 mashed banana, 1 tbsp baking powder, and 1 tsp baking soda. Half the batch had some chocolate chips for my son and the other had blueberries. Note the pancakes shouldn’t be too big or they are hard to flip without falling apart.

These were great!  I did change a couple things because I am trying to keep it Keto. I substituted Blue Agave Syrup for the Maple syrup and cooked them in Walnut oil. I kept them small making them Silver dollar sized.  My grandkids loved them. I also tried a batch with heavy whipping cream instead of the water to make the texture more like a flour based pancake. They also came out great!  Thank you!

Please tell me what I did wrong.

First, I substituted the eggs with flax eggs.

1/4 C water was barely enough to dampen the flour, so I added more water.  With a 1/4 C, it came out like bread dough.  Very thick.

I also added the baking soda and a tsp of lemon juice.

Got it so it had the consistency of a traditional pancake batter.

Used a non stick fry pan and good oil.

These stuck so badly, and didn't rise at all.  They came our real thin and I basically had to destroy them to flip them or remove from the pan.

Did I make a mistake by adding more water?

Thanks.

Delicious and significantly easier than my oatmeal pancakes. On my 2nd batch, I added 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract and 1/2 teaspoon of ground cinnamon which I found to really kick up the favor! They paired well with the almond flour, but burned a little easier so be wary.

Super easy pancakes. After looking at the comments here are the changes I made:
2 tablespoons of honey
1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 egg
1 egg white 
I beat the egg white and then folded it into the batter. The pancakes came out super light and fluffy. Doing it this way made about 4 pancakes.

Followed the recipe and the pancakes were so dry there was no way they could cook into pancakes without falling apart. I followed other people's advice on adding sweetners and it still tastes terrible and dry. Don't make unless you want to be disappointed in the outcome.

It is a great recipe. Tastes like cornbread. Very filling and dense. It's not really a pancake but it satisfies the craving for carbs. I used a bit of vanilla flavoring, baking powder and a bit of artificial sweetener. My boyfriend and his parents loved it and I will make again.

Good when you don't have a lot of time to make breakfast.  
Taste but not fluffy.

With this recipe the pancakes were very thin and bland tasting, I would make it again but thicken it up with more flour and bananas.

I made this with a couple of alterations. I decreased the maple syrup by half, then added about a tsp of lemon juice, 1/2 tsp baking powder and increased the milk to about 1/3 to 1/2 cup. They are amazing!

Quick and easy.  Added  1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract and 1/2 teaspoon of baking powder and 1/2 teaspoon of baking soda ... added fluff ! 
I have an electric stovetop so I had to put on low-med ( browned quick but didn’t burn )

No, not for me. This was just awful. if you're going gluten-free then you need to have a blend of different flours, not just one. Almond meal by itself is just too, well, "meally".

This is a really good recipe.  Based on the reviews, I tried to tweek it the first time, which turned out disastrous.  Threw that batch out and followed the recipe to a T.  Perfect.  Don't expect fluffy pancake house style.  Accept these for what they are and they are great!

I, for one, made this exactly as written. (No banana, Greek yogurt, honey, milk, etc.) My keto palette found them delicious. Level of sweetness- perfect, with just the tablespoon of maple syrup. No topping. I hope to enjoy this recipe many times in the future, just the way it’s written. (My pre-keto, sugar-desensitized self would have found them not sweet enough, as many reviewers have expressed.)

Love, love, love this great recipe for pancakes. The nutty texture and hint of sweet was a big hit this morning in our house. Our 5 yr old couldn't tell they weren't the usual box flour pancake. These will absolutely replace the Hungry Jack!!

Really good, but incorporated some of the other reviewers' comments (thanks guys!) to make this an outstanding keto-friendly recipe.  I used only one egg,  but added 1 tsp. each of baking powder and baking soda, 2 tblsp greek yogurt, 2 tsp vanilla, dash of nutmeg, 2 dashes of cinnamon.  By having the syrup in the mix, you really have to watch the temp so it doesn't scorch.  Nice and fluffy, with no need for syrup IMO.

I am on a Keto diet and I’m always looking for great recipes that have low carbs, a girl can only eat so many eggs for breakfast! I love this pancake recipe. It taste a little bit like cornbread. I like I like adding 1 teaspoon of vanilla to the batter. I also add 1 teaspoon of flaxseed to bring the net carbs down even more.

Tastes great but the texture is off a little. I am comparing it to traditional pancakes though. Overall Im happy with the results because they’re just so yummy. Hooray for better health. Takes some getting used to but worth it!!

This is the best :quick and easy" recipe I could find.  I found lots that require more ingredients and additional steps, but I just wanted the most basic.   I even used cheap and gritty almond flour and this still turned out tasty.    I added cinnamon and erithrytol so that I didn't need to use any substitute for syrup.

I give 3 stats for flavor but cooking is funky. it seems to take a while on any setting heat and the middle didn't seem to want to be done. I made my niece mini ones, i think those turned out better. so I say try making mini pancakes with this recipe so they are evenly cooked.

I am beginning the journey of watching carbs. I wasn't sure what to expect as I had never used almond flour. I was pleasantly surprised at the taste. Different but good. I used sugar substitute in place of the maple syrup and added blueberries. I also heated my syrup with blueberries. Will definitely be making these again.

Just started using almond flour and found this recipe. Good base recipe. Based on other reviews I added 1/2 t baking powder and baking soda and only used a pinch of salt.  Added a smidgen of cinnamon, nutmeg and vanilla and enough (about 1 cup of unsweetened soy milk) to make batter pourable.  They turned out great. Inspired to try other almond flour recipes.  Thanks everyone for your reviews and recipe changes or additions. They are always helpful.

This was so easy and satisfying!  They are very delicate once cooked, and can be a little on the dry side so I think oil is important, and I also added a little baking soda for lift.

Dreadful recipe!  The pancakes browned quicker than they cooked and there was no way they could be flipped - ended up a big heap of mess in the pan.  I've used way better recipes than this so will return to them!

Very good for gluten free or high carb watchers.  I used stevia instead of maple syrup and used extra coconut oil.  The recipe called for 1 tsp but I used about 2 tablespoons. I topped it with nuts and a warm berry compote (also sweetened with a little stevia).

Whoa! Watch the calories! This recipe is listed as 4 servings at 59 calories each. This is WAY off. A cup of Bob's Red Mill Almond Flour is 640 calories by itself, add 2 eggs at 70 calories each for 140 calories, 1 tablespoon maple syrup or honey for 60 calories and 1 teaspoon of oil at 40 calories. Do the math. This is 840 calories per recipe. If this is 4 servings (and it's more like 2) it equates to 210 calories per serving.  Yes, they are tasty but I just blew my calories for the day before I did the math.

I used flaxseed instead of eggs (allergies), and it was too stiff. Tried adding more water, didn't work. This recipe needs more tweaking.

My tweak: Stevia instead of maple syrup, almond milk instead of water, a Tbsp of Greek yogurt, and a good dose of cinnamon. Butter them up after and eat with blueberries and applesauce, or peanut butter, depending on your diet restrictions. Delicious!

Excellent!  I used 1/4 cup flaxseed in place of one of the eggs, almond milk instead of water (a little additional because of the flaxseed), 1 tsp baking soda, 1 tsp vanilla and agave instead of maple syrup.   Turned out really well and will make again.

I found these to be bland, next time I'll add more vanilla. I used unsweetened vanilla almond milk instead of water, and only 1 egg, added 1/2 tsp baking powder. It satisfied my craving for gf pancakes. Would make again with a few adjustments. Thx for the recipe!

Took some of the suggestions and added half banana and 1/4 tsp of vanilla extract, 1 full egg and 1 only the egg white and sub water for almond milk - for extra nutty flavor. Good but quite grainy...probably need to look for finer almond flour. Will definitely try again.

I loved it!
I did however, make some changes to the original recipe.
First of all, I halved the recipe and I added the following: 1/2 a ripe banana, vanilla, 1/4 tsp baking soda, a dash of lemon and milk instead of water. I topped it with honey.
It was fluffy and delicious!

We enjoyed with modification.  I substituted almond milk for water and apple sauce for oil. I also added nutmeg, cinnamon and vanilla.  I had to cook on low to avoid burning. Also, the first two weren't done on the inside. I served with blueberries and unsweetened coconut which complimented well!!

unlike 95% of all the reviewers, i made this recipe as is, without any alterations. it was dry. it was ok for me to eat, but i wouldn't serve this to anyone else. also, it was not as sweet as pancakes with wheat flour, so if you're looking for something similar, this is not the recipe.

I really enjoyed these, I cut back on the salt because I cooked them in salted butter (cleaning out the pan each pancake).  I made 6 which = 2 carbs a piece (used Hyvee Almond Flour).  Will definitely make again!

I have made these several times with honey instead of maple syrup, mostly because syrup's expensive. Today, I wanted to do a 1.5 sized batch, but screwed up the conversion on the amount of water. I ended up putting in 3/4 c instead of 3/8 c. At first, I thought it was a disaster, but the pancakes actually came out much better. Easier to pour the batter, easier and quicker to cook, easier to flip, better tasting and less doughy. I can recommend repeating my mistake.

FANTASTIC recipe;  It's quick to make with simple ingredients. I found the consistency to be exactly how I expected; almond flour keeps its stability better than any baking flour (won't turn to mush) so it may seem "dry".
I did add some vanilla just to try and see if I liked the flavor; I found them to be delicious either way.
I threw some fresh blueberries & strawberries into a small pot without any added sugar, and cooked them down for a topping. SO good! SO simple! SO healthy compared to traditional pancakes. THANK YOU for putting this recipe out there!

very tasty and easy to make.  I substituted almond milk for water and added vanilla.  I did have to decrease the egg and add more milk to get the consistency I wanted.  Terrific option for a low glycemic pancake.

It definitely needs  some tweeks. With the tweeks I would give it 4 stars. It was originally very dry so I added backing soda, smashed banana, and more honey. Other people here have some good modifications too that I will try next time. I also added cinnamon, ginger, and nutmeg. Molasses is a good way to sweeten it too.

These are edible but not good. Maybe baking powder would make them lighter .... but they still taste too much like a cooked egg.

Delicious. Made my own almond meal as I had just made almond milk. Felt like I was Martha Stewart. I think this should be some type of cookie recipe as well. Ate with nuts and watermelon on the side. I don't do a lot of sugar, so these are plenty sweet for me. Super easy.

Maybe I did something wrong - they came out mushy.  Also, if 1c of almond flour is over 600 calories, and if this recipe makes 4 servings... 59 calories a serving?  Not a chance.  AllRecipes.com do check your math!  I will probably make these again, just in case I added too much water, and if they're good I'll adjust the rating.

Yes.  I made these  pancakes but I subtutited honey in place of the maple syrup and they turned out excellent. I loved them, and the fact that they are low on carbs and calories.

This is the first recipe I tried with almond flour.   Very satisfying and just a little dense.  I used sugar free syrup and it was just as good.

I substituted unsweetened vanilla almond milk for the water, and used truvia instead of the maple syrup. They were amazing. Definitely making these again.

This is the first recipe  with almond flour that I have loved. I halved  the recipe minus the maple syrup  (To keep the carbs down). I added a packet of Splenda  and a few frozen blueberries. I Topped the pancakes with a dab of melted butter and a bit of Splenda mixed together. Half of the recipe  is less than 500 cal and only 8 g of net carbs. It made three cute little pancakes. Very filling – didn't need to eat for hours.

Tasty alternative to regular pancakes for us low carb eaters. Added cinnamon, vanilla and used stevia extract powder instead of syrup. Turned out really well.

I used half almond flour and half whole wheat flour (I had to use it up).  I used evaporated milk instead of water (I had to use it up!) which gave it a thicker consistency. I added Truvia to sweeten and Baking Powder to give it fluff.  For flavor I added vanilla, cinnamon and salt. Lastly, threw in a handful of fresh blueberries.  Made six filling medium size thick pancakes. Will make again!

It was an easy to follow recipe. Substituted almond milk for the water and used coconut oil for the oil. This is a great alternative to traditional pancakes. My 91 year old grandma loved them!

This is delicious. My review is a bit biased because I had to swap Splenda and a bit of water for the maple syrup (lower carb). It was fantastic this way. The second time I made these I added a bit of vanilla and it was still fantastic. Love it!

I haven't had pancakes in over 6 months due to low carb.  Absolutely amazing, but following what other reviewers have done, I made a double batch and only used 1/4 tsp salt, and 1/4 cup flax seed milk with 1/4 cup water.  Was very very good 0 calorie, sugar, sugar alcohol, and carb maple flavoring dripping off the edges!

Made these with a few minor changes. Used 1 tablespoon xylitol  sweetner instead of maple syrup. Added 1 tablespoon peanut butter powder and 1 tablespoon heavy whipping cream. They were delicious! I added some berries to half of the batch for my daughter and she ate 'em up! Definitely will make these again.

I made only half of the recipe and added a tablespoon of peanut butter. It gave the pancakes some nice texture  and added flavor! The pancakes were pretty good and easy to make! Will be making these again :)

Just made these for breakfast. I added a tbs of Stevia and only used one egg and left out the salt. It took me a few tries to get the timing right on when to flip, but they will now be my go to recipe for pancakes. They taste similar to what I'm used to but have more flavor than regular pancakes. Yummy!

Shockingly good! I halved the recipe and added a splash of heavy cream. Really delightful! They are not the exact texture of pancakes, but they taste good and are fluffy nonetheless. I even used raw sprouted almond flour!

I have been searching for a good grain free pancakes recipe for my family. This is it, although I made a few changes. Per another reviewer's  suggestion, I added a mashed banana. I also left out the maple syrup. Next time I may add raw honey. I made a simple blueberry sauce to go on top. We all liked them! I'll be making these again!

So ...not really pancakes like regular pancakes but still pretty good. I did add a bit more low carb maple syrup and a tsp of baking soda. I like the nutty flavor and I added a piece of sliced bacon when I cooked it. Yummy...I'm so tired of eggs so this was really good.

This is a great base recipe. I halved it (which yielded three pancakes), used maple syrup, and added chocolate chips and a pinch of baking soda. Their texture is closer to a buckwheat pancake rather than a fluffy traditional pancake. Next time I will try a finer ground almond meal and a bit more baking soda. Although they're not quite the real thing, they're a tasty alternative if you can't have wheat.

I will be making again tomorrow. I used honey instead of maple syrup, and butter for the oil, but kept the rest the same. Made about 8 3-inch pancakes, and even my husband ate one without added syrup on top. They are dense and filling.

SO DELICIOUS!  I was skeptical about this recipe, but WOW is all I have to say.  I added 1/2tsp Baking Powder and 1tsp vanilla and I was blown away!  I am not even sure the Baking Powder was needed, I just added it as so many reviews recommended it.  I will definitely make this recipe again!  WOW, I think this is even better than wheat pancakes!  My 5 year old and 2 1/2 year old loved them too.

Loved them.  In place of the maple syrup I used about 2 tsps. of xylitol.  Also added about a 1/2 tsp. of maple flavoring.  I mistakenly put the oil (I used olive oil) in the batter.  I put a little olive oil in the skillet and they browned very nicely.  They were delicious.  The texture was great too.  I would do it exactly the same next time.  A great substitute for the regular pancakes.

This was my first attempt at paleo pancakes. I milked some almonds a couple days ago and dried the almond meal, then today ground the almond meal into almond flour, the first time ever. It made one cup of flour, so I searched for a recipe that used one cup of almond flour and other ingredients I already had in the house. This was it! I followed it exactly, then added 1/4 tsp vanilla just because I love vanilla flavoring. I used a bit of ghee as the cooking oil and also put a little ghee on the pancakes with a drizzle of syrup. Of course they were delicious!

These are wonderful. I add vanilla, soda and baking powder to make them a little more fluffy. I use coconut oil in the pan and always add blueberries to the batter. Outstanding!

These were wonderful!  I did as others suggested and added a tsp of vanilla and honey rather than syrup and a tiny bit of almond extract .  They were delicious and filling and felt like such a treat without being unhealthy!

Honey is a great substitute for maple syrup... Also, try roasting coconut flakes and mix it in with your batter. This will help sweeten up the pancake and also add a little crunch!

Needed a filling protein breakfast after my work out so I gave this recipe a whirl w/ a few adjustments. I substituted almond milk for water & raw honey for maple syrup. Took advice from other reviews and only used a pinch of salt. Added oats & cinnamon to the batter and topped the pancakes with unsweetened shredded coconut, pecans, & a dippy egg (aka an egg over medium). These were really good & I'll definitely make them again. Thanks for the recipe!

Easy to prepare. Puffed up perfectly. BUT I wasn't a fan of the mouth-feel of these pancakes. Too grainy. Next time I will replace 1/2 cup of the almond flour with bob's red mill gluten-free flour.

Made these per the instructions but also added vanilla extract for some more flavor.  I did not like these and am still looking for a good recipe. They were flat and flavorless.

I was surprised how good these were.  I took the advice of others and added almond extract and vanilla extract.  Even hubby who hates anything that is not normal, liked them.  I think next time I'll add some toasted sliced or slivered almonds for fun!

To turn these rather dense pancakes into light, fluffy darlings, try separating the egg whites and beating till stiff. Then fold in.  Makes a great recipe even better.  Delicious with yogurt & apple sauce.

These low carb pancakes are fantastic! A bit more dense & grainy than with a wheat flour recipe.. but with butter & sugar free maple syrup they are very satisfying!  The batter was quite thick so I added more water & they came out perfect!  Forgot to add vanilla.. but didn't really need it.. Yummmy!

Tried almond flour pancakes for the first time as a healthier version and i was impressed! These are WAY better than the regular pancakes!!! The only thing i would recommend is cooking it at the low temp because it burns easily. I also substituted water for almond milk. It turned out fantastic!! DEFINITELY WORTH A TRY!!!  Yum

Like the idea of having a basic almond flour recipe. Is there a reason why there's no baking powder? In any case I added some and instead of wisking everything, blended it to give it a smoother consistency.I also trippled it for a family of four. Thanks

I was pleasantly surprised, these were great! I used stevia instead of syrup and this seemed to work well. Very filling and great for a low carb breakfast! Will definitely make these again!

So simple and so good. I switched out the maple syrup and used agave instead and added cinnamon.
