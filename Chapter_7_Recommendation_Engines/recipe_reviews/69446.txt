Several years ago I spent time in Italy with my Italian friend when she went home to visit.  While there we visited her friend in Liguria and was served this dish as it is very popular in that region.  I loved it and make it often in the summer when I have so much fresh basil from the garden.   I make it the way it was prepared in Italy.  I boil the pasta, add the potatoes to the pasta during the last six minutes of boiling, and then add the green beans to the water during the last three minutes.  Everything is drained and the pesto added and tossed.  I didn't use the yogurt but that might be an interesting addition.

I made this with angel hair, and replaced the yogurt with light sour cream. Also added in mushrooms.  Girlfriend is a PESTO FREAK and LOVED IT!

Kat, you've got a 5-star recipe here!  I thought it was a delicious blend of flavor that I would be proud to serve guests.  I didn't have any prepared pesto, although I do have LOTS of Lime Basil in my garden, so just used that in the yogurt sauce.  I added walnuts and sauteed them in butter along with the potatoes and green beans as directed.  Used just a bit of sugar with the yogurt to balance the tang.  It's tasty to eat and pretty to look at!

It's more tangy than expected, probably the yogurt.  I made this for a couple of friends and got mixed reviews.  It wasn't a "yummy" dish... it was more an "ok" dish.

I love this website and use it a lot.  I've been irritated more than once when there is a long string of people who have rated a recipe really high and then someone gives it a one star - I just don't see how that can happen.  You should have a sense of what you're getting when you try a recipe and if it has things about it which you know you don't care for (eg, it's spicy and you like bland)- then don't bother cause you're going in with a negative attitude.  Well, this is a long way of saying I reallllly did not care for this recipe - and I don't know why.  It is adventuresome - interesting mix of ingredients, all of which I like individually. Partly I think it was the potatoes - their texture was weird with all the other ingredients.  I used frozen green beans and I added some chunks of white chicken meat - other than that, followed exactly as written.  This just did not work for me.

This was amazing, but of course there were some slight alterations I made. I followed the recipe to the T except when it came to a few little things. I followed the reviews of some of the others and used sour cream (me and yogurt never got along well) and mushrooms which I roasted. Seeing as how I have a carnivor for a husband I through in some chopped up ready to serve bacon and then topped it with goat cheese instead of parmasian cheese.

This was just delicious!!!  After seeing another reviewers suggestion, I added about a tsp of sugar when mixing the final ingredients together.

Perfect!

I made this for Meatless Monday.  It was perfect.  I used fat free plain Greek yogurt.  I may double the yogurt/pesto next time.  It was yummy and everyone including the kids loved it!

The only thing i changed was sour cream instead of yogurt and added just a little bit of mozzarella on top. this was an amazing meal, perfect for summer, very good with an antipasta salad. This is good enough to be from olive garden or carrabas. Healthy, quick and light. I will make this again soon!

Well, first of all,I'd NEVER use Potatoes & Pasta in the same recipe, so Omited the potatoes. Didn't need that much starch! Other than that, it was Good!

This dish was too heavy for my taste. I also over boiled the potatoes (7 + 3 min. was too long), which caused them to break up when mixing. Don't think I'll make this again.

This was a good recipe.  I did make a few changes.  Like others I used sour cream instead of yogurt, because I couldn't find a small container of plain yogurt and I wasn't going to buy a big tub just for this recipe.  I then added diced yellow onion and a half of red bell pepper to the veggie mix because they were in my fridge and needed to be used up.  My husband wanted me to add some turkey kielbasa for next time but as is it was a good recipe.

Very easy and delicious. Adding the yogurt to the pesto gives the pasta a slight tangy flavor that we really enjoyed. I used 3 cloves minced garlic and cut out the Parmesan but increased the pesto to 1/2 cup. I also doubled the green beans and used frozen instead of fresh, and it turned out great.

I didn't think that this had any particularly special flavor.  It was an interesting combination, but not one I'm willing to try again.  I didn't like the pesto/yogurt combination; I love both but I didn't feel it added anything to either flavor or made them stronger.  I did, however, like the potatoes and green beans together, but I will probably make those by themselves instead of couple with pasta.

Outstanding. All I did differently from the recipe was double the garlic and added boiled chicken. (I boiled the other stuff in the leftover water) I was very pleased with the taste. Made more than I imagined it would, too.

This is a delicious recipe, the yogurt and pesto really complemented each other.  I used non-fat yogurt, 2 cloves of garlic and olive oil spray instead of 1 tbsp.  I'll definitely be making this for my family again.

I don't know... this was just okay. Seemed a little bland to me somehow. I love all the ingredients, but together in this dish it just wasn't great. My daughter liked it more than I did. We'll finish it off, but I won't make it again.

While I made pesto from scratch and didn't add the yogurt, if one wanted to reduce calories, less pesto and more yogurt would be the way to go. I posted the NYT version of this on MyFitnessPal and a lot of posters suggested using canned white beans instead of the potatoes, to get the protein count up. I'm almost ready to harvest basil again, and will try that then. If you grow green beans and basil, this is a great recipe with which to kick off the harvest.

Very nice recipe, I liked the tangy flavor that came from the yogurt. Used whole grain pasta but other than that I followed the recipe. Makes a nice dinner when paired w/a simple side salad. Thanks for sharing!

I also substituted the yogurt with sour cream and added cooked chicken. This was a great meal. I made my pesto from basil in my garden!
