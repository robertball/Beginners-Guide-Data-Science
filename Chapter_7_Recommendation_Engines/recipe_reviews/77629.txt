I used the recipe for my Oktoberfest Party! They were an absolutely hit and everyone went away with one! They are soft and just perfection all around! I'm making them again to today for a blogger friend of mine.

These cookies taste really good. Different from traditional gingerbread cookies because of the peanut butter, but very good. I didn't have butter flavored shortening so I used half shortening and half butter and that may be why they did not hold together well when rolled out. I had to add quite a bit of flour to get them to roll out well. I will make these again because we always have a lot of peanut butter!
