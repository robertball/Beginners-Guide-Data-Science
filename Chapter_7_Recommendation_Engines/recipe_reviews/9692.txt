I was disapointed by these cookies, they were flat and sticky, they had a nice chocolatey taste, but they just didn't look good. Maybe they'd be better cooked in a Brownie pan rather than as individaul cookies.

this recipe tasted really good (but it kind of tasted like sweetened condensed milk  more than anything). it also stuck to the pan pretty bad after it was baked (i had to chisel them off of the pan), maybe it would be better to bake on oiled parchment paper rather than the pan spray. i probably wont make it again, but everyone who ate it said that they loved it. 
 this recipe should probably be called "sweetened condensed milk cookies" or something.

I'm no baker when it comes to sweets; however, these turned out pretty good.  I even froze the extra batter.  Although, the receipe states to drop them with a spoon, it maybe better to just cook them in a brownie pan.  I'm happy with the turn out.
