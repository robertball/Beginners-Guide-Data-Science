I would have given these delicious bars the 5 star rating that it deserves except the two things that I have found incorrect with this recipe.   The first time I made them I did make them in the 16 x 11 pan that T. Lee instructed, and I baked for the 30 minutes it stated.  I had no problem getting it spead into the pan, but they came out burnt, to thin and way toooo crispy.  So the next 3 times I have made them I used a  9 x 13  cookie sheet with sides, and set the timer for 22 minutes.  My experience has been absolutley do not bake these longer than 25 minutes, and for my oven I only bake for 22 - 24 minutes.  I also tried this recipe with walnuts, and I always sprinkle it with a sugar mixed with cinnamon instead of plain sugar. Also try serving with real vanilla ice cream, the crunch with a good ice cream is sooo perfect!  Better yet, cut and make into ice cream sandwiches!  These are quick, great tasting, and worth trying, because for such few ingrediets, it goes a long way!

These bars have a lot of potential but are still missing that little extra kicker.  Perhaps they would taste better with brown sugar or a half-and-half?  I'll be playing around with this recipe and will let you know if I find anything that really makes these bars pop.

Their flavor is good and they look very attractive.  If you're looking for something super sweet and moist though, this is not the right recipe.  They have that subtle sweetness to them that isn't overwhelming and are more of a "dunking treat" than a "snacking treat."  Perfect for a cup of tea or coffee.

I also agree that the recipe should call for a 9x13 pan, especially with how dry and hard to spread the batter is.  If you want super thin though, the larger pan size could work - just watch your heat and time.

This was a favorite of my mom's at Christmas time. When made correctly(I suggest a 13x9 pan) they have a delcate, crunchy texture.

I recently made these bars and It can out like a cookie.
I think the recipe was missing baking powder because it says to use   all-purpose flour. Needless to say it did not rise.

These turned out awesome!  Not too sweet, slightly moist and nutty.  My pan was 15x10x1 and worked perfectly.  (Check out the picture I posted.) I wonder if some of the reviewers missed the fact that the oven should be 325 not 350.  Mine were not dry or crispy at all.  I think the use of the word "pour" batter into pan was misleading.  I had to "press" it with my fingers.  I will definitely make these again!

I don't know if I did something wrong but this did not fit in my 16x11x1 pan.  Perhaps 13x9 would've worked.  Anyway, it turned out more like a huge misshapen cookie, a little burnt on the edges so the middle would cook.  The batter was yummy and the result is not bad.  Had I made it into cookies, I think it would have rated 4 stars.  
I'll give this one another try.

I have been making this recipe for years, but I found it turns out better in a 9 X 13 pan if you are looking for a moister bar. I always seem to have to add some milk to it to get it to spread evenly in a jelly roll pan, which is what my recipe calls for. It is however a great coffee break cookie!

I didn't make this at all yet, but I probably will tomorrow. What I probably will do is to add diced apple over top with the nuts along with cinnamon and I'll sprinkle brown sugar as well. I think that would be a nice kick to the recipe. Hope this helps:)

It is really good. I put the whole egg in and omitted walnuts on the top. It is so easy to make and extremely delicious.

These had great potential, but they were wayyy to buttery. And they brushed egg white on top was gross!

While these bars are decent, they are definitely lacking in something. I replaced the nuts with chocolate but even that didn't change much. I think my pan was also smaller than recommended like others have been saying. Good, just not great

Made this last night. I feel it was missing something. The first time I make a recipe I follow the directions. The final mixture was so dry and crumbly, that there is no way that i could have "poured the batter into the pan". I added an extra egg yolk, and extra butter, it made it more like dough, that i had to flatten with a rolling pin into the 10x13 pan. And it still baked dry, I only baked it for 25 min. The flavour was great, loved the amount of cinnamon added. Do you think adding milk would help? If so how much.
