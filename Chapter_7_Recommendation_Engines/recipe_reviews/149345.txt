Great recipe that's fun to do with kids! The "crunch" was a nice departure from the ususal french toast. I used a pizza cutter to cut the bread into thirds and added a little sugar to the egg/milk mixture along with a bit of vanilla and cinnamon for good measure. Once they were done I topped them off with some confectioners' sugar and real maple syrup. Great way to start your morning.....

My kids really enjoyed this. This made quite a bit, so I wrapped up the rest for tomorrow. I think I might add a little nutmeg, vanilla and cinnamon to the egg mixture next time. I used Special K because that was all I had. I served this with a fruit and yogurt parfait.

Good - my kids loved it. I leave the bread whole and add cinnamon, vanilla, and a few tablespoons maple syrup to the milk and egg mix.

I was really looking forward to making this. The pictures made this all look so good! But it was nothing like I had expected :(
My kids did not like this at all. I had some burn,and the ones that were golden brown were still soggy raw inside. Not sure what I did wrong!
I always add cinnamon & vanilla, so flavor was there.
Sorry but wont be making again.

Excellent recipe.. my picky daughters loved them! I started making them before church on Sunday and also made them on Monday, Tuesday and today is Wed and I'll be making them again!! It is also a kid friendly recipe since my 7 yr old daughter helps with all the process! I also added a pinch of cinnammon to the egg mixture and also a tsp of vainilla. You might also need extra bread and extra corn flakes to finish up the egg mixture.  Since my bread was very soft I decided no to cut them in thirds but rather leave them whole. Serve them with condensed milk and strawberries. They are delicious! Thank you pamplemousse!

These were really good. A nice twist on classic French toast! The recipe made a lot of sticks, and they were very filling. My boyfriend said: "It's like eating French toast and a bowl of cereal at the same time." Like other reviewers, I added some cinnamon to the egg mixture. I also added a bit of sugar. I think next time I will use frosted flakes instead of adding the sugar. I also only slightly crush the corn flakes, this gives it more of a crunch. These are sure to become a new favorite breakfast for us, thank you for the recipe!! :D

I thought the overall taste of these was a little absent.  I added cinn., vanilla, and nutmeg to the egg mix and used Frosted Flakes but the toast still seemed to lack something.  The next time I ate them I sprinkled Cinn. sugar on top and added more syrup and they were much better.

They were a little bland so I added a little more sugar and some cinnamon.  Once done, I topped each stick with a thin slice of fresh banana. Its like eating a banana fritter. =) Delicious!

My kids (& hubby) LOVED these.  I used my own homemade wheat bread, sliced thick and cut into fourths.  It was a great way to use up some corn flakes and add variety to our usual "breakfast for dinner."  Be sure to watch the butter, as I did burn a few pieces.  Our house smelled like donuts for a day or two.  YUM!

I loved this.  After reading several of the reviews I decided to use Cinnamon Toast Crunch cereal instead of Corn flakes.  ALL RECIPES is my favorite site for new recipes.  I measure most of my ingredients by weight instead of by volume.  In this recipe, for example, I would be unsure of how much 2 cups of corn flakes were.  I just switch to Metric and see the weight is 55 grams and weigh out 55 grams on my kitchen scale.  This works especially well for fruits and vegetables that are shown in cups in a recipe.

This was really good! My family enjoyed it at our weekly "Breakfast for Dinner" this week. Love the crunch. I also love the "stick" idea. This french toast got cooked evenly throughout...something I've never accomplished before. I tried the egg/milk as written, and the result was bland. I added vanilla, cinnamon, and a bit of nutmeg....awesome. I'm adding this to our menu more often. Thanks Pamplemousse!

Awesome recipe!  Just made them this morning - of course changed it around to work with what I had on hand.  Used Texas toast that I sat out on the counter before I took my morning walk.  Bread was pretty dried out by 8 am when I started to cook.  I used 6 med. eggs, 3/4 C. milk, 1 T+cinnamon, 1/2 t nutmeg,1 t vanilla.  I let the bread set coated while the griddle heated with 2 T margarine.  Once on the griddle I sprinkled cinnamon sugar on top.  We had enough egg mixture for 11 pieces Texas toast.  Of course I used about 4 C crushed cornflakes.  My husband spread pb on one, my daughter used butter pecan syrup, & I used reduced sugar syrup.  All were delicious.  It's definitely a keeper for our house!  The left-overs will be tried tomorrow in the toaster oven.

Eh, it was okay, but not that great. Plus, the crunchy coating burned a bit easily and it stuck to the toast in globs. By far not the worst thing I've eaten, but it's definitely not worth the effort for me.

These were so good! I did make some changes per the other reviews- added vanilla and cinnamon to the egg mixture and used frosted flakes instead of corn flakes- my husband devoured this! I served with "Blueberry Breakfast Sauce" from this site and it was one of the best breakfasts I have ever had. Thank you!

3 tips:
1. The smaller you crunch your corn flakes the better try stick 
2. Cook on very low heat so your bread cooks without your flakes burning
3. You're going to need 5-6 pieces of bread

These were a resounding YES in my home. Everyone loved these. I made 1 1/2 times the recipe and they were gone in about 20 minutes. My husband said he didn't want any and then kept walking by, picking one up, and just munching on it like a granola bar. All I heard him mumble as he walked away every time was "erhmmmm, thesh ish guoud"! He did it 5 times so they must be. :)

For those who "burned" the toast, use 1 Tablespoon butter and 1 Tablespoon vegetable oil to keep the butter from burning. Your toast should turn out fine.

I thought the ratio of egg to milk was outstanding! I have never been able to get it just right like that before! But like others, I added a teaspoon of vanilla, a pinch of cinnamon, and a pinch of nutmeg. I think it becomes too bland without some kind of flavoring. I didn't need to use that much corn flakes, but to be honest, I didn't even measure. I just poured some into a small bowl and crushed slightly with my hands. Delicious!

Definitely add vanilla and cinnamon to the egg mixture. Also, and less healthy but amazingly delicious addition is to lay a strip of raw bacon over each strip of bread and cook them together. The bread soaks up the flavor and makes a great breakfast.

Really good.  I did this with regular French Toast.  I wish I would have added a little sugar and cinnamon to the corn flakes.  And, I always add vanilla to the egg mixture.

Definitely needed cinnamon and vanilla, and even then it lacked something.  Maybe add sugar.  Not sure, anyway, they were good for the occasional breakfast.  I think little kids would definitely like these.

This was really good! I used my regular French toast method, which is 4 eggs, 2 Tbsp milk, 3 Tbsp sugar, and 1 tsp vanilla and then coated the sticks in crushed Special K cereal because I had some I needed to use up. What a fun twist on French toast! Thanks for sharing!

Definitely requires additional flavor (cinnamon, nutmeg, powdered sugar, vanilla, whatever you like) or using frosted flakes. And I recommend crunching the corn flakes into very fine pieces. Overall it was very good! Going to experiment with cinnamon bread next time.

My boyfriend introduced me to cornflake flake crusted french toast in when we went skiing in Vail for the 1st time and I loved it. I followed your recipe and added vanilla, nutmeg, and cinnamon based on other user reviews and my boyfriend said it was the best corn flake crusted french toast he's ever had!

Amazing recipe! Our new favorite breakfast... The only thing I changed is using Kellogg's Crunchy Nut cereal instead of normal Corn Flakes. 

CAUTION: If you follow the recipe's directions of two minutes per side, you will burn the sticks (on Medium heat). Two minutes worked on my stove.

I didn't have corn flakes on hand, so I used rice krispies and added cinnamon/sugar to the cereal mixture; and added a little vanilla to the egg/milk mixture.  Texas toast worked well, as they are nice thick slices of bread. Big hit with the kids!

My family really enjoyed this! It was a welcome change from regular french toast. I kept the temperature low enough as to not burn the cereal but hot enough to cook all the way through. My family said next time I make this they want to try it with frosted flakes for the added sugar.

These were pretty good.  I added vanilla and cinnamon like others because that's how I like my french toast as well.  My husband really liked the crunch.  Next time I'll add a little more vanilla and cinnamon.

Super Yummy!  My family LOVED them.  They taste almost like maple donuts, but way healthier.  I used wheat bread and left them whole (cuz I'm lazy), and I added a little cinnamon and vanilla.  I don't think I'll ever be satisfied with regular french toast again!

I make this recipe at least once a month.. I  make it in the electronic frying pan (square one).   Crush the corn flakes to your preference.. sometimes I do fine or coarse or somewhere in the middle.  It always comes out great and none left.  Kids love it.  The kids help with the corn flake crushing.  I put the corn flakes into a plastic bag and use a cup or rolling pin to crush.  Note: 2 cups crushed is more than 2 cups not crushed.  So I measure 3 or so cups from the box and I get the 2 cups crushed.

This is a fine recipe. However, I recommend adding 1tsp Vanilla and 1 tsp Cinnamon to your mixture.  Use a whole slice of bread.

Keep adding cinnamon to your egg mixture as it gets used to make sure there is a little in every bite.  Enjoy.

Kids loved these for breakfast this morning. I used crushed frosted flakes since thats what I had on hand I honestly think you can use any type of cereal you may have on hand which is a nice way to use up the last bits of a box. I made a double batch and froze some for an even easier and quicker breakfast!

Not too bad but my son wasn't super thrilled with them and I personally didn't care much for them.  Part of the problem is probably because I use cornflake crumbs on my oven baked chicken and it just reminded me of that too much.   I may try other cereal variations but probably stick to the egg on bread variety.

Lacking of flavor. Needs something sweet in the mixture maybe some vanilla. My 11 year old daughter liked alot.
