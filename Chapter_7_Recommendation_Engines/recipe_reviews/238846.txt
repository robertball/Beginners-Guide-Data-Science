Excellent.  I didn't want to go through my entire life never having experienced the pure joy of fresh fish topped with a perfectly made brown butter sauce!   I thought I had walnuts on hand but didn't.  It worked well with pecans.  So delicious.  I will try it with walnuts in the future.

Very good.  Easy to make, this recipe is good for about 3 servings.  I think I put to much salt in it though.  I will be cautious next time.  Thanks

I doubled the recipe because I wanted to serve with a whole steelhead trout we smoked for Christmas Eve and we found that doubling the lemon juice was too much. I would definitely make this again but keep the lemon juice to 1/4 cup if I doubled the recipe.

simply AMAZING.  I did make a few substitutions,pecans instead of walnuts and dill instead of tarragon. Served with wild rice blend and broiled tilapia. All my husband could say between bites was "Wow, this is SO good".  I will definitely make this again.

Made almost as written and served over Lingcod. I burned the walnuts on my first attempt and had to start over. Second time around, it was perfect. I did use half the amount of lemon juice called for and am glad I did because 1/4 cup would have been way too tart for us. Taste wise, we didn't care for the tarragon in this sauce to go with the fish. We aren't fans of black licorice though, but have had other tarragon sauces and enjoyed them. I don't think the amount of tarragon is too much and that it's simply just a taste issue for us. Next time I'll follow this technique and use a different herb. Overall, the sauce was ok and flavors seemed balanced, but that amount of lemon juice would be overpowering and neither of us enjoyed the use of tarragon in the sauce.

Absolutely delicious. I chose pickerel fillets because they are local and wow, the toasted walnuts really go well with this dish. I used 1 tsp of dry  tarragon because I hadn't any fresh tarragon. Still wonderful!  And Chef John is correct- it's still healthy because there isn't a heck of a lot of butter in it.

I would give this recipe 10 stars if possible! I’ve made this sauce 3 time’s now with Sockeye Salmon, and it’s a huge hit!

The first time I made it burnt the walnuts, the second time was spot on. I liked it a lot and I challenged it with Talipia and it made it better.
