I made the recipe as written but only 3/4 of the recipe.  I put it in a flat bottomed bowl for ease of eating. I topped it with vanilla yogurt.  It was delicious!

I made this as written with the exception of the water, I totally forgot it and I don't think that it's needed. It's a nice, quick treat when you just want a little something sweet. Thanks for sharing your recipe.

Don't know what I did wrong...probably a lot.  I only had a Fuji apple, so maybe it was not juicy enough?  The crisp part never got crumbly in the first place, and didn't change after the initial cooking.  Then the apple slices were hard after the first cooking.  So I added 1 t more of water and nuked again. Still no good.  Then I added 1 t more water and covered to steam the apples a bit.  The end result was undercooked apples and "crisp" so gummy I couldn't eat it.  Oh well, nothing ventured, nothing gained!

A great breakfast I made with fresh Honey Crisp apples! Of course I had to make 2 since it called for 1/2 an apple.

It was wonderful!  I always use Honeycrisp apples for optimum flavor, but my daughter likes Granny Smiths in apple desserts.

I was looking for an easy dessert recipe to use up some of the extra apples we have. I had to try this one when I saw we had all the ingredients on hand, with the exception of butter so we used margarine instead. I also forgot to add the water but I think it did fine without it! We will be making this again, but we will probably add a scoop of ice cream or a dollop of whip cream next time.

This was so amazing! Instead of using sliced apples I used plain apple sauce and left the water out as well as adding fresh sliced strawberries to it. Completely divine and perfect for after getting wisdom teeth out. Thanks for sharing!
