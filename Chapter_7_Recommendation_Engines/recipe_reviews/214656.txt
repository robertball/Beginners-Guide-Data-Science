This chex mix is a sweet treat. Its more like poppycock rather than chex mix. But I made it and served it at a kid friendly party I had with some friends. Everyone loved it even and especially the adults! I made it in a disposable turkey roaster and put it in the oven instead of the microwave. I couldn't find chocolate chex mix so I added m&m's and threw marshmallows in it as well. I've had a few people ask me for this recipe since then. I'll definetly be making it again!

Very good, quick and easy to make gluten free (swap rice, cinnamon or honey nut chex for the wheat chex and leave out the cheese crackers).  Also, if you want a laugh, change the quantity to 15 servings and it calls for 43 cups of chocolate chex!  Wow!!!  LOL!

interesting snacking... it didn't last long.  Had to sub some kinds of cereal as we don't have some of the suggested kinds in Canada. Used shreddies, chocolate mini shredded wheat, crispix.

Very good and easy! Love the sweet & salty combo. I did add about a teaspoon of Worcestershire sauce to the sugar sauce and I think it was a great subtle addition.

This mix is amazing!  I used Rice Chex instead of wheat because that's what we had.  I think it needs the wheat for the different texture.  Also next time I want to add buttered popcorn along with the cheese popcorn, to give it that real Chicago "Mixed popcorn tub" taste.

Mildly sweet caramel flavor and salty mix, but not candy-like.  It works well for any occasion.  Caution: can be addictive!

I found this to be more sweet than salty.  I am going to add pretzel sticks and peanuts to see if that creates the saltiness I was looking for.  It is not bad, just not what I thought it would be.  

The cheese popcorn is overpowered by the caramel flavor, as are the cheese crackers but to a lesser degree.  I used molasses instead of brown sugar, and I do not recommend this.  The caramel flavor was too strong.

I made this thinking it would be a sweet and salty mix, but it was more like caramel COVERING the sweet and salty.  I don't think the cheese-flavored items took well to being in cahoots with the caramel flavor, but if you dig that combination, then go for it.  Maybe it would be better if I had used the brown sugar instead of the molasses?
