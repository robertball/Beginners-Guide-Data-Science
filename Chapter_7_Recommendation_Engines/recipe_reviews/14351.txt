This twist on a chicken salad is absolutely fabulous!! I add more fruit and chicken than the recipe calls for to add a little more substance (also try adding grapes- yum!) I also add only about half of the dill. Try serving over a bed of mixed greens-- SO GOOD! My husband loves it! He asks for it ALL the time - and he HATES salad!!! :) A+

I loved this recipie.  I didn't think my husband would like it because it mixes meat and fruit (a definate not with him) but he really liked it too.  I served it on crossinats with fresh lettuce from the garden.  I replaced the pecans with sliced almonds.  Used 2 large chicken breasts, next time I'll use 3.

I made this for some of my family that were visiting. The only thing I did not do is add the dill. I'm just not real crazy about dill. I served it with croissants/green leafy lettuce. Everyone, including myself, enjoyed it very much.

Waaaaaay too much dill! But the canned fruit was really nice. I added about a cup of macaroni to try to balance out the spices.

Great simple salad. I put it on top of my salad - just greens with some vinegar, oil, salt and pepper. The buttery croissants were a good addition.

Wow, what good chicken salad.  Used more fruit than was called for; 11oz. oranges and 20oz pineapple.  Skipped the sugar as it already sounded on the sweet side, subbed walnuts for the pecans, and halved the dill.  Served in flour tortillas.  YUM.

This chicken salad was a hit at a brunch I made for friends.  It was just the right blend of fruit and chicken with the crunch of pecans.  And it can be made a day ahead!  This is a winner.

This is delicious. Most of the time I can't wait to let it sit overnight I have to eat it the same day. I didn't even think I liked dill that much but this is a great blend of flavors including the fruit too. When I think of chicken salad I think of this recipe.

This is delicious, Ive made it twice in a week. Use more fruit and be sure to drain it well. Great with almonds too.

i love every part of this recipe and i can't believe its only been reviewed 33 times! this isn't your normal chicken salad but its so so good. letting it sit over night is key -- tastes good on the same day but tastes even better the day after. we also used 3 chicken breasts. instead of pecans we used chopped walnuts. love it!

I can't even put into words how incredible this recipe is.  We have made it countless times.  I usually serve it on a bed of lettuce on a nice buttery croissant.  I use a low-fat mayo, and have used crushed walnuts, and slivered almonds in place of pecans (when I don't have them).  It really doesn't matter...this chicken salad is just scrumptious!

Most of my family enjoyed this meal (except the child that doesn't like pineapple or foods that are mixed together).  It gets the 5 stars because my 13-year-old loved two things about it.  First, it would be ready quickly for dinner and second, the taste.  He had four servings.  If I made it again, I'd add some celery and grapes.  The addition of wild rice would also be a nice option.

I didn't care for this at all.  The dill didn't seem to go with the fruit.

I made this for a potluck lunch at my office and my co-workers loved it! Everyone had second helpings, and many of them asked me for the recipe. It's so easy to make, and great for BBQ's. I served it with wheat tortilla wraps or sandwhich rolls, with lettuce and tomato. I didn't use the dill weed either but it still tasted fantastic. I think I might use apples and almonds in the fall for a different twist. Thanks for a great, easy solution for BBQ's and office parties.

I'm so glad I made this! I had second thoughts on combining dill with fruit, but this blend is wonderful!  I cooked my chicken in garlic and molly mcbutter, didn't use as much mayo as the recipe called for, and doubled up on the nuts.  I'll definitely be making this again!

I made this for a lunch get-together and people said that it was "pretty good."  It lacked flavor (even after adding a bit of salt to it).  Next time, I will stick to my normal normal chicken salad recipe.

I am VERY picky when it comes to chicken salad, but when I made this recipe along with a key lime cake recipe I found on this website for a friends birthday, I thought I had died and gone to heaven.  It is absolutely perfect and I wouldn't change anything about it.  I would suggest making enough for dinner too, your going to want more.

My husband and I love chicken salad. This was too sweet for our liking and the dill seemed out of place.  We are going to stick to our favorite recipe from this site Becky's Chicken Salad.

Very good summer chicken salad! I did not intend to deviate from the recipe but I noticed I had a (8oz) light mandarin orange flavored yogurt on hand, so I used about 3/4 the container mixed with the mayonnaise and left out the sugar. It made a very smooth and light dressing that complimented this fabulous recipe.

I JUST made this and even with canned chicken (I used 2 cans) and not sitting, this is so delicious!!!  I added about 20 grapes cut in half and walnuts instead of pecans.  My sample was on a mini croissant.  I can't wait to try it again later after it has a chance to sit for a while.  What a wonderful summer treat!

This was okay. I expected it to be better. I'm not sure I would make it again. We prefer the Holiday Chicken Salad from this site.

Made this as part of a luau menu and all loved it. I left out the nuts (food allergy) and went lighter on the dill. Also, used Purdue's precooked chicken strips which saved a lot of time with the chicken. A wonderful summer salad!

The nice thing about this recipe is that you can use almost any fruit in place of the cherries.  I will use this recipe over and over again.

Overall this was good--very refreshing tasting. I thought the dill was fine in it. It just seemed to need something for a little more flavor, not sure what. I liked it though. PS: with the leftovers, I added a little sour cream, and it gave it just the right tang.

Nice flavor, also didn't have dill so omitted it. However, it did turn out more soupy than I expected...for next time i will increase the pecans and decrease the mayo. But otherwise tasty

I made this recipe exactly as posted and thought it was just okay.  My husband agreed.  Because we both like dill we were hoping to like it a lot.  I have other chicken salad recipes that I like better so i won't be making this one again.

I made this last evening and did not leave over-night as suggested,  Had the leftover today for lunch and it was much better.  The flavors got together and it was a better salad.  I added yellow grapes and celery.  Next time I will try 1/2 regular mayo and 1/2 light mayo to perk it up a little and also add salt and pepper which was not mentioned.  It was flat without it. I will make again for my bridge group for our pot luck.

LOVE LOVE LOVE this recipe!!  I made this for a home party and served with small croissants.  It was gobbled up and nearly everyone asked for the recipe ??!! The only changes I made to this recipe were to add red seedless grapes and one stalk of celery chopped.   Will definitely be making this again!!

Dropped the dill and sugar and it was still a great chicken salad. Easy, sweet, and so yummy - can't beat it.  If you make ahead it's even better but  leave nuts out as they lose their crunch. Add right before serving.

This is a great chicken salad recipe. I had leftover blueberries on hand which I added. They provided a nice extra flavor and made the salad look very nice with the shot of blue color. Otherwise, I followed the recipe to a t. This would be great served at a party on small puff pastries, I think. Definately a keeper.

This is good, but I deleted the dill weed and added some fresh scrapings of ginger.   Perfect!

I made this for a luncheon at church and received rave reviews with everyone wanting the recipe.  It is so simple and the fact that it needs to be made the night before is a big help on a busy day.

YUM! I used halved green grapes, pecans, leftover roast chicken and just a bit of sugar. Will let sit overnight but is already delicious!
