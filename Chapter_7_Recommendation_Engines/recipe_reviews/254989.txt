Very good recipe, and easy to make.  Since the steps in the recipe are not detailed, I'll add a few tips.  It's better to use a squash that has a smaller seed bulb, as when slicing the bulb you will get rings or crescents, which can fall through the grill grates if you're not careful.  I sliced the squash into 1/2 inch thick rounds, and would probably do 1/3 inch next time.  I preheated the grill to high, and then lowered heat to medium after putting the squash on, to keep them from burning on the outside before cooking on the inside.  They don't really need any sauce or seasoning.  We opted for some pepper jelly and salt, which was delicious.

The easiest butternut squash recipe ever! Slice, baste and grill! No peeling I'm sold on this recipe. I had Italian dressing handy basting other veggies so I basted with that. Awesome! Thank you for sharing.
