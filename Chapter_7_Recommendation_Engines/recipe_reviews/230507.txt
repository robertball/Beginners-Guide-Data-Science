I thought this recipe was quick & easy to make. Though I found the butternut squash needed more like 15-20 minute to saute and become lightly browned. I think there is opportunity to add more ingredients to make this less bland and add a bit more flavor. As a vegan I left off the cheese, and thought the recipe still worked. It was good cold too, as leftovers the next day.

I added toasted pumpkin seeds & cranberries.  I used tree shaped pasta and served the dish to our guests for Christmas dinner along side the Prime Rib.  It was a huge hit.  I agree with the review stating that it took 15mins to brown the squash.

This was easy and quite good.  I  made as directed but took care to dice the squash after reading the previous review.

This was pretty good. I will make it again. I will probably add parsnips or another winter vegetable to make it heartier. I added about a cup of Autumnal Pasta sauce which brought out the Butternut squash taste.

Good, but I would never dice raw squash - it's just too hard. I microwaved it for about 8 minutes, then diced. This had really interesting flavor and we really enjoyed it. We did add a pork chop to it for some protein.
