I'm happy to be the first to review this gem. Wasn't sure so I scaled it down 1/4 which was enough to steep in a pint mason jar and yielded about 8 oz. I did use frozen cranberries, accidentally found myself without the orange, and let it brew in the fridge. After four days, my only regrets are that I quartered it, and that I discovered this AFTER my Christmas Eve gathering. This looks beautiful and tastes amazing. I can't say enough about this. So far I've had it straight, with lemonade, and even with a little cider. Sipping straight up is my favorite....love it! Thank you for this gem!!!

Made this according to the recipe. Very good flavor. Mixed it with ginger ale and garnished with a couple frozen cranberries. Also good straight up over ice. Nice cocktail for the holidays.

Made this for a couple holiday parties and everybody loved it!   Very easy to make, although straining the cranberries got a little messy.  :)

Excellent recipe just as written!  I used a nut milk bag strain out the berries, much easier than a strainer!  Just wish I had made more.  It has a little tartness which is nice if you are like me and donâ€™t like your drinks overly sweet.
