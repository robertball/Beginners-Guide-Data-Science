Most of you know this, so ignore me if you do.  But the complaints about the dough being too sticky are simply the result of flour that has absorbed some moisture from the air.  With all pastry crusts you have to be judicious, adding half the liquid, then half of what is left, etc. until the dough has the "right consistency."  I live in Oregon where it rains most of the year, so our flour may absorb extra moisture, but you can't tell how much until you are working it.  In a really dry climate you might have to add a little extra water, but with this recipe that is unlikely.  Anyway, it isn't the recipe folks; this crust is terrific!

absolutely perfect- the crust turned out flaky, crisp and flavorful!  a little hard to work with, but well worth the effort.  just make sure to keep your butter frozen, your water/egg cold, and when it starts getting too warm, take a break and put the whole thing in the freezer for 15 min.

I made this recipe for a homemade deep dish chicken pot pie that required a 9x13 pan. It was EXCELLENT! I put about 2/3 of the dough on the bottom and sides of the pan, prebaked for about 5 minutes so the bottom crust wouldn't be soggy, then added the pot pie filling, top it off with the top crust. I baked it at 375 for 45 minutes. My whole family was very pleased with the taste and flakiness of the crust. Will make many times! THANK YOU!

This recipe makes the absolute best pie crust I have EVER tasted. I used a food processor and frozen butter and it turned out fantastic! I was able to make two double crust pie crusts. My berry pies turned out great.

My first time making a pie crust ... I had to make this one two times because I failed at it the first time. LOL Was due to the stupidity of the cook (don't ask!)& not the recipe though. On the second try (too embarrassed to explain what I did on my first try), I sliced my butter thickly & froze it for about 30 minutes & then let my food processor do the work for me. Uesd this in a recipe for Turkey Pot Pie & OMG was it ever good!  Thanks Becky for enabling this dumb novice to make a fantastic pie crust!

I've used the shortening version of this recipe for years - it's perhaps a little more flaky but this butter version FAR surpasses it in flavor.       You can fail with this recipe - in fact the "never fail" ones are the hardest pie crust recipes I've ever worked with.  I think they are  "never fail" because they never fail to taste great not because they are easy.      The secret is to make sure you blend the butter well with the flour, get just the right amount of liquid and chill this dough for at least 30 minutes.

This by far the best crust recipe out there and I've been using it for over 10 years.   It always gets rave reviews.  My husband refuses to eat apple pie but he'll eat my apple just for the crust.

I made two of these for my T-Day dinner pies. It was an easy recipe but it baked up not as flaky or tender as I had hoped it would be. The taste was good, however. The edges came out downright crisp even though I used a pastry shield and lowered the oven temp.

This is the best recipe I have ever used for pie crust.  My crust came out better than ANY pie crust I have had in years.  Once you make the dough, as a warning, it seems like it is a little too dry and crumbly, but it turned out perfect without any change to the recipe.

I grew up on this recipe -- my mother had worked in a bakery. We often used lard for savory especially or mixed lard and butter. After cutting in the butter/lard, place in refrigerator while prepping the next step.  To make it easier, I put the vinegar and 1 tbsp ice water together, whisk in the egg, then finish up with more ice water to get 1/2 c total of the mixture. Seems to get the egg more incorporated. It is dry here, so I have to just carefully watch the amount of water used. The ice water helps keep the butter in little pieces. I've even made this 50/50 whole wheat and regular unbleached flour with tremendous success. This crust is so good that people always eat it!! no leaving crust on their plate. I give the finished portioned dough at least 2 hours in the fridge in order to make sure any possible gluten strands relax. Keep bench flour handy for rolling out (bench, hands, pin). I've made this since an early teen. And, trick for the top on the upper crust: spread milk on it just to lightly moisten. If a sweet pie, sprinkle lightly all over the top crust with some granulated sugar. The crust becomes absolutely gorgeous with that bakery tip!! Enjoy!!

This is a great pie crust recipe.  There was a time when I thought I would never bakes pies again because I would get so frustrated trying to get the crust just right.  This recipe creates the perfect dough, and it tastes great.  I highly recommend this one.

I love this site, but I did not care for this recipe and I just had to comment.  I KNEW it had too much butter in it, but I made it anyway.  Sure enough, I had a sticky, globby mess that wouldn't roll out. I had to piece it together to get it into the pie plate.  After 10 minutes in the oven, the crust had pulled away from the sides of the pan, and it was scrunched in the bottom of the pan with butter sizzling all around it! This should be called "sure-fail pie crust"!

I cut this recipe in half...didn't need 4 crusts! This turned out really good...I like that it didn't have shortening in it...we have a cholesterol issue over here! Also, I used SmartBalance in place of the butter...I usually do that and have very good results!

Excellent crust, flaky and delicious.  I did need to use a bit more liquid, but otherwise it was just fine.

This pie crust came out excellent, it was easy to make. I selected this one since it had only natural ingredients and not some shortening in it which is difficult to find one with butter! It is flaky, easy to prepare, and worked out incredibally!

I made a mistake but it came out perfect.  I put 2 cups of Whole Wheat flour in separate bowls and added 1/4 tsp salt.  I cut in 1 cup of butter and then measured 1 egg, 1 tsp. vinegar and cold water...forgetting that this measurement was for 4 cups of flour, I put the whole amount into the bowl with 2 cups flour and the salt.  I was pleasantly surprised that the dough was perfect and very easy to roll out between layers of plastic wrap and very delicious and flaky.  I will use the same measurements again.  Sometimes mistakes are rewarding.  I may cut back on the butter and use 1 1/2 cups instead of 2 cups.  I will definitely use my "mistake recipe" again.

This crust was a total failure for me, and I am an experienced baker.  I believe the ratio of flour to butter is off, with way too much butter, because the dough was pulling together before I even added the egg and other liquid.  It turned into a sticky mess that I had to scrape off the pie mat. Couldn't even get it into the pie plate. I'm going back to the tried and true Betty Crocker recipe!

Well, as I was making this, I was planning on rating it a 2star - The dough was SO difficult to work with.  I admit that it might have been somewhat my own inexperience with butter pie crusts, my usual pie crust uses shortening.  We ended up piecing together a crazy looking pie, but the end result was REALLY delicious.  I still can't say I'll be using it again because it was so difficult, but it WAS yummy.

The ratio of flour to butter in this recipe is not what I'm used to.  Normally I use one part butter to three parts flour, whereas this recipe calls for one part butter to two parts flour.  After five minutes in the oven this crust seemed to turn to melted butter.  I feared the worst, but went ahead and used it anyway.  It turned out all right, but it was a bit crispy and not as delicate as my normal crust.  From now on I think I'll stick to that one.

Absolutely wonderful pie crust!!  I followed the recipe exactly, except adding a bit more water so that the dough would stick together better.  Flaky, buttery, crisp--- everything you would want in a pie crust! I made it for the blueberry pie: and it was SO GOOD. Will definitely make again!

Excellent recipe especially for pot pies and pasties! However flour absorbs moisture from the air so if you live in a humid area like me you might need to add a little additional flour to keep it from being sticky. Conversely if you live in a dry climate you might need a little less.

This is exactly like my recipe that I have used for years. It also freezes well. Roll out your crust and layer them on a pizza pan with plastic wrap between. wrap the whole pan tightly and put in the freezer. when ready to bake a pie just remove the crust and let thaw. Works great.

This review is from a NON-BAKER.  As much as I love to eat desserts,  I don't love baking. I had a craving for a yummy fruit pie and didn't want to purchase one from the grocery store.    Followed this recipe exactly, refrigerating the wrapped balls of dough for less then 2 hours.  I did have some difficulty rolling it out - but not too bad.  And I'm certain it was because of my lack of experience with homemade pie crust.  I did manage to get both pieces rolled out and filled my pie with a cherry- wild blueberry mixture (another review)  I have to say the crust was delicious!   Very flakey and tender and the the perfect flavor.  I may have rolled it a little to thin though so next time I'll be careful of that.   I could also use a lesson in fluting the edges.  I am so happy I tried this recipe after reading all the recipes on this website.  I will for sure be baking pie again soon - can't wait for Thanksgiving!!

I can't believe I made a pie crust that was sooo flakey and delicious!  Thank you Becky!  I tossed in some cinnamon and sprinkled the top with cinnamon and sugar and it came out PERFECTLY just as promised!  Easy to roll out, easy to handle- I didn't even have to chill it for longer than it took to cut up the apples.  Definitely a keeper!!!

Just tried this recipe for my turkey pot pie. I had made a pie recently, and was very unhappy with how it turned out. So when I saw this pie crust recipe, I was hopeful. It turned out great! I cut in the butter (by hand) half a stick at a time (4 sticks is 2 cups). Then I added the liquid by thirds. It made it easier to incorporate all of the flour evenly. I let the dough rest in the fridge, covered, as a large ball. I split the dough into halves. The key to rolling this dough is keeping it cold, using lots of flour, and rotating. I was extremely happy! The dough was easy to keep in one piece, and did not crack. My pies were delicious AND pretty! The dough darkened on the edge, and was tender and flakey. Absolutely wonderful! Will be using again!

I am pie crust challenged..I have tried at least 8 other recipes and  although they come out, they are hard to work with and I find myself disappointed at not "getting" it. I am not a quitter though, so I tried again this year and came across this recipe. I followed recipe exactly, but dough was very crumbly, so I did have to add more water, a little at a time, to get desired result. Wrapped it up and put in fridge. Rolled it out between lightly floured wax paper. I did not get it perfect yet, but it looked okay and baked up great. And it was delicious...

First time crust maker here and I had no issues with making it UNTIL I was ready to bake it...no directions :( so it was my mom to the rescue - she suggested I bake it at 350 for 10-12 min or until slightly brown....

Everyone loved the flakiness and flavor of this crust.  I used it for 4 different types of pies and was wonderful.  Not mushy and held up well without being tough.

It was easy to make, but it still tried to stick to my non-stick coated rolling pin, and seemed heavy on the butter.  Even after I chilled it, I found it crumbling to pieces that I had place in the pie dish dish and then press together.  Not fun.

This pie crust is amazing! I want to bake pie all the time, just so I can use this recipe. I am not very good at rolling out the crust, but that's just my own folly, I assume. Delicious!

Excellent! Loved this recipe, used twice today, made a blue and blackberry pie as well as a chicken pot pie.  This shows the diversity of this excellent pie crust!!  I was especially happy that I found one that didn't use shortening (I forgot to pick it up and didnt want to run back to the store).  It came out wonderful for each pie that I made and I will definitely be using it again!  Thank you so much for the recipe!

OH MY GOODNESS!  I love to cook and bake and have NEVER EVER made a good crust before, until today!  I divided the recipe by 4 to make just a single crust (even measured the gram weight of the egg in order to get the right amt.) and it was AWESOME!  I used the crust for the Sugar Cream Pie I recipe on this site.  It too was amazing!  THIS IS MY NEW CRUST RECIPE!!!  FOREVER AND EVER!!!...me again...made this tonite for Irish Beef Handpies...WONDERFUL!!!!!!

No matter what I put in this crust--quiche, peach pie, chicken pot pie--the crust is the best part! I've always thought making pie crusts from scratch was a hit-or-miss kind of thing, but this really was "no fail," and it helps that it tastes like any good pie crust should taste: light and fluffy, perfectly flaky and buttery! MM! Now I'm looking for excuses to put SOMETHING in one of these wonderful crusts!

This was AWESOME! My husband dreaded my pie crusts but this was sooo flaky. I used two for pies at Thanksgiving and used the other two balls for turkey pot pie the next day!! Goes well with sweet pies or main course meals!

This was a very easy crust to make and it turned out *great*! I didnt have to use the whole 1/2 cup egg/water/vinegar mixture though and I put the dough in the fridge for about 1/2 hour before rolling it because it was so moist. I will use this again!

Made this once when I was out of shortening and I'll probably never go back either (unless I'm out of butter, ha-ha).  Hubby is a real "crust freak".  Last time I made this crust, he could care less what the filling was and just wanted to eat the crust.  Thanks for a terrific recipe!

I've been using this recipe for a few years now. As a bona fide pie crust KLUTZ, I can say that this has revolutionized my pie crust! Simple, never fails, the proportions are perfect! Delicious, light, and very attractive in color and texture!

I was really really skeptical of this dough, cause I had the same problem, it was way too sticky. But after I put it in the fridge for 24 hours and rolled it out with flour.It was perfect,everyone loved the crust,I made it with the sauteed apples on this site.

I mixed the ingredients in a food processor for ease.  The dough seemed awfully wet- I was forced to use LOTS of flour to roll it out- even on a silicone baking mat.  It did turn out nicely, though- with both a quiche and a pie.  A good find overall

everyone loved it, I put in into a rhubarb pie (also found on this site) and my family said it was the best rhubarb pie they have ever had, they said the crust was the best part (now that's different) they loved the filling also, dont get me wrong, but the crust is what made it the best.

Tips for Novice bakers!  Freezer your butter then grate (can be done ahead). Add to flour in batches and toss to coat butter with the flour (takes place of food processor)

This was a very easy recipe and it came out just as expected. I found the the amount of this recipe comfortably made enough crust for 2 chicken pot pies (double crusts) and for a pumpkin pie (no top crust) and a concord grape pie (no top crust). I think it would a bit tricky to spread this recipe out to 4 pies with all double crusts though. I also made it 50% whole wheat flour which I think came out extra well in the chicken pot pies.

I am not sure what happened with my pie crust but it was a failure. I followed the recipe exactly and the pie crust was awful to work with. It would tear very easily when rolling out and when transfering to the pie pan. I got so frustrated that I had my husband roll it out because he has worked in restaurants for many years and is an excellent cook/baker. He even said this was the worst pie crust he has ever worked with.

You just gotta love the flavor of a butter-based pie crust.  This one was good; I'm not sure what the vinegar and egg really bring to the party, but, hey, it was good.  I did need a little more than the recommended water to get it to come together.

This is the first time I've ever attempted any kind of homemade pastry.  I made the dough and then rolled it in four balls and chilled them.  Once I got ready to use them, I had a hard time rolling it out, so I ended up just pressing it into the pie pan.  Then I realized I'd have to somehow put a crust on top of the pie.  So I rolled it as best as I could and kind of pieced it together on top.  It didn't turn out pretty, by any means.  However, it had a good taste.  Maybe a tad dry, but still as good as or better than the pre-made ones.

This crust was phenomenal! it was so easy! i will definitely make this in years to come.  the only problem i had was the cooking time to blind-bake it for my lemon meringue pie "grandma's lemon meringue pie" on this site.i ended up doing 8 minutes at 400 F. thank you soooo much for this recipe!

I made the whole recipe in April and made a pie with a top, then forgot about the other half of the dough until October.  After all that time in the freezer, then a day and a half in the refrigerator, this pie crust was still tasty and easy to manipulate into the pan.

This is an excellent recipe when you want to make your pie decorative. The crust is easy to work with.  I made cut outs with the pastry, placed them on top and they were beautiful.  Tasty too!

This crust was ok. Calls for way to much butter. I found it too buttery for my families taste, almost tasted like a fried pie. Not what I wanted at all. I will stick with  Grandma Ople's crust from now on

I used to hate to make pie crust because I could never make it roll out nicely the first try.  This recipe solves that problem.  It holds together and tastes great as a single pie crust or a beautiful top for a double crust pie.  Try it, I know you'll be pleased with your result, too!!

I'll definitely be using this recipe again. The trick to this crust is to work fast and roll it out as soon as you can make a dent in it with the rolling pin. It baked up beautifully and tasted great. I used a blend of whole wheat pastry flour and whole wheat bread flour. I rebaked my mince pie in an attempt to bake off the brandy (live and learn!) by placing it on a cookie sheet and covering it well with foil. After nearly 2 hours of extra baking, the crust had browned a bit more and stayed nice and soft.  I might try it with a non-trans-fat margarine (like Smart Balance) for all or part of the butter next time, to cut down on cholesterol. Really good!

Wonderful pie crust! Flaky, and simple. I needed to find a good pie crust recipe, because my grandmother uses lard in hers, and I just wouldn't have any of that. As they say, butter is better! Thank you for sharing!

I wouldn't be calling this a "no fail" pie crust, especially if you're living in the pacific northwest! The crust was VERY difficult to work with because of extra moisture in the air. I had to freeze the dough and play with it a bit to make it flexible again. It was VERY difficult to work with...had to flip over the paper I rolled the dough on to get it not to break!

But on the other hand, it's very tasty! I'll either try adding less water next time or add enough flour for the dough not to stick to the wooden rolling pin!

I used this recipe yesterday to make a blueberry pie. It was absolutely the best pie crust I've ever made and I've been making pies for 50+ years. This is the first time I've made pie crust with butter. I'm so glad I was out of shortening. I think this will be my go to recipe from now on. It's amazingly good and moves pie crust up to a new level.

I made this pie crust for the first time today.  I do bake a lot, but have had little luck with my pie crusts.  This recipe made an absolutely fabulous pie crust!! The dough was easy to work with, and there certainly was not too much butter.  However, I used chilled butter and my flour was stored in the fridge, so it was cold, too. This will be my go to recipe!

Great flaky pie crust with enough heft to stand up to really juicy apples and pears. I had a hard time rolling out the dough — it kept tearing — but I think that was more user error than anything.

Outstanding, flaky, melt in your mouth crust! My husband usually hates pie crust, but he wont leave a crumb behind of this one. I have only used this crust for pot pies so far. Can't wait to try it with sweet holiday pies.

First off, I read the reviews and made sure to use frozen butter, and keep everything cold. Got to the liquid phase and was surprised; it was extremely dry. I ended up having to double the water before I could get it to even pretend to stick together. Even then, it fell apart when I rolled it out and tried to move it. I had to piece it together in the pie dish and press it back together. It turned out okay and tasted good, but it was more work than I had hoped for.

You're probably thinking I used too much flour, but I'm quite certain I didn't, since I was paranoid about messing up the recipe and double checked all of my measurements. As for humidity, it was not dry in my area/home at the time,  so I'm not really sure what phenomenon caused the crazy dryness.

Wow! Made this with chicken pot pie. So good. Light and flakey. Soft. It's an absolute  keeper. I cubed and froze the butter overnight. Worked really hard to keep the mixture cold every step of the way including an ice pack under the bowl. Maybe overkill, but worth the effort. By the way, my dough was very crumbly. So much so, I wasn't sure it would even rollout, but after forming (crumbly) balls and refrigerating for about 6 hours, they worked.  Received rave reviews!

I've never had pie crust look so good. A word of advice, before you roll it out, put it in the fridge for an hour or in the freezer for 30 minutes so that the disk can cool and harden to make it easier to roll out.

This is my go to recipe for pie crusts, we have made it 3 years in a row for the holidays. It keeps well in the fridge for later use, dont pre roll  it out just leave it in a ball and wrap in in plastic wrap until you are ready to use you it then let it warm back up on the counter until the dough is workable.

This recipe was great! I made half the recipe and just blended and divided the egg and it still turned out great. Since I live in a dry climate I needed to add another 1/8 cup of water to make it perfect. I would recommend this recipe to anyone.

I halved the recipe, because I was making just 24 mini tarts. I used only 3/4 cup of margarine, and I did as another reviewer suggested -- I went to just under the 4 oz line in a glass measuring cup with water, then added the egg and vinegar to that and whisked.   

I put the flour, salt, and butter/margarine in a food processor, then slowly added the egg/water/vinegar mixture, just a bit at a time and pulsed the processor.  It came together very nicely.  It did seem a bit sticky, so then I added a tablespoon more of flour, then another two tablespoons of flour, and then it was perfect.  It came out easily in one ball, I wrapped it in plastic wrap and put it in the refrigerator.  After a couple hours, I took it out, rolled it out easy as pie ;-)

The tarts were delicious!  I'll definitely use this recipe again.

I've used this recipe for every pie I've baked the last 5 years.  We absolutely love it!  We've used it on about everything you can think of. Thanks so much for sharing it!

I have made this a number of times and it is certainly easy, and has a great flavor.  The only shortcoming is that it is a difficult pie crust to roll thin without it tearing unless mixed / kneaded for longer than implied in the directions.  Mixing / kneading for a longer time builds the elasticity better and solves the problem.

the crust was very difficult to work with after refrigeration.  The taste was fine, but a little tangy.  It didn't work very well as a base for a pecan cheesecake.

I loved this pie crust,I used it to make chicken pot pie and it turned out flaky and even the bottom crust cooked perfectly. I will use this crust for my pies too. Thanks for sharing.

Very easy to make. Like that you do not need shortening.

This crust came out perfectly for me.  It was a tiny bit wet (probably humidity) but the flour on the rolling pin and the board was enough to correct it.  Coated with egg and sprinkled with sugar and it was beautiful.

I decided on a four because in the end it did come out allright.  I had a hard time mixing in the water, I had really wet clumps and then dry crumbly parts.  Maybe I'm just not very good at making pie crusts.  It really did come out okay in the end so I may come back to this one after I try a few others.

Delicious, but doesn't quite stretch to cover a 9" round pan as promised. But very easy to make and use. I would agree with the "no fail" part as I don't do much baking.

This worked even when I substituted whole wheat flour! Halving the recipe made enough for 4 double crust pot pie crusts.

This pie crust recipe is wonderful, and it is easy too! I used the fresh pie crust with the blackberries I picked from the woods. Great recipe!

I am someone unused to cooking anything homemade. I found this recipe difficult to follow but I am sure that it is more to do with the fact that this recipe is food and not calculus.
