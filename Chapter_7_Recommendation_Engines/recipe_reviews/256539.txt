12.26.16  Followed the recipe to the letter and wouldn’t change a thing.  The batter consistency was absolutely spot on perfect for pancakes, and you get layer upon layer of banana nut bread flavors, nothing wrong with that!  Ended up with 12 pancakes, so in this house that would be four servings.  Well, maybe sometimes three (OK, or maybe even two, depending on who’s at the table).    CoOkinGnUt thanks for sharing your recipe, it’s a keeper.

Great recipe although I did make a couple of changes to suit our tastes.  I looked at my banana bread recipe that I have been making for 40 years and it did not include the cinnamon or nutmeg.  I left it out.  I thought this looked like a lot of sugar for a recipe that included banana, so I only used 1 tablespoon of brown sugar. We don't normally have almond milk, so I used regular.  Finally, I let the pancake batter sit for 1/2 hour before using, which I read makes fluffier pancakes.   Oh, man were these good.  I will make these again.

I've never made pancakes from scratch before - always used a mix. This was so good I'll never use a mix again. I now want to make all kinds of pancakes. I made them for just me for lunch. The only substitution I made was using milk instead of almond milk. They were delicious. I  froze the leftovers,  took out 2 the next day, popped them in the toaster, and they were just as good if not better than the first day.

This was delicious. Even my picky son loved it, but he always wants mini chocolate chips in it too, so only his portion got that! Ha.  The only thing I modified was the nutmeg. Nutmeg is VERY potent and a little goes a long way.  I used a part of an 1/8th teaspoon and still could delicately taste it.  Consistency was good, but I wish I had let the batter “settle” a little before cooking it to fluff it up more.  This will be made again.

Delicious and moist! I doubled the recipe because I had four bananas, two teenage boys, and one husband. I doubled it exactly, and I wouldn’t change a thing!!! No leftovers!

This recipe is perfect, used it to the letter (except I added some chocolate chips to the mix, which I highly recommend!) As long as your bananas are overripe enough, you won't need any extra sugar. I've made pancakes from scratch before that involved a bunch of extra steps and ingredients but these came together quickly and were delicious. I had leftovers and have found that they also reheat really well!  Thanks so much for sharing!

these are awesome and really tasty
I followed the recipe exactly and my husband and 1 year old both loved them. the banana in the batter will burn quickly, so the pancakes might look blackened but they taste delicious. I poured the batter sparingly and flipped the pancakes almost too early because I didn't want the banana to burn. they came out flat but very tender and squishy. will definitely use this recipe again

Amazing! The only changes I did were brown sugar instead of white sugar and didn’t use nutmeg. Used 1/3 cup batter per pancake. Heated up the skillet to medium and each pancake was great!

I will absolutely make this again but eliminate the sugar. The only thing I alslo find is most recipes in the site don't indicate what a serving is; one or two. My husband had three and then made three more.

These were so good! I left out the nutmeg because I didn’t have it, but I loved it! They were very fluffy and soft and the taste was so good. I ate them plain and loved them and also had them with some syrup and enjoyed them. Following the recipe, I made 11 pretty good sized pancakes, so I will half the recipe next time, but I will definitely make again.

We liked these as an alternative to plain pancakes.  Made as written except used regular milk and only 1 T. sugar, 1/4 t. cinnamon and nutmeg because I didn't want them to taste to spicy/Christmas-like.  Watch them closely so as not to burn.  With the addition of bananas they could burn easily.

It doesn’t need the sugar, if you’re making pancakes you’re putting toppings on it anyways. And I marked another star off for not using whole wheat flour. I made both of the substitutions and it is by far the best pancake recipe I have ever had. No sugar, whole wheat.

Delicious.  Moist, even warmed up the next day.  I make a double batch and we eat during the week for a quick warm breakfast. So good.   I rated 4 stars because they tend to break while flipping, even when almost cooked through but adding another egg fixed that.

WOW!!  Sooo good!  These are the best pancakes I have ever made.  So glad I found this recipe.  Family LOVED them & gobbled them up!  Only small change I made was cut sugar down to 2T and did not use walnuts (didn’t have any on hand).  Otherwise, followed recipe to the letter & they turned out perfect & delicious.  Used a 1/4 c of batter, yielded about 13 pancakes.

This was awesome.  I was out of regular milk, so used canned coconut milk.  It was great!   It was a little liquidy, but don't know if that is because of the coconut milk??  Anyway....  will make again!

Very tasty.  I replaced the sugar with Stevia, added an extra egg, ommitted the milk and used natural yoghurt instead.
Really light and fluffy.

This is a good recipe which I will be making again.  I doubled it, as I had a lot of bananas to use up, and unfortunately forgot to double the egg (!), and all I had on hand was skim milk, which I am sure affected the texture of the batter, but even so, these were tasty pancakes!  Oh, one change I did make was to use half whole wheat flour mixed with the all-purpose flour.  I like the added fiber it brings to a dish.  If you like banana nut bread, you'll love these pancakes!

Seriously so good! I made it exactly as written, except I only had 1 banana. These don't even need sugar if you have really ripe bananas.

They were great. I was worried because the batter was thinner than most pancakes I've made, but I turned my griddle down to 300F and they cooked up soft and brown. The banana flavor was strong and tasted great with maple syrup.

Yummy, my son ate so many - they were so delicious. I did use regular 2% milk because it's what I had in the house.

So so good :)

This recipe is amazing! Perfect pancakes! I omitted the nuts because my daughter doesn’t like them but they are just as amazing without the nuts. I’ll be saving this recipe!

This recipe is definitely a keeper. I tripled the recipe and it made 16 pancakes. The batter was very thick, even after I thinned it a bit with milk. I completely forgot the butter, and next time I will leave it out on purpose just to save a small step. I cooked them over low heat and they did seem to take awhile to cook through in the middle, but they were delicious. Thanks!

Delicious! The only change I made was that I reduced the sugar to 1 tablespoon. In my opinion, these were the best banana nut pancakes I have made. I do think they would be just as good if the additional sugar was eliminated altogether.

The only change I made was to add some cocoa powder and a lot more sugar to the recipe. Otherwise I followed it to a T and it turned out yummy. Oh I add to add in more flour cos I took some off the recipe cos I added cocoa powder. Don't know why though

Delicious, light, and fluffy!  A made a couple changes, soy for almond, lemon juice for vanilla, oil for butter, pure maple syrup for sugar, 1/8 tsp salt, 1/4 tsp cinnamon, 1/4 tsp nutmeg, and I let the batter sit for 30 minutes as my grandmother taught me to always do.  I guess I changed just about everything.  A couple more tweeks and I will post a new recipe. Thanks for the inspiration!

These are great pancakes! Followed the recipe with two additions and one change: added chocolate chips and about a teaspoon of lemon juice, reduced the sugar to 2 tblsp.  Loved them and will make them again!

The best banana pancakes. No need to add anything to it. One suggestion: Chop the walnuts very tiny because these pancakes are so fluffy and moist that if there are big chunks of walnuts, it takes away the fluffiness feel.

Delicious & a new family favorite! I made a quadruple batch to feed our big family of pancake connoisseurs. Everyone was extremely satisfied! The only tweaks were using regular 2% milk, brown sugar, & extra spices. I also added fresh blueberries to the batter for the last few pancakes... HEAVEN!! I encourage you to give this a try!

My family of 5 loved it.  I followed the recipe and they came out fantastic.  I mashed the bananas first and then use an electric mixer to make sure the bananas were blended well.  I had no problems with the pancakes turning black.  They pancakes were a hit.  I will definitely do this one again with no changes.

Yummy.  Good recipe.  These came out really nice.  Easy to prepare but more importantly easy to cook too.  Thanks!  Will make again.  *Update - I made it again 1/18/19.  I used cow's milk because I did not have almond milk.  his makes 6 large pancackes.   No Leftovers.  :)

This is definitely a keeper for my family. I didn't have almond milk so I substituted 1% milk which I normally buy and added 1/2 tsp. almond extract. 
My hubby gobbled these down and there were no leftovers. 
I hate rating a recipe when I have made a change/substitution so forgive me but I am sure many others won't have almond milk on hand either.

Great recipe!  Leftover batter was just as good as on the 1st day.  I didn't have almond milk so I subbed a mixture of 2% milk and  plain unsweetened kefir.

This is a keeper. Only changes: Coconut milk plus a little water and 2T. Plain yogurt. Also put all of the wet ingredients in blender first followed by all dry. Blended until smooth then let sit for about 5 minutes. They really are delicious!!!

Great recipe... but instead of almond milk I used evaporated milk, and I made a waffle instead of pancakes. Delicious
