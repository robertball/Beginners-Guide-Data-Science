This is my favourite meal I made in all of 2011. However I made a few key changes. I added canned crab which i also marinated in butter, I used red bell peppers instead of green which gave the sauce a nice colour, and I used fresh minced garlic instead of garlic powder. Try it out!

My husband and I LOVED this dish! We used something called "seafood medly" from CostCo. It was a combo of Calamari, mussels, shrimp, and scallops. THIS WAS AMAZING ALL TOGETHER!!!  We only has a half package of Angel Hair pasta, but we made it all work togther. 

As an extra, when soaking the seafood in butter, I added a couple shakes of Garlic Powder to the butter and this added that extra flavor to the seafood.

This recipe is amazing! I omitted the peppers and cumin and added chicken cubes cooked with the shrimp with garlic and onion powder and lemon pepper seasoning then I added broccoli and added some lemon juice to the Alfredo sauce! It was very good! My 4yr old asked for seconds! :)

My mom and boyfriend loved it!  I would add in a little extra sauce next time, to make it more creamy, and DEFINITELY don't cut the spaghetti noodles before serving--it takes away from the effect.

Delicious!! My husband loved it! My picky 13 month old liked it too! I made a few changes to the recipe.  I only used half a bag of pasta so that the pasta was creamier with only 1 jar of sauce. If someone uses the whole bag of pasta, they will definitely need 2 jars of sauce. I used Ragu alfredo sauce and it was just as good. Then I only used 1 pound of shrimp instead of 2 pounds. I will definitely be cooking this again in the future!

Had to use fettuccini since that is all I had.  This was excellent.  Soaking the shrimp in butter was definitely the key.  Shrimp wasn't rubbery even when it was reheated as a leftover.  Will definitely make again and will probably soak the shrimp in butter for any other recipe I use that calls for shrimp.

I changed it (doesn't everyone?) a bit.  I used a frozen shrimp/scallop combo, and I added a fresh chopped tomato (heated up with the shrimp in the last minute of cooking, and I added some cooked chopped broccoli too.  The family loves it!  I didn't cook the shrimp first, I just cooked the garlic then added the shrimp/scallops, then the rest of the ingredients.  When the pasta was ready I mixed everything together.
