This was not nearly as hard as I thought it would be--I really had fun making them! Needless to say, everyone loves me now! Dessert is in the freezer whenever anyone wants it. And these sandwiches actually are better after a week or two (and the cookies are softer). I will definitely make these again. THANKS!

Oh my!!! These are fantastic. I've made them with all types of ice cream and frozen yogurt - so far, chocolate mint has proven the favorite! When using chocolate ice cream, spread peanut butter on the cookies for a great variation.  I accidently burned a batch of the cookies, used them anyway, and they were great - they softened up nicely in the freezer after a day.
A 1/2 gallon of ice cream allows for about 1/2 cup per sandwich. Make sure it is soft or you may break the cookies.  Since I now keep a constant supply of these in the freezer for a quick dessert, I make them just a bit smaller and get 20 sandwiches out of a recipe (1/3 cup ice cream each). No one except my waist really notices the size difference and my children and husband love me!!!

Fantastic! I bought a round container of ice cream and cut the cardboard off so that I could just slice the ice cream into circles rather than scooping it out. Yum!

What a wonderful summer treat! Mashing the cookie with the palm of my hands was too messy, instead I had used an empty can of mushroom soup ( washed and cleaned) I used a can opener and cut out both ends of the can and used it as a cookie cutter, WOW the cookies came out a bit larger (when baking leave at least Â½ inch apart) but in perfect sizes. 
I also used spumoni ice cream. My party guest was amazed and made request to make some more for there house warming party. Thank you for these great cookies! P.s. The cookies taste even better after 2 days.
