Delicious and easy to make. I let little ones help add ingredients, roll and choose our flavors. We ended up with a batch of cresents, a batch of raspberry turnovers and two sets of cinnamon rolls. There werenâ€™t many left by the time the last pan came out of the oven!

I followed the recipe almost exactly except I had 4% milkfat cottage cheese.  Used my KitchenAid to mix the butter/cottage cheese and switched to the dough hook to add the flour.  I turned it out and did the kneading/folding and I had my doubts, but it came together and I could still see the lumps of cottage cheese.  I chilled it for about 5 hours, and rolled out one portion and made some sweet and some savory pieces.  They turned out nice.  Next time I'll roll it thinner, I think 1/4" was too thick.  It doesn't have the many layers, but it is light and tasty.

I decided to give this a whirl using Bob Red Mill's gluten-free baking flour, despite the fact that I knew it was unlikely to work since it is the gluten that gives puff pastry its wonderful texture. I am pleased to report that it does work! OK, maybe it's not as light and flaky as "real" puff pastry, but man, this is far and away the best recipe that I have found. Since it was a test, I only made 1/4 of the recipe and made the dough into veggie tarts as a main course for dinner. My family (only 3 of us!) gobbled it all up in one sitting and asked me to make it again the next day!
