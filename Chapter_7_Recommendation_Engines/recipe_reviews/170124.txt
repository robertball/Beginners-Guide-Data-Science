I cut the recipe in half in order to make one quiche.  Be warned!  The filling is not enough to cover a 9 inch pie crust!  Still, my family enjoyed it and I think it would be very tasty with some different touches (spinach or maybe chopped broccoli).

Wow.  What an intense melding of delicate rich flavors!  The mushrooms really popped in this recipe unlike any other recipe I can bring to mind.  And oh so cheap! I found cream/sausage/mushrooms all for around 1$.  The crusts were 2$ (you could easily save money by making your own: 1 cup flour, 1/2 c shortning, 1/4 c tepid/warm water, pinch salt. Mix w/ dough cutter or two forks in crosswise motion against each other till makes little crumbleys and then work into ball with the tips of your fingers. Trick is to get to a ball and then roll out. no need to knead! Then roll out to 1/8 inch thick. Your good to go. This makes 1 9inch crust, repeat if needed.) This is easilly a winner to serve for friends or family as the mmmm factor of richness plays off the back of your throat tickling your savory taste buds.  Umami all the way!

Flavor was GREAT!  Made this as one of two flavors of quiche for a party of 20 for baby shower for my niece today, and frankly I liked this one the best!!  The only thing that made this a 4 rather than 5 star, is that I thought the egg/liquid ratio was for perhaps 1 quiche rather than 2.  I doubled it (the egg/liquid) in mine, (and perhaps could have even tripled it).  In my opinion, it would then be perfect for 2 quiche!!!  Flavor was VERY good and simple ingredients!!!

Very good recipe!I like the idea that it makes 2: One for Saturday dinner, and one for Sunday lunch!I used the deep dish pie shells, so I doubled everything but the lemon juice, and added onion. Tasted great! Next time I'll add some garlic and maybe a little green pepper.

This is delicious!  I made this for Easter morning.  I loved that it made two pies and I was able to put them both in the oven at the same time.  I didn't realize when I bought my pie crust that I bought deep dish crusts!  So I cooked an extra half pound of sausage, another carton of mushrooms, and double the egg and cheese mixture.  Since I wasn't planning to double (except for the mushrooms, since they always cook down so much) I didn't have enough of the heavy whipping cream so I substituted regular whipping cream, which worked just fine.  I'll be using the regular whipping cream from now on.  This dish was creamy and smooth.  My husband asked that we eat this for more than just holidays!

My mother in law sometimes adds red peppers to this as well, which my husband loves, but I like it better with just the sausage and mushrooms!

Fabulous quiche and I already had one I liked a lot.  This one is elegant with savory flavors that we should have eaten at the dining table instead of the coffee table.  The filling is really only for 1 deep dish pie as noted by others.  My husband liked it so much he got up out of bed and ate it for a midnight snack.  The best!

This was a really good quiche.  Used my own pastry to make one large quiche rather than 2 smaller quiches.  The combination of flavors was excellent, never used parmesan in a quiche before, added a totally different flavor than the usual cheddar.

This recipe is fantastic.  I made just a few changes.  I sauteed onions with the mushrooms, used turkey breakfast sausage instead of pork, used two 9-inch deep dish pie crusts.  In order to make two, I simply doubled the recipe.  I also prefer cheddar over parm so i used that instead. I put the cheese on top of the mushroom/sausage mixture and then poured the liquid over it all. My daughter and husband loved it!  I will definitely be making this again!

This is so yummy!  I made enough for 2-9 inch quiches, so I tripled the cream, eggs, flour, butter, and lemon juice.  I had a little bit left over, but doubling it didn't cut it.  I used a pound of italian sausage and a pound of mushrooms.  I also only used 1/8 c butter for the mushrooms, and there was plenty of liquid (and I did dump the drippings from the sausage out before adding the mushrooms to the pan).  I also used refrigerated (not frozen) crusts, pressed down into my own 9 inch dishes, which may account for the need for more egg mixture.  I did also add fresh baby spinach to the top of the quiche before adding the egg mixture.  I probably used a little more that a cup of shredded parm on both quiches and top it with fresh ground italian seasoning.  My family loved it!  :)

Very good flavor!  I added onion and spinach, (sauteed with the mushrooms), and put it all in one pie crust.  I didn't have any heavy cream so I used milk and it worked well.

I split the ingredients between two 9" shells. Seems like the recipe is for one shell, not too. I have two pie shells half full and the crust baked browner than I would like.

Such a success!  Fantastic recipe, man loves it, kids love it..great for leftovers and packed lunches!  I made a few adjustments, Increase to sausage to 3/4 pound and increased the mushrooms.  Added some broccolini for color and a little fresh sauteed garlic and onion.  Very tasty! Can't wait to make again!

We absolutely loved this quiche. I omitted mushrooms in one for my hubby (and doubled them up in mine!) and everyone was pleased. I served it for two different sets of guests and got great comments all around.

A huge hit with my guests, made it for the first time and it came out great! I doubled the amount of sausage it called for, and found it a good thing I did. I also drained the mushrooms after I cooked them in the butter because there was a lot a liquid. In the future, I will make a little bit more of the cream mixture than I did this time, but otherwise, it was amazing! Cooked it until the parmesan was golden brown on the top!

I am giving this 5 stars because the ingredients were perfect for the 2 pies. I did adjust seasonings to our taste but the final product was just the consistency and flavor that we wanted. Big hit here.

Great basic recipe. It's like the best soup stock, only the best quiche stock.  I added onions, and sweet red and orange peppers, but what made this really good, was I took the time to make an actual pie crust! Wow This is really good.

Loved this recipe. Very easy to make with ham, bacon or sausage and any cheese you like - e.g. sharp cheddar. I've also added peppers to the mix. I use 3 eggs too. Great base. It's my kids favorite.

OMG this was awesome. The only change I made is that I used Fontina cheese as Parmesan Cheese can be too salty for me. It is the best thing I ever made.

This is hands down the best quiche ever. The only change I made was to substitute Italian sausage for the pork sausage. Just remove the sausage casing and prepare as directed. I served it for dinner with garlic bread. Leftovers are great for breakfast or lunch.

I used 2 Jimmy Dean sausage rolls; combo of hot and reduced fat with 8oz mushrooms. Used no salt butter. Didn't need to add salt and pepper with the hot sausage. Next time I might add green onion. My family likes thicker quiche. It was a hit.

One of the best Quiches I've ever had.  Great combination of the sausage and mushroom is what makes this Quiche stand out.  Easy to make and just plain yummy!  Thanks for sharing this one!

Great recipe, but made a few modifications. People are right that it makes one 9-in quiche at best. Recommend you don't use any butter, and drain/pat dry both the mushrooms and sausage before adding.

A wonderful, very tasty recipe!  I replaced the mushrooms with olives, was very yummy!  On this recipe it called for two crusts - you need to double the  egg-milk mixture.

Really tasty!! I used deep dish pie plate as others suggested and only made 1 pie (I used original recipe amount for filling). I also sautéed a small onion in a little olive oil prior to adding my sausage. Thanks for sharing!!

I should have listened to others when they said there was not enough filling for two pies. Double the ingredients! If you follow the directions then you'll find it needs more egg and cheese. I also skipped the lemon juice because frankly it made no sense. I won't use this one again.

This has good flavor but the recipe calls for 2 pie crusts.  The first time making this I used two 9" shells but there wasn't near enough egg mixture to fill both shells and they turned out "flat."  To me, a quiche should be light and fluffy but this one is not if you use two shells. I'm not sure using 8" shells would help either.  It seems like there is an error in the recipe on the amount of egg mixture.

I subbed 8 oz. diced ham for sausage simply because I'm not a fan of sausage. After reading reviews, I did not buy deep dish frozen pie shells but doubled the eggs and cream anyway. Every drop fit perfectly in the two regular shells. I sauteed the mushrooms in only 2T. butter and next time will not add the 2T. melted to the filling. Also had to bake about 50 min. to have them cook through, puff up and brown a little. Got several comments that they tasted delicious. Would make again.

Loved this recipe. I didn't have enough mushrooms so I added chopped onion and a bit more sausage. It was the perfect amount for a 9 inch deep dish quiche. This is now my favorite quiche recipe. Thanks.

Very good! I subbed Greek yogurt for the cream because I  always have yogurt on hand, I also added peas as others have added spinach or broccoli which I'll probably use next time. Also fried the Italian sausage with a couple of tablespoons of onions. I made half this recipe as there was only two of us, there was enough left over for lunch. From the comments here I used a 7.5" casserole dish and it turned out about two inches deep.  Will make this again and use a little more yogurt to moisten it up a bit, or maybe not drain the sausage.
