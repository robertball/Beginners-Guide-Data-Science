I enjoyed this recipe. My husband and i are on a diet and this was a nice dish. You can also grill chicken and make this into a wrap. Very good.

It was very oily with the dressing.  Good flavor though. I was the only one in my family that would eat it, including my husband, who will usually eat anything.

I really liked this recipe and so did my family. The only thing I would change is the quantities. I have a family of four and it was way more than we would eat at even two meals.I was able to use homemade salsa and home made dressing on it. Great flavor though.

We made this for 175 women for a fundraiser luncheon. It was well received, great color and flavors. Nice to  be able to make it ahead to marinate the flavors.  Many people asked for the recipe. Thanks Minute Rice for submitting it.
