No matter how good this soup is, it is NOT Andalusian Gazpacho. I should know, I am a Spaniard. No cumin, no beans, no celery, no basil, no oregano and no parsley. The tomatoes are real, fresh ones, not juice. And the onions should be regular, not green.
Don't mean to be vindicative, just accurate...

A review from Spain. This is a recipe for a delicious vegetable cold soup, I made it yesterday. But it's not a Andalusian Gazpacho, sorry, it's just inspired. In the Gazpacho there's not: celery, navi beans, canned tomato juice (only fresh tomatoes), cumin, parsley, basil or oregano. You can add those ingredients for a very good, but all different, could soup.

If you have leftover cucumbers and it's hot outside. Make yourself some of this cold soup. Made it the night before and when I came home from work it was ready to eat. Plus you can freeze it! Makes 10 servings. Was very good. I added some red hot to mine.

Although this was easy I ended up throwing out all the leftovers.  I think using fresh tomatoes rather than canned juice will make a big difference.  I would reccomend trying a recipe with fresh ingredients before this one.

Excellent recipe for a very refreshing summer soup. A touch of red pepper or a few drops of Tabasco give some extra zip.

Delicious, easy, and inexpensive.
I did, however, simmer for a short period then 
chilled and served.

Ok, not bad but not a Andalusian Gazpacho that I lived on for eleven Summers in Jerez, Andalusia.  Cut the beans, juice and most of the spices and add a tall cold glass of Tinto Verano

From someone who lived in Seville, this is a great recipe, unfortunately it is not andalusian gazpacho.  Like other reviewers have mentioned there are ingredients here that are never in andalusian gazpacho (or gazpacho in general).  The ones that bother me most are the navy beans, celery, basil, and tomato juice. 
But what is MOST glaringly missing is the STALE BREAD.  On top of that andalusian gazpacho is blended to a puree.  I like salsa-esque gazpachos, but andalusian gaspacho is not of a salsa consistency.  
Keep it simple: fresh veggies (tomato, cukes, green & red peppers), good olive oil, stale bread, red wine or sherry vinegar, garlic, salt & pepper.

Delicious soup! Makes a big batch so it is good for freezing to have later. I had difficulty finding navy beans, so used great northern beans instead, and it worked out fine.

We have made this recipe over and over again over the years since we discovered it.  It is very light and healthy and makes a great meal on a hot summer day.  We had some leftover asparagus last night which I chopped up and added in, and it turned out great!

Despite the high yield and simplicity of the recipe, the beans ruin it. According to me.
