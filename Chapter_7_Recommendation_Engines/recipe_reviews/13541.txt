These were very good. I added some garlic in with the mushrooms. I would shorten the cooking time on the onions to 25 minutes.

These were good.  They smelled fantastic while they were baking.  I would reduce the amount of time that the onions boil.  They were a little sweeter that I expected but it was a nice, different side dish.

These weren't everything I'd hoped they'd be. My mom and I made them when we had some friends over who were on a pretty specific diet. No one seemed too impressed by them, but they weren't bad at all. I would make them again if I needed to use up onions or something, but not just for the recipe itself.
