I cut this recipe in half to ten servings. Instead of water, I used unsweetened Tazo vanilla rooibus tea and I doubled the amount of spices. I also used pecans instead of walnuts. I made muffins out of this instead of one loaf--I did get 12 muffins from one recipe. Baked at 350*, these were done at exactly 20 minutes. Very moist and flavorful pumpkin bread recipe.

I used dried cranberries instead of nuts and coconut oil for the oil. I did not have all the spices so I only used nutmeg and cinnamon and added an extra teaspoon of vanilla. I also used pumpkin that I roasted instead of canned. Everyone loved it.

I'm sorry to give this a low rating, but it didn't come out well in my bread machine. I'll have to update my rating when I make it again in my regular oven.

I used half the amount of sugar (brown sugar instead of white), and it was still quite sweet, so I'll with that proportion in the future. Also, I used one mashed banana to replace about 1/4 cup oil. The flavors were great, but the texture was kind of dense and wet, but that is likely due to my bread machine rather than the recipe itself. Will try again!
