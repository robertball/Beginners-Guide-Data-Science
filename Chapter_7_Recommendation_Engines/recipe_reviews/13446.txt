My Uncle remembered a cabbage soup his immigrant mother made as a child.  All he told me was it had rasins and prunes and short ribs in it.  I used Holly's rescipe as a base, and I boiled 1 pound of short ribs in 2 quarts water to make the stock, leaving the meat in the pot.  I also added 1/3 cup prunes and 2 heaping tablespoons of freash grated ginger to the pot about 30 minutes before serving.  Rave reviews from my uncle and my husband!  Thanks!

I've made this soup twice now with great results.  Served with fresh-baked bread (try the "Honey Wheat II" recipe on this site) and sour cream, it's a big hit for cold nights.  My Ukrainian-born husband raves about it and loves the sweet-sour zing.  He's a little picky and usually turns his nose up at my attempts at Ukrainian fare, but this was a winner!

I love this delicious soup; I put in 1/4C vinegar (instead of 1/2C) and use golden raisins. Sometimes I put in a slightly spicey sausage, sliced chunks: I boil sausage pieces in soup for a few minutes at the end before serving. Lovely next day...seems that flavors blend more after reheating. Don't skip the celery seed...adds to the unique flavor!

This recipe has become a favorite for me. A perfect recipe for the busy single (like me.) It's so easy and cheap without a lot of ingredients, yet so tasty! I love the vinegar flavor and follow the recipe exactly, but if you don't like such a strong vinegar flavor it's easy to play with the ratios of sugar or apple butter to vinegar. I sometimes add cranberries too. Thanks for sharing this recipe!

This cabbage was unbelievably good. It reminds me of the soup my mother used to make, before she stated to control sweetenning in her recipes.

Great sweet and sour flavor.  The recipe as is yielded soup that looked just like the picture (more cabbage than soup).  I added another quart of broth to get it to the consistence I liked.  Then I had to add a little more vinegar and brown sugar.

The concept is great, but even after cutting the vinegar in half, the soup was still way to sour for me.

I thought the vinegar taste was over powering....with the tart apples it was just too sour.  My husband didn't care for it much either.

I didn't have apples on hand so I left that out, but followed the rest of the recipe exactly. Both I and the hubby liked it. I will definitely make this again.

this tasted very good and was reminiscent of the pickled red cabbage you get in the glass jars in the store.  I forgot the apple butter but after looking up ingredients in homemade, realized basically everything I had in the pot was an ingredient in apple butter except for the ground clove so added a touch of it.  I agree that the addition of the celery seed and the apple butter(or clove, if you don't have apple butter) is essential to give this a bit of depth and complexity.  I honestly prefer this as a thicker soup with not a lot of broth and would actually even eat the cabbage portion of the soup cold as a relish or cold salad side dish.  thanks for this easy recipe.  was nice to have something different.

I thought this soup was really great! I had to make a few adjustments because one of the people I was making it for is a vegetarian. I used vegetable stock (I don't think it changed the taste much at all) instead of beef stock and I reduced the vinegar down to 1/3 cup instead of 1/2 cup. I was surprised by how much the soup did thicken up, so in the future I think I may add a little bit more stock or some water just to make it more soupy. I was also thinking about adding a little more apple too.

First time making a red cabbage soup, and it was very good. I did cut back on the vinegar to 1/4 cup (per some recommendations), and it was just tangy enough for me. I chose not to add the raisins. I didn't have apple butter on hand, so in it's place I used apple sauce to which I added a few pinches of cinnamon and cloves. Dark rye bread went well with the soup. It's like an old world recipe. Thanks MARBALET!

Wow!! This was excellent!  Even my boys liked it.  The balance between tangy & sweet was spot on for me.  My youngest would have liked it a little less tangy.  I will be making this often.
I did use beef short ribs to make my own broth and then used the meat in the soup. I also could not find apple butter so I used apple sauce and 1/8 tsp each of cinnamon and cloves.  Thank you for this fabulous recipe!!

After eating at my favorite German restaurant, I was determined to re-create a red cabbage soup they have. I searched all over the Internet and this was the only recipe that seemed similar. Left out the raisins and apple butter, hubby is diabetic. I used Splenda brown sugar and added smoked sausage and 2 handfuls of sauerkraut the last 20 minutes. Huge hit at my house! Will def be making again!

This is very easy and tastes very good. I didn't know what apple butter was, so I left it out completely. I used bacon drippings (not very much) for a little flavor. I used reconstituted beef stock, and it worked very well. This soup is such a pretty color!
