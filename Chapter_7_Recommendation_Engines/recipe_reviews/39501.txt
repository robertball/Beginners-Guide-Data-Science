My family loved this recipe. Really easy and quick to make. The only change I made was using less noodles.

This recipe was so delicious and easy to make!  Definately recommended! I can see it becoming a favorite in this house.  We love mushrooms so we added about twice as much mushrooms, and an extra chicken breast.

Yes, there's a lot of pans, but a delicious recipe! I made it the healthy way, with low fat, low sodium cream of chicken soup, 1/4 of the butter (used cooking spray), double the garlic, no onions, fat free Italian dressing, and whole wheat egg noodles. What I especially liked was the light taste--this recipe is not heavy or overpowering.

I love mushrooms, but I didn't think they fit in this dish. I also thought the sauce had too strong of a lemon taste. More so in the first few bites, it did not seem so overpowering after that. I thought the sauce was really good and could be used in other recipes.

okay, I didn't quite have all the ingredients for this to make it - I had to sub in cream of mushroom soup for the cream of chicken, and we didn't have any broccoli, so I used spinach instead. I only used about half the lemon juice in the recipe, and I must say, that was definately enough for my liking, and I love lemon! Using the whole amount would be over kill. The dish was okay, not something that I would be in a rush to make again. I think I was expecting something creamier - not what I was looking for.

This is fantastic! My husband and son are picky eaters and they absolutely loved it! I made it exactly the way it says to, and like others have said, the lemon juice portions are perfect. This is definitely a keeper in my house!

i thought this was delicious!  The lemon flavor is just tangy enough in the background and not overpowering.  I just cooked the broccoli in boiling water instead of steaming with more lemon, and I thought this was excellent!

A tangy AND lemony dish.  Don't know that those flavors go well with a cream base - at least to me.  Reduced the lemon as suggested, but still too much lemon, & paired with the vinegary italian dressing, it was overpowering.  Not enough other flavors to contrast or complement.

I took a cooking class in high school, and we chose to make this.. it was delicious! A little heavy on the lemon for our taste, but I've been making this since then, with probably about 25% less lemon juice over-all. This is my husband's favorite dish for me to make :)

This was a really tasty dish and quite easy too. I used spaghetti noodles as I didnt have egg, and it was still good. I would make this again.

Very good but some of the steps are easily shortened. For example broccoli doen't need to be steamed w/ more lemon juice. Also doubled the soup and milk for creamier noodles.

Delicious, although it dirtied up quite a few pans and you have to keep an eye on everything at once.  It is quite filling though, and has a unique taste to it.  I would definitely make it again, and plan to prepare it for my family when I return home from college.  I would keep my alteration of more garlic too.  I had to pare it down, so I cut the recipe in half, and changed it up slightly based on what I had on hand and personal taste.   I used 2 chicken thighs, 1/8 cup of chopped onion, 2 garlic cloves, 1 1/4 cup sliced mushrooms, fat free italian dressing, healthy choice cream of chicken soup, and actually left out the salt and pepper, which had no detrimental effects on the taste- it was still really good!  I also used fresh broccoli, which I simply softened in the microwave, and rotelle pasta.  The chicken mixture doesn't look that "pretty" so I wouldn't use it as a presentation piece.  It tastes like chicken strogonoff with some zip.  : D  Definately give it a try.

I didn't like this at all. Neither did my husband or children. I followed the recipe exactly. It had a strange flavor and man, the dishes I dirtied filled my entire dishwasher! The broccoli was the only good part and I'll definitely remember adding the lemon juice to the water before steaming my broccoli next time (thats the only reason it got two stars). Sorry to whomever posted this recipe. I'm glad some people liked it!

Very good flavors. Try it with rice instead of noodles for a  different spin. But this is great either way.

My husband loved this chicken, but I thought the lemon was just a bit overwhelming. You really have to like lemon to appreciate this. Interesting dish, though. Thanks for sharing. :)

This was quite good and very tangy!  I think the broccoli is what really made the dish for me.  I just used my steamer and did not add lemon to the broccoli.  The sauce on the noodles was especially good.  Very nice recipe.

This was an awesome recipe! I think it's one of the best ever. My family really enjoyed it! I have a very picky eater... he was hesitant to try this, but ended up loving it. We didn't think it was too lemony at all. LOVED IT!

Sorry, too much LEMON for us.  It was just too tangy.  I liked the chicken  mixture, but the lemon in the soup along with the "Zing" from the Italian dressing was just too much.  Maybe we just don't like "lemon" in our food that much?!?  ~ Anyway, thank you for sharing this recipe.  I WAS looking for something different! :)

This is my new favorite recipe! I absolutely adored it, as did the rest of my family! The combination of flavors was delicious. The lemon was subtle and added a little zing, unlike what some people said in their reviews. The leftovers were just as good as it tasted fresh. Thank you for such an awesome recipe!

Tried this recipe tonight with several of my own variations, but same basic recipe.  Instead of pasta, I used a sauteed medley of chopped broccoli, carrots, and zucchini (which also made this recipe carb friendly).  I then substituted cream of mushroom for the cream of chicken because I simply don't like cream of chicken.  I don't think I used 4 full Tsp of lemon juice in the sauce...just whatever half of a lemon works out to be.  Finally, I deglazed the skillet I sauteed the chicken in with just enough lemon juice to cover the bottom of the pan, and added the pan juices to the sauce which made it just slightly richer.  WOW!!!  What a super sauce!  This was a recipe that was so good that even though you were full, you couldn't quit eating it!  Everyone in the house, from the adults to the 10-year-old gobbled it up with not a morsel to spare!  And to think a teenager came up with this--what talent!

Oh my godness! It was great! I think now this will be my new favorite. It's good that i didn't listen to some reviews, that said, there is too much lemon for this recipe: i put one table spoon more for the sauce, ans it wasn't too much... Also, instead of one can of chicken soup, i use one chicken and one mushroom soup (mixed), creamier noodles. Next time definately more mushrooms. This recipe doesn't make 8 servings, no way...But it was delicious!

Not too bad - it was certainly gobbled up!  The only change I would make is less lemon juice and a little more seasoning on the chicken.

Really not bad.  The kids liked it so that's huge.  I skipped a step and just threw the broccoli in the boiling pasta water (I have to save time and pots in this house) and it came out great.  While not a gourmet recipe (which is fine, my toddlers don't prefer gourmet) this is something I will make again.  Anything to get them to eat broccoli is thumbs up with me.

So there were some problems. Like how many pots this meal took to make. I used 1 for the broccoli in the microwave (i only had raw broccoli), 1 for the chicken, 1 for the sauce, and 1 for the egg noodles. I also made the "Carrot Recipe" that night, so that was 2 more pans. I had to do some time management to cook everything. I also didn't remember to get lemon so I used lime. It made it kick! It was good though. I would add a bit more milk for the sauce then it says.

This was a very great recipe it was easy to do and everyone loved it. The zesty lemony taste to the chicken and pasta was great.

Made this and the whole family loved it!I think the lemon made this dish one of a kind, I used the leftover cooking sauce from the chicken, and incorperated it into the pasta along with the cream sauce for extra flavor and it made it even better!

MMMM!  This was very good with quite a zing!  I did not use Broccoli just because I do not like it.  I made it exactly otherwise.  Was so delicious, will definitely make it again!

A creative use of cream soup to make something other than the typical casserole.  We didn't love it, but it was definitely tasty and quick to make.  I made one change to simplify things - threw fresh broccoli in with the pasta for the last 2-3 minutes and didn't put lemon and butter in the water.  I don't agree that this recipe uses a lot of pots - it is pretty typical to use 3-4 pots & pans when making pasta and sauce.

I picked at this while I was making it, and by the time I'd finished I just didn't fancy eating it. I thought the Italian salad dressing was an interesting ingredient. All in all, I think this is an ok recipe; nothing exceptional. My husband liked it, and said he thought it tasted 'Chinesey.' I'd make it again if asked.

My husband loved the flavors in this dish.  He didn't even mind all the dishes!  Seriously, the amount of dishes wasn't bad.  It can be prepared quickly if one reads ahead on the recipe and has the next pot ready to go.

I used cream of chicken and asparagus, because I didn't have just chicken and it was fine, it would have worked with cream of mushroom as well.  I'm not wholly sure about the Italian dressing, it added an interesting taste but I'm not sure it was complementary.

This was tasty and different.  The family liked it.  I left out the mushrooms, to our taste, and used rotini pasta.  I also used pre-cooked seasoned chicken for fajitas and added it after the onions and garlic cooked.  Only complaint was that it took a lot of pots and pans/processes.  I doubled the recipe for our 9 family members and we had a lot left over.

This was a very interesting recipe.  I think I liked it.  My husband did.  It was very tangy with the Italian dressing and the lemon juice.  I would probably make again.  It certainly wouldn't have served 8 though.  Only my husband and I ate it and he barely had enough for lunch the next day.

i made this for dinner last night, my husband and i werent too fond of the dish. it was too lemony, overwheming and it was just really strong. i think it might be a bit better if i halved the lemon in the recipe, i recommend that. but we probably wont make it again. :(

This recipe was just ok. Hubby didn't like it at all and I thought it  was good but not as good as the meals I usually make. Still, I am glad I tried it.
