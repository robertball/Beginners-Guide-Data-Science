I really liked this dish but i thought that there was too much black pepper. It seemed to disguise the rest of the spices. We had so much of the blueberry sauce left over so i would recommend cutting it in half. The ingredients and flavors work very well with each other and we really enjoyed this recipe!

Hmm I thought this was pretty good and the blueberry sauce was delicious... If you use grey mustard instead of yellow remember that it's pretty strong and add quite a bit less mustard. We didn't have any problem with the quantity of sauce but I used more chicken (cooking for 4 hungry people:) and served it over some Thai red rice. I wouldn't recommend serving this to someone who doesn't have adventuresome tastes; It's a bit "spécial " but very tasty! Thanks! I also used fresh basil for the marinade but didn't notice the flavor when it was done.

I thought this was okay but my husband didn't like it. I'm disappointed because I had thought it sounded special and a good way to use up some blueberries. I didn't have apricot preserves so I used a delicious blueberry/raspberry jam. And I didn't have white wine vinegar but I did have a open bottle of white wine so I used that for the sauce. It certainly was easy but I don't think I'll make it again.

Awesome recipe! I decreased the amount of pepper to my taste. About a teaspoon! Also did not use any adobo sauce...all that hid the berry flavor and honey/ mustard...highly recommend send will make again! Would recommend you use all the herbs to taste not nearly what the recipe calls for especially for only 4 chicken breasts!

We enjoyed this dish and it was easy to cut this in half. I was initially worried about the amount of dried herbs called for but the blueberry sauce served with it balanced out the overall flavor. I did use a homemade blueberry-merlot jam in place of the blueberry preserves as that is what I had on hand.
