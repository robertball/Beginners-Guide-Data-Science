DELICIOUS! I had some leftover steak in the fridge and this recipe was a perfect use for it. I did season the steak/pepper/onion mixture w/ salt, pepper and garlic powder, just for a bit more flavor. I sprayed them w/ non-stick cooking spray and baked them until brown...perfect! I will def be making these again~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

It was okay, a little on the bland side. Next time I think I'll add some salt, a little more butter, and sauteed mushrooms.

These were KILLER. I used a combo of Swiss cheese and provolone, added mushrooms, and for the meat I used some thin cut sandwich steaks that were on sale, sliced into bite sized pieces. We inhaled them! Thanks for a great recipe!
