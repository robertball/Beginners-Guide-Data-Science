Yum!  this is a simple and yummy recipe.  Will definately make this again! the broth is very tasty.  Only four stars b/c sazon seasoning is mostly MSG.  Also, I'm not sure how much flavor the dried red pepper added.  this was an expensive ingredient especially since I have no idea what to do with the rest of the bag of dried red peppers.

Yummy and unique!  I have made this several times and my husband adores it.  It is very tangy and flavorful and the chick peas are not dry at all.  People are always very pleasantly surprised by this dish-its a keeper.

Love, love, LOVE this recipe; I used a tbs of bottled lemon juice, and doubled the cajun seasoning in lieu of the sazon(?) seasoning. I threw a little brown rice in and we had it for lunch; the kids loved it.

I had to make a few changes due to the ingredients on hand. I doubled the Cajun seasoning, as I didn't have any sazon. In place of the dried red chile, I used red pepper flakes. I didn't have garlic cloves, so I had to use minced garlic (therefore, I was unable to remove the red pepper flakes and garlic cloves at the end). Despite all the modifications, this was really good! Thanks for the recipe, Clint!

Nice flavors in this one, only change i made was to omit the sazon seasning (didn't have any) and just double up on the Cajun. I liked the tang from the lemon, overall a great side dish that could also be served with rice for a healthy but filling lunch the next day. Thanks for sharing!

Doubled the Cajun seasoning and did not use the sazon. This was edible, but not worth making again.

my wife made this and while edible, was not as flavorful as I was looking forward to.
