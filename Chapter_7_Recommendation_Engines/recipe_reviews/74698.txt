I tried this but made it a little differently.  I added fresh minced garlic to the dressing/soy mixture.  I used butterfly chops and browned them in olive oil for a few minutes, then sliced an onion and layered the slices in the bottom of a glass pan.  I put the chops on top of the onions and poured the mixture over them and cooked them in the oven at 375 for about a half hour.  The flavor was awesome and the chops were very tender.  I served it with spanish rice and a salad.

My husband is not crazy about pork chops, but he loved this!  Will definitely make again and might try adding some fresh herbs to the mixture since I love to experiment.

Very good & tender. I did change the way I cooked them. I don't have a skillet large enough to cook 6 pork chops at one time so I baked them in the oven at 350 for about an hour. Before putting the chops in the baking dish I sliced a big onion & laid the rings on the bottom of the dish, put chops on top & pour the sauce over all of it.  When it was done I took the chops out, poured the onions & sauce into a pot & reduced it by half. The chops topped with the onions was so good. My picky boys even ate the onions. Thanks for the recipe.

I've been doing something like this for over 40 years.   I slice some potatoes and onions, layering them in a casserole. I then lay the pork chops on top and pour Italian dressing over it all. I then bake, covered, at 350 for about an hour.  So simple and comes out delicious!

This recipe was awesome.  I quartered a large onion and added to the pan to cook at the same time.  When done, the onions were soft and flavorfull.  Also, to make the most out of this dish, once the pork chops were done, I took them out of the pan and added a bag of frozen broccoli and stir fried it for a few minutes..mighty delish.  Take the leftover juice and add to top of pork chop if they seem dry.  Be sure to adjust cooking time based on the thickness of the chop.  Will definitely make this again.  Thank you for submitting it.  Oh one more thing...I used the Good Seasonings Italian Dressing in the package...instead of the 1/2 cup of oil the package calls for...I replaced it with 1/4 water and 1/4 oil..in addition to the water amount it already calls for.

The quick-easy factor on this is HUGE. This is tasty and really quick. I agree with the other reviews, that the time is somewhere between 15 and 20 min. I would also use a frying pan that is only a little bigger then the size of your chops, I pulled out my big pan without thinking and the chops were not completely covered in the sauce. I also used lite dressing and soy... still yummy!

I marinate porkchops and chicken breasts in italian dressing (minus the soy sauce) all the time and I really enjoy them.  Combine this marinade with meat in a ziplock or plastic bag and refrigerate all day or for a few hours - the marinated meat is delicious cooked on the barbeque!

I really loved this recipe! I'm a college student and I like to learn new recipes to cook for my friends. The entire time I was cooking, I was afraid that the italian dressing would be too overwhelming, but it was perfect! The mix of dressing and soysauce evened out nicely.

I did marinade the chops for an hour and added minced garlic to the marinade.  After panfrying the chop along with onions, I added the rest of the marinade. It came out so moist and delicious! My problem with chops are that they normally come out dry so this was fantastic! Thanks so much!

Great recipe!  Didn't have 2 cups Italian dressing, so I used 1 1/2 cups (zesty) Italian and 1/2 c golden ceasar.  Used 8 thin-cut, bone-in chops and marinated them about 3 hours before baking them in the oven instead of using the stove. Even my picky 2 year-old ate an entire chop without any coaxing!  Thanks, will definately make again!

I am not a huge fan of pork chops but this recipe is just fabulous!  My boyfriend couldn't get enough!  I took on the advice of some of the comments and marinated the pork first..actually overnight and the flavor was great.  I also added shallots, as some recommended onions, but that was all I had.  Absolutely delicious!

This recipe is great. The prep work is easy and it's easy to make it into a low fat meal( fat free dressing). I'm not a big fan of pork chops but this has changed my mind some. I would make this for anyone and have passed the recipe on to my mom and mom-in-law

This was just wonderful!  It would make a great, but easy company dish.  Unbelievably, pork tenderloin was cheaper than chops at the store today.  I cut it up into medallions and seared them in some olive oil.  I removed them from the pan so I could put 1/2 of a cut Vidalia onion in the pan.  Then I replaced the pork, covered with the sauce (to which I added about 2 tsp of minced garlic) and let it cook covered 25 minutes on medium heat.  My husband agrees that this is a definite keeper!  Thanks for the recipe.

My boyfriend RAVED about this recipe! I followed the advice of the other reviers, adding garlic and onions to the marinade (Fat Free Nalley's Italian w/Kikoman soy sauce), let it marinade overnight, browned the chops first in a little olive oil, then covered and simmered for 20 minutes, taking the cover off for the last five to thicken the sauce. The SMELL of this cooking is fantastic. I was told that I MUST make this again (and definitely serve this with steamed brocolli and rice for a great quick dinner).

Absolutely love this recipe!  They had so much flavor.  I browned the pork chops first, then placed them in the crockpot for 6 hrs. on low.  They were wonderful!  Thanks for sharing.

Really good recipe!  The husband and kids really enjoyed it.  I did make a couple of changes.  I browned the chops in olive oil, put onions on the bottom of a 8x8 pan, placed chops on top of the onions, added some minced garlic to the sauce, baked in the oven for 20 mins at 350C uncovered, and added some cornstarch the last 5 minutes of baking to thicken the sauce.  Served with rice and broccoli and cheese.  We had alot of leftover sauce so I think next time I will half the sauce.  Thanks so much for sharing this fab recipe!

I agree with previous posters.  Minced Garlic in sauce.  Line pan with onions.  Bake @ 350 degrees for 30 min.  Added sauteed mushrooms to the sauce to serve.  Served over Uncle Ben's long grain wild rice.  Wowee........awesome and easy.

I made this eactly as written (except for quartering the recipe; I made two pork chops but they were small).  Couldn't be any easier.  Good quick marinade, love those!  EDIT:  I just used this with steak and it was great too!  I added 1/2 tsp of liquid smoke to it.

These were great. I have a mild phobia of underdone meat so I am always looking for a recipe that I can turn into something tender. My family ends up eating a lot of shoe leather :(. When I saw this recipe I was suspicious of it because it looked too quick and easy. I was out of almost everything, but I had 8 pork chops that I didn't know what to do with. I didn't have Italian dressing, so I mixed up (about) 2 1/2 cups of my best imitation. Per the other reviewers suggestions, I used a light hand on the soy sauce and marinaded the chops. Even though I did not do this overnight the chops still absorbed much of the flavor. I almost never add salt to my food and these were still not too salty, so I don't know why there is this complaint. I cooked the chops in my X-Large Pampered Chef wok (no, I don't work for them), medium/medium high, for about 20 minutes, for thin chops. Then I reduced to low for another 10 minutes. Because of the shape of the wok, I did not cover the meat with the marinade, but filled it only part way. I covered with a tightly fitting lid and turned the meat occasionally as directed in recipe. These may have been the only really tender pork chops I have ever made, certainly the most tender. I was shocked, I was sure they would be tough, but, no, they were just as tender as everyone says.

A super easy dish to put together, I was surprised at how flavorful these chops were, I used low-salt soya sauce, other than than I followed the recipe exactly and got good results.

I have used this recipe as a marinade for grilled chicken for many years, but never considered it as an alternative for pork chops!  This is a very tasty sauce (as I know from experience) and I would recommend this recipe to anyone.  It tastes much more complex than it sounds and it can make even a beginner cook seem like an accomplished gourmet when serving to friends and family--just do not let them know how simple this recipe is!  YUM-O!

We LOVED this recipe! I actually marinated the chops in the soy/italian dressing mix for a few hours as well. Then I sauteed 2 cloves of garlic and 1/2 an onion in olive oil. Then added the chops to brown. I put that mixture in a glass baking dish and poored the marinate over top. I baked for an hour on 375 but in hindsight I should have put it on 350 for about 45 minutes. Even so it was FABULOUS!

I made up this sauce and used it as a marinade and grilled the pork chops.  I saved a little sauce and basted the chops as they grilled.

Althought this was easy to make it was extremely salty for my taste almost to the point where I could not eat it.  I did use low sodium soy sauce. Will try again and see if I can find a dressing that has less salt too.

Liked this, but not sure I'd make it again. Made no changes. Maybe it's because I make my own salad dressings, and perhaps my Italian dressing is a bit "blah" or something, but despite the fact that it was good enough, it just wasn't as good as the raves suggested. It's nice, easy and quick, though.

Marinade over night (I also added a touch of lemon juice to tenderize) Cooked in 9x13 casserole dish over onions and green pepper (covered of course) basting occasionally. Great marinade and tender but most importantly easy if easy is what your looking for.

Very good recipe for being so quick!  Perfect for a busy day.  I did make it in the oven as others suggested and also put down the onion rings.  The marinade was delicious.

This was wonderful and so easy.  I sprinkled some italian seasoning directly on the chops browned them a bit first in olive oil.  Then I added the salad dressing and soy sauce and let simmer for about 20 minutes Hubby loved it said porkchops were my thing.

My husband and I didn't care for these at all.  The Italian dressing was too over-powering.  The chops did come out moist and tender, but we didn't like the taste.  Sorry!!

This was just okay.I thought it had sort of an odd taste. While everyone ate it, no one was raving or asking me to make it again.It was quick to prepare but I don't think it was worth it. thanks anyway.

Very Yummy Pork Chops is what it should be called. I made these last night. They were so delicious. I added cornstarch to the sauce to thicken it and use over rice. It was extremely greasy but it was good. Next time i will add some brown sugar to the sauce and see how that works. Thanks for the great recipe!!

Our family loved it. I did cut back on the amount of the dressing and soy sauce-low sodium to less then half. Added the onion underneath the chops.It had a bit of sweetness to the taste. We ate it with egg noodles and peas. Yummy dish!!

Great flavor! I used Ken's Lite Northern Italian and some Caesar dressing. Next time I'll marinate for several hours, although pork chops I cooked this time were a little moist w/out marinating. Definitely the easiest way I've ever cooked pork chops - will be repeating this recipe

hum, I never understand my problem with pork. some days I cook it great, others not so much. Mine was just tough. i know I had good product, so am not a fan of the cooking method. I did marinate mine for hours, but still cooked them on the stovetop because Iwas running out of time. just too tough. Like the marinade though.

Yum Yum!  Even my picky kids loved it!  The drippings were delicious over mashed potatoes.  This is definitely going in rotation.  Can't get much easier and less expensive than this recipe!  Followed the recipe exactly.

This recipe is great! When the chops were done, I removed them, and put some frozen stir fry vegis in the sauce. Then added some corn starch to thicken, and put the chops back in to heat for a couple minutes. Then served it over rice - YUMMY

This is a nice recipe-but beware not to overcook the chops. I used 1" thick chops and added a chopped onion. They were literally pink one minute and dried out the next. I would expec that with the thinner chops...but...oh well. The sauce is very nice, tasty with white rice. I would also recommend searing the chops beforehand. Overrall, nice recipe and easy.

OMG... were these good!  I had two Iowa Chops (about an inch thick) so I halved the ingredients.  I had to cook them about an hour and I took the lid off about 20-30 minutes ahead of time, and I'm glad I did.  The sauce reduced to a wonderful consistency and flavor.  (And, let me tell you, while it was reducing, I was really worried.  All I could smell was vinegar and so was prepared to just dump these into the garbage! LOL)  I served these with cheesy potatoes and a salad (with Dorothy Lynch dressing - wanted to stay away from anything vinegar-y).  A most excellent recipe Serina.  Thanks a bunch!

Really are yummy! I did change it just slightly by reducing the dressing to 1/2 cup and a few tablespoons of soy sauce, but that was mostly because I was using thin pork chops. My problem (like always) is overcooking the chops - when they're that thin, these cooked up in less than 10 minutes. And the sauce was great! Hubby loved it too. Made it with rice pilaf, perfect for the extra sauce. Will make again!

This recipe was awesome!  I always read all of the reviews before making a dish to get the tips of other people who have tried it before me.  Like the suggestions, I added the fresh minced garlic to the marinade, and then seared the chops in my cast iron skillet in olive oil for a few minutes on each side to get them nice and brown.  Then I took the chops out and added a sliced onion to the bottom of the pan before adding the chops.  I put the remainder of the marinade on top and then covered.  I also followed the other's suggestion of reducing the cooking time to about 20 minutes.  Next time I think I will even do them a little bit less, probably 16 minutes.  When they were done, OMG they were delicious!!!  The onions basically caramelized and then were a little bit sweet.  This is definitely going to be my new go-to recipe for pork chops!!

This was very easy and tasty with a touch of zing. I swapped out the soy sauce (didn't have enough) with a 1/3 of a cup of Worcestershire sauce was still yummy. Thanks for sharing!

I cooked this for the time recommended, and it was really dry.  The flavor is good but I can't eat it.  I am going to try again and cook for less time.  For this batch, I'll try cutting it up small and soaking it in the sauce.

Used wishbone Light italian dressing and reduced sodium soy sauce. Sliced 1/2 onion and put in pan first. Lay pork chops on top. Added 1 tsp of minced garlic in to dressing. Poured sauce over chops and covered. Simmered about 25min. Also used boneless pork sirlion chops. So good!! Made white rice and spooned sauce over rice.

Really good, super easy, lazy night dinner.  Followed ingredients, covered, brought to a boil and quickly turned down to a very low simmer for about 30 minutes, turning chops 3-4 times.  Then uncovered for another 10 min, but not sure uncovering made a difference.  Chops were very tender.  I feel that the sauce ingredients could have been cut in half though.

I made this recipe exactly like it calls it for, did not change anything. I would consider these, alright pork chops, instead of yummy. They are different from the norm and a change of pace. Was not really diggin the tanginess of it. Thank you for the recipe.

I made this exactly as written. BUT, I browned the very thin boneless chops in olive oil with garlic. I browned them until they showed brown pan marks, and were pretty much cooked thru.
I added the sauce and cooked another 20 minutes on high, with a cover. It did cook down and continue to brown and came out a LOVELy brown color.  they were so tender and tasty, hubby loved them, I did 9 chops in a skillet. BUT they were a bit salty, I would cut the soy by half or more or maybe switch it to a teriaki. I would also drain the oil before adding the sauce, there was a bit of oil in it. But excellent and something differnt and fast than just pan fryiing or breading. Leaving off one star for the salt. Did triple my intake of water that night.

Very good, although a bit salty.  Next time I will use low sodium soy sauce.  I cooked garlic and onion in the pan for a few minutes before adding the pork chops and sauce.

You have to REALLY like Italian dressing in order to enjoy this meal. My husband thought they were okay, I wasn't so thrilled with them. I tried them with the potatoes & onions as suggested by some other reviewers and didn't like them. The italian dressing was just way too strong.

Nice.  I've tried it on the stove and with the potato slices and baked (be sure to allow 1.5 hrs at least on 350).  Cool taste just be prepared for the 'POW' factor.

I use this recipe EVERY time I make pork chops. It's simply the best - easy and tasty. I always take a bit of the sauce that's left over and drizzle over the chops before serving- YUM. Make sure to serve with chilled apple sauce for a devine meal.

I made this exactly as the recipe said. It was DELICIOUS! I would give it more stars if I could. Be warned though. It STINKS while it is cooking. It is worth it though. Next time we are going to try marinating this meat in the ingredients and then grilling it. Thanks so much for the recipe!

Wow!  I was skeptical, but they were great!  Definitely add the onion to bottom of pan under the chops as others suggested, then when thru, remove the chops and saute broccoli or other fresh veggies for a complete 1-pan meal!

Excellent! I have to admit I was a little skeptical but it was so delicious.  The flavors all complimented each other very well. I cut the recipe down to 1 pork chop and did everything as described above, turned out great.

August:  I'm always looking for new ways to cook boneless pork chops, and this one was super!  I followed the recipe exactly, using a very good bottled "lite" Italian dressing and I put it on to marinate before I went to work.  I did add some quartered baby portabella mushrooms a few minutes before the pork was done. Will definitely make this again.  Soon.  October 5th:  Okay, a month later I've cooked this recipe 2 more times, and it just keeps getting better.  I always use a good quality Italian dressing, quartered baby portabello mushrooms, and lite soy sauce and I wait until boneles pork chops are on special.  I did not have time to marinate tonight, but fixed it anyway with Superfast Asparagus (best asparagus ever - recipe this site, but rolled in extra virgin olive oil instead of pan spray and added some garlic salt).  I usually add either wild and long grain rice or mashed potatoes.  Quick, easy, economical.  Both pork and asparagus recipes are the "best of the best" as far as we are concerned.  Thanks to the people who submitted both.

This was okay.  Only used half the dressing and soy sauce called for and had plenty.  The whole recipe would have had the meat swimming in sauce.  The dressing was a little overpowering.  I used Kraft Zesty Italian since I had it on hand so maybe regular Italian would have worked better.

They came out very tender and flavorful.  My husband complained a bit about the saltiness from the soy sauce so I'll probably use a lower sodium variety next time.  Also, I used a zesty Italian dressing and may use the regular type or light.

Made this recipe for the GF and I cause I needed something quick, browned the chops (ribeye chops) before adding the sauce.  Added some garlic and white pepper, ended up really good!  Will probably make it again :)

Mixed reviews between me and my husband. It was quite easy, but I didn't like the fact that it used practically an entire bottle of dressing.  Make sure you use a large pan, contrary to a previous review.  The sauce becomes quite runny and can boil over resulting in a sticky, smelly mess.  My husband hated the smell of it while it was cooking.  I enjoyed the flavors--but Italian dressing wasn't the dominant flavor, I think the soy sauce won the battle because the pork chops were too salty.  My husband said that I had made better pork chops.  This might do better as a marinade than broiled or grilled versus pretty much poached in the marinade.

This recipe is really good!  I'm always looking for a new way to make pork chops.  The house smelled so good while these were baking!  I had zesty Italian dressing, so that's what I used.  My family loved them, and really that's what it's all about!

I don't know how this got such good reviews.  I made it exactly as written except that I added onions.  The onions were the best part.  The pork wasn't very tender and didn't taste like anything but italian dressing.

This was so salty, it was almost inedible.  The reason I gave it three stars instead of one is that I could sort of tell that underneath all of the overpoweing saltiness there was a promising flavor combination.  I added a chopped onion and browned the chops before adding the dressing/soy sauce, but really, the prevalent flavor here is salt.

This was a great recipe.  As another reviewer suggested I did cook it a bit differently.  I used 6 boneless pork loin chops about 3/4 inch thick.  I cut up some Shallots and placed them in the bottom of a 13 x 9 baking dish.  I also added about 3 cloves of chopped garlic to the sauce mixture.  I browned the chops in olive oil on the stove and then placed on the shallots covered with the sauce and baked for about 35 minutes at 375 in the oven.

The meat was very tender and quite tasty.  This is definitely a keeper!

I didn't care for the taste of the Italian dressing and soy sauce together, but I'm giving this 3 stars because my husband thought it was pretty good.  Also, I baked it covered with foil for 1 hr., uncovered and baked another 15  minutes and I have to admit, these were extremely tender.

While the sauce was delicious, the pork chops just came out way too dry.  I used very thick cut boneless chops and, obviously the 25 minutes of initial cooking was way too much as they were beyond done.  I couldn't even take the cover off and simmer for a bit longer.  Still searching for a juicy pork chop recipe -- may try this again and cut down the cooking time.

It was a little bland for my tastes, but really, what do you want for four ingredients? If I make it again I will add some Goya Adobo and let it set in the marinade a bit before I cook it.    It was very tender and juicy, which is why I will probably give it another try.

This was pretty good. I use sweet soy sauce and the vinegar flavour of the italian dressing was nicely met with a bit of sweetness.

Yummy indeed! Chops came out tender and moist. I marinated them for about an hour before cooking and it definitely helped. Also like the reviewer below said below, don't use too big of a pan, as your chops won't be completely covered. Thanks for sharing the recipe!

Great flavor, but overcooked.  I used bone-in chops, and would probably reduce the cooking time to 15min. max, on low.  Also, I just happened to have my pork chops marinating in Italian dressing all day when I found this recipe.  I'm not sure if changed the flavor, but I'm sure it didn't hurt!

AWESOME!  What I had on hand was bone-in center cut chops, so used those.  My chops were very tender and moist and not dry at all... maybe this was the cure...  I mixed up the sauce around lunch time. I put my chops in a gallon-size ziplock bag, poured the sauce in, zipped it up and laid in the fridge and let them marinate, turning the bag over every couple hours until I was ready to cook them.  Then put chops in pan and poured the sauce over them.  I didnt time it, but they probably cooked an hour or so.  I took the lid off after cooking for a while and let the sauce cook down a little.  These chops were so juicy and tender they were falling apart!  We LOVED them!  Thanks for the recipe!  Will definately make again and again!

Made this exactly as the recipe was written.  I cut every thing in half since I only cooked two chops.   They are the best chops I have eaten, mostly because the meat stayed moist and tender.

My boyfriend loves this recipe. He wasn't a big fan of pork chops either, but he asks for me to make these. I do add onion and brown them a bit before I add the dressing but that is all I do different.

I sliced an onion and placed it in the bottom of the pan.  I also added a clove of garlic to the sauce...because garlic makes everything better, right? Soooo good! I baked it in the oven for about 30-40 minutes, but I am going to try it in the crock pot next time.

All four of rhe family liked it. Good recipe and VERY EASY/quick.  Chops were done earlier than 25 minutes.  Used a lot of dressing and it seemed like a waste; will adjust next time for size of pan.

great, simple recipe! my only tweaks:

1 cup of italian dressing (the taste was too strong with 2 cups)

saute a small onion

give chops a sear on both sides and BAKE at 375 for 45 minutes (the skillet version didn't taste as good as the baked)

I enjoyed but not hubby's favorite.   It did make the pork chops very moist and had a nice flavour.

Pretty good I was surprised how tender the pork chops were. I would suggest less oil( made my own dressing with olive oil and white vinegar 3 to 1, I only used 3/4 c. but that was still too much. I also added onions, which it is pictured with but not in the actual recipe, carrots and red potatoes. I made a baking powder biscuit to go with it.

I didn't have soy sauce so I used worcestershire sauce instead. I did like the recipe said and plopped the chops in the pan and then poured the sauce over it and simmered. They were ok. Wasnt too salty, but the tangy was wierd to me. I think I might have cooked them too long cause they were a little tough. It was a very simple recipe, and if you like tangy, you will probably love this.

Delicious!! I had to run to store to buy more pork chops because my son (picky pete!!) wanted more.  I added a McCormick montreal steak seasoning and garlic salt before I browned them .... will definitely cook again!!!

This was great! The only thing was the soy sauce made the pork chop a little salty. Next time I will use a little less soy sauce or either reduced sodium soy sauce. Also I added chopped onion to the pork chop while cooking.

This is the first sure-to-be-tender pork chop recipe I've ever found.   I use half the amounts called for to make the sauce and it is plenty for 4 chops.  Also, I use fat-free dressing and low-sodium soy without sacrificing any flavor.  Easy and quick, I make it often.

The only reason I am giving this recipe 2 stars is because it was edible and not awful.  I cut the recipe in half and followed the directions almost exactly except I only had 3/4 C Italian dressing - and it was more than enough.  This was tangy - and I love tangy - but this was not tangy in a good way.  I would not recommend this recipe - I can't even think of how I would improve it and there are so many better recipes on this site.  Sorry Sexyserina, this just didn't do it for us.

Maybe I did something wrong..idk it's not good and it's not bad its just whatever I dont think I would make it again.  I think it's the dressing or soy sauce thats to much.  I baked mine at 375 for 45 mins over onions like other reviews said.

I was looking for a recipe that was simple and at the same time making sure I had the ingredients. I hit the jackpot when I found this recipe.  I made the recipe as posted.  My family was going crazy with the smell. My daughter said this is her favorite dish and hubby loved it!  Thank you!

They lived up to their name! :-) AND they were easy! I only needed two chops for my husband and I so I chopped a a few small potatoes and put them right in the skillet. They were cooked perfectly and the flavor was great. I loved putting these things in the pan and practically leaving it alone until done. Then I just steamed some broccoli quickly after taking the lid off the skillet. GREAT, easy meal :-)

So good!  I love the simplicity of the recipe and the ingredients are something I always have on hand.  Quick and easy.  I cooked my chops about 25 minutes total time and they were juicy and delicious.  I did cut the liquid in half and it was plenty!  I added green beans to the pan towards the end.  Very good recipe, thanks!

The flavor just was not that good.  I realize that I probably should have marinated the chops overnight, which would have enhanced the flavor (if you have the time).  But I am rating this  recipe AS WRITTEN, as opposed to the many variations reviewed.  I thought it was kind of a waste of the Italian dressing and soy sauce.

While this was cooking I started having serious doubts anticipating what the end result would be like. My whole house smelled like sauerkraut. In fact my husband and kids were certain that was what I was cooking. But the end result was very good and tasted nothing like I was thinking would. It was simple and quick and I liked that it had very few ingredients. I only had about a cup of italian dressing on hand so I used that and maybe a little under an 1/8 Cup of light soy sauce. It worked out fine - i just flipped the chops every 5 minutes or so until done.

This was AWESOME!  Easy and full of flavor!  I added an onion in the skillet with the chops and fresh mushrooms in the last 10 minutes of cook time.  Will add this to our recipe rotation.  Thanks for a great recipe.

Really good and really easy! My pork chops got a little dry, but that was my fault for cooking them too long.  The marinade was awesome though!

We like the taste of this recipe--a different slant for pork chops. I would only brown the chops next time--they were a bit "white" looking. I baked them in the oven with parchment paper covering them for about 35 minutes.

This recipe is awesome!! I did not change anything, I used the thinner pork chops but next time I would use a thicker one, I also made it with chicken and it was great. Thanks for the easiest recipe ever!!

I don't have a good track record with pork chops.  They always come out dry.  But I wanted something different so I gave it a shot.  They turned out pretty good.    My chops were an inch thick and I wanted to be sure they got done, so first I seared them for a few minutes per side in olive oil. I whisked into the dressing about a teaspoon of corn starch.  I put the seared chops over onions, poured the dressing over and baked them at 350 for almost an hour, covered.  To me, it wasn't anything to write home about, but my husband loved them so it's all good.

My husband (who LOVES pork chops) didn't like this at all. I used zesty italian and low sodium soy sauce after reading some of the other reviews. Not a good flavor combination. Sorry but won't be making this again.

I followed the recipe exactly, except I didn't have Italian salad dressing so I used Greek.  I used butterflied pork chops so they weren't extra thick.  The cooking time was perfect.  The pork chops were juicy and tender, not tough.  The sauce was great - not too mild or too strong.  This recipe was so easy!  I will definitely use this again next time I make pork chops.

I followed the directions exactly except I used "Zesty" Italian. The flavor was great, but the chops were very dry. Maybe it was my chops and not the fault of the recipe. I loved how quick and easy it was to make. We just sopped up the sauce with every bite!

One of the easiest and most delicious recipes ive ever used off of this site. I read that quite a few people baked it in the oven. I didnt. I did add onions and minced garlic. Came out great. Just put it over white rice.

This recipe is awesome. Quick and easy. Even I loved them and I normally hate pork. A couple additions to the recipe, 1. I marinated the pork chops for about 5hours before cooking. 2. If you use boneless pork chops the recipe will cover 5-6 if not more. I had alot of extra marinade and I had 5 pieces (1lb) in there.  We loved them so much I'm making them for Father's day. 

You also may want to check out the "Delicious Apple Sauce" recipe on this site to go along with it too.

My family loves this recipe. It is so versatile. I change the dressing to give it different flavors. Anything that's a vinaigrette works great--balsamic, greek, asian sesame ginger--whatever you like. I've also done this with chicken. It is "yummy", also.

This was AWESOME. I made it like this: marinate the pork chops in the dressing, soy sauce. and chopped garlic all day. I used balsamic vinagrette and it was great. Brown the chops, remove from the pan, and toss in some sliced onions. Stir for a minute or so. Put the chops back on top of the onions, pour the marinade over it all, cover and cook on low heat for 10 minutes or so until done. Great over rice.

This was good but the flavor is quite strong so be prepared!  And despite really watching my chops they came out fairly dry.  The cooking time as listed is too long, in my opinion.  I used the leftover sauce to stirfry broccoli and THAT was DELICIOUS!!  I might make this sauce again just to use as a veggie stir-fry sauce.  Served it all over jasmine rice and my hubby liked it, but it wasn't his favorite of all time.

This is a great recipe. This is simple and fast. I fallowed the recipe with one change; I used six chops instead of four.  I also cut the chops into large cubes for a faster cooking time.  My family loved this recipe.  I served the pork on rice along with the sauce it was cooked in. I will keep this recipe and use it often.

Excellent recipe.  I only had a half a cup off zesty italian dressing so I also used red wine vinegrette.  I cant believe how easy this was.  It was delicious.  It tasted sweet and a little tangy.  Wonderful.  I will be making this as a regular.  I plan on browning my pork chops first next time.  Just to add color for eye appeal.

I'm not impressed at all.  The sauce took too long to cook down to the consistency I like because I think 2 cups of Italian dressing is too much.  Sorry, won't make this again.

YUMMY and oh so easy! Definitely add onions to the batch, as they get a delicious, sweet flavor from the sauce. And, if you watch the time well, they come out very tender. I served this with mashed potatoes, and the sauce and onions mixed well with it. My significant other has never been a fan of pork chops and he said that this was "Safe to say, the best pork chop I've ever eaten!"

This actually turned out better than we expected. I am going to add a little garlic and onions next time (seems like everyone likes that combo). We will use this recipe again! UPDATE: I added some minced garlic and cooked for about 25 minutes, then I let them simmer for about 10 more minutes. They were extremely tender and juicy! Had to upgrade to 5 stars!!!

This was excellent.  I also made it in the oven .  Only problem for me is I would have to buy low-sodium soy sauce due to all the sodium in regular soy.

I made this last night with thick boneless pork chops.  It was different but very good. Hubby liked it, 13 yr old daughter loved it, and 11 yr old son thought it was o.k.  I marinated the pork for several hours and added fresh garlic and onions when I cooked it.  This one is a keeper.

I love this recipe. Quick, easy & delicious - great for mid work week when you're tired. We use Kraft's Zesty Italian Light dressing & 1/3 c soy sauce.

This is really quick and yummy, if a little bit salty for my taste.  I added a clove of garlic (chopped) and used lite balsamic vinaigrette, reduced by about 1/4.  Also reduced cooking time to 15-20 minutes.  Marinating the chops for at least an hour really helps too!

best pork chop recipe I have tried.  I advise letting them marinate for a little bit before cooking though.

I used only 2 thick boneless chops and 1 cup of zesty italian dressing and they turned out wonderful!!  I served them with a side of long grain and wild rice mix, forgot the veggies but oh well- still was a delicious meal.  Thanks very much!

This recipe was awesome!!!! To cut back on carbs I used the Carb Solutions Italian Dressing. Be careful how long you cook these chops for though. 25 mins on med. would be too long for thin chops. That would be perfect for thick cut chops.

I liked this recipe, it was a nice change and very easy to prepare.  I would recommend keeping an eye on the cooking time for thinner or leaner pieces of pork.  Marinating the meat is a definite plus!

This has become a staple in my home.  My husband loves it. I love it because it's quick and easy to prepare. Great if I'm in a hurry because there are so few ingredients and I usually have them on hand anyway.  Highly recommend it.

My family loved this!  I had a few different types of Italian dressing in the fridge, so I put a little of each in.  I think the thing that really made it was the one that was red pepper and parmesan.  It gave it just a little kick, but not so much that my 7 year old objected.

Potential. I used half the amount of soy sauce required. My pork chops were sorta thin w/ bone. They cooked thoroughly in 10 minutes. There is a lot of sauce left over. Next time I will pour 1/2 the amount of sauce in the skillet, and add as needed. It's harder to brown them when they are floating in a soup. But it is tasty anyway!

The sauce was too tangy to use over rice.  And the pork chops were dry (and I removed the lid after 20 minutes and the 3/4" chops were cooked through!).  An OK, fast dinner, but we won't make again.

I made this last night and my family thought it was awesome. I am always looking for something different instead of the same old thing. I didnt change a thing. I used 4 bone-in chops that were about 1/2 inch thick. I made rice with it and usedsome of the sauce to pour n my rice. I did add onions for extra flavor. I will definately be making this again!

Followed the recipe with thexception of adding a bit of fresh garlic and layering the chops on a layer of onions. Baked for 45 minutes at 375 and they were perfect. Very moist and flavorful.

Great flavor but know if you have thick cut chops much longer cook time.  After almost hour mine were still raw in center.  Onions and frozen broccoli I added might have slowed cooking, but husband said it was really good and we need to make again so I will but maybe in crock pot or oven.

This was very good!  I was surprised because my husband doesn't like "baked" pork chops, he likes pan fried - we even rarely have pork chops...   so I added garlic, I browned the chops in a black iron pan (I thought seeing them browned would be important to my dh  :)   - I used half the dressing and soy sauce for 4 lg. pork chops with bones but other than that, cooked on the stove for 25 mins.  He LOVED them... they taste kind of asian-y.  I loved them too, so this recipe will be a keeper, thank you for it -- (I served with steamed cauliflower)

Good flavor bad presentation. Did a half recipe because I was cooking for 2 people. Though the sauce amount was way too much. Next time I will be only using a quarter of the sauce and will give the pork chops a quick sear on high heat first. Remove the chops and then let the pan cool down before adding the sauce and chops back to the pan. Then cover and cook on medium low, flipping the chops a few time, till they reach the desired temperature.

The flavor was delicious. But, we like fork tender meat....and boneless chops never seem to get there.

I put a sliced onion in the bottom of a casserole dish then the chops and sauce.  Baked about 50 minutes covered.  Looked like soup.  Had to boil down the sauce. Poured it over the chops. Everyone just loved it.  You can't mess this dish.up.  Next time I will bake uncovered.

I made exactly as directed. I used bottled Olive Garden Italian salad dressing because I had it in my refrigerator. It was an easy recipe unfortunately I found it the overall flavor overwhelming and not in a good way. Most times my philosophy when finding a new recipe is to make it exactly as directed the first time and if you like it you can always tweek it. In this case there is nothing much to tweek so I'll just have to pass on making this again.

This was a nice twist for ordinary pork chops,I kept some of the sauce reduction to top the chops. There were no complaints,yummy.

The family really liked this dish. There was a bit of confusion, at the first, because I didn't know at what temp I should cook the pork chops. Later in the recipe it is stated to lower the temp and cook until desired tenderness, so, I started with medium. It took about 40 - 45 minutes to cook. Next time I will cut back on the amount of Italian dressing, as well, perhaps to a cup and a half. Very tasty, though.

The soy sauce and Italian dressing are a peculiar combination. I used the suggestion from a few of the other reviewers about adding onions to the bottom of the pan. I thought it turned out well, however my family did not care for it.

I baked the chops instead of frying - I used  lite soy but still found it  salty. As  I am a very novice cook - this is easy to make but next time I will follow the suggestions  & bake it with onions & will lower the soy sauce amount.

This was really flavorful.   Other reviewers suggested adding a sliced onion.  I added 1/2 thinly sliced onion for 2 pork chops.  I wish I had added double that.   They were great in the sauce.  I would eat this as a main meat, with sides.  I also think it could be cut and added to rice or noodles with the sauce for a great casserole.  I will make this again.

I thought this sounded a bit like my beef stroganoff, but with pork chops. So, after browning the onions and mushrooms in the skillet, I placed them in a crock pot. Browned the chops, and put them in the crock pot. Topped with the Cream of Mushroom soup, and put it on low for 6 hours. I removed the chops from the crock pot, and  added an equal amount of sour cream as soup, warmed it up, and served it to my guys with noodles. (I skipped the noodles) Served with steamed broccoli, and we all loved it. Sorry I didn't rate it as was written, but didn't have time to make them as directed and needed to get my chops used up. Thanks for a great recipe!

I didn't pre-mix the ingredients.  I just poured the Italian dressing over the meat in the pan, then did the same with the soy sauce, then sprinkled the pepper over.  No measuring, just eyeballed it.  Tasted good, had almost no prep time prior to cooking, and only one dirty pan with the simplified method above.  And I had all ingredients on hand.  All of these factors make this recipe a keeper.

These had really nice flavor, but I wish the gravy would be thicker because it was really tasty.  Cooking for 25 minutes was entirely too long and just created a really dry chop.  I will make again, but definitely make a few changes.

I followed the portions per recipe ( that's why I rated it a 4 stars ) but I agree with the other reviews that after browning the pork chops on the skillet,  transferring them to your baking pan , placing them on top of sliced onions and then pouring the dressing mixture over the pork chops - was the best outcome for me .

I followed the ingredients exactly with the exception of adding chopped garlic and a small sliced onion.  I marinated all ingredients except the onion in the fridge for approx. 3 hrs.  As I didn't feel like cleaning my stovetop I spread the onion on the bottom of a casserole and put the pork and the liquid on top.  Before I emptied the marinating bag I added some ketchup.  Cooked it covered in oven for 75-mins. Tasted sauce at 60-mins. and added one pkg. of Splenda to take away sharpness.  Turned out delicious and am planning to use left over sauce with 6 oz. of tomato paste to make Sloppy Joe's for tonight's dinner.  Will make it again.

I don't feel like I can really rate this because didn't have all the correct ingredients. I used an Italian dressing with cheese in it. I think it would have been better with a straight Italian dressing.

I made this with minimal changes.  I marinated the chops for 4 hours, then put a bag of 'Simply Potatoes with Onions' in the bottom of a 9 x 13 pan.  Then, I topped the spuds with the chops and poured the marinade over the top, covered it and baked at 350* for about an hour.  I took the chops out and continued to bake the taters for another half an hour or so since they were still al dente at the  hour mark.  Next time, (and there will be a next time!) I will bake the potato onion marinade mix for an hour, then add the chops on top and bake for half an hour.  My first try at this recipe, he chops were tasty, but a bit over done at an hour.  I think half an hour would be the cat's meow!

I made these pork chops tonight and my family gave them a 2 thumbs up. I browned the chops in a little olive oil then put them over sliced onions in a baking dish. Then I covered them with the sauce and added 1 tsp of minced garlic. I covered the dish and baked them at 350 for 40 minutes. I then added sliced mushrooms and continued baking for another 20 minutes. When the chops were done I removed them and thickened the sauce with cornstarch. I served each chop topped with mushrooms, onions and sauce. Although I used reduced sodium soy sauce I still found them a little salty so next time I'll reduce the soy sauce by half.

We ate it, but no one went back for seconds. I love salt and usually can't get enough salt for my taste but this was actually too salty. And the smell while it was cooking was so strong...I guess it was the Italian dressing we smelled but it wasn't a very good smell. It's odd because we love soy sauce & use it a lot, and we love Italian dressing, and of course pork chops are a favorite but all of it combined just wasn't as good as it should've been.

I used the oil and vinegar style Italian dressing which must wrong.  These tasted terrible!   If II would try again, I'd used the creamy style dressing.  I agree the photo should match the recipe.  There are no onions, nuts or herbs listed,

Make sure you buy excellent quality meat. 
Next time i would only use 1 cup of Italian Dressing and i'd add a dash of cream and white wine.
I did add some brown sugar and herbs and it was a really good sauce that would be excellent on a steak off the bbq.
Dont overcook the chops and if you have to take them off early and keep the sauce going as you reduce it.

Interesting combos that really work!

I absolutely will make it again. The porkchops were super tender and moist. I didn't have Italian dressing so I just used three bottles of dressing that were about halfway down and mixed them.  I did put in the onions and potatoes and I added some garlic powder. It was really really good and I would make it again for sure.

I was really disappointed in this after reading the good ratings.  I followed the recipe as written.  It wasn't something we cared for.  I used low sodium soy and I thought it was still too salty and didn't care for the taste overall.  I won't be making it again.

It was way to vinegary as stated in the recipe.  I cut the Italian dressing in half and added 1 cup pork bullion and one cup chicken bullion.  I then reduced and thickened it.  I won't make it agin as suggested, but after my alterations and over stuffing with a side of sautéed okra it made a good change for pork.

Tonight,  I made it with natural bone-in pork chops and I didn't have Italian dressing, so I used Athenos organic Greek salad dressing.  OMG WAS IT GREAT!! Sorry it did last long enough to take a picture.

These made very moist, tender pork chops!! I didn't use as much soy sauce (I used low sodium, and only about a tablespoon.)  I cooked mine on an electric skillet and these came out delicious!!

I must have done something wrong - however, I did follow the recipe exactly.  I cooked 6 chops in the electric skillet on 320 - it boiled, it burnt....so I turned it down to 220 and cooked until the chops were at 170 --- all the liquid boiled out and it had basically no taste:(

Oh wow - this was really good and sooooo simple! I made this on the fly with very few ingredients. Followed the advice of Nina and added fresh garlic to the sauce, layered onions on the bottom of a pan and cooked in the oven at 375 for 30'ish minutes with some fresh roasted green beans and spanish rice. Delish. Thank you for an easy peasy recipe!

I didn't care for this recipe at all but my husband went back for seconds which is the only reason I'm giving it three stars. I followed the recipe as written with the exception of seasoning my meat prior to putting in the skillet. Unless my husband requests it, I will not be making it again.

this recipe was ok.  It was quick and easy, but I found the timing to be off.  The chops were a little dry.

Absolutely delicious.  Pork chops were so tender and tasty.  Made exactly as written except used more garlic as we always do.  Will definitely make again--probably as soon as next week.

We really like the flavor. The downside was the waste. I mean I have a huge container of the dressing/ sauce that I froze and will use the next time. I think the best bet would be to make taters or a pasta to serve the sauce with. I made exactly as stated above

Quick, easy (one dish for mixing, one for cooking). Something you can set on the stove and get busy making a side dish.  It says "5 minutes Prep"...maybe five to include getting stuff out of the fridge, using it then putting it back.  

Result?  Great tasting pork.

Very moist!  I'm not usually a big  fan of pork  chops due to the dryness...but these were delicious.  I spooned a little sauce on them after they were served for even more flavor!  Perfect!

Great, quick and easy.  Like many others, I added onions and sauteed minced garlic. Delicious!!  I served with cornbread muffins and a green salad.

Too much dressing for me. It was okay but I only cooked it for 15 mins. Would have been better without the dressing in the pan. Won't fix again.

Delicious and really easy to make!  When it was cooking, I got really concerned since it didn't look that appetizing.  But as it cooked & simmered, it looked & smelled yummy!  I made exactly as the original recipe stated.  The only (very minor) negative is that the flavor was a little strong but I think that was my bad because my boneless pork chops were on the thin side.  VERY much looking forward to making again with thicker chops.  Thanks, SEXYSERINA!

I made these exactly as the recipe stated. They were very moist and the dish was very easy to make, however, we thought they were a bit bland. I liked a lot the idea of the foil packets but would use something other than lemon pepper to season them. And the color of the pork was very unappetizing. They were very pale and sickly looking. I used bone-in thin chops and cooked them for 25 mins. And I am very glad I put the packets in a 9X13 dish since there would have been a huge mess if I hadn't. I will make these again but play around with the seasonings and maybe add a slice of onion to the packet as well.

I didn't have the Italian dressing so I used what I had, Lite Asian Sesame with Ginger and Soy and it turned out very good and moist.  I also browned the chops slightly before cooking.

This was much better then I thought it sounded!  I took some of the other suggestions and put some onion in the bottom of a glass dish and the chops & mixture on top - then baked.  I also added some garlic.  Was YUMMY!!

Very salty and soy overpowers the other flavors.  I need to try it with half as much soy.   When I removed the lid, the oil from the dressing separated.  For some reason I expected it to cook down and thicken as a sauce.  Cook times are high.  Or medium heat on my stove is a lot higher than the person who submitted the recipe.  Mine was completely cooked when I checked it at 15 minutes.   The flavor was good though and I think, with some tweaking, this will be a good recipe.

This was very good.  I accidentally used boneless pork ribs and they turned out great.  We sliced them thin and served it over rice.
2nd go, I used pork tenderloin marinated 2 days.  I seared it on the stove, then baked at 450 for 30 minutes.  It was delicious.

I have to admit the pork came out tender. The combo of Italian dressing and soy sauce just did not thrill our palates. I'll go for something else next time.

Marinated in Italian dressing for about 30 minutes. Will go for longer next time, as previous reviewers suggested.

I made this recipe last night and it was so easy and delicious! I cooked it on medium heat for about 20 minutes then I put it on simmer for 30 minutes (the pork chops I use were pretty thick). They came out so tender!! Thanks for a great, easy recipe!!

This was pretty tasty and the pork chops were tender enough to cut with a regular table knife.  But the clean up of the pan - well let's just say it wasn't so fun.

Had some pork loin chops in the freezer, and wanted to do something different with them....this is a great recipe and so easy. I followed another reviewers suggestion and browned the chops first, placed them in a baking dish sprayed with Pam over sliced onions and added some corn starch in the soy sauce/italian dressing mixture. We all really liked the taste, however, my husband who is not a picky eater, thought that the sauce was too sweet/spicy. Otherwise will most likely make again, thanks!

Theses were OK but nothing to write home about. Sauce was a little too vinagarry and too thin. They did get tender though.

Not as yummy, it tasted like a pork chop salad, I actually gave it 2 stars because it was something different and edible, however this recipe is not for my tastebuds, nor that of the 4 other people that tried this in my household. Sorry.

Easy to make... but taste was overpowering.  maybe it's the fact that i used a low-fat italian instead of a real yummy one... but yeah... the sauce came out just too strong. it wasn't edible unless i ate it with bread!  none the less, the boyfriend liked it.

This was so good.  Such a nice diversion from the smothered pork chops my husband usually makes, but it is also good.  I did brown the chops in bacon grease first however.  I like the looks of a browned chop.  Thanks

Good concept, but way too strong dressing taste! I followed the recipe to a T. I suggest NOT using a "zesty" Italian....try a more blander dressing. Also 2 cups is not necessary, was too much! Maybe this would be better if grilled...?

Yummy is the correct first word for this recipe!!  DELICIOUS!!!  I did as others and placed sliced onions in a pan, topped with the pork chops (without frying) and then poured sauce over it.  Baked for 30 mins at 350 degrees and then placed everything in a dutch oven on the stove for about 10-15 minutes.  Tender...juicy...flavorful.  The young kids and hubby LOVED it.  I'll definitely keep this recipe.  Thank you for sharing this!!!

There were awesome!  DH declared them the best pork chops he has ever eaten!  I didn't have enough soy sauce, so probably only used 2 T (actually, I had a couple packets of soy sauce left from Chinese take-out and that is what I used!).  Had a bottle of Tuscan dressing that I wanted to finish off, so 1 Cup of my dressing was that and the other cup was regular Italian dressing.  I did brown the chops in a little olive oil and then sliced an onion on top, poured the dressing mixture over all, covered and popped into oven at 350 for about an hour and a half.  Yummy! is right!

Easy enough for my husband, a non-cook, to make, and they turned out tasty. We did have super-thick pork chops so we had to modify the cooking time. The finished product is a little lighter in flavor than I'd like, but the flavor that's there is good.

Was looking for something different.  Didn't care for this recipe, son enjoyed them though.  Should have browned chops before adding liquid to pan.

We devoured these pork chops and I don't even like pork chops!  This was well beyond my expectations.  I didn't have an "Italian" dressing, per se, so I used a bottled balsamic vinaigrette.  It was super tasty and super easy.  Great recipe!  I served with brown rice and broccoli and we cleaned our plates.  We'll be making this for years to come.

These pork chops were excellent.  I didn't have any Italian dressing, so I had to substitute Speidie sauce (those from upstate or western New York will know what it is).  They came out very flavorful.  Great recipe, thanks!

I cannot belive how simple and delicious this recipe is!  My husband says this is his favorite pork so far I've made (keep in mind I've only been cooking for 1 year).  The pork came out tender and perfectly flavored without being overpowering.  The only thing I did different from the recipe was I cooked it until it looked done which was less than the recommended time.  I am definitely makeing this again!

I made this last night and the family   enjoyed it.  I used lite Italian salad dressing out of the bottle and I added onions and a bit of garlic to the browning of the cutlets.  

Browning the cutlets made them look more appealing and I used less sodium soy sauce.

I served buttered, parslied brown rice with these cutlets.  Using some of the sauce from the cutlets on the rice was absolutely delicious!  I also served green beans..making this a delicious, different, weeknight meal.

Thank you!;)

So good and so easy!  I did marinate 6 chops in the sauce for about 3 hours.  8 chops would definitely have fit in that much sauce.  My husband raved and he doesn't usually like boneless pork chops because they tend to be on the dry side.  These were tender and delicious.  He had seconds!  This would also be very good with chicken.

This is one of my favorites.  Its not the best smelling when cooking, but its one of the best tasting.  Fast and easy - makes a tender chop.

These were very tasty.  I'm not a big pork chop fan, but I ate all of mine. Even my 2 year old had 2 helpings (dipped in ketchup, of course).  I used 2 envelopes of the italian dressing mixture and also put onions on the bottom as other reviewers suggested.  I had Pork Sirloins (not sure what they are!) and cooked it for 30 minutes on convection.

Easy & delicious!  My husband didn't think he liked pork chops, but he loves these! I've thrown in dried minced onion & garlic on occasion, too.

I think this recipe could have a higher rating if the cooking time was adjusted.  Luckily I read the previous reviews.  I cooked the chops at a low simmer for 12 minutes, and they were done perfect.  I can't imagine cooking them for a full 25min at med heat.  I also marinated them for a few hours beforehand.  I was suprised at how tender they were, as I don't usually have good luck with pork chops.  The sauce was good with rice, and I love how easy it was, and with on-hand ingredients!  I think I will definitely try them again.

This is a great recipe to have because it is simple and quick.  I made mine on the stove like the recipe suggests and it was very good.  Definitely the best way to make it during the summer months, but I may try baking it during the winter just to warm up the house! Thanks for the recipe.

Very good. My wife and I both enjoyed it very much, and even our 5 year old ate it, despite the fact he insisted while it was cooking he didn't like pork. Would certainly make it again, though we did go with the suggestions to brown the chops first, then back on a layer of onions with the liquid poured over top.

This was easy and delicious.  My husband doesn't like the vinegar taste of the Italian dressing but he had no idea I used it until I told him.  I didn't know any other way to cook pork chops but the way I was taught but this was quick and easy.  That's a great thing for a Mommie with a newborn at home.

I liked, hubby didn't care for flavor. I used zesty italian which may have been too strong. This was very easy and mine was done in 10 mins. Used suggestion of another reviewer and threw some frozen   broccoli into sauce after pork done and removed. quick and tasty side dish. I will play with sauce a bit and see if I can find something hubby likes better because it is a great concept.

This is a fantastic recipe because it literally took 2 minutes to prep and my chops were thinner so they cooked in 10 minutes. Very tasty. I also used fat free Italian dressing and low sodium soy.

While this is not sensational it is tasty and quick. I used 4 chops and cut the sauce in half. I will make it again but it won't be appearing frequently.

This was super quick, easy and delicious! I served it with some sauteed veggies (whatever was in the fridge) with a little bit of the marinade.

This recipe was pretty good, just not something I will crave. My husband liked it too.
