I made this for my extended family.  It was a hit!!  It looks so nice when finished.  The only thing I will change next time it to use a can of crushed pineapple instead of chunks.  All the pineapple lovers of the family wanted more pineapple.

This recipe is awesome!  I made it for a friend at work and everyone marveled at it!  The only thing I changed is I substituted water for the rum since I don't keep it on hand.  Someone also suggested that you could add strawberry sundae topping instead of the pineapple as a variation...but the pineapple was very tasty on it!  I would recommend this to everyone!!!

My boyfriend really enjoyed a Banana Split Pie my friend made with custard and meringue.  I'm not a big fan of either so when I found this recipe I thought it sounded delicious.  I used an icecream scoop to put semi-frozen cool whip scoops on top instead of peakes. I put the pie in the freezer until it was ready to serve so the cool whip would keep its shape. I definately recommend this recipe because it's not too much work for a great looking and tasting dish!

This was an awesome pie and so easy to make. Definitely looked like it was store bought. Froze overnight - needed 4-5 hours in fridge to soften up.

Huge hit! Definitely keep it in the freezer. I made it the night before, put it in the freezer, then put it in the fridge a couple hours before serving... perfect! There were 3 pieces left so I put them in the fridge... it was melty goo the next morning (but still edible and yummy! ;))

This is an excellent recipe.  I have made this a few times now and I have gotten rave reviews both times.  Also the presentation looks beautiful!  Everyone asked where I purchased it.  Thanks for the great recipe.

Super Yum! I made one and it was hideous! But I made another so it would be beautiful AND delicious. I felt the rum+chocolate wasn't described well, so let me clarify, do not heat chocolate and add then spread! I'm not even going to use rum next time. I'll make due somehow. And be sure to get the big box of pudding! I don't care for the fruit or nuts either. So overall, I made a banana chocolate cream pie of some sort... But it was inspired by this recipe and it was delicious and still very much like a banana split the way I would make it.

Looks better than it tastes. I wouldn’t make again just because it’s not worth it.

I love this dessert! However I lay off on the pineapple because my husband is not a big fan of pineapple.
