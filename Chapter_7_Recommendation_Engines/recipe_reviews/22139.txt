This was pretty good...my first time trying anything with leeks!  I think it tastes best with half regular green cabbage and half Chinese napa cabbage.  I used at least 2 tablespoons of chile sauce, which I added just after the noodles.  I may cut back on the amount of noodles next time because after a day or two they absorbed all the juice.  I'll continue making this recipe from time to time. **UPDATE**  It's been a couple of years since I made this soup and now I've tried it again and made additional discoveries.  First, if you're using spicy garlic sauce, two teaspoons will suffice and add 1 tablespoon of brown sugar.  If you're using sweet garlic sauce, use 1 tablespoon and add a dash or two cayenne pepper.  Secondly, to avoid loosing all the broth to the noodles, cook the noodles separately, then add them to the soup after the cabbage is just about tender, plus an additional cup of broth and 1 cup of water.  Trust me; you'll love it!

This is a decent Southeast Asian cabbage soup recipe, except that it's missing one important element: FISH SAUCE! Add that, and you'll find the flavor you're missing in the original recipe. **Update: I've made this recipe a bunch of times now, and by far the best is with garlic chili sauce (in the jar with a green lid). Also, it's better without noodles - they get mushy in leftovers.

This didn't seem really Thai-ish to me except for the chile sauce at the end.  So I added a small stalk of lemon grass that I whacked with my rubber mallet to crush it a bit, and a few kaffir lime leaves to the broth while it simmered.  I also added a teaspoon full of something called "Hot Spice Powder" which I picked up at our local international market.  The ingredient list is: white pepper, salt, spice; so I'm not really sure what all is in it, but it tasted good in the soup.  I used about a cup of teeny, tiny, skinny Fideo noodles.  The result was delicious.  DH put too much chile sauce in his serving, and complained about the heat, but that was his own silly fault.  We both really liked this.  Will definitely make it again. Oh, and I removed the lemon grass and lime leaves before serving. Thanks for the recipe!

This is my favorite recipe on the site.. Probably my favorite recipe, period. Great tasting, filling, and not horrible for my health. Great combination!

Now, the biggest weakness of this recipe, in my opinion, is that the broth really gets soaked up by the noodles, so leftovers get mooshy. However, there is a solution! Buy "no yolk" egg noodles and enjoy!

Fantastic one pot recipe - easy, healthy, filling and looked great when served up.  There was no need for me to add any extra seasoning during the cooking process.  Thai sweet chilli sauce complemented the dish perfectly.  There was just enough flavour from the stock, leeks and from poaching the chicken in the soup base.

I poached the chicken in 4 cups of chicken stock and then added another 3 cups of vegetable stock gradually when the fluid level ran low during the cooking of the vegetables and noodles.

Thanks for posting this recipe, Jessica.  Definitely a dish I will make regularly.

so i hate to review this because i changed it a bit(i am giving this 4 stars because as written it wouldn't be considered thai and very bland)...but mine ended up really good. this is what i did-
started with boiling chicken and water-added 1 .5 stalks 3 tablespoons lemon grass chopped fine, 1 tsp. fresh ginger,thai chili paste 3 tablespoons and 2 beef bouillon - (in another pan i sauteed 1 onion and 2 garlic cloves and added that to the soup mixture)  then took out chicken shredded added it back with 3 cups cabbage, chopped tomato, carrot  cut julienne, 3 tablespoons of cilantro.  then let this simmer for 3 hours. about 30 mins. before serving i added 1 more cup shredded cabbage. and fresh cilantro.  this was good and i added quite a bit of the thai chili paste because we like it spicy.  this would be really good with shrimp in place of chicken as well!

This is such a great recipe. It is so yummy. It is filling. The soup by itself is really good with out the tai chilli sauce but it is MUCH better with the tai chilli sauce.
The only thing I changed is that I cooked the noodles separate and then I put them in the pot of soup, this way the noodles don't absorb all the broth.

This has become one of my favorite soups.  If I don't have egg noodles, I substitute broken spaghetti.  Definitely shred the cabbage rather than chopping it, and I use 1/2 head instead of the whole one.  There is something intoxicating about the flavor of this soup that makes me crave it.

Good easy soup.  I didn't have the Thai chili sauce, and I think it would have been even better if it had a little heat.

Very good. Added a little carrot for color/taste.  The chili sauce makes it.  Will make again.

This is great soup!  I thought I had Thai Chili Sauce when I started making this, but actually had Thai Red Curry Paste, so went ahead and put that in - 2 rounded teaspoons, with a little chili powder and some ground pepper and extra salt, and it was delicious.
Thanks for a wonderful basic recipe!!

Juat wonderful. I had this for lunch today and it really hit the spot. I made this last night since soups alawys taste better the second day. :) I used buckwheat soba noodles instead of egg and used 4 ounces instead. It was plenty. I also used napa cabbage instead of regular cabbage and tossed in baby carrots instead of slicing the large ones. It did absorb most of the broth overnight, so I just added a little extra stock to the bowl I reheated. The chile sauce really is great in this. I'll make this again this winter I am sure.

This is a simple, easy-to-make, and tasty soup.  I make it sans noodles most of the time.  With a squirt of Srirachian Sauce, this soup is something you will want to put on your twice a month menu.

I made this last night and it was spectacular! My husband said it tasted like egg rolls. He then suggested that next time we make some fried wontons or buy some wonton chips at an Asian market. We also are planning to try shrimp and/or pork in place of the chicken sometime. Great recipe as is - no changes needed - a little plain though without the Thai Chile sauce - you must have it, or some other sauce, in order for it to taste as good.

AS A DIABETIC I LOOK FOR ANYTHING I CAN COOK AND EAT WITHOUT WORRYING. THIS IS AT THE TOP OF MY LIST, I DID ADD A FEW CLOVES OF GARLIC, AND USED REGULAR ONIONS. AND CHANGED THE EGG NOODLES TO WHOLE WHEAT NOODLES DUE TO THE DIEABITIES. BUT A STILL GREAT RECIPE. I WILL MAKE THIS OFTEN

This is a great soup (although it's more like a stew, especially by the second day), and it's not often that I say that about a soup.  I'm not even a fan of cabbage and I love it.  So far I've only used regular cabbage, but may try napa cabbage sometime.  I don't put the Sriracha chili sauce in when making it, but rather let everyone add it to their bowls later, to their taste.  I also use the 33% less sodium chicken broth, and it is plenty salty.  DH requests this soup often!

This soup was incredible! I did do some modifications though~ I used chicken thighs instead of breasts, I dropped in two egg whites, added a handful of peas, and I used rice-noodles instead of egg noodles. I will be making this soup at least once a month. Soooo good!

LOVE THIS! I made this soup without noodles so I could freeze individual servings of it...and it turned out PERFECTLY!  I also substituted a bunch of green onions for the leeks and it's still awesome.  Freezes and reheats really well.

Really loved this soup!  Made as described except I left out the noodles altogether (may add them later).  The soup seemed pretty bland and I was surprised that no spices were called for but once the chile sauce was in (I used a green thai chile paste that was in the fridge) all the flavors came together and the result was wonderful!  I used savoy cabbage - my favorite at the moment.  The real test will be when I try it out on the kids, but I loved it and will make more just for me if they won't eat it!

Followed suggestions of other posters and added garlic, cinnamon, ginger, celery salt, squash, +1 cup water. Had to use up some chix thighs so they added great flavor to the stock. Terrific soup but will add even more liquid next time to thin out.

This was great.  If you dont want a stew like consistency- then add more broth- but I liked it thicker.  One leek was perfect for the taste- and I,like many, added more chile sauce after tasting to our liking.  I used sweet chile sauce- not realizing there was regular and sweet- and it added a nice flavor.  Let is simmer for quite awhile to get those flavors to come together.  Very good stuff!

Absolutely delicious !  It was more like Vietnamese Pho (noodle soup) then Thai food.  I skipped the noodles completely, though.  I didn't want the carbs or the calories.  As a huge fan of Pho, I didn't miss the noodles at all !  The cabbage substituted nicely. As the stock boiled down, I did add about 1 1/2 cups of water.  This did not diminished the flavor at all.  I shredded the chicken instead of dicing it.  I also added diced jalapeno, an extra tablespoon of Thai chili sauce & topped with mung bean sprouts (like served with Pho).  I topped off with Sricacha sauce (I aptly call "rooster sauce" due to the rooster on the bottle.)  I don't think I will ever want the sodium or carbs/calories of vietnamese noodle soup ever again.  Next time, I will also added shredded fresh basil to garnish.

By far the best soup I have ever made! Only addition I made was a few shakes of "5 spice". It smelled and tasted heavenly! Oh I also squeezed some lime juice over it before serving!

I have made this several times, maybe 5. DH  likes it, I love it. I have a pot on my stove now, that I have added garlic and a peeled finger of ginger to. I never have leeks so I've always used onion. I add extra low sodium chicken broth and/or water to help w/the noodle issue. Always add sriracha. Have even added a bit of sesame oil in the past, and have a lime to add to this batch. It's a great simple healthful soup as is, open to a little interpretation. Thanks so much for sharing.

Very good.  I used the same ingredients but altered the methods.  Sauteed (well-seasoned) boneless, skinless, chicken breast instead of boiling.  Personal preference, just don't care for boiled chicken, plus, I wanted to cook some extra chicken for future meals.   Then I sauteed the leeks and carrots in the same pan, added the broth, brought to a boil, and then added the noodles and cabbage.  I used cole slaw mix for the cabbage...so hard to figure out how much to use, tho. I really liked this soup...will become a regular for me! 09/28/15 Half of a small head of cabbage equals six cups..sounds like enuf, proportionally, for eight cups of broth, for six servings. Also added a few ribs of celery to this batch! Next time I will use fewer noodles. I added four additional cups of broth and still had very little liquid. 12/12/16 1 onion, 4 carrots, 2 ribs celery, 10 oz angel hair cole slaw mix, 8 cups Sam's chicken 'bone broth', 6 oz noodles...haven't added the chicken yet, but looks good so far. I know that the submitters said stew-like, but this (with these proportions) looks plenty thick for me!

After reading the reviews, I was worried it would  not have enough flavor.  But the addition of the sriracha sauce is FABULOUS.  Serve with a few sliced jalapenos on top and it's even better.

Best chicken soup I've ever made.  I didn't add the Thai spices and I used a pkg of Ramen noodles instead of egg noodles because my pot was not big enough.  I will definitely make this again and maybe try to get a bigger pot.

Excellent!  Looking for a recipe for cabbage fresh from the garden, found this one.  We loved it.  Added a couple extra thai peppers and lemongrass, and used amish egg noodes (hand on hand).  Can't get enough, will definitely make again.  THANKS!

I think that this recipe could definitely use some spiceing up besides just the chili sauce I think if I make it again I will add some garlic, cilantro, Thai basil and since I used low sodium chicken broth some celery salt, possibly some coconut milk and lime juice. Now that would make a soup!! I have to say the aroma of the soup is great! But the taste could use some beefing up. Perhaps I will keep this recipe in my box and use it as a base to build on.

I love this recipe. I didn't have leeks so I used onions.  Next time I'll try leeks to see if it changes the taste much. I used 3/4 head of cabbage because a whole one seemed like too much.  I also added a few cloves of garlic.
Yum!

I was skeptical at first - without the chili sauce it is a good chicken soup - the Thai chile sauce is a must! My husband and I placed about 3-4 tsp. of the sauce in each bowl to give it some zip. I will definitely make this again.

I love this soup. I added salt and pepper to taste, cooked the cabbage for five minutes before adding the noodles, and I left the lid on as much as I could to prevent evaporation of the broth. I'm not quite sure if I used the correct Thai chili sauce, but Sriracha tastes amazing on top of this soup!

Boyyyy Howdy!!! This is now one of my favorite soups!! Agree with others, used 1 Tbsp of Thai sweet chili sauce and added 1 Tbsp of fish sauce. Vegie freak here, so I added a red bell pepper and matchstick carrots, and omitted the noodles (gonna use at a later time, I WILL make this over and over). On a Monday evening, after work, SUPER EASY and DELICIOUS!!!

This was delicious. I did add a few things just based on reviews, my personal preference & what I had on hand. Used 4 cups of chicken broth and 4 cups of lime/chile flavored chicken broth. Added minced ginger (about 3 slices. Added a stalk of young bok choy & half a head of green cabbage, a small package of snow peas, green onions & carrots. Towards the end of the simmering time I added about 1 TBSP of fish sauce & 1 TBSP of chile garlic sauce (the one with the green lid). I left out the noodles all together. It was wonderful, just enough spice & zip and super healthy!!!

Needs a lot more flavor (as many others had mentioned). I used fish sauce, sesame oil, garlic, red chili paste & seasoned rice vinegar. Ramen noodles added at the end do not absorb the oil like many other had indicated occurred with the egg noodles. Topped with sliced snap peas & some cilantro.

This is a great soup that allows you to add any of your favorite spices.  I've made it many times and usually add Fish Sauce, garlic, ginger, 5 spice, jalapeno, green onions and juice of 1 lime.  Since I try to avoid gluten, I either don't add the egg noodles or use kelp or shirataki noodles instead. Bean sprouts, cilantro, and basil make great garnishes for this soup too.  So healthy and delicious!!!

This is so simple and so good. I've made it four times in the past couple of months. I sometimes use thinly sliced yellow onions instead of leeks, and I prefer Chinese cabbage to regular cabbage since it seems a bit milder.

This is really good, but I added a few things to make it a little different.

I added a teaspoon of sesame oil, a teaspoon of ground ginger, a teaspoon of minced garlic, a dash of garlic salt, and instead of egg noodles (I didn't have any) I used orzo pasta.

The recipe is a great base to work with, on it's own I'm not sure if it's quite "ready" to be called Thai. With the broth I added Sake, or cooking rice wine/ sherry would work too, and waited for it to boil. Also a splash of fish sauce adds that special asian flare to the soup. I used bean noodles, the see through kind, and it turned out great with the spice added at the end. It really hits the spot.

SOOOO Yummy. With or without the thai sauce it's amazing. I didn't have very much chicken stock so I added water and boiled chicken thighs instead of breasts. It was very tasty and produced a lot more broth in the end... the noodles soak up a lot!

It wasn't very tasty.  I'm not a great cook, but I know I can do better than this.   I was really disappointed, but what's worse is that this recipe makes a lot!   It needs plenty more spices, which I didn't add because I made it exactly as written.

Super delicious soup!  I love how it is so simple and unprocessed!  The only reason I did not put five stars is because I agree the noodles soak up most of the broth and a little bit of sugar added really plays on the spiciness.  Either way, it was a wonderful recipe and I will be making this a lot in the future.

I absolutely loved this recipe! Healthy and filling! I used one recommendation of no yolk egg noodles (I used the thin), added some sweet curry (from Penzey's), salt, garlic powder, brown sugar and a little bit of red pepper flakes. This was a perfect healthy soup. Thank you so much for submitting this recipe!

We really like this recipe. The husband and son both had 2nd bowls. Used srichacha sauce for the chili sauce and it was perfect for it. Also used 2 packages ramen noodles (didn't use seasoning package) instead of egg as the recipe called for the noodles to cook only 5 minutes. An egg noodle would take longer, I think. Anyways they were perfect for it. Its chicken noodle soup with a twist! We'll be making this one again.

This was very easy to make, a nice healthy choice, and the Thai Chili sauce added just the right zest.  I also used rice noodles.  Will definitely make this again.

I used homemade chicken broth.  It needed more flavor using this broth.  Plus I think there was not enough broth and too much noodles.  It was not soupy enough.  The taste was ok.

This is a very good soup.  I did not have leeks on hand and had to use onions instead but I would love to try it with leeks.  Also, I follow a gluten free diet so I used thick thai rice noodles instead of egg noodles.  The rice noodles were perfect with this soup and great for leftovers as well because they do not soak up the broth.  We will make again!

We really liked this.  The textures were great.  I read the reviews and made some of the adjustments mentioned.  I added garlic, cayenne pepper, red pepper flakes, white pepper.  I added some cilantro to garnish.  I didn't have the thai chili sauce the recipe called for so I improvised and used a red taco sauce and some sweet hot pepper jelly I had on hand.  We loved it this way but I bet its great with the Thai Chili Sauce too and will try it next time with that.

I followed some of the suggestions on this site and added fish sauce, red chili paste, sliced garlic and ginger to cook with the chicken. I left out the noodles, I spooned the soup over rice noodles when I served it.  Over all, I will make it again.

This is SO GOOD!!!!!  Low-fat and very filling.  The only change I made was to substitute one box of thai-ginger chicken stock for one of the boxes of regular chicken stock.  (Sorry, I can't recall the brand.)  This gave it more flavor, but I'll try the original recipe next time, as I'm sure it is delicious as well.  The cabbage perfectly compliments the noodles (in fact, it makes it seem even noodlier) and the  addition of the sweet and spicy red pepper sauce is lovely.  Will absolutely make this again!

I think this makes an excellent soup except that as written, the recipe produces a bland, except for heat from chilies, soup.  I used garlic chili sauce, 2 to 3 times what was called for, but heat doesn't equal taste.  When reheating leftovers, I added small amounts of fish sauce, lemon, and sesame oil.  The result was perfect.  I also recommend cooking the noodles separately as many other commenters have suggested.c

Added: Kale and Swiss Chard  from the garden (as I did not have any Leeks) and minced bacon.

Left out: Leeks, and noodles to keep the carbs low. 

A real crowd pleaser; always better than people anticipate.

3 REALLY IMPORTANT THINGS!!!
1) Add water as needed.
Some like it soupy. Some like it stewy.
2) Once you pull the chicken, shred or cut into strips... AND DO NOT PUT IT BACK IN!!!
Put portion in bowls when serving.
Otherwise it will over cook and turn to rubber.
3) DO NOT ADD ALL NOODLES TO POT.
Use a strainer, and cook ONLY the amount of noodles on the serface of soup you plan to serve right away.
Otherwise noodles left in soup will become  (mushad).
ENJOY!!!

I would make it again but, as suggested by other reviewers. would decrease the noodles by half and doubling the broth volume, add a stalk of lemongrass, 2 tbs garlic chili sauce, 2 tsp ginger, cilantro, 1T. soy sauce, and consider substituting shrimp  for the chicken.

A sure winner! I found this recipe as a fluke, having chicken and cabbage on hand and searching for a quick winter's evening meal. The resulting "soup" was amazing in both flavor and consistency, as the recipe states, being closer to a stew than a soup. I followed the recipe, letting each person decide if/how much chili paste to add, and even my picky teenage daughter loved it.

Very easy to make and delicious.  I had trouble with the chicken though.  The chicken breasts did not cook as tenderly as I would have liked.  I was not able to shred the chicken which was recommended and would have enhanced the dish.
Any idea what I did wrong.

Really enjoyed this.  I didn't have any leeks so I substituted shallots.  I also added fish sauce as was mentioned in other reviews.   I put in few cloves of garlic.   It really is a simple recipe to make and was delicious.  Instead of cooking the noodles in the soup I prepared them separately and put them in the bowl with the soup on top.  Served it with the chili sauce on the table.  My wife loved it so much that we had the leftovers for dinner the next night.  The beauty of this recipe is that you can take the basics and put some of your own touches in and it stays delicious.

added radish, fish sauce, lime and soy sauce.  Omitted noodles in favor of serving with a side of jasmine rice. Just wish I had some cilantro. What a great used for leftover cabbage and left over leeks.

We loved this recipe - it was filling, but light. Needed some salt for our taste. Made a few additions as per other reviews: added fish sauce, dried lemon grass, and kaffir lime leaves. Used half a cabbage, as the one we had was humongous. Added garlic & ginger. I will try it with thighs next time.

Made this yummy soup.  The easiest recipe and makes a huge pot.  More like a stew than soup.  I added a bit of Thai hot sauce for a little kick.  Will definitely make again.

This is my favorite soup of all time!  I use a rotisserie chicken from the store, don't add noodles, and use about a tsp of sriracha sauce.  I don't care if it does or doesn't taste Thai-like.  It's just really good soup.

This was ok but it didn't stand out as very flavorful. I used 2 tsp of Thai chile sauce and added a little salt.

I had left over chicken, noodles and some shredded cabbage, so I decided to make this soup for our supper.  It was a big hit with the family. Easy and tasty!   It hit the spot on a sub zero, winter evening. I added some fresh cilantro, after ladling the soup into our bowls.  Heat wise, this is mild.  If you like it spicy, like I do, just add more chili sauce to your bowl.

Oh my goodness, this was so yummy!  My store didn't have the Thai chili sauce so I couldn't try that. But I added soy sauce instead.  I also added LOTS of fresh, grated ginger, chopped radishes (to boost nutrients), and baby corn.  I topped it with lots of fresh, green onions. It was really tasty  I will definitely make it again, but I'll grab the Thai chili sauce when I go to town so I can try that.  Great recipe!

OMG good! I didn't have thge thai chili sauce so I substituted with about a tablespoon of NM Chili powder, a dash of Cayenne pepper & ground red pepper. After reading the reviews I also added 1 TBSP of brown sugar. I do not have leeks so I added 2 TBSP garlic and about 3/4 cup of onion... I cut back a little on the noodles.... I just finished my "sample bowl" and it was very good!

Good soup and so easy to make. I don't think you need the egg noodles, if you want to spare some calories (or for me, weight watchers points).

Made this soup yesterday and it is GREAT!!!  LOVE it!!!!  Made mine with more broth than called for as I packed the ingredients into a dutch oven.  It still didn't have enough broth BUT it really is a hearty soup that is very filling without all that broth.  I will try to freeze some in wide mouth canning jars and add more broth to it so it freezes well.  If you try this, make sure you have adequate room for expansion when it freezes!  Thank you for a yummie recipe that is easy, good for you, and filling!

My family and i loved this soup. I used vermicelli noodles, green onion (instead of leak) and Tai Garlic Chilli sauce (as well as sweet chilli sauce) as that is what i had on hand. My husband and i added HoiSin and Sriracha sauce in our own bowls to our tastes.. and the kids either leave it as it or add some Hoisin.. they call it asian chicken noodle soup.  SO good.. So easy .. and healthy! I served with low fat chicken cilantro dumplings. Will be making this MANY more times. THANKS!

Absolutely delicious!  Husband turned his nose up at it when he saw me making it as he is not a fan of cabbage; However, he really enjoyed it and said he was surprised by how good it was.  Definitely needs the Thai sauce though.  I added some while simmering but also added more to each individual serving.

This a very good base recipe with room to grow. I usually add lemongrass, kafir lime leaves, and dried chilis.  If you have the time, let the lemongrass simmer for awhile (30-60 mins) before you put the cabbage and noodles in for the last 5-10 mins

I made this for a Wednesday meal at church and it received rave reviews.  I did make some changes.  I added fish sauce, ginger, lemon grass and sesame oil as suggested by other reviewers. I bought a cold roasted chicken(lemon herb flavor) from grocery store, pulled off meat and made the stock with the bones.   Since it was going to be kept warm over a long period of time I didn't use the noodles. They would have soaked up all the broth. Everyone said it tasted like soup from the Chinese restaurant.  I will definitely make this soup again.

I really liked it and so did my husband.  It not only tastes good but it's good for you.  I used Iron Chef Thai Sweet Chile Sauce in it.  I wasn't sure if we would like it but it was even more delicious.  Trader Joe's carries sliced frozen leeks that simplified it.  Nancy

Nice! Hmm! Chili sauce in a 'typical' chicken noodle soup. The chili sauce was a surprisingly nice touch as is.   CROCKPOT FRIENDLY! This is a very versatile soup base, as discovered when comparing it to similar soups.   Freeze some 'base' & serve 'typically' (dumplings, potatoes, rolled pasta). OR use a touch less broth or up the carrots and *maybe* cut the cabbage back or ?maybe? skip it altogether, & fully skip the meat & pasta, & puree! A great pureed, carrot soup, hot or cold! Make a double/triple batch, puree one part. Use on part for chunky soup: when time to serve, add a bit more broth IF needed, chicken, pasta (or rice, or maybe even rice noodles, or buckwheat soba, change it sometimes), & if you are like me, some spinach, cilantro, &/or sliced green onion for color, vitamins & flavor (peas, snow peas or anything green would work nicely). Other seasonings that go well with this as an oriental soup include: 2'sh Tbsp. of lime juice, soy sauce, &/or smooth peanut butter (natural works fine, especially for the pureed portion). Also, in smaller doses, a touch of sugar &/or sesame oil. For any pureed portion of the soup, some soy milk or dairy of choice will add a nice creamy touch. Deciding to add more of one seasoning to one half of the soup, & more of another seasoning to the other half of the soup, while adding pasta & meat to the one and adding dairy to the other helps us make one pot of soup into two rather distinct creations. Now, that's my idea of great cooking!

Pick a thai sauce you like and a good quality chicken broth.  I used less noodles than called for and we found that we had to add more Thai sauce to make it spicy.  If we have it again, I'd use a garlic chili sauce.  Not our favorite recipe, but decent.

Thank you so much for sharing this recipe!! I was looking for a chicken-cabbage soup recipe; had leftover chicken, a bit of stock, a head of cabbage and a few other odds & ends ingredients that I didn't know what to do with them, but this recipe helped me tremendously!   I had to improvise somewhat, but the end result  rocked the house! I used diced jalapenos and red onion in place of the chile sauce and leeks (which I didn't have), as well as whole wheat pasta instead of egg noodles. Topped it off with a dollop of sour cream and chopped cilantro. YUM!!!!

Loved it.  We used 2 heaping T of the sweet chili sauce and a large onion instead of the leeks.  I tasted it before the chili sauce and it was chicken noodle soup.  After the sauce it was asian.

This soup is amazing!  I am trying to make new soups and I had all the ingredients for this one, so decided to try it.  I did steal ideas from other reviewers to make it more Thai: added 3 stalkes of lemon grass added bok choy with cabbage added 5 cloves of garlic used noodles from the asian market and added separately Loved it!  The chili sauce really made this.  My partner ate this down so fast and I thought he would not like it!  I would have given 5 stars, but without the additions, it would have been a bit boring.  Great soup base though!

I was so disappointed in this soup! I looked forward to it all day based on the rave reviews, and it turned out just terrible! I wish I understood where the raves are coming from... whether I did something wrong or not. I halved the recipe, and admittedly overcooked the noodles (I think the suggestion of cooking the noodles separately was a good one- wish I'd done it). But it seems like just a bland chicken noodle soup with cabbage in it, and the addition of the chili sauce just didn't "go". I love cabbage, I love chili sauce, and I LOVE THAI SOUPS!! This just didn't deliver. Bland bland bland.

I was looking for a nice soup recipe, knowing that the upcoming weekend was going to be pretty chilly, when I came across this recipe and decided to give it a try. It was amazing!! I'm already making my second pot this week! Next time I get sick, or anytime I just want some good soup, I know what's going on the stove!

My husband loved it.  If it is well shredded into very small shreds, the cabbage almost disappears so vegetable-haters will not even know it it there, and it sweetens the broth.  I used Thai chile paste and green and sweet onions because I did not have chile sauce or leeks.  It was very mild and tasty.  Not at all spicy-hot.

Made this tonight for the first time and ate two bowls (no guilt either)! Didn't have leeks so just used a chopped onion. Also added a little garlic & 1/2 bay leaf.  For something so simple, it's really good.  I will definitely make this again.

Made this to-night and my husband who says he doesn't care for regular chicken soup gave this five stars.Used chicken thighs, savoy cabbage,  zuchinni and  sweet Thai chili sauce. It really was the best!

I have to go back to making sure I read all the reviews before I start cooking - again I was in a rush and followed the recipe exactly.  Big MISTAKE.  It calls for too much noodles as others did say.  I cooked it to have for the following day so it looked alright when I put it in the refrigerator.  The next day when I took it out to serve there was NO broth in the pot - the noodles absorbed ALL of it. Had to add 32 more oz. of broth to the pot.  The following day I took out the leftovers and again there was NO more broth.  There was no way I was going to waste money and add MORE broth so I just put it in bowls, heated it up and passed around some soy sauce for the top.  I think we enjoyed it that way better than with the broth. I also agree with others that it is on the bland side - I tripled the amount of chile sauce.

I was so excitee about this recipe and so terribly disappointed.  I followed the recipe exactly.  It was completely bland.  I couldn't add enough of the Thai sauce--but there was still no flavor, only heat.  Family felt the same way.  Who can figure?

I did half the carrots and half the cabbage.... Also, I couldn't find "thai chili sauce" at my local rural store, so I settled with Garlic chili sauce... It turned out great. My sickey toddler's runny nose cleared up right away with the spice. Nice rainey day recipe!

Oh yeah, this is good! I didn't have the Thai sweet sauce but did have garlic chili sauce (vietnamese) so my soup turned out spicy hot but not too much! Perfect for my hubby who is fighting a head cold.

Very easy to make and lots of flavor.  I made this when I was home sick with a head cold.  Hit the spot.  I will definitely make this again.

Great!  This is the first recipe I've taken the time to review, just because it was sooo easy and good.  My husband only gave it 3 1/2 stars, but I'd give it 4.  Very easy- this recipe makes A LOT, and it is good for leftovers!  Thanks for this one.

This soup was delicious!  Our family eats a lot of Asian-inspired foods and loved this soup.  It is healthy, but don't let that fool you...it's actually good tasting, as well!  
Add salt and pepper to taste, btw.

I was so disappointed in this recipe because it did not taste good to me at all (I followed the recipe exactly). I thought it tasted too onion-y (from the leeks) and just too plain.  Maybe I don't like how it tastes because I had higher expectations (due to the positive reviews).  Thanks for sharing the recipe anyway, though I will not be making it again.
