It is difficult to find the proper chiles in the USA.  I used Anaheims, which were not spicy enough.  I am thinking a blend which results in a hot sauce - unfortunately it will not be yellow.

Honestly, I picked this so my family would have a vegetarian dinner, but I did not expect it to be special.  It was pretty on the plate.  

It really was amazing. The kids (ages 10 - 20) ate it so quickly!

Makes decent leftovers, too.

Made as written except the organic local grown "Yukon gold's" I purchased from my store ended up being white potatoes. I was not able to find yellow chile but used serrano as the recipe submitter mentioned in the footnotes. This was unique but good and is one I will make again.
