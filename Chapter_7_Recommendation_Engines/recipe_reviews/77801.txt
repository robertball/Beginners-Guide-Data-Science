I read the reviews on this turning out watery and was determined not to have that ending... so I tossed the brussels sprout halves in olive oil with salt and pepper and roasted them at 400 degrees for about 25 minutes instead of boiling them.  I also decreased the milk to 1/2 a cup and added 2 beaten eggs.  1 egg would probably have been enough.  The casserole wasn't watery at all.

I loved it! I made it without reading the reviews. So I felt I must comment. I didn't use mushrooms because I didn't have any. I didn't add the milk because i thought it looked like it had enough liquid. I only used half of the half and half. I should have used all the half and half because once it baked there was no liquid. It wasn't dry but there was no sauce to it. It tasted great but i wish there had been some liquid to it.

a really good recipe- just be sure to only use swiss cheese and not any other! I used a pre-shredded parmesan mozzarella and it was too watery.Otherwise it's tasty and very easy to make!

This was ok at best. Flavor was alright but something seems to be missing. I'm not sure if I'd try this one again.

I'm sorry but this just doesn't cut it. I love chicken mushrooms brussels sprouts and cheese. This is watery even with modifications. I hate to be harsh but I would not make this again.

My husband and I liked this recipe. My picky kids not so much. I substituted mozzarella for the Swiss cheese. I also omitted the milk. I mixed garlic powder salt and basil with the half and half/cheese mixture in the bowl. To add a crusty top I added gluten free bread crumbs to the top before baking. It made it nice and crispy.

We love Brussels sprouts. I will use more next time like 35. Roasted them in 400 degree oven for about 20 minutes as another suggested. Gave them a great flavor. Used coconut milk low fat cream cheese and sour cream as that's what I had instead of half and half and milk. Added 1 egg to sauce. This is so delicious. And yes Swiss cheese was perfect.

I tried this recipe tonight and we liked it even a picky five-year old. I don t think one should change too much the first time you try a new recipe but I didn t take half as much liquid but it was more a soup than a casserole anyway. The next time I think I will make a b√©chamel sauce and stir in the cheese.

Made this last night and will add it to the recipe rotation. My husband loves sprouts so he was pleasently surprised by it's addition to chicken. I read the reviews before making it so I did reduce the liquid a bit and added some bread crumbs on top. Very good and thanks for the recipe

This is so bad I created an account so I  could review. It's not just watery, the cream and milk curdled and all the water was expressed out. Even tho I only cooked the sprouts five minutes, they were mush by the time this was done. The chicken ended up way overcooked after pre frying then baking for an hour. Was barely edible. Only ate because of all expensive ingredients in it. Also completely blah.  Thumbs down!

This was really easy to make and delicious but not a light meal for something with brussell sprouts get ready to be full! Great family meal. I adjusted the liquids to 1/4 cup heavy cream 3/4 cup almond milk (that's all I had) and breaded the chicken so it likely made mine a bit heavier but it was delicious. I'm writing this the next morning and I'm still full.

I read the other reviews and roasted the sprouts first.  I also had cooked chicken to work with.  I added an egg to the milk...a 1/3 cup of so of sour cream I had around but left out half-and-half and water.  the only other change was to add a small can of chopped green chilis...as we like a southwestern flavor.    It held together, at the same time there was a bit of liquid at the bottom, which I drained off.  Was liked, and will make again.  Next time may roast mushrooms first to reduce excessl liquid.

It was delicious. But watery. I think if I make it again I'll make a "white sauce" and add the Swiss Cheese... this should retain the good taste but make it a bit "thicker".
