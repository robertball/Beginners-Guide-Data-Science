Excellent!  Although I used a gallon of ice cream and everyone loved it.  A keeper!

FABULOUS!!!  !  Made it for a bbq  and there was nothing left!  I followed the recipe exactly as written.  Next time though I'll spray the bottom of the pan more liberally than I did because the crust stuck to the bottom somewhat.  I made the crust the day before and then on the day of the bbq I added the ice cream, toffee bits and Magic Shell and froze till ready to serve.  Can't wait to make it again!!

Wonderful! I doubled the amount of Magic Shell, but other than that, everything else was the same. Taste was fantastic, and was a great first time ice cream cake! 10 stars if I could!!
