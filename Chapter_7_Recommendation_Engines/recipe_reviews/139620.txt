I was hesitant to make this at first but I was hungry, had all the ingredients at hand and  really didn't feel like eating fastfood. This is soo good. I even got an "mmm..mmm" from my hubby. Although I am not a big fan of canned tuna I do love avocados and keep finding ways to make it a part of my diet. Avocados are loaded with MUFA's (mono-unsaturated fat -->the good kind) which actually helps your body get rid of the "bad" fat. So Gracias for sharing this recipe!

I turned this into a salad by putting the tuna mixture on a bed of spinach that I had dressed with a simple olive oil/lemmon juice dressing.  I sliced the avocado and placed it around the mound of tuna.  Very nice presentation.

I also used this recipe to make a salad and made a few changes. I layered the bottom with lettuce. Added some lemon juice to the tuna mix. Then topped off with avocado and tomato slices. Turned out to be delicious!

I made this for a Spanish Tapas party, so I had to change the recipe slightly:  2 tortilla shells, butter both sides and heat on griddle to make crispy.  I then basically doubled the recipe (except I only needed 3 avocados and 3/4 red bell pepper and 4-5 green onions)  Cut the tortilla shells into eighths, place an avocado slice on the tortilla shell, top with a spoonful of the tuna mixture (I used a cookie scoop), and I placed a fresh cilantro leaf on top.    This made smaller portions for many hands at the party.  It was a huge hit!!

The tuna salad mixture is so good!  I didn't have green onion, so I substituted finely chopped vidaila onion instead and it's still fabulous!  I never thought to use basalmic vinegar and the avocado provides the perfect balance!  This is so good and will become a regular lunchtime staple!  Even after my gastric bypass, when my food choices are limited and I've developed aversions to certain foods, this is a perfect little meal for me!

Very good.  I'm always looking for something different, healthy and quick for lunch.  I used diet mayo and sliced the avocado into the tuna mix, then put it, open faced, onto a toasted whole wheat english muffin.  Presentation was not as nice, but it tasted great.

This is perfect!!!  A great light meal.  I added some fresh lemon juice and salt.  I also didn't have perfectly ripe avocados so I sliced some of the bottom off the avocado to create a flat surface.  This prevent the avacado half from rolling around on the plate.

Excellent. A terrific starter or lunch.  Full of flavor. Quick and easy to make with a few great ingredients. This is the way to cook and eat!   I love it!  We drank this with a Spanish white wine, Xarmant Txakoli (It's Basque. It was a nice wine. But better by its nature (bright, fresh, slightly effervescent, lowish in alcohol) with the Sizzling Sherry Shrimp with Garlic (also on Allrecipes). Next time I'll try a wine that's a little richer with this one.

awesome - but don't try to save time and food processor chop the red peppers, makes them runny and whole thing red and nasty looking.  HAND CHOP the red peppers and use celtic sea salt - yum!

This is very very good, but I choped up the avocados,  and topped the tuna mix with them... all on top of a bed of baby spinach as another reviewer suggested. No additional dressing needed, in fact I think any more seasoning would overwhelm the simple flavor of the avocados that really makes this dish so perfect. I'm sure its god the way its written, but I think the chopped up way is a lot easier to deal with at the table.

Delicious, easy and healthy!  I made this for a Spanish themed Cooking Club gathering and it was a huge hit.  I added a couple of extra dashes of balsamic vinegar and included chopped cilantro to the mix, but other than that, followed the recipe exactly.  Will definitely make this again and again!

This was very good.  I would reduce the amount of green onion for those who do not care for a strong onion flavor or dependent on the size of the onions.  I do like a little crunch, so would like a little celery or cucumber as well as a bit more acid but those are personal preferences.  The recipe is very good as written.

YUMMY!! I'm vegan, so I used this wonderful product called VegeTuna. I also diced my avocados and then scooped them out and mixed them in (gently) with the "tuna" mixture. I caved to peer pressure and added a 1/2 tsp. of lemon juice and went rogue by adding a few dashes of (vegan) Bacon Salt. It turned out goooood! Awesome summer meal.

This was a basic tuna salad recipe stuffed in an avocado.  I really enjoy the idea of tuna salad in an avocado and it has inspired me to think outside the box.  Next time I will try to put a Mexican spin on it by adding cumin, tomato and some chipotle to the dressing. The filing is a little dry as written; I did add an equal amount of plain yogurt to the mayonnaise for a little healthier version.  This is a solid base off of which you can customize to your own tastes.

This was really good! Nice, fresh and light! I used light mayo, and used about 1 3/4 Tbsp of mayo and about 2/3 of the required amount of tuna, it was lots! I used a little more than the required amount of red pepper and a bit more green onion too. I used garlic powder and grinded  a little fresh sea salt instead of garlic salt. Fresh ground pepper is great in it too! I also scooped out most of the avocado and mashed it in with the tuna mixture. Then placed it back in the avocado bowls. That tasted awesome!  I actually bought a bag of smaller, organic avocadoes which were really easy to pit than the larger ones. Overall awesome recipe! I think I might try stuffing them like this with baby shrimp or crab at some point too!

I made this as a full lunch recipe instead of tapas and made a small swap. Instead of filling the avocado with it, I smashed half an avocado with the tuna mixture and then filled two halves of red pepper with it instead of chopping those up. Delicious! 1 can of tuna is 1 serving for me as a meal that way.

I made a whole tapas lunch today and this was a good starter. Fresh, simple, nice to look at and above all, tasty. I forgot to add the pepper, which I think would have added a bit of necessary zest, but that's my fault and not the recipes. A great appetizer idea, as serving in the shells makes it easy to hold and eat.

This was absolutely delicious! I eat my tuna straight out of the can and this was SO much better I think I'll eat it this way from now on.  The added flavor of the avocado made this almost a comfort food for me! Unbelievable.

Try this with canned crab instead of tuna and it turns out amazing. One of my favorite dishes to do as a light entrée for hot summer days.

This was amazing and satisfying! My husband thought it was a tad too creamy for him but he doesn't like mayo! I didn't have green onion on hand so I used finely diced red onion. I also used a few drops of greek style vinaigrette instead of balsamic vinegar. This has become my favorite way to use tuna and avocado together, thanks so much for sharing!

In Phoenix, when the temps hit 120 degrees, these are a nice alternative to a hot meal for dinner. A couple of avocado halves and some cubed melon is perfect for a meal when it's too hot to cook.

Thanks for the idea!  I had everything but red pepper, and I did end up putting everything over some mixed greens since I wanted to use them up.  It was quite tasty, I never would have thought to put all of these ingredients together.  I think the red pepper would have been more important if I hadn't had the meal over mixed greens.

This was really good - I didn't have bellpepper so  I skipped that and I diced the avocado and mixed it all together.  It was a great lunch - I halved the recipe and ate that for lunch which wasn't really two portions, it seemed just right for lunch for one.  I also added a sprinkle of Old Bay, as others suggested, and that was very good.

This is delicious. I used light salad dressing, because I like it better than mayo. I also added some cucumber to give it a cool crunch. Yummy!

I ended up putting this atop some crusty bread and it was delish!! It was like a light sandwich - and was filling enough to pass as dinner. My husband and 6 year old fought over the last few bites! Very good - thanks for sharing!

Made this as a part lunch/part snack for work today - very tasty and easy.

Sent half of it off with my boyfriend as well and he texted me during the day "Thanks for the tuna surprise, it was delicious".

I don't like canned tuna, but after eating this I am a huge fan. The splash of balsamic with a pinch of garlic salt and fresh cracked pepper was all it took to perfectly season the tuna. The textures were the best thing; rich creamy avocado with the crunch of the bell pepper, a contrast perfectly balanced by the tuna. I didn't change the recipe at all, just added an extra drizzle of balsamic on top. Paired this with some yellow saffron rice (store bought because I was in a hurry).

This was a huge hit at my house!  I subbed black olives for red bell pepper and had enough tuna salad for 3 avocados.  I cubed the avocado and mixed it with the tuna for the kiddos, hubs ate his with a spoon, and I peeled mine and ate it without any utensils.  The balsamic complimented the avocado well.  This was the perfect lunch for a hot summer day.

Awesome! Made this as written and it turned out perfect. The balsamic vinegar puts it over the top. Definitely a keeper. Thank you  La Cocina de Redondita. *Update* As I was perusing my favorites folder in my recipe box I came across this recipe again. Since I have made it several times with chicken and tuna I thought, why not sausage. I eliminated the pepper and garlic salt since I was using Johnsonville mild Italian sausage. Made everything else as is and placed the warm sausage mixture over the avocado. Delightful, sausage and avocados are a perfect match.

Even my kids that don't like tuna liked it this way.  Something about the avocado makes tuna way better than it is on it's own.

These were pretty wonderful - rather filling, and easy to make (I admit I thought I could polish off two halves stuffed with tuna, but could only go through one half at a time!).  I doubled the recipe - used one whole pepper, and 5-6 green onions.  A great, healthy midday snack!

This was very excellent. I followed some suggestions to put in lemon juice, which was very nice. I also cut the avocado into 8ths and put it on some cut up corn tortilla for easier eating so that more people at a party could enjoy. Next time will toast the tortilla.

I mixed all the ingredients together and put on bread. I work crazy hours so I am hoping it will save well in the fridge...without the bread of course. I may make a salad out of it as well tomorrow.

I basically tried this to see if I could make plain 'ol avocado palatable to me. It's still a consistency thing so I was thinking "meh, it's okay." Then I grabbed half a lime and squeezed that bad boy into the mix and ! Whole 'nother level of tuna! Try getting some citrus in there and enjoy!

Used regular tuna and a whole pepper instead of half. Very tasty and a good change from the usual. Will definitely make this again! Oops, used yogurt instead of mayonnaise instead... Just personal preferences...

We loved this for it's great flavor and think this is a wonderful summer time recipe.  I actually poached a tuna steak the day before in olive oil using Chef John's Olive Oil Poached Tuna recipe, easy.  I had read some of the comments about the recipe being a little dry, but didn't want to add any more mayo so I simply diced a seeded plum tomato and that was a nice add.  Thank for this great recipe!

Delicious! I used white albacore packed in olive oil as my own preference and it turned out amazing!! I also scooped a little of the avocado out before packing it and mixed it into the tuna mixture so I could fit more tuna in each one... my family love them! Thank you for a great recipe I’ll be keeping around :)

Rated as written using low salt canned chicken breast,  1 tsp white balsamic vinegar and 2 Tbsp mayo. Vanished at a progressive dinner as the first course; at a tailgate party on baguettes with diced avocado garnish;   and devoured  by picky  small fry  in cherry tomatoes  after school. (Also lends itself well to additions) Thanks for a great recipe!

Awesome!  Easy , tasty, filling and healthy. What more could you ask.  I prepped the run salad at night and took it to work the following day.  Quick, and easy. Loved it.  This will be in my regular rotation.

My avocados weren't picture perfect, so I diced them and put them on top. I increased the green onion and added some dijon mustard and very finely diced garlic. The BIG wow here was adding balsamic vinegar to tuna! WOW! It has changed our tuna recipe for good now. This is light, healthy, and quick. Perfect on or as a salad or even on corn chips.

This was great, made it for my in-laws, they loved it. My avocados weren't the nicest, so I scooped them out and sliced them, arranged them on a plate, and put the tuna on top.  It's a perfect summer dish. I'm making it again for a pot luck next week.

I found this very tasty and filling! My family had a hard time getting over the visuals of it but I absolutely loved it!  Look and taste! I couldn't believe how filling it was. Half an avocado was a meal.

We had a typical crazy day and made it home realizing we had planned nothing for dinner for the night. Having 3 young kids makes meals challenging because the different tastes of each find a way to make even the easiest kid friendly meal a problem. 
We did change this slightly. We have an onion allergy in the house, so we left the scallions off. And we didn't have enough tuna on hand, so we subbed canned chicken (always used when we make chicken salad) for the kids instead. The minor tweaks didn't change the fact that this was a total hit. My picky 6 year old ate everything but the red bell pepper. My 2 and 8 year olds ate every bite. Hands down, the best "Hmmmm, what can I make with what we have on hand" dinner we've had in a LONG time.

Very yummy!! Everything blends together so well and the tuna isn't overpowering. Paired with some Costa Rican style rice and beans and roasted broccoli. One of my favorite meals in a while :)

Simple and easy to make! Very tasty! I made it with Salmon instead of tuna and it was awesome!  That was the only variation I did with the recipe and will try it again with tuna.  It would also be good with chicken!

I made this for lunch today & my BF raved about it! I followed the recipe as written except substituted fresh minced garlic & a little sea salt for the garlic salt. I discovered that shaving off a little of the avocado peel from the "bottom" helps keep it steady on the plate. While its a beautiful presentation in the avocado half, it's a little awkward to eat that way. Next time, I think I'll just serve the tuna salad on a bed of lettuce & add sliced avocado on the side. This was definitely a hit & I look forward to making it again SOON. Thank you so much for sharing this recipe!

Excellent! I never though to add balsamic vinegar to tuna salad - or serve it in an avocado! I didn't have green onion, so I used chopped sweet onion. I added a little extra mayo, and an extra dash of balsamic to keep the mayo to balsamic ratio the same.

Very good, I had to use a bit more mayo.  I doubled the recipe, it was very good in the avocado and was equally as good just eating it on salad.  I'm not sure I can ever eat tuna regular again!

Very easy, quick and tasty.  As we were having this for dinner, I scooped out all the avocado, mixed half in with the tuna which I put over mixed greens and then sprinkled the other half of the diced avocado over that along with some halved cherry tomatoes with a few extra dashes of balsamic.  I see this becoming part of the summertime rotation.

These were pretty good.  I liked the texture of the avocado with the tuna.  I also really liked the flavor of the tuna... We ate it on a bed of lettuce... I would try this again.

It's delicious. Mine turned out exactly as pictured. I could eat this all day and every day (assuming I'm still on the Mediterranean diet and I'm not eating my favorites like mashed potatoes and biscuits and gravy). I wondered before I made it how I was going to eat with the avocado peel intact -- when I make this the next time, I'll skip the boat servings and just stack the tuna mixture over the top of the scooped out avocado.

I really liked this but did make some changes to brighten us up. I used another tablespoon of mayonnaise. Squeezed juice from  1/2 a lime. Then I added about  2-3 tablespoons on minced cilantro. Then mixed the filling together and garnished with some fresh cilantro leaves. I served it as a meal with corn on the Cobb and sliced fresh tomatoes. Everyone loved it! Yum.

This recipe seemed like a quick, easy, and refreshing. I bought all the ingredients; however, my avocados were not ready, and my daughter wanted to go ahead with this. I added more mayonnaise to get a creamier texture and more garlic salt/salt to taste. I split the mixture into two bowls, and we thought it was great. I plan to try it with a different pepper next time and possibly something else to elevate the taste. If you wanted to not use an avocado, I think this would taste excellent spread over a nice toasted piece of bread.

Since I'm cooking for one, I cut down the ingredients, using only one avocado and a 5 oz can of tuna. I substituted relish for the onions and pepper.  The combination of flavors, especially the tuna and avocado, was delicious!

I found large chunk Ahi Tuna at Costco along with their great avocados.  Made this for a light dinner and it was a hit.  Super easy to make and the ingredients are all things you would have around the kitchen.  Definitely a keeper.

Basically this is a great idea to turn your favorite Tuna Salad into a bread free meal. The recipe itself is easy and does make for a good Tuna Salad, I'll likely try mixing it up with my own variations...in the end I'm glad to have found it.

Delicious! I made it exactly like the recipe. My husband and I were pleasantly surprised how yummy the balsamic vinegar is with tuna. Unfortunately it was just too much flavour for my children’s young tastebuds. They like eating the avocado on it’s own, but I will certainly try to make it for them again. On a side note, I felt like it was missing something, so I grabbed a lemon and squeezed the juices on mine and YUUUM! Makes a perfect healthy snack or lunch. One good (or bad) thing about this recipe is if you are NOT an avocado lover (like my husband), the flavours of the filling definitely hide the avocado flavour, but if you are an avocado lover (like myself and my kids), it’s slightly disappointing. The filling is so good though, I want to put it on bread next time! Overall, I’m really happy with it and will certainly make it again and again...with avocado! I’m sure my kids will come to love it.  :)

Aquí en Costa Rica están los mejores atunes, aguacates y tomates. Hay recetas peruanas similares a esta. Uso mayonesa peruana y cilantro local. Para mí, como tanto, ¡se convierte en un plato principal!

I only had white onion but that worked fine. I also added 1/4 cup cottage cheese because I love it.  I wish I had added tomato's too. I just cut the avocado and put it in the salad. Great lunch and easy.

This was great! I didn't have green onions, so I put some hot red pepper flakes in to give it a bit of zip. I also topped it with some tomato slices because I had a tomato lying around and thought it would look/taste good. I'm planning to make this again next time I'm hosting.

I love avocado and tuna and thought this would be good. Very disappointing. Not good at all.

This is a great and easy dish to serve as a snack or appetizer. Tune the balsamic vinegar to suit your tastes. It's also good with some smoked paprika on top. Use a 5.5 oz can of tuna (or more avocado), because a 12 oz can is waaaaaay too much. I also found that the format of tuna on half avocados hard to eat. Instead I lay a bed of sliced avocado and spread the tuna on top.

I made these for my Spanish boyfriend last night and he loved them. He is a big fan of Ecuadorian tuna and had given me a few cans when he made a recent purchase as it is hard to find. I used that in this recipe and I was very impressed with the results.

Fantastic recipe!  I sliced up the avocado and serve it all over a bed of spring mix tossed in lemon juice and olive oil.  Absolutely delicious and I will make again.

Did I think putting mayonnaise, tuna and avocado together was a good idea? No! But looking at these ratings, I decided I had to give it a shot! Surprise, surprise: its gross. This slippery and flavourless dish could be vastly improved upon by substituting the avocado for bread, or tomatoes instead of the peppers. The further you stray from the recipe the better

If your trying to find ways to avoid bread then this recipe is for you. I used things I had on hand & made my own version. Using chopped red bell pepper, yellow onion & cayenne pepper. I placed it onto of a small avocado, cut in half & that was my lunch. Very filling, super quick & tasty!

This has become our Saturday 'go-to' lunch.  Quick and easy. I usually double the filling as we love the flavours.  I also drizzle some really good Kalamata olive oil over the top for an added burst.  So delicious and healthy. I do use homemade mayo as it's so much better tasting than store bought.

Really good, addictive good! This is coming from someone who doesn't care for tuna salads or casseroles. I used the mixture to stuff a tomato (very tasty) and hubs enjoyed it in the avocado! Would have never thought to add a little balsamic to it. Perfect as written! Thank you for sharing such a healthy recipe!

True story: I've always hated tuna. That said, a new house-mate loves his tuna, so I found this recipe hoping to find a way to make tuna palatable for me. This was it. Quick, easy, healthy, and tasty!  Because I like finger food, the only change I made was peeling the avocados as well.

This was just okay for me.  I am not a big tuna fish fan but love to try new tuna recipes.  This one did not have enough flavor other than tuna for my taste. Is a very healthy meal though.

This would only be a light lunch for 4 small ladies. If I tried to fee feed this to my 6'4" husband our 6'2" son, their comment would be be "Well, that's a tasty little morsel. What's for dinner?"
It would do fine for my sister and I, but even we would have some fresh bread with it.

Probably due to the season, my avocado needed to be trimmed.  I chopped up the flesh and piled it in... pretty good!  Next time, and there will be a next time, I will treat the cut avocados to a lemon juice spritz and be sure to test the tuna mixture ftor salt.
My daughter and son-in-law loved it,  especially the texture; I used a light touch stirring it so the 'cado, tuna and red pepper had distinctive and different mouth-feel.

I had to make changes just because I did not have all of  the ingredients. I used green pepper instead of red, yellow finely diced onion and a Tbsp of chives instead of green onion and no balsamic vinegar so I used apple cider vinegar and 1/2 tsp splenda. These were still very good. I will make them again.

I made this for lunch, today, with two tweaks--one was of necessity, and one was an accident, lol!  The first--my red bell pepper had lost a bit of firmness, and I chose to make this with an orange bell pepper.  The second--I misread the ingredients, and put in only 6 oz. of tuna.  I don't think either of my tweaks hurt this recipe.  In fact, I don't think I will ever use 12 oz. of tuna in this.  I used probably 1 teaspoon of balsamic vinegar.  Thanks for this tasty use for tuna!

I saw this recipe in the magazine and tried it while on a road trip. I didn't have onions so I put some of a quinoa salad I made in it and I used the rip-open tuna packets and it was wonderful! Definitely will be making this again when I'm home.

This was delicious! I stuffed little mini bell pepper halves with this to bring to a party.  I forgot the black pepper, but it wasn't noticeable, I used 2 cans of tuna and only 2 green onions, half of a red bell pepper, the rest of the ingredients per recipe and some fresh chopped cilantro leaves and 1/2 teaspoon of Tajin seasoning (chili lime seasoning).  I stirred in 1/2 of a large diced avocado.  BIG HIT and very satisfying!

I really wanted to like this, but I ended up throwing out some of it. If I make again, I'll leave out some of the green onions- or all of them.

Quick  and easy, super tasty. I added celery to the mix and served them over a bed of Romaine to make it  a salad.

This recipe made a very refreshing salad. To make it in salad form I chopped up some romaine lettuce then for the dressing I did 1/4cup Olive oil and 1/8cup lemon juice the sprinkled with some more garlic salt. PS. I doubled the recipe to make a meal size salad for my husband and I.

Made as written.  This is good; not great... but good.  It is really nothing more than tuna salad in an avocado half.  I liked it ok.  I bet it would be better with crab or chicken, or lime juice on the tuna.

Tasted as I went along and ended up adding onion powder, garlic powder, red pepper flakes, and served with lime wedges. Huge hit!

This was delicious. Even my picky - eater husband loved it. To cut down on the fat I scooped out about a tablespoon of the avocado and used it instead of the mayo.

I made this with the red pepper removed and cilantro added.  It was amazing.   I've started using avocados in everything lately, so I tend to have the ingredients around.  Try adding crushed red peppers.

You can also slice up the avocado and make a sandwich out of it.

Really good. I had all the ingredients the first time and served it on a bed of lettuce. Second time no avocado or green onions so I just used a little regular onion. Still very good.

I think this is a great recipe.  Very good.  Only change I made was that I ended up using three times the amount of mayonnaise.  Still didn't look as creamy as the recipe photo, but was very good.

Made this with fresh tuna and wasabi mayo and added some minced garlic and a dash of hot sauce.  I recommend scooping out an dicing the avocado and adding to the mix.  This will leave a much larger shell to fill, and be easier to eat.  It was delicious though and will definitely make again.

I make this on a semi-regular basis.  I use fresh tuna instead of canned to reduce our sodium intake; I also change the garlic salt to garlic powder for the same reason.  I used four different colored peppers, just to give it some color.  Finally, I served it on a bed of lettuce.

I made this tonight and the tuna filling was yummy! It's funny, I Love avocados and I Love tuna.. but not necessarily together like this. The avocado cooled down the tuna and the spices too much. I think next time I would spoon the tuna into something else like a pita. Would make again! Thanks!

I decided to go with smoked salmon, leaving out the mayonnaise.  I also substituted bell peppers with cherry tomatoes and doused it with rice vinegar.  Very yummy!!! :)

I tried this the moment I saw it. I don't like red peppers and didn't have green onions but it turned out amazing with out them. I also added fresh parsley and more vinegar. I love vinegar and the avocado balenced it really well. Overall a very good recipe. Next time I'll add chopped celery and white onion.
