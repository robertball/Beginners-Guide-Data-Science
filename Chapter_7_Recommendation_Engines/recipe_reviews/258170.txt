The taste of this was very good but it was a bit too runny. It never thickened. Maybe the ratio of white chocolate to heavy whipping cream is wrong. If I make it again I will add more white chocolate or less heavy whipping cream.

Mine was also very runny. I think the method is flawed.

Delicious, and so easy. I drizzled it over a double fudge bunt cake and it was great!
