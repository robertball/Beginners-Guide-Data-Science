You can make a Breakfast dish from the left overs!

I got RAVE reviews from my family when I made breakfast with the left over stuffing! I mixed up 6 eggs, milk and some additional sugar and cinnamon – I added stuffing until the mixture was well saturated, and still had a little egg liquid to it. I then put it in a Bunt cake pan (just to make it pretty – but you could put it in anything) and put it in a 350 degree oven for about 40 min. But I really just needed to keep checking it until the egg mixture was all cooked through. You can then dust the top with some powdered sugar, and maybe some dried cranberries for a nice presentation. My guests ate it with butter and maple syrup, and I also had one guest that ate it spread with light cream cheese (for a less sweet option)

With all the egg in it – this bunt cake stretch very far when served with some bacon and fruit for a very nice, post Thanksgiving breakfast. I served 6 adults – and still had a few slices left over.

My guests liked the stuffing this way, better than they did for the Thanksgiving dinner. For dinner, they missed the more traditional stuffing that we usually serve.

Superb. For the past three years I've hosted a pre-Thanksgiving dinner with my friends at college. Every year I've used this recipe and it's never failed to be a hit. 

I always use an extra touch of butter, and last year I threw some rosemary and poultry seasoning into the mix. Worked wonderfully. The apple cider is always a good call. So are the raisins. 

Highly recommended, especially for vegetarians and anyone willing to try something a little unconventional.

This is the best sweet stuffing that I have ever had. I used corn bread instead of the Italien bread and added a little more apple cider to make it more moist. My husband thought it was the best ever.

I made this stuffing for Thanksgiving.  All the fruit made it a wonderful change from typical stuffing.  Everyone loved it!
I'll definitely make it again, though I might add a bit more cider next time.

I used left-over challah bread and my own home-made cranberry sauce. The stuffing turned out really not sweet enough for my taste, and I am sorry to have wasted my good cranberry sauce. Maybe it would taste better stuffed inside the turkey?

Great Recipe, I have never been a stuffing fan and typically would eat it only to be polite. But this is a great alternative to the same old stuffing! Great with yams and cranberry sauce and tastes amazing both fresh and as leftovers. I also added some cream sherry to the recipe for a little extra kick, gave it a spiced rum flavor similar to rum cake. Might try strait out Captain Morgan next time!!!

This stuffing was really good! The only thing is the nutmeg is very over powering with all of the other flavors going on. I actually used some poultry seasoning instead and a tiny tiny bit of nutmeg. I made it with grilled chicken, but truthfully, I wanted to put vanilla ice cream on it! Very sweet for a side dish.

Yummy if you like fruity stuffing like I do.  It makes the house smell good too.  I could only get French bread, so it was a little soggy.  I should have bought the bread earlier and let it get more stale.

Maybe the Granny Smith apples and whole cranberry sauce were too sour or something?  Or maybe it was the orange and/or lemon zests?  It just wasn't tasty to me, so I didn't serve it as I had wanted.

I've make this stuffing every Thanksgiving and my family loves it. I haven't modified the recipe very much, but did try it with a mix of rye and sourdough a few times and it was still awesome. I think the slight sourness of the bread went well with the sweet raisins, apples and cider. I also dry the bread out a bit by putting it in oven for 15 minutes before mixing everything up. This was the first year that I didn't host Thanksgiving and my daughter begged me to make it for us at home. A definite keeper!!!
