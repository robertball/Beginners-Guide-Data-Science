I made the rub as instructed and used on seared pork chops done on my mini George Foreman. Just the right touch for the chops. Will make again- my family loved it. Paired with some homemade Ricotta and Fennel bread I made in my bread machine and Apple Broccoli slaw with low calorie Asian Vinaigrette recipe from AR and had dinner prep done in 20 minutes.

This turned out really good on some bone in pork chops I grilled. This would work nicely on salmon too. Toasting the seeds first really makes a difference in the flavor so I do not recommend skipping that step.
