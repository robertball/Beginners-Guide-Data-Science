It's barely the beginning of the fall baking season and I'm already a little weary of the pumpkin, cinnamon, maple and other typical fall baked treats.  This was a refreshing break. As this was baking I already decided it was worth it for the aroma alone - SO fragrant of fresh orange.  It must have been a combination of the recipe itself, my adding two tablespoons of vegetable oil to ensure a moist cake, and cutting back on the baking time by several minutes that I did not experience the dryness other reviewers reported. This cake is soft, with a dense but tender crumb, very light, buttery (I did use butter rather than the margarine called for)  and prominently, pleasantly orange. The term "glaze" in the recipe is misleading, as this is really not a glaze at all.  It's actually a flavored simple syrup that soaks into the cake, infusing it with added moisture and flavor and should not be skipped or altered. A delightful change from heavily spiced, heavily frosted or overly sweet treats.  Delicious, satisfying and very pretty too.  Whether or not the the cake would turn out as good and moist without the 2 T. of oil I added, I'm not sure - what I do know is that if you add it, you won't be sorry. And be careful not to overbake!

Every Christmas for as long as I can remember, my mother makes orange loaves and delivers them to the neighbours.  She was improvising on another loaf recipe, though, and most often the loaves would fall, although they tasted great!  I took her recipe, and came on-line.  Lo and behold if this orange loaf isn't EXACTLY the same as mom's, except for a bit of extra flour, which is all that was needed to keep it nice and rounded on the top.  I emailed mom with the recipe, which she used this year.  Thanks for helping improve on one of my favourite Christmas traditions!  As for the glaze, Mom's loaf only called for half of this one, and I thought the amounts listed here would make way too much.  I made 2 loaves at once---one with only half the glaze(like mom's), and one as this recipe calls for.  I liked this one the best.  It made the loaf nice and moist.  Just be sure to let the loaf sit as required to let the glaze soak in.  Thanks again-- this is a great loaf, and I've made 8 of them to give away in the last 
month, following in my mother's footsteps.

The flavor of this bread was oh so orange! Quite delightful. However, I'm giving it 4 stars because the "glaze" was too liquidy to be considered a glaze. I followed the recipe exactly and it made so much that I think it calls for reducing the "sugared juice" in the pan to thicken it into a glaze. Otherwise it was very good!
Update: Made it again and this time simmered the glaze until it redused to about half and then removed the bread from pan and brushed it on. Came out much better! 5 Stars! On a side note, I accidently added only 1/2 cup sugar to the bread and it still came out delightful! Great way to cut back!

This first time I made this, I think I must have accidentally used too much flour, because I felt it was too dry.
I just made it again, but this time I used pineapple juice instead of orange juice, and threw in some pineapple chunks into the batter. I cannot tell you how unbelievably moist and delicious it is. I`m hard pressed not to eat the whole thing myself.
I also poured the batter into two, much smaller sized bread pans and baked them for only 25 minutes at 150 degrees celsius, and they turns out perfect.

This is one of the best "breads/cakes" i've ever made.  I made the recipe just as it reads until I got to the glaze. I added about 6-8oz of orange marmalade in a sauce pan first, then added the orange juice and sugar. I let that simmer for about 3 minutes. I can't image the cake any other way. I totally recommend this recipe and I'm debating making another loaf right now.

My husband said the bread was good but not "out of this world."  I added a little extra orange juice to the bread and halved the sauce/glaze.  If I were to make it again, I might increase the amount of orange zest.

Very good.  Much like a pound cake which is what I wanted.  I used an 8x8 square dish and only baked for 45-50 minutes.  The glaze came out fine but I wish I had made it thicker by letting it simmer down, stirring constantly, until it coats the spoon like thick syrup.  As it was it was a bit thin and permeated the cake a little more than I wanted.

Thanks for the fantastic recipe for Orange Loaf, Carol~!! I agree that using butter is better for bringing out the orange taste. Besides, I have added an extra of 2T olive oil, as suggested by another reviewer, which made the loaf moistened beautifully. For the "glaze", it really helps to bring an additional orange flavor and helps lighten up the surface of the loaf. Great idea for the glaze!! This recipe will be used in the rest of my life, for SURE :)

This is a nice loaf. I made it in 3 mini loaf pans and they took about 40 minutes to bake. I added 1/4 teaspoon of orange extract to the batter along with the rind and orange juice. The loaves would be pretty dry without the glaze so I wouldn't recommend skipping it. I thought that 1/4 cup sugar wasn't enough to make a syrupy glaze so I increased it to 1/2. I also added the juice from 1/2 a lemon, which made the glaze more tart and citrusy. I didn't use all of it on the loaves because I was afraid to make them too soggy, but I think I probably could have used it all without a problem.

This bread tasted good however I would only use half of the glaze the next time I bake this orange loaf.  I may even try sprinkling powdered sugar on top instead of the glaze.  I didn't really care for the glaze and thought that the bread could be fine without it but my husband said it needed a little.

Glaze tip:  Poke holes with a toothpick all over the loaf before drizzling glaze on warm loaf.  This will distribute the glaze into the loaf as well as on top.  Wrap in foil for 24 hours (or not) to let the flavor drench the loaf.

This needed more orange flavor.  I added fresh oranges and extra orange zest, still not enough flavor.  I was expecting more of a sweet cake, but it was somewhat bland.

Great flavour, however I found it very crumbly compared to other recipes I have made.  I will be looking for another Orange Loaf which might be more to my liking.

Not sure about kid friendly but husband friendly *S*... Love the loaf and the orange flavor! Didn't use the glaze. We like cream cheese frosting and I will try that next time! Made the loaf twice now and WILL be trying it again... THANK YOU FOR POSTING IT! Lorraine

I really enjoyed this quick bread. It has a really strong and rich orange taste which I loved. I even tried it with chopped pecans mixed in the batter. It was great! This is a great recipe to try for those who love quick breads.

This is the third time ive made this, and cant get the top to stay up. Im baking at an elevation of 9000 feet and i've done the usual high altitude stuff like more liquid, higher temp, and less leavening agent. but alas it never rounds off, always sunken in the middle. other than that everyone loves the taste and cant get enough of it.

This is a light tasting quick bread, as opposed to your traditional banana or pumpkin loaf.  My teens really liked it.  If you are missing a strong orange taste fresh squeeze your oranges for the juice and zest a whole orange.  Great flavor. I would bake it next time as 2 smaller loaves because it rose so much the glaze was spilling over.

Very easy to make but not the light spring citrus cake that I was looking for.  I did follow the recipe exactly other than adding a little orange extract.  The orange taste was perfect but I did not like the dense texture or the crust.  Maybe the cook time needs to be changed and using butter instead or margarine cold also improve the cake, not a recipe that I will be using again.

A lovely twist on a citrus bread.   Didn't need the glaze (we don't care for  this type bread if it is too sweet) but added more orange rind and a handful of dried cranberries really make it interesting.

I've made this bread many times and I think it is super.  I always follow the recipe exactly with no complaints as it is written.  I think the glaze is supposed to be thin.  I pour the hot glaze over the hot loaf and just let it sit in the pan.  Eventually the glaze absorbs into the cake, leaving a moist, delicious bread.  Im happy with it!!

Its a wonderful orange flavored loaf. I substituted 1 cup all purpose flour to 1cup whole wheat flour and reduced sugar to 3/4 cup. I used vegetable oil instead of margarine and added just 1tbsp of butter for flavor. I increased the orange juice to 1/2 cup and 2tbsp and skipped the nuts( daughter does not like these) The result was a wonderful orange loaf. Thanks for the great recipe!!!

The recipe was quick and easy, as advertised, and tasted awesome. I had a lot of really icky oranges I needed to get rid of, and this did the trick.
A couple of notes:
1. I live in Colorado Springs, so adding more flour is a must, the center of this bread sank, and it was done about 20 minutes earlier than the recipe called for. I narrowly escaped it being burned.
2. From previous experience, do NOT use white sugar for the glaze. Glazes require powdered sugar in order to make it thick, and it needs A LOT of powdered sugar. I had probably 2 cups of glaze.

But this recipe was awesome, and don't be afraid to add more zest than the recipe called for.

This was a good breakfast bread.  I made some changes after reading the reviews.  I added some oil to keep it moist and I reduced the orange glaze to make sure it wasn't too runny.  As soon as the bread came out of the oven I pricked it with a fork all over.  Then when I drizzled the glaze over the bread it seeped down into those fork holes and really made the bread more moist and orangey throughout.

A pleasant and welcome surprise. The only change I made was to use butter rather than margarine and cut back a bit on the sugar (3/4 cup).  I tried it with and without the glaze and while it is five-star worthy to me without the glaze, adding it takes the orange flavor over the top and makes it really special.  Walnuts are delicious but not necessary, I'd try swapping them for chocolate chips if you are serving this to someone with a nut allergy.  Thanks for sharing!

This is fantastic! The flavor was perfect. I ended up making 6 extra loafs over Christmas time per multiple requests. My only problem was it was a bit dry so I added 1/4 a cup of oj per loaf and it turned out great!

This loaf was outstanding! My husband loved it! I used butter instead of magarine and reduced the orange zest to like 1/2 because I couldn't get any more off the Valencia orange I was using. I sent some over to the neighbor, an elderly couple, and they loved it too!

This was very easy to make and had a nice aroma. My boyfriend thinks it's ok and my mother likes it. For some reason, the taste reminds me of cereal which I'm not too fond of. I may make it again at a later date.

This was really easy to put together with all ingredients on hand.  I would have to say the glaze made this loaf stand out, and gave it that extra punch.  The bread part by itself would have gotten 4 stars, but with the glaze-it is a 5 star all the way.  loved it!

This is a wonderful recipe.  YUMMY!  I added a little orange food coloring just for fun.  I would check this just before an hour next time.  Also, I made this for a shower where the theme was tropical and omitted the sauce that goes on top so that it would match the other breads we had.  So, I can't wait to try it again with that delicious-sounding sauce!!!  Very, very good!!!

I really like this recipe. It is more of a pound cake than a bread which is just what I wanted. I subbed butter for the margarine but otherwise didn't change the loaf recipe. I DID change the glaze. This is what I used: 1 cup sugar, 1 cup orange juice, 1/2 stick butter, 1/4 cup rum. I boiled the juice and sugar until it began to thicken then carefully added the butter, then the rum. I boiled it just a bit more then gradually poured it over the loaf. It a took a few times over the course of 10 minutes to get the loaf to absorb all the glaze. It turned out spectacular! Perfect for the holidays.

I made this loaf with my own little twist to it so I could use up some leftover pomegranate juice I didn't drink because it was too strong. It made for a very delicious bread though. Instead of 1/2 cup orange juice, I used 1/4 cup orange juice and 1/4 cup pomegranate juice and I did the same thing to make the glaze and it made a very pretty color glaze! Check out my photo of my Orange- Pomegranate Loaf, try it:)

Wonderful. I did add the 2 Tbsp of oil, and used pecans instead of walnuts (it's what I had on hand). The flavor was excellent and the bread was very moist. I baked mine in four 1 lb mini-loaf pans (sharing keeps it off my hips, lol), on convection bake at 325° for 35 minutes. Will definitely be making again, probably next week, as Holiday gifts. I think I will sneak some Gran Marnier into the simple syrup/glaze. Between the heating to melt the sugar and the fact that it's poured onto oven hot loaves (which I left in the pan until tasting/packaging as treats) and allowed to cool uncovered, I think all the alcohol will evaporate and it will taste divine. I'll come back and let you know how it turned out.

I made a few changes but it was fabulous! the comments about the glaze were discouraging so I didn't make it. Since I had no oranges, I used 1 tsp of orange zest. I also added some cinnamon to enhance the orange flavor. This is a new favorite of mine and I will definitely be making it often!

A quick and economical loaf that's also delicious! I used butter instead of margarine and reduced the sugar in the cake to 1/2c. The 'glaze' is more of a syrup. I poked holes in the cake and brushed half of the syrup over. Using the full amount would have been too sweet for me. I also used an 8 x 8 pan, so the cake baked in 20 min

This recipe is absolutely wonderful! I made it vegan by: using egg replacer, vegan butter, and vegan white sugar. I also made the glaze with pineapple juice instead of orange and let it reduce a bit (I still used orange in the loaf itself). This recipe makes 11 regular sized muffins. Highly recommended. If you make this into muffins bake until brown (it won't take an hour, keep an eye on it!). Grease it up good before pouring into the pan!

I should have heeded the reviews about the loaf being dried out and taken this out of the oven after 45mins. The orange flavor is defined and I will certainly try it again but take it out earlier.

Very good.  The glaze I would actually call a syrup, but I'm glad I didn't skip that step! I skewered the top of the loaves and the glaze went deep down into the loaves, adding a lot of moisture.  I do think they would be dry without the glaze.  I mention everything in plural, because I doubled the recipe and it turned out great.  Thank you Carol!

I made this tonight for dessert.  This is really good!!!!  My husband loved it.  I included the nuts, and the orange zest really made the taste of orange come out strong.  Very moist, I baked for exactly 1-hour.  Defenately a keeper in our kitchen.

This tasted good enough but it wasn't great.  Kind of dry and I wasn't thrilled with the glaze. I was able to use up some oranges so that's a plus but this wasn't the recipe I was looking for.

I followed several reviewers suggestions and added the following: 1 tsp vanilla and 1/4 cup oil to the batter; 1/8 tsp vanilla to the glaze and boiling the glaze down a bit and the loaf turned out amazing. Not dry at all!!

I liked this recipe.  I used whole wheat flour and butter instead of margarine.  I only baked for 40 min and didn't use the glaze, just sprinkled on some powdered sugar.  It was late and I got tired.  I will try with extra oj next time to maybe moisten it up a bit, but definitely a great late night snack for a sweet lover like me.

MY NEW FAVORITE!! with an orange tree in the back yard, I am always trying new ways to use them. I made a loaf last night, and it was soooo good I made two more loafs! I added  1tsp of vanilla to the batter and an 1/8tsp to the glaze. It was magical! I'll making this weekly with my oranges.

This bread was plenty sweet, even though I used a tad less sugar than called for.  Nice and orange-y.  It was pretty dry though, and the glaze wasn't much of a glaze.  Altogether, it was a solid recipe, but I don't think I will be making this again.

This was ok; it had a good, orange citrusy flavor.  But as others have said, it's on the dry side and crumbly.   I even added in an extra 1/4 cup of OJ, but I think what's wrong with this recipe is there is no oil in it.  I've never made a quick bread that didn't call for some amount of oil.  I doubt I'll make this again, but thought I'd throw this opinion out there - try adding in 1/4-1/3 cup of oil and see if you get better results.

I had really high hopes for this.  The smell while it was baking was intoxicating; pure heaven.  Well, it turned out drier than I had hoped.  I would have thought with the syrup and all it would have been super moist.  I was even light-handed on the blending of wet with dry ingredients.  Still, too dry for my liking.  I will say that the orange flavor was dead-on perfect.  I think I will continue to search for that perfect moist orange loaf.  Thank you for sharing.

We gobbled this up in one day. I will take the suggestion to reduce the glaze and brush it on after you take it out of the pan next time.

Now that my daughter is allergic to wheat, it was disappointing not to be able to make this recipe. But I found replacements that work great. Follow the recipe exactly except the replacements below:

3 eggs instead of 2.
1 cup gluten-free all-purpose flour plus 1/3 cup coconut flour instead of 2 cups all-purpose flour

I also added one scoop vanilla whey protein powder and 1/2 cup of white chocolate chips. Instead of a loaf, I made muffins baked for 20 minutes. (FYI, my oven runs about 25°F below temperature)

This loaf was easy to make and baked well. I substituted butter for margarine and orange peel/zest for zest since I only had a small tangerine. Put in about 2/3 cup sugar or so  (instead of whole cup) in the loaf and it was still good. Used all the glaze but did let it cook/boil down as others suggested. It had trouble soaking in so i would pull back the sides of the bread in the pan to allow it to seep down the sides. My husband was very happy with this. 
note-it may not take the full hour to bake! Keep an eye on it and test it if you aren't sure. My loaf only took 45 min.

I hadn't had orange loaf since I was a child until I came across this. I've made it twice now, and it's easy and delicious, though I agree with some reviewers about the glaze being a bit much. Next time I think I will try to cook it longer to reduce it, as some have suggested. If that doesn't work, I'll just use less.

Delicious! I added about a tablespoon of honey to the glaze to thicken it up a bit. Excellent, it is my hubby's new favorite!

WOW! what a phenominal cake (LOAF) !!  
I doubled the recipe as I am doing some holiday baking and boy-oh-boy will I be proud to give this away!  I made two loaves and a couple mini-bundt cakes.  The glaze did not turn out as thick as I expected so maybe I did not get it hot enough or cook it long enough, so maybe someone could elaborate on that for me.  
WILL definitely make this again, hubby is going to LOVE it!

Pretty tasty!  I baked it for an hour and that was too long -- I'll go for 50 minutes next time.  Also, I liked the glaze soaked into the bread, but I wanted it a bit thicker on the top, so I mixed up a separate glaze: 1/8 c. orange juice concentrate and 1/8 c. orange juice, then stirred in powdered sugar until it was sweet and thick.
Thanks for a great recipe!

I thought that this was more like an orange pound cake than a bread. When I poured the glaze on I thought it was going to be too much, but it was fine. You really could not see the glaze but it added a lot of flavor.I would make it again.

Delicious! First time making this, needed to do something with the   abundance of fresh oranges. Added 1 Tbs oil and only baked for 50 min. Added chocolate chips to one loaf and it turned out tasty, too! Will definitely make this bread again!

I followed the recipe as shown. Tha only thing I did was cook the ingredients for the glaze in a medium boil until the texture looks like honey.  I then spread it over the bread with a spoon. The glaze sets quickly and tastes delicious.

I gave 4 stars because the loaf I brought to work was gone before I had a chance to have a piece.!
The only change I made was to add the Tbsp of oil. Thats it.
I was told by one of my co workers who took me aside and asked if I made it that it was the best loaf he has ever had! Moist and flavourful.  Several other similiar comments as well.
I will make it again but thought I would try to add juice of the orange with top up of OJ for more flavour but apparently not needed, just an afterthought

I added zest from 3 oranges and 1-2 tsp cinnamon to batter.  I baked at 350 for 35-40 mins.  Not an hour.  For the glaze I used 1/2 cup squeezed oj and 1/2 cup of sugar,  and the zest of  2 oranges.  Simmer for 5 minutes.  Cool slightly and pour over loaf.  I poked a few holes in the loaf first to get the glaze into the loaf.  Extremely moist and flavorful.  For those of you that thought this was bland, try this. Yummy.

I made this according to the recipe, except with butter instead of margarine, carton OJ and the zest of a clementine. It was delicious! It seems like the poured-over simple syrup will never soak in, and like you've flooded it, but it all soaks into the bread and makes a delicious coating. We ate it for breakfast, which is probably a treat!

I agree with previous poster that the simple syrup and orange combination is essential.

The loaf was awesome. I did make some changes to the reciepy like I added only 1/2 cup of sugar, and 1/3 cup of oil instead of butter and it was still great.i didn’t add any sugar to the glace let it reduce as we like tangy glances. It was simply wonderful.

I just finished baking it 20 minutes ago and barely waited the 10 minutes for the glaze to be absorbed before taking my first bite of this aromatic and lovely-textured goodie.  IT WAS AWESOME!  The loaf itself had a beautiful light orange taste which was only deepened by the glaze.  I'm not sure where the comments regarding dryness and/or lack of taste come from.  I did it exactly as written, which is how I feel any recipe should be tested and judged on - and would not change a thing.  Thank you SO much for submitting this recipe.  It is now a permanent recipe in my collection which I know will be made often.  My next bakes will be a lemon loaf  and a pineapple loaf following this recipe.  I know I won't be disappointed!

Having read the reviews and tried my first bake, I am giving this a low rating. As I was mixing the batter, I could already tell that it was dense. I added more juice to the batter but that did not help. I am wiling to try again with the following changes:
1) lower the temperature to 325
2) add more liquid
3) add more zest and orange extract
4) change the glaze as a soaking sauce. This will increase the moisture in the batter.

This cake will be a bit dry if you substitute butter for margarine. If you use butter, increase to 2/3 cup.

This was so delicious. I added 1 tbl veg oil per another reviewer and extra zest, baked for only 50mins at 350. This will he a new family fave.

I really dug this, great balance of flavors. I made mine with butter instead of margarine and it came out with a very crumbly texture. Next time I make it, I'll probably add a little bit of coconut oil to add some moisture.

Made this with tangerine juice. So - after reading many reviews that said that the loaf was a little dry and crumbly, I was prepared to add a few tablespoons of olive oil as another reviewer had suggested. I got a little distracted and when it was time to add the juice,  I added one entire cup instead of just half. I decided to not add the olive oil and hope for the best. The loaf came out beautifully, and is quite moist - not crumbly or dry at all. And I did not add the glaze, as I had used all of the tangerine juice. The loaf didn’t need it. Happy mistake.

I made one just as the recipe says and another using grapefruit (which I didn't think would taste good, but I had some to use up).  Surprisingly, the grapefruit one is delicious!  I doubled the sugar in the glaze and poked holes in the loaf while it was hot so the syrup could run into the loaf as well as around it.   Thanks for a great recipe!

This is delicious. I used orange juice from the carton instead of fresh. For the glaze, I made it as it called for but decided I wanted it a little more full bodied and thicker. To accomplish that I boiled the granulated sugar, the orange juice and added 2 very heaping tablespoons of powdered sugar (this was for a double recipe so reduce to 1 tablespoon if making only 1 loaf) and a teaspoon of vanilla (reduce to 1/2 if making only 1 loaf). I cooked it to thicken a bit and then spooned it over the bread.  I will be making this again.

It was wonderful. Everyone loved it. I changed the recipe slightly. We had just juiced several oranges so instead of using orange zest I used the pulp from the oranges and adjusted the amount of liquid.  I will surely make it again.

I love this bread! I doubled it but forgot to double the baking powder. The look and texture were a bit off but it still tasted great. I did use some vanilla in the bread and glaze. I cooked the glaze a bit longer and it worked just fine. I will be making this often. Thanks!

This loaf is really delicious! I used Cara Cara orange juice. I lowered my oven to 340 degrees, and I still didn't need an hour to cook. 45-50mins would have been better. I used 3/4C of sugar, and may use even a little less.  Next time I'm going to try 3/4C of butter, and 3/4C orange juice.  The glaze made this loaf extra special.

Really good, this makes a dense loaf, like a pound cake.  I added some orange extract to the batter to make the flavour more pronounced.  I made the glaze with orange juice and sugar, but boiled in until it was thickened, then brushed it over the top.  It made the top nice and shiny, then I made a glaze with icing sugar , orange juice, and orange extract and drizzled it over top.  Soooo good!

This is really, really good!! I was looking for simple loaf to clear my orange and the outcome is definitely delightful. My boyfriend who is not a citrus lover enjoy the loaf as well. Slight alteration I made is that I use brown sugar instead of white, and cut down the amount to 1/2 cup  (since the glaze will be added later and orange juice is really sweet itself, I don't see the reason to add that much sugar. And it taste really good). I also take one of the reviewer's advice to add 2 teaspoons of vegetable oil in the batter to make sure it is a moist loaf.  Wonder why this great recipe has less popularity than other loaf, such a shame... Will definitely make those again!!

My Dad really  wanted an Orange and Chocolate Cake so I googled Orange Loaf and this one came up. I decided to try it.   I followed the Recipe,  except I replaced the walnuts with Chocolate chips and  replaced the orange glaze with  Chocolate frosting.  Used a square pan instead of a cake loaf pan. Baked for 30 mins at 350  instead of an Hour because i put in it a smaller pan.  Success!!!  cause my dad said he loved it... but I thought it was a little a dry and needed more orange and more chocolate. I should have made the orange glaze and  will  defiantly make this again with the orange glaze.

I recently picked a bunch of oranges from a friends trees, went looking for my orange bread recipe, which happens to be this one that i found on allrecipes awhile back, and I couldn't find it. I panicked! My daughter suggested I find a different recipe. I actually asked her "are you crazy!". Thankfully I remembered that I originally found the recipe here. This many oranges without this recipe, well that would just break my heart.

this was okay but i do agree with the majority of the reviews that there is no "wow" factor in the finished product.. it was missing spice or something.. i cut this in half and subbed canola oil for the margarine.. i used half white and half brown sugar.. i zested the entire half of the orange that i juiced and added some pulp as others did.. i also added a tsp of vanilla extract.. i didn't make the glaze b/c the batter tasted plenty sweet to me.. this made 10 smallish muffins.. i know bf will enjoy these at work tomorrow and i'm sure he won't complain but i was hoping for something more

I had a couple of oranges in my fridge for a week and figured it was time to get rid of them, so I made this. I'm glad I did.
Instead of baking in a loaf pan, I used muffin tins (they took about 16-18 minutes to cook). I also switched margarine for a butter/shortening mix and added an extra ¼ cup of orange juice.
The muffins turned out so good. They're light and fluffy, and have a delicious orange flavor. Personally I'd frost them with an orange buttercream instead of glazing them, but either way they're totally tasty.

I added a 1/4 cup more of the orange juice to the batter.  I wanted a good strong orange flavor.  The glaze is to thin so I reduced it to a syrup consistency and it was fantastic!  So easy to make.   I also made one gluten free for my mom and it was actually my favorite.  Substituted flour for Bobs Red Mill gluten free bean based flour.  Added vanilla and it was wonderful.

I just made this and one word DELICIOUS. Its very refreshing and bursting with orange flavor, just the smell alone Oranges !! I used two oranges for the juice that I had on hand, I found I didn't need a half of cup for the glaze I only had about 1/4 cup added a bit of sugar and that was enough. Before I poured the glaze I made sure to poke holes in the bread so it absorbed better. Oh and another thing is I didn't have eggs so I used applesauce in place, came out perfect soft and really moist. I really recommend baking this great to add to anyone's recipe book. ;)

I like it especially with a cup of milk. just like other reviewers mentioned i added 2 tbsp of veggie oil and cut the sugar for the batter to 1/2 cup, and no one complained about it needing more sugar. For the syrup I added 1tsp of vanilla extract just because i like vanilla flavor, But i dont think it made a huge difference anyway. Its a good recipe. Thanks for sharing

good but a tad dry in my opinion. I think next time I will add 1/2 cup of applesauce t make it less dry. either that or more orange juice. about 1/2 cup on that. the orange taste isn't strong so it could take more orange flavor and moisture. I am also not a big orange fan. but still like it.

So we liked it enough to try it again. I doubled the recipe. but instead of 2 cups of sugar I used 1 1/2.
The reason for the less sugar was I ran out. I used the equivalent of 3/4c of orange juice or a single cake and put 1/2 c applesauce in it. or a 1/4  for a single cake. I didn't make the glaze the night before because I had no powdered sugar. I made the glaze tonight and this turned out superb and addictive as it can be. It increased the orange taste just enough and moist as can be. fixing to get another plate now.

Yes, I know I have to follow the recipe exactly to review it, but I didn't and it came out 5 stars  Here's what I did based on what I had on hand.  First of all, I had some "smartie" type oranges, so I took 2 of them and peeled them and then left one peeled.  I pulverized these in a Bullet blender along with a 1/2 inch of peeled ginger root.  In addition to the flour mixture, I added a full tsp. of ground ginger and a scant 1/4 tsp. of nutmeg.  I also added a container of Greek yogurt to the wet ingredients.  finally, I baked the batter in lined muffin tins and sprinkled the tops with regular sugar (instead of the glaze).  Results?  AMAZING!  A great way to use those little oranges and easier than juicing and zesting.

I thought this was really yummy. I used juice and zest from some fresh satsumas that I had and I also used butter instead of margarine.  Next time I think I won't cook as long because the corners and bottom were almost burnt.

I tried this recipe once and followed the directions and I did add the 2 Tbs of oil that other reviewers mentioned. It was a bit dry. I did bake for 1 hour, next time I start to check it at 45 minutes. No problem with the glaze...loved the flavor it added.

My friend came over for coffee and she really liked this bread. It was extremely moist, but I think if I made it again, I would add cranberries and not as much of the orange rind.  Also, I think I would add a cream cheese frosting to it.  I tend to like thinks sweeter, but overall, this bread was very good.

Just made this to take on vaca.  I found the cake moist and flavorful.  I think it will travel well.  I used my favorite- fresh clementine juice and zest - possibly giving it a stronger orange flavor.  I did add some pecans and can't wait for the others in the house to have as much delight as I found in the first of many bites. If fresh juice isn't doeable, try frozen orange juice - undiluted.  Cut back a little on the sugar and you'll have the flavor without the trouble of juicing.. Thanks Carol for sharing with us..

This is a really easy, very yummy orange cake. However, 1 hr baking time is waaaay too long! I baked mine for 40 minutes and it was a little over done (a rather thick brown crust formed on the sides and bottom.) The orange simple syrup is so good on here, don't skip it! I used fresh squeezed oj, added 2 Tb canola oil as other reviewer suggested, and added 1 tsp vanilla. I'll make this again, baking for about 30 minutes before checking for doneness.

I made this recipe to use up some orange juice I had in the fridge. I did add 2 T. of vegetable oil as suggested, but other than that I followed the recipe.  I thought the glaze made part of the top a little soggy, but it still tasted good.  My biggest disappointment was that the finished loaf was so flat and didn’t have any dome at all.  Since I’m not sure how to “fix” that, I probably won’t make this again.

Some reviewers said this was on the dry side, so I took the advise of one and added vegetable oil to the mix.  I also skipped the glaze and sprinkled cinnamon/sugar on the top before baking.  A very nice change for a quick bread that we enjoyed.  Thank you for sharing, Carol.

This was delicious and moist. I reduced the sugar by a third and increased the amount of O.J. I also used pecans instead of walnuts. The glaze keeps the loaf really moist. Just stick the loaf with a toothpick when it comes out and then the syrup will go right into the bread and around the sides. I have stuck this in the freezer in sections and take it out for an occassional weekend treat. It stays moist and delicious!

I made this to use up some of my many oranges. It was refreshingly different, a good cake with coffee or tea. I did cook the glaze longer than directed to reduce the liquid. **Update, made a light version: Doubled recipe,used one stick of margarine/butter, 1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce, fresh squeezed oranges with some of the pulp and hand shaved the zest with a knife. Baked in a 9x13 glass pan for 45 min. Didn't change the glaze. Came out wonderfully! It was a hit at work.

I added the extra 1/4 cup margarine that was recommended and boiled the glaze a little longer and it was wonderful!!  My family said I could make this as often as I want to.  I made it into two smaller loaves and one loaf was gone before they even cooled completely.  Will make lots and lots!!  Thanks for a wonderful recipe!!

I didn't want to use margarine, so I've added about 1/3 cup extra orange juice and a dash of cinnamon. But I think I overbaked it, it was so dry. And the glaze, I was so worried about the glaze being runny so I cooked it too long and ended up with candied glaze. Which my husband loved it, by the way. Next time, I'll just have to watch my baking time. But overall, it was pretty good :)

My family and I thought this was just okay. The texture is a bit dry, as others have said. The glaze helps, but unfortunately I just don't think I'll be making this again.

The flavour was good. Not too sure why the loaf turned out super dry, but it did. Used honey and orange juice for the glaze. It worked great!

I agree with the other reviews that it was a bit dry.  Probably would have been worse without the glaze.  But still good, great orange flavor.  This recipes worth keeping.  Made in 2 mini loaf pans and baked about 40 min.

The loaf looked good but just didn't taste so great. It was missing something. Maybe the orange zest that I omitted since I didn't have any. The glaze never thickened and it was more like OJ consistency. If I make this again I may just use powdered sugar for the glaze instead of reg sugar.

This loaf really is quick and easy to make.  I double the recipe and baked two loaves at once to save energy.  The glaze really gave the loaves an extra burst of citrus flavor.  My only complaint was they were a little bit crumbly right out of the oven (I was very impatient to try them!) However, after sitting in the fridge over night they were just fine.    They were very moist and a big hit with my family!

this was really good, like a orange pound cake, the sauce made the bread.  Was a good breakfast treat.

Oh so good. I didnt have any trouble with this being dry. Although I like the glaze think I might use an orange frosting next time as this is more like a cake than a quickbread. Thanks.

I have been craving for orange flavour
cake/bread and I get my satisfation from this loaf as the loaf itself is not sweet and the sweetness came from the glaze. Thank you so much Carol for this recipe.

Simply delicious, and even better the next day, though it didn't last longer than that.  Wouldn't change a thing.

This is a very good and EASY pound cake recipe.  I used fresh squeezed orange juice and the cake was perfect.  Next time I will use a smaller loaf pan than called for in the recipe.  Thank you
