Other than having to add more milk, the recipe halves nicely (used 1 egg).I didn't really get any "graham" taste. Don't wait until you see bubbles before turning them like you do with regular pancakes or they will be burnt. I would make these again.

These are very yummy. The kids love them when I leave out the nuts and use cinnamon grahams. Try it both ways it's great.

These pancakes tasted pretty good and were a nice change from regular pancakes.  I doubled the amount of brown sugar, added some cinnamon and a little nutmeg and left out the pecans.  I may make them again in the future.

This one deserves MORE than 5 stars!  I did make a few minor adjustments:  I used veg oil instead of butter, added a full teaspoon of vanilla extract, mashed up 2 over-ripe bananas and added them to the wet mixture.  I also served them with Blackberry Syrup recipe from this site and fresh lemon whipped cream.  HUGE hit.

Delicious as is!  I used this recipe as a baby shower favor (pancake mix in a jar) by layering the ingredients like sand art (except the milk, butter, and egg).  Make sure to add pecans to the top so ingredients don't sift through.  Then I added a recipe/directions card to let the guests know what remaining ingredients needed to be added.

I mysself really don't care for pancakes.I'm not a pancake eater,but i just had a taste for some.So i didn't have graham cracker i used golden graham ceral instead(crushed)i but a dash  of cinnamon and i mixed the nuts pecans and macadameians nuts. Add 1 tsp of vanilla and 1/2 tsp of maple flavor extract. Double the brown sugar add some coconuts into the batter and it was just amazing.I have to make these for my kids.But i really did love these i ate two pancake.I'm saving  the rest of the batter for tomorrow if i can hold out that long.Thanks for submitting a delicious recipe that is far from original panckes.

These were very good.  I used a whole cup of graham crackers, because I was afraid I would be unable to taste it, per the other reviews.  So I had to add a little more milk to make it pancake batter consistancy.  They were Yummy.  The first thing my picky daughter said was "These are good."

Even though the graham flavor is not very strong, these pancakes have great flavor and texture.  My kids couldn't have been happier when we turned these into s'more pancakes with chocolate chips and marshmallows in the middle.  What a fun breakfast for them.  I did not include the pecans in the pancakes, as 2 of my kids do not like nuts.

Not impressed with this recipe at all. Altho we love graham crackers, they lent an odd taste to the cakes. I know I make larger pancakes than most people(about 6-7") but I only got 4 cakes out of this recipe & I had to scrape the bowl to get a decent size 4th. Sorry, I won't be making these again:(

I think these are a very good alternative to Bisquick pancakes. They taste and look heartier. I also didn't taste the graham cracker, but the consistency was great. Thanks!

A nice twist to pancakes. I used buttermilk & walnuts & I found the batter a little thick, but the end result was very tasty :)

Finally - something different to do with pancakes!!!  Great recipe!!!  I used self-rising cake flour (Presto brand) and eliminated the salt and baking powder.  I used whole milk and sprayed my griddle with Pam spray instead of using butter.  This one's a keeper!!!

These don't taste like graham cracker, but they have a nice, different flavor that is a little sweet and a little nutty.  The recipe does need extra graham cracker crumbs to really bring out the flavor, and I had better success cooking them just on medium heat.

Too bad I can't give it more then 5 stars! I left out the nuts but WOW this is tasty anyway! We always have leftover graham crackers from our camping trips and I never know what to do with them. This doesn't even taste like graham crackers! It has a hearty nutty flavor (even without the nuts) and it's so much better then the instant "just add water" stuff you get from the store! They do cook faster then traditional pancakes so I used another persons advice and didn't wait for them to bubble up before flipping them. Fabulous! I'm making these again but for supper!!

A really wonderful alternative to pancakes! These are much denser than the traditional pancakes and have a terrific flavor. I used low-fat cinnamon grahams because it was all I had and 3 Tbsp brown sugar. I'm glad another reviewer mentioned when to turn them too - their density makes it hard to tell when to flip - too soon and they flop out of shape, too late and they're a little too brown - but flavor is great regardless!

Yum yum yum!  I've made these things twice now, and I just LOVE the flavor!  They're not too sweet, and the graham crackers and nuts add so much to make it better than traditional pancakes.  You'd better believe I'll be making these again and again.

These are very tasty.  My 1st grader loves to have one before school in the morning.  I make them ahead of time, freeze them and then thaw one in the morning for breakfast.  I like to serve them with honey butter.

These were....interesting. Not difficult at all to put together and mine turned out light and fluffy. This would appeal to parents who like to have their children help cook because most of these ingredients are on hand. (I made them this morning because I'm trying to clean out my cupboards and I found a box of graham cracker crumbs way back in my pantry. I'm sure that you could use graham crackers that you'd pulsed to crumbs either in your food processor or blender.)

It's just that.....I'm not real sure I like graham cracker flavored pancakes. The kids liked them, though. I find that even an hour later, my stomach feels a little heavy.

These are good.  My boyfriend liked them more than I did, but I really liked them!  I had to use walnuts cause I had run out of pecans the night before.  I also toasted them before adding them in.  I also added cinnamon and ginger, and a touch of nutmeg.  A really nice thing about them is that, unlike most waffles and pancakes, they're not completely filling-- so you can eat more of what you make. :) Always a bonus.

These turned out great!! I added a little cinnamon and nutmeg to the batter and omitted the nuts. Served with apple cider syrup and they were gone in no time.

These were pretty good. They tasted more like a regular pancake so next time I make them I will add more graham cracker crumbs. Mine got a little burnt too, I'd turn the flame down a little bit. Overall I liked them.

My 3 year old and I really enjoyed these. I didn't have pecans on hand so I left them out. They still tasted great. I thought they would be really sweet from the graham crackers but they weren't.

Medium high heat is too high. I had to toss out my first batch because in no time they were completely burnt on the outside and uncooked in the middle. For the rest I turned the heat to just below medium and they turned out great. I didn't add pecans to the batter but used chocolate chips instead. Very yummy pancakes and the graham taste was not overwhelming.

I substituted wheat germ for the graham crackers.  They were really good and my twins loved them this way also.

I really enjoyed these, but I did find that I needed to add more graham cracker crumbs to get the flavor to come through. I kept the rest of the ingredients the same and it made for a nice breakfast and a good way to use up some extra graham cracker crumbs I had from making a pie earlier. Thanks for sharing!

Delicious! You don't really taste the graham crackers but it makes the pancakes really thick and hearty. They seem to cook a little faster than normal pancakes so I turned down the heat so they would cook throughout and not be to raw in the middle. These tasted so good I will be making again very soon. Followed the recipe exactly.

Great recipe! Easy to make and tasty. I crumbled my own graham crackers though, added peanut butter and omitted pecans. They cooked nicely on the griddle. Denser/thinner texture. I could've added more flour to make them fluffier but we liked them like this actually. Would like to add something else for extra flavor tho.

These were delicious pancakes, but I would have liked more graham flavor.  You could definitely smell the graham crackers, but the taste was rather lost.  Still, the kids devoured them!

These were okay.  I'm a fan of graham crackers, but maybe just not in the pancake form.  The taste was definitely like a graham cracker.  I ate them hot of the griddle without syrup.  I also tried them with syrup, and they just didn't meet my expectations.

These turned out really great for me! Not much different from a regular pancake, but you can tell it's not the usual! Very tasty and easy to put together. I looked into this recipe because I just made a cheese cake and had lots of graham crumb left over!
