Easy to make, very tasty. I enjoy the varied textures and flavors. My two cents: add shredded carrots if the broccoli coleslaw mix is stingy with them; increase red wine vinegar 1-2T and decrease oil to 1/3 C if you like a little more zing and a little less fat; try sunflower seeds.

Great salad, Alexandria! I have made it a number of times for ladies luncheons and church functions. To vary the flavor, I sometimes omit the red wine vinegar and use 1 1/2T rice vinegar and 1/2t sesame oil. This give the salad a more Oriental taste. Caution when using the sesame oil, a little goes a very long way. Very potent taste!

I think I will use less oil next time.  It was a little too greasy for my taste.  But the flavor was excellent.

Ooohhh Man, this salad is awesome!!  I could eat this salad alone as a meal.  You'd never realize you were eating something so healthy either!  The flavor and textures are fabulous!  I know I will be making this one over and over!  Thanks for sharing it!

Excellent.  I toasted the sesame seeds and almonds in the oven for a few minutes to give it an added crunchy taste.

I have made this many times and sometimes add cut-up breaded chicken patties to make this as good as the Oriental Chicken Salad served in popular restaurants.  We love it!

I saved a similar salad from another site 10 years ago. I call it 'BROCCOLI SLAW, RAMEN' in my recipe file, and have tweaked it somewhat from the original.  

Differences:  

DRESSING: I use 'Oriental flavored' Ramen, use only about 1/4 cup oil (don't need more), use rice vinegar instead of red wine, and add a few shakes of cayenne pepper as well as the black pepper and salt. I don't bother heating dressing, either.

SALAD:  Break up Ramen noodles into small pieces, and saute in a couple of Tbsp. butter with the almonds (2-3 Tbsp.) and sesame seeds (2 Tbsp.) until slightly change color. Set aside.

Combine broccoli slaw (my packages seem to come in 12 oz. pkgs, instead of 16 oz.) and dressing at least 15-20 minutes ahead of serving, stirring several times.  Just before serving add the sauteed noodles, almonds and sesame seeds to top, don't stir them in completely or they lose their crispness.

I love serving this salad with crab cakes, they add a little cachet to the menu, and I've never found anyone who didn't rave about it!

Excellent recipe and very easy using precut cabbage.  I also like to add a little soy sauce and serve it fairly soon so the noodles don't get soggy.

I've made a similiar salad and was asked to make it again that same week.  Haven't used broccoli in it, but it sounds great, and I'll try it next time. 

Sometimes I'm out of sesame seeds (which are cheaper in the Mexican food section than the spice section), so I've used sesame oil, or tahini and lowered the oil amount accordingly. It worked, although we missed having the seeds LOL I used pecans just because I have a pecan tree, and it was great. 

The recipe I originally tried used more black pepper, so if you're into it, try adding more.  I forgot to add the green onions once, and we noticed immediately, so don't leave that out.

This is so easy, healthy, and tasty. I added a couple drops of Sesame oil and soy to help add asian flavor and toast the almonds along with the sesame seeds. This is a great side, or add chicken for a a main dish! I've done it with rice wine and white wine vinegar and i like the rice wine a little better. i also like to add thinly sliced red pepper and/or pineapple.thanks for a great easy recipe.

Love it! It has LESS FAT than the recipe I usually make and ALL the flavor!  I skipped the step of cooking the dressing and just shake it really well in a glass jar.  To me it turns out the same.  I also crumble my dry noodles and toast them as well. Cabbage or broccoli can be interchanged depending on what I have on hand. My family all wanted me to make more, NOW.

I make this a lot and I always toast the Ramen noodles along with the almonds and sesame seeds.  It  makes them crispier and it doesn't take any longer.  I also add a little soy sauce to the dressing.

This was a very interesting dish. My husband wasn't sure and tentatively took a taste... then a serving ... then a second serving ... then he asked for a deal to take for his lunch. I liked the flavors and the crunchiness. All the flavors were distinct and you could taste them individually but it all blended into this great salad. I forgot the oil but I guess it wasn't needed since I didn't miss it? I had to add a little more sugar as it was a bit too tart and left out the salt, I used 2 pkgs of ramen along with both seasoning packets and my broccoli slaw was only a 10 oz bag. The second time I did this I used cole slaw shredded mix instead of broccoli slaw. I toasted the ramen along with the almonds. This would be great for camping, picnics. Does not keep well though as it loses the crunch factor. Thanks for sharing this, it's a good base and just needs a little tweaking to make it great. I'm keeping this one.

This was very good.  I loved the dressing!  Instead of vegetable oil I used sesame oil and since it’s pretty strong I added much less.  Forgot the green onions at the store and didn’t miss them.  Finally I also toasted the ramen noodles at 400 degrees for 5 minutes or so.  Served with whiskey burgers and sweet potato fries I did on the grill.  Perfect combo.  Just a weird question but…  why is this called Chinese Cabbage Salad II when there isn’t actually any cabbage in it?

Delicious, and so simple! I learned how to make a more complicated version of this recipe in a cooking class, and this version is just as tasty and much much easier. 

Simplify it a bit more by heating the vinegar and sugar in a jar in the microwave. Shake to be sure sugar is dissolved, add remaining ingredients, screw on the lid and shake.

Very good! The package of broccoli slaw was only 12 oz. I adjusted accordingly except for the ramen. I omitted the salt (it was still a bit salty for me), used only 2 oz. of slivered almonds, and replaced the sesame seeds with sunflower seeds. Next time I will reduce the oil as well. 1/4 c. for the 12 oz. slaw mix  or 1/3 cup for 16 oz. However, the title should be Chinese Broccoli Salad as there is very little cabbage in it. Thanks for sharing.

A favorite at our house! I make a huge bowl for our crew. A few changes we make are:
1)Add some soy sauce to the dressing.
2)Buy a cooked chicken from Costco and cut it up to add a bit of protein.
3)Use the already shredded cabbage/coleslaw mix instead of the broccoli mix the recipe calls for.
5)We have added raw sunflower seeds as well~yummy!
5)One last thing~We don't mix the salad and dressing and all together because it gets too soggy too fast. We do an assembly line adding what you want and then each person can stir their portion.

All 6 of my children & my hubby & my in-laws love this recipe!!

This was a big hit!!  I omitted the seeds and nuts (husband has a bad tooth!) and used cider vinegar - but it was terrific anyway.  I thought my family would like it - and was very surprised when they loved it!  Thanks for submitting Alexandria.

Delicious! The store was sold out of broccoli slaw, so I used angel hair shredded cabbage and threw in lots of shredded carrots. Excellent! I also cut out the 1/2 c of oil and just used about 2 t of sesame oil. I followed other's advice and subbed rice vinegar for red wine vinegar and heated Morningstar Farms Veggie Chicken Patties, sliced them and threw them on top of each serving. Fantastic recipe! Thanks for sharing!

my new favorite salad! i personally leave out the seeds and normally use yellow onions or whatever i have on hand.  DO NOT sub for the red wine vinegar -   it makes the dressing! i like to add the noodles after chilling the veggies with the dressing for a while so the noodles are not completely saturated with the dressing.  i also add the almonds when serving in order to keep them crunchy.

Amazing salad - Like all I tweaked a little too.  Used dry roasted peanuts and toasted along with the ramen noodles in a skillet with about 1/2 teaspoon sesame oil and sprayed with cooking spray.  Also added about a teaspoon of rice vinegar, no onion (didn't have) and finally I added 1 tablespoon each soy sauce and sesame oil to the dressing (reduced veg oil) .  Needs prettier name - Oriental Brocoli Salad perhaps.  This is a keeper.

Excellent dish, so easy and inexpensive.  Skipped the slivered almonds, uses 1/4 cup of butter flavored grape seed oil instead of vegetable.  A little sweet for me so next time probably only use 1 tbs. sugar.

This salad is wonderful!  Exactly what I was looking for!  I decrease the oil to 3Tblsp. and use Oriental-flavored ramen noodles instead of chicken.  My 5-year-old LOVES this and so does my husband!

This recipe is amazing, especially for those of us who do not care for a traditional slaw.  The alterations I made for this recipe were using cabbage coleslaw instead of broccoli and 5 tbsp. of apple cider vinegar instead of the 3 tbsp. of red wine vinegar.  I also omitted the onions and did not miss them one bit. It was a hit when my family visited this weekend!

Very tasty. I only found it a tad bit sweeter than I would have liked, just a little strong for me. I used Indian vegetarian maggi masala noodles available at Indian grocery store cause I am vegetarian:).

Great side salad to any Chinese dish. As a suggestion, I would add noodles just before serving to keep them crispy. Not good served as leftovers...too soggy.

Made this exactly as written...it seem to need a little more sugar.  One half cup oil seemed a lttle too much oil, it was kind of greasy.  I have had some really good Chinese cabbage salads, but this just didn't quite do it for me.

I bought raw cabbage for a new recipe for my blog. Later a realized that I need sauerkraut. So what to do with raw cabbage? I found this recipe. It is very easy to make so I have tried it. In the middle of making it I had mixed feelings about it. Then I put together the veggies and the sauce. Tossed it, tried it and  Wohoooo. Amazing. Thanx for sharing it!

Love it!  Didn't use almonds or sesame seeds because I didn't have any, still tasted great.  Also, if you don't have a lot of mouths to feed, you can reserve the noodles in a plastic bag and add a little more everytime you eat the salad so  they wont get soggy.

My daughter loved the dressing and the fragrance from the toasting sesame seads.  I assembled the slaw and then topped it with the crunchy bits (noodles, sesame seeds, almonds) so that they stay crisp longer.  Very good.

This was tasty but I did change and add a few things. In addition to the brocoli slaw, I added half of a large red cabbage chopped up. I also added 2 shredded carrots. I subsitutes the green onions for red onion and I also used sunflower seeds instead of almonds and the other nut mentioned. I also crumbled only half of the uncooked ramen noodles. As for the dressing, I used 5TBs of red wine vinegar, 2.5TBs of sugar. In addition to the listed ingredients, I also added a little minced garlic, lemon juice, and some powdered mustard. My family loved it! I always change recipes - my household likes a more tangy salad. I did used the reccomended amount of oil (but olive) because of the added cabbage but in the future I would probably use less still. Thank you - very yummy!

We always toast the almonds and sesame seeds, use a packet of the CHICKEN seasoning from the ramen, and we add shredded chicken (which can be the canned stuff). It's highly addictive.

I've been searching for the right dressing recipe for this salad.  It varies but this one is delicious.  Not overpowering.  Just good.

I resisted the urge to replace the red wine vinegar with a more mild rice vinegar in this recipe because I thought the red wine would be too harsh but I'm glad I didn't.  This was great and the tangy flavor perfect.  I do prefer other cabbage salads similar to this but will make this again because it's unique and tasty.

I got this recipe from a friend a few years ago.  Very tasty!  A good switch from your regular lettuce salad.

i didn't have cashews so I used peanuts, I used rice vinegar instead of apple vinegar and I substituted bean sprouts for red cabbage since the grocery didn't have red cabbage.

The salad was delicious!Instead of buying package broccoli coleslaw mix,I just shredded cabbage with carrots and didn't add broccoli at all.Also, used white vinegar instead and a lot less oil.

I have made this many, many times probably in the past 2 years and we just love it! Usually I serve this with pork tenderloin or chicken. 
I have used broccoli slaw mix as well as cole slaw mix, either way it comes out great! I use the oriental ramen mix and also have added 2 TBspoons of soy sauce, cut down to 1/3 cup of olive oil. It tastes better if it gets to marinate for a day, so I usually make this ahead.
