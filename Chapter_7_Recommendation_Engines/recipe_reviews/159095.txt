This is a wonderful salad. I made a 1/2 recipe for the first try and restrained myself from adding anything to it (dill weed, celery, peas...). All of the flavors, textures, and colors worked beautifully together. You may be tempted to add to it - but, for the first batch, don't. There are many ingredients that would lend themselves nicely, but this is a 5-star salad on its own. Thanks, Laurie!

I personally would not cook the potatoes and carrots together, because they may cook at a different rate.  I would also cook them whole (potatoes with skins on), then peel/cube/dice when they are cold, but that's just how I like to do it.   To prepare the beets:  cook a whole, unpeeled large beet (or a couple small) in water until it is tender when pierced with a fork.  Drain, rinse in cold water, and peel it when cold.

I was looking all over the web for this recipe since I grew up in Venezuela... I finally found it here! The funny thing is, I have an account here and didn't come up when I looked up beets and hard-boiled eggs. :( Oh well, I's so happy you have it! It tastes just like what I grew up with, I only omitted the pickles and pickle juice and added a little vinegar instead. I had never heard of pickles until I came here so I am SURE my mom didn't used to put them in there. Thanks so much!!! (PS I still remember my kindergarten class making me bring 2 hard-boiled eggs so we could make this together

I like beets, so the recipe caught my eye.  I also like to keep as much raw as possible.  I did a dice on raw carrots and onion.  No sauteing.  I shredded the beet and added raw.  I added the warm cooked potato, carrots and onion to the dressing and refrigerated. I followed the recipe from there. I gently folded the raw shredded beets in last.  This was a beautiful and very tasty salad.

I love beets so I wanted to try this.  It was good but no one seemed thrilled.  I thought it needed a little more flavor, onion or something added to the dressing.

This "Ensalada Roja con Pollo (Red Salad with Chicken)" was both attractive and delicious. I will definitely be making this again many, many more times. Thank you Laurie Gonzales for sharing your recipe.
