As per other reviewers, I sauteed the rice and garlic in a little butter.  I also substituted chicken broth for the water and only added 3/4 of the jar of salsa.  Turned out perfect!  The whole family loved it!!!  I did simmer covered, wasn't sure since it didn't say.   I love simple recipes with so few ingredients that taste so flavorful!  Will definitely make this again!!!!!!!

I was skeptical because it was so simple but it turned out great!  I added some black beans and served with chicken enchiladas and my guests said it was the best meal that they have had in a long time.  I will definaltely be making this again and again.  Quick, Easy and Delicious.  Thanks!

Good idea for a quick side dish but I agree with the last reviewer who said this had way to much salsa for 1 cup of rice.  I suggest using 1/2 or 3/4 jar of salsa at most for each cup of uncooked rice.  I may try again this way.

Each time I've made this recipe (several times), I bless the cook that sent it in!  It so easy, delicious, and always moist.  My family loves it!  I serve it with tacos or Mexican chicken.  A great recipe!

Super easy & good! browned the rice like the others suggestion - made with La Victoria's thick & chunky medium salsa.  Very tasty.  I didn't cover it 'cause it didn't specify.  Turned out great.

Very bummed...I can never seem to get the right spanish rice recipe. This one seemed so easy and had great reviews, but I wasn't impressed. Way too much salsa; I used homemade which had the same consistency as the Pace brand, but it was too much. Maybe if I had used half or three quarters it would have been better.

This was so simple and so good.  I used Uncle Ben's rice in the microwave - no need for water and then added the salsa.  I also added some sauteed chopped green pepper and onion along with some chili powder and cumin to give it a little something more.

This recipe was tasty and very simple.  I used a garlic lime salsa and it had great flavor.  I would make sure you use a salsa that has good flavor or your rice will be bland.

I am the one that submitted the original recipe. I have to tell you that over time I have found an even easier way to do it with the same results. I have added the rice and salsa and the equivilant amount or so of water or broth from the salsa jar (not 2 cups); added it to a rice cooker and hit the "white rice" button. Wha-la! It is the same and so much less fuss!

I sauteed the rice and garlic before adding the water and salsa for more flavor. My husband really liked it but I still thought it needed something, possibly lime.

Made this as a side to go along with the Chili Verde from AR. I would have been fantastic had I gone to the store and bought some mild or medium salsa but noooooo I had to use that  HOT salsa that someone left from a past party! Geez.... burnt the hell out of my tongue!! But the rest of the guest loved the flavor AND heat!!! I know... I'm a wimp! I'll be making this again as it is so quick easy and very nice flavor. Oh, by the way.... only change I made was to add a 1/4 t of cumin. ***UPDATE*** Made this again tonight (July 2012) This time I added a drained can of Bushes Black Beans and about 3/4 of a 13oz Hillshire beef sausage link cut into 1/4" rounds at the start. Brought to a boil and simmered for 20 minutes with the lid off. At the end of the 20 minutes I covered and let set 10 minutes or so. Tasted great! The left overs I folded into burrito wrappers with a slice of American cheese for quick lunches or snacks.... YUM!!

I browned the rice and used chicken broth rather than water.  This was perfectly acceptable, but for my tastes a little heavy on the salsa.

Great recipe, thank you! It smell absolutely delicious when it was simmering. However, I agree with others that halving the amount of salsa is a good idea. I also found my rice a bit dry, so mixing some butter in it before fluffing might be helpful. I also used brown rice to make the recipe a lot healthier!

Linnie, (whoever you are) this recipe is Great! Love it! I tried many other versions of Spanish Rice, but I love this one. It's a keeper in my house! Like some of the other members I added cumin, chili seasoning a little salt, but I didn't have garlic, so I used onions, instead of water i used a can of chicken broth and I didn't need as much salsa. Thank you!

Simple, easy and definitely delicious!  Cut this in half for just the 2 of us and then did saute my garlic and rice for a couple of minutes before adding my water and salsa!  I think the salsa is key - it can make or break your rice depenidng on the flavour.  I use a dried mix that you add your own fresh tomatoes and lime juice to and it's FANTASTIC!

This recipe was really easy to make, but I think I cooked it for more like 30 minutes to get the consistency I wanted.  Even though I used mild salsa, it was still a little to spicy for us, so I might experiment with a different brand or half tomato sauce/ half salsa next time. We'll definitely make this again!

I've made this twice now, once as instructed, and once via microwave.  Following the instructions exactly was great, but just be aware that this is not a dry spanish rice.  It's going to be a wet rice mixture when you're done (which is how I like it). If you don't want it so wet, use less salsa.   Regarding the microwave, my typical white rice recipe is to microwave for fifteen minutes covered, and let the rice sit in the microwave (don't open the door) for ten minutes after the timer goes off.   Using this timing with the spanish rice recipe left me with rice that was about 95% done.  I might have to play with the microwave times a little bit to get it perfect.

Very good and easy, I put this in my steak tacos.  Not too sure if Id like it as a stand alone dish though.  I did sautee the rice in butter first and also added some beef boullion to the water when I cooked it.  I took the suggestion of others and cut down the salsa to just 1 cup but it still seemed a little runny, if I had not been in a rush I would of tried cooking it down longer, but it was good anyway.  I will make this again when I make steak or chicken tacos (with my changes of course).

AWESOME!! For only 3 ingredients this is really good.  I'm sure it's not authentic but it is fast to prepare.  I did brown the rice and fresh garlic before adding liquid.  I will be making this again!!

This is WONDERFUL!  I never make Spanish Rice because of all the cutting up and work involved, but this was super easy!  I used a mild salsa and my 15 month even loved it!  This is a GREAT recipe!  Definately a keeper!

Easy and great spanish rice! I too, browned the rice in a little oil prior to cooking, it's worth the little extra work. Great with Pace's Chunky Salsa.

I also sauteed the rice and garlic in about a TBSP of butter and only used 1/2 to 3/4 of a jar of medium salsa.  Should have added some salt while cooking as it noticeably needed it when eating.  Very tasty.  My wife thought I spent a lot of time chopping onion, tomatoes, and bell pepper.

Not all that exciting, but still good.  My husband thought it needed some lime or cilantro to liven it up a bit.  I cooked the rice in chicken broth and sauted the rice and garlic in a little butter.

I thought this recipe was just okay.  Maybe using less salsa would be better.  I had very high hopes after reading all of the rave reviews.  It was very quick an easy though.

I added much more garlic than was suggested, about 3 cloves, needs spicy salsa otherwise is a bit bland,  crème fraîche and shredded cheese top it off nicely.

Super simple and very tasty! This was a big hit with my family. I browned the rice and garlic and used Pace Picante sauce. The consistency was perfect and the flavor was great.

This was easy, but was just ok.  I don't know if it was because of the salsa I had used (mild black bean and corn salsa).  I guess I'll try this again using a different salsa.

I followed the recipe to a T (besides browning rice & garlic like others suggested). I think the concept is excellent, but I'd try again with a diff. type of salsa. The end flavor wasn't as great as it could be with the right salsa. Mine did not come out too watery either.

We eat a LOT of mexican and this is one of the best recipes for spanish rice I've found!!  (Of course, it all depends on the salsa you use.  Your favorite is not always the best for this recipe; I use a salsa that's a little thinner than the "garden style" black bean and rice salsa that we eat with everything else.)  This is a GREAT recipe!

Used 3 cloves fresh pressed garlic and Uncle Ben's 30-min brown rice (which actually takes about 40 min b/c more liquid with the salsa). Served in black bean burritos with cheese and sour cream! Yum!

Everything's in the Salsa!

I used chicken broth instead of water and 1 cup of spagetti sauce (all we had in the house), instead of salsa. Very tasty and fast to make. Will make again.

The rice was good, not spectacular, but it's highly dependent on the salsa you use. I'd say the recipe calls for way too much, and I'm convinced I can taste the preservatives in your mainstream type salsa. I will more then likely either make my own, or find a local vendor who makes their own if I do this recipe again.

I was cooking chicken one night & realized I had nothing to go with it. All I had at my house was rice & I found some tomato pico de gallo in the fridge. So I put the pico in my little chopper/blender to make it closer to salsa consistency. I added garlic, garlic salt, & dropped in a crushed up chicken boullion cube. I put everything together in my rice cooker and turned it on. 20 minutes later, voila! It was very good & easy.

OHH! Perfect perfect perfect! Just what I was looking for in a rice recipe. I don't like box mixes and I didn't have time on a Sunday to cook my usual all day way, so this was a lifesaver! And, it tasted great!! I will use this again and again.

I ended up doing a hybrid of this recipe plus my mother's. In a bit of oil I added in 1C rice and garlic and sauteed. Then I added in 1C of salsa and let that heat up + some cumin powder. Then I added in 2C of water and let the rice cook and fluffed. Perfect.

Very easy and very good. I made this with cheesy chicken enchiladas and pollo fajitas (the fajitas I got on this website). My friends loved it.

Its such a great idea to just use salsa for flavor instead of putting a lot of effort into using 10 different ingreadients to get the same result. Thanks so much!

Wonderful recipe.  After years of trying to make the perfect spanish rice, this recipe nailed it.  It has the perfect blend of spices, making it taste the way it is supposed to taste.

The first time I cooked the recipe, as written, and it was delicious and easy. I used Tostitos mild salsa. The second time I made the recipe it was bitter, however, I used a different salsa so be careful which salsa you use. I just made this recipe tonight, but this time  I cooked up some ground beef and added it to the cooked rice. It was wonderful as a main dish. Thanks Linnie for sharing.

I gave it 4 stars as written, but read many reviews and made changes:crisp bacon, fresh tomatoes, chicken stock, 1/2 cup mild salsa and 1 cup tomato sauce, onion, black olives.  We have to limit spicy foods, but this had so much flavor with changes.  Oh, and I browned the rice in a little butter, with onion and garlic.  Probably shouldn't review, having made so many changes, but reviewers' hints made all the difference for us. Thanks to all reviewers.

I guess I'm in the minority, but I used 3/4 c salsa and would have loved more! I found it a bit dry, but very quick and tasty. I will make this again with more salsa and maybe a bit of chili powder or cumin.

Simple but very flavorful! I make this often for my family including parents in their 80s and all agree that it is very good.  When I searched for a Spanish rice recipe, I had to try this because my grandmother's name was Linnie! Note to self: follow cooking instructions on box and add salsa to taste.

It was great, I had requests for more the very next night.  I did add  chicken broth, cut up red & green pepper, and also added some water and a little more of Knorr bouillon chicken flavour. I also used less salsa, as per some of the reviews stated. I will be making this again

I followed the recipe and use chicken broth & the "Texas Brand"
salsa, 3/4 of the jar of the salsa.  It turned out with a vinegary taste!  There are much better  Spanish Rice Recipes out there!

The rice ended up being mushy, it may have been too much liquid for only 1 cup of rice. No one in the family would eat it. Was just blah, plain rice would have been better.

It was OK but too much salsa. I use another recipe from this site which is delicious
2 TBSP oil
2 TBSP chopped onion
sauté lightly then add 1 1/2 cups rice, cook about 5 mins
Add 2 cups chicken stock and 1 cup salsa. Stir well and cook until rice is done.  I add 1 pound of pre-cooked turkey sausage Oscar Meyer or similar) and mix well. With a salad and garlic bread I have a quick meal.

I had rice, smoked sausage and brain fog. Did a recipe search and somehow ended up on this recipe! So I sauteed some onions,  sliced & browned the smoked sausage, stirred it into the prepared rice and it was dinner's  on the table! It was great, Thanks!

I love this Spanish rice! It is so easy. I use instant rice so it is MUCH quicker  to cook than the estimated time on the recipe. You just have to watch that the rice doesn't start to burn on the bottom.

Very good and easy recipe. I think it depends on what kind of salsa you use as to how the rice will turn out. I liked it but would probably tweak it a little next time.

This was a simple and quick dinner addition to my pork and green chili.  I added chopped red onion and toasted cumin seed to give it a little kick and a bit of chili powder.  Will definitely make again.

This was just okay...overall pretty bland.  It's a good base recipe though and I plan on tweaking it to get more flavor.  I did saute the rice and garlic in a little olive oil first, just until the rice was very white (not brown).

Living as an Expat in rural China we have lots of rice to eat.  My mom sent a care package to us and included a giant jar of salsa.  This recipe was the perfect find to "spice up" the usual rice dish.  After the ingredients cooked in the traditional rice cooker, I stirred in 2T butter to loosen up the sticky rice.  Thanks Linda for a great recipe!!

This rice was really good.  It came out a bit sticky with two cups of water. Some of the rice was also a little underdone.  Next time I will add a little more water and cook a few minutes longer.  Great taste!

Great side dish recipe for basic Spanish Rice!  I used brown rice, (required more liquid to cook), and chicken broth for the water.  I would recommend using half a jar of salsa rather than the whole jar.

First time I made Spanish Rice.  I always love the Spanish rice you get at the Mexican restaurants and the stuff you buy in the store doesn't even come close.  This is a very good recipe that tastes nearly identical to the Spanish rice you get in the restaurant.  It is also very easy.  Thanks for sharing!

This was so easy. I used chicken broth instead of water and only used 1/2 jar of salsa. It was a big hit with my family.

I'm looking forward to trying different salsas in this recipe. I will use 8 to 16 ounces of salsa depending on the variety I buy. This time we used the full amount of Texas-Texas brand salsa but, because it is so flavorful, we could have used half as much.

Very good - too spicy for my family, so I will try less salsa next time.  This time we just put sour cream on and it was great.  VERY easy to make!

I added 1 lb of skinless smoked sausage, 1 T of oil, used garlic salt instead of the minced garlic and just cooked all the ingredients together in the microwave for about 15 minutes stirring every 5 minutes. This was very good. My 2 year old enjoyed it also.

This is the YUMMIEST rice!  I was wasting all this time with other more involved recipes.  THIS is the ticket!  The only thing I did differently was to saute the rice in a bit of oil until browned, and then follow the rest of the directions.  PERFECT!  My family loved it!
