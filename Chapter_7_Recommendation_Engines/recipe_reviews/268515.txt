This turned out great! I followed the recipe but added a cup of dry ditalini pasta. If I were to make it again, Iâ€™d add a can of diced tomatoes as well. Otherwise it was pretty tasty and easy to make.

This soup was great.  I did add 2 more cups of water, but other than that followed recipe exactly.  Sent leftovers to my Mom and now she wants me to make a batch for her.  Yummy.
