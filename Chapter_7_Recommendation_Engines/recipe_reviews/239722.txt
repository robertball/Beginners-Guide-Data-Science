I actually mixed this recipe with the farro with wild mushrooms recipe on this site. I mainly followed that one due to the mushrooms and this recipe adding the greens, I used spinach, and feta at the end. I really love mushrooms and I love spinach, so I figured why not make this more hearty and use it as the main dish. I put a vegetable beside it. Easy recipe even with combining two!

Good, quick, healthy. I added a can of drained canneloni beans and used as a main dish. A little bland. The next time I make it will add sauteed onions and try some herbs.

I loved the recipe but because it is only for me I made some changes to increase the protein and use ingredients I already had in the house.  When cooking the farro, I used water instead of chicken broth and added salt, pepper, onion powder, garlic powder and a little sherry.  Instead of kale, which I am not a huge fan of unless it is in chip form, I used 10 ounces of frozen spinach which I heated up before incorporating it into the salad. I sauteed fresh sliced garlic in the oil and then added it to the farro salad.  I also added one can of drained cannellini beans.  Lastly, I had crumbled feta cheese with cranberries in the house so I used that instead. I can't wait to share this recipe with my parents and co-workers.  It is delicious!

Nutritious and delicious!
Made this as instructed, except that I didn't have any kale, spinach, or similar greens to use, so I chopped up some steamed asparagus that I had and added that into the mix- yum! Has a very tasty, savory zest, with the lemon really pulling together and enhancing the flavors of the garlic and pepper. During seconds, decided to try for a slightly different flavor and added some raisins, which worked really well, giving a very subtle sweetness to the dish. Overall, a very delicious, nutritious- and filling!- recipe that could definitely stand on its own as a meal. Great recipe! Thank you, Cris (^v^)

I used mixed greens (baby chard, spinach and kale) in place of the kale and it was delicious. My family loved it ! I will definitely be making this again!

Love this recipe!!  I used 3 tbsp olive oil, 3 cloves garlic, & 2 tsp lemon juice b/c I added a lot more kale--I just keep adding kale as it wilts, until it looks sufficiently green!  I usually need to add an extra spritz of olive oil toward the end of mixing in the kale so it doesn't dry out & stick to the pan.  I'm also not a fan of feta, so I substituted 3-cheese blend (shredded Asiago, Parmesan & Romano)--it was yummy!!

My husband and I really liked this recipe. However, our kids saw that there was kale in it and immediately judged it. I did decrease the amount of kale in it by about half. If you like this kind of dish you will like this recipe.

Yes, a thousand times yes! This recipe is a keeper. Swapped out spinach for kale but otherwise kept it the same. Loved the saltiness of it, and the variety of textures. Ate it as a late, small dinner, but generally see it as a side dish.

I Love this!  I double the recipe, use spinach and sometimes cook the garlic and oil in the microwave for 1 minute just to mellow the garlic and turn it sweeter. Either way it is fabulous. We eat it both cold or warm and often eat it for lunch. Thank you!

Delish!  Didn’t have kale on hand so I substituted spinach. Followed everything else exactly. Used 1/2 tsp of kosher salt and 1/4 tsp of black pepper. Will definitely be making again.

This was a quick and easy recipe that is easily changed up to make it for different purposes. I made it vegan. If you're going to make it this way, cook the farro separately beforehand or it won't get soft enough.
I changed the chicken to tofu, added mushrooms, 1/2 cup of wine, 1 teaspoon of cumin,  a tablespoon of sesame oil and a small onion to the farro mix. I also used vegetable stock instead of chicken. I doubled the garlic because I love garlic and used vegan "feta" instead of real feta. Loved it!

This salad was very easy to make and its is delicious. Next time I will use a little less broth as the farro was tender way before all the chicken broth was absorbed.

Made this as is in the recipe and it's wonderful, easy and quick.  If you get the low sodium chicken broth you won't have as much of an issue with the salt. Still it's delicious and love this recipe.

The second time I made it I used some mixed power greens i had in the fridge and sauteed some mushrooms first. Added the sauteed mushrooms and greens at the same time along with the sauce and also grated some lemon rind on the top before serving. I roasted a pork tenderloin which i cut into rounds and served with it. 

Delicious! Thanks for this awesome recipe using Farro, an under utilized grain and now one that is definitely in my regular routine!

Amazing! I used water instead of broth since I have to keep my sodium down, and I only had goat cheese, no feta, but it turned out amazing. My three kids devoured what I thought would be enough for me to take for lunch the next day.

Did exactly as recipe said and it only made enough for 2 lunches but tastes great! I would double recipe if you are looking for 4 lunches/dinners of a decent serving size. Super quick and easy.

Loved this.  I had some farro that I had been wanting to use and I had some collards which I substituted for the kale.   
I'm certain I would still give it 5 stars if I hadn't made any changes and had this as a side dish.   My husband and I are trying to eat more vegetarian so this recipe seemed like one we could turn into a meal.   The other changes I made were using veggie broth instead of the chicken,  omitting the salt and instead using more  garlic and adding dashes of garam masala, coriander and basil, used regular goat cheese instead of feta and some grated parmesan cheese, and added a can of white northern beans.  I love that the recipe is so versatile.  Thank you Cris!

Used arugula and Asiago because that’s what I had.  Tasty.  Can’t wait to try it with feta.

Pretty good stuff!
I switched out the feta(eck) for fresh grated parmesan instead. 

Next time I may try and use spinach vs kale for more flavor.

Delicious and super easy to make!  I used spinach the first time I made it and Arugula the second time.  Both were excellent.  Will definitely make again (and again!).

Turned out pretty good!  We used spinach (we’re overseas and I couldn’t find kale) and it really reheats well and/of is good cold.

As is, this is an incredibly adequate recipe that REQUIRES no changes. With that being said, it becomes a main dish easily with the addition of some savory vegetables. Adding diced cucumber and onion adds flavor and substance without increased calorie or fat loads. You can also replace the chicken broth with vegetable stock and omit the salt in the process.

But the one thing I could not change is the core : kale and farro.

I made this as directed and it was pretty good - I liked the nutty chewiness of the farro. It was the first time I've had farro.  I will make it again but think it needs a little more seasoning.

Delicious! I used Greek feta and fresh chopped herbs (oregano, parsley) in place of kale and it was great.

Absolutely love this recipe. Great whole grain vegetarian side dish or even main dish. I added double garlic and would add extra kale next time to balance out the Farro/kale ratio. At least a cup more kale since it cooks down quite a bit. Highly recommend this super tasty, healthy dish.

This is a great base recipe. I added about 1 tsp. of rosemary to the olive oil mixture, along with an extra tsp. of lemon juice and olive oil. I sautéed half a diced onion and diced portabello stems until soft, adding them before combining the olive oil mixture with the farro. It was delicious. Thanks for giving me a great recipe for my first time cooking farro!

This is one of my favorite go-to recipes now.  It's so easy. I make a healthy veggie version by using low-sodium vegetable broth. It's also great with thawed, frozen corn and/or peas. Sliced almonds give it a nice crunch.

I loved this as is and with black beans. I took off a star because the farro took way longer to cook and more broth. I think it was because I was cooking the farro in a large pan as instructed. I finally cooked the farro in a small saucepan and then continued on as the recipe said. Next time, and there will be a next time, I will cook the farro as I always do and then finish as directed.

This was my first time having farro and I was pleasantly surprised at how good it taste.  A nice quick, easy recipe. I used spinach instead of the kale. Next time I am going to add some chopped up onion, garlic and fresh parsley or basil.. The feta added a nice finish to the dish. My husband ate it with out the feta and loved it!

This recipe is delicious! I made for my meal prep for work. I also didn't measure the kale and used probably more than two cups. The problem with it is that the serving size is completely off. I got two days worth rather than 6 servings. I'll double the ingredients next time.

Suuuuper yummy. Tweaked it a bit by adding a handful of craisins and subbed chèvre for the feta. Made it absolutely delectable. Try not to eat the whole pot!

Made this dish exactly as written and at the last minute I added sweet apple chicken sausage pieces I had quickly browned in the pan. Family loved it! Our first farro dish but not the last!

Loved the faro. I made it as presented. I think it needs more kale/spinach and herbs or something for more flavor.Went over well at a picnic. I would make it again.

Very good, but I needed to add quite a bit more chicken broth before my farro was tender - probably an additional cup, and it took closer to 40 minutes to cook to 'al dente'. The flavors are very nice. I served this with a lemon slice, as I wanted to squeeze more fresh lemon juice over before eating.
