This was very very easy to make and so tasty. I would suggest to add the garlic powder and salt to taste. I use Dukes Mayo which I love but any recipe I add it to I usually add less salt than called for. The pecans help to fancy it up a bit. I just love it and will make it again next week for a church get-together.
