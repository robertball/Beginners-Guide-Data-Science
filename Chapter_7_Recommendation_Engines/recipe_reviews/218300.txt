I used my own dry ranch dressing mix and I left out the seasoning salt, as I didn't want my crackers to be too salty. These turned out really good. I think they could use a little more spice but that's really a personal preferance. I made this with my oldest boy yesterday after dinner and so far, over half is gone! I think we'll be making this again real soon.

Yummy! The only thing I would do differently next time would be to cut down on the lemon pepper. It definitely adds to the overall flavor, but it was a little too prominent for my tastes. Thanks! :)

I submitted this recipe.  I wanted to note that due to additive allergies, I cannot use store-bought ranch dressing mix.  So I use a mix recipe from here on AllRecipes.  If you don't have store-bought, just make your own and then add the other ingredients.  Then you don't get all of the additives.

I made two batches of these. The first was as written and was excellent, the second batch I add a half teaspoon of cayenne pepper.  Those who like to kick it up a bit it added a little zip.

Just okay for me. I accidentally bought twice as many crackers as needed for our chili at Christmas, so needed to use some crackers. I appreciate the recipe, but did hit a couple of bumps. Followed the recipe except that I omitted the lemon pepper and seasoned salt. My picture shows a 12 x 17 and 10 x 15 pan with not quite two boxes of crackers...so...no way two boxes of crackers can be spread in a single layer onto a jelly roll pan, which I think is 10 x 15?  Also, I baked these for forty minutes. They were more browned than they look in my picture...not the greatest photographer...but not that brown.

Great recipe! Admittedly, I switched it up and used Spicy Ranch seasoning, and because of that, I omitted all the pepper seasonings, dill and onion powder, kept everything else the same except for adding a bit of nutritional yeast to the final toss when it came out of the oven.

I liked this but I cut down the oil by a 1\4cup and didn't add the season salt at all the second time I made them because the first time they were just too oily and salty.

this is a very popular snack to have with friends. A little messy, but worth it. Make it all the time. Keeps at least 2 months if you can keep it that long.

Very tasty snack.  Quick and Easy to make.   My kids love them.  They are great by themselves or as a salad topping.   I love bold flavor so I heaped all my seasoning measurements.  The bags of oyster crackers at our grocery were 12 oz. bags so that made the seasoning go a little further as well.  I also went the full 20 minutes to have a nice crispiness but were not too done.

These were really tasty but I probably won't serve them with soup again. A double batch is enough for the FOL group.

Awesome!  LOVED these!  I didn't use the lemon pepper - but otherwise ... everything was the same.  Gave them out as gifts to neighbors. NUMMY!
