This recipe is a little "out of the box" as far as the typical stuffing recipe, but I was more than pleased how well all of the flavors work together. I did use green olives instead of black as that's what I prefer.

Okay, I was as skeptical as you are when I read that there were olives in this stuffing, but it was fantastic. If stuffing and supreme pizza got married and had a kid, that's what this recipe would be. I got rave reviews at the party I went to with it.

My husband says that the peppers and olives give it almost a supreme pizza taste.  In our opinion it makes WAY more than 14 servings.  Also we didn't have fresh herbs so I used dry herbs and halved the amounts called for.  It went great with our Easter lunch.  YUM!!

This is my new sausage for any stuffing I make! I omitted the black olives and doubled the sage and it was delicious! Made some stuffed in a turkey and the rest in a casserole dish. Both turned out moist and tasty!

This recipe is very similar to my mother’s which was given to her by an Italian neighbor in the early 1950’s!  We use both black and green olives and also use chopped carrot, green apple and unsalted butter to offset the saltiness of the olives.  We have received many compliments for this stuffing as it is unique in flavor with some Italian ingredients.

It was very tasty and substantial. I had some trouble trying to reduce the recipe for 2-3 people. Smaller portions would be helpful.
