Will absolutely make again!   My husband and I made this together and we started the risotto before the shrimp and scallops.  We added about 2/3rds of a cup of shredded gruyere and pecorino Romano cheese to the risotto before we added the seafood.  YUM!

Delicious! The only change I made was adding a little Old Bay seasoning to the seafood spices.

We'll be making this again and again.

Super easy and delicious!  I didn’t have crushed red pepper so used a couple shakes of cayenne and it was sensational!

My husband and I both enjoyed this easy dish. I omitted the red pepper flakes and shallots as I didn’t have any on hand. I also substituted chicken stock for the fish stock. All in all, a filling and flavorful dish with minimal cleanup. Next time, I may add some other seafood.
