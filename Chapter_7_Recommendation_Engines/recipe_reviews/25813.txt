I had a craving for homemade, big soft cookies but had no eggs at hand - this recipe fit the bill! They came out nice and soft, but with a slightly crisp bottom. Really liked them and was super easy to make. And just because I felt like having some spicy flavor, I also added some ground ginger(just a personal preference).

I can't beleive how quick and easy these were!  I did have to bake for about 12-13 min, but I think that is because I made the cookies a little on the large side, as I ended up with 22 instead of the 30 the recipe said.  I did end up using about 3/4 c. choc. chips since my boyfriend is a choc-o-holic.  These are super tasty.  A nice moist chewey cookie!!  I will definately make again!

I love these.  I am always able to make my own little changes (whole wheat flour, milk or water in place of the buttermilk, etc.) to fit what I have on hand.  This is a great recipe!

quick, easy cookie. i chose this one because it used different ingredients than the usual chocolate chip or oatmeal cookies i bake, and i was glad to mix it up. The cookies are pretty light and taste good. On the first pan I forgot to flatten them, and they stayed in ball shape.

My new favorite cookie recipe!  I used natural peanut butter and substituted soymilk with 1/4 tbsp lemon juice for the buttermilk to make them vegan.  They turned out soft and very good.

Very good cookies when I had no eggs and only partial stick of butter in the house.  We just tasted them still warm and they are very good.  They won't replace my favorite chocolate chip cookie recipe, but I would make these again for sure :)

I'm also thinking this cookie recipe would be a great base for cookie dough truffles since there are no eggs. Paula Deen has a recipe for them, but hers are SO sweet.  This dough might be great rolled into balls and coated in chocolate.

These are really easy and really good cookies. the oats gave them a nice texture that you don't normally get in a cookie. I added a little bit of wheat germ to mine for more texture and health benefits, and it made the cookies very good.

Easy and very delicious! I used regular milk, added larger semi-sweet chocolate chips and walnuts. I will definitely be making these again!

This was a good recipe! I changed nothing, and as written they tasted a little dry to me. You definitely need to take the time to flatten these cookies before you put them in the oven. I actually loved the buttermilk flavor!

I used oatmeal and crunchy peanut butter and they turned out well. Not my favourite cookie, but nice as a change.
I got 43 random sized [medium to small], very pretty cookies.
Oh, and I broke a spatula mixing the dough!

I only added 2 TBS of pb & more chips. It was bland and cake like. The next day it was too soft and falling apart. Couldn't taste the chocolate flavor at all :(

Very simple and easy. Not quite sweet enough but ok.  It may have been the fact I used natural PB.  Good overall and does not require eggs (i was out).  Will make again.

Used 2% milk instead of buttermilk & chopped Easter Bunny for the chocolate since I'm a cheapskate, lol.  Turned out awesome & are super quick & easy.   No eggs, so that's a bonus for me being pregnant: I could indulge in some dough!!

This recipe was great.  The only change we made was, we used 60% chocolate chips.  Very yummy and semihealthy, right?

Made these as per recipe, but added more PB and an egg.The dough was too crumbly otherwise...would not stay together...turned out chewy, not too sweet. I also used canned milk instead of buttermilk as I did not have that on hand.
Hubby loved them!

This is a decent cookie. I didn't have any problems with it being dry or crumbly, I believe this is because I used all natural PB. I had to stir the oil back into the peanut butter when I opened the jar, of course, and I think this made for a better cookie. I used old fashion rolled oats and I can see that quick cooking is best...but it didn't ruin the cookies by having the old fashion oats, it's just the oats are more noticeable. They are fast and quick to put together. I rolled little balls and flattened with my fingers. I cooked mine for a good 10 min. maybe a little longer, can't remember. I didn't want them to be too soft and falling apart. Will make again!

I was looking for a recipe that did not require eggs, but used buttermilk (I have almost a whole jug from Thanksgiving), and these were okay. It took me longer than 10 minutes to make them, and I had to bake for probably 15 minutes or so. They are just... okay. That's what I get for running out of eggs!
