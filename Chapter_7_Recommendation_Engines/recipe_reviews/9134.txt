Pumpkin Pie is not my favorite but I have made this pie twice and everyone likes it. I think it's a good pie, love the topping. I made it exactly the way the recipe said and will continue to make it that way.

I overmixed the streusel mixture for the topping. Be careful or it will turn very clumpy. I probably should try this one again.

This is a different kind of pumpkin pie, but definitely delicious, I couldn't stay out of it!  I used a store bought crust, so I just sprinkled the pecans on top of the crust before filling with the pumpkin.  It was almost too much streusel topping, but since the filling isn't sweet, it works.

Loved the crumb topping on this pie.  Would have given  it 5 stars had it not been for the fact that I felt like the middle never really got to the consistency that I was expecting.  I wished it had just been a bit more firm.  But the flavor was great and this was an easy recipe to convert to gluten free.

This was a good (not great!) pumpkin pie. Personally, I cannot imagine it would have tasted like much of anything if I had not taken the advice of other reviewers and added cinnamon, nutmeg, and cloves to the filling. I loved the idea of adding the pecans to the crust, and also loved the topping. But I think that next time I will just stick to the filling recipe on the Libby's pumpkin can, and then use the crust and the topping idea from this recipe.

I used a large can of Santiam pumpkin......it must not have been puree...although it seemed fine.  The pie was awful---I wouldn't serve it and I probably won't try this recipe again.   So disappointing.  Happy I had other pies for our dinner.

Loved the crumbles on top. This was a huge hit at Thanksgiving. The crubs broke up the pumpkin a bit, which can sometime seem bland because of the consistancy of the texture. This was like a cross between the sweetness of the pumpkin and the best part of an apple crubs cake: the crumbs!

This was the first pumpkin pie I ever tried to make, it was impossible to find Pecans in England in October, but it worked anyway. Very easy to make and tastes great, even the kids loved it (British kids aren't used to eating pumpkin!)
