This was pretty good - I really liked the flavor on the cauliflower but not so  much the broccoli. I also cut down on the butter (and only made half a recipe which I'm glad - it's rich). Pretty simple to make so i'll make again at some point!

I made this for our Thanksgiving dinner, which was held at a location out of town.  I liked that I could make it ahead and bake it when we arrived at our destination.  I made it without changes and it was very tasty and enjoyed by everyone.

Made no changes, but I will next time.  Needs a little spicing up.  Great combination.  I put this with grilled pork tenderloin, recipe by:  Cathy Christensen and it went well.

I couldnt find 16oz packages of veggies, so used 12.5oz. Doubled the recipe and put into a deep 10X12 baking pan. Did not thaw veggies, since Im not baking until tomorrow. Fingers crossed.

I have made this several times and it is always a hit! I add garlic generously as my family likes it. I hate cauliflower, but I don't mind it this way!! It has been requested I make my "broccoli thing" for Thanksgiving, so I guess that means it is good :) OH! and I don't use frozen, always fresh. The frozen stuff is cr@p. And I always add cheddar cheese, everything is better with cheese!

Awesome! Pairs well with a baked Garlic Parmesan Chicken (can use the same breading for topping) when using fresh veggies, extend cook time (at least 15-20 minutes)

So I used 12oz packages of frozen broccoli and cauliflower which made it creamer and my family loved it. I couldnt find 16oz packages or i would have used them. Either way this recipe was a hit.

Delicious!  Glad it's vegetarian.  Several other recipes use chicken this or chicken that, but this doesn't.  Thanks, McCormick.  :)

I made it for my church's holiday dinner and it was a hit...all of it went! The changes I made were 1 bag of frozen broccoli & cauliflower mix and 1 bag of frozen broccoli, cauliflower & carrots mix. I also added cheddar cheese to the onion and milk mixture instead of parmesan, and I added 8 oz of cubed cream cheese instead of 4 oz. [=

Family loved it! If you aren't CRAZY about the flavor of Italian seasoning back off of the 1 tsp mixed in with the vegs/cheese mixture. It is really strong and why I didn't give it 5 stars. It may be better without it or with less. Will try both ways next time ... will absolutely be a next time. Also, i didn't thaw my broc/caul and it cooked up al dente which is the way my family likes veggies!
