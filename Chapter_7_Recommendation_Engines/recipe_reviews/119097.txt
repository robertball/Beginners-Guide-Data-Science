Very good cake like cookie.  The orange flavor isn't distinct until they are cool.  I did add a bit more rind, and I really like them.  Another good addition to my Christmas cookie tins . . . .

These cookies are delicious I found the recipe a couple of years ago I just added an extra twist. Take Toll House semi-sweet chocolate chips and slowly melt one package over a double boiler dip one side of cookie in chocolate and place on wax paper let them set about five minutes. There dreamy! ENJOY!!!

I'm in the middle of making these right now- wonderful! I followed the recipe except I didn't have a fresh orange, so instead of rind I added a small dash of orange extract. Delicately flavored- a nice orange/butter cookie.  We are going to ice them because of Halloween, but they are perfect as is! Would be nice for a tea party also.

These cookies had a great texture...very cake like. However, they didnt have a strong orange flavor like I had hoped. I even added the juice from a whole orange. That being said,  I will tweak & make these again. Next time I will add orange extract, maybe that will get me the taste I am looking for. I like the idea of coating it with cream cheese icing or half chocolate.

These were very good. Tasted like a slightly cakey sugar cookie with slight orange flavor.

I'll be making these again, and will change the rating if I need to. I forgot to add the baking powder, and baking soda, but they still came out decent. A little dry, almost like mini scones so a bit of icing or dunk in tea or coffee should fix that.

These cookies are wonderful.  As I started making them, I realized I didn't have an orange for the zest (I know, silly me), but I did have a lemon.  So, I used lemon zest and that was the only thing I did differently and they were absolutely fantastic.  A great, light, "citrusy" cookie.  Thanks for the recipe!

Easy to make, although too fluffy cakey for my concept of cookies. One can't taste much the orange taste. I added extra orange, extra grated lemon peel. I also added nutmeg and cardamom too make it more  Christmassy... and it worked.

I substituted margarine for part of the butter, and half a cup of brown sugar instead of whit and these came out quite nicely, if a little cakey/fluffy for my preference. I added a little more juice & rind than the recipe called for, which gave them a really excellent orange flavour. Blood orange rind gave them a splash of red that was a nice touch.

These are the only cookies I bake that my mom actually likes, so they are a staple in my book. I add more peel then it calls for because it makes the orange flavour stronger. I make them into a different shape and they are ladyfinger-esque.
