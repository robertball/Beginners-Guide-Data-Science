I added a tablespoon of lemon juice and brown sugar to make the sweetness stand out a bit more.

The jalapenos added an interesting taste but the honey was indistinguishable. Overall, not a recipe I'm eager to try again.

We thought these were great! I 1/2'd the recipe, but used 1 whole seeded, minced jalapeno. I also seasoned the burgers before cooking (I always do) w/ salt, pepper and garlic powder. While the honey flavor didn't stand out, I could detect a very slight sweetnes, which was nice w/ the jalapeno flavor. These came out moist and delicious! I will def make these again! Thanks for sharing. :)

Really nummy.. made these with Johnsonville sausage. Was a little greasy, but I did like the flavor. Next time I will use a mix of meats instead of all sausage
