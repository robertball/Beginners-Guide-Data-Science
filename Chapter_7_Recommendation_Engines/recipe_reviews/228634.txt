A delicious and easy recipe. I was skeptical about the mushroom soup but it was not overstated and I found it balanced the sauerkraut and gave a smoother texture. I followed the recipe except I added 1/4 cup apple cider vinegar to the kraut mix and coated my 2.5 lb roast with 4 oz of unsweetened applesauce to prevent drying. Those little individual cups of applesauce are convenient. Big hit with husband and I'll make again. A good dinner for guests IF they like kraut.

First, I love sauerkraut. Was glad when I saw this recipe because I had a half pork loin thawed out and didn't know what to do with it. Added just a few of the spices others mentioned and no cranberries but I love the way this turned out. I cooked it for 90 minutes.

A really easy, tasty dish.  Everyone raved on it, and said don't change a thing about it.  It's added to my recipe box and I know it will become a regular at our house.

The roast turned out moist and tender but we did not care for the sauerkaut mixture. I did change the cranberries for dried apricots as another reviewer suggested. jessie

What a delightful dish. Pretty outstanding with the limited ingredients. I used a pork loin tenderloin and substituted craisins. Covered with foil and at baked 350 for 1 hour/ 160 on meat thermometer. Will make this again, no doubt!

The only change I made was to omit the cranberries.  It was excellent, will make again (and again, and again)

Simply put, this was the best pork loin we've ever enjoyed.  We cooked it in a Ninja cooking system and added caraway seeds.  Absolutely delicious.

This was very good. I halved the recipe because we had a 1 lb. pork tenderloin frozen that I wanted to use. Given the smaller amount, I cooked it for 45 minutes...could have probably gone a little less. Next time I'll make some sweet potato, which I think would go well with this.

We made this recipe tonight and were very happy with it. I was a little concerned about the addition of the mushroom soup (mushrooms and sauerkraut?) but it ended up lending a nice creaminess to the kraut with no obvious mushroom flavor. I hurried the cooking by cooking the pork longer than just to brown, sauteing the onions a bit and warming the soup/kraut/apple/cranberry mixture in the microwave. This cut the cooking time to under an hour.
We'll be making this again and maybe trying adding a few more spices/herbs to it.

This recipe was simple and very good. I used pork steak and slow cooked in the oven. No need for a knife with this meal.

I doubled everything, but I feel there was too much soup. If I make this again, I may omit the soup altogether as the family didnâ€™t care for it too much.

Made this roast and followed directions for oven temp, etc.  After 1 hr 10 mins, I removed the 1.8 lb roast from the oven and tested the temp.  It was not done completely.  I would recommend a higher temp (400) and would also remove the cream of mushroom soup.  Visually, it was unappealing!

Family didn't like the taste so much - would rather have our pork loin lightly flavored, and our sauerkraut without additional sauce.

My husband just made this for Sunday dinner. It is fantastic! Because my digestive system cannot tolerate whole cranberries, he substitued dried apricots snipped into berry-sized pieces.
