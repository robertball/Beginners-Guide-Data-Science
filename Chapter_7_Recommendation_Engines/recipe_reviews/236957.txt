Excellent recipe!  I did not have almonds or almond extract, so I left them out.  I substituted some of the liquid from the cherries in the cake in place of some of the water. Taking a suggestion from another site, I combined a package of softened cream cheese with the whipped topping, giving it a firmer consistancy. It was a hit!

I was not as impressed as I had hoped. It makes a lovely presentation, especially for Valentine's Day. But it lacks flavor. I would add more almond flavoring, add another egg to make it more moist, and consider blending the cherry pie filling a bit to break up the big cherries. Another option is to slice each of the cake layers in two, creating four cakes layers which could then be made into a trifle. I will probably give it another shot with these alternatives.
