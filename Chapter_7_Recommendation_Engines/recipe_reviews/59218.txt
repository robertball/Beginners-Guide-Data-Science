Good recipe but I cut down on the oil by using stock and spraying the wok with cooking spray.  Also added a little shredded chicken.

This recipe is really awesome.The only change I did was to add beef. I marinated stripes of beef in "Easiest Teriyaki Marinade" recipe found also on this site.I sauteed the stripes before rice and garlic.Took the meat out of wok and added after frying the rice.Absolutely perfect.

This recipe was okay, but I used sesame oil instead of vegetable oil to give it a nice flavor.  It should have been mentioned that fried rice is made w/ day-old rice, because the texture does not come out authentic at all.  It's more like stir-fry mixed with regular rice.  Otherwise, not bad.

This was a good base recipe and the first time I added cabbage to fried rice so I'm happy to say that it was a great addition; I did not follow the recipe entirely since I had no broccoli, I decided agains putting in the water chestnuts after I opened the can and saw that they were brownish.  I skipped the onions too since the kids don't like them.  I did use onion powder, fresh garlic, shredded carrot, 3 cups of cabbage, and about 6 slices of bacon which I saved the fat to fry with the rice.  (I know not so lite now)  I don't like Chinese 5 Spice so I added salt, pepper, and some hot sauce; soy sauce on the side for those who wanted it! :)

Unfortunately this recipe was rather, well, disgusting. There was a strange unpleasant flavour.

We wound up trying sesame oil and Chinese 5 spice to add some flavor. None turned out well.

I decided to try this since I had 2 heads of cabbage and I don't like cabbage.  I used frozen broccoli and cauliflower, lots of garlic and no carrots.  Finally I found something to do with cabbage.
