Great way to use up some fresh broccoli and cauliflower.  The dressing on this is delicious.  Although I'm not sure what coconut palm sugar is, so I just used regular granulated sugar.  I didn't have the pepita seeds on hand, so I subbed sunflower seeds.  The next time I make this, I will have the pumpkins seeds for the recipe.  Served this with grilled Hawaiian brat patties, 'Summer Corn Salad' and 'Greek Deviled Eggs' both from AR. Thanks, Sarah O for sharing your recipe.  We really enjoyed it.

This recipe was so good i made it two days in a row!!:-)  The First day I prepared this dish with Coleslaw dressing instead  of Greek yogurt..Today i made the dish with a store brand mayo and store  brand Yogurt.  I also added two Jalapeno peppers for heat.   I will be eating this this recipe for along time to come..  This is my new favorite summer salad!!  I like it better than potato salad even.  Thank you for this amazing recipe :-)

Delicious vegetable salad. The red pepper add a wonderful sweetness. I used agave syrup instead of sugar, and I didn't have any unsweetened yogurt on hand so substituted sour cream. Delicious!

This is good! I like broccoli salad anyway, so it was very similar. I didn't use pumpkin seeds as I couldn't find them in the supermarket and prefer sunflower seeds so I used those for the crunch. Everything else stayed the same. Delicious!

Great recipe that holds up well for pot lucks.  I couldn't find pepitas either, so just used a trail mix that also had cranberries with nuts and sunflower seeds.  I upped the mustard a little, and then, for my husband only, added red pepper flakes.  Very good!

Great side salad! Nice way to use some fresh veggies. Used regular sugar and sour cream instead of yogurt just because it’s what I had on hand. Added matchstick carrots and used slivered almonds. It was a hit!

A very nice recipe.  I added bacon to make it even better!  Also, lightly blanched broccoli and cauliflower to bring out the flavors.

Used less mayonnaise, I didn’t have plain yoghurt, but cherry yoghurt used instead, as well as regular mustard and brown sugar. I used  a mixture of pumpkin and dried cranberry seeds. Loved it! Will serve it for supper with pork chops made on outdoor grill.
