My kids and I loved this. Loved. I will admit, I did add coffee to mine, but the kids drank theirs as is and asked for the rest of what was left in the saucepan. A+ drink.

Tasty! My kids were really excited to drink this.  It's smooth and tastes like a blended slice of pumpkin pie!  One thing I noticed- my cinnamon didn't mix in very well, since I just added it to the saucepan.  Next time, I will mix the cinnamon in with the pumpkin puree first, then add it to the milk.

I requested about 2 years ago for a hot drink besides coffee & cider for a Halloween party. R.R. wrote this to me. He had just started mixing the ingredients together so he didin't have a formal recipe, he gave me approximate measurements at the time. It is a staple in our house from mid September on! Haven't ccme across anyone who didn't care for it . The kicker of the drink is to you fresh whipped cream and freshly grated nutmeg on top...Holy cow thats good!

This is delicious with a few key changes. I added 1/2 cup dark brown sugar since 1/4 cup was not enough, and I do not like things too sweet! I added a few sprinkles of cloves and some fresh ginger, chopped. It does get chunky, but by all means, don't strain out the good things. PUT IT IN THE BLENDER!!!! It will be nice and frothy. Lovely drink.

These are surprisingly good! Straining them might help with the chunkiness at the bottom.

I made half the recipe and it was enough for the three of us! Tasty, easy and fun. I would in the future have a bottle of whipped cream on hand and this is would be a fun party drink to have on hand.

Delicious! It tastes like pumpkin pie in a mug :) I used whole milk and added some nutmeg and ground cloves to mine. Then  topped it with a bit of whipped cream and cinnamon. As I was pouring it into the mugs I noticed it was rather thick so I ended up pouring it through a strainer.

Yum!  This was de-licious!!!  The flavor was awesome.  I did add a dash of cloves and a dash of nutmeg and threw it in the blender to help it foam up and then strained it before serving.  YUM!  And when I want caffeine, I'll add a bit of coffee.  EDIT: I did find that when scaling it down (I've scaled it both in half and down to one serving) it is not as good as the full recipe.  From now on I will make the full recipe and save the leftovers in the fridge to reheat later!

This is good, but I made changes. I did half vanilla-flavoured coffee, half milk and added whipped topping with a dusting of cinnamon. This would've been better if it were more spicy (with nutmeg, maybe cloves...) and had slightly less sugar. I will skip the topping next time for sure. When making a single serving, I would increase the pumpkin puree to 1/3 cup and add sugar as per your personal taste.

We enjoyed this as a special treat instead of hot chocolate.  I fixed this according to recipe except for adding a dash of nutmeg and ground cloves.  I poured the hot mixture in a mug over a scoop of coffee ice cream, topped with whipped cream and sprinkling of cinnamon.  Next time I may add a cinnamon stick for presentation.  It was great!  Thanks RR for coming up with this recipe.  I had fun with it.

I just LOVE this drink. I make it every fall since finding it. I scale the recipe down to 2 servings with the calulate button and still get at least 3 servings. It is a great alternative for a warm drink without all of the caffeine from coffee, which I have to watch. I have made it as is and done a lighter version with low-fat milk and a packet of Truvia. It is great with lite whipped cream on top and a sprinkling of "pumpkin pie spice." Thank you submitter.

Great recipe. I am not a big coffee drinker so this is the perfect way to feed my Pumpkin latte addiction without having to have coffee.  I did add a small amount of nutmeg.  The taste was totally delicious.  I topped with whipped cream and toffee sauce YUM!!!

This is good.  I think it would have been better if I made it with heavier milk.  I used 1%.  It made the drink seem thin.  I followed the directions but just made 1 serving.  It probably took me 10 minutes of stirring on low.  You could tell when the cinnamon really absorbed into the milk.  The spots disapeared and the milk darkened.  I didn't add topping or coffee to my drink.

Really good. Probably best with whole or at least 2% milk, although it doesn't specify.  I only had 1% to use. Still very delicious, though. I will make this again. Thanks for the recipe, RescueRanger!

Straining would help, that was the biggest complaint I had.  My husband thought it was only ok nothing special and 3 out of 4 of my kids liked it. If I make this again i'll add nutmeg and cloves.

Great fall drink. I did add 1/4 cup dark brown sugar, a few aprinkles of pumpkin pie spice, topped it with whipped cream and cinnamon. Did not add coffee to the kid's drinks but added it to mine. Wonderful. Can imagine this around a fire on a cool fall evening.

This was really good, perfect warm treat on a cold fall day. I used light soy milk and Splenda to make it healthier.

I loved the flavor of this, but I had a hard time with the bits of pumpkin in the drink.  I know this is a personal issue, as I dont like pulp in my orange juice either.  Maybe next time I will try giving it a whir with my immersion blender.

Cooked it slowly, over medium heat then whisked it continuously and didn't have a problem with it being chunky at all. It was light and frothy. I added decaf coffee to mine, my son had it without, and my husband added coffee and kahlua to his, all yummy.

Not so great for me - maybe b/c I substituted 1/2 cinnamon & 1/2 pumpkin pie spice for the cinnamon?  I LOVE pumpkin, but just not this particular drink...

My new favorite cold weather drink! Made it as instructed, and wont mess with it. Great just the way it is. Much tastier than hot chocolate, and I would like to think a bit healthier too. Great with whipped cream on top, and a sprinkle of cinammon.

Yummy!  I gave it 4 stars because it was not quite sweet enough and could have used a bit more spice.  Ended up adding more sugar and next time will add more cinnamon, as well as a bit of nutmeg and maybe ginger.

This drink is delicious! Thick, rich, and creamy and oh so pleasantly pumpkin. I believe the success to making this recipe five stars is in the quality of the pumpkin you use. I used puree that I made myself from a sugar pumpkin and it was naturally sweet and the consistency of baby food. Perhaps using baby food, if you can find pumpkin, would yield better results because mine disintegrated well in the warm milk. I used brown sugar instead of white and used pumpkin pie spice instead of cinnamon because I wanted it spicier. I heated all the ingredients stovetop and before serving blended it with a stick blender which made a thick latte-like frothy topping and distributed the spice well through out the drink. This is one of those drinks ideal to nestle down on the couch with to settle in for the night. Sweet enough to feel indulgent but not with a sugar load that you regret. Thanks RESCUERANGER, this one is going on an index card clipped to the fridge as I know I'll be making it a lot!

Love this! Mixed everything but milk, then added milk last. Used brown sugar in place of white, and pumpkin spice in place of cinnamon. Made w/fat-reduced lactose-free milk.

Very good, especially with some whipped cream on top. I think next time I will either blend the mixture, or strain it, as I found it a bit too grainy for my liking.

This is pretty delicious! We served it at pumpkin carving party and people compared it a Mexican drink called Horchata. Great drink for the fall!

After reading reviews I knew this was going to be thick which I wasnt too crazy about, but the flavor was amazing. I think next tim Ill add coffee for myself. I recommend some whipped cream on top!

I love it, the husband loves it, the kids love it.  I used turbinado sugar and soy milk.  I used cinnamon and pumpkin pie spice, more spice than the recipe called for.  Delicious!  Thanks for sharing!

This was fantastic!!! I used pumpkin pie spice and mixed it in the blender before heating it up. It's great hot but I love it cool, too! We all loved it and my daughter called it pumpkin eggnog! Definitely a family favorite!

I didn't want a large qty of this, so made a single serving with 1/4 c pumpkin puree (canned), 3/4 C milk, 2 t sugar, 1/2 t pumpkin pie spice and 1/2 t vanilla.  Turned out great!  Was a little more 'texture' than I wanted, but the flavor was wonderful and I think others suggested straining it to get a smoother texture and I am sure that would make a very smooth result.  I have tried pumpkin latte recipes before, this is the best so far!  p.s. -- I "had" to add a shot of espresso to mine... coffee lover here! - without the shot, I'd maybe increase the milk to 1 C for a single serving.

Nicely flavored.  Only limiting to four stars because I like hot ginger tea, or cranberry punch made with fresh or frozen cranberries, or cocoa, or chai tea, or hot cider, or Russian tea, etc. so much better.  HOWEVER, none of those have the health benefits of pumpkin, and this is still pretty yummy stuff.  Didn't try coffee (can't drink it), but will try adding some instant barley-coffee-substitute next time.  Had no whipped topping of any kind, but would recommend it.  Used raw sugar, but will try stevia next time because I love the pics of a light-colored drink.  I made this up in a slow cooker, which worked okay, but this shouldn't be left in a crock for a long time.  If serving to a crowd, heat on the stove or in the nuke just prior to serving, then transfer to a slow cooker when it is time to serve. The milk and pumpkin gathered on the sides and needed whisked back in. I actually heated the concoction in the slow cooker itself. The longer this stayed hot, the more I thought that perhaps a touch of lemon would do this concoction some good, though I had to add a touch more sugar too.  That did help, but I'm not sure it needed lemon right away.  I think it just changed flavors over time and became a touch bitter or something.  I personally agree that this recipe ought to be treated to a good dose of the hand blender - at least for the general public, but I liked this okay with the bits, as did my daughter.  Served with Overnight Oatmeal Pancakes from this site.  yum!

This is really good!  I tried it with coffee too but liked it better without.  It was really sweet though so next time I am going to try cutting the sugar in half.  My husband loved it too!

Made it with unsweetened vanilla almond milk (due to dietary restrictions). Tried it with granulated sugar and brown sugar. I prefer with brown sugar. Also, used a pumpkin pie spice mix instead of cinnamon. Delicious treat!

This was a great fall/winter drink!  I made it as stated and it was delicious!  Next time I may add in some coffee and I bet it would be decadent!  I didn't have enough milk so I had to use a little flavored creamer to make up for the rest, which in return gave it some more flavoring.  It would also be good to froth up a little cream to put on top and give it a nice frothy head to it.  I will definitely be making this again.  Thanks for the great recipe!

I just made this and it tastes really good. I did everything as is except substituted pumpkin pie spice for the cinnamon, when I put all of the sugar in, I tasted it and wanted more so added double the amount of the total sugar amount. Added the extra in brown sugar though. Blended it for a few seconds for a nice and frothy texture. Yummm....Glad I will have this recipe on hand for when it starts to get chilly. Delicious, always have the ingredients on hand around this time a year and oh so easy.

This is so good! It might just be because I am a pumpkin freak, but I love this drink.
I heated all the ingrediants in a tea kettle.
I added a lot of cool whip on top and sprinkled some pumpkin pie spice and ground nutmeg. Mmmm!

Loved this! This is really great to make for a large group - those who prefer it without coffee can drink it as-is, and you can have some strong coffee for others to add as they wish (very good that way). Instead of straight-up cinnamon I used the same amount of a cinnamon + spice blend that included ginger and clove, and it was very good. I love that it uses real pumpkin - definitely healthier than the coffee house version of this drink!

EDITED TO ADD: The second time I made it, I used a blender to avoid the bottom of the pot being 'thick'. This worked REALLY well. Throw it in cold (before adding sugar), then heat on stove and add sugar. You could also blend it hot, particularly if you have an immersion hand mixer (which I do not). This made a HUGE difference in the texture.

Mmmm.  Made half the recipe using skim milk and Splenda.  Makes a nice after dinner/before bedtime  sweet treat. Might add coffee to the other half tomorrow morning. ***Added instant espresso powder to it the next day and really enjoyed it that way too.

This is an amazing drink. I was looking for something tasty to drink after spending all day in the snow. This recipe was amazing. I have three boys 17, 18 and the husband. They couldn’t get enough of this. I live in Germany and use a wonderful chunky brown sugar for everything. It really doesn’t compare to the brown sugar in the states, so I was a little worried about the changes. It turned out perfect. Wonderful recipe, Thank you

This is a great warm drink for Fall nights and great for Thanksgiving I didn't add coffee but added pumpkin pie spice and ground nutmeg. I also strained it and it was smooth and creamy. With these few extra steps it is 5 stars!

I made the 4 servings for my husband and I.  I added 1 more tablespoon of sugar and used 2 cups non fat milk and 2 cups decaf espresso.  It was delicious! Next time I think I might run it through the blender after it is heated through because the pumpkin does make the drink somewhat "grainy."  I might also top it with whipped cream and a sprinkle of nutmeg next time.

I loved it!  I halved the recipe and used unsweetened almond milk instead of regular milk and I substituted Splenda for the sugar.  It's  lower in calories and still delicious.

Tasty.  Made a batch for dessert as a tester before the holidays.  All enjoyed it.  I will likely add some baileys or a bit of whiskey as the holidays come.  Needs something to make it sing.

This is pretty good! Almost as good as Panera's (theirs is a little more creamy). I used 2% milk (I just microwaved it), mixed in some ground nutmeg and ground cloves like some reviewers did, used Splenda, and I didn't measure the vanilla- I always put more than stated on the recipe. I also added a little more pumpkin purée since the texture seemed thin. Next time I'll try adding instant coffee to the milk because milk alone makes me too sleepy.

This was a nice warm treat for the whole family to enjoy.  You definitely need to put it in the blender for a smoother texture.  That is my only complaint.  Presentation is everything so load up the Redi-Whip!

Kids and friends really enjoyed this recipe! After heating it up, I put it through a strainer which made it more pleasant for me to drink, just a personal preference of mine. I also added 1/4 tsp of cloves and a dash or two of nutmeg to my second batch and loved it even more!

Very delicious and good cold and hot. A great way to celebrate the autumn season. I made mine with fresh pumpkin and it is at its best this way, just be sure to cook it until it is very mushy so that it doesn't leave a grainy texture.

A good recipe!  I made this two ways - one without the coffee as listed for my kids, and one with coffee for myself.  I was really surprised my kids didn't like this - maybe if I had strained it first (they thought it was too pulpy).  I'll also try the blender next time, as another reviewer suggested.  Now for the coffee version - outstanding!!!  Perfect drink for a cool fall day!  I used 1/2 cup of brown sugar instead of the 1/4 cup of white (it wasn't too sweet at all, especially considering it was going to be mixed with coffee) and I also added a 1/2 teaspoon of pumpkin pie spice... but this was good without those additions too, it all comes down to personal taste.  Then I added a cup of the pumpkin milk mixture to 1 cup of very strong coffee and topped with some whipped cream and a sprinkle of pumpkin pie spice... best pumpkin latte ever!  I will definitely be making this again!

This was amazingly delicious! I was more impressed after I let it sit in the refrigerator and drank it cold. That's probably because I'm not a big fan of hot drinks. I would blend this with ice cream or even mix it in with eggnog. So many possibilities, but its also fabulous on its own! Thanks for the great recipe!

Great recipe, but I used coffee with half & half instead, plus little bit of nutmeg and cloves, and cooked it with cinnamon stick in the pan for a while to have more flavor. After pouring in a cup, I used whipped cream then sprinkle with cinnamon, plus chocolate syrup or caramel syrup, depending on preferences.

I used 2 cups skim milk and 2 cups heavy cream. Added some nutmeg. It was very creamy and comforting. My husband really liked it as is, but I def would like to add coffee next time.

Yum, needs a full flavored milk like whole or 2 Percent.  Great way to use leftover pumpkin purée, I usually scale it for one cup.

I tried this twice and liked it both times. I only had 1% milk, but next time I have some whole milk I will make it again just to see how it is as written. My husband liked this too which I was very surprised about as he hates coffee (yes, he's crazy) and rarely drinks anything hot. I added 1/2 a pack of Starbucks VIA coffee to mine both times. The second time I made it I used my immersion blender to smooth it out a bit. This made it much better and changed my rating from 3 to 4 stars. Smooth and creamy. Very tasty.

Wow!! This is delicious. I followed the recipe except added about a 1/2 Tbsp of sugar. The latte was thick and sweet and yummy. It's good with or without espresso added. Thanks for the recipe!!

Personally, I found this a little bland, but I'm keeping in mind that it is a "kid friendly" drink....minus coffee and heavy spices.  It's perfect for children and my husband who doesn't like pumpkin pie spice.  If it's spice you need, you can easily add spices.  I added a dash of cloves and nutmeg to mine.  And yes, it will go in my morning coffee!

This was just "OK." I guess there's no thing like the "real" thing (IMHO). My FAVORITE Starbuck's pumpkin spice cream specialty drink is WAAAAY stronger (but it just might be my taste buds!). Since I have a TON of canned pumpkin leftover, I will try this again, but will be sure to DOUBLE the amount of pumpkin. I made just one serving, so this could be the reason (I've found that when you scale a recipe, it just sometimes doesn't turn out as intended). Other than scaling back, my only other change was to substitute pumpkin pie spice for cinnamon. I have one helpful tip to share: I couldn't find canned pumpkin at any of my local grocery stores (I didn't try Fresh Market or Whole Foods specialty stores though...). I read online that canned pumpkin is IDENTICAL to pumpkin puree. At one time, Libby's labeled their cans as "puree" but do not anymore. One way to tell is by looking at the ingredient label on the can itself. Pumpkin should be the only item listed. If spices are included, you picked up pumpkin pie mix (but I guess you could just omit the spices called for to compensate...). Topped with Reddi-whip, this was a close copy, for sure. Thanks for sharing my favorite fall drink, RESCUERANGER :)

Everyone who enjoys pumpkin loved this. I did not add any coffee. We added a dollop of whipped cream on top...yummy! I will double the recipe next time. This was enough to serve 4 average coffee cups.

I love this drink!  Instead of messing with the stove, I just throw all the ingredients into my Vitamix, and blend on high until it steams.  Super easy!  I also added 1/2 tbsp coffee extract, and I used vanilla almond milk since I have a dairy intolerance.  Fantastic, definitely recommend!

I thought it was a wonderful change from my usual coffee and a great use of the sugar pumpkins I grew in the garden.  Next time I will add a little more spice.  If you like pumpkin pie, you will love this liquid version.  Thank you Linda for recommending this recipe on the Buzz.

Very blah and tasted as if I was drinking thin puree. Only one person actually finished their cup. Not really sure if this could be improvised but there wasn't anything going for it.

i used this as a starting point b/c i had been craving some kind of pumpkin flavored drink. our pumpkin pie crust was less than cooked perfectly so we basically had been only eating the filling.  i scaled this down to one serving and used 1/4 cup pumpkin pie filling and one cup sweetened coconut milk.  blended and then heated in the microwave.  continued alternating until the consistency was smooth.  ty for the inspiration.

I'm not a super fan of pumpkin lattes, but this is pretty good. I tried it as-is, and it's okay, but then I tried it with 1/2 a quart of coffee (I used Einstein bros. vanilla hazelnut) and 1/2 a quart of half&half. I brewed the coffee just for this, so I mixed the pumpkin, sugar, and spices in my saucepan, then poured the coffee in and mixed it over med. low heat. I think that the heat of the coffee helped to dissolve the pumpkin a little bit. Then I stirred in the half&half. I left it over med. low heat for maybe 5 minutes, then turned it to low and left it there until I could see the steam coming off of it, stirring consistently. I then poured it into a mug and topped it with cool whip and freshly grated nutmeg. De-lish.

This was good when made with 1/3 of the sugar called for and skim milk to reduce the calories. Next time, I may try maple syrup as the sweetener, as I think that would work well with the pumpkin. Thanks!

Loved this! The pumpkin was too thick for my family and I so we strained it, also added some brown sugar and nutmeg.

Either you love this or you hate this, there doesn't seem to be any in-between.  I had some guests who asked for seconds and other's who politely left it in their cups after tasting it.  I found it to contain a mildly bitter aftertaste and a grainy texture.  I would not take a chance on serving this unless you have tried it before-hand; and realize that you will have people who won't care for it at all.

Very very good!!! I used 1% milk (all I had) & brown sugar (a little more than called for) & whisked it all in a sauce pan.  I did not have a problem with lumps or getting thick.  I did add some coffee to the second batch & that was also great for us coffee lovers.

Tasty drink ~ a nice treat.  We liked it better with more sugar (we liked brown sugar best, about 1/2 cup), and with whipped cream and nutmeg on top.

I made this with 2% milk, Splenda, and a dash of salt. 
I forgot the vanilla but will try it with that next time.  I blended it in my blender for about 30-45 seconds, which make it have a wonderful texture and plenty of foam!  This was wonderful!

What a lovely treat! I used this recipe because I had to "get rid of" some extra canned pumpkin that I had. I halved the recipe, added some pumpkin pie spice as well as a bit of cinnamon, and continuously whisked on medium heat for a good 15 minutes or so. The result was a delicious treat! I will definitely be making this again!

It was ok for something different. I did scale the recipe down & someone else said that made a difference so maybe that's why I wasn't in love with this, but pumpkin is healthy & I will make this again.

i ended up straining this as it was a little thick. Nice flavor with a pinch of nutmeg at the end. Would have been nice to have a dollop of whipped cream to top it off.

I can't compare it to Starbucks because I've never had the Starbuck's pumpkin latte.  But right now I can't drink coffee (due to the acid) and I've wanted to have a latte.  Of course this is not a latte but I like the body the pumpkin adds to the milk.  This time I used straight cinnamon and skipped.  Next time I'll try using Trader Joe's Pumpkin Pie Spice (my favorite pumpkin pie spice blend).  I bet it will be great!

I wasn't sure if I'd like this or not, so I split the recipe in half. It was pretty good! I added a little bit of pumpkin pie spice...and also ended up adding the tiniest amount of decaf instant coffee, about 1 tsp, it helped bring out some of the flavor!

I did not make any changes besides adding whipped cream and cinnamon on the top. The fact that it had no caffeine was okay. I would make it again and add a little caffeine in it.

This drink is extremely good, but make sure to be generous with the cinnamon! Other than that, cook the drink a few minutes longer (11-13 minutes) to make sure that the liquid can blend a lot better.

Very good!  I did not enjoy the cinnamon floating on top, so next time I might blend it up or mix the cinnamon with the sugar and pumpkin first.

I loved it. But to make it that much greater I substituted the white sugar for 1/2 cup brown sugar as suggested in one of the reviews and I added 1/2 tsp nutmeg, 1/4 tsp ground cloves and 1/4 tsp fresh grated ginger. I also blended the mixture afterwards. But next time I would use ground ginger instead of fresh grated ginger because even after I blended the mixture there were still a few chunky bits of ginger. This recipe made 1 quart (4 cups). I stored the leftovers in the fridge and sometimes served it cold which tasted just as good. I even mixed it with some hot chocolate to make a pumpkin spice hot chocolate. YUM.

I usually go to 7/11 after school and pay for a psl but this saved me so much money! It was delicious! I like coffee, but sometimes, less is more.

I am not sure what I did wrong. I thought it tasted kinda bland then I got to the bottom of the cup and there was a big glob of cinnamon and sugar sitting there.

Gave this a go after canning 5 quarts of pumpkin puree. Tastes good and probably healthier than Starbucks. I did stick the pumpkin and some milk in the blender first before heating.

Love it. Forget Starbucks. I will definitely make it again. I'm two months pregnant and I was craving a pumpkin latte. This drink is perfect. Thank you for the recipe.

I made it with some changes. Used fresh pumpkin and used the nutri bullet to blend everything together, then simmered to light boil and poured a cup of boiled tetley orange pekoe tea in it, it was amazing, drank half hot and left the rest in refrigerator. to cool and drank later. We just loved it

It was very good, but the pumpkin puree collected at the bottom. When I make again, I will strain it.

It was a very fall time appropriate drink, especially for people like me, who do not enjoy coffee... I did add another tablespoon of sugar; trust me youll need it. I also topped it with HOMEMADE whipped cream. Trust me on the homemade part.

This was excellent, easy to do, and makes plenty.  Served it to 14 people, some of whom added some coffee. I think the addition is excellent - maybe about 25% at most.  I doubled the recipe and had plenty left over for seconds. Liked it enough to serve to guests again this weekend.

made it as recipe directed - used skim milk and proportions given. was ok, but felt watery and bland.

made it again - whole milk, increased sugar, increased cinnamon and dash of ginger. AMAZINGLY DELICIOUS !!! 

my canned pumpkin did not require blending, but I can see how some may. sweetness may also vary by pumpkin / brand.

This was really good.  I did add coffee to mine. I didn't have a problem with it being thick at all. I really whisked while warming to help make extra frothy. Think next time I'll add some pumpkin pie spice. I used skim milk but would be great with whole milk if you don't mind all the calories. Topped with whip topping and a caramel drizzle.

I didn't think this was great and I wanted to!
I added some pumpkin spice after I tried it following the recipe. It was a little better, but still didn't really care for it.

This is wonderful! It really does taste like pumpkin pie in a mug. I used brown sugar instead of white and I sprinkled a little nutmeg on top. Halfway through drinking it I noticed it was a little pulpy so I strained it and it was even better. Next time I'll strain it into the cups.
