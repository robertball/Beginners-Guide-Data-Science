This recipe was decent. It did need some tweaking as it was a little bland in my opinion. I ended up using close to a full teaspoon of garlic powder and almost two teaspoons of oregano. I also added salt and pepper to taste. I think the next time I make it, I will add grilled chicken to it, to make it a fuller meal. I had to substitute chicken boullion for the broth and I think next time I do that, I will use 1 full block per cup of water instead of half a block per cup for a stronger flavor. All in all, it was a good recipe and did not take very long to make at all

BLAND!  This recipe was easy, but lacked any flavor outside of the broth.  There was no where near enough garlic or oregano to add spice to the dish, I couldn't even find them in any bite.  If I were to do this dish again, I would definitely add a few cloves of minced garlic and fresh basil.  The dried oregano did nothing for the freshness of the vegetables.  Salt and pepper are a must have in the recipe, as well.

This was really not to my liking.  Even with addition of salt and pepper, and extra oregano and garlic powder, it just did not taste good.  I should have looked for a recipe with a better rating, but this one looked so simple that I ignored its mediocre 2 1/2 stars.

I read the reviews that said this was bland and boy were they right. I even added extra spices to give it flavor, but nothing could help. It tasted like spaghetti noodles in chicken broth. I was embarrassed to make this for company! I kept apologizing for how flavorless it was.

I added cubed chicken and about a dozen cooked shrimp to the mix. Was pretty bland so I dropped in more various spices and salts. 

All in all, ok recipe.

Easy, quick weekday recipe. Didn't have broccoli so used cauliflower instead.  Used fresh minced garlic (2 cloves) instead of garlic powder and stock instead of broth.  Used too much stock, so it ended up more like soup instead of pasta primavera.  Also, added kosher salt to taste (like every other review said, it was far too bland w/o the salt).  All in all, it was good.  Much to my surprise, my 7 year old ate it.  I would make it again.
