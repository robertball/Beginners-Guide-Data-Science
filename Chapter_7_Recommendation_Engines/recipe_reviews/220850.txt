I cut this recipe in half. How I did it was bake it in a 8x8 square pan and just use half the crescent roll dough on the bottom and the other half on the top. I made my own turkey sausage using ground turkey and spices and the milk I used was a mixture of 1% milk and fat free evaporated milk, which made it creamier. I did add some fresh ground pepper to the eggs. This turned out like a mix between a strata and a stuffed breakfast pizza. My family liked this but my husband thought it needed a little more inside the crescent rolls. Next time, I'll throw in some sauteed vegetables and maybe some spices. Good base recipe to make your own.

YUMMY! I used 1 roll of crescents in an 8x8 pan, but kept everything else the same b/c I wanted a nice, thick casserole...worked perfectly! Great flavor and couldn't have been simplier...will be making this again! Thanks for sharing. :)

This is a great breakfast casserole! My daughter and my co-workers really enjoyed it and wanted the recipe. I used half mild  and half maple flavored Jimmy Dean sausage, half mild & half Sharp cheddar cheese, lemon pepper seasoning & a zesty season blend. The crust cooked fast and the middle of the casserole was slow to cook. I reduced the temperature to 300 and put the casserole on the lower rack to cook an additional 10 minutes. I still love this dish and plan to do it again but substitute condensed milk  with 1 cup of milk instead of the 2 cups of milk.

Great and easy recipe.  The only thing I did differently is only used one package of crescent rolls.  That seems to be enough.  Everyone loved this recipe.  I end up making it at least once a week!

Super easy and super tasty!!  I made this the day before, let it sit in the fridge overnight and popped it in the oven the next morning.  Great for my kids before school!  Mine did take almost an hour to cook...

Very yummy! I had to cook it at least 10 min longer than the recipe says because it was still too runny...but no worries. Will surely make it again!

This was so awesome! I cut the recipe in half for my square pan. It was perfect! Change nothing! I have to say though that I only refrigerated this for about 4 hours, and I used up some Monterey jack cheese instead of cheddar. I baked in my convection oven at 350 and it took exactly 30 minutes. Rock on. K-Dub, you're a genius.

Love it. Only changes I made were to use an 8" x 8" greased casserole dish and used only 1 cup of milk. I only needed 1 can of crescent rolls, split half on bottom and half on top. Baked at 350 for 45 minutes; then covered top loosely with foil to keep it from over cooking, and baked 15 more minutes.  My new special occasions breakfast casserole.

Great NFL football morning tailgate crowd favorite.
For us, baking for 50 to 55 minutes seems to work at sea level.  2 cups of shredded cheese improves it too.
Couldn't get the powdered mustard to mix, it would ball up  and just not jive, so I used a tsp of hot dog mustard instead.
I use Jimmy Dean Sausage.
After slicing out a serving, country gravy over it is a real plus.

We liked the concept of this dish, but I think next time we'll use spicy sausage to give it a little more flavor.

This is delicious! I scaled down the recipe for 2.  I used 1 can of the dough on the bottom (so I didn't roll it, I just patted it in) and baked it open-face.  I used the whole amount of sausage, the whole amount of cheese, 3 eggs and 1 cup of milk.  I baked it in a 8x8 pan for 40 minutes and it turned out perfectly done.  Eggs were soft but set and not at all runny.  This is a keeper!!

I wanted to make this in a 9 x 13 pan and made some lucky guesses on what to increase! I used 12 eggs, 4 cups of milk and 2 cans of crescent rolls. I kept all of the other ingredients as listed. One can of crescent rolls was perfect for the bottom; I could stretch it to fit the bottom. The top one was a little tricky as it sort of just floated on the eggs. There was also enough mixture for an extra 4x4 casserole - perfect for a low carb guest. It all came out great with no leftovers!

We actually made this recipe with cubed portuguese sausage that we did not cook ahead of time....and it was fantastic!! I was brave enough to change the recipe after reading other reviews. Definitely a Christmas morning hit!
