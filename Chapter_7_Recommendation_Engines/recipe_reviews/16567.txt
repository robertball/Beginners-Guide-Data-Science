Holy cow, if anyone out there has high blood pressure, PLEASE leave out the salt!! It's not necessary as there's already plenty of it in the ham. Too much salt can surely ruin a perfectly good dish and without it, this salad is very tasty and worth making for lunch with your leftovers.

AWESOME! At first, I thought it was just okay and decided to "doctor it up" in the morning...make this the night before, and let it set in the fridge overnite...Big Difference! I used half sweet pickles and half dill (couldn't decide!), and I also ground it up in the food processor. Our local deli's is very good, but this was so much better...thanks James!

I am not a cook....whoo...that is a understatement. I whipped this up from some left over ham and my husband went crazy over it. We did add some hard boiled eggs to this recipe and we were delighted at how wonderful everything blended together for a fantastic taste.

I made this ham salad for finger sandwiches for a special function.  I also made egg salad and tuna salad.  The ham salad sandwiches went the fastest.  Everybody raved about the taste.  I highly recommend this recipe.

I found this recipe to be very easy to make.  However, it is extremely salty.  I would not recommend the use of additional salt.   I wish that I had noticed the sodium content prior to making the recipe.  I ruined a good ham.  I would attempt to make this again, only no smoked ham and no extra salt.

This salad was easy and had a great taste!!!  I used half mayo, half Miracle Whip, and used dill relish instead of sweet relish.  I don't normally like ham salad, but this was good!!!  I also left out the salt as suggested in another review.

I used miracle whip in place of the mayo and left out the celery since I didn't have any and it was still great.  Oh, and I only put in a pinch of salt. I can't wait to try it with the celery.

I am not a huge ham fan and found this recipe ideal for after-the-Holidays leftover ham.  I added some spicy mustard for a bit of added flavor.  I also chopped the ham and veggies in the food processor for a nice small consistency.

I used regular ham instead of smoked.  Other than that, I followed the recipe as stated.  The taste didn't appeal to me.  I found it much too salty, and I did not like the texture either.  My suggestion is to omit the salt until the very end; then season to taste.

Good - but all the extra ingredients are unnecessary. All you really need is ground cooked ham, sweet relish & mayo.

Very good!  I made it in my 3 cup electric food chopper. I first chopped up the onion and celery, then ham and rest of ingredients.  It got chopped fine and mixed all in the one container.  I cut way back on the recipe.  I just wanted to make enough for a sandwich and/or on crackers.  I used leftover honey-baked spiral cut ham.  I didn't really measure ingredients but just eye-balled it and tasted.  I got way too much onion at first, so then added more ham and mayo.  I didn't have any green pepper but think it would add a nice touch.  No more will I buy ham salad at the deli.  Thanks, James!

Absolutely DELICIOUS!!!!  I am not a big fan of ham salad but this was great.  Ran the ham through the food processor to save a little time and would suggest cutting the mayo down a bit; start at 2/3 cup and add to taste.  Added a little more sweet relish to make my mother happy and it worked out perfect.

This is excellent with a couple of modifications -- I only used about half the mayo and half the salt.  It didn't need any more than that.  Cut the celery and onion into a few chunks, dice it in a food processor (using the "pulse" setting), then add the ham cut into chunks.  Dice the ham with the food processor, add remaining ingredients, and turn on food processor again to mix, and it's done! (Unfortunately the food processor only works for smaller batches, but you can use it for each ingredient and then mix together in a bowl.)

this was very easy to assemble and my husband and I loved it.  I added 1 cup of grated cheddar-jack cheese, and thought that was a good addition.  If your kids hate onions as mine do-leave out or use half the onions the recipe calls for.  A great recipe!

My husband had never had homemade ham salad, and we had a ton of ham left over from the holidays, so this seemed ideal.  He is the cook, for the most part, and couldn't stop raving about it.  I felt the same way once I tasted it!

This ham salad was the best I've had.  The only changes I made were dill relish instead of sweet, and no green pepper because I had none.  I will definitely make it again.  Can't wait to try it with the green pepper!

WORD TO THE WISE: I would skip the 2 tsp of salt altogether(ham is salty in itself)! This is a good base recipe that you can easily adapt to your own tastes. I as noted above skipped the salt as well as the green pepper(did not have one). I used light miracle whip to reduce the amount of fat. I love ham with pineapple so I added some pineapple which gave it a nice flavor. Next time I make this I will mix it up in my food processor to make it more of a spread. So all in all this was good.

This was the best ham salad I've ever eatten!! To cut down on the calorie and fat I put in low fat whipped salad dressing instead, no sugar added bread and butter pickles and red pepper instead of green! I also added some finely shredded cheddar cheese and a little mustard! WOW! My picky eater kids ate it with a spoon! Now they keep asking for it in their lunches for school! I can't keep enough of it on hand! I even made the sandwhiches with a couple of slices of cucumber on it between the bread. Soooo yummy!

First, you need to know that I always make my first attempt at a recipe EXACTLY AS WRITTEN.  I make NO substitutions, additions or subtractions.  That being said...

The flavor is good. It would be a hit as an appetizer, served with crackers and cheese.  But the texture is not what we were looking for.  It was "wet," and bland (to us).

To rectify the situation, I placed all ingredients in the food processor.  I added 10-12 crushed bacon flavored Ritz(TM) Crackers; 1/2 tsp onion powder; 1/2 tsp garlic powder; 1/4 tsp cayenne powder.  If your mixture is not too "wet," and you don't use crackers, you MAY need to add a pinch of salt.  TASTE FIRST!

I give it 4 stars (can't give it 4.5 stars, or I would have) because it needed adjustments for my family, but it is a great starting place for making it to your own preference. Thanks James!

Outstanding! This was one of the best ham salads we have ever eaten! I made some changes: I cut the recipe down to six servings ~ and that *still* made quite a bit of salad! I, too, omitted the green pepper and salt (most ham is salty enough already!) and found it to be perfect without it. Another thing I did was to use the "chop" button on the blender for the ham; then I threw everything into a big bowl and mixed it up.  What a great way to use up the left over ham from Easter dinner!  Thanks for sharing ~ this is wonderful!

I'm very happy with the way it turned out.  I didn't have green pepper so omitted that and the salt.  I just threw onion and celery in with ham and blended it all together.  Used just enough mayo to coat it.  I must say I wasn't crazy about it with the relish (glad I didn't use much)  I also added about 2 tbsp or so of mustard and then it was perfect!!

I made a few changes -- no bell pepper, because my kids and I don't like them.  Dill pickle relish, instead of sweet - again, personal preference.  And, I added a few boiled eggs.  I like the extra "crunch" that the celery gave the salad.  Oh, I also added some garlic salt and onion powder,for a little extra punch.  A good salad though, I had lost my original recipe -- I like this one, with the few changes that I made.  Thanks for sharing!

Oh boy James, this is really awesome.  I put it all in the grinder. I added a couple of hard boiled eggs to it and used sweet gerkin pickles instead of sweet relish. No salt added. Next time, I will try this with bolonga instead of the ham. Definately a keeper!  Thanks James for sharing! Deborah

Never made h.s before but mom did. I like to doctor stuff so I used the ham, dill pickle with dash of splenda, pepper, celery, mayo,and little bit of left over long grain wild rice. With these I did not need to add extra salt and splenda to cut back on sugar in sweet pickles. Husband loved it.

This was so easy and tastes great! I normally am not a big fan of ham salad, but I had part of a ham in the freezer and wanted to get it out of there! HOWEVER, it was a turkey ham (i.e. a very watery, pressed hunk of meat), so I upped the amount of ham. I used 1 1/2 # of ham and half the amount of the other stuff. I put it all in the food processor, and it still turned out quite "loose", so I am now draining it in a sieve over a bowl. So if any of you have a cheapo pressed ham, it can still work out! The taste is great from such a few simple ingredients.

This was great!  We had leftover baked ham from a party, and this was a delicious sandwich.  Followed the recipe exactly -- next time we would not add salt since ham is salty by itself.  Loved it!

No one in my family likes ham salad but me. I love to eat it on TownHouse crackers. I cut the mayo down (thank you previous reviewers) and omitted the salt, bell pepper and used only 1 celery stalk. I used leftover honey baked ham, threw it all in the processor and Wallah! Delish!

Better than the Amish Market!!
I usually buy this at the Amish Market when I want it, but this came out amazing.  The only thing I will probably change is the next time I make it, I will only add one teaspoon of salt...I used a honey ham, but I didn't think that most ham has salt in it.  I will use this recipe again for sure :)

I gave this 4 stars because it was very easy to make, but a bit on the salty side.  I made it for a luncheon today and had no raving reviews or requests for the recipe, but non the less it did the job.  I will probably not add salt and use dill relish next time.

I thought this tasted good. I made 1/4 of a recipe which still came out close to 2 cups of ham. So the whole recipe would take 7-8 cups. I used Hellmann's mayo with olive oil. I didn't think it had tons of flavor at first, so upon seeing similar recipes I added 1/8 tsp of garlic powder and onion powder, a few dashes of hot pepper sauce, and a pinch of caraway seeds. Per other reviews I cut the salt in half. Ham has plenty of salt already. I put it all in my Vitamix machine on speed 2 and blended it about 20-30 seconds with the tamper. Plain wasn't so great, but just made it was quite tasty scooped on a toasted English muffin and topped with tomato, Vermont white cheddar cheese, and broiled into a melt.

I had some leftover ham (alright alot of it) to use up after a family get together and this was perfect for getting rid of some of it! Now due to personal preference I omitted the salt. I dont like adding salt to many things and I used vegan mayo because Im allergic to eggs. It was Great will deffinately do this again. Even my kids loved it ( I used regular mayo for theirs though lol)

This was a fantastic use of leftover ham from Thanksgiving.  I used half the amount of onion called for because my family probably wouldn't eat it otherwise.  I used dill pickles in lieu of sweet relish, again my picky family's preference.  I chopped it all in the food processor, which was so easily good!  Then went to combine with the mayo and realized I was light on mayo.  I ended up using half mayo and half ranch dressing.  We really enjoyed it this way, but then we love ranch around here.  I don't think it needs the salt called for and didn't add it.  I thought the green bell pepper added a delicious crunch!  Thanks for the post.  Made a darn good sandwich.  This is also great served on lettuce leaves with cheese sprinkled on top. YUM!

I like it, made a couple changes. About half the salt is plenty.   Also, I prefer using an old fashioned grinder and running ham, green pepper and bread & butter pickles thru the grinder. I also added about 2 Tbsps of ground mustard. Great sandwiches!

This is a wonderful *base* recipe to use leftover ham in a hurry. However, as written, this recipe uses too much onion and is too salty. The longer you keep the dish in the fridge, the stronger the onion will become. The first time I made this, I couldn't get enough and was eating right from the processor. The next day, the onion had consumed the flavor the ham and I couldn't get past the first bite.

This time I used about 2T of chopped white onion; enough to taste it the first day and enhanced the flavor of the ham the following day.

I used 1 C Smart Balance light dressing in place of the mayonnaise. Since everyone seems to have their own mayonnaise preference, you may want to start by adding 1/2 C at a time.

I followed another reviewers suggestion and used 1/2 sweet and 1/2 dill relish. The sweet relish provided a nice contrast to the ham and onion.

There really isn't a need to mix the wet ingredients separately. I threw the diced ham, onion and celery in the food processor and pulsed until I was happy with the consistency. I transferred the ham mixture to a storage bowl then added the dressing and relish.

This meal is designed to be enjoyed over a few days. Since the original recipe didn't taste good beyond day one, I had to give it 4 stars.

Excellent ham salad recipe. I didn't have any peppers so I added extra celery and I used red onion....definitely will use all my leftover baked ham slices for this ham salad. Makes a great lunch. I put everything in my mini-processor and only used half the mayo.

Yum! So delicious. This was savory and tangy with loads of eye opening flavor. I cut this down to 2 servings and used deli lunchmeat sliced ham that I chopped fine, Miracle Whip, dried onion, left out the green pepper and salt, and served this immediately with Ritz crackers. This made a fast delicious lunch in less than 10 minutes and turned that everyday ham into something special.

Since I do not have a food processor, I hand diced the ham, but in my opinion, it was not fine enough. We did not care for the pickle relish in the recipe, feeling it made the salad too tangy. However, I hope to get a food processor soon and plan to try it again without the pickle relish.
9/13/15 - Now that I have a food processor, we really enjoy this recipe as written, including the pickle relish!

My mom used to make the best ham salad, similar to this.  It was an old german recipe, I believe.  The only difference is no green peppers, and instead of using relish, you use banana peppers.  Also, use a meat grinder or food processor instead of chopping or cubed ham.  You can also use a leftover pot roast or beef, and make what my mom called just plain "meat" salad - also excellent!! :)

This was very good. I had never had ham salad before so I wasn't sure what to expect. I added some green olives and horseradish powder and left out the salt completely. I agree with the other reviewer that this is better the next day. I made sandwiches out of these w/ homemade cheddar onion bread and served spicy oven fries w/ a bbq dipping sauce. Easy fast dinner. Chopped eggs would have been a nice addition but I was too lazy and it was fine without it.

I made it, but cut the mayo and salt in half. Instead of celery I used red grapes. It was absolutely great spread on Wheat Thins!

I made a small test batch with ham, mayo, red onion and sweet relish. We tried it on Ritz crackers. Wow it was great and my husband liked it.

Very good!!  Don't use any additional salt though...the ham itself has enough.  I put everything in a food processor and it turned out great.

This ham salad was just excellent.  It was all I could do to stay out of it.  I cut the recipe in half, and that made an awful lot.  I thought the onion and pepper in it gave it a southwestern flavor, kind of like a "ham salsa".  It was really very complex.  The only subtle variation in the recipe I made was to use Miracle Whip instead of mayo.  My only complaint is that it had a bit too much liquid in it, making it sort of runny.  It would be nice if I could have added something, or dried something, to get some of the moisture out.  Still, a fantastic ham salad.

If you make this using a blender or food processor, process only the ham, onion and celery. Chop the pepper by hand and mix the dressing by hand to mix into the processed meat and vegetables.  I agree with another reviewer: leave out the salt! Cut it in half if you absolutley have to have it. The flavor is great!

Very good.  Only 4 stars b/c it was alittle too mayo for me.  Next time I think I'll scale down the mayo. I cut the recipe in half and used 1/4 cup onion & grn pepper.  As others suggested I didn't add any salt. I also added some colby cheese, which added good flavor.

I used Miracle Whip instead of mayo...less calories, more zip!

Yummy! I am trying to use up the rest of this spiral cut ham that my boyfriend got, and this is yet another delicious way to do so! I didn't change a thing with the exception of omitting the salt (this particular ham was very salty already). I'm going to serve this on wheat thins for my man when he comes home from work!

Pretty good recipe.  I did make the following modifications:  as others have suggested, OMIT THE SALT.  I omitted the salt and didn't need to add any.  I also used 1/2 red pepper instead of green pepper - just prefer the flavor.  I used the 2 cups of mayo per the recipe, but when I make it in the future, I will likely reduce to 1-1/2 cups.  Also would reduce the sweet relish to 1/2-3/4 cup.  The last 2 recommended reductions are to maintain a firmer texture to the ham salad and prevent it from getting too soupy.

I read several reviews and followed the advice of not adding any salt and not using smoked ham. I made this for a luncheon with the ladies in my family. It was delicious and well received. I will definitely make it again.

BEWARE!!  LOVED IT, WITH EXCEPTION!!  Recipe "as is" with 2t. salt is WAYYYY too salty for me.  Ham is naturally salty, and I believe 2t. of salt is a lot of salt  for any recipe.  I omit the salt entirely and the recipe was AMAZING!!!  I might recommend trying recipe without the salt first, then add in as your palate wishes!

Very good ham salad! I scaled this down to four servings and used my mini-processor on the ham, celery and onion. I also added a little Dijon mustard, garlic and onion powders. I left out the salt and green pepper. This will be great on crackers, on bread or just like that. Better than what you get at the store! Thanks for this easy recipe, James!

Used this for a sandwich so ham should be diced small.  Flavor probably improves if it's prepared ahead of time.

OMG this is the perfect "base" but I read through all the reviews and ended up NOT adding extra salt, onion powder instead of chopped, 2 Tbs. spicy mustard, 1/2 c shredded cheddar and 10 Ritz Bacon crackers!  Absolutely DELISH!!!

This is an excellent base recipe. I do agree with others in that I only used 1/4 tsp. of salt in the beginning and then added a little extra once it was mixed. All ham has a different level of salt content when being processed. This recipe is delicious as is and allows for adjustments to fit each individual taste.

This was very good but I did deviate from the recipe in a couple of ways.  First, I didn't add salt because Ham has plenty - no need to add more.  I added carrots and onions and skipped the other veggies in the recipe.  Lastly, I used a little bit less relish than suggested.  I think that's it.  It was pretty good.

Made this today, after letting it sit for a few hours, hubby tried it. It's a hit, he says don't change anything. Me on the other hand it isn't as sweet as I like it, having had it from my grandma's house out in Pittsburgh my whole life. It's awesome on little potato rolls.

I make this all the time and it's a hit.  I do not add relish because I bake my ham with brown sugar and syrup.  Just the right sweetness, really like green pepper.

My son asks to take this to school for lunch every day! He loves it! The only difference is that I used my homemade sweep pepper relish instead of pickle relish.

I had 1/2 lb of smoked ham left, which was perfect for 4 servings of this recipe.  It was tasty after I put it together, but another spin around the processor gave it a smoother texture which was more what I was after.  Based on reviews I didn't add the salt, and it was scrumptious on crackers.

I'm sure after a few hours in the fridge the flavors will blend even more.  We'll probably sprinkle a little salt and cayenne on top, once it's piled on a cracker.

Will probably add a dollop of mustard to the next batch, but regardless, this is a keeper.  Thanks for the recipe!
--------
Made it again; loved it as written.  Only slightly processed the ham.  Great cool dinner with crackers on a hot night.  Great lunch the next day!  Yum.

I gave this 4 stars because as written that would have been way too much mayo and salt for an already salt cured ham. I was looking for something that was like my mom's ham salad recipe. This was close but I tweaked it to make it like hers. I can tell you that I used probably 3 lbs of ham and cubed it and then put it in the food processor to finely grind it. My mom used a meat grinder back in the day.  I removed the ham to a large bowl. Then I chopped the onion and celery and put it in the food processor to finely chop. I did not add salt or pepper, nor did I add the green pepper because we don't like the flavor in ham salad. I added the onion and celery  in the amounts written to the ground ham and about 1/2 cup of sweet relish and then just added mayo to the consistency that I wanted the spread but it was way less than 2 cups, I used probably half of that. When you grind everything down, the mayo spreads out better and you require less of it. This spread is perfect in sandwiches or on crackers or bruschetta.

I made the ham spread this morning, I used half mayo and half miracle whip and just a dab of sour cream.
I didn't add any salt, the ham has enough in it ( smoked ham ) . I used a dill pickle  i had on hand from Jimmy Johns, and some sweet relish . red bell pepper , celery chopped small and a  little red onion to my liking .  it's one of my husband's favorite ways to have left over ham from any holiday.

I apologize for not posting a picture. This Ham Salad was gone before I had the opportunity.
I made the recipe as written. I have thrown Ham Salad before, and was  unimpressed.

I had a leftover
 1/2 pound of BOARS HEAD deli ham that I needed to use. Using the Awesome tool or ALLRECIPES I adjusted the recipe. 

Now for all those whiners out there who complained up "too much salt", DUH. Even a beginning chef knows you taste as you season. Just because James said to add 2 tsp., ultimately it good to check it out. Ham is different and has varying degrees of saltiness.   

This recipe is now added to my recipe box....

For me, this recipe made way too much dressing for the rest of the ingredients.  Didn't really care for the relish element either - just personal taste.
