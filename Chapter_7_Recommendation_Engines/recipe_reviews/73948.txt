Wow- this one is a keeper!!!  I'm still a novice, so I'm very selective about the recipes that I keep in my "black box".  This one got four out of four family votes for the box- even my 6 and 4 yr olds loved it!  I followed the recipe exactly except I used a 2.5  lb chuck roast instead of a 4 lb, and I did NOT adjust the other ingredients to match.  It turned out perfect!  Thanks for sharing!

This is sooo good!!! My family loves anything 'chili' so it was a huge hit!! We took it with us on a family 'potluck' and everyone who managed to get a sandwich raved about it! I did add extra garlic and some onion salt as well just to kick it up a bit. I also used a canned medium chili sauce and cooked on low heat for 5 hours, it was super juicy!

I would have given this a four, but the other three people in the house said a soild 5.  It was really good exactly as written.  We did not make put it on bread.   I used a crock pot on low for about 4 hours and then high for about 1 1/2 hours.  Thanks.

I would have given this four stars, but my wife thought it was a three at best, so I split the difference. She thought it was too sweet, even though I cut the sugar in half. Might try it again and leave the sugar out entirely.

I think the "chili Sauce" in this recipe refers to a sauce that comes in a bottle (Heinz) and not the type of chili sauce that one would use for hot dogs. That would make a big difference in the outcome of this recipe.  The bottled sauce is more like ketchup or seafood sauce than chili.

I rarely eat red meat but I did try some of this and it was very tasty and spicy.  I cooked this in the crockpot and it was very tender and shredded easily. I served this on toasted hamburger buns and my guys really enjoyed this meal.

I make this in my slow cooker on low for 6 hours, turning the roast over every 2 hours.   The roast was pretty easy to shred.   After I shredded it I poured the liquid/sauce on the meat the served on buns.  Delicious flavor!   Trust me, it's not too much of a chili flavor.

This was good, but needed more zip (go heavier on the spices).

Found this recipe to be flavorful and easy.  The only change I made was  since I had a 6 lb. roast, I used the whole bottle of standard sized Heinz chili sauce. My family enjoyed it and I will make it again!

We loved this recipe with some tweaking. Thanks for the suggestions for using a Crock-Pot and adding extra spices. I look at recipes as a guide and not an absolute. We all have different tastes and preferences and I love to read everyone's reviews. I added sauted diced onions and green peppers to the sauce, as well as, ground Anchio Chile pepper and ground  chipotle pepper. It provided a little extra kick and another layer of flavor to this delicious recipe! Thanks for sharing!

Made it with a top serloin roast  and only change was cut back a little on the sugar.  It was very good.  Will make it again.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.

I made this last night, my husband liked it, but said it needed to be spiced up more, I did not care for it. To me it tasted like Manwich.  If I ever make this again I will definitely cut down on the vinegar maybe even omit it altogether. The only reason I gave this a 3 is because my Husband liked it. Today he made a burrito with it and added some hot sauce and sharp cheddar cheese to it and he liked it even more.

I always follow the recipe the first time I make a dish unless it is clearly obvious to me there would be an issue, so having followed the recipe, it is extremely doubtful I will make this again as it just wasn't tasty enough for the cost of the beef and the other ingredients.  To my family, the chili powder overwhelmed the sauce.  I believe you could achieve the same end with a better barbeque sauce.

I put this in the slow cooker and it was great. I love the idea of refrigerating the meat and then slicing it because it was very easy to cut off the fat. As the meat cooled so did the sauce and was able then to scoop the fat off the top. I placed the sliced beef on toasted bread drizzled with sauce and served with mashed potatoes and fresh squash, muy bueno!
