I didn't make the rice, but the chicken mole came out great! I used chicken tenders, 2 cloves garlic, diced tomatoes with jalape√±os and 2t chili powder. After tasting it, I modified it by adding 1T honey and an extra 1T cocoa to give it a darker color and more chocolaty taste. This made it perfectly seasoned and flavorful! It made a ton of food, but I will be making it again!

Wonderful mole. I added extra chili powder (some chipolte too), extra dark cocoa, brown sugar (to sweeten it up a bit) and some cornstarch to thicken it.  Excellent!

Very Excellent!! Would make this again and again. Everyone loved it. I was afraid it would taste chocolaty or peanut buttery but it was just perfect. Served it over the cilantro rice. Did not change a thing.

Had this dish at a party and it was delish!  The flavor is not too overpowering, just right.  The hint of peanut butter in the sauce is what makes this dish!

I have been looking for a peanut mole recipe and this is so simple and delicious! The rice is also super easy and surprisingly yummy! We like the mole with tortillas and the rice on the side best. It has become a family favorite!

Not as good as my favorite restaurant, but tasty.  I think next time, I'll use more chili powder, less cinnamon.  But, fast and easy!

This is a good recipe.  Just not a great one.  After the initial mole.  I modified it by adding 1/4 cup of cocoa, 1/2 cup of peanut butter, 3 tablespoons of sugar, and 1/4 teaspoon of salt.  After these additions, it tasted much better but note that it was quite sweet, but had a lovely peanuty chocolate flavor.  I want to try it by reducing the amount of sugar a bit and upping the garlic to make it more savory as well.

Very very bland.  Even after doubling the chili powder and adding cayenne, this recipe just didn't have much flavor.  :-(  I was very disappointed.  I made this for company and although they all said it was good, I noticed that no one went back for seconds and some even left it on their plate. Ouch.

So so delicious! I didn't have any chili powder so I just used paprika.  And instead of chicken I diced up some extra firm tofu and fried that in the oil until it was crispy and looked like croutons.  Then I set that aside and did the mole and rice as listed (subbing paprika for chili powder and perhaps a bit generous on the PB) and stirred the tofu squares back in.  Amazing!!  Couldn't stop refilling my plate!  Don't skip the rice.  We used regular rice, not instant, and made 4 cups cooked.  The sweet cool orange flavor is incredible with the rich chocolate/PB/spice.

Very simple and tasty. I usually don't like mole from Mexican restaurants in the US but had some in MX and decided to try my own. Put in a bit extra of the chilli pepper, but it still was yummy.

This was really tasty! I didn't know if I'd like some of the ingredients together. Peanut butter and tomatoes!?? But the sauce was delicious. No one would be able to tell the secret ingredient. I pureed the sauce after cooking. The rice was so good probably my favorite part. It was very good with the chicken and sauce.

Absolutely delicious! I've been looking for a good recipe for Mole and this will be my go to recipe.
I think a more sophisticated palate is required to appreciate this recipe. Even my kids loved it, but we are adventuress in the kitchen.

Pretty good. My wife is pretty picky and we both enjoyed it. Be aware this review is mostly for just the sauce. I didn't make the rice. It didn't sound good. I made my standby cilantro rice. My wife made her basic chicken asada that we simmered in the sauce. The only thing about the sauce that i had to change is that i had a 10oz can of diced tomatoes & green chilies instead of a 14.5 oz can. Definitely will make it again. I can see the sauce being good for a variety of things. Maybe pork, maybe a burrito...

The mole was pretty good and I'd rate about 4 starts. I don't know if I'd make it again, though it's possible. The rice was more like 2 starts. No one at our table really liked it. I will say, mixing the mole and rice in however you're using the mole tastes better than alone.  We used the recipe for mole enchiladas.

WOW this was the best Mole I have ever had! It has great flavor without being really greasy, which I find when I order it at a restaurant. I used all breasts because that's what I had on hand, and not being a huge fan of onion I kept out the 1c chopped and added a generous helping of the dehydrated kind, maybe 2-3 tbsp. I also don't like chili powder and don't even keep it in the house, so I just added dried red pepper to the spiciness we would enjoy. All my changes were preference, this would be a fantastic dish with no changes. I didn't make the cilantro rice either, just heated up some brown rice and served with some roasted veggies in tortillas; it was a healthy, filling, and fresh meal. Thanks so much for submitting, this will be a regular!

I went off of the basic recipe but instead of using individual spices...I used curry powder, chili powder and minced garlic. I also added a dash of cayenne pepper per a suggestion and it was wonderful! Will make this again for sure!

This was really good and fairly easy.  I had to sub Wegman's medium pineapple salsa for the tomatoes and peppers, and it worked great.  I used chicken boullion instead of broth, and that also worked perfectly.  We really liked this.  The rice-  the marmalade is just a so-so addition, imo.  Still pretty good though.  We'll probably make this again.

This tasted very different.  It was ok, I will probably not make again.  The rice was actually our favorite part.  The chicken would probably taste better if it was shredded and you added some seasoning to it while it was cooking.  The chicken itself was pretty bland.  Might be better if you took the time to mess around with it.

I made this and loved it! It looks a bit odd because I pureed the tomatoes. But the flavor was good. I also used apricot jam instead of orange marmalade in the rice. Which was also very good.
