I think a little less mayo, and a little more sour cream would fit my palet better

This was pretty good.  It was lacking in color and so maybe an invitation to eat it because of that.  But it was good.  I think maybe I'm not a fan of Beau Monde and so will make this next time with a different seasoned salt and the whole green onion!  Kate, I'm pretty sure my mom used to make something very similar to this, too!  Thanks for the reminder!
