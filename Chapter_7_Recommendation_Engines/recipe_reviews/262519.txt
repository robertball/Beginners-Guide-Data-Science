Always a hit! You can just eyeball it and not use exact measurements... super easy to make. I use ranch dressing instead of sour cream but either way is delicious.

I heated mine in the microwave and put it in a crockpot.  Tasty treat.  I also used nonfat greek yogurt instead of sour cream no one knew the difference.

I forgot to cover mine, and it was fine, so no need to waste foil if you don't want to. We really liked this dip. The garlic really added extra flavor. The only thing I was missing was some blue cheese, so next time I'll top the warmed dip with some blue cheese dressing.
