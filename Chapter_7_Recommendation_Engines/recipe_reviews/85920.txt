I will admit that I didn't fry these. I used all the same ingredients (subbed dried cilantro), but instead diced the potatoes and shook them and the spices up in a bag with oil. Then, I baked them for an hour at 350. These were good, but too much black pepper so I ended up not eating much of them. I would try these the fried way, or bake them again, but I'd lessen the spices some. They were better with ketchup.

Based on the previous review, I used only half of the black pepper and these were very good. We dipped them in Curry Ketchup which was fantastic(found in European grocery).

These were good.  I ended up doubling the number of potatos to balance the overwhelming flavors, but the spices were still very intense.  I would have preferred a milder flavor.  I served them with a sweet and sour sauce, which balanced a little of the flavor, but ended up liking them better the next day when I ate them with ketchup!

These are absolutey delicious! My family, including a 6-year-old, enjoyed them enough to declare that we should have them again. Because of the other reviews, I put half the amount of both the garam masala and coriander powder. I put in enough salt and pepper "to taste".  The ketchup really made these sing! Bridle, thank you so much for this recipe. It's exactly what I was craving.

I am very glad I didn't put 2 Tbs. of black pepper into this. It was the only change I made. My biggest complaint is that when you pan fry these, the sides remain uncooked if you make the patties the prescribed 1" thick. They work great if you make them between 1/2" to 1/4" thick. The thick ones tended to have their crispy tops slide off. They were very tasty, although for personal preference I will cut back on both the garam masala and the ground coriander. Two Tbs. of each is too much for me. It did go well with the cucumber and black bean salad and the peanut marinated chicken thighs. These are worth experimenting with.

They are pretty good.  If I make them again I might try and see what else I can put in them though.  Also, don't use garam masala with salt already in it!  lol  I put 2 teaspoons of salt instead of 2 tablespoons, but forgot about the salt in my garam masala so it turned out too salty anyway.  That's my fault though.  lol
