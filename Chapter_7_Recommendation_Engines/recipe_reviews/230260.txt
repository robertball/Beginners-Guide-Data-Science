I've made this three times now and differently each time. Also successful each time. The first time I omitted the zest and used 1 cup bread flour and 1 regular. By the time I added everything I found the dough to be so sticky I began adding hand fulls of flour till I was able to roll it into log form without the use of grease. That's just my preference. As for baking time I left it in a bit longer till golden in color, again preference. 

The second time, the same flour amounts but added a pinch of cardamom and used Himalayan rock salt, the nuts I did half almonds and half pecans, the rest the same as first time. 

Third time, used all bread flour, same nut combo and same salt.  

I also added a cup of chocolate chips in each batch. I like the consistency of the half and half dough the best but wouldn't go out of my way to buy bread flour for just this.  My favorite is the second one with the cardamom.

I didn't use any zest, but added a teaspoon of lemon juice. I used splenda brown sugar blend instead of other brown sugar. I didn't use almond extract, I used 2 cups of sliced almonds. I need to separate the batch (for 24 servings) into 4 batches instead of 2. It turned out really well.
