I tried this and it really worked. I didn't have Dijon mustard or breadcrumbs so I used 1 tbsp of regular French's mustard and I had a bag of tortilla sweet potato chips which I crushed into "bread crumbs". It added such a unique and tasty flavour. They were juicy and wonderful. I also grilled pineapple slices and fried some turkey bacon, added it to the burger. It was amazing! Didn't even need condiments. :)

Delicious! I followed the burger recipe to a T - they were juicy and had a great flavor and held together very well. I omitted the pancetta this time because I didn't have any on hand, but will have to try sometime cause it sounds amazing.

Definitely will be making again and will probably be my default burger recipe.

I also had them on homemade burger buns - well worth the extra work!

Created, and posted! These were too tasty not to make again! 
I turned them into little sliders, about 50 grams each for the patties or 100 grams for regular burgers.

This was my first attempt at making my own burgers.  I did not have dijon mustard, so I used the siracha mustard on hand.  Wow!  The burgers were juicy and flavorful.  I may never buy frozen patties again!

My family loved the burgers. We are not one for eating beef burgers so we tried all the same ingredients with minced turkey instead. Burgers were juicy and tasted amazing. The best burger we have had so far. We are making them again tonight.

This was an AMAZINGLY recipe! I loved it so so much, we did t have shallots so we used onions instead. We also didn’t have enough Dijon mustard so we used only the amount we had left! With all of this the recipe still turned out amazing

I loved making this burger. I did make my on mayo mustard sauce for it!! I sautéed my onions and grilled my buns. My best friend loved this burger.. It’s okay to deviate from this recipe to create your own special creation.. Happy grilling   5 stars
