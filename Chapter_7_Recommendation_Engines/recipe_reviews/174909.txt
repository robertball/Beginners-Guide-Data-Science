Nice brownie, but not as thick as I would like.  I think this would be perfect in a 9x9" or 11x7" pan.  These are chewy and fudgey both, and intensely chocolate, calling for more cocoa powder than most other recipes.  I also liked  the brown sugar in the recipe. The caramel swirl chips might be hard to find but to be honest I think semisweet chocolate chips would be better anyway! For the caramel sauce I just melted some caramels with a little water.  Definitely worth a repeat!

these were a hit at our new years day dinner.  as a warning to you, the batter will be very thick.  there is no pouring this stuff.  but it turns out very fudgy.
i could not find the swirled morsels, but my supermarket did have caramel baking pieces.  i used those as a substitute along with regular chocolate chips.  this is best served warm with vanilla ice cream.

Nice rich chocolate taste...texture is moist and chewy.  One of the best brownie recipes that I have found.
