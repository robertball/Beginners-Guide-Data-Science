I tried three batches of this recipe. I believe there is an issue with the wet/dry ingredients ratio. I tried augmenting the coconut flour in one batch, it burned. I tried adding more coconut milk, mush. I even tried making it like a dough and it was inedible. I was unable to make this recipe as it is written. Thank you cjcuppycake, most of your other recipes have worked well for me, just not this one.
