These were good, but I thought it needed a little more flavor...I did add a few things. I first sauted a little bacon until the fat was gone with thinly sliced wedges of purple onion, drained the grease.  I then added the pine nuts, green beans a little olive oil and a few tablespoons of balsamic vinegar.  This was excellent.

This is a great recipe, quick to make and very classy.  I used frozen green beans and sauteed them with the garlic and pine nuts instead of boiling first.  I thought they had a great, nutty flavor from the garlic, and my father-in-law kept raving about the pine nuts.

This is the best green bean recipe I ever used. Everything in it was my husbands favorite...The garlic and the pinenuts.  I always keep pinenuts in a sealed container in my freezer, to add to the flavor of many recipes. I seasoned the hot beans in the strainer, before adding them to the garlic and pinenuts. The green beans retained their color  and looked lovely besides tasting wonderful.  Thank you for a great recipe. Nancy

These were awesome, and so simple to make. I used  frozen green beans, two garlic cloves and slivered almonds instead of pine nuts. My husband who hates green beans tried them, and said he loved it and wanted me to make them again!!! Thanks for the great recipe

Loved the recipe, a nice fresh twist!  Thanks for sharing.  If you don't have Pine Nuts, you can use slivered almonds also.

I'm not sure why this dish is rated so high, because we found it very blah.  One Tbsp olive oil is not enough oil for 1 pound of beans.  1 clove of garlic is not enough garlic and the pine nuts (even though chopped) do not cling to the beans...they just sit in the bottom of the pan.  Unfortunately, it is not likely that I will make again.

I love green beans, and wanted an easy recipe that can be made easily when entertaining.  This is very easy and comes out very good.  I always make any recipe exactly as written the first time, then I start my experimenting later.  I did find that a sprinkling of grated parmesan cheese made this dish really shine. I also tried it with bacon bits, but I liked the cheest better.

Very Good!  I used frozen green beans that I boiled for about 10 minutes first.  I used a little more garlic and threw the beans in with the garlic/pine nuts/oil for a couple minutes. They had great flavor and a different twist to a great side dish!

Frankly, upon first glance, I thought this dish would be bland! But I was sooo wrong! The S&P and fresh garlic flavored the green beans so wonderfully - they were delicious! I used frozen green beans and used slivered toasted almonds because that's what I had on hand, but my, my, my! What a wonderful dish! My husband loved them and so did I! Will be making these again!

Very good, very simple and quick.  I found I had to cook the beans for twice as long to get them tender. I also added some roasted radishes (roasted 15 minutes at 450, with olive oil, salt, and pepper) to toss in with the green beans for a nice side salad.

Delicious!!!! I used frozen green beans and it came out just great. I then made the recipe again a few nights later using frozen broccoli and cauliflower and that too was incredible. Thanks for sharing this recipe, a definite keeper.

Really good way to dress up green beans without a lot of fuss & fancy ingredients.  I opted to use slivered almonds as suggested by another rater.  This is definitely going to be a repeat on my table!

Good simple green bean recipe. Livened them up, and makes a great side dish. Remember to toast the pine nuts, makes a big difference in flavour.

This was quick, easy and "classy", but not very exciting. Still, it tastes good and I guess that's the bottom line.
I read someone's review of this recipe indicating that the pine nuts were left in the pot instead of in their stomach so I tried blending them with a hand blender so they would stick to the beans and this worked well. It was like I used bread crumbs. Anyway, it turned out good, try it.

Five stars for being simple and delicious.  I suggest using butter instead of olive oil-- the pine nuts and garlic clung nicely to the frozen beans as I sauteed them together.  After a few minutes to sit, they almost looked breaded!

Even the guests who didn't like green beans came back for seconds.  In fact, it was as popular as the entree.

Excellent!

Pretty, good. I think maybe needed more garlic and I followed the cooking time and my beans werent quite tender enough, but everyone at my Christmas Eve table loved them, especially the pine nuts.

Pretty good, gave it a squeeze of lemon for more flavor.  Pine nuts are so expensive and just did not add enough to the dish to justify using them again.

This was a lovely, simple recipe that looked fancier on the table than the effort required. I did add a sprinkle of fresh lemon juice that went very nicely with the fresh flavors. I think it actually needed that extra little zing.

I used fresh garlic, I think it would have been "blah" w/o fresh garlic. Chopped the pine nuts for a few seconds in processor. Butter sounds like a good idea to get the nuts to stick on more I will try that next time. Tasty, but I wouldn't say it 'has that amazing something' maybe I'll try adding a touch of balsamic next time ?

This was very good! I added shallots to the garlic as some suggested. Simple and elegant! UPDATE! I made these again for a picky 18 year old and he loved them! Yesterday I used broccoli and cashews and am going to try asparagus and almonds. This is my new "go to" vegetable recipe!! Thank you!

Very easy, elegant, and even my picky 6 year old ate every bite!  I steamed frozen whole green beans and added them to the garlic/pine nut mixture.  The only addition I used was a few dashes of seasoned salt, to add a bit more garlic flavor to the dish.  A keeper for our family~

I loved the fact that there was a basic recipe provided for me which I could alter to fit the theme I had going for my meal.  Here's what I did:  Instead of olive oil, I used canola oil.  Instead of hazelnuts, I used chopped roasted almonds since I had them on hand.  After they were finished cooking, I squeezed lemon juice over them and topped them with a small dusting of grated Parmesan cheese.  I served them with blackened chicken with lemon juice and brown rice.  

Next time, I will follow the recipe exactly because it's simple and I think it will be delicious!

Great concept.  I changed it to fit my tastes though.  I added a lot more garlic, and used flavored sliced almonds instead of pine nuts.  The beans also have to cook a lot longer than 5 minutes.  I would say more like 10-15 minutes.  When serving I add salt and pepper to taste and sprinkle with grated parmesan cheese.  
With my modifications in place this is my new favorite recipe for fresh green beans.

Love these green beans!  
I steam my beans instead of boiling them.  Also, sometimes I like to use shallots instead of the garlic.  About 2 tbsp. diced.  They are always a hit in my house!

I tried this recipe tonight to serve with a Chicken and Dressing casserole.  I thought that the dish needed a little more seasoning.  I have a simlar green bean recipe and I used oregano and basil along with the garlic and almonds.  I liked the pine nuts, so in the future I would add some oregano and it could easily be a 4 star.  Nice presentation.  Thanks for sharing.

Love these.  I saute the beans with a touch of olive oil, salt & pepper.  Once they are slightly soft, I add a TON of (homemade) roasted garlic & pine nuts.  Cook for a few more minutes & serve.  They are wonderful!

Normally I love pine nuts, and I found the 1/4 of a cup to be an overpowering flavor.  This recipe was a disappointment.

Great recipe. I had to cook the beans a little longer (maybe 4 minutes more) to make them a little softer. I used slivered almonds, instead of pine nuts, and it was good. Will definitely make this again.

I served these beans for Christmas dinner.  They were excellent.  For those of you with kids, my five year old ate ALL the leftovers.  I will definately serve these again. The only thing I did differently was cook the beans for 15 minutes instead of 5.  We like green beans with a softer texture, but that is purely a matter of preference.

They were great.  I added 1/3cup pine nuts and cooked the green beans 7 minutes and then submerged them in cold water to stop the cooking before adding the oil mixture.  Seasoned with salt and pepper.

I've looke all over for this recipe - we used it at our Italian family Christmas party - as we were all tired of green beans with tomotoes.  This has been a nice addittion to our menue.  However, I do add soy sauce and sometimes either worsteshire or terriyaki while cooking - adds a nice flavor.

This was not bad.  I was hoping for more flavor.  I used slivered almonds because that's what I had on hand.  I'll probably keep searching for another recipe using green beans and almonds.

This has become my favorite way to prepare green beans, and had to go into my recipe book.  Prepared plain is healthier, so I wouldn't make this all the time because of the added fat, but this way is much more interesting for a 'special occasion', and I just love garlic and pine nuts.

Pretty good...has a very subtle flavor and is very easy to make.  I steamed the beans in a steamer and then just tossed with the heated ingredients.  It would probably be good with some crumbled bacon thrown in too.

These are wonderful!  We like garlic, so I added more than the recipe calls for.  So easy, too.

Quick and delicious. I have also made with slivered almonds instead of pine nuts.

This was so delicious and so simple!  I used frozen fancy cut green beans and it turned out great!  This dish looks like you spent a lot of time on it.  Perfect for a special occasion.

Nice and simple. I used crushed pecans b/c I had them on hand. Be careful not to burn the nuts like I did! I boiled the beans like the recipe called for, but I have made a similiar recipe where you sautee the beans in the olive oil instead of boiling. It takes great both ways.
