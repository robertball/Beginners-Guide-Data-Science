Amazing! What a perfect blend of flavors. I wansn't sure about the bbq sauce but it worked perfect. If you are looking for a great bloody mary mix this is it.

Thanks to bd.weld, I just made this.  Delicious!  I was going to add in some vodka, but after one sip to adjust my seasonings, I couldn't wait for the booze.  I just drank it as is. Simply delicious!  Sorry no photo and I think you know why!  It's already gone!  lol

This was exactly what I wanted. It's a savory bloody Mary, not a spicy one (depending on how much cayenne you add). 

Two recommendations: 1) make sure to purchase low sodium tomatoe juice,  2) put only 1/2 tsp  garlic salt in at first, then add more as desired. I did this in response to a reviewer not wanting the garlic salt at all. I also put in about 1 tsp onion powder and it was great. Very delicious! I agree with the chef, vodka is optional with all these flavors :)

This was way too spicy, even for my spice loving husband. I may try again and reduce the pepper. Thanks!

This mix is amazeballs!  I used Sriracha instead of cayenne. Perfect kick as far as I'm concerned. And I left out the garlic salt since the steak sauce I used (Lea & Perrins Worcestershire Sauce) already has garlic.

This is super delicious! I love the savory flavor. I think the steak sauce (I used A1) makes it.  It's not spicy, and I'm confused how anyone could say it is? Esp when they say they are spice-loving? If possible, don't skip on the fresh lemon wedges, they really make a wonderful difference. I didn't even add the alcohol. This drink is stands on its own. Make the recipe as written, and you will not be disappointed! It is Awesome!

Great variation to the standard Bloody Mary Mix. I kicked it up a notch with 1/2 TSP of Cayenne but it's good to start with the original recipe and adjust the heat to your own taste as you go. Next batch I may add a little lime juice as well.

I had some low-sodium V8 in the fridge that needed using up, so I scaled this to 1 serving just to try it out. I eyeballed most of the ingredients, and, yeah, WOW!! This is definitely a contender for World’s Best. Honestly, I am missing the zing of a little horseradish, but other than that it’s a great start. I used celery salt and garlic powder instead of garlic salt and celery seed because that’s what I had on hand. I also added onion powder, Penzey’s California Pepper blend instead of straight-up black pepper, and a splash or two of Frank’s RedHot sauce. The bbq sauce added a great smoky sweet touch. Mm-mmmm! Two buzzed Wisconsinite thumbs way up!

This Bloody Mary mix is good. A little thick tho. I was skeptical about the BBQ sauce but it worked. Tasted better than the old Worcestershire sauce with plain tomato juice. Still prefer Clamato!

It was ok. I started with V8, but it might have been better with plain tomato juice.

Gave this recipe a shot (well, without the shot of vodka) and it was a winner. Skeptical about the BBQ sauce, but other reviews persuaded me. Very tasty!

It was very tasty, but I left out the garlic salt. I don't recommend adding that one ingredient.
