Chef John is amazing!  I always try his recipes because, just plain fact, they are always the best!  Followed this recipe to the letter and it was exquisite.  My husband, who is not crazy for cauliflower, asked for seconds.  He said it was the best soup I've ever made.  Thank you, Chef John, for making me a heroine in my own dining room!

I only made the soup - I was looking to use up some cauliflower. The soup was really good. I topped it off with some crumbled bacon and some parmesan cheese, which was delicious. Next time, I'll try it with the fritters.

really liked the soup, smooth and creamy.  Didn't make the fritters, but good with some cheese sprinkled on top, some bacon crumbled would be fantastic

I have tried several of Chef Johns recipes they are wonderful.  I follow the recipes with no deviation because they are perfect.    The fritters gave the soup that little extra.

So easy to make and tastes great!  I used half and half because I didnâ€™t have heavy cream.

This is a review just for the soup since I didn't make the blue cheese fritters. 

The soup was tasty, very smooth flavor that goes well with a slice or two of baguette bread. My family and I enjoyed it as a side to roasted chicken. It is simple, not the best soup I've ever had but good and filling. I think its a kid friendly recipe. I followed the exact recipe, just added a little bit of grated mozzarella cheese at the end. It didn't alter the flavor at all. 

I will make it again.

The only thing I didn't follow was the use of an immersion blender (because I didn't have one).  Hubby had a few bites and stopped.  I thought the fritters were great but the soup was lacking something...I may try again and add sharp cheddar and bacon.

I am rating the soup without the fritters.  It's fantastic. My children loved it so much, they wiped their bowl with some bread..
You really don't need the fritters and the extra work they add to the recipe.

Four and 1/2 stars as written. We really liked the fritters with the soup also. Just thought something was missing in those bites without the fritters so added freshly shredded cheddar and leftover diced ham. Definitely will make again, maybe pepper jack fritters or shredded p/j and a dose of Worchestershire.
