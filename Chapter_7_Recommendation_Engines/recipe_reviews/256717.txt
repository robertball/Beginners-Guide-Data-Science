I followed the recipe as shown other than I didn't grate my own cheese. I used a package of finely shredded cheese. It didn't come out anything like the picture. It was good but not as creamy as I was hoping for. It also needs a small crock pot to keep it warm and not turn into a stiff mass of cheese needing a microwave every few minutes. The packaged cheese may have caused my issue. I'd make it again but will modify to make it more creamy.
