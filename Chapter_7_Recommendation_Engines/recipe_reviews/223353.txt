I love courgette fritters (I'm British). I let my courgette drain in a colander or even a sieve for up to an hour then just squeeze excess water out with my hands.
It's such an easy recipe and tastes delicious plus they're very filling when you're hungry. I also like to experiment with herbs and spices and this is good with chopped green or red chilli; fresh chives; mint and parsley.

I'm low-carbin' it and thought I'd try these for a different breakfast.  They are deliciously savory.  I put the zucchini in a thin cotton towel in the colander, salt it and then wring out the liquid.  I added extra parmesan and used minced red onions.  FABULOUS!!  I'll be making these again.

YUM YUM!!!  I was so worried these wouldn't hold because there was no way of making these into patties by hand.  They were to goopy.  Anyway so I just spooned it into the pan shaped it as well as a I could and hoped it would hold.  They flipped beautifully!  Tasted good too!  Thanks!

This reciepe was AMAZING. I would serve this to the Queen.  Followed all the directions to a T. The more you squeeze out the liquid from the veg the better. I am on a low carb diet and am extremely picky about my food and this was THE BOMB. I make my own full fat Greek yogurt and a little dollop set this pancake into outerspace. I used Parmesano Reggiano and all homegrown ingredients. Good ingredients=Good food. Served this with roasted chicken and heirloom tomatoes salad with balsamic vinegar red wine vinegar and olive oil.

Wonderful flavor! Can also be frozen and reheated either in a frying pan or microwave.  One tip:  I was trying to figure out how to make these for a crowd, but the salting, draining, etc. was just too much work.  I put the shredded zucchini in my dehydrator for an hour at 125 degrees.  Perfect solution!

Nommy. They tasted super good. I didn't take the time to properly drain the zucchini because I don't have any paper towels at the moment (I also excluded the onion powder because I don't have any of that either.) 

If you properly drain them, they will hold together better, probably.

We were impressed! My husband said 'best zucchini he ever had'. We eat diabetic friendly, and I have lots of zucchini in the garden. Even my boys thought it was 'edible'. This is easy to make as the Zucchini is easy to shred, getting the water out of it was the difficult part. I didn't have basil leaves, and I used shredded Mexican blend cheese, but I kept everything else the same. I noticed it took longer to cook on each side than stated, but that was probably because of the water content.

Delicious, followed the recipe exactly and it was perfect.  I scaled it down for 1 serving too and it worked well. Thinking about adding crab to see if you could make crab cakes with this recipe. If I do I'll repost  and tell how it came out.

I thought this was a clever low-carb breakfast. I couldn't get the patties to stick together so I threw it all in the pan together and I loved how it turned out! I thought they tasted almost like hashbrowns so I ate it with ketchup too. I will be making these again!

Great recipe for summer zucchini, and more filling than you would expect.  Used half the parmesan but probably would have been better with the called for amount.

Great Recipe! I used half the ingredients, and it was just the right amount for one person. I salted them and let them sit for only 10 Minutes before squeezing out the water, and they held together perfectly. 
They also taste great with a Cucumber-Yoghurt-Dip!

I make a similar recipe, but add Old Bay Seasoning and also bread crumbs to give it shape. I do not use basil or nutmeg and then flour the cakes and fry in oil. They taste like crab cakes!

3 out of 4 of us enjoyed these....I used regular onion instead of green and ran the onion and garlic through the food processor with the zucchini....loved the low carb aspect....but I found them kinda hard to stay together while cooking and flipping....I did add a few tablespoons of corn meal to "tighten" them up a bit....thanks!

I found it very difficult to get all the moisture out.  Zucchini everywhere, 45 minutes and 1/2 roll of paper towels later, the 'batter' was still runny.  So I dropped them by tablespoons onto the hot griddle.   Cooked them 3-4 minutes and then carefully flipped them.  
That being said, the flavor is wonderful!  Very fresh, small hint of Parmesan, spices.  Very very good.  
Next time I may try my salad spinner?

I made it exactly as written and it is delicious.  I'm starting a low carb diet and haven't ever cared for zucchini.  HOWEVER, this really changed my mind.  I used my ricer to get the moisture out of the zucchini and it worked perfectly. I will use this as a breakfast staple for sure!

This was delicious. However I used 2 large zucchinis and that was too much for just eggs. I had to add more eggs. I will definitely make again but I will dry zucchini out more

I really liked these pancakes. They held together well in the pan and flipped with no problems. I didn't have any basil, so I added some Italian seasoning. My husband and daughter loved them. I wonder if anyone has made these with egg whites instead of whole eggs. Just thinking of a way to lower the cholesterol. I will make these for breakfast with eggs and morning star sausages. Yummm

I have a very similar recipe, that I serve as a side dish.  The only difference is I use 2 TBSP of soy protein for binding and add feta cheese instead of parmesan.

Sorry, just made these. I have one large, flat pancake. Couldn't get the to become individual pancakes. Too much liquid. Drained in frig or an hour, but still too moist. Even tried some corn flour to dry to dry it out, but no luck.

Good taste, just couldn't get the pancake thing down.  It ended up being more like a scramble than a pancake.  I did tweak the ingredients though and perhaps there was not enough egg, or there could have been too much moisture in the zucchini still.  Will have to try again.

Nice flavor. I halved the recipe the first time I’ve made it just in case.  I used garlic powder instead of fresh garlic which I don’t believe made a big difference. I enjoyed the flavor and love that they are low carb but they were soggy.  Would be a nice alternative to potato hash browns. Light bulb!
