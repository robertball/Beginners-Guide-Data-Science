This was so easy to make and taste so good! However, you do need to add some extra seasonings. I added salt, pepper, garlic powder, and grated parmesan cheese. Be sure to take the pot off the heat once the pasta is done because it will keep cooking. I forgot and ended up with some pretty big pasta shells in my soup. I will definitely be making this again! Thanks for a great recipe Dawn!

I made this recipe last year and couldnt wait for winter so I could make it again.  This is the easiest soup recipe you will find!! And it is delicious!! I made it with elbow macaroni and it was awesome.  I also used a frozen bag of vegetables with broccoli, cauliflower, lima beans, and peas.  Great recipe! I will keep making it and using it every winter!!

This was so quick and filling. I had some rump roast on hand so I subbed about half the water for beef broth and threw in ~1.5 lbs of the meat, cut into soup-sized chunks. I followed the rest of the recipe as directed and The Man was amazed I had such a great soup so quickly. I will definitely make this again, thanks so much for sharing!

This was very easy to make, and my family loved it! I used italian style spaghetti sauce instead of plain sauce. Instead of frozen or canned vegetables, I used the fresh veggies that were in my fridge: celery, carrots, and green onions. I also used dry organic alphabet vegetable pasta. The result was wonderful, but after the leftover soup stood for a while, the pasta absorbed more water and the soup thickened considerably. I didn't put even close to the reccomended 8oz. Haha. next time I'll try putting much less pasta in. It's a work in progress ;)

This does need some spicing up, but it's still tasty and sooooo easy. The ingredients list calls for tomato sauce, but in the directions it says spaghetti sauce, so maybe the submitter meant spaghetti sauce which would have more seasonings than tomato sauce. I added garlic powder, parsley and salt and pepper. I had some already cooked elbow macarooni and an openned jar of tomato sauce, making this recipe so quick to make.

I was not a fan of the pasta in this as it became mushy if the soup was reheated a day or two later.  I also do not like frozen veggies in this so I substituted with 2 large cans of veg-all and I added barley in place of the pasta and thought it was much better.  Easy overall recipe and very filling.  Would still recommend it as is to those less picky about their veggies.

This soup was good, though a little bland. I used spaghetti sauce since the description and procedure listed it as opposed to just one mention of tomato sauce in the ingredients list.

I loved how easy this was.  I used spaghetti sauce and added a 1/2 cup of frozen spinach to the mixed veggies.  Because others said it was lacking spice I did sauteed a clove of fresh garlic in olive oil and then added the called for ingredients- to the pot went 1 tsp salt, 5 dashes hot sauce, 1 tsp oregano and 2 tsp sugar.  Ihad no idea how easy this could be... THANKS FOR THE RECIPE Dawn!

This is one of my favorite soups and this recipe is very easy.  I didn't have any tomato sauce so I used a can of stewed tomatoes and I also added potatoes and let it simmer on the stove for about 45 minutes.  My family loved it!

This is 1 of those recipes where using tomato sauce (as called for) makes a big difference over using other tomato products.  As others have reviewed, we used much less pasta (total ½ c).  The soup was good but we’ve made better from this site (Between 3 - 4 stars).

This was very good - and so easy! I used Classico tomato and basil spaghetti sauce. Instead of 6 cups water, I used 3 cups chicken broth and 3 cups water. I also boiled a chicken breast before hand and shredded it and added to the soup about 5 minutes before it was ready. Light and tasty soup! Will definitley make again!

Nice little recipe that is a lot of fun to tweak and make your own.  My favorite so far is adding chopped ham and 3/4 cup of barley.

Wonderful recipe! I added a few extra items...black beans, a little bit of italian seasoning, a dash of hot sauce,a bit of garlic and onion powders and I like my soups thick so I added some cornstarch. It is an absolutely wonderful recipe, super easy and was ready to go by the time my grilled chicken was finished! I'll definitely be making this again!

I just made this tonight as a quick and healthier alternative to canned soup for my kids. I did embellish it some, by sauting some onion and garlic in butter and then adding the ingredients and then topped it off with some salt and pepper. The conclusion"  3 out of 4 of my kids ate their entire serving without complaint, 2 went back for seconds. By the way, the one who wasn't impressed, generally refuses any food that is not white or pure sugar.

I would rate this 5 stars for the ease of preparation but as for taste, nobody here would rate it above a 3 (and I live with a bunch of soup-nuts). It took me all of 3 minutes to put together, which I appreciated, since I was on my way out the door to work. I served it with thick slices of garlic toast to dip ~ that was my favorite part. Thanks Dawn.

Everyone loves my mom's vegetable soup and I wanted to make it too. This recipe is perfect. I use canned vegetables and about a cup of macaroni pasta. I double the water and pasta sauce too to make a lot at once. Also I cook in a couple of chicken breasts, cut up pretty small. Very filling and last me and my boyfriend a couple days.

This tasted fine with lots of crackers on top.  My family and I did not like it - too bland.
