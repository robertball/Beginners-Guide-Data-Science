Several things to mention:  Since S'Mores MUST include graham crackers, I replaced 1/2 cup of the flour with 1/2 cup graham cracker crumbs.  Spreading the batter in the pan is a mucky job, but ultimately it's worth it.  I chose to broil the marshmallows until lightly browned, which only takes about 40 seconds in my oven--unfortunately, on my first try I let them sit for about a minute and a half--hey, at least I know my smoke detector works. . .  Finally, these are not by any means an elegant or sophisticated bar--but kids positively inhale them!  They are ooey, gooey, sticky delicious fun--I should know, I've certainly eaten my share today.

my trick now for most squares, etc, is to make them in muffin papers. saves having to cut them apart, everyone gets the same size (yep with kids that matters).  i just used my small scoop and put into the papers.  I also swapped out part of the flour for graham crumbs, it really makes a difference.  i used chocolate chips (not bars) as that is what I had on hand.  I doubled the recipe and made 36 individual bars....yum!  definitely on my make again list.

This was great, and really easy. The hardest part is cutting throuh the gooey marshmallow. I substituted 3/4 graham crumbs for half of the flour. You can't have smores without graham crackers. These are great warm with vanilla ice cream

My family absolutely LOVED these!  Like another reviewer said, they aren't about presentation,  but are very yummy!  I omitted the peanuts, but next time I'll add them.  I also used 3/4 flour & 3/4 crushed grahm crackers.  These are a keeper!

Th chocolate in this recipe is pretty overwhelming, with a disproporionately thick brownie layer topped by chocolate chips as well.  If I make this again, I'll double the graham cracker layer and possibly omit the chocolate chips but increase the marshmallows.

It's also a bar that benefits from being well sealed and allowed to mellow for a few days before eating.

I added some crushed graham crackers to the base of this and layered them, and they were delicious!

I followed other reviews and used half flour and half graham cracker crumbs.  I used Hershey bars broken up for the chocolate and followed the rest of the recipe exactly.  My household LOVED it, it was gone in two days and they were asking for more.  It wasn't as messy as others said - we ate some warm and then some the next day and both tasted great to us - will definitely make again.

I easily made this into a double batch.  It was a wonderful way to do a "cookie" recipe without going through all the extra time of making cookies!  My family inhaled these!!

Very sweet, but addictive!  Did 1 cup graham cracker crumbs and 1/2 cup flour, and added chopped pecans instead of peanuts.  Spread it in pan with a silicone spatula and added more marshmallows to completely cover chocolate (which was a mix of chopped Easter bunny and semi-sweet chocolate chips).  Let it cool, then cut with a knife sprayed with Pam or dipped in water, because the marshmallow tends to stick and stretch, pulling at the bar beneath.  Not something to have around the house if you're watching your figure, but great for bake sales, potlucks, volunteer teas at school, etc.  These are so much fun and sooo yummy!  Thanks for sharing this great recipe!

The taste is good but they are very dry and the bottom keeps crumbling. Cool in the fridge and use a greased sharp knife to cut.

following the reviews, after we doubled the recipe, we replaced half the flour with graham cracker crumbs (we just did a box of graham crackers in the food processor).  we also used semi-sweet chocolate chips instead of the chocolate bars - this was PERFECT!  a note: the crust didn't seem like it would be enough, but don't worry - it puffs and spreads as it bakes.

I thought this recipe was ok. It tasted good but it did not taste like s'mores. It tasted more like a cookie I guess. I used half flour and half graham cracker crumbs instead of all flour.

Great when they're fresh out of the oven.  With kids, it is very fun to set out all the toppings and let them decorate their own little section of the pan.  Great recipe!
