Very creamy and yummy. If you think your sauce is too runny before pouring it over the macaroni, it's not. I was very nervous that my sauce was not thick enough, but once I poured it over the macaroni and baked it, the dish turned out wonderful!

I have to laugh at the one who rated this 1 star for the fat and calories... who makes low cal mac & cheese? :)  This is a great recipe.  Prepare yourself for a heartattack on a plate but well worth it.  I added onion powder, garlic powder, paprika and used crumbled ritz crackers as the topping.  I thought the sauce was too runny when I poured it in the pan, but as the others said, it really thickens up when in the oven. My 2 year old loves it as do we.  We accompanied it with steamed broccoli for a little healthy upswing.

Rave reviews at my house. Can only give 4 stars though as I followed someone else's tips on reducing milk to 1/2C. Adding 2C evapo. milk and 1/2C sour cream. I decided to double the recipe so that we would have leftovers the next day. I put half the mix in one casserole dish and the other in another dish. Baked one and stored the other un-baked one in the fridge to be put in the oven 1/2 hour before dinner the next day. Do not worry that the sauce seems runny when you add it to the noodles. It thickens up A LOT! Right after the cheese melts add it to the noodles and you're in business.

Rich & Creamy. Looked a little bland, so I added minced garlic (1 tbsp), dry mustard powder (1/2 tsp)& used fresh shredded romano instead of parmesan (if you do use parmesan, use fresh shredded, if you use the grated Kraft kind in the shaker, sauce wont be smooth). Show patience with the roux. If yours came out lumpy, you didnt cook roux right or long enough (stir constantly when cooking roux)

I had to try this recipe ever since I read the rating critizing it for being loaded with "fat" ie CHEESE... Duh, that's what Mac and cheese is about!! I made it with large elbow macaroni so the sauce got all inside the pasta... thru in an extra 1/2 inch slice of Velveeta and some white pepper, and jazzed up the crumbs by mixing the crumbs, melted butter, paprika, onion powder, salt & pepper and then sprinkling over the top.  Very good "old-home" taste!!

I agree that a dash of dry mustard is missing from this recipe.   Also, if you realllly want a rich taste, try substituting half of the milk with evaporated milk.  The evaporated milk gives Mac & Cheese an amazingly rich & creamy taste.  Other than those two things, it's pretty good!

Very good!  Everybody went back for seconds.   The youngest male in the house (age 21) insisted on taking a bowl to go while his girlfriend took him to buy a couch (LOL!).  

The parmesan cheese made the consistency  ever so slightly grainy and I might skip this ingredient next time.

This is an amazing base recipe.  I boiled the noodles in 1:1 chicken broth and water, added ham and used only one cup of cheddar and added a cup of mozzerella.  Wounderful!

When I made the sauce, it looked like more than what I'd need.  But, it bakes up firm and creamy.  I made a couple tweaks though - I added about a cup more cheese than what it called for.  I also used a mixture of marble cheddar, colby, monterrey jack and parmesan.  It still needs something though - maybe some pepper and worchester sauce in the sauce.  Crumbled bacon would be yummy too.  Will probably make again.

This recipe is delicious!  If you are wondering what 8 oz. of elbow macaroni should be in cups, it is 1 3/4 cups.  Also, bake it in an 8 x 8 glass pan.  It fits perfectly. I mixed the bread crumbs with melted butter and spread it on top of the mac and cheese and it browned in the oven.  This is now one of our family favorites.

This turned out a little wierd for me.  I make my mom's mac and cheese recipe all the time, and that one is very creamy, even after being baked.  This one was creamy until I baked it.  It seemed to firm up in the oven a lot, almost dry out a little.  I didn't like it at first, but ended up liking it more as I ate it, and had a second helping.  ;)  I really liked the bread crumbs on top.  (I used Panko bread crumbs).  Like other reviewers said, it is a little bland, and I even added hot sauce, worchestire sauce, chili powder, garlic powder, garlic powder and spicy brown mustard.  It does call for a lot of milk; maybe it needs a little more cheese?  All in all, it was easy to make and satisfying, just not spectacular.  Would have given it three stars, but my babies loved it!

This was really great.  I used Barilla Campanelle pasta and it was superb, I think the different shape and texture helped differentiate it from other mac and cheese.

"This Mac and Chese is EVIL!!!" At least that was all I could hear my girlfriend mumbling between big bites. I took the advise of other reviewers and used a can of evaporated milk in place of some of the milk. The cheese melts nicely and thickens wonderfully. I also used rotini pasta instead of elbow noodles because it holds the cheese sauce better. For you new cooks...you have to heat the flour to a high enough temperature for the thickening process to work...just don't boil it. Don't make this too often, its deadly!

The keys to this recipe are to make the roux very slowly so that it does not get lumpy, and don't worry about how liquid the sauce seems - it firms up nicely in the oven.  I used only 1 cup milk, and used 1 cup evaporated milk, 1/2 cup sour cream, and 1/2 cup half & half, which I think helped with the runniness.  I added 1/2 cup of gorgonzola to this recipe to give it an extra kick, and think I might add even more next time.  I also added a little worceister and mustard powder to the sauce, and think I might add more next time.  This was a very easy recipe to make!

This is a great basic recipe for mac and cheese.  I followed other suggestions by using 1/2 cup of milk, 1 3/4 cup of evaporated milk (didn't have enough for a full 2 cups), 1/2 cup of sour cream.  I also followed the advice of others taking my time when making the cheese sauce.  My cheese sauce came out perfect.  I used sharp cheddar, asiago, and colby jack.  I used about 2 cups of each kind of cheese.  My sauce came out thick because of the amount of cheese I used but I don't mind because I love cheese.  I also added salt, pepper, garlic powder, and mustard for seasoning.  I made this for a pot luck at work and got lots of compliments.  This recipe is a keeper!

I don't get this recipe at all? It has a "full bag of cheese," but it is so "BLAND!" It tasted like homemade milk, noodles, and breadcrumbs. I tried to salvage it by scraping off some of the hefty bread crumbs, which ended up being way too much, and adding a different more flavorful cheese and re-baking. But, it was no luck. It stayed equally as bland but, it only became more grainy. I guess the creamy goodness from mac n cheese comes from good sauce basics. I really wanted to like this, as the picture with the topping looked so good! I was not sure how to modify it though? I hate to rate recipes this low, but unfortunately it was a big waste of ingredients, with all of the cheese, as it ended up getting tossed out.

using canned evaporated milk instead of "regular" milk makes all the difference.... keeps the dish from separating. Creamier, silkier----

If you find it bland, here are some suggestions from other readers.   Make sure you liberally salt your macaroni water.  Use evaporated milk and 1/2 C sour cream. added plenty of black pepper, about 1/2 tsp. of dry mustard, 1/2 onion, chopped and sauteed, a dash of worstershire sauce 
Some also added 1/2 block of cream cheese, 1 cup of mozzarella with very sharp cheese.
Cook crispy bacon mixed with crushed croutons instead of bread crumbs or Ritz crackers.

this is by far the best mac and cheese recipe i have ever encountered!  the roux made the sauce so thick and cheesy without the "floury" taste.  I didn't have elbow macaroni so i used the spirals (i find they catch the sauce better.  i also added chicken, which i cut up, seasoned with salt and pepper, pan-fried it in olive oil until browned.  i mixed the chicken in with the noodles before pouring the sauce.  oh, also, try toasting the breadcrumbs (just as the recipe says) in the same pan you cook the chicken in!  the leftover browned chicken bits adds soooo much flavor.  Major hit with my roommate and my boyfriend!!!

There huge error in this recipe... Or perhaps typo? It should not be 8oz of pasta, but 16 oz. This yields 8 servings. That would take care of most of the "soupy" complaints. As for the bland complaints it's a simple fix. The recipe calls for "sharp cheddar cheese" much more flavor than mild. Another good hint is to always salt you pasta water (should taste like sea water). 
With that said, this recipe was awesome. The simplicity of it makes it flexible. To excite the palate a bit more I've started adding onion power, paprika, and cumin to the cheese sauce. I also added baccon alot of parsley; mainly for color. The breadcrumbs are my favorite part of this dish. I did find that they were a bit soggy. I've altered this part only by adding them the last 10 minutes of cooking. Thank you so much for this recipe. My cheese loving family appreciates it.

I loved this recipe but doctored it to my tasting.  Instead of 3 cups of milk, I used two cups, plus 1/2 cup of sour cream and 1/2 cup of half-n-half.  Instead of the 1/2 grated parmesan cheese, I used 1 cup of Monterey Jack, plus I sprinkled grated parmesan into the mix.  I used two dashes of mustard powder to give it an extra kick, and also added a cup of ham to make the meal complete!  Instead of bread-crumbs, I substituted croutons, maybe 1/4 cup.  Delicious--I'll definitely make it again!

I made this as a side with Christmas dinner so the kids would have something to eat and I think the adults enjoyed it even more!  I give it 4 stars as rated because of the changes I made according to reviews.  I doubled the macaroni and cheddar cheese, yet kept the same amount of milk, buter and flour and it came out perfect.  The Parmesan and paprika sprinkled on top really made it out of this world, and I also added a heaping tablespoon of Dijon mustard (as all other mac and cheese recipes i've loved have always used mustard).  This ones going in my recipe book!

I made this for Thanksgiving and it got rave reviews.  This is the best mac & cheese recipe I've ever made, better than my grandma's :).  Like others said, I was afraid that the liquid wouldn't cook down but it ended up being so creamy and delish!  Thanks for the recipe.

Excellent, although I don't like Parm cheese so  I don't use it. But I didn't even miss it. The thing about mac and cheese is that it is mac and cheese...simple... People expect it to be some way over the top recipe that explodes with this and that flavour, but it is simply a nice, heart warming, homey recipe that warms your tummy. Kudos for not adding so much stuff that it overwhelms the whole mac and cheese aspect!

I was very disappointed in this.  The sauce was not creamy or really cheesy and the breadcrumbs overpowered the taste (though to be honest, there wasn't much taste on the noodles itself).

I'm going to look for another recipe that will be a bit creamier and definitely much cheesier.

Delicious. Though, I want to add my bit about the sauce. I read reviews that said the sauce was a bit runny before baking, but still freaked out when I had a pot full of essentially milk soup. 

The sauce thickens in the oven. Truly. Promise.

I made this for dinner tonight, it was my first attempt at homemade Mac and Cheese, usually it's my husband that makes it from scratch. I didn't use the bread crumbs, but I did top it with the paprika. We thought this was very good. I used sharp cheddar cheese, mild cheddar cheese and fresh parmesan cheese, which came out to a little more cheese than the recipe called for. My husband said I can make the Mac and Cheese from now on! Thanks for sharing.

The best macaroni and cheese  ever made or tasted! It’s not too runny or soupy at all and makes great leftovers (not that it lasts that long in my house). I used Vermont sarp ceddar and Parmesan. I really liked the taste the white chesses created. I can’t stand the kind of macaroni from a box that reminds me of cafeteria food. This recipe is unmistakably baked and homemade. Anyone who says they don’t like macaroni and cheese has never tried this recipe. When I lost the recipe I knew I could enjoy any other kind so I went searching for it on this site. This one is definitely going in my personal recipe book.

I think this recipe is pretty good. There were some people on here that thought it was too bland. My suggestion is to use sharp cheddar. The sharper the better. I used a mixture of New York White Sharp Cheddar and just regular Sharp Cheddar. Make sure you salt the sauce before putting it into your pan. It was delicious. The bread crumbs added a lot of flavor. My husband and I gobbled it up! For those of you who thought it was too lumpy: you have to whisk the flour and butter together. Continue to whisk while you SLOWLY add the milk. It came out perfect for me. I will make this in the future!

Really easy mac and cheese to make, sauce seemed runny/soupy at first but turned out nice and creamy. Added flavored breadcrumbs to the top that were yummy and added flavor. I also added more cheese to the mix (about a cup more) and a little on top before cooking it! Overall the Mac and cheese was delicious and suuuuuper easy to make :) 
Would definitely make again! Great recipe!

I used 2 cups macaroni and half the milk because everyone said it was too runny, but I didn't have that problem. The problem was the taste. It needs salt, and the parmesan makes it too grainy. Very bad recipe.

loved this recipe, doubled it with no problems. however, it may have turned out better due to the following changes I made: only 1/2 cup of milk, with 2 cups of evaporated milk and 1/2 cup sour cream for a creamier texture. added a clove of garlic, 1 diced sauteed onion and some spices to the sauce as the recipe seemed sort of bland with just the milk, roux and cheeses. and for the topping I used crushed croutons browned in butter. this is a very quick and simple recipe that I will turn to again! but I definitely recommend adding something a little extra to your sauce if you want something a little more tasty. and the croutons turned out a lot crunchier on top than the baked breadcrumbs.

Tasty, and your picky kids will eat it too.  This is an incredibly fattening and high-calorie dish, so I think the serving size should be smaller.  This recipe serves about 6 in my family. I cut down the milk to 2.5 cups, and it was plenty creamy.  Added a bit of garlic powder and some pepper, too, for some needed flavor.  My recommendation: bake this first for 25 minutes without the bread crumb topping.  Take it out of the oven and mix it up, allowing the extra liquid to evaporate. Then, sprinkle on the bread crumb topping and bake for another 5-7 minutes.

I am a "mac and cheese-aholic"!! It is one of my favorite "comfort" foods.  However, this recipe will be deleted from my recipe box as soon as I finish this review.  I have never been a fan of cheddar cheese cooked in any dish.  It is too greasy, too stringy, and never melts smoothly.  I hate to sound so negative about this, but I was extremely disappointed with the results of the recipe.  I guess I'll go back to the old stand by...mac and velveeta cheese!!

Delicious!  This is definitely what you call comfort food!  I made a few changes:  I added plenty of black pepper, about 1/4 tsp. of dry mustard, 1/2 onion, chopped and sauteed, a dash of worsterhire sauce and one large tomato, diced.  I substituted Kasseri cheese for the parmesan.  My family loved it and i brought leftovers to work and everyone wants the recipe!  Thanks a bunch!

This is an excellent base recipe. I've used it "as is" for small children (read: picky), but always alter it for "the rest of us". I use whatever I 1) have on hand to throw in or 2) what works well with the entree I'm serving. I've used evrything from tabasco sauce to swiss cheese in this and toasted rye bread crumbs to potato chips on it: it's all good. **A good recipe to have "Tweens" make, as it's pretty easy & fun.

My husband and I had one helping each and didn't like it. We are not picky eaters but this had no flavor and a wierd texture because of the bread crumbs. We had to throw away the rest of the dish.

Well I just made this and it has a good taste, I didn't use the parmesan, as I know it can make it grainy. I used the evaporated milk from another review and this is the MAJOR problem I had. I cooked the 8oz. of pasta(I weighed it out! I didn't just use 1 8oz. cup of macaroni) and thought wow this isn't very much macaroni for all this sauce! So I made the sauce and sure enough I had a whole pot of sauce and this little bit of macaroni....why does it only say 8oz if there's so much sauce??? So right now I pretty much have a bowl of macaroni soup in the oven!!!! I will make it again as the taste is good and the topping but I will double or even triple the pasta as that is definitely not enough! Did anyone else run into this problem???

I think the reason so many members thought this was bland was because it has way too much milk! I agree with the member named Sweetjam...this is enough cheese sauce for a pound of pasta! I also agree to add salt and pepper. I had a problem with clumping and I don't know why! I omitted the breadcrumbs and baking step. I added chopped green onions on top for more flavor. I think if I try this again, I would use 1/2 the milk and make it hot before adding it to the cheese mixture.

What's the buisness with this I made two attempts and it came out all curdled in the end I threw away both batches.  I used whole milk real cheese I even took the pot off the stove before poring the milk.  I used low heat always stirred I even called my mom in for help and are stumped.  Has any one had the same experience with this recipe? The ingredients were fresh from the store I don't understand.

Turned out good and creamy with patience cooking the sauce, continued stirring and cooking a little longer than you think to make sure the flour really is done so it won't turn out grainy.  I doubled the recipe, and used 5 cups of extra sharp cheddar instead of 4.  Also, I didn't have parmesan so used a cup of a shredded cheese mix of mozzerella, romano, asiago, and parmesan. I spiced it up with some worcestershire sauce, garlic powder, and dry mustard.  Everyone raved about it!

I offered to my little boy that I'd make him ANY treat he wanted if he hurried through his chores Saturday morning, I was expecting cookies, cupcakes or bars, but he asked for "real mac n cheese, not from a box!"  "Umm, OK."  So I popped onto my handy allrecipes app, and once again you pulled through for me!  

I was really worried because every time I'd ever had homemade mac it was at a buffet with way over cooked noodles, or when a family member made it, it was just dried up noodles with melted and dried cheese, with milk literally poured over the top of it.  Needless to say I was pretty nervous.

I didn't have Parmesan, or cheddar, just some Colby and Jack, and I didn't have bread or bread crumbs, but I went ahead with the modified recipe, buddy was charging through his chores!  I doubled the recipe and baked it in a glass 9x13 casserole.  I made sure to cook the noodles al dente, when I popped it into the oven my son finished his chores and pouted looking at the empty pot, he'd though he'd missed out, but he was thrilled to see it baking away in the oven.  We had a big sit down lunch, all 5 of us, and everyone filled their bellies while ohhing and awwing about the yummy pasta.  There was plenty left for dinner, so I mixed it with the left over California mix steamed veggies, and there was dinner!  Success!  Thanks Allrecipes!

Three stars because it is incredibly easy to make [I followed the recipe to the letter], but I couldn't give it more stars for two reasons. First, it is bland. Bland, bland, bland and bland. It definitely needs some added zing - even salt and pepper would have help. Next time I will definitely add spices.  Also, I really didn't like the texture of the parmesan cheese after I served it.  All the cheese melted wonderfully and the sauce was great but once served it was a bit grainy. I didn't like it. Next time I will use all cheddar. 
 
I, too, found the person who gave it one star for the fat and calories to be hysterical.  What do  you expect? It's pasta and cheese. heehee
 
Definitely try this recipe but doctor it up to give it some taste.

This is a great recipe! My boyfriend lamented for days when the leftovers were finished. The only changes I made were to add fresh broccoli in the middle and more seasoning to the cheese sauce. I blanched the broccoli and set aside while I prepared the rest of the meal, I poured half the macaroni in the baking dish, sprinkled a layer of shredded cheddar, then broccoli, another sprinkle of cheddar, the rest of the macaroni, then poured the cheese sauce slowly over the the whole thing. The sauce is thin but it baked up to mix through out. To the cheese sauce I added some cayenne and chili powder, a little salt and pepper and some mustard powder.

Not for true foodies.  Too bland & tasteless even with many of the recommended modifications.  This recipe is for those who think that mac & cheese normally comes out of a box.

Great mac & cheese! I used 2 cups cheddar and one cup shredded monterey jack. I forgot the paprika but I put in a little dry mustard, garlic powder & onion powder. I used breadcrumbs on the top and sprinkled oregano over that. Very tasty!

I doubled the serving size from 4 to 8.  Eight servings call for 6 cups of milk, I only used 4 cups and didn't have any problems with the consistency.  I also added 1/2 block of cream cheese, 1 cup of mozzarella, and tablespoon of mayo. I added salt and onion powder to the pasta before combining the sauce with it.

I did not Love this. I thought it was on the bland side and there was not alot of taste. I had to use alot of salt. I was hoping for something more cheesier.

I didn't top with breadcrumbs and I thought it needed a little salt. It set well though, probably too well so I might have had a little too much pasta in there. I may try adding peas and bacon next time.

Delish! I used a blend of cheddar, marble with garlic and Parmesan cheeses for the sauce. Instead of bread crumbs (we didn't have any on hand), used crushed Ritz crackers and I added a dash of herbs de Provence to the "bread crumb" topping. So easy!

My sauce was a little runny, but it baked up normal and came out delicious! I added some crumbled bacon on top for an extra bit of crunch and flavor.

This is a really yummy recipe, and whether you use Velveeta or cheddar is simply a personal preference.  I use extra-sharp cheddar, omit the breadcrumbs, and put onion powder in the sauce. Also use more cheddar, shredded, on the top, and sprinkle paprika over all. I make a thinner roux because it does thicken up while baking.

This was an awesome recipe, but like most people I added about 2 1/2 cup of cheese, instead of only 2 cups.  I found that 1/2 of bread crumbs was too much, so next time I'm not going to add so much.  Great leftovers!!

This family favorite could be spiced up  a bit by adding dried mustard powder to taste like my Grandmother used to do. I would suggest 1/2 teaspoon to start. You will greatly enjoy the added piquancy.

Very easy! First time I ever made homemade mac and cheese! This mac and cheese was really good and really easy to make! You can mix different kinds of shredded cheeses together (I did) And was real yummy! I ALSO Made my own bread crumbs out of very small pieces of bread since i didnt have a can of bread crumbs sitting around. And I think it turned out better than it would of with regular bread crumbs on top! :)

I've been trying to find the best Mac & Cheese recipe for my husband who loves homemade mac and cheese. He says this one tops all others. I've made at least 10 different recipes. 
Just a note, the thing that made this recipe so yummy was using a 9x13 pan so that the topping was more evenly spread, plus the bottom was golden brown and a little harder than the middle, adding TONS of awesome flavor!

I was looking for a recipe that doesn't require a fake cheese sauce and I stumbled across this one.  I think it is a good basic recipe that will allow you to experiment.  I made a few changes. For starters I only used 2 cups of milk, I like my mac and cheese not so creamy, and I used a blend of Sharp Cheddar cheese and Montery Jack. I added some garlic powder, onion powder, salt & pepper and parsley.  Instead of elbow macaroni I used whole wheat rotini for some extra bite. I also layered some turkey pepporoni in the center which made it even more delicious and added some more flavor.  I really like the idea of adding the toasted bread crumbs on top, I usually would put parmesan cheese on top and place it in the broiler for a crunch topping, but this is much better.  Melting the cheeses before mixing it with the pasta is the key to success for this dish. I definitely will be making this again. Yummy!!!!

This was very bland tasting, gritty texture, even the kids didn't like it.  You need to add at least another 8oz of mac to use all the sauce it makes.  We won't be making this again.

This recipe is bland and needs something added to it to make it not so boring. Also, the bread crumbs on top are just disgusting after you bake it, there is too much and they are mushy and slimy, even my 2 year old wouldn't eat it. If you dare make this, I would add some seasoning to it, reduce the milk, add more cheese and DO NOT use at least that many bread crumbs.

Obviously,"everything in moderation" is the rule of thumb for dishes like this, and a lot of others. Having said that, this is comfort food at it's best. The only thing I changed is to use half sharp cheddar and half velveeta, which makes and keeps it more creamy. And also added a little red pepper for a hint of warmth. Good down home recipe.

We loved this mac and cheese, and believe me, my 3 year old is a regular old conisseur when it comes to macaroni and cheese. We did add some dry mustard, salt and pepper to the roux, and added a little extra shredded cheddar. We topped it with seasoned breadcrumbs. Yummy!

This recipe was just the thing to impress my boss, who loved the old-fashioned flavor. I did add the ground mustard, and mixed a few different cheeses for added flavor. I also substituted heavy cream for about a third of the milk, and it really added to the rich taste. Thank you!

This recipe is perfect. I normally like a little kick to most foods but, I resisted the urge to "spice" it up and I am glad that I did. The balance between the sharp cheddar and the parmesan was just right. I made exactly as directed and everyone loved it. I made it the night before and put it in the oven the next day for Easter and it was just delicious.

I tend to choose my recipes based on reviews, so I really don't like when people give a negative review then go on to state all the ways in which they deviated from the original recipe. Well, this time, that's me. As I tasted as I went, I had no choice but to make some adjustments. 
It ended up being decent, but only because I changed a) the amount of milk and butter b) cooking time and most importantly, to the cheese sauce, I added lots of black pepper, salt, cayenne, dry mustard and garlic. Or in other words, flavor.

Pretty good. Very filling though with all that cheese and butter. To make matters worse I doubled that recipe and there are only 2 of us. We will be even more overweight after we eat the leftovers for 3 more meals. Next time I think I will try a different one.

Tasted amazing, just like homemade baked mac and cheese should. I made a double recipe and it was just enough to fill a 9x13 pan about 2-3 inches deep. Despite what the other reviews say, no substitutions are necessary. I didn't have 4 cups of shredded sharp Cheddar so I ended up using a one-pound block of American, which worked fine. Other than that, I didn't make any substitutions. I was skeptical of the need to brown the breadcrumbs in butter, but I did so anyways and it was well worth the effort. FYI, the paprika is probably optional.

The cheeses in this dish make it very rich, so I added some broccoli and left-over chicken pieces to it as well and it was nice and refreshing.  I also used gluten-free pasta.  If you are using gluten free pasta, only cook the pasta a minimum amount, because it gets more cooking in the oven and you don't want to overcook gluten-free pasta.  I also added some garlic salt as well.

Best home made mac and cheese I've had!  Made a couple of adjustments - I added some ground mustard, Worschtershire sauce and additional paprika for kick, as well as a package of Hormel bacon bits.  Next time I make it, I will cut the butter/bread crumb mixture in half...it was too much on the top.  Also, I would not cook the pasta completely up front - the noodles absorb a lot of the sauce and get just a little mushier than I like.

This is a good basic recipe... just needs to be jazzed up a bit.  In New Orleans, I never make a white sauce without adding a couple of drops of Tabasco, or other hot sauce.  I also added creole seasoning.

Perfect. My picky little veggie lover LOVED this recipe. ;)

I have experimented with different cheeses and used pre-made breadcrumbs ( just sprinkle over top instead of frying in butter). This recipe always come out great.

If you thought this dish was too bland or just bad in general, you either:
A) did something wrong or
B) are making something different than the rest of us.
It was epic.

After reading the scores of negative reviews, I decided to make it myself. The recipe instructions are vague, incomplete. The recipe offers no tips or tricks to make this Mac and Cheese turn out. Sauce was brown, not yellow or white, cheese was "grainy". Everyone on here that is saying how creamy and delicious it turned out is just not telling the whole story. The author of this recipe should be banned from Allrecipes.com for life!

Delicious mac and cheese.  My boyfriend was like what is making it so fluffy and it's good.  Was good to make the mac and cheese different and using flour.  Will be using this recipe again.  Thanks.

This is a good, easy recipe. The sauce will definitely thicken in the oven. I used medium cheddar cheese (because that's what I had on hand) but next time I will use sharp, and it will be even better!

Very good! I actually altered the recipe a little: I use Mexican Four Cheese instead of the Cheddar and Parmesan. I also add about 3 cloves of finely chopped garlic to the mix and only use about 1-1.5 cups of milk instead of 3 because I don't like it too creamy. For the top i just sprinkle the cheese and bread crumbs instead of melting more butter etc. Very delicious! Oh and don't forget the salt!

Best mac and cheese I've ever had! It's very fun and easy to make. However, it works better with a topping of crushed Ritz crackers.

This is a great, easy recipe.  My suggestion would be to add a hint of ground nutmeg to the roux.  It provides the warm, nutty flavor that marries the cheese and the sauce so well together.  My husband is a chef and this is one of his "secret" mac and cheese tips!

This was very delicious.  As other reviewers mentioned, I added some minced garlic to the cheese sauce and a little bit of salt and pepper so it would not be so bland.  Also, don’t worry about the sauce being thin; it definitely thickens after you take it out of the oven.  After I added the pasta and cheese sauce in baking pan I sprinkled grated cheddar cheese on top and pieces of bacon, then toped with panko bread crumbs....it was really tasty, when it came out of the oven!

This is a great, tasty recipe! I've made it twice now and we love it. 

*It does make a lot of sauce so I went ahead and used a pound of elbow macaroni the second time and it was perfect!

I love homemade mac n cheese and I think my standards are pretty high.   Our family really enjoyed this.  It was excellent the 2nd day.  I came back to get the recipe because I am making it again.  It was nice and creamy, not gritty.  Just kept my temp real low the whole time of making the sauce.  Because we like a little more spice I did add fresh minced sauteed garlic and onion. A little tabasco helped too.

It was a pretty good recipe.  I was afraid it would be bland from previous ratings so I added onion and garlic to the mix.  Afterwards I used shredded white chedder cheese instead of parmasan.  Everyone at the Bunko party really liked it.

I thought this recipe was pretty good! However, I did make a few changes: I only used two cups of milk and added 1/2 cup sour cream. I think the sauce would have been too runny otherwise. Also, I used "Italian-style" breadcrumbs on top, along with some crushed red pepper: I think these two things really added to the flavor of this dish. With my alterations, I will make this again. Thanks for the recipe!

Editable yes, but very bland.  The only tip from the recipe I actually liked was adding paparika to the topping mixture.  Otherwise, I suggest following the advice of others.  #1 Either don't bother making it or #2 chance the recipe entirely by adding more cheese, ETC.

This is the best Mac and Cheese recipe
I've found.  It can be a little time
consuming while making the roux and 
melting the cheese, but the results are
astounding.  I've made this several times
and it's become a family favorite.

This was a very good recipe, but rich?  Not quite.  It turned out to be a bit bland what with all the milk, and although the bread crumbs were a crunchy touch, they added to the blandness.  For something not too rich or tangy or cheesy, try this.  For a cheddary experience, look elsewhere.

This will be the only recipe I ever use for mac and cheese.  I used good Irish Cheddar and Parm Reggiano grated myself.  Large elbows cooked al dente is the way to go in this dish.  I did add chopped jalapenos and bit of shaved or minced onion and a bit of dry mustard as well.  The topping browned to perfection and the rich and creamy dish was appreciated by all even after rewarming.  It made heavenly leftovers, too.

We loved this recipe. I have been looking for a mac and cheese recipe that had that creamy texture we love, not a thicker solid dish. After reading other reviews I decided to play with the recipe as far as the sauce. I wanted a 9x13 dish but didn't want to double the recipe with all that milk and cheese. I felt it safe to try a package of 12 oz egg noodles rather than 8 oz pasta b/c my past recipes used 2 cups of milk instead of 3, hoping to find a balance. This worked out great! My dish was more than 1/2 full, the sauce was a bit thinner than past ones, but as reviewers stated, it does thicken in the oven, but you are left with a nice loose creamy mixture. I agree that evaporated milk gives a nicer flavor than regular milk as it tends to be bland with that, but I didn't have any today. So I added 1 tbsp dijon mustard. For personal cheese preference I used half sharp cheddar and half colby jack. I omitted the bread crumb topping b/c my son doesn't like those on anything. Did salt and pepper to taste, but didn't alter or add anything else. This was a great flavor and texture, not bland at all. This recipe with my changes is my new mac and cheese recipe!

It was OK. I think next time I would scale back on the milk and butter. A little too runny for my taste.

This was an OK recipe.  I was hoping for a more cheesy flavor, but found it bland.  My four year old was not impressed and asked if she could only eat the other items on her plate.  If you have a family that prefers more simple flavors, then this would be a great recipe.  Unfortunately this did not work out too well for us.

Thank you for a great recipe.

I think this recipe is one of those types that varies based off of personal taste and texture. I was a bit deterred at first before making this because there are so many mixed reviews.. but I still gave it a shot, OF COURSE I had to change a few things to really make it my own and to how I personally felt it would taste good. the only thing I did different, was changing the breadcrumbs to my own special blend that I use for  my own homemade shake-n-bake. Mine include Garlic, Oregano, Black pepper, salt, and creole seasoning for a bit of an extra kick... other then that I pretty much followed the recipe.. the taste and texture was great to both my boyfriend and myself. The texture resembles almost all homemade mac n cheese I have ever tasted, so if you are getting a texture that is way too gritty, i'd suggest cutting down the Parmesan cheese some, to me, the more the better. 

I'd just suggest that you take the time to think of your own favorite blends to put in for taste, everyone is different and everybody's taste buds and preferences are going to be different.. make it your own and I can guarantee you that this recipe is pretty good.

I liked this, it must be a personal taste thing with the reviews all over the place.  It is a mild flavor, and the bread crumbs add to it.  More work than I want to do for mac and cheese but overall a very good mac and cheese.

i had to make an account to rant about how BAD this recipe is. disregard ANY reviews that rate this more than 1 star. 

this is the most bland mac and cheese i had ever tasted, it tastes like plain pasta. i would much rather eat frozen mac and cheese from a box than this any day.
i am embarrassed to have made this to say the least.  i hope my review saves at least one person from disappoint.

great base for a mac and cheese.  Like others I added a few things to fit my families "tastes" .... dry mustard, onion powder, and worcestershire sauce.  I also made it more "decadent" by using 1/2 cup of sour cream, a large can of evaporated milk, then topped off with whole milk to get the 3 cups liquid needed.  I topped it with additional cheese before adding the bread crumbs/butter to create a nice "crust" .... THANK YOU so very much for this recipe!!!!!

This was a good recipe. I used bigger noodles and the sauce thickened perfectly. I added a little bit more cheese than what was called for along with a little bit more seasoning because it was a little on the bland side. But it was over all a really good macaroni and cheese recipe!

Exactly what I expect baked mac and cheese to taste like. Some tips: Begin melting the cheese early on, it took much longer than I expected! Also, I used half whole milk and half evaporated milk to thicken and it came out wonderfully!

This was very lacking in flavor, but in retrospect I should have used salted butter instead of unsalted butter. I bake a lot, so I always have unsalted butter on hand and sometimes forget that most recipes really call for salted butter. The portion is also HUGE. It says serves 4, but if you're using this as a side dish, honestly I think it serves closer to 8. Next time I'm going to halve the recipe and add more spices.

Wonderful dish. Made it with my four-year old for dinner last night. Great alternative to boxed mac and cheese. Prepared it exactly as the recipe reads. Very rich, but tasty.

SO GOOD. We added extra cheese... sharp or extra old cheddar is highly recommended. Spend the extra few dollars and buy a nice piece of aged cheddar from the cheese counter, then grate it at home. I will make this again! Reheats well too :)

Don't use fat free cheddar cheese I made the mistake of using and it didn't taste good. In fact there was no taste to it. I recommend regular shredded cheese. Other than that it was good with salt Hah

It's very easy to make and delicious! I've been making this for 3-4 times now and my boyfriend gives me thumbs up. :) Don't hesitate to add more Cheddar cheese and make sure it's "sharp," not "medium." And for me, only 1 cup of milk was enough.

This is my redo review.  The first time I tried I accidentally failed to put as much milk as was required, so it came out really dry and the breadcrumbs were overpowering.  This time, I put in the proper amount of milk as shown in the recipe, and I used only half the amount of breadcrumbs.  It turned out absolutely decadent! This recipe is definitely a keeper! Thank you!

This turned out great.  I was a little worried that is was too soupy but, it thickened up after baking.  My family loved it.  There actually weren't any leftovers.

Thought this recipes was very easy.  I found it a little too creamy and will decrease the amount of milk the next time.  It needs more kick and would add spices (pepper and maybe mustard seed).

I liked it but thought it was a bit bland.  I roasted some chopped cuts of bacon and shallots in a pan, then added it to the cheese mix before I mixed it with the pasta. It really seemed to bring out a TON of flavor and it gave it a rich, warm inviting aroma. :)

I love mac and cheese, but my love for the cheesy goodness was no match for this recipe.  The bread crumbs were overpowering, the mac and cheese itself was very, very bland, and it wasn't so much creamy as it was gelatinous (possibly my fault, but I followed the recipe exactly).  Copious amounts of additional salt and pepper yielded no improvement.  I thought I'd at least save it for leftovers (I hate to waste food), but it was even worse the next day.  I'll buy a $1 box of no-brand powdered cheese mac and cheese before trying this recipe again.

Great recipe! I used 1 cup of sharp cheddar and 2 cups of whiteamerican cheese and sprinkled parm. cheese on top instead of bread crumbs, and added some needed salt and pepper. I also added crumbled bacon to the mixture and to the top! My husband requested that! Will make again... great recipe for first time making homemade Mac and Cheese!

This was my first attempt at Mac and Cheese, and I must say this is a great recipe it was really simple  and delicious. I omitted the bread crumbs and used a cup of heavy cream because I needed to get rid of it. Thanks for sharing the great recipe!

This was pretty good. I think I made to much of the roux, and everything got a bit thick after that. But I know what went wrong and next time it should be even better. Make sure to just make barely enough roux, otherwise it does come out with more of a grainy texture. One heaping tablespoon of butter and two of flour is more than enough...don't go hog wild with the flour otherwise you taste it and have to keep adding more and more liquid.

This was about as blqnd as could be.  If I were to make this again, I'd probably add some dry mustard, garlic, and more cheddar.  I think I'll probably just find a different recipe, though.

Had a big family/friends birthday party yesterday for our daughter and this mac and cheese was one of our sides. I loved the parm addition! I heated my milk in the microwave first so it wouldn't take as long to thicken on top of the stove. Once it got nice and thick I then turned the heat off, added the cheese and stirred until it melted. I topped the casserole with more cheese and then the bread crumbs. Delish and thank you!

I just made this and it's great. I made some changes as another user recommended. I used 1/2 c of milk, 2 cups of evaporated milk, 1 tbs of dry mustard, and 1/2 c of sour cream. Amazing! My new Mac n cheese recipe.

Have been looking for that perfect Mac and Cheese... I have tried several recipes.. Finally found the one!  I used about 12.5 oz just because that is what I had on hand.  Increased the flour to 3 full tbsps, increased the chedder to 3 cups and 1 cup of mozza (i love cheese)I read the reviews first and took some of their suggestions.  I added about a tsp of powdered mustard and onion powder.  The sauce was very runny, but one cooked, it was perfect.  I added the bread crumbs and paprika in the last 10 minutes.  If you like a lot of crunch, you could easily double that part of the recipe.  This recipe will be a repeat one for me!

We used a combo of colby jack, mozzarella and american with rigatoni noodles just because that's what we had and it worked great.  Toasted panko bread crumbs on top - everyone enjoyed it.  I was worried it was too liquidy but read the review assuring that it wouldn't be that way after it baked and she was right!  It would be better with more seasoning (i.e. dried mustard, Worcestershire sauce, salt, pepper) so I'm only giving it 4 stars.

The sauce was just divine. I didn't brown breadcrumbs in butter but toasted them for 5 min to get the same result. Less butter and one less pan to wash!

Awesome!  Do not cook the mac noodles completely, they will continue to cook while in the oven.  Boil until al dente and then rinse with cold water to stop the cooking process prior to mixing in the cheese sauce and baking.  Great recipe!

I use 3 cups of evaporated milk instead of regular milk to make it fluffy! My family likes the sharpest cheese available. I also add a large onion and a bread crumb/parm cheese mixture for topping. Broil for 3 mins or so after cooking to get that nice crispy top. You can add chunks of ham too for a heartier meal.

It is a great receipe, I doubled everything. I did add the dry mustard as my mother always did. I had lite creme left over so I added that and some sour cream to the milk to make the 6 cups. I added the macaroni to the pan but only used about 4 1/2 cups of the cheese milk mixture. It would have been way too much so I froze the rest for next week.

Delish! I have made a lot of the mac and cheese recipes on the site hoping each one would be the hit. This one is! Many of the others are dry and not creamy. This is very creamy and not dry and soo good! I added a little garlic powder, salt, a cup extra cheese and worstishire (I would probably leave out the worstishire next time because my three year old wasn't a fan of that taste but everyone else liked it). Best mac and cheese I have made on this site!

Pretty good recipe, very simple to follow exactly as is. My kids still prefer my regular mac and cheese with velveeta lol but for a special occasion, holiday gathering, or company it's great

I used bow ties, baked my breadcrumbs soaked in olive oil (I always do) and used 2/3rds the milk. All I had was Mexican cheese and left over cheddar cubes so used them . It was great :) good directions! Would recommend and easy to prep and follow!!

I usually use this mac & cheese recipe but i make a few changes: I add bacon and onions and thyme and mustard. Then it's perfectly to my taste.

Everyone loves this recipe, but I add minced onion to the rue or onion powder. Also add ground mustard to the sauce 1 teaspoon is good. Gives this recipe much more flavor to be enjoyed by all!! PS: Only boil your noodles half the recommend time, they get too mushy otherwise.

Well that's what I'm talking about, really good mac & cheese. I used seasoned croutons for the top, crushed them and sprinkled on top, gave it that extra kick instead of paprika. As I write this there is another batch in the oven. My 8 yr old daughter didn't like it . Well 3 out of 4 ain't bad.

I've tried many Mac-N-Cheese recipes.  This is by far the best one I've made/found so far.  I added Garlic Salt and Minced Onion to taste and it turned out delicous!!!!    The Parm. Cheese was outstanding addition.

Use this recipe for a good base to start.  This recipe was too bland.  Next time I will use an additional cup of chedder cheese.  I think that may do it but not sure.  Next time I will add 1/2 teaspoon of salt because the cream sauce and noodles give a bland taste without additional salt.  This recipe doesn't state the size of cassarole dish.  For 1/2 box of noodles (8 oz) I used a 9" x 7" x 3"deep dish which worked O.K.  Do not, do not cook the noodles until done.  That will make too soft of noodles after baking.  I hate that at restaurants. Cook only 5 minutes or less instead of the 7 minutes stated on the box.  Use crushed cracker crumbs instead of bread.  They have a better texture and is easier.  All in all this recipe is not the finished produce. It needs some work but a good place to start.

I love the breaded macaroni and cheese idea and I found this recipe very easy to follow.  However, there was excessive milk and I mean excessive.  I had to drain so much out, even after I decreased the amount by 1/3rd of the milk amount recommended.

This is delicious! I like to add mustard (frenchs yellow bottle) and worcestershire sauce to kick up the flavor a notch. The other thing that is a nice addition is roasting 3 or 4 tomatoes in olive oil & Italian seasoning and stirring that in with the sauce and noodles. Oh yeah, like another reviewer said, try this with the large size elbow noodles. So good!!

I've made this twice now, and it is delicious. Unfortunately the second time I think I burned the roux a little beacuse it was left on the stove too long at too high of a heat before I added the milk, because in the end my cheese was like it had been melted in a microwave, not very saucy at all. It didn't even seep into the noodles when I put it on top, it just sat there! Frustrated me greatly, but it's still pretty good. But that was my own mistake, I'll just have to keep a closer eye on it next time.

I think this recipe turned out well. Based on other reviews I left out the parmesan because all I had was grated parmesan and I didnt want it to be gritty. I added a few tbsp of sour cream, salt, pepper, garlic powder, and ground mustard. I only used 2 cups of milk as well. I subbed the bread crumbs for ritz crackers since the exp date was near. Will def make again!

I can not rate this as I did not follow all of the directions. The five stars is for my own version of this dish. However, here are my changes 2 c monterey jack/colbyjack cheese 1 c sharp cheddar 1 can evaporated milk and 1 cup whole milk .. I made the roux with the 2.5 T flour and the 1/4 c butter added the cheeses until melted then I add about 3T sugar and 1.5 T mustard . Pour this over 16 oz box of cooked(in salted water) elbow macaronis and then liberally sprinkle with lawry's season salt. Then I bake until just bubbly .. The additions I made are how I usually make my mac and cheese but I usually add velveeta cheese and forgot to buy some and did not feel like going back to the store. I needed a cheese sauce type of recipe to get the melted consistency of the velveeta. This worked out perfect and it was very good with no leftovers

I guess i was slightly disappointed because, as a kid, I should love any kind of mac and cheese... but this fell a little flat of my expectations. It was very bland, but once i added salt it was a bit better. I would have liked it to be great without having to add anything though.

This was absolutely delicious!  It was my first attempt at making "real" macaroni and cheese, and I'll never go back! 

I needed to double the recipe and in the process ran out of milk, so I used buttermilk which I had on hand and some sour cream...it seemed to work out just fine!  Like some of the other said, don't worry if it's runny when you initially add the sauce to the noodles - it will work out just fine :)  Thanks for the recipe :)

This was a great recipe! But, I put some cayenne pepper along with some paprika. It was a little bland but the perfect combination of cheesy and creamy. The cheeses I put in it is cheddar, parmesan, and Gouda which I think added a little flavor.

I changed this up a bit, but I know the original will be amazing. I will make a big batch of this and freeze for quick meals. I made home made pasta, used 2 cps of milk, and 1/2 cp of sour cream, and added about half cup of a Swiss/gruyere mix. Then I turned it into a tuna casserole with peas. My son, who's 3, devoured it!

Great recipe! Made some changes, tho. Doubled it and used a whole box of Bertolli multi-grain elbows. Left out the parmesan and put in fontina instead. Also added a little smoked gouda for a hint of something different. Used panko bread crumbs. My family loved it.

love it mostly because afterward i dont have an entire loaf of velveeta left over.. okay totally modified the recipe to what i had handy so haters dont judge. used trader joes tortolinni (the kind in a bag-not in the fridge section) made the roux and also added feta cheese (since i had it and decided to use here instead of let it possibly go wasted..) made a little baby spitup look to it- but tasted great! umm oh yeah the best part?! added some cooked sausage to bulk it up a bit since the torts were slightly scarce =) sooo good! bf loved it and day two, i just ate the delish leftovers and decided to give this review. k hope it helps! have fun with your cooking and dont forget to cherish dinnertime & enjoying each other! goes great with chardonnay!

My kids loved it! But me not so much. It was grainy a bit and i didn't even use Parmesan...For the topping i used garlic herb bread crumbs that was my favorite part. ** just a tip... if you think it doesn't look like much when you first start making it...DO NOT DOUBLE for a family of 4 ...I did that, and there was way too much. It was hearty and filled my boys up which is hard to do.

i was very nervous about trying this recipe, mainly because I live in the mountains at a very high altitude and pasta and things are tricky to cook here. But it turned out really good. I would definitely add garlic and or dry mustard powder to spice it up a bit for my taste!

I'm not sure what kind of taste buds you all that raved such good things about this recipe. I would not recommend it to anyone, the texture was not rich, it wasn't that cheesy, for sure not a comfort food, and I'm pregnant. Very unhappy.

Very good and very filling! 
When I was making the sauce, it looked like there was too much milk, so I only used 2 1/2 cups of milk. I used mozzarella cheese and no parm. When pouring it over the noodles, it did seem very runny, but it thickened nicely in the oven. I did read reviews of it being too bland, but I personally thought it tasted great, just like the way mac and cheese should taste!

Yum! This was so rich that I was full after a few bites, but had to keep going because it was so delicious. It tastes authentic and the bread crumbs add good texture. Thanks for the recipe!

This was very easy to make and tasted great.  You do need to let the roux cook out some to get rid of the flour/starchy taste.

Added garlic powder, sour cream (in place of 1/2 cup of the milk), and chopped smoked sausage. Husband said this is the best mac and cheese he has ever had. Good recipe and easy to play around with!

Made this last night and it was great! Mac n cheese is always something I manage to screw up but this was an excellent recipe for me to follow. I followed it pretty much exactly except I did add some spices - paprika, ground mustard, onion powder and garlic powder. And for a twist, crumbled some bacon on top. It was great!

This was a HUGE hit with my whole family!!! I did follow the advice on here and added 3 cups Colby jack cheese, 1 cup milk, 1 1/2 cups evaporated milk, 1/2 cup finely diced sweet onion, 2 cloves garlic, 1 /2 tsp. salt, pepper to taste, and used crushed Ritz crackers instead of the bread crumbs. I also omitted the Parmesan from the sauce and threw it on the top with the crackers. It was SO rich and divine!!! My pickiest eater even asked for seconds! Definite keeper in our house!

I was kind of disappointed with this. My husband and I found it to be kind of bland so we added some salt and pepper, and that helped, but we were still left wanting more flavor. We also felt that it didn't have enough cheesy flavor to it. So I think I would make it again and try to add more cheese and some more seasoning. Good starting recipe though.

The recipe for the cheese sauce made this amazingly good. I added a touch of garlic (i add garlic to almost everything) but the parm cheese really makes this in my opinion. It gives a different and great cheese. Kudos for this recipe

I followed the recipe exactly and was just a little disappointed.  It sounded delicious but came out slightly drier than anticipated.  Also not quite as much cheese flavor as I would have assumed.  Definitely will not make exactly as the recipe states next time but good starting point.

I made this for dinner last night, and changed it up a bit b/c the 1st time I wasn't really impressed flavor wise. Last night I used 2 blocks of Cabot serioulsy sharp cheddar, that I shredded myself, and a stick of butter and extra flour. I stayed with the 3 cups of milk also. I used two large handfuls of grated pecorino ramono and added a little pepper one the sauce was ready. It was so creamy even after baking. I could have eaten the enitre pan myself.

Super yummy! However I doubled everything to make more but cut the milk in 1/2 because it was too watery.   The bread crumbs made the mac perfect!

This is great!! I made it for my fiance and I's first thanksgiving. :) I did alter it some, I used cheeze-its instead of bread crumbs and just crumbled them on top without adding butter to them and i also used about 1/4 cup finely diced onions. My fiance and family loved it!

I followed this recipe to the t and I'm not exactly sure what happened, but it did not turn out well.  Once the dish cools down a bit, it really goes downhill.  It wasn't very creamy and the texture just felt off.  I won't ever make it again, it sat in my fridge and nobody would eat it.  A complete waste of a lot of food.

I've made this recipe a few times now and every time I make it it turns out with a gritty texture. I think this is from the flour so I don't know if I just don't mix it in enough or if the flour should be reduced. So I'm now looking for a new mac and cheese recipe.

I added garlic to it because I figured it would be bland. It turned out perfect with like 4 cloves of garlic added to the sauce. Yum!

I made this last night and it was super yummy!  I thought for sure when I poured the cheese mixture over it, that it would be too runny.  It thickened up very nicely!  Since I used shells instead of elbows, I just stirred the macaroni to make sure the insides of the shells had cheese in them too.

Just how I make it!  I often will use cheese ends from deli for a variety of flavors.  Not to much mozzeralla though or any other flavor, an inexpensive way for change.  Expect you might need more butter/flour to the roux, I often use a little cream combined with mild (not so heart healthy),  One breadcrumbs (try Panko) are added I do not add additional butter or marg.

I did add more cheese, about two more cups and I used a 2% sharp cheddar. Out family likes a cheesy macaroni and cheese. I also used fat free evaporated milk. I added my own special touches that I add to every macaroni and cheese which are onion and garlic powder, a touch dijon mustard and a little Frank's hot sauce. My boys ate every bite. There's just something about macaroni and cheese that so simple but so wonderful every time.

Loved it!!  I made two batches, one with crumbled bacon, and they were huge hits. Fed about 12 guys and they killed it.  I took the member suggestion of using  1/2 c sour cream, 1/2 c milk and 2c ev.milk instead of 3c milk. Also added a few handfuls of shredded cheese, onion and garlic powder to the sauce. It didn't have enough cheese for us :) I seasoned the bread crumbs as well, and browned enough to fully cover the top. I didn't have any leftovers and we will be making this again! Thanks soo much for posting this!!!

I like my macaroni with a thick and creamy sauce, but this was a bit overload even for me. The problem wasn't that it was too thick, in fact I would prefer it even a bit thicker. I just felt it was simply too much sauce. It almost seemed like a thick cheese soup with a few noodles in it. Also, I didn't think the breadcrumbs needed the butter. Next time I'll use less milk and more noodles. I will also spread a bit more breadcrumbs on top. I used Italian breadcrumbs and I liked what it did to the flavor. Overall, I think this is a good foundation recipe to build on, but it definitely requires modifications to meet my taste.

I have heard people mention that if the reviews are all over the place, they skip the recipe.  This is one of those recipes.  Unlike others, the texture of mine turned out fine, but like some others said, it was bland.  I even added garlic and onion powders and salt and pepper to the roux - maybe not enough.

I have to say this was very good, but a little bland as well.  I added some onion and garlic to the mixture.  3 cups of milk was just a bit much, but you have to let it rest for a while after taking out of the oven (about 15 minutes) to thicken up.  I added Durkee's French Fried Onions instead of bread crumbs and the family ate it up!

This is perfect!  Only change I made was using Italian style bread crumbs, omitting the paprika and sprinkling a bit more Parmesan cheese on top  (I don't think its possible to have to much cheese)  be sure to use fresh Parmesan cheese not the kind from the shaker can.

This was good! Truth be told, my kids didn't meet any mac and cheese they didn't like, but this was creamy, tasty topping, not too hard to make and pleasing for the adults also. Great recipe, thanks for sharing.

Since I had most of the ingredients I thought I'd give this recipe a try.  I didn't have any bread crumbs but I did have some shredded mozzarella cheese so I threw that in with the rest of the cheeses.  I loved this dish and will make it again. I also added a dash of sour cream when I ate my second helping.  It was great.

I made this tonight for my boy who just got his tonsils out.  Here are a couple of things that I noticed with this recipe.  First, you need a whole lb of pasta this makes a ton of sauce.  Next you need to salt the water 2T for a lb of pasta.  I used 3 cups of already shreaded cheese and 1 cup of fresh grated pram.  I used 2T of flour in the rou, but I think 3T would have been better.  I also used salt and pepper in the sauce.  I omitted the bread crumbs on top. It only took 15 minutes in the oven not the 30.  Thanks for sharing.

I used some tips from others.  I did 1/2 cup evaporated milk, 1 cup of milk, 1/2 cup sour cream, 1/2 cup of half and half (mixed with the butter and flour).  I also used Mozzarella, Gorgonzola, Havarti and Extra Sharp Cheddar. I took my time like I was suppose to mixing constantly and adding in the liquids and cheese slow. It WAS AMAZING.  The gorgonzola gave it the kick some of the other reviews were lacking.  I also used the Panko Bread crumbs like suggested.  This was my first time making mac and cheese and what a success!

This really was good. I only gave it four stars though because I thought it needed to be creamier. I did us crumbled up french fried onions for the topping and it added a little more tast. All in all, a very tasty dish.

This is comfort food at its' best!! Thick, rich, and cheesy! Very easy to make, and just absolutely delicious! I added Velveeta to the sauce mixture to aide in the texture, and was outstanding. If you like Stouffers" Mac & Cheese, you'll love this!

I love this recipe!  a friend gave me basically the same recipe a long time ago.  I have tweaked it a bit.  I sauté some mushrooms (usually any that are on sale at the grocery store), I also sauté some chopped onions and add it to the cheese sauce before I put the noodles in.  I find this gives it a little more texture that I'm looking for.  I also not only put cheddar cheese in the sauce but also put in Colby and for an extra bite I use pepper jack cheese.  It's the perfect combination to me.  If I have it I'll add some white truffle oil to the cheese sauce.  It adds to the richness.  Next time I make it I'm going to substitute half and half cream for half of the milk required and see how that turns out.

I thought this recipe was O.K. Kinda a starter recipe. I used taco shredded cheese no parm. cheese 2 cups of milk, a can of cream of chicken and a medium to small onion. I did not add the bread crumbs. I sprinkled the paprika over the top and some extra shredded taco cheese. Made it for my sons picky autistic child's 9th birthday and it was all gone. His cousin, that never eats onions didn't even know it had onions till I told her and she still went back for more.

I have wanted to find and make a homemade Mac and Cheese for so long.  There was virtually  no learning curve and we just kept going back for more.  Keep the Salt and Pepper handy, because it needs it to bring out all the flavor.  Will me making this for many meals to come.

I am usually a little weary of making my own sauces...being a child of the instant sauce packet age. I gave this a shot anyway and it turned out wonderful.  I just took my time with the sauce and stirred it almost constantly...amazing what a little patience can do.  My husband and I were both thrilled with this simple homemade meal.

This was amazing - very cheesy.  I used real butter but substituted light cheese.  I added a garlic spice blend because others had said it was a little bland.  My daughter loved it; my son prefers the boxed mac&cheese!

This was pretty tasty - I used crumbled whole wheat toast for breadcrumbs, and LOTS of crushed hot red pepper instead of the paprika. I will probably use less milk next time.

Nice and cheesy but a tad bland, so I added 1 Tablespoon dijon mustard and a dash of garlic powder.  very nice!  Doubled well with no adjustments.  I also used two thirds skim milk and one third half and half because I like my mac and cheese very rich.  Probably could have gone even heavier for my tastes, but most folks probably would like it a little lighter.

I have made this macaroni and cheese several times because it is delicious! I add a little mozeralla cheese if I have some on hand. I always use more butter when browning the bread crumbs. I'm making a double batch for Thanksgiving. I'm going to sprinkle a little cheddar cheese on top before I add the bread crumbs and paprika. The secret to this recipe is the browned bread crumbs. Don't leave them off!

I used 1% milk and a mix of regular and panko breadcrumbs. Followed the recipe exactly otherwise, and this was a huge hit for Thanksgiving this year! Will be keeping this one in regular rotation.

Very easy recipe. I would recommend adding in your own blend of all purpose seasoning, garlic powder, and salt just before you pour the cheese sauce over the noodles. I tasted it without any seasoning and it tasted a little bland. Much more flavorful with some seasoning!

2 stars because my husband enjoyed it, but it was super bland, and the breadcrumbs while aesthetically pleasing, made the dish worse. If you like butter noodles, despise even the simplest spices -- go for it, this is for you. If you love a hearty, flavorful mac n cheese look elsewhere. Sooooo disappointed.

Yum!  I added 4 slices of bacon and 1/4 cup caramelized onions i had left over as well as the onion called for in the recipe.  I wish i had more bread crumbs because i loved the crunch.

I will be making this again.

Honestly? Love it. Great recipe, super good taste. The breadcrumbs (I actually used panko since I didn't have anything this else) had a nice crunch. Never made roux before so this was also a great learning experience. I'd totally recommend to friends and family.

Great recipe, I did reduce the milk by 1 cup and it was great..maybe because I only cooked 1 cup of pasta. 
Flavour came out much more as it sat, I'll add garlic next time!

Very cheesy! Better than the usual and so much better than the quickie boxed Mac and cheese. Next time will be even better because I won't forget to add the 1/2 c of parmesan. This dish really does need a nice crisp salad to go with it.

Very easy to make and really good and creamy. I will have some fun with it next time and use shredded Smoked Gouda for a change up.

Was worried about how much liquid it had before cooking, read the reviews and noticed the comments on not to worry.  It was still a little more watery than I prefer.  I have another recipe that is my fav, but didn't have all the ingredients so I went with this one.  This was ok, but will go back to my tried and true recipe.

This is a great recipe!  I didn't add paprika because I didn't have any. It said to use grated partisan cheese but I used shredded.  And used closer to 3 cups shredded sharp cheddar. It turned out really good!

Loved it!!! Waiting for the hubby to try it. I made it exactly as is and I didn't find it bland as others said. However I saw some interesting suggestions so next time I might try to add some seasonings and differ cheeses. I probably will either add more pasta or buy the big macaroni. I don't think there was enough. I tasted and saw the Parmesan which I didn't get but my husband loves Parmesan so I don't think it will matter. Can't wait to eat it again!!

This recipe was fairly easy to put together. I think the key is using good sharp cheddar and paying special attention to making the roux. Thanks for sharing.

Easy recipe to follow.  I took some of the other suggestions and used less milk.  I also added some garlic powder, paprika, cayenne pepper,  black pepper, and Worcestershire sauce to give it  some more flavor.  Will definitely use the recipe again.

So delicious! The sauce is runny but that's a good thing because it fills up all the noodles. I added a can of diced green chilies. The flavor is amazing. I highly recommend this recipe.

Made it for the first time last night.  I substituted 1/2 of the milk with the evaporated milk and added the 1 TBSP mustard powder, but other than that followed the recipe as stated.  We all thought that it was pretty good, but next time would only use the 1/2 TBSP mustard powder and add salt and pepper.  
Definitely will try again, but need to tune in the flavor to best fit our family's taste.

Everybody loved this! I didn't have any parmesan cheese, so I just used 3 cups of medium cheddar. I also used 5% light cream and a bit of evaporated milk instead of milk. I also substituted butter for margarine. I also added half a tub of onion and chives cream cheese.  This is a good base recipe. Next time I will add Green onions and bacon to step it up a notch and give the dish some colour.

I have made this at least 3 times. It is my "go to" mac and cheese and I'm asked for the recipe whenever I serve it. Yes, you panic at first when you see the amount of liquid, but it's exactly right. I have added dry mustard but don't taste much difference. For a super-rich, decadent version I use 1/2 and 1/2 for part of the milk. I always double the recipe and it perfectly fills a deep 13×9 baking pan.

Bland, bland, bland. I thought I must have forgotten something, but I didn't. I used sharp cheddar and fresh grated Parmesan. Even added a pinch of dry mustard and some grated nutmeg.  It had no flavor at all.

8 ounces was not enough macaroni. 3 cups of milk was way too much. Making it in the oven for the additional 30 minutes over cooked the noodles.

I baked it for only 15 mins and then let it sit for another 15-20 mins and it firmed up nicely. I also top mine with more cheese, bread crumbs and I mix in bacon, salt & pepper. I used a mix blend of cheese. I used 2 bags. 1.5 in the mix and the rest on top. It was delicious. If you find it too bland, do what I did and add some extra flavor such as salt, pepper, paprika, bacon, etc.

I add about 6 cups of cheese total for a double recipe. Found it to add some moisture and deliciousness. OH! and Try a few dashes of Franks Red Hot Sauce and a little mustard! Also, I pour the sauce into the pot that I have the drained cooked pasta sitting in then mix before pouring into baking dish. Great recipe , worth the effort!!

Great, great, great recipe. Don't think you're limited to just Parmesan and cheddar cheeses, either. I like to add in a little mozzarella, Monterrey jack, pepperjack, whatever I feel like, really.

Also, I like to mix it up by reducing the milk to 1 1/2 cups. using a cup of heavy whipping cream, and a tablespoon or so each of cream cheese and sour cream. You can play around bunch and it still comes out super creamy and delicious.

Lastly, Ritz crackers instead of breadcrumbs is fantastic (or a combination of both!)

This is so good! I will say that it is probably more of a "southern" style recipe. I say this because it seems like in the South mac and cheese is very creamy. One moderation I would make is to add a little bit of salt before popping it in the oven. The paprika sprinkled on top produces a lot of flavor! Also the parmesan will make it a lottle grainy, so you may want to substitute another cheese.

After seeing how great this was rated I just had to try it! I am very disappointed to say the least. It's very bland and does not have nearly of a cheesy flavor one would expect from a Mac and Cheese dish. I definitely will not make again.

Very good. Made for my son's teacher lunch at preschool. Additions I made-
Doubled everything, lots of pepper, minced garlic, 1/2 tsp dijon, parsley in the bredcrumbs, and put under the broiler for about 3 minutes at the end.

I made this recipe with a few modifications...

My husband eats gluten-free, so I made it with gluten-free rotini (which I had on hand), and gluten-free flour for the roux.  I thought it would taste a little rice-ish, but it was just fine.

I shred my own cheese, so I used a block of cheddar cheese for that, and your standard Parmesan cheese.  I can't help but think that if I had actually had some shredded Parmesan on hand, it would've been a bit tastier.  The Parmesan seemed to get lost in the recipe.

I agree with the addition of mustard.  It gives it a nice tang that cuts through the ultra-cheesy flavor.

All in all?  A keeper.  I will be making this mac 'n cheese again!

Great mac n' cheese dish! I've used this recipe for a couple of years, and it's a huge hit for my wife and kids. For a richer and more savory dish, throw in some bacon, and use some extra cheese (I like Gouda for a more "grown-up" flavor). I don't believe mac n' cheese can be too cheesy.

I loved this recipe. I made it exactly as listed. I'd never made Mac and cheese with parmesan cheese and I thought it was delicious. I made sure I used only 8 oz of pasta so it would not be dry with too much pasta. It came out so creamy. I will make my Mac and cheese like this from now on. Thanks for a wonderful recipe

Mac and cheese should be simple and tasty - this recipe delivers.  I'm a single dad so it's about simplicity. I served it with a head of lettuce - kids and I spooned the mac&cheese into a lettuce leaf for amazing contrasts: crunchy + soft, hot + cold, decidant + healthy. I used panko breadcrumbs and got a great result.

My family didn't really eat it.  I can pack it for leftovers and be ok, but they were right: The noodles were mushy ("cook according to package" - I did), and the sauce was grainy.  I think it was grainy because some of the bread crumbs sink into the sauce, which is really soupy pre-oven.  My husband wanted it creamier and less casserole-ish.  I did utilize the tip about adding some ground mustard, and stirred in some garlic powder as well (like 1/4 tsp).  Glad I did, or it would have been bland.

I will try this again with a lot of tweaks.

My men loved this easy recipe.  I wish I had seen the tip about 8 oz. of macaroni equaling 1 3/4 cups, before I cooked this. I was confused by what 8 oz was and ended up having to boil more macaroni when I had way too much cheese sauce.  Not a problem though.  Like others, I thought the sauce was a bit bland so I added dry mustard, salt, pepper, onion powder, garlic powder and a pinch of paprika.  I'll be making this again for sure.

The kids were hungry so i skipped the breadcrumbs and baking it. I cooked it on the good ole' stove top. I also did not have any flour but it still came out great. The kids loved it and I felt good giving it to them and not the crappy chemically ridden boxed stuff. I grew up on it too but why even bother when you can make this so easily at home? If I have time to leave this review then I have time to make home made mac n cheese. I even sprinkled in a little bit of some shredded mozz cheese I had left over. Very yummy.

TWEEK TWEEK TWEEK, hence the 4 stars, deserves 10! Who needs butter when you have bacon fat? Lol. I used jalapeño jack & some gruyere instead of cheddar and added a pinch of fresh ground nutmeg! So very yummy! I made this on the stove with some great fun shaped pasta called Lumaconi (large snail shape), lots of places for cheesy goodness to hide in. I served this with bbq pork tacos. Thank you Judy, this is a Keeper ;)

Great recipe.  I added more elbow macaroni (12 oz) but keep the rest the same.  I did add some onion powder and garlic salt and it was great.  i didn't have any breadcrumbs but didn't miss it.  As I said it was great.  I'm going to get so fat.  ^-^

I got so tired of the same old boxed mac&cheese i thought i'd give this recipe a whirl. woohoo. i'm such a good cook, well, good at following directions to this wonderful recipe. The sauce was so creamy and rich. I added minced garlic with the bread crumbs (I actually used "panko") and it created a great layer on top. It was such a big hit. I will most definitely make this dish again.

we love this dish!  it's so tasty as leftovers too.  as far as people saying it's bland, I don't have that problem.  perhaps it's the type of cheese they are using.  I use block cheddar cheese & parmesan.  I shred it in the food processor.  I think the preshredded cheese is not as flavorful.

This was Amazing!  I made this for my Daughter's 3rd BDay.  I am one that looks at a recipe and switches or adds things to it.  With this recipe I only added Ham to it, this made it over the top Amazing!  I cut the Ham in small cubes added it to the boiling water of the noddles, I don't know if that does anything, but when I make it again I will do the same thing.

This is a great recipe.  It is similar to my mom's over 50 years ago!! We used canned evaporated skim milk in ours and it was very rich and creamy.  Also, I like tomato slices on the top.  Yum Yum Yum. Thanks for this recipe reminder that I had just forgotten over the years.

This was very yummy and my husband said it was just like his mom used to make. I used the entire 16oz box of macaroni and added 1/2 teaspoon of pepper to the cheese mixture. I also upped the breadcrumbs to 3/4 cup as we both like the crunchy topping. I think next time I'll add more cheese to the top and maybe some garlic salt.

I found this recipe Really helpful and when I made it, it turned out perfect! There was only one thing I changed and it was that I used 1 ½ c. Half and Half and 1 ½ c. Milk instead of just 3 cups of milk. But other than that it turned out very nice. I love to cook and I will highly recommend this recipe to Anyone that wished to make some good homemade Mac & Cheese. The bread crumbs gave it a nice crisp on the top but it wasn’t too overpowering. When I made this for my family, they kept going back for more and that night I wished I made multiple servings of this spectacular dish. I also didn’t mix the butter with the bread crumbs because I didn’t feel like it was necessary to add more fattening things when 2 c. of cheese was already added. I simply sprinkled the breadcrumbs over the top before baking!

It came out delicious! The only things i did differently was that i added only about 2 1/4 cups of milk, i added a bit of mustard, and i also sprinkled some more cheddar and parmesan on top of the dish, right before i added the breadcrumbs. Everyone in my house loved it!

I've been making this recipe for our family for at least 6 years and we still love it!  I used to make it exactly as written and it was WONDERFUL!!!  Over the years, however, I decided to add a bit here and there to see how it would be.  I added 1 cup more cheddar, 1/4 cup more parm, 2 cups of shredded mozzarella, 1 tsp garlic powder, and 1/4 tsp dry mustard.  PERFECTION!!!  And to make it a meal instead of a side dish, I'll add in 1 pound of diced, cooked ham.  WE LOVE THIS!!

Happy cooking!!! :)

Pretty good. Needed a little more spice for flavor. Add black pepper, salt, paprika, and garlic.

I'm not a big mac & cheese lover so I'm probably a tougher critic than most.  This was OK, just like the note next to the 3 stars reads.  It was OK.  I accidentally added 2c 2% milk, not 3c.  After tasting, it was a good mistake.  I added 1t dry mustard & 1/2t salt, but it was still pretty bland.  Someone added a cup more cheese.  That could be all it needed.  The topping helps appearance, but that's about it.  'Could take it or leave it.  I used a 9x13 & it was on the shallow side so if you want more of the baked top, go for it.  I'll use a 9x11 next time.  I cooked a whole pound of elbows so there'll be another mac & cheese review in my future.  :/  ;D

I'm giving this five stars!  It was delicious and it was easy enough for my 12 and 10 year old to make it by themselves, simply following the directions here without any help at all.  Thanks for a simple, easy to follow recipe!

I absolutely love this recipe! it's so creamy and delicious. When I baked it, I made it a bit too dry. So I decided to just make the sauce and pour it on the noodles and eat it that way instead and it was awesome. This recipe definitely beats the box brand

Turned out great! I added onion powder and garlic salt to add extra flavor I also added mozzarella cheese (because there's no such thing as too much cheese!). Everyone loved it and it was super filling. I'll definitely be making this again!!

I followed this recipe except I didn't have any Parmesan so I substituted 1/2 cup of sharp cheddar cheese. It turned out a bit bland but we had it for dinner last night.

My bf added a little salt to his portion, we put it in the fridge overnight, we had it for lunch today and it was a bit dry after we zapped it in the microwave so my bf and I added milk to our portions.

Next time I will add a bit of salt and use Parmigiano-Reggiano ( the kind that comes in a block and you need to grate and not the kind in a container) and follow the recommendations of the other reviewers here. 

This is not a bad recipe, I will also follow the recommendations of the reviewers to make it more creamy. It's mac and cheese and it's not as if we eat this often. Think of this as a basic recipe to start from and then tweak it to your own taste.

We made this for Thanksgiving and really liked it. I followed the recipe exactly, although I did use whole wheat pasta because that was all I had. I was concerned that the sauce didn't thicken, but it turned out perfectly. I will use less butter and/or reduced fat cheese next time as we thought it a tad oily. Great recipe! Will definitely make again and again!

I don't usually leave reviews, but felt I had to after making this dish for my boyfriend last night. It turned out pretty bad - very mushy and grainy (almost curdled in texture) bc of the Parmesan cheese. I don't know why anyone hasn't mentioned this, but the macaroni should be undercooked before putting it in the oven, bc it continues to cook while in the oven for 30 min and ends up really mushy! The overall taste was pretty bland too, considering all the cheese in there (sharp cheeses, like old cheddar and parm, no less!). The bread crumbs were weird, nice and crunchy in parts but mostly just got absorbed into the body of the dish...would consider adding when casserole is almost cooked, for like the last 10 min to get an actual crispy crust. Very disappointing - would not make again :(

This is pretty basic mac & cheese. But somehow it does turn out very creamy and delicious!! I think it might be the addition of the parmesan cheese. But it is truly yummy. For those looking for that missing little "something", try adding a dash of freshly grated nutmeg into your cheese sauce. It adds that subtle yet impressive 'wow' factor that some of you seem to be missing in this recipe.

I have been searching for an easy and delicious Mac & Cheese for a long time and found this one in my e-mail In-Box. It was SO good! I used all the exact amounts given, and tweaked in this way: I use skim milk in almost everything but knew this needed to be somewhat creamy, so I used 3/4 C Half-n-Half and the remaining 2 1/4 C Skim milk. I also added a little nutmeg to the sauce. For the cheese (which in my opinion is EVERYTHING in a Mac & Cheese) I used 1 Cup Extra Sharp Wisconsin Cheddar and 2 Cups Sharp NY Cheddar . The Parm was FRESH Reggiano - makes a huge difference. I was concerned because my sauce didnt seem to thicken enough (even after stirring a good 25 minutes) but I re-checked the video and saw the sauce was quite liquid so I went with it. It must thicken as it bakes. The other important characteristic is the TOPPING - I used Panko crumbs in place of bread crumbs and made sure they were nicely toasted. They added that wonderful cruch everyone loves on a M&C. Great recipe and great website.

I split the 3 cups of  milk with half and half.. So creamy!  I also add some onions (fresh or flakes) to the butter and cook them.. A little cayenne pepper gives it a kick.. Lately instead of the parm cheeseI have been throwing in some Asiago cheese.  It's a great recipe

I just made a non-dairy version of this and my sauce is already very thick just from melting the cheese, can't imagine what it will be like once I bake it...looking forward to it!!!  I followed another reviewers suggestions and added the dry mustard, onion and garlic powder, a little salt, pepper and seasonall....DELICIOUS!!!  Thanks for the recipe

I made this last night and I have to say that is was, unfortunately, really bland. I did add dry mustard powder, but it was not enough to add any flavor. This dish definitely needs some salt and some other spices, otherwise it is incredibly bland. Even my husband - who loves most homemade Mac and Cheese recipes I've tried, only had a few bites due to it lacking flavor. So if you make this, make sure and add some salt & other spices you like (and a pinch of salt, which is what I added, won't do it).

Great, easy recipe. This is the mac'n cheese I always wanted! Very cheesy and creamy. As Julie stated, it looked a bit runny when I poured the sauce over the macaroni, but it firmed up as it baked. I used buttered Panko breadcrumbs which workwd well. Also added just a touch of garlic salt, 2 1/2 cups of milk and a small can of evaporated milk instead of 3 cups of milk (also a tsp of Dijon mustard for some additional tanginess). This is a total keeper!

I followed this recipe to the T. Slightly lacking in flavor but I think it was the weird lumpy texture that bothered me more. It was a little runny too.

Great method. I had to give only 4 stars bc i used 16oz of pasta, only 2.5 cups of milk, and I also added a pinch of paprika. I used Cabot seriously sharp white cheddar & Kraft white American singles. Mine turned out exactly as I imagined. I didn't want to add any garlic, mustard or anything like that; I agree with a previous poster that the cheese should be the star here. Great process, and it baked to perfection with a beautiful golden crust. TIPS: if you're not gonna add any spices, salt the water for pasta & use salted butter. Make your roux and cheese sauce on med-low heat.

I made this recipe for my granddaughter's 5th birthday dinner.  I used the variations mentioned by others: evaporated milk and sour cream along with milk to create a creamy sauce. I added mustard as suggested and, for additional flavor, added a half pound of cooked and crumbled bacon. I wanted to use good cheeses so decided on 1 cup of white Cheddar, and 1 cup of smoked Gruyere along with shaved Parmesan. I did use panko on the top. The smoked Gruyere was a good combination with the bacon and this was a hit! I will definitely make this again.

My friend and I made this mac and cheese one evening along with ribs, mashed potatoes, and dinner rolls. Mmm, it sure hit the spot. We followed this recipe spot on, except with two subsitutions. We fried bacon and chopped that up and sprinkled it in there. We baked that for 20 minutes then topped it with some Frenchs Fried Onions. Then baked 5-7 more minutes. Needless to say it was divine!

Calls for way too much milk. I ended up adding much more flour and cheese to thicken up the sauce a good bit. It was still macaroni soup, but at least it was thick macaroni soup. Even if I hadn't added the extra flour and cheese, there would've been as much sauce as macaroni.

I'm a mom of four who is trying to cook home meals more often and I was so disappointed by the lack of flavor. I took the advice if one of the other reviewers and doubled and saved for later. Its in the fridge cause I don't want to throw away, but no one wants to eat it, not my hungry husband, not my mac and. cheese loving kids. What a waste of macaroni noodles, cheese, and my time.

This is my go to macaroni and cheese recipe. I only gave it four stars because I've customized it to my preferences. I use mild instead of sharp cheddar and I add seasoning salt before baking. its so tasty.

This was good! Pretty easy and basic mac and cheese.  I did have to season it a bit- 2 tsp Worcestershire sauce, 1 tsp salt and pepper, 1/2 tbsp onion powder.

The first time I made this recipe, I followed the directions exactly and was very pleased! It was rich and flavorful, but the sauce was not as creamy as I would have liked after baking. The second time around I used 12 oz of fat free evaporated milk and 12 oz of regular fat free milk because other users recommended it for a creamier sauce. The sauce was also taking a super long time to thicken so I used cornstarch to speed things up. I also added extra cheese, and used a mix of aged cheddar, gruyere, and parmesan. I added ground mustard, onion and garlic powders, and some white pepper for extra flavor. This is a great recipe to play around with-- as long as you follow the basic directions you can really add whatever flavors you like. Thank you for sharing!

Wow! Great recipe. Also even better with these additions: 1 tsp dry mustard, 1/4 tsp onion powder, Italian blend cheese instead of parm, and for the 3 cups of milk I used 1 cup sour cream, I cup evaporated milk, and 1 cup skim milk. Amazing! Even my pickiest child gobbled up 2 servings. Keeper recipe for sure!

Absolutely delicious! I added a little more cheese and used half & half to give it a richer taste. It tasted even better the second day. Tasted like the kind my grandma use to make.

Made a couple of additions to kick up the flavor: used 1/2 cheddar, 1/2 double gloucester w/chives as the main cheeses. Added a couple dashes of garlic powder, onion powder, white pepper and chili powder to the milk/cheese mixture which gave it extra taste. Topped with 1/2 breadcrumbs & 1/2 panko for more crunch. Oh, and used campanelle pasta, which is what I had in the cupboard. Husband loved it. Delicious, quick, easy, homey meal (NOT low in fat, which is the whole point of mac and cheese!)

I combined this recipe with another I found online and tweaked it a bit. This version is definitely not for someone counting calories. I used a full stick of butter and three large spoonful’s of flour for the roux, I used 1.5 cup heavy cream and 1.5 cup milk as well as the 2 cup grated sharp cheddar cheese and .5 cup grated parmesan for the sauce. I used 16oz box of cavatappi for the macaroni. I added a .25 cup of mixed fresh herbs, a combination of parsley, tarragon, rosemary and chives. Also a .25 cup chopped green onion, 4 strips of cooked bacon also chopped up, I pored the cheese sauce over everything and mixed into a casserole dish. I cooked 1lb of steak tips marinated in steakhouse sauce with rosemary, cut them into smaller pieces and stuffed them into the mac and cheese. I used crushed ritz crackers and butter for the crust over the top and bakes for 20min at 350 degree.

Tried this tonight for dinner and it is really good. I used a combo of medium cheddar and monterey jack cheese. I topped with crushed croutons (cheese/garlic) and grated cheese. The kids loved it with ketchup lol. I added a little Franks Red Hot to mine and it was pretty good for my first attempt. I would definitely make this again maybe using different cheeses (and little more cheese-not the submitters fault as I didn't measure my pasta cheese ratio). Thanks this will definitely be made again in my house! :)

I've made it twice now, and yes, it's thin going into the oven...too thin to put the topping on!  So I baked it 1/2 way, until it firmed on top, then put the topping.  But what I don't like is that the topping mixes in when serving and eating.  You can't really get a nice, creamy bite without buttery bread crumbs!  Anyone else have this problem?

Great mac n cheese!! My husband and I loved it.  I used my food processor to shred mild cheddar cheese. I didn't add any parmesan cheese.  I added sour cream like some of the other reviews stated & ritz crackers as a topping. I look forward to eating left overs tomorrow!

The mac and cheese is good, but I didn't like breadcrumbs for the topping. I think a cracker crust would be better. The breadcrumbs made it a little gritty. I would also consider adding some more seasoning, for example, some dry mustard and black pepper.

I thought this went together quickly and easily.  I omitted the parmesan and just replaced it with more cheddar.  I also omitted the bread crumb topping since the hubs doesn't love it.  My entire family scarfed it down!  Yum!

I had all the ingredients to make this except for the cheddar cheese. In place of the cheddar I used 2 cups of Jarlsberg and the 1/2 cup of parm. It came out great! Very creamy and mild flavored. A big hit with my 5 year old and picky husband.

I did not think it was worth the time to make this dish. It tasted ok but the texture of the sauce was off.

I'm sorry but I had to give only 1 star , literally just finished a very small bowl.  It was not creamy at all , very bland and someone stated it tasted like flour and butter and that was correct in my experience. Still trying to find a very good Mac n cheese recipe after years and years . One that uses a roux can be delicious , I think in this case it's the cheese , I'm going to try a gruyere and cream instead of milk , bummer :(

This is awesome! You know i is good when the left overs are almost as good as the day of! Usually when you reheat leftovers, it drys out, not this mac and cheese and has great flavor! My family's new favorite.

This is the best homemade mac and cheese for how simple it is!! I also subbed a little mozz and jack. Super-yummy with leeks, garlic powder, a touch of hot sauce, 1 can of green chiles & grated zucchini! I added a decent amount of the grated zucc as I had tons from the garden and wanted to "heath up" the dish a bit. It didn't get watery or throw off the texture at all.

I actually enrolled so I could comment on this. Flavor is OK...but the sauce is ridiculous. It makes WAY too much...Not even really a thin issue, as I added extra flour...Followed the rest of it to the letter. RIDICULOUS. I served my famille macaroni and cheese soup, and was desperately glad we did NOT have company.(Should have gone with my gut on the milk lol!!!)

This is definetly a crowd favorite at our house.  What is nice with this recipe is that you don't have to be exact with the cheese measurements.  I do not like cottage cheese, but love this recipe.

This for me was just ok.  I thought that the sauce after baking was kind of lumpy, not as creamy as I would have liked.  Although my kids did really enjoy it.  Also thought that it was lacking flavor.

I made a gluten free version of this by using gf noodles I had left over from other recipes... I used rice flour - next time I'll use 3 table spoons because it's a little runny, I'm sure tomorrow it will be great, though. I added some mozzarella cheese as well, and used rice Chex for the bread crumb on the top... I didn't fry it in butter, though.

Very yummy, quick and easy. I added salt, pepper, and a bit of dry mustard.  I also added romano and american cheeses as well.  I kept the left over sauce to make an alfredo with linguini later in the week.  I also used cinnamon butter to saute the bread crumbs.

My family loves this recipe, especially the three year old.  It is the only Mac and Cheese he will eat!  The only variation I make, is I add dry mustard to the cheese mixture.  It gives it that extra big of flavor.

Yummy!
My secret to a brilliant white/cheese sauce is white pepper, it makes such a difference! Adding a pinch of cayenne pepper and a few grinds of black pepper finish it off.

I did tweak some as others did.  I used a lb of large shells since I was making for 6 ppl. I used 2 cups of milk, 1 cup of rf sour cream, 1 stick of rf butter, sharp white cheddar and Romano cheese, and topped with hot paprika. It was pretty good and my guests really like it, but I do think it lacked some flavor. I did salt the pasta before I put the sauce on but next time it needs more I think.

It was a decent meal, quick and easy with little mess. Kids enjoyed it especially, however, i cant necessarily say i didnt edit the recipe. when searching for this recipe i had origanally cooked ground beef so i added that and for extra flavour i added tomato soup and diced tomatos. delicious. =P

Left out the parmesan cheese and reduced the cheddar cheese by a 1/2 cup. Added some ham.  The family loved it!  Best homemade Mac and Cheese recipe we've tried.  Thanks for sharing!

We loved this as a base recipe.  We tweaked it by using a cheese blend, cheddar, swiss, montery jack, parm (the fresh not powdey-ish) and then we added diced plum tomatoes, broccoli and sliced mushrooms. RARELY are there leftovers, even with a double batch.

very good cheesy flavor, not to much of a overly sharp cheese taste that most home made mac and cheeses have. creamy and smooth not over clumpy.

this turned out wonderful! it was easy to make! don t be worried of the sauce does not thicken up right away it will!  I added some onion to the bread combs which was a nice touch.  Also i added two slices of pepper jack cheese to give it a little kick!

Mine turned out dry and bland, not creamy as other said.  Don't do this ahead of time as sauce gets absorbed into noodles.  Had to reheat it by adding water.  Don't think the parmesan adds much.  I won't make this again.  Just use butter and velveeta.

I increased the amount of noodles and used the cheeses that I had available, but it came out so creamy, I love a creamy mac and cheese.  :) I did mess up on the bread crumb topping, so it was ugly, but very tasty!

I loved this recipe, it is super easy and fun to make with a friend, pair with a side salad and you are golden. We added a few chicken breasts cut up, and put it on top of the mac and cheese prior, and then topped with parmesan cheese and the bread crumbs. This it grreat! also.... instead of store bought bread crumbs, we just toasted wheat bread and cut it up finally, and then browned it. I think this is a better texture, just sayin..

This is a great starter recipe. It has all the components for a basic mac n cheese, which really allows you to get creative in jazzing it up. I cut out the milk and used half sour cream and water mix. I also put some minced garlic in my bread crumbs which really set this dish over the top. Your house will smell amazing after baking this.

This was just OK for me. My husband loved it but I also made a separate batch for him with chopped kielbasa in it. I think that gave it better flavor. I also used sharp cheddar cheese but think I'd sprinkle some on top next time.

This was a wonderful recipe. The only things I changed were to add black pepper and salt while making the sauce. Thanks for such a wonderful recipe!

I followed the recipe exactly, but my cheese sauce had grainy texture.  I wish the recipe would go into more detail in how to melt the cheese properly so I don't end up with this funny texture.

A hit with the kids.  I did add a some dry mustard to the cheese sauce.  I thought the cheese sauce was a little thin but thickened up nicely in the oven as stated by other reviews.  I will definately be making this again.

I gave it 4 stars, because I made some changes to the recipe.   I followed the advice of some other posters.   Here are the changes I made:
added 8 oz. Mont. Jack cheese and 2 cups of cheddar, 1 cup milk, 1 1/2 cups evaporated milk, generous sprinkling of garlic powder and onion powder, 1 /2 tsp. salt, pepper to taste, plus I added 1/2 block of cream cheese.

It did thicken but not immediately. Seemed a little bland so it has potential to be kicked up a notch.

wow easy and delicious. I didn't even follow all the directions and it was still good. ( I was really hungry and couldn't wait for it to bake so I just ate it once I combined the cheese sauce and macaroni.) also, I was out of milk but had some buttermilk on hand so I used that and it worked out as a sub.

I made this for ten people, aged 1 year to 58 and everyone except for one (broccoli hater) loved it. I took this basic recipe and added to it though - while adding the milk to the roux I included garlic pepper, garlic and onion powder, celery seed and white pepper to taste. I had also already cut up fresh chives and dill to add, and had fresh broccoli steaming to add to the cheese sauce.   I too was afraid of there being too much sauce. I used a half a cup less milk than suggested for the larger serving and accidentally filled the baking dish completely full, with still about a cup and a half extra sauce (now in the fridge). It boiled up a bit but did not boil over, and the texture came out perfect!   My older sister, whom I look up to for cooking, praised it --- and that's the best sign right there.

So I'm actually baking the Mac and cheese right now. And I've had to keep it in the oven for longer than 30 minutes. When I heard that it was very liquidy, I wasn't aware that it was sooooo soupy! But im hoping for it to turn out so delicious (like other reviewers have claimed to say). I can't exactly rate it, since I haven't even eaten it yet, but I'm sure it will taste good

This was wonderful mac and cheese.  I use 1 can of condensed milk and added just a bit of water to it for the milk.  Did not add the parm cheese into the cheese sauce but I did add it with the bread crumbs in the topping.  This was a hit at my house.

The consistency was fine, but the cheese sauce was bland.  I would double the amount of cheddar if I ever decided to make it again, and add some more spices.  I also used whole wheat elbows to try to make this a little healthier, and it ended up tasting like cardboard soaked in flour and milk. May try it again someday with a few variations.

Excellent base recipe. I made this exactly as the directions state and it came out excellent. The only thing is it was a lil bland. I will definitely use recipe again but will use more cheese and add my seasonings of choice.

I love this recipe.  I made it for the first time a few weeks ago for my boyfriend, and I couldn't believe how easy it was and delicious! It was so good, I've been craving it and had to make it again.  I did find the sauce the first time a bit runny, but I'm not sure if I made the sauce right.  This time I made it with 2 1/4 cups of milk and it was nice and thick.  Either way, I love this recipe and will make it again and again!

This was sooo good! My favorite part of Thanksgiving dinner! When preparing it I freaked out when I combined the cheese and pasta, thinking there was too much sauce and was about to drain some of it out, but didn't. Thank Goodness, because I didn't figure in the sauce thickening up. It was perfect after baking. The only thing I didn't care too much for was the breadcrumbs on top, it was too much, I should have halved the crumbs just to give it a little something. But this will be my recipe forever more!

I'll reiterate what others have said: this is a very good base recipe, but really needs something else. I followed the recipe exactly, other than substituting whole wheat zoo-shaped pasta for macaroni. I also thought salt was lacking, so I added about 1/2-1 tsp. BUT it needs more. I'll make it again, but try adding more salt, maybe some ground mustard, and doing half-cheddar, half smoked gouda because this is really, really BLAND. The texture was okay, a bit clumpy/cottage cheesey in the end, but I think that's what happens when you don't use velveeta. On the bright side, it has 94% of your daily calcium... (great for preggies and toddlers who aren't worried about gaining weight!)

Me and my finace loved this dish! I mixed it up a little but adding a scoop of minced garlic and used broiled sourdough bread instead of breadcrumbs. It gave it more of a buttery goodness on top without taking away from the pasta itself.

I cooked the cheese sauce a little longer and let it thicken up before I poured it in the pan. I also added some chopped onions and ham. It came out excellent!!!

Very good recipe! But, honestly, I ALWAYS make at least 1 1/2 to 2 times the cheese sauce when making any mac & cheese. This way it never dries out, and it's just as good the next day. All's I know is, my fam always loves and comes back for more!

Used quinoa pasta, gouda/parmesan/cheddar cheese mix, rice milk + some plain yogurt, butter/coconut oil mix (a bit sweet), and added spices: paprika, cayenne, nutmeg, cumin, garlic. Made with tuna and baked with chips on top at 350 for 25 min. Girls loved it!

Yummy!  The only thing I did different was add chicken.  I got chicken and put it in the crock pot and added cream of chicken.  After a few hours I made the Mac and Cheese and added the chicken and put it in the oven.  It was great!  I will make it again.

Awesome recipe! We thought it was a little to much Parmesan. Try 1/4 cup Parmesan and add 1 very well whisked egg white to it when you stir it all in the casserole dish. Awesome!!!

Loved it! I used fusilli pasta, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. It was what I was looking for in mac and cheese...rich, tasty and had a nice crust on the bottom, sides and top. I might try using an extra sharp Cheddar sometime, but it was great with sharp Cheddar and Parmesan.

I made this with the intention of serving 5 people and having some leftover but everyone liked it so much that it didn't make it into the fridge.   Right at the end I turned the stove up and broiled some of the cheese on top so it would get nice and crunchy.  Server it with a Chicken ranch salad and it was loved.   Thanks for the recipe!

I must say that I followed the recipe exactly the same with the exception that i added more cheese and it came out to bland. Had no flavor at all. Hopefully my family will eat it because I made a whole lot.

So we've made this recipe as is sooo many times;but my daughter likes to add her own touches such as a (quite) a few splashes of hot sauce not enough to make it spicy, but just enough to give it the slightest tang. Also we use a wide variety of cheeses...white chedddar, montery jack, parrano (like parm but a bit softer),asiago, blue cheese...whatever they have as a sample @ wholes foods when we go to get the pasta(really good w/bow tie pasta...whole grain) & the stalks of two heads of broccoli cubed(daughter not a fan of the tops)plus b/c I can't have a meal w/o it garlic...

I couldn't get my cheddar to melt completely, but this was still delicious!  It was not very creamy because of the cheese problem, a little dry.  However, I used crushed Rice Krispies on the top (didn't fry in the pan) and it made this so good!!  It's also really good reheated!

I love this recipe. I added cubed ham in the sauce while I was cooking it and then with the bread crumbs I added French's Fried onions to the crumbs in a ziplock bag and crushed it with a rolling pin. And just add to the top. It came out excellent! Yum! Yum!

This was amazing! I made this dish for my parents and they went crazy!  It fills you up, and yet it is light and satisfying.  This is sure not Easy Mac!!!  Next time I might try putting a garlic clove in when you make the cheese sauce.  This recipe is amazing! Great job, Judy!

I really liked this mac and cheese and so did my kids! I messed up though and put in shredded parmesan instead of grated parmesan. That gave it a little bit of a gritty texture. So, lesson learned, next time Ill use grated parmesan. I also added some salt and garlic. It was delicious!

Awsome recipe !  I used the recipe as a guide and used 1 10oz stick of Cracker Barrel extra sharp white, 1 1/4 cup- reggiano and 1 1/2 cup shredded mozz. To the base sauce I added a good dash of Colemans dry mustard, a few shakes onion powder, garlic powder and a hefty dose of parsley flakes. Finishing the sauce I added 6 slices chopped crisp bacon. A GREAT recipe to get creative with, the possibilities are endless!!!!!!!!!

God forgive me, but I raised my kids on boxed mac and cheese. This recipe is very good, and the kids were disbelieving that mac and cheese that doesn't come from a box was much much better than their old favorite. Now I have to make it all the time. It is well worth it.

This was really good, creamy and easy to make! My only complaint is that I thought it had too much bread crumbs on top- and the paprika really doesn't do anything for it, just color.  Overall, this was good though and I would make it again with less breadcrumbs. This is what home-made is supposed to taste like!

This was good considering I wanted a recipe that did NOT have velveeta or cream.  However, I also found it a little bland.  (Probably for that reason)  If I'm going to go through the effort of making a mac&chz, I'm going to stick with the 4chz macaroni from this site or ina garden's macaroni recipe on the Food Network (w/ gruyere and cheddar.... OMG!).  I'll stick with the blue box for quick and easy.  Thanks, though!

This mac n' cheese was one of I had ever had! It wasn't really creamy but I like my mac n' cheese a little dry and heavily brown on the top but not brunt. Thats my preference but it didn't come out like that so I left it in a little.It was excellent, my father loved it and i was suprised because he only eats jamican food. I would most certainly recommend this recipie

To add a healthy kick without fuss, I swapped out 1/2 the pasta for cauliflower and half the breadcrumbs for wheat germ!

This was okay. Nothing special. My kids didn't like it but we adults ate it. It was a nice change but I probably wont make it again.

I am a new cook, I made this recipe for me and my husband, it was very easy but I was disappointed, it did not have much flavor and was bland, I will use the basics for this recipe again but spice it up next time. The bread crumbs on top were great.

Pretty good mac n' cheese.  My fiance really liked it.  I followed it exactly per the instructions.  I used the Kraft grated parmesean, it probably would have tasted even better if I had used fresh grated parm.  I would def make again.  Also, I would probably skip the step of melting butter for the bread crumbs.

I was glad to see that I had everything on hand for this, that is the main reason why I picked it over some similar recipes. One thing about the way it printed out it that you read the ingredients from left to right and then down to the next row. I didn't realize this and accidently used 1/4 c butter for the roux instead of the few tbsp it was supposed to be. I'm not sure how this affected the results. The texture was fine but like others have said it was a bit bland, even after adding salt, pepper, and garlic powder to the cheese sauce. I did not brown the breadcrumbs because of a lack of time and I didn't want to use another 1/4 butter, too much fat!  To help with the blandness I added some bacon salt after cooking. This is a wonderful, fat free, kosher, low sodium, and vegan seasoning that really tastes just like bacon.  This did just the trick and it tasted great.

I made some changes that I thought would help with the blandness some people mentioned. To the cheese sauce, I added a little bit of garlic powder, seasoned salt, and nutmeg. I added 1/2 cup sour cream for even more creaminess, and I also added 1 T of yellow mustard. It gives that tang that I want with cheese. Other than that, I followed the instructions, and it was delicious! It does seem like too much sauce, but as others said, it's perfect when it's done!

I've been using this recipe for years, it's the best. Sometimes I add a few diced tomatoes. It's the breadcrumb crust that makes it extra special.

I saute chopped onions, add dry powdered mustard, salt and pepper before I add the flour. Then add milk and heat and stir, adding lots and lots of grated old cheddar cheese,stir till all cheese is melted keeping the sauce fairly thin as it will thicken after the macaroni is added and baked. Top with buttered cracker crumbs and bake till bubbly and lightly browned. I have used this recipe forever.

This recipe is easy, but I agree with other reviewers who think it is a bit bland.  I will make this again, but I will be sure to use more flavorful cheeses and/or herbs and spices of some sort.  Those who have said that the sauce thickens once in the oven were right, I could see where it could become too dry.  I might cut back a bit on the oven time or slightly reduce the temperature.  I think this is a good base recipe for homemade macaroni and cheese, but it definitely needs a few alterations.

Very good easy mac and cheese. I was thrilled to have all of the ingredients on hand ahead while searching for a lunch recipe. I made it in less then 20 min and devoured it! I used bronze cut rigatoni. I was making it for 1 so instead of baking it I ate it as soon as I mixed it with the cheese, instead of paprika I cracked some fresh black pepper at the end. Creamy and yummy classic!

I ate some, but I couldn't decide if it was good or not.  It was really grainy (and I used fresh Parmesan) and not really cheesy (I added 1/2 cup of extra cheese) and home-style.  It did get thicker when you put it in the oven, but it made way to much sauce!

Geeat Mac n Cheese for kids.  Mild flavors and creamy sauce!  I used italian breadcrumbs to add a little flavor and also used shells rather than macaroni (shells hold the sauce!)  Make sure to FULLY melt the cheese in the cause before pouring it over.  

Finally, I used a tent on the last half of cooking as I thought it might singe the top.  Overall, easy to make and tastes great!!

I LOVED this recipe!  I tend to be picky about my mac and cheese, and this one was awesome.  It reminded me a lot of the macaroni and cheese served at a local steakhouse, McKendricks, that is my favorite.
For the 3 cups milk, I used whole milk (I only use whole for cooking) to give it a richer taste.
Also, I used 1 sleeve of ritz crackers and crumbled them for the top, to give it a little more crunch.
My mother even borrowed the recipe for our Thanksgiving instead of her usual mac and cheese casserole!  It was a big hit!

I made this tonight... The first time I made it over the weekend I used way too much macaroni and it turned out dry... The second time I made it it turned out good I thought it would taste more cheesy could have used some salt or spices... I'm still learning though... I wouldn't mind playing around with this recipe again...

I remember my mom making a rue for her mac and cheese.  And I found this recipe. I made it with ziti and doubled everything.  I used on can of evaporated milk like someone had suggested.  Everyone just loved loved it.  I will be making this again.  I also used cheap store named sharp cheddar cheese, and threw in four or five slices of cheap american cheese.  I used my cermaic crocpot to bake it in the oven.

I used skim milk and mozzerella cheese. I did not use butter. After I sprinkled the top with bread crumbs and paprika, I sprayed the top with some PAM.

This was very good.  I made a few minor adjustments but stayed pretty close to the recipe as written.  I used seasoned bread crumbs which added salt I think it would have otherwise needed.  I also agree that the texture was just a bit grainy but the flavor of the sauce was excellent.

This is a good base.  I put some minced garlic in with the roux, and also added salt, pepper and a little dry mustard and onion powder; and a cup of mozz cheese.  I also added bacon to it.  Instead of bread crumbs, I used crushed Ritz.  The kids were so-so with it when finished; I added some Worcestershire sauce and I feel like it still needs something.  Maybe crushed red pepper will do the trick!

I make this recipe all the time.  My only comment is that I think it calls for too much milk.  I tend to start with 2 cups and go from there.  I also like to stir in some extra bread crumbs to the mix before baking.

I tried this recipe and it tasted good, however, the consistancy was a little too grainy and too runny. I would definitely omit the parmesan cheese and add more cheddar cheese or similar cheeses. I would also lessen the milk since it made my casserole a bit too runny. Other than that, my mac & cheese tasted good.

Absolutely no flavor, just tasted and smelled like butter.  I read the other comments where tweaked the recipe and I think I'll try that.

Awesome.  I used Ritz crackers instead of bread crumbs and it was awesome.

This was okay. My husband liked it, my 2 year daughter did not.  The sauce was thick enough. I substituted a little mozzerella for the cheddar and added some worshishire sauce.  I also did ritz crackers instead of bread crumbs.  I thought the finished product was a little grainy and bland.

OMG!  Very delicious.  I added some chopped ham that I had left over from Easter and from another suggestion, about 1 TB Worcestershire Sauce and with a sprinkle of basil and paprika in the cheese sauce.  Hubby had 3 huge helpings and was crying about it later that he ate too much.  NO MORE BOXED MAC AND CHEESE FOR US!!
Thanks!

Simple and good.  First I thought the sauce was going to be too runny, but once baked it firmed up great.  My family usually just like KD mac'n cheese but they devoured this as well.

I made this recipe pretty much as written, only I used 1/2 sharp cheddar, 1/2 marble cheddar (instead of only cheddar).

Loved it!  I agree, you must take the extra time with the sauce to prevent clumping.  

It was a bit thick and dry when reheated the next day, but still yummy.  (I would rate 4 1/2 stars because of this).  Next time I'll make adjustments to try to avoid this.

Personally, I like bread crumb topping but I only add it for the last 15 min or so of baking.  This recipe is just as good without it.

I followed the recipe, but it didn't turn out so well. When I took it out of the oven, the cheese sauce looked like cottage cheese instead. I don't know where I went wrong with this one. But, I am an optimist, so I will give this one a second chance, because my children love mac&cheese.

This was really good! I didn't have cheddar cheese available so I used mozzarella. It tasted delicious! I also mixed in a some of the Italian seasoning with the cheese mix. It looked like there was way too much sauce, but it turns out great!

By far the best macaroni and cheese I have ever had! I used skim milk to cut down on some of the fat/calories so I could use more cheese than what was called for! I sprinkled a little Romano cheese on top as soon as I took it out of the oven. I was out of elbow macaroni so I used Radiatore instead. This meal is good for a side dish or for the entree.

I made this for a lunch I catered a couple of weeks ago, everyone loved it!  I did make a few changes.  I sauted some onions in the butter before adding the flour, added velveeta and just sprinkled the bread crumbs on top with out the butter.  Turned out great!!

very good starter recipe, but i did tweak it here and there. i used mexican blend cheese (comes in a bag) instead of chedder cheese. gave it a really different taste. also i used half and half cream instead of milk and i didnt brown the bread crumbs. i merely took some italian seasoned bread crumbs and sprinkled them on top. then i followed it with a sprinkling of hot peprika. gave it a really nice taste

This is a great recipe with a fundamental key; the roux. Once you master the bechamel sauce, you can use it as a base for endless possibilities.

Although I added some garlic powder, worchester sauce and mustard...these didn't turn out very tasty. Bland. And although I replaced 100ml milk with heavy cream, they were not at all creamy.

This is a good recipe. I chose to use half ev. milk and half skim milk and a half cup of sour cream.  The sauce was nice and thick.  I also followed the suggestions to add some onion powder, garlic, and some Tapatio (hot sauce).  Next time, I may season even more. Thanks for the recipe!

I took the advice of others and used 2 cups of evaporated milk, 1/2 cup of sour cream and 1/2 cup of milk.  Scared of the leftovers being dry, Once the noodles were done I mixed them with 1/4 cup of butter and 1 1/2 cups of velveta until melted.  I then added the cheese mixture and baked.  Very rich.

Very easy and very good. I put this together when I got home from work and let it sit for about 45 minutes before cooking.  The liquid was completely absorbed.  I was able to feed this to the family in shifts.  Even after setting in the oven on low for over 2 hours, it was still delicious.  This one is a keeper!

At first I thought that the sauce was way too runny, but after cooking it, it turns out nice.  I like this although it's not what I'm used to.  Everybody in the house liked it including the dog who asked for seconds. :)

Nice hearty meal. A little velveta would be an idea to make it a little creamier, but I love it.

This was a good base recipe.  I'm glad I read the reviews and followed the advice of several others by adding several additional seasonings mentioned.  I cut the milk back to 2 cups and added about 2T of Bermuda Sherry Pepper sauce.  The recipe says it serves 3.  I'd say it can EASILY serve 6.

Fair at best, not sure what it is missing, but there does not seem to be a real cheesy flavor.  Would try a different recipe next time

I made this last night and took it to a playgroup dinner. Moms and kids enjoyed it. I added a little garlic powder, some dry mustard and pepper and did not use the parmesan cheese. Instead, I used more cheddar. I liked it, and so did everyone BUT my husband. So, I gave it a 4 instead of a 5 based on his comment. He may not have liked the very slight "garlic" taste to the recipe.

Still very good though!

This recipe makes alot of macaroni and cheese. I followed the recipe exactly and got good results. I do think I will add some extra spices next time. My family enjoyed it and I will definitely make it again maybe with some monterey jack cheese added.

This wasn't bad, it just needs some spicing up.  Thought it was pretty bland and boring.  I will make it again, though, and try adding some mustard or something to the sauce for a little kick.

Very good recipe, The only thing I changed was instead of cooking the pasta in water I cook it in chicken broth. Gives it that little extra flavor and makes it really good.

Family favorite.  Basic, simple, easy Mac and cheese.  Sometimes, I try to spice it up a bit by addy different cheeses like Gouda, Guyere, and Toscano.  I always add some ground pepper and sometimes garlic, especially when using Italian cheese blend.  Like eating garlic bread without the bread.

My 13 year old made this recipe with my help. We followed the recipe exactly but did forget to add the paprika at the end. This was not the best homemade mac n cheese I've had (also not the worst). I felt bad for my daughter because this was her first attempt at really cooking from scratch. Even she commented that there was something off about it. Personally,  I think it was too much cheddar and it sat really heavy in my stomach.  I think a blend of different cheeses would have tasted better. I would not make this again. We made enough for leftovers,  and I kinda wish we hadn't.

Was easy to follow and was delicious, I tweaked it just a little like adding double smoked bacon and replacing the butter and bread crumbs with smashed up ruffles Sour cream and onion flavored chips. Cooked it in my ninja 5-1 foodie grill and took only 20 minutes at 350 instead of 30.

Wasn’t as cheesy or flavorful as I had hoped! The cheese sauce was rather, “meh.” I think this could be jazzed you by adding some velveeta or something during the making of the sauce,....  the taste of the cheese just doesn’t come through.

I did add some spices, but other than that, followed the recipe as written.  I've been searching for a mac & cheese that isn't gummy and dry - and this one is a keeper.  It seems like a lot of liquid for the amount of macaroni, but trust me, it isn't.  Great consistency.  My only negative comment is one that others have made - the parmesan cheese makes the sauce a bit grainy - I might leave it out next time for that reason.  But otherwise, this was great.  (I added a dash of cayenne pepper, nutmeg, thyme and worcestershire sauce, plus a tsp of dijon mustard).

Awful. I made it as written and it was grainy. Not cheesy at all.

Was worried that the sauce wasn't thick enough but just added a little more macaroni. It turned out awesome! Everyone loved it!

It's the 25th of December and I'm not really into the holidays so I completely forgot about the Christmas meal. I had ham but nothing to go with it. I needed something simple and easy and I just barely had the ingredients for this. I don't see why this needs to be baked cause I was practically eating it after mixing the cheese sauce with the macaroni but I popped it in the oven anyway. I also don't see why you would put bread crumbs on it and I didn't have any so I used ritz crackers. I didn't really care for that part LOL. Anyway I thought this was a very good recipe minus the bread crumbs and baking.

I've made this B4, very good but it was more work than I remembered. Fortunately, my wife, Marilyn pitched in. The video shows adding onion, of which is the way I like it. It takes too long to thicken but I read a comment not to worry about that, it will be OK.

I've made this several time for a couple of years now, and let me tell you it is a hit! It is so delicious and tasty. Everyone loves it and especially like the bread crumbs on top. I am actually about to make it for our Christmas Eve dinner.

I didn’t even want to give it a star. It was the worst I’ve ever eaten. The cheese, milk and egg bake into a cottage cheese consistency and macaroni are dry and cheese less...... do not waste your time

This was absolutely amazing! I did a couple things differently though to make it a bit spicy and less bland. I substituted the cheese for 1 cup pepper jack, 1 cup Colby jack, and a half cup of cottage cheese. I also added a southwest blend of spices (half of: www.foodnetwork.com - emerils southwest seasoning) to the cheese. I used only 2 cups of milk instead of 3. I also added some crispy bacon bits, tomatoes, and green onions on top before I put it in the oven.

Yes I will make it again! I’ve already made it twice, one with changes and one without. I recommend adding Velveeta cheese for moisture and to add richness to the sauce. I also recommend putting garlic salt, black pepper, and paprika right into the sauce for taste and presentation.

Thank you for your time!

Everyone said it was the best the have tasted. I went with recommendations used half condensed milk half regular. Added some spices and spicy mustard, it turned out perfect. I only did 4 stars because the recipe doesn’t call for seasoning and that’s a must.

I made this and it came out wonderful. I added ham that was left over from thanksgiving. I cubed it up. I also added the sharp cheddar and Colby jack cheese as well. It was wonderful. The bread crumbs look dark because of the lighting and I went a little more heavy on it lol. But didn’t want to waste anything. Salt and pepper to taste. Def going to make this again

Made for the grandkids for Thanksgiving. They loved it and so the adults. The recipe makes a lot of sauce, so I did about 12oz of macaroni, and it was plenty saucy.

II did substitute Velveeta shredded original cheese for cheddar. My kiddos prefer the creaminess.  Next time will probably skip the Panko topping and will sprinkle with more cheese.

Read the comments before you make this. As is, it's pretty bland. I added maybe 1/2 tsp of dry mustard, but that didn't do much.

Waaaay too much cheese sauce. I think they meant at least 16 oz of macaroni, not 8

I though the sauce was going to be too runny but one it was baked it was perfect.  I might leave out the paprika next time. I did add bacon bits to the bread crumbs.  Overall I really enjoyed this and would definitely make again.

I was out of flour from making pie crust for an apple pie yesterday so I used just a sprinkle of corn starch to help thicken the cheese sauce. Also I crumbled my kids favorite crackers on top instead of browning bread crumbs even more easy and a taste my kids will connect with as well! Overall this is a super easy side dish for a dinner of 4-8 people. I made steaks on our grill and some sautéed green beans to go along with the Mac and cheese. Happy full family of 4, 2 being very picky eaters!

Parmesan cheese was a little overpowering for me; dish was very dry. I will probably try another recipe.

I have made this more than once, both times I found it rather bland with hardly any cheese flavor.  Next time I would try to find a recipe with a different milk to cheese ratio.

This was so good!!   I added garlic, dijon mustard and Slap Ya Mamma to the roux.  Only used 2 cups of milk, still seemed very runny when I poured it over the pasta, but turned out perfect and amazing.  Husband loooooved it.  Kids also loved it, but shockingly didn't care for the breadcrumb topping, but they are weird.

We made this recipe only substituting pasta for gluten free, using a gluten free flour blend, and gluten free bread crumbs and it was a total hit.  our son is allergic to gluten, but misses really good mac and cheese.  He requests this recipe often.  Thank you for sharing!

Overall the recipe was fairly easy to understand and to make. But the one thing that destroyed the dish for me after it was completed, was the parmesan cheese. It gave the Mac and cheese a grainy texture which threw off the whole taste of it being creamy and cheesy. It lacks something besides that as well.   I think this recipe needs to get tweaked.

I really wanted to like this but it was not a great Mac N Cheese. I regret putting the bread crumbs on it. There are very few backed mac n cheeses with bread crumbs that I like. I think for me the texture of the crumbs ruins the creaminess of the sauce. I also felt the sauce was missing flavor. Someone had recommended using evaporated milk for more favor and I tried that because I was short on milk anyway and I am still just not impressed.

I loved this recipe but instead of shredded cheddar, I used mozzarella. I thought it would better to add some crunch with French Fried Onions. It’s going to be a great companion for Bacon and Cheddar Burgers tonight

I added some diced ham steaks that I’d sautéed first in olive oil and butter. I’d like to have had something green like peas. 

The ham gave the fish some saltiness, so it was well seasoned. The paprika on top was meaningless. I probably could have used better bread crumbs. Also could have substituted some gruyere for some of the cheddar, to give it a little more bite. 

All in all, very tasty and a crowd pleaser.

A new family favourite!! Fry some bacon or chorizo  in the melted butter or margarine, before making  the sauce (for a meaty version). I also put sliced tomatoes on the mac and cheese before covering with breadcrumbs.

This def needs more seasoning, I added in cracked pepper and dry mustard. As well, the sauce to pasta ratio is WAY off. 3 cups of milk is too much.

1st time making mac & cheese and it came out pretty good. I made some changes to the recipes based on other reviews. The evaporate milk helps thicken the sauce, less runny.  
Will make it again.

Excellent basic mac and cheese from scratch. Versatile and easy to modify with additional cheeses or bacon. 

Even the baking is not necessary, but is a great touch.

Perfect amount of milk to flour and cheese ratio. When tasting the sauce it seemed a little flat so I added 1/4 tsp of dried mustard and 1/8 tsp cayenne. Decided to add cooked shallots and 1/4 cup of wine to give it a bit more of an adult flavor.

I doubled the recipe so I could pour it into a crockpot to bring to a fundraiser, and it was perfect. After reading the number of reviews that mentioned how much liquid there was, I thought this would be perfect for keeping the noodles from drying out in the crockpot and it was as it definitely thickens up as it sits (even before turning on the crockpot). I followed other reviewers suggestions and substituted evaporated milk for half the milk. I also added a 1/2 cup of sour cream.

Great basic recipe.  I made it the first time as it says.  Now I add spices to match the meal going with it.  ie italian bread crumbs, dry mustard, spicy pepper, chicken, ham

It really is an ideal blank slate.

I used unsweetened organic soy milk to reduce the fat content.  works great!  Dash of chili powder for some kick.   And smoked gouda with a dash of smoked salt spice.  delish!  Topped with cracked pepper and paprika just under the bread crumbs.  Then mixed fresh grated parmesan cheese in with the bread crumbs.  yum yum yum

I made it exactly as described except I added some left over pulled chicken and I used Italian flavored bread crumbs. It turned out great. My wife and step daughter both loved it. Even went back for seconds. I’ll make it again.

BORING!! If you have kids that like M&C, then boring is fine, perhaps even preferred. But for the rest of us adults (that's an assumption), it needs flavor. I used raw cow's milk, and extremely top end cheeses. It is boring. I'll try to salvage it in those deep fried  M&C  balls, but I suspect the chickens will get it.

I omitted the bread crumb topping, and used evaporated milk instead of the milk. I didn't bake, either. It came out great! The leftovers were even better.

I picked a mild cheddar cheese, but I didn't think it was as strong as I would've liked. Next time I would use sharp cheddar.
Overall, I loved it, but I think I made the sauce a little thicker than what I'm use to so it didn't end up being a "creamy" dish, but definitely cheesy.
For time purposes, I put Ritz crumbs on top instead of making my own.

3 cups milk to 2 1/2 Tbs flour makes a thin cheese sauce.  I poured 1/2 iover pasta and saved 1/2.  Eh.

Nice homemade version rather than a box, agree it is simple and easy to make. Used 2 cups of unsweetened almond milk with 1 cup whole milk. I also wondered why it did not come out as cheesy as the picture - used 16 oz of pasta instead of the 8. fast and easy dinner, everyone enjoyed.

I used almond milk, which I will never do again.  I will make this again with regular milk, and I know it’ll be amazing.  I added a garlic bread season blend and a tsp of paprika.

4.5 stars. Like others, I made modifications based on the reviews. I subbed half of the milk with evaporated milk and heavily salted the pasta water. I used grated romano instead of parmesan.  Poured in about 12 oz worth of shell pasta instead of 8. I also seasoned with garlic salt, lots of pepper, a few pinches of red pepper flakes, and parsley. I used the Irish herbed butter, which added some more flavor The breadcrumbs came out crunchy, just make sure you toast them long enough/in high enough heat. Mine didn't seem too runny (before I baked), and it had the perfect consistency when done.

A good base recipe to throw in your own modifications. It does have a rather mild flavor, but still had enough to keep my taste buds pleased. Bacon and/or something with a little spice (maybe jalapeno?) would give it a good kick if you're looking for something extra.

I added different cheddar and Monterey jack cheese, with a hint of parmesan. I did the breadcrumbs slightly differently. Without the foundation of making homemade mac and cheese, I would be nowhere. Thank you

I highly recommend reading all of the reviews before making this. I'm a seasoned Cook and I should have known better with regard to how much pasta to use. 8 oz is not equal to an 8 oz cup it's equal to one and three quarter cups. also, I highly recommend using a variety of milks including half and half and evaporated milk which I only used half and half so it came out very rich and not extremely tasty until I salted it. it's a great recipe to play around with. Definitely read all the reviews. adding a little hot sauce makes all the difference in the world too.

Followed recipe to a  T.  Very bland.  I should have known.  
3 Cups of milk seemed to much and diluted the cheesey taste-- and most recipes add a dash of mustard powder, or garlic powder, or diced onion.  This was pretty tasteless.    If you stop at this recipe, I suggest you keep looking.  I've just read other reviews  and theirs are similar to mine.  I will repeat what a few reviewers said:  DO NOT USE THIS RECIPE.  Wast of time and ingredients.  We ate 2 bowlfuls,  the dog at a little, and we're tossing the rest.   Others who changed the recipe with evaporated milk said it was creamy.  I followed the recipe to a T, and it was NOT creamy, and too bland to enjoy.  Is there a way to get a recipe off All Recipe so others won't waste time and ingredients?

This was easy enough to make but I found it very bland. It definitely needs more spice to me - definitely some salt and pepper, perhaps dry mustard as others have suggested. I was really in the mood for mac & cheese on a cool night but was fairly disappointed.

It was pretty good. About 75% was eaten. It needed more cheese, which may have been my fault or the recipe. I will not use processed or other junk cheese, so it just may be a necessary change to add more of the more 'soft' variety. Otherwise, it was good.

This recipe came out great.  The liqiudy part of  sauce thickened in oven. I used Italian breadcrumbs sautéed in a cast iron skillet and one stick of butter, then topped pasta mix with it and then topped with crumbled bacon pieces. Not bland at all, used yellow extra sharp, white extra sharp,  parmesan, and Monterey Jack.   Needs no salt due to the saltiness of bacon, breadcrumbs, cheeses, and pasta cooked with plenty of sea salt in water.

We are a gluten-free family due to celiac disease.  I used gluten-free macaroni by @KnowFoods...replaced the flour with cornstarch and used gluten-free breadcrumbs and additional grated Parmesan cheese for the topping.  Cheese was combo mozzarella, gruyere, cheddar and Monterey Jack.  Oh, and a few finely chopped red onions.  This was amazing!

I'm giving this a five star rating but only because I added some dry mustard and a bit of Worcestershire to the otherwise bland sauce. We use skim milk in the roux as that is usually what we have on hand--but I've used both half and half and heavy cream and both of them add substantial flavor.

It is better than the box... but has some flaws.  First a roux is normally 1:1... it should have been stated the roux will be loose and so will the cheese sauce... before baking.  Also, 2 cups of cheddar cheese is not enough... needs at least 1 more cup.  Butter was listed twice ingredients, but not indicated one for sauce and one for topping... was confusing.  Finally I used Panko (plain) breadcrumbs rather than regular... was great... but butter/panko quantity should be doubled.  In the reviews I saw a suggestion of Half & Half rather than milk... sounds yummy... perhaps next time!

I personally think it’s just good, but everyone I serve it to just loves it- even adults.   My kids say it is better the second day.

Odd texture, and my son hated it.  It was ok, imo, but I won't make it again....too much resources for the family not eating it.

So good! This is by far the best tasting mac and cheese recipe I've found! I add a pinch of salt, pepper, and paprika to the cheese sauce for extra flavor

The fact that we can't do half-stars is unfair; this is better than a 3-star meal, but not quite a four-star one. It's a really great "beginners' mac and cheese"- if you've never made a homemade mac and cheese before and you want a recipe on "easy mode," this one is for you! But it did seem to me to be a little plain. It's just cheesy enough, but it could use something else extra. The paprika didn't add much even though I added in more than just a pinch, and I wanted something stronger to season it and give it a real punch of flavor. Still, though, it was easy and tasty, and makes plenty of leftovers. So I can't really complain!

I doubled the pasta amount and added two cups of habanero jack as well as put diced bell pepper in this. I’ve made it about 7 times now this way in a 13x9 Pyrex. Sometimes I get a pre-baked chicken fro. Heb and throw that into the mix as well. My brother rates this customization highly, lol! Great recipe

I have made this mac n cheese recipe several times over the years and really like how it turns out.  I do add a bit of dry mustard as well as salt and pepper to the roux, but I pretty much follow the recipe as stated and it always turns out great.  The recipe does make a lot of cheese sauce - but I like it that way!  I just wish my kids liked homemade mac n cheese more so that I could make it more often!

I was excited about this recipe as it got pretty good reviews. But I found it very bland, even though I followed the recipe exactly.  It might be OK for little kids, but for adults who like a bit of taste, I would add some chopped white onion, and some diced tomato meat (without the inside juice & seeds). Also a small amount of black pepper, kosher salt into the cheese mix.  Cheese and onion are always favorities with grilled cheese, so I think this would add some good flavor.  I also would try a 1/2 t. dry mustard and a few dashes of nutmeg. Good luck!

Was really good. Almost better the next day. Will cut back on the butter for sure! I took some tips from the reviews and added 1tbs of ground mustard, and a clove if garlic. Little salt and pepper. Definitely a keeper.

The recipe was well done. I used shells instead of elbows and the shells squirted the cheese like a fruit gummy in macaroni form. Next time I'll cut a fourth of the butter.

I'm eleven yrs old and and I made this for supper. I loved it but the whole thing was rather bland. So what I did for my next mac and cheese was basically the same thing without Parmesan cheese and some spices and meat. It tasted much much much better. So next time I make it I'll add two sauces, one cheesy n creamy and the other spicy and tastefull.

Made this as a test-run for my son's upcoming graduation party.  Like other reviewers have  commented, this was a bit bland.  I added 1/2 teaspoon of ground mustard, but it was still lacking.  Bare minimum, it needs salt and pepper.  Used Panko bread crumbs which made a wonderful topping. This was ok, but I don't think it's going to be making an appearance at the grad party.

I added smoked pulled bbq pork, and I used gf noodles from Tinkiyada and I drained the noodles 5 min before they were done cooking. They finished cooking in the cheese sauce. This kept the noodles from disintegrating while the dish baked.

We love this.  It's our go to mac & cheese.  I see some call it "bland", but to me, it tastes like cheese, just like it should.  I don't want it overwhelmed with other flavors.  Good stuff.

Really bland and awful texture.  I am not a novice in making roux or sauces.  I cooked slow but still curddled.   Not edible.  The family loves Mac and cheese, but not this one.
What a waste of good ingredients.
We ended up making it a pizza night

This is my go too Mac and cheese recipe!  I have unfavorited the others. Making sure you make the rou correctly. It does seem very liquidly but once it bakes and sits for 5-10 mins before dishing it out. The cheese thickens up nicely. I think next time I will add some garlic powder etc as some people did. Don’t get me wrong I LOVE CHEESE but it definitely needed a little spicing up! Great recipe!

I modified the recipe as follows:
Smoked paprika instead of paprika
Added 2 chopped jalepenos (seeds in)
6 slices of thick smoked bacon.

It was delicious! Great recipe, thank you.

DH said it was better than most restaurants. I doubled it and had to use 2 casserole dishes for baking. It made 3 meal's worth!  I used 1 1/2c leftover cheeses from Christmas meat and cheese baskets (smoked cheddar, sharp American, sharp cheddar), then 2c shredded sharp cheddar. Pretty straightforward. Look into comments next time as to what to add (veggies, etc)

I used this recipe for the basics as I have not made Mac-cheese in ages.   
I substituted the parm cheese for shredded Gouda. I didn't have the park on hand.   I also used chopped dried onions.  Everything else the same.  It was wonderful!  So creamy and rich.   I will make this more often...  I don't know how people use that boxed MAC and cheese when this is so simple to make.

As is, I give this a 3 because we thought it was very bland. This recipe gave a good base so we gave it another shot after adding to the recipe. To the sauce, I added some ground mustard and quite a bit more paprika. I also used crushed corn flakes/butter as the topping. I will be making this again with the revisions.

I made this exactly as written and it was really bad. I'm so disappointed. It was bland, despite all the cheese in it and no matter how much salt and pepper I added. The bread crumbs just didn't work - they began getting soggy and were just really gross. I scraped them off to see if it helped and it didn't. No one in my family would eat it.

I have made this countless times. The changes I make are: I don't put the breadcrumbs on top I put cheese on top and I use 2 cups of three different cheeses that go together (my personal favorites are mozzarella, gouda, and white cheddar). Tastes great!

After reading reviews made the following changes:  used 1 12 oz. can evaporated milk and 12 oz. of milk, and used 16 oz. of large elbow macaroni.  Be sure to use freshly grated parmesan not the stuff in the jar!  Next time I'll use only 1/4 cup of breadcrumbs 1/2 cup was too much.  The result was the best mac n cheese I've ever made and I'll use this recipe again and again!!  My husband requested diced ham as an addition next time and I'll try it for him....but no other changes the recipe is PERFECT ?

I didn't take a picture because we ate it too fast. I had seconds and my boyfriend had thirds and fourths. We ate it all!! Yes, even if your roux is smooth, the cheese makes the sauce less smooth than boxed M & C, but it's absolutely delicious and flavorful and special. Definitely saving this recipe for another cheat day and Thanksgiving.

Kind of bland.  I added 1/2 tsp. onion powder and 1/4 tsp dry mustard.  It needed lots of salt.  I even added an extra cup of cheddar cheese.

Made this recipe to the letter not once but twice in a row. Thought it was my error the first time. Boy was I wrong. Followed the recipe precisely and took care to blend and slowly heat the sauce properly. This came out as a grainy, clumpy, curdled mess! Waisted a nine dollar block of cheese on this recipe and ended up eating far too late at night because of it. Skip this and save yourself the disappointment.

The recipe is pretty good, I've made it a couple time, omitting the bread crumbs because they simply don't fit my idea of a smooth creamy M&C. I read many of the one star reviews and came to the conclusion that each and every one of them probably are lacking enough background cooking techniques that simply following the recipe to the letter can't possibly result in a quality meal that's going to please. They each stated similar blandness and runniness as the problem, assuming that this recipe can accommodate subtle changes and variables that need to be already well learned to actually accomplish the desired end results. And with that, I mean to express that the first stage of cooking a mac and cheese sauce requires a tasty roux and it needs a bit of time to develop a flavor. Simply melting butter, adding and mixing the flour, blending and immediately dumping the cheese in means that the resulting sauce is going to be bad, without fail. Adding a pinch or dried mustard is the main thing I don't think I saw in the recipe. Additionally adding another variety of cheese is essential. Plain cheddar is what makes this actual recipe only 3-4 stars worthy, but it's a good platform to start from.

I made it but threw in extra cheddar and I substituted evaporated milk for half of the milk. It was delicious.

Very good recipe! I used Ritz crackers instead of bread crumbs and it came out fantastic.

It was a little bland in flavor .... so instead of plain bread crumbs I used stove top stuffing (savory  herbs) it’s so good with the bread crumbs mixed in . I also baked some.

I used elbow shaped pasta - 8 oz was not enough so I increased the amount to about 3/4 box or 12 oz.  I added salt and pepper to taste after placing in the baking dish, mixed well and then sprinkled some Parmesan cheese before finishing up with the bread crumb mixture - I used panko crumbs and increased the amount to 1 cup.  This dish was amazing!

It’s a good recipe. Came out pretty creamy except I kinda cleaned out my pantry of all the elbows in it and had to make more sauce. I added half and half until it was pretty thin.  Probably could have even been even thinner, but it looked like I was reaching the limit of my 6 qt. Casserole, so I stopped adding the milk.  I threw a handful of ham in it, used up some guyeure I found in the fridge along with a block of velveeta, a tiny bit of blue I had, and then the rest sharp cheddar. The Dijon is a nice touch, really set of the dish. I served it up to the twenty somethings that live with me for New Years Day. They really liked it. I did too.

I made this for Christmas and it was terrible!  I don't know what went wrong  because I followed the recipe exactly.  It looked delicious when it was baking, but 10 mins before it was done, I sprinkled on the smoked paprika and when I pulled it from the oven, the top of casserole was covered in orange grease!  I tried it, but it tasted greasy, was just terrible, had to throw the whole thing out.  All that work for nothing, very  disappointed.

This is a good basic recipe to use with your own seasonings and modifications. I used a few different cheeses, substituted a cup of the milk for heavy cream, and seasoned the sauce to taste with salt, onion powder, garlic powder, and paprika. It came out great!

This is by far my favorite macaroni and cheese dish!! I make it often for potlucks and I never have leftovers and get rave reviews!! I prefer using Italian bread crumbs and am heavy handed with the smoked paprika.

I make this all of the time. It's wonderful. Sometimes I mix it up and put in other cheese types. I like to shred my own, regardless of what I use.

Used as a base and modified significantly.  Used whole milk, buttermilk, evap milk, and 1/2 & 1/2.  Added spices (dry mustard, more paprika, black pepper).  Used multiple cheeses.  OMG so good.

This was pretty good, my grandson is very picky and he gave this an 8 out of 10. He thinks Panera mac and cheese is a ten. This recipe was easy and delicious. I will make it again.

Making a correct roux is extremely important.  Watch a youtube video, if you need to.  Mine came out nice and firm.  Also, 8 oz. of elbow macaroni is equal to about 2 cups, so be careful.  I gave it four stars, because I needed to add a good amount of salt, mustard powder, and Worcestershire sauce to give it flavor.  I also recommend using fresh grated Parmesan cheese.

I have to agree with the folks who describe this Mac and Cheese as "Bland."  All I can add is that if it's necessary to make so many "adjustments" the recipe is not that good in the first place. Definitely look for another recipe.

This is awful. Its bland. I love cheese, and there wasn't enough cheese, there was too much milk. I don't know what they were thinking cause there wasn't enough flour for the roux, either. This dish needs a lot of work. Skip it. Its inedible.

Yum! My only recommendation is to hold off on adding the paprika until only a few cooking minutes remain. Adding paprika too soon can burn the paprika giving it an “off” taste.

I’ve tried this recipe several times, followed instructions but it is always missing flavour. The roux comes out perfectly it takes a while for it to get nice and creamy but the texture is amazing it just doesn’t taste like any Mac n cheese I’ve had growing up. It needs seasoning, 3 stars cause my girl likes it and it comes out perfectly , just for me personally it’s to bland

I doubled the recipe to feed my whole family of large men and had to throw away the whole dish. All of my ingredients were doubled correctly, however, it came out with no flavor. Just a bland noodle taste. Definitely not as good as momma makes.

It's alright not the best mac n cheese but the only thing that I would suggest is not to add all the breadcrumbs the recipe calls for, it's very overpowering. It's a bit on the bland side in my opinion.

So good! I used rigatoni because we have a lot of it from the whole sale club. I was worried about how the cheese would get inside but it’s liquid when you mix it with the pasta so no problems! 
I used progresso garlic and herb bread crumbs and that was very tasty! 
Been looking for a baked mac n cheese recipe forever, thanks!

We made this as a side dish for Thanksgiving, and it came out great. It even reheats well the next day. One item to be aware of- the sauce was very watery and we were afraid it wouldn't thicken in the oven. But it did, and it looked and tasted very good.

I doubled the recipe for 1 pound of Pasta and I added about a tablespoon of minced garlic that I had sitting in my fridge in olive oil and I also added a pinch of salt to the sauce which I really don’t think it needed looking back now and I bought good Parmesan cheese from the supermarket that comes in a container not kraft. It was absolutely delicious creamy everyone loved it I really didn’t have much left over. Highly recommend this recipe I hope you like my substitutions I really do think that the garlic add an extra taste to it

First of all - believe the other reviewers! This comes out very soupy but it's OK! I drained some of the excess sauce off and it came out dry! Just follow the recipe!

I added cajun seasoning, hot sauce, dry mustard, and tiny bit of onion powder and it was fabulous!

I cooked thickcut bacon, chopped it up finely and added it half way through the baking process. The bacon fat soaked in and crisped beautifully on top...DELECTABLE!!!

I am not a very experienced cook and wanted to try making homemade macaroni and cheese for Thanksgiving this year. I "practiced" this recipe in advance, because I really didn't want to mess it up and OMG! It was the BEST macaroni and cheese I have ever eaten in my entire life and what made it even better yet was that I made it! The only thing I switched up was I had used garlic and herb bread crumbs instead of traditional.

I always use this recipe as a start.  I also add some queso blanco dip to the sauce, as well as bacon and jalapeños.  I feel like it makes it perfect, and everyone always wants me to make it for parties.

This recipe was awesome! I have been in search of one that is egg free, because of son’s allergy, and I finally found it. I have prepared it twice and my family loves it. Although, I did make a change or two.  I used smoked Gouda instead of using Parmesan cheese, and I left off the bread crumbs option for more cheese on top.  It was a hit!!!!

I made this to go with Brown Sugar Meatloaf (also on this site) tonight. I do not usually like mac and cheese but this recipe was amazing.  My Grandmother absolutely loved it and I shared the recipe with her as well. There were zero leftovers so, it was a big hit. Thank you for sharing, way better that boxed shells and cheese (and probably healthier too, lol).

My family loved this mac and cheese.  I didn't use the paprika though.  I also cut down the milk to 2-3/4 cups.  Since there is 2 different amounts of butter I wasn't sure which one to use for the flour & the breadcrumbs.  I am assuming the 1/4 cup is for the flour & the 2 tablespoons is for the breadcrumbs.

This is my new favorite way to make Mac and Cheese! I added salt, pepper, and dry mustard. Also I skipped the bread crumbs and just topped it with more shredded cheddar. Turned out great!!

Thanks to Julies tip of not worrying about the sauce being too runny  It is perfect after baking.  I would add either some dry mustard and/or cayenne to rue - otherwise it was easy & tasty!

Extremely bland. Not creamy at all. Not at all enough cheese. My kids love Mac and cheese and no one in my house liked this. Also didn't like the topping. We try several new Mac and cheese recipes and this one is probably the worst so far.

Going from a hot roux to 3 cups of milk and then immediately cheeses and turning to low, the temp is nowhere near hot enough to melt the cheese unless you wanna waste a lifetime

Yum!! I made some changes due to what I had on hand and based on other reviews. I made this with Colby jack cheese and Parmesan, used 2 cups evaporated milk and 1 cup 2% milk, and used cornstarch instead of flour. I added some minced garlic, ground mustard and a little salt/pepper, and used homemade croutons lightly crushed on top. So, so good, very creamy and the croutons gave it a little crunch. I will make again!

Very basic when it comes to seasoning, I added garlic and onion powder, black pepper, dry mustard powder and a dash of Worchestire. I had a 16 oz box of macaroni but I kept sauce measurements as is, I am glad I did as it was very liquidy, I had to add 2 more cups of cheese to help thicken. It seems the amounts are off as I could not imagine that much sauce with 8 oz of pasta.

I love making this it is so good and easy I like to put in a half cup of diced onion and green bell pepper. Instead of 3 cups of milk I use 2 cups of milk one half cup evaporated milk and one half cup of sour cream and that's all

This is a great recipe!!!  I followed others suggestion of adding dry mustard & subbing half the milk with evaporated.  The sauce is runny when you add it to the pasta.  Every time, I have to remind myself that it's OK. Last night, after it baked, we topped it with BBQ pulled pork…YUM!  Love this recipe!

I was looking for a basic mac and cheese recipe...this was perfect. Delicious! The only change I made was adding bacon. I cooked the bacon, then cooked the sauce in the same pan to get some of the bacon flavor throughout the sauce. Delicious. It even tasted great leftover.

Will definitely be making this again! I'm a Mac & Cheese fiend. I doubled the recipe because I couldn't find an 8oz box of elbow macaroni.

Changes I made:
2 -- 8oz bags of Sharp Cheddar Cheese
1--8oz bag of Italian five Cheese Blend
2--8oz bags of  Mexican Four Cheese (I know sounds weird but I'm telling you it blends very well!)

Added --Garlic powder, 1 tbs of mustard powder, & black pepper to your liking. I eyed it on the garlic powder, but it was probably about 1 tbs, add enough to where you can slightly taste the garlic. Add these spices to the cheese! 

I used Italian bread crumbs because it's what I had on hand but it tastes fireeee. Also I added the bread crumbs without mixing them with butter since the cheese has enough moisture for it.

All in all I love this recipe with my changes.

It was good but I wish the recipe had called for some basic salt and pepper.  It definitely needs it and I saw on another mac and chess recipe to add it after the milk.  Also,I covered mine up with foil and stuck in fridge, then popped in over with foil on.  The browned breadcrumb topping was soggy 30 min later.  I believe it is supposed to be crunchy.  Note to self, to take the aluminum foil off for last 10 minutes to get the topping crunchy.   My kids really liked it.

I've made this twice now. Tonight  I added the dry mustard which others recommended and liked this! I also put some cheesy ritz crackers crumbled on top and broiled the top for a few minutes. Tip - its better the next day and tastes awesome heated up on a BBQ ! I still find it a bit dry and will try the sour cream or evaporated milk tips next time! Since we don't have sharp cheddar in canada I can't figure out what cheese is best to use but went with medium.

Came out delish..  I used 1 1/2 cup evaporated milk and 1 1/2 cup regular milk . Instead of 2 cups sharp cheddar I used 1 cup of a Colby /Monterey Jack blend and 1 cup of the cheddar along w the Parmesan. Awesome recipe

Came out excellent. I also thought the sauce was a bit thin when I put it in to bake but it set up perfectly. I added salt and pepper to the sauce before mixing and baking.

This is almost exactly how I make Mac n cheese (except I'm lazy and skip baking/ breadcrumbs and just use a lil more flour quite often). To the bland comments- sharp vs mild cheddar makes a big difference. This is a great base, but try cooking some minced onions in the butter, and adding a bit of nutmeg (just a little, ¼ tsp ish), dry mustard and fresh ground pepper. This shouldn't be grainy. If it is, make sure to brown the roux (when it smells heavenly on its own it's ready) and add the milk in batches and really stir. Cold milk + hot roux shouldnt have any problems. Also, do NOT use pre-grated parm. The Kraft Shakey cheese stuff is more cellulose than cheese and does not have the same taste as parm and will not melt smoothly. If that's all the parm you have, sub in some other type of cheese you like and have on hand. (the flakes of parm should work fine, but I've never used them. it's usually cheaper to just get the block)

It was good! It was a little too cheesy for me, the second time I made it I doubled the pasta and left everything else the same. But I'm not the biggest Mac and cheese fan so if you like it super cheesy keep the proportions as is! I did put more bread crumbs on top cause I love them. Overall a great recipe and one I will be saving for future use!

I added chopped celery, carrots, parsnips, and beef hotdogs.
It was pretty good. I think I'm going to play with the type of cheese I use next time.
Even better warmed up the next day.

Made this one as I am an avid Mac and cheese lover and wanted to make something other than boxed Mac and cheese. It turned out fabulous! The second time I made it I used more Parmesan cheese, nacho cheese, pre shredded 4 cheese Italian and cheddar. Highly recommend experimenting with your favorite cheeses but stay clear from processed nacho cheese. It was cheese overkill.

This was good but I did make changes. I doubled it and am freezing the second portion. I added a touch of mustard, a sprinkle of garlic salt, sprinkle of chicken boullion, and bacon. My roux was pretty thick so it worked out great. I did use a bit less than called for. I used ritz cracker crumbs on top and that was great. Next time I will use less parmesan or leave it out altogether. I like the taste of cheddar better and this was too parmesan-ish. the consistency was great, nice and creamy. I just need more cheddar. Great base recipe that can be tweaked!  Will make again!

Delicious although the amount of breadcrumbs seems a bit excessive, at least in a double batch. I'd go with a little less next time. Also the instructions are a bit vague. Are you supposed to use all the flour to make the roux or what? If so why say add enough to make a roux? Also which amount of butter goes where? I assume the larger amount goes in the cheese sauce but someone could do the opposite. Also what kind of milk? I went with 2% since that's pretty much the standard but maybe that's wrong.

A good recipe, but if you want a bit more flavorful result, try what I did. I added 1 1/2 tsp dried mustard a tsp dijon mustard to the roux along with a Tbsp minced garlic and 2 tsp Worchestershire, with a couple generous pinches black pepper and a pinch of red pepper flakes. It won't be spicy.
For the wet ingredients I used 1 cup of sour cream, 1 cup cottage cheese, 1 1/2 cup half and half. ( use low fat dairy if you want butI feel it does take away from the richness ) I had 2 8oz blocks of Colby Jack cheese so I grated those to mix into the roux ( pre shredded cheeses are not as flavorful and it tend to be dry ) I like gooey cheese ! I used Panko crumbs right out of the bag to sprinkle on top before I put it in the oven. Don't worry if it looked too runny, it will be fine ! Last few minutes of baking I turn the broiler on to toast the Panko topping until golden brown. OMG SO GOOD !

Doubled recipe, used white cheddar cheese and half condensed milk/regular milk. Forgot to add the Parmesan cheese so just added it to the bread crumb mixture- ended up being a great mistake. Also, added liquid smoke!

Delicious! What I used is 1/2 cup shredded cheddar, 1/2 cup shredded Colby Jack, 1/2 cup monzerella, and 1/2 cup fontina. It definetly wouldn't be enough with just cheddar and Parmesan. I recommend doing cheddar, Colby jack and at LEAST one more cheese. I used gluten free AP flour, and gluten free breadcrumbs. I also added 1/2 teaspoon dry mustard.

Great recipe. Don't be afraid to mix other cheeses, most creamy cheeses work well. I always substitute potato chips for the bread crumbs. Same method, lays original or Jays if you can find them are my and my family's favorite. Can't go wrong ever with this recipe and you can make it your own or different every time just by mixing cheeses without messing it up. Yum, going to make a batch tonight!

I added some crispy organic bacon bits and Italian herbs and it was amazing ! My 6 yr old helped me make it and when she tasted it she asked if could please make it every night ! That's a huge compliment as she is a Super fussy eater . I served it with steamed veggies on the side to make it a bit healthier ! Yummmm

I was gonna give 4 stars but with the recommendations of a couple of people and a bit of my own it turned out better than any recipe for Mac n Cheese that I've ever made.I subbed a cup of the milk with chick broth added dry mustard, garlic and onion powder then used half the cheddar with apple wood smoked greyier(check the spelling) and 1/4 parm cheeses then instead of browning the bread crumbs I just broiled at the end and this turned out so great. The most creamy and delicious Mac n Cheese ever. Like one person said a heart attack type of dish but dang it was worth it

I made it just the other night at a sleepover with my friend and since we did not have milk, we substituted it with cream to make the roux.
Since cream is of course much thicker than milk I added a very little amount of water to thin out the sauce. 
Also, we didn't have breadcrumbs but I did something weird to add the extra later of crunch. It was a chicken and sweet corn Mac n cheese, so I had also stir fried some chicken and corn with onion and garlic in a pan before adding it to the baking dish.
I let bits of the stir fry to stick to the pan(it had assumed the texture of crackling) and scraped it off once the chicken was done. I sprinkled this scraped off crackling over the macaroni and cheese before popping it in the oven. Turned out just fine.

Same recipe I have been using for almost 50 years, except mine calls for about 1 teaspoon dry mustard.  It enhances the cheese.  I didn't have bread crumbs on night, so I topped with crushed Potato Chips.  Now it is the only way my family wants it.  My kids didn't know about Mac'n'Cheese in a blue box until they went to college.

Came out perfectly!
SALT THE PASTA WATER, FOLKS!
And use extra sharp or sharp cheddar.
I admit to tweaking the topping - I doubled the toasted bread crumb part, and alternated layers of more cheese with the breadcrumbs, creating a nice crunchy layer.  
DH took one bite, then all I heard were 'yum' sounds in between bites of food.
After his second helping, he moaned "Oh, honey, that was SO good!"

This is just an absolutely basic mac and cheese recipe with not enough seasoning.  A little dry mustard, possibly a dash of hot sauce would improve it 100%.  As it is,it is too bland.,

I added some chunks of mozzarella to recipe and let mix sit a few minutes. If I don't serve this immediately, reheating it, at serving removes all excess liquid.

i thought this recipie was wonderful....i used a smoked applewood cheddar  (highly recommend) and parm, with some montreal smoked meat. i admit that i too panicked and added extra flour to the sauce before i baked it (mistake).  i should have read the reviews  first.  it was tasty but a little too thick, which was my fault.   i find that the parm made it a little gritty also. not sure if it was because i used frozen pregrated parm or not?  next time i will add a different cheese other than parm. i can see how some people might have thought it was bland if they didn t use sharp/stronger cheeses.  i would definately make this again.  it is a great stand alone recipie or base to be more creative.  next time pulled pork,gouda and applewood smoked cheddar....yum!

Glad I tried this recipe. Turned out moist and cheesy. Kids enjoyed it! I did make changes. They were cutting the milk in half using 12 oz of milk & 12 oz of evaporated milk. I added .5 cup more of the cheddar cheese & 1 cup of mozzarella cheese. Thanks for sharing your recipe.

It was a hit here, I was having a craving for homemade mac n cheese and this really hit the spot! My picky husband even liked it and he loaded up on seconds.  Next time I think I will also try some Gouda or gruyere cheese and some other seasonings in it  but this will definitely be my go-to recipe from now on!

I think I actually outdid my Grandmother's Mac and cheese! DELICIOUS! I substituted heavy cream, for half of the milk, and used Panko, for the breadcrumb topping. I also threw in some leftover chicken, to male a complete meal. Perfect with a simple salad.    
This recipe is a keeper!!

First time making this recipe. Not bad, I felt it was a little bland, but will use some of the other advice and use dry mustard next time.

This recipe is delicious. The only thing I did differently - I mixed about one third of a cup of grated Parmesan cheese with the breadcrumbs for the topping! I'm so excited to make this again.

I made this according to the recipe. However, it did not come out tasting so great. It was easy but not cheesy enough. I added more cheese than the recipe called for but still everyone agreed there was very little cheese taste. If I made this again I would add much more cheddar than the recipe called for.

I added jalapeños and bacon. It was pretty easy and good but still somewhat bland so maybe use different cheese(s) next time. But will definitely make again :)

This was delicious!  It's super versatile.  Apparently my big kids had a late night quesadilla party and used most of my cheddar cheese.  So I had to supplement with pepper jack and some cream cheese.  SO GOOD!  Add some good spices and make it your own.  Great recipe!!

I made this but it was not good.... until I melted some horizon organic singles on top and then mixed to combine. That made it awesome! I added the paprika & dry mustard to the cheese sauce. Once it was out I put it back in with that horizon organic american cheese bc it lacked the creamy texture my kids crave, and wooooohooo yum!

Excellent, easy mac and cheese recipe.  I made this twice and it was a family favorite.  I did not alter the recipe the first time I made this.  It was excellent.  On the second attempt, I didn't realize I had run out of breadcrumbs, and had to make a substitution.  I topped it with French's fried onions.  My family still enjoyed the dish.

This recipe is Great! It is one of my Go To standards.
I live alone ( I know! Sad! Right?) So I cut the recipe in half so I have half now and half for lunch the next day.
I like adding in some cayenne for a bit of a kick, and sometimes I substitute Blue Cheese for the Parmesan! Awesome!

I agree with everyone about the soupy mixture before baking. I was worried that I had way to much sauce and that it was was to watery, just looked like milk to me.  I thought my breadcrumbs wouldn't even stick to the top but the texture turned out perfect after baking.  I thought the sauce was a little bland however and I even added garlic powder, salt and pepper so additional seasoning is definitely required.

We loved this baked macaroni and cheese recipe! It was a little watery when it came out of the oven because the sauce was not all absorbed yet.  The texture improved after it cooled, and the dish tasted even better when we ate the leftovers the next day.

Pretty sure this is served in Heaven because it sure does tastes like Heaven. It's so creamy! I've never made Mac-N-Cheese from scratch so I can't compare it to any other recipes and I can't find a reason to try any other recipes. THIS is exactly what I was craving in my mouth. I did however use Ritz crackers instead of breadcrumbs. I also used  2 1/2 cups of heavy whipping cream with a 1/2 cup of water instead of 3 cups of milk because that's what I had in the fridge. I served this delectable dish with a mountain of Broccoli to clear my  conscience  
I can say with no doubt that I will never buy the blue box  Mac & cheese ever again.

I used some no boil noodles to cut down my time.  I also used pre-grated parmesan.  I may experiment with other cheeses next time.  It was very easy to make and tasted good.  Mine made 8 servings and was about  360 calories.  I did not add the crispy bread topping, though.

Worked out pretty well, you'll need a reasonably sized dish to bake it in also, over all a great dish and perfect for dinner. Remember to put the bread crumbs on top of the cheese sauce, i had misread it and put it on before. (Blenders work well for crushing toast and making bread crumbs quick for this recipe)

This is the closest example of what my grandmother used to make before she died 27 years ago. I have been looking ever since, this recipe nails it. I did not have sharp cheddar at hand, but old white cheddar was just as good. The only change I made was adding white pepper to the cheese mixture after tasting before pouring onto the pasta. I too was concerned for the runniness of the sauce, but it does thicken nicely as moisture evaporates during cooking. I guaranty this will be doubled or tripled for a large dinner.

I followed the recipe pretty much as written with one addition, cayenne pepper.  Perfect amount of liquid.  I increased all ingredients by about a half and used a larger baking dish.  Turned out perfect for a rainy day.  Yummmm

I usually make mac n cheese with pepper jack but I wanted something comforting/old fashioned. This is my old recipe, by and large. Those who found the texture gritty...you are heating the cheese sauce way too high and the proteins are separating. Low and slow to get that creamy texture. I always sauté 1-2T finely chopped onions and add Worcestershire sauce for some punch. Concur with the dried mustard but put a tiny bit of nutmeg in the dish...not much. It brings out the flavour of the cheese. If it is a little too sour...cheat and put 1/4tsp of sugar in the sauce. But a good solid recipe.

Made it for superball party.  Everyone loved it.  Sauce was running (just like everyone else said), but firmed up in the oven.    I skipped the breadcrumbs (due to time),  and it was still delicious

I made it and it's great for Lenten Friday meals when not eating meat. I added a pound of ground beef this time since it's not Lent yet.

This is my go-to Mac n cheese recipe.  It's excellent as is- sometimes I add extras like meat or veggies to make it more of a main course.
The sauce is creamy and there is a good amount, but it tends to dry out when put in the fridge and reheated the next day.

I was excited to try this but it was a big disappointment. It had no flavor at all, and was not cheesy at all. I love cheese, so I thought it was just me but my husband who doesn't like cheese that much said there wasn't enough cheese either. All bad.

This was amazing! Everyone loved it and the entire dish was gone by the end of the night. My father-in-law was scolded by his sister for licking the bowl!
So I can attest that it is bowl-licking good! :)

This recipe was just so-so. Way too much milk for the sauce made it runny, and not enough macaroni. So it was not the rich and creamy mac & cheese I was hoping for.

I made this following the recipe 100% I was highly disappointed the noodles were mush. I ended up throwing it away. I normally would have only cooked the noodles maybe three minutes and then made sauce and cooked in oven but I followed your directions to cook the noodles as normal before adding the sauce.

Omg....awesome is all I can say. I made it twice...first time I followed the recipe exactly. It's was wonderful. The second time   I doubled the recipe ( I used 16 Oz. Of elbow noodles) and added 1lb. Of crumbled bacon and 8 Oz. Of cream cheese. Oh man...I can't tell you how good it was...you have to try it for yourself!

I added cooked chicken breast in bite size peices to this  because my guys are meat eaters. Overall it was quite tasty, but messy to make and the grated cheese I used would not melt in the milk and butter mixture. I thought it was too much milk and actually poured some off. It was a "gloppy consistency when I poured it over the mixed chicken and pasta. I cooked it an extra 5 minutes because it was such a big casserole with the chicken added.  The guys proclamed it excellent. I might make it again with a different brand of cheese, without the chicken.

This was very simple and nice and creamy. The only thing I personally enjoy is a little more crunch on top so I maybe would broil it a bit for the last few minutes of baking?

Instead of 3 cups of milk, I used 1-1/2c milk and 1-1/2c chicken broth with uncooked pasta.  I also put it in my pressure cooker...woooowwwww!  Extremely yummy that the broth and milk infused  into the noodles instead of water!

Only gave 4 stars as I changed it as per previous review suggestions. Very yummy. I made with a variety of cheese that we had in the house. As per other reviews, I used 1 can evaporated milk, 1/2c sour cream,  and topped up with milk to make 3 cups. I sautéed garlic and onions in the butter before making the roux. I added cumin and mustard seed  while the sauce was cooking (I had no paprika).  It does look like way too much sauce when you pour it over the macaroni and it looks very runny. It works out OK. I found my noodles over cooked, so I am going to try baking them from raw next time .

I used two cans of evaporated milk and one cup of milk. I didn't do the bread crumb topping because my kids don't like that. It was good but not creamy. I might try to follow the recipe as written next time.

Even though my family enjoyed this Mac 'n cheese, I'm only giving this recipe 4 stars because I feel it needs some changes. First, the title should read "Baked...". I hadn't realized it was a baked dish until I started making it, so I had to make some changes with the amount of milk/sauce. Also, I would substitute the milk with half and half or even heavy cream, or a combination of these three, according to your preference. Also, instead of Parmesan, I would add some Gouda. Gouda gives this a rich, smoky flavor that really tastes amazing. The parm gave it a slightly grainy texture. Perhaps baking it would give a different result. Another tip: make sure the pasta is a bit undercooked before baking it, so it doesn't turn out too soft.

I made it and it was a huge hit. I did find the cheese sauce just a little "soupy," so will use a bit less milk next time. I did add a little chopped onion and sauted with the butter and added peas before baking.

Great Dish, a few tips/changes I would suggest. 1) The Milk/cheese will seem too runny. It's not, it will bake nicely into the noodles. 2) Add Onion to the butter before adding flour. 3) Add some Dry Mustard 4) Add frozen peas (sounds weird but it's delicious) 5) Only half cook the pasta as it will definitely continue to cook in the oven while baking.

This was a hit.  I will repeat what I read -that the sauce may seem like overkill at first but trust that it won't be.    Definitely worth a try,  I'm glad to have this one up my sleeve.

I wasn't very impressed with this recipe. The texture was a bit grainy. Maybe it was the brand of cheddar I used or the roux wasn't proper, I'm not sure but the flavor was good. I will try again using a better cheddar and see if it makes a difference, mmm maybe some pepper jack too!

Thanks Judy for this yummy recipe.  It was a hit at a gathering with friends and one even said it was the fanciest mac and cheese she had ever eaten. As others stated the cheese sauce may look too thin but after it is baked it is perfect.

Wow! This was easy to make and fun to make. I did Japanese panko instead of bread crumbs (which actually made a big difference). I used the full 1/2 cup of crumbs, and there was not too much. It was crunchy and delicious and I think it would probably work better than regular bread crumbs.

I followed the recipe otherwise, and it turned out great! It wasn't too bland or lumpy, and I'm surprised that it tastes so good, while the ingredients are healthy for mac & cheese. 

At first I thought the sauce was too runny to bake within 30 minutes, but it turned out perfectly! 

It served my four-person (two adults, two kids) family, and we actually had 2/3 left, so if you don't feel like having leftovers you could possibly divide the recipe in half.

Don't eat this before going anywhere important... it's heavy and will make you a bit sleepy! If you eat too much, it will sit like a rock in your stomach. 

I will definitely make this again, and I definitely recommend this.

Had to make a few changes due to what was available, tripled the batch. Added a tsp of mustard powder, salted the boiling noodles, used 8 C dehydrated milk reconstituted, used 1/2 C Monterey jack cheese, a 32 oz bar of processed cheddar cheese (similar to velveeta, accept it's natural) and 3/4 C Grated parmesan, also used whole wheat flour for the roux. Even the Hubby ate it...and he hates mac& cheese. I stuffed bell peppers with it and topped with bacon pieces.

Great recipe! I also thought the roux would be a tad thin but it quickly thickens up after pouring over the pasta. Being a little short on the shredded cheese, I added a small brick of Velveeta...turned out great! A++++

I did not use breadcrumbs or paprika. I also used half evaporated milk, half regular milk.  At the end I turn on the broiler for about 5 minutes (watch this closely!!!) To bubble and brown the top.  It was a hit at a work Christmas party, my husbands Christmas carry in, and at home with 3 daughters.

I made this without reading any reviews first. Right away, I doubled the recipe because I had a 16oz package of elbow macaroni. I had no problems with making the roux and my cheese sauce turned out smooth, thick and creamy. I was super worried about having too much sauce, and didn't pour all of in the dish. Still, I thought it was too much, and was relieved when it turned out perfect. A little salt and pepper went a long way. My son loved it and my husband did, too, although he said he would have liked a cruncher topping. I thought it was just right.

This was amazing! Awesome comfort food on a cold winter's night.  I doubled this recipe and added a small block of velveeta along with the cheddar, omitted the parmesan cheese and added some mozzarella too.

Couldn't find my mom's recipe and found this beauty instead! Never made a roux so easily, the cheese sauce was perfect, and all together it was delicious! SUPER easy to make and an instant favorite for comfort food, can't wait to do it again. Made mine with turkey bacon, and along with the bread crumbs (Progresso) I added actual bread crumbs, sautéing them just like the others. Additionally, it wouldn't be home made mac and cheese without adding something crunchy to the top. Added some bits of tortilla chips to the top with the last 5 minutes of baking and it's perfect!

This was fantastic, everyone really liked this. I followed the recipe exactly.     Can't wait to make again.
I made this a second time and it was better the first time.  This time I used parm/romano cheese and the romano has too strong of a flavor for me. I will stick with parmesan and cheddar is so good.

I would say it was really good, but not excellent. My husband really liked it and had 2nds, and he isnt one to have 2nds most of the time. I would say I absolutely love the mac n cheese at cracker barrel is so smooth and creamy, this is a step down, sorry. Worth making again but making not adding parmesan cheese and maybe 4 different types of cheddar.

Made it twice! Original recipe first, the breadcrumbs were bit of a distraction from the core texture of the dish. RE-make; add 1 cup of pepper jack, 4 oz of diced green chilies (mild,) 1/2 teaspoon dry mustard, Cut 1/2 cup of Parmesan down to 1/8 cup. Before placing in oven sprinkle more Parmesan lightly on top, then sprinkle equal amount of breadcrumbs (uncooked) on top the Parm. As the macaroni gets mixed be sure to add S/P... Taste and adjust S/P before applying Parm/Breadcrumb topping. (TIP: heavier on pepper than salt.)

My 1st ever attempt at making homemade mac & cheese, and I am so very glad I chose this recipe!  I did take the recommendations of others and I used 1 1/2 cups of milk and 1 1/2 cups of evaporated milk.  I also eliminated the grated parmesan cheese and decided to use 1 1/2 cups of Colby  Monterey Jack instead.  This turned out simple amazing.  I also took the suggestions about adding some seasoning to the cheese mixture while it was cooking.  I used garlic powder and onion powder, not much I would say about a 1/2 teaspoon of each.  Something happened when I put the browned bread crumbs onto of the dish and in the end I had to scrape the topping off because that part did not turn out.  However, this did not effect the taste of the dish at all.
This recipe is definitely going in the recipe book and I will be making it again.

Disappointed. Dry and a bit of a waste of all those nice ingredients. Ended up throwing out half the pan because nobody wanted the leftovers.

My husband loves macaroni and cheese and told me this isn't it. I followed this exactly and wound up discarding the entire mix. Thanks a lot for ruining what was supposed to be my anniversary dinner. Should have known better when the recipe called for a roux.

I added 1 lb of pepper rubbed thick cut bacon to this recipe. I also doubled the pasta into a 9x13 casserole dish.  
In the future I may add 1 tbsp more flour to thicken the sauce and more cheese as I have an unhealthy addiction to cheese and cheese based products.  
I also will cut the bread crumb mixture in half as it was a little too much and interfered wth the overall flavor of the dish.
It was very easy to make and can be ready in an hour!  Ace recipe!

Not as flavorful as hoped, next time will use whipping cream instead of milk and maybe a sharper cheddar or a jack cheese to boost flavor.

A really good recipe. I used extra sharp, smoked gouda, and gruyere cheeses. I also used other suggestions and added garlic powder and Dijon mustard. I also used canned milk 2 to one.

Easy and yummy!  I added garlic to the breadcrumbs (because my husband is a garlic freak).  My daughter still prefers Kraft, but I can forgive her because she's 8.  I loved it, and so did guests.

It looked great  just like the picture. The texture was gritty or curdled I'm not sure which. I assumed it was the the bread crumbs or the pre grated parmesan cheese. So I made it again the next day with less bread crumbs and parmesan that had to be grated. The same thing happened again, a  gritty curdled texture.  There is two things that make a perfect mac and cheese and that is taste and texture. This did not hit the mark on either one.

An excellent Mac and Cheese.
I added 1/4 tsp. of dry mustard powder to the flour,  but that was the only change I made.  The whole family enjoyed the dish.

I prefer a dry mac and cheese, but my husband prefers creamy, so I set out to find a new recipe.  So glad I did!  We both loved this one!  I made it just as stated, but I used a shallow dish to bake it in, so that it would be a little drier for me, but still plenty cheesy for my husband.  He's requested that I make it again today for Thanksgiving!

There is not much you can do to make Mac and cheese any better, but this recipe was close to the best. I used half heavy cream half milk to get it bit creamier. Other than that I stayed with the recipe. It came out great.

Don't fully cook the macaroni fully or it'll be too mushy after baking.  I found it bland and disappointing, thoughts echoed by my two kids.  Kraft Dinner is better.

This was a good basic macaroni and cheese! I did add more sharp cheddar and Parmesan, as well as minced onions and paprika in the cheese itself instead of on top. Add a little ketchup and it's great!

It was pretty good.  Easy too.  Hubby actually loved it,  I was impressed, but not falling over in love.  I used half cream and half milk.  As a bunch of other reviews said,  there seemed to be waaaay too much sauce,  but it all fixed itself in the oven.  Don't freak out,  it's supposed to look like soup before the oven part.  I didn't have breadcrumbs so I crushed up Ritz crackers,  wasn't too crazy about the topping..  Also I used half sharp cheddar,  some motazarella, and a colby  jack blend..  It was good.  Next time I'm totally going to add bacon and see what that does to it,  I bet then it'd be a 5 star in my book!

I used shredded instead of grated parmesan cheese.  My husband and I didn't care for the texture.  The melted cheese wasn't creamy like it wasn't completely melted and was oily, it was very bland and we didn't care for the bread crumbs on top.  Won't make it again.

Made  this  almost as directed; made a few changes based on what I had - 2% milk , whole wheat elbow macaroni, and fat free cheddar. I also seasoned to taste with salt, pepper and Lowry's seasoning salt. Granted, I'm no mac-and-cheese connoisseur like some reviewers here seem to be, but it tasted fan-freakin-tastic to me and my kiddos. Loads better than the processed boxed kind, and I felt better about serving it to my children too, even if it's not exactly waistline friendly. In short, comforting and delish as-is, no major changes necessary. At least not to my unrefined mac-and-cheese palate. ;)

Added some chopped leftover ham and some peas, just 'cause we like them.  Used 1/4 cup flour to 1/4 cup butter for the roux.  Great way to use up 3 cups of milk.  Very creamy and satisfying. Total comfort food.

A smooth, creamy comfort food!  
I tweeted it a little: into the roux I added one pressed garlic clove. Into the sauce I included 1/8 tsp dry mustard and a couple shakes of Worcestershire. 
For company I added lobster, it was a HIT!!!

Great meal for the family on cold winter nights hear in Maine. 
Whenever I make this I sauté some red peppers which gives a unique flavor twist to this old time favorite.

I have not made this but I cook enough to know it is pretty decent.  One suggestion - do not buy cheap parmesan or this will be too salty.  I don't mean you have to buy the most expensive either.  Just a good quality.  Romano seems to be less salty to me.  

Finally, I cook the macaroni about 2 minutes less because you're going to be baking it for 30 minutes.  Agree with others dry mustard is a very good addition.

This a basic recipe for mac and cheese. I use 3 tbl. flour , 3 tbl. butter to 2 1/4 c. milk for the white sauce.  I add whatever cheese I have: Cheddar, a little pepper jack  adds a little zip and a couple of slices of American cheese makes it smoother.  I also use prepared mustard. (about 1tsp) This never lasts long in our house.

This is a good basic recipe. I didn't add crumbs until the last moments of baking.  Also, it is bland if you don't add your favorite seasonings.  I added parsley, garlic, black pepper and a touch of salt to the cheese mixture.  Also, added some 1/2 & 1/2.  On a different occasion, I used Asiago cheese w/rosemary and garlic and plain cheddar instead of sharp.

Nice basic recipe, but boring taste.  I remade this and added half tap. Mustard powder, a couple of shakes of Worcestershire and half teaspoon curry powder to the sauce,  then it received rave reviews from my family and the company that was over for dinner that night.

I love this recipe! so easy and simple to make. Creamy, cheesy, with the bread crumbs on top was great.  I have made a similar dish but used stale potato chips crushed up as a topping.  I use any flavor, just crush finely. I never thought of the bread crumbs. Kids said it was just as good! but I did add a dash of pepper, and salt

Kick it up a notch and use grated jalapeno cheese and mexican blend grated cheese.   This is sooo good and creamy, just like my mom made when us kids were growing up.  After trying this recipe you will gag on the box mix !  :-)

It makes cheese and Mac not Mac and cheese. I thought it would be too cheesy but I followed the recipe because I hadn't made it before. I should have followed my gut and made a lb of pasta to begin with instead of making it edible and delaying dinner by 15 minutes.

This is definitely a favorite in my house! I use almond milk instead of regular milk and add chicken to make it a macaroni chicken casserole. Also added more cheddar.

I love this recipe but made it my own way! I made it for 8 people so I used these as my measurements:

1 pound elbow pasta
2 cup sharp cheddar (pre shredded)
2.5 cups 2% milk
1/2 cup sour cream
1/2 cup butter
1/4 cup flour (white)
1 packet of bacon hand shredded (pre cooked)
1 teaspoon frank's red hot
1 tablespoon of spices (family recipe)
1 teaspoon paprika

I made this very different from the main recipe posted but everyone loved it, wanted seconds and raved about it! I even surprised myself and cannot wait to have more for dinner tonight. Amazing!

I have made homemade mac & cheese for as long as I can remember (I got it from my mama). I only gave this one 3 stars because it was missing a few things that give it it's 'yummy', 'go for seconds' taste. I have always used a teaspoon of prepared mustard (I know, shocker!) it is a stronger flavor plus you can adjust the strength as you cook the sauce. Also, please use salt, pepper and any other seasoning you love in the sauce. Personally, I love a little Garlic and Onion Powder taste to my mac & cheese. Add all these seasonings BEFORE you add the cheeses, that way you can get the perfect flavoring for your sauce!  Good luck, and enjoy!

Yum! Used almond milk and it worked well. Also used leftover parmesan popcorn shrimp as the toping and oldbay along with the paprika along with some extra graded parm. Made it from a side dish to a main course, going to try it with leftover chicken fingers choped up next time.

This was great! I added 1/2 an onion, 1lb chicken breast, and a couple dashes of mustard powder. For cheese I did an italian blend (moz, parmesan etc.), a sharp cheddar blend (orange and white), and a colby blend. When I browned the bread crumbs I also seasoned them with the paprika. Got lots of compliments and will definitely make again!

A little disappointed. It seemed like way too much sauce for such little macaroni, and I think I was right as the macaroni was drowning in sauce. It was a bit bland, and I think 1/2 cup of bread crumbs were far too much as all I could taste were bread crumbs in my mouth in every bite. I will have to read through all of the reviews and see what modification suggestions were made if I'm going to try "this" recipe again.

Really good, I was nervous about how watery the sauce looked, but it thickened up while cooking it. It was a little bland. We added salt and pepper to it. Definitely want to make again but add some jalapeños or something to give it a little kick.

I made this exactly per the instructions and I have to agree w/others that the consistency was a little weird. I stirred it slowly until all the cheese was melted so I'm not sure why. Anyway,  it was creamy as I had hoped for but lacking in flavor. Maybe it was me but I think I'll move onto the next recipe.

I followed the recipe exactly and my husband and I couldn't be more pleased with the outcome.   The  sharp cheddar and freshly shredded Italian Parmigiano Reggiano cheeses made a smooth sauce  which were complimented by the butter toasted
whole grain breadcrumbs.  This recipe replaces the one I have used for years.  Thank you Julie.  Well done!.

Our absolute favorite Mac and cheese. It usually thickens really well and isn't super creamy but we still love it! The browned breadcrumbs on top really makes the difference. We make his regularly and double the recipe when we have family over for dinner. I always pair it with awesome garlic Parmesan breadsticks for the perfect dinner! And there is always leftovers for the next day, and they reheat well for it too (finally, leftovers to look forward to!)

First, after reading reviews, I took the recipe as listed here (a good base) and then doctored it up.  It was amazing!  I used an Italian truffle cheddar, and replaced the parm with a mix of romano and blue cheese.  As the milk was heating, I added (to the cooking milk mix)  smoked paprika, dried mustard, black pepper, and a smoked sea salt - and tasted the blend as I was cooking (very important).  When I added the cheeses, it didn't need anything else.   I then cut up a pre-cooked ham steak (breakfast size) into chunks, mixed that with the macaroni, then poured the cheesy mix over.  I used crushed garlic croutons instead of the breadcrumbs on top (sautéed in butter prior to topping) and sprinkled a titch more smoked paprika over the top.  It smelled phenomenal as it baked - and tasted even better.   I highly recommend that you taste as you go.

To preface, I am west indian and needed more flavour. The first time I made it as directed and it was too bland.

Second time, I wanted to make it a one-pot meal that's gluten-free. I used gluten-free macaroni. I substituted flour with coconut flour. Added broccoli, mustard, garlic and Cayenne pepper. The next day I added ground turkey.

This is a fabulous recipe! I was out of cheddar cheese so used a co-jack blend plus swiss cheese. I also ground up some garlic cheese croutons that I had for the topping and in my opinion  made a great switch up from plain to extra flavorful. 
The only thing that I noticed a little off was the amount of pasta so I doubled that and it was perfect. 

Definitely making this again!

A few tips, I used tilamook sharp cheddar, added Neuske's  applewood smoked bacon and fresh cracked pepper. Also save some cheese to top it with before baking. Makes a great bacon Mac!!

I made a few changes.  I added 1/2 tsp of good quality dijon mustard, and small pieces of camembert (because expiry date was approaching) as I was a little short of cheddar.
For the topping I sprinkled crumbled Ritz crackers over the breadcrumbs (my new topper).  YUM!

if youre using the store bought grated parmesan in the green bottle. DO NOT use 1/2 a cup.  you will have parmesan mac and cheese. Use around 1/8th of a cup just to bring some flavor differential but not too overpowering. 5 stars on simplicity 4 on overall taste

I am rating this recipe two stars because I found it to be too bland. It needed salt or something. We even added a dash of ground mustard as other recipes called for but that didn't do the trick. We also used whole milk. The consistency  of the cheese sauce was just fine. I didn't find this to be runny as others have mentioned. I also found the quantity of bread crumbs to be just right however my husband mentioned it there were too many.

forget boxed, I make this at least once a week for my kids. We love it. The breadcrumbs make it! I have made it without them and it is still good but not AS good. I agree with another review, it is runny before cooking, its suppose to be, it will thicken when cooking. Of course adding bacon sets this over the top

I made this for my family several times now.  It is delicious! The only difference is that I didn't use the paprika. My family tells me to please never ever bring home boxed mac and cheese from the store. It was creamy, buttery, and rich.  Definitely not to be made every week if you are watching your waistline, but worth it on your cheat day.

I thought the chedder cheese was to strong a taste.   I had to add another 1-1/2 cup milk to dilute it down.
My favorite is of 50 years  Velveeta cheese and no bread crumbs on top.

Made this recipe... i used 2 cups of half and half instead of 3 cups of milk, instead of 2 cups of cheddar I subbed 1 cup for mozzarella... i used 1/3 cup garlic parmesan basil butter, didn't use bread crumbs( topped with a sprinkle of cheese), used some pepper and some salt... DO NOT ADD ANY EXTRA SALT TO THIS RECIPE... the cheeses i used were salty enough...Other then that it was really good... i may mix up the cheeses next time and use pepperjack

8oz dry of pasta? I tried it, and it became cheese soup with a few noodles floating in it. So halfway through I had to cook another 8oz of pasta, add that, then it had the right amount. Once I did that, added a little garlic as somebody else recommended, and added a fair amount of cayenne to the bread crumbs, it was pretty good.

Didn't care for the breadcrumbs and paprika, but other than that it was good.  I followed the recipe as is and my family loved it.  We used pinwheel-shaped pasta for my 6-year-old :). I'm about to make it again and omit the breadcrumbs and paprika this time.  Easy dish to make!

First of all I added 3 cloves or garlic but that wasn't enough. The mac & cheese was very bland. I should have added about 6 cloves of garlic and instead of using 1/2 cup of Parmesan cheese I should have just done 3 cups of cheddar cheese. Next time with these improvements it should be fantastic.

It's a pretty good backbone for macaroni and cheese, but you definitely have to add some more to it. I added some garlic, basil, and pepper to it while baking, and after it was done, I quickly realized that it needed some salt (or perhaps another sauce/condiment to tie it all together): it was a little bland. That might be because of the fact that I didn't use as much Parmesan as the recipe had asked for. I'd still bake it again, though (with additions, of course).

To make this less boring, use cream cheese and sour cream instead of 1 cup of the milk and add an extra cup of EXTRA SHARP cheddar cheese. Also don't forget a dash of garlic powder and a tsp of freshly ground mustard seed in the 'sauce'. If this isn't good enough for you, you don't know mac & cheese.

Like others have said, it didn't have enough flavor. So this time I used 12 oz box of GF Penne Pasta, 1/2 cup Parmesan, 1/2 cup jalepeno jack, and 3 cups of sharp cheddar.  Also used one can of evaporated milk for part of the milk.  Added some ground mustard and garlic powder.  I also didn't use any bread crumbs.  But all in all I really like the base recipe and it gave me times and temperatures.

Very good.  I would increase the roux, milk, and cheese to make it more saucy and add two pinches of salt to the sauce.

Good base, but thought it was on the bland side. I'll try again, but adding dry mustard, salt and pepper, and less bread crumbs. Oh and I also added more macaroni-8 oz. seemed way too small for the amount of cheese sauce.

It was delicious. Made it for a party & it was all gone. I did follow the advice from some other reviews & added minced garlic, a little  black pepper, mustard powder, and used a Parmesan/Romano blend (the refrigeratored kind, not the powder). I also just topped it with panko breadcrumbs & didn't bother with the step of cooking them in a pan first. Still absolutely fantastic!!!

Easy and good recipe for mac and cheese. We did add black pepper and garlic powder to the cheese sauce - would have been a little bland without those additions.

Creamy! My 1st time making homemade Mac. Others I have tried were dry and crumbly- THIS was thick and creamy and moiste- even w the bread crumbs. It would have been alittle bland w/out my addition of salt, pepper, and onion powder- season your bread crumbs too or use crushed Ritz. My husband LOVED this and ate 3 helpings. The kids however were not as into it. My 8yr old ate it and likes it ok but the 3 year old- who requested this dish!- took 2 bites and said he prefers Kraft. Whatever, he's picky. I liked it. Also, for your rue, 4 TBS of butter needs 4TBS of flour. Cook that for a few minutes then very very gradually wisk in the milk. Cook that down for 3 min before adding your cheese in handfuls- grate it yourself, the pre-grated  won't melt as well.

This is a classic baked Macaroni  and Cheese recipe, which is a relief from all the glamour mac and cheese recipes that are trendy today. You have to have the patience to make a roux, and then slowly add the milk and cheese, which can be hard to do if you are a new cook, or are in a rush. It's the sort of thing best done while chatting with a friend or listening to a podcast. 

The only change I made was to add a little garlic salt to the cheese sauce and not brown the bread crumbs in butter - it's fatty enough already, and browned bread crumbs can be a pain. 

I also went really easy on the bread crumbs - just a dusting  across the top - and then did a similar dusting of paprika. It turned out pretty, and very good.

Made  with 16 ounces of pasta as some reviews said. Forget it too dry! Stick with 8 ounces .  Did add dry mustard, garlic powder and used 2 cups evaporated milk and 1 cup milk instead. Taste was good, but can't wait to try it with less Mac !

I've added 1/2 lb of bacon and more cheese.
The cheese sauce IS the proper amount, so don't fret.
This is a fantastic recipe, simple, easy, fast and OH SO yummy!
Try it.... you'll love it

This was great! Made a double batch. I added one extra cup of cheddar, some dry mustard, and half/half to replace one cup of milk. My go to recipe now--thanks for sharing. I made it early in the morning and cooked it later that day and it turned out fine.

This tasted so good. My family loved it after I altered it a bit. The milk I halved it  with evaporated milk. Added salt, pepper and 1/2 tsp of garlic powder to the butter and flour mixture.  I used Italian panko breading to the top and also added left over taco beef. My family had second helpings before I finished my first.

BIG HIT! Delicious! I RARELY make mac & cheese because I actually don't care for it. But I decided to make it for my family because they love it. I added some ham to it and well, like I said, it was a BIG hit!
5/12/16~Made it a second time tonight and added pepperjack cheese to the cheddar and parm cheeses! Oh, and I added bacon! Fried it up and crumbled it and stirred into the mac and cheese! Yup..it's a winner!

I will make this again. My Husband really liked it he gave it a five star. I made a couple of changes. instead of parmesan I used brie. I also used Panko  bread crumbs. I used bowtie noodles. I added salt and pepper to taste and a dash of granulated onions. My sauce was fine when I mixed it with the noodles but it seemed to breakdown after I took it out of oven.

I made this recipe for my husband and two young children -- it was a big hit.  I added salt and mustard to the cheese sauce.  I also subbed out Parmesan cheese for pepper jack cheese and used Panko bread crumbs.  It was delicious and very easy!

A little too creamy and not enough cheesy! But it was great and know what to add. Also I thought it was a little too much bread crumbs for the pan I baked it in but that was my fault. I sprinkled chopped cooked bacon on top too yum!

Made this a few times. Here are my changes: 1. Added 1 tablespoon of bacon grease to the cheese sauce 2. Added about four pieces of crumbled bacon to the macaroni 3. I used Cracker Barrel sharp cheddar and a block of Chedder-jack for the cheese. 4. Used Toasted Onion crackers and added some more bacon grease to the butter.  5. Made in a 9x13 pan. And yes it seems runny but thickens while cooking.

It's missing a bit of flavour, adding a bit of onion powder, mustard and smoked paprika to the sauce helped liven it up a little. Other than that I only needed 1 3/4 of milk for my batch and found that the sauce still well coated all of the pasta. It's a great base and I'll be making it again with a switch up here and there (like bacon or grilled chicken!)

Good recipe. My own tips for first timers. Don't wait for cheese sauce to thicken at all. When cheese is 3/4 melted, it's ready. Don't add salt to sauce, especially if adding meat. Let cook, then salt to taste. I'd skip the paprika.  Add one small hot dog dash of mustard.

my grandson loves Mac & Cheese, but I  wanted to make it for him without using the box stuff.  this recipe hit it on the head!  I used a sharp cheddar and fresh parmesan, hand grated. My husband who always had homemade Mac & cheese for every birthday growing up, and that I continued the tradition, said this was better than his mom's!  After 30 years of marriage, that was pretty high praise!  but I did add a bit of dry mustard in making the sauce

Good recipe!   Like others, I halved the regular milk and substituted evaporated milk for the remainder.  I also added generous amounts of dry mustard and black pepper.

Family (of picky eaters) loved it.

This recipe firms up as it sits and might even be better after about 30 minutes vs. right out of the oven.

Enjoy!

Has great potential but a little on the bland side. Great as a starter but be prepared to add more to season to your liking.

Delicious!! I used half evaporated milk or pet milk and half 2%.  Add salt and pepper that will give it more of a taste. I also put cubes of cheese in the noodles before I pour the sauce on it. Also cubes of cheese in the sauce... Also a lot more shredded cheese on the top. You can't go wrong with the cheese! It turned out fabulous! Everyone is asking for more!

I used instead:
 ~1/2C mozzarella
~1/2C Sharp Cheddar 
~1/4C Parmeseano Reggiano
1/4lbs Pancetta chopped and fried

And, oh my, it was amazing :-) definitely a great base recipe!

*also, use whisk to combine flour/butter for 2mins, then slowly add milk. Switch to a wooden spoon/scraper and stir in a figure-8 motion until the milk mixture sticks to the back of the spoon enough for you to run your finger through and leave a gap. May seem runny, but it will cook in the oven :-)

great recipe.  simple yet very easy to take and add your own spin too.  My favorite is to mince up about 1/2 of cup of jalepenos and add them to the sauce before you poor it onto the mac.  You can also easily add chicken, bacon or whatever protein you choose.  This is sure to be a crowd favorite.  It has quickly become a staple at family gatherings.

This recipe is simple, easy, and delicious. NOT for the calorie or fat counters! I followed the recipe exactly as written, though I added 3 items... 1/4 tsp. onion powder, 1/4 tsp. garlic powder, and 1 tsp. prepared mustard (all added to the sauce prior to topping the pasta).

I recommend using all organic dairy (butter, cheese, and milk).

Very creamy. I used mild cheddar cheese instead of sharp as it was what I had so it wasn't tasty enoug, but fixable with some salt.  I'd definitely go for sharp next time.

This is the first homemade Mac and Cheese I ever made.  My husband loves Mac and Cheese.  I took the ham out of the crockpot then he asked me what side are we having.  I took the Mac and Cheese out of the oven and you should have seen his eyes.  He said, "You made Mac and Cheese!"  Yes I did.  He could even wait to make his plate.  He grabbed a fork and took a bite out of the pan.  He was in love at first bite.  He even liked it more once it set for a bit.  This is a keeper

Creamy but bland. Not much flavor for the amount of cheese on it.

I like when people make changes. Gives me ideas to substitute when I don't have all the ingredients. I only had 2 cups of skim milk but I had 3/4 c of heavy cream.  Didn't have sharp cheddar but had mild and added some velveeta and the pre shredded Kraft parmasian romano Asiago.  I also used Panko for the bread crumb.  Turned out creamy smooth and buttery. The sauce really does thicken with baking. This is sooooo good will make again and now know I can substitute without messing up. The only way this could have been better is to add crumbled bacon. Everything is better with bacon. Just go for a run after eating. It all balances out.

This recipes was a bit bland to me as well. I did add some garlic powder and a bit more paprika but I do love paprika.   This recipe I think would serve more as a base recipe and you can add your own twist to it. Thoroughly enjoyed!!!

Ok so 8 oz of elbows was not enough for the cheese sauce so I used 16 ozs and I added 1/2 tsp of dry mustard! Yum!!  Saving this recipe to make again and again!

This is pretty close in taste to the box stuff but I did not get that nice yellow colour, which my son associates with 'good tasting' Mac.

This is easy and very good.  Not dry at all like some baked Macaroni is.  My husband LOVED it.  I did add some extra paprika to the sauce as well as some Onion Powder and a dash of Dry Mustard.  These aren't needed, just a personal flavor boost.  We will definitely make this again.

I am giving this recipe 4 stars because it is an awesome base....but I must tell you, that it can be elevated. For those of you who feel it was bland try using different cheeses.  I used fresh grated Parmesan, Romano, sharp cheddar, mozzarella, and Gouda.  I think s good smoked cheese would also be amazing. I will do that next time.  To the rue I added white wine, half and half, milk, and sour cream.  Blended that down until smooth.  I added the cheeses and labored to make it smooth and added cream or milk as needed (I don't measure).  I thought I had ground mustard but couldn't find it, so I used about 2 tablespoons Dijon, chili powder, garlic, pepper, and salt,  I also added ---- cooked, drained, and chopped applewood bacon, and chopped fresh chives.  (as if this wasn't fatty enough but hey...its Mac and cheese for peters sake).  You have to taste the sauce as you can and adjust to your taste.  Once you pour the noodles in, it's hard to fix the taste.  I cooked the noodles until it still had a little hard bite inside in very salty water and after I drained it I poured it into the cheese mix and let it cook until tender on low heat.  Poured it into a pan and topped with panko.

When I made this I was afraid it would be too runny, so I didn't add all the sauce. It came out good but I should have trusted the recipe and used all the sauce. I was surprised how easy this was to make since I'm not much into cooking!

Went over well with the family. I added jalapeño cheddar cheese duck sausage to jazz it up for dinner. Kids suggested more stringy cheese next time. I'll be cooking up this one again and again.

I made this exactly as written except for a cheese substitution and it's delish but be careful with your cheese sauce and the amount of milk and roux ratio cuz mine came out a little more liquidey than I like. No big deal. I used a whole box of Barilla Pronto pasta which is awesome btw and still had too much sauce. I used Velveeta, sharp cheddar and gouda just because I like those flavors and the velveeta and gouda  add a great creaminess. I also added a pinch or two of nutmeg to my sauce cuz no cream sauce is complete without it. Don't forget to salt your cheese sauce and if you're using parm may I suggest salting at the end. Great mac n cheese I'll definitely make again! I took a pic but I don't see where to post with review, hopefully it'll magically appear.

I liked this recipe, i will make it again. I did make some changes. I am not a huge fan of cheddar so i used mexican blend instead and used about a half cup more.  I used the shredded parmesan not grated.  I added salt, garlic salt and pepper to the cheese sauce for a little flavor. The mac and cheese came out with more of an alfredo kind of taste. I t was delicious. I will continue to make it experimenting with the types of cheese. One suggestionwould be to not cook the noodles according to package but maybe halfway as they were extremely mushy when they came out as they continued to cook in the oven and i am not a fan of mushy noodles. Great recipe!

I made this dish yesterday, and it was great. I did make some changes though. Instead of using recommend amt. of butter & milk, I used 1c of skimmed milk and only 2Tbs of butter. I made the roux with the butter & flour and added paprika,  cheese (Roth Ultimate Mac& Cheese) Parmesan salt, pepper & granulated garlic. I did not use bread crumbs. (Saved on calories). I added 1 beaten egg to the mixture poured over the Mac and topped it with sliced sharp cheddar and a bit of the Roth. Baked 30-40mins and the then broiled for 5 min or so until top was golden brown. Delicious!!!

Lost the best mac and cheese recipe I had. Made this on the fly for the family and it was a dissapointment. My daughter didn't eat it, my husband ate it to make me feel better and I ate it cause I hate to waste food. Waste of great ingredients, time and money. Never again!

Really tasty but I added some salt and pepper to the sauce. That really made a difference. It makes almost triple the amount needed for the pasta.

I read through the reviews and noticed a few reviewers mentioned it was missing something.  This recipe is pretty much like the one I make and I always add a little dry mustard and a dash or two of cayenne pepper.   It seems to compliment the cheese ... and my mom always made it that way.

Great consistency and perfect ratio of sauce to pasta. I would use less parm next time. Without any other seasoning/flavorings to speak of, the parm cheese overtook the dish.

It's in the oven right now. I thought my cheese to milk mixture was too watery too, but its fine now :). Thank you for the recipe, should impress my wife!! Oh, and I used a box of turkey stuffing for the bread crumbs instead of ordinary bread crumbs. Comfort food for sure.

Bland, bland, bland. We could get through it, but only after adding garlic and red wine. This needs *something*.Would not make again.

This recipe was fantastic! I didn't have milk on hand so I used a can of evaporated milk and topped off the 3 cups with pasta water after draining my cooked macaroni. I also added about 1/4 cup of jalapeño cream cheese to the sauce. After reading the reviews and having now made it, I will be adding garlic and cooked onion to it the next time I make it!

I agree with the reviews that suggest changing the milk to 1/2 cup with 1 1/2 cups evaporated milk and 1/2 cup of sour cream. I did also add thee 1/2 tsp of dry mustard. Got rave reviews!

Awesome r ecipe!  I actually tripled this recipe to take to Christmas dinner and it did very well even in such a large amount  (I didn't have to alter the recipe really to make  it still turn out good).  The only thing I did differently was use half regular milk and half whipping cream (like some other users are suggesting) to make the sauce a little creamier and then instead of the parmesean cheese, I used American cheese instead  to help make the sauce more creamy and melty.  Instead of bread crumbs, I used crushed, lightly seasoned croutons.  Absolutely delicious and a big hit with the family!

I make this all the time! Great recipe for Mac n cheese that lasts all week. I use 16 oz of noodles instead of 8 and increase cheese to three and a half cups. Sauce thickens up perfectly. I found it does matter what kind of noodle you use, as some bigger noodles will get hard with not being covered enough by the sauce.

I followed the recipe, but did add a dash of worcestershire sauce, dry mustard, and  smoked paprika to the cheese sauce.  The dish was tasty.  Sprinkled a little grated Italian truffle cheese over the top.  I give this recipe 4 stars and it is a "keeper."

This was delicious and very easy to make.  I left out the parm and added more sharp cheddar.  I'm glad I did leave it out as I am reading reviews that say it will be grainy if you use the powder kind in a can, and I didn't have any fresh parm on hand.  I may try it when I get some.  Since I always buy unsalted butter, I added  a little salt.  I also left off the bread crumbs as I have never been a fan of them on my mac and cheese. 

  I never expected this to be low fat, who would?

After reading the reviews, I made a few changes, added additional spices. But, what really matters in Macaroni and cheese, is the CHEESE! It is expensive to buy quality cheese, but this recipe depends on good cheese. And grate it yourself, including the parmesean.

I doubled the recipe, but only using 4 cups of whole  milk and omitting the parmesan and bread crumb topping. I also poured it all into a slow cooker on low. I added salt and pepper to taste .So far it tastes amazing. Waiting for the turkey!  Happy Thanksgiving!

This is one of my favorite mac & cheese dishes. Last time, I added a small package of gruyere (0.4 lbs or 6.4 oz). Gruyere is like a high-end Swiss cheese, found in the Deli or fancy cheese section. It made my sauce extra creamy and delicious. I will make this again and again. My husband and four year-old daughter love it!

I spent 2 hours trying to fix this dish. I changed the calculations to 16 servings which ended up calling for 12 cups of milk. I was left with two casserole dishes filled with noodles floating in a milky cheesy substance.

I made this with one slight change, I added condense milk and decreased the whole milk.  It was a hit!  Everyone loved it and I will be making it again for Thanksgiving.

This is an amazing side dish! I changed a few things and added a few things as well. I always double the recipe and since there's a lot of sauce, I changed the amount of milk. I add 5 cups instead of 6 and I use sharp, Colby jack, parmesan romano and smoked cheddar cheese as well. You can use as much of any as you would like as long as it equals - 4 cups of cheese. At the end of the recipe calls for the bread crumbs but sometimes I exclude those and add of veggies instead. My kiddos really like it with broccoli or cauliflower.  I add the veggies after I'm done baking the macaroni and cheese. It's a very easy recipe and very easy to make! One of my family's favorites !

My second time making this and the first time seemed bland so I added 1 tsp salt to the sauce which made it much better.  Also someone suggested working your roux slowly and it makes a big difference.  Overall very good.  I shared a portion for 1 with another person and it was plenty

WOW! best mac and cheese I've made in a lonnnggggg time. I have to admit I used more cheese than required. In addition to the cheese suggested I added a little less than 1/4 lb of amazing Goat Gouda cheese that I got from Whole Foods.

Delicious.  I took some previous reviewers suggestions and used evaporated milk and added mustard powder. I also added salt and pepper and ancho chili powder.  The consensus at dinner was that the bread crumbs added a "sandy" texture that was unexpected with all the yummy creamy sauce.  My daughter said, "next time, skip the sand".

This was very easy and yummy!  The cheese sauce was not too runny and I followed the directions exactly.  As a base recipe this stands nicely on it's own.

I did add some left over chicken and broccoli that I had on hand, and that was really yummy too!

Just made this today and it turned out really good! I didn't have any cheddar on hand so i used parmesan, asiago, and mozzarella. I was concerned that the mixture was too watery but it cooks well while in the oven. The breadcrumbs aren't necessary but they definitely dress the meal up. Will be makung again for the holidays!

I added an extra tablespoon of flour, a 16 ounce package of frozen broccoli (cooked with noodles) and extra cheese and paprika with some garlic salt and Italian seasonings. So good! Served with a loaf of French bread and with a rotisserie chicken and it made a great meal. Thanks for the recipe!

Best Mac n cheese ever!  The only change would be to double the recipe, which I did! And used Italian bread crumbs for added flavor. The sauce does seem thin at first but bakes up nice and thick. Amazing!

This recipe for Macaroni and Cheese is the original basic your grandma made ... needs absolutely NO tweeking!  BUT ... if you want to step it up a notch add any or all of the following to your dinner crowds taste >>> dry mustard powder, franks hot sauce, pureed celery/onion, saffron (big pinch), herbamare, actually anything goes!  I always add extra milk, as I do not like my pasta dry and only cook my pasta past crunchy ... this allows the sauce to become part of the pasta, and add on the flavor!  Try different cheeses in the bread crumb topping, anything goes!

Loved this Mac and cheese ! Made is  according to recipe , with only adding some bacon in top, and also used Italian seasoned bread crumbs ! Was amazing, the boyfriend loved it. As for the next time I make it, I will use freshly grated Parmesan as opposed to the Kraft pre-grated one. And maybe add a touch of dry mustard. But love the recipe, no need to change anything !

Creamy and delicious. The sharp cheddar and freshly grated Parmesan are a must. I cooked for about 45 minutes to brown the crumbs a bit more. Crunch was nice.

I used about twice as much flour in my roux as the recipe calls for, and cooked it a bit longer for more flavor. The sauce thickens as you cook it, so if it seems too runny, simmer a little longer. I only added salt and pepper and used panko bread crumbs rather than plain. I'll definitely make this again.

I followed the recipe to a tee.  It was the second time I had ever made homemade Mac n cheese. The first was barefoot contessa. I found this one not to be as flavorful due to the different type of cheese, however, my boys loved it and I would definitely make it again but I would use a sharper Parmesan. Very good!

This recipe was ok, but that was only after I made a few modifications.  First off I completely agree with the other reviewers who said that this was a really bland recipe.  That's not necessarily a bad thing as it allows for you to experiment with the ingredients, however I think there needs to be some sort of disclaimer at the beginning  so that people know that they probably shouldn't follow the recipe to the tee.   To add a bit more flavor I added in some salt, onion powder, and mustard powder and I also used seasoned bread crumbs instead of plain ones.  I also had to cut the milk down to 2 cups and add in an extra 1/2 cup of cheese.   I feel it also important to note that you need to double the amount of pasta that the recipe says if you want mac&cheese rather than milky noodle soup.

Tasted pretty good but the look and feel was way off. I knew I shouldn't have cooked the macaroni as directed but rather Al Dente since it's going cook another 30 minutes, but  - I followed the directions like I usually do the first time so I have a base to work from. The Macaroni was way to cooked at the end of this deal.  Also the cheeses aren't that creamy.  I think we should simply turn the heat off when the white sauce is done and melt the cheese into it with the heat off rather than cooking it.   Tasted great but, not presentable and texture is not right on the palate.  We will definitely finish it though

My son is allergic to gluten so I replaced the pasta, flour and bread crumbs with Gluten Free versions. Reduced the milk to 2 cups and added salt and pepper to the roux. Turned out good and he loved it! Served it with pineapple sausage and broccoli :)

LOVE IT! Best Mac N Cheese I've ever made! Actually is the first mac I've made from scratch! Very easy to follow instructions and I had everything to make it already at home, which was nice. I would highly recommend this recipe to everyone!

It didn't have much flavor and was kinda grainy somehow. I'm going to try again and add some seasoning

This is very creamy. However, it needs flavor! I had to add salt, onion, and garlic after taking my first bite. After the minor adjustments my family loved it!

This recipe is pretty bland. I ate it with hot sauce. My kids didn't care for it either. I followed fellow reviewers advice and did half milk and halk evap milk.  All in all this was OK.  I will keep searching for that perfect baked mac and cheese.

I loved this recipe! Homemade Mac n cheese is so good and this is the best tasting recipe I've had! I followed the directions exactly except I used shell noodles, and I did cook some ground beef and added it. It was delicious!

Super good! So creamy and easy to make. I used ingredients that I had on hand so I substituted the sharp cheddar for a Colby/Jack mix and coconut milk instead of cows milk and 16oz of Penne pasta. It had a much milder taste with the Colby/Jack so next time I'll get the cheddar. Also I didn't have breadcrumbs so I used Townhouse crackers which worked nicely since I also used unsalted real butter and I used smoked paprika which brought out a better flavor to the milder cheese. This is a great recipe and will keep it on the monthly family menu regularly.

This is a pretty good recipe. The cheese is your investment ingredient in any mac & cheese recipe so buy the best you can afford.  (If I'm buying U.S. cheese, I prefer ones that are made on the east coast.)  Substitute some of the milk if you want for another milk product such as sour cream or evap milk. Use whole milk instead of skim.  Always boil your pasta in well salted water or even broth.  If it's tastes 'floury',  you're cooking your roux too fast or not long enough.  Roux takes time.  I have good results with equal parts flour and fat and I like it golden brown.  If a recipe doesn't call for cold ingredients, room temp always works best.  Cold milk + cold cheese + hot pan equals bad results.  If you're using multiple cheese, work in your hardest cheese first so your soft cheese doesn't separate while your waiting for the other ones to melt.  And as with any recipe that doesn't list salt and pepper as an ingredient, season appropriately and taste as you go. Be careful with adding salt to this one though.  I agree this recipe needs a little dry mustard and you can add whatever else you want.  Maybe Garlic powder.  Sometimes I use cayenne to give it a little zip.

Big hit with the in-laws.  From the patriarch to the the toddlers. 
**I add bacon and cheese to my bread crumbs.  I just run a few peices of cooked bacon, some day old garlic bread, parmesan, and seasonings threw a chopper or food processor.  :)  ty for the recipe!

Very good and delicious, although prep time is a little longer than stated if you use low heat for roux and sauce, I prefer medium heat but stir more frequently and cuts the time in half. All in all I love this recipe and so did my guests, I just got done making it. After adding the noodles to the dish, and before baking I actually added another 1 cup of shredded sharp cheese, and 1 cup of Monterey jack cheese as a double blanket before addING breadcrumbs and it gave it an extra tangy cheesy kick. Of your a cheese lover I suggest this. Thanks for the recipe I'll use it alot.

I recently discovered that Kraft cheddar is lactose free, so I used that, Lactaid milk, margerine, and omitted the parmesan. Very good!

It turned out a little lumpy-ish. Definately would have liked it a little creamier but overall it was very good. I added a little salt and pepper. It was good but I will continue to keep searching for the perfect recipe.  The bread crumbs really made the dish....don't skip it.

I had to make a quick lunch and looked up "homemade mac and cheese".  I didn't have enough ingredients, so I had to alter the recipe.  Even with a lack of a few ingredients, it still tasted quite good; I will attempt making this meal again soon, next time with proper ingredients.

All in all, I was surprised that the meal turned out so good for a first attempt.  The meal was simple to make, quick, and quite tasty.  I especially love the "cheese sauce" (as I call it).

First time making it & this recipe came out great! with one major and one minor adjustment. Recipe calls for 3 cups of milk, I only used 1 cup of low fat milk. Then did everything else and once the sauce was mixed in with macaronis I shredded more cheese on top of it and lightly mixed it in. Recipe came out delicious! I skipped the breadcrumbs and paprika. Used 8x8 dish, fit perfectly. I definitely recommend this, easy and delicious.

Great basic recipe that you can alter to suit your own tastes by adding
more spices, different cheeses or milk, etc. Real butter is the best and
low fat cheese is another option. Who wants diet mac and cheese? ;P

I'm always grateful to those who rate a recipe how it is, prior to making adjustments. I will take some suggestions on some recipes, but always like to try it as is first. I did that the first time I made this, and although it was good, it did need "something". So, I did take the advice of others, and added on tablespoon of ground mustard, and Worcestershire. It gave it what it needed, and was very good. I used panko bread crumbs on top.

Good basic recipe, but not cheesy enough for me. I resolved the issue by doubling the cheese. I also added some minced onion to the bread crumb mixture for extra flavor.

Nice recipe! I changed it and took the advise of others. I had 2 cups whole milk, 1  cup sour cream, the cheeses stayed the same, and for spices 1 teaspoon of: paprika, onion salt, garlic powder and mild chilli powder. Also a bit of salt and pepper.  It came out really nice! It was a little red because of the amount of paprika, but delicious and would make again!

I added evaporated milk and a pinch of mustard powder as suggested, cuz it was my first and I really wanted to get it right, but it was bland... :( so creamy and beautiful, but frankly, the stuff that comes in a box is better.

A great recipe! I've tried Alton Brown's recipe (tempering the egg was tricky) and others using gruyere cheese but this is definitely going to be my go-to from now on! I added some diced vidalia onion to the butter in the first step for more flavor, added some dry mustard before adding the cheese as some others suggested and used penne pasta because it was all I had. I think the larger pasta works very well with this - absorbs more and prevents the sauce from becoming too "gluey" between the noodles. Make sure to undercook the noodles by a couple minutes and rinse in cold water so they finish in the oven and don't get mushy. The only other change I made was that I sprinkled a layer of dry panko on top and used a thin drizzle of olive oil to prevent it from getting too dry in the oven. It worked perfectly and allowed me to use just a tad less butter overall. My husband and 3 sons just gobbled it up!

Delicious indeed. Next time I will make the following changes: use homemade breadcrumbs or panko, undercook the macaroni by two minutes,  use a stronger-flavored cheese instead of Parmesan, and add some herbs. I doubled the recipe and it filled a 9x13 pan perfectly to the brim.

This is the only mac and cheese recipe that I make, it is fastly superior to any others I have tried!  Toast bread and then chop up to make the bread crumbs, then toast in butter as described for the best result!

I ended up needing a little more flour than what was called for to get the sauce to thicken to my liking. I subbed in an eyeballed amount of blue cheese instead of the half cup of the Parmesan for some extra bite. I also doubled the recipe so I could use up a full box of pasta, which filled a deep dish 9x13 pan perfectly.

Really happy with the outcome of this recipe!! As others have mentioned, don't worry about the mixture looking too runny before you put the dish in the oven -- it will come out really creamy and thick! We adjusted the recipe just a little. First, we used 2 cups of heavy cream and 1/2 cup of milk -- Creaminess turned out beautifully. In addition, we used 1 cup parmesan, 1/2 cup gouda, and 1 cup sharp white cheddar cheeses. We wanted to grate the cheese freshly and honestly just grabbed what was least expensive in the cheese cooler at the store. What made a huge difference in taste for us was adding fresh grated black pepper (to taste) and herbs de provence (maybe a teaspoon into the creamy cheese mixture on the stove? -- basil, fennel, marjoram, parsley, rosemary, lavender, tarragon, and thyme -- you can get this in the Organics brand... I promise it's worth it!!). We will for sure be making this again :)

This is an awesome recipe for someone who is just sort of starting out and while I think there should be better instructions on how to make the roux, it's an over all simple, yummy treat for an in a pinch supper idea. Now I haven't played with any of the other foodies ideas but I do like to add some herbs, salt and pepper, and a little extra butter, and some cream cheese to mine. I don't find this dish tasteless or bland I think it's so creamy and rich and mine has a lot of flavor. I think is an awesome base for some creative tinkering. ^^ (have some in the oven right now~)

It wasn't what I expected at all.  It was super soupy and the parmesan cheese never melted so it was gritty and clumpy.

This was pretty good. I made the mistake of using mild cheddar instead of sharp. Had I done that AND added more ingredients like others have said, this would been TOO good. I'll be trying again with modifications.

I followed this recipe as written with one exception: I used crumbled Ritz crackers in place of the bread crumbs.  It turned out pretty good.  The cheese was a little lumpy, so I probably needed to stir it a little longer.  Also, it needed salt to help the flavor.  Next time I'll add salt before cooking.

This was a really good basic recipe. I read some of the reviews and incorporated some tips. I added garlic powder, celery salt, paprika and white pepper. I used a can of evaporated milk. And since I was serving this with caesar salad, I thought it would be fun to make breadcrumbs out of store-bought croutons, so I skipped the step of cooking the breadcrumbs in butter. I used old cheddar cheese and provolone for the shredded cheese, and parmesan and romano for the grated cheese. 

The only thing I wasn't sure of was the very next step after the roux. I added the milk and I wasn't sure how long to cook it before adding in the cheese. I thought I was supposed to wait for bubbles to form (as I often do when roux is involved), but after maybe 8-10 minutes of cooking it on medium, I added in the cheese. I wonder if I should have added the cheese as soon as the milk got hot ... I think it might have made for a smoother sauce. But overall, this is a great recipe and I'll definitely revisit it.

I have made this a few times. Follow the recipe but I keep my heat at medium for a while after I add the milk, to make sure that it's nice and hot for when I add the cheese. I also add different spices - like Epicure's sage and apple - which gives it some really nice flavour. I always add in cubed ham as well for some protein. Bakes uncovered. So yummy!

Delicious! Great for a family meal or a single person.. if you want leftover's. It's not expensive and not hard to make. I made it the first time using the instructions exactly. This time I used a bit more than a pinch of Paprika, a 1/4th cup more shredded Sharp Cheddar cheese to make the sauce a bit thicker, it came out great! However, using the original recipe or your own touches don't worry if the sauce doesn't get think enough. Soon as it is in the oven for the first 10-15min it thickens up very nice.

This recipe is delicious! Have made this several times for family dinners, holidays, etc. and it is always requested again and again. Great base to changing it up with different cheeses and such. Have made this with pepper jack cheese and bacon, YUMMO!!!

Fantastic! I made this as part of Christmas Eve dinner. I used about a 3/4cup of cream and made up the rest with the milk.  Also, I didn't have any parmasean so I used pecorino Romano cheese.  Ditto, with what everyone said about feeling like it will be too runny but it so wasn't! It was so yummy, there weren't even any leftovers! I'll be making this again soon!

I tried this recipe yesterday. It was a side dish, (wanted my daughter to take home comfort food to her apartment with the leftovers of christmas ham).  It was a bit lacking in flavor and slightly gritty. I think completely liquifying the cheese may have been the mistake. There was far too much milk as well. Just my opinion. This definitely needs mustard or something more flavorful, possibly a better cheese mixture! Thank you for sharing it!

I made this for Christmas yesterday. I sort of used this as a guideline, since this was my first time making homemade mac n cheese. I used a lot of the tips I read in the reviews and I doubled the recipe. Instead of three cups of milk, I used one part milk, one part condensed milk and one part sour cream. I also ended up using two pounds of medium cheddar and one pound Colby cheese (In my defense, I did double the whole recipe :P). I didnt use the colby cheese for the sauce, I sprinkled it over top. For seasoning, I used a tablespoon of dry mustard and two tablespoons of worchestsire  sauce to the cheese sauce. For the topping, crushed Ritz crackers. I also used the spiral noodles instead of elbow. This was so delicious, I was very surprised it came out so yummy! Definitely saving this one in the recipe box.

It was sinful bliss as is....   :-) 

(2nd time I played with the seasonings: garlic and onion powder and powdered mustard; 1/2 tsp each was good).

Tried this recipe tonight and it was bland.  I think if I do it again, that i would reduce the milk and up the cheese.  maybe try evaporated milk as well.

Very very good! I used Pablo crumbs to get it nice and crunchy. I had Romano instead of Parm cheese and it was tasty. The most recent times I've made it I've thrown in some mustard powder and onion powder and paprika in the batch, not just I too. I may replace the Parm/Romano cheese with something more tangy next time.

Very good Mac 'n Cheese, but I will not put the bread crumbs on top again.  That was a miss.  Instead I top it with some great seasoning.  

Specifically "Kip" seasoning from Verstegen.  It's a dutch seasoning blend and I can only find it at the Dutch store. "Kip" means chicken so it's chicken seasoning and it consists of salt, coriander, paprika, pepper, ginger, mace, curcumin, celery seed, cumin, cardamom, chili, onion powder, fenugreek.  That adds a real nice tasty crust on top.

So I made a few tweaks to this, after reading many of the reviews. Changes I made: I added a dash of salt, a teaspoon of garlic powder, 1 1/2 teaspoons onion powder instead of onions, 2 or so teaspoons dijon mustard. I used a whole can of evaporated milk (1 1/2 cups), half cup sour cream, one cup milk. Added half cup ish of swiss cheese as well. Used 2 cups noodles so just over 8oz. Instead of bread crumbs (can't stand them on pasta) I baked some hickory bacon at 425 for 23 minutes, and broke it into pieces before baking the whole thing. It was PHENOMENAL! The only complaint was from the 14 year old who thought we should cut the onion and dijon a smidge next time. I will be making this again. Thanks for the base recipe!

Really good tasting and simple to make recipe! Wanted a yummy comfort food but in not much time, this was it! Sauce thickened up nicely even when made with nonfat milk. Kids devoured it! Definitely a keeper.

It was good I cut down about half a cup of milk and used 2 cans of tuna to make a tuna casserole. It's not very cheesy so I'm glad I used it for a casserole. Also added garlic and pepper.

Made this recipe as a side dish for dinner and my husband and I both thought it was good,  especially considering it was my first crack at homemade mac n cheese and I did it rather quickly.I did use 1/2-1cup extra colby jack onto what the recipe called for. I will probably substitute the Parmesan and add dry mustard powder and Worcester in the future.  I think adding the ham or chicken for a complete meal is a great idea too!

My only complaint would be that it was a little grainy, I am not sure how to fix that though, any ideas?

I would give this 4.5 stars. Very good basic recipe and the bread crumbs on top were so good when fried with a little butter. I read some of the reviews and after seeing that some thought it was a bit bland I sauteed a minced shallot and garlic clove in butter, then added the flour to make the roux. After finishing the sauce I was sure it was too much sauce for the amount of noodles, but I added it anyway and it thickened up perfectly in the oven. So delicious! With the garlic and shallot I would give it 5 stars!

Like all the other reviewers say it's easy to make and delicious. The cheese sauce will be funny when you pour it over the noodles. Don't worry! It thickens up when baking in the oven. I was super nervous when I did it. Thought for sure we would be ordering in pizza because it wasn't going to work. But it did! 

This is a great recipe and I will be using it again in the future.

It worked as a base recipe (which is what it purported to be).  A dash of salt and pepper to each serving made the basic dish perfect.  I'll try other additions in the future; it is definitively good enough to make again. :)

I've never actually made Mac and cheese outside of using Kraft and thought it was about time I tired. The only altering I did was I use crushed croutons in place of bread crumbs. (I don't eat bread)I added 2 finely sliced green chilies and a dash of chili powder. I like fire in my food but not so much fire I can't taste what I've cooked. Anyway....perfection. 30 minutes later and I have a golden brown, homemade mac and cheese. Thanks for the recipe. I only gave the recipe a 4 because I had to add salt, white pepper, chiliees and chili powder....delicious!

Pros: delicious, very saucey (which I love!) and was pretty easy to throw together. Not going to lie, seeing "roux" made me hesitant at first but after a quick Google search I felt confident. Also my husband loved it!

Cons: it came out a little gritty. I'm not sure if I messed up the roux but I did follow the directions to a T. Sadly this was way too rich for me and gave me an upset stomach.

Even though I won't be making this again it was still very good, but be careful if you have a sensitive stomach.

It was just ok! From reading the past reviews I think next time I'll try the evaporated milk instead of regular milk. I used Cabot Vermont Sharp Cheddar cheese and it all separated so I'll try that to see if that helps.  Instead of half a box of elbow noodles (8oz) I used the whole box (16oz)..
 Your choice in bread crumbs also will depend on the flavor.  I used the Pepperidge Farm Italian bread crumbs (the blue bag) and it was the best part!! Yum! Adding a bit more cheese too might help! Needs some tweaking, but not an awful dish!

I love this recipe. First time I made it, I followed the recipe as is, however, several variations later I've found a couple great changes. I substitute a cup of milk for 1 cup of heavy whipping cream. I also add a pinch of ancho chili to the mix. Lastly, I used Italian seasoning bread crumbs and just sprinkled it on top before baking.

Utterly decadent :)  I used real butter with this recipe. I did not alter the ingredients in any way. The sauce is a bit runny when you initially pour it on, but after baking it is thick. I loved it. Plugged it on both my Facebook accounts too!

I used the crumbs from the cornbread I made the other night, and doubled the amount of breadcrumbs.  Dish turned out perfectly; the whole family raved about it!  Even our incredibly picky eleven-year-old loved it.  Definitely making this again.

Well I got tired of eating and making the boxed mac n cheese for my six year old son, so I found this recipe it's really good! Except my Safeway was out of Parmasian cheese so I had to use something else so I chose a mixed cheese called "Italian Five Cheese" it's a mix of cheeses including Parmasian it gave it a good left over taste in your mouth and I used the tip of putting a bunch of garlic salt, black pepper, onion salt, and salt in it which made it taste really good, my son gave me a comment of "Mmmmm mom your better than the box guys at making mac n cheese, can I have more?" lol Thank u for the sharing of this recipe it made me a supper mom! :)

I have never made Mac n cheese this way before. It was a new style altogether. I made it for my  husband tonight and crossed my fingers....he loved it! I liked it.  Would I make it again? Yes! The topping was tasty. I used sharp cheddar and  asiago cheese. It was what I had. Pretty tasty.  Next time I will try Parmesan I am sure to like that even better.

Yummy yummy yum yum! Nice and creamy!  Cheese is a great consistency and bread crumbs add a nice crunch. I'm an experimenter so I May add salt to next batch and top with bacon bits...

This is a very basic, sort of bland, mac and cheese recipe. I would definitely dress it up a bit more next time: add a little salt, ham, a wider variety of cheeses, peas, and some corn kernels.The sauce was delightfully creamy, especially since I used 1 1/2 cups of whipping cream and 1 1/2 cups of whole milk.

It was awesome, easy to make! I revised Mac pasta to whole wheat penne and turned out great.  Bear in mind our family including myself hate whole wheat pasta due to its texture but this recipe somehow took that texture away!  Love it!

This turned out pretty well. Our family is g-free so I substituted g-free pasta shells. 

It was a little bland for my liking. I thinking of using pepper jack cheese next time instead of the Parmesan. 

Overall, my husband and I liked it! 6 year old wouldn't eat it, but that's okay, more for us.

I followed this recipe exactly as the directions read. My husband & I were not impressed. The bread crumbs made the texture very  unpleasant. I saw someone added Ritz crackers. That would have been better.  We scraped as much of the crumbs off as possible so we can eat it tomorrow. Will not be making this exact recipe again.

The recipe was really east to understand, and clean up was a breeze. This recipe is awesome for kids who don't want anything crazy, and for the frazzled moms who don't want to wash a million pots and pans and add a ton of ingredients. Thanks!

I think this recipe is great!  I replaced the Parmesan cheese with Pecorino Romano cheese. And for the bread crumbs used Kellogg's corn flake crumbs. Was delicious.  A huge hit and very easy to make.

Made this for dinner tonight - tried a different recipe about a week ago which was so not what we wanted. This is the creamy Mac 'n cheese that our taste buds craved. I did season it as several suggested, garlic and onion powder, fresh black pepper, dried mustard and some Siracha. Added just a little zing and really stepped up the overall flavour.  Mixed the panko with the melted butter and sprinkled on top to let it brown as someone else suggested. Used 3 cups of 1% milk, no need for condensed and sour cream - be patient with the roux and your sauce will be perfect. Used about 3 cups cheese total, some store old cheddar, (cheese shop) real 5 yr old cheddar and fresh parm. A keeper for sure - this will be my go to from now on. Thanks!

I had a blast making homemade macaroni for the first time!!! The ingredients was fun and instructions was right on point. The dish turned out creamy, cheesy, and simply amazingly tasty. I will definitely be making this dish for macaroni every time. Thanks for posting recipe.

I love this recipe and making it my own!  I usually cut the milk - mostly because I don't have that much milk left (but I'm currently making it with the full amount.  The first time I made it, I didn't have any breadcrumbs - and it still tasted amazing (my Dad even said it was "REALLY yummy").  And this time, I've put some extra cheese on top before baking it, as well as subbing in some gouda, jack, and edam cheese (it tasted amazing last time!).  I keep coming back to this recipe every time I want mac and cheese - which seems to be weekly!  Love it!

The cheese I normally use for my mac and cheese is no longer available so I'm trying out new recipes.  My husband made this recipe tonight.  He did overcook the noodles (I recommend under cooking them before they go in the oven because they soak up the cheese sauce) but we both felt there was very little flavor.  It did taste rich, but as for actual flavor, the main thing we tasted were the toasted bread crumbs.  We followed the recipe to the letter and didn't do any substitutions.  It was saucy, which is good, but very bland.

Honestly this is a great base recipe for mac-n-cheese but it is very bland and needs some sort of seasonings - it has plenty of cheese and the texture is fine but it really needs salt and something else (just not sure what that something else is)

I love this recipe! I use coconut oil instead of butter, and even then I use just 3 tablespoons of coconut oil then the 1/4 cup they call for butter. And I also use unsweetened original flavored almond milk instead of "real" milk. And I honestly don't think you need 2 1/2 cups of cheese, but it's all about personal preference, I'm sure some people use even more, but I usually use about a 1 1/2 cups. The only reason I alter anything about this recipe is to help me feel a little better about eating something that's not so calorie friendly.

I was not a big fan on the taste.  I don't know if it was because I used mild cheddar instead of sharp or if I messed up the roux or if it just isn't a great recipe.  One think to note is that the sauce is not only really thin, but a LOT!  I saved some back because it seemed like WAY too much and it was really dry when I checked it... I added the rest of it along with some cheese on top but I still was not a fan.

I've just made this. I added paprika garlic and black pepper to the milk mix. The reason I gave it a 3 star is because it tasted really chalky.it  Was kinda creamy. Must be the parmesan cheese. I used the regular store bought in a plastic cylinder container kind. I didn't freshly grate. I will be making this again but I will probably use mozzarella cheese instead of parmasean

This was an easy recipe to make, but... I will leave off the bread crumbs and paprika if I ever make it again.  All of us agreed on that.  My husband thought it should be creamier.  I thought it should be cheesier, and my son said it was similar to Stouffers, which isn't a bad thing, but I would like it to stand out a little, so I will try some other recipes.

Love this recipe however we use ritz or townhouse crackers instead of bread.  Some times we added bacon and slices of thinly sliced tomatoes on top.  Always have Franks hot sauce to serve with it just to heat things up a bit!  Family favorite!!

I added spices and cut the milk. Which still ended up making the sauce too thin for my liking. So I added more flour and butter and cheese. I made it my own and made it awesome.

A very good mac and cheese recipe with ingredients I usually have on hand.  I liked that this started with making a roux for the sauce.  I think that helped make it very creamy.  The leftovers of this reheated very nicely with separating.

I loved this Mac and cheese. But I was a little confused by the 1/4 cup butter and 2-1/2 T. Flour called for in the recipe. Then later in the instructions, we were told to "stir in enough flour to make a roux."  Please be advised that flour and butter should be in equal proportions for a roux:  2 T. Butter to 2 T. Flour.  Besides that little problem, this was amazingly tasty!!!  I loved the buttery bread crumbs on top.

I made this recipe for some of my friends in college. I figured I'd give them all a nice home cooked meal, as everyone was getting homesick. Made this for about half of the floor, and everyone LOVED it. It was all gone in about 30 minutes tops, and everyone went for seconds or thirds. Definitely a huge hit, and will have to make it again.

The first time I made this it came out perfectly!! Since then, though, I find that the consistency is off.  The sauce is lumpy.  Has anyone else had this issue?  Would brand/type of milk make a difference?  I used whole milk the first time, and 2% these last two times.

Very good, I used Romano cheese and added a little ground mustard and turned out great.

I just made this for the first time for my kids.  They love it.  I used less milk because they aren't much for saucy mac n cheese.  Quick and easy, thank you!

In my never-ending search for the perfect mac 'n cheese, decided to give this one a try. Hubby's verdict: ditch the breadcrumbs, add a little more cheese, and call it good. I totally forgot the Parmesan cheese (oops!) so will definitely include that next time! I also added a little shredded provolone but couldn't really taste it so will stick to sharp cheddar (and Parmesan) next time.

Had it for breakfast today. Added quite an amount of pepper cos we Africans love pepper. It's the first time I'll have mac and cheese not out of a box so I guess I preferred it.

My husband really does not care for mac & cheese, but really liked this version. I need to figure out how to make it a bit "soupier" but it was very tasty.

At first bite, I liked it but as I continued eating it got bland.  I think less milk and more cheese is the key.  Paprika is a nice touch on top though.

Great recipe.  If you want it a bit richer, you can use half and half which makes it creamier (although it will bring up the fat/cals). I also like to use different cheeses (Monterey Jack, Colby, etc), which will give varying tastes.  Overall, a great recipe!

Super easy and very good. Creamy and delicious. My 7 year old grandson loved it and so did we! I used Romano cheese instead of Parmesan because that is all I had. Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly. Will definitely make again.

The recipe is beautiful, although it is high fat, the amount of calcium in it does actually assist so you're body doesn't absorb it (looking around 60% of the fat make up) ;p [diet tip for those health conscious of us] I do however say a dash of mustard powder and little evap milk make this dish utterly yummy!

i'm giving this 3 stars because this recipe is really only a base for you to give you an idea of what goes into macaroni and cheese - you'll definitely have to doctor it up / get creative with it to get the macaroni you want. 



i used 2 cups of milk instead of 3, and the sauce came out perfectly thick and creamy after baking in the oven. i also added 1 tbsp garlic powder, and some fresh cracked pepper and salt. i also used 3 different kinds of cheeses just because that's what i had in my kitchen: 1 cup colby/jack, 1/2 cup swiss, and 1/2 cup cheddar plus the 1/2 cup parmesan the recipe calls for. like other reviewers said using fresh grated parmesan instead of the pre-grated kraft kind might make it a little less grainy but overall i didn't think it was too bad. I didn't have trouble with graininess; the key is making the roux properly. i lived in louisiana for awhile - the trick is low heat and CONSTANTLY stirring with a whisk. you really want to get the flour all mixed in, so i added the flour slowly, alternating with milk when i made my recipe. and the longer you cook, the better. 



my macaroni wasn't bland, but i did use different cheeses and added a few spices. i also forwent the bread crumbs and just did more shredded cheese on top. it's delicious!

The ingredient list might not be correct. Three cups of milk turned out to be too much liquid for a roux of 2 tbl. butter and 2.5 tbl. of flour. Two cups would have been better. I had to add more flour later to thicken the sauce enough to melt the cheese. Perhaps there is a typo.

Not a good taste or consistancy.  We used Italian Bread crumbs.  Maybe that was it?  We prefer the velveeta recipe.

I made this macaroni and cheese dish for Christmas dinner today.  I did not have milk, but I always keep powdered buttermilk mix in my fridge and use it any time I am out of milk.  (Well I have Vanilla Soy Milk, but it would've ruined this recipe) I used cheese ends from a package from Big Y (makes yummy mac n cheese w/ different surprise cheeses).  It is delicious!  I also added some chopped onion and dried thyme leaves for color and extra subtle taste.  I'll be making this dish more often....it's very easy and worth the effort it takes to make it from scratch.

1 cup milk and 2 cups evaporated milk works fine.  I may go 0.5 and 2.5 next time and put fried onions on top.  Thanks for a great recipe.

I made this recently and it was a great success. Everyone raved about it. I found that the sauce seemed really watery at first like others have said but the longer it cooks the thicker it gets. I thought it was the perfect consistency for mac and cheese and held to the noodles well. I used rotini noodles as I did not have elbow macaroni available. This is such an easy recipe to make and tastes great.

I love this recipe.... and it gets 5 stars because I know to add about 2" chunk of Velveeta Cheese cut into small pieces and added to the cheese sauce.  This makes the cheese sauce nice and creamy!!!  Thank you for a great recipe.  It was loved this Thanksgiving.

The best mac n cheese I have ever had!!! Everyone loved it on Thanksgiving. The only  change I made was I did sharp and mild cheddar with the parmesan cheese and adjusted the recipe for 6 servings in a 9x13 dish.

Simple but yummy Mac and cheese. Only thing I might change next time is I might not use butter in the bread crumbs as mine turned out a little too "oily". Thought if I omit butter and just sprinkle bread crumbs on top, that might help.

This recipe was just ok, it was very bland.  I will use this recipe again as a base but will defiantly add some other flavors.

Did not like, nor did any other person who tried.  Wouldn't make again.  The sauce tasted pretty good prior to adding macaroni but the final product was bland and tasteless.

Made this last night for the first time.  I've never actually had homemade mac and cheese, and neither have my kids, so I don't have anything to compare to.  But all I can rate about this is my own end result.  I added 1 tsp of onion, garlic powders to the sauce mix and sprinkled the topping with paprika, as others suggested. Didn't have any dry mustard. I also upped the serving amount, as we are a family of 6, making it in a 9x13 pan with 6 cups dry pasta, same amount of milk, and 3 cups of cheese.  Also used half evaporated milk and adjusted the butter/flour mix because there was more pasta.  Used fusilli pasta as well.  My biggest problem with this dish is the cheese "sauce".  The texture of it was terrible, not smooth or creamy at all.  I don't know if this had anything to do with my adjustments (it very well could have).  But I was expecting a silkier texture. It looked flawless while it was cooking in the pot, no lumps or pieces. Also, without the spices I added, this dish would be virtually tasteless. It even seemed to need salt, even after ALL that cheese in there.  Definitely a good base recipe, but needs some perking up.  Follow the advice of others and add things to it to get it just right.

I made this as written and I thought it was good with a chance to be 5 stars with modifications that others have suggested. I did not have a problem with it not thickening up, it came out perfect. I would suggest using freshly grated parmesan since I found it grainy tasting using the Kraft grated parmesan in a jar. This does need some more seasonings thrown in too. Perfect recipe to doctor up to your own personal tastes.

This is a good basic recipe.  I saute some onion in the butter, and add the milk, and a little "gravy" flour to thicken, then add the 8 oz sharp cheese, that melts into the milk and onion.  Sometimes I grate different kinds of cheeses and add.  I tried using the Parmesan, no one was too crazy about that. I also add more cheese on top before I bake, and bread crumbs.  My family pretty much devours it.

For this recipe I broke my cardinal rule of making the recipe, as written the first time.  I took some of the other reviewers suggestions and added a tin of evaporated milk, using whole milk to make up the rest of the 3 cups.  I also added some garlic powder and dry mustard to the sauce, topping the mac n' cheese with smoked paprika and Ritz crackers, mixed with melted butter.  Crazy good.  Could've used a little more salt to bring out the flavours but it was well received by everyone and my wife even had "thirds".  Will make again, but only for special occasions.  This recipe could be deadly if eaten on a regular basis ha, ha.

I like the base. Next time I will heat the milk before adding it. I also think I would like it with more cheese. I WILL try this again as I did like it.

Great recipe-I did cut the butter in half.  It was a bit "soupier" than I prefer, so I added  a few more noodles the next time.  I always use whole wheat noodles.  I loved the tang of the parmesan,  I used up a couple small bits of assorted cheeses in the frig (jarlsberg & something else) in addition to the cheddar, which was delicious.  My last addition was one and a half teaspoons of smoked paprika.  I usually add some to cheese or egg dishes.    If you've not used it before, start out with one teaspoon to four servings then you can increase to taste.  One last variation the second time was using minced jalapenos, last of the season.  The milk cuts the heat.

Excellent recipe.  I almost decided to not do the bread crumb topping.  Glad I did this extra step!  Nice crunchy addition.  Think next time I won't make a roux but just put the cheese into the heated milk and pour on the macaroni.  It was a tad dry.  Some of the comments made me laugh.  Of course it's full of fat, duh!  Not sure about all the additions folks made........but, to each his/her own, eh!  The Winter Salad with Lemon Poppy Seed dressing, and Copper Pennies recipes from this site make a wonderful meal (lots of veggies to offset some of that fat)!!

This is my standby recipe for mac and cheese and it is awesome.  Today I added some sauteed onions, peppers, and sausage, and a little spicy mustard and used half provolone and half mozzarella cheese to make a sausage and peppers inspired mac and cheese.  I'm going to add garlic, parsley, and a little parmesan to the bread crumbs to make the crust like garlic bread.

I add 1/2 cup of sour cream and 1/2 tsp. dry mustard to my Mac n Cheese. Other than that, this recipe is the closest to mine that I've seen. You can't forget the dry mustard, even if you don't have the sour cream, I would have given this 5 stars if it would have had dry mustard as an ingredient.

I loved it, my kids loved it!  Followed the same outline above except I added a couple things

12 ounces uncooked elbow macaroni
2.5 cups shredded sharp Cheddar cheese
3/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese
3 cups milk
onion powder
dry mustard
paprika
salt
white pepper
2 1/2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
2 tablespoons butter
3/4 cup Italian style bread crumbs
paprika

i mixed onion, paprika, salt, pepper in with the cheese sauce, it wasn't as runny as i thought it would be either(reading other reviews).  Overall I loved it, my kids loved it too!

Incredible. Yes its a high calorie dish, its pasta and cheese! I used smaller portions and had a nice side of a half a plate of steamed broccoli and asparagus to give it a healthy kick!

This is a great basic mac and cheese recipe to have. It is easily tweaked. (I added sour cream, cheddar and mozzarella, dry mustard and some other seasonings.) I am from Louisiana and I am no stranger to making a roux, but it did give the dish a grainy, floury taste. Overall it was good, but could definitely be creamier. I'll see what else I can do next time.

I had very high hopes for this recipe when I started it, esp because of all the good ratings. But I'm sorry to admit that the high didn't last. My family and myself all agreed that it was very bland and had no cheese "taste". I followed the recipe exactly to detail and was very disappointed. Suffice to say, we won't be having this again in our house.

First of all there is something wrong with the ratio's here!!! 8 ounces of pasta/ one cup?? It doesn't make sense! I wanted to double the recipe so logically I doubled the pasta AND everything else and I ended up with enough cheese sauce to make it twice!! Wayyyy too much!! I didn't even use all the milk it asks for, that's a crazy amount and dilutes the taste of the cheese. 
All in all the idea of this recipe is ok, but you have to modify it so much that you're not really making this recipe anymore. It needs more flavor... I added cheese wiz, garlic & onion power and Worcestershire sauce based on the suggestions of other reviews.
Less milk & more flavour required.

Delicious.  This was better than I thought it would be and I even used cheap cheese.  I added a dash of dry mustard at the cheese melting stage, as well as salt and pepper.  Also, I didn't feel like dirtying another pan with the breadcrumbs, so I melted the butter in the microwave, mixed them with the breadcrumbs, sprinkled it on the noodles, then put the pan under the broiler for about 30 seconds after baking.  My entire family loved it.

this is a decent basic recipe if you're just looking for approximately how much of the base ingredients you need. if you're looking for a step by step guide of how to make the perfect mac n cheese with no personal creative input, this is not the recipe for you. i made major changes to mine to suit my family's preferences. if you're having issues with the thickness of the sauce you either didn't make enough roux, or the roux isn't cooked thoroughly enough. getting down the roux will make the difference. i don't think the roux ratio for this recipe is enough.

This was great but do substitute some of the milk for evaporated milk. I did half evaporated milk and half whole milk. I also sprinkle some cheddar cheese on top before adding the bread crumbs. This was great will be making it again for Thanksgiving dinner for work.

I made this last night and it was great! For the cheeses, I used up all of the little bits of cheese I had in the fridge; cheddar, Mexican 3 cheese blend, Monterrey jack, etc. I used fat free milk, too. The sauce was very thin, but as others have already said, it gets nice and creamy and thick in the oven. I skipped the breadcrumbs, but I did add some garlic powder and herbs-de-provence, which really made it taste great!

I made this for dinner tonight and it was good. I followed the recipe except I added onion powder, garlic powder, salt and pepper.(I noticed the recipe didn't call for any spices) and I'm so glad I added them because wow it would have been bland. It's a great recipe just add seasonings to your liking. I will make again thanks for recipe Judy.

Awesome recipe with mild flavor. i prefer like a lot of pepper or tabasco sauce on it just because I'm like that.  its awesome except DO NOT  add grated parmesan cheese!!!! Someone had already mentioned the texture becomes weird because the parmesan cheese does not  melt, didnt listen and it didnt turn out as good. bleeeeh! listen to me DONT.

I was really anticipating this dish and it was just OK.  It was bland and not as flavorful as I had hoped.  I would definitely add additional spices.  I typically follow a first time recipe to a tee but wish I had spiced it up a bit.  The Italian breadcrumbs were really good on top.

This recipe was delicious! I was scared of the thin sauce but once it was in the over, it thickened up. The texture is great! Heres some changes I would make to this recipe. It was a little more bland, so here are some suggestions. Add a little more salt or add some of your favorite seasonings. You can also make this mac and cheese with kielbasa.

I can rate this recipe only four. I'm not a mac and cheese guru, cause we just don't cook it where I live. So it's a first mac and cheese that I've made. But I can judge that without all those alternations and additions I've made this dish would be really bland. Firstly, I've used not only milk but also sour cream. Somewhere about 3/4 of milk and 1/4 of sour cream. The recipe omit salt but don't forget it to put, the roux is tasteless without it. Also I put 1 tsp of mustard powder and black pepper. I'm not going to try to a tee all these recipes of mac and cheese here, they are quite similar. All you can do is just to vary the amount (2-3 cups)and types of cheeses (cheddar, monterey jack, parmesan, swiss cheese, cottage cheese, mozzarela, muenster, etc.) Mix different liquids and sauces such as milk, cream, sour cream, evaporated milk, mayonnaise. Experiment with spices: salt, mustard powder, black pepper, cayenne, paprika, thyme, karri, herbes de provence will work.

This is a GREAT basic Mac and cheese recipe that can be spiced up to your own tastes.  I read a lot of the reviews after making this 4 times to find some hints for spicing it up a little.  Having traveled the US selling Napa wines, eating lots of delicious cheeses, I believe that if people find the recipe isn't cheesy enough, they simply need to try a different cheese. For instance, sharp cheddar has a distinct flavor different from medium cheddar. In our case, we don't have access to great cheeses unless we want to pay $37 for 4.5 lbs of imported cheddar from New Zealand.  Even with the "cheap" stuff from Kenya this recipe tastes great, so anyone living in the US with access to a great selection of cheeses, I really encourage you to try another one.  I don't think it's the recipe, it's probably the cheese.  On another note the sauce really thickens only AFTER adding the cheese.  We leave off the bread crumbs as I don't want the extra work and calories. Our family of 4 can nearly finish this in one meal without any other sides...delicious.

Kids & I loved it! I did make a few minor changes. Cooked 16 oz of macaroni in salted water until al dente. Increased cheddar cheese to 3 cups packed. Increased flour to 3 tablespoons. Used Italian-style bread crumbs. And sprinkled paprika generously. Bake in 9x11 pan for 25 minutes. Yum!

Fantastic thought prior to baking it would be runny but the sauce thickened right up! I used a smaller square casserole dish than what was suggested. Just left some if the sauce out to avoid an overflow as it baked up. I would suggest putting a drip pan underneath if you decide to try it.

I thought it was pretty good, but my husband wasn't a fan. It was kind of bland/not cheesy enough for us. I did like the consistency. Overall, maybe a good base recipe but seems like a lot of people make a lot of changes to get it how they want it.

I was skeptical making this the whole way through. I thought there weren't enough noodles, sauce was too runny. But I followed directions exactly, did need to add some extra seasoning to cheese sauce for my liking, and I needed a bit more flour for my rouix. But the end result was delicious!

It tasted pasty and flourish. Nowhere near cheesy. There was also butter at the bottom of my bowl when I was done eating it. May have to modify recipe to be more cheesy.

The bread crumbs were different, but a nice addition. The only "complaint" was it wasn't cheesy enough for anyone. Will make again and add more cheese.

Family loved it. The sauce seems a little runny at first but is absorbed into the pasta when baked. I used small shell pasta and it held on to some of that yummy runny cheesey goodness.

My gypsy lass & I found this to be dry when the recipe was followed. However the flavor was there. We'll try to resurrect it by hydrating with milk & half and half. There are way too many mac/cheese recipes out there to risk trying this one again, even if the outcome was somehow our fault.

My husband ate all that I made (he eats anything though) but I wasn't too fond of it. The macaroni seemed to be mushy after I got it out of the oven and it wasn't cheesy enough for my liking. Thanks for the recipe though. It was fun to try.

I was not that impressed with this recipe - thought it was bland.  Also, I think the noodle to sauce ratio was off.  It needs more noodles.

This was a very good recipe.  I made a few changes to suit our lifestyle, but the "base" was superb!  I made this with all natural whole grain elbow macaroni, and I added salt to the water for cooking.  Next time, I will shave 2 minutes off of the macaroni cook time as the sauce softens the pasta up a fair amount.  I used a fine whole wheat flour (intended for bread and pastry), unsalted butter, plain almond milk, and medium cheddar (which is the cheese I had).  Unfortunately, all we had was some (powdery) Parmesan cheese leftover from before we started 90/10 Nutrition.  The flavor of the sauce with the Parmesan was wonderful, but the texture was very unpleasant.  Next time, I will use freshly grated Parmesan.  The sauce was a tad bland, so I added just a dash of garlic powder (and will use fresh puree next time), a good sprinkle of salt, 1/2 tsp. of ground mustard, and several cranks from my pepper mill.  It really was delicious, and I'm certain that next time we make it my family will be even more pleased than they were today!

This recipe was very good. I doubled the servings for a family dinner, and it was fabulous. The only thing I didnt like was the amount of sauce we had left over. When you make this recipe, I suggest not using all the milk. Maybe use 2/3 of the items you use to make the roux.

A very good, basic Mac 'n cheese recipe.
This is a must make for any beginning cook who wants to learn about sauces, in this case cheese. Make sure you taste-test the sauce and adjust salt as you go.  It is very forgiving, so it's hard to goof up unless you forget something or over-cook it.

This was a huge hit at our fish fry.  I read several reviews and the only thing I changed was I added a few shakes of dry mustard, onion salt and pepper to my sauce to add more flavor.

My family (Hubby, daughter and grandsons)loved it...although my hubby or daughter didn't care for the bread crumb topping. I on the other hand thought it was great!! Very easy to make and like others have stated, if you think it's too watery before putting it into the oven, it does absorb into the macaroni. I would definitely make this again!!

Awesome is the only word I need to use.  I cut back on parmesean cheese and its not so rich. I somethimes and add more shredded chedder or other cheese.  Try with different pastas.  Penne is the best cause the cheese sits in the sides. Also note that the recipe calls for 8oz of pasta and most boxes are 1lb. I cut back on the amount of sauce so its a little thicker. This is the only mac and cheese I make anymore.

Tried this just today. Used garlic butter instead of plain butter, makes it interesting that's for sure. Didn't put the bread crumbs on top, just more shredded cheese and paprika. Love the aroma coming from the dish! May try it with some browned ground beef next time.

Baked this as a college student while studying abroad and it was really easy and such basic ingredients for us college kids. It tasted delicious! Also instead of using bread crumbs I used crunched up corn flakes. It definitely fills you up and it's great to keep the leftovers!

Made this for a girl guide troop on a camping trip. They all loved it and asked for the recipe. We used 2 1/4 cups of noodles and made it in muffin tins. Don't worry- the sauce is supposed to start thin

This was fantastic. Did it for Easter dinner and doubled the recipe. There was not a bit left. I did switch out the parm cheese for asiago and it was fantastic. That was the only change I made. I followed the directions exactly with no issues. It made everyone extremely happy, just like a good Mac & Cheese is supposed to.

I burned the stove so that there are giant brown rings around the burners. The floor's sawdust-ed in cheese shavings and flour. Nearly all of the milk and cheese in the house is gone. There is a giant bowl of half-congealed noodles bulging out of the fridge. 
So saying, I would strongly recommend the use of only two cups or so--at the most--of milk. At least, I assume that's where I went wrong. I had to try and empty some of the milk from my saucepan. Thank goodness I had accidentally grated up an ungodly amount of extra cheddar cheese. This action may or may not have caused the darker splotches on my stove, but then, that could have been the plastic strainer that melted all over the upper burner. 
This did taste really good, but the sauce wasn't very thick because I was a dumba** and added all of that cheese, forgot the extra butter, did not actually bake the dish, and may or may not have overdone the noodles. 
I am going to rate this three stars, crawl under my bed, and never come out again.

I made this recipe to serve 14 people. 
I had to change the recipe a little bit--but it turned out so well that I had to give this recipe 5 stars.  
I only had 6 cups of milk for the 10 1/2 it called for 
instead of 7 cups cheddar: I used 4 c cheddar, and, 8oz of the 2% or low fat Velveeta, cut into small squares.
Instead of 1 1/2 c Parmesan I used 1 cup Parmesan and Romano mix.
I loved this recipe and so did everyone at our family gathering.
Thank you for the recipe Judy! :)

I made this dish with my boyfriend last night, and while he liked it, I couldn't get over the amount of breadcrumbs! I felt like I was eating sawdust- maybe this was because I didn't really understand the instructions, and I don't cook very often. But I felt gipped! There are two separate "butter" ingredients and I didn't even know which "butter" was needed for which part of the recipe. Anyways, edible, sure, but not something I'll ever make again!

I do a lot of cooking, but try to avoid making really carb-heavy dishes.  I rarely eat mac and cheese, but found myself with a strong craving the other night and decided to give this a shot.  This was my first time making mac & cheese from scratch and I am willing to admit that maybe I'm missing something here, but I honestly thought the sauce was too runny, it had a gritty texture I didn't care for (maybe from the flour or dried parm?), and after cooking it in the oven for a half hour my noodles were a lot mushier than I like.  The flavor was Delicious however, especially with just a pinch of garlic salt added to my bowl.  I compared this recipe to many others online and they all seem to be similar so maybe this is just what homemade mac & cheese is supposed to be like?  But I was really hoping for a drier, smoother sauce.  I might try it again sometime, reduce the liquids, and double the amount of noodles.  there are also a number of suggestions other people have mentioned that might give me more of what I was hoping for.

A family favourite!! I add a bit of cayenne into the breadcrumbs and a bit of S & P and it gets gobbled down right away. Also it's so easy to make that I can even do it in the morning before school and then the kids get a really nice hot lunch!

I was looking for a quick homemade mac/cheese recipe and found it with my favorite cheeses. I used fat-free milk and no bread crumbs (none in the house) and it still turned out wonderful! Also, thanks for the review about the sauce being thin...I was ready to panic until I read the review. Can't wait to make it again.

Delicious!  I add garlic salt and freshly ground pepper to the sauce for added flavor.  Also, I used crushed croutons on top instead of toasted bread crumbs.  Whenever I think of it ahead, I save a few strips of bacon from breakfast, crush them, and sprinkle them on top (before the croutons) for an added hint of bacon.  So yummy!! Strongly recommend :)

Made a single serving in a ramekin and it turned out great.  A couple of things...I forgot the Parmesan but sauce was still good, cooked it for 20 mins and put the broiler on for 1 min at the end.  Really yummy!

I will never even try to make this again. As I was making this, the steps were difficult. I dont like waiting forever for cheese to melt. 8 oz is too little noodles. It was just not coming together right. Never again.

I love Mac and Cheese.. I have tried just about every recipe I added white meat chicken, .. swiss cheese,and sharp chedder, (shredded) celery, onion, garlic, used alfredo sauce, not milk. and then.. IT WAS AWESOME, did bread crumbs on the top, with sliced tomato.. on the very top later.. NOW THAT IS MAC AND CHEESE, and its a guy food, you know.. A MEAL.. BUT THIS IS A GOOD BASE!

I love this mac & cheese recipe. It has just the right amount of cheese sauce. I love that bread crumbs(panko is the best) are use to add that crunchy texture at the top without having burnt cheese.

This recipe as written was almost 5 star worthy. The way I made it was perfect. The only change I made was I used Italian seasoned bread crumbs and also sprinkled a bit extra seasonings like basil and pepper on top. This was a quick and easy home made mac 'n cheese any beginner can whip up. And don't be afraid to add some ham cubes to the mix...yum.

Awesome awesome awesome!  In liu of breadcrumbs, I used crushed, seasoned croutons. For my taste, I would add a hint of salt. Other than that, it's a wonderful dish. Thanks for this recipe!

not impressed, the sauce was way too runny and looked a bit like cottage cheese. Very bland. I will not be making this again.

Used 2 cups milk instead of 3, added shrimp and some sriracha for an extra kick (buffalo sauce would work too), then sprinkled garlic powder on top of the bread crumbs before baking.... So good!!

I was a little disappointed, It was really creamy, however, I thought there was a little to much graininess due to the flour. I can never find out how to get rid of the grainy texture....other than that, the flavor was good.

I followed the recipe exactly. Except I omitted the topping. I used crushed up Ritz crackers instead. And I doubled it to feed our large family. This was delicious! I will be making it again.

Everyone loved it!  I read the reviews first and substituted for the milk - 1 cup skim milk, 1 cup half and half, 1 cup sour cream.  Also used a sleeve of Ritz crackers instead of bread crumbs (doubled recipe), and two shredded bricks of sharp cheddar (white and regular).  It was a huge hit - this will be a family favorite!

I recommend baking it longer if you, like me, like a nice cheesy crust.  Both times I've made this (this year and last year's office Christmas parties, at different offices), I have used other cheeses and gotten very good reviews.  I recommend: 1 cup sharp cheddar, 1/2 cup white cheddar, 3/4 cup milk cheddar, 1/4 cup mozzarella and 1/4 cup parmesan.  That's a bit more cheese than the recipe says, but experiment with other delicious cheeses.

I've made this twice now. The first time as it was written here, the second time with some tweaking. As written, this deserves 3 stars, good basic recipe, but a little bland, and not creamy enough for my taste. The second time, it's a 5 star recipe for sure. My changes: Used medium-sized sea shell pasta instead of elbow macaroni. Used 1 12 oz can of fat-free evaporated milk, 1/2 cup whole milk, and 1 cup of 1% milk. Had 1 lb processed American cheese cubes left over from another recipe, so I used those, plus 1 cup of sharp cheddar cheese. Didn't use the parmesan. Added 1/2 tsp onion powder, 1/2 tsp garlic powder, 1 tsp ground mustard, and a couple generous shakes of white pepper. Didn't sautee the bread crumbs before sprinkling them on top, because I figured there was already enough butter in this recipe. Sprinkled a handful of grated cheddar cheese over the top of the bread crumbs. Increased baking temp to 375 degrees, and baked for an additional 5 minutes to make sure the top got a little browned. With these changes it was excellent!

AMAZING recipe! Very easy to make and simply delicious! I did make a few minor changes - Rather than using the full 3 cups milk for the cheese sauce, I used about 1-1 1/2 cups instead, and substituted the remaining with Campbell's condensed cream of mushroom soup. I also added a little garlic powder to the melted butter while browning the breadcrumbs and omitted the paprika. The garlic adds a nice finishing touch to this incredible entree!

I've made this recipe twice now since finding it.  The first time was really good, but the second time was even better.  I Layered ground turkey cooked with McCormick Taco seasoning under the Pasta which I mixed with the sauce before adding it to the casserole.  Topped it off with some sour cream and it disappeared off of the plate!

It wasn't bad, but it was just kind of plain.  Next time I think I'll add some cooked onions and maybe some jalapenos to liven it up a bit.

I couldn't wait to make this recipe after stumbling across it; however, it didn't blow my socks off. My husband hated the breadcrumbs. I didn't mind them, but probably could have done with less than 1/2 cup. My cheese mixture was a little thin when pouring onto the noodles but it did thicken up during baking. That being said though, the end result wasn't as cheesy as we had expected (I did use two cups skim milk and one cup 2% milk, so this might be why.) I also put in 1 cup peas (I put them in frozen during the last minute of boiling the noodles.) Finally, it was a little bland tasting. It needs something else for a little more flavor. It was an easy recipe and worth a try, but I won't necessarily make it again.

I used this as a base recipe hence the 4 stars. After making it the 1st time, I revised it after tasting it. Now I only use 1 cup of milk, and I add a can of green diced chili for some spice. My hubby absolutely loves it! Tastes yummy reheated as well. Sometimes I will vary the kind of noodles I use just to give it some different texture! lol.

Excellent recipe and we will definitely be making it again!  It was not lacking in flavor and makes for a great side dish.

This sounds good except for having onion in it.  I wasn't raised with onion being in this dish so I would omit that.  Everything else is like my mom made it. Not fond of the onion taste at all.  Without the onion I would vote high on this one.

I made this for the first time tonight but substituted 1 can of Campbell's Creamy Nacho Soup for one cup of milk (I doubled the recipe first). What a tasty thing! The dish came out great! All the folks before me that mentioned that the sauce was runny to begin with but sets up is correct. I thought the same thing but did not have an issue with it.

This mac and cheese came out way too milky for me, I don't know if anyone else's came out that way. I followed the recipe but it just tasted too much like milk. It also tasted like it was missing something, but I don't know what. It was ok, but I was just not a fan, I was hoping for more of a cheese flavor, and it lacked that for me. Oh well, I will try another.

I tripled this recipe for a recent dinner party. To say it was a hit would be an understatement. It's rich, delicious, and easy to make. I used Panko bread crumbs for the topping and sprinkled a little additional Parmesan cheese on top before baking. Woman love mac and cheese more than 50 Shades Of Grey!

Loved this recipe. Made it with penne instead of elbow noodles but it turned out just as good. But it needed more bread topping for sure

A great base for a mac and cheese. I added garlic to the sauce and I also used double the amount of pasta and added cauliflower. It was still perfect.

It was fantastic!  As everyone else stated, I was worried it was too runny but after baking it turned out fine.  I added a hint of garlic powder and diced jalepenos to mine and it was delicious!

Very good recipe. I only had marble cheese, so it didnt have as much flavour as it would have with cheddar. I think i'll use a little less bread crumbs next time, but overall  a great recipe!

Delish!  But it took longer to make and it makes WAY more than 4 serving.  I tripled the recipe (which is partly why it took longer to make) for a party of 7 adults and 4 children and there was WAY too much left over.

The kids didn't really care for this version and I am inclined to agree with them. I think maybe I over-browned the bread crumbs while cooking them in the butter? Even without the topping, not very flavorful and probably needs more cheese. Didn't care for the texture after baking. It was entirely too soft. Just a mediocre experience for us the first time round.

Very creamy and perfectly portioned, it does look like too much sauce but after baking it's fine. It has a weird texture though, and I followed the recipe exactly, except I added garlic salt, parsley flakes and pepper. It's still pretty bland. Needs something else and I'm not crazy about the texture. It's odd.

Wonderful, I changed mine a bit, I used 1c. heavy cream, 2c. 1% milk, and 1 1/2 c. Mozzarella Cheese and 1 1/2c. Cheddard cheese. I also added half an onion and 2 cups. cubed Ham. It was a huge hit at our house.

This was really good, I would just use less bread crumbs next time & maybe use multiple cheeses - but will use this recipe again as the roux contributed to a great sauce consistency.

Awesome recipe! If you're out of regular milk, soy milk can be substituted, which is what I did. It gives it extra flavor.

So...I made some changes to this. I used 1 small can of evaporated milk and fill the rest up to the 3 cups with milk. I cooked up about 6 strips of bacon, cut that into pieces and added that in, and I also sauteed 2 chicken breasts and cut them in to chunks, added 3 cloves of minced garlic to them and let them and added that in with the pasta and cheese sauce. I added about 1 T. of minced onion and some black pepper in with the sauce as well. It turned out great with my modifications, but I guess in making it again I would either make less pasta or a little more cheese sauce to compensate for the fact that the chicken soaks up some sauce as well.

Hi, i just made this like 30 minutes ago... I had fun making it, its very easy to do.  anyway, it tasted okay. :) i agree with some of the comments, its creamy... the cheese tastes rich especially the parmesan cheese. For me it lacks a bit of sugar... maybe just a little. And the sauce / cheese mix is a bit too much, so i doubled the macaroni to 16 ounces. Anyway, over all its okay. but i was kinda expecting more from it. :) thanks- my brother likes it very much.

Italian Bread crumbs (Stater bro's brand) was a little bland...maybe next time I would use a better bread crumb mix (Procresso, custom...), also it lacked the cheesy flavor I was looking for. I added Ham to the casserole mix as my own modification to get protein out of dinner. Probably should of added more ham. Would try again with maybe more cheese and ham flavoring.

This is a fantastic recipe for Mac and Cheese. I did leave out the Parmesan, bread crumbs and paprika. It was still a huge hit at my son's cookout! Everyone wanted the recipe and there wasn't any left over!!

Wow, this is the best I have found. To reduce fat content, use reduced fat sharp cheddar and skip the breaded topping. I also suggest fresh parsley garnish.

I forgot to add the parmesan cheese so I added about 1/2 tsp of salt, a pinch of nutmeg and about 1/2 tsp of ground mustard. Instead of all milk, I used a can of evaporated skim milk together with skim to equal 3 cups. It definitely needs more pasta though, maybe an additional 1/2 cup of uncooked macaroni noodles. I found my sauce was a bit clumpy, but that's my own fault - I should have waited for the cheese sauce to be completely smooth. Other than that, it was delicious!!

Had to add salt since my kids and husband complained it lacked taste. My kids also didn't like the breadcrumbs. I did add mozzarella on top, which made it tastier and more pleasing in terms of presentation.

I didn't have exactly the same ingredients for this one.  I used Monterey Jack cheese mostly, just had a little cheddar on hand.  Also, didn't have the bread crumbs so used the last of some sour cream and chive potato chips and some Frenches fried onions, crunched in a ziplock bag.  Toasted them as the recipe says and topped the mac and cheese with that.  I also added a sprinkle of shredded cheese on top.  Soooooooo, not really "this" recipe but it was very good.

Very good recipe.  Used 1/2 amount of parmesan.  Added spices & salt and cubed ham pieces.  Panko crumbs sprinkled on top worked well.

This was really really yummy. However, I didn't like the taste of the Parmesan cheese in it, it was too overpowering for me (and my kiddos). I did change the recipe a little by doing what some others did and I substituted evaporated milk for 1 cup of milk, mixed in 1/2 cup of sour cream (in a double batch), and added about 1/2 cup of velveeta cheese. My husband loved how creamy it was. I think I'll try it again, but next time, I'll nix the Parmesan.

My kids love my mac and cheese but when I made this one they said it was the ultimate, best mac and cheese ever!!!!!  I only had 1 cup of sharp cheddar so I substituted 1 cup of velveeta.  I also substituted romano for parmesan cheese.  I think the key is the sauce.  It coats all of the macaroni and is creamy and delicious.  I definitely will keep these changes to my original recipe.  Thanks

This was so easy & delicious! After reading through some other ratings & noting the ingredients in the recipe, I jazzed mine up with some spices. I chose parsley flakes, garlic powder, salt, pepper & onion flakes. The combination of spices really made this recipe pop! I also put in an assortment of cheeses depending  on what I have on hand (parmigiano, taco or casserole shredded blend etc)).DELICIOUS! This is hands down my go to recipe for Mac & cheese & I've yet to meet another I enjoy remotely as much.

The flavor was good, but I wasn't too fond of the consistency.  However, there is a good chance it was user error, so I'm still giving 4 stars.

I made this for a party last night and got so many compliments.  I added a few touches of my own.  I sauteed finely chopped onions with the butter  and used Sharp Cheddar and a Cheddar, Monteray Jack and colby mix.  I added onion powder, parsley and a touch of oregano and a layer of cheese on top, instead of bread crumbs I used panko and it was fabulous, creamy, crusty and perfect!

Amazing!  The best recipe I have made for mac and Ceeese Ever .  I used whole wheat pasta (rigatoni) and Italian seasoned bread crumbs instead of the plain for more of a "grown up" dish.  It was awesome!

Alright I have made this twice.  First time by the original recipe exactly and it was so-so.  I good base but needs some extra spunk!  So I added about 2 shakes of garlic powder, a couple shakes of onion powder, about a teaspoon of salt.  I also added some Mozzarella cheese :)  About a cup- so I reduced the cheddar a bit.  But I LOVE that there is no fake cheese in this recipe and no canned soup - great comfort food! The topping makes it!

Gourmet Mac n Cheez!  Yes, I know that it's not a 'diet food' or a 'health food,' but it is such a staple! Love this recipe. I always relied on the box, and now I'm thinkin' outside the box! I added a scrunched-up 100 calorie pack of Doritos to the topping and MMMMMmmmmmm :) Thanks so much!

Love this Mac-n-Cheese recipe. My 5 year old will never eat Mac-n-cheese out of a box again.  I made a small addition of dried mustard and a bit of cayenne to give it a little kick.

This is without a doubt the best macaroni and cheese recipe I've ever used! I love that it uses real cheese instead of Velveeta and other less-than-impressive cheese imposters. Plus, the crusty bread crumb topping gives it the perfect texture. However, I usually double this recipe's portions since this dish diminishes pretty quickly when placed before my family of ravenous mac-and-cheese enthusiasts. Also, I like to add a cup of Mexican-style shredded cheese to the sauce, and I use crushed Ritz crackers for the topping. This is sure to be the favorite at any party or dinner. Bon apetit!

We LOVE this recipe! It has become a staple in our home. We do everything exactly the same except we add a little extra cheese(we have tried lots of combination, usually using whatever we have left over from another meal) and we also cut up and brown chicken and add it before baking to take it from a side to a meal! We love it and will continue to make it!

This turned out okay, but it's just not what I had in mind.  I added nutmeg after reading other reviews and thought it added a nice touch and the presentation was pretty.  I'll keep looking for my perfect mac n cheese, but if you like baked mac n cheese you may really like this recipe.

Great recipe for the family.  I used Dubliner white cheddar which added a nice bite to it.

Maybe I cooked the sauce too long, but it was a little dry and gritty.  I also thought it was bland.  I had to add a lot of salt.  My toddler seemed to like it though.

Top notch mac cheese, been making this for years :-) I like to put a spoon of wholegrain mustard in the sauce and a tin of sweetcorn (fresh if you like!). Also baking slices of tomato on top is fun and makes it look attractive.

This recipe is so easy & fast to do.  I took suggestions from the previous reviews like adding garlic & ham.  It turned out delish!  I skipped the topping but will try it next time.

Very rich and creamy! I added an extra cup of shredded colby jack cheese and chopped up bacon.. it was so delicious! The sauce took a little longer than I expected; the cheese needs a bit more time to melt (probably because I put in more cheese than called for). I'm so excited to reheat our leftovers tomorrow! :)

I love this recipe. I am not a big mac and cheese eater but i made this and loved it. I made it with a whole box of elbow mac (1 pound) and it came out perfect and i aslo put salt in my water when i boiled the mac, and it added more flavor and i also use cabot seriously sharp cheddar that also makes a difference.

In my quest to find the "PERFECT" mac and cheese, this one seems to a very good base to start with. It actually comes out creamy! My hubby and I left off the bread crumbs (just because we don't like 'em!) and just added the paprika on top. Several others have mentioned it was bland and we agree - I'm going to retry it with either nutmeg, dry mustard, or both! I'm also considering trying it with different cheeses, creams, etc. **One little piece of advice (and this might be common sense, BUT) - work on the sauce while the macaroni is cooking. Otherwise, the noodles get all sticky while sitting in the casserole!**

I really enjoyed the texture of this mac and cheese, but as others have said there is something missing. I sauteed onions in my butter before I made the rue. I did as another person suggested and cut the milk to 1/2 cup and substituted with 2 cups evap milk and 1/2 cup sour cream. I even put onion and garlic powder in my crumb topping. All good things, but still not quite right. Honestly I think its missing salt and pepper. Just my opinion. Will definitely try again though!!!!

This is a good base recipe but it was kind of bland. I added salt, mustard powder, paprika, garlic powder, and basil. I also made it with 16oz of pasta by accident the first time and didn't miss anything so I always make that much. I didn't add the bread crumbs and just put it in a big bowl to mix and added seasoning to taste. The second time I made it, it came out runny so I think I under cooked the sauce. Make sure you give it a chance to cool before you determine it is too runny. If this happens, just microwave it for 2-3 minutes and it should thicken up. Then stir constantly while adding seasoning.

Ok, so 4.5 stars. I made the following changes:   I used a silverware teaspoon and used only 3 lvl of those for the flour. Still 3 cups milk, 1/4c butter.   Omitted Parm, as I wanted to avoid the 'grainy'. I used one cup of sharp cheddar and one cup of colby/jack to make the sauce. Unfortunately, I still had a little bit of 'grainy' goin' on, but I think its because I was cooking it too high at first. So, totally my fault. Having said that, it wasnt bad at all.   I also found it a little bland, so I added 1 (measuring) tsp of salt after mixing the noodles with the sauce, and, since we love cheese, spinked in a couple more small handfuls of the cheddar, mixed thoroughly, and then topped with cheese (cheddar) instead of breadcrumbs.  This exceeded my expectations! I thought *I* made the best mac n cheese (so did my family). Now I *know* I do.. thanks to this terrific recipe. Thank you so much for sharing it; we loved it and have a new holiday staple ;-)

So simple and delish for a cold fall night! My picky hubby loved it, and took it for leftovers the next day!  Seemed runny untill I baked it- I used 1/2 sharp cheddar, and 1/2 mexican blend cheese because that's what I had in my fridge, I also added a scoop of sour cream and used italian seasoned breadcrumbs for added flavor. So yummy!

I am giving this recipe 4 stars for taste but I a looking for recipes that are a little easier to make on a busy weekday  night. I would make this again on the weekend or prepare it beforehand. The only thing I would really change are the steps. I would make sure the bread crumbs and noodles were completely done before I started the sauce otherwise there can be too many things going on around the stove.

So I jumped this up to 6 servings, and I still wound up with a whole lot more sauce than was needed for the noodles. I had to make double the noodles. I tried out a few of the user suggestions. One I really liked was the use of heavy cream instead of just milk. I also had to cut back on the amount as well. It called for 4.5 cups of milk and I used 2 cups of heavy cream and one cup of milk. And the sauce was pretty thick after adding the cheese. I also added spices to taste. Just go with what you like in your food. I used a mix of mild cheddar and monteray jack. It was good, but I have some work to do on it. Definately make more noodles.

Very tasty!  I omitted the parmesan and instead added Beecher's smoked flagship cheese b/c that's what I had on hand.  Also added a LOT of garlic powder, cayenne pepper, and mustard powder, cracked black pepper, and sliced shittakes.  Instead of bread crumbs I ground up garlic and cheese croutons.

This recipe was o.k. but not as good as I had hoped.  Made exactly as directed.  Not a hit with my family so probably won't make it again.  Want to try another mac n cheese recipe on here with cottage cheese instead.

I've made this twice: once basically exactly as it says, the second with most of the suggestions. The second time was a bit better, but not a whole lot. This recipe is good, there's no denying that, but it's not great. Even changing things and adding stuff still leaves me feeling like there's something missing. However, this is still pretty good. Worth trying. I will be making this again, and probably with some frequency.

I really like this mac and cheese recipe.  I like that it doesn't use any processed cheese. I add some spices to the cheese sauce before baking (salt, pepper, garlic powder, etc) and I let the sauce cook until it's fairly thick.  This cuts down on cooking time in the oven, and makes the final product less runny.

I used Panco bread crumbs and it was excellent! Every one at the dinner table loved it. The recipe says four servings but we had massive amounts of leftovers, never a bad thing!

Not sure why but mine turned out really runny. I followed the directions, with the exception of adding extra cheese. I added about a cup of marble jack. Cheese mixture never really thickened. Will have to try again and see what result is.

The bread crumb topping was ok, but I thought it was unusual.  I am used to adding eggs to the liquid part of the recipe.  Different, but good.

LOVE this recipe! I also add sour cream and only use 2cups of (heavy cream) milk. Warm, cozy. perfect for chilly evenings. Some nites we add a beef smoked sausage-similar to the old weenies and macaroni, but better!

I thought the consistancy came out great. It was nice and creamy, but we did not care for the flavor. I made this for Thanksgiving dinner and was a little disappointed. It did not give you that comfort food feeling.

I loved this recipe and so did my family.  I was drinking eggnog and brandy, so I got mixed up and also put in 2 cups of shredded cheddar cheese, and 2 finely chopped green onions. ( I was looking at 2 recipes at one time.)  I didn't use the bread crumbs.  This was great.  I am glad I messed up because it came out really good.  Lol.

Best mac and cheese ever!  I crisped up the bread crumbs in the pan with butter and increased it to 1 cup.   They add the final touch to the dish, and my daughters who are picky eaters, thought that the bread crumbs were the best part!  I highly recommend this recipe.

Recipe was real easy to make. I like the idea of the roux & melted cheese being poured over the macaroni. I love cheese so I added more than the recipe calls for. I mixed mild & sharp cheddar, mozzarella & parmesan cheese. I also added garlic powder & grated black pepper.

I hate boxed mac and cheese but my husband and kids seem to love it. I want find a homemade mac and cheese that everyone would like. This was not it. It was not very cheesy (and I added an extra cup of cheddar) it was more creamy. I will not make this again.

I doubled this recipe, so I used 1 cup Parmesan, 2 cups sharp cheddar, and 2 cups marble jack.  I used medium shells instead of mac.  I browned the bread crumbs with roasted garlic, and they were good, but I hate the texture.  I would rather use bacon crumbles on top.

THIS WAS A GOOD STARTER RECIPE BUT ONCE IT WAS ALLMIXED IT LACKED FLAVOR ADN WAS PRETTY BLAND.  I ADDED AN ITALIAN MIX OF CHEESE ALREADY SHREDED THAT HAD ASIAGO THAT GAVE IT A LITTLE KICK AND ADDED A LITTLE GARLIC SALT AND PEPPER TO FLAVOR IT UP...IT WAS DEFINITELY A HIT HOWEVER NOT SURE I WOULD USE THE BREAD CRUMBS NEXT TIME BUT MAYBE CROUTONS OR STUFFING MIX.

This was good but a little bland. Somehow the breadcrumbs actually took away from the taste. I would use a spicier topping to give this a little more individuality.

It was okay. The family and I did not really like the breadcrumb cover. But that might be the choice of bread crumbs that I used. I was hoping that the kids would gobble it up, like some other reviewer's families . . . but after 20 minutes of the kids picking at the food, it did not quite happen.

Great staple! I added 1 clove of minced garlic to the butter when making the roux, and Panko breadcrumbs for the topping. My 2-year-old gobbles this up every time I make it!

This recipe was ok, but seemed a little bit old fashioned to me. The sauce was fine(thick enough), just a little bit on the grainy side. I did however use ritz for my breadcrumbs.(Which are always great). Some salt & pepper was definitely needed though. This recipe could probably be better with a little bit of tweaking. "Might" make again.

This was good and had really good flavor when I added a little hot sauce...But it was kind of dry. I may add a tad bit of milk next time.

I made this last night for my boyfriend & I. We thought it was good- very rich, but definitely needed extra salt & pepper added to the mix to bring out the flavor. Very good, though.

Easy to make and good.  However I find the sauce a little runny.

I thought it was yummy, but my family didn't like it. May try again without the parmesan.

This has all the makings of a great Mac and Cheese dish but it needs someting. Not sure exactly what. It looked great appearance wise but it was dull tasting very dull. I did follow the recipe to the T.

Personally, I don't like cheddar. I used old white cheddar in this recipe and mixed with the parmesean, I thought the flavor was good. I got ahead of myself and added the milk quickly to the roux. I wonder if that's why the dish wasn't creamy. The cheese separated from the macaroni. I will try it again, this time without breadcrumbs and with some seasoning.
