I was skeptical about this but it actually turned out really good. The mustard/ketchip/dill works surprisingly well with the tuna (I found I had to mix up more than the recipe called for though). This isn't a meal I would want on a regular basis, but it was great for a change. And I agree it goes well with a couple of poached eggs on top. Thanks!

This recipe has potential but needs serious revision with hashbrown tips such as using a potato ricer, use a well seasoned cast iron skillet, using lard or shortening instead of oil, etc. I was kind of doubtful but followed the majority of this recipe. While it was palatable it was well... just palatable.

We loved it! I added cut carrots to the potato mixture and a few shakes of turmeric to the onions. After warming everything back up in the skillet I tossed it all in a bowl and added the ketchup, mustard, and dill mixture adding extra ketchup and omitting the water. I just eyeballed the measurements and it turned out great!
