Great pasta salad!  I made it according to the recipe the first time--the second time I added sliced mushrooms and a little more garlic, yum.  Thanks Jill.

I left out the tomatoes and parsley.  Still tasty.  Next time I will add the dill weed as someone else suggested.

This is very good.  I cut the recipe in half for my family of 3.  I used elbow macaroni and added some red pepper, which gave it a nice crunch.  Also added a little pepper and used dry parsley rather than fresh.  Very light and simple to make.

Really good recipe, will use it again, and simple too.  Really liked the parsley and the tomatoes were a good touch.  Only bad thing was too much mayo, used half the mayo the second time and came out much better, and could taste the other ingredients better.

My fiance makes this for me every time he wants to cheer me up... and it works! Amazing recipe! We omit the parsley and use diced cheese instead of grated. Sometimes we make it with elbow macaroni, instead of corkscrew.

This was a nice refreshing summer salad.  It's very basic and simple and would work with different meats, cheeses and veggies.  Thanks for the recipe, will make again!

This recipe is great. I started making this because I needed to have a simple pasta salad to make during the summer for lunch for my boyfriend Bryan, something that would hold up well for the whole week. This was perfect, and he loved it. Thank you Jill for submitting it.

It was a bit bland. I added salt and pepper and it made it better. My family said they would definitely eat it again.

I made this and we enjoyed it.  I left out the tomatoes because I don't like them.  Instead i added cubed cheddar cheese.  Next time I will cut the garlic down a bit.  A little too much for a senior's digestion.  I have made it several times and will definitely make it again.

I made this one time because my mother in law really wanted some Pasta Salad so I decided to give it a try. I didn't add the tomato because I don't like them and I didn't add the parsley because I didn't have any and I used actual grated Parmesan not the powdered grated Parmesan. I also couldn't find cubed ham so I used chopped up deli ham which I think affected the turn out a little. However I actually liked it but my hubby and mother in law didn't care for it so I may not make it again because almost half of it went to waste because I couldn't eat it all, maybe I'll try again sometime  for an event like a potluck at work.

This was good. The parsley added a good touch.
