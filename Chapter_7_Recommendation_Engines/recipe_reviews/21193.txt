Excellent recipe. I tried it as is, and then tried it substituting Sour Cream for heavy cream, and liked that even better. I also added peas and fres muchrooms. Very yummy!

This is an outstanding fettuccine! I sauteed equal parts ham and onions with butter and garlic, and added both to the noodles and sauce. It has a very rich flavor and reheats well. YUM!

Simply awesome.  And I mean that literally.  This is an extremely SIMPLE recipe--unbelievably easy to prepare--with an awesome flavor, far better than I expected.  The sauce reminds me of the Sicilian sauce at Valentino's, a popular midwest restaurant, which originated in Lincoln, Nebraska.  I used freshly grated Parmesan, which is the only way to go.  This was an excellent way to use some of the leftover Honeysliced ham from the holidays.  Don't let the idea of ham in pasta sauce scare you away.  It's far better than you might think.  Do note:  As at least one other reviewer has suggested, you only need 3/4 of the pasta in a one pound package.  There isn't enough sauce for the full pound of pasta.  The pasta really soaks up the sauce.

I worked at an Italian Kitchen quite a few years ago and every Sunday the owner's wife would make a dish just like this one. She had a little drizzled eggs in hers, which I also added when I made it...needless to say, this recipe was TO DIE FOR!

A very good recipe. A good sub for the very cream is evaporated milk which will make all alfredo recipes less costly and healthier without any sacrifice in taste.

This was terrific! I did as others had suggested and added diced onions and garlic to the ham. I would guess about three tablespoons of onion and one heaping teaspoon of garlic. The ham, onion, and garlic together reached the two cup line in my measuring cup before I heated them all together. I also only used 3/4 of the box of fettucine. The sauce could have handled the whole box, perhaps, but I thought it was just right this way. I would have tried either adding peas or mushrooms, but my picky 11 year old would have certainly turned up her nose at it then. After eating it, I think the mushrooms would be the way to go, although the recipe is great without them. Thank you for a terrific recipe that I will be making again. My fussy daughter even loved it, and that is saying alot! She hates to try new things.

Pretty good - nice way to use up ham.  The cream scared me so I subbed in a can of chicken broth and some 2% milk.  Used quite a bit of minced garlic, some red pepper flakes and threw in some frozen green peas.

what a wonderful recipe! I added some garlic with the ham and butter and I think I put too much pasta in.  I used a whole box and it was a little too dry but next time it will be perfect with only 3/4 box of fettucine.

This was very easy and tasty! I made the cream sauce just as the recipe states, but I also added some stuff. I sauteed garlic, mushrooms, the ham, and spinach with black pepper, italian seasoning, and basil. I also added an additional 1/2 of cheese (I used the 3 cheese blend) and 1/2 cup of pasta water. It was delicious but  it made a ton!!!

I tried this because of all the great reviews.  Sorry, but I didn't like this at all.  Fettuccine alfredo goes much much better with chicken than ham.  I used leftovers from a delicious spiral ham I had made ... wish I just would have heated up the ham instead.  I won't make this one again, but it might just be my taste is different than the other reviewers. It wasn't exactly bad ... just wasn't good.

Everyone loved this - especially my two picky preteen boys.   The only adjustments I made the second time was 1 C. cream and 1/2 c. lite sour cream (thickens it up a little more). Oh - and some garlic.  Easy, great recipe.

This was delicious. I added broccoli to ours & used a pint of heavy cream. Will make again but not using the ham....I didn't particulary like the smokey taste.

My husband said this is his favorite pasta dish.  Like another reviewer, he says this reminds him of a dish at an upscale Midwest restaurant he dines at.  Not bad for such a simple recipe!

This was very good and easy to make. A good way to use up leftover ham. I added onion, garlic and mushrooms for more flavor. Served with a salad and this makes a great meal.

This was a great recipe.  I followed everything pretty closely, but used penne instead of fettuccine and added 1/4 diced onions to the saute pan with the ham.  I also added 1/2 cup of frozen petite peas after tossing the pasta and the sauce.  The heat transfer from the sauce and pasta heats the peas perfectly.

This recipe is Amazing!! And soooo easy! I've made it a few times now. Making it exactly like the recipe states gives great results! But I also substituted sour cream and a little milk for the heavy cream once and it was just as good! -- My husband was NOT excited to try this, but after he did, he loved it! This is a new favorite in our house!

Excellent sauce, very rich and satisfying. I've made it with and without the ham, and it's good both ways but I think it's less salty (and more pleasing to me) without the ham. This is a good recipe for a beginner, because it's so easy. I don't buy Alfredo sauce from a jar after finding this recipe.

I read the other reviews before I made this recipe, and everyone was totally right!  This was so simple, and easy I didn't even feel as if I was cooking.  A great way to use up left over ham.  I imagine it could be made fancier with added veggies, or spices, but why complicate a very easy, satisfying meal!

I wish I would have diced the ham smaller. I thought the amount of ham the recipe called for was conservitive until I dished it out to the family. 6oz. of ham was just right for our two big eaters and two small eaters. Also took another reviewers advice & made it all in the same pot (after placing the pasta in the strainer)

This recipe was great!  Couldn't have asked for an easier meal to prepare and fast too.  Great use for leftover spiral sliced ham.  Even my very picky four year old ate it.  Found it to make more than the four servings noted, a pound of pasta goes a long way.  Thanks for posting this one!!

This was very good and very easy to make. I added about twice the amount of ham because there didn't seem to be much and increased the amount of alfredo as well.  However, I reheated the leftovers the following day and it was very oily; couldn't really see the creamy part - but that's probably common with such an oil/cheese based recipe.  Regardless, it tasted great from the pan.

I loved this, but the rest of the family...not so much.  Even my son, who loves alfredo, did not care for this.  It was a little salty.  However, it was quick and easy.

In my opinion, and that of my husband, there was far too much sauce. I followed directions to a tee but the pasta and ham  seemed to drown in sauce. I might try again using much less heavy cream, maybe even thin it a little with milk or table cream.

This recipe was terrible.  The sauce never thickened - until 30 minutes after mixing with the cooked fettuccine.  Even then, the taste was terrible - did not even serve to family.  Don't waste your time on this one, like I did.

Very, very easy and good!  I used one pan for even easier clean-up.  I boiled the pasta (as per others suggestions I reduced the amount of pasta.  Also used shredded parmesan out of the can instead of grated) and while that was cooking I cut up the ham.  After pasta  was done, I drained and left in strainer then I used the same pan to cook the ham and then added the pasta back to the pan and heated thru.  The ham/sauce doesn't take more than a few minutes.  Sooo easy to throw together and on the table in 20 minutes.  Very good!  Thanks for the recipe!

This dish is excellent.  I made it for my son's football team's pasta feed along with another pasta dish.  The players loved the Alfredo sauce.
This was the first dish at the pasta feed to disappear.  I will use this recipe often.  Thank you for sharing it with me Margie.

I substituted fat free 1/2 and 1/2 for heavy cream to lighten it up, and sauteed some shallots and garlic with the ham and threw frozen pea into the pasta water for last couple minutes of cooking time.  Really good, family loved it, easy to put together, keeper!

Amazing! I was asked to prepare dinner with some leftover ham... all I could come up with ham and scallops potatoes - ugh how boring! I went in search for some recipes and this one sounded delicious! And it was!

Used a little less pasta (because we like things saucy :) and added some pressed garlic to the butter/ham.  It was excellent.

I added the most of the things that previous cooks recommended: 8 oz sliced baby portobello mushrooms, half a chopped sweet onion, 12 oz of pasta, freshly steamed baby peas, freshly grated parses an.   I added the peas right at the end so as not to break the sauce.  Amazing!  Can't believe I made it!

Love this recipe! The only thing I added to it was sliced jalepenos (like the ones that come in a jar). That bit of spice combined with the creaminess of the pasta was a HUGE HIT with the family.

Was very good, and i used up my leftover ham.  We're seafood lovers so i added shrimp too as crazy as that sounds.....
