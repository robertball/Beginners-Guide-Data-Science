I can tell you exactly why this recipe doesn't set up.  You should follow the recipe WITHOUT the butter.  Melt any chocolate you like at 12 ounces with one can of sweetened condensed milk on low heat.  After it's mixed add your flavoring and refrigerate for 2-3 hours.  Then make the balls and coat in whatever you like.  That's how this recipe is supposed to work.

I felt the same as the other 3-the recipe would not set up and all I had was chocolate goo-then I added a cup of sifted powdered sugar and put it in the refrigerator for an hour (this was after two hours sitting on the counter in a covered bowl.  When I started to roll the balls it wasn't too bad.  I was able to scoop out the balls put them in the fridge for a short while, then I rolled them in the goodies.  They were a hit at the party.  I think the next time I would use about 2/3 the amount of unsalted butter and a cup of the powdered sugar.  They really were delicious.

I made this for christmas presents and gave a small batch as samples and they were gone in less than an hour. They didi not believe that they were homemade. I skipped the butter, and dipped them in chocolate almond bark for a crispy outside texture awesome i am in the process of making another bathch to serve with my christmas dessert platter.

this is my second christmas using this recipe. i love it. i use soymilk and margarine instead of butter and milk, and they turned out great. 
i made one batch with baileys and rolled them in cocoa, and another batch with coconut milk then rolled them in coconut. 
they're always a big hit. :)

This recipe turned out perfect! Not too sweet but just right. To let this have time to sit we just put it outside in the cold winter, mold them, and roll them in powdered sugar and itwas perfect!!!!!!!

I thought this recipe was fantastic!  I made the chocolate in the morning and let it sit in the fridge untill later that night.  It worked great and tasted wonderful.  I shaped the truffles into mini eggs and coated them in a lot of powdered sugar (you couldn't see any brown)  They looked like mini eggs.  Everyone loved them.

once again, yummy gooey mess (it refused to set).

very delicious, but this recipe seems to make more of a chocolate caramel than anything else. i've coated them and put them in the fridge, but the best use i can think for the recipe right now is as an accompaniment to ice cream, on top of shortcake or in a devils cake.

this recipe will not make truffles, but its very yummy anyway.

My truffles turned out great!!! I made them for a potluck and everyone loved them! They were very simple with great results! I did the cocoa coating which was so easy!! I put them in the fridge after preparing them to harden them a little more, but made sure to take them out to room temperature a couple hours before serving them!

I've heard from a reliable source that you'll need to freeze the 'gooey' chocolate, then leave it covered on the table (for hygiene), until it is almost the same temperature as the surrounding.  Then the problem of gooey chocolate/mess is then solved.

I had the same trouble of it not setting up and now have lots of (a yummy) rich pudding, am going to try adding more chocolate. I would suggest cutting back on both the butter and milk.

I thought this recipe was pretty easy,except for the stirring.  Tasted great and I actually had to make more.  Kids loved them and also loved to help roll them in the different coating.  I used powdered sugar, cocoa powder, finely chopped nuts, and also had some Heath bits (the best). I just used the basic recipe, but next time will try adding some different flavorings. YUM!!

I made this with just condensed milk as others suggested. I scaled down to a very small size to try out and was sort of in the dark with the milk measurements, but it worked out nicely. I dipped mine in melted chocolate after set and rolled in goodies.

Making these was easy except for making and coating the balls by the teaspoon, especially when I got about four cups of the mixture. I did have to refrigerate the mix for several more hours for them to form. Worth the effort!

I made these chocolate truffles in four flavors: Orange, coconut, coffee, and plain(vanilla).  I heated the chocolates, butter and scm in a double boiler.  I was afraid it wasn't going to set up so I stuck it in the fridge and it was nicely firm for scooping in about an hour.  They have great flavor and great mouth feel!

Loved this recipe! It doesn't set up very well, so I ended up putting it in the fridge for a couple of hours and then I was able to shape the truffles. SO TASTEY. I made these as a surprise for my fiance with Amaretto and coconut and he went CRAZY for them!

Like everyone else, on the first round when I followed the directions exactly, these were a gooey disaster.  SO on round two - I used 10 ounces of semi-sweet chips, 5 ounces of unsweetened chocolate, the s/c milk and only 2 tablespoons of butter.  Instead of 6 T of flavoring I used 4 T of Amaretto.  Also, I borrowed a bit from Ina Garten, after the ganache had chilled in a bowl for an hour, I dropped it by spoonfuls onto a baking sheet, let the globs chill for another hour and then hand rolled them to round and coated with cocao and almonds.  WITH MODIFICATIONS this recipe is great.

The first time I tried this recipe I used evaporated milk instead of condensed milk and it would not set fully. Then I made it again, this time with the can of condensed milk and the chocolate mix set perfectly after  an hour or so in the fridge.

2013: I made these again this year for Christmas. I used orange Citrine liqueur this time and I use 2 extra Tbs. That gave them a good punch because I did not think the raspberry that I used last year added any flavor. I left the orange peel out because I was afraid I would not grate it enough. This is definitely for chocolate lovers. My family did not seem to like them as much this year but that is because they are so rich and chocolaty. I also made the mistake of putting all the butter, last time I used 6 Tbs of butter like one of the reviews said. I had to make sure to keep them refrigerated because using all of the butter makes it separate out. Not sure I'll make it again.
Update 2015: I have made these again and have decided that the next time I will make them smaller. I used dark chocolate and they are so dense and rich that only true, die hard chocolate  lovers will enjoy them. I also tried dipping them in white chocolate, but I have to perfect that. It was messy and I couldn't get the chocolate thin enough. They are not the prettiest, but they sure do have a strong orange liquor flavor! Lol!
