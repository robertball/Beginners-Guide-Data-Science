Warning: This lasagna recipe needs some essential modifications. 1st, it is very liquidy and I even ommited the water (because I suspected this problem). I also baked it uncovered to try to compensate for the liquidiness, but it was still too watery in my opinion. 2nd, there is no salt and pepper in this recipe, but it definitely needs it. I sprikled salt and pepper over the spinach layer and over the top sauce layer and this was sufficient. 3rd, I didn't add the final layer of mozzarella cheese until the final 10 min of baking. This worked well. (I added some parmasan to the top layer as well which definately enhanced the flavor.) I didn't use carrots simply for personal taste, but after the modifications the flavor was very good. Just too much liquid.

This was my first attempt at lasagna and it turned out great!  I used the regular noodles (no veggie juice), made sure to drain the spinach and it turned out perfect.  I do admit I used twice the amount of mozzerella and added parmesan so don't know if that still qualifies as 'light' but my husband is a cheese guy. Will make again, Thanks!

This turned out well.  The carrots make it kinda sweet and I used a jar of pasta sause that already had basil in it on top of the basil the recipe called for so I will adjust that next time.  But it was still super good.  I used whole wheat noodles, no vegetable juice, and more cheese.  I will make this again.  With just two of us, it's nice to have left-overs too!!!

Very tasty my family loved it. Even my youngest daughter( who HATES spinach ) liked it. We had it with salad and garlic bread so it turned into a perfect rounded meal.

This lasagna was very easy to prepare.  Use a deep 9x13 dish, as my 9x13 cake pan overflowed a little.  I thought it was a little bland and needed twice the seasonings.  My husband had it the first time the day after I made it.  He raved, so apparently it's one of those dishes that's even better the next day.  I used all the ingredients listed, but found italian spiced ground turkey and used spicy vegetable juice.  I also had run out of basil & substituted it with cumin, which I guess turned out to be pretty good!

I discovered half way in that I was missing cottage cheese, so I omitted that, the egg and the frozen spinach. I also used regular noodles and omitted the water and the tomato-vegetable juice. It was more of a casserole than lasagna, but it wasn't bad.

I haven't made this yet but since several say it is watery-it only could be from NOT draning the spinach. I am betting that you must squeeze the spinach with a paper towel. I would like to see  feedback from others on this.

This is exactly what I was looking for in terms of a healthy lasagna. After reading the reviews I used 2 eggs instead of 1, omitted the water and it turned out perfect. I also added more spices. Since I didn't have carrots and had frozen mixed veggies, it was an easy and great substitute.

I made a few changes and followed some of the tips in other reviews and it turned out great!  Here are a few of the changes I made:  I didn't have onion on hand so I had to substitute with onion powder.  Added pepper and salt.  I didn't add any water, and instead of vegetable juice I chopped up 2 cups of cherry tomatoes.  I also used mozarella and parmesan.  This is a wonderful healthy version of lasagna!

My family really liked this lasagna.  It has a lighter more dynamic taste to it than our usual meat and cheese sauce and italian seasoned lasagna.  I liked all the vegetables and V8 juice the kids were getting in them- even though my son scraped off his spinach layer.  I omitted the water and didn't drain the spinach.  At supper it was fine.  Re-heating, I had a lot of water on the plate.  But the taste and nutrition is great, so I wouldn't take away any stars for that.

With modifications, this lasagna was amazing. I think the carrots are the magic ingredient. Pleased my veggie-phobic husband.

Some reviews had said the lasagna was too soggy, so I did the following to prevent it getting too wet:
-After thawing the frozen spinach, I wrapped it in a paper towel and squeezed out as much water as I could.
-I omitted the tomato juice.
-I used only about half as much water as they suggested.

Some reviews said it wasn't seasoned enough, so I did the following to add a little flavor:
-I added salt and pepper to the sauce at the same time I was adding the other spices
-I grated some fresh parmesan onto the top of the lasagna before baking. (Not much; maybe 1/8 cup or so.)
-I used about 50% more mozzarella cheese (1.5 cups instead of 1 cup)

I like a crispy top, so for the last 10 minutes with the foil off, I turned the broiler on high to brown the top up.

This was absolutely delicious!! I used fresh spinach (what I had) and fresh basil (again what I had) and omitted the water and tomato-vegetable juice cocktail since several reviews said it was so watery and it was absolutely perfect without the extra liquid.  My 9 year old and 3 year old raved along with my husband.  This will definitely be my go to lasagna from now on!

I made this without the mushrooms and enjoyed it. I did not care for the texture of the noodles which were mushy. I think I'd rather use pre-cooked noodles despite the added work and prep time. The sauce was good, and I will try this one again.

Really good! Don't forget to DRAIN THE SPINACH! I used regular noodles, omitted the veggie juice, and just used 3/4 c of water... next time i could even use 1/2 c of water and it's be great. This recipe was a hit! 
Also, i added more of the spices.

This recipe is great- with a few modifications.  First, add salt and pepper to taste.  Another tip- don't cook the noodles before you assemble the lasagna.  This will help everything stay together better.  Also- I don't add the water or the tomato-veggie cocktail.  I've made this recipe twice now this way and it's a delicious meal!

This is an excellent recipe! Like everyone else says you should not add that 1 cup of water. I did just to try it out and there was a bit too much liquid. Also, I used 2 cups of cheese instead of 1. It was delicious!!

I took advice from other reviewers and omitted the water. Good decision. I used Classico spicy tomato and basil spaghetti sauce and also added crushed red pepper to the sauce as my boyfriend and I like a little kick to our meals. Also because I grew an herb garden this summer, I used fresh rosemary, basil, and oregano. The ratio of dried to fresh should be 1:3, but I just eyeballed it. Oh and I used 2 c of cheese and not 1. The boyfriend was happy and so was I! Good healthier choice for lasagna!

Made this today and loved it, wasn't watery at all like other reviews said.   Substituted chopped brussel sprouts for the spinach and used Mrs T's Bloody Mary mix for the tomato juice.  For some reason after it was in the fridge and reheated, it tasted even better!

This recipe was very good! My husband and kids loved it and the extra veggies were great...they didn't even know they were there to pick out. I boiled the noodles so didn't need the tomato juice. It came out perfect. I will use this recipe often from now on.

I loved this recipe! Totally delicious with a few changes of my own. I used Healthy Request whole wheat lasagna pasta and didn't use mushrooms or carrots since there were veggies in the sauce I used. I made sure I drained the spinach and cottage cheese before using so it wasn't too watery. Baked at 350 for an hour. Thanks for this great recipe!

This is my very favorite lasagna!  For years I've made the "World's Best Lasagna" on this site, it's great too - but that was mostly for our kids' Big Appetites.  Now our diet is healthier overall, and this sounded tasty.  I LOVE it!  I left the carrots out because one reviewer said it was sweet.. I did press all the liquid out of the defrosted spinach so it was dry, and still did not add any water.  My bag of spinach was 12 ounces, so I added an extra egg, considering other reviews. I noticed after dinner that I didn't have that "overstuffed" feeling from too much heavy meat and cheese.  This is our new lasagna, thanks ZOO66!

Delicious healthier take on lasagna! My husband is gluten-free, but I was fortunate enough to find brown rice lasagna noodles, and I hardly noticed a difference in taste. I followed suggestions of other reviewers and used 2 eggs instead of 1.  I would suggest doubling the mozzarella cheese.  I used 1-1/2 cups and 2 would have been better.

This was delicious!!  I realized after I started I didn't have ground turkey so I used some chicken sausage I had- this added a really great flavor!  I omitted the water but otherwise followed the recipe and it turned out great!  Will be making again!

Very good! I omitted the water and egg and subbed chicken broth for the juice. Used small curd cottage cheese and fresh spinach, wilted in a pan. I chose to add the herbs in with the turkey. Will repeat!

I  added whole wheat pasta, which worked well! I also cooked the noodles prior and did not add water or tomato juice and it was still plenty juicy!

We really like this lasagna! I use regular precooked noodles and omit the water and vegetable juice. I also use ground venison instead of turkey. You don't miss the extra pasta or cheese!

DELICIOUS! I used whole wheat "regular" noodles and DID NOT cook them prior, and it turned out perfectly fine. Not too watery, either. I also substituted 1 yellow squash and 1 zucchini (both quartered) for the carrots and loved this addition! I'm also allergic to dairy, so I only put the cheeses on one side and this worked great as well... "my" side wasn't too dry and had plenty of flavor. This will be a big hit for company :)
