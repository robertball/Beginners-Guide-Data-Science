I tried this recipe for a pot luck dinner last night and it got rave reviews!  I gave the recipe out to 2 different people.  I only changed a few things - I added a can of crushed tomatoes and just a pinch of fresh basil.  VERY delicious!  A keeper for sure!

I very cautious on the meals I prepare for my picky husband, but this is one dish he enjoyed! He came back for seconds and thirds.  There is one or two things I would change though, I would add a little more italian dressing and intead of placing it over the pasta, I would combine it all and then add the parmesan cheese once you serve it onto the plates.... (you can even cut up the sausage) I will defintely make this again!

This dish was wonderful, a nice change from using sausage with tomato sauce base, the flavor was great, think I will add oregano and basil next time.

This was pretty good.  You have to really like Italian Dressing though.  I made a few changes.  I used mild sausage that had been frozen.  I semi defrosted it and sliced before cooking.  Then I used fresh mushrooms and frozen combo of peppers and onions.  I used Romano instead of parm, just because that's what I had.  I also used tri colored rotini instead of penne for the same reason. tfs

Really good as is.  I almost always tweak recipes, but I don't think this one needs a thing.  My husband LOVED it.

I made this one strictly for my husband since I don't eat pasta. He said it was ok but don't bother making it again. He felt it was very bland. For the record I did add some garlic and oregano and extra Italian dressing. Also I mixed the noodles with the vegetables and sausage during the last few minutes of cooking. 
This was simple to make and does make a pretty presentation. I guess it just needs to be kicked up a notch flavorwise.

This was okay. I used fresh mushrooms because I had them. My family was split on if they liked it.

This is a good recipe. Tasty and hard to mess it up. I used Jennie O. "light" turkey sausage, Good Seasons Italian Dressing + fresh mushrooms. 16 oz. pasta was too much. I used 12 oz. Next time I  make sure the spices are a bit more concentrated. Someone who does not like italian spices would not like this-thus, the 1 STAR rating I saw.

I was halfway through making this when my sister dropped in for dinner, so I added a can of tomatoes to make the sauce go further. This was a very yummy pasta dish and very filling!

Wow this was really good. I didn't think it would turn out as well as it did. My family and I loved it. I did use more Italian dressing, maybe a cup or so and I added some garlic. For a bunch of very simple ingredients this dish is quite tasty.

This was an amazing recipe!  My whole family loved it!  I didn't add the onions or mushrooms but, added fresh broccolli and sprinkled in some mozzarella cheese at the end with the parmesean.  I also used a balsamic vineagrette dressing ( 3/4C.) and mixed everything together in a big bowl.  It tasted great!  Thanks for this fantastic, fast, and EASY recipe

This was a delicious dish.  I added a little fresh ground pepper before eating.  When heating the leftovers, I added 1/2  24 oz. jarred spaghetti sauce.  Great enhancement to the leftover pasta!  Will definitely make this dish again.

I tried this and thought it was delicious.  I used hot sausages, and a roasted red pepper italian dressing, added a 1/2 tbsp of roasted chopped garlic, and 3/4 cup of chopped grape tomatoes.  Different from the usual pasta and sauce dinner.

I've been looking for another way to cook italian sausage. I think I may add some sun-dried tomatoes as well. But I really loved this recipe, it was easy and very tasty. This is a new regular meal in my house!

I too, was getting a little tired of my regular supper ideas, so I gave this a try.  My connoisseur husband kept saying..."incredible...a definite repeat for sure!"  I cooked exactly as the recipe stated!  So, I got the recipe box out, and added this one to my favorites!  Thanks!

I loved this dish. Very simple to make. I too added garlic and italian seasoning and mixed the pasta in with the veggies at the very end. I used Honeysuckel sweet Italian Sausage. I will definatly be making this more often.

Delicious recipe.  I used ground hot Italian sausage since I didn't have any links.  Didn't have mushrooms, and created my own "dressing" with olive oil, fresh garlic, oregano, onion powder, celery seed and salt and pepper with a little white vinegar, but it was a hit, and even my 2.5 yr old said yum!

This is pretty good! Made 4 servings for my fiance and I tonight (expecting leftovers for lunches this coming week). While we both liked this, we did feel that it was somewhat lacking in flavor.... I think next time, I'll add some red pepper flakes to give the dish a little kick. I'll also do as I did this time and use both mild and hot Italian sausage to add some complexity. I pretty much followed Hawn's directions exactly except for the following: a) omitted mushrooms (we don't care for them), b) subbed red onion for yellow (all I had), c) crumbled my sausage instead of slicing it (my mistake!), and d) used 1.5 times the amount of dressing called for (seemed dry otherwise). Oh, and I did not pre-measure the amount of cheese (Itallian three cheese blend - asiago, romano and Parmesan) either. Who measures cheese lol!!!!! Served with garlic bread, a side salad and wine, this was a nice meal. Thanks for sharing, Hawn :)

My husband loves this.  I have used Kraft's Asiago Balsamic Vinaigrette reduce fat dressing as that is what I had in my pantry.  I think that different dressings/vinaigrettes may be used to keep the recipe from getting boring. We are huge fan of mushrooms so I added some extra.

This recipe was awesome!  I read the other reviews and made just a few changes.  I cooked the sausage links in 1 Tbsp EVOO.  To the veggies I added 1 tsp oregano, 1 tsp celery salt, 1 tsp basil, 1/2 tsp chili flakes (or red pepper is good) and 1 14.5-oz can Hunts basil, garlic & oregano diced tomatoes.  I used fresh mushrooms instead of canned, fresh Parmesan and had to use Ziti as that is what I had enough of.  When all was done I put it into one big pot, mixed it well and served.  This was so good, both myself and my husband had to smile after the first bite.  The smell was wonderful while cooking.  Thank you Hawn, wonderful dish!!

I loved this recipe. Very easy and tasty. I did make a few changes. I added more italian dressing, red and yellow peppers and fresh mushrooms in place of the canned. I also cooked the sausages all day in the slow cooker with chicken broth. they were very tender and flavorful. The skin was not even an issue. Thank you for the recipe I will use it again my family loved it.

My Italian husband LOVED this!!! Used sweet Italian sausage cooked in olive oil, fresh mushrooms, and oil and red wine vinegar dressing along with a combination of Italian spices. Really fantastic. Thanks for sharing.

This is one of our favorites. My husband's eyes light up when I tell him it's Italian Sausage Delight for dinner! I usually skip the mushrooms, only because I don't think they add much. And I usually sprinkle some creole seasoning on top with the parmesan cheese for even more kick. YUM. Reheats really well, but you'll need to add a squirt of extra dressing since the pasta absorbs most of it in the fridge.

This was good but not sure if I'd make it again.  I still prefer it with a red sauce and since I don't make sausage very often there's no real reason to switch it up.

This was fantastic!  I cut up the sausage and instead of using Penne pasta, I used Fettucine (broken in thirds before cooking) and mixed it all up together. Very Good! I will defintely make this again!

This was really good and easy, my husband who loves pasta enjoyed it. The only 2 things I did change is I added more dressing and mixed in pasta with mixture at the end. Topped with parmeasan cheese, YUM!!!

Wow, we both liked this one!  I got everything ready for this in the afternoon, scaling it  back for just two of us.  I cut up my peppers (a mix of green, red, yellow and orange), onions and fresh mushrooms.  I also minced a couple of cloves of garlic.  My sausage was pre-cooked so I sliced it into coins and browned it.  We are watching our carbs so I used only 2 oz. of bowtie pasta, and I cooked it ahead of time also.  I stored everything in the fridge until dinnertime.  Then it was just a matter of sauteeing the peppers, onions, mushrooms and garlic in the salad dressing and then adding the sausage and pasta and heating every through.  Once everything is prepped, this comes together quickly.  We’ll do this one again!

Wow!  This was way better than I expected!  I lightened it up by using hot italian turkey sausage, whole wheat penne and light zesty italian dressing.  I didn't have peppers on hand so I doubled the amount of mushrooms.  I can't wait to try it with peppers next time!  I did as other reviewers suggested and doubled the amount of dressing.  It was perfect!  Will definitely make again!

This recipe is very good!  I hate bell peppers, but decided to give it a try since I was looking for new Italian recipes.  It was great, it just needed more dressing than 1/2 cup otherwise delicious.  Next time I am going to add more veggies oh and I used fresh mushrooms instead of canned!  Thanks for the recipe.

I just made this and my sweetie loved it! I think I used a little more Italian dressing than is called for and fresh mushrooms, but other than that I followed the recipe.
He's taking leftovers for lunch tomorrow :)
Thanks for sharing this one!

I tried this because I wanted something quick and it was just that ... also easy. I did change a few things and my husband loved it! I used fresh veggies; some broccoli, mushrooms, tomatoes; seasoned with basil and oregano also and no Italian dressing.  Brown rice is a healthy alternative to pasta. Great week night recipe.

Nice alternative to my sausage and peppers. The recipe as is was bland to me. I added more dressing. I also think crushed tomatoes should be included in the recipe. They absord the sauce well to ensure flavorable bites. If I make this again I will do it free hand to suite my taste. I appreciate this recipe giving me a new idea.
