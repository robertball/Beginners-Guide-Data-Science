N*R I didnt' think I was going to like this, since I hate green beans, but my family likes them, and loves feta. They RAVED over it, so I tried it. Turns out, I only hate BAD green beans! These are GREAT, and how our family will fix green beans from here on out!!!

Interesting  to try but I learned feta cheese and green beans are not a good combination for me. (And feta hating Hubs wouldn't even try them)

I liked these green beans, but I am not sure about the addition of the butter with the olive oil, so I'd omit that next time.  I also would prefer to just drizzle the olive oil over the beans along with the lemon, salt, and pepper instead of finishing them off in another pan to wash.  Otherwise, just perfect.  Can't wait to eat the leftovers!  N*R  Go to the Recipe Exchange to find out about N*R

We actually enjoyed these quite a bit.  The lemon, feta, and beans were a great flavor combination.  We did add a little bit of garlic to the butter olive oil mixture, because my husband said he couldn't live without it.  We will be having these again and I can't wait to try them with fresh beans from the garden.

I used frozen green beans, and followed the same directions.  In a word: YUM.  All five in my family devoured them, even the picky 5 and 2 year olds.

This was a very easy and tasty way to prepare green beans.   We love feta cheese, and having it on this vegetable was new to us.  I will definitely make this again!

Yummy!  I also added bacon to my green bean salad since I already had some cooked and refridgerated.  Great side dish.

I love fresh green beans and this is definitly a good way to fix them.  They were easy to fix and the flavor was great.  I only made 1/2 of the recipe, more than enough for two.  I think for health reasons I will leave out the butter next time.  I served this with the Lemon Garlic Tilapia from this site.  It was a good combination for dinner. Thanks so much for sharing. N*R

So tasty, my kids even eat these.  I  am pleased with the recipe as is, no changes needed.  The acidity of the lemon juice is such a lovely contrast with the feta!

These were really good.  I would lessen the amount of butter next time, just to cut back.  I liked the feta and did not think I would.  I served with slow cooker beef stew. N*R

This was a nice change but next time I will use a better quality feta.  It makes a difference.  I usually auto-nuke my green beans but I do like the better control of cooking them on the stovetop.  Thanks for sharing!

This was actually pretty good. I wasn't sure with the first bite what I thought because the lemon juice gave this a tang and was a little offputting at first. The feta cheese really worked well with this and I would not leave it off as it really is needed to balance out the tangy lemon juice. I took a shortcut and used canned green beans, so I just started with the skillet step. This was a nice dish and I would eat these again. The rest of my family really didn't care much for this and would rather not have it served again. I liked the lemon pepper flavor. Thanks for something really different.

I halved this recipe for just two.  I boiled the beans in chicken bouillon.  Be sure not to overcook the beans since you are going to cook them a little in the frying pan.  I put 2 T. EVOO in the frying pan along with 2 cloves of minced garlic.  I cooked the garlic for a little while and then added the drained beans.  I poured a couple of teaspoons of rice vinegar on it along with the sea salt and pepper.  I also squeezed a couple of lemon wedges over the bean/garlic mixture.  Then after mixing all well I topped with the feta and let sit for about 5 min. until the feta warmed up some.  I think next time I'll use a little lemon zest too.  This was wonderfu.

This was pretty tasty, I went by the review which stated to add bacon, and it was good.  I think next time I will use a flavored feta.  Probably will make again. Im so mad I didnt get a chance to take a picture, By the time I remembered there was only a few beans and pieces of feta left!lol  N*R

I've had a lot of green beans, but these are the BEST!!  They went great with our Easter ham, but I will be making them with everything!  So refreshing, the lemon is a great balance for the green beans, and the feta is delightful!  A++

This is excellent and a nice change for green beans! Even my college-age son who is a picky eater (especially when it comes to vegetables) really liked this recipe. So much that he took the leftovers back to his apt!  This is a winner. I probably used 2 T lemon juice and only 1/4 C feta cheese crumbled. That was plenty.

I bought some great feta to use in this recipe, I followed the recipe exactly, and it was a thumbs up from everyone who had them. I will make again with some very minor changes including steaming the beans, as that's how we prefer them. N*R

I was completely surprised by the taste of this dish! It has a wonderful flavor. I love that the feta cheese doesn't melt and you get a chunk of chesse with every bite. I made the recipe as written and will be making this often!! A*R

I wasn't sure this recipe would fly at my house, I was partially wrong.  The husband loved them, but the kids wouldn't go near them (they are like that with anything new).  I agree with other reviewers that you could omit the butter with the EVOO and I will omit the salt next time - feta is strong enough for me.  Like the idea of pine nuts or almonds added to this!  We will be having this again...especially since the H likes it and it came from AR! N*R

Wow, my husband and I both loved this recipe! The beans are so flavorful and even a little feta goes a long way to amping up the flavor. Best of all, it's an easy side. Thanks for sharing!

This was good! I don't usually like cooked green beans, but I really liked this. For my guests, I put the feta in a bowl on the table instead. Everyone could add their own in accordance to their tastes.

These were delicious, I had to use frozen beans, but with the lemon they tasted so fresh. I accidently cooked them too long but they were still delicious. Looking forward to my garden crop of beans. This is good hot or cold. Anything with feta is tasty.

Totally late making this but so glad I finally did. I added a little Tony Chachere’s to spice it up a little. This time I omitted the snow as I served them with mac & cheese. Delicious! I'll be making them again soon and with the snow. N*R

Hubby and I thought this was good.  We discovered that we liked feta cheese (who knew).  Since Hubby's plate had to be warmed up his cheese melted but he liked it that way.  The kiddos did not care for this much.  They did not like the crisp tender green beans.  Will try this again but will cook the green beans longer to appease the kids. Maybe a little less lemon too.

These were yummy. I am not really a big fan of lemons but still added the juice and I think the lemon was a bit too much but the hubby loved them. Used garlic and herb feta and they were yummy. We had my BIL over for dinner and he was eating them right out of the pan! Served with baked bbq chicken and chef joe's mac & cheese. What a great meal! N*R

Superb!  Loved the flavors of the fresh lemon with the feta cheese. I steamed the green beans in a bag in the microwave rather than boiling.  I added some chopped garlic to the skillet with the butter and EVOO. I used the garlic herb flavored feta for added flavor.   This dish will make a wonderful accent to so many different main courses.  I will use this often.  Thanks for sharing such a fresh and delicious recipe. N*R

We thought this was a really fresh, tasty way of making green beans.  It was very simple to prepare, although I skipped a step to reduce dishes.  I drained my beans and just used the pot I boiled them in to complete the dish.  Excellent, THX>  N*R

We really enjoyed these!  Normally, I'm not a big green bean fan, but I loved these.  The feta gives them a good kick!  My husband really enjoyed them too.  I made them as is, but we thought that adding a little bacon to them would be fun too.  I'll probably try that the next time.  N*R

We really liked these.  The only addition I made was to throw some sliced almonds in the pan with the green beans.  And make sure the feta is finely crumbled; otherwise big chunks overwhelm the tastiness of the green beans.

Liked the fresh lemon with the salty  Feta. Preferred to use EVOO instead of butter (healthier) and I accidently bought "Garlic Herb" Feta. Recipe was a 5 star so maybe that was a good mistake!

Yummy!!!  We absolutley loved this recipe!  I love green beans anyway, but this was so easy and good.  Next time though, I will remove some of the green beans before putting the feta on top.  My 5 year old didn't care to much for the cheese, but my 21 month old loved it as did my husband.  This will be a nice easy veggie to make every now and then.
Thanks!!

This was an excellent way to dress up frozen green beans - I used the whole green beans that steam in the bag.  I halved the butter and oil, and used reduced fat feta, which I think tastes less salty.   Will definitely make again!  N*R...looking forward to trying more N*R recipes!

N*R, nice and refreshing.  I made it according to the recipe, kept the string beans a little crisp as I like the taste of fresh green bean.  Nothing needed to make this tasty.

Wow - I was so pleasantly surprised by how good this combo was. I found really crisp, fresh beans & cooked them slightly longer because mine still tasted a little green. Loved the addition of the feta (didn't realize that I liked it so much). Added garlic - can't cook without it. Really felt fresh & healthy. Join us on the Recipe Exchange - N*R

This is a great way to prepare green beans - even canned ones.  I wanted to try this recipe but didn't have fresh green beans, so I substituted canned beans.  Just make sure the butter and oil is really hot in the pan, then add the beans, stirring as you add the seasonings.  I used garlic and herb feta cheese, and also added a dash of garlic powder - mmmmm!  I can't wait to try this recipe with freash beans!  Thank you for a great recipe!

My family loves these!  it is one of our go-tos.  When I am short on time, I blanch the beans with lemon juice and then sprinkle the feta over the top.  Not as rich of a flavor but it tastes great, too.

This was really good! I used Trader Joe's French green beans and only wish I dried them more after boiling them. I ended up adding more butter because they were more watery than I wanted.

I love this! I had no idea the lemon and feta could give it such a light fresh taste. I wonder if it would still be as good if you added garlic

This is very much as tasty and easy as I'd read in previous reviews.  I have always cooked green beans  by boiling them in ham-hock simmered water until they were soft and flavorful.  Moving further away from eating red meat, I am constantly looking for new way to cook old favorites without sacrificing flavor.  I am so glad I found this recipe!  The tender, almost crunchy green bean (al dente) is the real star of this dish, supported by the lemon and feta cheese, which really hits it home.  This is healthier, easier, and takes less time than my old favorite cooking method.  Both hubby and son went back for more...as did I.  Definitely a "heart" to this one, and it will be added it to my rotation of new favorites.

I made these for Christmas dinner and everyone loved them.  They have a nice, bright  flavor and are a light accompaniment to a big meal.  Two pounds is a lot of beans, and if you're using the full quantity, make sure to use a large enough pan so you can easily turn them while sauteeing them.  My pan was full and so my beans were a little unevenly cooked, but they were still excellent.  I highly recommend these for a different way to prepare green beans.

This is a nice green bean side dish with a Mediterranean flair. But to me, butter doesn't belong here. So I skipped it and doubled the olive oil. Also added some garlic.

This is very good. The only thing I did different was use less butter and add a little garlic. The flavors really complement each other. Had it on the side with fish. Definitely something people should try to have something different.

I add lemon pepper to the butter/evoo and some fennel seeds as well and cooked them until the seeds popped, then I add the beans and some sundried tomatoes as well. Everyone forgot about the main course and gobbled up these scrumptious veggies!

Any time we have steak, I'm "required" to make this dish. I've since made variations by adding Bleu Cheese instead of Feta or by using more cheese (we are cheese fanatics in this house). Every time I make it, it's simply delicious!!

I didn't have feta cheese and used goat cheese instead. Wasn't quite sure it was the right combinations of flavors for me, though. Worth trying with feta cheese, I thought it tasted good anyway.

The lemon with the beans gives a wonderful flavour. I sauteed white onions and fresh garlic and added them to the mix. Very yummy and super healthy -- you can make double and reheat the next day.

Made this as a side dish for some grilled pork chops, and they were fabulous. The combo of lemon juice and feta worked well with the fresh green beans. This is something we will make again.

This is amazing!  By far, the best green beans I've ever cooked. I used asiago cheese because that's what I had on hand but I want to try it with feta. I do meatless days and I can easily see this as a dinner entree!

I added garlic powder.  I added the seasonings at the same time I added the green beans to the pan with the melted butter and olive oil.  I cooked for 2-3 minutes then turned off the heat and stirred in the feta and let it warm and melt a little.  Very good.

I was surprised at how tasty this was. I used frozen beans and just a touch of coconut oil (instead of olive oil and butter). So very good--even my friend who does not like green beans took a second helping! So simple, so yummy!

Don’t let its simplicity fool you, this dish is packed with flavors. The lemon juice creates a zesty tang which pairs nicely with the creaminess of the feta.

We really enjoyed this recipe! The cooking method is the ONLY way I will prepare my fresh green beans from now on. I tweaked it a little bit to accommodate dairy allergies. I have a huge skillet so I was able to boil the beans in the skillet first, which saved having to use 2 pans. Then I saute'd very thin slices of red onion in coconut oil (no butter) for about 2-3 minutes. Seasoned as described to taste, but I use Crystallized Lemon instead of the juice. You can find it in the spice section...I LOVE to use this powder in so many things! The brand is called TRUE lemon. They also sell a lime one too! Carrie thanks for sharing!

Really tasty. I omitted the butter, instead using some olive oil to which I added a finely diced shallot until fragrant and slight touch of salt. It was a nice, simple and healthy side dish.

Very nice green bean recipe to try something different.  Even better that the recipe is easy.  Everyone seemed to enjoy them.

Thought this would be another ho-hum grean bean recipe, but I listened to the reviews and tried it.  Loved that the beans were firm, and the combination of the lemon and feta worked so well, even my cooked vegetable-adverse daughter scarfed them down!

Mmmm, hubby and I really enjoyed this.  The flavors went well together.  I omitted the salt because cheese is salty enough for us, but made as directed otherwise.  Will make again, thanks for sharing!

We liked it - nothing special but who doesn't like feta cheese?
