Very nice combination of ingredients.  I made some modifications that included grilling the chicken and doubling the sauce ingredients.  I find I never have enough sauce!  I cut the chicken into 1/2 -3/4 inch slices and put them right in the sauce with cracked pepper and parmesan cheese and served it over penne noodles.  Next time, I will probably marinate the chicken overnight with Italian dressing.

This was amazing and absolutely delicious!  My changes were minimal.  You do NOT need to use that much milk for the egg milk bath.  So I dropped it to 1 egg and 1/4 cup milk.  I elected to use grapeseed oil as it has a higher heat tolerance. I used a mix of Italian seasoned Panko and Italian seasoned breadcrumbs, instead of all heavy cream (and to save calories) I used a mix of 1% milk & heavy whipping cream using a 3:1 ratio.  I used a 6 cheese Italian blend and I left out the salt - the proscuitto is MORE than salty enough.  Once the chicken was finished I kept it warm in the oven. Other than that there were no other changes.  I used barefoot pinot grigio as it's a good quality white wine.  Next time I'll toss in some fire roasted bell peppers.  This is a "dining in" dinner and a keeper!

i made this yesterday for mothers day and i was a hit. i did change some things though. i let the chicken marinate in thousand island dressing and added lemon pepper as well. i doubled the amount of heavey cream and garlic but kept the same amount of spinach. i added 1/4 cup more prosciutto and cheese. i let this all boil for 10 extra minutes and servered it- the chicken and sauce- over linguini pasta and topping it with more cheese. i sliced and lightly toasted french bread, severing it on the side without butter.

I have made this several times and it is wonderful.  We normally use half and half in place of the heavy cream (because it is what we have on hand.)  It is worth it!

If there was a way to keep the chicken more crisp while the sauce is cooking, it would be perfect! I will use the leftover sauce on cooked pasta. Very tasty.

We enjoyed this dish this evening, but i believe it could be made with less  waste.  I could easily have made it with one egg and 1/2 cup milk. I ended up tossing a lot of the crumbs, just more than needed.  I also used less cream and used chicken broth instead.  It is healthier and very good.

This was simply delicious!  I made a few changes; used 1/2 & 1/2 instead of heavy cream, used parmesean/asiago cheese blend and doubled the sauce (as recommended by a previous reviewer). After frying the chicken I placed it in a 350 oven for 10min to finish cooking.  Definately will make again.

Extremely tasty.  I thought we were eating a restaurant quality gourmet entry.  Everyone loved it, even our picky vegetable eater who does not like spinach.  The only difference I made was using bacon since we were out of prosciutto.

This was so good!  A really decadent meal and so impressive. It is a lot like pasta carbonara with the addition of chicken and spinach. Without the chicken, this is honestly one of the best pasta carbonara recipes ever!  The spinach is a wonderful plus and a great way to get kids to eat veggies. With the addition of the chicken, it is a different meal.  We had last minute company, so I cut the chicken into strips to stretch it. It was still amazing, but maybe not as elegant. Because I cut the chicken into strips, I used every bit of the egg and bread crumb mixture suggested. I would agree with other viewers that you probably don't need that much if I would have left the chicken whole.  I would like to try it again and simply grill the chicken strips.  One reviewer suggested this (skipping the whole breading process) and I think it would actually be better if I was to use strips again.  I would bread the chicken if keeping it whole. This is not a weekly meal (way too decadent), but definitely a keeper for an occassional treat or a special dinner. Everyone raved about it and even the kids cleaned their plates.

This is an amazing recipe, only thing I did was add sun roasted tomatoes to it because I thought it would pair well.

Excellent. Great blend of flavors. You have to be careful not to add too much salt since there's a lot already in the prosciutto. I'll make this again.

The dried bread crumb mixture in the recipe was measured  waaaaay too much as was the egg mixture!! Cut both in half just for the bread crumb and egg/milk part because after 4 very ample chicken breasts, I had a ton of product left to dump and I hate waste!! And the cream sauce was so restaurant quality in flavor and substance it didn't need the cheese AT ALL!! (Trust me, I tasted it before!!) It's yummy!!

This is delicious, but I agree that the relative proportions are a little off.  I cut both the breadcrumb mixture and egg mixture in half, and it was still way too much.  Like others, I lightened the cream sauce a bit by subbing half the cream with milk. I eliminated the salt like another reviewer suggested, but I wish I had added a pinch to the sauce. I can see this being a go-to recipe for me. It was really easy to make.

Excellent!  Marinated tenderized chicken in Garlic Expressions and worcheshire.  Cooked 6 slices bacon in the oven, then reserve the grease.  Added parmesean, fresh oregano to breadcrumbs and baked chicken in oven instead.  Start sauce with the reserve bacon grease. Added additional spinach and halved cherry tomatoes.  Use less cheese, and use romano or Asiago instead of mozz.  Served with asparagus.  Was so tender and delicious.

I followed the recipe to the point of stirring the mozzarella in with the spinach and prosciutto. At that point I felt the sauce was thick enough and adding the cheese would just turn the sauce into a ball of glop. Instead I added fresh grated Romano at serving time. Good decision, and the result was very tasty.

This was delicious!  I cooked the chicken in the pan as directed but not completely.  That way it cooked the rest of the way in the oven while I made the sauce and was hot when it was time to eat.  Used bacon and light cream since that it was I had.  My husband said "mmmmm" lots of times during dinner!

Holy cow this was good!  Restaurant quality for sure! The only thing different I did was pound the chicken to about 1/2 inch thick and added 5 cups of spinach. I wanted to pour the sauce in a glass and drink it! Yummy!
