I was hoping to make a light, cheery, fresh-tasting cake with my yummy strawberries. Unfortunately... well, you know that cereal that Calvin (& Hobbes) likes to eat -- Chocolate-Frosted Sugar Bombs?? This recipe makes me think of that. It was Ã¼ber-sweet. The cake *alone* is probably even too sweet, but when you put this frosting on the top... wowzers! (in a bad way) I'd try a different frosting recipe and see how that goes. Or maybe just go with "Strawberry Cake I" or "II" here at Allrecipes.com instead. I'll try it again tonight with a cup of coffee and see if my opinion improves. I've also got guests here that might try it. Until then... no more sugar for the day............ OK, I've been eating it with the frosting scraped off -- it's tolerable, maybe even "good". But that hot-pinkness.... it looks a bit fakey. My guests said that most strawberry cakes are quite sweet, but one did comment on the "surprisingly powerful and welcome" taste of strawberry.

I made this cake in a 2 layer heart shaped cake w/ Whipped Cream Cheese Frosting from this site, and it was SO GOOD!! I got a lot of compliments, 2 people said it was the best cake they've ever had, and they don't really even like cake.  1 person said that I was the new best baker that she knew!  I LOVED IT! This cake was really moist, my husband said you didn't even need milk w/ it.

Very good cake.  I omitted the coconut and nuts - personal preference.  I made the following substitutions as well - 1 c. applesauce in place of oil, low fat condensed milk and sugar free gelatin.  Could not tell the difference.  I also baked in two 9" cake pans to make a layer cake and sliced fresh strawberries on top.  Looking forward to trying again with different fruit.

This was very good. I made it twice, the first time strictly according to instructions. I found it a bit too sweet, so the next time I substituted buttermilk for the sweetened condensed milk. Excellent! The buttermilk made the cake a bit more dense, but it was still tender and delicious. Got rave reviews.

This is a very easy and fast cake to make.  It is also very moist and rich in flavor.  Here is a little tip.  If you wish to make this cake when strawberries are not in season, buy fresh strawberries and freeze them.  Then when you are ready to make the cake, thaw the berries in a colander overnight, getting rid of the liquid.

My niece's mother-in-law made this cake at Christmas where I tasted it for the first time.  I honestly think it just may be the best cake I've ever had.  Her recipe is ever so slightly different in that she uses just plain whole milk instead of condensed milk, but they are essentially the same aside from that.  I'm making one today and can't wait for dessert this evening after dinner.  If you like strawberries, you'll  ~love~  this cake.

This cake is amazing! It's seriously the best cake I've ever had. The frosting tasted buttery so I had to add more strawberries and some extra powdered sugar though. I also put an entire bag of coconut in the frosting instead of the amount called for. With a few minor adjustments this cake was wonderful.

This was a great and easy recipe.  And the kids loved it!  I also had several adults ask me for the recipe.  I did leave out the cocunut and walnuts to be kid friendly.  It was wonderful!

Thanks for the recipe.
I left out the nuts and added a banana with extra strawberries.  Based on the smell I give it a 5.  Keep up the good work!
God bless & many thanks

Review for the cake only. The previous reviews caused me to not make the frosting. The cake is moist, sweet and flavorful enough that I didn't think it really needed icing. Served with whipped cream and a few fresh berries. Followed cake recipe except did not include the nuts. It seemed that everyone liked it (it was eaten) but no real excitement or requests for the recipe this time. Enjoyed trying a new recipe. Thanks for sharing!

I'm really rating only the frosting, here. I wanted a strawberry frosting recipe for my chocolate cake, so I tried this one. 

The basic flavor is good and it's easy to prepare, but yikes, it's super duper sweet. I might try it with less sugar next time.

I didn't use the frosting that was suggested, but the cake was amazing.  I made the batter just as suggested in two round pans for a layered cake.  I put raspberry preserves between the layers, because I didn't have strawberry.  It was delicious.  I topped the cake with cream cheese icing and decorated it for my Father-in-law's birthday... strawberry is his favorite.  We all thought it was delicious.

This is the best Strawberry Cake EVER! I did not add the nuts to mine. It makes way to much extra frosting though!! My husband is going to get FAT since I started trying all these new recipes on all recepes.com He is LOVING it!!! He ate almost the whole Strawberry Cake by himself. His grandma used to make a Strawberry Cake like this, but didn't add the coconut. He loved it with the coconut!

I made this cake exactly by the recipe for Easter dinner.  I did frost it differently.  used a tub of coolwhip and then fresh cut strawberries with melted choc drizzled over top.  Absolutely wonderfu!  They devowered it! I am just not a fan of sticky frosting.  I also read a review that this cake recipe can be used as a breakfast cake! Absolutely!!! wonderful cake!

I thought this would be so good and I bake all the time. I will never make it again.  I think the problem was too much oil, way too much.

The strawberry cake was awesome. The only reason that I gave this recipe a 4/5 was I found the icing too sweet so I added more strawberries. It got rave reviews from my in-laws!

I only made the frosting (used another recipe for the cake). I left out the coconut. The frosting was good and VERY sweet. It was not as thick as I would have liked. Not sure of what to add to fix that. Will make again next year though (for my dad since strawberry cake with strawberry frosting is always his birthday request). :)

I can only comment on the frosting portion of this recipe.  I made a checkerboard cake using white cake and strawberry cake (I did not use this recipe because it uses a boxed cake mix and I wanted to make it from scratch).  I used the frosting from this recipe to frost between the layers of the cake, and used a white icing to frost the outside.  I thought the consistency of this frosting was perfect, and the coconut added nice flavor and texture.  It went beautifully with my cake!  I will use this frosting again.

I made this into 2 9" round cakes last night and it tasted wonderful.  I think next time we'll leave out the coconut since we prefer the texture of the cake without it.  The only thing that I did differently was I did not add nuts and actually added more coconut than called for and I used a different icing. I made a chocolate buttercream icing and topped the cake with strawberries dipped in chocolate and small chocolate ribbons & toasted coconut.  Thanks for this wonderful recipe :) withsome tweaking to our personal preferences I think this recipe is a keeper for my family.

Well everyone loved the cake and said it was excellent.  Thought the frosting was very sweet, even after cutting back about a cup and a half of sugar.  So I will keep trying to play with the frosting and sugar amounts for slightly less sweet.  I also kept my cake in the fridge - it seemed to bring out the strawberry flavor in the cake a little more.

I only used the frosting recipe on this so my rating is on it not the cake.  I used the frosting on a strawberry box cake mix and it was delicious. I left out the coconut just for my own preference and added more strawberry and it was sooo good!

Wonderful! I made this cake for a co-worker's birthday and it was a total hit.  I substituted white cake mix for strawberry mix for extra strawberry flavor and was very pleased with the results.  However, I did forget the walnuts.

I made this cake to take to my grandmothers for dinner and there is barely any left!  I made the cake exactly as directed except I left out the nuts and frosted with coolwhip and topped with sliced strawberries and toasted coconut. The cake was so moist and even my picky husband came home and had seconds. I'll definitely make this cake again and I even passed it along to my grandmother. Thank you for the great recipe. Exactly what we were looking for!

This is a very good and tasty cake.  Omitted coconut and nuts because of two in our crowd (one does not like nuts and the other does not like coconut).  I happen to like both.  Used a light icing made with instant pudding, whipped topping and powdered sugar (not too sweet or heavy).  I am going to make this with nuts and coconut and please MY crowd, who likes both.

Overall, this recipe was pretty good.  However, most people who tried it thought the frosting was too sweet.  I might try cool whip as a topping if I make it again.

What a great cake. Great strawberry flavor. The reason I didn't give it five stars is because some thought the frosting was a little sweet. My sister suggested using cool whip instead of all the sugar. Not a bad idea.

I'm rating the frosting on this recipe, since it was all I used. The flavor was amazing, it actually tasted like real strawberry. I left out the coconut and used about three cups of sugar. You don't have to use the full four cups unless you want it to be thicker, I would suggest adding the sugar gradually until you get the texture that you need. Since it seemed a little runny at first, I let it chill for 20 minutes, and it worked just fine to frost a layer cake. I also used butter instead of margarine.

Made the cake according to the recipe except that I added a half cup of cream cheese to the icing. It was too sweet for my taste without it. That is also why I gave it 4 stars but will for sure make this cake again!
