I've never had chicken shawarma, so I really don't have anything to compare this to, but we liked it! You definitely need some kind of sauce to serve this with though, or it will be quite dry. I made a quick sauce with plain yogurt, tahini, garlic, a bit of lemon juice and some chopped herbs, salt & pepper. We served this, sandwich style, with pita bread, sliced cucumber, tomato, red onion and the sauce. Really similar to a gyros, but with chicken. Thanks for sharing the recipe.
