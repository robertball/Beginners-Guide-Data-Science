I made this for a clients dinner party, doubled the recipe and it was very well received.  I used diced fresh tomatoes, not the cherry tomatoes but either way would be good.  I also made my own basil pesto.    Served with quartered Chia Pitas from Costco.  It was a huge hit.

this is delicious. I cooked everything at about 375*f. it took a little longer for everything to cook, but gave me time to chop and mince everything else. I also omitted the olives and added about a tablespoon more green onion; my family LOVED it. Strongly recommend.
