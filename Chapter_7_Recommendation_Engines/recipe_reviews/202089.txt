I doubled this recipe. I did not have garlic scapes, I used two cloves fresh minced garlic. I also used lactose-free milk. I cooked this in my cast iron skillet, using a little bacon grease in with the butter. This was very good--my husband and I especially liked the use of white cheddar cheese in this. We ate every bite of it.

Very good and a nice twist on regular 'ol scrambled eggs! I love ham and cheese with scrambled eggs and if you like garlic, then you'll like this recipe. I cut the recipe in half just to give it a try and it was very filling. Scrambling eggs with a bit of milk gets them nice and fluffy. Since I didn't have green galic I just used a bit of minced garlic. I also cut back just a bit on the salt and pepper using it only to taste. This was delicious with whole grain toast and OJ but would also be great tucked into some flour tortillas for a breakfast wrap!

Rich and cheesy scrambled eggs, yum!  I used garlic chives from the garden instead of the garlic scapes.  The secret to tender fluffy scrambled eggs is to cook them on low heat.  These went very well with crispy potato pancakes.

Used chopped garlic from the jar. Made this for a breakfast for dinner, turned out great with some fried potatoes!

I made this using one egg and substituted garlic powder and Colby-Jack cheese  for listed ingredients. I use amounts that work for me (i.e. amount of sodium); it only makes sense.  Chives or scallions would work great here. This was so delicious and filling and would be great at any time of the day! Thanks for the easy recipe!

Made these for breakfast this morning and we both loved it which says a lot since I don't eat scrambled eggs. These are so much better than plain scrambled eggs. Thanks for this delicious dish.
