Now I don't have to go to the pizza place for prima vera. In the time it would take me to get ready to go out, I can have this done. I've used various vegetables and it always turns out great!

I always keep condensed milk in the cabinet, I thought this recipe was a great way to make a quick home-made dish.  I added red pepper flakes to the sauce to spice it up for my husband and I served the mozzarella on the side so the sauce wasn't too rich for me.

I was very impressed with the way this tasted... but only after adding some salt to give it more flavor. Next time I will add more cheese to the sauce, or something else to give it a more unique flavor. I really enjoyed the vegetables in combination with the sauce and pasta. I would definitely make this again, just add a little more flavor.

My husband and my kids really loved this one. I did add some extra mushrooms and garlic, but it would have been great either way.

Great recipe if you are counting calories but don't care about taste!  This recipe was easy to prepare, but is incredibly bland.  Cooking the veggies this way made them a bit limp as well.

I made this with medium expectations and it hit there.  We used a tube pasta and I changed the veggies and used only broccolli but followed the sauce recipe the rest of the way.  It was a nice thick sauce but when we ate it we felt that it was missing a punch.  If I attempt this again I will defilitely add more mozarella and maybe some parmesean cheese. On a good note, my three and two year olds loved it.

This sauce was extremely bland and the frozen vegetables were mushy

I thought it was good but for the time it takes to make I found that there are several kinds you can buy in the store that are just as good, if not better.

This recipe is heavy, inexpensive , and easy and quick to make.
I started with butter and garlic followed by adding artichoke hearts. Next, added chopped mushrooms with enough vegetables broth to let that simmer( added red pepper flakes) for 7-10 minutes than added the french green beans with a bit of Himalayan salt.
The sauce-as a tip, maybe add not as much corn starch as called for, thats what makes the recipe 'heavy' - and, you dont need alot of Mozzarella or Parmesan cheese either.
I would suggest spinach fettuccine.
Great additions would, of course, be shrimp, scallops, chicken.

This recipe was very easy, however, lacked flavor.  I omitted the tomato and mushrooms and added onion and garlic powder in hopes of adding flavor, no luck.  I also used a 14.5oz can french style green beans drained because I couldn't find frozen.  It just wasn't for us, I would not make this again.
