I didn't like this recipe at all. It's prett much pure sugar - golden syrup, sugar & honey - with just a little buter, flour, etc.. to make it bakeable. Anyway, way too sweet for me, but the teenage boys I served them to seemed to like them.

These cookies are awesome, I did find when i baked them for the listed time they did not seem cooked so i cooked them for longer however that was NOT a good idea, you must pull them out after 12 minutes and let them sit for about 5-10 minutes and they will be perfect!

It was too sweet even after cutting the sugar by half. The batter was too soft to roll so had to add another cup of flour. Instead of snap, it turn into a cookie. Still fragrant n crunchy though. Easy to make too.
