Let me respond to some of the less favorable reviews. Please use dry uncooked grits. You can also use 2 eggs instead of 1/3 cup of egg whites. Yes, it will be drier than traditional meatloaf, so use catsup, salsa, or your favorite gravy to moisten. Personally I can eat it without any help. Yes, the taste differs from the traditional beef/bread crumb texture. It's more dense, spicier and not as sloppy, which is PERFECT for leftover sandwiches that has mayonnaise or mustard. My fav sandwich consists of mayo, dill pickle, lettuce, tomato and sour dough bread. Yes, you can use onion soup instead of onion powder/garlic salt seasoning. Let me know how that works. I am intrigued by one person's use of polenta instead of grits. I want to try that and see if the moisture of the polenta adds to the texture of the loaf.

Made exactly as written even the tinfoil handles - I think those must have been written for a small, round crockpot not the oblonge ones cause they weren't really much help, but a couple of wide spatulas did the trick.  Overall it tasted pretty good, might tweek the seasonings a little but other than that we enjoyed it.

Well, I was worried about this recipe. And there was really nothing to be worried about. 1st bite I had tasted like pure sausage(must have been a chunk I didn't blend thoroughly)...so I took that the whole meatloaf was the same taste all the way threw. I was wrong. It did have an italian flavor to it. But I'm not used to this style at all. It was very good overall and moist and no where did I feel or taste any gritty texture, you would have never known there were grits as a binder in this recipe. However, one thing I think bread crumbs or crackers do that grits do not. Bread crumbs and crackers soak up and mellow out the spices in meatloaf and grits are so small they do not. But that's not a bad thing. I'd see my self making again. My kids loved it, loved it more then myself. But as long as they were pleased. Then that's okay..thanks

Tasty and easily prepared.  I was afraid the grits would be, well, gritty, but they were nicely incorporated.  I will definitely cook again.  And the foil strips are ingenious and not to be skipped.  They will definitely make your life easier.

I'm not a meat eater, but did prepare this for the family.  Hubby said it had a good flavor, but the texture was different because of the grits.  The recipe doesn't let you know if you should use instant grits or the other.

I was surprised how good it was. My family is skeptical of me trying new things and they enjoyed it very much.

I hate to say this, but it was bitter and dry, and the texture was different.  I am going to stick to the falling apart meatloaf.   For some it may be the best but not in my household.

This is one of the best meatloaves I have had.  I did make some changes.
Ground Turkey
Sweet Italian Turkey Sausage
Added a package of dry onion soup
oregano
Italian Seasoning
salt and pepper
Omitted the smoke
Boy was this great.  The grits make a better binder than breadcrumbs

SOOO DELICIOUS!! It's so nice to have this slow cooker recipe because it's different than the usual stews or chilis.  The only change I made is that I used marinara sauce in place of the ketchup because I had some in the fridge that I wanted to use up.  Thank you for a great recipe!

I was very surprised how good this was and how much my family loved it.  I followed the recipe exactly and probably would not make any changes next time.  My wife said that we definitely need to put this recipe on the rotation.  I would rate this a 4 although my family all said 5 stars.  Looking forward to some leftovers for sandwiches tomorrow.

This was one of the best meatloaf recipes EVER.  I used a medium spicy sausage and and cooking it in the slow-cooker mellowed it out.  It was perfectly dense and make great sandwiches the next day.

Yes, changes: I had no grits, so fell back on fresh bread crumbs; no sausage, so used grounded up kielbasa after removing the casing; added basil and forgot the cheese, adding it to the second loaf only; and added Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce. When I look back at the steps, they are almost like a new recipe!  however It was so good that we are glad there is another one in the freezer almost like it for another time. I'd better write the ingredients down before I forget and have another 'new' recipe.

I tried this recipe today.  It was okay.  But mine did not turn out outstanding like most allrecipes recipes.  For one thing I did not use my slow cooker.   I went to the oven which should not made a big difference, but the grits may have been better cooking slowly.  I may have overdone it on the seasoning too.  My Mom's meatloaf did not have a lot of seasoning.  I tried grape tomatoes and that seemed to work.  And I will try this again next time I'll try the slow cooker.  Meatloaf is a challenge and our Mom used to get it right.

A hint for everyone----if you will make this in one of crockpot liners it will come out in tack and you also have a container to store it in the frig.

It was good. I added 1 lb of sausage and truly enjoyed it. It was like breakfast and dinner combined! Yum
