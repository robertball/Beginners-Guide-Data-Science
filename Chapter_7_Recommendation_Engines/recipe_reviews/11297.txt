Wow this recipe was so good!  I made some slight modifications, though.  I added raw coconut and flax seed in place of sesame seeds.  Thanks for the tip.  But to keep them from crumbling, I added raw almond butter. Then after I pressed it all in the dish, I poured a 1/2 cup of distilled water over the top and stuck in the freezer for 15 minutes.  YUMMY for a starting raw foodist.

As a healthy alternative bars are amazing! However, if you're just looking for whatever tastes the best, these probably aren't for you. The recipe can use some changes: I replaced the carob with cocoa, replaced the oats with granola, replaced a portion of the nuts with shredded coconut, and added 4 Tablespoons peanut butter and 1/4 cup water.

Yuck! All I can say is Yuck. My 10 year old begged me not to ever make it again. I could stomach it with a ton of honey, but plain is horrible

I really liked these. I used almonds instead of walnuts, grinded in the blender with the sunflower seeds. Also i used regular chocolate because I had no carob on hand. I also added some peanut butter like others suggested.

These would actually be healthier with cocoa. Carob has a lot of fat in it, when we were kids my mom was a health nut and basically ruined our childhood with that nasty stuff, it wasn't until we were grown and it was too late that they started reporting that carob wasn't very good for you.

Amazing. We loved them. My daughter even burned the sesame seeds and put them in anyway (definitely NOT recommended) but they were still excellent and I can imagine variations and possibilities. Rice syrup is a super substitute for honey too.

These are great. Our little girls even love them! This is a great recipe to start with, the possibilities ARE truly endless. Definitely NOT a BROWNIE, reminds me more of an energy bar. We've substituted oat flour for all of the carob, added some protein powder and coconut and they were amazing. Get Creative-these are so good. We make this recipe frequently.

I really liked this recipe. I modified it to my own taste, a little cashew butter, flax seeds, less walnuts, some rice crisps in the end. The biggest flaw I see is calling it a brownie, its a little misleading, to me it seems more of a Carob Chew..

Yummy treat!!! These disappeared within hours - I could not keep my 4 kids out of them. Decreased walnuts to 1 2/3 c. and made up differnce with ground flax seed.  Added 1 T. or less of PB, and subbed a bit of molasses for honey I was lacking. Will make again.

Excellent!  I used ground flax seed in place of the sesame seeds, added a few pumpkin seeds, used brown rice syrup instead of honey, added about 1/4 cup of almond butter, and a splash of rice milk.  These were wonderful!!  I am considering adding crispy rice cereal to the next batch and maybe even coconut or dried cherries.

This taste almost like a carob fudge I make.  My fudge is better but these are really good.  I only did 1 cup walnuts and added 1 cup coconut.  It needed a little more honey, but otherwise this is great.

I really couldn't stand these. Being the health nut that I am, I expected to absolutely adore these, but I found them inedible.
The whole mixture was too crumbly, and even after adding more honey and some brown sugar the strange carob aftertaste was overwhelming. 
I'm willing to try this again with some peanut butter or something, but this batch ended up getting baked with whole wheat flour, egg substitute more brown sugar and peanut butter chips. 
It was edible...

I have made these a few times now. These are little tasty bites. The raw diet and recipes are not for everyone. However, from other raw sweets I have tried these are pretty good. The flavor and texture is like a mix between brownie batter and a no bake cookie. Only change I make is using plain unsweetened cocoa powder instead of carob as I find it healthy also. I grind the raw sunflower seeds and sesame seeds in my Vitamix on low then on medium for about 30-40 seconds, the oatmeal, cocoa, and lastly the nuts at the same speed until ground. I pour it into a small bowl and mixed in the honey. I did 1/4 of the recipe to try it the first time. The next two times I did 1/2 of a recipe, as walnuts are just so expensive right now. Instead of making squares I like to just scoop them with my cookie scoop and keep in the refridegerator wrapped, until I want one.

Delicious!  I will make these again and again.  Kinda felt like a hippie, but honestly the possibilities are quite endless.  I used crushed Walnuts and toasted almonds (instead of sesame seeds and sunflower seeds) and then in the intrest of fibre, some All Bran (about a cup).  At first i thought the 1/2 cup of honey wouldn't saturate the dry mixture but after stiring for a bit with a wooden spoon, the honey saturated the mix and once chilled made a crisp, totally yummy, easy to cut into bars, treat!  Next time i will use WHO KNOWS! all sorts of stuff!

Very tasty and addictive!  I customized a bit using some coconut and flaxseed because I had no sesame seed.  Added TBS peanut butter and decreased walnuts - room to be versatile because it's no-bake. (and a lot less guilt over traditional brownies!)

I thought this was really good and healthy!! Great way to satisfy the chocolate craving. Like soemone suggested, I poured 1/2 cup of water on top but maybe it was a little too much, next time I'm going to only pour about 1/4 cup.

Very good!! The carob powder was a little different at first. But after I got used 
to the taste I couldn't stop eating them.  It's a healthy snack that you can 
eat for breakfast. The second time I made them, I added in raisins, unsalted 
soybeans, and less carob powder.

Yummy and Healthy! This is a good snack for kids and adults alike.  Carob, sesame seed and sunflower seeds are good sources of calcium as well as other good stuff.

I just made this for the first time and doubled the recipe for my big family. Took some of the other reviewer's suggestions and substituted ground flax for the sesame seed and added 2Tbsp almond butter to help it stick together better. I didn't have any walnuts, so I upped the sunflower seed/rolled oats. Oh, and I also added a bit of coconut oil.
Then, to press them into a glass dish, I lined it with wax paper, just to make removed simpler. These are amazing. The carob is great, although I wouldn't call these brownies, more like a glorified chocolate granola bar of sorts. Still, an amazing treat for when you are wanting a healthy sweet!
