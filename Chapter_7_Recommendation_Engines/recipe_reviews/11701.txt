Outstanding...it was all gone; I made a double portion to share with friends. I had no peanut oil or tahini so I used canola oil and peanut butter. I used the flat 'linguine' type Chinese noodles. It can be heated if you prefer it that way....

Okay this was great, but I had to make alot of substitutions. My tahini was a little dried out so I used peanut butter. I used udon noodles, and chili sauce instead of chili oil (1/4 t is all you need, it's hot!). Minor changes, but I LOVED the end result.

This was a HIT with my family, including the 2 year old.  I made some changes - doubled it all, seved warm, used whole wheat penne pasta, and blanched 1 bunch of bok choi leaves and steams (sliced small) for 2 minutes in the reserve liquid and added it to the mix.  In addition, I just mixed everything together rather than putting the chicken on top of the pasta.  It went great with roasted asparagus

This is also good warm. I made a double batch: half to eat warm at dinner and half to chill for lunch the next day. Very tasty. 

I can't seem to find hot chili oil anywhere, so I substituted a smaller amount of Tabasco sauce. EDITED TO ADD: Finally located some chile oil, and the recipe is even better using it (the full amount called for in the recipe).

I've found that the chicken needs to cook a bit longer, closer to 25 minutes.

Excellent - I added a bit more water to the finished dish just before serving to make the noodles a little 'wetter' - the resulting sauce was wonderful!  I also added a good sized handful of chopped fresh cilantro.  Definitely a "make-again"!

I could take or leave the chicken part. I made mine with regular pasta and it was delicious! It happens to taste just like Annie's Goddess Dressing. Yum! I think it would also be great substituting peanut butter (the real stuff not Jif) for the tahini.

It's hard to give this a rating because the family had mixed reviews.  2 of us loved it (the females) and 2 did not like it at all (the males).  I followed the recipe except for being unable to get chili oil at my grocery store.  Both of the guys felt like something was missing - vegetables?

One of my favorite warm-weather meals is the Chicken with Cold Noodles from Szechuan Noodle Bowl in Seattle. This is close, but I want to play with it a little. The sauce was a little thinner than I'd like, but it was still very good. We added julienned carrots and cucumber, like the restaurant does.

I had a bunch of leftover linguini from a catering gig that was pretty bland (had oil and sun-dried tomatoes on it) and was looking for a good use.  This worked out great and tasted just like the sesame cold noodles I get from Chinese take-out.  I totally agree with lovemymutts' review - I skipped the chicken.  This could use a touch of sweetness, so I think the natural peanut butter would do the trick (or a mix with tahini).  I also toasted some black sesame seeds and threw them in, and subbed sriracha sauce for the chili oil, as I did not have any.
