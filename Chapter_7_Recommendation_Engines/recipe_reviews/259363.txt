Good recipe! One important thing to point out though is that an hour cook time is too much on the fish. I'd say 45 minutes max but I'd check it at 30 minutes. You've got to keep in mind that the fish will continue to cook as it is cooling and then once the patties are assembled it gets cooked another 8-10 minutes.  I had a bit of green bell pepper that needed used so I diced it up and added it to the mixture and it went good in there too. I recommend this recipe but just be sure to not overcook your fish.
