This is out of this world!  I cut the sugar in half, used rice vinegar and used sweet yellow canned corn and regular onion - it was delicious!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  It doesn't specify - but be sure to drain liquid from beans and corn before dumping into salsa (some people might not know better, just thought I'd share). This could also be a nice side dish as well without chips.  It's fabulous!

I've brought this to several parties and it's a hit every time!  The only change I make is I use 1/2 the amount of sugar the recipe calls for and I find that I have to drain 99% the liquid before serving.  Also, try adding avocado but it's good with or without that!

Great taste, but a little too much sugar with red wine vinegar.  I added fresh basil. YUM!

I followed the instructions exactly with great results.  It does make a big batch, so buy plenty of chips!  I served the salsa with blue corn chips--yummy!

Fantastic! I had something like this at a party recently and could not stop thinking about it; this is really close to what I had. I also used half the amount of sugar and super-sweet corn. I used a whole red onion, but that's your prerogative. I don't know if there's a difference between "rice wine vinegar" and "rice vinegar", but I used rice vinegar because it was all I had and it was delicious.

I too cut the amount of sugar in half. I found that this was perfect. I also added cilantro for that extra something, and I loved it.

If you cut sugar way down, add red wine vinegar instead of rice vinegar, and touch of cumin and cilantro it rates a five !

Good thing this recipe is huge - I sampled it the night before serving & ended up eating half of it!  As suggested, used half the sugar and was awesome & a big hit at the party!  Thanks!

This was really good!  I made this as a side dish to go along with some carnitas we were having and this paired perfectly.  I scaled the recipe to just 2 servings, using half a can of black beans and half a can of regular yellow corn.  I eyeballed the other ingredients and just threw in what looked about right.  My scaled recipe called for 2 T. plus 2 t. of sugar, but I only used 2 t. in mine.  That was as sweet as we wanted it.  I also added just a bit of vegetable oil, which I think improved the mouth feel of this.  So, my advice is to scale way back on the sugar and add it to taste, and you have a winner here!

I saw and made a recipe almost identical to this a few years ago and it was a hit. Suddenly, today I was reminded of and inspired to make it again. This stuff is SO good, that you can practically just eat it with a spoon! What I really love is that it gets better every day that it sits in the fridge (so I recommend making it at least a day in advance to give all the ingredients a chance to soak up some of that great vinegar flavor. Like many of the other reviewers, I also suggest cutting the amount of sugar in half and using red wine vinegar instead of rice wine vinegar. 

...it's so good!

LOVED this.  Followed the recipe exactly.  Nice change from your typical salsa.  Make sure you use rice wine vinegar.

This salsa just isn't for us. It is entirely too sweet for me, even after reducing the amount of sugar. In order to save all of these beautiful vegetables and beans, I added a heafty sprinkling of hot sauce and garlic powder. This helped, but it was still much too sweet. Thanks anyway!

Delicious!  I made this to take to a party.  It was so easy, too.  I cut the sugar to 1/4 cup and this was plenty (the rice vinegar is kind of sweet, I  think) added a can of petite diced tomatoes with jalapenos (drained), a bunch of chopped cilantro and about a 1/2 TBSP of olive oil.  (I was going to add a chopped avacado but it wasn't quite ripe). It was devoured. The bones of this recipe are really great and you can add to suit your personal tastes and guests. I am going to try it with other vinegars to see how it is.  Thanks for this recipe!

Made this for book group last night! A complete hit.  Only change I made was halved the sugar amount.  I used one can white sweet corn and another can sweet yellow corn.  Served with lime tortilla chips.  Caution:  Make sure you use rice wine vinegar- not just rice vinegar.   Will make this again!

Serving isn't right if you are using as a salsa. This does make much more than 6 servings.  I followed other reviews and halved the sugar and still thought it was too sweet and also felt it was too much corn and not enough beans.  I will make again and adjust accordingly.

Great recipe!  We also add 1 can of black eyed peas and different colored sweet peppers for color (1/2 of 3 works well). Serve with multi grain scoops it is so amazing and always gets rave reviews wherever we go.

Super Summer Salsa Haiku: "First day taste OK. Second day, salsa heaven! Just a few changes." So, without a doubt, I was floored at how much better this tasted the 2nd day, after it had had ample opportunity to fridge flavor-mesh. I didn't have rice wine vinegar (used red wine vinegar) and although I was skeptical at following another reviewer's suggestion of fresh basil (I would typically use cilantro w/ black beans), I was amazed at how wonderful the basil complimented the vinegar. Oh and I had to use green bell instead of red. Small changes aside, this was out of control rad.

Great Recipe!  It's found a spot in my favorites.  Modified it a bit due to what I had in the pantry: used unsalted canned yellow corn, added a diced  avocado, used half the sugar as the reviews recommended, and traded the rice wine vinegar for 1/4 cup balsamic vinegar and 1/4 cup white wine vinegar.  It was an immediate smash, but the left overs are phenomenal after a night in the fridge!!!  Good stuff!

Outstanding and super easy to make.  We served it as a salsa with chips and as a salsa for tacos and tostadas.  I switched no calorie sweetner for the sugar and you can't thell the difference.

Excellent Recipe.  Thanks for the post.

This tastes GREAT!!! I just made it tonight for an office party tomorrow.

Changes: Drained and rinsed the corn and beans in a colander; halved the sugar as others suggested;  added the juice from one lime; added one (1)  jalapeno pepper (chopped) from my garden; and 1/4 tsp sea salt.  Top-notch taste!!! 

This would probably be great with a little cilantro and more lime, too. This is a pretty versatile base for any number of delicious ideas. Next time, I might pan-fry the corn in butter to give it a yummy grilled flavor!

This was just what I was looking for! I loved it and so did my family. I will be serving this at my next party and I bet they will all love it too. The only thing I changed was I used white wine vinegar. It was super yummy!!

Huge hit!  Sceptical guests tried it and were hooked.  I substituted rice vinegar for rice wine vinegar and it was fine.  I also added cannelini beans for a bit more variety.

This is amazing! As others suggested I cut the sugar in half. I also popped the vinegar and sugar in the microwave for a few seconds to melt the sugar. My husband suggested adding something to make it kick but I liked it as is. I only used one can of corn so it wasn't overpowering. I wanted to add the cilantro as others suggested but when I went out to my garden to cut some it was already too late in the season. The night before I made a lime and cilantro rice for a side dish. For lunch the next day I put this salsa over the rice and heated. OMG!! It was delicious! What a great recipe you will be able to use a million ways. Loved loved loved it!

Came across this recipe today while searching for a side dish to take to a Memorial weekend BBQ later.  I had every ingredient on hand.  It literally was done in 10 minutes.  I used 1 can yellow corn and reduced sodium black beans drained.  In a small bowl, I mixed 1/8 cup sugar with 1/2 cup rice vinegar and popped it in the microwave for 20 seconds to get the sugar to blend before tossing into the mixture.  This is a tangy/sweet salsa that would go great on top of grilled chicken or fish.  This makes a pretty presentation.  What a gem.

In Montana this is Cowboy Caviar.  We do cut the sugar in half and add cilantro.  And whatever beans we can find in the pantry just to give it a mysterious quality.  We make bowls and bowls of it for the BBQs and never have any left over.

Wonderful! Absolutely perfect for a summer picnic or outdoor BBQ.  No mayo or dairy to spoil and it gets better the longer it sits.

Very good to tweak to your own taste and use up veggies from the garden, I even threw in one small squash chopped fine into the mix. No one will know but us. ;) I only added one tablespoon sugar and it really didn't need that.

This was really good but really mild salsa. I added some jalapenos for some extra spice and I also added some fresh squeezed lime juice and cilantro. All in all it was really tasty and great with tortilla chips or one tacos.

Great recipe with some small changes. 1/2 cup sugar was too much. It was much better w/ only 1/4 cup sugar. I also omitted the red pepper. Makes a fresh-tasting, sweet, and addictive salsa. Thanks!

My quests always love this.  I change it a bit to fit the main dish.  This weekend I doubled the recipe for 6 quests, i used a combo of white shoepeg and crisp yellow corn...( I'm a color nut ) added 3 finley chopped serranos, three colors of peppers, red, yellow and red....  and added about a half cup of chopped pineapple.  I served it with wild caught king and Silver Salmon with rice and slice3s of grilled pineapple.   Wonderful!!!

This was delicious.  Couldn't find rice wine vinegar so used rice vinegar, omitted the sugar but added lime juice - rave reviews all round.  I had to go make another bowlful as it was requested for lunch the next day.

This was GREAT!  Served it as a side salad and it was perfect.  I did drain and rinse both the corn & black beans so the colors would stay true.  Made it in the morning and served it that evening.  Very versatile as well, could easily be changed to be so many other salads.  Great salad/salsa.

i cut the sugar also (maybe 1 tbsp).  i used a shallot in place of the red onion, the ones in the store were too big.   i also substituted 3 roma tomatoes for the pepper (i don'l like peppers) added the juice of one lime and a clove of garlic. pretty good today and i can't wait to taste it tomorrow after reading all of these reviews!

I make this alot. I've played around with it and came up with... Adding cilantro, garlic & lime juice. Backing off on the sugar.  The rice vinegar gives it that... something unique that makes people talk about it.

I substituted thawed frozen corn for the canned and green pepper for the red. As written this was way too sweet. When I made it a second time I used half the sugar and it was much better.

Great recipe -- but addictive!  I used one can of sweet yellow corn and one cup of frozen white, and one-half red pepper, one-half green because we were preparing it for a Christmas appetizer and I wanted more color.  Also cut the sugar down to 1/4 of a cup as others suggested and it was plenty sweet enough.  We had a little left over the following day and I devoured it (flavors are even better after the sit for a while)!  Reviewed rave reviews from guests. Will definitely make this again and again.  Best served with "scoop" chips as there's not much holding it together.

I found that some rice vinegars are already sweetened, so this recipe turned out well with equal portions of vinegar and sugar. Adaptable to any season - just vary the color of the peppers - red and green for the holidays.

I took this to a family get together and one person from each branch asked for the recipe.  Luckily, it made a lot, as everyone wanted to keep some!  I used 1/4 C of sugar and added some chopped green chilis for spice.  Also, I didn't have rice wine vinegar, so I used white wine vinegar.  It was delicious!  Some of the weight-worried people ate it off of carrot chips (just the cut kind, not the fried) and it was great.

Yummy!  I added a few minced jalepeno slices to the batch to give it a little kick.  It is especially good with cilantro added.  Also, I didn't have rice vinegar so I used plain white vinegar and it worked great!  Just what I was looking for!

What the recipe lacks, imo, is cilantro and line juice. I traded the rice wine vinagar one for one with lime juice. I then chopped up a few stems of cilantro, about two tablesoons chopped and added it. It was wonderful.

This dish looks beautiful but lacks something.  I made this recipe twice.  The 1st time I made with the full amount of sugar.  The 2nd time I cut it in half.  Definately much better with 1/2 the sugar.  Ok flavor but not fantastic.  Will not make again.

This is absolutely delicious!  I halved the recipe to try for my husband and me and we both loved it.

I took one reviewer's advice and started out with only half of the sugar amount; I found that it was quite enough.

Will definitely make again and add other veggies - maybe celery, green and orange peppers, etc.

Thanks much!

I used 1/2 the sugar; it was too sweet otherwise.  Also, the Visalia Chop Wizard makes short work of dicing bell peppers and red onions; I got mine at Bed, Bath & Beyond.

Yep, just like everyone else said, I halved the sugar, used yellow canned corn and then forwarded the recipe to everyone at the party who all asked for it! My new favourite summer salsa!

Everyone I've ever made it for loves it as is!! What I love about this is that it's pretty simple. And EVERY TIME I take it anywhere people always comment on how good it is. I've had several people ask for the recipe. And I just wanted to come on and write my review! THANKS for the great crowd pleaser!

I thought this was fantastic! Followed as stated except 1/2 the sugar for personal taste. I ate it right out of the bowl with a spoon.  Great addition to my lunch.

This is such a good and simple recipe.  I use frozen roasted corn from Trader Joe's instead of canned corn.  It has a wonderfully smokey flavor.  I used a bit of splenda instead of sugar, added red pepper flakes and a bit of cumin.  So easy to throw together and serve with tortilla chips!!

I was really reluctant to try this salsa.  I had never tried a salsa like this but I am so glad I did.  This has become an instant favorite at my house.  I have to make it at least once a week to keep everyone happy.  Thank you so much for the recipe.

Made it exactly as the recipe stated with one exception--sugar, I cut mine down a little and figured I could add more later if needed. It was wonderful!  But it makes a VERY large batch, so beware.  But it would be perfect for a potluck or bbq.  Yummy!

What a nice refreshing dish this was.  I served it at a party last night and everyone really enjoyed it.  I did use only 1/4 cup of sugar, per other reviewers statements and used red wine vinegar, that's what I had on hand.  Will definitely make again, and again.

Couldn't be easier, very tasty. I made this with frozen corn and unfortunately did not have any red peppers on hand, and it was still delicious. I served it over pan seared tilipia, delicous!

Served this, as a side dish, at our neighborhood monthly potluck, and everyone loved it.  I used less sugar, as I find rice (wine) vinegars differ in the amount of sweetening they need.  I could not find white canned corn, so used a yellow sweet corn,which worked out fine.  I also added a splash of oil, and served it as a salad. Really good.

Loved this! Rice vinegar is a good substitute for rice WINE vinegar which I couldn't find at the grocery store. I held back on adding the sugar until the end and wound up using less than a quarter cup. Also added some black pepper for kick. Next time, I will also drain corn and beans through collander into a bowl and reduce the can juices so result doesn't have so much liquid. Otherwise, great! Really tasty.

I have been making a recipe like this for a while - always to rave reviews! I use regular yellow whole kernel corn (frozen or canned), skip the sugar and red pepper, and add avocado at the last minute before serving (to keep green).  Garlic salt and cumin seasoning to taste.  One of my favorite recipes for parties but also delicious with grilled chicken as a meal!

This makes a quick and easy summer lunch! (And it's delicious too!)  
We followed everything, the only thing that we did a little different was that we used half raw sugar and half regular white sugar. (It was the same amount of sugar in the end though)

I made this for an event with a group of friends and almost everyone loved it...my boyfriend wasn't a fan, but he was the only one! I used frozen sweet corn, used regular rice vinegar and added avocado and it was great!  I am known for my salsa, but I thought this was a nice change, very sweet, but delicious!

This salsa was a big hit at an outside summer picnic setting.  I also followed the suggestions to use half the sugar and add cilantro.  All I had was rice vinegar too (not rice wine vineger), and it seemed to work just fine.  Different but very good.  Thanks!

I too added cilantro, used half the sugar and a whole, medium onion.  I thought it was really good, but think it would be even better with a little habanero pepper (or something) to add a little constrast to the sweet.  I will definitely make it again, probably trying some with, some without spicy peppers.  Oh yeah, I used frozen corn too, as I prefer the taste.
