Thanks to all of the previous reviewers that noted the amount of Old Bay was too much. Because of the advice, I reduced it to suit the quantity of cakes I made. I used unseasoned Panko bread crumbs also. I most certainly didn't bake these, it's enough that I'm eating zucchini in the first place! I pan fried 'em in olive oil & served with a homemade remoulade. Smaller, these would be terrific appetizers so that's what I'll do when I make them again. Keeper:o)

5 stars after second batch made with 1/2 teaspoon Old Bay. 1 tablespoon of Old Bay made the dish very salty.

I LOVED the recipe for "Connie's Zucchini 'Crab' Cakes" (from this site), so I thought I'd try this. These didn't even compare- My advise is try the other recipe. The only plus is these are baked and not fried, so they must be healtier; then again, maybe that's why the other recipe tastes so much better. ;)

I have always followed the receipe on the box of Old Bay Crab Cakes with the variation of worchestershire Sauce as much as the mayo you put in the cake.  Then when you fry it keep it think so you can brown quickly.  Taste like a vegitarian crab cake!

I thought this was an excellent cake...my company really liked it. I added more chocolate chips on top and didn't bother with a frosting. I'll make this again.

I made this recipe with half Italian bread crumbs, and half crumbled reduced sodium crackers. I also used a cajun mustard to add a bit more kick. I didn't have Old Bay, so I made my own mixture of seasoning, including Tony Chachere's Spine N' Herbs. It wasn't too salty at all, and had an excellent texture. Will definetly make again, with my own twist of course!

Pretty good!! I followed directions and baked them in toaster oven. But I think they would be even better fried, altho less healthy. Served w/ fat free sour cream. Good recipe.

I made this AFTER reading the other reviews, so I decided to use UNseasoned breadcrumbs and half the amount of Old Bay. The cakes still came out too salty, and they seemed to be lacking something (perhaps...crabmeat?). My hubby liked them -- he said they tasted like stuffing. Maybe I'll put this recipe away until Thanksgivingtime...

I couldn't find Old Bay seasoning and used other, similar seasoning instead.  Perhaps this is why the cakes came out VERY salty.  Otherwise, would have been good.

Tasty.  Not what I expected, but good none-the-less.  The measurement for old bay seasoning is a bit high.  I didn't feel right putting a whole Tbsp in, so I only put 3/4 Tbsp in and even that was a little too potent.  Cocktail sauce helped mute the saltiness.  I served this with Nell' Cabbage Salad (also from this site) and the combination was good.  I like the concept of using zucchini for the cakes, and will definitely try variations of this recipe.  Thank you for sharing.

I baked these the first time I made them so I didn't feel guilty about eating it, but it lacked taste.  The 2nd time I made this I panned fried it.  Soooo worth the guilt!  Be sure to squeeze the moisture out of the zucchini before frying.  I had to "dry" mine out in the oven for a few extra minutes.

I made this 'as-is' and then noticed that my bread crumbs were plain.  It turned out good, but could have been better had I not made the mistake.

I will make this many more times in the future.

They were pretty good, just remember to cook them for awhile or they will have raw Zucchini in the middle.

I had resevations about this recipe. I grew up on the East Coast eating Mayland Crab cakes. I live on the West Coast and it's hard to find a good crab cake. I really thought my family wouldn't eat this but apparently, I didn't make enough. They wanted seconds... It is a great alternative to using crab meat. Thanx

These were fantastic, and great for parties. For a spicy change up, skip the Old Bay. Sub in chili powder and a couple hard shakes of Tabasco.

I made these today with fresh zucchini from my garden. I used a different brand like Old Bay that I brought back from NC. I added onions and bell peppers and thought the texture was nice but like the other reviews said "Way to Salty".  I will make these again but add my own seasonings.

I didn't have Old Bay, so I just seasoned with salt, pepper, garlic, and honey mustard. I enjoyed the cakes very much - nothing fancy, but tasty.

I followed the directions exactly. I did allow the zucchini to drain after shredding them.  That may be why mine came out a little dry. I love the OLD Bay Seasoning flavor but agree with many other reviewers that the result is too salty. I would adjust this recipe by using only a teaspoon of OLD Bay.  Or, I'll try another recipe. This one was easy enough as this only takes a few minutes to prepare.

I only gave it four stars for the simple reason is the salitiness w/ the seasoning added and I only added about a tsp.  I would suggest a half as you can always spinkle salt on the cakes after they are cooked, when you can actually taste them.

I loved this recipe!!  Them came out with perfect consistancy.  I didn't use the Old Bay I just used seasonings that I preferred.  Plan on making these often.

My husband and I weren't impressed this how this turned out.  It looked good, although it was rather bland and not super tasty.  The mustard was a little overpowering too.

Taste = 5 stars. Texture = 3 stars. Mine came out runny but tasted amazing. I'm guessing it's because the zucchini has a lot of water naturally but I drained most of it (or so I thought) before mixing it in. I almost added some flour but wasn't sure. I may try that next time if it's runny again.

These would have turned out perfect if the Old Bay seasoning was reduced. I would go 1/4 of what is called for. They were waayyy too salty.

I made these but changed just a couple things. I reduced the Old Bay to 1 tsp due to previous reviews. Next time I will only use 1/2 tsp. They were a little salty. Also, I pan fried them in olive oil. I served them with a homemade roumalade. They were yummy!

I made these last night and I thought they were very good.  I also noted that the old bay needed to be just a tad less.    I bet they would be good also with poultry seasoning instead of old bay.

I was looking forward to trying this recipe, the Old Bay sounded interesting in this.  I live in Maryland where we use Old Bay alot in our Chesapeake Bay seafood dishes.  I followed the recipe exactly except cut the amount of Old Bay in half.  They were very dry and almost rubbery.  Even cutting the Old Bay by half the flavor was overwhelming.  In my opion the flavor of Old Bay did not lend itself well to zucchini at all.  This is not a keeper in my kitchen.

I gave this recipe 4 stars, I think it would have been great if not for the over powering old bay. I will make them again but will cut the old bay to about 1 tsp.

These were good. I added a little more Old Bay - we love it here in Maryland! I fried them up and they were a hit! I have done this twice so far this summer and plan on making it this winter using some frozen shredded zucchini.

I didn't use Old Bay (don't have any) so instead I used a shake of Jamaica Mistake seasoned pepper and fresh breadcrumbs. I was worried that these would be soggy so I planned to bake them a little longer, but they were golden and crispy on the outside after 40 mins. in the oven. We like them and they are a great new way to use up all the summer's zucchini! I'll make these again for sure!

Not really what I had in mind when I pulled this recipe.  The ingredients are great but the texture of the final product was not what I expected.  I will be making these again but pan frying in olive oil.  It adds calories but oh well.

These are ok. Not great. The good is that they are backed instead of fried but they are bit chewy. Will try to cut back on bread crumbs or maybe try Pablo. Also I suggest adding Parmesan to the mix

Changed the spice, since I didn't have Old Bay Seasoning on hand.   The flavor was ok, but I didn't like the  very soft interior of the cakes.  Not bad, when first removed from the oven, however when reheating, didn't care for them at all.  Will not make them again and will use another of your recipes.

These were very easy and tasty. Wish I would have read reviews about the amount of Old Bay before making them. I served them with alfredo sauce (which was part of our meal) and that calmed them down a bit. Baking was fine. Next time - less  Old Bay. ;).

Made these for dinner tonight, serving with homemade coleslaw, sliced tomatoes and black olives. I found that frying them in some olive oil in a non stick skillet worked best instead of the oven,  I tried the oven for the first 20 min but the cakes started falling apart. Didn't have Old Bay, so used some homemade Emeril's Essence ( recipe found on foodnetwork ) instead and they turned out tasty

Modified slightly based upon ingredients on hand: unseasoned bread crumbs, less Old Bay, Dijon vs. regular mustard, add parsley and onions.  I also pan fried versus baked.  Modified recipe follows:

2 cups shredded zucchini, 1 cup UNSEASONED bread crumbs, 1 egg, 1 T. mayo, 1 tsp. Dijon mustard, 3/4 T. Old Bay Seasoning, 2 T. onions, 1 tsp. parsley or fresh parsley

Squeeze dry zucchini. Mix egg, onion, mayo, OLD Bay, mustard, and parsley in bowl. Add zucchini, bread crumbs, mix well.  Shape into 8 patties, 1/4 c. each.
Heat 1 T. oil in a large nonstick skillet on medium.  Add 4 crab cakes.  Cook 3 mins. per side or until golden brown.  Drain on paper towels. Repeat with remaining patties, add oil as needed.

Honestly, I've never used Old Bay seasoning, so I seasoned them with garlic salt, pepper, dill, and a little basil and oregano (since I used panko instead of Italian seasoned bread crumbs.) I thought the texture and flavor was great and even my 10-month old son ate up a few of them. May try these in leiu of potato pancakes with pierogi.

This was really good when eaten hot, not so much once it cooled. I did not use the Old Bay instead used Webers garlic and herbs. I think I might have used to much bread crumbs and will cut back on that next time and there will be a next time. Note to others be sure to squeeze as much liquid as possible from the zucchini (I used a clean kitchen towel).

Didn't really work for us.  To much cake and not enough zucchini.  We didn't like the texture.  We also used fresh bread crumbs and had to use twice as many b/c it was way too soggy.  Might try it again.

I really didn't like these at all.  It's might just be me, but I like Zucchini and these just didn't taste good.
