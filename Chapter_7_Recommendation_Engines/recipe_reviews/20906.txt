This is our all time family favorite.  It is easy, and always delicious. We usually add extra banana.

This cake recipe was published in the news paper in the late 60s as the cake that would not last.  Doctor Bird Cake was known for disappearing quickly as everyone loves this cake.  Quick and easy this scratch cake became a standby answer to "What do I do with these over ripe bananas?"  Keeping a couple cans of pineapple in the pantry, you are always ready to solve this problem deliciously.  Even those who don't usually care for cake love this one.  My adult kids (30 and 35 yr old) ate this their entire lives and still ask for it.

"Awesome cake!" says hubby & kids. I've been baking 30+ yrs. and was delighted to find this recipe for a lighter version of traditional, heavy, oily banana-nut loaf. The pineapple (AND juice) is the secret ingredient here! I baked in 2 square pans and decreased time by 1/2 hr. to achieve thinner, cake-like crusting. Thanks for this recipe!

I loved this cake.  The pineapple was a great addition.  It was so moist and easy.  The only thing that I would watch is the time.  Mine cooked in only 1 hour in my bundt pan and was perfect.  Thanks for this one.

This is one of my favorite recipes but I definitely would cut back on the cooking time to 1 hr and recommend topping it.  My preference is a glaze made from 3 T pineapple juice and powdered sugar.  You can also just dust is with powdered sugar after it has cooled.

I was looking for a moist banana cake and this one really fit the bill. I agree with another reviewer about the time necessary to bake it. I used a bundt pan and removed it from the oven after an hour. It is perfect. No need to frost or glaze this.

This is an all-time favorite of my family for at least 30 years.  It is moist and stays that way
until it's gone.  I prefer the tube pan.  It makes a beautiful cake, doesn't require icing and the plate is scraped clean.

After all the great reviews I expected a great cake.  Unfortunately mine came out really dry and boring.  All you could taste were bananas even though I put in powdered ginger and allspice too.  I even tried to doll it up with frosting (cream cheese frosting) and still didn't like it that much.

Found it very bland while it was warm but it tasted quite good later when cold.  Probably will make it again and serve it the next day.

I intentionally subbed vegetable oil for the corn oil, and unintentionally left  out the eggs ... Can't say I missed them, but will try with them too to see the difference. The cake was amazing, moist and the blend of banana and pineapple surprisingly good.

04-09-16 ~ I made this as written, but used fresh pineapple rather than canned. This took 85 minutes in my Bundt pan as this is a very dense cake. We enjoyed the moist, flavorful cake, but enjoyed it best sliced and toasted. Very much like a banana bread made in a cake pan. Great recipe to use up older bananas and fresh pineapple that is getting to be overripe.

My family has been using this recipe for 3 generations. My great- grandmother made it for my grandmother, who made it for my mom, aunt, and uncles. She handed it down to me and it's delicious.
