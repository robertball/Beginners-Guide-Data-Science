This recipe is fantastic!  Easy to make and delicious.  It's a nice spin on regular salsa chili (using ground chicken and adding the quinoa).  I added a bit more salsa because I wanted to finish up the jar.  Finely chopped the zucchini so I could "sneak" it in.   Thanks for sharing this yummy (can be one pot) meal.

My favorite part about this meal is that it looks the same going in as it does going out.

This is a pretty good recipe. I made a few changes. I added 1/2 onion, about a 1/4 tsp. of cumin, salt to taste and cilantro as a garnish.

Didn't have zucchini or corn, substituted mixed vegetables. I also doubled the chicken and added cream of chicken soup. My 3 kids who can be very picky LOVED it!!

I tried this recipe with all the ingredients except the corn.  I did add sea salt as well and it turned out very well!  My husband who is ultra picky actually said it was good and he never says that!  Two thumbs up!

This is a very quick and easy weeknight dinner idea. Not much prep, using all things I had lying around. A very forgiving recipe... I browned my meat with minced fresh garlic and chopped onion. I sprinkled on spices as the meat browned (cumin, salt, pepper, oregano, paprika, a bit of chili powder). I had leftover sautéed zucchini so I left the cooked meat in the pan, tossed in the can of tomato, zucchini, defrosted frozen corn and beans. I was out of salsa so skipped it. The quinoa was all cooked in time for me to toss it in. Whole thing took only 30 min or less. I served cheese on the side as well as sliced avocodo and some canned chilis and my family dressed their bowls how they preferred.

This recipe turned out great. My husband loved it. He is a rice fan and not a big quinoa fan but he really liked the flavor of this recipe. I will make it again for sure.

Quick and easy recipe that is husband approved!  I used hot salsa to give it some extra kick and regular cheese since that is what I had on hand.

This is delicious! My whole family loves it!  I doubled the recipe except I still only used one can of black beans and one can of corn to decrease the carbs a bit and wow, a new love! Bring on the protein!

This can easily be vegetarian by using vegetable stock, increasing the quinoa and zucchini.  Delicious!

Spicy Chicken Quinoa Haiku: "Fairly tasty meal. I made it ahead of time, baked it for dinner." I prepared this ahead in a roundey casserole dish, only omitting corn. Sprinkled the cheese on top and baked 350 for 20-25 min. b4 serving w/ cilantro on top; however, we found that it desperately needed even more added for flavor at that point; more salsa, salt, cheese, Sriracha. I love the combination of black beans, zucchini, and quinoa, but I think making it again, I would really go strong on spices; cumin, taco seasoning etc ..

Thought that four servings wouldn't be enough so doubled the recipe; it made a TON! Great tasting food, very easy to prepare. Avoid canned chicken if possible it tastes different

I enjoyed this quick and easy recipe. Instead of a can of diced tomatoes, I diced a whole tomato and 1/2 an Anaheim pepper. I also added an onion and doubled the quinoa.

I followed this recipe exactly. When I finished, I ended up keeping it on low and making a double amount of quinoa afterwards as I couldn't tell there was any in it. It tasted like  just a seasoned plate of ground beef. Next time I would do 1.5 cups of quinoa, add some sautéed onions, more seasonings and possibly an additional vegetable or more of the ones already in it. The recipe as is could be served with tortillas as tacos.

Didn't know what to expect, but everyone loved this one! I didn't have salsa, but I did include a little extra tomato and chicken broth. :)

omitted salsa.  Kids enjoyed it.  I could have used some more spice to it.
