The coffee flavor is very subtle which is fine with me.  I used soy milk, coffee ice cubes instead of regular ice cubes and I substituted 2 packets of Truvia for the simple syrup. Instead of pouring into 2 glasses, I poured it into 1 tall glass and drank it all myself! 05-02-19 Update: I made this again today but as a hot coffee drink. Just as delicious!

I really like this! I use Stumptown Cold Brew Coffee, and omit the simple syrup. I use very ripe bananas and don't need any extra sweetness. I've tried this with soymilk, coconut milk, and almond milk- all of which were great! Just make sure to blend the banana for enough time so you don't get any lumps  :)

This was okay, but I think I would prefer using a frozen banana and blending it all together. I used coffee ice cubes so that the drink wouldn't get watered down. I was looking for something not to sweet, so I didn't add the syrup. Thanks for the interesting change to my cold coffee.

I've been treating myself to a banana/milk/coffee treat the past three weekends. This past weekend was inspired by the aztecs...cinnamon chili chocolate milk post workout replenishment in a cup. Thank you so much for sharing the yumminess! Soon, hazelnut liquor will be added into my weekend fix. Who would have thought!

I usually use 1 banana, 1/2 cups almond milk, 1/2 cups hot coffee and 2 tbsp ground oats. Do recommend!

I had 2 bananas and 1 TBL  sugar and almond milk.  Enough for one person. It was fine but I wouldn't make it again.

I had this with vanilla flavored soy milk and it turned out great! It tastes just like I thought it would, I agree that the coffee taste is subtle but I didn't mind it at all. I left out the syrup and it was still sweet so it didn't need it in my opinion.
