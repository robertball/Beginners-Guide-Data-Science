I was pleasantly surprised with this one. I've only had alligator in restaurants, so naturally I was hesitant about making it at home, but I'm glad I did.

The taste, in general, is fantastic, but there are two minor glitches--one is that by cooking the garlic in the oil first, it tends to burn before the alligator is cooked all the way through if you have larger pieces. 

Also, the sauce made from deglazing the pan with the white wine is fabulous, but there's hardly any of it left. It is likely the perfect amount for a light dinner for two, to feed a hungry family of three, there just wasn't enough to go around--and let me assure you there should have been because it's delicious soaked into the rice once the alligator is all gone!

Thanks for this one, I'll definitely make it again next time I wind up with alligator meat!

I didn't have lime juice or white wine, so I marinated my gator in orange juice. I added about 1/2c OJ and 1c red wine to make my sauce. Gator was tender and I served it over rice. It was A to the awesome! Word of advice, the original recipe won't make enough sauce and even my adjustments left me a little short so don't be afraid to go big on adding wine, juice, etc for your sauce.

I will not be making this again. There wasnt a sauce made after the alligator was done cooking. I personally did not like the flour coating on the meat. Yuck!

Fantastic. Delicious. Admittedly I've never had alligator before so I don't have much of a baseline.

The recipe says to simmer the wine until it thickens, but I found there was no oil or flour left, so I just simmered it for a brief few seconds.

We served over Jasmine rice, with slices of tomato and mozzarella cheese.
