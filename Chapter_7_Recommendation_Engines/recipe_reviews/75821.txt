Great tasting burgers.  First time we made these they were a bit crumbly on the pitt.  The 2nd time however, we added an egg to the meat mixture and they came out perfectly shaped and stayed together. No crumbly pieces. We'll be making these again.

Love the idea... I seen that there were some rewiews that said that the burger fell apart during cooking so I added egg... But this didn't help. As I said great idea but it didn't work for me. :)

I recently tried chorizo and fell in love with it and coudn't wait to try this recipe.  Unfortunately, the grocers must be conspiring against me, as not one of them sold chorizo this week, so I made this with Hot Italian Sausage.  It was wonderful, the sauce fabulous and versatile (I am already thinking of other things to use the sauce on) Everyone liked.  Thanks!

Yum - I omitted the ranch dressing (not my thing, but I kept the rest of the pepper mixture...makes a nice dressing) and substituted ground chuck since Sirloin is a bit to lean to make juicy burgers, but this was delish!

Followed the recipe minus the saffron and manchego cheese. Couldn't find them in two local grocery stores. In place, used a dash of caynenne pepper, and 1/4 slice of gouda cheese. Used mini-wheat buns, buttered and toasted in the oven at 350. Definitely too much sauce, but tasted so yummy, would go great with fries!

The differences between Spanish and Mexican chorizo should be noted as their forms are entirely different.  Spanish chorizo is cured sausage with a smoky flavor.  This pork is chopped not ground.  Mexican chorizo is ground and uncooked.  It is not very solid.   A burger with Mexican chorizo needs more beef or they will likely fall apart.

This was pretty good.  I did half the recipe for the sauce and still had extra.  I wasnt sure if this was mexican chorizo, but it was what I had so I used it.  I also did not like the brown sugar with the onions, it was way to sweet for me.  Next time I would leave the brown sugar out.  Thanks for sharing the recipe!  I will make it again with a few changes.

Really flavorful, a great dish to get out of the normal dinner rut. The only changes we made to the recipe was we added an egg to the beef and chorizo mixture (reviewer suggestion) and I didn't have saffron for the sauce but it was still good and we grilled the burgers for 30mins (maybe too long) because I was worried that the chorizo wasn't cooked enough but it was still moist and delicious. Make this for dinner tonight!

Great alternative to the basic burger.  I followed the advice of the reviews and added an egg!  They were great.  I used a mild chorizo to keep it kid friendly.  My kids loved them!  We used Hawaiian Bread Buns.

This didn't win us over. I was looking forward to this being amazing. I personally think that there was just to much going on with this to make it a good burger. If this were a meatloaf it would have been wonderful.

I liked the burger.. quite tasty. I used ground turkey breast and soyrizo and added some diced onions to keep it moist with a bit of egg to bind.  I didn't care for the sauce on top so the next time I had this, i added some sour cream to the sauce. I liked it then,

If you use a grill, it better be very hot. A grill too for that matter, chorizo falls apart very easily. Soo yum though, I don't use ranch sauce. I personally, prefer it spicy as is. I use a garlic aioli as a condiment.

This was good. If we make again, we will cut the amount of paprika in the sauce in half - it was way too paprika-y for us. The burgers themselves were delicious - I took the advice of another reviewer and added an egg to the meat mixture. It was very flavorful but not too spicy for our 4- and 2- year old children.

Tried this with red onions and a traditional mexican blanco cheese ...Wow what a burger!!  Also as I could not find Saffron I used Saffron flower as an alternative, was not sure if I liked the burger or the sauce better :)

I suggest people  buy a premium high quality Chorizo. If you buy the cheap tubes, its not going to have the thickness you need for it to stick together. Here in Texas the Kiolbassa brand, HEB roll Chorizo, Johnsonville or Dos Mamacitas Veal Chorizo works very well.

The only thing I didn't use was the manchego and we used normal buns. Good recipe!

The patties completely fell apart when we tried to turn them after 4 min on the grill. I threw it all in a frying pan with the Ranch dressing sauce and we ended up with a sort of Sloppy Jose.  My husband actually really liked them but I gave it just one star because it was inedible as a burger.

I had no problem with these on the grill. Maybe it varies on the brand of beef/chorizo or how tight the patties are packed. The sauce does make far more than needed for the burgers but it's great on other stuff too. I used the extra on grilled cheese sandwiches and it was delicious. Overall, I loved these and it was really nice to have something different than the plain old hamburgers we usually have.

I only used 10 oz of Chorizo and the burgers were still too greasy and crumbly. The sauce is excellent and I will make this again with just plain hamburger.

Added the egg, burgers held together well. Taste is always great. Have made them several times over the summer using commercial beef or pork chorizo. Did this recipe for a neighborhood grill party - now everyone makes them. Holding together may vary with the chorizo - add the egg just to be sure. Will make again and an outstanding special burger to serve guests at a grill party, etc.

These burgers we absolutely delicious.  I had purchased some soy chorizo from Trader Joe's and needed a recipe to use it.  This was it! I only made a couple of changes to the recipe.  Chorizo itself is not the healthiest, so I used soy chorizo (12 oz.) mixed with 2.5 lbs 90/10 ground sirloin.  Also, I used light ranch dressing for the aioli and omitted the saffron (expensive!), but added some cumin.  I used onion buns and all was delicious!  Even my super-picky 3 year old ate his burger up (minus carmalized onions).  Oh, and I have to add that the brown sugar in the carmelized onions with the smoky burgers was delish!  YUMMY!

The burgers turned out a little dry for me. (Used George Foreman Grill)  Next time I am going to add some sauteed onion to the meat mix (husbands suggestion) and some type of sauce to give it some moisture.  Also there was way too much sauce, it was very good though.  Also used cheddar and added lettuce and tomato.  Will definitley try again and recommend.

Burgers are very flavorful, but the recipe makes a lot of sauce.  I will use only about half the recipe next time as I have so much left over.  Still, the many steps are worth it, as the burgers are yummy.

I found the sausage made the hamburger taste too fatty. Would have preferred the sausage sliced and grilled then added to the burger as a garnish. The pepper ranch dressing however was very good. I would use it again for burgers.

I've made this recipe multiple times with out the need of an egg with great results. Tip, all chorizo is not the same. You need Mexican style chorizo it's got more fat and it's moist like ground beef. Salvadoran style chorizo (super dark and dry) will not work even with an egg.

The only thing that seemed unnecessary was adding the brown sugar to the onions.  The red pepper sauce was excellent, but made a lot. We loved it so much we have enough to use on other things!

Delicious.  A bit crumbly, should have added an egg as the other reviewers suggested.

These burgers are amazing!!! They completely fall apart but it is worth making a mess. I made them ahead of time and froze them the second time I made them and that seemed to help them stay together better. Thanks for the great recipe :)

Very good!  Lots of steps, but well, well worth it!  My picky 3 kids ate it all up!  Could not find saffron or cheese, but used sharp cheddar as another reviewer suggested.  Also used ground round as beef.

Ok, I made a couple of changes: I didn't have any saffron, and wasn't going to buy it just for this recipe. I used regular paprika, and I used Swiss cheese as that's what I had on hand. I also just did the burgers on the Foreman grill. They were absolutely delicious, and the sauce was especially fantastic. Thanks for an awesome recipe, BurgerBelly!

the chorizo did make the burgers a bit too heavy for my taste.  perhaps i would make a homemade chorizo next time.  also, it was hard to mix the two.  maybe one would need a food processor to really mix it.  as for the sauce, it was good, there was just too much of it.  next time i would omit the pureed onions and instead of a cup( i used a half and it was still too much) just use a couple table spoons.  the carmelized onions were awesome, but they too were too much.  next time i'd probably just use one or two instead of three.  for me, the highlight of the whole burger was the carmelized onions.  it will be a staple on all my burgers!

These were great! I followed the recipe exactly and my husband loved them. I used 96% lean hereford sirloin and the burgers were not to greasy and not to dry. This will be a regular at our hous. The red pepper sauce is good used as a dip too.

Don't be afraid of the spicy chorizo - the burgers aren't!  I was skeptical about the whole recipe, but wanted to try something new, so I went for it and was pleasantly suprized.  And the onions sauteed with brown sugar, mmm!  I couldn't find the cheese, so just used sharp cheddar (not sure if it's even close, but an old stand-by for burgers at our house) and can't complain.  Even my picky husband liked them, AND the sauce!!!

This was so good.  I used half the chorizo than what was called for.  My mistake was not making sure the patties were larger than the buns before cooking.  That part is important.  The sauce was the best part!
