Made this at 9 pm. Had it finished and baking in 6 minutes. Easy to make. I had to substitute creamy peanut butter with crunchy, partly because I didn't have creamy and partly because creamy peanut butter is an abomination. I sprinkled a little sugar on top before baking. Not the best cookie I've ever had, but the easiest, quickest, and most readily available.

This was absolutely delicious!! I would 100% make it again!! It’s super awesome to bring to someone’s house or have a party or something like that!! Just one helpful tip, when the batter is done, it looks super gooey and gross, but when you cook it (you don’t need to cook for long), it turns out amazing!! I fed it to my entire family and they absolutely loved them!! Definitely making this again!!!

Super easy, super delicious!  My only complaint is that I got 17 cookies, not 24, even though mine weren’t very big.

Im a guy that burns stuff all the time. Just kidding i can cook. Just never been a good baker of sweets. I had very good luck on my first attempt. Good recipe. I just made big monster cookies instead of trying to get 24 of them, i got 6.

I enjoyed making this simple dish, however I preferred eating the dough more :) I will remember this recipe going forward.
