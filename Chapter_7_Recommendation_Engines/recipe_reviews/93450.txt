After spending the day trying various pumpkin seed recipes (6 total), this is by far the best!  I was leary of this recipe being too "hot" for my children, but No!  They love it!  Even more so than the cinnamon and sugar recipes.  It's not too salty, and not too sweet.  I used basic Tabasco Sauce.  (Would add more dashes of sauce for adults.)  Outstanding!

Yummy!!  I am usually a bit hesitant to try a recipe that doesn't have a number of reviews but I went out on a limb on this one. It was well worth it.  These are really good.  I used more than a couple drops of hot sauce (more like a few dashes) and was afraid it was going to be too much.  Nope, just right.  Perfect balance between sweet and salty with a little bit of heat.  Also, I let them cook closer to an hour and moved them around on the pan every 15 minute or so. Made just about 2 cups (2 pumpkins worth) last night and between my bf and I I'll bet they'll be gone by tonight.  Now, if I can just come up with a reson to buy more pumpkins....

These are addicting.  I added extra hot sauce for some more kick, and they are still pretty mild.  Next time I think I will increase the sugar just a bit, as they aren't very sweet.  I was hesitant about the worchestshire, but it added a nice depth of flavor.  Good recipe!

AS AN ADDITIONAL NOTE TO THE REVIEW BELOW: One of the things that really made the difference with these, I believe, was letting the seeds dry out completely before baking them.  I rinsed and put them on a paper-towel lined baking sheet overnight.  Also, my husband just tried these, and he says that there was no possible way I could have made these any better.  He says he'll be growing more pie-pumpkins for me next year, just so he can get the seeds!  These are *that* good!

Oh, wow, I've been making different varieties of roasted pumpkin seeds for years, and after just taking these out of the oven and being unable to stop eating them, this recipe is going straight into my autumn recipe file!!  I couldn't believe how good these were!  The only changes I made weren't that significant--I used Smart Balance Light instead of butter to cut the calories a little, used a tad extra brown sugar and replaced the hot sauce with a good dash of cayenne pepper (didn't have a spicy enough hot sauce that I liked on-hand).  I also baked these for only 35 minutes, stirring every 10 minutes or so, to make sure they didn't stick to the cookie-sheet and burn.  I can't wait to serve these at our annual pumpkin-carving party--I know they're be a hit.  Thanks for the yummy and super-easy recipe!!

This smells wonderful when cooking.  Just the right balance of sweet and salty.  I guess I am a novice to pumpkin seeds, I didn't realize that you eat the shell.

SO GOOD!  Will make these every year now that I tried them.  I, also, added a little extra tabasco because I wanted my other half to like them.  He stated that HE DOES NOT LIKE PUMPKIN SEEDS to me before I made them.  I was determined to prove him wrong.  I won!

I wish there were more stars that I could give these seeds!  I have been eating pumpkin seeds every year all my life.  I decided to see if there was something different I could do for a special treat for the boys and decided on this one.  Am I glad I did.  I went by the recipe exactly.  They reminded me somewhat of kettle corn, with a little spice (but not too much for the kids).  All the kids and hubby really loved them.  Next year we'll have to save more seeds. Thank you Lotus!

Really yummy! My only complaint is that they were really wet so I had to cook them almost twice as long but the taste was fantastic :)

Very tasty. Letting them dry overnight is very helpful- also stir them every 10-15 minutes prevents them from burning. (1 good stir every 15 minutes 3 times did the trick for me)

I really liked your recipe.  My father-in-law thought the seeds were wonderful.  He usually buys the bags of store bought seeds these are much better.  I enjoyed them much better than the ones i usually make with season salt.  This recipe is a keeper.  Thank you

HUGE HIT!  We ate them by the fist fulls.  Then we sprinkled them on our sqaush soup on Thanksgiving and everyone raved.  Great recipe.

Yummy!!  Another great recipe for using up all of those seeds from the inside of your pumpkins!!  I loved the 'sweet heat'...added much more hot sauce and thought these were fantastic!

Loved it!! Made a batch for my husband because of the hearty ingredients. (he never liked pumpkin seeds. ever). Am surprised it was a bigger hit with everyone, kids included, than the old fashioned sugar,salt & cinnamon seeds!!

I made two batches.  First was exactly as described.  They were really good but not much "Spicy".  I used Franks Hot Sauce.  Second batch I added a teaspoon of hot sauce.  I think it was the perfect balance.  I will make these again for sure.

With a heavier splash of Texas Pete, and less butter next time (these were a tad too slippery for my taste), these would be a 5. I typically go for nearly-naked pumpkin seeds, roasted w/ a little salt & EVOO, so this recipe reminded me of, well, Bold & Zesty Chex Mix, w/ its savory sweet spice. My husband says, while munching away on these, "Carve more pumpkins so you can roast more of these seeds!" And to that I say, HE can carve the pumpkins and I'll kick back and eat some Halloween candy.

These seeds tasted good, but the sweet comes out a lot more than than the spicy does.  Next time I will either add more spice or a more potent version of spice.

I upped the "spicy" part by adding a good squeeze of sriracha sauce, and Can't. Stop. Eating. These.  They're awesome, and about a million times better than any store-bought pumpkin seeds.

These are good, but not quite what I was expecting. I would use a little molasses or more brown sugar to make them sweeter. Also, I added way more hot sauce than called for (using Texas Pete) and it still didn't have much kick. If I do this again, I'll use less salt and Worcestershire sauce.

Needed more sweetness, bland. . Dry. . 45 min at 300 may be a big too much cooking time. They were bland and I only used one cup seeds with same amount of seasoning. .

These were awesome!  I added some extra heat by using cayenne pepper along with the hot sauce.  Delicious, thank you for sharing.

Just okay.  I had issues with the seeds starting to burn, I guess from the brown sugar.  I thought they were more sweet than spicy, I would have preferred more spice than sweet.  Tasted 4 star out of the oven still hot but even kids commented that once cooled they were only so-so.

These were easy to make and I could see how they would be super yummy. . .but I should have taken them out after 30 minutes because now they're slightly burned.  I'd recommend keeping a close eye on them while cooking, stirring every once in a while.  Then when you notice the sugar caramelizing on your spoon, go ahead and pull them out then let them sit until cooled and crunchy.

Just pulled these out of the oven! I did the recipe as is but only half the seeds as I am using the pie pumpkin seeds and don't have as many. Also only did at 275 F and half the time as there are less seeds and they are smaller. But WOW they are good! Was hesitant to bother as I've never liked the traditional plain old salt recipe from when I was a kid. But I could eat them all before my husband even gets home from work! YUM!

Wow!!!  I have never been a big fan of pumpkin seeds, but this recipe has changed my mind forever!  It caught my attention because my husband loves spicy things.  This was also one of the easier recipes and it only takes 45 minutes!  I think I am going to have to come up with more ways to use pumpkins because we will be having this again!  By the way, I don't know what kind of hot sauce other people have been using, but we used my husband's "Z nothing beyond Extremely Hot Sauce" and 2 drops was just enough!  Any more and I probly wouldn't be able to feel my lips!  I also liked the suggestion to mix the sauce and then test taste it before adding the pumpkin seeds.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

What I did differently: melted the butter and added everything BEFORE coating the seeds, so I could taste the mixture first. I used light brown sugar but after taste-testing, decided to add a bit of white sugar too. Added more hot sauce (probably about 10 "drops"). I also boiled the seeds first in salted water for 10 minutes, per another reviewer's suggestion. I made some with this coating and some without. Didn't "wow" me on the first taste, but I found myself going back for handful after handful till I noticed they were gone! Next time will try dark brown sugar and definitely more hot sauce. These weren't really spicy at all, even with the extra hot sauce. And boiling the seeds first didn't affect the quality at all, definitely recommend that.

This was "ok" mine did come out burnt before it was time to come out. I should not have added a dash of liquid smoke to it. I may try again next year.

These are great! We made a very large batch and brought it to a potluck.  People were munching them before things were set up.  We doubled the sauce recipe for more flavor.  One caution:  They are addicting!!!

These were good and I'd make them again but even with 6 dashes of hot sauce they barely had any heat to them.  So if you want spicy, you need to add more hot sauce for sure!

A few pointers:  1. Do use more than two dashes of hot sauce. 6 will give it some nice flavor.  2. Make sure, especially if you're baking on aluminum foil, to spray with non-stick spray so the seeds don't get stuck and peel off with little bits of aluminum attached.  3. Make sure to spread the seeds out evenly on your baking sheet. Otherwise, the seeds piled up won't be done when the ones in a single layer are already burnt.   This recipe is pretty good! I think you could kick it up with a blend of allspice and molasses rather than brown sugar, but otherwise pretty nice.

Delicious, like caramel corn
without all that karo syrup
and a nice boost of protein!
Unlike another poster, I do think
you need the salt to counteract the sweet.
But I did use sea salt instead of morton's - delish!

I've never really been a fan of pumpkin seeds, due perhaps to flavorless recipes. I was worried about the hot sauce, so I used a little bit more sugar. It turned out great. The timing for me was a bit off, and I had to retrieve them about fifteen minutes early. Overall a great recipe and one that I'm definitely going to have to make again. (Thankfully my family carves many pumpkins for Hallowe'en, no shortage of seeds!)

This recipe turned out great ! The only thing I changed was baked a little longer , maybe 10 minutes and watched closely. I liked them a touch crispy. But not too well done. And they turned out really good!  Just enough sweetness and spice. Perfect!

I did not find them to be sweet or spicy.  However I did find them highly addicting!  I love worcestershire sauce, and it was a very strong flavor.  Next time I will definitely increase the heat level.

A nice twist on boring pumpkin seeds!  Although my daughter liked the old way we cooked pumpkin seeds, these had so much more flavor and I'll definitely make 'em again. I used Tobasco sauce, but  no one thought they were too spicy.  This one's a keeper!

Just took these out of the oven, followed the instructions to a T and that is the most disgusting thing I have ever put in my mouth ! All were still very wet / greasy , ( which from reading other reviews I expected and laid out on a paper towel to dry ) tasted like burnt popcorn and the actual seeds weren't even burnt ! ...how this recipe got 4 and 5 stars is beyond me ! I'll never get that taste out of my mouth !

Instead of hot sauce, I used cayenne pepper and a sprinkle of cinnamon. Very good recipe!

It didn't taste sweet at all and I could barely taste the spice. I had to add some more sugar afterwards to taste it. I mean, don't get me wrong, they were still good, but it wasn't what I expected.

In October, I always bring these into work as a snack and share some with my colleagues. I am repeatedly asked for the recipe. They are so good!

Not spicy enough. Wasn't spicy at all. I made another batch and added a tsp of asian hot sauce. Then it was great.

After trying several of the pumpkin seed recipes on this site, I combined a couple of them and we finally found our favorite.  This one is the closest.  The alterations I made are, omit the salt and use 2tsp of garlic salt instead.  Omit the hot sauce and use 1/4 cup old bay seasoning instead.  We cant wait to carve pumpkins each year to get the seeds.  But I have used already roasted seeds bought at the store, coated them with this mixture and roasted them according to this recipe and they turn out just fine.  With the alterations, we give this a 5 star rating.

I just made this recipe and we love it!  My girls did not like the plain old seed with just salt but these are a hit.  I did double the sauce mix but I used too much butter.  Next time I will stick with a little over the 2 Tbsp.  I like things with a kick so I will have to add a bit more hot sauce for my tastes.  My daughters said they reminded them of their Nonna's chex mix recipe.  No matter what,these are now a favorite in our house!  Thank you for posting them!

I tried this for my granddaughter to try pumpkin seeds and was totally disappointed. The recipe itself was fine, but they came out bland and burnt. She said they tasted like burnt popcorn, which isn't good.

These were excellent, roasted for 30minutes at 275, only used 4 tbsp of sugar which was more than enough. Added a little more cinnamon, these were excellent will be making these every year for my sweet batch of pumpkin seeds.

Extremely easy.  Great tasting.  I normally don't like roasted pumpkin seeds.  These are tasty and crunch.  My coworkers thought so as well.

After reading several recipes I decided to try this one.  One of my friends suggested I dry the seeds out overnight, so I left them in my oven with the light on.  I read the reviews first and one of the first complaints was that there was not enough flavor on the seed.  So I doubled the recipe.  I melted the butter and then combined all the ingredients so I could taste the sauce.  It was wonderful!  I baked the seeds for about an hour, @ 300, stirring every 15 to 20 minutes.  I have not been a real pumpkin seed fan, but those in my realm really loved this recipe.  I thought it was good as far as pumpkin seeds go.  :)  I hope that this helps the next person!  Oh yea, instead of Tabasco sauce I used Sriracha Hot Chili Sauce.  It has a nice burn without all the vinegar flavors.

yummy...a small note is that they come out of the oven still a bit wet but dry beautifully and are just the right bit of salty and sweet!

Too salty.  Remember there is a lot of salt in the Worcestershire sauce.  I would cut the salt amount in half.  Other than way too salty, has great flavor and would make again.
