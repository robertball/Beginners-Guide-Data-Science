This was very easy to make and tasted great. My hubby and I are trying to cut back on carbs, so this is a nice breakfast to make ahead and reheat. Worked out well in the mornings when we didn't have much time to cook and clean before heading out to work. My supermarket didi not have bulk sausage when I was shopping so had to substitute links. Worked out fine.

This sausage egg bake is out of this world! Quick, easy, delicious, and it browned very nicely on top. Since Campbell's Soup no longer sells Nacho Cheese Soup (where I live, anyway), I used Cheddar Cheese Soup and added a dash of hot sauce and about a teaspoon of chili powder.

Quick & Easy. I don't feel the soup is very good in it, and next time would not use it. Would substitute and use Mexican Velveeta. If you're in a hurry to just put something out there, this is a good one.

Great recipe!  I admit to adding some Aleppo pepper, but that was my only change.  This was a fabulous way to start the day and soooo easy to put together!

This was actually quite good, it surprized me. I really had my doubts using the condensed soup but it really worked. I did add a few spices to the egg mixture (fresh ground pepper, garlic powder, little dijon mustard, little Frank's Hot Sauce) and a little more milk than what was called for. The boys inhaled this. I could have gotten away with using half of the cheese called for. It was a little greasy.

This was really good and so easy!  Most similar recipes all have bread in them which I don't eat, so this was perfect.  Somehow the eggs set, but the cheese soup stays creamy.  I did have the same problem as others, couldn't find the nacho cheese soup, so I got the cheddar and added a can of drained rotel tomatoes to try to get the same effect and it came out great.

Bomb diggity. SO good. Took this dish to a potluck and it was gobbled up fast. I couldn't find the nacho cheese soup so I just bought the cheddar cheese soup instead, worked well as a substitute and still had great flavor because of the onion and sausage. The sharper the cheddar cheese the better. The center of my pan still looked jiggly and liquidy after 30 minutes so I left it in the oven another 15 minutes. Yes the edges got brown but they were delicious too. Definitely making this again. Thank you for sharing this recipe with us.

Made as printed except used onion powder instead of onions. It was good but extremely cheesy. Will use less shredded cheese and maybe add more egg next time. Overall very easy and tasty.

Really great except for overcooking.  Eggs should NEVER, NEVER, EVER be browned.

This was a really tasty egg bake.  After reading other reviews I did make some adjustments.  I could not find nacho cheese soup, so I used cheddar cheese soup and added a few dashes of hot sauce.  I also added 1 TLB of salsa, although I probably could have used more salsa.  My family has already asked that I made this again.

The fiesta nacho cheese soup is a great addition to this egg bake.  Nice gluten free recipe.  Consider using spicy breakfast sausage for more kick.

I put diced ham, onion, and bell peppers on the bottom.  Used Cheddar Cheese soup and an extra egg. Got a easy Western Omelet breakfast!  Next time will try a veggie version.  Like the texture and ease of this recipe.
