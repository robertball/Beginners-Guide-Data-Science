I really liked this for somethng different to do with snap peas. I just threw my snap peas in with the pasta for the last minute of cooking and then did the cheese sauce in the pasta pot while the pasta was draining - saved myself some dishes... The sauce was way too thick for me, so I did add quite a bit more cream- then I added a little gorgonzola to the top since it had weakened a bit. Even the kids both liked it. Thanks for the recipe!

This was delicious!  I added a bit too much Gorgonzola on accident, but the flavor was still wonderful.  Yes, the sauce is quite thick, so next time I'll thin it out with some milk, but the taste is great.  It was even better the next day, after refrigerating.

Very good!  I did add about 4 tbs of water to the sauce though, as it is very thick.  Was great the next day for lunch too.

I just made this recipe for the first time for tonight's dinner, and it was love at first bite. I've never had much luck with making cream-based sauce from scratch, but this came out perfectly! The sauce WILL look too thick when you blend the cheese and cream together, but it will thin out a little bit when you add the peas tossed in the butter...the butter will melt when tossed with the peas and thin out the sauce.

I adore sugar snap peas and pasta and this seemed like a great combination. However the sauce was a bit on the heavy side.It was also extremely thick.  On the plus side it did taste great.I think when I try to make it again I will thin the sauce a little. Thanks for the recipe idea.

I knew I'd love this so I doubled the recipe. SO glad I did, now I have plenty of leftovers. Sidenote: I enjoyed this with some buffalo style "chic" nuggets (vegetarian) and it was a truly great combination!

I have never had Gorgonzola.  And I never will again.  This is one of those recipes, where, unless you are a huge Gorgonzola or blue cheese fan, DO NOT bother. It stunk up the house!

I used fresh green beans because they were on sale, fat free cream cheese and 1% milk.  I then did not feel guilty about doubling the blue cheese.

This would also go good with aparagus.  Very easy and quick for week night meal
