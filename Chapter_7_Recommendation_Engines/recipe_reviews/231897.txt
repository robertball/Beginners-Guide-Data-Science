This soup has potential!
I needed it for a larger crowd so I doubled the recipe, bad idea. 
Next time I will double the pumpkin and broth but not the potatoes. They made it too gritty. I definitely will use plain potatoes and add garlic and onion on my own. 
The cream rounds it off nice however, being dairy intolerant, I will use another non dairy alternative.
Thanks for posting!

This soup is super easy and quick. It was good, but, as my husband put it, "I feel like I'm eating pumpkin flavored mashed potatoes." If I make this again, I will try reducing the mashed potatoes by half. And maybe throw a cube of chicken bouillon in, in addition to the chicken stock in the recipe. My 1yo LOVED it, though, just as it was.

Really easy to make and really good. I added cayenne pepper to make it spicy. It also tastes really well with Club crackers.
