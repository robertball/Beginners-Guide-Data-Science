I used mozzarella cheese instead of Swiss and I used thousand island dressing instead of French and it turned out amazing!

Made this for dinner and the hubby loved it! I did the switch with mozzarella and thousand island dressing. Also added extra layer of chicken.... He just gave me a thumbs up!

My husband and I loved this casserole!  Ate the whole thing in 2 meals.  I used thousand island dressing instead of french and mozzarella instead of swiss because that's what I had in the house.  I  will definitely make this again. I wish we had more leftovers.

I must disclose that I don't like Reuben sandwiches either so this is not a big winner in my book.
