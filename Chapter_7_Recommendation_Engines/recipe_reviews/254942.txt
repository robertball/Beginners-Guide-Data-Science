09.27.16 ~ I found a 2 lb. pork tenderloin in the freezer, so I doubled all the marinade ingredients. The meat marinated overnight and that led to delicious flavoring. The sauce/marinade is wonderful with this dish. I served the dish over thick kluski noodles along with steam broccoli and cauliflower. Dinner was delicious, and clearly for us, the marinade was the hit of the meal. Thanks waterlily78, for sharing your recipe. It will be used again in our house.

I fried the pork in my cast iron skillet instead of grilling it. Very moist and flavorful!  Definitely make it again!

Flavor was good but was too salty.  Even with lite soy sauce.  We did two 1 lb loins so I doubled the recipe.  Maybe that added to the saltiness?  Flavor was good though.  Could try it with less soy next time.

I guess I did something wrong as this sauce was a little bitter.  May have been the orange juice, although, my DH and I both tried the juice before using it as fresh isn't always sweet.  Add some Stevia and a teaspoon of brown sugar and it was better.  Guess I'll stick to my own recipe that hasn't failed yet.  Sorry to the author of the recipe, maybe it just wasn't our taste.

I marinated mine for a little over an hour in porkchop style cuts then seared both sides after that added the marinade finished cooking through on a lower temp.  It turned out very good, just the right amount of each ingredient so nothing is overpowering.
