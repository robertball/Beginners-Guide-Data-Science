These tasted amazing! I did however have a really hard time with them sticking both in the beginning and the end. They were sticking to the point that in trying to flip them they were breaking apart so I had to pull them up before I got a real dark brown on them. I am new to the IP and just discovered how to change the temp on the saute method. Mine was set to the hottest which could have been part of the problem. I also left the peel on as I always do with Yukon's and that might have played a part too. The flavor on these is amazing and this is one I will try again with my saute function set on the lowest heat setting.

This recipe was so easy to get together and was perfect with my roasted chicken.  I used very little thyme because I am not crazy about the flavor, but, other than that prepared exactly as the recipe stated.  The garlic gave the potatoes a great flavor.  The key is getting a good sear on the potatoes.

We've made this a few times now, as written, and they are phenomenal. I have started adding a few potatoes so we have more left overs. It's hard to brown them all, but the flavor is still there so it works.
