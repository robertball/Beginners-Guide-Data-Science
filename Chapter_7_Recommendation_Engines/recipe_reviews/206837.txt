I just made this and it was amazing! I only prepared for 2 servings, and kept all of the ingredients in the same proportions, only with 3 differences: -added 3/4oz cream cheese during simmer -substituted white vinegar for balsamic -used crush basil during simmer, topping with fresh basil upon serving  RIDICULOUSLY TASTY, and very simple too :)

Excellent sauce... I used fresh tomatoes (8 romas) as I avoid all canned goods due to high sodium counts.  I doubled the red pepper flakes and halved the sugar but left the rest the way as stated.  Once done cooking and before adding the basil, I used my immersion blender to thicken it up with the chopped tomatoes/onions.  Excellent served over any pasta. Have made this once already and forgot to review :) Good stuff! thanks for the recipe!

Good, fresh recipe. Make sure you use good quality balsamic vinegar. If you do not have fresh basil, add dried basil when the tomatoes and other ingredients are added. Bring to a boil, cover and reduce heat. Allow to simmer for at least an hour for full flavor.

The best tomato sauce we've had, including any from a restaurant (and dare I say even better than dishes we had in Italy).  Made a couple tweaks:  used fresh tomatoes (roughly about 7-8 tomatoes), used a couple extra tablespoons good extra virgin olive oil and a little more balsamic (roughly 1-1.5 tablespoons, instead of teaspoons), and did not use any sugar (it was sweet enough from the tomatoes and balsamic).  I also used 1 extra clove of garlic.  We left the red pepper flakes out, and each person could add to their own dish.  It was absolutely fabulous, and this will forever be my go-to red sauce recipe.

This was great.  Increased the garlic, pureed the canned tomatoes, used only 1/2 tsp of sugar, as I don't care for sweet tasting sauce, and pinch of red pepper flakes.  The fresh basil at the end really pulls it all together.  Used it with "Hearty vegetable Lasagna" recipe on this site.  It was great!

Flavor was great - although I'd put in even MORE basil, let it simmer, let it SIMMER!  And I'd puree it too - always better pureed!

Thanks for the delicious recipe - this recipe has convinced me, you can use canned tomatoes...

Thank you for the great recipe, Carolyn. I did not change a thing. We loved the zing of the red pepper flakes - even the five year old had seconds. It's a great way to use some of the basil rolling in from the garden.

I made this sauce mostly according to the directions.  I did puree the onions and canned tomatoes (I don't care for chunky sauce).  I substitued 1 cube of frozen chopped basil (from Trader Joe's) for the fresh basil.  It was ok - fresher tasting than using canned tomato sauce.  However, it was too sweet.  My family commented it was too sweet also.  I would cut the sugar in half, maybe less.  If you want some zip to it, you might want to use more red pepper flakes, as I didn't taste any spiciness at all.  I'm still looking for that perfect light tomato sauce.

Very good tomato sauce that shows off the flavour of tomato.  I doubled the recipe and used San Marzano tomatoes for authentic flavour.  There isn't a lot of liquid in San Marzanos so the sauce is thick enough without adding tomato paste. Also used dried basil and added at the beginning along with adding one extra tbsp of balsamic to the doubled recipe.

A solid "go-to" tomato sauce.

This sauce is incredible! We made it as written and used extra hot red pepper flakes. The sauce is mildly spicy (a pleasant kick that would probably be less noticeable with a less potent pepper flake), chunky and packed with flavor. Of note, it is very important to add the basil just before serving; the freshness adds a lot to the sauce.

I've always made a tomato basil sauce similar.  I used to add onion until the owner of a great Italian said not to.  I always sieve my tomatoes for a smooth sauce.  I don't normally add the vinegar.  I add the fresh basil on each dish separately.  For a meat sauce, I would add the onion, saut√© some ground sirloin (or make meatballs) and a couple links of Italian sausage cut into pieces in the beginning and cook longer.  I usually cook my tomato longer, too.  Sometimes, add a pinch of baking soda to reduce the acidity.

Followed this recipe exactly and doubled the batch.  It was amazing!!  So tasty and the perfect consistency!  I made lasagna spinach rolls and placed them in this sauce.  It was a big hit with the family.  :D

I have used allrecipes.com for years, but haven't reviewed a recipe until now.  I just had to let others know how yummy this sauce is.  I went out to the garden to do this recipe so there were some adjustments.  I picked fresh tomatoes, basil and one fresno pepper.  I used a good quality olive oil and cut back on the sugar.  Nothing but yummy!  Enjoy.

I have made this recipe as written and have used it as a launchpad for more elaborate sauces by adding assorted meats and veggies.
In my opinion, tomatoes are the perfect natural food and this sauce highlights them perfectly.
I offer my undying gratitude to you, Carolyn. This recipe is outstanding.

My husband, a bit of a finicky eater & accustomed to time intensive persian cooking, absolutely loved this sauce.  He listed off all the things it would be delicious on.  I'm making it again tonight because he keeps asking for it :)

This is very good! I added sweet Italian sausage to mine, so then added more of the seasonings, tomatoes and vinegar to make sure it was flavored enough. My whole family, including my 2 toddlers loved it! I did omit the red pepper flakes, but that is due to personal taste (too spicy for our tastes)

Hi, I had massive amounts of basil so I was just wanting to make a simple Basil sauce. This recipe was very easy on it‚Äôs own. I made adjustments because I had extra veggies that were in need of being used so I added them to this recipe. If you follow along with the original recipe it is very easy and good but if you have extra ingredients like I did it makes it even better. I added a Japanese eggplant and one green bell pepper to the onion and garlic saut√© part. The eggplant ends up making the sauce even richer tasting since it just ends up mushing down once cooked through.  I also added two fresh heirloom tomatoes chopped up because I didn‚Äôt have chopped canned tomatoes. I did have Trader Joes Tomato Sauce and their Diced & Fire Roasted canned tomato. I used those two instead of plain canned chopped tomato. Once the sauce looked ready I got a potato masher and mashed the chunks so that it wouldn‚Äôt be so chunky. I would recommend using a tad less sugar  than what this recipe calls for .I‚Äôm glad that I found this recipe. It‚Äôs the first tomato sauce I‚Äôve made and it will be a staple because it‚Äôs so tasty and easy.

Good, but a bit too thin.  I added some parmesan cheese and heated up a bit to add some thickness.

Word of advise.  Do NOT use minced onions, they take hours and hours to soften.  Otherwise, made as directed, awesome sauce.  I put ours in the food processor because my daughter doesn't like chunky tomatoes.  Can't wait to can it.

Awesome pasta sauce.  Made exactly as recipe says and it turned out great.  We've used it for spaghetti w/meatballs and for chicken parmesan

Decided I wanted to make this sauce with linguini and mild Italian sausage so I switched up the recipe a bit. I did the recipe as followed but I diced fresh Roma and Campari tomatoes evenly. I tossed them in the sugar and balsamic with salt, pepper, oregano, crushed red pepper, granulated onion and garlic before dropping onto oiled pan. After they hit a boil and simmered for 30 I added a bit of red wine and tomato paste. Let simmer for another 30 and added the linguini, basil, and pan fried sausage. If it‚Äôs too thick add a few tablespoons of the water from the linguini pot. Enjoy!

We followed the overall recipe, but made a few changes. We didn't add any onions, added another clove of garlic, used dry basil, although it would have tasted better with fresh. We also used diced tomatoes, and left it chunky and super flavorful. We cooked it for 15-20 minutes simmering, covered. We topped it with Parmesan cheese and it ended up delicious!

ok. So, this was so good. I didn't have exactly every thing so I improvised a bit. I only had dry basil and so I used roughly half a teaspoon. Nor did I have crushed tomatoes, so I mixed a chopped tomato, with a table spoon of paste and like half a cup of water.  it came out perfect. even my 4 year old who is extremely picky said it was her favorite.

Hands down the most delicious pasta sauce I've ever made. Takes a long time to simmer and I wouldn't recommend messing around too much with the recipe (like I often do), but so worth it.

This sauce was extremely easy to make with simple ingredients you likely have on hand, and it tasted absolutely amazing. Will definitely be making this again. Try it!  You'll be glad you did.

Simple and delicious. Loved the fresh basil from my own garden. I added half a can of tomato sauce (15oz) to make it a bit saucier since the tomatoes reduced down well. I loved the kick the red pepper flakes gave to the sauce, though I probably will add just 1/8 of a teaspoon next time. And we added Parmesan cheese when serving on noodles.

Too much basil and too many tomatoes in your garden? This is an excellent recipe to take care of that wonderful problem. I made it exactly as written and served with fettuccine. A beautiful and easy dinner.

Very good sauce. I added an additional clove of garlic, doubled the amount of crushed red pepper flakes as I like a spicier sauce.  As I only had 1/2 cup of fresh basil, I added 1 tablespoon of dried basil.  Everyone thought the sauce was great although I found it a bit sweet.  Next time I think I would only add one teaspoon of sugar.

This was tasty, a little on the sweet side, but we didn't mind at all.  I used 3 cans of tomatos for more sauce and didn't have the fresh basil so I used dry.  I'm sure it would taste even better if it were fresh.  Also, after simmering for over an hour, I took a potato masher and crushed the chunks because my family does not prefer a real chunky sauce.  Will make again...Thank you!

I had 8 big beef tomatoes from my garden and decided to make baked ziti. I chopped the tomatoes  and simmered it with the herbs in may garden thyme,basil,oregano, and rosemary.  I  did blended as  well and added 6oz can of tomato paste to thicken it up.  Haven't made fresh sauce in a while and this is delicious! This will make a great sauce for my baked ziti! Chill it up and you can have gazpacho by adding fresh diced green peppers and cilantro.

Family loves this.  We omit the red pepper flakes sometimes, and I typically puree the sauce with the basil to add a pop.  Reheats great if you freeze it for later.

I made this for dinner tonight. It was simple and delicious. I used a 24 ounce can of crushed tomatoes because that is what I had and the sauce was plenty thick. I didn't have any balsamic, but I'm not sure if it made a difference or not. I also threw on some shredded Parmesan cheese right at the end. I served it with cheese tortellini. We loved it!

This is a very good recipe! This was my first attempt and I knocked the ball out of the park with this recipe.  I added  an extra box of Pomi Pomi strained tomatoes, and used a can of whole peeled tomatoes and a can of cut-up tomatoes.  I used 5 cloves of sliced garlic and  I added one extra tspn of sugar and balsamic  - though the next time I will, as we like it a little less sweet.  The next time the sugar will go in for 1 minute before I add the remaining ingredients - sans the basil of course. My wife really enjoyed it.  We like very spicy marina, so I ramped up the amount of the red pepper flakes to 2 teaspoons. This gave the dish a nice low/back heat, though when I experiment the next and reduce the sugar and balsamic by 1/4, I will reduce the red peppers flakes  to  just 1 teaspoon.

I added a red pepper because I had one that needed to be used asap. I roasted the red pepper and garlic, otherwise the recipe was followed as instructed. I also blended everything in a blender because I prefer a thinner sauce for what I was using it for.

Made it exactly as written, except I blended the sauce before adding the basil as I wanted a smooth sauce.  Fabulous!   I will certainly be sharing this recipe with others and making it often.  Even my husband who loves meat in his pasta sauce thought this was excellent.

Ate this sauce tonight and it was excellent! We like extra garlic, so I used about 5 cloves instead of 2. I had no red pepper flakes (we don't like too spicy), but I just gave it a couple shakes of Tony Chachere's Creole seasoning. When it was nearly done, I tasted it and it was bland. So I then added a few pinches of fresh black pepper and 1/2 tablespoon of salt. That was just right. I reserved the fresh basil leaves for later - made sauce at mid-day, then reheated it to cook homemade meatballs in the evening. That's when I added the basil. The meatball recipe said add a little water as needed so your sauce doesn't dry out while you simmer the meatballs. I used water AFTER I used about a cup of white wine first. I'm sure that added a little flavor! The meatball recipe was from Fabio Viviano's book "Fabio's Italian Kitchen." They were excellent as well. Not sure if there is a similar recipe on this site, but I will check, and if not, I will try to add it later.

Made this for dinner last night- it was amazing! Omitted the sugar, and doubled the red pepper flakes to add more of a kick, and it was perfect! I bought a jar of prego because my husband doesn't like vegetables AT ALL, but after I forced him to try this, he threw the prego away! I tossed whole wheat penne and spicy sausage with the sauce, and added a bit of fresh parmesan on top, and it was SO good. Will DEFINITELY be making this again soon, but next time I'll double the recipe!

Surprised how tasty this simple sauce was! The key difference from sauces I've made before was the balsamic vinegar so maybe that's the difference. Changes I made: didn't have fresh basil so substituted dry before simmering the sauce, didn't add sugar, added extra red pepper (we like it spicy) and it was perfect.

This was a yummy recipe - next time we will omit the red pepper flake as we didn't really care for the added heat, but otherwise a nice sauce.  I threw everything in the crockpot and it turned out great :)

Great recipe!  Left sugar out because I think the balsamic gave it enough sweetness.

Very good, very easy. I let mine simmer for over  2 hrs, only to allow tomato chunks to break down. (Wish I had pureed them first as others suggested) I thought the sweetness was just right and family agreed. Served over frozen breaded veal patties w/ spaghetti.

Perfect! Served it with Stuffed Shells and everyone LOVED it! I did add a little basil tomato jar sauce that was left over the fridge. But didn't really need it (just had to use it up). I would only serve with meatless dishes.

This was great.  I'm going to use it as a spaghetti sauce instead of my regular from now on.  I didn't have any balsamic vinegar so I used my favorite wine and a splash of white vinegar and it was perfect!

Made this with tomatoes out of my garden, but used dried basil in place of fresh.  It was still awesome.  Quick and easy to prepare.  Served it with Parmesan chicken (another recipe I found on this site), and everyone at the table devoured their dinner...even the picky hubby.

My boyfriend and I loved it.  I added mushrooms to the mix.
