I love this recipe, except for one thing: sugar free! I don't care for any sugar substitutes, and I also don't prefer artificial flavorings, so I substituted lemon juice and unflavored gelatin and sugar for the jello, and skipped the cool whip, I just whip the cheese/gelatin mixture after it semi-solidifies.

thought this was a cook recipe
only two problems i had were:
1) the graham crumbs, even with the cooking spray, didnt stick to well. wouldve been better if binded with olive oil or melted butter.
2) the filling wasnt lemony really so i added 2 tablespoons of freshly squeezed lemon juice. 
EVERYONE in the house LOVED it, all wanted seconds. 
thanks for submitting will definitely make again!

I used a reduced fat premade graham cracker pie crust to save time. I also added 1/2 lemon extract .  Love it. will make it again.
