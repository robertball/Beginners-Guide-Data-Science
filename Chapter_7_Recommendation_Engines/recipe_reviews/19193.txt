SOOOOOO good! I had half a can of sweetened condensed milk to use up, and I'm so glad I found this recipe! I did a half-batch and I pretty much followed the recipe... Although I didn't measure the peanut butter, just put a huge spoonful of it in the milk. Oh, and a hint: It's much easier to mix the milk/PB-mix and spread it over the crust if you heat it in the microwave for 15 or 30 seconds. Then in blends really easily and it's pretty simple to smooth over the base. I also pressed down on the top crust a little to make sure it would not fall apart. Wonderful! I lined the 8" pan with foil, sprayed it, and it was simple to remove and cut the bars. Thanks, Sue, I LOVE this recipe!

this recipe is excellent and so easy! they look great too. next time i will try white chocolate chips and butterscotch chips. if you slightly heat the condensed milk + peanut butter mixture in the microwave, it helps to ease the spreading over the oatmeal base.

All I can say about these bars is run to your kitchen and make them now, especially if you love PB & Chocolate together :o)  I followed the directions to a "T" and these turned out awesome!  Everyone who tried them loved them.  I did line my pan with foil so the bars lifted out easier to cut.  I stored mine in the fridge.

OMG!  These are incredible!  I didn't have any sweetened condensed milk on hand so I looked up a subsitute and it was fantastic, better even than canned sw. cond. milk.  2 eggs, 2 Tbl flour, 1 tsp vanilla, 1/4 tsp. salt, 1 cup br. sugar, and 1/2 tsp Baking powder.  (Who'd have thought that you could make your own sweetened condensed milk?)  Thanks so much for the recipe!  It's a keeper!

SOOOO GOOOOOD!  I only used 1/2 cup of chocolate chips because I didn't want to make the chocolate overpowering.  They came out perfect.  I've tried them a few times, and they always come out a little better and softer when I bake them in a glass pan instead of a metal one.  I've also used peanut butter chips instead of chocolate chips.  MMMMMmmm...

Wow.  These are really good and not too sweet.  My young kids gobbled these up, and I have to say my hubby and I were right there with 'em!!  I didn't measure the choc chips, just added to coat the pan.  Also added a handful or 2 of white chips.  I didn't have all the peanut butter it called for, which didn't matter.  The peanut butter and cond. milk aren't hard to mix at all..just a little elbow grease.  :)  The recipe calls for you to allow them to cool before cutting them, but I had to try them out of the oven and I think they would be awesome warm with vanilla ice cream!  I will definately keep this recipe.  Thank you so much!!

I have made these several times; they seem to work for me everytime.  I make sure, however, not to bake them too long.  This will definitely leave that burnt chocolate chip aftertaste.  Watch your oven, and these will definitely be a hit!

these are so darned good! I didn't change anything except I don't use instant oats; I like the bigger flakes of oats that the old-fashioned rolled oats provides. Never fails to amaze me how people will rate a recipe less stars because they are 'rich' or 'too sweet'; all one has to do is look at ingredients to realize yes, they have ingredients that produce a rich dessert bar but oh so good. Didn't have a problem mixing the milk and pb-just a few whips with the wisk and it was incorporated. Used a glass pan and no sticking at all; 30 min. was perfect. *TIP* to avoid browning of morsels or pb mixture, refrain from spreading to the edges of pan.  I had no problems.  thanks for this quick and easy recipe. love it.

These were good, but a little too rich for my liking.  I used a full bag of chocolate chips..(I'm not sure if that's more than 2 cups), but it was way too much.  The chocolate overpowered everything else and made these sickly sweet.  I did like the crust.  It had a good flavor and I loved the oatmeal in it.  Would probably only use half a bag of chocolate chips next time.

These were good although too sweet for my taste.  

I made the prep easier by using a food processor to make the oat mixture.  Then after reserving part and pressing the rest into the pan, I used the processor again to mix the peanut butter & condensed milk.  Altogether less than 10 min prep time.

Fantastic and easy. Cut them into very small squares, as they are decadently rich and a bite or two goes a long way--but that's probably because I added a cup of coconut (sprinkled it atop the peanut butter mixture before sprinkling the chocolate chips), and doubled the chocolate chips. They are very gooey, so I store them in the refrigerator after baking. I've added this recipe to my Christmas cookie list for the future!

I almost gave this recipe only four stars because I believe that more butter is needed to avoid crumbling...the last time I made these, I used a full cup of butter (gasp) and they turned out to be just perfect. They cut easily, and made nice firm bars. Everyone who eats these falls in love with them - it is the peanut butter/condensed milk filling that makes them rise above any other confection of this type. You only need one small bar at a time, because they are very rich, but they are oh so good. Thanks for the wonderful recipe.

Update: I have started selling my baked goods at a local farmer's market and these are the absolute favorites. I sell out every week. I love to watch people's faces as they bite into the small samples I provide - if they taste them, they must have more. Thank you, Sue!

Easy! Great taste!  Followed the recipe exactly as written, then added coconut and dried cranberries for an extra boost.  We have made these 4 times now and this is on our list of favorites!

These bars are good, but really sweet and a little bit gooey...I followed other reviewers' suggestions and I microwaved the milk/peanut butter mixture long enough to make it easier to spread (about 30-40 seconds). Even after microwaving, I found that it still would pick up the crumb crust when spreading, but that didn't matter much. Before making the bars, I lined my pan with aluminum foil, which made it a lot easier to pull it out of the pan and cut into bars when it was cool. After cutting into bars, I'd recommend storing these in either the fridge or freezer because they can be a little messy since even after cooling, the bars are rather soft and gooey. I chose to put them into a tupperware container in the freezer. When I wanted to eat one, I would pull one out, let it thaw for about 5 minutes and would eat it cold/frozen. I found that I actually liked them better that way. Overall, I'd say this recipe is a winner. It's quick and easy, I usually have the ingredients on hand, and it is a nice treat for a sweet tooth.

This is a rich but excellent dessert.  Three things that I love wrapped into one delicious bar.  The combination of oatmeal, peanut butter and chocolate chips was great.  Took to work to share and was well received and as usual... requests for the recipe.  I would suggest to use a fresh can of Sweetened condensed milk because it can get even thicker if you have had it a while.  I also added about 1/2 tsp. vanilla to the milk/peanut butter mix.  I also used my fingers to help spread it on top of the pressed mix.  Everyone raved and that is why it gets a 5 star.  Not just the consensus of one or a few.   Thanks for sharing this recipe Sue!

These get five stars from my family.  Very good and easy to make.  I used regular oats instead of quick and I did heat the peanut butter & condensed milk together in the microwave for about half a minute to make them easier to combine.  I also only used about half a cup of chocolate chips as other reviewers had done & found it was plenty.  All in all a good new cookie that I will make again.

These are fabulous!  I have made them twice now and have not been disappointed!  I did find the peanut butter mixture a little hard to spread over the crust so I sprayed my spreader with a little cooking oil and it made it a lot easier.  Can't wait to make these again!

I made these heavenly passion bars this past Sunday to send to school for a Thank You/Good bye present for my daughters teachers. One girl said they were the best she ever had, better than any brownie. I altered the recipe slightly..using dark chocolate m&m's..in pastel colors.. we had left from Easter, in place of the semi- sweet chips.  They turned out so cute and springing looking.  As with any bar recipe,  the outside edge always turns out a bit more crunchy than the middle so I trimmed off an inch around the edge of the pan after it cooled.  I save the edges in the freezer to eat as an yummy ice cream topper later. This recipe is soo easy.  You must try it!!

I am pretty passionate about the taste of these bars! I followed the recipe with the exception of making this in a tart pan & springform pan and I used milk chocolate chips instead of semi-sweet. This recipe has a strong blend of salty and sweet. I didn't know what to expect, but I am extremely pleased with the end result.

Not crazy about this. It's too dry and def not sweet enough. I thought there would be a stronger caramel taste but I was sadly mistaken. I bake often and have made bars many times in the past couple of days and all have been great except this one. Hopefully some ice cream will save this.

These turned out very good. I know a few folks commented about being "too sweet" but I think that happens if you use too many choc chips. I only used what the recipe called for - 1 cup... not dumping an entire bag in.

Not bad, but not my favorite recipe.  My family turned their noses up, but I ate on them for a few days for something sweet to eat.  I cooked them for 25 minutes, and they were overcooked.  Since this is not a recipe you can really tell when they're ready, I had to depend on the directions, and at 25 minutes it looked like they were getting browner than I like.  Anyway, it was worth a try.

Rich, soft, gooey...you can't go wrong with this one! Followed the recipe exactly except went scant on the chocolate chips (which were mini) and used margarine instead of butter.

These were just alright.  I made them as written and although I like peanut butter, it just didn't work well for me in this recipe.  Maybe more of a carmel layer as opposed to a peanut butter flavored layer would have been better.

YUMMMMMY!  Definitely cut and eat these after they are completely cooled as the peanut butter and condensed milk layer doesn't set properly before then.  I've made these for several events at work and everyone went crazy over them.  I saw one man go back to the plate 4 times.

These were phenomenal!  My family loved them warm and room temp.  I followed the recipe exactly.  I did have trouble spreading the peanut butter mixture too, and I will try warming it next time for a few seconds in the microwave, because I will be making them again.

A little too messy and "oaty" for little hands but the flavor is good.  Unlike other reviewers, I think I would have preferred more chocolate chips ( I only used 1 cup)

Followed the directions and used the same ingredients except I only had mini chocolate chips and used 1/2 cup and used crunchy peanut butter. Had to use more of the oat crumble on the bottom and had a some what difficult time spreading the peanut butter mixture on the crust since it kept lifting crust up. It started to burn at 25 mins. and I took it out of the oven. The edges were pretty chewy & crunchy. The middle was still soft, which tasted much better than the sides. It's rich and super sweet. Next time, I will need to watch it after 20 mins. so it won't too crunchy & chewy or lower the temperature.

I was looking for a dessert recipe other than the usual brownies or cookies to bring to a picnic. Boy am I am so glad I came across this recipe because these bars were not only FANTASTIC but super easy to prep and bake! I slipped a gallon storage bag over my hand to mix the crust ingredients by hand and also used it when pressing it down into the greased foil lined pan. I did find the need to warm the milk and peanut butter for easier stiring and pouring. The end result on the sweetness scale for me was just perfect. Much to my surprise the s/c milk and peanut butter did create a subtle caramel flavor peanut butter taste. BTW there were lots of brownies and cookies still left on the table but these were all gone. :)

These are sooo good! I keep going back and cutting off little slivers at a time. For some reason, when I went to the store, I thought the recipe had coconut in it, so I bought it. I realized that it didn't, but added it to the crust anyways. I think they would be great without it as well. Top was a little crumbly, so I might add a little more butter next time, or just press the top down like another reviewer suggested.

We liked this alot, but we both would have preferred a few less chocolate chips.  Other than that, and the pb mixture being hard to spread (should have microwaved it for a few seconds) it was easy to make and had nice flavor and texture.

Rich and delicious! I used whole wheat flour instead of all-purpose and you couldn't tell at all that they were a "healthier" version. I thought it would be prettier to put the chocolate chips on top but they fall off when you're serving/eating them.

Wow! Yummy! I only had dark brown sugar. I would have preferred light. definitely gives a darker flavor but still very tasty. I will be baking again very soon and will experiment with other flavors of chips as other bakers have suggested. Thanks for the excellent recipe!

My initial reaction to these was...meh...but then I found myself going back to them again and again so I guess they were better than I thought!  My husband thought they were great.  

If I were to make again, I'd use half chocolate chips, half butterscotch chips as that is just a personal preference but I wanted to make the recipe as stated first.  Also, the topping/crust was a little crumbly.  I think using cold butter would help combat this as the softened butter clumped into big chunks and didn't spread throughout all the dry ingredients.  Cold butter cut into pea size pieces and then worked into the mixture would combat that problem, I think.

These were really crumbly, not sure if they are supposed to be or if I did something wrong.  They tasted OK, but nothing special.  To spread the peanut butter mixture onto the crust was difficult but I finally just sprayed my hand with cooking spray & that worked great.

Won't be making these again. I LOVE the pb/chocolate combo but these were truly disappointing. I almost doubled the PB and still could barely taste it. Also bake time was too long.

Great recipe.  So easy to throw together.  I'll make sure to always have a can of sweetened condensed milk in my pantry so this can be a go-to last minute dessert b/c, otherwise, I always have all of the other ingredients on hand.  I will definitely try warming the PB/milk mixture before spreading next time b/c it was difficult to spread.  It kept bringing up the oat crust with it.  These bars are great warm with ice cream on them too.  But, equally yummy cooled and by themselves.

We liked this recipe, and it was pretty easy to make. I think nuts would make a nice addition to it - peanuts, pecans, or almonds.

This was good, I doubled the filling amount (milk & brown sugar) and it was very rich and chewy. My company loved it, and I thought it was just ok, peanut butter isn't my thing, my girlfriend wouldn't leave till I gave her the recipe.

This is definitely a peanut butter lover's delight. The peanut butter taste was overpowering. I basically just tasted the oatmeal and peanut butter. I couldn't really taste the chocolate and I definitely didn't taste the sweetened condensed milk. This is not a sweet dessert at all. Bars were ready in 25 minutes. The peanut butter/milk mixture was a pain to spread even after nuking it for 30 seconds. My kids ate for breakfast with a glass of milk and my husband and I had it with coffee. If you are not a fan of sweet desserts and you love peanut butter, this recipe is for you. We weren't crazy about it.

Bars are delicious.  Next time, I think I'd use a little less flour/oats or a little more butter to help cut back on the crumbs, but otherwise excellent!

These bars are fantastic. In addition to being delicious, I enjoy the contrasting crunchiness of the oatmeal and the gooiness of the PB/condensed milk mixture. The top was not packed down enough, and the end result was a lot of crumbs everywhere. This should be fixed by packing down more before baking, and perhaps adding more butter. Will definitely make again!

Thsee bars are good, but not excellent. There are just too many bar recipes with oatmeal in them that are for sure 5 star recipes. My family also liked them and they will get eaten.

Delish...family ate the whole pan in a day. Was testing recipes for Bunco, etc. and I think this one was a hit. Want to try and figure out how to make the oatmeal part less dry...maybe more butter.

these are a very decadent and rich dessert bar that my kids are currently obsessed with.  i think it could be made better with a few improvements, including doubling the crust recipe, which as written struggles to cover the bottom of a 9x13.  i also made it ith a full cup of PB and think it could even stand to have some more.  all in all a very simple bar to make, and because it's so rich and best served in smaller pieces, it lasts more than a day around my house!

These were delicious.  I used Spelt Flour instead of AP flour as I'm allergic to wheat, but am able to eat Spelt flour even though it's a derivative of wheat.  I got rave reviews.  Do wait for them to cool completely - they are WAY too rich when they're even slightly warm.  Also, cut into small pieces, they're incredibly rich!  This recipe is a keeper!!

These were perfect for a family party.  They are however very rich, and the next time I make them, and there will be many more times, I will cut them in little bites.  Thanks for a GREAT recipe.

I followed this receipt just as is - delicious, especially if you like sweets and peanut butter.  It's a great way to make a snack with whole oats.  They were very good after we let them cool, but we actually preferred them cold and chewy out of the refrigerator. My teenage ate half the pan in one night.  I used the tip about slighty heating the peanut butter and condensed milk in the microwave before spreading and it definitely made it easier to spread.

I cut low on the sweets, used 2/3 cup of sugar, 1 cup of condensed milk, and used only 1/2 cup of dark chocolate chips. Still, it was a bit too sweet. I will def. make these again but either cut the condensed milk to 1/2 cup or double the oat mixture. I used Quaker's Traditional oats, turned out ok.

I made this yesterday afternoon and half the batch is eaten already!  Needless to say, we’re enjoying the heck out of it.  I followed the recipe exactly (which is a rarity for me), and it was so easy to assemble and came out perfectly with 30 min. baking time.  As someone else here recommended, microwave the evaporated milk/peanut butter mixture for about 20 seconds to make it easier to spread onto the oatmeal crust.

Wow, these are awesome!  I made them tonight for the first time and everyone loved them!  The only change I made was to use milk chocolate chips instead of semisweet (personal preference).  They're very rich so go easy on the size of the bars cut, and they're oh so good!  Thanks Sue!!

A little too sweet/rich for me, but I think most people would like this.  I thought the p-nut butter/milk layer was too much.  If I make these again I'd either only use half of the mixture or use less p-nut butter.

These are pretty good and also quick to make.  I added some whole peanuts to add to the peanut butter taste.  They were very nice and chewy.  Not outstanding, but definitely easy and tasty.

I wanted to make a dessert late last night, read the ingredients for this one, and KNEW we'd love it.  Oats, caramel, chocolate and peanut butter?  Oh yeah!  Plus I always have these ingredients on hand.  I only had about half a cup of peanut butter and chocolate chips, but the bars tasted good anyway.  Next time I will definitely use the full amount of peanut butter since we love it, but I actually think 1/2 to 2/3 cup chocolate chips is good so the chocolate doesn't overpower everything.  I thought the oat part was a bit too salty so will cut the salt to 1/4 teaspoon next time.  I may experiment with adding double the peanut butter caramel since that's the best part.  All in all, this is a very tasty bar and super easy to make!  I will make it again many times in the future!

I am not much of a baker, but thought I could manage these. They were wonderful! I used a glass dish and baked 25 min.

These are so good!  I followed the recipe exactly.  They are super rich, but we like our desserts that way!  I'll keep these in mind for taking to work or a potluck - I think it would be a big hit.

Anything with a crumbly crust is good to me especially when it has oats in it. I used both white and chocolate chips and didn't use all the peanut butter mixture. They were amazing!

There are absolutely FANTASTIC!  I followed the recipe to a "T" and they turned out wonderful.  Creamy peanut butter center, yummy chocolate chips with a crumbly top?  What's not to love about that!  I'm making them for a cookie exchange next week and I'm positive they will be a big hit.

This is a great tasting recipe.  But, the top layer was so crumbly I will definitely alter something when I make it again.  As a side note, I used the "Homemade Condensed Milk" from this site which I recommend trying if you don't have sweetened condensed milk on hand.

After seeing other's issues with spreading the peanut butter/condensed milk mixture I thought that the bars would be more easily prepared in my food processor. It worked great.  Another change I made was to add 1/3 cup of cream cheese and 1 tsp. vanilla to the peanut butter/milk mixture in the food processor.  I store the cooked bars in the refrigerator so it keeps longer and that helps with the crumbly top layer, as well.  Great dessert with these changes.

I give these bars 5 stars for flavor, 4 for assembly.  I should have followed other reviews that said to heat up the peanut butter-condensed milk mixture, because I had a lot of trouble spreading it on the bottom crust.  The crust was also pretty crumbly, but that could have been because I used rolled oats, not quick oats.  I used plenty of chocolate chips and they tasted so good!  Not too rich for us!

Oh wow.  This was amazing.  Chocolate, peanutbutter, & oatmeal goodness.  Easy to make-very little prepwork.  I halved the recipe & used a 9x9, and ppl are going to be sad I didn't make the full 9x13.  Will make again.

Good recipe. I used mini choc chips. Heated the peanut butter and sweet cond milk to make it easier to mix. Baked for exactly 30 min. In order to make these better if I make them again I'd 1) add the topping before the choc chips and press it down a bit, as the topping fell off with each bite 2) Use regular choc chips cause I just think they'd make for a better texture 3)Add some nuts or maybe use crunchy peanut butter.
 All in all good and remind me of magic cookie bars (but not as good).

this is a delicious, very versatile recipe. I would also call it very forgiving because I actually forgot to put in the baking soda and it still came out just fine! I made it with 1/2 a cup peanut butter chips and 1/2 a cup semi sweet chocolate chips and it was really good. Any kind of chip combination or substitution would work on this I think (or even no chips at all!) plus the addition of cocounut and or nuts would I'm sure work as well. I used old fashioned oats as they were all I had on hand but pulsed them a bit in my food processor to make them more like quick oats. Worked great. I was worried when I took it out of the oven after 30 minutes that I'd over-cooked them as the sides looked pretty brown thru the glass pan, but as it turned out it was perfect. They wouldn't have held together if I'd cooked any less time.

I made these exactly as the recipe specified, but in a slightly smaller pan (7 1/2 by 11 1/2). They are delicious, a perfect combination of crunchy and chewy.

Unless I did something wrong, the oatmeal part needs to be changed.  It was good and interesting, very rich and people liked them but I was disappointed.  The middle peanutbutter fudge part was pretty good.  I'll add more peanutbutter, maybe use a different oatmeal cookie recipe, and cook the bottom oatmeal cookie layer about 8 minutes next time I try it.

This recipe is very good!!!!! Once you try one, you won't be able to stop eating them!!!  I made the recipe as is and it is very good. My advise would be to cut them while they are hot and do not over bake them. I made the mistake of overbaking by an extra 10 minutes as I thought it was not brown enough. Big mistake! I forgot that this are not chewy type of bars. The condensed milk and peanut butter are like hard REALLY hard candy if you over bake them, so cutting them is a challenge once cooled off.  My other advice is the type of peanut butter you use. If you use the already sugary brand, you may be able to decrease the brown sugar. If you use the less sugary but creamy, definitely use the full amount of brown sugar the recipe calls for. Also, warm up the peanut butter and condensed milk mixture to make it easier to spread. After keeping these suggestions in mind, you should not be able to stop eating them, guaranteed!

I thought it was ok.    If I made it again I'd lower the peanut butter and add butter.  In the current form it is too crumbly and has too much peanut butter.  My family didn't like it and didn't eat it.

This  will be a go to can't miss quick and easy  everyone will  love it...as long as they can eat peanut butter. I use 2 sticks of butter though, placing them in a 9x13 pan,  softened in the pre-heating oven just a couple minutes. Meanwhile I mix  the dry ingredients in  a bowl, and mix the  PB and condensed milk in a pirex measure bowl heating them slightly to spread easier.  The butter when soft,  I put into the dry mix, and follow the rest as written. The butter left in the pan is just a good thing I think. Everyone says yumm!

ALWAYS the best thing!!! I use crunchy peanut butter instead of creamy for extra nuttiness, but otherwise follow it to a tee. I've used old fashioned oats or quick cook and it works up the same either way. Oh, and I blob the peanut butter layer on in small portions and smoosh them down with the backside of a wet spoon - the sticky peanut butter can pull up the oatmeal bottom layer if you try to spread it another way.

Simple to make and delicious.  I followed the recipe exactly as written here and they were a huge hit among my cookie loving friends.  Next time I make them I'm going to try baking some in ramekins to serve as warm individual desserts with a scoop of vanilla ice cream!

If you're looking for easy and delicious, look no further. I did read a few reviews and the only changes I made was to use a little more peanut butter and after mixing the condensed milk and peanut butter together, I nuked it for 30 seconds to make it a bit easier to spread. Great recipe. Thank you.

It was ok but not great.  It was kinda like gooey chocolate peanut butter with the wrong crust--the crust was very similar to one i use for Apple crisp.  And I do like chocolate peanut butter, by the way. Just not great.  Pure gooey sugar and oatmeal and butter.

They had good flavor, but were a bit heavy and rich for me.  Super easy to make, though.

Made this for a church group and everyone loved it.  I thought the ratio of peanut butter to chocolate chips was a little off.  It needs more chocolate or less peanut butter.  I made it as written.

These were hard to make.  We used a food processor to 'cbumble' and it barely worked.  Plus, it was very dry.  And there was no differentiation between the PB layer and the dough layer.  It all just was one taste. Boring.

Excellent. One of the best baked treats I've ever made. I don't know why, but the peanut butter and condensed milk mixture become caramel. I made this vegan by using soy-free margerine and sweetened condensed coconut milk (does not impart a coconut taste into the dish), as well as Guitard semi-sweet chocolate chips (dairy-free).  The only minor change to the recipe I made was to add more chocolate chips, so there was a solid layer.

Great! I brought these to a get together and they got all eaten up. They were delicious! I will make these again, but the next time I do, I will try leaving out the extra salt. I think with using salted butter and peanut butter, they are salty enough.

Wow, what s delicious bar cookie! This was quick to put together from staples I had on hand. I followed the recipe as written and took the other reviews suggestion to heat the peanut butter before mixing with the sweetened milk. It would have been tricky to spread if I hadn't. Thank you Sue, for sharing your yummy recipe!

I made them because they sounded good but didn't end up eating them so I brought them to church the next day. They went super quick and I was asked to bring a double batch next time. One of my friend's kid literally took the spatula and licked it clean; I had to take the pan away or she would have licked the pan; and she reportedly does not like peanut butter.

So: Five starts. Super great.

I had a terrible time getting the crust to stay put while I was trying to spread the condensed milk/peanut butter layer.  I even heated it in the microwave per someone's recommendation.  Ended up in the trash can.

I did make these with 1 cup of butter to prevent crumbling of the crust.  It was very good, but 30 minutes was too long.  If I make these again, I will take out after 25 minutes as noted by other reviewers.  My oven is right at 350- recently calibrated.

The are overly sweet. I added bout 3 tbsp more peanut butter to the filling. After baking and cooling they were still not setting up enough to be cut so they need to be refrigerated to set up. I like the mixture of flavors though, so if I make them again I'll cut back on sugar in the crust, add an egg white to hold it together better, and change the filling ratio to more pb and way less sweetened condensed milk.

Loved them... not too sweet and they had both peanut butter and chocolate in them. You MUST wait until completely cooled... or even the next day for the bars to set. I tried them while they were still slightly warm and they weren't as good as the next day.

Really mine was a 3 star but it was my fault, I unknowingly used mint chocolate chips instead of reg. chocolate ones and I did't think mint was meant to go with peanut butter. but I do believe it would have been a 5 star otherwise. Great texture.

Added a whole cup of peanut butter by mistake, but it didn't seem to have any negative effect. These tasted like chewy peanut butter, chocolate chip granola bars. I would probably make them again in a pinch, but they were just ok in my opinion.

These are very good.  Just like an Oatmeal Carmelita, except with peanut butter/condensed milk instead of caramel. I ran out of regular peanut butter and had to use about half of the reduced fat kind and they still turned out great.  I baked them for 30 minutes and it seemed just right.  Thanks for the recipe!

OMG, these were so good!  I took them along on a weekend getaway with some friends. We didn't come home with any.  I kept joking that they are half way healthy, with peanut butter and oatmeal.  I'll make them again.

I halved the recipe for an 8x8 pan, and used a can of sweetened condensed milk mixed with unsweetened coconut (2-3 cups) for the filling. They were chewy, crunchy, and just a little chocolatey. Unlike most cookies I've made, the texture was better the next day. The second time, I tried using 1/2 the filling originally called for (with peanut butter) and then spreading it with s.c. milk mixed with melted chocolate and a little margarine (similiar to the filling in the recipe for Chocolate Revel Bars). I must've over-cooked them, because they were hard all the way through- even the filling was dense. I broke the pieces into a food processor (which makes putting the crust together a 2-minute process) and made the best ice cream topping I've ever had! Also, the second time I couldn't find the brown sugar (!), so I used white sugar with about 1/4 tsp. molasses.

These were fantastic and I was immediately asked for the recipe when I brought it to the picnic.  These were good but they fell apart on me.

We did not add peanut butter.  We also melted the chocolate chips & then mixed them with the sweetened condensed milk.  We think a great name would be "Chocolate Chip Oatmeal Cookie Dough"!

Rave reviews from everyone tonight, although my bars didn't turn out like the picture.  I used old fashioned oats and mini choc chips, only bc that's all I had on hand.  I did not follow the advise of one reviewer and I should have heated up the PB mixture, it would have been a lot easier, but maybe bc the PB I had was not very creamy and was more dry.  I may add coconut or walnuts next time but these are excellent as written!  Thank you so much for sharing!

Easy and yummy! I wish I had thought to warm the peanut butter condensed milk mixture before trying to spread it,  still wasn't too bad. Definitely will do that next time... and there WILL be a next time :)

Oh my these were delicious and super easy to prepare.  I followed the recipe exactly except I used reduced fat peanut butter and milk chocolate chips rather than the semisweet since it was what I had on hand.  They are so good, especially if you warm them up a little to make the gooey.  They were a huge hit.

Awesome!  My 12 year old son made these this afternoon (with a little assistance cutting in the butter) and the whole family loves them.  Perfect exactly as written.  Cut the first row into 1/24 size pieces but that seemed a bit much so the rest got cut smaller.
Update: 4 years later still a favorite. Took a batch to a bake sale last night. A woman bought one bar and came back 10 minutes later and bought all that were left. My now 16 year old son was annoyed but not surprised he didn't get any.

These are just o.k.  Seems like they're missing something, as the flavor is pretty bland and one-dimensional.  Vanilla, maybe?  Also found the peanut butter and sweetened condensed milk mixture hard to spread without destroying the bottom oatmeal layer.

These were very yummy, and easy!  I used old-fashioned oats and 1 1/2 c chocolate chips.  As I spread the peanut butter mixture on the crust, the crust started to come up and mix with the peanut butter - actually pulling the crust off of the bottom of that pan.  That was a bit frustrating, but it all looked fine in the end.  I used buttered hands to coax the peanut butter layer into spreading out  nicely.  I would make this again!

These are so quick and easy to make, and very good...very rich though, almost like candy.  The only change I made was using a half cup of milk chocolate chips and half a cup of peanut butter chips, because that is what I had on hand.  Definitly will make these again.

I made these exactly as written, and they were....OK. Reviews said they were sweet and rich, but mine were neither. I did use all natural peanut butter, and maybe others don't (meaning their pb would have added sugar, making the bars very sweet). But rich? They aren't rich at all! They barely have taste at all. I'm so sorry I used the ingredients on these.

I got creative with this recipe! I used heavy whipping cream instead of condensed milk and honey nut cheerios instead of chocolate chips for an extra crunch and to lighten it up a bit. altogether DELICIOUS!

These bars are excellent!  They turned out perfectly and the kids love them.  In future batches, I'll try using half chocolate chips and half butterscotch or all peanut butter chips to give us a little variety.

I only had 1/4 cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips on hand and a tiny handful of milk chocolate chips.  thought it  worked out well with less chocolate didn't overpower any of it.  very easy to get out of pan I followed one of the viewers tips to use foil and grease the foil, glad I did I don't think they would of come out easy if I didnt.  but all in all a outstanding recipe idea will make again for sure maybe toffee chips next time and omit the peanut butter I will work with the recipe.  thanks for sharing though awesome

very yummy!!  I used a whole bag of chocolate chips and butterscotch chips! I think next time I will use a wee bit more butter to make the crust not be as crumbly. Very good. would be great with coconut sprinkled on top too! Yummy and simple recipe!!!

The taste of these are good, I was disappointed that the chocolate didn't melt into a layer.  Maybe if you melted the chocolate first and spread on before baking, then topped with crumbs it would look more pleasing.

These were delicious, a little too rich, but great for chewy bars. I used a half a bag of semi-sweet chocolate chips and only about 1/4 crunch peanut butter, and it turned out fine.

Very good recipe, easy and quick.  Sturdy bars -- they keep their crunchiness over a few days, and the caramel layer stays soft.

These are yummy and so easy.  I used milk chocolate chips (I use them over semisweet for everything).  Also I microwaved the peanut butter and sweetened condensed milk for like 40 seconds and it turned into like a caramel consistency.  I poured it on and tried to spread it around but it lifted up the crust.  It did kind of fill out on it's own for the most part.  Wasn't a huge deal, I just didn't want to microwave it for too long.  Will definitely make these again!

Very good but very very sweet. The peanut butter layer was a pain to spread. I would probably make again if i had the stuff on hand.

AWESOME bars!  Crunchy, sweet, yummy and peanut-buttery without TOO much of any of it.....an equal balance of all 3.  I made it exactly as the recipe says, and took the suggestion to microwave the PB/milk to make mixing them easier.  These were a HUGE hit at the Super Bowl party!

Delicious bars! After reading many of the reviews, I reduced the amount of chocolate chips to 2/3 of a cup so the chocolate wouldn't overwhelm the peanut butter flavour. I think this was the perfect amount of chocolate flavour, I wouldn't want any more or any less. Also, melting the milk and peanut butter in the microwave for 20 -30 seconds made it much easier to spread on the crust part. These aren't going to last very long at my house.

Yum! Delicious - and a nice change from other similar recipes, using peanut butter. I actually decided to use a combo of PB chips and butterscotch chips in place of the chocolate. I didn't nuke the peanut butter/milk mixture since I knew it would combine just fine... but as I tried to spread it, it pulled up some of the base layer. I think nuking it would make it easier to spread. I also found that using super clean hands to crumble the butter into the mixture was easier than trying to do it otherwise. The heat of your hands helps to soften the butter into the mixture. --Excited to share this treat with coworkers today!

Great bar recipe! It is very rich, but very tasty. I would like to try different chips in there next time. I will definitely try mixing the peanut butter mixture with a food processor next time. It was challenging to spread.  This is a great gift giver.

These are definitely edible, just not our favorites, especially considering the rich ingredients that went in. The peanut butter and sweetened condensed milk combination fell flat, when it sounded good in the description.

These are just ok for me.  Of course, my peanut butter loving child loves them.  I like the crunchiness of the oatmeal topping.  They were really quick and easy to make, but flavor-wise they were just lacking for me.  I would not make these again.

These bars are fantastic! My boyfriend has a peanut allergy so I altered the recipe. After pressing the base into the pan, I sprinkled with coconut. Instead of pnut butter, I used 1/2 cup softened margerine. I topped with the chocolate chips as well as sliced almonds. This turned out very well.

Excellent. Easy and Tasty, what more could you ask for? I followed the recipe exactly and I noticed that the oatmeal part is a little too crumbly for my liking, so I'll tweak that a little bit next time I make it. Mostly the top was the crumbliest part, because you can pack the bottom layer in, but not the top. Still tasty.

This was delicious.  I added one full cup (and then some)of peanut butter to the evaporated milk to cut down on the sweetness a bit.  It turned out really well.  I can hardly wait to serve it to guests!

I cooked these because I needed to use up a can of condensed milk.  They turned out okay...not may favorite bar cookie ever I have to admit.  Maybe it's because I got distracted with a casserole I was making and left them in too long, but they weren't that good.

I thought these were just okay, but I'm kinda picky when it comes to cookies.  I wasn't blown away, but they weren't bad either.  I would probably make these again for my husbands sake.

I took these to a party and everyone loved them!  I had several requests for the recipe!  I used half peanut butter half chocolate for the chips.  Also, instead of sprinkling the top layer on, I pressed it on to make sure the top layer didn't fall apart.  This worked.  Thanks for the great recipe!!

Edit:  I accidently bought evaporated milk the second time I went to make these, and they still came out great!!  I used all chocolate chips like the recipe called for this time also, and i like it better.  Thanks again for the recipe :-)

After taking one bite, a gentleman asked me if I was married!! They were a hit! I made them early in the day, so I could cut and refridgerate them as previously suggested. They were not runny and held their shape throughout the night.

I used light condensed milk which probably didn't make much difference but made me feel better. Very sinful very rich and very yummy. Thanks.

Oh yes! Rich and delicious!  I used butterscotch chips instead of chocolate chips.  Lots of people wanted the recipe.  I will make these again.

GREAT recipe to make with the kids.  Also nice to find a good kid-friendly dessert item without eggs (since my daughter is allergic.)  Wow, very rich and addictive.  Thanks so much Sue!

I took these to a baby shower and while they looked good, they didn't go very well. They were pretty tasty, but I think the peanut butter got overpowered by the chocolate. I liked the texture of the oats, however, and used crunchy peanut butter to add more crunch. Overall, it was a good enough recipe but I think I'll keep looking.

brilliant recipe! easy to make and impossible to mess up (i left the bars in the oven for an extra half hour cause i forgot and they still came out perfect!)...try doubling the peanut butter filling and using butterscotch chips instead of the chocolate ones. they're really rich but i can't stop eating them.

These are very rich and oh so tasty!  Great dessert, and very easy to prepare!  I didn't have enough PB on hand so I used some PB chips - with milk choc. - melted those down and mixed with the condensed milk.  Thank you for a unique bar!

These were a big hit!  Though rich, they are not too ultra-sweet like some desserts. The oatmeal base is fabulous.  I added chopped pecans.  I can't wait to try them with a butterscotch filling instead of peanut butter for variety.  Yum!!

These were very good!  They were very soft with just a bit of crunch from the crumb topping.  I followed the recipe as it is and they turned out perfect.  This will be a keeper for my family!

I made these for my son's end of the season football party and they were gobbled up! I thought they were delicious, different from the ordinary bar cookies and not very difficult to make.  Will definitely make these again!

Made these for a Super Bowl party. Got multiple compliments on them, and that's my standard for whether to make something again . . . although I don't think they're the easiest bars I've ever made.  A little time-consuming, but worth it.

These are awesome! They were easy to make, and my office loved them! If you don't like chocolate, just leave the chocolate chips out, they are still excellent. I would definitely recommend these to anyone!

These are bars are delicious!  They turned out perfect.  I used mini chocolate chips instead and sprinkled some chopped pecans on with the chocolate chips.  It's hard to eat just one bar!

These were pretty dry.  The peanut butter filling was great, though if I made this again I'd double it as another reviewer mentioned.  Some of the people I served them to liked them a lot, while others (like me) just thought they were ok.

These are wonderful! They are best a little warm, and I usually reduce the cooking time by a couple of minutes. Last time, I used fat-free condensed milk, and I couldn't tell the difference at all. The only thing I wonder is if the filling would be easier to spread if I warmed it up a little first.  Everyone that tastes these raves about them!

This recipe is so easy and so good.  The bars are rich, chewy, and a huge hit with my family.
