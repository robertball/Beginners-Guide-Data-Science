This was absolutely delicious! The only thing I changed was the bread, I used raisin bread because it was the only bread I had at the time. My husband was just crazy about it. It's not too sweet or heavy, just yummy! A definite keeper, will be making this again soon :)

I am so surprised how much I liked this.  I have never made bread pudding, and the apples gave it a nice touch.  (I left out the raisins, as I was not in the mood for them.)  I did make a sauce for it out of brown sugar, butter, and milk (and a little condensed milk that I had left over due to scaling the recipe to fit the amount of bread I had onhand.)  In any case, this is a great recipe.  Thanks!

I make bread a couple of times per week and there is always some left over from last time (usually getting too hard for the kids, but not stale yet). This recipe(Ive used more than 20 times)is  the perfect solution to "what should I do with this leftover bread". Sometimes I toss the apples w/cinamon and brown sugar. And another time I used peaches and blackberries !!

This turned out great!  I made a double batch back on Thanksgiving weekend (Canada) as we were having company and I had lots of apples that had been picked to use up.  I used reduced fat sweetened condensed milk as well and it came out perfectly...with lots to go around!  I made sure to add the raisins as we love them!  Bread pudding is one of my hubby's favourites, so he was quite pleased!

This was pretty good.  I had 3 apples I needed to use (2 Granny Smiths and 1 Braeburn), part of a loaf of french bread and a can of sweetened condensed milk, so I decided to make this.  It has a very pleasant *cinnamon-y* flavor and the texture was just right.  Very good recipe.  P.S.  I decided to chop up some walnuts and added those.  That tasted really good, too.

I wanted to make a larger pudding, so used 8 stale Kaiser rolls with sesame seeds and used 6 eggs and baked in a 9 x 13 glass pan.  I used 5 Honeycrisp apples which were great and instead of raisins used dried cranberries.  This turned out wonderful with a nice rich custard and a sweet apple topping.  I will make this one again for sure.

Very satisfying. It was very easy to make and the taste is very good. I made a couple substitutions which may have changed the flavor a bit, but still pretty good. I used middle-eastern egg bread (slightly sweet), egg whites (all I had), and sprayed the pan with baking spray instead of buttering it. For my taste, it could have been a little sweeter and a little more flavorful. Next time I may add some brown sugar and some spice mix (apple pie spice maybe) to the mix. YUM!

My kitchen is running very low on ingredients- fortunately I was able to throw this together! And it was really tasty. I didn't have the full amount of apples, so I threw in some raspberries. They probably weren't needed- but they were tasty!!

I'm not rating this fairly because I don't know what went wrong with mine. I made it a few weeks ago and couldn't figure out what went wrong. The bottom was basically soup, and the top was burnt bread. Anyone have any ideas to what went wrong??

I put this into the slow cooker on med-low for about 4 hours and it was delicious!  I used more apples so I don't think it would have fit into a 9 inch square pan.  The kids devoured it and took the small amount of leftovers to school for their snack!  Thanks for a great recipe!!

This is an excellent recipe, VERY quick and easy to make. excellent with Vanilla ice cream. I have made a few over the last month and suggest that this comes out better in a square 9" pan. I used a smaller deeper pan and the center stayed to soggy. My fault.

Very good, I think I used to much french bread (whole loaf). Nice change from regular bread pudding.

This tastes sooo good, and not eggy at all.  I used pears since that's what I had and topped it with a homemade caramel sauce.  You can also substitue the water for some cream to make it richer.  You can eat this cold or warm, but I prefer warm.

This recipe seemed promising but it was a bit sweet for my taste. It was lacking the characteristics of a really good bread pudding

This was the easiest recipe to put together.  Each ingredient flavor was distinct yet blended together for a very rich taste.  All who tasted the finished bread pudding enjoyed it.

I used the fat free Eagle Brand Sweetened Condensed Milk and the finished food product had a deliciously rich taste.

Delicious.  I doubled it and put in a 10"x14"inch pan and baked for 1 hour.  Topped with cinnamon sugar after taking out of oven.  Granny Smith apples worked well.

I've never made a bread pudding before. I had a can of condensed milk and some gala apples on hand so I tried this one. It was easy and tasted good.  The only thing I changed was I used a cinamon swirl bread.

I made this today and is was very very good.  My son liked it.  I only altered it by using almond extract instead of vanilla.  I was out of vanilla.  I did not use raisons but think dried cranberrys or sliced almonds would have been great in it.

this was very good. i used applesauce instead of apples (didn't have fresh apples on hand!) and paired it with the "plum pudding sauce" on this website.

We gave this one a try but didn't come out too great. It's still good. I think some brown sugar and/or maple syrup would go well with it :)

WOW! I really took a chance when I decided to try this using up our surplus of hot dog buns from the 4th and my experiment paid off big time!  I used some home grown wind fallen granny smiths that were very small, but good, the raisins and a handful of craisins as well as about a cup of chopped walnuts too.  I also used non-fat sweetened condensed milk with great results.  I cooked ours in the crockpot as a previous reviewer suggested - oh the smell was delicious.  Mine was done on medium in 3 hours.  Served warm with vanilla ice cream- we were in heaven!

This recipe was my fallback plan after a batch of cranberry orange biscotti went awry. I had rather a lot of usable biscotti pieces that weren't burned (oops) or raw (double oops), and so I used the "good" biscotti as a substitute for the bread. Turned into a wonderful apple-cranberry-orange pudding! I went light on the sugar, since we tend to eat it with sweetened whipped cream or ice cream. Good recipe for biscotti-gone-wrong.

Delicious desert!  Even better for breakfast with some cream on top.   Added walnuts (rather than the suggested raisins).  I highly recommend the walnuts.  Am making this a second time, but with the apples cut up smaller so that it is easier to cut without breaking up. Might even be able to chop apples via food processor.

(I cut into squares and froze within small sandwich bags so I can simply heat one up whenever I fell like it. Simply heat in 30sec increments, let sit for a minute or two between heatings in order to let the heat diffuse properly, and continue until warm)

I was looking for a recipe to use homemade rolls that had gotten burnt that were not being eaten and I found this recipe. I only made 1/2 the recipe for 2 of us. I cut the crust off the rolls and broke in small pieces. I used 2 eggs, I replaced the butter with applesauce and made my own condensed milk with splenda for a healthier recipe. I used cinnamon, nutmeg and ginger and did not add raisins. It was really good.

We couldn't stop at just one slice. EASY!  I didn't have apples, used a cup of apple sauce instead & just a cup of water. I made a vanilla sauce to drizzle on top

This by far a great tasting bread pudding. My only tweak is that I add a cup of evaporated milk off course I reduced the amount of water and add about half a cup of brown sugar.

Great recipe.  Quick to pull together with everyday things in the pantry and the result is fantastic.  I used homemade English muffin bread that was getting a bit old, my mexican vanilla and granny smiths.  Thanks so much for sharing this recipe.  Guests loved it.

I was afraid it would be too sweet for my taste with the sweetened condensed milk, so I used evaporated milk instead, and omitted the hot water because I was afraid it would be too soupy then. I only had half the amount of bread that it called for, so it worked out. I had to bake it for about 10 minutes less, but the consistency was still custard-like, and it was excellent with sweet toppings. My favorites are real maple syrup and fresh whipped cream with a hint of vanilla.
