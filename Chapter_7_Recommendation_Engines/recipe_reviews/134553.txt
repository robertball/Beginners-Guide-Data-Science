Turned out great, I skipped the ice cream making part because I don't have one . I just poured it in the shell and froze. it went quick at the party though it tasted more like key lime pie, you couldn't really taste the avocados

I've made this incredible dish three times with rave reviews.  I did not have an icecream maker so just froze it in a glass dish.  I served it in champagne glasses, sprikled it with extra-dark chocolate shavings with a dab of whipped heavy cream.  I used fresh edible flowers and mint leaves for garnish!  It looked beautiful and tasted even better!  Great Dessert!

Amazing! Didn't have an ice cream maker. Threw it in the freezer, took it out a few hours later and used hand blender... then froze it until i served it the following day. My friends LOVED IT.

I made this recipe without a icecream maker. I mixed in my blender and then poured into pie shell and froze.  I did exactly the recipe and it was fabulous.  I took it to work along with chicken taco soup.  My co-workers could not believe there were avocados in there.  The only thing is you can't leave it out long or it will get to soft. But the taste is great and it is a very light key lime pie.  I garnished mine with small lime wedges.

This was very easy to make (I used an ice cream maker). It was a nice refreshing desert that wasn't too heavy. A great way to top off taco night! I added a splash of tequila when the filling was in the ice cream maker which was a delicious twist!

What can I say about this.....? It was great. And no...no one could tell it had avocados in it. Unless I told them....it tasted like a lime ice cream treat. I wouldn't call this a cheesecake at all. Even though it had it in there, you could only taste that slightly. It was more or less....to me and my family like ice cream. I used my ice cream maker with this, and it froze very well. It could go great by it's self in a bowl with a spoon or in a graham cracker crust, but it melts fast too. So don't let it sit out long. Or you'll have a serious mess on your hands. My family liked it and said it tasted really good. And we had never tried anything like this, so it was a total change of flavor for us. I had to double the batch because I didn't want to waste any avocados and we don't find 3oz pkg of cream cheese around here. Thank you, I will make again.

Excellent, excellent, excellent!  I have found another way to prepare avocados!  I made this tonight and because I didn't have an ice cream machine, I followed the advice of some of the other members and froze it!  After dinner and cleaning up the dishes, I took the pie out and cut two slices for myself anf for my husband.  We both enjoyed this so much  and I have a feeling this won't last long!  I used a prepared graham cracker crust that I had, followed the ingredients and all I can say is WOW!  The only thing I might do different when I make this again is probably add a little more cream cheese and perhaps some vanilla extract. I used light cream and liked the taste!  The avocados I used were slightly over riped but they worked just fine.  I will purchase fresh and ripe avocados the next time and really have great pie!  Thank you for submitting this recipe!  My grandson loves avocados and I do believe he will like this as much as we did!  Thanks again!  This is a keeper!

Fabulous! I made per recipe originally, with an ice cream maker, then made two more pies for Bunco night...adding 2 tsp lime zest to bump up the lime flavor. I did make the cream/sugar mix the night before and chilled, and used chilled ripe avocados to help it freeze up faster, and it worked well. This is a keeper and so creamy...

Like another reviewer said, it tastes like a light key lime pie.  I also did not use an ice cream maker.  I just spooned the mixture right into the crust and put it in the freezer for a few hours.  I used a shortbread pie crust instead of the graham cracker crust.  I took this to a family get-together and  at first they were skeptical, but in the end there were no leftovers!  Very yummy end to a hot day in GA!

Great lime pie... oh! that's right I did put avocado's in it too! I used half and half that was on hand, and used a 9 inch pie plate. This is awesome! Next time I make this, I will use the springform pan as another reviewer suggested since it IS rock-hard to cut. Yum-mi!!

I have mixed feelings about this dish. It came out well, several people said they loved it and I enjoy eating it. However, it freezes too hard, is too hard to cut when frozen and the avocado seems wasted, because we can hardly taste it. I suppose it acts as natural food coloring, and it adds nutritional value, but I was hoping for a play on the flavor. So, I'm experimenting. I added more avocados, and I'm adding gelatin or xanthan gum to improve the consistency. I'm hoping I can keep the mix from un-mixing, too, after it sets in my refrigerator for a few days. The mix really is like ice cream, so why not go all the way and treat it like regular ice cream? I also adjusted the recipe for a 9-inch pie (why use an 8-inch?). I adjusted for 2 pies, as I wanted to see what adding a mango puree to 1 pie would do. That seemed to work OK. As I often do in my calculations, I made a mistake, and now I'm eating a large tub of avocado-lime cheesecake filling by itself. Oh, the horror!

The dessert is amazing, we were impressed. I made it without an icecream maker. The taste was very unusual, delicate, and refreshing, a great summertime treat. You really don`t feel avocados in it. I made it in a springform and depending on your springform, you may feel you need more avocado filling, I had 28 cm springform and the avocado layer was a little thin, so next time I will use more ingredients.

WOW this is so good. I followed the recipe to a T and it was amazing. Used a gram cust i found on here that had cinnamon in it. I would really recommend it because the cinn. really complements the lime. Does taste just like key lime pie. OH, and i didnt have an ice cream maker so i just had it, put it in the cooled crust and froze it. It lasted us all week being frozen(its justme and hubby to feed)

I have made this recipe and it is amazing. However, I made some adjustments and substitutions. I used 2 avocados, 2/3 cup of key lime juice, I substituted 14 oz. of fat free sweetened condensed milk for the cream, I added a tsp. of grated lime zest to amp up the lime flavor and divided the mixture among 12 individual graham cracker crusts and popped them in the freezer for two hours. Serve with some cool whip and a sprinkle of finely chopped pistachios! Yum!!My husband hates avocado, but he gobbled up two of these delicious tarts and had no idea!

Thank you for a delicious recipe! I was skeptical, but this is amazing! I'm not a fan of key lime pie because it is typically too tart, but this was just right!! I got tired of squeezing limes and getting hardly any juice, so I used about 1/4 cup of fresh lime juice and subbed in the stuff from the plastic lime for the other 1/4 cup. Still amazing!! I also made my own graham cracker crust. I did not use an ice cream maker. I processed everything in the food processor until smooth and then poured it into the pie crust and froze overnight.

I made this, slightly tweaked! I took 2 avocados, 1 small tub of light cool whip, juice from 2 limes, 1 can evaporated milk, just under 2/3 cup sugar and mixed it really well in our vitamix (I'm sure any blender would work great) to smooth it out and poured it into a ready made graham cracker crust and froze it. It turned out wonderful and was super easy!! :)

This recipeis really creamy and delicious! It's almost like keylime pie. The only thing I had to change out of necessity was making a homemade graham cracker crust.  I love that the avocado replaces some of the fat that would have come from using an additional box of cream cheese from another recipe. I will definitely make this again!

I've made this for the third time now,  It is a great treat.  Everybody loves it.  I do use an ice cream freezer.   It's quick and easy.  I am still having quite a time trying to navigate around the new format being used.  I really don't think it is better than the old one.  It was very user friendly.  I can't find the nutritional info that used to be at the bottom of every recipe.   I sure hope that somebody will wake up and put that info back.  If it is there, it's hidden very well.

Wow. This almost didn't make it to the pie crust to become a cheesecake. This makes a great ice cream. I thought I wouldn't be able to taste the avocado but I can and it's awesome. In fact, I'm going to save it as an ice cream recipe.

So yum and refreshing. I would make the filling again just as Ice cream. I just froze it then blended and refroze. No one knew it was avocados. I personally love avocados, but the others don’t.

Cinco de Mayo in SC.  I used 1/2 cup buttermilk (instead of cream cheese) and used a little less sugar (used ~2/3 cup).  Turned out  great and was lighter in calories..  I also did not heat the cream first, just blended all ingredients prior to adding them to the ice cream maker.

Excellent dessert for taco night!! Super fresh and light! I didn't have an ice cream maker so just played it by ear. Didn't use a crust either (no graham crackers in Australia!!) so instead, after prepping the cream and processing the avos/cheese/lime, I whisked the two together and poured them into little ramekins and froze them - 6 hours later they were rock solid (possibly sooner didn't check). Moved them into the fridge and 1 hour later they were perfect. Garnished with thin candied lime and chopped pistachios (you eat with your eyes too!) Only negative is that you can barely taste the avocados. I used just over half of the lime juice needed, so if you want to taste the avos maybe use even less. Still it is amazing!

AVACADO? Color me skeptical but I was just curious enough to try it.  It's not something I would serve at every party, but I was amazed at how delicious the flavors were together. So easy and a real keeper in my recipe files.

I made this to take to an Easter gathering. This was a great  HIT. everyone raved about it. I will be making it again in a couple weeks for a birthday party. As far as the recipe, I did make 2 changes. I never use sugar, so I substituted 1/2 cup Truvia sugar instead of the 3/4 cup regular sugar. Also, I bought 4 limes and this was not nearly enough to make 1/2 cup juice, so I used  lime juice from concentrate that I had on hand.

Very good pie. As others have stated, it's more like a key lime pie verses a cheesecake. I used 3 packages of cream cheese and 2 full avocados. These changes thickened the mix and yielded 2 pies. I also froze the pies in the freezer, as I do not own an ice cream maker.

This is so amazing! Everyone loves it.  After the cream and sugar cool I toss everything into the blender then into the pie shell.  EASY impressive dessert.

I made this for a dinner party.  The guests loved it!  I didn't put the full amount of lime juice, but it still tasted great.  Also,  I didn't have an ice cream maker.  Instead I used my emulsifier and froze in the freezer. It worked well.

I don't have an ice cream maker either so I just froze it in the pie shell. It was delicious. I also had a little extra so I put froze it and made a couple popsicles which were also good.

This is fabulous... Tart but not to tart and super refreshing in the hot weather.  I will make this again and again.  Made it exactly as the recipe said and I wouldn't change a thing.  I did use fresh limes and I know it had to be better than just using lime juice.  Kids weren't to sure about it.  Liked the initial taste but said it had an odd after taste.  I didn't get that at all. Of course husband had told them it was made with avocados so they were expecting it to be different.  I loved it and so did the husband.

So good.  I wish I made whipped cream for a topping. It would have made it even better.

Loved it! Did not use ice cream maker. I just put it in the freezer for a few hrs. Everyone loved it, no one believed it had avocado in it. I cut the sugar in half (personal choice)

I don't have a food processor so I tried to chop up the avocado using a blender.  That worked OK--I had thought the avocado might end up the consistency of cream cheese but it was chopped up into very fine pieces.  I then added the cream cheese to the blender and that was a disaster.  It really didn't mix with the avocado.  I ended up dumping the mixture into a bowl and used a fork to mix it.  I didn't use fresh lime juice  so used bottled.  I didn't have quite enough so added some bottled key lime juice.  I poured the mixture directly into a prepared crust and put in the freezer.  I brought it to a Christmas dinner.  My friend really liked it and said it tasted like key lime pie.  I concur.  I don't know that I would make this again.  I have made the Key Lime VII pie recipe from this site and that is easier and tastes the same if not better (although the VII recipe has more calories).

I made a thick gluten free crust and left the pie in the freezer for three months just topped with foil.  I thawed it completely and it turned out to be easiest cheesecake I ever made.

I used a blender and froze it in the blender and then added it to the pie crust. It was yummy!
