This dish is a meal in itself. I used panko for the breadcrumbs so the topping came out nice and crunchy. I also doubled the recipe 'cause all I could find here was a 29 oz can of hominy - I felt lucky to find that - most people in Central Oregon don't even know what hominy is!

I love hominy but always have a hard time finding a unique recipe for it. This one is perfect. Good as a side dish, or even for dipping chips. I altered it slightly. My husband dislikes olives with a passion so I subsituted about a 1/3 cup of mild green chilies. I also used red pepper instead of green since I was adding the green chilies. Even my 11 month old daughter loved it so I would say it's kid friendly as well.

I love it! Everytime I make it I just add in whatever veggies that I have on hand (have used shredded carrots, mushrooms, celery and tomatoes) and always turns out good. Also, I layer it in the bottom of a 11X7 casserole pan, and layer chicken breasts across the top and then add the bread crumbs. It bakes really well this way and comes out as the whole meal in a pan! :)

My husband and sons love this recipe and always scrape the pan clean.  I like it because it is so easy and quick to prepare.

This dish was very easy to prepare. The kids helped prepare it and they loved it. We served it with meatloaf muffins and fried cabbage. Very nice. Thanks
