Perfect! I made sure to blend the cream cheese first until it was light and fluffy, then slowly added the milk and made sure there were no lumps. Added the rest of the ingredients, and added a tsp of vanilla for additional kick. Served with fruit kabobs. Had to make 12 copies of the recipe for everyone at the office. Warning: you will want to eat this by the spoonful!

I made this fruit dip for my daughter's First Communion gathering. It was an absolute hit!! So fast, easy, and sinfully delicious. My mom even took some home to try on toast with peanut butter. She said it was great. Highly recommended.

I didn't have any vanilla pudding on hand so I used chocolate pudding instead. YUMMY! (especially with the bananas) I cut the powdered sugar to 1/2 cup and it was still sweet enough.  I think it would taste great on a chocolate cake for frosting and between layers.

Great party food!  This is my favorite fruit dip - so much better then the marshmallow fluff type.  Someone ALWAYS wants the recipe.  I use ff pudding/light cool whip/light cream cheese and 1% milk.  Great with fruit skewers of strawberries, canteloupe, pineapple.  Also great with apples.

This fruit dip is so smooth and not an overwhelming flavor.  I really enjoyed it with apples and red grapes.

This is absolutely incredible, and addicting!  I served the dip in a hallowed out pineapple and made fruit skewers of mellon balls, canteloupe balls, pineapple balls and grapes.  Everyone raved!

I made this dip for a graduation party this weekend, and I'm glad that I doubled the recipe.  It was such a hit.  Everyone was asking me what was in it, and could they have the recipe.  Great with cantaloupe, honey dew, and strawberries!

Sadly, this was not a hit for us. This has too much of the vanilla pudding flavor. Most of this went uneaten. We seem to prefer a marshmallow cream dip better. Thanks anyway.

I read some of the other reviews, and decided to use only 1/2 the sugar.  I also added about 2 teaspoons of maraschino cherry juice to try to add some color to the dip.  It turned out fantastic!  There are only a few comments I would like to add:  First, this makes a ton of dip.  I made this recipe in a 2.5 quart mixing bowl and it was nearly filled to the top with the dip.  Second, the color without the maraschino cherry juice is sort of a cream color.  The small amount of juice I added did very little to change the color, although it did impart some extra flavor.  Third, the dip does not have a very creamy consistency unless you leave it sit out for awhile before serving (say 30 minutes).  I made this the night before the party, and because of the Cool Whip in it, it stiffened up overnight in the fridge.  So just keep in mind that if you make the dip ahead of time and refrigerate it, you will probably want to sit it out a bit before you want to serve it.  Overall, this was an excellent recipe, and I received several good comments on it from my friends.  I will make it again.

This was pretty good.  It is very light and fluffy and not very sweet.  I used lemon pudding instead of vanilla.  I will make it again using vanilla.

This is the best fruit dip ever for strawberries or raspberries.  Be sure you whip the cream cheese with a little of the milk for a few minutes to soften and smooth it out before you add the other ingredients or you will end up with cream cheese lumps in the finished product.

This recipe is very simple but as far as flavor it was merely alright. I probably won't make this again.

Just made this for a luncheon for six women, halved recipe and there was still plenty left over (It makes alot), it was well complimented. If you microwave the cream cheese for 15 seconds or so it blends right in with all the other ingredients very easilly. I liked it too, and it was very easy to make, my kinda receipe.

Very tasty dip!  I served it at a party and got compliments on it all evening.  I added a pinch of nutmeg, a dash on cinnamon, and a bit of vanilla for extra flavor.

Sinfully delicious.  My children gobbled up so much good fruit as they dipped over and over again!  This stuff is great right out of the bowl.  It was MUCH tastier the day after it was made.  I made it with skim milk and reduced fat everything else, and it was awesome.  I also used about a half cup of confectioner's sugar instead of the full cup.  Definitely recommend, but if I'm serving to guests, would make it the night before to give the flavors more time to blend.

I used instant sugar free CHEESECAKE pudding mix, "lite" whipped topping, reduced fat cream cheese and fat free evaporated milk. In-sane. I served it with chunked pound cake, strawberries, blackberries, chunked kiwi, and pineapple. Nothing remains. We ate it all. Thanks so much, Valerie. We LOVED this.

I was disappointed in this recipe. I thought it was way too sweet. If I tried it again which I probably won't I would cut way back on the sugar. Robin

This was a great recipe, but I thought that it needed a little something.....so, I added some almond extract, cinnamon, and nutmeg to taste.  It was really yummy!  Also, this makes a lot of dip.  The recipe says that it serves 6, but after looking at the amount of ingredients I thought that it probably makes more than that. I tripled the recipe for a large party of 50-60 people and I had a lot left over.  I just stuck the leftovers in the freezer.

Turned out as I wanted it to!  Made some variations with this.  Instead of confectioners sugar, I did regular, and cut back on the pudding mix a little.  Turned out FANTABULOUS! Amazing.

Awesome!  I read the reviews and used extra creamy cool whip and whipped cream cheese.  Everyone loved it!!  Makes a huges batch though.  I suppose you could put some back in the cool whip container and freeze for later.

This is one of the best fruit dips I've ever had!  I made it for my son's baptism party last year, and it's been requested for this year's Memorial Day gathering.

We found that pineapple, canatloupe and strawberries were the best fruits to dip, but I'm sure you could try others.

This has become a staple at all the family gatherings.  I made this last year for a cookout.  Now when I ask what I need to bring, the answer is always the same, "That yummy fruit dip you brought last time".  Works for me, because it is so easy!  Thanks for the great recipe.

I served this recipe at my Dad's 60th birthday party over the weekend and it was so awesome!!!  I also used white chocolate pudding, my favorite, instead of vanilla, and served it with strawberries, honeydew melon, bananas dipped in lemon juice, and red grapes.  My husband said, "I give you permission to make this every night!"

I have never tasted anything so good!My family loved it. When I made the dip I didn't even have any fruit. We ate all of it befor I had the chance to buy any! We ate in on graham crackers mainly. They were a good snack for my son. I thought it was so good, I even caought myself eating it with a spoon! I definitely will make this recipe again. The only substitute I made was lowfat milk for the whole milk, way too much fat for me!

Cannot rave about this recipe enough!  I made it for a Tupperware party and everyone LOVED it.  A pregnant friend loaded up a plate of the dip just ate it with a spoon!  LOL  Really every single person at the party asked me for the recipe, it was the biggest hit (and one of the easiest things to make).  This recipe makes a generous helping but it was completely gone by the end of the night.  My toddler even loved it, she used it to dip everything into!  :o)  Probably the best recipe on allrecipes.com

I took this to a Thanksgiving dinner for extended family/friends. Everyone liked it including the kids. The only problem I had with it was that it was too much like pudding/custard. I was a bit disappointed to have to use *extra* ingredients. I could've just stuck with pudding mix.

With a few simple ingredients that I always have on hand, I can think of a few ideas for this!! I used this as a filling for "stuffed pancakes" with some strawberries on top and it was dee-licious! It's also good by the spoonful! ;)

It's the best fruit dip I've ever had!!!  I made it a little lower in carbs by using sugar free fat free vanilla pudding and Cool Whip Free.  It was great and I'll make it for years to come!

I really liked this although I found it really sweet.  I'll probably cut down the sugar by half or altogether next time (the pudding and the cool whip is sweet already).  I used whipped cream cheese to make stirring easier, and served this in the middle of a nice platter of green seedless grapes, strawberries and chopped pound cake - the strawberries and pound cake were the first to go, I may just go with those two next time.  Lemon pudding might be nice also.  I might also put in a drop or two of red food coloring next time also.  Before I left the house I left my brother with a whole bowl of strawberries and cream, and thought he might just eat all the strawberries but the cream was gone!

To make it a little healthier I use low fat or fat free cream cheese and fat free whipped cream.  I also use 2% milk.  It is still very good but you don't have to feel as guilty eating it.  We also have used different flavors of pudding in it. I have made it so many times I don't even have to look at the recipe anymore.

Yum, yum, and yum.  It was the first thing to go at the Super Bowl party, but luckily this recipe makes so much I was able to replenish the dish.  And when the fruit was gone some were still scooping up the dip with a spoon!  I liked that it made so much more than the fruit dip sold next to the fruit trays in our produce center and for about the same price! Someone mentioned it could be used a great center for a layer cake!  thanks!

This is a great fruit dip that is not overly sweet. I didn't wait long enough for the cream cheese to soften so it wasn't as smooth as it should have been, but no one was complaining. It is also great served with pound cake.

Great Recipe!  I used sugar-free pudding & fat free cream cheese & cut the sugar back to 1/2cup. I also added a sprinkle of ginger,cinnamon, vanilla & nutmeg for a little more flavor.

I made this and it was awesome.  I followed the other suggestions and beat the cream cheese and milk together first to eliminate the lumps and then I reduced the sugar to a 1/2 cup.  Like one of the other reviewers - I found myself just eating it by itself with a spoon!  Thanks.

Great stuff!!  Made this for my mother's 70th birthday party in August.  And I am still getting compliments and request's for this.  Put it next to the fruit platter, but no one knew what it was for.  They were putting it on the jello, and just eating it by itself.  Needless to say there was none left, and one guest took a bowl home.  Creaming the cream cheese is a must, or it will end up lumpy, but still delicious.  Thanks for a great recipe.

Very delicious - nice and rich without being too sweet.  I should have followed the advice of another commenter and whipped the cream cheese first, since mine came out a little lumpy, but beyond that this recipe is perfect.

I just made this with chocolate pudding (what I had on hand) and I think I could eat the whole bowl with a spoon, never mind the fruit!  I can't imagine vanilla pudding could be better, but this recipe is a keeper and I will try it with the vanilla eventually.  Thank you for posting a fruit dip that doesn't require marshmallow creme!

Best with apples.  Pineapple, and grapes tend to overpower the dip and you can't taste it much.  I though it was just okay but I did get a lot of requests for the recipe.

Delicious!  I've made this, by request, many times for family functions.  Make sure the cream cheese is totally softened or it will be lumpy in the dip.

Great fruit dip recipe!  Tastes better after a few hours in the fridge as it gets creamier.  This recipe is the best fruit dip - way better than the marshmallow/cream cheese combo.

I made this recipe for a retirement party and was sadly disappointed. The mixture was lumpy, sweet and simply tasted like pudding. I luckily had ingredients on hand to make something else. Sorry, but this recipe is awful.

I made this for an Easter brunch at church. It was awesome! Everyone loved it! I accidentally put 2 pkgs of cream cheese in, and used french vanilla pudding mix, because our grocery store was out of plain vanilla. It was still great! I, too, found myself eating it by the spoonful! :)

This recipe was really good. I made it with lowfat ingredients and took it to work, and there wasn't one bit left. My youngest daughter really loved it, and this is her request now when we make party food.

I was looking for more of a denser,cream cheesy taste.  My husband said this tasted like cake batter. The fact that most of it was ignored after one taste, and thrown out at the end of the gathering told the tale.

I made this for my Bunco Club last night and no one said a thing about liking it.  There was a lot left over.  I'd probably stick to my marshmallow fluff and cream cheese recipe.

I loved this dip! I did as previous reviewers suggested and only added 1/2 the sugar, added the 1/ tsp vanilla. I also used French vanilla pudding, 1% milk and FF cream cheese. It was good, but I still felt it was missing something so I added a dash of cinnamon. YUMMY. Everyone loved this dip!

I was nervous when I saw how much this made but it went so fast it's a good thing that there was so much!  It was great on fruit and the cookies we had at the party.  A nice change from the marshmallow recipes.

Oh My was this soo good. I made it Thanksgiving with a huge fruit platter.The Watermelon and cantalope were wonderful. I also put some clemantine tangerines on the platter. It reminded me of orange creamsicles. I beat the cream cheese with the milk first--no lumps. I also used 1/2 C. of the powdered sugar. It was wonderful, we ate i the next morning with breakfast.

I did not use any powdered sugar in this recipe.  I also substituted sugar-free pudding for the regular pudding and substituted half&half for the milk.  It came out really tasty and with my adjustments with a lot less carbs than the original recipe.  I have no idea why sugar is in the recipe..... it is perfectly delicious without it!

Loved this recipe. I cut down the confectionary sugar to keep it from being overly sweet. I made it to go with with fresh pineapple chunks ( from 2 pineapples), and cut the recipe in half. We had more than enough dip.

Absolutely one of the most requested foods for gatherings.  They use it on fruit, on my pumpkin bread and a spoonful in the mouth.  My family cannot get enough.

Second time's a charm! The first time, I mixed everything together at once, per the instructions and although it tasted great, the dip had tons of tiny cream cheese chunks, which I didn't like. The second time, I followed the reviewers who said to cream the cream cheese first, add milk slowly and go from there. I took it one step further, and found it to be perfect. Here's what I did in order. First, mix room temperature cream cheese until creamy. Then slowly add the milk, also warmed to room temperature so the shock of cold doesn't make the cream cheese start to solidify again. I then added half of the thawed whipped topping and vanilla pudding. Followed by the confectioner's sugar and remaining whipped topping, all the while, being stirred on low to medium setting in the Kitchenaide. Voila! Perfect, creamy vanilla dip that's good enough to eat with a spoon.

This was so simple but amazing at the same time. The kids loved it...they ate all of their fruit. I used a variety of fruits and it went with all; blueberries, raspberries,strawberries, bananas, mango. And best of all it is still amazing the next day!

I made a fruit salad with strawberries, blueberries, red grapes, & bananas sprinkled with a little sugar and lemon juice.  I wanted to kick it up a notch for company by adding a fruit dip.  This was a huge hit with my family - and I got bonus points with my Father-In-Law who loved it.  It was creamy and very tasty.  Thanks for the recipe!

I made this for co-workers because of the good reviews...but it didn't go over well.  Only about 1/4 of the dip was eaten...won't make this again.

I made this last year for my daughter's birthday and found this to be an excellent base to start. I left out most of the sugar and added vanilla yogurt to get more of a fruit dip instead of dessert. Still on the sweet side and extremely popular, and had lots of compliments!

This was my first time making this kind of fruit dip. I generally use a sour cream based dip. It was a huge hit at our church pot luck. I had a tray of strawberries and used chocolate pudding instead of vanilla it was yummy. Thank you for sharing this one with us.

I've made this a ton of times and it always goes so fast.  Everyone loves it and says they can eat it without any fruit!  This is so much better than the dips with marshmallow fluff!  Followed other's suggestions and beat cream cheese and milk first.  Awesome dip!

This is so tasty.  It makes a huge amount but I plan to explore how it tastes on things other than fruit... maybe as a cake icing or filling.  It is sweet but not overpowering.

This was  pleasant but one has to lower the sugar content as it is very sweet. I was thinking that I may try another pudding mix next time perhaps banana!

I was very excited to try this recipe but had a few problems with it. Even after mixing it in my KitchenAid mixer, there were tiny cream cheese lumps throughout that I had a hard time getting rid of. I also thought the dip had a bit of an artifical taste - not sure if that was from the pudding or the whipped topping; I added a dash of vanilla and thought that helped. My husband on the other hand loved it and was eating it out of a bowl with a spoon - no fruit. He would give the recipe at least four stars. I think kids would really love this recipe - good way to get them to eat their fruit.

The more I eat this fruit dip, the more I love it!  Very creamy and if you use fat free milk, cream cheese, and cool whip, you are left feeling a little less guilty!  Best with strawberries.

A delicious way to eat more fruit.  I used sugar-free vanilla pudding, light cool-whip, and light cream cheese.  There is no need to add the sugar but I need include ¼ teaspoon of vanilla extract.  Be sure to whip the cream cheese with the pudding and milk before adding the frozen topping. You may have to add more milk for the desired consistency. I used the following fruit: strawberries, raspberries, cantaloupe, bananas and kiwi.  A big hit that evening and again for breakfast.

This was really good!  The only change I made was when I went to the store to get the pudding mix a decided to try something different and got the white chocolate mix instead of vanilla.  It was an excellent choice!  Everyone loved it.  Goes well with strawberries or apples.

This was quick and easy, not to mention absolutely delicious! The folks at work tore into it and ate it all up almost as soon as I brought it in (it's a good thing I kept some at home!). I highly recommend using a mixer- it is almost impossible without one!
