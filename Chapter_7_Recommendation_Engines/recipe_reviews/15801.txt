I am not a big fan of chicken salad, but I loved this.  We made some small changes: red grapes, Miracle Whip instead of mayo, doubled the portion of grapes, and sliced the cheese super small so there wouldn't be giant chunks.  For an extra treat, have on croissants!

This was good, but Hubby said he likes our regular chicken salad better.

Absolutely delicious!  That comes from someone who doesn't (or didn't) like chicken salads!

This is great (I can't wait for lunch to have my chicken salad on a croissant with fresh lettuce and tomato).  I added about 1 tbsp. mustard and a few diced scallions.  I also used fresh parm instead of cheddar and only added about 1/4 of a cup, and I substituted pecans for the sunflowers.  Thank you Brenda!

This is pretty good, but I think next time I will change a couple of things, such as less mayo and I will chill it before eating it.

Wow this is super good and easy. I love trying out different chicken salads for the summer and this is going on the list. The flavors are so unique and unexpected. I love the crunchy sunflower seeds and the sweet grapes. I served mine in a wheat pita. Thanks for sharing!!!

This was fantastic. A great cool sandwich for the summer. The sunflower seeds and grapes complimented each other.  I used shredded cheese in this instead of cubes so we didn't get just a bite of cheese.  I also left out the celery.

Just okay. I used sharp cheddar and left out the grapes. I did add just a tbsp. of white wine dijon and onion/garlic powder. I spread this on potato bread. NOTE: This is best eaten right after you make it. It's really unappealing the next day.

Loved this recipe!  I'm not a huge fan of sunflower seeds so I substituted them with pinenuts.  Even my husband loves it and he doesn't ever like anything with mayo

Very good on whole wheat bread or over spring mix salad.  I left out the cheddar cheese and increased the celery and grapes.

I made this for lunch one day and my children only picked out the grapes and ate that.  My husband ate it but said the grapes just didn't go.  Won't be making this again.

This was pretty good.  I didn't have cubed cheddar, so I used shredded and I also didn't use the celery just because I forgot. Even with my slight alterations, it was pretty good though. I made dill whole wheat bread and put it on there, yum!

Just tried it and it tastes very nice. I love the idea of grapes - gives fresh taste to chicken and cheese (I'd use apples but grapes definitely nicer). I had no sunflower seeds used crashed walnut instead. Thank you!

Excellent. I am not a celery fan so I added dill pickles. I used canned chicken as I was in a bind for a appetizer for a party. Tons of compliments.

Delicious!!!  Let me give you one good tip though.....Chicken salad is a really big hit here in the South!  Roast your chicken to cook it!  I bought split breasts, poured on some olive oil, salt/pepper and let it roast for about 2hrs.  This makes it even better!!! Wonderful recipe!

5 stars BUT I made modifications, but I love it the way I made it!  I used dried cranberries instead of the grapes. I also used 3/4 tsp lemon pepper instead of salt and pepper.  Also I only had sliced cheese, so I cut that into small pieces and the size of cheese was great. Small enough not to be overwhelming in a bite, but didn't get "lost" like shredded cheese can. I served it on a croissant! It was awesome!

Very nice, easy lunch today.  I used red grapes, shredded mild cheddar cheese, and Miracle Whip.  We all loved the the sunflower seeds.  Served on Honey Wheat Buns and homemade Potato Chips from this site. Thanks for posting, Brenda Loop.

I made this last summer!  It was very good.  I made it for playgroup and all the moms loved it.  I'll have to make it again soon.  I just came across the recipe, recognized it, went to see how I reviewed it, and realized I hadn't.  I wonder how many other recipes I forgot to rate and review...

I just made this for lunch.  Awesome - only change I made was to add a bit more grapes and I used shredded cheddar as I didn't have a block to cube.  Definitely looking forward to the chilled leftovers on my salad for dinner tonight!

Very good! I used vanilla nonfat Greek yogurt instead of mayo and I chilled it for a couple of hours before eating.

UPDATE: 2/22/13 -  Tried this recipe again because I wanted to give it another review when I had the actual ingredients listed. Well I did today, with the exception of the fact that I used canned chicken again(couldn't be helped), so it was only about 1 1/2 cups worth. My original concern about this was how it would taste because I/we don't ever use mayo. Well, this recipe is truly the exception to that rule. It's still delicious and definitely still a five star recipe in my book. Thnx Brenda because now I have two new ways to wow people with chicken salad.
