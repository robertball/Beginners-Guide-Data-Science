I was somewhat disappointed with this recipe after seeing all of the rave reviews.  I decorate cakes for a side job and I had a customer who wanted a really good homemade yellow cake for her husband's birthday.  I don't get a request for a yellow cake very often so I went looking for a recipe and found this one.  I made one for me to try at the same time I made the one to decorate.  I did not overbake the cake, followed the directions as is and it came out dry, heavy and very crumbly.  The flavor was fair but the texture was awful.  I ended up brushing the customer's cake with a vanilla simple syrup and coating it with a glaze before icing it in hopes it would taste better and hold up better.  I was hoping for a fluffy, tasty cake but this was not it.  I will not make this again.

I made this cake for my son's 3rd birthday. As others have said, it is very dense and heavy. It was also very moist and tasted great. Everyone at the party loved it. I did have to bake it for almost twice as long as recommended in the recipe but it was worth the wait. I will definitely make it again for a friend's birthday in a few weeks time.

I ran late and needed to bake a cake just as the guests were arriving, so had to make shortcuts. I softened the butter in the microwave and mixed the eggs in without separating them and the cake still turned out great!  I did have to lower the oven temperature to 300 after 15 mins though, since I saw that the cake was browning too much on top and was still undone inside (convection air oven).  It also make a huge cake and would have overflowed had I not used as big a cake pan as I did.  I sifted cocoa powder over it (quick and less fattening than frosting and anyway the cake was still warm and would've melted any frosting!) and it looked elegant.  The guests loved it!  Very buttery smooth and just as delicious the next day after refridgeration.  Great recipe since it uses basic ingredients on hand that one could just throw in one go.  This is a keeper!!!

This cake came out beautifully, but I only gave it 4 stars because I had to make a lot of adjustments. First of all, make sure to soften the butter before you mix it. This makes it easier to work with and helps melt the sugar. Secondly, I would decrease the amount of sugar in this recipe by about half a cup because it turned out very sweet. Thirdly, I had to add an extra half cup of milk to the recipe to smooth out the batter. And lastly, it was necessary for me to increase the cooking time by an extra 20 minutes before it was done. However, with all of those adjustments, the cake turned out very moist, fluffy and sweet. I will definitely make this again!

This is the best birthday cake in the world and I have made a lot of cakes.  Use real butter if you can!  It rises beautifully and is of perfect texture.  I used a cream chees icing.  One 8 oz. block cream cheese,  1/2 cup marg. 1tsp. vanilla and about 4 cups icing sugar.  YUMMY!!  Thanks for the recipe.

This year I wanted to make my grand daughters birthday cake and I used this recipe. I must say it was very delicious. I added my own frosting but overall I had enough cake to feed everyone at the party and the best part of it was that they all thought I brought it from a bakery. They ate all of the cake the same night so two days later I made another one.

I don't know why some others say it is packy.  If you follow the recipe to the letter, it comes out great.  Be sure you are sifting your flour/baking powder mixture, and fluffing your egg whites.  Thanks for the keeper!!

great cake. I used it to make my son's birthday train cake, inside a Wilton train pan. When I cut off the extra from the top and tried it, it tasted great! I did alter it a bit though, I used almond extract instead of vanilla, and I used buttermilk instead of milk. great recipe!!!

I made this cake for my daughter's birthday.  It was dry but it didn't taste too bad.  I was afraid that it might.  It came out of the oven smelling like an omlet.  I had high hopes because of the other reviews but I was so disappointed.  I had lots of people at the party who I'm afraid thing I'm a bad cook now.  At least the icing I made to go on it made it taste better. I won't make it again.

This birthday cake is absolute perfection... first time to make it, followed the directions exactly. I was able to make a 2-tier cake with this recipe (one 10" round & one 8" round). Cooked 45 mins. convection oven (the 8" was done at 35 mins).  I covered the cake with sliced fresh strawberries (mixed strawberries in organic yogurt), bananas, kiwi and spread melted chocolate only on outside of bottom layer.  The cake itself was not too sweet, so the toppings I had added complimented it perfectly that everyone at the BDay party wanted 2nds. (please see my photo)

Hey guys, this is a good recipe....I have a business and a client was looking for a white/yellow cake base with strawberry filling and a buttercream frosting. THIS IS IT!!! This cake reminds me a lot of another coconut cake I make that I get lots of rave reviews for. This will be the cake I use for children's parties and adults as well!! Thank you Carol for the recipe!

Tried this recipe because our town bakery stopped making cakes on weekends, my daughter turned one on a Sunday and I was not going to make a box cake for her 1st birthday. I must say I was scared to death, my family can be harsh and everyone has as opinion. Started the cake on the morning of the party, set it out to cool. My sister recommended injecting it with rasberry preserves, we made a basic butter cream icing, layered it with icing and thin layer of rasberry preserves. 3 layers in all. sprinkled white chocolate over the top. We put pink decorative icing on the top and a beautiful pink candle. I was so nervous when we sang Happy Birthday and we cut the cake.  Everyone started to compliment me, and I was dubbed the official birthday cake maker from now on. My husband said that the cake made our little one's special day even better. Thanks for posting the recipe that made my husband proud of me and my efforts. I feel bad that I had never attempted making a cake for our 16yr old all these years. If you need a great tasting cake try this recipe. Highly recommend it.

I used this recipe each week while attending a cake decorating class and it turned out great each time. The secret is folding in those hard egg white before baking- I noticed a big change when I missed that step.

This cake was delicious- a nice, slightly dense, moist cake.  It was actually my first layer cake (so I followed all steps carefully), and it baked very well.  I made it with Lemon Cream Cheese Frosting (also submitted by Carol)- yum.  I will definitely be making it again!

I really needed this recipe to work since I'd promised to make my friend a birthday cake and I hadn't made one from scracth in years - and it didn't disappoint!  I used self-raising flour instead of plain flour (I think that's what's mean by all-purpose?) and caster sugar because I am so bad at mixing out lumps... The result was a dream. It was the lightest cake I've ever tasted and had a beautiful taste to it. Everyone loved the cake and asked for the recipe, so I pointed them towards this one. Thanks a lot!  It was divine.

This recipe did not work for me.  It smelled like an omelette and tasted like flour.  It had the consistancy of a pound cake and was very dry.  I followed the directions precisely.  I will not use this one again

I wouldn't suggest it for a kids birthday cake as it is a little to eggy and not really sweet enough for a children's birtday cake.  Overall, this was a pretty yummy dessert!

Literally tasted like a store-bought birthday cake, but fluffier and lighter.  Really good recipe for a basic easy to make birthday cake.

Delicious!  I use this all the time now for family birthdays, alternating with the Black Magic Cake, also on this site.  Be sure to follow directions as far as adding the beaten egg whites separately.  I sometimes substitute 1 cup of canned coconut milk for the milk, and use the frosting from Coconut Cake II from this site, also using coconut milk in place of regular milk.  Thanks, Carol, for this recipe!

I made this for my brother's birthday yesterday and topped it with Chocolate Frosting I, also on this site. It was great! My whole family loved it, one person saying "This is definately better than boxed cake!" I'm not a fantastic baker, I can admit it, but this was easy enough for me. It was worth the extra work of whipping the egg whites because it made the cake nice and moist. And yes, it does smell like an omelet coming out of the oven as others have mentioned, but it does NOT taste like one!

Turned out good...very heavy but good, sweet and pretty.  Similar taste to pound cake.  Worked for making a princess cake for my 4 yr old.

This was delicious. I made it using vegan substitutions and it still turned out fantastic. It is dense, and it did take about twice the baking time as recommended (about 50 min to an hour) but it was moist and exactly what I wanted. I used butterscotch flavoring in the cake for a little extra something and almond flavoring in my frosting.

After reading the reviews I decided to give this cake a try for my daughters 18th birthday. I did cut down on the sugar by 1/2 a cup and increased the milk by 1/3 cup approx. I too had to increase the cooking time by 20-25 minutes. The end result was a light yet firm, fluffy textured evenly colored sponge. I will def. keep this recipe.

This cake is really good. I use the "Wedding Cake Frosting" recipe for this cake. Sometimes I use almond extract instead of the vanilla.

The first time I made this, it came out very dense.  I had listened to a reviewer who said you don't have to bother separating the eggs.  This time around I followed the directions, and it came out beautifully.  Light and moist with a great texture.  I added a second tsp. of vanilla, and it had a wonderful flavor.  This is my new favorite yellow cake recipe.  Thank you!

I made this cake in a 9x13. I made it exactly the way it read except a added just a small amount (didn't measure) of milk at the end because the batter was REALLY thick. The only thing that I noticed was that after 30 minutes at 350 the knife came out covered in raw batter. The cake was quite dark at the point so I turned the oven down to 300 and cooked another 10 minutes. Came out of the pan pretty well. I haven't had a piece yet but the crumbs were tasty and my 2 year old son pinched a chunk out of itand wanted more more more! This cake does seem very dense but I don't know why that would be a bad thing.

I made this cake for my husband,  I just wanted something to put on the table for Valentine's.  I read the reviews but made the recepie as is.  It was DELICIOUS.  My hubby LOVED IT.  I don't think it came out dense because I made it exactly like the recepie.  I did however did only half of ingredients since it was only for two but seriously it was pretty big, it could have been for 10 people having big pieces!  So, plan for that, it can overflow like other reviewers said.   It rose beautifully, very fluffy. Try it with italian meringue, yuuummmm!

I made this at the last minute tonight as a surprise for my husband's birthday and it turned out great!!!  I actually cut the recipe in half to make one medium sized cake and I still had to bake it for a good 35 minutes, but in the end it was perfect, light but moist...  I topped it with a simple buttercream icing and end result=hubby ate 3 pieces :)

Amazing cake!!  Made three round 8" cakes, and added red food coloring to the middle layer to make it pink, as well as swirled in a bit of dry cocoa, then completely copied another reviewer by using raspberry preserves (mixed with crushed, frozen raspberries) between each of the layers, icing it with the pro ganache from this site, and then using raspberries on top and to decorate the base.

It turned out VERY good!  The cake wasn't too heavy/sweet, but was balanced nicely with the fruit, and the whole thing was delicious. And, although people say this all the time on this site (haha), my sister actually said, "This could be store-bought," then corrected herself and said it was better than a store-bought cake!

It was for my mom's birthday and she loved it =).

Tastes a little buttery but it's light and exactly what I was looking for to make a birthday cake. I used some spreadable fruit (raspberry) between the layers and poured the "Pro-Ganache" over it (recipe from this site - that is SOOO good!) and decorated with fresh raspberries. Simple and awesome!!

I made this for my mum's birthday, and had many compliments about it!  It was beautiful spread with fresh whipped cream and topped with sliced strawberries and pansies.  Next time I'd make two layers, and sandwich them together with raspberry jam or cooled custard.

I like this recipe for a birthday cake and it tastes great! If you make it properly, it is light, soft with texture resembling a chiffon cake. I also tried it on as cupcakes, changed the flavor to cheese and added 1 cup of grated cheddar cheese and I had cheese cupcakes. I also tried it with cinnamon powder and I had cinnnamon cupcakes. All of these I served during my daughter's birthday party and everyone loved it! Thanks Carol.

This is a great cake recipe! We made cupcakes, as that is what my daughter wanted for her birthday. We added colored sprinkles for confetti cupcakes. The texture is lovely - similar to a cake mix but without disintegrating, as I find is the case with cakes made from mix. As for the egg smell and taste that other reviewers mentioned, I didn't find that at all. I did, however, use a generous amount of quality vanilla. My suggestion to those who found it under-cooked in the middle, is to reduce temperature down to approximately 323 C for a few extra minutes (after the initial cooking time.) This allows the middle to fully cook without browning the bottom and edges. (I frequently do this with banana loaves, as well.) This is my new go-to recipe for birthday cakes!

OH Wow!! This cake is great! Very TASTY,SWEET and had a good density. Close to a pound cake kind of dense. I frosted it just with Cool Whip and made a simple strawberry sauce but it didn't need it at all, altho tasted great together! Definitely a keeper for birthday cakes or anytime you want a special and very simple cake :)

This cake has been a total disappointment.  This is my first time making it and it totally crumbled.  I don't even have a cake.  I made it for my daughter's B-Day.  The taste is really good, but no way can it be made into a cake.  I will need to skip on this cake since I have no idea how to even fix it.

The cake was good. I have not made a cake in years and I had fun making this one. I did what other people did and used almond and buttermilk. I also used an Elmo pan so I had to double the cooking time also. The cake is a thicker cake and is sweet as others say. I also loved eating the edges I cut off. They were very good warm. It was very easy to decorate. It seems the cake had a good "crust" all over elmos face. I iced it with pretubed icing. It looked awesome. I refrigerated it for the next day....we pretty much ate it straight from the fridge so I think the cake was too cold n the icing was harder than I'd like. For the next birthday party I would do a lighter batter..this one was good tho just not good for birthdays. I think doing something with strawberries would be perfect for this recipe. Will do again and would suggest to others but make a practice one so I understand the taste. Also adding a filling would be so good!

This recipe was awesomeeeeeeeee!!! I used it for my son´s birthday cake in a Wilton Elmo pan and turned out perfect. I did cook it longer though. No one believed me that it was a homemade cake. I made cup cakes and the batter was great for that too. Definitely a keeper.

Edible, but BARELY.  Brick-like comes to mind.  Very heavy and dense.  It'd be more like a bread than a cake, if breads were even this heavy.   Cooking time per recipe instructions is waaaaay off.  At 35 minutes, the batter was still soupy.  I had to double the time.    Lesson learned the hard way with this recipe... always test a recipe before serving at a function.  :(

Just like some of the other reviewers I found this cake to be very dense and the recipe a bit difficult to work with.  I followed the recipe to the letter but found the batter quite thick before folding in the whites so I added a lot (1/2 C +) more milk as others suggested.  I'm giving it 3 stars because the taste was good enough for me to give the recipe another try.

This is now our official birthday cake recipe!  So yummy delish! It is so buttery and is not too sweet just perfect. It is so light and fluffy I am not sure why others said it was heavy.  Someone said it was dry and crumbly, all I can think of is that they whipped the eggwhites too much.  This recipe makes great cupcakes too!  When I made it the cake rose up but as it was cooling fell inward a little bit, but that did not effect the taste. Heavenly!

This is a great recipe.  I made two batches for my son's 2nd birthday.  One was in a 9x13 pan and the other in a Wilton 3-D Cruiser cake pan, both came out great, though the one in the Wilton pan took about 30 minutes longer in the oven.  The only change I made was to add about a half teaspoon of almond extract to each cake.  Delicious!  Will make again.

I do not consider myself an expert baker, but my daughter warmed my heart when she asked me to bake her 5th Birthday cake myself.  I was looking for an easy cake recipe.  This cake was easy to make & had a great taste-I received lots of compliments on it!  I used the recipe for the wedding cake icing from this website & just added water until I got a spreading consistency that I liked.

This is my first homemade birthday cake. I cut the recipe in half to make a smaller cake, and used 1/2c sugar and 1/2c splenda then followed the rest of the recipe exactly. Put 'Quick Fudge Icing' on top, IT TURNED OUT WONDERFUL!

True it was heavy and pretty dry, but it was also tasty and served very well the purpose I needed it for. I wouldn't use this recipe for just any occasion, but in need of a cake sturdy enough to support heavy fillings and decorations: jelly layers, buttercream icing, marzipan cover and decorations, etc... it was great.

This cake was alright!  It dries out very quickly though even though I was keeping it sealed in a cake pan. It was also very crumbly and I followed the directions exactly. How can I keep it moist the next time I make it?

THIS IS THE SECOND TIME I HAVE BAKED THIS CAKE. FIRST TIME IT MUST HAVE WEIGHED 50 LBS. AND IT WAS NOT A SUCCESS.THIS WAS ALSO MY FIRST CAKE FROM SCRATCH I EVER BAKED AND I KINDA PACKED THE FLOUR INTO THE MEASURING CUP :) THIS TIME IT WAS MUCH, MUCH BETTER. IT WAS JUST RIGHT EXCEPT I CANT EVER GET IT TO BAKE RIGHT..I BAKED IT FOR 50 MINS. AT 350. THE MIDDLE STARTED TO CRACK AND THE EDGES WERE VERY BROWN. SO THE CAKE IS KIND OF DRY NOW...BUT IT TASTES SOOOO GOOD. I WILL EAT IT BUT THE REST OF THE FAMILY WILL PRETEND TO BE CHOKING ON IT CAUSE ITS DRY.

This was kind of a weird recipe. It wasn't really what I was looking for. It wasn't too sweet, and it was very dense. It is probably a great cake for a strawberry shortcake dessert, but I am not sure about a birthday cake. Of course, I couldn't use this as the birthday cake that I was baking for my best friend, because I dropped half of it on the floor when I turned it out of its pan. I guess it was a good thing that happened, because I was able to go for another yellow cake recipe that was more of what I was looking for.

Hands down, this recipe beats a store bought cake mix by a mile!  I have never prepared a "from scratch" cake before, but after having "Happy Birthday Cake," I'll probably never buy a store bought cake mix again.  Though this recipe was more dense than a store bought mix, I prefer it that way.  And the flavor and texture was simply amazing.  I used "Wedding Cake Frosting" as another reviewer suggested, and the match was absolutely perfect.  My wife loved it!

I made this cake for my sons birthday and it was amazing. Since I used fresh vanilla instaed of the extract it actually tastes like Vanilla ICE-CREAM! Kids LOVED IT! Thank you for posting it.  Also it didn't do the separate egg thing and it still turned out wonderful

Very stable and tasty.  Mine took a bit longer to cook than the time stated.  It was worth the extra effort to whip the egg whites.  The cake rose very nicely and made a lovely birthday cake.

I had to rate this at the top for each category, because for a "from scratch" cake, this is quick and easy -- Betty Crocker can't match it.  If you follow the instructions and don't overwhip the egg whites (should be just able to stand up on the end of the beaters, but shouldn't resemble the early stages of styrofoam (!).  I made this in three 9-in. layers and used my own "throw-together" buttercream icing.  I made it two weeks before my daughter's 2nd birthday to test it and it passed -- she ate a big piece (she doesn't eat sweets, generally) and the party guests gave generous compliments.  This is THE ONLY yellow cake recipe for me.

It was alright for my first attempt at a scratch cake but it was dry and didn't have much flavor. It wasn't yellow at all just looked white. I think I might try another recipe.

Dry. Believe the reviews! 
I made it exactly as written, and I guess I was hoping for the yellow cake equivalent of the Black Magic cake. It wasn't. The flavour was good but it just had a kind of chewy texture, not crumbly, but like a dry pound cake. It was still edible, of course, but not the birthday cake I was hoping for. Definitely will not make again... oh well.

Made with no changes.  Turned out very heavy and dry and pretty boring flavor.  I probably should have sifted all the flour so that's probably on me.  Would not risk making again though.  : (

So good! Not often that a layer cake gets eaten and has ppl nearly fighting for more. Non dessert eaters also eating 2 pieces says a LOT. I will make this again!!! I used the whipped cream frosting on this site.

I make cakes as a part time job and after finding this recipe a few years ago have never used anything else if asked for a vanilla sponge cake...its tasty, fluffy, cuts and shapes well and has ALWAYS had rave reviews.
The only thing I have changed is that I use self raising flour as opposed to plain flour and baking powder and I reduce the heat slightly, other than that its to the letter.

Baked this twice and it was denser than I thought. I didn't separate the eggs the second time but got similar results. I would add more vanilla extract (maybe a tablespoon) for more flavor. However it pairs nicely with light whipped cream and some berries :)

I'm baking these cupcakes for my daughter’s birthday party this year.  We did a test run and she loved them so much that she wants me to make extras so her friends to take one home with them.  Very moist and yummy!  I used the Betty Crocker homestyle frosting and turned out perfect.

I checked online and found that Box and Wrap was a great place to get cupcake boxes.  I have stickers, markers, and crayons so the kids decorate their own cupcake box.  At least the extra baking will keep me from buying party favors to give the kids.

I made this cake a couple years ago and did not like it and vowed to never make it again. Then, Yesterday, I went looking for a highly rated birthday cake recipe and came across this one again. Not realizing this was the same one we intensely disliked previously, I made it again. Very Very dense. Not recommended.

It was just ok, more like angle food cake.   I used bakers sugar and cake flour in hopes of a light and fluffy cake.  I did not want a  dense cake like others spoke of- No luck.

Cake turned out perfect, dense and delicious!  Followed the recipe exactly, however I did have to bake a 9x13 pan for almost 50 minutes before it was done, I think the smaller pans would cook faster.

Followed to a T and ended up with a heavy dry yellow cake.  Perhaps it is the milk choice as I used a 2% milk?  If there is a next time I will try whole fat milk.  However, I took about 1/3rd of this cake and added two unsweetened chocolate baking squares and 1/2 cup sugar in order to make it a marble cake and also two all chocolate muffins... the chocolate portion of the cake was delicious!

Great Cake! I made this cake for the first time for my boyfriend's birthday and he (and his family) loved it! His mother even asked how long I have been baking and asked if I would make one for her birthday! I didn't exactly follow the recipe to a tee but it still came out incredible. Great texture, not too sweet and just moist enough. I did a buttercream icing which complimented the cake very well. Will definitely use this recipe over and over again!

My 16 year old daughter Hannah followed the directions exactly and it turned out a lovely color in the sheet pan & tasted even better.  Very old fashioned and satisfying. We didn't even frost it! Thanks to Carol & your mom as well for an old fashioned cake that has body, richness, texture, and superb vanilla essence.

This cake was very good. It had almost a cornbread texture but tasted great. I would say however to not use this recipe for cupcakes because there is so much butter in the batter that it makes the cupcake paper VERY greasy.

Great tasting cake that holds up well for decorating.  I added a touch of almond extract to the batter then, as someone suggested, topped it with wedding cake icing.  I spread raspberry preserves between the layers and covered the sides of the cake with almonds.  It turned out pretty and delicious!

I made this for my daughters birthday and used a white frosting with some white chocolate chips and strawberries mixed in.  It was more the texture of pound cake, I thought that sounded yummy, but it was the texture of pound cake with out the flavor of cake.  I think this would make great strawberry shortcake!

The only thing I changed was not separating the eggs and using 1/2&1/2. I just whipped it a little longer before adding dry and wet ingred.'s. Cake came out most. I placed the cake wrapped in the freezer before frosting. This helps it not to crumble.

This is not a birthday cake by any traditional sense.  You may eat it on your birthday, but it's not fluffy at all.  It came out more like a pound cake than a birthday cake.  Also, the batter overflowed my 9*13 baking dish, so I'd skim off about 3 tablespoons before pouring.  Otherwise, it's a good pound cake imitation if you put another teaspoon of vanilla for flavor.

This is very similar to a pound cake recipe.  Firm, slices great without crumbling.  I made double the recipe and used the other rounds for strawberry short cake.

Followed the recipe and it was suprisingly easy. Put lemon frosting on(luscious buttercream frosting recipe using lemon alternative).  One suggestion-if you're baking this as a sheet cake turning the pan about half to three quaters of the way thru cooking will help with more even baking. Mine was over done on one end and it took about 50 min. to cook probably would have been less flipping the pan.

My family doesn't like too much sweet in their desserts so this cake was perfect.  I made it for my sister's birthday and everyone loved it.  The only thing which I didn't like was that the bread was too thick - but that's just my opinion.  If you are looking for a light fluffy cake, this is not the cake to make.  But if you are looking for something with just a hint of sweetness, this cake is perfect.

Not bad. Uesed a 9x13 pan. Didn't have regular butter, used unsalted butter. I am not good at whipping egg whites so I added the eggs whole. I would make this recipe again.

This cake turned out like a tonne of bricks!  Luckily I baked it early enough before my husband's birthday that I could quickly whip up a Betty Crocker cake to substitute so I could keep my "Martha Stewart" reputation!  I had to throw this cake out.  I followed the directions exactly!  I even whipped the egg whites properly (what a pain!).  Won't try it again.

I made this recipe for my daugther's birthday last week.  This is the best yellow cake that I have made from scratch. Very moist with good flavor.

I followed the directions to the tee, came out a bit dry and not very sweet. Luckily, the frosting I made was super sweet and balanced out the cake.

This was very good! I didn't bother with whipping the whites. If you want to save on time I really don't find it a pertinent step. I ended up with a cake that was soft but held shape for pan removal and decorating. It wasnt as dense as shown in the photo. You should really try it!

Smells and probably will taste great but it really doesn’t fill-up a 9x13 pan very well, even with it rising to double height.  I bake a lot and was super-accurate following the quantities and directions.  Also, the stated cooking time (25 mins) was way too long and my oven is calibrated.

I used this recipe to make a tandy cake for my 3 grandkids.  While I wouldn't say I am a professional baker, I have made cakes that have sold for hundreds of dollars. I am always looking to try new recipes but this one was so bad, my grandkids wouldn't eat it. It was very dense, dry and flavorless....at least to my standards. I would not make again.

It is a good recipe, as well easy to make.. My adjustment, add an extra half cup of milk to avoid its hardness... Also decrease amount of sugar to half because the current value is sugary to me... In addition to that...after I finish the mix process and just after adding the egg white I add a dry fruit... Overall... It is easy good cake to make

I accidentally doubled the butter and the batter looked more like dough, but I went ahead and baked it anyway and I’m glad I did because it was still delicious! It’s a bit crumbly but still moist. I can’t wait to try it again properly lol

This is a very good cake!  I did make one adjustment.  1 teaspoon of flavoring didn’t seem like enough so I added one more teaspoon of almond flavoring.  If you do not like almond you could just use 2 teaspoons of vanilla.  My cake did stick a little.  I will use parchment to line the bottom of my pans next time.  This is a very dense, moist cake.

I made this cake on a very quick last-minute idea the cake comes out very fluffy very dense. I thought the batter tasted amazing.... haven't tried the cake yet it's for a birthday. The times were perfect for me using 6 inch pans and a 6 inch bundt pan

I was looking for a cake for my son's birthday party. I chose to follow the instructions to the letter rather than make any adjustments I read about in the reviews.  It came out perfect! The texture was at first like a cross between an angel food cake and a pound cake. After sitting a day it settled to the exact texture of birthday cake. It's moist and study,  rich in flavor not too sweet. I made a cream cheese frosting to go with it and it paired perfectly. I did have to bake it almost twice as long, I think it's supposed to go in a half sheet pan, I just had a 9x13. Unfortunately I am not up to the task of making enough cake for 30+people, so we will buy a pre-made (I'm not yet a skilled decorator either!) but this will be my birthday cake recipe from now on! I will be passing this on to my children's children!

This was my very first time making cake from scratch, I followed all the steps(except used organic products when I could) and I think it came out great. Tasted good, my family was happy. I did however put too much batter in  the pan. Didn't know about the rising part. So it was two layers, instead of three.  I also did not let it cool down long enough. Looking forward to trying again.

I wish I could rate this cake higher, as I made it because of the five-star reviews. I followed the recipe, used three, nine-inch cake pans, and baked it for 30 minutes. It raised up beautifully, so I had lovely, high cake - and it was a wee bit overdone with crustier top and sides than I wanted (I should have checked it at 25 minutes and pulled it out then), a bit too dry, and it didn't have much taste. With a lemon cream cheese frosting it tasted fine - my guests enjoyed it and complimented me on it - but I was expecting something denser, moister, and more flavorful. I wasn't worried about the bake time because other reviewers indicated they needed to bake it longer...and that was not my experience. In hindsight though, I'd bake it for a shorter time. Honestly cannot think of anything else I'd do differently.

I made no changes, it wasn't hard to make, though beating the egg whites took awhile. The cake was very heavy and didn't have that great of a flavor. It is nowhere near a "light and fluffy" cake if that is what you are looking for. I won't make it again.

I added a little extra vanilla. Other than that I followed the recipe  exactly and it turned out great. I was looking for a basic birthday cake recipe that didn't come out of a box. All of the party guests loved it and some asked for the recipe.  I've made it twice now. The first time it seemed a little complex and I seemed to use every bowl in my kitchen. The second time I was able to be a little more efficient and it took less time and fewer bowls.

I made this cake for my daughter's birthday,  exactly as  recipe, it came out awesome. It was not as dense as every one says, it came out extremely soft and fluffy. You can really see the difference if you separate the eggs as directed.  I used 2 9in bakers baking pans, which worked awesome. My only problem is my cake started falling apart. I'll use parchment paper in the bottom of my pans.  Other than it came out great.

I sort of made this- I am gluten & dairy free, but usually just substitute the things I need to rather than look for "gluten/dairy free" recipes, it just works out better that way. This cake recipe converted great! Used a mix of gluten free flours, and coconut oil instead of butter. I did use a hand mixer to whip it up.  And reduced the heat to 325 because that works better for gluten free flour. The cupcakes are light & fluffy & moist.

this is the only cake I make.  Every time I make it, it gets rave reviews.  If I make it in a sheet pan I add some of the batter, some preserves and then the rest of the batter.  It gives it a little surprise in every bite.

I made this for my father's birthday, and it was so good! It was a real hit. One of the things I improvised though was the amount of sugar. It seemed like so much, so I changed it to 1 1/2 cups. Also, I recommend using earthbalance original butter, which is softer, so it was easier to cream. All in all, it was a huge success!!! I will totally make it again!

I made this cake using Pillsbury Best Multi-Purpose Gluten Free Flour.  The cake came out well, not nearly as dense as GF cakes tend to be. However, when I make it again I will be reducing the amount of sugar I use as the cake is too sweet.

Loved this recipe! I followed the directions EXACTLY and it turned out fluffy and moist for the exact time listed in the instructions. I can't wait to make it again. I made a hefty 2 layer cake and put batter in a small loaf pan to give as a gift. Perfection!   ***I should also note that my oven was calabrated recently. Maybe that is the cause for others needing to cook the cake longer...they need to get their oven temps checked.

I made it low carb with Splenda and Carbquick and also added a few drops of cake batter flavoring and it turned out great. I made this for as a round cake for a breast cancer awareness cake auction, but also make one for me to taste and it was delicious.

sadly this came out too thick and not very fluffy.  thought I followed directions exactly.  egg whites never got stiff perhaps that was the problem.

This was a very good cake, and I would make it again.  I did have problems with mixing in the egg whites at the end because I was afraid of overmixing and thus defeating the purpose of whipping them.  I think it made for a crumb that was not as fine as what I usually like.  I halved the recipe and made two 6" round cakes.  I then cut those in half horizontally (which I didn't do very well) so that I could layer more frosting inside.  I was doing this for an experiment for a birthday cake I had to make, but I finally opted for a more tried and true one that I had good luck with.  I'll try this one again and instead halve it and bake in two 9" rounds.  Carol certainly has entered a lot of fine recipes into AR's bank of desserts!  Thanks, Carol!

Sorry, but this was the worst cake I have ever made! I had to double it, as it said it would only fill one 9x13  (but three round pans? Doesn't seem right.) Anyway, that added to the difficulty of mixing this very heavy batter. Yes, I softened the butter prior to creaming, and also beat the eggs until they were stiff enough to form peaks, although it took so long, it overheated and destroyed my favorite hand mixer :( The finished cake had an OK, dense muffin-like taste.  The only good thing about this cake is that I expect it is dense and hard enough that it would hold up to being decorated with heavy fondant without caving in. But still, if even children won't eat it, might as well not bother. I have a rheumatologic condition, with bad joints in wrists, fingers, and feet, and making this cake was so physically strenuous in that regard that I am now in too much pain to help with preparing Thanksgiving dinner. And I have to buy a new mixer. I am not happy at all with this recipe.

I made this recipe based on the many reviews I read. It didn't have much flavor as my other scratch recipes have, and it was dry. I had to bake it 20 minutes longer than what the recipe called for. I have a similar recipe that calls for more milk, and that one is VERY moist. I'll just go back to that one.

I have made quite a few white cakes from scratch and followed the recipes correctly, but it was either the taste, texture, or stacking ability that lacked in my opinion. **THIS RECIPE IS BOMB!** I made it exactly as it called for, except needed to bake for another 10mins(which I was prepared for from reading a lot of reviews first). I separated the batter in to 2 9"circle pans and 1 8.75x8.75" square pan. I made the bottom tier of my cake the 2 circles and cut the square cake in to 4 triangles and made the top tier a small square. The cake didn't crumble, it held frosting great and tasted amazing! My house smelled like birthday cake for hours and everyone asked me what box mix I got (haha!!)  I definitely recommend preheating the oven for at least 15mins to reach 350 and I froze the cakes in syran wrap for a day before I decorated because I had a lot to prepare, i.e. frosting and fondant.

As other reviewers reported, I had to bake the cake for more than twice as long as the recipe said (I pulled it out at 1 hr and 7 minutes, though it probably would've been better at 1 hr...).  I turned the heat down to 325 and then 315, but the middle still wasn't cooking so I finally put it on a lower rack and put an empty pan on the upper rack in an attempt to get the middle cooked.  Once it was done (and after I had pulled off the entire top layer, as it was quite overdone), it was the moist, light cake that others had said it would be.  I think it's the right sweetness (others had said to reduce the sugar but I wouldn't change it!).  I think next time I would start baking this at 325 or 315, on the lower rack with a pan covering it in an attempt to get the middle to be done sooner.

I love this cake! I made it for my mother's birthday and everybody loved it. I made it because I had all the ingredients at home. It taste buttery and moist. I put chocolate filling in the middle and decorated it with a cream cheese frosting. I would definitely do it again. I think next time I will do cupcakes with it. Yummy!

This is an AMAZING cake; however, i feel that it takes a lot of effort and i can never quite get it to turn out of the pan right (but maybe that's my problem). I have made this cake oh... 10 times and every single time i make it people just rave about it. I always have to cook it for 10 -15 minutes longer but i live at 8500 ft and it could just be the altitude. Long story short, kind of a hassle but definitely worth the effort.

Excellent flavor, nice crumb (a touch more dense, but I like that), and so very moist. I always add more vanilla. I put "Whipped Cream Filling"(see recipe on this site) between layers, and decorated with a vanilla butter cream on top. Stayed just as moist and tasty for the next 2 days after the party. If you want it less dense, don't stir it as much. Just fold in stiff egg whites until JUST MIXED. Should turn out lighter.

I have made this cake several times. The first couple it came out differently, one being flat and heavy. I found it's VERY important to whisk the eggs with beater for a long time until very stiff. It's all about the eggs!

Came out great for my Mom's 60th birthday!  I baked in 2 8 inch springform pans, layered center with raspberry preserves, and frosted with buttercream from this site (see my custom recipe).  I doubled the vanilla, increased milk slightly (about 1/4 c.), and reduced sugar to 1 1/2 cups.  Next time I may reduce baking powder by a third.  Cake was moist enough that there was no need to brush layers with simple syrup, but I might do this to keep the cake moist if I were making it a day ahead.

I used almond extract instead of vanilla, and I baked it a little too long, but it was still fantastic!  This was the recipe I have been searching for, I will definitely use this again.

I just made this cake as a practice for my little girls Ariel birthday cake next week and you know its a good sign when your kids can't keep from licking the spatula and bowl and say "this is good icing". Its a sweet cake that is wonderful without icing. It turned out so good I'm trying to decide if I should go ahead and freeze it for the real cake...

This recipe was ok. It was very heavy which I don't prefer but do not find awful. My husband did not enjoy it at all and has asked me to never use this recipe again. I did read a comment where someone just added an extra cup of milk and I plan on trying this again with the extra milk to see if that makes it better for my husband.

This is the type of cake I love - like pound cake, sweet, not needing flosting. I made it for my son's birthday cake, which didn't go so well because its not the light fluffy type that kids like. But this goes really well with afternoon tea. Like others, I based twice as long

Easy and very good for decorating. Quite a heavy cake, but very managable when layering. Sift flour before measuring and again while mixing in. I have used this recipe a number of times (usually for a coloured birthday cake) and haven't been disappointed yet. Use in combination with "Quick and Almost-Professional Buttercream Icing" for a sweeeeeeeet treat ;-)

I have made this cake twice now and it's very good and moist. No adjustments needed. It tastes great with buttercream icing!

Very good cake!  Very moist, baked it for my daughter's 2nd birthday - the whole cake was gone...  I made a 10" round and a smaller cake, had to cook it for a lot longer than recipe said (which others said too.)  delicious!

If you follow the directions exactly you will end up with a mess, so I would only rate this cake with 2 stars. It needs a lot of adjustments to make it work and I don't want to do that.  I did follow the recipe to the letter the first time I made it and was not happy with the end result. The texture is off, and it smells like an omelet coming out of the oven. Plus it needs extra cooking time.  Next time I will try something else, it was not worth it to me to monkey with anymore.

This was the recipe I used for the first birthday cake I baked and it is a hit!!!  And it's still my only and best recipe for cakes!!!  My mom was surprised that it contained very little ingredients and just 6 easy steps.  Now she uses it for cakes too.  Practice makes it perfect!

Excellent flavor, but extremely dense.  Didn't work well for a birthday cake, but I would make it again for dessert, maybe with a berry compote?

This was a fairly good recipe. As another reviewer noted it is very dense but still tastey. I also used a homemade icing and that really spruced it up. Not a bad recipe overall.

This cake tastes very good.  However, as other reviewers have said, it is very dense.  It resembles a pound cake.

I absolutely love this recipe...used it several times.  I even changed the all purpose flour to spelt for my sister as she is allergic to wheat (minus 1 tbsp of spelt/ cup of wheat).  I always get rave reviews.  You would think I would know it off by heart by now, needed to look it up for My Mom's birthday this weekend.  Delicious!!!!!!!!!

I made this cake for my daughter's fourth birthday and decorated it with decarator's icing. Everyone said it tasted better than the ones I had been buying from our town's bakery. I will always use this recipe from now on.
