Great recipe except it was missing parmesan cheese and red pepper flakes. I didn't add the nutmeg to it.  The sauce was a little skimpy.  I think it needed a little more sauce.  I fried the bacon whole and then removed from pan then drained some of the bacon drippings.  Then I broke it up into small pieces and added it back to the sauce.  It tasted great!

This recipe was very good, I normally do not cook with alcohol but the family really enjoyed this dinner.  I made this recipe as written except made 3X the pasta.   Although increasing the pasta there was plenty of sauce, although I will double the sauce next time.  I served with garlic bread.  Will make again.  Do not let the vodka stop you it is so good.  This recipe is good for the whole family.

This was exceptional!  I especially liked the bacon and the secret ingredient ...freshly grated nutmeg.  I used fresh pasta.  Next time I will try it with some freshly chopped parsley or basil for color and a little extra zip.  I also will add some chopped onion when frying the bacon.  It's a great recipe as is yet very versatile.  Thanks ...it tastes a lot like they make at Oregano's, a fantastic little Italian restaurant in Richmond Hill, Ontario.

I didn't think the bacon went together with this sauce, it sounded good but ended up giving it an odd taste, maybe I would try it again without the bacon next time

Only because I owned 1/2 cup of cream did I look up a recipe for Penna alla Vodka. We loved the bacon and nutmeg. I didn't change a thing and will definitely add this to my Top 10.  My husband asks that next time I add some shrimp.

This recipe had a good taste, though the sauce was a little drier than I normally like.  Next time I may use not quite the full lb of pasta, or I might add a little more cream and vodka.

Yum!  Followed the recipe exactly, except I added snow peas.  Was a huge hit with the family!
