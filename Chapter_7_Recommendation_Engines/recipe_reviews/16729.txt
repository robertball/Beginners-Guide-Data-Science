I really enjoyed this recipe.  I did make some minor changes--I added extra mayo to make it less dry, I used dill pickles that I cut up instead of the sweet relish, and I cut up the potatoes prior to cooking to cut down on the cooking time.  I will definitely make this again.

Wow. I never made potatoe salad before and this disappeared very quickly. I cut the onion measurement in 1/2 and grated it. Only used 2 eggs. Didn't have celery seeds or mustard.Dry mustard would be a nice touch. Put more like 4 heeping tblspn of mayo, and I chopped up dill pickle with some extra pickle juice. The search is over for a really good potatoe salad.

My husband was craving potato salad so after looking at a few different recipies I tried this one.  It was really good!  It is better the next day so make it a day in advance if possible.  I added more mayo so it wasn't dry.  It definately is a classic picnic potato salad. I will definately make this recipe again.

I really enjoyed reading through the reviews to see other reviewers personal touches they put on their own potato salad. I can tell you I never was a fan of potato salad until I started making my own and then it was over from there. It really does come down to personal preferances and it's really personal, really. Because we wanted a tamer onion flavor, I used green onion. I used dill pickles instead of sweet as we don't care for sweet pickles, and I used garlic powder instead of garlic salt. After mixing the potato salad ingredients, I found that mine needed more mayo. Not much, maybe a little under another quarter cup? I added chopped chives, onion powder and a couple good shakes of Frank's Hot Sauce to my potato salad as that's what I always add to all my potato salad--it's a family favorite. Nice basic potato salad that we all enjoyed.

I made a few changes - 2 lbs. red potatoes, reduced eggs to 2, reduced sweet pickle relish to 1 heaping tablespoon, reduced mustard to less than 1 tablespoon and increased mayonnaise to more than 1 cup. Turned out great.My husband loved this recipe. He said it was the best he has had in years and it has a flavorful and clean taste.

This was my first attempt at potato salad...and I have to admit that I was a bit disappointed.  It didn't wow me like I thought it would, and it didn't have the best reaction from the family.  My grandma usually makes hers and didn't this year, so this dish had a lot to live up to.  Don't get me wrong, it was "good", just not "great".  
I think I will let grandma keep making the potato salad from now on...but thanks for the post.

I have made this Potato Salad several times, and each time it is wonderful. People are always asking for recipe. I do adjust mayo and pickle relish to my own personal taste, which means I add more of each.

i had to make a few changes on this recipe- i cut the celery down to 1/2 cup, 1/3 cup onion, and substituted diced kosher dill pickles for the relish. also, i had to add more mayo, because it was really too dry, and kicked up the mustard a bit. added pickle juice to it, used 6 potatoes and 2 eggs. so i pretty much just made my own recipe... but it was still good. i made it last night for myself and the rest of my family (i'm 16) found it and ate it.

Pretty good and tastes a lot like my mom's.  I didn't add the relish and added an extra egg. I also used a combination of mayo and miracle whip for a little more flavor also using dijon mustard vs. yellow mustard makes a big difference.

Converted recipe for 125 servings and it was a hit. I added a little more mayonnaise than called for. Wonderful.

This was very good. I used dijon mustard, instead of prepared mustard, but I don't think it changed the taste too much. I also added two tablespoons of miracle whip, to give it that added zip. I will definately make this again.

Pickle relish is a southern thing.  The basic potatoes, eggs, celery and onion are there.  I would never use garlic salt.  Just S&P and mayo.  I sometimes fry bacon and use the grease and bacon crushed up.  Helman's or Best mayo is the best.  The MUST in any good potato salad is peeling the potatoes when they are warm enough to handle as the Mayo and other ingredients need to blend.  It's no use to put may and seasonings on cold potatoes.

Exactly the way I make it but,  I add more mayo,  a 1/4 cup of white vinegar and lots of egg yolk ( I  finely chop up or mash with a fork only 1 egg white because I hate that rubbery texture).  I also throw in some dried Dill Weed and when I have it on hand, a heaping TBS of Sour Cream.  One thing about this recipe that I love is,  cooking the potatoes whole and then dealing with the peeling and chopping.  I have never done it this way before...it is so much easier! Heck,  I even just crumble the cooled potatoes in my hand,   what a time saver!   I could eat potato salad everyday of my life ,  I  love it so!  Making another batch right this very moment!! :)

This is really good.  It is even better if you can let it sit for awhile- like over night.  I have never made potatoes this way- I mean boiling them whole and then peeling and chopping- but it worked very well.  The only thing I did differently was I added four eggs (otherwise one little lonely egg would have been left).  BF said it was one of the best potato salads he has ever had.  Thanks for the recipe!

This did turn out to be a great potato salad HOWEVER, I must say there were a few things wrong with the ingredients.  For instance,It says to use 5 potatoes, I think that is a typo because I can't imagine 5 potatoes making a potato salad serving 8 people? She must have meant to say 5 lbs? Anyway, I used a 4 lb. bag of medium yellow potatoes. Then it says to boil for 15 mins. well, potatoes take at least 25 mins. to cook. And the measurements for the mayo was way off, but thats not a big deal just add more. Overall this did make a really tasty potato salad, even my mother approved, lol, so it gets 5 stars from me! Oh, fyi, it tastes even better the next day after all the ingredients have been sitting and the salad is nice and chilled! I about finished the whole thing off today for lunch, I couldn't put it down! YUM!

Substitute plain greek yogurt instead of mayo for a lowfat, protein enriched version.
chopped pickle is also a a good swap for relish, and a lower glycemic option. (less sugar)
You can also just microwave your potatoes for quicker (cooler) prep. Just put your potatoes with a tablespoon of water in a big microwave safe bowl and cook on high 5-7 min (depending on size of your spuds)

Ths was fabulous!  I did make a few minor changes solely due to dietary needs.  I used garlic powder instead of garlic salt -- too much salt for my high blood pressure.  I also mixed the mustard into the mayo, and added about 2 heaping tablespoons of sour cream into the mayo.  Will definiately make again!

If you use red potatoes, there is no need to peel--the peels add color and flavor. I use some chopped dill pickle in addition to the sweet relish, and use a little pickle juice to add tang and cut down on amount of mayonaise needed.

This was a very good potato salad. I'm giving it 4 stars because I did make adjustments - the measurements just seem backwards for some of the major ingredients. For starters I doubled the potatoes (five seemed way too few). Two eggs were plenty and I also used about 1/2 of the celery and kept the onion called for the same. Even with doubling the potatoes there weren't enough to warrant 1/2 c relish so I used about a  tbsp each sweet and dill. I subbed regular salt for the celery as I don't care for an overwhelming celery flavor and I used 3/4-1 full c mayo.  Except for slightly overcooking the potatoes, it was great.

We love this recipe, I have made it several times.  The only thing that I do different is use sweet pickles chopped up instead of using sweet relish.  I really like the flavor that the celery salt gives this dish, I would not leave this spice out.

This is fabulous. I used dill pickle relish and onion flakes. The potatoes peeled so easy once they were boiled. Easy and great tasting. First try and it turned out like a true winner!! Thank You. I always add dill weed spice to this & a sprtiz of paprika. This is the only potato salad I make now....I have made at least 10 times now and it always get ravishing raves!! If you don't have prepared mustard, ground mustard works just as well.

This is very good! I don't care for sweet relish at all, so I just chopped up some of my home-canned dill pickles that I canned last fall. Great with a grilled burger and my husband gives it 5 forks up. Thanks for a delicious recipe!

This was my first attempt at homemade potato salad & it turned out remarkably well.  I made it for 4th of July & it went over well with the family.  The only thing that I did different was I doubled the mayo & added 1 TBS. of milk to make it creamy.  It was very good & full of flavor!!

This recipe is just like grandma used to make but with a little oomph. I did not have garlic salt or celery salt, so I used 1/2 tsp. table salt, 1/4 tsp celery seed and 1/8 tsp. garlic powder. I finally found my perfect potato salad.

Hey, Jewell --- thank you for a truly delicious potato salad with a twist.  I made this as written, and we all LOVED it... used our home grown potatoes and onion, and couldn't get enough... were eating leftovers at midnight!  Thanks so much for saving me from potato salad BLAH.

This is a great recipe.  I like to substiute chopped bread and butter pickles for the relish.  try adding a little more mayo and thinning the dressing with a little pickle juice.  Tastes great!

I made this for a dinner bbq party and it was a huge hit. Everyone loved it! I doubled the recipe and used red potatos with skin left on. Very yummy and kept well in the fridge. I actually think it tasted better the longer it sat in the fridge and soaked up the flavors by day 3 as a leftover. Will definately make this again.

This recipe reminds me of home.  It's awesome and perfect for that picky husband that just doesn't like to try things that are "new" and "improved".  I will make this on a regular on our menu at home and for those pot-lucks.  Thanks!

As is, not so good.  However, with a few changes, my family liked it pretty well.  I cut the celery to 1/2 cup, 1/4 cup FINELY chopped onion, used dill relish instead of sweet, and added a little more garlic salt to taste.  All in all, not bad after changes, but will go back to mom's recipe until I find something better.

I have made this Potato
 Salad many times now and have had rave revues about it.  The only change that I made was I used red potatoes,put 2 tbsps. of oil; 1/4 cup of sweet relish and 1/4 cup of finely chopped sweet red pepper and omitted the garlic salt. This is truly great among my Italian family as we are very fussy when it comes to anything with "mayonnaise". Will make this often when we bring a dish to someone's cookout.

This came out really good after a few changes were made.  I omitted the celery, garlic and celery salt.  Instead, I added finely chopped red and green bell peppers, a little vinegar and a small amount of sugar.  It reminded me of the potato salad my Mom used to make when I was growing up.  I will definitely be making this again.  Thanks for sharing.

Made this for my son-in-law who is a basic potato salad man and it got his approval. I did use chopped dill pickles and some of the juice from the pickles instead of sweet pickles. Turned out just right.

Awesome recipe.  I used only half of the relish to suit the tastes of my husband.  I think it would have been a tad too sweet otherwise.
Really yummy!

I did not like this at all and found it very bland and not very creamy. If it were served, as the submitter suggested with chili, maybe the spice of the chili added some needed flavor to it but standing on its own, it didn't have much.  I've tasted other potato salads that are way better.

This is a really great basic potato salad. I love celery, but I also used just a little less than one cup, about 1/4 cup chopped red onion and more than 1 tablespoon mustard. I also added a splash of white vinegar as per another recipe. Didn't measure mayo - just added and stirred until it was just moist.

This recipe was pretty good.  I added garlic in with the potato's while cooking.  I used green onion, dijon mustard, a bit more garlic (not garlic salt) when mixing everything together and chopped 2 pears in it as well and omitted the celery salt.  TASTES GREAT!  Good idea with the relish, I would have never thought of adding that to it.

This is pretty good.  I doubled the mayo & halved the relsih, which was hot dog relish (it contains mustard already) because I don't care for sweet relish.  This is a good recipe, but I'm still gonna look around.  Thanks Jewell ;)

Great recipe.  I made just a couple changes…used scallions instead of onions and added chopped Wickles pickles (not sure if they are available nationwide) in place of the sweet relish.  Wickles pickles are a great combination of sweet and spicy which added some zing.  I also used half sour cream and half mayo to eliminate the heavy mayo flavor.  Excellent!  Will make it again and again.

This recipe is just what it says it is, old fashioned potato salad. My guests and I LOVED it. I made it the night before and let it meld overnight. This made it much easier to concentrate on the Fourth of July slow cooked baby back ribs...   If you are looking for grandmas potato salad, look no further.

I really love this recipe! I made just a few alterations from the original recipe (I have made it exactly as written and I thought it was a tad dry). Some of my changes included adding at least twice as much mayo, adding about 1/2 tsp paprika and about 1/2 cup of diced dill pickles. I also like to use red onions, they taste better to me and add a nice pop of color. So yummy! Oh and one thing I have found works good for potato salad is steaming the potatoes rather than boiling them. They hold their shape better and aren't all water logged.

This is only the second time that I have made potato salad.  My mom makes the best potato salad and when I served her this, she really liked it and said it was good!  This went so well with the ham we had for supper!!  Thanks for sharing.

I'm very picky about potato salad since I've often been disappointed with some recipes, i.e, too much mustard, too dry, etc., but this is one of the best recipesI've ever tried! I served this at an office potluck and it was gone very quickly!  This is the kind of potato salad that would do great at BBQ's and picnics!

This IS definitely old fashioned and usually the way I make mine.  Didn't have the celery salt but I normally put dill weed in mine anyhow.  Yummy.

This could not have turned out any better. It was the hit of dinner with the whole family last night. The only thing I did different was used about a 1/2 tsp of minced garlic and 3 tbsp of mustard. This one is worth more than 5 stars!!

This is the one! Seriously.... this is the first potato salad where it turned out perfect and everyone complimented me on the finished dish. I have had so many failures in the past, it was great to finally arrive at the perfect potato salad recipe.

I didn't measure the ingredients, just season to taste and I didn’t use any eggs or celery b/c my husband is allergic to celery.  I used red potatoes, cubed before boiling, with skin on.  Half real mayo and half miracle whip.  A healthy squirt of prepared mustard & mustard powder, in addition to sweet relish, onion powder, chopped white & green onion, pepper.  Mix all together, chill completely and serve…voila!!  Yum, yum!!!

I gave this such a low rating because it wasn't very good as is. Rate it higher with the changes made though. The first time I made this no one ate it. The flavor was horrible and very dry. I tried a second time but omitted the mustard, added bits of bacon and used Light Miracle Whip plus 1/3 cup more instead of mayo and everyone LOVED it. I have been asked to make it at family gatherings for the rest of the summer!

This was yummy. I did make a few alterations...I nearly doubled the recipe (except the potatoes/eggs), as I found it was a little dry as is. Instead of onion (which hubby dislikes raw) I added a good amount of onion powder, used 1/2 dill pickle relish and 1/2 sweet relish, left out the celery (didn't have any), but used extra celery seed (not celery salt).  Mostly the same recipe, even after my alterations. VERY YUMMY! Great raves from my entire family and friends at dinner tonight.

A very good simple recipe. And very flexible, I only had half the celery, and I used dijon mustard, a little bit of dill, celery seeds instead of salt and probably about 3/4 cups mayo total. It came out perfectly. Definitely reccomended!

Very yummy potato salad. Made this for my boyfriend's parents, and they loved it. I used red skinned potatoes and cubed them before boiling them to cut down on the potato cooking time. I also had to omit the celery and celery salt, and instead of relish, I chopped up some pickles, but it was still so good. High marks!

Good, solid, reliable recipe. I usually just throw potato salad together with varying degrees of success. This recipe adds some discipline, and it's good. I did add some extra mayonnaise.

First why peel the potatoes? Second, dice first if you want the potato pieces to be evenly cooked and not have some under and some overcooked. I substitute minced gherkins if I don't have relish.

I hadn't made potato salad for years and had an urge to make same. This recipe is almost exactly like I remember from long ago. It was wonderful and better after sitting for awhile. Great comments and changes from others also. 5 stars.

I loved this recipe and is very easy.  I used 6 potatoes and probably should have cooked more as it's really good.  I modified the receipt it a bit  by peeling the potatoes and cutting them in wedge bite size pieces which cut down the boiling time.  I then rinsed off the potatoes with cold water to firm them up a little.  I added Ranch Dressing and mayonaise for taste, plus added a little yellow mustard for color and taste.  I omitted the celery Salt, as the garlic salt is enough.  I used 4 hard boiled eggs..  I cut down on the onion, but used a sweet onion instead.  SO... good.

I grew up on potato salad, but could not remember how my mom made it. So when I found this recipe I figure I would try it. I just got done making it and it is REALLY good. The only thing I did diffrent was I used Miricle Whip which made it more creamy, added some more mustard, and chopped up eggs. Thanks for the recipe :)

This potato salad is good but rather dry. I use only 1/2 cup of sliced celery and 1/3 or 1/2 c. of chopped sweet onion.  I prefer to use a small bowl to mix well  3/4 to 1 cup of Helleman or Best mayonnaise with 1 to 2 tbsp.mustard in a small bowl. Add about 3 tbsp. chopped dill pickles and 2 tbsp. pickle juice with about 1 to 2 tsp of sugar and 1/2 tsp salt and 1/4 tsp. black paper. Taste dressing  before add to the cooled diced potatoes  and chopped eggs, chopped onion and celery. Refrigerate the potato salad 1 to 2 days before serving so it gives more flavor.

*****
I like this recipe as written, but I made a few changes to suit me. Instead of garlic salt, I used garlic powder. Instead of celery salt, I used celery seed. That way I can use a salt substitute, as I need to watch the sodium. I also added a tablespoon of dried parsley & because I like food that is zingy, I doubled the onion & the mustard. Instead of boiling the potatos & then cubing them, I peel & cube them & then boil them. Also, since I like the taste of eggs in the salad but hate the texture(too rubbery!), after peeling the eggs I run them through a mini food processor. Lastly, I like to mix all the ingredients but the potatos together to insure that they are well blended & then add the potatos.

Absolutely delicious! Thanks for sharing. I usually make a 'mashed potato' salad with kosher dill pickles but this was refreshingly different. Hope my guests enjoy it tomorrow but it they don't more for me! :)

Good base recipe for simple potato salad. I wanted mine with mostly potato, so I used 6 fairly large red-skinned potatoes, and two hard boiled eggs, and reduced the onion to 1/3 of a cup. I don't like raw celery, so I skipped it, and increased the amount of celery salt to about a teaspoon, and used garlic powder instead of garlic salt, so it wouldn't be way too salty. I added about 1/4 cup of halved green olives, with pimentos, and separated the pimentos from the olives. I don't care for pickle relish, so I used a tablespoon of fresh snipped dill weed, and a teaspoon of sugar. It seemed like it would be dry with just 1/4 cup of mayo, so I upped it to 1/2 cup. and added 2 tablespoons of sour cream to make it a little creamier and less dry, and I thought that was the perfect amount. Finally I added a couple of shakes of paprika when I added in the black pepper. I liked everything about my version except the green olives. I think next time I will just get a jar of pimentos and add more of them without the olives. Make sure to give it several hours to chill. My fiance and I both thought it tasted better a day after being cooked, after all the flavors had time to blend together

This was very good; a classic potato salad.  I would make it again.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.

Very good, although dry.  I reduced the relish to 2 heaping tablespoons and added a tablespoon of cider vinegar to keep things moist and keep a good balance of  flavors.

I would love to rate this "as is"; however,I am rating with a few changes I made. As others suggested, I used green onions, half mayo/half sour cream, and added pickle relish.  I also added about 1T of yellow mustard and approx 1 T of dry ranch dressing mix. Sugar is also needed to balance out some of the tartness of the mayo and sour cream.   Definitely use real bacon and fry it until crisp.....microwaving doesn't get the desired texture. This is sort of a base recipe that you can add to to suit your own tastes.  I made this for a big church pot luck dinner and it was gobbled up quickly, with requests for the recipe.

We thought this was just OK.  The sweet relish seemed wrong.  I might try it again with dill relish, or maybe just find another recipe.

I don't peel the potatoes first.  I put them in with the skin to boil, then let them cool before cutting.  If I cut them and then boil, they get too soggy.  I also let my eggs cool after boiling before peeling.

Super awsome and easy! Only change I made was since I like a little more zing to my potato salad, I added 3 TBS of cider vinegar. Just a personal preference. But absolutely delicious as the recipe is, and will be a regular dish in my kitchen.

Veery simple to make! And delicious.  I decided to make a homemade potato salad at the last minute (literally) and this was very quick and easy to make.  The only things I did differently is I used regular chopped pickles instead of the sweet relish and I added about 1/2 cup of bacon bits.  It was a hit!!

Gave this recipe out to be made for a community feast last weekend and have people asking me for the recipe. It was really good and went over well with the crowd. I had adjusted the recipe to make three batches of 36 servings.

Overall, this was a success.  I am a cooking novice and appreciated the instructions on boiling the eggs and potatoes.  The problem I had is that my potatoes didn't cook in 15 minutes.  My potatoes were normal sized, and I do not live at a high altitude or anything, so I don't know what went wrong.  When I went to slice them, they were raw inside.  I was running out of time, and I had already drained the water, so I microwaved them until they were cooked fully.  It turned out well ultimately -- my husband loved it.  But I will boil the potatoes for longer next time.

Needed twice or three times as many eggs as recipe called for.  I would cut the sweet relish back by a third next time.  I used green onions instead of onion.

This recipe reminds me of my step-mother's. She would make a large batch of this for the family, and any leftovers were doomed. I never let any last through the night!! Unfortunately, I made a batch for tomorrow . . . hopefully I can keep my fork out of it until then! Thank you jewellkay, this is exactly the recipe I was searching for!

I made this recipe as described, and it was extremely dry and flavorless. There was no way I was going to serve it to my guests. After adding more mayo, garlic, and some italian salad dressing, etc., it came out great and I got great feedback, however I'm rating the recipe as it was written and made so many changes that I can't credit the great outcome to this recipe.

Steam the potatoes and get them extra soft. Add a lot more mayonaise than the recipe calls for...eyeball it, and otherwise as is, and delicious!

I did really enjoy this potato salad, but as it stands now, I felt that the onion really overpowered the flavor of the dish. I would advise anyone to cut back on the raw onion so that all of the flavors of the meal can shine. This is a great, traditional potato salad recipe.

I added one tbsp. of white vinegar and one tsp. of sugar to the dressing and mixed it in a separate bowl first to let all of the granules of salt and sugar dissolve.  It tastes almost exactly like my Mom's.

This salad got rave reviews at my last family dinner, the only thing I changed was I chopped up dill pickly because I didn't have any relish and I substituted the prepared mustard for 2 tsp. of dijon.

I added a little more mayonnaise. Used Grey Poupon (no onions or celery) and made it on the family vacation and they loved it! Almost the best I've ever had..the best having bacon and bacon grease...I figure this is a tad bit healthier.

Delicious! And I'm not a big fan of mayonnaise-based salads. Made this for a super bowl meal to go along with pulled pork sandwiches. Excellent flavor and quite simple. Just like my Grandmother's! Thank you!

This is just what I was looking for!  This was my first time making potato salad so I was nervous, but it came out wonderful!  I don't think I changed anything in this recipe.  My only suggestion is to make sure your potatoes are good and cool before peeling and cutting.  I made the mistake of not waiting long enough and thought I was going to end up with potato mush, but after putting the potatoes in the refrigerator they hardened up nicely instead of being mushy.  I will make this again!!!

Great recipe.  I made it when we had family over and was little nervous as I had never made potato salad before.  Everyone loved it.  Next time I will make it the day before though as it better the day after.

This is a good version of classic potato salad. I made a couple of changes; I added 1 TBS. of red wine vinegar, more mayo (to taste), 1/4 tsp black pepper, and substituted dijon for regular mustard. I will make this again!

OMG this is awesome and soooo easy. i added dill pickles chopped  instead sweet relish. i grated the onion so it wasn't as noticeable, and a touch more mayo so it wasnt as dry. unbelievable and it was my first attempt at potato salad im really impressed, can't you tell?

This recipe has the ability to be a great potato salad but I found the measurements were a bit off. For 8 servings I used 7 medium russet potatoes. I had to boil the potatoes for 25 mins. There is no way they would have been cooked well enough in 15 mins. I used 3 hard-boiled eggs, 1/2 cup celery. I mixed 1 cup mayo with 2 tblsp of mustard, 1/2 tsp of black pepper, 1/4 tsp of celery salt and 1/2 tsp of garlic salt, and still needed to add 1/2 tsp. of salt. I prefer dill relish to sweet relish so added 1/4 cup dill relish to the mayo mixture and then stirred the mayo mixture into the potatoes, celery, egg mixture. (I omitted the onion as my family doesn't care for onion) I also added 1/3 cup crumbled bacon (another personal preference). Unless you like a very dry potato salad, you will need to use much more mayo to this recipe.

Great basic recipe that stands by itself but I add the following to make it a bit more special: couple T bacon bits, handful of chopped fresh dill, squirt of dijon mustard. Once it's done, slice some extra hard boiled egg on top with a sprinkle of paprika

OMGosh!!This is the best potato salad ever! I even made it with lower fat ingredients; Evaporated skim milk, half fat mayo, 67% fat-free Bacel, and it was still so rich and creamy, didn't affect the texture at all. Then I contradicted all those healthy ingredients by adding half a pound of cooked and diced bacon, lol, but oh so yummy. My picky kids who don't like potato salad had seconds! I ended up with lots of extra dressing but it is the best dip for chicken fingers you ever tried. Great on fried fish instead of tartar sauce too. This is a keeper. Everyone wants the recipe for this one. Thank-you so much for posting it.

Very simple recipe.  It's very easy to make as well as very easy to spruce up.  I think this is a perfect dish for beginners.  I added some vegetarian bacon, white pepper, and substituted sweet relish with chopped dill pickle.  I also used a sweet mustard instead, this dish always does well at family functions.

I very much liked this potato salad.  It was just what I was looking for:  something simple, easy to make, no fancy ingredients, and nice flavor.  However, I give it four stars because it lacked a little 'zing.'  It was very mild, and I prefer a peppier potato salad.  Also, there wasn't enough 'sauce' for five big potatoes.  Next time I will increase the amount of sauce or decrease the number of potatoes, and add something to give the salad a little bite.  Thanks for the recipe!

This is an excellent recipe for potato salad. I doubled the recipe and left out the relish as I'm not fond of pickles, but it was great anyway.

THIS IS GREAT!! MY FAVORITE!  Try using minced cucumber chips or bread and butter pickles instead of relish.  Plus, a little of the pickle juice and a dash of dry mustard.  YOU WILL LIKE IT!!

Out of personal preferance, I omitted the onion, added dill pickles, and the clincher, dill pickle juice to taste. It was wonderfull. One of our friends skipped desert in order to help himself to his fifth serving!! definately a keeper.

I've never been able to make potato salad, but with this recipe, I was FINALLY successful.  I like that it has not so much mayo.  I  cut the potatoes before I cooked them and used dill pickle relish instead of sweet.  I also soaked my cut onions in cold water while the potatoes cooled, just to take the edge off them.

This is pretty close to my gram's recipe.  I don't use mustard or relish, but only use 3/4 of the amount of mayo and 1/4 Miracle Whip and a little sugar..turns out great every time!

Very good basic recipe. I would recommend refrigerating overnite.That being said I also put a little white wine vinegar (splashed 3 tbls) over the potatoes and same amount of balsamic vinegar over potatoes for added flavor. mix carefully, refrigerate for a few hours if you have time then add the rest of the ingredients and refrigerate at least 8 hours before serving.

My first time at potato salad and WOW, super easy and tastes great. A very classic flavor, just like my Mom used to make. I did tweak it a bit with chopped dill pickle, a little pickle juice and more mayo. I can't wait to share and show this one off at the next get together as I'm sure it will be a hit.

This was my very first time making potatoe salad. i expected this recipe to be GREAT. But it dissapointed me a bit because of the uneeded great amount of onion and lack of mayo. It was very dry. But i made it my own by adding more mayo, some peas..and next time ill add less onions. But it was A GREAT guide..the ingredients were perfect, its just the amount that i dissagree with. Thanx for guiding me through my first home-made potatoe salad Jewell! :)

This was *very* bland.  I doctored it up quite a bit, adding dijon mustard, a bit more mayo, vinegar, & italian salad dressing mix and it came out pretty good.  I was looking for a fabulous potato salad recipe, and this isn't it.  I guess I'll keep looking...

This recipe has the same ingredients I've been using for years  and it's always raved about!  I never measure   for this recipe so can't speak to amounts--just add things to taste.  Only things I do differently is Miracle Whip Lite instead of  mayo, and thin it  a bit with red wine vinegar--also  add a little  Mrs Dash now and then.

I add extra mayo & some very finely diced green and/or red pepper and then sprinkle with paprika for color. Delicious!

I always use Miracle Whip instead of mayonnaise in my potato salad. It has all the zip and flavor without adding the vinegar and sugar.

I made this recipe as written, except I doubled it since I was about to feed a bunch of people at our branding. My husband is not a fan of sweet relish, but I am and we argued about sweet or dill potato salad. I won, since I was going to make it and I have to say, with this recipe, I was not disappointed. It was really a very good salad overall. I like a bit more kick at times, so the next time I make it, I might increase the mustard and maybe even the relish. My husband didn't mind the sweeter flavor after all and ate enough for 3 people! Everyone at the branding seemed to really like it and ate plenty. Only reason for 4 stars is that I thought there was room for a little improvement in some stronger flavor, but it definitely tastes good!

Really great recipe. The only thing that we changed was instead of using sweet relish we used dill pickle chunks. The first time I used dill relish but It was to fine and blended In to much. The next time I bought a jar of dill pickles and chopped them up myself so there would be larger chunks. We like ours chunky and we love dill pickles.

This is a fantabulous recipe...only change I made was adding 1/2 of Miracle Whip and 1 heaping tablespoon of Mayo...talk about delish! The Miracle Whip gives it a tang and the Mayo tones it down just a little!!!

I liked this and I was relatively easy since the pototes were boiled whole and cut up later.  It was a little too much celery and not quite enough sweet relish for me.  I also think it needs a little zing, maybe some vinegar to tang it up a bit.  Very good, just like you remember it, old fashined style potato salad.  Thanks for the recipe!

Absolutely perfect!  The only change I make is to use plain greek yogurt in place of the mayonnaise. It has to be greek, but honestly, you cannot tell the difference and it becomes completely healthy with this 1 change.  I make it for potlucks and it's a huge hit!

I made this last night for dinner as a side dish and it came out so good. I followed the recipe exactly and didn't change anything. I just had some for lunch and it is so much better the next day. So my only suggestion is to make it a day ahead!

AWESOME.  I made this for the frist time for a labor day picnic family party and everyone raved about not only that it was gone before anyone could have seconds. This recipe is perfect blend of sweet and sour taste with a nice creamy texture to it. I would give this 10 stars if I could. Enjoy...

What a wonderful surprise. This has been a family favorite for years
This is the exact recipe I learned in Grandma's kitchen over 40 years ago. 
My mom made one adjustment. She prefers Miracle Whip instead of mayo.  
Thanks for the memories

I am not much for Potato salad because of Mayo but this was amazing. i didn't change anything except I added Bacon Bits because lets face it who doesn't like bacon. I work in an office of all men except me. they went crazy over this. thanks for this recipe adding Bacon you can never go wrong.

This is very much like the potato salad I grew up on. The only difference is that my family peels and chops the potatoes before boiling which helps keep the consistency of the potato salad more to our preference (less mashed up but still tender and great tasting). Sometimes we add a touch of dill which we also like.

I love this recipe. I've made it seven times and my family loves it! Sometimes when I'm out of mayo, I use Dukes cause it's always in my fridge or diced pickles instead of relish when I'm out of relish. I love this recipe. Reminds me of when my grandma used to make this. I also find that boiling the potatoes whole is a lot faster and easier to cool, peel, and cut versus the peeling, cutting, and boiling that I used to do. My potato salad would always come out too mushy and would better of being smashed potatoes! Well thanks for the recipe.

This is simple AND excellently flavorful! Used just a bit less relish and added about 1/4 tsp. ground nutmeg.  Suggest you prepare everything separate from the potatoes, then add in stages.  Some people like their potato salad very 'wet', others want less of the mayo mix.  The proportions for me were perfect!    Also suggest you finely chop the celery and onions so they blend easier. Got raves from family - said it "tasted just like Mom's" - meaning our Mother! The highest of praise in our family for sure!

I had never made potato salad before, and this recipe delivered.  It was delicious, it was easy, and it took only an hour to make!  The only negative comment came from my Dad: "There is too much celery."  (No one else agreed with him.)  However, Dad liked the mayonnaise/mustard ratio.  I think I used less onion than called for; but less onion is never a problem.  For certain, this recipe is a keeper!

My absolute favorite potato salad recipe. I use diced kosher dill pickles instead of the relish, red onion, and a heaping 1/4 cup of mayo. SO good!

I omitted the celery salt because I never have it on hand.  I also added another heaping tablespoon of mayo.  This is the best potato salad recipe I have ever tasted.  My mother-in-law and my husband agreed!

I've never made potato salad and found this recipe to be very good and easy.  I did add some dry mustard instead of prepared mustard.  I also added some salt & pepper to taste.  I also used 1/2 sweet relish and 1/2 dill relish.  It had great taste & flavor.  Thanks for the great recipe.

I didn't use the eggs and substituted pickles for the relish as others did, but I have to say I didn't care for this potato salad.  I actually added a bit of sugar because I guess I like the sweeter types of potato salad made with vinegar.  My husband i'm sure will like this, but just not my taste.

Everytime I make this it's raved about. Almost every bbq I am requested to make this. I use 6 eggs and 2 eggs I use the whole egg and yolk and then the last 3 I only use the egg whites, lower fat option. I also use more mayo then requested, I use lowfat mayo and just use it to my tasting. I also use celery seed as well as celery salt, I think it gives it great flavor. You cant really screw this recipe up

I've always thought of potato salad as something that is too time consuming for the flavor pay-off. But this recipe is great! I only had 4 potatoes in the house so I adjusted the rest of the ingredients according.I used dijon mustard and celery seed instead of celery salt and it turned out delish!

I have been making the same type of potato salad for years, one that has always been a huge success!  My stepdaughters love the type their mom and grandma made, but I never was a huge fan of sweet relish in potato salad or mustard.  But for a cookout I decided to make my normal salad and try my hand at the one they would be more familar with.  I found this and made it as the recipe stated - I made no changes.  Let's just say the whole family loved it.  Now everyone wants me to make my tried and true potato salad and this one too!  Thanks for helping me provide an alternative for all tastes in my family!

Good Simple recipe. Taste way better than any store bought potato salad. I didn't add the sweet pickle relish, and I added 1/4 cup more of mayonnaise and I used regular mustard instead of the dried. Turned out great.

This was so good. Didn't need to use extra mayo as some suggested. Not dry in the slightlest. (Maybe our potatoes were smaller? I don't know!)We only used two eggs, but everything else was the same. (Three eggs would have been just as good tho.) Some people didn't like the celery, but I thought it was great in there. I'll definitely be making this again!

Good 'ole fashioned potato salad. We like our potatoes a bit more mushy so I think next time I make this I will boil the potatoes longer.  Overall this was good. Note we like egss in our potato salad so I did add chopped eggs and topped it off with paprika.

Great basic and easy potato salad recipe. I modified slightly and added 2 T of sugar and some olive juice instead of the sweet pickles and it tastes great. You may need to add a touch more mayo.

very good recipe for potato salad as this was my first time making it. Really, the trick is to get your potatoes cooked properly. Not too soft or they will turn to mush when mixed with the other ingredients. Not too firm either or the consistency won't be right. My potatoes came out too firm, but will try again as the other ingredients were very good. I decreased the amount of sweet pickle relish by half.

This was my first try at potato salad and it was YUMMY! Very quick and easy to make. I decided an hour before supper to make Potato Salad to go with our BLTs and this was perfect! My husband enjoyed it, we did add more mustard to the recipe and substituted chopped pickles for the pickle relish. I also doubled the mayo. This will be on my summer BBQ favorite list!! Thank you!

I love this recipe.  The only thing I changed was I used dill relish instead of sweet.  I really don't like sweet relish.  Since I used the dill relish it is necessary to reduce the Garlic salt a little.

I loved this recipe.  I did tweak a lil bit.  I added more mayo and mustard (to taste, no measuring) and a just a little bit of diced red bell pepper.  Delicious.  Thanks for the recipe.

I love this recipe, it's the one I turn to for potato salad now.  The only thing I do differently is cut back on the relish, I use just a few spoons of it, and I sprinkle paprika on top for a little color.  Love it!

I just made this potato salad and it turned out great! It was the first time I had ever made potato salad and I was nervous about overcooking the potatoes but this recipe is spot on.I did add extra mayo and more eggs but other than that it didn't need anything.The recipe is easy to follow and great for the cook who is just learning.I am impressed! I will be making this again,and again,and again.

I rate this 5 b/c it is a very good "basic" recipe!  We all have different tastes; hence, we tweak most recipes accordingly by adding more or less of this n that and also, making our own personal additions.  (However, by us doing this, it definitely does NOT and SHOULD NOT give a recipe a lower rating!) Thx for sharing this recipe with us!  Like many dishes, it is best if allowed to set overnight for the taste to peak!

This was a very good recipe, just like I was used to eating as a kid. It is the style that I think is also considered southern style potato salad. Like some of the others, I used fewer eggs; one for every two potatoes. I used golden potatoes, which gave it a nice taste. I also chopped up dill pickles to use as the relish. It was good as soon as it was ready, but even better the next day. It was a big hit with my family, all who cook quite well, and now it is a dish I'm known for. Thanks!!

For a first-time-Potato-salad-maker this came out very, very nicely.  I made it for the fourth of july and got compliments on it.  I didn't have relish and ran out of time to cut pickles, but I'm sure that would have made it even better.  I also used red onion and it gave it a nice color.  Will definitely make again!

I used dill pickle cut up very finely instead of the sweet pickle relish, and left out the celery and egg (personal preference).  I took another reviewer's suggestion and grated the onion and that was a really good idea.  I used a bit more mustard and it turned out quite delicious.  I am not a fan of potato salad but I even surprised myself and really liked this.

Excellent.  I did omit the onion (since my family and I do not like onions), used mayo instead of mayonnaise and used dry mustard in lieu of prepared mustard.

This was my first attempt at Potato salad and I got great compliments from the family!! I did change a few things, I skipped the celery and celery salt, used 3/4 cup relish, 1 cup mayo because its seemed dry to me, used regular salt instead of garlic salt too. I will use this again...thanks!

I wish I could have given this 10 stars! This is the best potato salad I've ever eaten & was the hit of the cookout. I'll never use another recipe because this one was perfect. I used pickle relish as suggested however it would have been good without it if you don't already have it on hand (I didn't).

I followed the directions exactly and was quite disappointed.  The potatoes were undercooked (but having followed the directions, they were 'firm but tender' when I cut them.  Once it was all mixed, it was quite apparent that they were very undercooked).  Sadly, the liquid from the pickle relish made it watery.  And for my own taste, this was not nearly creamy enough.  That's just a personal preference though.  I'll keep searching for a recipe to mimic my late mother's potato salad.

This is very similar to my family's traditional recipe. I tend to like a bit more tang in it, so I use more yellow mustard and only use Miracle Whip instead of mayo.(Not too much, as I don't like "runny" salad.) I'm also quite liberal with the pickle relish, and skip the other powdered seasonings, except for freshly ground black pepper.

Made this recipe to go with sensational steak sandwiches (from this site). I did not add the relish, personal preference and added two stalks of celery chopped. the kids don't normally like potato salad but they all tried this and three of the five liked it which is a blessing in this house.  Thanks

Excellent recipe. I just made this for a family party and it went over very well. This really is a very good recipe to bring to a gathering. None of the flavors of the ingredients are over powering so everyone liked it. I did use dijon mustard instead of prepared mustard and used a combination of miracle whip salad dressing and mayonnaise. I will be making it again.

This is a great recipe. I changed it a little for myself. I used 3 lbs of red potatoes and 1/2 a red onion, reduced to 2 eggs instead of 3, and used about a cup of mayonnaise. I left out the relish because I personally like it better without.

Made this recipe for a bbq.  Didn't have relish or celery salt but the salad was still very tasty and was very popular.  I fried bacon and added to the mix. I made it the day before it was needed and the flavours blended beautifully.  Thank you for posting

This is the recipe I was looking for-very much like my Mom made when i was growing up.  My only changes were to peel and slice the warm potatoes into a bowl and then pour 1 cup of comercial balsalmic dressing over them.  I let them marinate while I cut up the rest of the ingredients.  Also, I used diced baby dills in place of the relish.  Everyone loved it.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was yummy! I will make it again for sure. For me, it did need a little something to give it a bit of a zing but overall really great! I did use red potatoes. Their starch content is better for potato salad than a russet. It holds together better and has a better texture. I also used green onions. Overall really tasty. Thanks for the recipe!

I made this potato salad tonight, and it was outstanding. I wouldn't have thought to use this much pickle relish- (but I always follow the recipe exactly the first time I make a dish) and I'm glad I did. My wife loved it, and She usually shies away from mayo & onion. Thanks for this one!

Really good! I left the potato skins on, for my personal preference and I didn't have celery. .. so I just did without. Still very good result and quite a hit. Oh yeah, I also sprinkled in some paprika. Thanks!

Very good base recipe.  I also had to double (or more) the spices, added parsley (about 1 tablespoon).  Also, added 2 Tablespoons of sugar and doubled the mayo.  I have made this recipe by boiling the potatoes whole and then peeling and  cutting them and by peeling and cutting them before I boil them.  Either way turns out great and if you peel and cut first you have more of a handle on how soft the potatoes get.

Yum!  This recipe is most similar to my mother-in-law who has been making her potato salad for decades! Now I finally have the exact measurements.  I did make the following changes:  doubled the sauce, used green onions, sprinkled it some All Seasoning, and added about 1/4 cup of Miracle Whip to give it some tang.  I recommend making it the day before if you can--it gets better with time.

Made this yesterday for Canada Day and it was a hit!  My brother in law loves potatoe salad so I made two types from this site, this one and "Worlds Best". Both are terrific..world's best for those who like creamier salad and old fashioned for those who like their salad firmer and not so sloppy..like me!  Very tasty, thanks for the recipe!

This turned out pretty good. I used Light Mayo (and added a touch more than called for) and Nance's Spicy Mustard (ditto on the amount), but otherwise didn't change a thing. I think next time around I might play around with other seasoning. I also wish I'd read the comment about making it a day ahead...I think this will age very well.

Another excellent potato salad recipe.  Took this to potluck and was very well received.  I did add a few extras: one grated carrot, 1/4 cup fresh pasley chopped, and one pound bacon cooked and crumbled.  Potluckers unanimously crowned this as the best potato salad ever.  Thanks for the recipe!

I made this on a whim because I had extra potatoes and extra eggs from a different recipe. I don't like potato salad but my husband does, and he said "Wow, this is reall good." I only had 2 potatoes and 2 eggs. I cut everyhting back except the mayonaise and still had to add a bit of mayo. I can't imagine with 3 more potatoes and 1 more egg that 1/4 cup mayo would be enough. Other than that, this is a winner!

This was a really tasty basic recipe.  I made some slight changes- 6 potatoes (1/2 of one mashed into mayo mixture for thickness), 1 small green bell pepper in place of celery, 3 tablespoons of spicy mustard, 3 bread n butter pickle spears chopped instead of relish (with a little of the juice added), and 4-5 heaping tablespoons of mayo.  Added the three chopped eggs, salt, lots of garlic and ground pepper, and it was scrum-diddly-umptious.  It was gobbled up quickly once it cooled.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Thank you so much for this recipe, it is really yummy and even my teenage sons liked it. I didn'y have garlic and celery salts or pickle relish so just did the recipe without them and it tasted fantastic and was soooo easy! This is now a family favourite!

Thank you Thank you for such an easy and delicious recipe. I have always been afraid to fix potato salad but this recipe is easy to follow with ingredients that I had on hand. I followed the recipe to a T and it turned out great. We will have this with our Labor Day bbq on tomorrow. Again thanks this recipe is a keeper.

Great Salad!  Made for a family bar-b-que. Didn't have celery or celery salt.  Added 1/2 teaspoon of dill weed and used fat free mayonnaise.  Cut back on the onions for relatives.  Will make again with the correct amount of onion and celery salt.

Good starting point.  We were having a 4th of July get together and I decided to hunt around for a potato salad recipe.  I had to make a few changes to this ... First, I needed to double the recipe.  I found that if you use the amount of mayo stated, you end up with a very dry dish.  I also added extra seasoning (as others have stated) and I cut out the celery and used celery seed instead.  Next time I think I would cut the onions back and use a little extra relish.  Everyone seemed to love it - I didn't have any left.

We added dill seasoning to it. Had to adjust the mustard/mayo/relish/etc to fit the potatoes. We might have just had large potatoes. Adding poundage to the recipe may help in that regard.
Would make again!

It was a crowd pleaser and the best potato salad I have ever made. I added a little vinegar to the potatoes after they were cooked and still warm and chopped parsley.

I used leftover cooked red potatoes from a crawfish boil the night before and this turned out great. I was getting bored with my usual recipe passed down from my mom. Every once and awhile it's nice to stir the pot and try something  different. Very happy with the results!

This is the traditional potato salad recipe I was looking for.  It was absolutely delicious!  It had the same taste as the potato salads I ate when I was a kid.  You can add whatever you like from this point to make it a bit different it you prefer.  I loved it just the way it is......yum!

Just made this last night. Although I didn't have any relish on hand, and had to improvise by cutting up a couple of pickles I had left, it turned out great! Was just the flavor of potato salad I was looking for. I did toss in about a tsp or two of  balsamic vinegar because I remember my girlfriend telling me something about a really good potato salad recipe that uses vinegar. Will definitely make this version for family get togethers, etc.

This recipe is classic potato salad and it's delish! I followed the recipe but only made changes for my personal preference. I used 5 large russet potatoes and it's enough for 2-3 people for 2 days. I followed other reviews advice and added about a 1/3 C of pickle juice. I added about twice the mayo, cut the celery in half, added a little extra onion, chopped dill pickle instead of sweet relish, 1 extra egg, no garlic salt, and sliced radish for flavor and color. I topped with smoked paprika. I love green onion in my potato salad but didn't have any on hand. I'll definitely make again! Scrumptious!

I will use this recipe again. I chopped the potatoes first, adding garlic salt for flavor and vinegar to the water so they don't overcook. I only used 4 potatoes. Turned out a little extra saucy, which is fine. And I added some dill weed. Very good!

The only thing I do differently is blend the mustard & mayo salt & pepper (might add a touch of milk to make it creamier) and pour it over the potatoes & eggs so they don't take such a beating with all the stirring.

yes, I made it tonight. It is now chilling in the fridge. I tasted it and loved it. I used red potatoes and cooked them way past what the recipe said, b/c I forgot they were still boiling. Having read some of the negative reviews, I am glad I didn't undercook them. I had only 2 eggs, so that's what's in it. All the rest of the ingred. I had, except the celery seed. I'm sure it will be great tomorrow. Thanks for a good recipe. I read someone thought it needed sugar! EWW, no.

My family does not like relish so I've omitted that but a friend's mother added an item I've now used also - peeled and sliced and diced cucumber.  Along with the celery it adds a nice crunch and a very good flavor.  Have never seen this in any potato salad recipe but recommend it highly.

I make mine two ways, depending on my mood. One way is just like this except I cut up some sweet gherkins instead of relish. This is how my mom always made it.
Second way is to leave out the eggs, add dill pickle, black olives, and some capers.
Two different slants on an American classic.

I agree with jettyw78, a it more mayo and maybe dubble cream. Dill pickled gherkins is actually the best. Use the juice of the gherkins to savour the potatoes, its not so harsh in taste.

I don't use relish--not a big fan.  However, I like to use half low fat sour cream and half mayo.  It makes it a little less heavy.

I have made this recipe for many years. The only changes..... I never measured anything, depending on how large the crowd. I added some of the sweet relish juice for moisture, mixed sour cream & mayonnaise, mustard together. Add salt & pepper to taste if needed. Leftovers (if any) good as long as it lasts. My son thought I should market it along with fried chicken!
Another potato quickie----
When unexpected guests stick around for dinner. Dice the potatoes then boil them until tender, drain, make a cheddar cheese white sauce to pour over & lightly mix in. Guests will think you are a professional chef.

This is very similar to the recipe I've always made, much like my mothers' and grandmothers'. I make my own sweet relish and this salad is a staple of our summer diet.  Everyone seems to like it.

This is the recipe my Mom taught me 40 years ago. I use 1/2 low fat mayo and 1/2 fat free sour cream. I'm not much of a mayo lover, so this substitution works perfect.

I loved this. It had so much flavor and texture. I always like to find ways to use my own eggs and this was perfect. I did add 1/4 cup of Ranch salad dressing. And I added 2 more eggs. Not that it needed it. This was really a good recipie and I have saved it to mark it so I can find it easily to make it again. I also wrote it down in my recipie book

This is an easy side dish to make. You definitely need to add about a cup or more of mayo. I also diced used about 1/2 a cup of diced kosher pickles and 1/2 cup of a cucumber. I used Mrs. Dash in place of the celery and garlic salt. Turned out great. I will make it again.

This is a great start to potato salad. I added more mayo and substituted celery seed for celery salt. Also I used dill relish instead of sweet. The sweet would be a great taste to incorporate, just didn't have any.

I'm not a fan of potato salad in general but I was asked to prepare one so I tried this recipe. Cooking time for the potatoes was not enought so my potatoes weren't cooked enough (even though I boiled them longer than instructed). I thought the recipe was ok.

Great and easy recipe.  My additions was dill weed - 1 tbsp 
More Mayo, and Tsp Dijon mustard added for tang, but not too much. Fresh Parsley & Paprika on the for the Pretty.
 This is my TEST  run for this recipe. I plan to make it again for Easter.  Every thing else was perfect.  And, yes!  Very yummy

I would love to give this five stars because on second try it ended up turning out really delicious, but can't because if you follow the directions you'll end up with tasteless potatoes that are mushy on the outside and crunchy on the inside. Peal and cut the potatoes BEFORE boiling, also add salt to your water and you'll end up with a really yummy potato salad!

really tasty!!  I dont like raw onion so I left it out and added 1 more egg to the recipe.  I also added 2 tsp of dill.  It was delish!  Even my mother in law who is a picky eater ate 6 helpings. She could not stop.  I will definately make this again

Great recipe!  I only changed a few things. . . I used dill relish instead of sweet; didn't have garlic salt or celery, so I increased the celery salt to 1/2 tsp and used garlic powder instead.  Turned out fabulous! Thanks for sharing :o)

Very good! Tastes like my great aunt's! I chopped the onion really fine because I don't like big pieces of onion in my food. I also cut back on the relish to 1/4 cup.

Add 1/4 Cup of Cilantro and 2-4 Hot peppers Grilled and/or finely chopped for a spicy kick! This is a great Potato Salad either way!

As one of my guests exclaimed, "This taste just like my Grandma used to make it"! A BIG hit with guests and will forever keep this combination of ingredients close by. I may put in a bit more mayo & mustard next time to offer it a bit more of a creamier texture. Otherwise, I have found my base recipe for potato salad!!

Loved this recipe and my family did as well. Used table salt instead of celery salt, and added 1 Tbl. of chopped pimento for color.

This was good, quick, and better the next day.  I added about 1/8 cup of Miracle Whip and used chopped sweet pickles (1/4 C) and it was creamy with just the right sweetness.  Definitely a keeper!

This is a great old fashioned recipe.  Basic ingredients are all here.  You can add or deduct any of the ingredients to your particular taste.  I have never used garlic salt in potato salad before, but found I liked it very much.  Little green onions would be good in season also.

Nothing beats my Mom's but this was pretty good!  I doubled the recipe and followed as is except I chopped up bread and butter pickles since I didn't have relish and I also added a tablespoon of vinegar.  As in some of the pictures I garnished with chopped egg slices and paprika.  YUM!

Tweaked the relish to my favorite (tangy dill), had 5 leftover eggs from Easter, and a couple more potatoes, and free-handed the mayo. YUM!!!

My boyfriend and I both found this potato salad disgusting. I followed the recipe exactly how it says. So disappointing and such a waist of ingredients. The flavor was gross and did not taste like any Old Fashioned potato salad I've ever tried. I will never make this again.

Very good, helpful tip, I peeled and cut up the potatoes and put the eggs in with them to boil. Also cut up sweet pickles and added as opposed to the relish.

Just made this tonight. Used dill relish instead of sweet and added one more egg and an extra potato and 1/2 cup mayo. Sprinkled paprika on top and chopped onion and celery very small and thin and potato cubed small also. Very good!

My very picky family said this was the best potato salad they have ever had.  The only thing I might add every once in awhile as an extra is some black olives.

Not much flavor.... I didn't use pickle relish but that is because we don't like pickles. Could use a little more seasoning. I did put some greek seasoning in it. That helped a little.

My mom has always been the potato salad maker in the family. We had a get together where I brought the potato salad. I didn't have her recipe and this was the first one I came across. I'm glad I did because my mom said she likes this better than her own recipe because of the celery! I made it as directed just added a little more miracle whip.

I used a 3lb bag of baby white potatoes. Quartered and then boiled them. By the time I peeled the skins off, they were cool. I used 1/2 cup celery, a full 1/4 cup chopped red onion. I didn't use celery salt.  I used two big heaping serving spoons of Hellmans Mayo (the best), a big tablespoon of relish, a double sqirt of Grey Poupon, salt and pepper. Oh and I only used two hard boiled eggs.  Delish. Everyone loved it. Nothing like a good homemade potato salad. Good recipe to follow. Thanks.

I liked the fact that this wasn't totally smothered in mayonnaise like the kind you usually get at the store.  Next time I might leave out the eggs.  I used dill relish and it seemed to turn out well - might try the sweet relish next time!

Just made this over the weekend and it turned out great!  I did cut back on the relish and onion and added a bit more mayo, just because that's the way we prefer it.  This was a great base recipe to adjust to your families likes!  I will definitely be making this again!!!

Felt this was a good recipe. My husband liked it. However I felt it was missing something I think might be one recipe I will use again but play with it a bit next time.

I love this recipe! It tastes just like my mom and grandmother's. And that's saying something being a southern woman and all ;-) haha Anyway, I really dislike the taste of super tangy potato salad that you can only eat several spoonfuls of. This is the way potato salad should taste! I am so happy I found this. My mom wouldn't give me her recipe lol. I'm going to mess with her and bring this baby out to a family gathering and see what she says. Good job!!

Easy to make and tastes great too.  I halfed the sweet relish because its to sweet for me and doubled the hard boiled eggs which you can't have to much of.

Great recipe. I made a few changes based on some of the reviews. I used 1/2c mayo, 1t garlic salt, and 1t ground pepper. I grated the onion and used dill pickle relish. It was super good easy and fast!

Very good... although it seemed heavy on the pickle relish.  Next time I'll cut it down to 1/4 cup and drain the liquid from it before adding it.  Even as it was, everyone loved the tanginess and it made a nice addition to our summer picnic dinner.

Excellent salad. We enjoyed it the 1st day, but is definitely better the next day. I would add less onion next time. I thought it over powered the other flavors.

I never really measure anything when I make this. I make the sauce ahead of time then pour it over the veggies when it tastes good. I use a little bit of sugar and dill pickles instead of sweet pickles. I use more like 1/4 cup pickles and usually more mayo, but I like it kind of saucy, because after a day or two it starts drying out. If it lasts that long!

I agree, dill pickles w/ a splash of juice and 1/3 cup mayo. I chopped everything up to lil bits and used a potato masher for the perfect consistancy.  Very yummy!

Made as written, very good! I think the potatoes were a little under cooked. I like them firm, but they were a bit under cooked. The picture looks like a white dressing, it is yellow. Will make again with a little more mayo.

This is a good basic recipe. The only adjustment I made was more Mayo, other than that it was perfect.  Definitely be making it again.

Very nice recipe. I mashed half of the potatoes with the egg yolks for more texture variation. I'll probably add a little diced red bell pepper just for some color.

Yummy.  I did add distilled vinegar as someone recommended, and will definitely make this again.

I thaught this recipe was perfect however i do recomend cooking the potatoes longer than this recipe says me potatoes came out too firm and i didnt relize untill i mixed all of my ingridients so it wasnt as good as it could have been. i loved the dressing and i made a small changes i had to cut up a sweet pickle for the relish and did not add the onions. wonderful!!! :D

Nice potato salad recipe. I decreased the sweet pickle relish to 1/4 c. per my familys tates and increased the mayonnaise to 3/4 c. for added moistness. I really has a nice flavor and I will be makeing it again.

I didn't have pickle relish and that must've been what's severely lacking, because this wasn't my favorite. I'm looking for a recipe that isn't as heavy.

I liked the eggs in this salad.  I didn't have celery or celery salt even though still good without, it would have been better with.  Next time I'll add more mustard.

Added a little additional mayo and a 1/2 the mustard, omitted the celery salt, used white pepper, instead of relish I added about a tsp of sweet pickle juice and a splash of white vinegar.  Excellent!!  Thanks for the recipe!!!

The potato salad was good however I discarded the celery and used 1 cup of chopped green pepper and 1 cup of chopped tomatoes. I'm not a big fan of celery so I preferred it that way.  A few months later I made the recipe again and this time I chose to include the celery as well. I also kept using the extra ingredients I added. My boyfriend liked it much, much better. I still prefer it without the celery.   Again, it was good :) I just felt it was missing a few things - at least for my taste buds.

This was awesome.  I have always just thrown stuff together like my mother did.  She also used MW.  I had a big crowd and tried this...my adult daughter said it was the best potato salad that she had ever tasted!  I used dill relish instead of sweet for our preferences.  Putting this one in the recipe box!

Very tasty and easy to make!  I've never made potato salad before and I am happy I now have a "go to" recipe for it.  I used red potatoes and kept the skins on.  I also did not add celery because my husband doesn't like it.  It still turned out great.  Like other reviewers, I did add more mayo.

This was OK but not our favorite.  I wanted to try this because sometimes people’s taste change and I thought maybe I have grown to like mustard in my potato salad but found out none of my family does.  I had to add a lot more than ¼ cup of mayo because it was quite dry.  I will most likely stick to my mixture of sour cream and mayo, no mustard or relish and add bacon pieces.

This is the classic potato salad. It was great. I did add a little paprika to the top of mine, and my husband put bacon bits on his. It does not need to be changed at all. It was even better the following day.

I think this wasn't the best I've ever had in life, but it was on-par with what they sell at the deli for a much higher price. I thought it just needed a little more salt than the recipe called for. I don't think I'll ever pay for the deli's potato salad again - I never knew how easy potato salad was to make!

i have always had a ridiculous fear of making potato salad because of the thin balance between undercooked potatoes and overcooked potatoes. however, i tackled my fear head on with this recipe and it turned out fantastic!  i did omit the celery and added dill weed and paprika.  this will be my go to potato salad from now on.  thanks!

This is an awesom recipe. I made it with some changes suggested in the reviews like the cut up dill pickles and used the juice. For some reason I used green onions which worked out fine. I've already been asked for this recipe!!! Definately 5 *****'s

This is the best potato salad I have ever had!  I only had 1/4 cup of sweet relish and I also added a bit more mayo.  This will be one I make again!   Update:  I made this again and I had the whole 1/2 cup of sweet relish... YUCK!  It is way too sweet!  I will stick with the 1/4 cup of relish!

My grandma used to make the BEST potato salad ever...but the problem is she never wrote it down, it was more of a toss and taste kind of recipe. Ever since I got married I have been in search of a recipe similar in order to make the changes necessary for it to be exactly like Grandma's. Forget trying to find something similar....this is IT! I don't think she used onions or relish so I think next time I will try it without. But I really did like it with! I also felt that 1/4 cup of mayo just wasn't enough so I instead used just over 1/2 cup and it was just the PERFECT amount! 5 stars+...this is fantastic!

I made this for a BBQ and I was not impressed.  It was way to dry so I added more mayo and very bland so I added a little vinegar which helped a little bit. Needless to say all the food I made was gone except for the potato salad. I will continue my search for the perfect potato salad.

This was the 1st potato salad I had made-please bear in mind I may have made it wrong. But I found the mustad gave the salad a off putting color and the pickle relish made it to soupy. I even added more mayo trying to get the consistency right.Was edible but will not attempt to make again

This was good, my fiance loved it! I used red potatoes, omitted the celery and added extra mayo.  Next time I will use less mustard.

This was absolutely delicious and disappeared quickly!  I doubled the mayo because it was little drier than I liked.

I chopped and peeled the potatoes before I cooked them, which cut down on the cooking time. I also added Pakrika. Other than that I followed the recipe and it was great!

Being in the south, potato salad needs to taste and look a certain way. I made this recipe though I added another 1/4 cup of mayo and used dill relish instead of sweet. Oh and cooked the potatoes for 18 minutes-after cooking only 15 minutes they were still crunchy. Came out perfect like this.

This seemed to be the best recipe for making just a regular potato salad. This was my first attempt at one so I think it went pretty well. I also made substitutions. I added about 2 tbsp more mayo because 1/4 cup was not nearly enough. I also put less celery because i do not care for it that much. I used my magic bullet to chop up the onion and celery smaller so it blended well. Other than that, this was a good recipe to follow. I wasn't sure if i should have cut the potatoes before hand but I did as it said and it was a little messy but it worked.

Nuts! Another bad review (I really hate giving less than 3 * to anything I rate). Made this to accompany Actually delicious Turkey Burgers (of which I was NOT a fan). Unfortunately, I must agree w/ Nobody'sGirl. This potato salad was mediocre & tasteless (it wasn't dry, but that is because I 1/2'd the recipe & made enough dressing for the full 8 servings). All I could taste was celery - & nothing else! I usually make minor changes here & there, & this time is no exception. I made one change to suit my tastes. I subbed chopped sweet gherkins for relish (chopped pickles seemed more appealing even though I had relish on hand). I used red potatoes, which I cooked for about 12.5 min. & then let cool to room temp. b4 peeling/dicing. A good friend (a true southern belle) instructed me to do this. She said my potatoes should be soft, not "mushy" (yet firm enough to stab with a knife). She also told me to use red or Yukon golds instead of Idaho's (I've also researched this on the WWW and it is true that Idahos should be reserved for baking). I think I should have cooked my potatoes for the full 15 minutes as directed, maybe even a bit longer b/c they were crunchy (although they didn't appear to be when I was dicing them...). I am not the master of boiling potatoes (I seem to never cook them well enough), so part of the prob. is me... lol :o) Regardless, I will not be making this again. Sorry!

Mediocre, dry, generally tasteless. Everyone ate some of it, but were vocal about how bland it was. It looks fabulous, and it smells pretty good, but it unfortunately goes downhill from there. Even doubling the celery salt, mayo, mustard, relish portion didn't save it. I really hope the huge bowl of this sitting in the fridge magically seeps up flavor and becomes edible, else this was a waste of ingredients and time. Please BEWARE unless you have an intensely sensitive palate. Very sorry, it looks good and I can't fault the instructions, but it seems all the good reviews added a million things. Waaaay too much tweaking required, will not attempt again.

I really like this potato salad.  I made enough for 10 people.  It tastes clean and classic yet southern.  I do think it needs just a little something to give it that uummmph!  But this recipie the perfect one to add that uummmph to!

I was looking for an easier recipe as teh one I use is complicated and uses lots of ingredients so I tried this. I didn't use celery simply because I didn't have any but otherwise followed the recipe. It is delicious! I was hesitant to put in garlic as thought it would be too overpowering but it isn't. This will now be my standard potato salad recipe.

This was good! I used 6 Yukon Gold potatoes and cut them in half before boiling.  15 mins did the trick.  I omitted the celery and added a bit more mayo for a smoother consistency. I topped with paprika.  Great!

I'm not a huge fan of potato salad, but the rest of my family is. I made this for my husband, and he and the kids ate the whole big bowl in one evening. I did need to add much more mayo than called for, as he wanted it creamier than usual. I also followed another reviewer's tip and added a tablespoon or two of miracle whip in with the reg. mayo. It was a hit and I will certainly be making it again.

delicious! I garnished with sprouts and it added a refreshing twist to each bite! I laid sprouts inside a bowl then scooped the potato salad on top of the sprouts.  Then place the dish on top of of the bowl and flip the contents out.  the sprouts added a lovely decoration.

Very good. I don't think its the best I've ever had but definitely good. In all fairness I didnt have any celery salt or garlic salt. I used garlic powder and added regular salt. It was a little too much pickle for me so next time I'll add half. The mustard was great though and next time I might up the celery and mayo. If you need a basis for potato salad this is a good place to start.

I do not add celery, because I simply don't like it - but otherwise this recipe is just perfect for our family.

I change this up a bit...I use dill pickles, and green onion, and dijon mustard.  I also don't add the celery but that's just personal preference.  It's a great base recipe to change up as you see fit!

Easy recipe, but everyone agreed it lacked a little flavor.  I followed the advice of others mixing yellow and dijon mustard, but still needed something more.  Maybe more eggs and more salt will help next time.

I ended up with way too much relish for my liking in the potato salad. Next time I'll cut down on the amount of relish and mustard.

A lot of adjustments needed to be made, but this was a very good start.

Recommend chopped dill pickles (instead of sweet relish), doubling the mayo, doubling the spices, and doubling the eggs. Add a little fresh dill and some chopped black olives, and you have a hit!

Love it!!  Just what I think of when I think "traditional" potato salad.  I think you HAVE to use the sweet pickle relish.  My only complaint is - how much is "5 potatoes"?  I prefer a weight - I think I used about half of a 5 lb bag of red potatoes and upped the dressing a bit.  Also, a good think to remember is to cut your potatoes up BEFORE you cook them if they are not pretty uniform in size.  Two of mine were a good bit bigger than the others and they ended up rather al dente (not what I want in my potato salad!)

I left out the relish and added a tablespoon ( a splash anyway) of vinegar to the mayo instead. Its just what this recipe needed I think.

This tastes great!! I give it 4 stars because after 20 minutes my potatoes were still too firm (finding out after I cooled, peeled, chopped and added dressing). I also had to add about an add'l 1/2 cup of mayo. It would be much too dry without. Otherwise, all ingredients remained the same. I will still try this recipe again because it tasted so good.

Double the spices and then this is really good. I used pickles instead of celery and omitted the onion. A real classic.

I've been on the hunt for a good potato salad recipe for several years, but never liked adding vinegar to the recipe. This recipe makes excellent potato salad!!! I used dill pickle instead of sweet relish, but that was my personal preference. This is definitely a keeper that I will use over and over again!

This was very good.  I used Yukon Gold potatoes, they are firm and hold their shape.  I increased the Mayo to 1/3 cup and added 2 Tablespoons of heavy cream to the sauce.   I will make this one again.

This was my first attempt EVER at potato salad.  It was a fathers day request from my future dad-in-law so I was quite nervous!  This turned out really good.  I did add quite a bit more mayo, about another 1/2 cup, plus a heaping tblspn of miracle whip and then about a teaspoon of sugar.  That made it perfect! Thanks for the recipe, there was none left!

We loved this potato salad. We did leave the skins on the potatoes and tossed them with a little red wine vinegar while they were still warm. Cut the relish in half and added bacon instead of celery. I was worried that if it didn't get finished I would find it in a pool of water the next morning.Both my husband and I like it served warm but we've had it cold and it was just as yummy. Thank you for such a really easy recipe.

This recipe is exactly what potato salad should taste like. It needed a little more mayonnaise and next time I will add more celery and egg but other then that the ingredients blend together perfectly.

I just made this potato salad--my first attempt at potato salad ever--last night, and had it with dinner tonight.  WOW!  It received rave reviews, and it tasted just like I was hoping it would!  This recipe is definately a keeper, and will be a regular feature throughout the summer grilling season. Thank you for sharing it!  So simple, and SO delicious!

Delicious!  Just make sure that the potatos you use are medium size or cut down from 5 large to about 3 large potatos. I agree with the other reviewers about cutting back on sugar and using about 1/2 of the cream mixture. With these adjustments, it was perfect!! I added sliced egg to the top to decorate along with a few shakes of paprika. Yummy!

My first time making potato salad.  Got great comments from family.  I changed the sweet relish, to self chopped dill pickles.  Klausen of course.  I used celery seed instead of the celery salt.  I also cut up the potatoes before cooking.  It took about 35 minutes for 8.

In the future, I would need to cook the potatoes and the eggs for a few more minutes.  The potatoes, in particular, were a bit too underdone for my taste.  I left out the celery for personal preference.  Next time, I'd probably cut back on the onion also.  I added some chopped dill pickles and pickle juice.  This is the first time I've made potato salad and I'll be able to try a few things differently next time!  Good recipe!

Really great potato salad. I didn't have celery so I added some celery seed. I used onion powder (about a 1/2 tsp, maybe a little more, I use the palm of my hand to measure so not sure exactly)instead of real onion, so I wouldn't have to pick out chunks later. I used plain garlic powder instead of garlic salt to cut down some of the sodium. I made the "dressing" separate and then just lightly tossed the egg/potato mix with it. I used yukon gold potatoes since that is what I had on hand. Very good as it is, but hubby asked for double the pickle relish.

This is one of my favorites.  I do tweak it a little by upping the egg ratio, but it's a great basic recipe that I turn to often.

I lost my mom's recipe for potato salad and her's was the best. I found this recipe and it seemed as close to her's as possible so I decided to try it. It was pretty good but still not like my mom's. Also, it needs more mayo. I also regret putting the relish in, because it made the salad way too sweet. So I added more seasoning salt to balance the sweetness. I may try this recipe again but I will definitely omit the relish and add more mayo.

This isn't bad at all but I have had better potato salads at this website. I must say that I did not have relish and hence I added pepperoncini with a light sprinkling of sugar instead. Its a decent salad for a change certainly.

I was looking for something "new" to make with potatoes and came upon this recipe.  It was delicious!  I chopped up a couple of pickles instead of relish and I used a red onion but I am sure it would have been just as tasty either way.  A new favorite to goes great with shake n'bake at my house!

This is an easy, delicious potato salad! I cut the potatoes before boiling to make it easier and add chopped green olives. My family loves it and requests it frequently. Thank you for the great recipe!

This was a pretty good potato salad.  My first attempt at making one, and it was very easy!  It was slightly- and I mean slightly bland.  But I just added alittle salt, and a little more seasoning and it was just fine. I will be making again soon!

The sweet pickle relish doesn't taste as good to me as the chopped up pickles and I think it needs a little more mayo for my taste.

I used dijon mustard and kosher salt instead of what was recommended.  An excellent turn on classic potato salad.  You won't be disappointed.

I found this recipe this summer when I needed to bring a dish to a cookout. I have never made potato salad before. It was a big hit! Made it again on Labor Day and everyone loved it.  I didn't really follow the mayo quanitity: I just added it until it had a nice creamy consistency. Also, I chopped up pickles instead of the relish and used green onions finely chopped and red potatoes to save the peeling.  You can use this recipe as a "jumping off" point and tweak to your taste. Great, crowd-pleasing recipe!

I love this recipe! The only thing I did different was to add spicy mustard to offset the sweetness of the relish. I made this once with regular yellow mustard and thought it was too sweet. My husband loved this recipe, and he’s not a big fan of potato salad because he thinks they all have too much mayonnaise.

A good basic potato salad. I used plain yogurt instead of mayo and increased the amount as per others' suggestions, which was a good idea. Next time I'll increase the pickle relish and mustard for more zing. Be sure to dice the potatoes small. (I chopped them before boiling and didn't peel them.)

Good basic recipe.  After cooking the russet potatoes, I left the skin on and cubed them into smaller bite sized pieces.  I used finely chopped red onions but added another  1/4 cup.   I also increased the mayo by approx 1/8 cup.

Love this tasty recipe. Sometimes I leave the egg out, depending on my guests. And I use dill relish because I'm a fan! Love the flavors that come together in this recipe.

This recipe is a winner. I make it vegan by omitting the eggs and using the vegan Hellman's mayo. It tastes exactly the same and doesn't upset my stomach the way regular mayo does. I'll be making this again and again.

Good recipe just made a couple of changes
- peeked the potatoes prior to boiling
- added 1/2 cup of carrots diced and 1/2 cup diced celery 
- used low fat mayo instead of regular and used 1 cup. 1/4 wasn’t doing it, way to dry. 
- omitted celery salt 
- added garlic powder instead of garlic salt
- used a dijion grainy mustard

I love eggs and my bunch loves potato salad, so I doubled the recipe, using a total of 10 potatoes and 10 eggs.  
The only adjustment I will make to this absolutely amazing recipe next time,  (that tastes exactly like my mama’s), is to add more salt initially, as it needed more in the end.
Otherwise, it was out of this world!!!  So if you’re looking for a potato salad recipe that tastes just like “mama used to make”, look no further!!

Was really good but I found I needed to add a bit more mayo and horseradish as mine was quite dry. I also added a few drops of Worcestershire and it really brought it all together.

This was a fun and easy recipe to follow. It allows for tasting and adjusting however you like, which I did because I didn't have all the ingredients. On a side note, the instructions for cooking the eggs blew my mind. They came out looking nice and clean - yellow and white, no weird greenish color - and perfectly cooked with this method.  I didn't have relish or pickles or pickle juice, so I used some apple cider vinegar for that missing tart flavor. I also boiled a garlic clove in the water and mashed it into the salad mixture for another dimension.  I didn't use onion but instead used scallion and chives. Didn't have celery salt, but used a cup of celery as the recipe calls for, and salt and pepper. Next time I will add a little more salt, or a seasoning salt, but it was DELICIOUS - and my partner thought so too. He may have liked it more than me!

This was not the potato salad I was in search of. The potatoes needed to be cooked longer, the salad was totally dry even when adding additional mayo and mustard. There was really no flavor at all - and certainly no tang like I was hoping for. Guess I'll keep searching.

I made a couple of changes, dill relish instead of sweet, a TBS of rice vinegar added to the mayo and mustard.  It was a hit.  I would use this recipe again!

I did, though, switch out sweet pickled relish for 2 dill pickle spears. We're more of a savoury than sweet family.

Really good potato salad. But the relish overpowers the whole flavor profile. I only used half of what the recipe called for and it was still the dominant flavor. 

Next time, I'm going to just use some diced dill pickle or a little vinegar for the acidity.  And maybe a pinch of sugar 
or some cranberries for some slight sweetness.

Made up a big bowl of baby red potatoes, left the peel on. Followed one reviewer's tip of adding mayo and seasonings to warm potatoes - seemed to be good! I'll know tomorrow when I eat the leftovers :) Used dill pickles instead of sweet relish.

I've been making this for so many years now, that i just eyeball the ingredients. The only thing i do different is replace the celery with shredded carrot. Oh, and i found 2 eggs is enough so i slice the 3rd one and fan it out on top as garnish with some chives, and a dusting of paprika.  Thank you Jewellkay!

Made as written, less the celery (did not have any). Good base recipe. I added in chopped scallions, 1/2 tsp dill, 1/2 tsp celery seed and lots of fresh ground black pepper. Delightful!

This is a just little different from my "Old Fashioned Potato Salad" but I did end up adding 1 cup of mayonnaise, it was just too dry for me. I did like the addition of mustard and using relish from a jar is a lot easier than extra chopping and provides a bit of extra moisture.  I added the 1/2 cup of onion but it was finely minced not chopped, biting into a chopped chunk of onion is not pleasant.

This recipe is amazing. I only made a few changes added 3/4 cup of mayo as I like mine a little more creamy. Added garlic powder and 3/4 tablespoon of mustard.  It came out excellent!!

Yes, I never put potatoes into hot water...start them from cold water.   It all turned out great, except for the fact that I had never used sweet relish...and Ive learned something new...delicious!   Thanks

Pretty basic potato salad. I did add a half cup of green peas for looks but the recipe is ok as is. One point I’d like to make is about the directions for boiled eggs. Doesn’t anyone know how to boil eggs? Do not put them in cold water!!, bring the water to a boil then add the eggs if you want to be able to peel them. Also do not allow them to cool slowly but rather cool them immediately in ice water. Ok, not trying to be a know it all but once you do it this way you will thank me. Yes I am a professional chief (in my on mind).

I put a little less sweet relish because I ran out and added a little Cajun seasoning and one pickled onion and it was delicious.  I wish my husband liked peas and corn in his potato salad because I would have added that.  I think I'll create my own side potato salad.  Thanks for the recipe tho!

i made a batch and a half for a family get-together.  wonderful recipe. i added 1/3 of a cup of pimentos and it was a really nice flavor contrast. the methodology for hard boiling eggs in this recipe is the best i have found yet.

Tasty, but don't add full amount of relish (if you use relish, drain it first). I think chopped pickles would be better-less moisture. Will definitely make again!

This was my first attempt of making my own Potato salad and it was a huge success. Making it again tonight  (per my hunny's request) only thing I'm switching up is no fresh celery. Neither of us were fond of it. Other than that I think this is gonna be my go-to for tator salad!

Made this several times.  I leave out the relish because I like it better without it.  Also used celery seeds instead of celery salt.

I usually don't use a recipe but I decided today that I didn't want to do any guessing on ingredients. Besides this way I didn't use up all of my mustard and mayonaise.

This potato salad was great. I made a few modifications and it was a hit at the bbq. Folks are VERY judgmental of potato salad. I increased the mayo and mustard. I added some dry mustard and sugar, I garnished with paprika because it looks pretty on top. My grandma use to give the potatoes an ice bath after cooking to stop them for cooking any more. It keeps potatoes from get to soft.

Very good potato salad. It’s sweet, but that’s how my family have always made it. I used about a cup of miracle whip plus a tablespoon of mayo but next time I’ll try half miracle whip and half mayo to make it a little less sweet. I also doubled the potatoes, used garlic powder instead of garlic salt, and added a healthy pinch of celery seeds. Thanks for the recipe!

We usually make potatoe salad with lemon olive oil dressing but I wanted to try something different and chose this from the zillions of recipes out there. My family and guests loved it and so did I. Didn't have celery salt or garlic salt so I used a dash of garlic powder and celery seed. The mustard I added by sight so it might have been more than 1 T and the mayo I probably overshot was well. But the generous chopped celery, a touch of onion and the sweet relish really worked well for us.

Made this twice in the last week at the request of my hubby. Followed the recipe exactly except that I peeled and diced the potatoes prior to boiling, and I used chopped dill pickles instead of sweet relish. So, so good! Very easy to make too.

I added more mayo because I'm from Georgia and I didn't have an onion so I omitted it. Other than that, I made this exactly how it was written and I'm pretty sure someone stole this from my Mom. Or maybe this is the standard southern recipe.  Either way I'll definitely make this again, especially the next time she's visiting.

I added a half teaspoon of sugar becuase I thought it needed more sweetness.  I grated the onion as one other review suggested which was a great idea.  I used 3/4 bag of a 5lb bag of red pot.  I boiled the pot whole, peeled and chopped after I cooked them. I doubled the mayo and other dressing ingred.  I also used dry mustard in place of prepared mustard.  Next time I will try prepared mustard and also add some paprika.  It was very good but it still needs some tweaking.....just not sure what it is?   SEcond time  I used small bag of yellow pot and boiled with skin on, cooled and then peeled.  left out onion but made same as last time.  I think it had too much celery seed, next time reduce a  little.

GIVE it some spice!  Add a few (according to your taste) thinly sliced green onions, diced pickled jalopeno peppers and pickled capers.  With a few slightly sauteed crawfish tails, you will have an elegant dish fit for a king!

Pretty much made it as stated. I like it crunchy so I added a tad more celery and onion than called for. Didn't have celery salt on hand but it was still great. I will make this again.

I had potatoes to use up before they went bad, so I found this recipe which is similar to what my mom used to make. To save time and pans, I put 5 russet potatoes chopped in fourths in a covered dish with a small amount of water to save time in the microwave. I didn't have enough sweet pickle relish, so I chopped a couple of baby dill pickles into the potatoes, I also had to used celery flakes, instead of celery salt, because I don't use it enough to keep it around. I added 4 more tablespoons of mayonnaise since it seemed a bit on the dry side. My mom used to add black olives and add a sprinkling of purprikka. I decided to go by the recipe ,and my husband really like this potato salad as did I. As with another reviewers, I agree it's better tasting to wait another day for the flavors to really develop. I will make this again, but it is a little time consuming with all the chopping it takes. Worth the effort in the long run.

I was looking for a standard potato salad recipe. My recipe is currently in storage. This one was close to what I remember so I tried. I knew the mayo would need to be tripled or more. It did. I used Miracle Whip about 1 & 3/4 Cup. Pretty much everything else was the same. Salt, Garlic, Celery & table & pepper to taste. Came out beautifully.

A good base. I made a few changes. 
I added thinly sliced radishes, used dill and sweet relish, I didn't have celery salt so I used celery flakes, added nature's seasoning, used Dijon not yellow mustard, added pimentos, added fresh dill and parsley.

This was a very good potato salad even though I didn't have any celery.  Needs a lot of onion and I used extra garlic as always.  Very easy to put together.  Will make this one again.

Not good.  I made this by the recipe, and ended up having to make a lot of changes to make it to my liking... As many reviewers said, there wasn't enough mayo.  I also prefer dill to sweet relish, so I added a lot of dill pickle.  I also added more celery salt and think it could have used more egg.  I sprinkled with paprika on top.  Even these changes just made it "ok".  And, yes, I do love potato salad.  Just not this recipe.

It's a keeper. Spuds must be boiled&cooled ahead of time, i.e. the day before. Pickle relish - yes! 4 eggs. Radish. Green onion. Celery. 1&1/2 tsp dry mustard. Miracle Whip w Olive Oil. Paprika on top. Omit garlic & celery salt, they are totally and completely unnecessary.

This was amazing.... I did add a little extra celery and onions though, but that was the only changes I made. Seasonings were spot on.

This is pretty much my go to for Potato Salad. Can't miss with this one as all the ingredients are very flexible.  Might point out to beginners that you should choose potatoes that hold their shape or texture could end up being "mealy". If unsure use Russets, an all round potato. I'm finding that a lot of potatoes now have printed on their bags what they are best for.  
Like another reviewer  who uses dill pickle instead, I've actually done it both ways. It changes it up - in a nice way!  
A summer favourite!

My mother and mother in law made the best potatoes salad they both made it the same too. They both were raised in different areas of USA and ever met each other till my husband and I married. Neither shared their recipe. I have looked for it for years. I finely found it here. Thanks very much

To make this a bit healthier I used low fat cottage cheese instead of mayo - it was so much lighter with no loss of flavor!  I also used green onion,  added cilantro and fresh garlic, cut the "flavored" salts and just used freshly ground sea salt.  It was delish!

I use this as my ingredients but I do something additional.   I dice bacon and fry it up while the potatoes are boiling.   Then I reserve some of the grease and saite the onions.   From there I follow the recipe.

I made it, I loved it.  As to being dry or wet that's a preference like dill instead of sweet pickles.  When I make potato salad I reserve a cup of potato water like you do when you make pasta.  If its a bit dry for my tastes I drissle in a little of the water to loosen it up.  Even just a tablespoon can take okay to fabulous on the wet, dry front and not change the balance of the other ingredients or add calories.  Try it as it is.  A very good basic recipe.

Good salad, although the sweet pickle relish was a little strong for me.  Would try it again with less relish than called for in recipe.

I have made this recipe several times with slight variances along the way. I use 1.5 lbs of potatoes, 4-5 eggs and NOW only use 1/2 cup onion and 2 short stalks of celery, but add celery seed. The larger recommended quantities of celery and onion seemed to overpower the taste I was seeking. Even the chopping of the hard boiled eggs affected the flavor and texture of the final salad result. Typically, I use a near ultra-fine chop of the hard boiled eggs.... but it seems that a rougher chop is better. For mustard lovers, like myself, increasing the amount of mustard used can increase a more desirable taste. Nonetheless, this is MY go-to recipe for yummy potato salad. Mild experiments with quantities of ingredients and/or additional spices STILL make this a great mustard-based potato salad recipe..

This recipe is simple and really tasty.  I agree that it needs more mayonnaise; however my boyfriend isn't a huge mayo fan, so it was perfect for him.  (After I finished, I divided the batch in half, gave him the original, and added another 1/4 cup mayonnaise for everyone else, and that worked out well!) I also peeled & cubed the potatoes before cooking; great advice!

We were looking for a starchy, creamy side dish to go along with a spicy main-course, and this turned out to be perfect. I followed the recipe almost exactly (added trader joe's 21 seasoning salute instead of garlic/celery salt), and it came out pretty bland. I added some paprika and sriracha, which helped a lot. Ultimately there's not a lot you can do to make this dish the star of a meal, but as a complement to a flavorful meat course, this guy did its job well.

I'm giving a four, because some alterations are absolutely necessary.  I'll start off by first saying, that I am so glad that this recipe does not add sugar.  Refined sugar is not only disgusting, but unhealthy.  Follow Chef John's method in hard boiling eggs, why waste water?  Also, I like to keep some skin on the potatoes.  Radishes can be a nice colorful addition, IF you like them.  Always cool your potatoes (in the refrigerator)  then add the other ingredients.

No taste, add twice as much as it calls for spices, add vinegar, will find a different recipe  or make up my own.  Tastes like boiled potatoes.

This is awesome potato salad, I didn't have celery salt  but it came out just perfect! I diced my onion and celery stalk to a 1/4 inch thickness and that work out great.

Great recipe! I cooked my cut-up potatoes in my electric pressure cooker with the raw eggs on top to hard boil. In my model, this step only took 7 minutes. I added extra mayo and a little juice from some sweet pickles. I also sprinkled some paprika on top. The whole family loved it!!

Great basic recipe - we like more mustard, sweet gherkins (instead of relish) and bacon bits here, but overall good recipe for proportions.

A very good potatoe salad recipe.  The texture was good, as some of my earlier tries at this dish have resulted in sticky potato salad.  I added chopped pimentos for a bit of color.  Next time, I'll use dill relish instead of sweet, which is just a personal preference.

It was very good.  Did not have garlic salt, so put garlic powder and a little over quarter teaspoon of salt.  I added dill pickles with the relish and gave it a good flavor.  Also, did not put onions in.

We followed the recipe closely the first time and it was to "dry" for us. So we doubled the mayo and spices, then we added dill and a touch more mustard. After the adjustments we liked it. It only got better as the flavors soaked in. On the second batch we started with our adjustments and it was great. The recipe is a great starting recipe, you just need to adjust for your personal taste.

The potatoes came out hard and chewy after boiling for 15 minutesand I had to put them back in the pot after I already peeled them... They had to cook for another twenty minutes before they were ready! It tasted like nothing but celery.

My go-to carbohydrate to make for a summer party! I make mine without celery. Very yummy, and dairy free! I recommend chopping the onions thinly because they are pungent when raw.

I will definitely make this recipe again.  Followed it nearly to a T.  It's the closest I've found to my mother-in-laws which is fabulous.  For personal preference, the changes I made were only using 1/2 cup of celery, dill relish because we don't like sweet pickles, and I used twice as much mayo which was probably slightly too much.  My potatoes were large and I cooked for 20 minutes but they still could have used a little longer, but that is my inexperience not the recipes fault.  Loved it even though this first time around it wasn't perfect.  The flavors were still wonderful and thoroughly tasty.  Thanks for sharing!

great recipe that is exactly as it is named, a good old fashioned potato salad. I followed the recipe mostly as is, I did substitute chopped dill pickles for the sweet relish, as we are huge dill fans. I also added a bit of pickle juice with my pickles. excellent!

I change the sweet relish to dill relish and add a little more mayo so it is not dry.  I also add a little mustard.  I like a few more eggs in mine as well and I leave the garlic out.  Otherwise it is the same.  Everyone loves it!!!   I do use sweet relish at times and leave out the mustard,  just to switch up the taste.

I think the celery salt is unnecessary, and thought the taste of pickle relish overwhelmed the potatoes. I did not care for the garlic salt.

Big mistake to put eggs in cold water and bring to boil.  For easy peeling place eggs in boiling water (enough to cover) or steam basket (in 1 inch of water) and low simmer for 13 minutes.  Move to ice bath.  This method prevents the whites from congealing to the egg shell.  Otherwise good basic recipe.  I like more mayo, cucumber, and fresh radish.

Best potato salad I have ever made and I will be using this as my new recipe!
2 changes: I cut up sweet gherkins instead of relish; and I needed way more mayonnaise than 1/4 cup. I am guessing I needed 1-1/4 - 1-1/2 cups of mayo. Perhaps a lot depends on the size of your potatoes but mine were medium.

(The photo of this potato salad showed it as having something red in it when in fact, the recipe does not have anything red. I think this is a little flaw in the photos that I would like to see improved upon...it's confusing at times.)

This is a very good basic potato salad. I used green pepper because i didn't have celery on hand. It was really good if you have a potato salad craving.

I made it exactly as written and it was okay. My guests didn't take much and we a lot left over :(
I'm used to everything being devoured and wouldn't make it again.

We love this potato salad.  I make a few minor alterations though.  When the potatoes are still hot, I sprinkle them with vinegar (doesn't matter what kind).  I double the mayo in the recipe and use dill relish instead of sweet.  I double the celery salt and use garlic powder instead of garlic salt.  

The flavors remind me of what my mom would make when we were growing up.  Delicious!

This looks great, I haven't made it yet, but it's almost like the one I make but I use Dill Relish instead because my grandma always used dill pickles. I like to put garlic/salt in with the potatoes  while they boil. Mmmmm

I love this potato salad but agree with many others about using chopped dill pickle.  I mix the mayo with a couple table spoons of sour cream.  I some times add sliced radish and a couple of black olives, for color.

This is a very good recipe and has a good overall flavor but I lean more toward potato salads without the sweet relish - I had just wanted to give it a try.  If you like relish in your salad, this is actually a very good recipe.  Thank You

Needs more mayo. Should be 2 1/4 lbs of potatoes. Quartered potatoes first. Put a skewered garlic clove & 1 TBLSP of vinegar in salted water with unpeeled potatoes. Cooked potatoes for 12 min. Drained & crushed the boiled garlic clove to add to the mix. Also added 1/8 cup sour cream to mix & definitely use Dijon mustard.

Just like my mom taught me.  This is the potato salad I grew up with!  I wanted to try to remember everything she put in.  This is almost perfect.  I just added about twice as much mayo because I like mine creamy and used dill relish instead of sweet.  I usually would use chopped dill pickles and a little of the pickle juice, but i was out.  I used 6 russet potatoes and hard boiled the 3 eggs right in the same pot with the potatoes.  It worked great.  Yum!

My go-to potato salad recipe. The dressing ingredients are just right. I substitute a cup of diced bell pepper for the relish, and sometimes use a Dijon mustard. I find it better to peel and dice the potatoes then boil them until just tender, 10 to 15 minutes.

Great recipe and easy. I made little changes like mixing mayo with Miracle Whip as I do with all my salads. I also added a little hot sauce as someone else had suggested.  That was a nice addition.

My husband is all about this potato salad recipe. I made just a few little changes. Instead of Russet potatoes, I used red potatoes. I added more Mayo and garlic powder instead of garlic salt. I also added more eggs. My family loves eggs!! And of course cayenne pepper!! We love it!! It's definitely a requested item.

I used 8 potatoes, 5 eggs, and two types of powdered mustard, 1/2 tsp celery seed, double the garlic (powder), and both brown sweet and red onion, and 2 cups of finely chopped celery.  I also added 1/2 tsp of season salt, since I did not have garlid or celery salt.  The extra mustard made it pretty spicy.  The doubled amount of sweet relish & mayo carried a lot or liquid with it, which helped. It will be better tomorrow after the flavors steep in the fridge overnight.  I mixed everything non-potato or egg first to avoid mushing them up. Then I gently scooped the potatoes in with a spatula, and added the eggs last (cut in 8 or 10 pieces each).  It could have used even more celery seed and, or course, you can always add more pepper to taste when served.  It will be good with some coarsely chopped cilantro on top and showy with paprika sprinkled over.

I love this recipe. Although, I used it as a base line, and went a little overboard adding my own touch. My husband doesn't like potato salad, and he was bragging to our bible study group about it. I did change the mustard to spicy mustard, used 1/4 tsp garlic powder and 1 tsp of celery seed instead of the salted versions. Oh, and I added a 1/4 tsp of paprika, 1/2 cup of chopped baby carrots, and some fresh parsley. It turned out fabulous.

Made just a few changes but still a great hit! I don't care for celery that much so I added a little less. I used pickle juice instead of relish, and omit the eggs due to my son is a veggie.

I used this recipe with a few minor changes and it came out perfect!! I peeled/cut the potatoes before boiling them. I like a smoother potato salad so I boiled them for 20 min instead of 15. I used dill relish instead of sweet. I used a lot more mayo. I added a table spoon of sugar and a pinch of salt. I didn't use celery salt. I will definitely be making this again!

I gave this recipe 4 stars ONLY because my grandma would likely haunt me the rest of my life if I said it was as great as hers.
I made a larger batch than the recipe calls for so I had to double pretty much everything but the eggs.  I used just three eggs.  I did not add celery or onion due to personal preferences.  It was DELICIOUS!  Even though I made twice the amount, there were no leftovers.

This was a good starting point. I made this as written, and it was just to bland for me. I added some drained pimentos (for color), Dijon mustard and white wine vinegar.

This recipe is a keeper!  Made almost step by step. Had to use green onions due to being out of celery and regular onions...

I loved this recipe. The only thing I changed was more mustard and more mayonnaise, and I also didn't add pepper to it. 
My family love it as well... and for me only being 16 years old this was a fairly easy recipe. Make it every holiday!!

Although I did reduce the relish by a bit, it was a very nice touch. I made it to go with burgers and it was just such a lovely, classic taste of backyard barbecues!

I made this Sunday, and my family loved it! I didn't have any celery salt, so I used some Slap Ya Mama seasoning in place of it which gave it a lil kick. This was the first time I made potato salad. :)

This was a wonderful recipe.  It reminded me of the potato salad my aunt used to make when I was growing up.  I only made one change by doubling the amount of mayo used.  Other than that, I made it exactly by the recipe.  This was an easy recipe to make.  Thanks for sharing.

I made this adjusting qty to taste. At the end I thought it was missing something so I added some red wine vinegar and that fixed it. It is now chilling in the fridge and I can't wait to dig in.
Thank you for the recipe!!!

I made this and I love it. I did add extra mayo, and about 1/4 cup of plain yogurt, a splash of agave syrup and about 1/4 tsp of paprika. I put 1 egg onto the salad and sliced 2 eggs and layed them across the top, sprinkled with paprika. 
It's delicious.

Really good!  And please, what real cook doesn't adjust their recipes a little?  This one definitely has all the right stuff.  I didn't add anything -- just adjusted ingredients a little to suit our tastes.  It's a keeper!

I have been making potato salad like this for years, but I always use chopped dill pickles instead of sweet pickle relish.  I chop the celery finer and omit the celery salt and the garlic salt.  I use table salt to taste.  I'm rating it a five when using dill pickles instead of sweet relish.  My family loves it!

A delicious, basic potato salad that will be great for the Fourth of July (but I couldn't wait)! I halved the recipe and  added garlic and onion powders, parsley, celery seed (not salt) and hot sauce. I added a little seasoned salt (so didn't add regular or garlic salt) and also some chopped green olives. I subbed Dijon mustard for the yellow. The reviewers' suggestions are always helpful. I added the mayo to get the creaminess that I wanted. I'm sure this will better as it stands! Happy Fourth of July!

These are the exact ingredients I have used for 60 years that I learned from my Mama.  The only thing we both did not include was garlic salt (which I would have no problem using a pinch).  It's a classic.  I learned to like red potato German salad much later.

My friend suggested I try this for something different and the family was not thrilled with the change from "grandma's" recipe. It works much better if you mix the mustard and mayo together before adding the eggs and potatoes. I also skipped the relish and pepper, but did add some dill pickle juice.

This is almost the same recipe my mother taught me. A few changes: since no one here likes relish, I didn't use it. I add one medium cucumber, cut into small cubes, 4 or 5 radishes, diced and about 1 Tablespoon of fat-free ranch dressing. I also use a bit more mayo so the salad veggies are covered and not dry. It's delicious!

This is my main "Go To" recipe for potato salad... with one basic difference....  instead of sweet relish I use app. 1/4 cup of apple cider vinegar.   Also, I prefer celery seed over celery salt.
Whenever there is a pot luck with a number of different potato salads... inevitably mine disappears first. 
PS: A little sprinkle of paprika makes for a nice presentation.

I liked it, I used celery seed instead of salt, didn't have celery salt on hand, and a pinch of table salt. I took off a star, due to the fact that my eggs weren't done by boiling them on this method. I had to reboil them the normal way that I usually do. I also added a pinch of sugar, but that's my own personal preference.

Great recipe.  Of course I had to make changes.  I dropped the celery altogether, simply because my roommate and I do not care for it that much.

I also used russet potatoes; I don't think the recipe specified which type of potatoes to use.  I read that russets are higher in starch and so cook more quickly...so I kept an I on them and removed the smaller ones first.

Now for the big changes! I sauteed some onions and a chopped clove of garlic together until soft. I used more eggs than the recipe called for.  I also allowed all ingredients to cool before mixing together....I think this made a big difference as well. Also used Dill relish not sweet relish! 

Since I added garlic I also added a couple of tablespoons of parmesan cheese.  More mayo than mustard.  I just eyeballed the ingredients.  Seasoned with black pepper and Creole seasoning.

This was my first attempt at making a potato salad but it turned out nearly the best I've ever eaten!  

What a great, informative, simple potato salad recipe.  The recipe was easy to follow and it was simple to add or omit ingredients to taste.

Good job jewellkay!!!

This is a pretty standard recipe that can be altered so many ways that the rating doesn't matter if you changed it. I used chopped up Tony Packo's sweet hot pickles with some of the juice as the relish, added dill, celery salt and omitted onion. You cannot really screw up potato salad.

I cook potatoes in skins  and the eggs together.  This saves vitamins and minerals from the potato. When done, peel and cut into pieces. I added a little sugar, onion powder, lemon juice(a splash)to the rest of the ingredients and I use only Helmann's mayo.  I don't like pickle relish or mustard in potato salad so left it out. Also the garlic.

Not the zip it needs to have, my moms best potato salad had no relish in it and when mixed up the dressing for it add vinegar and sugar make it real tangy more mustard if you want, because when you add it to the potato and eggs it will be flat. So the tangier the better.

this recipe is good, but I'm not a fan of pickle relish in potato salad. So I left it out, added a little more may.

Pretty bland and flavor was lacking.  I did add extra mayo but if I ever attempt this again, I may add some bacon grease, use dijon mustard and cut the eggs down to two.

I prefer more mayonnaise, not sure about that much onion. I added a tablespoon of vinegar & 2 tablespoons of oil. Makes it much more moist. I have put sliced olives for my grandkids. I guess I prefer my moms the most.

I made this recipe today and it is pretty stellar! I put some green onion in there too, and used dill relish instead of sweet because that is my preference.... But really it was a great base to start from and then I was able to customize it how I wanted it! :)

I also made some minor changes to the recipe.  I halved the mayo and added sour cream to make up the difference.  Instead of garlic salt and sweet pickles I used minced garlic and dill pickles and also added green onions and an extra egg.

This recipe had very good flavor. The only thing I would change is how long I cooked the potatoes because with the given cooking time they ended up a little too firm for me. Other than that, here are a couple other small changes I made: Added about one 'stalk' of green onions, used less celery and yellow onion, had no garlic salt, used celery seed instead of celery salt, used g.p. Dijon mustard, and only two eggs. Oh yea, I also ran out of sweet relish so I literally only used a dash. It still ended up amazing and a little sweet just how I like it!

I don't know if I did something wrong, but I was pretty underwhelmed with this salad. I won't be making it again. There was no flavour! My husband said he "didn't hate it, but it was pretty bland".

My hubby doesn't like mustard in his potato salad but he says this is a keeper.  I didn't have pickle relish but did have some "end of the garden relish" so I added that and also about 3/4 cup peas. was pretty awesome!!!

This was excellent!  I did put in 1 cup of Lite Mayo, otherwise it would have been too dry.  I also put 4 eggs in, cuz I love eggs.  I did not put in relish either.

This was great!  I added a little more of the relish and mustard and cut back on the onion, but that is just my own personal preference.  Thanks for sharing the recipe!

I made this with a few little changes.  I too added a little more mayo/salad dressing mix.  I added more eggs, to personal taste.  Eliminated pickle relish (family doesn't like).  Next time I'll try the Dijon mustard, sounds goo.  Will definitely make again.

Hubs really enjoyed this, me just okay.  Seemed to be lacking a little something.  I left out the eggs- I know its sacreligious but I can't stand them =)  I added a little dill weed and some cajun seasoning, still lacked flavor and seemed to need more moisture too.  I'll keep tweeking and looking for a really terrific potato salad.

Needed more salt for sure and was pretty energy intensive. Prep time was way longer than 45 minutes and I didn't even peel the potato!

Awesome recipe.  Made a few changes. I used green onion instead of yellow. I also substituted white pepper for black pepper. I like my salad creamy so I added another 1/4 cup mayo and about 2 tbsp of sour cream. I also used granulated garlic, not garlic salt. I didn't want it over salty since there was celery salt.

This was an awesome pototo salad.  I did cut the down to 1/3 cup celery and added more salt and onion, and as others suggested more mayo. 
the recipe did not specify the size of the potato, so I just used 4 large russets. I will try it with dill relish next time to give this dish a less sweet taste, as suggested by a guest. I love it, but I was the only one raving about it.

Three years ago someone gave me a big plastic container of brand name potatoe salad which I found to be very good and probably the best I'd tasted. Unfortunately, I could never find it at grocery, but when I made this recipe, I found it again! Tastes exactly like it after some changes. 1/4 cup of mayo is a ridiculous amount, way too dry. I added about  1-1/2 cups. Also, I didn't add the sweet pickle relish just because I didn't have any on hand but will include it next time. I added about 2-3 TBSP of mustard instead of just 1 and I seasoned with plain salt and pepper to taste. I made this for Thanksgiving and it was great.

THIS IS THE BEST! This is my new potato salad recipe, it is the perfect equivalent of ingredients if you measure.  I added one more egg and some bacon because I had some left over from breakfast but it would be good without it.

Good traditional potato salad.  I really liked that it asked for less mayonaise than others.

I added bacon and peas to the salad but it doesn't need anything.  I also added more mayo to the dressing as it was a bit strong with the mustard and relish.  The first time I used regular mayo, second time 1/2 the sugar mayo while both were great we prefered the mayo with the added sugar so next time I will either add some sugar or not use the one with less sugar.

This is the way I make potato salad, didn't know there was a recipe.  My Mother made it and I always do.  I told my son-in-law that my potato salad was the best there is and I make mine like this recipe.  When making it for a family dinner, I always make enough for my daughter to take home and enough for me to have two times the next week.

Simply delicious! Modified the recipe by adding garlic powder & salt instead of garlic salt. Also substituted 1/2 of dill pickles for relish. A keeper~

I drained the sweet relish before adding the spices.  I added about a tablespoon of ground black pepper to the dressing.  I used a strong mustard [Hebrew National] and cut back a bit on the mayo.  I also added celery seed to this  -- an important ingredient in any potato salad for me.  Garnished with sliced eggs, celery seed and paprika.  The sweet of the relish contrasted well with the pepper.  It was very popular at the Memorial Day picnic.

I always need to cook the potatos a little longer.  (maybe the Maine spuds I am using have a little more starch...)  But otherwise, It tastes just like potato salad!

It was good. I added salt because I only had plain garlic and celery seasoning. I also added a little sugar.

This was really good. Everyone really liked it. I never like when people say how great the recipe was, and then tell how they changed it a bunch, but.. I used 1/4 tsp of garlic, and 1/4 tsp of salt. I did not use any pickle relish, as I don't like sweet pickle relish. Instead, I minced some dill pickles, and added some of the pickle juice. I also used a lot more mayonnaise than it called for, as there was not enough sauce. But maybe if you used the pickle relish called for, you wouldn't need to add the extra mayo. I also did not put in any celery salt. Mine was very good, and everybody commented on it. Will definitely make again.

Just deeelicious. I scraped the bowl after putting the salad into a container and licked the spoon clean. Must remember not to salt the potatoes so much because I'm adding garlic salt later on.

I served this at my sister's baby shower today and everyone really loved it.  I added a bit more mayo, as suggested and it came out just perfect.  This is the first potato salad I've made (I'm a newbie cook) and it was easy to make and turned out delicious!  Thanks for the great recipe!

I just made this and I love it. I couldn't keep my fingers out of it. It really reminds me of my mom's recipe - basic- but yummy. I have been trying to recreate it for the last 12 years since she died. Thanks a lot. Yumm Yumm!!

Decided to try this for the 4th...was a little nervous about making it for the first time with 30 people coming over but I had NOTHING to worry about.  I tripled the recipe, made it the night before, and it was gone within an hour!  I didn't change a thing, but may consider adding a little extra relish for kick!  Thanks for sharing.

I left out the sweet pickle relish and I used Miracle Whip instead of mayonnaise.  I have never used mustard or added garlic salt to my potato salad before and it was a nice addition. For me 1 cup of celery is too much - next time I will only use half the amount or may leave it out all together. Other than that it tasted really good and I will make it again.

Was a great hit at the 4th of July cookout. Used 5 lbs of red potatoes with skin and increased the ingredients by about 2.5 times. Used a little bit more mayo than suggested. Made it the night before and it was perfect the next day.

Great recipe - I added summer squash and zucchini for crunch because I didn't have celery on hand - and did just under an 1/8th cup of both mayo and ranch dressing to make up for the 1/4 of mayo the recipe called for.  I also skipped on the mustard - it was a hit!

OMG!!  This is the best potato salad I have ever made.  I used red potatoes.  I omitted the eggs and sweet pickle relish and the garlic salt and onions because some people do not like onions.  To cut down on the salt I used garlic powder and onion powder and added a little bit of tarragon.  What a fabulous taste.  My family now askes me to make this salad all the time.  This is the only potato salad they liked that I have ever made.   This one is a keeper.  YUM-OOOOO

Yummy!  I followed the recipe as is, except I added about 1/2 Tablespoon of sugar and used about 1/2 cup of mayo. ( I also used small red and white potatoes and didn't peel them.) This is an old fashioned Potato Salad for sure.  Thanks for the recipe.

I've seen my mother make it but I could never do it.  So I found this recipe and added my own flavor to it and it turned out great.  We like ours a litte sweet and I used red potatos with the skin still on it.  My family loved it.

This was average. The title is exactly correct - Old Fashioned Potato Salad. Traditional and tasty, but not new and exciting.

This was the first time I made Potato Salad (although, I have eaten my fair share!) I thought this was a great, easy recipe to follow.   If you have a preference of relish, sweet vs. dill, adjust the recipe accordingly.

A good start. Like others I at least doubled the amount of mayo, and used dry mustard. I also didn't use relish because I hate it. My grandmother used to add radishes sliced up into the salad. Try it, it's a great addition.  I also mixed the egg yolks into the mayo mix before mixing it all together.

Wow....I never cease to amaze myself:) I am a master chef now:) I just made this potatoe salad for the 1st time and holy cow you would've thought I have been cooking for years. I am so grateful for this recipe I followed it however I used 6 taters and 4 eggs, and I drained the sweet relish with my hand so not to have the salad to soggy. Wow I am totally impressed by this recipe and myself...so easy, quick, simple and delicious for 1st timers. Yummy! Rachel Ray watch out i'm coming through:) I Love The Kitchen!

This potato salad was great.  I scaled it for 10 servings. I didn't have relish on hand so I used 3 kosher dill spears and chopped them.  I also used 2 T of the pickle juice and did mayo to taste.  I will definitely use this recipe again!

I really needed the proportions for a great potato salad and this is it!!  It needed more mayo though -- guess it may have to do with how big those potatoes are!!

This recipe is very good and straightforward; however, Wanda didn't specify what kind of potatoes she used 5 of.  I used 3 long white potatoes cut into quarters lengthwise and ended up having to increase the spices and wet ingredients.  I tend to be inconsistent with my potato salads, and this recipe provides an excellent framework for making a consistently good potato salad.

I added dill and used course brown mustard instead of plain yellow; the dill & horseradish flavor makes this salad even better. I also was cooking chicken simultaneously, so I threw in some chicken broth into the pot the potatoes were boiling in.  If you're looking for a classic potato salad w/ great flavor (not too mayo-y, not too mustard-y), I'd say this is the recipe!  It's going in my permanent recipe notebook as my go-to potato salad recipe!

THIS IS THE BEST! This recipe is a keeper and will use this for potato salad from now on. I did change it up a bit. I doubled the recipe. I used about 10 red potatoes (cut them in half and cooked for about 25-30 minutes)6 eggs, 1 1/4 cups of celery, 1 cup onion, about 2 dill pickles (chopped up. Next time will prob use 3 or 4.) 1 1/2 cups of mayo, 1 heaping tablespoon miracle whip, 2 tablespoon mustard, and kept the seasonings the same. I can't wait to make it for the next bbq!

We had a bbq tonight and our guests loved this recipe.  I used three pounds of red potatoes, three boiled eggs, dill instead of sweet relish, and twice the amount of mayo.  The onion was a little strong and I'd definitely go with less mustard.  Pretty dang good!

I'd never made potato salad before and I thought this turned out well.  (Although, I think I should have cooked the potatoes a few minutes longer.)  I left out the celery and used dill relish.  I later added some extra garlic powder and mustard and this seemed to improve the flavor a little more.

Very good.  Be sure to use real mayo.  I started out with lower fat canola mayo and the flavor was just not there.  I had to run out at 11pm and by a small jar of real mayo to get the desired taste and creaminess as I was making it to go along with my ham for Easter. Potato Salad always tastes better the next day after the flavors have blended. I also added 2 more boiled eggs and extra mustard.  I used a mixture of red and idaho potatoes, just for the heck of it.

This is the same potato salad recipe that my family has always used. I do use a bit more mayo and sometimes I use green onions in place of the regular onions. Also, sometimes I leave out the relish depending on what kind of mood I'm in. Oh, and I always sprinkle the top of my potato salad with paprika. It is a delicious salad.

Great basic potato salad, with some adjustments it turns even better.  I omitted the eggs and the celery because I don't like them in a potato salad, and added steamed carrots. I also added fat free sour cream in addition to the light mayo because was too dry.

Pretty good but something seemed missing from what I had as a child. Maybe we always had more pickles and eggs in it? I will try another recipe next time.

Very bland & dry. I kept trying to add more relish or more mayo just to make it flavorful but nothing seemed to help. Did not like this recipe overall and won't use it again.

This wasn't my favorite potato salad. I think there was just too much relish and not enough mayo. I tried to doctor it up a bit by adding more mayo and other ingredients, but it just wasn't that yummy creamy potato salad I expected.

I added finely diced red bell pepper for color and used Smart Balance Mayonnaise. This was a delicious recipe and best the second day.

I think overall this recipe was quite nice, but my only issue with it is the time frame for cooking the potatoes. I did what the directions said, and once it was done, it was still undercook and "crunchy." I believe if I were to left the potatoes in the pot for around 17-18 minutes, then overall, it would have been a nice side dish to have.

Excellent! Just like mom used to make.  She always used Miracle Whip and did not use celery.

I doubled this for a cookout and it was definitely a large crowd pleasing potato salad.  Everyone has slightly different tastes and this seems to suit almost all of them.  I ran out of sweet relish and substituted diced pickles, but no one cared.  If you make this just for yourself, then you can personalize to suit your taste, but for a crowd, this one works.

This was delicious and easy to make.  I got rave reviews at a tailgate party!
On the advice of another reviewer I added some milk to the mayo and a couple tablespoons of sugar to take the bite out of the salad.  I searched all over for this recipe, when I think of potato salad, this is the one I picture.

Great flavors!  I left out the relish and onions for my kids. I did add more celery for that added crunch.  This will be a great side dish for summer grilling.

This was absolutely exceptional!  The garlic salt really  holds all of the flavors together.  I didn't however add any celery or celery salt and added more mayonnaise along with substituting the green onions with red as well as adding green and red peppers! This recipe is a keeper for me! Thanx.

Decent, but not the best I've ever had.  I would suggest letting the eggs sit 5-10 minutes longer because the yolks in eggs I made were just barely cooked enough.  I used chopped dill pickles instead of sweet pickle relish and added some dill.  Still, not the best I've had.
