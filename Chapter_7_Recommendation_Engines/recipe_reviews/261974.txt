This recipe is bad because it's not a recipe if I have to basically just buy it at the store. I would be better off just getting one premade. This was entirely useless and a waste of my time.

Made with Kinnikinnick Vanilla Wafers. This goes together quickly and easily (2 ingredients!). My crust turned out slightly soggy, but that may be the fault of the baker or the cookies.
