These are one of the best oatmeal chocolate chip cookies I've had.  I actually left out the cinnamon by accident and added extra chocolate chips.  Very soft/chewy in the center.  This recipe makes about 5 dozen cookies.

I love food, but I'm not the biggest fan of cookies.I bake them but don't neccessarily eat them. So, when my son asked for oatmeal cookies of course I went to  Allrecipes.com. to find a decent recipe. I found this recipe and boy are we, yes I said we, hooked.  I made the first batch and because they didn't last but a day, my son requested that we make some more the next day.  I was very busy so my 15 year son made them on his own.  Very good recipe - I did make a few changes. I always undercook our cookies because we like them soft and chewey. I also added 1/2 cup of shredded coconut and 1/2 of butterscotch chips.  Delicious!!

Great Cookies. You may want to add more chocolate chips. I added a full 300g bag which was probably more like 1 1/2 cups+. Most cookie recipes don't require the sheet to be greased and considering how buttery these cookies are, it really doesn't need to be. I find greasing the sheet makes them more crispy and brown on the bottom. Just gently lift cookies with a spatula after letting them sit on the sheet a few minutes. This makes tons of cookies. I even refrigerated half the recipe because I got sick of standing in the kitchen.

this recipe was really good but like other readers i did a few little nips and tucks.
i added 1/2 c coconut like a previous reader and i did NOT grease the pans which means i ended up with a nice puffy cookie.
i also chilled my dough and my pans.

Great recipe! I used regular white granulated sugar instead of the powdered stuff. The only other thing worth mentioning is that this recipe made 4 dozen, not 2 dozen, and they were 4 dozen JUMBO cookies. Great recipe though :)

Definitely one of the best cookie recipes I have tried.  These were soft and I loved the cinnamon.  I used only 2 c of oats instead of 3 and substituted butter Crisco instead of real butter.  These are so good and yes, they do make about 5 dozen cookies not 2 dozen.  And I did have these for breakfast, lunch, and dinner (but not all on the same day)!  :)

Wonderful recipe! I make oatmeal cookies often but this has to be my favorite! I almost reduced the butter but changed my mind at the last minute. So glad that I followed the recipe....the buttery flavor really made the cookie a standout! Thanks for sharing!

Anytime there's confectioner's sugar in a cookie - yum! 2 cups of butter - yum!  I just snuck in a little flaxseed, otherwise followed the recipe. Excellent! Made a 2nd time & did 1/2 whole wheat & 1/2 regular flour - still awesome!

First off I should tell you that I didn't have any brown sugar so I subsituted with all white.  I also added a whole cup of chocolate chips as well as 1 cup of chopped walnuts.  While blending in the flour at the end it appeared as though it was way too much so I only used about half of what the recipe called for.  Big mistake!  The cookies all ran together on the pan and I had to end up cooking them about 3 times as long.  In the end I had crispy thin cookies that actually tasted pretty darn good.  I had to cut them in squares, but nobody complained.  I wouldn't do it this way again though.  If I'd actually followed the recipe I'm sure they'd get a 5 star rating!

The flavor is great, very very buttery.  My problem with this recipe is that they were way too thin and crispy.  Even when I under baked them, they ended up flattening out while cooling on the rack.  Storing them was worse, all the cookies stuck together.

My review is based on the fact I forgot to add 2 cups of butter.  I only added 1 cup.  The cookies were fluffy and so good I didn't notice until after they were done.  They aren't as moist as they would with all the butter, but I'm okay with that.  They taste great!

These cookies are not bad but they are not great either. They have a very intense cinnamon flavor which I felt overpowered the oatmeal and chocolate. On the other hand, my sister felt that the cinnamon was the best part. The cookies did have a nice consistency though.

These cookies really stayed soft and that is what I have been looking for!  They were a bit more work but very delicious and everyone absolutely loved them.  I must admit when I took the first batch out of the oven I didn't think they looked like anything special, and while they were still warm I tried one and still thought they were just so so,,,,,,but the next morning I tried another one and that was when I was hooked!  They just TASTED so good!  Thanks Jessica!!  This is a definite keeper and I made them exactly as instructed.  (It did make a little more than 24)

They are seriously good. I went ahead and just used the whole bag of chocolate chips, otherwise followed directions, and like others said it is a huge recipe. I made around a dozen, then put some in a large Tupperware, but still had some left, so I ended up giving some dough to my mother and grandmother. The dough out of the fridge is hard and crumbly, but the cookies are crunchy on the outside and chewy inside. Just perfect!

This an excellent recipe.  I am constantly criticized by my spoiled children for not baking like other mothers do.  And then when I do bake, it's never good enough.  Well, to heck with them--little brats.  These were amazing cookies.  I guess you just need the recipe.  I made these exactly according to the recipe, and my two boys and their 2 friends ate more than 2 dozen in less than an hour.  So, they were pretty competitive, I'd say.  Seriously, though, they were delicious.  Thanks!

I made the cookies too big (actually my girls did) so they were very soft.  That was my fault, although they were delish! Nice recipe, Thanks!

I bake all the time and these did not come out to my liking. My family usually raves about my cookies. These were bland and just unappetizing. With two boys and a hungry hubby in the house we threw them out.

This recipe is great-with one exception!!!! It does not work without adding 1/2 cup of of water. The dough is thick and hard to stir but combines when rolled into balls. These cookies are really good for you and have a great taste!
