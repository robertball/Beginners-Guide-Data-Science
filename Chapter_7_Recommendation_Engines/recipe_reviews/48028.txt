This recipe is quick and easy.  I used a lowfat creamy basil dressing instead of ceasar.  I will definitely make it again.

this is a good recipe. my only suggestions are to let your pasta cool completely, then add to the bowl -- when i added mine,the pasta was still relatively warm and made a melted mess of the cheese. next time, i'll make the entire dish ahead of time and let it chill in the refrigerator for several hours -- that would have made the flavors come together much more.
