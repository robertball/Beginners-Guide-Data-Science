Pretty dang good! I took it to our local garden club meeting.  It was hit for sure! Anything with both a fruit and a vegetable has to be worth writing about!  Several bakers from the club mentioned that blueberries and lemon are especially good together too.  So next time, I will replace the vanilla with lemon and give it go.  This is a moist old fashiony cake. Well worth trying if you have any spare berries hanging around!

I have mixed reviews about this cake. I liked that it was old-fashioned and it tasted good but it kind of reminded me of blueberry pancakes without the syrup. It was very moist but was too wet in the center. I added more time than the recipe stated & it still was too dense. This recipe could benefit from some kind of light cream frosting or something served on the side. My husband would not try this. Once I told him there was a mashed potato in it he refused.

We found this to be an odd sort of cake.  It didn't taste bad, just a little strange.  The novelty of having a cake made with mashed potatoes probably was the highlight of the experience!

it was good, nothing special, however: you can do better with so many blueberries. I agree with another cook, it certainly coul do with a icing. Don't know if I'll do it again.
