Made this with an olive oil crust instead of a butter pie crust, and it complimented the filling quite well.

The filling itself, though delicious, was fairly homogeneous and the recipe made a lot for a 9 inch pie pan (ours made a little hill in the crust, and there was still more to spare!). If I made it again, I would cut the amount of sweet potato by a bit, and reserve some of the parmesan to put on top for a bit of browning and visual appeal.

Yum, I made this for the first time recently to take to a party. It was a big hit! So easy to make and no pre baking of the pastry shell required. The only alteration I made was a little more cold water to form the dough and the addition of parsley and chives to the filling. A great way to use up all our home grown sweet potatoes.
