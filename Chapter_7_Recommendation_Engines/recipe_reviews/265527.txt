Turned out beautifully! One major change is that my Instant Pot recommends cooking chicken breast on the high pressure cooker setting for 6-8 minutes.  So I only set the timer for 8 minutes but let the instant pot vent naturally (not quick vent) so the chicken was in the pot for a good 30-40 minutes total with building pressure, cooking, then venting & warming.  The chicken so so moist and delicious. I will definitely be making this again. (Also I had some chicken broth to use up so I used that instead of water...not sure it would have made a difference either way. Next time I will try with just water.)

I haven't made this yet, but I just wanted to add to the method.  I cook 16 to 18 breasts at once in my Instant Pot.  Afterwards, I use a hand mixer to shred the chicken.  Usually takes me about 3 minutes.  Major time and wrist saver!

This dish was okay, personally, I would give it  3 stars (hubs & 1 kid gave it  4 stars). It was lacking and missing something flavor wise, maybe the addition of a pickled slaw or fried onions would compliment this sandwich. The author of the recipe should specify which instant pot or pressure cooker they used as instructions would vary. I have a 6 quart Lux Mini Instant Pot which does not have a poultry setting so the instructions were not quite accurate for me. In such a case, omit the bottom rack, add 1/4 c water (or no water if using frozen chicken) add the chicken after sealing the lid select the manual setting on the instant pot and set the timer for 12-15 minutes. Perfect shreddable chicken. Then follow the recipe as instructed allowing the instant pot to manually realize pressure for 10-15 minutes and using almost all of the liquid created. Thank you for the recipe.

I used 4 lb. chicken, doubled the spices and manualy pressure cooked only 10 minutes.  Was perfect at that cooking time.

Wow, this was the best pulled chicken I've ever tasted.  I made 12 pounds of a mixture of chicken breasts and thighs for a Team christmas lunch of about 25 people.  The seasonings are just perfect.  I hesitated with the liquid smoke, so took a batch of it separate from the rest to test.  Very good.  I used Wright's Hickory flavored liquid smoke.   I plan to make this quite often just to have on hand.

Such great flavor. I added more spice than called for. Makes more than you think it will.

5 stars for taste, simplicity and easy to make. WARNING! DO NOT PRESSURE COOK FOR 50 MINUTES! Heck, when I saw that I knew it would be quicker in the oven! Thanks to a comment that said MANUAL (High Pressure) and 8 minutes in Instant Pot.

50 minutes is way longer than needed for shredded chicken. Manual 10 minutes is enough time to easily shred the chicken for this recipe.

I liked it and so Did my family. It was simple and we had the ingredients on hand. We are also going to freeze leftovers and bring them camping.

This was easy to make, but not well received by the family. We felt it lacked flavor and tasted about the same as just making chicken and then throwing a ton of bbq sauce over it. If you have about 2 bottles of bbq to put on it, it'll probably taste pretty good.

My husband loved this! He said it was the best chicken I ever made. 
I doubled the recipe to use the whole package of chicken. The only addition was 1/2 cup bbq sauce just because I was needed the liquid to help disperse the seasonings.
We ate it on dark rye bread with Sweet baby Ray's BBQ sauce and a pickle in the sandwich. 
Fabulous!

This is the first recipe I made using my Instant Pot. Mine doesn't have a poultry setting so I googled. Cooked on Manual 15 minutes. Came out pretty good. Chicken shredded really easily, I used a hand mixer to shred the chicken quickly. Used Stubbs Spicy Barbecue sauce
