It is good as a base, but it is not flavourful enough for my taste, so Instead of water, I used vegetable broth and added Marmite,  cooking sherry, lemon juice as well as Paprika and found that worked.

This was easy and turned out great. It does need more pepper in my opinion. The yeast gave it more of a cheese flavor to me rather than chicken but still really good. I am not Vegan but wanted to test this one out for when I am serving my Vegan friends. This one is a winner!
