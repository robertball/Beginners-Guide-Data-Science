I made these using raisin bran instead of muesli, and they turned out well. Very moist.

Delicious!!...I read the reviews and decided to cut out most of the oil and replace it with applesauce, leave out the water and because my muesli has a lot of fruit in it, I only used 1/2 cup of raisins. Because my mind goes straight to brown sugar when I think apples and cinnamon, I devided the sugar and used half brown and half white. They are lovely and moist, and will make these again.

I loved the taste and texture of these muffins. I did replace the water with a half cup of gingerbread tea since the only spice I had was cinnamon. I loved it so much with the tea, that the second time I made them I added Sugar Plum spice tea instead of the half cup of water.  

I had a generic granola/flake cereal. I added cranberries and rasins one time, and also loved that.  I did replace the white sugar with the brown, and sprinkled extra brown sugar on top before baking.  Thank you for the recipe.

nom, nom, nom. My two teenage boys can not get enough of these; I've been making them for more than a year now and they're still requesting them constantly. I pack them in their lunches instead of sandwiches sometimes. I have altered the recipe: I use 1 cup all purpose flour, 1/4 cup wheat flour and 3 Tablespoons ground flax seed and 1 Tablespoon wheat germ. The museli I use has nuts and dried fruit in it, but I still add more dried cherries or blueberries.  The boys know they're healthy for them and still they consume mass quantities. Thanks for posting this! It's a family favorite.

These muffins are fantastic!  My kids were begging for more.  I did modify it to fit our own family preferences.  I, after having noticed that my applesauce was 'expired', used 1 c. of ripe, mashed banana instead.  Wow, what a great texture.  I don't think I'll ever use the applesauce!  I used 2/3 c. turbinado sugar in place of the white sugar.  I lowered the amount of water to about 1/3 c., thinking the bananas were a little more runny than applesauce would be.  I did use all whole wheat flour and it worked wonderfully.  I chose Healthy Heart Blend cereal from Fiber One and it was great!  I also used fresh blueberries since I had just gone picking!  An absolutely wonderful muffin recipe I will use and share over and over again.  Thanks so much!!!!

Very very good. I made a few changes to the recipe. First of all instead of the 1/3 cup of oil I added an additional 1/3 cup of applesauce, and I didn't use the 1/2 cup of water because it would have made the batter to liquid. I used 1/2 tsp. of nutmeg because I didn't have any allspice at the moment. For the muesli I used my own homemade granola. My family loved them! The muffins were very moist and flavorful; 5 stars~thanks Kiki!

Very moist & delicious! I didn't add extra raisins because they were already in my Muesli.

I thought this recipe was very good (for being so healthy ;)
I made quite a few changes - I didn't have Muesli (the "name" of the recipe) so I used Fiber One Honey Cluster. I also used whole wheat flour, omitted the raisins, added 1 tsp. of vanilla and 3/4 C. chocolate chips - If I put chocolate chips in it...my kids will eat anything!  I will probably make thiese again.

This was surprisingly good. I subbed applebutter for the applesauce and water as I wanted strong flavor from the applebutter. I also only used about 1/6 cup of oil. For the muesli I used Sunbelt Cinnamon Raisen granola because it wasn't very good and wasn't going to get eaten as cereal. I baked this in 2 loaf pans for about 30 minutes and sprinkled a bit of granola on top of the loaves. They came out very moist and had tons of flavor to them. It is a bit crumbly because of the granola, but it's really, really good.

I tried this recipe a few different ways. In one version, I added 1/2 cup melted caramel squares and skipped the muesli and raisins. I also added 1/2 tsp of cloves. 
The second variation was the same as the first, except I used Splenda instead of regular sugar, and I left out the caramels. This made an EXCELLENT sugar-free apple cinnamon muffin. I will definitely make again.

So good.  I used more applesauce instead of oil, only half cup of sugar, used Kellogg's cereal and added raisins, and it was fabulous.  Great recipe!!!  Very yummy and moist.

These muffins were GREAT!  I used more applesauce than called for, and just a tiny bit of oil instead of the 1/3 cup.  They came out moist and yummy!  I'll definitely make these again!

I do believe these are the best muffins I've ever made.  I added an overripe banana, which was my inspiration for making muffins in the first place, and skipped the extra raisins because my Muelsi already had them.

My goal was to make this recipe as is, but based on what I had on hand, I ended up using this as a base recipe with several substitutions. I only had 1/2 cup applesauce, so I mashed up a banana and a small can of peaches and added them. My muesli already had raisins, so I added 1/2 cup of dried cranberries and 1/2 cup frozen mixed berries. I used brown sugar instead of white sugar and wheat flour instead of all purpose. 

The end result: delicious! I will be using this recipe again, with or without substitutions.

I substituted whole yogurt for the applesauce, used 1/2 c. whole wheat + 1 cup all purpose flour (instead of 1.5 c of all purpose).

Taste was just okay and muffins crumbled a lot.  Might have more taste if mashed bananas in to it.  Don't think I'm going to do this one again.

I had a box of cereal that I was never going to finish and spotted this recipe on the side.  I followed the recipe is almost exactly as written, except for boiling the raisins in water for five minutes to plump them up, and, adding a cup of walnuts and a teaspoon of vanilla.  The recipe was more than enough for 12 muffins, so I also made a teeny loaf of quick bread.  I would buy the cereal again just to make these muffins.

Amazing!  I have made these twice in the last 24 hours!  The first time I followed the recipe exactly, except that I added about 1/2 cup diced apple instead of raisins.  The Mueslix cereal I used already has raisins in it.  The second time around, I added apple, reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup, and swapped 1/2 cup of the flour for wheat.  They were fabulous both times!  I used a standard muffin pan and the recipe made 12 huge muffins with high and gorgeous tops.  They were perfect for breakfast and as a "thank you" gift for a neighbor.  I'll definitely be making these again soon!!

Love the texture of the crunchy cereal in this fantastic healthier muffin.  I did follow another suggestion of 3 tbls flax and 1 tbls of wheat germ to replace 1/4 cup of flour and will add dried fruits to the next batch just to kick up the healthy a bit more.  Thanks !!

Awesome!  I did make some changes though:  I substituted applesauce for half of the oil, used only 1/3 cup (brown) sugar (2/3 sounded like it would be too sweet), and all whole wheat flour.  I added only 1/2 cup raisins because my muesli had some.  I did use all the 1/2 cup water, and it was just fine.  Thanks for the recipe!

Very good muffin I usually double the recipe and freeze some. Muesli is not easy to find in the South so I mix; granola, raisin bran, and uncooked oats as a substitute.

I followed the recipe for the most part, but I used 1/3cup of maple syrup, 1/3 cup of raisins, 1 egg and 1 egg white ( for extra protein) and Tazo vanilla caramel tea instead of plain water....soooo freakin’ good! I got the tea idea from another commenter. I’m glad I did because it gave the muffins so much flavor and gave it an extra kick. I only used 1/3 cup of oil, but will try to add more applesauce next time because they weren’t as moist as I wanted them to be. I’ll definitely make them again and again as a healthy breakfast or snack. Thanks for the recipe!

Oven dinner tonight . . . Needed a dessert. Basically followed recipe with these little changes (per other reviewers suggestions): 1/3 c. coconut oil + 1/3 c. applesauce for oil, 1/3 c. organic sugar + 1/3 c. brown sugar, 1 c. white flour + 1/2 c. wheat flour, Kashi Go Lean Vanilla Clusters cereal, mixed raisins & cranberries, handful of chopped pecans. Great texture and delicious taste. Will make these again!

I didn't have applesauce, so I used a mashed ripe avocado and a mashed banana.  I ended up with 18 medium-sized muffins, which was fine with me.  Great muffins!

These are so fabulous. The flavor is amazing. It lingers and dances on the tongue. The texture turned out perfectly. The only changes I made, which I think have no effect on the results, was to substitute 1/2 cup of the flour with whole wheat flour and I didn't add raisins. I don't like raisins in baked goods. I am definitely making these again!

I was impressed with the final result, very moist, chewy and bursting with flavor! Being a health freak I subbed the oil for a jar of pureed carrots, and used Splenda instead of sugar. I added dried cranberries to my muesli and following the advice of a review above, I used a gingerbread teabag in the half cup of water to infuse more flavor. I will try again with light greek yogurt for added protein and more nuts for added crunch. Yum!

This has become my go-to muffin recipe when I want a quick, relatively healthy breakfast that goes nicely with coffee!  It is very versatile, as the meusli can be swapped out for granola, rolled oats, other grainy cereals, etc.  I also swap in whole wheat pastry flour and coconut oil.  These muffins are rapidly devoured every time I make a batch.

Healthy, almost guilt-free deliciosity - marvelous, satisfying flavor and texture. Few personal changes: substituted 1/3 cup applesauce for oil, flavored water with orange spice teabag, substitued 1/3 cup Splenda blend brown sugar for sugar, and used meusli with dates, almonds and raisins - would otherwise add dry fruit and nuts. With these changes, muffins baked in 20 minutes. Easy to forget removing baked muffins from pan immediately - otherwise will overbake. Easily takes the place of less desirable "treats."
