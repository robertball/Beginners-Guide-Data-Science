I have used this recipe for several years but I do it a little differently. I mix the cherrie pie  filling and crushed pineapples together then dump the dry cake mix on top and make sure it's evenly spread, but, I don't mix it with the fruit on the bottom - I just leave it on top. Then, I cut a stick-and-a-half of butter into small pats and arrange on the top of the cake and stick in the oven. This is sooo delicious - I can't stop eating it! Be sure to use butter instead of margarine, too, because it gives it a certain taste!

I first received a recipe like this for dump cake 3 years ago at my bridal shower.  I was skeptical at how easy it looked and wondered how it would taste.  It is absolutely unbelievable!!! By far one of my favorite desserts now.  The only things I do different is use a 20 oz. can of crushed pineapple (you really need that size, a 15 oz. would not spread over the 9x13 pan), lite cherry pie filling instead of regular (cuts down on the sugar a bit, but you won't even taste the difference), omit the nuts and use 3/4 (1 1/2 sticks) cup butter, sliced over the top.  Don't melt the butter in the microwave and pour over.....slice it in pats across the top of the cake mix and let the oven melt it. This allows for even browning.  I took this to a Christmas party last night and people were going back for seconds and thirds, and someone requested that I email the recipe first thing in the morning.  There you have it - cheap, easy, and delicious, what more do you need to try it?

Dump cake doesn't sound good, but it is! It took me like 5 minutes to put together, and it was so yummy! I let it sit for about 30 minutes before we tried it, and it was great. Reminded me of a fruit crisp. It's good cold, but I like it best warm with some vanilla ice cream.

Delish and easy to make! The only thing I do differently is freeze a stick of butter and then use a grater to make it shred evenly over the dish!! Works much easier even then cutting the butter and trying to lay it out evenly...

One of my favorite "in a rush" recipes for potlucks.  This is a really yummy cake that everyone raves about.  And, the best thing is how easy it is to make!

This is a great dessert BUT you do need to make some changes.  Mine is not sickly sweet as others have mentioned because I use pineapple in JUICE and I use Comstock NO SUGAR ADDED Cherry Pie Filling - that is the secret!  Also, use 2 sticks of melted butter and drizzle on top using a big spoon.  I have never had pieces of dry cake in the finished product.  Try these changes and I think you will see a HUGE difference!  It is the best served a bit warm with vanilla ice cream - well, that is what my 22 yr. old son says.

This recipe is my favorite along with my boss, which I make every year for his b-day. The amount of butter seems like too little when you pour it on, but it does come out right.

I just took the cake out of the oven.  Not impressed with the way it looks or tastes.  I now realize why(after reading the reviews)...I was not supposed to mix the cake mix and cherry/pineapple together.  After reading the reviews now, I hear many people stating that.  SOOO--I am giving this recipe only two stars since I do not think it was written correctly and now I am left with a cake thats not as good as its supposed to be.

Delicious!!!!!!!!!!! I used a 20 oz can of chunk pineapples (with juice). My concern about how mushy or dry it could be - I solved that by mixing half the cake mix and nuts in the pan with the fruits, and then putting the other half of the cake mix and nuts on top of it.  I now make it into 2 desserts by using a round glass pie plate and also a square 9x9 glass pan. It looks more presentable than a 9x13 pan. Also this way I can call it a "Pineapple Cherry Crisp" rather than Dump Cake! I will now make these ingredients a staple in my pantry!

My family loves this dessert.  I do it just a little different. I put the cherry pie filling down first, then top with crushed pineapple (drained).  Then top with cake mix.  Pour 1 cup of melted butter over top of cake and then cover with shredded coconut.

I have been making this recipe for years at camp using a dutch oven. It is so popular I wouldn't be able to get away without making it every year.

The ingredients are almost exactly the same:
1 (21 ounce) can cherry pie filling 
1 (15 ounce) can crushed pineapple 
1 (18.25 ounce) package French Vanilla cake mix 
1 stick butter 
NO nuts
Pour pie filling and pineapple into pan. Pour in cake mix and level it on the pan. Cut butter into pats and distribute over the top. Cover and cook with 25 hot charcoal briquettes: 12 on the bottom and 13 on the top. Bake for 45 minutes.
One fellow camper described the taste as "like angels are making whoopee in my mouth" except he uses less politically correct terminology.

I made this last night for the first time (to take on a camping trip we're leaving for. I didnt have enough time to find the materials I needed to build an oven for the fire, and didnt think those toss-away metal tart cups would withstand the hot coals) and was a little skeptical after putting it into the Toaster Oven.  How tart would it be?  How would the cake/crumb turn out?  I'll tell you...Not too shabby!!  We had to sneak a taste before we leave!  I added an additional can of Cherry pie filling (I used the lite version..and for some reason while I was at the store, I thought it called for 2 cans, not 1.  Glad I added the 2nd can though!!)  and mixed it together with the pineapple.  Topped with the cake mix and chopped hazelnuts (grabbed the wrong item at the store.  DOH!).  Used 1/2 a stick of butter (1/4 cup), unmelted and cut into chunks.  Since I was using Convection, I turned down the temp to 325.  Let it bake for 40 minutes.  Turned out wonderful!!  Topped with some ice cream, beautiful!  :)

I did not care for this recipe.  I served up three pieces and all three were uneaten along with the rest of the pan.  It was soggy and just sort of wierd tasting.  I followed the directions exactly. (I mean what could you possibly do wrong here???) I am wondering what the people that gave it 5 starts were even talking about?

The texture is weird if made as written.  It's like eating raw cake batter and I even cooked it 10 extra minutes to get it to "dry".  After reading all 167 reviews, I think I may do as one or two have mentioned which is NOT STIR THE CAKE MIX WITH FRUIT JUST UNTIL COMBINED.  I guess, I WON"T STIR THEM AT ALL.  Made per instructions, this was very soggy and extremely sweet.   I will try it again not mixing to see if it fixes the problem and use sugar free fruits.  I'm surprised that only one or two commented on this.  I hate to give bad reviews, sorry....

We love dump cake!  It is so simple and quick to make!!  Our version came from a dear friend of ours:  using 20 oz can of Peach Pie filling and 21 oz can of crushed Pineapple (don't drain).  Dump them in bottom of 9 X 13 and stir.  Then layer the cake mix on top, do not stir.  Use 1 1/2 stik melted butter to drizzle evenly over top of cake.  We don't like nuts so leave them out.  Fantastic!!  Try this, you will not be disappointed, our guests always love it!  **Warning, is really sweet with 1 1/2 stick of butter.

This has been a family favorite for us since I was a kid.  We don't put nuts in it - this is a "less is more" kind of dessert.  Just a can of cherry pie filling, a can of crushed pineapple, pour the dry yellow cake mix on top, then put pads of butter (a whole stick's worth) across the top.  Fantastic hot with ice cream, but even better cold for breakfast. ;)

This is the easiest and most versatile recipe out there. Been making it for years and the great thing is you really can't mess it up.  You can change the cake mix and pie filling to whatever you want, for instance I used spice cake mix with the apple (or peach) pie filling, lemon with blueberry and chocolate with cherry. It's whatever combination you like.  I didn't melt the butter, my original recipe called for pats of butter on top so I just cut the butter in pats and cover the top! it usually takes a little over 2 sticks of butter - so no real measuring or other pans involved.  It's always a hit at gatherings.  Yum yum :-)

I used white cake mix, which gives it a better flavor in my opinion. It was really good! I used lite cherry pie filling to cut down on the sugar some.

I am giving this 5 stars because I have never found a dump cake that I liked but I really LOVE this one.  I added a can of drained tart pie cherries to the cherry pie filling and used a 20 oz can of pineapple, I have also made it with a small can and I couldnt tell the difference.  I like to add about 2-3 tbsp. of lemon juice as well.  I mixed about 1/3c. or so of the cake mix in with the filling just to give it some body.  Then poured the rest of the cake mix on top.  I just patted the butter on top but I did use a stick and a half instead of just one.  I am making this again tonight, yum!! I think I might sprinkle just a little bit of cinnamon on the top right about 10 min. before its done.

This cake is very easy, super quick, but just OK. Nothing wonderful or spectacular. I couldn't say this is a good cake recipe for when I don't have eggs because I don't normally have pie filling on hand.  I stirred the butter and pineapple juice into the cake batter and spread it on top to avoid the dry spots others complained about. The cake is a bit crumbly.

I learned this recipe from my MIL. As many other reviews state, we mix the pineapple and cherry pie filling together, then sprinkle the cake mix on top of that and place slices of cold butter across the entire thing. This makes the topping so rich and so good!  We also like to serve this with ice cream. Easy dessert + fairly cheap + loved by all = successful recipe!

This recipe is incorrect as written.  I followed the directions exactly and it came out terribly- soft, mushy, awful.  I believe that you should not stir the ingredients until combined with the cake mix- do not stir the cake mix in at all in my opinion or you will have a mess.  I made this for company and it was a big embarrassment.  A real dissapointment.

I tried this one, but I add Ginger ale instead of butter. Comes out great. I use Ginger ale with all my Dump cakes. 1 12 oz can pour it over after adding everything do not mix, just bake.

This was good! I followed the recipe exactly, but the next time I make it I will probably make a couple of changes. I felt like it could've used more fruit, so I would probably add half a can of pie filling and half a can of pineapple. As for the butter & cake mix, I think next time I will cut the butter into the cake mix with a pastry cutter. Great recipe for a quick dessert!

This was semi okay. The butter didn't cover the entire top so there were large spots of powdered cake mix all over. I think using more butter would solve that problem but I won't make it again to find out. It wasn't too sweet for me and the pineapple cherry combo works well. It's really just the cake topping and the butter on top that I didn't care for. I love cake but evidently not dump cake. It's edible and I will eat it so it won't go to waste. My husband refused to even try it since the powdered cake mix didn't look appetizing.

Super good and extremely easy! I layered the cherry filling, pineapple, cake mix, butter pats and walnuts (did not mix them). I added more butter pats to cover more of the cake.

Very good and is definitely a fruit crisp, not cake.  Cherry pie filling is way too sweet, especially with the very sweet cake crust on top.  The 2nd time, I used canned Oregon Fruit Company Tart Cherries (in water) and it was much better and took away from the 'canned' taste of the dessert.  If using canned cherries, make sure to drain the water or else it will be too much liquid.  Can also bake in a 8 x 11 dish, just increase the baking time by 10 min. for the cake crust to cook through.  Very easy to make and great with ice-cream.  Serve warm for best taste.  Remember, use tart canned cherries!

MAKE SURE YOU USE UNSALTED BUTTER!! I made the mistake of using salted butter and it messed up the whole cake. The liquids were retained and the cake turned out a gooey mushy mess! I look forward to trying again.

I found 
it is necessary to stir the cake mix in with the fruit. The pineapple should have been drained. This looks funny.

Other recipes call for dumping the filling, stirring, dumping (sprinkling) cake.mix..NO STIRRING!  Pats of butter on top.

I won't make this again

I added extra cherries, almond extract, cinnamon and used peaches (since that is what I had)  in place of pineapple.  The pan I used was an airbake pan, so baking time was 55 minutes.  Very quick, easy and good! Thanks for sharing!

We love dump cake.  We first discovered this as something that can be done over a fire in a Dutch oven whilst camping.  Only changes I make are using canned tart cherries instead of pie filling (balances the sweetness) and serve it warm in a bowl with a bit of cold cream poured over (ice cream doesn't like camping!)

I lost my old recipe so I searched and found this. The ingredients are the same. The only change is I mix the fruits together, sprinkle the cake mix, then nuts, on top of the fruit, and then drizzle melted butter over cake mix/nuts.  It is delicious and everyone loves it.

This cake was so esy to make and so yummy .  I did mix the pineapple and cherry pie filling together, then spread on the bottom of the pan.  Then added dry cake mix on top, without mixing into fruit. Walnuts on top of cake mix then one and a half sticks of butter, cut into this pats all over the top.  Makes your mouth water.  Thanks for  sharing your recepie.   Kimmilu

i live in a house with 5 other college kids and we all loved this recipe.  the cake was gone the same night i made it.  i also thought of a great idea to make it low fat, substitute the butter for butter spray, and the walnuts for prezels pieces.

This is an easy recipe, and I followed the entire thing, omitting the walnuts.  However, it seemed like it took almost an hour or more to bake.  I've seen it made before, and the topping was nice and crusty. Mine didnt turn out crusty, and it seemed like the top was still dry where the butter wasn't covered.  It was still delicious, but next time I think i'll put less cake mix on, or use butter pads instead of melting it.

Like others said this recipe is calculated wrong. Based on what I read in other reviews I did the following:
1: 2 regular cans of cherry pie filling.
2: I did not have crushed pineapple so I used 1 large can of pineapple chunks (drained) and pulsed it in my food processor till I got it into small bits.
3: 1/2 cup of butter cut into small thin pats on top.
I went ahead and mixed the cake mix in with the cherries and the pineapple.  I baked it for 40 min but felt it needed more time. I took it out of the oven and placed a half a stick of butter pats on top and broiled for 6 minutes (be sure to watch it so it does not burn). This gave it a nice dark crust on top.
I found that broiling the final butter adds a sweet salty flavor that brings out this great dessert.  I gave it 4 stars because the recipe was off but the concept gets 5 stars, Thanks for sharing!!!

I enjoyed this cake and I found it to be every rich. Some advise I would give is to put the butter in cubes on the top to melt in the oven no more then 1/2c. Also, leaving this cake in the pan to set awhile before you serve it (especially if you mix the fruit and cake) would make it easier to serve.

This reminds me of pineapple upside down cake. I think next time I may add coconut, however this was really good and lasted about 2 hours in my house, before the whole pan was gone.

A very good combination of cherry and pineapple. Be sure to add the pineapple juice. Try not to use the "heavy syrup" pineapples. It'll make it less sweet. I used a cheese shredder to cut up the butter and was able to spread it out evenly.

Delicious and easy, easy, easy.  Although I don't think the recipe makes this clear, you don't drain the pineapples.  I kind of wondered about that and then talked to a friend who had made it.  Yum!

I have been looking for this recipe for ages. My mother-in-law made this same dessert and when she passed away, I couldn't find it. It is an amazing dessert. I only gave it 4 stars because you should NOT mix the wet ingredients with the cake mix. You just mix the fruit and then top with cake mix and butter. Using pats of butter rather than melted is better as well. Love this!!

This is a wonderful dessert and I have made it for years. You can change the fruits to suit your taste and it will still turn out as good. Easy too!

This is so quick and easy and tasty! I was looking for a recipe for dump cake that my aunt made years ago - it was the best. This recipe was really close and excellent. I made a few changes (as per what I remembered of my aunt's recipe). I used pecans instead of walnuts and also put the butter in sliced pats on tope of the cake before baking. My aunt also sometimes added two cans of pie filling - sometimes blueberry and cherry side by side. All in all, a great recipe - I highly recommend it.

This recipe also works well in the crock pot! The last time I had a party at my house I put this is the crock pot and kept it on a low setting. My guest loved it! You can also vary the fruits, I once used pears instead of pineapple, and you can vary the nuts too. Try a sprinkling of instant apple cinnamon oatmeal on top! But this recipe as written is very good and very easy. Thanks for sharing!

This is one of my Favorite Recipes as you can see, I posted the photo of my Dump Cake. My neighbor could have sworn I made mine with cherries however, I used Strawberry Pie Filling and it was gobbled up and gone with in the hour of making it! You will NOT be disappointed in this recipe!

Just made this and it was a hit in my family.  So easy and really tasty.  I used pecans and put the nuts and coconut on on top of the pinapple.  It came out great.  I served it warm with vanilla ice cream so it didn't seem too sweet although I may try the light cherry pie filling next time just too see the difference.
I used a yellow butter cake mix, that's all I had.  Will definitely make again.  Thanks for the great recipe.

So many compliments always. With or without walnuts. The crunchy top always baffles people when I tell them its yellow cake mix/butter. Adding a scoop of vanilla ice cream or whip cream is a must.

I made just like it says and it turned out perfect. I made this when we had company and they just kept saying how great a cook I was. LOL It was so easy!! I will let my teen make it next time to get the credit and learn. Turns out semi like a cobbler, but I just love the fruity yet cake like taste. Easy but good. I recommend given it a try. I mean with 5 ingredients, it can't hurt to try :)

When something is 4.5 stars I expect it to be off the charts good. This was good not great. 1) I have a new convection oven which generally cooks faster but not all the cake mix was cooked after 50 min. 2) the recipe called for the butter to be melted another review said not to melt that you should use several pats. I did the pats, big mistake it doesn't spread evenly over the topping. 3) it REALLY needs 2 cans of cherries because there is to little filling and there's too much topping 4) this recipe called for a can of pineapples, but didn't say if it should be drained, I found another similar recipe that said drain the pineapple so I did and it's a good thing. When you take into consideration how easy this is, it's great, but if I want omg results this won't do it

This is a wonderful, easy cake! Its a big hit everytime I make it. The only things I do differently is I use fresh pineapple. Ever since I had my first fresh, I refuse to use canned. Makes a huge difference! So if you have the time and patience to cut a pineapple, go for it! I don't mix the fruit together or cake mix with the fruit. If you mix everything, its no longer called "DUMP"! lol

made this for my husband to take to work (we had to check Wikipedia to find some random thing to celebrate with Dump Cake, lol!). within 15 minutes of my hubby getting to work, i had an e-mail complementing the cake. lol! i think it took more effort to send off the e-mail than it did for me to make the cake.  only adjustment.....pecans instead of walnuts. true GRITS here.   oh, cake was destroyed. i didn't even get to taste it! well, i guess that's a great complement. ^_^

This is sooooooo easy & so good!  I've taken it to a couple parties/potlucks, and have received a lot of compliments!  I followed the recipe exactly.  I have had others that add coconut, but I am not a fan so I didn't include it.  Will definitely make it again.

Made this dump cake and it was amazing.  Loved the top and the cherries.  For a 13x9 pan i will use two 21oz cans of cherries as i love the filling!   Reminded me of camping when I was  young boy making cherry crisp in a solar oven cooker! Will deficiently make it again!

We've made this often, but usually with crushed pineapple and applesauce.  DON'T stir it, just layer it in the pan in the the following order cherry pie filling, pineapple, cake mix, nuts and butter and bake.  It comes out great and not mushy like some people have complained about.

Made this for a quick dessert after I realized that the dessert I made the other day had vanished and company was coming in 1 hour. Very easy to make. Tasted like I had spent way more than 5 minutes prepping it to cook. I did thinly shave the butter to cover the cake rather than melting it. A word of caution, this is a very rich dessert. Serve small portions. Did not need any ice cream/whipped cream as it was so rich/sweet already. I will probably make this again for a dessert in a pinch but it really was too rich for my tastes.

I can't believe how good this is and it is so easy. Paula Deen has this same recipe but you use blueberry pie filling instead of cherry. next, time I think Im going to try that to. I guess, the possiblities are endless. This will be a regular at our house especially on Sundays.

This is a quick, easy and sweet dessert.  I left off the walnuts simply because we didn't have them. This recipe is much better than dump cake IV from this site(the other one just has too much butter).

I've been a fan of Dump Cake for years.  I got the recipe from my grandmother when I inherited her recipe collection.  I recommend using either a 9x13 inch pan or an 8-9 inch square pan.  I think the sqaure pan works best as it makes the cake thicker.  

This is also good with coconut added in.  It's great served warm or at room temperature.

This recipe is so easy, I can't believe it tastes this good.  Unlike other reviewers, mine didn't come out too sweet. I used one can of pineapple chunks and one can of sliced mango. I think pie filling has too much sugar in it and that's what makes the cake very sweet. Use canned fruit without added sugar for a less sweet cake. Also, I  found that freezing the butter made it easier to slice it very thin. Finally, in order to avoid dry patches of cake mix from gaps between butter slices, I took the cake out of the oven after ten minutes and swirled the very top of the cake with a fork so that the now melted butter was more evenly ditributed throughout top of the cake.  The result was yummy!

This was a hit!  My husband said it looked funny, but tasted great.  I placed the cherries first, then the pineapple then the cake mix and finally the margarine.  I used a white cake mix and it was great!  Will make it again.

This is one of my favorite recipes. I make it alot and my kids love it. The only thing i suggest is layer everything a little at a time and top it with the remaining cake mix, butter, and chopped walnuts. After it bakes it gives it a whole different flavor because the walnuts kind of roast on top.

This recipe is one of our standards for potlucks, company, etc. We have used it for years and people never seem to get tired of it. The pineapple combined with the cherry pie filling really makes it. Serve this in small portions as it is sweet. Wish it had a bit more elegant name, but a rose by any other name...

After a miss because someone who gave me the recipe neglected to mention the butter...sigh...I found this one!  I melted the butter and drizzled it on top, and it turned out perfectly!  As others have mentioned, it's more cobbler than cake consistency, but everyone raved, and the vanilla ice cream is a must!  I'm looking forward to making it again!

My mom used to make this cake with cherries only, I remember it was one of the first desserts she let me take over making when I was little. I decided to look it up because I was reminiscing with my sister about it. It's very sweet with cherries alone, but I think pineapple would make it even sweeter, so I skipped the pineapple (plus i don't care for pineapple in things). A quick and easy dessert, but not something I'd make often, due to the high sugar content. But definitely a yummy treat!

My guests ate it and liked it. I was very disappointed with this recipe. It was my first time making a dump cake so I didn't realize you actually don't need to stir up the fruit with the cake mix the way this recipe instructs you to(as well as the accompanying video). A friend previously made a dump cake with these same ingredients but their recipe had better directions and it was so delicious! For the best dump cake you should not stir the cake mix in with the fruit. Also, it needs to cook at least 50 minutes not 35. Instead of melting the butter, drop bits of it all over the top before putting it in the oven. I recommend cherry pineapple cabana dump cake on AllRecipes.com. This recipe correctly instructs you to dump the cake mix and smooth the top NOT STIR IT IN!

We used white cake mix and chose not to use walnuts. Served it warm with French Vanilla Ice Cream and it was enjoyed by everyone. A bit sweet for me but other 4 family members said they liked the fruity flavor mixed with the cold ice cream and warm cake.

I make a variation of this...we use different kinds of pie filling I like it with pineapple and blueberry.  But my favorite is Blueberry and Apple Pie filling and no pineapple butter recipe cake from Duncan Hines.
It is to total indulgence no matter what...around here we like to serve it as an ice cream topping straight out of the oven!!!!!

Maybe I over mixed the cake mix with the fruit although it did look like what the video showed, but I think something went wrong. I definitely would NOT call this a cake.  No way could this be cut to put on a plate, more like "eat it with a spoon out of a bowl".  The flavor was good, but didn't care for the consistency, and it looked nothing like the finished product in the video. Disappointed and won't do a repeat.

I'm not a fan of cherries so I use a can of blackberry pie filling instead. It's even better! My family and I absolutely love our custom version and I have experimented with blueberry and strawberry pie filling as well. I also use 1 cup of butter on the top. Totally worth the added fat. This recipe is always a hit!

This is the best and easiest recipe ever! It is always a hit at potlucks and always completely gone. I add one can of drained pitted tart cherries to the pie filling to cut the sweetness a little. I put the dry cake mix on top, then top with chopped pecans. I put pats of butter on top instead of melted butter. Delicious!!

I discovered this recipe here and it is so easy and delicious. I changed the fruit from pineapple to fruit cocktail and cherries then followed the given instructions for this recipe. It was delicious. It can be eaten with ice cream or whipped cream. I give it 5 stars for ease and taste.

This recipe is great! You can use any fruit filling you desire. I especially love using Pumpkin Pie filling during the Holidays. Just omit the pineapple. Fabulous and Quick!

I made this recipe many times and it is delicious and very easy to make. I made it as is, and I experimented with a few changes. Now I use "lite" pie filling so is not too sweet, 1 cup or 1 stick of butter, and I use pecans instead of walnuts. I also have tried lite apple pie filling with fruit cocktail, and it almost tastes like apple pie. It is great!!

This is soooo good!  I didn't have walnuts so I had to leave them out this time but it didn't affect the taste at all.  I will try with nuts next time and see if it makes any difference.  I followed the advice of others and used pats of butter on top instead of melting it.  Delicious!

This was incredible!  I do the order a little differently.  I pour the cake mix into a lightly buttered 13 x 9.  Then I drain half of the liquid from a 20 oz can of crushed pineapple and pour the rest in over the cake mix.  Then, I add the can of cherry pie filling.  Lastly, the 1/2 stick of melted butter.

I made this cake for my husband's birthday tonight and he loved it. It was big hit with my kids as well. I followed everyone's advice and did not mix the cake mix with the fruit. I also put 1 1/2 sticks worth of butter pats on top like many people suggested. I'll probably make it without the walnuts next time but that's the only thing I would change. Thanks for the great (and simple) recipe!

I didn't have cherry filling, so used peach instead.  Still a great combo with the pineapple.  I didn't blend in the cake mix, just topped the fruit mixture with it and covered it with pats of butter (about 1 stick for a 9x9 pan).  Baked for 50 min, as it was still soggy at 35 min.  Came out great with a crusty top, but a little on the sweet side.  Didn't have walnuts, but I think it would have been delicious.    I might use fresh blueberries with the crushed pineapple next time.  Would be just as easy to make, but with fresh fruit and less sugar!

A friend made this for my birthday and I loved it!! It's very easy to put together but after 40 min. the cake was not baked through...in fact it was runny, I had to bake it an extra 25 minutes!! Not sure what happened. I live about 4000 ft above sea level but so does my friend. after all that it was still good...but the baking time I think is off.

I, too, have made this for years.  Sometimes I leave the pineapple out, and just do a can of pie filling, sometimes I add a little bit of pineapple.  I use an 8x8 square pan, and small box (9 oz) of the yellow cake mix.  (There is only 2 of us, and it lasts for days.) I use a little less than one stick of butter, and grate it into the cake mix, tossing them together.  I usually throw a small handful of brown sugar in with the cake mix and butter.  Then just sprinkle it all over the top, DON'T mix it with the fruit.  Yum!

This was the first cake I ever made!  Been making this for years.  I dump my cherries, then my pineapple, use a butter knife and swirl it lightly together, sprinkle the mix on top and pat with butter.  Warm or cold, always delicious!

This is the easiest and richest dessert to come out of an oven. We used to do this over the coals in the dutch oven too when camping. Very very rich, very sweet, a small portion goes a long way. I served this with a scoop of vanilla bean ice cream. The best part is this is served warm so not much waiting involved.

This cake is AWESOME!!  I admit I had my doubts at first.  I used a 20oz can of crushed pineapple and lite cherry pie filling.  I don't like nuts so I didn't add them.  I didn't melt the butter either--I thinly sliced 1 1/2 sticks of butter over the top.  I had to bake the cake a little longer for about 50 minutes, probably because I added the extra pineapple.  My husband and his friend LOVED it!! His friend even asked me for the recipe so he can make it too!  THANK YOU!  This will be a good "go to" recipe!!

I let my 9 year old daughter make this.  It was so easy for her to do.  We melted 1/2 stick of butter in pan first then dumped cherry pie filling then pineapple then sprinkled yellow cake mix on top.  Then she very thinnly sliced 1 stick of butter and covered top of dry cake mix, then sprinkled pecan chips on top.........it was out of this world my 7 yr. old loved it as well!

Sorry, I thought this cake was just okay. It was good, but not great and definitely not anything special.

I searched for this recipe to duplicate the delicious dessert that was served to  our mission team by our host Church in New Orleans.  This is as close as I could find, and we loved it!  I think I mixed it a little more than I should have, and I will do better next time.  But THANKS for the recipe!!

I changed this a bit and it turned out much better than the original recipe which I tried the first time.  I added 1 can of sour cherries to the fruit mixture.  I only used 2/3 of the cake mix on top and increased the butter to 3/4 C. (1 1/2 sticks.  Finally I sprinkled 1/2 of chopped pecans on top and added shredded coconut to the top when there were 20 minutes left of baking time.  YUMMY!

Turned out very well. I was worried about the sweetness from the comments of others... but it was great. I also mixed the cherries with the pineapple, then just spread the cake mix on top. I used one stick of butter, in thin slices, all over the top. The juice from the pineapple and the butter on top gave it the perfect amount of moisture to bake the crust well. I will make this again for any function!!

I just had this for dessert at Thanksgiving. When my step-grandma told me the ingredients, I was skeptical. But when I tasted it, I devoured it and didn't even bother finishing my piece of pumpkin pie! She used pecans instead of walnuts. All the ingredients go so well together, you really do have to try it to understand. However, it IS deathly sweet as others have mentioned.

This was easy and good.  The pan, however, needs to be buttered.  I found it a bit too sweet - maybe next time I will use tart cherries instead of cherry pie filling.  Also, I will double or even triple the amount of nuts (I used pecans instead of walnuts) - they made the cake!

This was an excellent recipe!  I didn't have crushed pineapple, so I used chunk and drained all but a cup of the juice, and it still game out great.  My fiance ate half the pan within a 1/2 hour!  Thanks!

Great recipe!  I substituted white cake mix and pecans for the yellow cake mix and walnuts.  Instead of melting the butter, I just sliced it and placed the pats of butter on top of the nuts.  It was delicious!

I'm not a fan of cherries, so I substituted canned blackberry pie filling and it turned out great!  Also, I didn't measure out butter, just cut up one stick and placed pieces on top.  I'm just learning how to cook and this is SUPER easy, and tastes great!

I used a can of pineapple chunks that I had instead of the crushed. I also used an 11 by 7 pan but It turned out great. Next time I would just use two cans of cherry instead of using the pineapple.

I used apples that I canned about a month ago and it went well with the crushed pineapple (I'll probably try cherries next time).
Key learning is you really have to make sure butter is poured over as much of the dry cake flour as possible so the batter is baked sufficiently.

Beware mixing the cake mix up with the fruit.  The cake came out like a bread pudding.  I'm going back to just  pouring the cake mix over the fruit, and the pecans need to be reduced to one cup.

2 cans cherry pie filling (21 oz each)
Then dumped dry cake mix over the top, I did not blend in with the fruit.
3/4 cup chopped pecans over the top of cake mix.  
1 cup of butter, melted and poured over using a spoon to keep the level of butter “even” 
Baked for 45 minutes at 350 in a 12 inch cast iron skillet. 
Perfect

This was so delicious!!  I did not have the cherry pie filling, so used blueberry in place of it.  So easy, and it is really good after being refrigerated over night when it is leftover.  Will make it again.  I used 1/2 cup of chopped pecans spread over the cake mix.

Followed the instructions but cake came out gooey and mushy. Had the texture of half cooked cake.  Next time I will not stir the cake mix into the fruit as instructed. Mine looks nothing like the video shows. 

I did use low sugar dark cherry pie filling and pineapple packed in pineapple juice so it was not overly sweet as some said. 

Wish I had read the reviews before I tried this. Wasted the fruit and cake mix.

I used a lemon cake mix and also put pat's of butter on top as others suggested. The lemon cake cuts a lot of the sweetness. Love the sweet/tart flavors! I added some coconut and walnuts  too. I will make it again, definitely! Thanks!

More of a crumble, less like a cake.  However, it did make my sweet tooth happy.  And melting the butter works really well, rather than cutting it in small slices

The finished product was only okay. Seems the key to the recipe is the mixing of the cake mix with the fruit. I think I mixed them too much. Perhaps the recipe could be modified to reserve on half or one third of the cake mix to sprinkle over the fruit and partial cake mix. Additionally, the amount of nuts is excessive; I think it should be cut in half. I probably will not make it again.

I needed a treat for my Husband’s return from a trip, but was limited to what I had on hand, which was a jar of Trader Joe’s sweetened cherries, (no pineapple), so volume was about half the original recipe.  Only needed half the yellow cake mix, half the sugar and half the nuts (I used almonds, about 1 T cornstarch, 1 T lemon juice and some zest, 1/4 tsp each of almond and vanilla flavorings).  I put a handful of the almonds, toasted, in with the filling mix and the rest with the topping.  Bake at 350 in a smaller Pyrex dish, about 6X8” for 20-25 minutes until lightly browned.

Lots of small changes because of supplies on hand, but that’s the beauty of this dish!

I made this but changed a couple of things. I didn’t have cherries so used some homemade rhubarb strawberry blueberry sauce. I didn’t stir cake mix in, and I used a lot of butter. Served it warm with whipped cream and it was a huge hit.

It was delicious !  I doubled the recipe for a "hotel size" pan.  When I make it again I will pour cake mix in bowl and mix melted butter so cake will brown evenly.

I did as other reviewers posted and mixed strawberry pie filling (all I had) and pineapple together. Poured on the bottom of the dish and sprinkled the cake over. I had a huge 2 lb slab of butter so eyeballed putting slices on top and baked. It was amazing. The only thing I noticed is there are a few areas  that have raw cake mix along the edges. Not many, but a couple where the butter didn't melt onto it. This is a keeper!

I made this years ago & didn't mix the cake mix in. It was weird & dry. Now I follow the directions to mix it with the fruit & use 20 oz can of pineapple. I think its great. It may not be the prettiest, but it still gets eaten up!

Melted Butter or slices of butter???  That seems to be the topic of conversation in a lot of the reviews.  By mistake, I did both and I'm here to tell you, it didn't make any difference.  Forgetting I was supposed to slice the butter, I melted one stick.  While it was still in the microwave I remembered so I sliced the other stick over 1/2 the cake (not stirring the cake and fruit together but layering it) and then poured the melted butter over the other 1/2.  It did bake longer than the stated time b/c I was wanting a golden top.  Both sides of the cake looked and tasted the same.   My hubby wondered why I would ruin cherry pie filling with pineapple.  I told him b/c the cherry pie filling is almost $4.00 a can and using two cans of it would make this a more expensive dessert.  He liked it well enough to sliver the cake to death in three days.  So there you have it.

I'm one of those that just can't leave a recipe alone. 
Mix  Apple and Blueberry or
        Cherry and Blueberry,
        Peach is also good 
Actually, most any two pie fillings.  
On top of the pie fillings and pineapple, I also add Nature Valley Granola Protein, with Oats and Dark Chocolate, and I sprinkle oats on top. The last thing I use is the butter. It comes out beautiful. The top is crunchy too. When I put the fillings in I either mix them a little or put one on one side and the other on the opposite side. Enjoy!

I used pecans vs walnuts as I like the sweeter taste. Can't go wrong with this quick recipe. I found that it took about 75 minutes to bake but I baked on convection and all ovens bake differently. Best to eat warm. Yum.

This a great tasting, easy to make dessert. A great dish to take to a cookout or get together. I highly recommend serving it with ice cream. If you take this to a get together, don't expect any left overs to take home. Also, if you don't like cherry or wish to try something different, any fruit pie filling will work.

I found a recipe almost identical to this in an old "Texas Celebrity Cookbook." I've made it several times, and it always gets rave reviews.

Way too sweet!  I even used unsweetened pineapple.  I can't imagine making this with sweetened pineapple. As another poster suggested, I froze and grated the butter so that it spread more evenly.  Will not make again.

You can make this cake in any flavor. My favorite is BLUEBEERY. Besides the blueberry pie filling I add fresh blueberries and sometimes coconut.  I love this recipe. Quick and too easy.

Now This is a 'dump' cake!

i see recipes labeled 'dump' cake that require eggs and a mixing bowl - Those i  myself would place in Another category.

Afterall,  'dump' Must  live up to its' name! -  You Only  do jus' That ( drop and or place is OK too) ,  w/ All the ingredients. 

Alrighthen if you want to chop your nuts beforehand, or like I read - a lady 'combined' a can each of pineapple and cherries......and of course your butter usually has to be separated into smaller pieces, OK  but keep it as Simple as you can Son shine.  = )   No Mixing!

I make mine from scratch and leave the cake mix at the store.  I use just crushed pineapple and rum and sprinkle shredded coconut on top.  It tastes like a pina colado cake.

I looked up this recipe because I couldn't remember the order to layer the ingredients. This is close to my version with a couple differences I thought others might benefit from: 1. I don't bother mixing the cherry pie filling and pineapple together=each is it's own layer. 2. I use chopped pecans as they don't have the slightly bitter flavor walnuts tend to have. And most importantly 3. I use a sprinkled layer of light brown sugar which makes it imho. High Y-U-M factor!!! Only bake until heated through.

I remember my mother making this when I was young and was very pleased to find the recipe.  I put the cake mix on top of the cherry-pineapple mixture and didn't mix them and then dotted it with pats of butter.  It was just like I remembered from my childhood. It's a very sweet and rich desert.

Cooked this for a guy friend of mines and he adored it. I personally thought it was a little too sweet but nothing a cup of water can't handle and probably getting less sugar fruits as well. Turned out absolutely gorgeous.. Make sure to add the butter all over the yellow cake mix so it can cook faster!!

SOOOOO good for the amount of effort that goes into making this desert. I did end up using 2 cans of cherry pie filling, glad I bought two from the store! My daughter pretty much made this by herslef alls I did was open the ingredients and cut up the butter, I didn't melt it she just put pats of butter all over the top. The walnuts are very yummy on this. Will make again and again.

The recipe was as simple as it can get. I would combine the cake mix with the fruit. I just put the mix on top and used about 1 stick of butter on top. Great recipe my wife loved it.

Following the advice of other reviewers, I didn't mix the fruit with the cake mix before baking. I ended up with a lot of dry cake mix in the middle. But the taste was absolutely great, just very sweet, so start with small portions!!

I didn't have any Cherries so I used Pineapple chunks AND their juice. I also cut the butter onto the top instead of melting and pouring.Turned out wonderfully! I will be making this again..probably without the cherries too!

This really didn't turn out well for me.  I did slightly stir the cake mix in and maybe I shouldn't have.  I used lite cherry filling which was o.k. The cake was basically flat and not a pretty thing to look at - at all. My husband took one look at it and wouldn't even try it. I gave it 3 stars because my sons said it tasted alright and it was the easiest thing I've ever made.

This was okay--wasn't what I expected.  This was more like bread pudding. Maybe I should have baked it longer? I didn't put the walnuts on because my son is allergic.  Maybe walnuts would have made it a lot better. Also, it probably made a big difference that I used soy margarine rather than butter.

We love this... it's quick and easy.  The other night I was changed the main ingredients and it still turned out great.  I used blueberry pie filling, classic white cake mix, 1 1/2 cups pecans and 1 cup of shredded coconut.  

I always mix the pie filling and pineapple together in a bowl and then spread it in the pan.

I got this recipe from my mother-in-law years ago,but I had forgotten how to make it. She used almond slivers instead of walnuts, however I cannot eat nuts so I sprinkle the top with coconut. I also have used i can of evaporated milk instead of butter far a little differant taste.

Everyone seemed to like this dessert at Christmas, but I do NOT like the taste of canned pineapple so next time I think I'll leave it out.  Quick & easy dessert...

This was a huge hit at work.  The only change I made was to leave out the nuts and mix in about 1/2 the cake batter with the fruit and then left the rest on top with the butter.  Good recipe and I will make this one again!

I LOVE this recipe! I got this one back 20 years ago, and the only difference is adding in another 8 oz of chopped pecans into the mix. EVERYONE raves about this!! :-D

This was sickening sweet.  I also didn't like the texture.  It wasn't very cake like at all; too moist.

Gave 4 stars only bc so many people at the party that I served this at raved about this cake, but personally I did not think it was anything special.  It is good and very easy to make (used toasted pecans as I am allergic to walnuts) but I would only make this again to take to a potluck (not for personal family consumption).  I did use a deeper dish than requested and this did change the cooking time (almost an hour) and maybe the texture as well.  I will try a shallower dish next time.
