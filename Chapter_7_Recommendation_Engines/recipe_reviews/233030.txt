I love a recipe that is both tasty and easy! I wasn't sure how well an apple would taste in the stuffing, but it gave a nice, fresh flavor that helped cut the saltiness of the stuffing. The stuffing I used was pretty salty so I used 1 C broth and 1 C water.

Very nice stuffing recipe.  I'm not a fan of the apple, so I would leave it out next time.  The celery added a nice flavor.  My family liked it a lot!
