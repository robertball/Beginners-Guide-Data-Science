My family & I really enjoyed this recipe and I have a 10 yr old daughther!  She said it was great.  I did, however, marinade the tuna in Italian dressing for 2 hours before cooking it.  I also placed the beans on a bed of raw spinach to up the veggie content.  Thanks!

I loved this!  I made extra marinade and marinated the tuna for 30 minutes before cooking. It was delicious.

Amazing recipe! If you're a tuna fan, you'll love this. We love barely cooked tuna and also love beans, so this was perfect for us.

This tuna was a fabulous dish.  Great for anytime of the year.  The flavors all mesh together in a wonderful way to make your mouth (and stomach) smile.  Easy to make, this one will impress your friends.
