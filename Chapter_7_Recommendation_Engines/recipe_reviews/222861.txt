So easy and SO delicious! Remarkably, you don't even miss the butter.

This has already become a summer staple for my family!

So simple, yet so delicious! I agree with the other reviewer who said you don't miss the butter. I followed the recipe as written, except that I found med-high heat to be too hot. I grilled mine over low heat and turned often. After about 15 mins of grilling, I moved them over indirect heat and let them finish cooking while I grilled some meat.   The combination of flavors here is outstanding - you get a nice tang from the lime juice and wonderful chili flavor with the sweetness from the corn. A keeper!

I made this a few weeks ago, more for my husband than me.  I was so surprised and delighted to find out that I actually liked it!  I normally don't really like Corn-on-the-Cob, but I ate two and was disappointed there wasn't anymore.  I'm making it again tonight!  Thank you so much! :)

Delicious!  I squeezed the lime and added the spices straight to the corn, wrapped foil on each and threw them on the BBQ.  Less maintenance and still an amazing mix of flavors.

The lime flavor was too much for me. Just didn't care for it.

Very very good.  We did it in the husks, minus silk, and then recovered them to grill.  Very pungent.
