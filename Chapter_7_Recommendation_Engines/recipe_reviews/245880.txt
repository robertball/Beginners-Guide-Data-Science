As much as I appreciate the dish for my own personal preference I wasn't a big fan. I found the mint created an odd taste, Ive never eaten a cold noodle dish so that was a little different for me, also the noodles did not mix well with the rest of the ingredients. I even rinsed them in cold water and added a few tablespoons of olive oil to prevent clumping and it still didn't mix very well. Maybe it was because I used rice noodles instead of egg. I will give it 4/5 stars because I do think it has potential just not for me.

This is absolutely fantastic with some changes. I used 3 chicken breasts grilled, cooled, and cut up into bite size pieces. I also used 1 cup of diced raw carrots instead of cooked carrots, diced 1 red bell pepper, used traditional rice noodles, doubled the soy and sweet chili sauces, and left out the baby corn. The result was a wonderfully flavored  fresh and healthy dish that my entire family (including 3 young boys) loved. To keep noodles from getting mushy make sure you run cold water over the noodles, stirring them at the same time. If They're left hot, they'll keep cooking a bit, resulting in over cooked noodles. Bite into one before removing from water to make sure it's the consistency you want, then follow with the cold water.  Definitely a keeper.

Delicious!  And my picky daughter loved it.  She has been eating less and less meat so we didn't add the chicken but I did add 1 red bell pepper.  Once we finished cooking she exclaimed with a big smile on her face: "Mom, this is Vegan!"

The dressing for this is excellent.  The salad was OK, but next eim  I will use  coarsely shredded  carrot instead of canned, one large chicken breast, cooked and shredded instead of canned, no mini corn, and fresh peas and some finely chopped red or orange pepper.   Sliced green onion/scallions would be better than the red onion also.  Will make again with these changes.

Very good recipe. I decided to make it as a hot meal as we found it more satisfying that way. Also, I suggest cutting back a little on the lime juice. Otherwise very tasty!!

This is a fabulous dish that is quick, easy, and has excellent taste. Add chicken or shrimp for a perfect light meal. I'll will be making it again for an upcoming party this weekend.

I substituted pasta for rice noodles (because I forgot to get the rice noodles).  The dish was amazing! we could'nt get enough! The calorie difference is about 60, so the change means one must forgo a rice cake snack

Very easy. I feel like it took me less than 20 minutes. I added uncooked peeled shrimp which added great texture and another layer of flavor

Very easy, fast, and delicious!  I served it on a bed of chopped lettuce and I thought that was a great addition to make this a full meal.

Made as directed and found it to be delicous!
Added some spiralized veggies to subsequent batches for fun.

I made a few changes - I used fresh chicken breast instead of canned. I also used raw carrots diced because I thought canned would have a strange texture. I think both were improvements and overall this was a pretty good salad. I might make again.

We absolutely loved the sauce in this noodle dish, but the choice of veggies just didn't suit our tastes.

I really think you can't go wrong with this! The cilantro and mint really complement one another. I had a problem because the noodles ( rice noodle double package from Trader J) were mushy. The only thing I can think I did wrong was overcook them. Any suggestions regarding the noodles? I can see that this can easily be delicious even without the chicken ( I had left over crock pot chicken though so I used some). I didn't have a sweet chili sauce so I tapered with a bit of extra time, salt and honey- worked fine). Great recipe
