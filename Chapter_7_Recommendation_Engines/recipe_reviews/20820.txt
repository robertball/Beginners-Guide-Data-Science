Tasted great. Only suggestion I have is to halve the sauce. I used a 56 ounce package of Smokies so I thought I would need roughly 25 ounces each of the cocktail sauce and the grape jelly. Turns out a 12 ounce jar of cocktail sauce and a 15 ounce jar of grape jelly made more than enough for all those sausages.

I have several variations I make on this recipe; I heat up the ingredients in a microwaveable bowl 1st then switch it to the crockpot to keep warm for serving. For The Grandchildren: DO NOT use cocktail sauce -- instead I add to taste a couple tablespoons of prepared yellow mustard & a standard BBQ sauce...

we used to have this when  I was a kid. Everyone devours this. Mom always made this in a crock pot and let it simmer at least an hour or two before putting on the buffet table so the meat could really soak up the flavor of the sauce. Works great with Kielbasa as well(thats how Mom liked it best).

Definitely needs adjusting! I used 2 (16 ounce) package of smokies 8 oz cocktail and 8 oz grape jelly they were swimming! Once I drained some of liquid out they were yummy! Also remember to dump your sausages on a paper towel to drain all the excess juice from bag BEFORE you add them to the jelly mixture. There is alot of excess liquid in those bags!

What a great variation to the bar-b-que sauce recipe. I like this so much better. If you can get pass the cocktail sauce and grape jelly try adding a can of drained pineapple chunks. It's so good! Thanks Judy for the recipe!

Don't be put off by the grape jelly!! and don't be afraid to try other variations. I have used red current preserves and added to it about 1/2 cup of barby sauce (any kind) even a couple tablespoons of honey I'm going to try a dash of A-1 steak sauce in it too!!! This is GREAT!!!

This type of recipe is something my mom has made for years and years. She always used chili sauce instead of cocktail sauce and so do I. I also add 2 teaspoons of fresh prepared horseradish for a little bite but not overbearing and the juice of half a lemon. Just brightens the flavor a bit. Like other reviewers have said just because you massively increase the amount of wieners you don't have to match the increase with the sauce 1 for 1. I also like to brown the wieners in a frying pan before adding to the sauce.

I use 2 bottles of chili sauce (24oz total) + 1 jar of grape jelly (18oz).  Warm in a pot on the stove to blend the 2 together.  Pour over the wieners in a crockpot & let them warm together. Longer the better I think. Never have any leftovers.  Very easy!

I bought the items needed for this recipe for my wedding reception and a family member put it together. Wouldn't you know but it was the one thing we didn't end up with any left of!! The only difference with what she did was that she did add some bottled BBQ sauce in with it and also used more smokies but the result was fantastic! I'll be making this again for family get togethers!

I made this recipe ahead of time for a party and had a my friend's little girl (who would be at the party) try it before I made a second batch. She said she absolutely loved it and so I let her snack on a few before I put in a second package of cocktail wieners. The sauce was enough for two packs of 16oz wieners (32oz in total) so I just added them to the portion of sauce I'd already made. I must admit I was very sceptical about this recipe because of the jelly but there's no way you could possibly know that jelly is in the sauce unless someone told you. This is an excellent recipe. I would recommend letting the wieners cook slower and longer in the sauce to get the full effect of the flavor. Thanks for the great recipe!

This bizarre concotion is delicious so don't let the ingredients scare you away from a real treat! My only recommendation is that it needs more time to "marinate" so the taste is all in the meat not just the sauce-- I made this in the morning- let it cook for 15 minutes turned it off let it cool put it in the refrigerator all day and then warmed it up that night for the party. Everyone raved and there wasn't a single bite left!

I made this recipe for an Oktoberfest party and everyone loved it. I think using chili sauce instead of cocktail sauce would definitely be good as the cocktail sauce is a bit strong even with the sweetness of the grape jelly. I think it would also be good to use these wieners for pigs in a blanket either as a marinade before cooking them or as a dip on the side.

This was not a hit! Usually around here if it has wienies in it it's a hit. Maybe it was the cocktail wieners not sure yet. I have frozen the sauce and plan to try it with meatballs?????

I substituted the cocktail sauce with hickory barbecue sauce and let them cook for an hour so that the sauce would begin to carmelize. Everyone loved them and kept going back for more.

It's all about the proportion of jelly to chili sauce and 50/50 is right on! I made 8 pounds (4 lbs meatballs from sam's club 2 lbs wieners from sam's club) of this for a party of 60 and there wasn't a single meat ball or wiener left. The only thing I added was about 4 tablespoons of cayanne but I'm not sure it even needed it.

I was a little skeptical of the cocktail sauce/grape jelly combination but it turned out great! I made these for a super bowl party and everyone enjoyed them. I did mix everything in a crock pot and let it all cook in there for awhile.

We REALLY liked these. I did use 2 lbs of sausages for this sauce and I boiled it quite awhile to reduce it into a sticky true sauce instead of just a bubbling liquid. I didn't stir it often enough so my sauce burnt to the bottom of my pan but the flavor was still fantastic. I'll absolutely make this again thank you! P.S. I made the meatballs recipe with the chili sauce/grape jelly and didn't like it but the cocktail sauce/grape jelly with sausages is totally wonderful. Thanks for sharing!

Made several appy's tonight for a party tomorrow and we ended up dumping the sauce and rinsing off the dogs. Nothing about this recipe tasted good to us so I ended up just making a standard barbeque sauce. Sorry....

Really really tasty. Really really easy. I doubled the recipe since I was having a big party. I followed the recipe but I used currant jelly as other suggested. I heated up the cocktail sauce and jelly in a pot until they melted together added the wieners cooked them a few minutes then tossed the whole lot into a crock pot for the party. Delicious!

My niece loved them so much that she hardly ate anything else besides them. This is a wonderful recipe that should be used at any party or get together. I will definitely be making these again soon!

Love this recipe(with a few changes). I always make it in my crockpot it is so much easier. I use the entire jar of cocktail sauce but only about half the jar of jelly. You need to taste it as the two heat up. It is a great appetizer and everyone loves it. If you and your guests don't like it you might be doing something wrong!:)

These were OK figured with all the good reviews would be better. Usually just make it with Catalina dressing and weinies. Probably will just go back to that.

I made these this weekend and they were a hit! The only things that I learned were that A) the cocktail sauce had too much horseradish for our taste so I used the chili sauce like others had recommended and I liked it A LOT more and B) that I had to heat them on the stove before putting them in the crock pot (took a long time to heat through in the slow cooker after coming straight from the fridge). Overall a success and will make them again!

I have tested this tasty treat at other's homes but never attempted it. I read through the reviews and used only 4 oz. of the BBQ Sauce and Jelly. I simmered for about an hour in a small sauce pan and it came out wonderful. Highly recommended!

I used two packages of wieners as suggested by other reviewers and cooked the sauce with the weiners on low in a crockpot for a few hours. Even with the two packages though the sauce was thick and more than needed. We had to fish around in the sauce for the wieners. The jelly and cocktail sauce flavors cancelled each other out and left an unimpressive taste. Will not use again.

Recipe is great as is but u might consider adding a bit of mustard - start with a teaspoon(t) and then to taste. Seriously consider adding pineapple chunks or tidbits with juice and for adults add some whiskey. Crockpot for 3-4 hours. Serve warm with toothpicks for wieners & pineapple chunks.....simply amazing. Usually all gone at every party!

Bought cocktail smokies @ Costco. Turned out really good. Used the grape jelly and chili sauce with some brown spicy mustard. I made a large crockpot full but still used only about 1 cup each of the jelly and chill sauce. Simmered a bit first on stove then put in crockpot to keep warm. Would definitely make again.

I've used this recipe at my parties for years. I also add meatballs in with the smoked sausages. Always a crowd favorite.

We love these! Truly a must have party food! I usually double the amount of cocktail wieners for this amount of sauce and there are NEVER leftovers!

This is a super easy great cocktail weenie recipe. It doesn't look so appealing when you first glop in the jelly and sauce but once it warms up it mixes together nice and smooth and tastes great. This sauce is also wonderful with meatballs and served as a dip for pigs in a blanket.

The first time I had these it was without knowing what was in the 'sauce'. If I had known the ingredients first I would have been put off (it truly sounds gross) and not even tried them. Glad I didn't know! They are fantastic for parties etc. (Super Bowl party... they were gone first.)

There were only two of these little guys left after we had a party so an easy app that went over well. I think I will try a different variety of coctail wiener next time because the ones I bought tasted too smoky for the sauce.

These were very easy and very good. I served this at a party and left the wieners and sauce in a crockpot on warm. This kept the wieners and sauce warm throughout the nite and people could eat them at their leisure. One of my friends never left the side of the crockpot and ate them until he was finished sharing some with a few other guests of course.

These were a hit at my teen daughter's Chrismukah party. I used chili sauce per others' suggestion and raspberry preserves. Could have used one more package of wieners and still had plenty of sauce. Thanks!

It did make to much sauce but I made a bunch for my son's graduation and there was not one left over. So it must have been good.

Way too much sauce! Would make it better if there were 64oz of smokies.

This recipe was alright if you really like the flavor of grape jelly then this is for you. I followed the recipe to the "t" and when complete all I could taste was the grape jelly... I added a little more cocktail sauce and it was a little better. Overall it's not a bad recipe.
