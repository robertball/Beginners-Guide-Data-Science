I submitted this recipe and it was changed by the all recipe people.  I only called for pineapple, not mango and apple.  I think that with all that fruit, I would have to agree with the earlier review that it is too much.

I used Ingredient Search for pineapple, chicken and sausage.  This is the only recipe that came up.  I read to the end, and almost cried when I saw "apples" and "mango."  I thought the author of the recipe was going overboard.  Just the pineapple would have been sufficient.  Glad to hear the author didn't add those two atrocious ingredients.  I made this dish WITHOUT the apples and mango, and it came out splendidly.

I made this without the apple, and doubled both the mango and pineapple. It was delish! A little Jamaican jerk hot sauce on the side helped for those in the family that like a little extra spice. A new family fave.

Yummy!  I used Quinoa instead of the Rice since that's what I had.  I also didn't bother putting it in the oven, just did it all in the saucepan on the stove.  Only used pineapple (not other fruits) as others suggested.  Sub'd turkey sausage (pre-cooked so added at end just after the shrimp was almost done cooking)... turned out great.  Also used small yellow/red sweet peppers instead of green pepper and 1/2 a jalapeno.  This is a keeper!

This was wonderful. I didnt read the reviews first so I added all the fruit.  It came out fine for me. I didn't measure the amount of red pepper flakes so I may have added more, which may be why I didn't find it too sweet.  I didnt think the apple added much, but I did like the mango and pineapple.. Will make this again

Yum.  I used just fresh pineapple and mango. Chose regular smoked sausage and cooked it all in one pan, an enamel coated dutch oven.  After first oven cooking, rice looked dry so added the remaining petite diced tomatoes from a 15 ounce can and a few ounces more white wine.

Made this for dinner and really enjoyed the flavor, however the rice did not cook entirely. Not sure if it was the type of rice I used (traditional long grain brown), or if the ratio of liquid to rice was incorrect. Overall, enjoyed the combination in this jambalaya.

Would like to try this but far too many ingredients. Will look for simpler version.

Wow!  This recipe truly is a 5-star winner.  Following the submitter's review about not including apple in the original submission, I left it out.  I agree with others, that it would not have been as good with the apple, but was WONDERFUL with everything but the apple.  For the wine, I used sherry, and it was perfect.  I'll definitely be adding this to my short list of recipes good enough for special guests.  Thanks for submitting it!

This was excellent! I thought the fruit would be weird in it, but it mellows out the spices quite nicely.  You don't really notice it as you eat it, there's just a hint of sweetness.  Have made this for others and received rave reviews!  Thanks for sharing.

It was good and my husband commented that he liked it a lot. I've made it twice now and my 7 year old will eat it but not very willingly. This time she said it was the mangoes she didn't like. I forgot the apple, so next time I'll sub apples for mangoes. I used canned fruit instead of fresh and that made it really easy. I used entire cans and an entire apple. Extra fruit can never be a bad thing. I used instant brown rice and I was worried it wouldn't cook, but it did.

Sorry, but this recipe didn't do it for me. I tried it because I thought that adding mango and pineapple was an interesting twist.  I made it according to the recipe, but it was very bland; basically needed to have the seasonings doubled. I gave it a two star rating because I took away two things from making it. Sauteing the rice kept it firm after cooking, not mushy like it can get. I will use that method in my regular Jambalaya recipe from now on. And I learned a new method of skinning a mango. Filet both sides of the mango around the pit, then use an ordinary water glass to scoop the flesh from the skin. No muss, no fuss!

The great thing about a Jambalaya recipe is the base idea.  In this case is was to add fresh fruit...in my option is doesnt matter what fruit you add because that is a preference thing.  If you think about it, tomato is a fruit and other fruits compliment. This was a fun recipe to experiment with!!  In my other review of a dish I said that my mother is in Stage 4 cancer and it is imperative that she eat....and she ATE IT ALL.

I found this a delicious and easy dish to make.  I left out the meat & shrimp but used Chorizo (meatless) Smart Sausages by Lightlife.  I also left out 1/2 tsp of white pepper as I didn't have it plus my wife likes less spicy.  My fruit portions was closer to 3/4 cup each which I think really balances out the spice.  My wife raved about this dish!

I like it a lot....however the directions...not that great. To begin...with the shrimp....it doesn't say if it's pre-cooked...or raw shrimp. I used cooked...and made sure NOT to cook it for that extra 10 minutes like it says in the recipe (tasted just fine...if I had cooked it...think it would have tasted over done).
My second problem...the cooking of the rice: NO WAY was that rice done in twenty minutes.  Long grain usually takes 40 and I ended up putting this dish back in the oven for at least another 20 to makes sure it cooked completely.  
I used red pepper rather than green to give it more flavor.
Other than that....this was a great dish and will make it again. Company LOVED it.

Based on previous reviews,  I used chicken apple sausage, omitted the apples, added 2 C. of broth & 1/2 C. wine and all the tomatoes.  I made sure that I sauteed the rice at least 5 minutes before adding liquids.  Baked 30 minutes covered and rice was done (brown will most likely take longer).  I would decrease the amount of red pepper flakes.  Personal preference.  Husband liked.  Not sure I would make again.

I really enjoyed this dish. I used apple,  mango and pineapple and thought it added a nice sweetness that was not overwhelming. I used mild Italian sausage and made my own chili powder  (I was all out) out of garlic powder, cumin, oregano, paprika and cayenne.  This added a nice heat to the dish that may have helped counter the sweetness. 
Would definitely make it again, even my picky kids liked it!

I wasted good shrimp on this  - I threw it out as Inedible.
