Made this for lunch today for me & the grands..I expected them to take one bite & ask for something else but they ate it all! I was out of celery so I subbed red bell pepper instead & I don't have any rice wine vinegar so I subbed rice vinegar that I added a tbp. or so of mirin to. Served it on a bed of shredded lettuce & garnished w/ chow mein noodles (which added a nice crunch). Very unusual but very tasty chicken salad...thanks Pam!

Great flavor but needed a little more dressing. If you like it sweet, add more hoisin sauce. We had it over fresh cabbage - nice summer dish!

My hubby didn't like it because he doesn't like sour foods, but I loved it!

This is extremely delicious.  Full-flavored, the chicken is tender, and even the presentation is pretty. ^_^
