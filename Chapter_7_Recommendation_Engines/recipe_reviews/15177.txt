This recipe gets four stars only because it does seem to call for quite a bit of personal tweaking based on individual taste.  However, the ingredients are just what you need to achieve that special Ginger dressing found in most sushi restaurants.
So, instead of tweaking batch after batch to reach your intended flavor, just keep close and coarsley chop each of the ingredients so they're readily available to toss into your blender as needed. And besides, I'm sure many of you true asian cuisine cooks know how little we ever measure ingredients!!  To further explain:

Ginger-(Best fresh from root or even the pickled kind--NOT powdered, it can add a bitter taste and ruin that light salmon color)
Peanut Oil-(NOT olive oil NOR sesame oil. Tried both to frightening results. The peanut oil is key! It's what makes the creamy taste and texture)
Celery-(only fresh, and don't be afraid of adding more--it gives the dressing that fresh, crisp taste)
Onion and Garlic-(NO powdered stuff either, this is where you can add a little bit at a time to your blender it can indeed over power your dressing)
Salt/Soy sauce-Use either, but I prefer Fish sauce as it doesn't ruin the color and since it's saltier it only requires a small amount)
The Ketchup-(I just recommend a bit of fresh tomato--using ketchup can also add a funnyl, stale taste)
The lemon juice & rice wine vinegar-(use the real stuff--it's not that expensive and both are versatile in lots of dishes)
The Pepper & Sugar-(Didn't feel the nee

This particular recipe was the closest thing to the recipie I like at my favorite sushi restaurant. Some changes I would make would be to use olive oil instead of the peanut oil. The nutty flavor overpowers the fresh ginger flavor I'm used to. I reduced the vinegar 1/2 cup and then added water to the 1/3 cup line. I added 1 stalk of celery instead of the suggested 2T. I also added and additional tsp. of sugar and omitted the pepper. The dressing at jap. restraunts seem to have alot of texture so I added 1 1/2 carrots in the blender and it came out perfect. It took 3 trys but now I make it for all my family and friends, we LOVE it!

This salad dressing is THE BOMB!  We love it and my guests love it too!  I have to give out the recipe.  I substitute 1/4 C. of chicken broth for half the oil and replace half of the oil with sesame oil.  It's awesome!

Very good.  I used Rice Vinegar instead of Rice Wine Vinegar (same??) and I used jarred minced ginger, but it turned out very well.  Thanks to the reviewer who said not to waste time chopping.  I threw in chunks of onion and whole garlic cloves - no problem.  Next time I'll use 1/2 sesame oil.

A fine tasting dressing.  The flavors are much better once it has sat in the fridge for a few hours.  I added some sesame oil as well, and found it to give the dressing a "deeper" flavor.  I wish I had seen the review that told us to not bother chopping (mincing) the ingredients!  Why bother when we are blending it all?!  I made a chicken and salad dish, and not only used the dressing on the salad, but I drizzled it on the meat too.  My husband loved it!  I will make this again.

Delicious!!! Used the suggested 1T ketchup, added 1/2 tsp sesame oil, and didn't have minced celery on me. Still delicious...just like the real thing. Will make over and over again!

After many attempts with this recipe, I believe I have created the dressing identical to the one found at japanese steakhouse restaurants. It might be wise to specify to use REAL white onions, celery, ginger, garlic and chop it yourself, not powdered or bottled minced spices. I used bottled minced onions on my first attempt, however the result was far too acidic. Fresh chopped white onions did the trick. As for the ketchup, I recommend using the homemade ketchup, not heinz. Do not subtitute any ingredients for the ones listed. I achieved the best result using the suggested recipe. Some suggested using olive/sesame oil and white wine vinegar as substitutes, but doing so will stray the taste from the real japanese restaurant salad dressing we all love. Many thanks to the one who posted this recipe! It's perfect!

I honestly don't understand why people feel the need to change a recipe and rate based on changes. Make it the way it is stated. I have with this recipe and it is perfect! I have made this dressing consistently and the only thing I ever changed is the oil, and that is only because of what I had on hand.. Trust me, you will love it!!

Exactly what I was looking for. Even though I didn't have all the right ingredients, it still tasted fabulous and I could tell it would have tasted just like the dressing at Japanese restaurants if I hadn't needed to make the adjustments. I ended up eating two bowls of salad it was so good.

I haven't a clue how I could have messed this up, but it tasted nothing like the dressing served at our two favorite Japanese Steakhouses. It was entirely too acidic. I used good quality peanut oil and rice wine vinegar, so it wasn't that. If you are looking for something cool and refreshing and a little creamy, this probably isn't the recipe for you.

The recipie was great - only I think that thwere was too much ketchup.  I would reduce the amount of ketchup.  As well, I added a bit more oil and soy sauce. (I also added a few drops of sesemme seed oil)  After I made teh dressing, my boyfrined then said - you could have just put the onion and celery into the blender - no need to mince it by hand... When I make the dressing again, I will certainly do that!

An incredible mix of flavors. We really liked this. Though have never been to a Japanese restaurant I imagine this taste to be very similar to what would be on their menu. Thanks Holly.

This is a great recipe which has all the components to create the unique flavor of restaurant style dressing, however, I tweaked a few things. As a few other people have mentioned, the peanut oil is KEY. Instead of soy sauce, I used Ponzu, a citrus infused soy sauce. I almost always use this in lieu of soy sauce because, to me, it simply just tastes MUCH better. Additionally, I used tomato paste instead of ketchup, omitted the onions, and added about twice the amount of ginger, carrots, and celery. The added veggies give it a lot of texture which I personally enjoy. I'm always disappointed when I get this in a Japanese restaurant and the dressing is watery. I omitted the onions because I have a strong aversion to raw onions and when I made it with them previously, I found the flavor to be overpowering. The great thing about this recipe is it provides you the basic ingredients but you can always customize for personal taste. Have fun with it, let it sit overnight (if you can wait, this stuff is amazing), and enjoy! Thanks so much for posting!

The only "famous" Japanese restaurant we have in my area is Shogun and this is similar to theirs but not quite. It is still good though and the leftover made an excellent marinade for some boneless pork chops I fixed the next night for dinner.

Very much like the restaurant style dressing! Be careful not to use too much ketchup though. I think I would start with a little less next time and add to taste.

Not at all the recipe I was looking for, very different from the restaurant dressing.  This was very ginger-y and had too much soy sauce or something...I don't know.  I made it twice trying to adjust, but it never did work out.

I made this as part of a full course Valentine's day dinner for my hubby. I substituted a little sesame oil for the peanut, and used less overall than called for. It was good, but was missing an element of something, not sure what, maybe salt. Will make again tho.

This recipe was very easy to make -with some substitutions.  I used 
regular salad oil, the prepared ginger from the grocery (the pink kind), left out
the celery (because I didn't have any.)  I also doubled the recipe.  The kids
had two servings of salad, and we had enough left over for the next night.  We
eat a lot of Japanese food - this tastes just like the kind at Benihana.

I followed the recipe exactly EXCEPT I added a few carrots because they bring a richer flavor and pulp-like consistency I was trying to mimic like the orange colored dressing I've had in Japanese restaurants. I really think the carrots are key. It's the missing ingredient in my opinion!!!!

First of all, this exact recipe is on topsecretrecipes.com and this is a replica of the Benihana Ginger Salad Dressing. The person who posted this simply didn't credit that site.. I tried this dressing over a year ago and it's perfect as is, tastes just like the one at Benihana's, so the people who are always saying it needs tweaking and this and that, just know that this is a recipe made to taste exactly like the one Benihana's restaurant and it does. Maybe the ones who constantly want to change it just don't know how the one's at BH's taste.

Too onion-y and not quite the light dressing I get at a Japanese restaurant. Added more celery and sugar to take away some of the bite.

I thought this recipe was great.  It turned out to not exactly be what I was hunting for, but it worked out great with my sashimi dinner.  Like everyone else, I added some pure sesame oil for more flavor and backed off on the ketchup a bit.  Bf loved it!!

This recipe is just like advertised.  I love the ginger dressing that you get at Japanese Restaurants and this is it.  I substituted low-carb ketchup and then used two packets of splenda and it still came out perfect.  Thanks to whomever posted this.

Great!  Tastes just like the salad dressing served in my local restaurants (more or less).  Don't blend too much or it will not have the authentic thickness of restaurant dressings.  Will definitely make this repeatedly!

This is the only correct recipe.  Others will call for miso or vegetable oil instead of peanut oil.  Trust me the peanut oil is better for you and taste much better.  Simply Delicious!!!

I've been looking for a real Japanese ginger dressing for a long time. This one is it. For sure. Thumbs up from all my family. Make sure you read the long review from anatonline. I took her advise and used fresh tomato, with only a squirt of ketchup for color. I also had to add a tad more sugar, and I added half teaspoon of brown sugar. Came out perfect. This ones it folks. For sure.

I needed a good sesame ginger dressing & found this one. Only change I made was added 2 tsp of sesame oil & I tsp of honey to dressing mix instead of sugar. Turned out wonderful with a shrimp noodle recipe I had. (Cook 8 oz spaghettini al dente. Add 2 cups broccoli coleslaw mix, half cup minced cilantro, 1 lb of shrimp which I sauteed with olive oil & some ginger garlic & dash of soya sauce. Mix all this together in a bowl with 2/3 cup of this salad dressing. Refrigerate until needed. ) Delicious!!

Maybe I did something wrong, but I did not care for this salad dressing.  Usually I'm a fantastic cook and but this wasn't what I thought it would be at all.  I won't be trying it again.

OMG!! So good!! I took some advice of others and omitted the salt and water and added more celery (i like mine chunky). After I let it "marinate" in the frig. for a few hours it was wonderful!! Give it a try!

Tastes exactly like the Japanese restaurants, OMG I am soooo happy!! One thng left out of the recipe that is a key factor, is that you need to chill the dressing for several hours before it is ready. I will definately make this over, and over,and over.

This was ok, It wasn't exactly like the restaurant one I love so much.  I have a different one that tastes more like the authentic which is very similar to this.  This one just seemed a little too sweet for my taste.  I added more ginger and garlic which helped out.
Think I will dig out my old one I found online somewhere for the next batch.  Thanks though, it is close for those who don't have a keeper.

Pretty tasty! I was quite skeptical, but it turned out good. I'm not a huge fan of rice wine vinegar, so I used a little less and added a little more lemon juice.

What a fantastic and flavorful dressing! I substituted good quality olive oil for the peanut (allergy concerns), cut back on the soy by 1tsp, and half the ketchup for srirracha chili sauce. Will make many more times!

Very tasty recipe but way too much onion flavor for my taste. I think I would cut the onion by at least half next time, and there will definitely be a next time.

This salad dressing tastes just like the
one that is served at Japanese steak
houses.  I was suprised at how well all
the ingredients blended together to make
a fresh and mildly spicy flavor.

The preparation is a little extensive 
for family dinner most nights, but it 
would impress guests at a dinner party.
You could make it up a few days ahead 
of time too.

If you have a little extra time, this 
recipe is worth trying.

Note: It is importent to use Rice Vinegar (which adds a sweet flavor) and not just regular vinegar.

Good recipe, I followed it to the letter, I read where some say not to mince the onion and celery, but how do you measure? I used all fresh ingredients no powdered or Jared stuff and I was done in five minutes, so why cheat?
Now as for taste, I like it but I'm used to a little more depth and I think that comes from sesame oil. So I might add a teaspoon to my next batch. I did let this sit a few before tasting and reviewing because most dressings taste better the next day.

Instead of sugar add 1/4 c. honey. You need the sweetness to counteract the salt and acid.

Loved this recipe. I had a craving for ginger dressing but wanted an organic alternative. So instead of buying a dressing at the store, I made this one. I didn't have peanut oil but substituted with sesame oil instead. Tasted just like the Japanese restaurant version.

this tastes almost exactly like the dressing you get in a japanese restaurant.  my suggestion is to do something that decreases the strong taste of onion just a bit.

This incredibly fresh tasting dressing hits all the right flavor notes that one would expect from their favorite Japanese steakhouse.  The texture is spot-on as well; the dressing clung to the lettuce leaves instead of pooling at the bottom of the salad bowl.  A tasty topping for a simple salad with leftover grilled chicken, oranges and almonds.  Thanks MARBALET.

This recipe was delicious. I couldn't tell whether I was suppose to use regular white onions or the asian onions.  As I read other people's reviews about how overpowering the onion flavor was, i realized they must have used the wrong type of onion.  You have to use the asian onion and what I would recommend using is the "white" part.  My dressing came out perfectly. My guests and I will definitely make this again.  The only thing I changed from this is that I did not add ketchup, I used a couple of small fresh tomatoes and didn't use rice wine vinegar but regular rice vinegar.  It came out perfectly and very similar to the japanese restaurant dressings I'm accustomed to and love.

Not sure where I went wrong, but this just did not meet my expectations.  It was lacking in flavor, even after I played a bit with the seasoning. I also gave it time to "blend" by leaving it overnight with high hopes...I ended up tossing the left overs since after sitting it became a bit watery. My husband said if was "good," but it just wasn't my taste...sorry.

Most Japanese restaurants I've tried out seem to have their own version of this dressing.  Some are great while others are not so much.  So, I thought I'd give this recipe a try.  It was my first time making any dressing.  I have to say that this particular recipe is pretty good with a couple changes.  I put in half the amount of onions called for, added 1 1/2 carrots, and a little extra sugar.  I also let it sit overnight in the fridge as it didn't taste so great warm.  After chilling overnight, it has a wonderful flavor and I can't wait to serve it to guests in the future.  Thanks for posting your recipe!

This a very one-dimensional dressing as is and the consistency was a little too watery (and this is w/o adding the water). But once I added a few tbls. of sesame oil, tbl. of siracha (hot chili sauce) and a 1/4 cup of mayo, it was much, much better. 
Poured it over crisp iceberg lettuce, sliced tomatoes and mung beans. Next time I'll add some slice mushrooms to the salad mix. Great accompaniment to any sort of Japanese food, from tempura to grilled flank steak to homemade sushi.

This was fantastic Marbalet!!!!!! Due to peanut allergies I used canola and added just a smidge of sesame oil in the mix. Thank you so much!

I was a little disappointed with this recipe. It was way too acidic and I even used less vinegar and a little more peanut oil and sugar. However, the flavor combo was really close to the dressing at our favorite Japanese steakhouse. It should have more of a fruity taste and be creamier. Like maybe a touch of mandarine orange. Next time I make it I will start with a tiny amount of vinager and add to taste and maybe add some salad dressing(Miracle whip). Following another review, I also quartered an apple and let it mingle overnight.

The first time I made it, it had a strong vinager taste. After I let it sit and some of the oil and vinager settled into the bottom... it tasted better. 
I find that this recipe tastes better if it is allowed to sit for a few hours before serving. Regardless it satisfied the craving I had for a Japanese dressing without having to go out to eat or waiting forever and a day. This is really good and taste so much like the Japanese dressings I have grown to love!

It's good.  It's close to the Japanese Restaurant-Style Salad Dressing I am use to.  It needs some adjustment.  There has got to be some secret ingredient(s) I am missing.  It's sweeter, and less salty.  I may try some "salad supreme" (which BTW is the secret ingredient to awesome pasta salad), and substitute tomato paste for the ketchup.   Maybe use some miso paste, that would make more sense then ketchup.  Ketchup just doesn't seem right.  I've never been to a Japanese restaurant where you can get ketchup.

Definitely the closest recipe that I've tasted to the real steakhouse stuff, but I thought that the taste was slightly bitter. I used all fresh ingredients, and (after reading some reviews) I'm wondering if the ketchup had something to do with the slightly-off flavor. It's not so off that I wouldn't make it again, but I think I'd try with fresh tomatoes instead :)

I eat Japanese food like there won't be any tomorrow.  my favorite thing is the ginger dressing you get in the restaurant, hence why i looked up this recipe and it was honestly better than some restaurant's dressing. I did make a good amount of changes, following others i use only 1/4 cup of onions and 1/4cup of distilled vinegar.  I also use olive oil instead of peanut oil, pre-minced garlic, and low sodium soy sauce.  I make this almost every week for lunch and dinner salads!

I did not put all the vinegar, since too much leaves a funny aftertaste, salt and pepper are not needed, used half a fresh tomato instead of ketchup, a little extra honey/brown sugar, decreased amt of oil, added some sesame oil, threw in some carrots and extra ginger- after the modifications, it taste EXACTLY like that found in restaurants, excellent recipe!

Nothing like any of the Japanese restaurants' ginger dressing I have ever tasted.  I have eaten Japanese from coast to coast both in restuarants (whole-in-the wall mom&pops and national chain) and with Japanese friends at home.

Sharp and crisp dressing is perfect for salads without tomatoes, mushrooms, etc. Ease off the vinegar a bit, though. Save time and skip the fine chopping...it gets blended smooth anyway.

I have to admit that this is not the best salad dressing I've ever tasted. I don't frequent Japanese restaurants very often so perhaps I'm not the best person to judge this recipe. I do know, however, that my family left the salad untouched at dinner the other night!

Very good recipe.  I made a half recipe for our small family.  Like many reviewers I added some sesame seed oil for more asian taste.  I agree with the reviewer who said to use fresh ingredients - not canned, dried, powdered, etc.  I regret putting in the ketchup.  It tasted much fresher without it.  I tasted it before realizing I forgot to put it in.  Next time I will use a little fresh tomato instead, or just skip it.  I also added some grated carrot for extra texture but it was not needed.   I threw in chunks of the onion and celery and used the small  cup of the magic blender.  BTW, if you are making a full recipe, use the larger cup.

I love this dressing. I decide to try this recipe for a cold noodle salad (soba buckwheat) with julienne cabbage and cucumbers. There is a Restaurant here in JAX that serve it and I love it. With this dressing it get better than the restaurant. Fantastic.

I was so excited to make this recipe because my famliy loves the dressing at our local Japanese steak house.  Unfortunately, this didn't taste a thing like it... I had read the reviews and had such high hopes.  My daughter actually asked if it was a modified ceasar dressing.  It was kind of a pain to make because it had so many ingredients and they required chopping.  I guess I will keep looking "the real" Japanese dressing : (

After reading the reviews I tweak this recipe just a little . Used 3 cherry tomatoes and 1tbsp of ketchup. 1/4c of both peanut oil and sesame oil to create the 1/2c of oil. As suggested by others I used less onion.
My family loved this recipe.

This was good and my husband enjoyed it. I didn't have rice wine vinegar so I used some from my green olives jar! I also used crushed roasted peanuts instead of the oil and substituted the oil with sesame oil. I also used dry celery because I didn't have any fresh on hand. Defintely needs the sweetener. I used honey. Thanks!

This recipe is wonderful! I've always wondered how I can make the same salad dressing that I eat when I go to a sushi restaurant.! What's even better, is that it is super easy to make! Just toss in the ingredients whole, and you don't spend time mincing or chopping. Love the texture to the dressing!

I loved this recipe.  I did overdo the onion a bit by failing to measure and used olive oil instead of peanut as it was all I had on hand... and tit was still delicious.  This is a wonderful, fresh-tasting dressing.  I will make it again and again.

The flavor is just like that famous Japanese restaurant, Benihana! The only thing that's a little off is the texture. It's a little thin so next time I'd leave out the water and maybe cut down the oil to 1/4 C. Otherwise it's perfect. I look forward to trying this again tomorrow after the flavors have blended in the fridge.

This is great and actually better than the Benihana's now.  We think they switched to a pre-made dressing, it's awful.  Last time we went nobody even ate their salad.   Tonight EVERYONE ate their salad and my youngest son slurrppppeedd the bowl! I like this one and all of my salad dressings very fresh.  Make it and use it right away and all of the flavors are still bright and not muddled.

Wonderful !  Our new favorite salad dressing... keep this recipe and laminate it !!    I added a small carrot to give a bit more texture...  you could probably do anything you want to the basic recipe and never ruin it.

Dressing was very good.  Pretty close to what I get in the restaurant but missing something.  I added 1/2 a grated and then minced carrot.  Didn't put that in the blender (you probably could).  Also a little bit of sesame oil may have been good too at the end.

The taste and smell of raw onion was overpowering.  I don't recall any Japanese restaurant using a salad dressing this strong.  We ate is just once and didn't use the rest.

This was very close to the salad dressing we used to serve in a Japanese restaurant I used to work at.  I didn't have peanut oil, but instead used sesame oil. With that exception, I followed the recipe to the T.  Very delicious, easy to make and fresh ginger, I think, is the key.  Next time I will follow someone else's suggestion of added chopped carrots!  My husband absolutely loved it, so I will give it 4 stars!

I love this recipe! I decreased the amount of onion that it calls for because it's just way too strong. My family loves it and our dinner guests always ask for the recipe. It's almost as good as the restaurant dressing.

It was too vinegary and I could taste the ketchup. It didn’t taste like Asian salad dressings that I’ve made before from different recipes.   No I would not make this again.

My wife and I love this kind of dressing on our salads whenever we go to Thai or Japanese restaurants, which is why we were excited to try this recipe out. I made a few modifications because we prefer the nuttier version of this dressing that we’ve had at restaurants by us. 

-Cut the vinegar back to 1/4 cup instead of 1/3
-Completely cut out the ketchup
-Added 1/2 cup of creamy peanut butter
-Added one extra teaspoon of white sugar
-Added one more tablespoon of ginger paste

I didn’t use fresh ginger root, but the ginger paste you can buy in the cold case of the grocery section.

This recipe does need some tweaking, but it really is a winner! I have omitted salt, ketchup, honey, celery and water altogether because they are unnecessary. I used the white part of the green onion because it is milder than regular onion. Go easy on the ginger,  a little goes a long way! Do not add salt! You will get plenty of salt content from the miso and sauces. The sweetness will come from the carrot and ginger. Mine came out a nice golden yellow color. Here is my version if you want to give it a try. Just combine all the following ingredients to your food processor until well blended and then refrigerate overnight:

1/2 c. green onion (white part only) - 1 bunch yields appx. 1/4 c.
2 cloves garlic 
2 carrots
Juice of one lemon
1 T. Gari - Japanese pickled ginger
1. T. Tahini - Ground sesame seed paste
2 T. miso soybean paste
2 t. fish sauce
2 t. Ponzu soy sauce - Soy sauce with citrus
1/2 c. peanut oil
1/3 c. rice vinegar
12 turns of pepper mill

Outstanding and simple recipe.  Excellent without modification, perfect if you add just a little shredded carrot in order to give it some extra sugar and texture.

Don't expect miracles with dry, powdered or jarred substitutions.  Fresh ginger, fresh garlic and fresh veggies are a must for this.  I've made it with peanut, olive and avocado oil (depending on what I had in the cupboard) and it came out great each time.  If you do add sesame oil, go light, it's very strongly flavored and anything more than a fractional teaspoon is going to overpower the other flavors.

It's pretty close to the classic Japanese restaurant dressing, I found that it was too heavy on the vinegar, and not as creamy as what I've had at restaurants. But after I added bit of mayonnaise and some more sugar, it was pretty good.

Although it was delicious, it was too peanuty.  In my opinion it didn't really taste like what I think the real dressing tastes like.

I was a bit skeptical, but this was exactly what I was looking for. It's a bit heavy on the peanut flavor for me, so I think next time I'll do half peanut half canola oil to tone it down a bit, but I'm incredibly excited about this one! :)

This was amazing! Being preggo I get the craziest cravings sometimes. Well tonight i NEEDED to have a salad like the one we get when we go out for Thai or Sushi. Well, I looooved this!! 

Hubby loved it too!! We had a great big salad with some Asian baked chicken that I made. He was blown away!! For sure a keeper! Glad there was plenty left over so that I can keep it in the fridge for the next time...tomorrow maybe?? Delish!

Great recipe! Guys.... Don't be hesitant to eat "raw" tofu, it's superb! But if you still don't want to try it, boil it in water and cool it.  Stir frying ruins the taste and what this salad is meant to be.  It's not like eating raw meat(YUK)

I'm giving this 5 stars because while it might not be the "exact" same dressing, it's a close copy and goodness, it's deeeeee-lish!  I make a double batch (14 servings) and store it in the frig in a Good Seasons cruet.  It's keeps for at least a week....maybe more but it doesn't last that long in this house.

Absolutely delicious! The only change I made was to use 1/2 peanut oil and 1/2 sesame oil.  I love the flavors and the longer it sits, the better it tastes.  Next time, I'll leave out the salt and black pepper, I don't think it added anything to the dish and soy sauce makes the dressing salty enough for our tastes.  Thanks for the recipe!

I really liked this recipe, pretty close to the Japanese Restaurant style.  I did make a few changes to use what I had so I didn't have to go to the store, and to make it Gluten Free.  I made a half batch, used a combo of sesame and olive oil instead of peanut oil (tastes great but the sesame is strong so go lighter on it), I added a whole carrot instead of the celery, and used lime juice instead of lemon, also used Gluten Free soy sauce and doubled the ginger (the piece I had wasn't very strong).  Turned out delicious.

If you are like me you are in search of that great salad dressing served in Japanese restaurants.
This is NOT it.  Sorry.  I am so disappointed.
This is a good recipe just not THE ONE. 
I'll keep trying.

This recipe is great! I loved the dressing they served at the Japanese restaurants and was really excited to try this. Instead of white sugar, I used 1 tablespoon of honey. Also, I added a touch of sesame oil and blended one carrot into the dressing for that gritty texture. One more thing: I added a bit more water to it so it wouldn't be so biting. It turned out great!

This was a very tasty and easy recipe. I prepared everything in a food processor. I did use a few substitutions. I used canola oil instead of peanut oil and apple cider vinegar in place of rice wine vinegar. I also added a little extra ketchup to give it a slightly brighter color and extra tomato flavor (this is what we are used to from our local Hibachi Steak House). This recipe is a keeper.

This isn't as close as I'd hoped; there seems to be too much liquid - especially the oil and vinegar.  It's much more tangy than the dressing at our sushi restaurant.

I don't know who "Marbalet" is, but I've just realized that I have more than a few of Marbalet's recipes stored in my Recipe Inbox...

This recipe is excellent.  I followed the recipe precisely and the result is a mild, complex but subtle blend of flavors that go exceptionally well with leafy lettuce salads.  I will definitely make this whenever I have fresh ginger on hand.

I used shallots and omitted the celery, but otherwise made recipe exactly.  It was pretty good, but not exactly like my favorite Japanese restaurant.  It almost had a little to much ginger for me, but that could have been my heavy hand... I'm letting it sit in the fridge to re-try tonight.. that might help.

This was awesome.  I used vegetable oil since I didn't have peanut oil, but I thought it was great.  My favorite dressing from the sushi restaurant I like seems to have more "stuff" in it.  I would like to figure out how to get that, but I can't complain about the taste.  It is spot-on!

Not exactly like the salad dressing I've had at numerous Japanese restaurants, although it is very close. It is more tangy and not as gingery, so perhaps reducing the rice wine vinegar and increase the ginger. Perhaps a little bit more sugar as well. Overall it is very good and will definitely make it again with some tweaks mentioned.

This is SO good. Sure its not an EXACT replica of the restaurant's dressing but that doesnt mean it isnt totally delicious!  The changes I made: a little less onion, sub one tablespoon siracha instead of the second tablespoon of ketchup, a few extra teaspoons of sugar, some extra grated carrot and I used veg oil with a dash of sesame oil because I never use peanut oil.

Too friggin' good! This is my staple salad dressing. I love the ginger dressing you get at Japanese restuarants and I'm glad I found this recipe - it is exactly what I was looking for. I didn't throw in the celery or ketchup (had none) and it was still amazing.

This recipe is good if you like onion. I am not a big onion fan, so I made some changes (and my husband told me this is as close as it can get to restaurant style) So instead of 1/2 cup of onion I put 1/4 cup of shallots and 1/4 cup of carrot. Plus instead of 2 tablespoons of ginger I put 4 tablespoons. The rest is the same. Came out great!

I have been looking for a Japanese salad dressing since I went to the local Japanese restaurant. It has a distant taste store bought dressing can offer. When I found this recipe and read the review, I knew I had to try it out.  I follow the recipe everything it says except the peanut oil. I use canola oil since I never buy peanut oil for cooking. It turned out just like the salad dressing I remember.  Now, the search is OVER. Thank you for this easy and wonderful recipe.

This tasted exactly the way I expected it to...excellent! None of the ingredients are overpowering and blend together beautifully. My family loves the salad that comes with most Japanese restaurant meals and this dressing allows me to make it at home anytime we have a craving for it. I may add one more teaspoon of sugar next time just for personal preference. Thanks for submitting this wonderful recipe! :)

This recipe gets 4 stars, because it gave me the ingredients I needed to recreate my favorite dressing.  The measurements, on the other hand were way off for me.  Way too much vinegar!  I used half soy sauce and half fish sauce.  Buy the authentic (from the asian market) peanut oil, instead of the grocery store version.  This is a wonderfully refreshing dressing!

This was great. I used grapeseed oil because that is what I have. I did not add water or catsup. I added more celery and carrots to equal the celery. I also added a splash of toasted sesame oil. I made it in a food processor not a blender, and didn't really chop the ingredients first. We really enjoyed it.

very good, but I prefer using a grated or chopped piece of CARROT instead of the celery. This is the way my favorite place makes it.

I was craving the salad dressing from my favorite Japanese steakhouse, and this looked like a match.  It was good, but not quite there.  I think next time I need to add a little salt, and I could taste the ketchup so maybe that should be decreased just a tad.  I think it would lack something if the ketchup was left out completely.  It helped my craving, and is a great starter recipe.  Thanks.

Really nice dressing! I tried it tonight on salmon and it was lovely. I'll redo it for sure and do tweaking on the soya sauce quantity, trying for a bit less while adding a bit more rice vinegar and tomato sauce. Highly recommended.

This is very close to the dressing at my favorite hibachi restaurant.  The only change that I made was that I added 2 tablespoons of Miracle Whip so that it was a little creamier.  I also will probably use a little less vinegar next time, maybe 1/4 cup instead.

Sooooo good!! I love this dressing. For something different, tonight I took some of the dressing and whisked it with light mayo. I then tossed it with chow mein noodles(cooked, then rinsed w/ cold water), chopped cukes and baby carrots and served it chilled. I think this may be a summer staple!!

5 Stars without question. This recipe was exquisite! Always wondered how the restaurants made this dressing. This is just like the hibachi salad at Japanese restaurants. Will definitely make this from now on and recommend it to everyone. Thank you for posting this!

just like the dressing in the japanese restaurant. so good! One down side is that after eating this your breath will smell really bad because of the onions. So my suggestion is that after finished making the dressing, put it in the fridge for a few days then the smell won't be so strong.

* I would add less onions though

Great combination of ingredients for a tangy dressing. I customized this recipe to accomodate my husband's SouthBeach diet (used 3 packets of Splenda instead of the sugar). For my low sodium diet, I eliminated the salt. Because I am not a Ketchup fan, I substituted Chili Sauce. It tasted good, but the consistency was not as thick as I was in the mood for. I wanted something a bit more like Thousand Island Dressing texture. So I added about 3 spoonfuls of Best Foods Mayonaisse. I loved the results. I ended up with a jam jar full of some great dressing which I anticipate will keep in the refrigerator for a few weeks.

Well, I followed recipe to the T...however, it tasted nothing like our local Japanese restaurant dressing. It may be good to some m, and I’m not downing the recipe at all, but it’s not for us.

Great tasting recipe. More or less followed the recipe. Added slightly more ginger and black pepper at the end.

Substituted fresh tomato for ketchup.

Not a well thought out recipe. There is absolutely no reason to waste your time "mincing" all your ingredients before you "puree" them in a blender. A simple chop would suffice and make this recipe far more efficient.

Very similar taste, but WHOO! Next time I will cut WAY BACK on the rice vinegar, as it is a very pungent ingredient. Has great potential, just needs a bit of tweaking to get just right.

Verry good.  Try straining half of the mixture after blending and add half the onions.  I like it to sit in the fridge with shredded carrots before using( 1 hour )

Don't pay attention to the other reviews who complain about this recipe because this recipe tastes excellent and is definitely spot on. It tastes exactly like jasmine's.  Will definitely make again.

Awesome, love it. This is the exact Japanese restaurant dressing I was looking for to make eating a green salad a little easier.

This might not be for everyone but I love the freshness of the garlic, onion, and ginger over a simple salad as a side to an asian inspired meal.

Excellent.  My wife and I loved it.  Just make sure not to blend it too long so that it has a thicker consistency.  Rookie mistake!

unfortunately i agree with DA174, this had too much onion.. like SVPORTER, i swapped out half the peanut oil for homemade broth.. i should have also swapped out half of the half of peanut oil with sesame b/c i ended up adding sesame oil to try to get the taste right.. i think this would be a good marinade.. but it's just okay on bok choy cole slaw.. bf suggested cilantro to brighten it.. sadly we're all out

Very close to the dressing from our local Japanese restaurant. Next time I'll reduce the soy sauce by at least half. I added juice of an orange and 1 tbsp maple syrup (Canadian!)

Very good recipe and highly recommended!  Definitely use a blender. I used the "Bullet" and it liquified the dressing. Thus, made it soupy. Also, I added 2 tablespoon  of sugar and it came out very close to our local Japanese restaurant.  Next time, I will add an orange instead.

very good, really close to the local japaneese steakhouse, i did end up making some changes in the end, mirin instead of rice vineger, and about five times as much ginger 11 tbs to get it closer to the color and taste, and three times as much lemon juice

I followed the receipt exactly but I didn't have any peanut oil. So I added a tablespoon of peanut butter and used a quarter cup olive oil.  I'm glad I used the peanut butter because I think I would have missed the peanut flavor without the peanut oil.  I will defiantly make this again and I will buy some peanut oil so that I can make it as stated.

This was great! It makes a lot more than I needed but it was nice to have extra! It is a little strong on ginger so I would start with less ginger and add more if necessary!

This wasn't anywhere close to the salad dressing I am used to getting in a Japanese restaurant. I made it twice to make sure I did it right. I had to dump it both times.

It was very good but I wish it had been just a touch sweeter. Next time I will add a bit more sugar. Also, used sesame oil because I had it on hand and I think it made the flavor more authentic like a Japanese steakhouse might be. I will make this again. It took a minute to prepare but was not difficult.

Very very good. I took one reviewers advice and grated a carrot and that was the finishing touch it needed. I only had rice vinegar not rice wine vinegar. I wanted to have 2 salads in a row!

I didn't have any ketchup so I used 1.5 Tbsp of tomato paste. Next time I might add a little less rice wine vinegar to make it less tart. Just my preference. All in all this is a really great tasting, quick and easy recipe.

I love this recipe and have made it twice now.  I have yet to find other homemade recipes that beat the jar brands as of yet.  The only ginger dressing I like better than this one is the one our favorite Japanese restaurant makes.

I am in love with this dressing! It makes me want to lick the sides of the bowl clean, however I found this recipe had too much ginger in it. I did skip the celery step because I didn't have any on hand so that may affect the spiciness of the ginger, but I know that the next time i make it i will only use one tablespoon of ginger.

I love this dressing!  What a wonderful blend of ingredients.  I didn't have peanut oil, so followed another reviewer's suggestion to use 1/2 olive oil and 1/2 sesame oil.  I also used a full stalk of celery, and 1 carrot.  Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly.  I will definitely make this over and over!  Thanks for sharing.

I thought this was better than my sushi restaurant serves; so fresh tasting.  I made a few changes based on other reviews.  I used only 1/4 C. oil, used olive because I didn't have peanut oil.  Used only 2 Tbs. onion. Added a pinch of ground celery seed and added 1/4 tsp. sesame oil.  I mixed it with my immersion blender.  I also used low sodium soy and did not add any additional salt. I'm sure I will make this frequently!

I loved this dressing as is but with the following changes it became a 5 star recipe: I added 1 TBS sesame oil; used low sodium Tamari in place of the soy sauce and did not add any salt; added 1/4 cup shredded carrot; used 1 small tomato and 1/4 tsp tomato paste in place of ketchup. I did not add any water as the dressing was quite fluid - it did not need water. Next time I think I will reduce the white onion and add some green onion.

We made this exactly as listed, and the onion flavor was very powerful. The rice wine vinegar was a little too prominent as well. I think if we reduce the onion and increase the celery and add a bit more sugar then it will be great. Great place to start and easy to adjust since it's a simple recipe. I also agree that there is no reason the mince the ingredients (just cut small enough for measurement, the blender will take care of the rest). We used a white onion and all fresh ingredients.

EXACTLY what I was looking for!  No tweaking required on my part whatsoever.  I followed this recipe to a T, and it was seriously close to my favorite restaurant version!  Just as the recipe stated, I did mince the onion and celery for measuring purposes prior to blending.  We will be keeping this one!

This is a great recipe. Be careful about the onion you use. If you use
a regular white or yellow onion that is hot, it will make or break the
taste of this dressing. Raw onions that are hot will throw a bitter
taste. I make sure I taste the onion first before using it. Try Walla
Walla or Vidalia onions when in season. If not available try green onion
white part only or a leek.

Great flavor, easy. We served it with angel hair pasta, shrimp and salad on top. Husband LOVED it. I will use vidalia onion next time, yellow onion is too acidic for me. However, this was truly delicious.

I absolutely loved this recipe. Followed it nearly to the letter except I left out the Lemon juice as I didn't have any and I used a sweetener substitute instead of sugar (Splenda).  This tasted pretty much identical to the dressing I get at my favorite Japanese restaurant.  I did as others here suggested and didn't chop up anything, just let my food processor take care of it, but I did mince the ginger root so that I was certain it would incorporate well.  My picky husband went crazy for it...great recipe :)

I've made this recipe as is and it's delicious! I do make changes to it now to try to make it a little healthier for us. Light flavor olive oil instead of peanut, honey instead of sugar, tamari soy sauce. 
Also this last time I made it, I didn't have a few items so had to make more changes.
I used white wine vinegar instead of rice. I also just added more vinegar instead of adding water.
Celery seed instead of celery.
And I used a red onion instead of a white. I think this really helped w/ the flavor some to make it less oniony

Tweaked the recipe based on other folks recommendations. Instead of peanut oil did sesame and olive oil mixed, and instead of celery I did carrots. It tasted great fresh, but after an evening in the fridge it tasted JUST like what you get at the restaurants!

If you make the changes that I did, it drops to 0 points plus per serving and maintains the same yummy flavor. As is, it's 2 points plus. I used a whole stick of celery, a packet of stevia instead of 2 tsp of sugar, Walden farms calorie free ketchup, and cut the oil to 1 T. I know, I changed it up quite a bit... I added 3 baby carrots for more orange color and crunch. Use quality soy sauce. Kikkoman Organic is my favorite. If you use Best Choice soy sauce, it is weird and gross. I like it on butter lettuce with sliced mushrooms.

This recipe is great but I am only giving it 4 stars because I do not agree that it is like the Japanese Restaurant's salad dressing.  To me, it was more like the sauce that is given at the hibachi to dip beef and veggies in (which I love - but it is not the same as the salad dressing).  I followed the recipe exactly, except I did not have fresh ginger and had to substitute ground ginger. Was good on my salad, but I used the leftover dressing the next night to marinate steaks - and they were AMAZING!  Just added a little Worcestershire sauce, let the steaks marinate for a few hours in the fridge, and then grilled them.

Its a great base to start with, for an amazing dressing!..
I followed everything for the most part, I used more fresh ginger root then called for, I had to use olive oil instead of peanut oil since I didn't have any. I didn't put any salt in mine, as I thought the soya sauce would be salty enough.
I also added two chopped baby carrots, and appox 2 teasespoons of brown sugar, as I found the vinegar was over powering.

yay! my sisters and I have been on a mission for a dressing like our fav sushi place for months, without any luck. I finally resolved myself that my only chance was to make it. This is almost identical to that dressing. SO good! Only made 2 changes and 1 was an accident. I forgot to get peanut oil so I used olive oil with a handful of crushed peanuts instead (it worked!). And I added an extra tb of ginger. yum!!!! thank you

This recipe is just what I was looking for - tastes just like the name implies - the delicious dressing you get before sushi.  It's like a light 1,000 Island and it's best on day 2 - the onion and garlic mellow a bit.  Also, I didn't bother with the sugar and it wasn't missed.

This is almost exactly like the Japanese restaurant salad dressing. I made a few adjustments though. When I made it I used about 2 tablespoons of fresh minced tomato (without seeds) instead of ketchup. I also included 1/2 capful of fishsauce. Next time I might just use the fish sauce instead of soy sauce. At first the consistency was very runny, and tasted a little flat. So I strained it a little bit, discarding about 1/3 - 1/2 cup of liquid. This fixed both the flavor and the consistency. I think it brought out the flavor of the spices a little bit more.

Almost perfect.  It seemed a like it had a bit too much vinegar and more runny than restaurants serve so I added 1/4 cup may to it and it made it a little creamier. Then it was perfect.  Great Recipe!!!

I absolutely love this dressing. The amount of onion makes the dressing a bit "spicy" but I also think it gives it a good tangy flavor that goes well with the rice vinegar. Also, I really do not like the flavor of peanut or celery so instead of using peanut oil I used lighter flavor olive oil and instead of celery I used the same amount of carrots. Overall I think it turned out delicious and I cannot stop eating it when I make it! After sitting in the fridge it separates a bit because of the oil but still tastes just as delicious...then again I have only had it around long enough to last about 2-3 days its that good!

My son has been bugging me to make the dressing that we are served at Japanese restaurants.  I found this and it is SO close!  He went crazy for it. I sprinkled a few sesame seeds when serving for a bit of crunch.

Awesome recipe!! Just the flavor I was looking for. Very similar to my favorite restaurant's recipe! I used olive oil instead of peanut because that's what I had. I also didn't add celery because i didn't have any, but it still turned out GREAT.  Will make again and again. Husband said it was "on point", lol.

This dressing has a lot of great flavors in it that work well together...was only making a small amount and didn't want to pull out the blender, so just used onion powder, ground ginger, and skipped the celery.  Quickly mixed the rest of the ingredients with a whisk and tossed with red leaf lettuce, grated carrot, and bean sprouts.

Overall, this was a tasty dressing. It doesn't get 5 stars because I was expecting this to taste like the "famous" Japanese restaurant dressing. It comes close to the taste but it has a little zing that I haven't tasted in the restaurant dressing. Thanks for sharing the recipe.

AMAZING!!  This tasted just like the dressing at my favorite restaurant!  I was looking for a creamy dressing.. but this is healthier and just as tasty!  I accidently put too much soy sauce, so compensated with a little extra sugar to cut the saltiness. I highly recommend this recipe!!

I really liked this recipe - I did substitute sugar for honey. I believe that it enhanced the flavors. I didn't have peanut oil, so I used canola. I will buy peanut oil to see if there is difference, but I thought it was still delicious.   I don't normally measure ingredients, but with this one - it is more complicated and I would recommend measuring. At least until you make it a couple times.

I've made this twice now and I can't seem to get rid of the bitter aftertaste that it has.  The dressing tastes great at first and then this strange bitter flavor takes over.  Still trying to correct it because I really like it and want it to work for me.

This was fantastic.  Tasted exactly like you would get in a Japanese restaurant.  There was a lot of prep and ingredients but it wasn't that bad with a chopper and since you are putting it in a blender it didn't have to be precise.  I will be making this again.

This is a staple in our house. We moved away from our favorite Japanese Steak House and my husband and I decided to try to duplicate their recipes at home. This was a good start! I have tampered with the original recipe for personal preferences, but it is so close to the one we remember! Thank you for submitting this!!!

I think 1/2 cup onions is far too overpowering.  I added some carrots like one person suggested and even incrased the sugar trying to tweak the onion flavor away.  Im now on a mission to get some of this dressing from a real restaurant and compare or even ask them whats really in it.

This is it! OMG! I've been gooding to my favorite Hibatchi Grill specifically for this salad dressing when I get a craving.  Now I can make it at home anytime.  I gave this recipe 4 stars instead of 5 because I used sesame oil in place of the peanut oil and that gave the exact smell and flavor of the dressing I get at the restaurant  As soon as I poured it in and smelled it, I knew that was it.  My dressing is a little more runnier than I would have liked so I think I'll eliminate the water next time.  I skipped the salt and pepper and didn't bother with mincing anything.  Its not exact, but its a darn good substitute.  Maybe it needs more ginger???  I'm not sure but I'll definitely be playing around with this recipe some more.  I used all fresh ingredients and followed the recipe  with the exception of the sesame oil and ommitting the salt and pepper.  I also used rice vinegar because I couldn't find rice WINE vinegar. Thank you for posting this!

I thought this was pretty good. The rest of my family was pretty indifferent to it though. I used olive and sesame oil instead. And, I didn't mince or finely dice anyting, I just cut everything in bite size pieces for my blender and blended everything well.

It was tasty, but what I was looking for tasted simliar to this, but had a slight yogurt-ish flavor/texture. Actually, it kind of tastes more like those little yogurt drinks... Maybe I'll try adding that.

Although this was not like the typical Japanese restaurant's ginger dressing that I was looking for, it was still pretty good.  I agree with the reviewer below me that it may just need a bit more sugar to do the trick because all of the background flavors were there. I'll still make it again...but with a little more sugar.

This recipe was a big hit!  Not quite as good as my favorite Japanese restaurant, but very close.  I used 1TBS of powdered ginger and 1/4 cup of the onion and used vegetable oil.  I also waited to add the oil until last and poured through the top a little at a time to help emulsify it.  May need to add just a little more sugar to get it like my favorite restaurant.  Otherwise, a very good dressing.

This was exactly the flavor of dressing I was looking for.  It matches exactly to the Japanese restaurant quality dressing I am used to.  With a dressing this good, it really gives me an excuse to eat more salad.

We loved this dressing!  My husband said it was better than the dressing we have at our local Japanese place.  I made it exactly as directed.  It isn't as creamy as the dressing I'm used to but it was very flavorful and very good.
