This is really, really good!  So easy too.  I used drained canned black eyed peas, more ham than was called for.  (I had a bunch of leftover ham from the holidays) Added a few red pepper flakes and a healthy shake of Cajun seasoning.  Delicious and it is ready to just minutes.   Did I say this is a KEEPER?  Yes, it is!

EXCELLENT! I'm a vegetarian and have been trying to mix it up with new recipes that work for both my omnivore guy and me. This is a keeper! 

SUBS: I used veggie bac-un for the ham, I used brown rice vs. white, I used vegan vegetable stock vs water. 

ADDS: I doubled the amount of black eyed peas (3C), then added smoked paprika & turmeric (2T ea), and a pinch of liquid smoke to the seasonings; added 1/2 a large bag of frozen spinach (3C) to the mix when adding the peas.

WONDERFUL. SIMPLE. AWESOME.

i sauteed the onion, bell pepper, and garlic for about 5 mins to give the olive oil a little more flavor. i also added 1lb of italian mild sausage and cooked that with the diced ham. i then finished the dish as written and everyone loved it. thank you, andy s

I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out ok but it was really bland.   The peas had a really nice flavor before mixing in the rice, but they just got lost.  If I ever make it again, I will half the rice and perhaps double the ham.

It was delicious. However I thought 4 cups of rice was just too much for the amount of beans, therefore I did not add all of the rice. Next time I would increase the amount of beans. I would make this again!
