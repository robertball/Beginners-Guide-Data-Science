I make these bars every year for Christmas as they are awesome. I agree that the coconut is hard to spread without breaking the graham cracker crust, but have found a simple solution. As soon as you pull them out of the oven after baking the coconut, I use the flat side of a spoon, sprayed with cooking spray and smooth out the coconut. The coconut mix is now more pliable, now that it is hot. I finish recipe as follows. I even sometimes sprinkle a few slivered almonds on top top make them like Alomnd Joys.

Great! I did not add the sugar to the graham cracker crust. I always wonder why the extra sugar when there is already sugar in the graham crumbs. Anyway, it was plenty sweet enough. I also, as suggested by another reviewer, spread the coconut on thop of the hot crust and then poured the condensed milk on top of that and it worked perfectly.

These bars are delicious! My grandmother has been making them for years and they are a family favorite.  I would highly recommend substituting Hershey's chocolate bars for the choc. chips.  Not only do they add great flavor, but they create a smooth top on the bars.  Add 6 unwrapped bars after they come out of the oven.  The bars will naturally melt over the coconut/milk mixture.  You can then smooth it out over the top.  My mom recommends to score the bars with a sharp knife before they fully set up.  This way you can get nice clean slices.  Also, I love these bars chilled!

To fix the spreading problem others have mentioned. I put the coconut over the graham base and then poured the milk on top directly from the can. Wait a few mins and it is all mixed. I also added almonds on top and drizzled the chocolate.

Awesome bars!  I made them in a smaller pan so they would come out thicker.  I added 1 tsp. coconut extract to the S.C. milk to intensify the coconut flavor.  I also added 1 Tbsp. vegetable oil to the chocolate chips to make it easier to cut after they set.  Turned out great!

Easy, quick recipe that the family loved...I added about a tablespoon of vegetable oil to the chocolate chips and microwaved them to make cutting a bit easier later on.  Thanks Annie added this one to my recipe box.

The taste is way better than any mounds bar I've ever had but it need few changes. The coconut mixture just wasn't enough to spread out with out tearing up the crust so I doubled it but next time I will just increase it by another half. I melted the chips in a doubled boiler and it cooled to quick to spread well so I made another cup or so to cove it. It does sink down in to the coconut mixture. When it cooled it was hard and turned out a little on the thick side which made it hard to cut. next time I will stick with the original chocolate amount but I will and 1/3 of a bar of paraffin wax which will make it not only easier to spread but will keep it soft when you try to cut into bars. if you don't have wax I highly suggest you precut through the chocolate when it is half way cooled to allow you cut it when its fully cooled without you breaking any chocolate. I am not a fan of coconut (I don't even like Samoa's girl scout cookies) But this recipe is so good I had to immediately package up as my as I could to send to my sister in Iraq to stop from eating them. This is surely something I will take to work to impress.

I made these bars because some of the photos look so good, but my bars were thin and did not resemble the photos at all.  Now I've gone back to read the reviews of the photos I've admired to see that the bars were modified by baking in a smaller pan to get thicker bars and by increasing the coconut and/or chocolate layers.  As written, these bars are way too sweet, and I didn't even add the white sugar to the crust.  If I were to make them again, I would tone down the sweetness even more. I'd eliminate the white sugar, use unsweetened coconut, use more coconut (but not increase the sweetened condensed milk with it), and bake them in a smaller pan.  You really have to have a sweet tooth to like this recipe.

I'VE HAD THIS RECIPE FOR 30 YEARS, AND THE PROBLEM SPREADING THE COCONUT IS SOLVED BY HEATING THE CONDENSED MILK, THEN ADDING THE COCONUT TO THE MILK, RIGHT BEFORE SPREADING ON THE CRUST.  THEN JUST FOLLOW THE RECIPE AS IS.

Very rich & good.  Use more of the coconut mixture, less graham cracker.  I made the coconut smooth more easily by layering the coconut first, then slopping the milk over it.

Great! I added 2 2/3 cups of coconut and used milk chocolate chips because I think that taste much better than semi-sweet chocolate. If you have lumps in the chocolate it is either because you let it cool and you need to slightly re-heat or you over-heated it. I highly suggest using Hersheys milk chocolate in the form of either chocolate chips, or candy bars. I never had any problems spreading the coconut over the bottom layer. I can see where it would break, but try to pour the mixture all over as best as possible and not just in the center. Spread is gently and carefully. Best served cold or cool.

These are delicious but would have been too sweet for my family.  Didn't add sugar to the graham crackers and used a smaller bag of chocolate chips.  I solved the chocolate spredability issue!  When the bars come out of the oven (after the coconut layer) sprinkle the chips on to evenly, and put back in the oven (with it turned off) for a couple of minutes.  When you take it out, they spread beautifully and easily!  Also, one less bowl to clean!

To make this much faster:  Just use graham crackers right out of the box!  Lay them on the bottom of a 9x13 pan then follow the recipe as if that's your cooked base!  You may have to reduce the topping, or spread it over 2 cookie sheets of graham crackers, depends how dense you like them.

Got rave reviews!! I added more of the coconut mixture - it was about not quite doubled - I'd say more like one and a half to one and 3/4 of what the recipe called for. It completely covered the graham crust, no trouble spreading at all if you are gentle and have more topping to work with! I also used a cup of milk chocolate chips and a cop of semisweet, to get a better flavor balance (and because my dad refuses to eat SS chips) Scored the chocolate for easier cutting, too. But everyone loved it. My dad even requested that I add it to our annual Christmas Cookie List - very high praise indeed!!

These were pretty good, but like others have said, i prefer the 7layer magic cookie bars.  I almost doubled the amount of coconut and sweetened milk, and i think it was a good amount. I also just sprinkled the chocolate over the hot topping, placed back in the oven for 2 min, and then spread it out and it worked perfectly.

Recomend following changes.  Skip the sugar and freeze or refrigerate overnight the graham cracker crust.  Do not bake the crust before addition of coconut mixture. Mixture will spread smoothly over the chilled uncooked crust  Bake 20 minutes at 350 and place Hersey Bars over still hot mixture.  Spead after melted.

Excellent! To avoid the problem some had with spreading the coconut layer on top of the graham crackers I poured the coconut/sweetened condensed milk on, stuck it in the oven for a few minutes, pulled it back out and easily spread the warmed mixture around. I sprinkled sliced almonds on top of the chocolate. They are really, really tasty. Thanks! :)

YUM! I didn't even bother to mix the coconut & condensed milk- I just sprinkled the coconut over the crust and drizzled the milk over the top. As for the chocolate chips, if you sprinkle them on immediately after the bars come out of the oven, they will melt right on top and then you just spread them around.

I tried following the recipe to a T, thinking that other reviewers had said this and that and I could always do something different the second time. But it came out perfect, so there's nothing to change for me! one of the fastest, easiest and capturing treats you can ever do! I didn't even bother to mix coconut with condensed milk, but just spooned the coconut and the milk went straight over it from the can itself...

I halved the recipe and baked in an 8x8 square pan.  When putting the coconut mixture on the graham cracker crust, I sprayed a frosting knife with non-stick spray and then patted it until it spread across.  This is a very good, very rich, dessert that satisfied my coconut craving.  Thank you for sharing!

These are delicious, but the difficulty in making dropped the rating a bit. I  could barely make the graham cracker mix spread far enough for a 9x13, the same went for the chocolate. 

If I were to make these again, I'd either do a 8x8 pan and half the coconut mixture... or I'd double the graham cracker crust and the chocolate.

Love this recipe. These were quick and easy to make.  I used dark chocolate chips which gave them a rich chocolate taste. I will definately be making these again!

These are great!  They were a hit at the Coffeehouse Night I took them to.  Next time, I'd cook the crust for 10-12 minutes instead of 15.  I also poured the milk over the coconut in the pan and instead of melting the chocolate, I just sprinkled the chips over the hot coconut.  A few minutes later, I took a butter knife and spread the warm chips to make the top layer.

These are excellent with a little tweaking.  I did not mix the cracker crumbs, sugar and butter, but rather melted the butter (I used a bit more than called for) in the pan in the oven, omitted the sugar completely, and just sprinkled the crumbs on top of the melted butter, pressed it down a bit, then let it bake.  I almost doubled the coconut filling amount, using 3 1/2 cups of coconut (I chopped the flaked coconut in the processor to make it finer and more like real Mound Bars), sprinkled it atop the baked graham crust and poured 2 - 14 oz. cans of sweetened condensed milk over the coconut.  Of course, it took much longer to bake (about 25 minutes).  Once the filling set up, I just sprinkled the chocolate chips (tossed with about 1 1/2 Tbs. vegetable oil) evenly over it; put it back in the turned off oven and let the chips melt.  I then spread the melted chocolate over all with an offset spatula (quite easy).  I let it cool to room tempertature then refrigerated for about 2 hours before cutting into small bars (they cut very easily).  They are absolutely delicious, especially with a hot cup of espresso.

These are super good and really easy. I followed the reviews of some of the rewiewers and spread coconut over graham cracker base and then drizzled sweetened condensed milk over coconut. After baking the second time I turned oven off scattered chocolate chips over coconut and then put back in oven for a few minutes. Pulled it out of the oven and easily spread melted chocolate to smooth. I will make these a lot.

Sometimes you feel like a nut......sometimes you don't!  Oh my goodness this is a delicious recipe.  I made as written for half the pan and added some chopped almonds for the other half.  These bars were wonderful.  They cut nice and held their shape - a real + in my book.  I took this to a girls night out dinner and they loved them and took home all the leftovers.  Thanks Roseypet for this recipe.

My kids & I (they're 9 & 10) thought this was way too rich with all of the chocolate. We decided that next time we will use more coconut and just drizzle the chocolate over the top -- maybe use half of the recommended amount. We did follow the recommendation to put the coconut down and then pour the sweetened condensed milk on top, and that worked well.

Good, but very sweet.  I think it would have been better with only 1/2 the amount of chocolate, and just drizzling the chocolate on the top, with some of the coconut showing.  I followed the suggestion of other reviewers and first topped the crust with coconut, then poured the sweetened milk over that.

Needless to say, I love these ingredients but cutting sugar. This recipe is basically Magic Cookie Bars, made the hard way. Mixing coconut & sweetened condensed milk together & trying to spread it out, called for a way to make it easier to spread by one lady. No need, just do the layers: Melt butter in the pan in oven. No sugar is needed--GC crumbs already have sugar in them, so does flaked or shredded coconut & SC milk. Sprinkle graham crumbs over melted butter & press it out. You don't have to bake this crust separately either. Unless, you prefer it that way. My recipe's way, pours SC milk gently over whole crumb area--spreading a little,if needed. Add each remaining ingredient, pressing down on each layer, lightly to secure. I continue with this order: chocolate chips, coconut, & add nuts, if you like. MCB's call for nuts. Then bake, until golden, about 15-20 mins. The picture that is shown, with huge hunks of chocolate, would be too hard to eat & probably too rich, to suit me. If I made them that way, I would most likely cut into smaller squares or bars.

These are very tasty, but a little messy to make.  I think there is too much graham cracker crust for the recipe.  It's hard to spread the coconut mixture.  Instead of melting the chocolate chips, I sprinkled them over the top then stuck the pan back in the oven for a few minutes, spread them when I took the pan out.  To make cutting easier I put my entire pan in the freezer for about 30 minutes after it cooled, then cut into bars.  Much easier and neater.

I used fat-free condensed milk, which I have found works just as good! The reasons this recipes gets 4 instead of 5: You MUST put the coconut mixture on hot, otherwise it is a crumbly mess. I think next time I will try just spreading out the coconut & then pouring the milk on top of it. I also felt these were very good, but I agree with another review that there is too much graham cracker crust (and I love graham cracker crust!). You also need to do something to chocolate so it will cut easier later, like add a tbsp. of vegetable oil. They are tasty and I would make them again, but once a year is plenty. :)

These are good.  Very rich and not exactly like a mounds bar because of the graham cracker crust but delicious and easy.  Will definitely make again.

Oh no.   I LOVE LOVE LOVE Mounds and Almond Joy and this is not nearly as good.  The semi-sweet chocolate is a disaster- milk chocolate might help but I'm not willing to give it another shot.  Double crust might help too but the way they are- I did not care for these.  Sorry, I really wanted to like these.

These are delicious! I put the coconut on top of the crackers and then just poured the condensed milk over it, and it worked just fine. I also used Hershey bars for the top, but I wish I hadn't; the sweetness of the bars was a bit too much. Semisweet chocolate, as the recipe states, would probably have tasted better. Great recipe, thanks for sharing!

Everyone loved these, even though I didn't put enough butter in the crust and it all fell apart. I also left out the sugar and followed other reviews by pouring the condensed milk over the coconut and using chocolate bars on top. Popped them in the oven for 2 mins and the chocolate melted perfectly.

This is so yummy, but a bit hard to work with.  I used a whole package of coconut which was 2-2/3 cups and the milk covered it good.  I'm going to experiment with the chocolate part, I dropped choc chips on top of warm coconut and while it was warm everything was good.  But when it cooled the choc chips fell off.

I think it would be really tastey in theory but...the graham cracker crust, and the chocolate top, were twice as thick as the coconut center.  I followed the recipe exactly except used 1/2 bag of choc chips with a dolop of peanut butter added to keep the topping soft enough to cut.  Not enough coconut center for my taste.

These are awesome!! They are easy and simple and come out fantastic! I took the advice of another review and sprinkled the coconut over the crust and then poured the sweetened condensed milk over and with a spatula gently smooshed the coconut and milk together. Also, I just melted the chocolate in a bowl in the microwave and added a small amount of shortening and combined it into the chocolate. This way when the chocolate hardened, it was not brittle. So yummy and everyone really liked it! Thanks!

All I can say is WOW!  My husband wanted his Mom's Mounds bars - but after tasting these - he will never go back.  I added milk to the choc chips and microwaved them which cut down on time on an already quick and easy recipe! LOVED IT!

Honestly, I was pretty disappointed with the first round of this recipe. The crust was crumbly and never set properly. The coconut was impossible to spread, as was the chocolate. So here is how I did it on round two. I used no sugar and 1 cup of butter for 2 cups of graham crumbs. I sprinkled the coconut on top of the crust and then poured the condensed milk over that. I then sprinkled the chips on it and let it sit in the oven after I turned it off and then gently smoothed the top with a icing spatula. End of the day, this is a great concept for a recipe, but the directions as is are a little impractical.

Everyone loved them. I followed one a reviewer's advice and poured the milk over the coconut and added a tbsp. of oil to the chocolate chips to spread more easily. The only problem that I had was that the graham cracker crumbs on the very bottom were still crumbly and didn't hold. But I'll maybe add a little more butter next time. Great recipe overall.

So addicting! I halved the recipe and baked in my glass 1 1/2 qt dish. I followed recipe and did not add any sugar to the graham crumbs (you couldn't tell and it wasn't missed). I also, chopped some almonds and sprinkled over top the coconut mixture befor baking.  I had dark choc and white choc chips on hand, so used those to sprinkle over the bars.  very yummy and taste very close to the almond joy/mounds bars! :)  YUMMY!  I almost ate half the pan...

I'd give these 5 stars, but they weren't quite as PRETTY as I wanted them to be.  I lined a 9x9 glass pan with parchment paper, with edges extended, and patted the crust on top of the paper. Didn't use any sugar for the crust.  Baked at 350 for 20 minutes (I think that was my problem; I should have baked them longer).  Then I did what practically everyone else did and sprinkled the coconut on top of the hot base and drizzled the SCM on top of that.  Bake another 20 minutes (again, I think I should have left them in the oven a little longer).  I finely chopped up 12 ounces of 60% cacao bittersweet Ghiradelli bars, and scattered them over the top of the (very nicely browned) coconut top, put back in the oven for 1-1/2 minutes, then used an offset spatula to spread the chocolate around.  Easy peasy!  Let cool in the pan for 1/2 an hour, then lifted the paper out onto a rack to cool an hour.  The chocolate hadn't set up at all, so I refrigerated another hour, then cut into bars.  My problem at that point was that the crust kind of fell apart, and I don't think the coconut filling was quite done (it was pretty thick).  In spite of that, these were DELICIOUS, and I'd definitely make again.  Taking these to work tomorrow...we'll see how it goes.

Yum!  My husband loved these so much he said they were better than an actual Mounds bar!  This is a keeper - just make sure to use dark chocolate to stay true to the Mounds flavor.

This was a big hit with my family. My only problem with the recipe is that the crust was really crumbly. Next time, I'll add more butter.

I really like this recipe (as have all my roommates), but modified it, and will do so even more next time around. I would add more condensed milk and coconut, so that the coconut layer can be evenly spread over the crust. I added milk, because I did not have any more condensed milk, and that worked all right. I also added coconut rum (3 tbs each) to both the coconut filling and the chocolate topping. This made them both easier to spread and added to the flavor.

I will never make this again…I followed the recipe and you can’t spread the coconut concoction you have to use small spoonfuls and line them up because when you bake it, it evens out! My crust tasted burnt! They are not worth the trouble!

These are great! I still used a 9 by 13 pan. I omitted the sugar from the crust. I doubled the coconut and the condensed milk. The first time i made this i double the coconut but not the milk but some parts didn't hold too well. So now i used one can of sweetened and one can unsweetened. Like others suggest, its so much easier to just drizzle the milk over the coconut. I put the semisweet chips on top and popped it back into the oven for a couple minutes and spread it over the coconut. I topped with shaved almonds. My husbands co workers rave over this recipe. It's sweet but not too sweet.

Super amazing!!!!  If you don't have a double boiler than you can do what i did and after you take the bars out of the oven with the coconut on, then you can sprinkle the chips on top then put it in the oven (turn the oven off).  When they have been in there for a little bit I took them out and just spread the chips around.  These are like so amazing though make sure to make 2 batches because you will eat them up right away!!

These bars are fantastic! I added a bit of peanut butter to the crust mixture (about 2 TB) and a few TB of peanut butter to the melted chocolate mixture (this keeps it from hardening too quickly without having to add oil or shortening. It also gives a nice peanut butter flavor). After baking the crust, I let it cool and then refrigerated for 15 minutes. This prevented the crust from breaking up when I spread the coconut mixture on top. Also, the coconut mixture becomes very easy to spread after it has warmed a bit. I took the bars out of the oven and spread the coconut mixture more evenly over the crust and then continued baking. 

I made these for Easter, but my family has already devoured the first batch, so it looks like i'll be making some more!

sooooo freaking good! hubs took some to work and everyone flipped over them!
next time, i'd use a smaller pan to make bigger/thicker bars - other than that, definitely sprinkle coconut on top of crust and pour condensed milk on top of that! so much easier ;) added chocolate chips and baked for another 2 mins - placed them in the freezer for easier cutting! it's definitely in the dessert rotation!!

I love these. I wanted to bake but had no flour? Crazy.  These bars are very decadent - like eating a candy bar.  I didn't mix the coconut with the condensed milk. I did what other suggested and just put the coconut on and then poured the milk over it and baked. It all melds in the oven.  For the chocolate chips - I poured them on and popped the pan back in the oven for a minute or two and then spread the chocolate with a knife. I think next time I'm going to use milk chocolate instead of semi sweet. These are really good and really hit the spot for an afternoon sweet treat!

I followed the directions as stated however my graham cracker crust completly fell apart when I tried to spread the coconut mixture over it.  It seems the coconut was too thick to stand up to the crust. Very disappointing! I don't know what I did wrong.

This recipe is great!  I did follow some of the suggestions, by not adding so much sugar, and it's still very sweet.  Also, I place the chocolate bars (broken up) on top along with semi-sweet chips and stuck it back in the oven for about 3 minutes.  That way you do not have to dirty another bowl/container with melting all the chocolate.

Easy enough that my 2 year old loves to make these with me!  We usually use chocolate crackers.  Sprinkle the crust with the coconut and drizzle the milk over that.  Top with hershey bars.

These are very good.  Be sure to grease the pan or they will stick badly.  I used others advice and sprinkled the coconut over the crust then pour the milk on top.  This made it so easy.  I melted the chocolate in the microwave with 1 TBSP canola oil and it poured easily, and gave it a glossy look. I dont think it tasted like a mounds bar, because mounds dont have a crust, but they were still yummy!

We loved these. I used about 2 1/2 cups of coconut, spread that on the base and then poured the milk on top. Much easier that way. Thank you for the recipe.

These bars were a huge pain to make and didn't turn out. I did everything exactly like the directions explain. The coconut mixture does not spread well. The choc chips didn't melt well. I tried to melt them a bit more by adding some milk and heating on the stove and it turned into a giant hard ball of choc. It would not spread out so it's pretty much just lumped on in random spots. I won't make this again. It was for a friends birthday too.

Very good!  I Used milk chocolate chips instead of semi-sweet.  Tastes just like a mounds candy bar.

I made these for my dad for his birthday as he loves Mounds bars. I don't like coconut so this review is based on others' opinions. They loved them. I did use an 8x8 pan instead of a 9x13 pan and upped the baking time a bit. Otherwise I followed the recipe. I can't imagine using the specified amount of the coconut layer in a 9x13 pan. I had a hard enough time as it is spreading it in an 8x8 pan. Whatever the case, people loved them and I'll make them again :)

Great concept - what's not to love about graham crackers, coconut, and chocolate - but these just didn't work for me. The crust didn't have enough butter to really firm up, it was very crumbly. This made it hard to spread the very sticky filling. I also think milk chocolate would have made a better choice for the top layer. Again, the crust was so crumbly that the bars didn't cut neatly. I won't bother to make these again.

Not at all impressed with this one.  The comingling of coconut and graham crackers didn't get a good response at all.
I made them again, but this time I made brownies (instead of the graham crackers) as my base, topped it with the coconut mixture and chocolate topping, 
they were AWESOME!

We loved these!! I changed a few things after reading a few reviews though. I cut the crust ingredients in half, but kept the filling the same and used an 8x8 pan. So, I doubled the filling. It took a little longer to bake that way though. After they came out of the oven, I sprinkled choc. chips on it and put it back in the warm oven to melt them and then spread them around. We also couldn't wait until they cooled, so we put them in the freezer for about 20 minutes. Yummy!!

I cut the recipe in half and used and 8 x 8 glass dish.  Instead of mixing the coconut and milk, I just sprinkled the coconut on the graham cracker crust after baked.  Next I slowly poured the milk over the coconut.  The difficult part for me was the chocolate.  I don't know if I didn't have enough to pour/spread because I halved the recipe.  I ran short and couldn't spread the chocolate easily.  These were VERY SWEET!  I was craving chocolate and couldn't wait til they were completly cooled.  I just took a spoon and had a few bites!!  This would be very good with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.  By the way it DID hit the spot!

These were okay.  Obviously, they're not really like Mounds Bars--Mounds bars don't have the cookie crust/graham cracker crust component!--, but these were okay.  'Probably closer to Mounds Bars with just the chocolate-covered coconut combination, but for those just wanting a sweet, these are fine.

I absolutely love these bars and the fact that they were super easy to make was good too!! I make so many graham bases that I just winged that part. Some said they used sweetened coconut. Since there was sweetened condensed milk I figured that the recipe meant unsweetened coconut. Spreading the coconut layer slowly and by small dollops so as to not mess up the graham base worked perfectly. I melt d my chocolate chips in the microwave and added a little maragarine to thin it and make spreading easier.

Super easy and a crowd pleaser. I used dark chocolate instead of semi-sweet.  Next time I think I'd add a tad more butter to the graham cracker crumbs to bind it a bit more. And I think I would add more coconut flakes and sweetened condensed milk for a thicker middle layer.  Yum.

This got rave reviews! I used a whole small bag of sweetened coconut and almost 2 whole cans of sweetened condensed milk. I followed recommendation of others and immediately out of oven put on coconut and then spread milk over the coconut. I also used Hershey bars smooth side facing up but needed more than 6 bars for the whole 9x13... Maybe 8 or 9. Then put it back in the oven to melt the chocolate just for few mins. Kept it in fridge and used hot knife to cut the bars. Awesome!

Delicious!  My family loves these.  I used digestive biscuits for the crust because I happened to have some (that I didn't particularly like)  on hand.  Next time I'll omit the sugar from the crust -- I think that's a good idea, and I may use unsweetened coconut, to cut down on the sweetness.  I warmed the coconut-condensed milk mixture slightly in the microwave to make it more spreadable.  I added about 2 Tablespoons of butter to the chocolate, so it would be easier to cut once it cools.  Next time I'll use Land O Lakes canola oil butter, which will likely soften the chocolate even further.   I also used a pretty ceramic casserole dish that is about 8x12, as opposed to 9x13, so the bars are the perfect thickness.  I'll definitely make these again.  Yum!

Had some nice compliments on these - only had one tiny piece myself because I'm trying to shed a couple lbs.  I did put some almonds on top to make it look nice + a Tbls. oil in the chocolate chips. Will make again when I can test them out better.  ;)

Absolutely delicious!  And so easy to make.  I sprinted coconut on top of the crust and then poured the condensed milk over the top as suggested.  That worked perfectly.  I also sprinkled some sliced almonds on top for looks.  They are hard to resist.....a little dangerous to have in the house!

I made these for every special occasion.  They are quick to make and taste divine!  I made a few changes to save time and mess: I cut out the sugar completely as the condensed milk is sweet enough, I spread the condensed milk on first and then put the coconut on top, pushing it down a bit with a spatula. This way I didn't have to deal with the sticky mess of the milk and coconut and saved a bowl! :) Also I put a whole bag of chocolate chips on top after it comes out of the oven the second time and cover the whole thing with foil.  When its cooled down a bit, I use a spatula to even out the chocolate as it has now melted beautifully!  I've also tried this recipe with mint chocolate on top and it was also SO good! yum!  Thank you so much for posting this recipe...yum!!!

1. Sprinkle coconut evenly over baked cookie base then pour sweetened condensed milk evenly over top of that, no spreading required on that layer!
2. Sprinkle chocolate chips over baked coconut while it is still hot. Wait 5 min and then spread them with a knife.

Yummy treats made for giving away but I had to eat one, or two.  Okay maybe three.  These have a great flavor and are easy to make.  The crumb mixture maybe needs more butter to bind it better so it doesn't crumble as much.

I made these 2x. The first time I did follow the recipe for pan size, except I poured on the condensed milk & sprinkled the coconut on top & pressed in. I think it would be hard to spread mixture over the crust doing as directed. I also used mini chocolate chips as it covered more, there was barely anything to spread. The 2nd time I used 13 x 9 pan for a thicker cookie/candy. Baked the crust for 10 minutes, spread on the coconut,  I stuck in a handful of slivered almonds sort of on top & pressed in with spoon & baked 18 min. more. I liked the thickness in a 13 x 9 & they were delicious.  I spread 3/4 bag of a 12 oz. chocolate mini chips on top. You can easly used less when using mini chips, but I love my chocolate.....

These bars were amazing!! I made them to give to my mom and mother-in-law for Mother's Day since they are both big fans of coconut. I sampled one and made sure I left a few for hubby and I. I will definitely make them again!! But, I may not be sharing next time.

This was fantastic! I didn't have enough graham cracker crumbs so I used some crushed vanilla wafers and that had a wonderful, interesting taste. I also tried substituting the coconut for coconut marshmallows (which I melted in the microwave first and then mixed with the condensed milk) and that gave it a splendid gooey texture. Although it was hard to cut! Either way this is definitely one of my favorites

Excellent, used another reviewer idea to place unbroken hershey bars on top as soon as it came out of the over and it worked great. Probably not the cheapest way but looked the best

I doubled this and made the coconut mixture with 3 cans of sweetened condensed milk drizzled over 3 cups coconut between the two.  It was really good.  Next time it needs almonds since I'm more of an almond joy girl than mounds.  Super rich!

Yummy! Followed directions without crust and baked in 8x8 buttered glass pan in toaster oven at 325 for 12 minutes. When baked, placed whole almonds on half of mixture and spread dark chocolate chips over coconut.  Returned to oven for five minutes, removed and spread chocolate evenly over mixture.  Could not have been easier - or more delicious.

This was amazing.  Super tasty and so easy.  I had my boyfriend pick an item from my recipe box and this was it.  He made a fabulous pick. Like many of the suggestions, I put the coconut on the crust and poured the condensed milk over top.  Super easy.  I also put the the Hershey's chocolate bars on top after taking out and after they got all melty, just spread it around.  A total hit, every one loved them.  Thanks for the great recipe.

I want to give this a four star, but I didn't follow directions right... however I tried.  I started with the cracker crust, and added a bit more.  I doubled the coconut mixture because it barely covered the crust. Which lead me to double the chocolate because that too barely covered the coconut filling.  Everything turned out fine and the flavor is wonderful, but I would suggest NOT doubling the chocolate... it's too much and overbearing on taste.  Try to skim it over the coconut if you can... or perhaps just dot the choc chips over the coconut mixture and throw in oven for a bit.

These are FABULOUS! They are also super easy!! I had chocolate graham crackers so I used those instead of regular. I also added a little extra butter since the mixture seemed a little dry and crumbly. I will make these again!

They bars tasted good, but it was very difficult to spread the sweetened condensed milk and coconut over the graham cracker crust.  The coconut mixture wouldn't spread properly, and it kept pulling up the graham cracker crust.  I put them in the refrigerator to cool, but they were still difficult to cut.  They would be fine for eating at home, but I was making them to give in a cookie tin for Christmas---and for that, the presentation of the bars were not attractive.

I added vegetable oil to the chocolate and it was STILL hard as a rock.  Next time I'll just sprinkle the chocolate chips over the top, who cares if they form a solid layer of chocolate.  Very tasty though.

Great recipe!  I just took a bite of mine with a spoon because I couldn't wait for the to cool!  Excellent!  Next time I'll either increase the ingredients or make them in an 8x8 pan.  My bars aren't as thick as the ones in the pictures and I like mine thicker.  Can't wait to eat these tonight.

Great recipe.  Next time I'd like more coconut filling.  Also, save yourself a pot to wash: after baking the crust & coconut layer for 13 minutes, pull from oven & sprinkle the chocolate chips evenly on top.  Pop back in the oven for the remaining 2 minutes, then just spread the melted chocolate chips over top.  DO cut before it completely hardens, though.

Very nice bar cookie.  I made a couple of changes to make things easier.  I mix the graham cracker crumbs and sugar together.  I melted the butter in the 9 x 13 pan in the oven then sprinkle crumbs on top and lightly press.  I then sprinkled on the coconut and pour the sweetened condensed milk on top. Just makes clean up a little easier.  Will be making these again.

These tasted really good, but the coconut flavor was not pronounced enough for my taste.  The graham cracker crust and chocolate really overpowered it.  I will make these again, but will double the coconut filling.  I used the method of sprinkling the coconut on the baked crust and then just poured the milk over it, and that worked really well.

These were really good. I used milk chocolate chips that I melted with 1 tsp of shortening. This helped the chocolate be a little easier to cut when cool.  Also sprinkling the coconut on the crust then adding the sweetened condensed milk on top makes it much easier. I will for sure make these again. They were quick and so yummy.

DELICIOUS!!!   I did not add sugar to the graham cracker crumbs.  I found that I needed a little more than 2 cups of coconut.  Before spreading the chocolate on, I sprinkled on some toasted almonds.  I also used a mixture of hershey's milk chocolate bars and hershey's special dark and scored the chocolate so that it would be easier to cut later.  I will definitely make these again!!

These were SO YUMMY and very easy!  I plopped the coconut mixture onto the hot graham cracker crust and let it sit and warm up a bit and then it was very easy to spread.  I made these to give out in some treat baskets and I couldn't keep my hubby away from them!  I will be making them at the holidays again next year!

OMG these are awesome!  I made them for a family get together, and everyone loved them and wanted the recipe.  I followed the recipe exactly as written except that I made them in a 7 X 11 pan, which worked out great, they were nice a thick.  VERY yummy!

I LOVED these. One tip I have is to take the coconut mixture out before the 15 minutes and then put all the chocolate chips all over the top, put back in the oven, and then take out and spread the melted chocolate over the bars.

Really good, and oh so easy, BUT I agree with other reviewers that you need a little more coconut mixture - I used 2 cups but I'd say a good 1/2-cup to 3/4 cup more would have been perfect, and you probably wouldn't have to increase the sweetened-condensed milk at all.  I mixed the graham crust ingredients in my food processor, getting a pretty fine crumb, and the crust came out like a crisp, delicious cookie, holding together perfectly.  I used semi-sweet, but this would work with any chocolate - semi-sweet, bittersweet, milk chocolate - depending on your taste preference.   Thanks for sharing!

Very good, very easy.  I made a few changes.  I used dark chocolate chips, added some crushed pretzels to the crust and, like others, poured the milk over the coconut without mixing it together first.  It turned out perfect.  The pretzels in the crust give it a little crunch and a dash of saltiness.

This is a great recipe (and this coming from someone who is not so good in the kitchen!).  I made this as a dessert for Thanksgiving and my family loved it!  I did add a little more chocolate chips for easier spreading but other than that it was great!

These tasted excelent, although next time I will use double the coconut and condenced milk. I don't think there was enough.  Also this is kind of a pain to make.  It was very difficult to spread the coconut mixture on the grahm cracker crust because it keept wanting to break up, but the end product was worth it!!

Instead of making a coconut mixture, I sprinkle the coconut evenly over the graham crust and then I pour the milk over the already spread coconut. You still have to spread a tiny bit, but it’s MUCH MUCH easier to spread that way and your crust stays perfect!

Followed the recipe except I didn’t melt the chocolate first. I poured the chocolate chips evenly over coconut. Then waited a couple minutes for the chocolate to melt and spread it with a spatula evenly. Turned out great!

Very delicious recipe. Definitely a keeper. I did tweak it just a little. Instead of a 9" x1 3" , I used an 8" x8", adding an additional 5 to 10 minutes to the baking time. I also added almonds.

This was delicious! I made it in an 8x11 pan. I didn't add sugar to the crust. I added extra coconut. Probably 3 cups instead of 2. I heated the sweetened condensed milk to make it easier to spread. I had to really restrain myself so I didn't eat the whole pan in one sitting! Thanks for sharing the recipe!

I sprinkled the coconut on top of the crust after it baked, then I drizzled the sweetened condensed milk over the coconut. Then baked that for the last 15min. Also, for the chocolate topping, I used 6 regular sized Hershey's bars. I broke them up into individual squares and layed them on top of the coconut. Put in the oven for a minute, take a spoon & with the back of it spread the chocolate around. It comes out perfect every time! They are so good!!!

This is delicious in theory. I say in theory since you can only eat it with a spoon, trying to get bits of all the layers into a single bite. It completely and  totally fell apart - the bottom crumbling, the top separating.  And that's with trying reviewers' recommendations of first putting on the coconut and then pouring on the condensed milk. I suggest finding a recipe that works better.

I made this in a 11 x 7 pan and it still seemed thin, I can't imagine using a 13 x9.  It was too sweet for me, not bad just not to my taste.

Very disappointed and frustrated! If I could, I'd give this recipe 5 negative stars. This recipe, even though I followed it to a T, checked and rechecked as I went, making sure that I followed the Maker's instructions, found this to be a complete  and unmitigated disaster.  While indeed tasty, what came out for me was something that had been dished out with a spoon and eaten with a spoon.  I found 2 cups of graham cracker crumbs to be far too many and 1 stick of butter to be not nearly enough.  It never set up in my 9x13  pan and trying to spread the coconut and condensed milk on top of the crumbs that never set up was a complete exercise in frustration.  I will not be making this again. :-(

These are very,very good. Slight changes I made based on others recommendations, I put the coconut on the crust and then then drizzled the condensed milk over that, I also broke apart Hersheys Bars with almond, put it back in the oven for maybe a minute, spreads perfectly that way.

These are amazing!  I thought maybe I was being a bit bias but when other unexpected guests had some they also said they were awesome!  You are only need to make small squares as they are sweet - in a good way.  Will make them agai for sure.

Shame on me for not reading the reviews first. I made as described in the instructions and ended with thin, frail little bars. Also the melting of the chocolate ended up not going well and it wasn't very pretty (although it tasted fine).  I would either double the recipe or put this version in a smaller pan. You could leave the sugar out of the graham crackers, its sweet enough without that. And I think using a darker chocolate would be more like the Mounds bar. Thanks for the foundation recipe though!

This recipe was really easy and delicious.  One thing I will say... it was a little bit difficult putting the coconut on the graham cracker crust.  What I did that made it easier was that I used a spoon, and spread really slowly, and part of the spreading was patting it down.  That way, when you pat it down, the graham cracker crust cannot come up.

Delicious! I didn't mind that they were not as thick, you get more servings that way & the flavor is still there! I used Organic Unsweetened Coconut Flakes instead of sweetened. And I melted 10 oz. of Nestle's semi-sweet mini chocolate morsels (did not have bittersweet chocolate on hand). Also took others  suggestion & added 1 tsp. coconut extract for more flavor.  Will be making these for gatherings year round!

I kinda took ideas from everybody. I used two cups graham crackers and melted butter, I skipped the sugar, I used about 3 cups of sweetened coconut, 1 can of SCM, and semi sweet chocolate chips. I used a mini muffin tin and filled  everything by sight. I added the chips out of the oven waited about 15 mins before spreading. I then waited longer before taking out so I didn't ruin the crust. They came out looking perfect little bites! My recipe made over 36 bites.

This is the classic Mounds Bars recipe that my mother made as far back as I can remember.  SHORTCUT:  Instead of melting the chocolate chips and then spreading on the cooked coconut mixture, just sprinkle the chocolate chips on top immediately after removing the pan from the oven, and cover with a cookie sheet for a few minutes.  The chips will melt nicely and you can then spread them around with a knife or spatula.  That's how my mom taught me!

These were super rich, even after the following changes: 
I did not add sugar to the Graham crackers and butter mixture, I used unsweetened coconut flakes, and semisweet chocolate chips. I poured the condensed milk over the coconut instead of trying to mix it and spread it. I attempted to melt the chocolate chips over everything but they only got soft. Still pretty good even after all that.

I made this recipe as written, except i used dark chocolate. I would give this a 5, but spreading the coconut mixture is really hard without ripping the graham cracker crust. I had to wet my finger tips and slowly dab around until it was just right. Like other reviewers suggested..the next time i make this i will be sprinkling the coconut on and then pouring the condensed milk over top. I also didnt bother melting the chocolate first, when it was done i turned off the oven, sprinkled the chocolate all over and popped it back in the oven to melt (1 min) then spread it around. Thanks for the recipe! cant wait to make it again :)

Excellent bars super easy!  Each time I make these I always get requests for the recipe. My one tip is follow the directions about melting the chocolate chips.  I tried to place them on top of the bars and return to the oven similar to magic bars but it did not work.

Quiestion:  Is the crust supposed to be crisp on these?  My bars are quite soggy, even after putting back in the oven for a while.   Definitely melt your chocolate in the oven after spreading the chips or bars over the coconut.  Spreading was a problem for me.  They taste quite good…don't need a very big piece as the bars are VERY rich…but they sure don't look like the picture.

This recipe is excellent! Super easy and delicious. I made a couple changes but only to how I put them together to make it even easier. Once I take the crust out of the oven I pour the sweetened condensed milk over the crust and gently spread that evenly, then sprinkle the coconut over that and gently pat down into the sweetened condensed milk. Bake. Take out of the oven a couple minutes early and sprinkle with chocolate chips (I like to do 50% milk chocolate and 50% semi sweet). Allow to cook for a few more minutes, take out of the oven and spread the chocolate chips evenly and cool before cutting. I use a slightly smaller pan than a 9x13 so the bars are a little thicker. Yum! A huge hit every time I make them.

Fantastic! This was a great recipe and it was really enjoyed by all. I definitely recommend using an 8x8 pan and spreading the chocolate chips evenly over the hot coconut mixture to let them melt. I'll definitely be making this again!

I made this last night and today I ate a piece of it and found the graham cracker mixture extremely hard.  Is it supposed to be that hard?  I did have it in the fridge over night but put it on the counter for about an hour before cutting it up.

These were delicious! I used bittersweet chocolate chips, and that seemed to be the right choice (at least for our house). I wish I had read the reviews and saw to sprinkle the coconut on the crust, followed by the SCM - it wasn't a huge deal, but it would have made an already simple recipe more simple. My only real criticism is that I wish the coconut filling was thicker, and I see that a lot of reviewers felt the same - next time! :)

I love this recipe! I made it as a late night snack and it didn't disappoint! I found the consistency of the coconut layer to be a little too thick to spread, so I splashed some almond milk in there to even it out. My only regret is that I melted my chocolate too long--it became all clumpy and I couldn't smoothly spread it over the coconut. I had to sprinkle it in large clumps but I threw in some crushed almonds and it tasted just like a Mound.

I had to melt more chocolate for the top but otherwise it was a great recipe. I just used my fingers to spread the coconut and it worked out really well.

Wow, this recipe was so amazing, and I was worried because every time I try out something new, I get all excited, and it's a flop.  It was so easy, took few ingredients, and was a hit with the kids.  Was concerned about how difficult it would be spreading out the coconut mixture from previous reviews, but I just spooned it out a little bit at a time and spread it as I went and that seemed to work fine.  I didn't melt the chocolate chips, took advice from one of the reviews to just spread the chocolate chips on the coconut after it cooked, popped it back in the oven for 2 minutes and then spread out the melted chips and that worked great.  I keep it chilled in the fridge.

always a big hit when I make these.  much easier to spread coconut then pour the condensed milk over that. also don't bother melting the choc chips just sprinkle over top when just out of oven wait a couple minutes then spread then out smooth.  Just do not do what I did last year, when in trying to make more than one thing at once I forgot that the pan had already been in the oven for the first layer after I spread the coconut and cond milk.  Picked up pan with my bare hands! screamed in pain and dropped whole pan on floor (GLASS)  can you say gooey mess!!

This recipe is excellent, and easy to make except DO NOT use chocolate chips.  Instead use 5 Hersey bars.  The Hersey melts like a dream, the chocolate chips do not melt, they are a nightmare.  This was a tip from another reviewer, and they were right on.

Excellent recipe - these went over great at work.  I was intent on making these when I realized I did not have sweetened condensed milk.  I googled for a substitute and found I could make a can's worth with 2 eggs, 1 C brown sugar, 2T flour, 1 tsp vanilla, 1/2 tsp baking powder, 1/4 tsp salt and that I did.  This was so decadently good.  Also, I didn't have graham crackers to crush, so I used Annie's bunny graham crackers and omitted the sugar in the crust.  Would make exactly this way again!

I have made these and they are great, but instead of chocolate chips. I just place a few milk chocolate bars on top of the coconut when it is done baking, let it melt for a few seconds and spread, very easy.

I was looking to find a recipe as close as possible to what my grandmother made, and this is them! She had called them three-layer squares, but this is essentially them! They are my father's favorite so I made them at Christmas and he and my aunt were thrilled with them. I think this is a fantastic recipe and I will be baking them every Christmas.

These are crazy good!  To cut down on dishes, I poured the condensed milk over the baked crust and sprinkled the coconut on top.  Once that was baked, I just evenly sprinkled the chocolate chips over the top and popped it back in the oven for a minute or so to melt.  Then, I very gently spread the chocolate.  They came out perfectly layered and I had no problems cutting them with a metal spatula.  They came right out of my glass baking dish that I had sprayed with non-stick spray.  I will definitely make these again.   And again.

These are delicious!  I gave them 4 stars instead of 5 because I think they could be even better.  I would 1 1/2 times the coconut and sweetened condensed milk & double the chocolate chips so the chocolate covers everything better.  They taste delicious as written, but are even better if you make the changes above.  Also, I found it easier to sprinkle the coconut over the warm graham crust and then drizzle the milk over the coconut instead of trying to mix them together first.  I've made these twice now and will definitely make them again.

Really good. I made it according to directions, mixing the coconut and the sweetened condensed milk. Baked the coconut for about five minutes and then spread it. Topped it with chocolate chips and almonds. Yum!

Creamy, chewy, chocolatey, deliciousness.  This is one of those recipes that looks so much harder and fancier than it really is.  I used chocolate graham crackers for the crust, and they only seemed to add to the fabulousness of these bars.

These are absolutely delicious!! Supereasy to make and even people who do not like coconut cannot resist these! I made some of the similar changes mentioned before. I first laid the coconut onto the crust, and then drizzled the condensed milk on. I may put a little less condensed milk on next time or add more coconut to even out the ratio. My next goal is to experiment with different ingredients to try and make this a bit healthier because I cannot stop eating them!!

These were SOOOOO good!  I made the crust, then schlopped on the coconut/milk mixture and sorta smoothed it out.  It is difficult to do cold, but the warm crust helped.  I baked it again per directions, but took it out after 10 minutes or so and spread the coconut out more.  I wound up having to sprinkle a bit more coconut on top, so you may want to add 1/2 a cup more to the milk mixture to begin with.  I topped with sliced almonds and let setup overnight before cutting.  DELISH!!!

I followed the recipe almost to a tee. I took the advice of other reviewers and put the coconut on the hot/cooked graham cracker crust and then poured the milk over top. I also used 6 hershey bars (adding immediately after pulling it out of the oven). My one mistake was eating it right after it came out of the oven (it looked SO good).  It was too hot and gooey.  Put it in the fridge and eat the next day - IT IS TO DIE FOR, it's so good!!!!!

very good and easy recipe to put together.  I did as others suggested and sprinkled crust with the coconut then added the SCM.  After melting the chocolate in the microwave I put in the freezer for about 30 min.  They cut beautifully and tastd great.  Thanks for the recipe!!!

These are excellent! I have a recipe almost identical to this, the only minor differences are that mine calls for 1/2 c.sugar and then 2 T. peanut butter with the chocolate chip which also may help with the chocolate being softer. They are one of my families favorite bars! I also have a hard time spreading the coconut so I will try sprinkling the coconut and pouring the milk over next time! Good idea, Thanks!

I thought these were just ok.  They were a little dry and lacked filling so I think they could use extra sweetened condensed milk and some extra coconut as well.

This is a great recipe, very easy to make.  They are truly delicious.  My recommendation for the coconut is to put the coconut and milk together in a bowl and then microwave it for about a minute, stir together and then spread over the coconut and bake! These were yummy but very rich!

Scrumptious!  I whipped these up super fast and they are so so yummy!  Super easy to make, taste good when they're either warm (but you can't taste the coconut as much) but even better when they're refrigerated.  Definitely going in my personal cookbook!

Made these in an 11x7 pan instead of the 9x13 and I had no problem with these sticking together. They are delicious!! Made no changes at all except pan size. I did allow the chips to melt on top of the bars after I removed them from the oven and then spread that layer. After the pan cooled I also stuck it in the freezer to "set up" the chocolate quicker. Family loved these. Thanks!

These are very similar to the Seven Layer Bars but without the nuts. You difinitely need a "sweet tooth" to eat these. I sprinkled the coconut over the top crust and then poured the condensed milk on top of the coconut as suggested by others, worked out fine. Will be serving these tomorrow, will update with people's opinions, one who will be my brother who loves Mounds candy bars. These were a huge hit at the christening. Thumbs up from here on this one

This is a fabulous recipe for mounds lovers. If I hadn't been in such a rush to serve them at the dinner party I went to, I would not have put them in the fridge to cool more quickly. I agree w/the last review---it was hard to cut when the chocholate cooled compleltley. If they are allowed to set natuarally at room temperature, they would be much easier to cut and serve. I didn't drizzle the milk over the coconut like the other reviewers recommended, but I will next time. Sometimes I just have to learn the hard way! I did drizzle the melted chocolate over the top first, then spread it with a rubber spatula  to cover the coconut. I brought the left-overs to work and made all the dieters angry; they are incredible!

Oh yeah, quick, easy and delish.....the chocolate hasn't set, but I couldn't wait! Only change was not to add any sugar to crust, sweet as is.

I just tried to make these bars and could not get the melted chocolate chips to spread.  It cooled quickly and lumped up.  I tried to spread it on top of the coconut layer, but it wasn't possible.  I ended up scaping off the unspreadable chocolate lumps and converting the recipe to magic bars.

My mother has made these as long as I can remember-I'm 40.  Her recipe calls for 2 tablespoons of creamy peanut butter in the chocolate. And I actually made them with dark chocolate chips and wow!! Makes  them taste even richer.

I followed other suggestions and poured the condensed milk over the coconut after sprinkling it over the crust.  My only problem had nothing to do with the recipe...just someone with too many pots in the fire (literally!).  I wasn't watching my chocolate closely enough while it was melting and it seized up on me!  All of my years of baking and this has never happened!  Of course, it was the time when I had no more chocolate chips in the house, so I had to try to use it anyway...it didn't spread well.  So rather than looking ugly, these bars tasted good!  Just watch your chocolate!!!

I made these bars to take to work and could barely get them out of the house. My husband loved these. So did my boss! I added some almonds to half of the bars to make them more like almond joy bars. This is my go to dessert when I want to impress!

Would rate these a 5 on taste. However this is the 1st recipe I've seen for Mounds Bars with so much work. Any I've ever seen before you put all of the ingredients in pan at once and then baked. A lot of extra steps for the same flavor result.

Wow, these are wonderful and very easy to make. I did not have a hard time spreading coconut layer. I was not able to get it to spread all the way to the edge, but within 3/4 of an inch. I did use non-fat sweet milk, so I don't know if that had anything to do with it or not. I will make this again and again!
