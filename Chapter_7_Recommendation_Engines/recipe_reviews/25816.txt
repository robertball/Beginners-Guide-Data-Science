These have become one of my favorite desserts!  Not only do they taste great, they're a breeze to make! 
 The first time I made these I didn't have enough dough to accomodate all of the filling, so now I always make just a little bit more dough.  Also, when I don't have mini-muffin liners I use fat-free cooking spray on the bottoms of the muffin tins and they come out excellent.  

The only bad thing about these walnut cups is that they disappear in a matter of minutes!

I grew up with these walnut cups & every year I make them for Christmas. They're the best! Just dust with confectionary sugar for a holiday delight!! 

Everyone asks for these every Christmas! They start asking in October. "Can't wait for your walnut cups for Christmas!" Even my old boss called asking for a tin. Said he'd pay me! They're a gift in themselves!!

Great recipe! I thought the crust would be harder to do, but it was a breeze, and so was the filling. I didn't have muffin liners, so I just sprayed them with baking cooking spray, and then floured them. I actually had some leftover crust (which I really liked), and my mom made some savory filling (ham and cheese, held together by one yolk), and they turned out like great appetizers! I also filed one with blueberries, and those were very good too! Great recipe, thanks!

The nut filling was great but I didn't care for the crust part. Too cakey for my tastes. If I ever make these again, I'll use regular pie crust and make them into tartlets.

LOVE these lil goodies.  Only reason the four star rating is it seems to be lacking something that would make them phenomenal but I can't put my finger on it just yet.  I will however, experiment with different fillings because the cups came out perfect!  No paper liners for me...I just used, er "baking happiness" spray in my mini muffin pan.  I feel like these need to be filled with chocolate and raspberry something, mmmmm.  But as is, they are a sweet walnutty treat for sure!  Thanks so much for the recipe!

This recipe was the bomb!  Everything turned out great.  Be sure to watch how much filling you put into the cups as the filling does rise when cooking.  I doubled this recipe and made 4 dozen cookies, but had lots of filling left.

This was my first attempt ever at making nut cups, so I was more than a little apprehensive. The recipe is easy to follow and the result is absolutely delicious! I followed the recipe exactly. I rolled the little balls of dough and they fit easily into the mini muffin tin. I had just the right amount of dough and filling for 24 cups. Hubby just found them. I think I'll need to make more for tomorrow!

These might one of the best cookies I've made.  I made 1/2 of the cookies with caramel filles Hersheys kisses (couldn't find Rollos), and 1/2 with mini peanut butter cups cut in half. Made for Christmas and prinkled red and green colored sugar on top to look festive.  YUM!!  Thanks for a great recipe!!

This is one of my favorite Christmas cookies ever! My family has been making them for years. You don't need to worry about the liners or even greasing the pan, since there's so much butter in the dough. It can be a bit of a pain to press the dough into the pans. Instead you can just roll them into balls and then use a wooden pastry tamp dipped in flour - totally worth the $10 on amazon! Makes the whole process a lot faster and more professional looking

This turned out great. Here are the changes I made: 
I added 1 TBS of cornstarch,  2 TBS of powdered sugar, and 1/2 tsp vanilla extract to the crust, and 1/2 tsp of hazelnut extract to the filling. Make the 24 dough balls first (I divided it into 6 little logs, then cut each log into 4 pieces and rolled into balls). Skip the paper liners, spray a little cooking spray on the muffin tin, and bake for 20 minutes at 325 (not 375) to prevent sticking and too much browning. Otherwise, as others mentioned, you might run out of dough or end up with not enough dough in each cup. Use a melon baller or mini-cookie scoop to get the same amount of filling in each one with no mess. Powdered sugar makes a pretty topping!

Amazing. Fill the cups with your chopped walnuts then pour the liquid mixture over it. Just easier and neater. These are amazing. Better then store bought. ??

a little confused on how much butter for the crust. Ingredient list says 1 tbsp and 1 tbsp but then recipe says 1 cup. Used 1 tbsp. and turned out good.

Having misplaced my family's recipe for these I used this one.  Have never added vanilla in these and for me that  made them too sweet. I will make  batch and leave it out. Just a personal preference I guess.

This could be a new favorite! I used my new silicone muffin tray and made 12 large instead of mini ones and it worked like a charm.

My family has made these for years.  I remember making them with my great grandmother when I was little.  However we used Confectioners sugar instead of flour in the crust.  It didn't puff out as much and wasn't overly sweet.  We used both walnuts and pecans.
