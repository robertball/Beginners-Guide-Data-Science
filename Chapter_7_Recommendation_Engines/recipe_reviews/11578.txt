fantastic, at school my friends fought over crumbs and begged for the recipe but i prefer it without raisins! To avoid it getting it too cakey use more oats and less flour or whole oats instead of quick cooking oats.

I'd have to say this recipie almost has it.  I was looking at the picture trying to figure out why the edges had gone flush with the pan and burned, so I tried this recipie.  Turns out the dough is too sticky.  I had to add another half cup of oats.  Oatmeal cookies should be sticky, but should not 'melt' in the oven.  I also added baking powder for a fluffier oatmeal cookie, and substituted walnuts for raisons.  I also cut the white sugar in half and added brown sugar, as is customary in oatmeal cookies.  I think the original recipie functions more like 'drop' cookies.

These were delicious!  I always use old fashioned oats instead of quick oats in my cookie recipes and it prevents them from being too "cakey".  I might try to make them with chocolate chips next time...

This is a good recipe. I enjoy adding my grandmother's secret ingredient: one ripe, mashed banana! It's still cake like but with a new twist. We love it this way.

These cookies are very yummy and very easy to make. I substituted chocolate chips for raisins ( I used 6 TBS of plain water to sub the raisin water) and they turned out amazing!!  I will definately be making these cookies again! Thank you.

Nice cake like moist cookie. I have made a recipe very similar to this for years. The few differences in the recipe intrigued me. Of course I was out of raisins so I tried dried apricots. I am not a raisin fan, but the water from simmering  them makes the cookie. Do your self a favor and make sure you have raisins on hand, the texture of the apricot worked just great but there wasn't as much flavor.  I like my original recipe just a tad better, but if you like cake like cookies and the perfect hint of spice you will completely enjoy this recipe.

I made these cookies a few days ago, and followed the recipe exactly, except I used traditional oats instead of instant, and added about 6 teaspoons of honey for the heck of it. They smelled great while cooking, but the final result was more like oatmeal bread than cookies. I can understand why other users said they came out "cakey". My family told me to cut back on the flour next time and to add more raisins, so I'll probably use half the amount of flour and double the raisins. Overall, it's a good basic recipe.

These were a bit cakey but as they are the first oatmeal cookies I have ever baked, I thought them quite tasty. My husband hates raisins, so I added a cup of flaked coconut instead. I think I'll hold onto this recipe!

We made these without the raisins. Too much butter. Thankfully there was one person in our house that likes butter. Next time I would only use 1/2 cup of butter.

The worst cookies I've ever made. I listened to other reviews and added more oats, even used old fashion ones, but still a flop.  Way too cakey!  I greased the sheets as per recipe, the outside was golden brown but by sucking up the grease, cookies were flimsy. I tried with no grease on sheet, was a little better.  Cookies also are bland even after adding an extra 3/4 cup of raisens.

Very nice basic recipe, though I jazzed it up a little. I left out the rasins, and instead added slivered almonds. I also added a very healthy glug of both almond extract and vanilla. I used more nutmeg and cinnamon then called for too. Didn't actually measure, just sprinkled till it looked right. :)

These were really good cookies. I halved the recipe and accidentally added the full amount of vanilla and probably added extra egg to the dough, but they still came out very good.
