Made exact recipe and love it. Very nice balance of herbed cream cheese and salmon. Next time I'll skip the zest and add fresh lemon to the salmon instead (I love zest but it stood out a little too much; I prefer the herbs to pop) This is perfect for brunch and once you get the assembly line going, so fast to put together!
