I changed this with my subs but I do have to brag that THIS IS SUPER! I used onion instead of the shallot pecans instead of the pine nuts and red wine instead of the vegetable broth. It was easy to make smells delightful and tastes magnificent! Thanks for the recipe!

Very tasty! I substituted for Pecans as I didn't have Pine Nuts and also used Red Wine instead of broth. It gave it lots of favor! Makes ALOT so be prepared to share or freeze the leftovers. Also remember that this is pesto so you don't use it like a pasta sauce; you only use a tablespoon or two over the rice/pasta; if you use too much then it's overpowering.

Not very pretty but absolutely delicious. I did not change anything and we loved this recipe! It doesn't seem like enough to serve 6 but it is quite filling; we will probably get 4 or 5 servings out of it served with pasta. The leftovers are also great. I would love to top a nice hot beef sandwich with this stuff. Thanks so much for sharing Jewels Cooks!

I made this to go over penne pasta for dinner. JJ and I both liked it. I think this recipe would be best served as Horderves. Although we liked it the recipe was filling & too much to have just for a main meal. To me the recipe is more as a pesto then a dinner. Good though. Thanks for the recipe!

This was delicious! I used chicken broth in stead of vegetable broth and just a bit of pine nuts (because they are expensive) I used walnuts instead! I ended up adding about 1 cup of water because the mixture was very thick. I added a little bit of red papers flakes at the end.

I made this as a dip instead of a sauce. I followed the recipe adding some walnuts as I didn t have enough pine nuts. I served it to guests with pita chips and everyone loved it.
