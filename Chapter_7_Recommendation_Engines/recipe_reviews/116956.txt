Yum!
Very versatile recipe--easy to alter with different spice blends.  Here is my trick for making the thin slices in just a few seconds--no muss, no fuss:

I place the potato in between 2 wooden spoon handles.  I can then cut the slices super-fast, and the kinfe hits the two handles about 1/2 cm from the bottom, preventing it from going all the way through.  Literally takes about 3-4 seconds per potato.

Loved the flavor of these and they look magnificient to serve to guests!...  I used a tomato slicer and got 10 perfect slits that I made about 1/2 inch through as my guide, then I finished slicing with a large knife.  I first sprinkled garlic salt in each slit, then the Italian seasoning then drizzled with margarine.   I baked for 50 min. then added cheese as directed, but the cheese started to brown at 425 so I took them out of the oven a little early so they were slightly underdone!... I will cook potatoes longer and then add cheese last 5 min. to prevent that next time.  Delicous and the house smelled wonderful while they were baking!

Great potato recipe when you're looking for something besides the "same ole, same ole" things. To make it easier, quicker and to get the spices deep into the potato better, I mixed the seasonings into the melted butter instead of sprinkling the spices on the potato first then drizzling with the melted butter.

I cooked the potatoes in the microwave for 6 minutes or so before the oven. I reduced the oven temp to 350 and the time to 20 minutes since they were almost done coming out of the microwave. I had to cook a pork chops at the same time. It made it easy to have everything done at once. It was a quck way to have these great spuds. I added garlic salt. Yum Yum!!

Great idea, but a little bland.
This recipe definitely could have used more  of the flavors it already had.
Luckily, I made a smaller version of the recipe and sampled. I liked it much better once I added 2 tbsp chives, additional salt, doubled the cheddar, and a dash of paprika.

These potatoes are great and make a nice presentation.  I usually stick with Italian seasonings (rosemary, thyme) and add garlic powder.  I omit the chedder and use all parmesan.  These go great with steak!

These are great potatoes! I peeled mine before baking. They came out crispy on the outside and soft in the middle. A nice change to regular baked or roasted potatoes.

potatoes were a little bit of a challenge to cut. but I used a skewer to stop the blade from going all the way thru the  potatoe and that helped. My boyfriend had no problem cutting them perfectly. I used parmasean and a blend of chopped herbs. Nice presentation, next time I will put boursin with parm on top

The potatoes turned out perfect and crispy on the outside.  I will try and fan my potatoes out more the next time as I found that the seasoning only was on the top and the cheese crusted on the top but not down in the potatoes which I think would taste better.  I used a blend of the Italian Seasoning I and II recipes.  However for this I would omit the Sage as it was really pungent on the potatoes.

They were pretty good especially when it came tho the presentation.  It could have use a liitle more seasonings.  I think next time I will add some steak seasoning to it.

I normally try to follow an exact recipe when i first try it.  These were okay but i found them to be quite bland.  The second time i made them i added quite a variety of spices including, garlic, onion, seasoning salt..and i tried to get the spices more in between each slice so the flavour was throughout the potato and not just on top.  Next time.. i'm going to try skipping some of the dried spices and try using minced fresh garlic, onions, etc.

Because I was making this for a large crowd, I made a small batch first.  They were dry on the edges and not cooked in the middle.  When I made if for my event, I covered the potatoes for the first 45 minutes, then uncovered and proceeded.  They were perfectly cooked.

These were incredible!  My family loved them.  I just made sure I fanned the potato slices and found it worked best if I made my slices lengthwise in the potato--seemed like they were easier to fan, plus they looked fancy! I was out of cheddar cheese, so I used Feta, which turned out fantastic! Also, I drizzled Olive oil in lieu of the melted butter...otherwise I followed the recipe exactly.

this is the second time I am making these and I love them.  they are versatile and the italian seasoning can be swapped for whatever seasoning your heart desires.  they can even be reheated and they taste great.  My kids even ate them.

Great recipe, these vanished fast. Tip: set the potato next to the handle of a wooden spoon and then slice it, makes it much easier and a bit faster.

This was a great new way to do potatoes, however, I think it needs more butter because my potatoes dried out a little bit.

I had one really large baking potato, so I cut it in half crosswise, then placed on the cutting board flat side down and made my slices.  That gave these a little different look (see my photo) and Hubs and I each had our own serving.  After topping them with the cheeses I didn’t return them to the oven.  I let the residual heat from the potatoes melt the cheese.  I garnished with green onion tops because I didn’t have parsley.  This was just a little different from a regular baked potato and we liked it.  I’ll do this one again!  A little tip, put two wooden spoon handles on either side of the potato when you are slicing and that will prevent your knife from mistakenly going all the way through.

Very good! I had some whole, boiled russets on hand (leftover from making potato salad), so I just sliced them a little thicker then the recipe called for, added the other ingredients, and baked them until heated through. I don't know how raw potatoes would be, but the baked boiled potatoes were awesome! I was able to "fan" the potatoes a little more to get the seasonings further down and since the potato was boiled, it absorbed more of the butter than just running down into the pan. Thanks Tressa!

Yet another good fanned potato recipe. I made these early in the day and dunked them in a cold bowl of water and stuck in the fridge. DH roasted them for dinner this evening (he forgot the cheese but thats okay they still had really good flavor).

I've made a very similar recipe using red new potatoes tossed with olive oil, garlic and rosemary so was excited to try this.  They were very good, although my potatoes could have cooked longer - next time I'll try nuking them first.  One slight change I made was to add 1T of extra virgin olive oil to the butter, along with the salt and herbs which I then drizzled over the potatoes.  A tip...put a chopstick on either side of the potato while slicing them to avoid slicing them all the way through.  Works great!

Good presentation!  A little lacking in flavor.  I will definitely season mine more next time.  Possibly making it easier by putting it in the butter and pouring it on that way.

These potatoes look almost too good to eat. I did use a little extra butter and made sure to fan my potatoes enough so it didn't all stay on the outside. I would definitely make these for company. Thank you for a great recipe Tressa.

These had a really nice flavor, and they went well with the slow-cooked chicken I made.  Be sure to add enough butter, as they can be a tad on the dry side.  Overall, delicious.

Loved these!  They had a great flavor, and the cool presentation.  I nuked them in the microwave for about five minutes after cutting them, to shorten the oven cook time.  They came out nice and crispy after about a half hour.  Also added garlic salt.

Made these for dinner last night - everybody loved them!  Of course they are basically just a baked potato but the presentation was awesome.  Will make again often.  (made as per directions)

These were very tasty.  Love all of the spices and the method of baking.  I tried to get some butter and spices down in all of the slices of the potato.  Everyone enjoyed this one.

I have made these for years, but have never used the spices. I am going to try that. I simply fan the potatoes, drizzle with butter and baste every 15 minutes for an hour....they are yummy

On the pro side, this recipe looks and tastes great; on the con side, it is time consuming and takes patience to do it right.  Several reviews said this was bland, but it isn't bland if you take the time to sprinkle all the seasonings between the slices.  In addition to the Italian seasoning and salt & pepper, I added some freshly chopped rosemary.  Instead of melting the butter, I just used softened butter which I just spread across the opened fan of potato slices so it would melt down inside.  For the last 10 minutes, I added the cheeses also in between the slices with just a little across the top with parsley.  I would make these again, if I'm in a patient mood, and would also try slicing the potato lengthwise.

Came out pretty well. Made them some with red potatoes and some with yam. The yam ones were amazing!  Could use more parmesan, when is more cheese ever a bad thing? :)

These would make wonderful company potatoes because of the nice presentation.  We ran to the hardware store and got 2 small wooden dowel rods and cut the potatoes between them.  I loved another reviewer's thoughts on adding rosemary.  I think I'll rub them with oil and rosemary next time and fresh ground pepper.  Great recipe!  Thanks!

We enjoyed these potatoes and they have a beautiful presentation however mine took longer to cook than the 65 minutes stated in the recipe. Thankfully, I didn't add the cheese until they were fork tender, which was 90 minutes. Maybe my potatoes were too large. The only recommendation I have is to add rosemay(fresh or dried). Potatoes and rosemary were just mean to be together, don't you think? I will make these again.

This is such a versatile recipe.  You can use chili powder and tex mex cheese for a Mexican flare, or greek dressing and feta for a Greek glare.  Truly a gem as possibilities are endless!

These potatoes were very good. The only cahange I did was I opened them more and brushed them with garlic butter I made. Then after they were done I added (drizzeled) more garlic butter before I added the cheese. YUMMY!!

These were great and looked so pretty when finished!  I did use olive oil instead of butter since I didn't have any.  And changed up the spices a little.  Very easy and would be very easy to change up every time using different spices!

These were very good! They're a slightly different take on Hasselback Potatoes which I love.  I wasn't in the mood for cheddar so I left that out but otherwise followed the recipe as written. Quicker than a loaded baked potato but certainly as tasty. :o)

These are a great idea but a bit bland. This is something I might fix for a change every now and then but the family really didn't rave over this. They would prefer fried potatoes or mashed instead and even stated such, so I guess that was hint. Thanks anyway, I enjoyed this even though the family didn't so much.

I had to put a lot of butter on the potatoes and the cook time on the potatoes is much longer than listed. Not a good experience for me, but seems like a good experience for others.

I'm not entirely sure where I went wrong with this recipe, but it did not turn out for me. I followed the directions exactly, and the potatoes were dry and not quite done at the end of the baking time. Even after adding 10 more minutes, they still weren't close to done. It looked and smelled really good, I really wish they would have turned out!!

The easiest and tastiest way to spice up potatoes that I've found! I made these for my hubby a few weeks ago and he thought they were the best potatoes he's ever had, I even tried them by myself with a little italian dressing as the flavoring, but the seasoning in the recipe is the best, I'm actually making them again right now because my hubby and I had a craving!

I followed the advice of another review and placed the potato between 2 wooden spoon handles to cut. Worked like a charm! I added more seasonings- additional salt, chives, paprika and rosemary with a bit of olive oil sprinkled on as well, plus I doubled the cheese and peeled my potatoes. I made this for a group of friends along with bbqed chicken and it was a hit!

There is nothing wrong with this recipe, but it is hard to beat a plain, fluffy potato with the toppings you like.  We had leftovers and I used them the next morning, diced up, and browned in the leftover bacon dippings, served as home fries.  Will probably not do again.

My recipe turned down good.  I used regular yellow potatoes.  I used two teaspoons of Good Seasons Salad dressing and recipe mix to season the potatoes along with the salt and pepper.  I substituted the Italian seasoning with Basil seasoning.  I omitted the shredded cheddar cheese and used only grated Parmesan cheese.  I love the presentation of the fanned potatoes.

These are truly the best baked potatos ever!!. I microwaved these potatos for 5 minutes before slicing and putting in the oven....also I mixed toasted onion (from Pensey's) along with the butter and italian seasoning and drizzled it on potatos..so good!! I waited until potatos were about 5 minutes away from being done and then added cheese.....what a potato!! Just remember to reduce the cooking time in the oven because the potatos have been microwaved first...

One word: delicious! Husband made it today, except used cilantro in place of parsley. We loved it!!! Especially the crunchy cheese topping that fell off and cooked on the bottom of the pan.

A little fade but it came out a bit burned.  However I must have had the oven too high.  All in all it still tasted good

What a great recipe.  My first potato turned into a practice potato, and I quickly got the hang of the slicing thing by slicing 3/4 of the way down the potato and then using a pearing knife to finish the sides.  I used freshly grated parmesan, and aged cheddar, and added garlic to my butter mixture.  A definate keeper!  Thanks!

It just tasted like a regular baked potatoe, nothing special, but I did like how they looked.  You should make them if you like your food to look decorative.  But nothing special.

Great way to jazz up a boring potato. I used the recipe as a base and tinkered by adding some of my husbands favorite spices and cheeses. Very versitile and economical side dish.

This just didn't work very good for me.  It does not seem like the butter or seasoning got down into the potato like I wanted.

This was so easy and so good. The only thing I did different was add some crushed fresh garlic and when it was done I added a few sprinkles of shredded low fat cheese. Will make this one a regular.Thanks
