Made this for a birthday part, was a big hit...cut cake in 4 layers and made more filling, made it the night before and it was great 24 hours later...was a little concerned about the filling, but it soaking in the cake and made it yummy, didn't taste the ricotta at all...will make again and worth the time to make, especially for a special occassion, looked very fancy...

This took some time, but once prepared it was pretty to look at.  It was also very tasty and everyone enjoyed it at our New Year's Day dinner party.

This torte was delicious.  Shelling the pistachios took a little time, but the effort was well worth it.  With so many desserts served at the Super Bowl party, this one was completely finished.  Will make it again for sure
