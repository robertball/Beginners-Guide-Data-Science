Easy and delicious. I added some chopped sweet mini peppers for a bit of zest.

We enjoyed this and the color was lovely. My one sweet potato was bad so had to make a last minute substitution of a small butternut squash -- it probably would be 5 stars with a sweet potato. I also just matchsticked the veggies with the food processor.

I made this very similiar to recipe.  I used 1 tablespoon of bacon grease instead of butter, and used fresh basil instead of parsley. It went very well with bbq pork chops!
