Five stars alone, just for the idea. But since zucchini doesn’t have a whole lot of flavor on its own, this needs some seasoning – just plain garlic comes to mind, tho’ I used Penzey’s Fox Point Seasoning, which is a light seasoning, perfect for vegetables.  Since I had chicken broth leftover from another dish, I used it in place of the water which I hope contributed a little flavor as well as making use of something I had open. Depending on how thick you cut your zucchini, use the 5-7 minutes cooking time only as a guide.  Zucchini cooks quickly, so be careful not to overcook.

I make my own sauce with 1 can crushed tomatoes, 1/4 cup olive oil, 3 cloves minced garlic and some fresh basil. Served over the zucchini with some parmesan cheese.

This is a great way to serve zucchini! You can top it w/ your favorite sauce, or keep it simple for an easy side dish. I just bought a julienne cutter, so I used that, and it was perfect for this! The kids thought this was so fun. I will be making this again, and I can't wait to try it w/ different sauces~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

This recipe is AWESOME!  I have tried it as written and my own version as well.  With my version, I added onion and garlic to the oil before adding the zucchini then added Italian seasonings as it cooked. I did not use any water at all.  Used my favorite spaghetti sauce with a little parm cheese on top.  Like both versions!  Will definitely make again and again!

Used a sprializer to get my zoodles. I make a variation of this often with some minced garlic, cooked on high to get a quick sauté. There is no need for the water as zucchini will release water.
As written it makes zucchini sort of soggy. 
Its a great idea, but I'll stick to my regular method.

What an amazing idea! I bought a julienne tool and instantly had a great substitute for pasta. I reduced some Italian stewed tomatoes with garlic and olive oil through boiling. Cooked some chicken in olive oil with garlic and had an amazing low calorie, low fat meal.

I like to call these zoodles. I used a Spirooli® aka a Paderno® to make easy work of the zoodles. I just seasoned the zoodles and sauteed in olive oil infused with garlic until tender. Great recipe.

I added in some garlic and Italian seasoning for more flavoring and didn't even use any water, just stir fried in my 12 inch cast iron skillet the olive oil, the zucchini made its own liquid as it was cooking. I had six small/medium zucchinis and made a big pan of "Zoodles" for four people. Topped with my homemade tomato/meat sauce and some Parmesan cheese. The husband said it tasted  more Italian than regular pasta does. Everybody loved it!

Reduces the amount of carbs in your diet - check.  Adds extra veggies into your diet - check.  Allows your sauce or any add-ones to shine - check.  This recipe is perfect as it is written. Thanks DinnerMomma for a simple and wonderful concept meal. I would not change a thing!

I sure wish this (and all) recipes would give ounces/weight instead of "2 zucchini" since they vary in size greatly. I'm not European, but they always give weight instead of a number of vegetables. Thanks, this looks great anyway.

I am AMAZED!  as one reviewer stated, I too had just bought the Vegetti and couldn't wait to try this, bought the zucchini a day or two before family showed up for the weekend.  (2 of which along with my hubby are diabetics) I did learn one tip.  Don't cut off all of the stem top if using the vegetti.  or you will just rip chunks out of the top of the zucchini.  I Zoodled 2 zucchini just so that everyone could try them.  I also didn't use any water or broth, only used a little unsalted butter, 1 clove minced garlic, salt and pepper, sautéed until still firm tender, topped withe (Turkey) Wedding gift spaghetti sauce and a little fresh grated parmesan cheese.  OMG!  these will be making it to my table a lot now!  and will also be making it to my in laws tables too.  they were bickering over who got the last of them!  LOL!  I like some of the other suggestions using pesto, fresh tomatoes, Alfredo even chicken etc..  thank you so much for sharing this amazing idea!!

Loved the idea of this.  Was looking for a way to cut calories and eat better, and this was it.  Made a few changes though(always do).  I cut some sweet onions and minced garlic and cooked in oil first.  Next, I used vegetable stock instead of water.  Cook onions first till start to turn clear, add garlic.  I added salt and pepper at this point.  When cooked, I added zucchini and cooked down a bit, adding a little more seasoning.  I then added broth with 1/2 a small package of good seasons garlic and herb (salad dressing and recipe mix).  I covered and cooked zucchini mix for approx. 6 minutes.  Yummmmm!!!  Surprised my husband loved this (didn't see that coming).  He especially loved the sauce.  Will definitely make again.  Think I might also try adding sweet potato as well next time.  Janet S.

We really liked it. Of coarse I would rather have real pasta but when your eating low carb its great! And its way better than spaghetti squash! Also, if you keep turnining the zucchini as your grating it I don't think you need to cut it smaller. Its like Fettuccine. Well done! Thank you!

Really liked this. Used a mandolin to simplify the slicing and cooked it al dente. Topped it with pesto, nice.

I really liked this. I tried a similar recipe, that called for salting the zucchini first, and didn't like it so much. This zucchini almost tasted like it was cooked in butter. I am pretty sure that using fresh small-medium garden zucchini helped. I followed the recipe exactly. Only thing is I used a GEFU spirooli type hand slicer. I was able to slice 2 zucchini in no time. My only issue with this slicer, is it leaves a knob piece at the end. I also will have to get a small bristle brush to clean the tiny blades. I still recommend it, for a recipe like this. I got 2 servings at 85-90 calories each. The recipe is healthy, tasty, and quick to make.

Could not wait to get online and comment.   It is great.  First of all, I peeled the zucchini as I wanted to fool hubby and green would've been a clue.  Secondly,  I was so concerned with overcooking zucchini that I actually didn't cook long enough and he figured it out.  You need to cook zucchini as instructed in recipe.  I used a spiral slicer to cut the zucchini.  This will be a regular dish in our home.  Highly recommend.

This is wonderful and if I had my eyes closed, I would never ever know it was zucchini and not pasta.  I bought a spiral machine for the zucchini and it was so easy to make into 'spaghetti'.  Next I will try to spiral another zucchini and put Italian dressing on it for a salad that I think my hubby, who hates veggies, will also enjoy.

My family loves this.  I skip the water and just saute the zoodles until crisp tender.  These are not meant to be served alone but need a yummy sauce to complete them...think scampi, piccata, or marinara.

I use a Veggetti (my new favorite kitchen tool) to make the "spaghetti" and I omit the cooking of the zucchini as I feel that the raw "noodles" have more of an al dente pasta feel. They are a fantastic replacement for pasta and so versatile!

This was fantastic!! I topped it with chicken, yellow peppers, onions, and diced jelapenos in a spinach and tomato sauce. I found 2 zucchinis was not enough for two people - I used 3 and will use 4 next time. Awesome recepie!

Just made this.  Although, didn't have zucchini so used summer squash instead.  It was amazing.  Ate it just with the olive oil and salt and pepper and some left over roasted check mixed with it.

Great way to cook them but, most def, add some spices.  I sauteed  with minced and garlic then later added crushed peppers otherwise it will be bland.

I prepared this with chicken cacciatore from all recipes. It was excellent ! The zucchini pasta was an excellent alternative to spaghetti squash.  I prepared this with garlic and Lawry's seasoning salt. Instead of using water I used chicken stock. My zucchini looked a little flat but did the trick for my low carb diet.

It's almost hard to believe just how good this really is.  I just got my Vegetti yesterday and couldn't wait to use it.  I added two cloves of garlic with the sautéed zucchini, no water needed. I topped this with homemade meat sauce and shredded parmesan cheese.  Thanks for sharing this recipe DinnerMomma.

I started a low carb diet and was excited when I found this recipe.  I tried it out tonight at supper and all I can say is that It was delicious!  While I was peeling the zucchini into "noodles" I was thinking what a pain in the neck it was to do but I loved that the zucchini actually looked like noodles!  I added garlic to the EVOO as per some other reviewers' suggestions.  After eating the zucchini I can say it was worth the extra time to peel them into noodles.  Will definitely repeat!  Thanks for posting!

I have a little hand held gadgett that slices veggies julienne style. I sliced the whole zuchinni and didn't bother to peel or remove seeds. For a low carb diet to be successful,you need good substitutes for the higher carb foods. No, it is not th same as having real pasta, but I can definetely get used to this.

So tasty! What a great way to add another type of veggie to your meal. I served with pork chops and it went great together.  I don't think I even cooked for 5 minutes in the water because we still like a little firmness to it.

Not necessary to Sautee AND boil the zoodles, unless you're a fan of eating them like a soggy slop. A quick Sautee is fine - less than two minutes in some hot oil. Though I find the most consistent method to heat them without them getting too soft is either to microwave in short bursts until they reach the desired temperature (less than a minute), or if you're using sauce, just pouring the heated sauce directly over them without any cooking. In either case you will need to eat them immediately to keep the firmness.

I would never recommend heating them in the sauce on the stove as they release far too much water if heated slowly

Ok so yes I didn't add any water like mentioned in the comments and on a couple other recipes I saw.  And they turned out great!!!  It was my first time making them, all I did different was put some minced garlic into the oil before heating the noodles.  It didn't even need any salt or pepper; tasted just like butter noodles.  I also sprinkled some red pepper flakes before devouring.

OMG! I did NOT add water.  I added frozen chopped onions and seasoned with Weber's roasted garlic and herb seasoning.  This was so good!  It took me a while to do the zucchini by hand.  I highly recommend getting a kitchen tool to julienne or spiral cut.

I've made this many times and never add water. This time I sauteed chopped onion for a few min in garlic-infused olive oil and butter. Then I added the zoodles and jarred garlic and sauteed for about 4 min. A min before it was done, I added some chopped tomato, salt and pepper. Topped with parmesan cheese and TJoes seasoning on a portion of it, and it was good. A delicious light, low-carb supper dish.

Awesome meal, I also used a a handheld version of a spiralizer to get my noodles. Did the night prior and layered with paper towel in an airtight container. I cooked  Italian sausage removed from the casing and added fire roasted tomatoes then the zucchinni as well as some diced garlic, onion and Italian seasoning. Made again as a Shrimp Scampi, added fresh minced garlic, diced onions, basil and parsley, for the sauce used butter, salt, pepper red pepper flakes and a reduction of vermouth, most excellent!

Easy for someone who doesn't cook and edible for someone who doesn't like vegetables. It was pretty bland though so I jazzed it up with some cheese sauce I just made up.

My husband and I both loved this, but I did make a few changes.  I sauted some thinly sliced onion before adding the zucchini.  I also did NOT peel the zucchini - why would you - and used the Julienne blade on my mandolin to slice it.   I cooked it to tender-crisp and served it with Parmesan cheese on top.  Will definitely make again!

The first thing I would recommend is NOT to add any water, broth, etc.  Zucchini has a lot of water already, and there was quite a bit of water left in the pan without adding any liquid.  Also do NOT over cook.   My zucchini was pretty mushy, but with added seasoning, it still tasted ok.  The next time I make this, I will watch very carefully how long I cook it, it will probably be like a stir fry, tender but not mushy.  It also cooks down quite a bit, so two zucchini really wasn't enough for 2 people.  I gave it 3 stars because it doesn't need water, or much cooking.

After I sliced the zucchini, I tossed it with some spices before sautéing in the skillet with olive oil. Topped it with tomato sauce (made with a can of diced tomatoes, olive oil, garlic, roasted cumin, & fresh basil). Delicious!

I changed it a bit to suit my family's taste...1. I minced garlic and put it in the oil before adding zucchini. 2. I made a rose sauce to pour over top. It was a delicious meal and we can't wait to make it again!!

Good substitute for pasta. family loved it.  did not even peel zucchini. Used mandolin to make spaghetti strips.  Had it with veg pasta sauce and homemade meatballs.  Sauteed 2 cloves of garlic before adding the zucchini. this will become a staple recipe.

First time to try zucchini. Being a picky eater, I didn’t want to let go of the comfort of my pasta. WOW! Zucchini noodles are absolutely delicious.

No water needed for these.   Added sea salt, garlic powder and sliced red onions and sauteed in olive oil until tender.  Very delicious.

I have made these noodles a few times and I love them! I don't have a spiral cutter so I just use a sharp knife. I wash the zucchini, cut off the ends and then cut it longways in 4 pieces, and remove the seeds. (Leave the skin on for more nutrients or use a peeler if you want it to look like spaghetti noodles). Then I make thin strips out of each piece until all 4 pieces are cut into future noodles. Pat them dry with paper towels and remove as much moisture as you can. I omit the water since zucchini already holds a lot of moisture.
Heat 1-2 TBL Olive oil  in a large skillet for 1 minute. Add zucchini noodles and sprinkle with garlic powder , black pepper, and salt to taste. Saute until noodles are Al Dante. Serve as is, or top with spaghetti, fettuccine, or Alfredo sauce.
PS. My grand kids love it when I make the noodles bigger  and thicker and top them with Velveeta cheese sauce for Nonny's Mac n Cheese. It's a great way to sneak some veggies into their diets too. :)

Good idea, but I think the noodles needed to be steamed instead of cooking in the olive oil. This was not very good even with seasoning. And I really like zucchini. Maybe I will try steaming next time.

Better than I expected. I didn't use the water. I fried some chicken first and then used the same pan to saute the zucchini with black pepper, sea salt, garlic powder, onion powder and a pinch of chicken granules. Sauteed for about 3 minutes and it was done. Yummmm. Will definitely do this again. I used a potato peeler to make ribbons of zucchini and that was fine.

Perfect! I needed to remember how to cook zoodles to be used as replacement for spaghetti in a spaghetti and meatballs dish and this recipe worked very well. I did use a little less water as I knew my sauce, once poured over would add too cooking the zoodles. It was the perfect texture for us. Will continue to refer to this recipe in the future. Thanks for the recipe!

I made this to sub for pasta for my husband who is eating low carb. The first time I followed the recipe exactly, and gave it the 3 stars. The idea was great, but it was mushy and too oily. The second time I used just enough oil to keep the zucchini from sticking, no water, and full size thick peeler cuts. He liked that a lot but said that simple slices would do the job as well.

watery unappealing 0 taste mess. I didn't put the water in the recipe called for and thank goodness cuz it was swimming in its own water. We didn't overcook it and even put spaghetti sauce on it, but it just wasn't good. Very disappointing and a waste of sauce and 2 zuchs.

I made this last night and followed the recipe with the addition of a bit of garlic salt for seasoning. It was terrific! I served with a nice grilled rib eye, another All recipe suggestion for scrambled cauliflower, a watermelon/blueberry salad with balsamic vinegar, and a delicious Greg Norman 2016 Paso Robles cabernet. It was a very nice meal enjoyed by all involved.

Super easy. I felt like it was a fast, simple way to add a garnish to sliders. My family was less enthused. 5 stars for easiness. I really liked it, but it wasn’t a fan favorite.

Absolutely delicious!  I love pasta more than anything and on low carb that's a big NO.  This was so good, I will even make it when not doing low carb.  I didn't add water, just used the olive oil to cook them.

I used a spiralizer for the zucchini but wasn't sure how to cook it, so I found this recipe. It was perfect! My first time trying zucchini noodles but they were delicious. I sauteed some garlic, onions, mushrooms, spinach and artichokes in olive oil to combine with my noodles.

Completely satisfied my cravings for pasta. Love the healthy alternative. I added a creamy pesto sauce with leftover taco meat and it was delicious. You can really add anything you might throw in to a pasta dish.

Great idea.  We are starting a low carb diet.  I love pasta.  So made my sauce, bought a spiralizer, made perfect zucchini spaghetti and am so pleased with the end result.  The zucchini curls on your fork just like real spaghetti.  Thank you for making my diet easier to bear.

It still tastes like zucchini, but we all have to eat our vegetables and I like finding new ways to present them.  One of my kids even liked it.  Normally the kids dislike everything green.  I used a mandolin for slicing.

Used a spiralizer. No water. Just oil and garlic and added tomato slices.  Tasted good. Needed a bit more punch, though.

Used a spiralizer .  Easy to make and easy to follow.  This is a great basic recipe on how to cook zucchini noodles...but does not have any flavor if eaten as is.  I served it with my homemade spaghetti sauce...and it was yummy.  Alone....without sauce..not so much.

Great substitute for pasta- only thing I'd try to change is the amount of olive oil as I tried to put homemade sauce on it afterward.  WITH some kind of flavorful sauce= perfect!

My husband is eating low-carb, so I have been replacing pasta, bread, rice, etc within other things.  He was very sceptical of “zucchini spaghetti” but  said he would try it with an open mind. We both thought it was really good.  I served it with a tomato pasta sauce - you  would want to season with garlic, salt  and white pepper or something similar if no sauce.

The zucchini was a bit bitter the first time I made this. The next time, I put the spirals in salted water for 10 minutes and ran the zoodles through a salad spinner to remove the excess water. I've also tried salting them without the water, but then ended up spinning them dry. So, salted water it is.

Made this as the recipe described but without salt or pepper at the end, since we planned to use this as spaghetti noodles. We added ground beef and spaghetti sauce on top. It tasted pretty much the exact same as regular spaghetti noodles too, so it's an excellent healthy alternative to traditional pasta. Very quick and easy to make too, had no difficulties, very simple recipe. I'm very excited to try zucchini as a replacement in other pasta dishes!

The zucchini pasta came out just like al dente spaghetti in texture, and was easy to make. I did use a spiral cutter instead of cutting it by hand, so I did not have to peel the skin. I used mild harissa sauce with it, and it was delicious, as I'm sure any sauce would be with this pasta.

I omitted the 1/4 c water after I sautéed the zucchini noodles. There was some liquid in the pan and we prefer the noodles al dente. I seasoned with sea salt, fresh ground pepper, fine herbes and finished with garlic & onion nutritional yeast. Served with homemade meat sauce. My husband said he would eat it again, so I would say it is a winner!

In avocado oil I sauteed 2 garlic cloves, handful of maitake mushrooms, and about 10 leaves fresh basil.  Then I added the squash (yellow crookneck and green) for a couple of minutes w/ a dash of salt.  Then I tossed in parmessan cheese  for about 30 seconds.   It was delicious!

Used a julienne peeler to cut the zucchini. Followed directions and topped with favorite sauce (marinara) as author wrote in introduction. Wonderful pasta sub! Boyfriend liked it too. Served with chicken parm from this site also.

Delicious, quick ,  easy AND my family (who normally will not touch zucchini) loved it!! .What more can you ask for?.  Have made it twice now, the only change I made was to omit the water and salt/pepper but  added onion powder.  I just used our favorite store bought marinara and prepared chicken meatballs.

I thought this was a great low carb substitute for pasta.  I made it as instructed and added a Parmesan Reggio sauce.  It was delicious.  I could not believe how much it tasted and had the same texture as regular pasta.  I highly recommend it.

Turned out great! I followed the advice of some other reviewers and added garlic and left out the water. Then I mixed in a little Alfredo and some pesto and topped with Parmesan.

I made my own homemade sauce added turkey sausage and made the noodles exactly as directed. Loved it. May never go back to reg noodles again. My Dr asked me to cut down on the pasta because I am borderline diabetic. This is a savior. Thank you for sharing so much!

Loved this recipe. I used roasted cherry tomatoes and fresh Parmesan as garnish. I also sautéed minced garlic and onion before throwing zoodles into heated oil. Delish.

Almost as good as pasta and none of the carbs makes this a winner.  I have a "zoodler" to make these.  Sometimes zucchini can be watery, so after making them into pasta like noodles, I put them on a plate lined with paper towels to dry them a bit.  I've also tried these in the microwave, since I make a pasta topping that the whole family can eat and these are just for me.  I put them (paper towel removed) in the microwave, with a little butter for 3.5 minutes and they turn out perfect.

I made this for breakfast, sauted the zucchini in a bit of coconut 
oil, added it to my scrambled eggs with a bit of goat cheese. 
Delicious. Thank you for the recipe.

Super,easy, absolutely delicious.  Have made it several times since, playing on the original from time to time -  followed Chef Johns Aglio  e Olio recipe using the zucchini noodles - so happily satisfying.

Particularly happy with the "bite" of the pasta, if I didn't know, not sure I would know it wasn't heavy carb pasta.

Also, didn't realize it was a recipe for one.  Served it as a side, with sausage and peppers and we were both satisfied.  Just as an aside.

Quick, easy, and delicious! I sauteed in olive oil with a bit of salt, then I sprinkled with an Italian herb blend and a little Parmesan cheese. It really did taste a lot like my favorite pasta. I'll be making this again and again. :)

Excellent.  A little garlic powder goes a long way toward making this bland but excellent pasta replacement even better. I use squash or zucchini, and top mine with a serving of portabella mushrooms, garlic and onions sauteed and then cooked with red wine.  Very filling and low carbs.

The concept is fabulous.  My husband's doctor put him on a paleo diet so pasta is out.  I don't care for plain pasta cooked - as noted, not a lot of flavor.  So I generally want it to simmer in my sauce.  I sliced up a pound of mushrooms, and diced an onion.  I agreed with the question about how much zucchini. I used 2 medium and  shred them into long threads, (I used a spirelli).  I sauteed the mushrooms and onions in olive oil.  Then added the zucchini and meat (small meatballs or coined Italian sausage) and my favorite Italian pasta sauce.  I did add garlic and onion powder to tweak the flavor.  Cook over medium-low until all nice and savory.  Depending on the size your jar of sauce is, you may want to add a third zucchini. Serve with a salad or corn on the cob.  Husband pronounce it a great success and rated it 9.1. (This is a meat and potatoes guy.)

This stuff is awesome! My family is full of pasta lovers who all need to lose a good few pounds so this is absolutely perfect! This is definitely a dish where you're supposed to add stuff to it, like Parmesan cheese and such. But hey, that's like your usual spaghetti, so, i give it five stars!

I'd give it 5 stars but I used it as a base recipe.  Never spiralized zucchini before but just got myself a spiral slicer.  I'm sure this recipe would be delicious as is but after the oil I sautéed garlic & then added the zucchini.  Stirred a bit then added oregano, garlic salt and my own marinara sauce, just enough to coat, no water, and cooked until heated through.  Fresh, torn basil on top and it was absolutely delicious.

I made this to replace the pasta in spaghetti bolognaise.  I didn't add liquid; the  zucchini had enough on its own.  Cooked in a little olive oil with garlic, dried oregano, salt & pepper for 2-3 minutes on a fairly high heat in a wok, it stayed al dente, which was perfect as a spaghetti replacement.  I used a Zyliss julienne vegetable peeler (purchased for $18 at a kitchenware shop).   It's super quick & easy to prepare the zucchini and fantastic for carrots and cucumbers for Vietnamese salads as well.  My husband and I both enjoyed the zucchini topped with the bolognaise sauce and finely grated Grana Padano.  Tasty, light and healthy and a great addition to a low carb and wheat-free diet.

I didn't peel the zucchinis so I had to cook for longer and still remained quite firm.  Next time I will peel them to be more like pasta.  Also this would be good to mix with pasta to reduce carbs for those who just can't do without it .

I can only give this 4 stars because I made some changes.  I cooked up some onions and garlic before I added the zucchini.  Then when I served it, I added a bit of fresh grated parm cheese.  Wonderrful dish.  Thank you for the share.

I followed both the main recipe plus the advice from fellow readers. Long story short: this dish is AMAZING! I threw in some fresh garlic and yellow pepper into the oil as it heated to add some flavor and color. I also used about a quarter cup of spaghetti sauce; water was not needed at all. Sprinkled in some parmesan before serving and the dish was gone in no time! I love how easy and FAST this is to prepare and cook. Highly recommended!

I read the other reviews and sautéed some garlic and onion in the oil and didn't use the water. I added a splash of balsamic vinegar about a minute before pulling the pan off the heat. Topped with some sprinkled parmigiano and this is going to be my new quick meal go-to. I'm by myself and always find regular pasta to be too much with leftovers I never eat, but one medium large zucchini fills me up perfect! Thanks!

I just bought the spiralizer for my KitchenAid mixer and had some zucchini in my fridge. I wanted a quick recipe on how to cook the spiralized veggie. This recipe is great. Reading through the other reviews I diced in a clove of garlic with the oil and added 1/2 cup of chicken stock after the first minute or so of cooking.  Once the zucchini reduced a little it released more water and while the flavor was good to cook in I drained like regular pasta, heated some leftover pork sausage from Friday night in the same pan and voila. Delicious??

I love zoodles, and use them exclusively in my Italian dishes.  However, I have found that they get runny.  I found a recipe that said to spiral the zukes, place on a couple of  paper towels, lightly salt and let sit for at least 20 minutes.  It will begin to "water."  Then cover with more paper towels and press lightly to absorb the liquid.  I even put fresh paper towels down, transfer the zukes onto them, and use more towels to get even more of the liquid out.  Then, heat up the olive oil and stir fry.  Works great!

Very tasty fast and simple. You can spice it however you like and it comes out perfect every time. I found that before I added the water it had already leaked out some of its juices and was starting to cook on its own and then I just used the lid. I won't add extra water next time.

Love this recipe, did add fresh garlic and didn't add the water. Also bought a spiralizer that makes the zucchini noodles so easy to prepare!

It was really fun to spiralize the zucchini (my son helped with that!) but I thought the zucchini  ended up a little bitter.

Very good.  Cooked it just like it said except I added fresh garlic. Just a great twist for the truck loads of zucchini that I am picking in my garden.

I also heard an idea that you could use large zucchini sliced lengthwise in your favourite lasagna recipe. haven't tried it yet but I bet it would be great.

This is a fantastic recipe, even for the non-squash lovers! My sons asked what the "green stuff that looks like grass" was because they really liked it, and they couldn't believe that it was zucchini. I used a chop box to get the zucchini to spaghetti like consistency and it cooked quite nicely, with a little oregano, salt and pepper.

I am so happy I came across this recipe. I made it two nights in a row with garden fresh zucchini. I used a mandolin slicer on the julienne setting, it was perfect for this recipe. I omitted the water, sautéed garlic in the oil and used Italian Seasoning. I topped it off with fresh marinara and loads of parmesano reggiano.  It was absolutely delicious.

I call it Vegetti because that is the tool (looks like a giant pencil sharpener) that I use.   I lightly salted mine and wrapped it paper towel to get out excess moisture.  I think dropped it into boiling water with garlic for just 2 to 2-1/2 minutes.  Served it with meat sauce and parmesan a had a huge plate of "pasta" without all the calories.

I agree with another post, 5 stars for the idea. More people should try this. I love pasta, and had to go gluten free. Though I love spaghetti squash, it does have a different texture than what I'm used to. Zucchini, however, has almost the same texture as our beloved (& longed for) friend. As a plus my kids love it :) I also make thin slices to use as lasagna noodles. I do cheat now, (I've got 6 kids, I need a time saver;) I got a veggeti.. $15 at a local department store. I twist the zucchini a few times a voilA! Noodles, or as they have been called here, zoodles ;)

Delicious recipe. Is this for real? I can eat pasta without the carbs?! My only recommendation is going lighter on the water or maybe not using water at all. Zucchini is pretty moist, so the first time I made this, it was a little slushy. Otherwise, follow the recipe as written!

DinnerMomma, thanks for sharing this, We've been making zucchini pasta at home for several years now - after eating at a local restaurant "Nine Mile" in Asheville, NC. They have zucchini pasta as an alternative to regular pasta for their pasta selections. We bought a 'spiral slicer" at Kitchen-n-Company" for less than $30.00, and have really enjoyed using it to make angel-hair pasta. If you're making a hot sauce for the pasta, you don't even need to cook the zucchini pasta. The sauce heats the pasta. 

FYI -- if you use the slender zucchini, there's no seed problem.

Thanks again for sharing. Using your recipe would also be wonderful cooked with veggies as a stir fry. :)

Great recipe to get me started with zoodles!  We used an alfredo sauce with mushrooms and broccoli on top.  Yumm!!  This makes going low carb a breeze! :)
