This was absolutely delishous but I did tweek the recipe.Firtst, I cooked the bacon till it was almost done and sat it aside I substituted half the cream cheese with mozzarella. I seasoned the chicken with onion and garlic powder and seasoning salt.Then I  sauted (sp) the chicken breast in olive oil instead of butter just till the outside meat was white. Then I baked for half the time it called for and broiled it the other half of the time to make the bacon crisp It was the best meal I ever cooked I've made it twice already and I cant get enough of it. My all time favorite recipe already.

Delicious! Thanks for the idea =) ..& here I go with my annoying list of "changes" lol ..but that's the fun of cooking! ..right? Started with thin cut breasts. Used Philadelphia Chive & Onion Cream Cheese mixed in my processer with lots of fresh garlic, Shredded mozz, grated parm, a little sour cream, crumbled bacon and fresh ground pepper. Dipped my breast 1st in butter and roasted garlic olive oil then in italian bread crumbs and more parm. Served with buttered corn and Stove Top Stuffing. Very rich but soooo yummy!!

This recipe has many great possibilities. 5 stars to the cook who suggested wrapping in puff pastry!! The chicken itself needed more zip so maybe sprinkling with some barbeque salt would help? I also suggest sauteing fresh mushrooms and onion in garlic butter and a splash of white wine and spooning that in the middle along with some herb and garlic cream cheese, wrapping in prosciutto and puff pastry, placing seam side down on a cookie sheet, brushing with egg whites and baking @ 375 for ~40minutes. cover with foil for a while if the pastry is getting too brown. Yum

This is a great recipe and I swear you could put just about anything rolled up inside a chicken breast and it's bound to be good. Plus the combination of cream cheese, chives, and bacon was a clue to me that this was going to be tasty.  Given that my husband loves bacon I had to give this a try.  But, I did make a couple of changes...  First I pounded my chicken breasts down thin. Second I used fresh chives vs. dried and aded a little onion powder to the cream cheese mixture.  I cooked my bacon (real bacon, not turkey bacon) just until tender-crisp and placed that onto the chicken breasts then added the cream cheese mixture and secured with toothpicks. I dipped the chicken in egg and then seasoned Italian bread crumbs to form a light coating. I then drizzled it with a little melted butter and baked at 375 for 30 mintues.  The result was a very moist and flavorful chicken bursting with a delicious cream cheese and bacon center!

WOW! I changed this one up just a bit, I coated the outside of my chicken in eggs, and breadcrumbs... and then stuffeed them, and wrapped them in reg. bacon (not turkey). IT WAS AWESOME! My husband gobbeled it up, and not only was it delcious and pretty simple to prepare, it looked elegant on the plate because of the bacon! I would make this one for a dinner party!

YUMMY!!!  After reading the other reviews on how plain the chicken was to them, I marinated the chicken with romano basil salad dressing.  It was fabulous!!!!!

I was on this site looking for a bnls chicken breast recipe...something different from what I usually make.  When I came across this one it sounded awesome so I decided to give it a try.  I'm glad I did!  This is a recipe that you could go nuts modifying!  I used regular bacon...baked for about 10 minutes on a baking sheet.  I then put the butterflied chicken breasts (I used 6 small) on the same baking sheet with the drippings from the bacon.  I seasoned the chicken with granulated garlic, herbs, Adobo, and salt.  I filled the breasts with a mixture of cream cheese, 2 jalapenos (seeded and chopped) and about 3/4 cup mozzarella cheese.  I then wrapped each breast with 2 slices of bacon and baked for about 35 minutes.  OMG...we LOVED this and will definitely be making again.  My daughter had the leftovers for breakfast!!

This turned out very well.  I used garlic herb cream cheese to add more flavor.  I also cooked up the bacon about half way before wrapping the chicken to get it done.  We really liked this...thanks for the post.

This was pretty yummy!

I didnt follow the directions to the word though. I used chive and onion cream cheese to save myself some effort, and I mixed in mozz. cheese, making it 1/2 cream cheese and 1/2 mozz. 

Advice: The bacon on mine not edible(too soft) I will slightly pan fry it before wrapping the next time. Also this chicken stays white so it's hard to tell by appearances when it is done cooking. Just a heads up. I will make this again!

I seriously love cream cheese, but the filling for this chicken was just too much for me. Next time, I'll probably tweak the filling and use half cream cheese and half feta cheese, just to cut the overpowering taste/texture of the cream cheese. I'll also add more garlic and some onion instead of the chives... maybe add some parsley for color. I used regular bacon and topped each piece of chicken with parmesan cheese, which got brown and crispy and yummy.

I make this often and mine sounds ummm...a little better... I put in ham and thinly sliced mushrooms over the cream cheese mixture. I then add a little lemon juice. After the chicken has cooked,I take it out and stir up all the good brown bits with 1/2 c white wine, 1/2 c chicken stock and the rest of the lemon juice and let reduce a few minutes, add a pat of butter to thicken and make glossy....heaven!!

This chicken made a great meal.  Thank you to the reviewer who suggesting dipping in egg and breadcrumbs before stuffing and baking.  I did the same thing.    I did not add bacon, because my husband is allergic.  For the stuffing, I used 4 oz. of cream cheese, a couple tablespoons of crumbed feta cheese, the chives and garlic.  I marinated the chicken the night before cooking in Italian dressing.  So great!  I think I'll be making this again for special family meals.

Just like all the others I like to find a recipe that has potential and make it my own. So for this one I liked the idea but sounded like it needed some tweaking. My "stuffing" went something like this, sauted 1/2 onion with 2 cloves of minced garlic in olive oil, once the onions were translucent I tossed in the washed and dried thawed spinach, then set it aside. Next I fried 3 strips of bacon - pulled them out to cool and tossed the spinach mixture in the bacon drippings, crumbled the 3 pieces of bacon and tossed in the mixture and set aside again. Next I added almost half a container of ricotta, and half a brick of cream cheese and about 1/2 cup of parmesean cheese, and 1/2 cup bread crumbs. About a tsp of season salt, and black pepper and called it done on the stuffing. Fried 8 pieces of bacon until the fat was clear and the edges were just starting to crisp, and Pounded out 4 rather large butterflied boneless chicken breasts and spread out 1/4 of the mixture leaving about a 1/2 inch edge around. Rolled it up and then wrapped two pieces of bacon around each one (secured with tooth picks) Placed each portion in a 9x13 pan sprayed with cooking spray and sprinkled the top of the chicken with season salt. I added about 2 tbs of butter to the baking dish and threw em in the oven at 350 for 35-40 min then turned the broiler on low for about 10 min  to finish crisping up the bacon. My guy LOVED them, so thanks for the inspiration!

Yummy! I did need to tweak it a bit though to add flavor. Here's what I did:
- chicken: I marinated it with garlic salt, a little olive oil, pepper, basil and minced garlic

- filling: I mixed mozzarella and parmesan cheese with the cream cheese and chives.

- butter: added more and brushed it on before and during

It was sooo good! Everyone loved it!

I really wish I could rate this higher, but I followed the recipe & it was a disaster. After baking 35 min, the bacon was not cooked AT ALL. I pulled the bacon off to finish it in the microwave & the bits of cream cheese that were on the bacon burned to the papertowel. Once I had unwrapped the bacon from the chicken, the cream cheese mix completely leaked out of the chicken into the hot pan, melting it all. SOOOOO, the chicken was very moist but I only got to taste about 1 tsp of the cream cheese mix w/it & it was very bland. The bacon I ended up crumbling on top of the chicken was very good w/the chicken, just wish it would've come all together. I OBVIOUSLY should've read the reviews before making this because, out of the 4 & 5 star reviews I read afterwards, NOT ONE person made the recipe as written.

This was a really fun recipe to make your own.  I put 1/2 the cream cheese, then added mozerrella, lots of garlic and bacon crumbled and italian tomatoes.  I sprinkled the top with romano.  WOW was this ever good!!  You can really play with this one.

This was a great idea I just think it needs more seasoning b/c it didn't have alot of flavor. So I used a cheeseball mix (from tastefully simple)and added that to the cream cheese before baking it.

Delicious, moist chicken (: I pounded each breast down to flatten some. Pre cooked bacon slightly. Mixed about 1/3 cup mozza in with cream cheese. Used green onion as I had no chives. Sprinkled chicken with Johnny Salt and pepper. Baked 375 for 30 min. turned out really good although next time will precook bacon more as the inside was pretty soft and would prefer it better cooked. Once I had toothpicks in place  I coated chicken rolls in the butter then in Italian breadcrumbs mixed with Parmesan. looked picture perfect when I took them out of the oven.

Love, love, love!!!! My 1 yr old, who doesn't eat chicken, ate this.  I read reviews and changed a few things.  I used salt and pepper to season the chicken.  I used some  mozerrella cheese as well.  Finally, I left off the bacon.  Yummy

I made a few changes to this recipe because of personal preference but I think it would still be good as written.  I cooked a few additional strips of regular bacon and crumbled that into the mixture along with some chopped scallions.  I also cheated and used the pre-flavored sour cream & chive Philadelphia cream cheese.  I cooked the other strips of bacon for the outside of the chicken until they were almost done and I cooked the chic in olive oil for just over a min on each side before stuffing them with the cheese mixture.  I dipped my stuffed chicken in egg and coated them with Italian bread crumbs then secured the bacon around the breasts.  I baked for about 40 min.  Surprisingly the filling did not leak out and it was very moist.  I served with salad, crescent rolls, and loaded mashed potatoes....awesome dinner!!!

I thought this was a great recipe! I did add a slice of mozzarella and put some bread crumbs with seasonings on top and it was even better! I think next time, I may make it without bacon or put the bacon inside.. but overall, this was great!

substituted fresh chives and cut the cream cheese in half...probably threw in about 2 oz of mozz.  sprinkled the chicken with garlic powder. like other users I cooked the bacon partially, but it still never really crisped up.  maybe the last few minutes should be under the broiler.  mine had to stay in for 35 minutes.  All in all, super yummy.  I paired in with a roasted brussel sprout recipe from this site.  I loved it, the hubby loved it!  thanks for a great recipe!

This dish was fabulous!  The only thing that could improve it would be brushing it with butter or oil before cooking and throwing on some Lawry's salt and pepper.

I made the chicken with some revisions.  I put bacon, parmesan green onion and little onion powder in my cream cheese mix.  I rolled the mixture in my flattened chicken breasts and secured with tooth picks.  Then i poured melted garlic butter on top!  It was very delicious!  Thank you for posting this!

Yum! I substituted garlic and herb Boursin cheese instead of the cream cheese and chive mixture and used proscuitto instead of bacon and it was phenomenal!!! Will definitely make again.

This was a great recipe. Of course I had to make some changes. I used fresh green onions and I added a cup of spinach that was cooked and drained. I also seasoned my chicken with onion powder, Garlic salt, and poultry seasoning. One piece of turkey bacon did not cover the whole piece of chicken so I ended up using two per piece of chicken. And I ended up cooking my chicken for 15 minutes covered and about 15 minutes uncovered.

I added greek yogurt and ranch powder mix with the cream cheese and garlic, and I dipped the stuffed breasts in flour, egg, and then breadcrumbs. Topped all with melted butter and garlic olive oil.

Came out stupendous!

This recipe is bad because current cream is not the consistency that it needs to be compared to 15 years ago the cream cheese just melts out before it firmed up. I have been looking for ten year for good old grade cream cheese not bagel cream cheese in block already whipped.

Tasted good, but the wrapping in bacon and securing with tooth picks just eluded me. The chicken didn't fold all the way over the cream cheese mixture, and it just squished out of the sides when I tried to secure with toothpicks. I ended up laying the bacon and the sauce over the chicken.

Yummy! I love cream cheese! Next time I will pound out the chicken and then roll it up so it cooks better. I didnt add the bacon ontop but I did dip the stuffed chicken in egg and then rolled it in some seasoned bread crumbs. I also Added some crunchy onions in the cream cheese mix! Will try out different flavors next time but a definite keeper!

This idea was REALLY good - my husband and I loved it.  I did however make some changes.... first of all, I pounded the chicken breasts as flat as i could get them and then cut them down the middle.  I used the cream cheese mixture as as a spread and kind of rolled it (like pumpkin bread pattern almost) and then secured it with the toothpicks.  I also did not use bacon - not on purpose though, we just didn't have any!  Based on other reviews, I wanted the chicken to have some more flavor, so in a bowl, I put some grated parmesan, salt, and pepper, and put one side of the chicken in the bowl then laid it down on the cutting board before I put the cream cheese on.  Lastly, I used minced garlic.  GREAT idea though :)

So many suggestions about putting more taste on the meat, but I guess I put too much, it was too salty but still tasty, the second time I made it, I just put salt and black pepper on the chicken and nothing on the cream cheese, it was perfect to my taste. (I dont have chives and my husband doesnt like the garlic)

A very good way to dress up chicken! I added some parm-reg to the cream cheese. When I finished baking the chicken, I topped it with lemon cream sauce (with parm-reg as well). Perfect!

this was wonderful. My picky 7 year old ate almost all of it and my husband keept saying how great it was. Still I wish there had been more filling in the center of the chicken all in all it was a great dish and I loved the bacon with it.

Thiss was fantastic, but I used cream cheese, sun-dried tomatoes, dried basil and garlic instead of the chives. I cooked the bacon a bit before wrapping the chicken, then baked it for 40 minutes, then broiled for 5. Could have broiled for a bit longer to make it crisper, but overall delicious!!

In my opinion, there wasn't enough flavor. The bacon gave it a lot of flare, but that was about it. A lot of the cream cheese oozed out of the chicken when I was cooking it. It could have been a lot better.

I thought this recipe was okay. It was missing something, I couldn't quite put my finger on what it needed. My boyfriend really liked it. He ate it with pizza sauce. I did wrap it in puffed pastry dough. I will make it again only next time I think I will chop up the chicken, mix with the cheese and then wrap in puff pastry dough.

Made this recipe per the instructions and WOW was it good, my family loved it and it was so tender and flavorful. I did dust lightly with adobo seasoning so that the chicken wasn't totally plain going into the oven. The cream cheese chive garlic mixture was absolutely simple and perfect. This recipe will be in rotation for a long time to come!!

Amazing! I'm not one for chives, so I mixed a cheese/garlic powder mix in with the cream cheese, and added finely chopped fresh spinach to the mix as well, and I wraped the entire chicken in bacon to hold the mix in. Then I added minced garlic and parsley in with the butter that I poured over top, and poured over again half way thru. PERFECT! I found my new favorite dish!

I wanted to so much like this dish. I had made a similar dish but couldn't recall the recipe so I looked for something online and found this. Love cream cheese, bacon and chicken - how could I go wrong, right?  Ugh.  Preparation was simple.  I added a little more garlic based on some of the reviews.  Popped it in the oven and prepared all my side dishes.  30 minutes later, I cut into a piece to make sure it was finished because 30 mins on 350 did not seem like enough time to me but what do I know.  My dad took a bite and spit it out.  It wasn't done.  Back in the oven for another 15 minutes.  So let's start by saying if you're getting breasts to butterfly, pound them first because this is not nearly enough time in the oven to cook thoroughly. The bacon was another issue - parts of it was done, parts were not.  Yuck.  I'd suggest starting with partially cooked bacon or putting it in the broiler to finish it off. Even after another 15 mins in the oven, my dad couldn't eat it - I guess the thought of the uncooked chicken just wouldn't get out of his head. I picked the bacon off mine and it was just not great. I think the review of putting breadcrumbs on it is right on! It was such a disappointment and to add to the fact that it was dinner for my parent's anniversary just added insult to injury. The dish has a lot of potential but too much wrong with it as is.

Boy am I glad to find this recipe.  I am cooking a dish very similar to this right now and while it's baking in the oven, I've looking online to see how long I should bake them when I ran into this recipe. How perfect! 

My cream cheese mixture had chopped cooked bacon and chopped green onions.  I didn't think of the garlic though.  I'll have to try it with that next time.  I did season the chicken on the outside with sea salt and paprika.  It looks delicious and smells delicious.


An hour later....

Dinner was delicious.  The man loved it.  I loved it. This is definitely a repeat meal.

This was pretty good but the meat was a bit bland.  If I make it again I would marinate the chicken first in some garlic with salt and pepper.

This was very good. I failed to take bacon out of the freezer so it wasn't wrapped. (I will wrap it next time to try the intended flavor) I seasoned the chicken with salt and pepper and added a little Parmesan cheese to the filling. I also put a touch of bacon grease on top of the chicken for that bacon flavor (no butter). There was no bacon flavor from that experiment, just some added fat. Lol! Thanks for this recipe. It's a keeper!

We LOVED this. I admit, I changed it up, merely because I was going to make chicken cordon bleu, only to discover my husband had eaten the ham. So I ran to allrecipes to see what I could make with what I had in the house. This was it! A total winner, and a great recipe that can easily accommodate whatever ingredients you have on hand. Thanks for sharing!

Amazing. SO AMAZING. I left out the chives, and added onion powder, black pepper and cayenne pepper. Also left off the bacon and butter. Dipped in eggs and Italian seasoned bread crumbs.

Great recipe- changed it up a bit.  Used 8 chicken tenderloins (could have used 10), coated them with butter, dipped them in Italian style breadcrumbs, spooned some of the mixture on one tenderloin and put another on top.  Didn't use any toothpicks, didn't use any bacon.  Baked for around 30 mins (didn't time it, just watched the chicken until it looked done).  Came out fantastic.  I also didn't exactly measure the chives or garlic, but I think I put a little extra then what was called for.  I used pre-chopped garlic in oil.  It was delicious.  Will definitely make again!!!

I made this recipe as something quick for tonights dinner.  I read the reviews, however, decided to follow the exact recipe. I feel as though there was only a slight flavor to the inside mixture.  The chicken was juicy, but overall the recipe was bland.  I wil definitely try this recipe again, adding some bread crumbs, maybe cooked bacon in small pieces and coat the chicken before.

This meal turned out great. It was my first time cooking stuffed chicken. I made a few changes...I used chive and onion cream cheese for convenience then added mozz cheese to the mixture as well as black pepper.  I cooked the bacon on the stove top to have it crisp and then I rolled the entire chicken breast in roasted garlic bread crumbs.  It was fantastic and my boyfriend loved it! I served with garlic mashed potatoes and asparagus.

These were delicious. I used a little bit of a mayo and butter mixture (about 3tsp of each) to spread over the chicken and bacon then sprinkled some parm cheese on top before baking. The mayo/butter mixture with the parm makes the bacon nice and crispy and creates a yummy thin layer of crust.

Loved it! It is now a regular at my house. Loved it so much my kids are begging for me to make it again. I think the only thing I would do is try to brown the chicken a little by covering it in bread crumbs or cheese.

Very yummy, very easy!  I was only cooking for the 2 of us, so here's what I did.  Mixed up some light crm cheese (no where close to an 8 oz pkg, just a couple of scoops) with some fresh chives and a clove of garlic.  Added a bit of fresh parm and grated mozz to the mix.  I did sautee my turkey bacon for a couple minutes per side and then wrapped around my stuffed chicken.  Baked covered for 30 mins and then uncovered for 8-10.  Turned out great, nice flavour and not too much filling (some people had noted how 'rich' it was).  Very adaptable recipe!

The only thing I did differently was to use fresh chives. If I were to make it again, though, I would dip it in egg and Panko crumbs for a bit of a crunch. But anyway, this was very rich and satisfying. Thanks!

This was wonderful!  Kind of feel guilty eating it, as it's so decadent and not the healthiest of recipes, but I quickly got over that!  I chopped up some bacon and fried it, and folded it into the chive and cream cheese mixture.  What can I say...I love bacon, so this recipe was definitely for me!  If you have a bacon lover, this is a MUST.  Well...even if you don't have a bacon lover, it's a MUST!

I used the basic concept, but I used onion & chive cream cheese with minced garlic and other seasonings, rolled with one piece of bacon each way so the cream cheese didn't run out. I sprinkled the top with basil and rosemary, and shredded cheese in the last 5 minutes. My hubby loved it, and I thought it was good, but not quite 5 stars for me.

I gave this recipe a five star rating because of its versatility. The great thing about a dish like this is you can substitute ingredients you have on hand, or things you really like, in place of things you don't have/like, and it will still turn out great. Below are the changes I made to the recipe: I added way more garlic and took out the bacon (I only had the microwave stuff.) To the cream cheese mixture I added Italian seasoning, seasoned salt and finely chopped walnuts. I made a separate mixture of panko bread crumbs, chopped walnuts and garlic salt, put a thin layer on the bottom of the baking dish, then placed the stuffed breasts on top, then sprinkled with the remaining bread crumb mixture. My husband had a stomach ache and wasn't hungry for much - he ate his whole breast and probably would have eaten the rest of mine had I let him. Next time, I will try adding blue or feta cheese to the cream cheese mixture for an even more flavorful experience!

This was very good, but when I make it again (and I will) I will ad some garlic and spice it up a little. It just needs a little tweek to be 5 star. The wife and kids all though it was great.

I wasn't terribly impressed with this one.  The chicken was a bit bland, but that's probably because I left off the bacon.  I might try it again with the bacon and add some herbs and more garlic.

This entree was scrumptious!  I used this recipe for a dinner party, and it was a hit!  The only ingredient that I added was garlic pepper (a dash) to each breast.  Everyone asked for the recipe!

My husband and I love this recipe! I am a very picky eater (but love garlic) and even I thought it was divine!  The only change we have is that we normally add a splash of white wine in the bottom of dish.

This was a hit with my family!  I did as suggested, and did half cream cheese and half mozzarella, it was great!  I also suggest using prosciutto ham instead of bacon, I've done both ways and the prosciutto gives it much more flavor.  Have made this many times, and will continue to do so!

I just used Alouette and maple flavored bacon. This wasn't too bad. Might make again.

I have made this recipe many times over the last couple years. It always tastes so good at the start of the cold weather! Last night I decided to mix it up a little bit and maybe some of you might like this as well. I started by cubing my bacon and chicken (fairly small) and frying separately. While they were cooking I mixed up the cream cheese. I then drained the bacon and set the chicken aside to cool a bit. I whipped out two cans of crescent rolls and proceeded to make something similar to a calzone. Each container of rolls makes 2 calzones out of 4 rectangles. Start our by separating the dough into 4 rectangles and make sure to pinch together the seams on both sides of the dough. On two rectangles spread the cream cheese mixture making sure to leave some room at the edges. Then sprinkle the top with bacon and then chicken. I then topped this off with a little bit of mozzarella cheese. After the filling is in place take the other rectangles and place it on top. Pinch together all along the sides making sure there is a good seal. Open the other container of cresent rolls and repeat. When you are finished you should have 4 “calzones”. Bake at 375 for 10 to 13 minutes. This was so yummy.

MADE THIS AGAIN IT WAS THAT GOOD!  MY COMPANY MADE PIGS OF THEMSELVES EATING LAST NIGHT!  OH MY GOODNESS!  This was wonderful, I did change the recipe just alittle.  I added in about 1 cup of shredded mozzerella cheese (bad spelling) to the cream cheese mixture and them just before the chicken was ready to come out, I added a a thick slice of mozz.cheese and melted it.  It was really good, please try this recipe, you really can't be disappointed!

This is a great quick and easy recipe to prepare, and although I am vegetarian, the rest of the family gave it a thumbs up. I let it sit for a few minutes, then sliced the chicken breasts before serving.

The bacon gave it a nice flavor but chicken could've used done seasoning before wrapping in bacon. Salt and pepper at the very least. Cream cheese mixture was good!

I realized that I had chicken strips instead of breasts, so I layered the chicken, cream cheese filling, and chicken.  In retrospect, I would have pounded the chicken flatter.  Other than that, it was awesome.  My family is asking for it again very soon.

Actually have made a version of this numerous times but with creative differences.  First off,  you have to go all in... turkey bacon wil always have to make way for the real thing... pork bacon.  We simplify also with name brand cream cheese spreads with a variation at times between Onion & Chive or Garlic & Garden Herb.  Have gone insane with a slice of prosciutto or a spiced ham now and again.  Thanks for the creative license!

Made as per the recipe. Really wish I had read the reviews prior to making. Chicken was bland. Cream cheese mix was bland. Bacon was just a soggy mess. The recipe should really talk about precooking the bacon and seasoning the chicken.

So good. I loved the filling, but it was a tad too sweet for me, so I added some garlic powder and salt (yes, I know that there's already garlic in there, but I love me some garlic).
The filling is definitely that. Filling. I recommend using about 2/3 the amount that's called for, it will still be enough to fill the chicken, but not too much to make you have cream cheese coming out of your ears.

This  recipe  was  just  okay.  Amazingly  I  actually  made  it  as  written  except  I  didn't  use  bacon  because  I  didn't  have  any  and  because  my  husband  wouldn't  eat  it  if  I  did.   The  main  reason  I  can't  give  this  more  than  3  stars  is  because  the  chicken  didn't  have  any  seasoning  and  I  wasn't  bright  enough  to  figure  that  out  on  my  own.   Hubby  did  like  it  though.

Next time, I want to take another reviewer's advice and cook the bacon a bit before wrapping it over the chicken. It wasn't done enough for our tastes. Also, I just eye-balled the cream cheese mixture to taste, added chives and steamed asparagus inside. Melted about 2 T butter and added minced garlic to that, and poured it over the chicken breasts. Yum!

This was amazing!  My husband, who generally turns his nose up at baked chicken, gave this a two thumbs up!  I made it exactly as the recipe is written!  You can definitely use different spices in your cream cheese to change this up, but it was great made straight from the recipe.

Made this last night however I read most of the reviews and did the following:
Mixture had chive/herb cream cheese, finely shredded mozz, grated parm, onion & garlic powder, minced garlic, bacon pcs, pepper and bread crumbs. After I stuffed and closed the pcs of chicken I dunked them in milk then bread crumbs w/grated parm in it. Was amazing!!!!!

Some of the reviews here are not for this recipe but for creations of their own making. I made the recipe exactly as written. I thought it was good but not fantastic. The turkey bacon was soft and added moisture and flavor to the chicken since turkey bacon tends to not crisp up like pork bacon so I didn't expect this to be super crispy. The chicken was very moist and the filling was creamy but it needed a little something else to give it a boost. I added salt and pepper on top of the chicken but it could have used a rub or poultry seasoning or something to kick up the flavor profile. It was quick, easy and used ingredients I had on hand so that works for me. All in all a good solid dish.

Yum! I halved the recipe, used regular bacon, and precooked the bacon a little bit so that it would be crispy. Also, my chicken was pretty big so it took about 45-50 minutes to cook. Thanks for sharing!

Great recipe! I changed quite a few things however...I used mozzarella instead of cream cheese and used a corn flake crust. After coating the chicken i added the stuffing, then wrapped bacon to hold the breast together....delicious!

Overall the recipe was pretty good, but very bland.  I followed the recipe exactly until the end.  I sprinkled some Adobo and pepper onto the chicken.  It still turned out pretty bland, but it was good.

This is one great recipe!  It needed a little extra seasoning, so I added salt, pepper, garlic powder, and onion powder to the chicken.  Everyone loved it!

The cream cheese "stuffing" was a little too much. I like the idea of whipping it up with something else so that it's not so "hard."  Maybe using "whipped cream cheese" instead of the block would be better.  Or maybe spreading the cream cheese on the breasts instead of rolling the breast around a little chunk of cream cheese would be better.  Also, one strip of bacon (semi-cooked) around each breast wasn't quite enough.  Sprinkle each breast with some chopped, cooked bacon.  This is one of those recipes that is great as a leftover.  I tried it with both rice and egg noodles.  I prefer it with parslied noodles.

This recipe turned out so good for dinner my boyfriend declared it the best chicken he has ever eaten. We did not have any garlic or chives handy at the time so we substituted in sauteed onions and garlic powder. We also took the advice of another reviewer and added bacon bits into the cream cheese mixture. Excellent recipe, thanks!

this wasnt bad, but honestly it was too bland for me even after seasoning the chicken breast before baking. i did do half cream cheese and half mozzarella, then even sprinkled parm on top. had to cook for 45 mins at 350 degrees. it was still very pink after 30!

For some reason I wasn't too impressed with this recipe.  I followed it exactly and it just didn't taste that great. I should have read the reviews and seasoned the chicken, that may have helped.

Great recipe, and simple.  Dish is very tasty and not too rich, as I initially was afraid it would be.  The only reason I'm not giving full 5 stars is because I modified a bit: added a little salt to chicken to taste and also added garlic -- about 5 cloves, minced, instead of just one.  Those gave a nice kick to it.  Would make again.

Pretty good.  Left off the bacon and browned for about 10 minutes before putting in the oven.  Also mixed the leftover cream cheese with a bit of spicy mustard and some  rosemary.  Next time I would not use as much cream cheese and maybe roll in breadcrumbs before cooking.

My husband and I loved this dish (and I even overcooked the chicken a little). I substituted cheddar for the chives but I think adding any of your favorite herbs to the cream cheese would be a good thing.  I plan to keep making it different each time. Great starter recipe!

I hesitate to give this a rating because I didn't follow this to the T. I gave this dish a 4 star rating only because of that fact. After reading several reviews, this is what I did with great success.
I rinsed pounded my chicken breasts thin in a ziplock bag. Dried them off and added a cream cheese mixture... I used cream cheese, grated cheddar cheese & a TBS of spice mixture. (I have many different flavors of these dry "dip" packets that I bought from a local craft show. The ones you mix with 1C of mayo & 1C of sourcream. Well, I used the spicy Habenero flavored one and I have also used the sun dried tomato one). I put the cream cheese mixture in the center of the chicken and wrap the chicken breast around it to seal. I then place them on a plate, cover and fridgerate for 15 min. (This will keep them firm and from falling apart.) I then slather them with a thin layer of mayo (sounds discusting, but works great) and then roll them in seasoned bread crumbs. I bake on a oil sprayed sheet for 25 min. Tastes so unbelievably good! The seasoned cream cheese makes all the difference.

What a great recipe! The cream cheese mixed with the chive is extremely good. I made a few alterations since I didn't have sliced bacon available. I replaced it with crumbled bacon and added it to the cream cheese / chive mixture. I also added one finely chopped jalapeno pepper to the mixture and the taste of it was very good.  I sprinkled a bit of lemon-pepper on top of the stuffed chicken breast! What a fanastic taste!

I made some alterations as suggested by others and it turned out wonderful!  My entire family loved it.  Maybe this will help others:  first flash pan fry the chicken breasts in olive oil to sear and brown with salt pepper sprinkled to taste.  save the olive oil drippings and prepare the stuffing.  To the stuffing, add the chives, 3 garlic cloves (if you love garlic flavors), and pieces of bacon, a little salt and fresh pepper.  Wrap the stuffed chicken with sliced ham then place on lightly greased baking pan.  Drizzle olive oil drippings over the prepared chicken and sprinkle with a little bacon pieces.  Bake as directed.  This should give you great results!

Really good recipe. You don't really have to use all the cream cheese mixture. This can be fairly healthy using lowfat cream cheese and skinless chicken breasts. Reminds me of a dish served at Ruths Chris!

This was really rich... I added spinach and I cut up the bacon and mixed it in with the cream cheese.  I also browned the chicken breast before stuffing it so it looked a little better. I think I will try it with the mozzarella next time.  Great flavor just too rich.

Good, but if I used all the cream cheese I think it would have been too much.  Did as others suggested used 1/2 mozzarella instead.  Sprinkled top with a little Parmesean & added little white wine in baking dish.  Also fried the bacon a little initially.

Yummy recipe! I used fresh chives from the garden (a BIG bunch, probably about 6 tblsp) I didn't have the the baccon, so I just left out that part. Also, instead of topping the chicken with butter, I topped it with some nice motzza, which got nice and crispy as it cooked. Served with scalloped potatoes and carrots. Yum! :)

This recipe was ok....I would reduce the amount of cream cheese to half, and definately increase the cooking temperature to 400F. I found the cream cheese filling over-powering.

Wonderful recipe!  My whole family loved it.  I did replace turkey bacon with regular pork bacon and I seasoned the outside of the chicken with garlic, salt, and pepper.  Also I added dried onion flakes to the cream cheese mixture.

This recipe is fabulous. Try this recipe also by using a pepperidge farm pastry sheet, spread it out real thin and place chicken in the middle. Then close the pastry around the chicken and brush on some egg white. It tastes awesome with pork as well!

Pretty tasty.  I added some dried parsley, some garlic powder in addition to the 2 cloves of minced garlic I used, and a dash of paprika.  I also added in some grated Monterey Jack cheese and some swiss cheese.  Finally, I also caramelized some onions and served them on top.  Went great with asparagus.

This was very tasty. I have made it several times, even though it's quite fattening. I use low-fat cream cheese to help a bit. I find that I also have to cook mike for longer than 30 minutes.

I don't know what everyone else saw in this recipe.  My husband and I both thought it was awful.  It never really looked done because it was so pale and white.  Because of this I overcooked it.  It still wouldn't have been ok because we just didn't like the taste.

Sorry, but I wasn't crazy about this.  I followed recipe exactly, except used real bacon and omitted butter as some suggested.  My family didn't mind it, but I don't think they would miss it if I don't make again.  I think adding some extra spices may help.

This dish was so easy & good! I loved it and I finally found something different to do that my husband liked. I also added some mozzarella to the cream cheese & chive mixture. I used 2 slices of turkey bacon instead of 1, but the cream cheese still ran out a little bit. For a quick dish this is great. I served it with wild rice & steamed veggies. Thanks for a quick, easy, & tasty dish!!

This was really good. it looked so good i thought i could eat so much. i could only eat half of my piece of chicken but it was soooo good. I used fresh chives instead of the dried and couldnt really taste them so it might be better to used dried. i also used more bacon and it didnt cook properly. next time i will follow the recipe exactly.

mmmm. i had a roomate once who was in culinary arts and she use to make this all the time. so good. we were having my husbands parents over and were BBQ'ing. we decided to try this over the BBQ. i soaked the bacon in water, oil, and a clove of garlic for a couple of hours before hand so they wouldnt burn too fast. it worked great. i also added the herb and garlic cream cheese mixed with regular to add a little more flavour. it turned out great, and the compliments proved it! i also added green onion in with the mix. mmmm. cheers.

Extremely rich food, but this recipe was awesome!  I'm a new cook and appreciated how easy it was to make yet how fancy it looks on the plate.  

My partner loved it (he's very picky about things like this).

I paired it with mixed veggies and a french loaf w/ oil. I used 3 strips of turkey bacon per chicken piece to hold in the filling.  Also I used fresh chives b/c they were cheaper but it tasted great anyway.  Not the healthiest meal but i'll make it again.

This recipe rocks!  My husband and son loved it.  I did use the crean cheese with the chives already in it to make it easier.  I also used real bacon and a little more than the recipe calls for.  I had a hard time securing the chicken so the cheese would not melt out.  All in all, it tasted great.  Could be lower in fat if you use fat free cream cheese.

This recipe was ok, but nothing special.  The problem was that the cream cheese/chive/garlic stuffing is boring.  To add some flavor, I'd substitute some swiss or other distinct cheese, and some extra garlic and chives.

This was pretty good, although I made the mistake of only using 2 chicken breasts, so it was much too cream cheesy. My hubby didn't care for this, but I liked the flavor.

The chives seemed to really dominate teh taste of this meal.  It was too thick with cheese.  I need to think of a way to add different flavors.

I'm glad to have another yummy low-carb recipe to add to my collection. The only problem I had with this recipe was that I had to cook it longer than specified, and the bacon didn't crisp enough. I broiled it a bit to crisp it up. Make sure you secure the ends of the breasts well, because I didn't and my cream cheese leaked out. I also added salt and pepper to the chicken. Thanks for submitting this recipe!

This was yummy!  The whole family loved it!  I used chive cream cheese to save time, and real bacon because I don't care for turkey bacon, so then omitted the melted butter.  I also used extra bacon to hold in the cheese.  Seved with wild rice and grilled asparagus with lemon-perfect dinner!  Thanks!

This was wonderful! My husband and I are doing low-carb right now and this recipe is perfect. The only thing was that when I checked it at 30 minutes the chicken was still slightly pink so I had to leave it in for about 15 more minutes. We will definitely try this again soon!

I thought this was wonderful, especially because I eat low-carb style.  I substituted 2 chopped scallions because I didn't have chives, and it was very good.  Also, since I really didn't want the cheese to melt out while baking, I used extra strips of bacon to securely wrap the chicken. A+++++++  Thank you!
