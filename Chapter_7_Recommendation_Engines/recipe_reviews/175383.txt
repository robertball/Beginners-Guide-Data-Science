I used this recipe simply as a base for when I made it. The shrimps should be pulled straight out of the freezer, and fried right in butter and olive oil (put the oil in first then add the butter so the butter doesn't burn) until the shrimps are pink (you don't need to boil them at all, and this way they'll taste and look better anyway). Then instead of linguini use angel hair pasta and it'll go a lot better with the shrimp. Just make sure you remove the shrimp shells. I forgot to do this and my date had to pick them off individually before she ate them :)

We served this on Christmas Eve and everyone loved it.  I made a few changes.  I used 2 Lbs. of Shrimp (the frozen precooked kind and it was fine), increased the wine to 1 C and reduced the lemon juice to 2 Tbsps as suggested in other reviews.  The rest of the recipe I kept the same.  The flavor was great!

This recipe was delicious but I made extensive changes.  First off, I reduced the amount of shrimp by about 3/4.  Then I removed the shrimp after cooking them so they didn't overcook.  Then I sauteed artichoke hearts, sliced caper berries, capers, and finely minced green peppercorns in the pan.  Then I added zucchini.  Finally seared the tomatoes and then th

Excellent! A couple recommended changes: 1) Go easy on the pasta. 1lb is too much. Try 3/4lb. 2) I love this with scallops! Be sure to start the scallops in the butter/oil a little before you add the shirmp. The scallops take longer to cook than shrimp.

Delicious!  I used frozen pre-cooked shrimp and reduced the cooking time, increased the amount of garlic and reduced the amount of linguini.  I also eliminated the red pepper (too hot).  It turned out as a very succesful dinner.

My husband and step-daughter said this was dish phenomenal.  I did make a couple of minor changes though.  I added two diced scallions when I added the garlic to the butter and olive oil.  I may add a third next time.  Per other’s advice, I used about half as much lemon as the recipe called for.  I added an additional 1/4 teaspoon of red pepper flakes.  I added a wine slurry (additional 1/4 cup of wine and a tablespoon of corn starch) after the tomatoes had been in about a minute to thicken up the sauce along with three extra pads of butter (margarine).  I served it over angel hair because that's my family's preference.  Side salads and roasted garlic baguette . . . this is definitely a keeper for my family.

I really enjoyed this, but my husband wished it had a creamier based sauce.... I subsituted frozen cooked shrimp and just let them defrost fully in the white wine tomatoe sauce, etc. I also used dried parsley because that's what I had.  And also diced tomatoes in a can. Loved that i could improv with what i had and it was still yummy. But i'm a big fan of white wine and garlic sauces.

It needed a little more flavor, but I used plenty of pecorino reggiano cheese so it was really good. However, if I didn't use it, it would have needed something else, maybe Mrs. Dash original. That has no sodium and does add plenty of flavor.  This was a good recipe. I will defenitly use it again. Thanks

The flavor was excellent and the sauce did well even into leftovers the next day. Next time I will only use a 1/2 box of linguini and a little more shrimp and tomatoes. I served this to friends and ended up with a lot of plates with just sauce and no shrimp.

Disappointed with this recipe. Even though I cut the lemon down after reading other reviews, it was still too lemony and water.

Very good.  Followed directions on package for cooking pasta.  Would cut back a bit on the lemon. Followed suggestion to heat oil then add butter (great idea).  Did not cook shrimp 4 to 5 minutes but stirred continually and added other ingredients when shrimp turned pink.

My boyfriend and I made this last night and it was GREAT! We scaled down the servings to 2, used half a box of angel hair instead of linguine, and 1 tablespoon of lemon juice. Definitely making this again.

Made this for dinner last night.  It was so good.  I followed the recipe exactly but I did add a lot more garlic.  I will be making this a lot more times. Thanks for the excellent recipe. Everyone said it was fantastic!!!!!

Simple, tasty recipe.  I added a dash of Pickapeppa and a dash of cayenne pepper for some zip, and used canned diced tomatoes to make it saucier.  Definitely cut back on the lemon juice, and watch the shrimp so it doesn't overcook.  I also added fresh zuchinni.  I will definitely make this again, but will get fresh seasonings, and maybe try adding some pesto and omitting the other stuff I added.  Angel hair or thin spaghetti works best.

Way to much lemon juice.  If I make this again I will half the lemon juice.  I added a lot more spices since the original taste was really bland.  Sorry.

I tried this  as written and found the shrimp to get really over-done by the time it was ready to serve.  I would recommend taking the shrimp out of the pan after they turn pink,  in 2-3 minutes,  and then return them to the pan at the end with the tomatoes for that last 1 minute warm up.   Overall a quick and tasty meal though.

I made the recipe exactly as written except for using jumbo shrimp (raw) and angel hair pasta. Delicious!!! Very easy to put together for a week-night dinner. Left-overs were good, although the shrimp got a bit tough with re-heating. We are big fans of garlic and lemon, so didn't find these flavors too strong. This recipe can be easily tweaked for personal preferences. My husband wants me to make this very frequently! Goes well with a fresh green salad for a light dinner.

My daughter and I have made this at least 5 times now, so thought it was time to give my $.02. Great recipe - better than any other scampi's I've had at nice restaurants, and we've perfected it!  A half pound of pasta is plenty, and half as much lemon juice (thinking the poster meant 1/4 cup?). Sautee a couple Tblsp. finely chopped onion with the garlic, and  a Tblsp. of  capers if you have them - really adds something special.

Very good! Hubby & I enjoyed it a lot! My husband likes a bit more sauce than the recipe called for, so I added a can of diced tomatoes to it and it was superb!

This recipe was not good at all.  I used white wine as stated, a chardonnay, and it was unpleasantly flowery.  Be careful with what wine you use for this recipe.

I agree with Pattiann.  This recipe had way too much lemon.  My son loves shrimp, and he wouldn't even eat it because it was so lemony. I'd cut back significantly.

Followed the recipe exactly. It was good but next time I’ll use half the amount of both lemon juice and tomatoes and twice as much cheese.

I enjoyed this, but I made a few changes. I used 1/4 cup lemon juice, and it was still extremely lemony. A bit much for my partner and I, unfortunately. The shrimp were overcooked, I would recommend adding them later than the recipe says to. I  also used dairy free 'butter' because I can't have dairy, and the sauce still had a nice consistency. Overall, I liked this recipe and will likely use it as a base in the future.

Delicious!  Hubby and I loved it and I will definitely make this again.  I didn’t have any lemon on hand, but will be sure to get it for the next time.  Also, I added asparagus which worked well with the other ingredients.  I picked fresh parsley, basil and arugula from my garden and chopped this all up and added it during the last few minutes.  Great!

Easy to make and delicious. Substituted fresh chopped parsley for basil ( did not have any) and italian diced tomatoes, and added some lemon zest and pink peppercorns. Husband loved!!!! Used chardonnay for wine.

I make shrimp scampi often and usually different every time.  I liked the addition of the grape tomatoes.  I recommend cutting way back on the lemon juice and if you want a truly Italian dish, dump the cheese.  Fish and cheese are never never combined in Italian cooking.

This was fantastic! I made it last night and my husband and I loved it. I just finished leftovers for lunch. The only thing I changed was to put extra red pepper flakes in it. We like it spicy. Other than that I wouldn't change a thing! I will make this often!

I added a little less lemon like the reviews had said but kind of wish I added a bit more. Also, lowered amount of garlic but I think I will do the original amount next time! It was pretty good. But I do think it needs so improvements so I will try it again sometime!

So I tried it again and it was soo much better! Did 1/3 cup of lemon juice, used italian seasoning rather than basil, and added in three sausages (sliced), it was delicious! I also did the full 6 cloves of garlic. Will make again!

Perfect, will make it again!
My family told me it is like the the one you get in fine restaurants.
Only 2 changes:  1 tbs. cornstarch to make the sauce thicker, and half the lemon juice.

I cut the butter and oil in half, since the calories in this recipe are pretty high. I would suggest reducing the cooking time on the shrimp as mine turned out overcooked. The dish was flavorful but next time I will definitely cook the shrimp only a few minutes. I thought there was too much lemon juice and the sauce was a bit runny, so next time I would try only 1/4 cup lemon juice. I ended up adding a tablespoon of cornstarch to thicken up the sauce.I used drained canned diced tomatoes in place of the grape tomatoes.

I prepared everything ahead so I wasn't rushing to get the ingredients ready to add to the  shrimp.  I used frozen extra large shrimp, precooked, and defrosted them before adding to liquid mixture.  I did not cook the shrimp more than 1-2 minutes.  I did not have any fresh herbs on hand so used dried ones. I also did not use hot pepper flakes but rather paparika,  Also as someone suggested I used less lemon did not have a fresh one so used the liquid squeeze one.  I did have  too much pasta so would cut down.  Otherwise it was very good and will make again.

I made this recipe almost as is except I didn't have any fresh basil so I used dried and I left out the red pepper flakes and tomatoes. the little changes I made I do not see making a huge difference and can imagine how it would taste with them. the only thing I did was add some lemon zest with the shrimp I zested about a half a large lemon and used that. I imagine it would have been just as good with out but I like that slight extra bit of lemon kick :)

Loved it!  Easy to make!  I didn't realized that I was out of lemon juice but after reading other comments about reducing the amount of lemon, I omitted the lemon.  It was still delicious!

Loved this recipe! Very easy to prepare, it's the perfect scampi recipe. Used 1/2 the lemon juice.

Oooooooh...so delicious! Took advice and used less lemon. When I do it again I will add the whole pint of tomatoes.   Also, be careful not to put the shrimp in any longer than specified. They cook quick. Served over fresh angel hair. Whoa! And smells sensational when simmering.

We liked this recipe a lot, I've tried it with the wine and I have also used chicken broth for a substitute. I used light stick butter the last time we made it and it tasted just as good.

Loved it!! Followed the recipe exactly.  DH loves pastas with olive oil and butter-type sauces and he thought this was fabulous. I'll be making this often!!
