A yummy soup indeed!

I must note, however, to make this truly suited for a vegetarian diet, I omitted the brown sauce and worcestershire sauce. (Brown sauce is traditionally beef-based and worcestershire contains anchovies.) I compensated with a little extra garlic and cilantro.

This wasn't exactly like the traditional carrot and coriander soup I was looking for (probably because of the tomatoes), but it did turn out very tasty. We enjoyed mopping it up with bread, and it was even better on the third (!) day. Will make it again, thanks.

I made this soup for a dinner party for 30 people and they raved about it! They all came back for seconds and I didnt have a drop left over.

DO NOT use a food processor to puree this...it will end up chunky which is appealing neither to the eye nor the palate.  A blender with "liquefy" will probably work.  Please note though, this is not so much a carrot soup as it is a tomato soup with a carrot-y aftertaste.  Thank goodness I served this on the side of "Pico de Gallo Chicken Quesadillas" from this site (*****) or dinner would have been a disaster.

Wow! The flavors are so fresh and bright. It's more like a tomato soup, though. I used whole milk instead of cream to cut the calories. Didn't use brown sauce - I had no idea what that was until I googled it. I wonder if it's even sold in the U.S.

Pretty good carrot soup. I didn`t use a balsamic vinegar and I used less onion.

Pretty good but it seemed like it was missing something. My boyfriend added some nutmeg to his bowl but I personally didn't care for that. Not sure if I would make it again.

Absolutely delicious. Didn't have the cream and used milk instead and found it really tasty.

Mmmmmm, this is so delicious! I made it for my lunch tomorrow, but now I can't stop eating it! I used chicken broth instead of veggie, and homemade hot sauce instead of the chile pepper, as that's what I had on hand. I could actually imagine using this as a pasta sauce, only pureeing it a little so that it is still quite chunky. Thanks so much, Jon!

I made some changes: I used only two fourteen oz cans of diced tomatoes (one of them fire roasted with green chiles). I used about 7 carrots, 2 cups of veggie broth (instead of one), one onion (instead of two), a shallot, a stalk of celery and no red pepper or brown sauce. Even with using significantly less tomatoes, I felt the tomato flavor overpowered the carrot flavor. It was still a very delicious tomato, carrot and cilantro soup.

Real easy and very tasty. A quick treat to whip up for my vegan pals. I'm going to serve the rest over rice and fried fish tonight.

Not what I was expecting form the name...took some getting used to at first. The pepper certainly gives it a mexican flare. Can't decide if I will make again. Won't be what I will use for my "carrot" soup however. Taste is quite good though.

The best soup I have made yet everyone loved it and asked for more. I never added the cream but stired in a bit of cream fraiche as I served it which looked and tasted great. Can't wait to make it again Thanks.

I loved this but husband didnt like it at all- he thought it was too much like a "sauce" rather than a soup.  I disagree but thought it fair to present 2 differing opinions! On the upside, this means it is also FAB as a sauce for pasta etc, as already commented by a reviewer!

This soup is amazing! I only had 1 400g (14 ounce)tin of tomatoes, so I used a litre (2.1 pints) of low salt vege stock instead. It's a lovely thick soup with a great texture. added a little extra cream at the end as our chilli was a burner!! Will definitely make again.
