Light, fresh and quite elegant.  I decreased the oil in the vinaigrette to 1/4 cup...and the sugar to 1/2 t. Then I used just enough oil in the pan to lightly coat the pan for frying. This could be served in the finest restaurant.  The ginger, lemon and cayenne is a great combination...no more cocktail sauce crab cakes in this establishment.  This is a 5 star+

My first  try ever making crab cakes.  These are delicious.  What a nice bit of heat from the ginger, cayenne and jalapeno.  I struggled with the cooking process but that's inexperience.  Used 2 spatulas for turning and removing from the pan.  The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars is that I had to add a LOT more lemon juice to the vinaigrette.  Next time I'd use 1/4 cup of oil instead of 3/4.  Personal taste....
