This recipe is quick and easy but needed a little seasoning to make it 5 star.  I added 1 tsp. chili powder, 1/2 tsp. cumin and 1/2 tsp. cayenne pepper to give it some extra flavor.  Used Portuguese sausage and my family loved it.  Great for busy nights with little time to cook.  Might try diced tomatoes with jalepenos next time.  Overall very good.

This was sooo good!! I followed some of the advice of the reviewers, and changed the recipe some. I'm so glad I made this! My changes: skipped the onion, sauteed a little bit of frozen diced green pepper. It seemed like a lot of sausage for just 1 can of kidney beans, so I used 2 cans of light red kidney beans. I used 1 can of petite diced tomatoes, drained the can into the pan and only used half of the tomatoes (my preference). I added the following seasonings while everything was simmering: garlic powder, creole seasoning, cayenne pepper and oregano. I can't wait to have leftovers for dinner this evening! Yum!

This recipe was good, I added some parsley, cayenne pepper, thyme, sage and some cajun seasoning that another recipe suggested.  I also used a red pepper instead of a green pepper and it was great.  A big hit!  Really good served with Corn Bread.

Fast, easy, and good.  I used a whole pepper instead of 1/2.  I wish I had read the other reviews and added a bit more seasoning. Makes great left-overs!

This is a good base recipe and with some changes my family loved it. Instead of butter I used olive oil. I replaced the tomatoes with diced tomatoes with green chiles, added about half a cup of water and added a can of pinto beans along with the kidney beans (the only other kind I had). I seasoned it with garlic powder, black pepper, salt, cumin and green chile powder and before serving I stirred the rice into the bean mixture.

Really liked this recipe! Took advice from others and added some spice--1/2 tsp cumin, 1/2 tsp chile powder, and 1/4 tsp. cayenne pepper. I also used red pepper instead of green. What I loved about this recipe was that it was so fast to throw together.

Amazing and easy!  I used Eckrich beef smoked sausage, two cans of beans (one red kidney and one pinto since that's what I had on hand) and instead of the tomatoes and bell pepper I used one can of mild Rotel.  Added Chili powder, cayenne pepper, garlic, and a dash of cumin.  Wonderful! Will definitely be making this one again.

I felt there weren't enough beans compared to the sausage, the rice servings are skimpy, and it definitely needed some sort of flavor boost.  I would throw some minced garlic in with the onion and pepper saute, and also add some Cajun or Creole seasoning for next time.  Smoked sausage is great, but it doesn't provide enough flavor to carry the whole dish on its own.

Good!  For my tweaks I cooked the rice in the broth from a can of French Onion Soup, reserving the onions to add into the dish later.  I used the broth from the soup mixed with water to come up to the quantity needed to cook the rice.  Also added some bannana peppers for a little zing.

I made this for dinner last night when it was almost time for bed because my husband and I needed to eat some real food before we went to bed, so it had to be quick and easy. I had all the ingredients on hand. I spiced up the cooking vegetables with creole and cajun seasoning and salt and pepper. When it was done it tasted great, and there's enough leftovers for a few people to enjoy.

Not nearly enough beans and they don't get creamed. It works as a way to make plain sausage more interesting, but I wouldn't call it red beans and rice.

This was just ok. I made it to go with my boyfriends jerk chicken, which was really nice and spicy. I needed to add chili powder, cumin, and cayenne pepper to make it taste alright. Also cooked the rice in chicken stock for more flavor. Needed to cook it quite a bit in order to get the beans as soft as we thought they should be.

This was AWESOME! 
Here are the changes I made: 
1) Used 1 T unsalted butter & 1 T evoo
2) Omitted onion & used whole bell pepper diced finely.
3) 3 cans of beans instead of 1 (next time I will try using a whole bag of dried beans which would be equivalent to 4 cans beans. It would stretch it & make it a more thrifty meal in general.)
4) added 8 oz can No Salt Added Tomato sauce
5) Used the "onion, celery, pepper" version of diced tomatoes. 

This was even better the 2nd day after mixing in the rice & letting it sit in the refrigerator overnight. Will definitely make again, thank you! =)

LOVED THIS! Didn't have green pepper, used white kidney beans and brown rice. Delicious. Added just a little bit of pepper and cumin, but I would have still probably given it 5 stars without that.

Very good and filling. Aside from using smoked turkey sausage, these are the changes I made because I didn't want to go to the store.  I used chili beans in mild sauce and drained my diced tomatoes.  I used Uncle Ben's 90 second brown rice and mixed it all together after browning sausage, onion and peppers.  Spices added were cayenne pepper, chili powder and cumin.  Delish!

A very good, stick-to-your-ribs, cold-weather recipe.  It's even good without the green pepper.   I know this recipe is of cajun origin, but I had a friend call it "Red Deagon Goulash."  I hadn't  heard of that, found it interesting.  :)    A good recipe, we'll be using it again.

I followed the recipe and this was a TOTAL hit for our family! All the kids loved it, and one of them even had THIRDS! This is a great dish because there is something in it for everyone... you know, the kid that refuses to eat meat, the kid that refuses to eat veggies, etc- well, in this dish everyone has something they love- and they all taste wonderful together! Thanks for posting! GREAT meal!

I took the advice of many others before me, and I used tomatos with jalapeños, as well as adding the cayenne pepper, cumin and, chili powder. It turned out very good, I also cooked the rice, and added boullion to the water. i don't like the thought of just plain white rice. With those few changes, It brought this dish from alright to great.

I was craving Red beans and rice so when I saw this recipe and decided to make it ! I didn't have much time... and didn't have any smoked sausage or turkey sausage... and since I had already decided to make tuna fish cakes I thought that I would try this recipe with it as a side. I am glad that I did!  This was awesome.... I did tweak it a little bit  but not that much.... I used 1 can green chiles and tomatoes instead of just diced.... I also added with the green pepper and onion saute some scallions and a splash of white wine; also when beans and sauce mixture was heating thru I threw some  fresh cilantro on it... and when I prepared the rice I added a package of safron. MMM this was good pared with the tuna cakes or even would be delicious on its own with a pan of fresh baked cornbread!   Good quick recipe Diane! Thanx for sharing!!!

This is a great and easy to make meal.  I took the advice of others and did add some cajun spice and instead of diced tomatoes I used stewed tomatoes that I ran through my food processor.  I also used brown rice instead of the white.  Again great meal and easy recipe to make.  Took me about 20 minutes, I will make again and again.

GREAT basic recipe! I give it four stars because I tweaked it.   I generally like to cook my rice separately in a rice cooker. I drained the beans and diced tomatoes and used the liquid to cook the rice. I also added spices as suggested by other posters. I used Emeril's Bayou Blast (contains salt, paprika, garlic powder, cayenne pepper, black pepper, mustard powder, fresh lemon peel, and "other spices."). I'm sure how much I used. I seasoned to taste. I will definitely experiment with the other spice combinations that were suggested.  I served this with a nice helping of corn bread. DELICIOUS!

Delicious! Both by girls ate all of it.  I did not have sausages but had board head petit ham.  I cut them in cubes and used some cajun seasoning mix.  It was delicious served hot with tabasco sauce!

4 stars because, on the recommendation of others who rated this recipe, I did need to add additional seasoning I added 1 t chili powder, 1/2 t ground cumin seed and 1/2 t Ancho chili powder. I also used light smoked sausage to reduce the fat and calories. My whole family loved it including the kids. I will definitely be making this again soon.

This is my 8 yr-old son's favorite dish.  I use a 'healthy' turkey sausage and sometimes add spices and garlic.  It's always a winner.  We top with sour cream and cheese.  It's more like a sausage chili and he always asks for more.

The combined flavors of this dish are delectable!  I use Hillshire Farms pork smoked sausage and red beans instead of kidney beans.  I also add about a qtr tsp each of cumin, cayenne pepper, garlic powder, oregano, blk pepper, and approx a 1/2 tsp of chili powder.  I prefer red bell pepper instead of green and the diced tomatoes I use have green chiles in it which I think really enhances the flavor.  I've also chopped up and added some jarred jalapenos for an added kick...not too much though, maybe about a tblspn worth.  Excellent dish that I'll continue to make and serve many times over!

My boyfriend is always looking for a good soul food meal and this took the win. We both loved it! I let it simmer for about 30 mintues and then mixed it the rice. We ate it with collard greens on the side. The whole meal was excellent.

Outstanding. I doubled the beans and rice, as the recipe called for an imbalance of sausage to beans in my opinion. I also doubled the bell pepper. I added 2 tsp minced garlic, 1 tsp chili powder, 1/2 tsp cumin and 1 tsp Tony Cachere's Creole seasoning. I used Eddy's spicy Yoakum, Texas smoked sausage, which is excellent for this dish, but does add some extra fire. The dish contains a wonderful mix of flavors and textures. Highly recommended.

This recipe is a wonderful start!  It definitely needs some spices... I added cajun seasoning, garlic powder, and cumin.  That made it WONDERFUL.  I also used Rotel instead of canned tomatoes and green peppers.

I made this for dinner tonight, and it was a hit.  I used half a green pepper and half a red pepper instead of just a half a pepper.  I also used italian sausage instead of smoked sausage because i wanted that extra spice.  As suggested by others I added some cayenne pepper and chili powder as well.  I will DEFINITELY be making this again.

I just finished making my version of this recipe and it turned out great.   Here were the changes I made: I used wild rice instead of long-grain I used 1 1/4T veg oil in place of butter I julienned the veggies using 1 onion, 1 green pepper, 1 red pepper and 1 zucchini I also added some chili pepper and cayenne to the saute mixture as suggested by another reviewer.  I really liked the taste and texture of this dish.  Thanks for the recipe "starter":)

My family loves this recipe.   Here are the changes I made to make it vegetarian and a bit more flavorful. I substituted vegetarian meat crumbles for the meat.  I also substituted one tablespoon of butter with 1 tablespoon of EVO and just a drizzle of white truffle oil.  I added vegetable bouillon to the water for the rice and I drained and rinsed the kidney beans before adding them to the mix. I also added 1 tablespoon of Cajun seasoning to the mix once it was simmering.  It turns out just a bit spicy and I think the next time I will add some chopped spinach to make this a one dish meal.  I mix the beans and rice together instead of serving it over the top. There are no leftovers when I make this. It’s fun to watch two rather petite sophisticated women eat this with the gusto of a logger. I wouldn’t even consider going near their plates when they are eating this for fear of being bitten. lol

I used a can of diced tomatoes with green chiles.  I think this would have been quite bland otherwise.  With the added spice in the tomatoes this turned out to be very flavorful and everyone enjoyed and finished their servings.  I will definitely make this again.

My family loves this recipe.  I only make a few changes to it.  I use a whole green pepper instead of 1/2, and while I'm cooking the onions and green pepper I sprinkle a little bit of Tony Chachere's Creole Seasoning on it to give it a extra kick.  ~Beverly

Sort of blah and bland as written, which, considering I have to cook for my grandparents as well is what I was looking for. I add a teensy bit of cayenne just so it's not totally bland to my taste and two or three cloves of garlic. It's not "authentic New Orleans red beans & rice" but that's not what I was looking for. This recipe is an excellent base for cooking for a wide range of spice sensitivities, and easily adapted to be healthier with the substitution of chicken or turkey sausage.

Spectacular and simple recipe. While it in no way resembles red beans and rice like they make in New Orleans, this is still just a top notch recipe.  I followed the advice of other commenters here and added 1/4-1/2 tsp  of cayenne pepper, cumin, garlic powder and chili powder to spice this dish up. Definitely made a difference. I also left out the bell pepper, but it still came out great.  Highly recommended. My boyfriend asked me to cook this again less than a week later.

Very good! I combined a few others suggestions for this quick and easy dinner. I used EVOO instead of butter, red peps, a can of diced tomatoes with green chilies. Added chili powder, a clove of garlic, and some cayenne pepper after I fed my two year old- (who loved it also), and a squeeze of fresh lemon. Ill have to remember this one.  Awesome dinner- thanks!

This was easy to make and I had everything I needed on hand. I added some garlic powder, cumin, salt and black pepper.  This is definitely not gourmet fare, but a nice, filling meal.  I would make this again in a pinch.

This turned out pretty well.  I omitted the tomatoes.  I also forgot to drain the beans so I just boiled the excess liquid off.  I started the rice at the same time as the red bean mixture, and the rice was actually done first.  I thought it would be the other way around.  I also substituted brown rice.  The sausage I used ended up being too spicy, but that's not this recipes' fault.

This is very similar to my way I don't use tomatoes though and I use 1/2 package of smoked sausage, 1 can red or kidney beans undrained i do sautee onions, celery, green pepper first in marg or butter then add beans and my secret is one or two packets of crushed red pepper from the pizza place also I add water 1/2 cup to 1 cup bring to a boil then simmer to consistency I like we make it about once a month I serve it over white rice I cook in my rice cooker.
It's been rumored to get me 2 of 3 husbands. It's cheap easy and quick and spicy, my kids won't eat this so I make this on grown up night or make the kids just sausage and rice which they like just fine.

This recipe was very good.  I have a huge family, so I increased the amount of beans and tomatoes.  I wasn't so sure about the tomatoes in it, but they gave it kick.  I will definitely use this one again!!

This was very easy and my family really liked it. I used canned diced tomatoes with green chilis, added cumin and chili powder and mixed in about a tablespoon of flour before adding the tomatoes to thicken the sauce a bit. Next time I'll use a larger can of red beand and maybe add some garlic, otherwise it was great.

i used crushed(pureed) tomatos instead of what the recipe called for.  regardless it didn't taste very good.  the turkey kielbasa was the best part.

Even better the next day. I added some Zataran's Creole seasoning as well as  Andouille sausage. Used more onion and green pepper (frozen diced as a timesaver). Will make this again for my Mardi Gras gathering.

We can't get New Orleans and Hurricane Katrina off of our minds. We were reminiscing about the wonderful meals that we have had in New Orleans so we decided to make this tonight. This is a great start to a recipe but this is sorely lacking the seasonings! Once we adjusted to taste we were very pleased. We used smoked beef sausage that was delicious. Thanks.

Made this for dinner last night, and enjoyed it with several modifications. I steamed minute rice with chicken stock in the microwave to save time. I also added plenty of spices to punch up the flavor of the main dish: cumin, cayanne pepper, Cajun seasoning, garlic powder, chili powder, two bay leaves, etc. I also doubled the amount of beans and sausage, to ensure leftovers for our family of four. While my 4-year-old son found it a bit spicy, our 1-year-old gobbled it down and ate more from my plate. A hearty, satisfying, quick dinner that turns into a winner with a little jazzing up.

I added 1 shredded chicken breast, 6 ounces of shrimp and diced 1 stalk of celery. I used chicken andouille sausage and used only half the quantity of sausage. So delicious and easy to make! Next time I will probably make with ratio of two cans of beans to 1 cup of rice.

Couldn't have been a faster, easier and tasty meal on a cold night. I did add two cans of beans as others suggested and garlic salt. It's really hearty so we all found the rice was unnecessary which made it healthier.

I confess I did add a clove of minced garlic, as well as some salt and pepper.  I think it would have been a little underseasoned without those, but it was good with those minor additions.  The amount of rice is a bit much compared to everything else unless you want rice to be the main part of the dish.

Tasted more like a chili than red beans and rice after adding the spices. Had to add spice to give it some flavor.

This recipe is quick and very tasty. You can always change the temp by the sausage you use and the tomatoes.

Super simple to make, and easy to customize; I like mine spicy so I used hot chili beans in place of the plain kidney beans and chili-ready tomatoes for diced tomatoes.  I had basmati rice in my pantry, so served it over that, and it was amazing... if I hadn't already filled up on it at dinner (two servings, yum!) I'd be going for more now.  I served this with creole seasoned shrimp, but it would have been fine as a stand-alone meal.

This was terrific, although I too used seasonings to spice things up a bit.  Salt, cayenne, cumin, and garlic.  I also used Smart Balance instead of butter to saute the veggies.  Very tasty and very filling!

Great, quick recipe. I used bacon instead of sausage and mild Rotel instead of tomatoes. Spiced it up with some garlic, black pepper, cumin, oregano. Let it simmer for about an hour and it was delicious!

Made this last night and it turned out pretty good. I added Tony's, cayenne, garlic powder, pepper, thyme, and paprika. I used smoked beef sausage. Husband liked it, and he's picky. Paired with jalapeno cornbread.

GREAT!  I have always used zatarains but never will again after trying this recipe.  So easy and good!  Used rotel instead of diced tomatoes and added another can of kidney beans and some hot sauce.  I like them hot!!!! Thanks for the recipe.

I didn't particularly like chunks of tomatoes in this. I used bulk sausage in mine and added some beef boulion, Cavenders seasoning and a little starch to thicken it up.  I'll try it again, maybe with tomato sauce instead of diced.

Fantastic!!  I spiced it up a bit w/cumin, chili powder and garlic pepper, and used my own canned tomatoes.  My son loved it, which was great since he's so finicky.  Oh, i doubled the beans as well... good idea!

Healthy and delicious!  I used an extra can of beans and turkey sausage to up the nutrtion.  Also added a good amount of creole seasoning, cumin and chili powder to up the flavor.  Oh and brown instead of white rice.

Zataran's is the closest I've been to cajun cooking, and that said, this is SO MUCH BETTER! This is one of the easiest meals to make, adaptable (I use brown rice and turkey kielbasa) and is really fast. The funny thing is, it's a lot healthier than the boxed versions and it takes the same amount of time. Win, Win. Thanks for a great recipe!

This makes a quick and easy Red Beans & Rice, but extra seasoning definitely needs to be added.

I doubled the rice (2 cups of rice, 4 cups water)  Used a whole green pepper but diced it more than chopped it.  Both the kidney beans and the diced tomato I found in mild chili sauce and I think that added a nice sauce.
My 4 year old ate this dish and said it was good.  Delicious!

Delicious and easy.  Spiced it up with some chili powder, garlic powder and some sea salt during the simmer phase.  I would cook more rice next time - 1 cup was not enough, but a definite keeper.
