Great cookie to have with coffee. Not to sweet. It sound weird but they reminded me of pineapple upside down cake in flavor. Very easy to make.

These are not the sweetest cookies ever, but it's still a fantastically easy recipe. If you roll the cookies in the powdered sugar immediately after taking them out of the oven it sticks to the cookies really well. I've had other cookies like this and the powdered sugar is most of the flavor. I used only one cup of walnuts because that's all I had on hand and I think they came out nicely. Just to let you know, if you bake them for the full 20 minutes your cookies will be very crispy. If you like your cookies a little bit softer you can bake for only 16 minutes. Either way they are definitely yummy!
