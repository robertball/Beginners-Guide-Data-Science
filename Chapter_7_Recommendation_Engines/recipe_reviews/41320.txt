This is a quick, easy, and tasty recipe.  I make it even more simple by using jar gravy instead of mixing soup and milk together.  Just one less step.  Make a double batch so you have leftovers for lunch, or send some over to the neighbor!

This was easy to make and tastes great.  I like smoked turkey the best, it seems to give it a little more flavor.

Pretty good.  The gravy was a bit odd, but the combination was good.

Great recipe for leftovers.  We modified it a little bit because our turkey leftover was too thick to roll.  We made the recipe and put 1/2 of the prepared stuffing in a casserole dish, added the turkey and then the remainder of the stuffing and covered it with the soup mixture.  We put the french fried onions for the last 5 minutes.  It turned out great!!!

This was really good.  I used "healthy" chicken soup,only 1/2 of the french onions and 3/4 of the stuffing mix.  I wish a calorie count came with this recipe.  Will make this again.

This dish was even tastier as a leftover. My turkey slices were cut thin and the turkey would tear when I rolled it. It didn't matter at all to my boyfriend however, who ate it up happily. The french fried onions remained nice and crispy. Overall, a yummy, easy dish.

This is my fiance's favorite holiday dish.  This is the only dish he likes that I cook because he is a VERY picky eater.  I follow the recipe exactly and it's perfect every time!

I liked the general idea, however, the deli turkey slices threw me a little, so I used flounder instead and then subbed with roasted garlic mushroom soup. This was a quick and easy meal that everyone liked.
