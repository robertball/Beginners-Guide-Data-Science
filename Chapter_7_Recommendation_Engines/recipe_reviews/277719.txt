I followed this recipe to the letter and I'm sorry to say that it did not work out well and was bland. There is way too much butter/liquid in this. Perhaps the 1/2 cup butter is a typo? I used three large potatoes and a 1 quart casserole dish. When I inverted this onto a serving plate it did not hold its shape and I also ended up with a greasy mess on my counter top as it splattered out of the dish. The potatoes needed more than just salt & pepper and they had no browning or texture to them - they just ended up soft like a boiled potato would. Unfortunately, I will not make this again.
