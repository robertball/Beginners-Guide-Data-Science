One step is missing. After removing the mix from the refrigerator: Pour into a collinder. Drain. Rinse. Drain.
THEN...transfer then into a large pot on the stove.
Also, when I add the cornstarch, I first mix it with around 2 tbsp of milk.

Agreed, after sitting overnight....rinse and sieve the zucchini/onion mixture twice.  Of note similar process with a cucumber relish I make...I bring vinegar and sugar to a boil.  Mix spices together and add making sure it doesn't clump.  Reduce heat and add cornstarch ( mix with enough water to dissolve).  Make sure mixture isn't boiling or can clump when adding cornstarch.  Then I add the zucchini mash and red pepper.  Stir and heat through.....Yum!  Plus a great sense of accomplishment!

Making this again this year! It is a family favorite in deviled eggs, on brats, hot dogs and many other recipes. I do cut back on the sugar to try and keep it a little healthier. This is a great recipe for beginner canners.
