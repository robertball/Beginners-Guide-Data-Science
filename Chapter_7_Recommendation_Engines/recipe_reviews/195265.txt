Thought this was a great recipe. We called it "pizza pasta". I also added some garlic only because we love it. Great, super easy recipe my 4-year old loved!

My little guy loved this dish, so it's a keeper in my house.  I did have to use homemade marinara sauce, because I couldn't find the Margherita sauce.  We definitely added the pepperoni because everyone here loves it.  It was a fast and easy dish that will definitely be in my rotation.

I think next time I will try chunks or cubes of cheese instead of shredded, but overall it was very tasty and easy!

couldn't find specific sauce used other sauce I had on hand.  I think chunks of cheese would be better than shredded.  Child loved it.

Not bad, but it was a little bland for my liking. It's a nice starter dish you can customize to suit your tastes.

Haven't tried the actual recipe but I love the new Margherita flavor spaghetti sauce!  Its got a unique pizza-like flavor.  Absolutely love it and I think it would taste great with cubed mozzarella.

Yes, this made a quick and easy dinner, but it was very bland. This dish needs some extra spices and veggies, etc. to liven it up! I don't regret buying this sauce to try, but I doubt I'd buy it again.

A little boring - basically this is your standard pasta with tomato sauce. My boyfriend loved it, but I thought it was missing something....maybe some garlic or something? Not sure... Anyway, this was good enough and gets points for being really quick to make! :)
