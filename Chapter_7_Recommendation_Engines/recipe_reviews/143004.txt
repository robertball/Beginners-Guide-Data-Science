Great recipe, a little hard to knead, but you can add more milk or put the dough in the microwave a few seconds and will be much easier to work.
My family loved them. Thanks

Absolutely delicious! My husband is Chilean and he thinks these are better than the ones back home! I use 2/3 of a cup of 2% milk and it helps make the dough a little easier to work with. Also, I tried it with Robin Hood Bread and Roll Mix flour (don't use the yeast packets that it comes with).  They come out almost scone-like! Really amazing in the mornings with ham and cheese. Have made these numerous times and they always turn out well. Thanks for this recipe!

Pretty close to the real thing.  My husband is Chilean and this is his favorite type of pancito, the one he misses the  most now living in the U.S.  He was really happy with these!  They didn't come out quite as thick, buttery tasting (the ones in Chile really are like eating slices of butter almost), but I was impressed at how well they came out, and what an easy recipe!  Next time I may try a shorter cook time...

i made these for my Spanish class as extra credit. most if not all enjoyed them and dove in for seconds. i was surprised to see how good they were despite the little amount of ingredients. i would use a little more butter for extra flavor but other than that great recipe.

Dough is much easier to knead if you use the full cup of melted butter and between 1/2 and 2/3 cup of milk. Really easy to make and tastes awesome.

After looking at alot of recipes I decided to go with this one. This is such a great recipes, it's nice and easy and taste just about the same but even better. I'm chilean and I made it for a whole chilean family they loved it. My father grew up with my grandmother making all types of chilean food and when my father said daughter your grandmother would be so proud these taste yummy. My little family love it too. Thank you for sharing this recipe.

I enjoy looking up food that has no meat in it.  This bread from Chile is exactly what I was looking for.
