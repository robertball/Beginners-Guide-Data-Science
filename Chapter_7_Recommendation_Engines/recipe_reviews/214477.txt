Delicious!  And so simple!  I had planned to put this together the night before for my 15 yr old son to pop in the oven at the right time the next day.  I forgot, so I called him and he followed the recipe and made it himself!  Let me add, the most my son has ever cooked was grilled cheese.  I recently decided that I'd never taught him how to cook and should do so soon! I'm a single parent that just didn't take the time to show them.  Well, here was my chance, albeit over the phone!  When we got to the onion part, he said, "what's an onion?"  Oh please, he really didn't know what an onion looked like? Well, he figured it out and I talked him through quartering it, etc.  He then asked where he should put it.  I said shove it up the same hole that you took the bag of stuff out of.  lol.  My other two younger kids loved the chicken too and we are going to all start cooking together!

Succulent. It deserves 5 stars because of the moisture of the chicken flesh - between the slow cooking and the wine, there was not a dry spot in the chicken, even in the breast. I'd like to try to find a way next time to have the sauce flavors penetrate the chicken more - perhaps I'll inject with a syringe halfway through baking. Note: of course, this is not a "crispy skin" chicken recipe (it's covered when cooking). Probably if you gave it a good 5-10 minutes broil with butter on the skin at the end you could get a crispy skin, although I don't have experience with such a technique. Overall, thanks for the recipe!

I cooked this in my dutch oven at 250 degrees for 5 hours and it literally fell off the bone. Very good and easy to make. Served with mashed tatters, peas, and gravy. Thanks for sharing

TENDER, MOIST, & FLAVORFUL!  I followed the recipe exactly but used my unglazed ceramic stoneware to bake it.  I baked it for 4 1/2 hours and it fell off the bones.  The red wine and seasonings made it very flavorful.  Thank you FrackFamily5 for sharing your recipe!  We really enjoyed it!

Too much seasonings. And the chicken must be covered, though the recipe doesn't say that, for part of the cooking time or else it will not be done. The chicken itself is very moist and flavorful but the parts that are covered in seasonings I could not eat.

Great recipe.  Not sure how many times I have made this but it never lets me down.  I however don't understand all the temperatures of these chicken recipes being 180.  160 degrees is cooked plenty.

Delicious, fall-off-the-bone chicken.  I had two very large, fresh chicken halves that I used in place of a whole chicken. The wine that I used was a red table wine - a very cheap bottle of Charles ShawÂ® Nouveau, and it worked fine in this recipe.  The chicken had delicious flavor and it paired nicely with 'Parmesan Garlic Orzo' from AR and a tossed salad.  I now have the carcass and some added spices and veggies in the crockpot, overnight, making a wonderful broth in which I will freeze tomorrow.  Thanks, FrackFamily5 for sharing your chicken recipe.  The leftovers will be used to create another meal.

This chicken was the best roasted chicken I have ever made :) It was so juicy and tender that it was falling off the bone! I suggest using cooking twine to tie up the legs, as I did not and it was pretty flat when I took it out. I also stuffed the butter and herb mixture under the skin. This will be my go to recipe from now on :)))

Shorecook's review convinced me to try this. It was really tasty and literally fell off the bone. Had to leave out the parsley but tossed in some thyme to make up for it. I cooked it in my slow cooker on high for 3.5 hours and it was delicious. Easy and scrumptious. We made chicken wraps with the leftovers the next day. Very yummy recipe FrackFamily5. Thanks for sharing.

Quick to prepare (work time)so easy and you can change any spice/herb or add any spice herb you want.  Will try next time with white wine (Sherry). Juicy, succulent meat but miss the crisp skin.  Will try upping oven temp to 450F for the last 15 minutes and taking cover off to see if it crisps up the skin..

This recipe is a keeper!  Easy, comfort food at it's best!  The chicken I had was 2.94 pounds so smallish, so I had it in the 250F oven for 4 hours and 15 minutes and when I checked it, it was done to perfection!  I did include  the celery and onion in the cavity and I had white Pinot Grigio on hand so I used that instead of red wine.  I used all of the spices as measured for the 4 pound chicken and it was just enough to cover the smaller bird well.  The chicken was brown and juicy when done and had loads of flavor!  It fell off the bones and it was not dry at all!  I used a 9 x 12 inch metal baking pan lined with foil and foil also to cover and used a meat rack to keep it from sitting in the wine and drippings so it wouldn't be soggy.  It was soooo delicious that I will definitely use this recipe again in the future.  My hubby didn't really love the flavor the wine gave it so next time I will try chicken broth in the bottom instead of the wine.  The spices gave it a nice flavor though and I served with creamy mashed potatoes and chicken gravy and peas and I enjoyed this dinner very much!  Definitely a comfort food and highly recommend this recipe!

I followed the instructions to a tee and the results were terrific. I also served with wild rice and a salad.  We picked the leftover chicken clean and added the meat, rice, and some lightly cooked sliced carrots to the leftover wine (pinot noir) broth along with a chicken bullion cube disolved in a cup of water. The end result the next day was the best chicken and rice soup we've ever had. 

This chicken recipe will now be a regular part of our cooking rotation. Goo-ood!

After 5 hrs, the chicken was barely done. I then increased the oven temp until the chicken was nicely browned, but did not notice much flavor.

I did not make any changes and it was delicious. Happy to be able to put it into a slow oven for 4 hours of gardening and then come in, add leftover corn and coleslaw and made a lovely meal. Even had leftovers for another meal or chicken salad. Try it.

Even though I'm giving this only one star, I have to admit that the fault may be mine.  I followed the directions exactly, but I used my new probe thermometer for the first time on this recipe.  I'd set it to go off when the internal temp reached 180 degrees.  The recipe said the chicken needed to cook for 4-5 hours at 250 degrees, so I also set the timer for 4 hours.  The temperature gauge started going off after the chicken had only roasted for 2 hours and 15 minutes.  No matter where I put the probe, it said it was 180 degrees.  I figured that couldn't be right, so I removed the probe and continued to roast the chicken for 4 hours.  When the timer went off, I lifted the lid on the roaster and the chicken had fallen apart!  It was way past just being done!  It smelled delicious however, when we hate it, it just tasted like any other roast chicken we've made ... and we missed having real stuffing on the side to go with it.  I couldn't taste any of the flavors from the 'stuffing' of the celery and onion, the rub, or the wine.  Could that be because it was SO overdone?  Maybe, but I won't bother trying it again.

Easy and delicious slow roasted chicken!  I omitted the celery as I don't like it and added basil flakes instead of parsley as thats all I had.  It was AMAZING - fall off the bone, moist and soooo flavorful.

OK, but not worth the time.  I LOVE slow cooked stuff.  Love to cook stuff slow and make the house smell good (like an all day pot roast)!  My local Publix did not have a 4 pound chicken, so I went with a 5.5 pound one.   I increased the cooking time accordingly.  Clearly, there would be no crispy skin (BOOO!) but I wanted to give it a try.   I was SO looking forward to a warm, cozy comfort food day on a kinda cool day here in north FL.  After all was said and done, we had a soggy, not very well seasoned, 8 hour chicken.  Yes, the house smelled good, but not like Grand Ma's house!  Might as well put your chicken in the crock pot!  And I use a crock pot ONLY as a last resort.  Don't even think about covering with foil after taking it out of the oven as the recipe suggests.  Makes for an even more mushy mess than you would have had if you just let it rest without covering.  Yes, the chicken was done, but had to put it under the broiler to get a smidge of crisp on the skin and the chicken itself tasted OK but had an overcooked, cheap restaurant texture to it.  I will NOT be  cooking this again!!

Great recipe. I added about 2 tablespoons of oil to the spices to make a paste. I'm not sure why one reviewer said the recipe doesn't say to cover because it does.
I had a 4.79 lb chicken and it was done in exactly 3 hours.

This tasted great and was very tender and moist, and once you get it into the oven you can pretty much ignore it. I did open the pot briefly and basted the chicken just once , but it probably wasn't necessary.  I cooked it  for five hours to make sure it was thoroughly  done,  but as a result it was pretty mushy, even a little stringy, and basically fell apart. It didn't slice nicely and with the flabby skin,  it wasn't an attractive presentation and I wouldn't have wanted to serve it to company.  Next time I'd start checking the chicken with my instant-read thermometer after no more than four hours to avoid overcooking again, and I'd also crisp up the skin as other reviewers have suggested. Because of the great flavour and the ease of this recipe, I'm giving it four stars. The overcooking was my own fault.

This Chicken was perfect. I followed the recipe except added some  turnips (found in frig) to the baking pan. I put all my side dishes:  potatoes, onion casserole, and baked carrots to the oven. Makes for a carefree holiday dinner. Thank you!!

I added a pinot noir for the tray and gave it the most gorgeous finish.

Excellent! I added half of a package of onion soup to the wine just because I had a left over from the previous night . I made chicken in a puff pastry one night with the chicken and also a soup with the left over chicken and stock. I will make this chicken again.

Very good - As everyone shared, this is fall of the bone ready.  I did add 1 cup of chicken broth to dilute the wine - this gave it a hint of the wine taste without being overpowering, which is how my family prefers.

Meat is tender, but a little dry and the skin does not crisp at all. Does not compete with a traditionally roasted chicken.

I made it exactly as specified in the recipe. Almost all of the spices went into the juices. There wasn't much flavor in the actual chicken. The meat was tender, but I will go back to my regular recipe of lemon juice and Greek Seasoning roasted in the convection mode of my oven for 1 hour. Much better and less fuss.

Delicious. Fall-off-the-bone.. Saved the cooking liquid to use in soup. Will definitely make it again.

I  made no changes.  The chicken was juicy and moist and fell off the bone like it was described.  It was very simple also.  Makes for a nice easy dinner night.  I made some roasted potatoes to go with it and everybody was happy!

I used the exact ingredients baked for four hours at 300 covered in my pampered chef Dutch oven and the chicken skin was crispy and inside moist and falling apart so easy l will definitely make it again we loved it

Very succulent, but I had to broil it to make the skin crips & improve the appearance.
