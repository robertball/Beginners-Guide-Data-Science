I like the flavor, it was good.  The only thing I would change is the amount of blue cheese dressing.  8oz. Is way too much.  Next time I will use about 4 oz. instead.

Loved this cheesey bread!  I had a half of a small french baguette on it's way out, all of the buttery blue cheese moisture in this perked it right back up!  I can't really comment on the full recipe amounts as I had a small portion of bread and just eyeballed the ingredient amounts.  Tasty and a do-over!

So good!  Iâ€™ve always thought plain garlic bread needed something.  Apparently that something is blue cheese salad dressing.  This was amazing!  I ran out of garlic powder so I had to substitute fresh garlic, but other than that I made the recipe exactly as is.

There are only two of us so I eyeballed the ingredients and we were beyond happy with the results. Probably one of the best garlic breads I've ever had. Thanks so much for the recipe.

I made no changes with ingredients only thing I did a little different is to use half a loaf of the bread and did half of the blue cheese dressings in 2 parts first half under cheeses and after broiling and while in cool down time added the rest worked well for me. Thanks for sharing this different and great option for regular garlic bread.
