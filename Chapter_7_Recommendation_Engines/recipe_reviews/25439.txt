Fast sauce to throw together. I reduced the recipe to serve 4. Also to suit our personal taste I again reduced the amount of honey by half. Next time would probably reduce the amount of honey even more. Used on boneless country pork ribs. Seasoned the ribs with salt pepper & garlic powder. Seared the ribs then deglazed the pan with water & white wine. Poured drippings over ribs and baked at 325 deg. oven for an hour. Glazed the ribs with the barbecue sauce and baked for another 1/2 hour.
