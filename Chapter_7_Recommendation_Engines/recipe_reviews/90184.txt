Wow!  I had never thought of adding rhubarb to fruit salad. In fact, I'm one of those people who think fruit salad should have no dressing at all, but I've just changed my mind.  The rhubarb is not very sweet, and it gives just a hnt of tartness to the fruit.  Great combination!

So good and easy! I made just a few changes on the fruit I used (to use what was more in season) Otherwise followed the recipe and it is delicious.

Excellent! If you can't find fresh rhubarb, consider looking in the freezer section. I used fresh-frozen rhubarb & the sauce was as good as fresh!

I tried this with a lot of doubts. The only reason I make a sauce for fruit salad is to prevent browning, and I was out of some ingredients for my usual sauce. I was skeptical as to whether or not it really would prevent fruit from browning, the taste, and the texture of mashed rhubarb. Well, it did an excellent job of preventing browning, the texture was actually really good, and the taste... Well, over half of the people I served it to said it was the best fruit salad they had tasted! I cooked the rhubarb according to recipe, and poured it over a nice mix of in season fruits. I poured in enough rhubarb sauce to nicely cover the fruit but not enough for it to really collect in the bottom. Then I used the rest of the sauce over waffles the next morning!! Amazing, thanks!

This was pretty good but I didn't think the crunchiness of the apple went well with the other textures.

I used fruit that was in season. This sauce was excellent!  I also added a bit of mint.  :)

I didn't like the color it gave the salad and it got very soggy in the fridge.  I would not make this again.

My guests loved this.  I was uncertain about the rhubarb sauce as I love it but not everyone does, but it had a subtle tartness that was outstanding!

I made this recipe to take to a meeting this week.  I used frozen rhubarb for the sauce.  The color was awful and it was a bit too tart for me.  I added red food coloring and about 1/4 cup of powdered sugar.  I used fresh and frozen fruit I had on hand rather than the kind and amounts given.  I made it the day before the event.  Everyone seemed to enjoy it.  I brought home an empty bowl!

Hi - this is my submission.  The folks at allrecipes altered the recipe from what I submitted.  I always make the rhubarb sauce and refrigerate it.  Then add only enough to coat the fruit - maybe a little more if you want more sweet-tart flavor.  DONT put in all the sauce or it WILL make your fruit salad soupy!
Next - alter the fruits you use for your preference!  I always use berries, fresh or frozen - strawberries, raspberries, blueberries, and blackberries.  I also always use orange & grapefruit cut up (love the subtle flavor the grapefruit adds!), grapes (halved), peach (fresh or frozen) and apple (for crunchiness, diced).  I don't like bananas personally cause they get mushy too fast.  If available I add bing cherries (fresh or frozen), plum and kiwi...  with the leftover rhubarb sauce, I like to freeze it so I don't have to make it again for the next fruit salad.  Note - I put in similar comments before but don't see my prior review - don't know why allrecipes has to delete reviews!

This was a great fruit salad that was not overly sweet.  I did not have grapes or plums, so I doubled the peaches and blueberries. I felt the portions given for the rhubarb sauce make over twice the amount of sauce needed.

This is the best fruit salad ever! The rhubarb sauce is what puts it over the top. I would not say it is easy, but it is definitely worth every minute. This takes the "boring" out of fruit salads. I made this for 25+ people and over shot the quantity I needed and had people standing in line to take some home. =)
