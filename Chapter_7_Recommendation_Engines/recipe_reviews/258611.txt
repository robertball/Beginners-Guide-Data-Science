My family absolutely loved this and I will be making it again soon. I followed the recipe except that I seasoned the chicken with salt pepper and a dash of garlic powder and cayenne. It was easy to make and there were no leftovers!

My husband loves corn and cornbread so it was a big hit. I was concerned because there was limited spices but turned out to be very tasty.
