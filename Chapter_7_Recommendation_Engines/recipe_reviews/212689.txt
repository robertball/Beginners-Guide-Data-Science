Mine was runny, too.  Maybe I cooked it too long, but I wanted the cranberries to get really soft.  I just added a tablespoon of corn starch at the end to thicken it.  But boy, it tastes great.  The smell of orange and vanilla smells like a creamsicle and then the berry smell kicks in when it cooks.  I'd make this again before company comes just to make my house smell wonderful.

I loved this! I've been looking for a cranberry relish that I actually enjoy because cranberries are so good for you. Plus they're a pretty tradition. The blueberries cut the tart/bitterness factor perfectly without overpowering the cranberry flavor. Genius! My only criticism would be that it was a little runnier than I would have preferred. Maybe it's because I used frozen blueberries instead of fresh (the grocery store didn't have fresh the day I needed them), or maybe I simmered too long? Not long enough? Regardless, this will be the cranberry relish I make from now on.

This is very good! Even people who do not like cranberry sauce liked this. The blueberries help cut how tart it is. I, like the other viewers thought that it was alittle runny so I added 1 Tabls. cornstarch. I still thought it was too runny so I added another 1 Tbls. of cornstarch. This helped thicken it a bit more. This dish can be used in so many different ways. I think it would be good poured over cream cheese served with crackers. I will keep this recipe and it will be a star at every Thanksgiving from now on. Thank you for the great recipe. It is even going in the recipe box of cherished recipes from my granmother.

I made this last year for Thanksgiving and was asked to bring it again this year- which is saying alot because my family usually doesn't touch cranberry sauce- it was mostly put on the table for the "tradition"aspect. But this is one they actually eat and enjoy!

Excellent, but 2 small changes: I also found it to be too runny and added a tblspoon of corn starch at the end, and it was still runny.  Maybe cutting back the orange juice would help?  Also, most of my family thought there was too much vanilla.  I'd reduce to a third or so, then add until you are satisfied.  This is a re-user, for sure - we loved it!

1 9 18 ... http://allrecipes.com/recipe/212689/festive-fresh-blueberry-and-cranberry-relish/ ... 'First exposure to this type relish.  I had crans to use up & blues in the freezer.  Since blues were homegrown & I was using almost two cups of them, I decreased sugar to 1/3c.  That was enough.  I subbed 1T orange marmalade for the 1t zest.  A bit too orange-y for me.  'Thickened with 2T cornstarch.  'May have with biscuits.  Thanks for the recipe.

Maybe it's because I don't know much when it comes to cooking but this was a disaster for me.

I made this recipe for the first time this Thanksgiving, it was scrumptious! The blend of flavors, sweetness to tartness is perfect. Just as the others stated it was a bit runnier than I wanted, so I added 2 tsp. cornstarch (I had doubled the recipe). I will never buy or eat canned jellied cranberry sauce again!! Because it was still a bit saucy it was wonderful on French toast the next morning. I can see it on waffles, pancakes, ice cream, etc!!

I just winged it, no measurements. I used the  cranberries I had (looked like about two cups), some fresh blueberries and some frozen blueberries to what looked like about a cup, a capful of vanilla, the juice of one orange, and 3/4 cup sugar, but no zest. I threw it all in a pot, cooked 'til it started to boil and the cranberries started popping, and used a masher to the consistency I liked. Delicious! I think if this recipe can withstand my lazy cooking and still be amazing, it should be a winner for anyone. Thank you for the great twist on an old favorite.

This relish is fabulous!  The only reason I am giving it 4 stars is because my neighbor made a relish that I think is better.  But don't hesitate to try this one, I am glad I did.

This is the second year I've made this for Thanksgiving, and it is fabulous! The first year I made it as written, and it was great, however it was a little more runny than I would have liked, as most other people commented on. So this year, since I wanted a larger batch I decided to use two bags of fresh cranberries (12 oz each) and two packages of fresh blueberries (6 oz each. I kept the OJ at only 1 cup, left out the orange zest, and doubled the vanilla. The result was a very jellied cranberry sauce that was perfect! I also added a few sprinkles of cinnamon, which complements it very well. I am not a fan of cranberry, but this is just awesome! Especially on Vanilla Ice Cream!

I added more blueberries so the proportions were closer to those of the cranberries.  The flavor was good, but missing something, so I added some cinnamon and ground cloves to taste.  As others mentioned, added cornstarch for a thicker consistency.  Also, did not serve chilled, but room temperature.  LOVED the finished product.

Absolutely delicious and so easy to make!  I also added 1 tbsp of corn starch at the end to help thicken it up.  Going to use the leftovers on waffles and mix it into plain yogurt.  This is a keeper!
