I had a craving for fried squash and I was happy to come across this recipe. Frying squash is a popular way to prepare squash in the South, albeit not the healthiest way! To make it a little bit healthier without losing the flavor, I sprayed the pan with Pam and then added about a tablespoon of olive oil. This way, you don't have to drain anything. Rather than being deep fried it's more sauteed. I made a few other adjustments. I added a sprinkling of garlic powder and Emeril's seasoning. (any seasoned salt will do.) This gave it more flavor. If make this again I will dip the squash slices in the flour mixture to get a more even coating. It got clumpy when I mixed it all together.

I omitted the onion because I was pressed for time, and instead of salad dressing I used buttermilk, and the results were wonderful! I also added a little finely shredded Colby/Jack cheese to the Parmesan at the end, and that was even better. I'm eating the leftovers for lunch today!

i liked the way the miracle whip sticks to the squash. i followed the directions but used salted cornmeal instead of flour.  my husband loved them because the salt gave it the flavor it needed.

Very good recipe!  Even my kids liked it.  Only four starts because I, too, would like a less clumpy coating.  I will dip them in flour next time rather than mix it in.

Not bad, but I think I would prefer it baked instead. Next time I'll substitute bread crumbs or cracker crumbs for the flour as well. I thought the onions were a nice touch though. The kids didn't like it.

Not bad, but it needs seasoning.  I found the flour mixture to be bland.

Delicious!! I also followed reviewers suggestions of dipping in flour seperatly rather than mixing it in, I added a little onion powder and garlic powder, plus some good ole salt and pepper to the flour mixture.  I also sprinkled parmesan cheese on top everytime I removed some from the pan.  Came out delicious.

Very good recipe...it made tons.  I would cut recipe in half...there are five people in our family and we used half.  The only thing I did differently, was to let the squash have more time to drain the water off.  Thanks for a great side to my roast chicken. :)

I love this recipie.  I make it all the time, my whole family gobbles it up.  You must cook the squash until it has a bit of a crisp.

I read thru the other reviews first and decided to mix the flour and parmesan cheese in a bowl first and the dredge the squash slices in the mixture so it wouldn't clump together. I also dipped the squash in Marie's ranch dressing instead of miracle whip. Added a little salt and pepper and it came out great!  I would like to try baking these next time instead of frying to make these healthier. Great way to use up squash!

This was very tasty. Even my husband, who hates fried food, liked this recipe. Sounds like an odd mixture, but it was a very nice change.

This recipe is really good but I do not suggest mixing the flour in because it will not stay on the squash too good when you place them in the skillet. Dipping the squash in the flour is best.

I read through other suggestions and used corn meal instead of flour, added Mrs. Dash, onion powder, garlic powder and salt/pepper.  I dipped the Miracle Whip marinated slices in the corn meal.  Used a little olive oil as needed. I think I will brown the squash slices and finish baking them in the oven next time.  Hubby and I both say it tasted OK, but is not something we will eat a lot of.  Hubby says give 3 squash away and then eat the next one.  He doesnâ€™t realize how fast they grow!  LOL!

I love this recipe with some warm melted cinnamon butter! I've made this a few times and everyone loves it, but I have added 1 extra banana, a touch less of nutmeg, 1 cup of pecans & 1 cup of walnuts, with 1 cup of raisins. And for lining the pan, I mixed white & brown sugar together, this made it easier to spread the sugar.
