My mom bought some fresh catfish yesterday and since we eat fish quite often, she asked me to find a new recipe. I came across this one and we decided to try it out- it's delicious! I thought the mustard would be overpowering but it's definitely not. A very tasty, tangy dish [we're South Asian so we like our food flavorful!]. We did add more spices and also more onions and green peppers since we like vegetables. We also didn't have the seasoning salt so my mom mixed Mrs. Dash, sea salt, and several other spices together. 

Overall my family really enjoyed this dish, my dad kept commenting on how good it is. Thank you for sharing, we'll definitely make this again!

I made due with the ingredients I had on hand (no garlic, no peppers, slices of preserved lemon with the onion on top during the baking).  It was very tasty!  I will likely make it again, and tweak the ingredients of the sauce a little more to my liking.

Only mild modifications, only because of personal taste and half the amount cooked . You will only get a hint of the mustard, if you cut back, which was my largest modification. Her and her husband cook with great minds. You'll love this .

It's good, but I think you should cut the mustard down to 1/4 cup. Also, you don't need 2 cloves of garlic - use garlic to taste.

Really good, really simple sauce. Great recipe. 
I added Magi seasoning to "ethnic it up" but it was unnecessary.
Thanks for the recipe, will use again as is and adapt.

I should have made the peppers into quarters, got better done that we prefer. I added the sauce over all the veggies as well as fish and was a nice flavor. Thanks for the recipe.I will make again.

This was so tasty and easy!  I used Swai instead and honey mustard instead of dijon.  Loved the additional flavors from the veggies (sauteed slightly before adding them on top).
