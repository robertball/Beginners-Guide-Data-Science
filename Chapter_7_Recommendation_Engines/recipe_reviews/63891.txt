I used boil-in-bag rice and boiled it in 1 gallon of water with 2 bouillon cubes (good!) and then marinated chicken & shrimp in ginger, soy sauce, and lemon juice before beginning the cooking process. Turned out REALLY good and low-fat! This was a healthy, delicious recipe for stir-fry!

Excellent, easy recipe.  Could save time by preparing veggies the night before.  The sauce was minimal so next time I will make more of that.  Good way to clean out veggies from the refrigerator.  Will make again!

Used a bag of frozen stir fry veggies as well as added some fresh mushrooms, onions and snow peas. Also added a bit of soy sauce and more ginger than called for.

I used Trader Joe's "Frozen Just Grilled Chicken Strips" which cut down on a lot of cooking time because they defrost for only a few minutes in the microwave. I also used fresh steamed vegetables instead of frozen ones, to avoid the soupy unnatural Yoshinoya vegetable taste. One of the best American chicken and vegetable stir-fries I've ever tried!

Good recipe but the sauce tastes more like a real chinese stir fry if you add soy sauce to taste.  Also, I used more ginger than recommended. Very good overall.

I made this recipe for both my boyfriend and I tonight. I made a few changes, (1) used brown rice (2) scaled the recipe to serve 2m however more that doubled the veg. Used various vegetbales: onions, 3 color peppers, baby corn, mushrooms, pease, bamboo shoots, and other asian vegetables. I also added additional freshly grated ginger after adding the sauce ingrediants, and also it was a must to add soy sauce. peppers, and a few sprinkles hot pepper when plated. Other that this it was good.

After reading other reviews, I decided that I didn't want a bland sauce.  So I added a heaping spoon of hoisin sauce.  It made the sauce a little darker and with the perfect amount of zip.  My family really liked it and it was easy to prepare.  I would definitely make it again.

This is good.  The consistency of the sauce is perfect.  The taste is on the mild side.  We like spicy and bursting with herbs type flavors, so this was a bit too tame for us.  If I make this again, I'll try to "take it up a notch".

My family enjoyed this recipe though I did make a few changes.  I added more garlic powder and some soy sauce to the corn starch mixture and topped it with crunchy rice noodles.  Will make it again.

This was really good.  We used the Wal-Mart brand (Great-Value) Deluxe Stir Fry frozen veggies.  We just took them out of the freezer to defrost while cooking the rice and chicken.  The sauce was really good, and next time, we might double the quantity of sauce.

I really enjoyed this recipe but my husband said that it was missing something.  Even though I used frozen vegetables as some other reviewers had suggested, they still tasted very fresh.  Also, the ginger was not overwhelming like most stir frys.

I thought this was pretty good. My wife would give it a 3. I found it neither bland nor gelatinous. I am big on spices so if something is bland I am the first to complain. I noted both the ginger and the garlic powder in the "sauce"  My daughter thought it was great as well. I used brocolli, mushrooms, baby corn, string beans, green onions and yellow onion. I also put some crushed red pepper in mine :)  Great recipe, easy to make. I appreciate the dinner suggestion! I will be making it again.

I made it and it was bland and lifeless, almost puke looking...it tasted a ton better when I put soy sauce on it but I still had problems with the gelatin like consistancy of the 'sauce'

My husb loved it.  Is a healthy dish if using low-sodium stock/broth, and greens are not overcooked, so all the goodness is sealed in.

Very yummy. Even my picky 8 year old had seconds. I did add fresh garlic with the chicken and used chicken stock instead of water with boullion. The vegi's I used were broccoli, shredded carrots, celery and bean sprouts.

I used steak instead of chicken and marinated it for about an hour, cooked it on the grill and put it in after the veggies were ready.  This recipe was unbelievable!  And was very light.  
Definate hit with the family! Will be making this again......mmmmmmmmm

I do like this recipe but I messed it up just a little.  I doubled the recipe and added 1 bag of frozen stir fry veggies and 1 bag of frozen broccoli.  well I forgot that this website will double the recipe for you so I guessed and it came out slightly bland.  Even so, I have a family of five and there was barely any left to make my hubby a lunch with it for the next day.  
It isn't often that you find a recipe that is good, healthy, and easy to make.

I gave this 3 stars because some of the members of my family liked this and others didn't. I felt there wasn't enough spices on it for me. It was kind of dull tasting.

My whole family really likes this recipe.  I have two small kids so it is hard to please everyone but this one works.  I dont put as much seasoning in the rice.  I often use frozen veggies just to make it easier on me. It comes out great.
