I spiral cut the squash instead of cutting into bite-size pieces but, otherwise, followed the recipe.  Just a really nice side dish loaded with fresh flavors.  Delish!

I made this to recipe except for reserving some of the bacon pieces for the top along with some freshly shredded Parmesan which I thought added not only to the presentation but to the flavor.  This recipe was a little different take on the ordinary yellow squash and enjoyed it for a change.  Thanks Katrinika for submitting this!

Everyone loved it on the 4th of July.  I only dotted the top with the capers.  Added quartered cherry tomatoes all over the top to add color.  One person commented the tomatoes added to the flavor.  Good job!

I had pancetta so i used that instead of bacon. It was delicious. I felt the cooking times were a little off as the squash got pretty squishy after cooking even for a minute. I did put parm on the top and put under the broiler for a few minutes. It was delicious as is. Next time I would reduce the cook time and probably not cover it, instead finish it under the broiler. Still an excellent recipe!

Big hit at our house!  I try not to change recipes the first time I make them, but I didn't have artichoke hearts or bacon.  I used deli ham, and replaced the artichokes with green beans.  Whoever suggested parmesan, thank you!  Really good!

I like squash a lot. We have it typically twice a week as a side dish.  There were far too many flavors going on here.

I substituted Pancetta (chopped) for the bacon and shredded the squash.  It was excellent.  I use this as a pseudo hash with an egg on top as a breakfast dish.  I definitely make it again.

This was fantastic.  The only change I made was using zucchini as it was on sale this week. Could eat it every day.

It was ok, but the bacon came out soggy. I wonder if it also would have been better with spaghetti squash.

Was looking for a way to use up some of the squash from the garden.... for a very healthy meal and a twist from the normal squash recipes this was awesome!

Lovely way to shake up squash. The capers and artichoke hearts are so unexpected and so refreshing.
