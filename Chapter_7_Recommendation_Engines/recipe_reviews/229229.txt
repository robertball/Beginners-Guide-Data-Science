Very good! I made a rolled pork loin. My husband asked for left overs the next day.

I served it with plum glazed Cornish hens - I did not have an apple so I used a carrot for the sweetness and 8 oz of portabella mushrooms. It was a hit - the seasoning was very good.

We loved it!  Served with a slow cooked apple/pork roast.  Skipped the fennel and garlic, and it married well with the pork.  Everyone had seconds.

This was excellent! I'm not a fan of bread stuffing so I was happy to find this. I wasn't even making turkey. This would go good with most any meat and especially wild game like duck or venison. I had been gifted a couple of patty pan squash so I decided to stuff them with this mixture and that made for a fun presentation. This makes a lot of stuffing and would serve at least 8 I'd say. This was great as written but I'd try replacing some of the apple with celery next time.
