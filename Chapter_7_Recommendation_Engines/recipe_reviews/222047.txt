I had to make one substitution--I did NOT have fresh jalapeno peppers on hand. What I did was add half of a 4 ounce can of diced mild green chilies instead. My family LOVED this spanish rice. Out of that whole pot, we ate every bite........and both my husband and oldest son were bummed there wasn't any more. For us, this recipe served four.

This recipe IS really easy. Even though it seems like the amount of butter, onions and tomatoes are excessive, keep to those proportions. If you don't want it too hot, then definitely scale back on the jalapenos. I didn't have any Mexican tomatoes on hand, so I used the same amount of canned plain, diced tomatoes and added some garlic powder, chili powder and a little cumin to taste.

Don't miss down in the footnotes that water may needed to be added. I missed that and ended up adding water after it had already been cooking for 45 minutes. Mine took about 1 1/2 cups of water ( I was making a double recipe) and took about 70 minutes or so to cook. It probably wouldn't have taken that long to cook if I had added the water at the beginning. It would be nice for the water to be in the recipe rather than in the footnotes.

It might seem like I barely followed the recipe, but when I added my spices, I was just trying to guess what Mexican tomatoes had in it. I must've guessed pretty close, because it really was good! Thanks for the submission :-)

I wasn't feeling this recipe like the other reviewers. It was HOT! I left out the jalepenos, and used rotel Mexican blend tomatoes. I wasn't sure what Mexican tomatoes were, and believe I used the right kind. It just kind of tasted like rice, tomatoes, and heat. The sour cream and cheddar, is definitely needed! It added flavor, a creaminess, and took away from a tad of the heat. I made only 1/2 recipe and found at 20 minutes on low it started to near burn on the bottom. I had to add some additional water which was optional.

I wasn't able to find any 14oz diced tomatoes labeled as Mexican flavor, so I used one can of Mild Rotel and one can of Mexican Lime & Cilantro Rotel, which were 10oz each.  I ended up having to add about 1.5 cups of water total throughout the cooking process since it was taking longer than expected for the rice to cook, and to make up for the reduced liquid from the smaller cans of tomatoes.  The rice had a good amount of heat to it. If you don't like things spicy, definitely omit the jalapeños.  It was perfect for me and hubby though. I highly recommend the Mexican Lime & Cilantro flavored tomatoes. They lend a great flavor to the overall dish.  Make sure you eat it with sour cream and cheese. SO SO good! Also keep an eye on this once the water gets low because it burns easily! This one's a keeper!

Just got finished making this and it is a really nice rice dish. I used Serrano chilis instead of jalapeno peppers, I had none on hand. Of course it came out super duper spicy but, my fiance and I like a food that challenges us! Thanks, for the recipe!

Really good recipe. I had to add the extra half cup of water to it. My family thought it was the best spanish rice I made so far. Next time I will add some chopped garlic.  I had the sour cream and shredded cheese on top, so good.

I made this recipe and used only one onion and used a large poblano pepper instead of the jalapeño as I cannot handle the burn.  I used Uncle Ben's rice and did not need to add water and it was done in about 25 minutes.  I served it to 8 of us including children and everyone loved it.  It is beautiful in the bowl and moist and flavorful without being too spicy.  I did not add the cheese or sour cream as it really did not need it.
This will be my go to Spanish Rice from now on.  I also did not add any additional salt as the tomatoes had plenty of sodium in them.

Very easy and very good! This takes very little effort for great results. Since my husband doesn't like overly spicy dishes, I opted out of the jalepeno and added mild chili peppers instead. I left his "as-is" and topped mine with a couple of sliced jalepeno from a can. Overall, very tasty and a great side dish!

I followed the recipe exactly except I doubled it, but the rice WOULD NOT cook! It took an another hour and two and a half extra cups of water just to get the rice to an eatable state. And after it was finished, the rice was very diluted and bland. Didn't like this recipe at all!

Mmm yummy. My boys really liked this because it was spicy. A little to spicy for my wimpy taste buds but still really good. The sour cream and cheddar was nice on top. Quick and easy, great for a quick weeknight meal.

Super EASY and DELICIOUS!!!  I always like to follow the recipe exactly as written to be able to give it a fair rating. I can always make modifications the next time I make it.  
I couldn't find Mexican-style diced tomatoes so I used Del Monte diced toms with Zesty Jalepeno.  Therefore, I didn't use the optional jalapeno peppers.  I did use Megan's suggestion (in the recipe notes) to add additional water to the rice (I added between 1/2 to 1 cup).  We topped the rice off with shredded Mexican blend cheese and sour cream.  Great recipe...thanks for sharing!

It was easy to make and the taste was bien!  I had previously roasted jalapenos so that is what I added.  I used crushed tomatoes (about 16 oz. and the rest was water. Yummy with a nice kick.

My family loves this recipe.  I also add chicken which has been marinaded in Mojo and grilled to make it a main dish.  It is a huge hit.

WOW! This was great, and after a few bites, I remembered the photo with sour cream & cilantro, and that made a 5 star recipe into 10 stars!! Oh, I added diced fresh chicken to make it into a 1 pot main dish.(I had added finely diced red & yellow bell peppers & carrots for extra veggies, & we couldn't even see it, but got the extra nutrition, too.)

Quite spicy. Easy. I was a bit dubious about cooking it in the skillet with so little liquid, but it worked.

This was just ok for me. I would make it again but I would add more diced tomato. It was pretty dry and that was with adding 1 C of water. I like my rice a little more moist.

My family loved this rice! I was looking for an easy to make rice to accompany the usual weekday tacos, burritos, etc... and found this one. I served it tonight and my kids filled up on the rice dish and didn't have "room" for the main dish. I omitted the jalapeno peppers as it would be a little too hot for the kids' taste, but followed the rest of the recipe as described. Definitely a keeper. Very quick and easy and tasty. Thanks for posting.

I just used this recipe to get me in the right direction for Spanish rice. I’d already steamed my rice, so that’s one thing I did different. Used less butter. I luckily did have the jalapeño & can of diced tomatoes with green chili. This was good, quick easy my family liked it. Helped make taco dinner a bit more substantial.

I made this recipe for a large group and everyone loved it. I did tweak it a bit, substituted 2c water with 2c chicken broth, removed seeds from jalapenos, and limited chopped onions to 2 cups. Will be making this dish again!

I felt this wasn't an authentic dish, I did not like tomato chunks, and the rice did not ever get soft, even though it was covered for over an hour.  It needed more spices, cumin and some chili power, comes to mind. I would not make again.

I prepared for a fajita party and it was a big hit.  I had to double the recipe and it still came out great. I used poblanos, jalapeños, green and red peppers in it along with rotel.  I was happy to share this recipe with those that asked for it.  I will be making this again and again and can’t wait to add meat to make it a meal.

I will definitely make this again!
 I used 1 onion, 1 large jalapeño 
1 - 28 oz can Rotell chopped tomatoes with green Chile’s 

After sautéing onion and pepper,  add rice and tomatoes (in sauce) bring to boil, then turn down to simmer 25 minutes. Stir occasionally and keep covered until most of liquid is absorbed.
Remove from heat and let stand (covered) about 10 minutes.
There is no need to add more water or cook it any longer than 25 minutes if you keep it covered!

I followed this recipe to the letter and agree that the water should be in the recipe from the beginning.  I used 1 cup and it was perfect.  I flash froze half of this and it thaws and reheats beautifully.  Highly recommend!

Loved this rice, reminded me of my grandmothers kitchen! I left out jalapeños, added some minced garlic and half of a bell pepper diced, and I used 2 cups of chicken broth for liquid. I will be making this one again!

Amazing. I used only 3 Tbsp. of butter. I had 2 cans of 10 oz. rotelle mild on hand so I added an extra can of water. I kept to 2 onions and a generous amount if sea salt. It was spicy & delicious! I will be making this again!

I can't find Mexican tomatoes in our local supermarkets.Had extra tomatoes in the fridge so I parboiled and diced them and used instead but  I'm sure I'm missing some flavour. That said, this was a very good side. I added 3/4 cup of corn as seen in one of the photos. Made half the recipe for just the two of us and there were leftovers. Had to add an additional 3/4 cup of water though as the rice cooked. Will make again and keep my eyes open for those Mexican tomatoes!

This recipe was easy and tasted great. I found that the rice dried out, stuck to the skillet and burned the first time I made it so now I add 1/2 cup of water every 15 minutes.

I changed it because I didn't have the Mexican tomatoes, I used  a can of  diced tomatoes with chilies and a can of diced tomatoes,about a 1/4 teaspoon of penzey dried jalapeño also about 1 teaspoon of fresh squeezed lime juice. Next time I think I will forget the jalapeño,  little spicy for us old folks.  I will  used grated cheddar and sour cream when I serve it today.  Ohh, I had to add about 3/4 cup water, one reason my chili tomatoes was only a 10 1/2  ounce can.  It makes too much for us . I think I will half the recipe  next time..  only three of us.

Not sure what Mexican tomatoes are, assuming that means Ro-tel type tomatoes.  (For folks with 'heat' issues, Ro-tel comes in Mild, medium and hot around here.) 

 I use this basic recipe, but add browned ground beef  for a full meal.  Just cooking for Hubby and I, so I use  1 can Ro-Tel, chicken stock, onion, and ground beef for us.    Put a lid on the pan, and use a good lid.  Extra water shouldn't be necessary.  Also, make sure you are using INSTANT rice for this  recipe, or cook your rice ahead of time.  Been doing this recipe for nearly 40 years, gradually getting more heat since we moved to Texas.  For NO heat, use regular diced tomatoes and add a little Taco seasoning or chili powder.

For some reason I always burn this recipe :-( ... but we love it even burned! BUT I now make it in the microwave oven :-)  Some times I will add black beans to create a full protein meal minus meat. Mostly we eat it as a side to 'Quick and Easy Mexican Chicken' also found on AR.

Didn't seem to have enough liquid. Had to add water to cook rice.  Was tasty. It just took too long to prepare.

I added the following to the recipe: one chopped sweet pepper, clove of garlic, and 1/2 cup black olives. I had the same problem as at least 1 other reviewer - not enough liquid. After adding rice and cooking for 20 minutes, the rice was still quite hard and the sauce seemed too thick. I added another cup of water and checked after 20 more minutes. Rice was still hard! Left on low for additional 10 or so minutes, and finally served because we were hungry. I think I need to try another recipe.

I replaced the canned tomatoes with fresh tomatoes & chili powder & cumin I found this recipe sufficient for my needs. I also removed the butter & replaced with olive oil because we are a dairy-free household.

This was a big hit at a gathering.  I used mild rotel lime & cilantro tomatoes. I don't like  jalapeño so I used mild diced Chiles.  I agree with other reviewers I wish the water was built into the recipes vs foot notes as I forgot to add water but it still turned out great.
