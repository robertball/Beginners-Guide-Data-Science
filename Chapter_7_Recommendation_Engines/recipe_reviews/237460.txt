We make this in Puerto Rico too! Most of my family doesn't mash the plantain, they slice it and layer the bottom. I have eaten it both ways and it's so yummy!!

Turned out OK but the store didn't have ripe plantains. Do NOT use green plantains! Or substitute with mashed potatoes and voil√°! Shepherd's pie!

That was a very nice discovery easy interesting and flavourful! My 4 stars come from the fact that a little something was still missing to be really great: lime juice? green chili? pepper?... But everybody liked it otherwise. An interesting tip: I blended all together the leftovers adding water and Maggi to make a comforting soup on the next day and it was a WOW!

It was very simple and it was delicious. The fact that I had some very ripe plantains made the dish tastier. Will definitely make it again.

It was super easy and fun!!! I was sooo excited I forgot to read the oven temp and cooked it 350 degrees lol but put more time on the timer so it came out nice, I would totally recommend to all!
