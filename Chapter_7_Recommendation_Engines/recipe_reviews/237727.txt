I made this tonight because I wanted something simple to use up my abundance of cherry tomatoes.  I'm not one to follow recipes exactly, but I tried on this one.  My husband grilled salmon and we put this over it.  It was a winner! Will definitely make this again. Next time will try with steak.

This just wasnâ€™t hugely flavorful. Maybe it needs more time in the fridge or some red pepper or something.

Nice and refreshing alternative to heavier sauces.

I had the last of the season smallish (roma and cherry) tomatoes sitting on the counter top for about a week.  After deciding to grill swordfish steaks but not having carb side dish, I looked around to see what I could find to put on top of the fish to add interest and flavor.  This recipe popped up and the tomatoes called to me.  I didn't have red wine vinegar and just added red cooking wine - more than a splash if you get my drift!  Then I added an additional clove of garlic, some snipped fresh parsley and a teaspoon or so of capers.  After it sat in the fridge for about an hour, I put the sauce with the chopped tomatoes in the pan and cooked it down to the thickened stage.  We found it a perfect accompaniment to the swordfish and will definitely even buy tomatoes to make this again.
