This recipe has a lot of potential so it is worth trying it and tweaking it. The biggest problem is it calls for way too much cream/milk making it totally soupy and tasteless. I would cut the milk/cream down to 1 cup and add more if needed. The second issue is there is too much cooking time for the shrimp making the shrimp tough. I would add the shrimp in the last 5 minutes of cook time.

I like the addition of the ham chuncks in this recipe. It tool a lot longer to get the sauce to thicken than the recipe indicated. The taste was great. I would recommend this recipe.
