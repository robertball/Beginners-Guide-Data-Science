Very good basic recipe, although the measurements require a bit of tweaking!  I make risotto quite often, so I have gotten pretty good at finding that perfect creamy consistency, and with the few changes I made, I got it!  I did not use any butter, but instead I used all olive oil (about 3 T was enough), and then I added about 3/4 C onion (1 small), 3 chopped cloves of garlic, and sauteed over medium heat for about 5 minutes before adding the wine.  I did add 1/2 C wine, and cooked for a few minutes over medium until most had evaporated, then started adding my chicken broth (3 cans was the perfect amount, by the way) about 1/2 C at a time until it began to get creamy, but still had a slight bite to it. (This took about 20 minutes or so, but judge by texture more than time.)  Then I added about 1/2 C cream (I think a cup is way too much for only 1 1/2 C rice), 1/2 C fresh grated parm (it needed more then just 2 T), salt and pepper, the 2 T lemon juice, and the steamed broccoli (4 minutes in the microwave is perfect).  Add a bit of extra cream if it seems dry at this point.  All in all, great recipe; the lemon and broccoli with the creaminess of the rice was delicious!!!

After ordering a broccoli risotto recipe at Perkins recently, and thinking it was pretty awesome for chain restaurant fare, I was happy to find this one at the allrecipes website. It is very good, and did not require any salt or pepper. I realized too late that I forgot the heavy cream on my trip to the store, but found a substitution on-line: 3/4 cup milk, 1/3 cup butter, and 1 tablespoon flour (if using 1% or skim milk). It worked perfectly. I like chopping the broccoli very fine, so each bite suggests broccoli rather than overwhelming the dish with large chunks.

This was a really tasty risotto.  I skipped the cream to limit the amount of fat but it was still very creamy and delicious.  This could be modified to add whatever veggies are on hand - mushroom, asparagus, etc.  I will definitely be making this again.

This was fantastic! I made two alterations- substituted chopped frozen spinach for the broccoli (we were out) and used 1/4 cup half and half instead of cream. Also, the finished risotto only "took" 4 cups of broth, so I'd recommend adding just a 1/2 cup at a time towards the end of cooking time. Thanks for the recipe, this was great!

I made this risotto with the stock from a whole  chicken cooked yesterday.  Did not have white wine so used cooking sherry.  And, once the sherry was absorbed, added the rest of the chicken stock and pressure cooked it for 6 minutes.  Once done, put the pressure cooker on "brown" and added the broccoli and cheese.  Did not need the cream because it was so creamy already!  Wonderful recipe!

This was pretty good, and not too difficult (was my first time making risotto so I was a little scared!) Since I don't have experience making risotto, I'm not sure if I ended up with the 'right' consistency, but I stopped adding broth after four cups, and it was even a teeny bit mushy. But perfectly edible and tasty. I used a little more oil and a lot less butter, forgot to put the chives in, more asiago and no parmesan - though if I make again, I think I would use just parm 'cause I always have it on hand, and asiago is more expensive than it's worth. I also added a tbsp more lemon juice plus another quick drizzle at the end, and it still didn't taste very lemony, but that's alright. Overall, quite good!

Oh wow this was the best thing I have ever eaten! Usually I don't like risotto because it has a ton of mushrooms in it, but this was delicious! I had leftover broccoli and roasted red peppers that I needed to use so I threw them in this and it was so good I could have eaten the whole pan by myself!

This is a great recipe and since I am vegeterian I had to make some subsitutions.  I substituted the chicken broth with vegetable  broth, I used vegan butter, I  used silk creamer instead of heavy cream and I used veggie parmesan cheese to make this a great vegetarian/vegan dish. Thanks for the recipe.

I made this exactly by the recipe except that I had no cheese and I through in a little leftover shredded chicken.  It didn't taste as good as I had expected, (delicious and creamy, but rather bland.) but I suspect the cheese would have made a big difference.  Will definitely try it again!

I always try a recipe as is AND THIS WAS DELICIOUS!! Even though I didn't have cream (used whole milk) or chives. My 8 and 10 year olds enjoyed it even though they saw me chopping the onion...husband gobbled it up as well. THANK YOU!

This is a recipe I've cooked several times and just love the flavors in this risotto.  I used a Romano/Parmesan/Asiago cheese blend and frozen baby broccoli florets because I did not want big chunks/large stalks in the risotto.  Like other cooks, I used less cream to cut down on the fat as well as regular whipping cream rather than the heavy version.  Absolutely delicious!

Wonderful flavor and very creamy!  I also steamed the broccoli separately and mixed in toward the end.   I served this with fish and it was amazing!  Thank you!

The lemon juice made this risotto taste very different from the mushroom risotto I usually make.  It was delicious, and something new and different to make.  I added two additional tablespoons of lemon juice, and it took 6 (14-ish oz) cans of chicken broth, which is far more than the listed 5 cups, but it was still worth making.  Very yummy!

I didn't change this recipe at all- though it is a good base Risotto recipes. My risotto was very creamy even without the milk. The milk doesn't need to be in here but I used it and it seemed like a bit much at first but cooked down wonderfully.
Thanks for sharing!

It ended up being really good, but the rice wasn't cooked properly. It was my first time making risotto after trying it at loads of restaurants so I was wondering, do you boil the rice beforehand? I was a little lost, since the recipe just said to pour the rice.

Turned out great.  I used aspargus instead of broccoli because that is what I had on hand and I like better.  Imagine broccoli would taste just as good as it did with aspargus.  This is also my go to recipe now for basic risotto.

This risotto is absolutely delicious! The addition of heavy cream in place of the usual butter works very well. I followed the recipe exactly, other than adding more cheese at the end. A wonderful dish. Thanks!

my review is based on a HALF PORTION.

I did not use any butter but instead I used all olive oil (2T), and then I added about 1/2 C diced onion and 1 minced clove of garlic, and sauteed over medium heat for about 5 minutes before adding the rice (3/4C) and the wine (1/2C), and cooked for a few minutes over medium until most had evaporated, then started adding my chicken broth (2C) about 1/2C at a time until it began to get creamy, but still had a slight bite to it. (This took about 20 minutes or so, but judge by texture more than time.) 

Then I added about 1/4C cream, 1/2C parmesan, salt and pepper, the juice of 1/2 lemon, and the steamed broccoli. Add a bit of extra cream if it seems dry.

This worked well for me . . . I've also used spinach with this recipe.  Very lemony and creamy!

You can't really go wrong with risotto!  I subbed half-and-half, and also left out the Asiago (just using all Parm), and left out the chives.  Good stuff!  Always use freshly grated Parm, though!  It melts perfectly.

This turned out excellent.  I switch a few things.  Sauteed asparagus, bella mushrooms with shallots and garlic in olive oil and white wine instead of broccoli.  Set those aside and used 1/2 cup parmesan instead of the asiago at the end. Used both the white wine and the creme and tossed in 1/2 cup of peas as well.  My husband had 3 helpings.  It's a keeper.

This was wonderful. I followed the recipe with the following exceptions. I used only olive oil, omitted the cream & cheese and added diced cooked chicken. It is time consuming but worth it. The lemon makes it light and refreshing.

Good recipe.  I used a green onion instead of a sweet onion and omitted the chives and lemon juice (because I didn’t have them on hand) and thought it turned out great. Thanks for the recipe.

Delicious and easy to make.  I took the recommendation of another reviewer and reduced the amount of cream and increased the amount of Parmesan cheese.  The result was creamy and flavorful.  I'll make this again.

With the suggested adjustments from other reviews, this was really good! First time cooking risotto the recipe is easy to follow. I did not have cooking wine so I replaced it with just water. I also added chicken to make a complete meal.

Will definitely make this again. I followed the recipe and measurement exactly except I increased the Parmesan and would increase the lemon next time. Well worth the work. Thank you.

I have never made risotto for the fact that it always seems to have mushrooms and my family won't eat that. This recipe gives me hope for a new side dish to add to my rotation. I did not have white wine, but its deletion did not seem to make a difference. I also did not use cream, as the cheese seemed to add enough creaminess. Everything else was as written and we really enjoyed it alongside a lemon chicken.

What I changed:  evaporated milk instead of heavy cream-only because I didn't have any heavy cream; added sautéed mushrooms, because I had them and had to use them. Dynamite recipe.  I definitely will cook it again.

The reviews are right- this dish is AWESOME. Super creamy and nicely filling. I used half and half instead of cream and added red pepper. I also steamed the broccoli and red pepper first before adding it to the risotto, and added extra cheese. You end up with a big portion! Makes good leftovers.

Very tasty and well balanced.  Had to modify the stock (vegetarian) but it didn't affect the outcome.  Also had easy access to the cheese (live in Italy) but not the cream so used Mascarpone.  Will definitely cook again.  Thanks

Instead of following the recipe for cooking the rice I sauted the onions with a chopped red pepper in the olive oil and butter. Once the onion was browned, I added the chicken broth (I used more chicken broth instead of adding the wine) and brought it to a boil. I then added a couple of tablespoons of lemon juice.  I used sprouted brown rice and simmered for about 40 min,  the rice mixture still had a fair amount of liquid. I then added about 1 cup of cream cheese instead of the heavy cream and stirred it in. While the rice was simmering I had steamed the broccoli and some snap peas. When the broccoli was tender crisp I turned off the heat and lifted the lid. Just before the rice was ready I brought a few cups of water to a boil and dropped in some raw prawns. Once the prawns turned pink I drained off the water and  then tossed everything together. Final step was to added a few tablespoons of grated asiago cheese and parmesan cheese. Served it with a sprinkle of lemon pepper on top and additional parmesan cheese.

Love this recipe! I've made it three times and it always turns out great. I only add 4 cups of chicken broth, but I think it is plenty.

The directions are perfect. Tastes great. Thanks a bunch for this one. I dont even want to try another risotto recipe. I didnt have broccoli, so I used carrots and peas and it was still delicious.

Delicious, and I would definitely use this as a base for any risotto. I made mine with vegetable broth and brown rice, since some of my family are vegetarian and we're trying to be health conscious. The amount of broth used did not seem to be affected by the change in rice, I used an entire box. I used a little less cream and a little more cheese, also more lemon juice based on other reviews. I did not have chives, so I stirred in green onions at the end. I should note that using uncooked broccoli and having it cook in the risotto is a bad idea; gets mushy and kind of brown. I also did not use white wine, as I don't generally keep it in the house and I'm not going to buy a bottle just for one dish. I checked, and many people said the dish is fine without it. Other than that, delicious! I will be making it again and using it to experiment with other flavors of risotto!

Very delicious - I especially loved the lemon flavour. When I cooked the broccoli, I divided the stems from the florets. I cooked the florets for a short time to keep them nice and green and then removed them from the water and added the stems. I cooked the stems for quite a long time until they were fairly soft and put the water and the stems in the blender, leaving me with nice green hot water, which I then added some veggie stock to to get the correct amount of liquid, heated it up again and used this as the liquid for the risotto. I sounds like a lot more work but it too much more and you get great flavour from the all the delicious green stuff that comes out in the water when you boil broccoli!!
