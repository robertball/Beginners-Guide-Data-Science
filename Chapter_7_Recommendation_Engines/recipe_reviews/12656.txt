This pie was awesome.  For those who had trouble with it setting up, you MUST bring cream pies to a full bubbling boil.  This one said for 1 minute and, after adding yolks, cook 30 seconds longer. My office loved it. My family will also love it at the next get-together!

We have been searching the country over for a good coconut pie recipe to use in our restaurant.  My husband is VERY picky....  After many mishaps, we stumbled across this one.  It has come out perfect every time (except when I did not let it get to a good boil as recommended).  It sells out immediately each time I make some for the restaurant - our most popular pie!

I have several diabetics in my family, so I have made this recipie with Spenda* Sweetener.  It gets rave reviews.  (The last time my relatives were in, they ate the leftover pie for breakfast.)  If you do this, you may want to add a tad more cornstarch, because the non-sugar changes the consistency a little.

One note though: If you like a full pie, you may want to double (or 1 1/2 times) the recipie, I find that the regular recipie is a little scant.

It's a great recipe, but please cook it longer than instructed.  I have a digital timer I use and one minute is too short to cook it after it's boiling. Do 2-3 min and 1-2 min after having the egg yolks.  Also, I cooled the base overnight(or min 2hrs) before doing my egg topping. I covered the egg whites and whipped them the next day.  Additionally, please use an electric mixer on high to make the egg topping. It will take at least 8-10 min of beating.  My client was thoroughly pleased. His pie was my second run-through.

Excellent.  Just make sure that you boil it for an extra 30 seconds, return it to the heat after putting in the coconut and butter, and allow the pie to cool fully (in the fridge) after baking.

I followed directions and it turned out perfect.  I don't use meringue for the top, I always use unsweetened heavy whipping cream.

I really really wanted this to turn out.  It's my husband's favoriate pie and I followed it to the tee and it turned out runny!  I don't think it was the recipe...  i'm sure it was me.  He said it tasted like it was supposed to, u just had to eat it with a spoon, and the topping was horrible!  I just need step by step directions with mine.

For the people who ended up with coconut soup. I am thinking it's the milk you used. Some milk just doesn't work like whole milk. I made this and it was very thick cut great, not runny at all. I did make  a few changes to it only because I'm a firm believer that you can never have enough coconut. Instead of regular milk I used coconut milk 1 can. then I added about 1 cup of whipping cream. Coconut milk is very thick and so is heavy whipping cream. It set perfectly very firm. I also added about 1/4 teas. of Almond extract along with the vanilla. For the crust I used a recipe I found on Allrecipes called "Walnut Crust" I made one lil change with that recipe too. I added a lil chopped coconut to the crust mixture. Wow is all I can say! Thanks again for sharing. For those of you who didnt have good luck with this recipe setting. TRY COCONUT MILK! YUMMY!

I Have never made or tasted a cocoanut pie, I made it for husband’s birthday, he LOVED it, the filling set up well, for those who had a problem with the filling, just cook it longer until it thickens, you can’t go wrong with ¼ cup of corn starch and 2 cups milk ratio. 
If I had to change something next time, that I would increase the amount of meringue.

I 'almost' followed this recipe exactly....only change I made was using 4 eggs instead of 3 to allow for plenty of merangue.  I took the advice of other commenters and made sure to give it more than needed cooking/stirring time.  It turned out wonderfully and tastes excellent.  My sole complaint is that I used/like a deep dish pie and used that pan.....and the amount of filling was really skimpy for the larger pan size.  Either increase everything by half or use a regular pie pan, not a deep dish!

Beautiful to look at and delicious. It set up perfectly but needs to be kept at a rolling boil for a few minutes both before and after the yolks are added. I had some extra egg whites so I used 5 to make the meringue and this was just enough. Beat the meringue at high speed for 6 minutes or so, adding the sugar 1 tbsp at a time. Thanks, I will be making this again.

This is with out a doubt one of my favorite pies.  My grandmother actually made this for me, but since she can't see well enough to type, I'm writing the review for her.  She beat her eggs in a kitchen aid and got the meringue about a mile high.  It browned beautifully and tasted like heaven.  Thanks for sharing this one Jane!

It was awesome.  Set up was just right if you go right with the recipe.  I used a lard based pie crust and it was flaky.  Definitely a hit in our family.

This recipe did not work for me.  It tasted good but did not set up.  Maybe it was the meringue - had trouble getting that to the consistency it needed to be.  Although it looked good, the pie actually got more liquidy after putting the meringue topping on.  I'm rating it a 4 because the taste was good and it probably was my method.  Will try again and come back and adjust rating.

I followed the directions exactly and it turned out perfect. Set up great and sliced even better. Just like my Mother's. I have made this 4 times and never failed. I even changed out the coconut for a can of drained pineapple tidbits in one of the pies and it was great! I think you could use this recipe to make just about any flavor pie you want.

I made this pie pretty much just as the recipe is (maybe cooked the filling a bit longer than a minute just in case). Only added a bit of coconut extract and toasted coconut to the top for looks. It was spectacular!!! Can't wait to make it again.

I followed the directions to a "t" on this recipe and the amount of filling this recipe makes is much more than for one pie crust.  The filling never did set up for me and the meringue was a flop!  Not a good recipe for coconut cream pie!!!

I made this pie for my Dad's birthday, he LOVES coconut cream Pie.  I don't think of myself as a great pie baker because my Mom makes GREAT pies.  After my Dad tried the pie I made he gave me one of the biggest complements ever - He said that my mom needed to get my recipe.  I had no proplems with this recipe although I did use the Never-Ever-Fail Meringue recipe with it.

very good.  pretty close to the same recipe you would find in the betty crocker or better homes and gardens cookbook.  try not to get impatient and turn the heat too high...it's really easy to burn especially if you don't constantly stir until thick.  overall i'd make it again.

Absolutely divine!  Most of my family is lactose intolerant, so I made this with Lactaid milk and it worked extremely well.  It's such a relief to finally find a recipe I can make easily while still customizing to make it lactose-free.  

The only problem I had was the decision to only make one pie: The fights over the leftovers were quite intense. :)

This pie was absolutely delicious and easy to make after reading others reviews.  I made one different choice in my ingredients.  I used a 15 oz can of cream de coconut from the Goya section of the grocery store and one cup of skim milk instead of the two cups of milk. Everything else I did to the word.  I tried using the double boiler method but it wasn't heating up quick enough and my hand was killing me from the constant stirring so I abandoned that and just used it directly on the heat.  I did follow others directions to allow a longer boiling time and it thicken beautifully!  I allowed it to cool for over an hour while we ate dinner and cleaned up before putting on the meringue topping.  However it didnt come out like i had hoped but still covered and stuck to the pie.  Overall delicious and I am completely saving this recipe!!

Perfect.  For years, I have enjoyed the homemade pies served at Tuck's Cafe, a small diner up in Paynesville, MN.  The coconut is my favorite and this lives up to it.  It will go straight into the family heirloom cookbook.

I loved this pie (the second time around)!!  You must follow the recipe EXACTLY otherwise it will not turn out.  I forgot to put the filling back on the burner for the second time-big mistake!  Just be sure to bring to a hard boil and follow instructions and you will have a beautiful pie!!

I have cooked for over 40 years. I never had the nerve to try a coconut cream pie from scratch. I tried this and it was so easy, I couldn't believe it. My family was crazy about it and the pie was gone in one day. No more pudding mix pie for me. This will be my coconut cream pie recipe from now on. Thank you for this website. I have passed this along, with the recipe, to my daughters.

It was delicious, but a little runny, but that's probably because I didn't refrigerate it long enough. It was very sweet and sugary, I think next time I will substitute splenda so it's not as sweet, I'm not too big on sugary sweet tastes.

This is THE most fabulous old-fashioned coconut cream meringue pie!  This is my husband's favorite pie and I make it for special occasions.  It's not easy, but well worth the effort.  I agree with the other raters who say to be patient and cook slowly.  ENJOY!

As far as taste, this was excellent.  However, the filling turned into soup after it was baked.  And yes, I followed all the tips about cooking longer, and  chilled it for over 2 hours before baking.  I used the 'never fail' meringue recipe from this site, and that part turned out perfect.

Stop right here!  This is the classic pie you are looking for.  Just remember to take a tablespoon of the 1 cup coconut to set aside and sprinkle on the meringue.  Thanks, Jane--my family LOVED this, and it will be a regular dessert in our home.

Wonderful recipe...very rich & creamy. This was my first time making a coconut pie and it came out wonderfully.  It set perfectly; I don't understand either why the others did not work...maybe they did not let it chill completely. It's definitely a keeper for me!!!

I cannot understand how others had problems with
this pie.  I have been using it for about a year
or so and always have GREAT success.  It helps

I'm not a novice pie maker, and this pie just didnt turn out. It looked beautiful, but the filling just didnt set. I cooked the filling for plenty of time, letting it come to a rolling boil for several minutes, so it's NOT that the cooking time needed to be increased. Not sure what the problem is with this recipe, but I will not be making it again.

This is really easy and good!!!  The next time I make it I am going to decrease the coconut to 3/4C.  I also used unsweetened coconut.  You can find it in your natural food isle at your grocery store.  You should soak it in warm water for about 30 minutes first to soften, drain very well.  Enjoy!!

This was my first effort at a coconut cream pie. I took it to an older lady at work who missed her mother's pie and she said it was great. My second effort is in the oven now and my husband is pacing. Thanks!!

This was incredible! I made it for my mom's birthday, and ended up having to make 3 more by the end of the week. Huge hit- for one pie, I added an extra bit of cornstarch and then pie cherries, and another I cut the sugar in half and added a chocolate bar. Both turned out wonderful, and everyone loved them :) Thanks for sharing!

This pie is just like my Mom made when growing up in NC! My friend loved this pie, I make it almost every holiday and esp. on Father's Day. I used coconut milk and flavoring for extra coconut flavor. Very delicious!!!!

I have made this recipe for two years and it's a hit at parties, work, and holidays. I have added my own twist though. I cut the vanilla extract to 1/2 teaspoon and add a 1/2 teaspoon of coconut extract for a little more flavor.

Wow, this was excellent. I Used "Heartland Granola" premade pie crust--healthy and delicious. I used only one tbsp of butter, and subbed coconut oil for the other-gave it an extra coconut-y flavor. This was too sweet, I might cut back on the sugar next time. The meringue separated from the filling, so next time I will not cool the filling first, but will put the meringue directly onto the hot filling and bake. And yes, there will be a next time, yum!

This recipe also turns out great in the microwave.  I added the first three dry ingredients with 1/2 cup milk and mixed until smooth then added the remaining milk.  Microwaved for 3 1/2 minutes, stirred, microwaved for 3 1/2 minutes.  Mixed in the egg yolks as directed.  Microwaved an additional 1 1/2 minutes.  Then added the remaining ingredients.  It turned out perfect.  No lumps without the constant stirring required on the stove top.

I feel like Randy Jackson, but it was 'just ok' for me. I don't know what it was about it though. It was a little too sweet for me, which is strange because I really like sweet! I guess the problem was that I had something in mind that I wanted and sadly this wasn't it. I don't think I'll make it again.

This recipe is a KEEPER!!! very easy to make..turned out perfect..even cut nicely, which doesnt happen with all cream pies!!! Great flavor, but will use less sugar next time.  I love to cook, and am always on here looking for new recipes.  Great place to get them.

My husband LOVED this pie. I found it really simple(as I am NOT a cook by any reach of the imagination). 
It was a little on the really sweet side but great just the same!
Thanks for a great recipe!

This was runny even when I cooked it for 5 minutes longer and added an extra tbsp of cornstarch.  i did NOT like this pie.  it was way WAY too sweet.  However, my family does not like meringue so i topped it with whipped topping instead.  That may have been the problem.  Do not make this pie with whipped topping.

It's very sweet ,I guess I like a more subtle sweetness.I made this 3 times;The first time I cooked it a bit longer because I read the reveiws ,in  which some reveiwers complained that 1 minute wasn't long enough ...that adjustment and this recipe turned out great;The Second was great.;The third I thought I would follow the recipe exactly, but in the end it seemed more dense.It did not have the smooth and creamy ,yet firm enough to stand texture that I like  .

Pie was good, but not for a novice. I have had much better luck and better reviews with coconut cream pudding for the filling.

My husband said this was the best coconut pie he has ever tasted. The pie turned out so pretty- the only thing is I use the "never fail meringue" on this site (its the best). I will definately make this over and over again.

This is so easy.  And you can't mess up the meringue.  Of course instead of a bought pie shell I make my own.  Big hit at holidays or when my father in law comes to visit.  His favorite.

I made this twice now. The first time I cut down the sugar in the meringue to 4 Tbsp but the pie was still very sweet. It did thicken fine though with some extra cooking of the filling as others suggested. The second time I cut down the sugar in the filling to 1/2 cup and in the meringue to 3.5 Tbsp--still too sweet. I don't know if I'll try again but if I do, I'll cut the down on the sugar even further.

great recipe to start with -only 4 stars since I played with the recipe :)
 I doubled everything except the sugar and used canned coconut milk in place of the milk - like most reviews suggested I doubled the cook time. I also toasted the coconut I added to the filling and then stirred in untoasted coconut to the topping. 
I used unsweetened coconut from traders joes and it turned out plenty sweet for my family

This was good. I used 1 cup coconut milk 1 cup 2% milk. It's not the best coconut cream pie in the world but it does the trick. It didn't make enough filling to fill my pie crust, I did not use meringue. I made whipped cream and topped it with toasted coconut. I will try meringue next time, when I'm having a guest I know enjoys it.

Excellent recipe! i cooked it an extra minute both before and after adding the eggs, and used  1/2 coconut milk, 1/2 milk.  This will be a regular in my pie rotation!

I love love love this recipe.  It is our families all around favorite.  It does have a lot of steps, but it is worth it!  I follow the recipe exactly and it works beautifully.  Actually, I do add an extra egg white to the meringue but not an extra yolk to the cream part.

I made this pie for my 48th birthday! My birthday is in June, so I wanted something really good, and summery. I made the graham cracker crust, instead of making a flour crust. The only change I made to the recipe, was using fresh coconut milk. I used 1 cup, in place of milk. The pie was absolutely fabulous! The whole family loved it! I will definitely make it again!

I'm sorry, but I was not impressed at all with this pie! I am with those who could not get this pie to set up. It turned out very runny & this comes from someone who has made pies for the better part of 35 years! I know to boil the custard, & for how long. I followed the directions to a "T" as this recipe is written, & ended up with a soupy pie! It doesn't deserve more than 1 star in my honest opinion. It was also too sweet for my taste, but I realize that's just personal preference. Wish I could give it a better rating, but I will not be making another attempt at this one. :/

I am so grateful that this recipe turned out! I actually LOVED the pie, I only gave it a 4 because of the amount of time it took. I used 1 can of coconut milk as per another reviewers suggestion and topped up with milk for the remainder. I made sure to over boil my milk and then over boil once the egg yolks are in there. It turned out perfectly. I can only assume that for those of you that had runny custard, you just didn't boil it long enough. I just wish it didn't take so long to make this.

I didn't have coconut pudding so I used the vanilla and added coconut oil, maybe 2 Tbs.  I also toasted the coconut before adding to the pie mixture.  Delish!!!!  Definitely keeping this recipe on hand.  Thanks!

This is an amazing pie! A few years ago my Aunt told me she wanted me to make her a coconut pie. I got on here and started looking for a recipie and found this one. I made it a few times before hand (she wanted it for christmas). It was the best pie I've ever ate. I am still making it. However I use 1/2 cup of starch, and I seperate my eggs then put the yolks in the fridge allowing the whites to get room temp. before I even began. I also add extra coconut in the filling. oh so yummy!! Thank you for this recipie it's the best!

I LOVE coconut cream pie, and this was the best I've ever made.  I followed the advice of others and cooked it longer than the recipe says and, voila!  It came out perfect.  And it is just as magnificent to look at as taste.  A real crowd pleaser.

I baked this pie exactly but the filling turned out to be like soup.  The filling was great tasting, and was perfect before I baked it, but after it was cooled off and we tried it I had to spoon the filling out of my pie pan.  I was very disapointed with this recipe.

i baked this pie exactly as it instructs but it turned out more like coconut soup. and where is the cream of tartar in the meringue? i feel as though if i wouldn't have even baked it, it would be fine...if i would've just topped it with whipped cream flavored with some coconut or something. we ate it out of bowls with spoons and the flavor was good, but why didn't it set up? i don't think it was me.

I think this pie tasted wonderful! I love coconut cream pie, and yes this tasted traditional. I agree it was a little runny but I think if you keep it refrigerated long enough it will turn out really nice. My pie looked really good coming out of the oven, but after sitting out for a while got runny. Please keep the pie cold and boil it for longer than the recipe calls(a min. or 2 more) ! Personally my family and I will eat this kind of leftover for breakfast if you would too, in that case you should double the recipe. I would definatly reccomend this to any hungry cooks out there!

I'm always trying new recipes.  I love to cook for my family.  I tried this for Easter (shoul've tested it out first), and I was a bit embarrassed.  Although it tasted great, it was a bit runny.  Next time I'll look at the reviews first, and then go from there.  I'll definitely try it again, but boil it a bit longer.

This pie did not set at all!!! I followed the directions exactly and even followed other reviewers advice to cook a bit longer so it would set. It didn't work. It has great flavor and would have been a very good pie had it set and stayed firm. I was surprised conidering the cornstartch to milk ratio. Maybe reduce the sugar a bit and increase the cornstartch????

I must have done something wrong with this because when we cut into it, it went everywhere.  I am figuring it was something I did - not the recipe.  But the pie still tasted fantastic.  I used the never fail meringue from this site which was amazing.  I want to try this recipe again to see if I can fix what I did wrong last time!

I followed the advice of the reviewers and increased the boil time, but it was still a little runny. Still, my boyfriend said it was one of the best pies he's had & he's a coconut cream fanatic!

Since my grandma isn't nearby to make this on Thanksgiving, I've resorted to making it myself.  This is the best recipe I could find.  Tastes just like grandma's!

Coconut cream pie is my husband's favorite and he always begs for me to make him one. In the past, every recipe I tried failed. This one was perfect. I do let it boil a little longer than one minute in the beginning just to make sure it's thick enough. The consistancy and taste are wonderful. This is a keeper!

My husband made this pie for Thanksgiving.  I am not that big on Coconut Cream Pie, but this was devine.  I really enjoyed eating several pieces of it.  I will keep this in my recipe box for years to come.  Thanks.

Made this for a dinner party for a friend who LOVES anything with meringue on top of it and it was a hit.  Rich and simple to make.  Perfect.

it tasted okay. i had no problem with it setting.my children really didnt care for it. i think it would taste better without coconut.and with more milk added.i really would recommend this recipe for a pudding. with fruit and nuts added. this pie makes me want to stick with store bought creme pies. im still searching for a good coconut cream pie recipe.

I made this recipe twice, once with the meringue and once without.  Both times it would not set up but came out more like coconut cream soup.  Not a keeper
