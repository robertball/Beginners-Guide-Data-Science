I made this pizza tonight, and it turned out excellent;  however, I did have to make a few alterations.  I ended up using two (8-ounce) cans of Pillsbury® refrigerated crescent dinner rolls instead of one because one can did not provide enough dough.  I also did homemade hummus, which I added after pre-baking the crust for eight minutes.  I then added chopped, sautéed red onion on top of the hummus, along with the grape tomatoes, sundried tomatoes in olive oil (a great addition!), olives, and Athenos Tomato & Basil Crumbled Feta Cheese.  Then, I baked it for an additional eight minutes.  Perfecto!

Easy, tasty, and healthy.  I made this even easier by using pre-made Boboli pizza crust.  I spread the crust with the chopped rosemary and the olive oil and heated it in the oven.  We even put a little lettuce on top of the finished product.  This could be a good appetizer cut into small pieces as well.

Wow, this recipe really surprised me. It was very good and a hit with guests. I used red pepper hummus which was a great combo with the feta cheese. Then I topped with tomatoes. I omitted everything else, but thought it was perfect & simple.

Left everything as is and it was so good. It is an added plus that it is so quick and easy meal to make! **Update** I've made this several times now. Each time it gets better. You can add so many different things to this, like artichoke hearts, cucumber, bell peppers, and basically any vegetable would be good. I mix up the hummus flavors every now and then. I also started making homemade pizza crust to make it a bit healthier.  It is almost impossible to make this pizza wrong!

I have been making this for years, I make my own crust.  Also instead of just oil drizzled on top, try greek salad dressing that is what I do, so good.

I liked this recipe.  I will make it again. I gave it a 5 star rating because for what it is it is good. If you do not like Feta Cheese, you will not like this.  The party I took it too did not eat it.  They complained about the feta cheese and they didn't like the olives.  Picky eaters will NOT eat this.

This was very delicious.  I made my crust from scratch, though, using this recipe: http://allrecipes.com/Recipe/Colleens-Potato-Crescent-Rolls/Detail.aspx and for some reason I had to cook it a lot longer.

The aroma was so good, my family couldn't even wait, soon as I had it topped they were digging   in and I even forgot the olive oil but did get a chance to ad some pepperoncini rings, sooo good!
