These were EXCELLENT!  My little guy loves 'em!  A few small changes, I used a little less garlic (garlic can be toxic to dogs, so be VERY careful in how much you give them) and I used nutritional yeast, as brewers yeast can cause harmful bloat in bigger, deep chested dogs.  Nutritional yeast is said to work every bit as good as the brewers yeast for repelling fleas, but much safer on the canine system, with more vitamins.  I also put in some parsley to combat garlic breath.  Excellent recipe, my husky thanks you!

My dog LOVES these treats and won't eat store bought treats anymore.  I don't take the time to cut them into shapes.  I just roll them out thin and cut them in squares with a knife.  When I cook them, I make sure I get them completly dried out because they will eventually mold if moisture is left in them.  After the initial cooking and standing time, I turn the oven back on then off to "dehydrate" them in a warm oven.  With all the moisture gone, they will last until the last one is eaten.  I have made them several times.

Just for the record, garlic POWDER is much less toxic to dogs than the real thing, and even cloves of garlic don't bother them much as long as they're cooked.  Yes, raw garlic and raw onions cause hemolytic anemia in dogs, but I've never heard of garlic POWDER doing any damage at all--and I've been feeding a raw diet to my dogs for years.

It's a good recipe but definetly limit how many you give your beloved pooch. Garlic and onions can cause anemia in dogs and the smaller the dog, the less it takes.

I might also suggest you use low sodium beef boullion, especially with puppies and older dogs.

I followed the recipe then added 5 capsules of fish oil.  It's very good for the coat and skin, and it adds a bit of a different flavor.

This was a great recipe! Not only does it repel fleas, but it also clears your sinuses when you're making it...LOL! My beagles LOVE these treats. They don't care if they have fleas or not...they want those treats and they want them NOW!...LOL! Much cheaper to make these than the treats you buy in the store. Thanks!!

My dogs love these.  So far, no fleas and we live in hot, sunny FL.  I took the lazy way out.  Spread the batter onto 2 cookie sheets.  After 20 minutes, I removed them from the oven, scored them into bite size pieces then returned to the oven for overnight.  The next morning, I just broke them where scored.  I also used nutritional yeast and sodium free bouillon.  Thanks for sharing.

My dogs love these and it's a great way to give them the garlic they need to resist fleas!  Easy to make.  Only drawback (if it is one) is that they make your house smell heavily of garlic when you bake them.  I wouldn't do it when you're expecting guests.

My vet told me that garlic is a definite no no for dogs.  That, along with onions (which, over a period of time can kill either their liver or pancreas...as well as them), tree nuts of ALL kinds (peanuts are not tree nuts and are perfectly safe for dogs), grapes, raisins, are NOT safe for dogs to consume, and neither is chocolate...the caffeine can cause heart attacks.  Also, dogs do not need salt or sugar in any form added to their food.

Having said all that, I do cook for my dog.  Usually it consists of either ground turkey or ground beef, along with potatoes, rice, carrots, peas, green beans, sweet potatoes & hard boiled eggs.  I brown the meat, cook the rice, potatoes, swt potatoes, eggs separately, then add the rice and all the other ingredients and cook till heated through.  When cool, I put it into muffin tins, or even the silicone cupcake bakeware and cover with tinfoil or slide into a gallon ziplock freezer bag.  Once frozen, I dump them all out smaller freezer bags, or even sandwich bags (i.e. 2, or even 3 to a bag), then pack all those bags into a gallon ziplock freezer bag.  My dog took awhile getting used to it, but likes it now.  I add a bit of mashed up or chopped up pieces of cooked broccoli and stirred that in with it.  I switch off with the beef, and leave potatoes out, or leave one of the other ingredients out, just to shake things up a bit. Tomato products stain their coats and cause bad breath btw.

These treats were so easy to make & my dog loves them.  I followed another reviewer's advice by using "nutritional yeast" in place of "brewers yeast". Also, I made the following changes: "1-cup whole wheat flour", "1/2-cup cornmeal", and included "1 1/2 cups flaxseed meal"--for nutritional value.

I just want to say, that those flea drops from the vet caused respritory problems for my dog! Do your own research on the toxic ingredients that they claim are safe for our babies! We ceased using these products and you should to.  On a positive note.... I have made these treats over 10 times now, and my yorkie Simon LOVES THEM! We took a batch to my aunt for her dogs,and she called for the recipe when they were all gone, she said her dogs LOVED them! So easy to make and I want to say thank you for your recipe.......THANK YOU!  It's the only treat my doggie eats!!!!!

I absolutely love this recipe! it works wonderfully, i had a flea infestation and could not get rid of them until i found this recipe. I also add fish oil for the skin and fur, and parsley kind of worked for the breathe. Thanks a million!!

My Yorkie and my mixed breed little dog love these treats and I just want to say to all the people fussing about garlic this RECEIPE calls for GARLIC POWDER not real GARLIC. The GARLIC POWDER ISN'T HARMFUL TO DOGS! I checked with my vet he said that raw garlic and onions are harmful. Just like CHOCOLATE IS HARMFUL BUT WHITE CHCOLATE ISN'T.

Yah Garlic and onions are of the same family and both are not good for cats or dogs.  Best to just go to the vet get the drops for fleas and omit the garlic.  Otherwise an ok cookie

My Dog absolutely LOVED these! Unfortunately I couldn't find any brewer's yeast, and didn't realize until I had the dough half made that brewers yeast is unlevened... so I used 2 teaspoons of regular yeast instead, and they turned out fine! The texture is a bit softer, and "puffy" but my dog had no trouble chomping these down ;)

I'm not comfortable with using bouillon cubes in my food, let alone my dog's food! I decided to make chicken broth (chopped chicken breast, carrots, green beans, and broccoli) from scratch and go ahead and make the pups some chicken and rice while I was at it. I strained 1 1/2 C of the broth into a measuring cup before I added the rice. I've never used brewers or nutritional yeast before, and I found a web page with descriptions of different yeasts. It listed yeast extract as a substitute for brewers yeast and peanut butter as a substitute for yeast extract. So I threw about 1/2 C of pb into the dry mix with the broth :) Instead of 2 egg yolks, I used 1 egg. I used a 1 1/2 inch star-shaped cookie cutter and they came out super cute! My dogs are picky eaters and they rated this recipe 5 stars!

People PLEASE DO NOT USE GARLIC POWDER in your dog biscuits.  Yes, they may love it, Yes, it may help repel fleas... however, please read what the ASPCA says about Onions and Garlic, and dehydrated powders...

"All close members of the onion family (shallots, onions, garlic, scallions, etc.) contain compounds that can damage dogs’ red blood cells if ingested in sufficient quantities. A rule of thumb is “the stronger it is, the more toxic it is.” Garlic tends to be more toxic than onions, on an ounce-for-ounce basis. While it’s uncommon for dogs to eat enough raw onions and garlic to cause serious problems, exposure to concentrated forms of onion or garlic, such as dehydrated onions, onion soup mix or garlic powder, may put dogs at risk of toxicosis."

Easy recipe!!!! But i will reiterate what a previous poster said: Don't make these if you are expecting guests - - the smell is quite strong!  I made them on a day when the weather was great so I opened up the windows to air out the garlic odor.  My dog loves them... can't speak for the flea repelling quality right now though as he didn't have fleas before.... but will try we flea season comes back around!

Tiger, Buddy, and Hoover loved these. I hope they work with fleas later.  It made  a lot of little bone-shaped cut outs. They are still in the fridge in mid January and  holding up well.

I'm going to give my dog 2 a day and see how that works.  Should know in a few weeks.  He loves them.  I've just given him the last of 3 bakings and he still is scratching like crazy.  Guess I'll have to resort to Advantage or the like.  I still keep making them since he really does enjoy them.  Kind of healthy for him too, I suppose.

My dogs enjoy the treats I add cheese, I don't know if it's the addition of the cheese but I've done the recipe 3 times and each time it has been liquidity and I have to add more flour

I used the original recipe at first but found they don't last as long, turned moldy.  the second time instead of eggs I used two small jars of meat and vegetable baby food.  dogs liked them better and they lasted longer

My grandson and have made this receipe several for our dogs  and theylove them and it has help with the flea problem.   We did not roll them out, (we don't have much counter space.)  we did the drop method.  Also it is a quicker method.  We use the Knorr's flavorings (powered boullion). It comes in chicken, beef, pork so we can vary the treats.  We use whole wheat flour only. and follow the rest of the receipe.  It is totally awesome and a lot cheaper than store bought treats with a lot of additives.

I have three long haired chihuahuas (Dad, Mom and Son) and they don't like it when the doggie treat jug is empty, and they think that every time they go out to do their business and come back in they should have a "goodie". And I am disabled and when I make a batch I have to take and quarter it up and do a little at a time.
But I also read a few other reviews and there will be a few different things that I will change next time I do them. (which is after I get done writing this review) LOL
I also want to experiment with them and see if the kitty cats would like them cause I have 7 of them.
Thanks 
Kimberley

I find it upsetting that most of these dogs treat recipes are posted by people who don't do the proper research on what is good and not good for your little family member.  So some feedback about this recipe are; GARLIC IS TOXIC FOR DOGS. It  has been added to bad things to give K9s.  Flour, even Whole Wheat flour is not good for dogs. Try substituting oats instead. Beef bouillon is very salty and not needed. It is not healthy for your dog. Try adding something to make this healthy for dogs. Like grated carrots, honey, minced chick peas etc. As a side note, dogs love chick peas and is very good for them.

Mac LOVES these!  He gets excited when he smells them baking and begs for a bite of cookie dough. They are also incredibly effective against fleas. I was also impressed how simple the ingredients are with this recipe and with other dog treat recipes on this site. Thank you from me and from Mac!!!

It took a while for me to find the brewer's yeast.  I finally found it and made these for my 3 dogs.  As soon as they were crisp enough I gave each of them a treat, and they ate them up immediately.

these are great they love them. I have seen allot post about the garlic and brewers yeast blotting. I buy brewers yeast for dog with garlic. It is safe for all dogs and I don't have to worry about any issues. Just a thought for those worried. and all I added was the 2/3rds  cup no extra garlic.

Dogs are not supposed to eat garlic because it can cause internal bleeding over time so I haven't made this recipe. Please check with your vet or at least look up the "no-no" lists before feeding your pets any people food. Know the risks and make an educated decision as to whether or not your willing to take it. The recipe itself looks awesome otherwise. Perhaps there is something good to sub in for the garlic? I'll see about that.

I made these last night, my little chi-minpin mix is crazy about them. I changed the cornmeal to oats and I used half rye flour. The only thing I didn't like was the smell it made in the house baking them. I had to open up the doors and let it  air out. I will be making these from now on, so much healthier.

I’ve made several batches of these for my dogs and friends dogs. They are excellent and work very well my puppy is still growing  125lbs currently and he can’t get enough of them. Garlic is only toxic in extreme high doses. This recipe doesn’t have enough to be toxic and my dog doesn’t get bloat from the yeast as some people say it causes in large breed dogs   Excellent recipe will continue to make them for friends and family

As someone else mentioned how much their beagle loves these, our 10 year old beagle Macy absolutely LOVES these and will go to the refrigerator and remind us if we go past the usual time she gets them. We have been feeding them to her ONCE a day for about 4 years now. We make them with TwinLab Genuine Brewer's Yeast from Amazon along WITH the garlic powder and there have been absolutely NO health issues despite all the dire warnings of doom from so many of the other reviewers. I understand that garlic/onion/allium is toxic to dogs, however, as our vet (who has been Macy's 'doggie doctor' since she was a puppy) said, the amount of garlic present in ONE treat would be miniscule (2 tbsp /30-50 treats) and along with the baking, would pose no significant health issues at once a day.

Just a heads up, any food from the allium family, including garlic is dangerous for dogs. It can cause a non-reversable  hemolytica anemia that can kill them. No onions, garlic, leeks, chives etc.

The dog treats turned out great - but I needed to almost double the amount of whole wheat flour!!!  The dough, as made per recipe, was almost soupy!!!  I couldn't even make "drop" cookies from it.  At any rate, with the adjusted flour amount, the recipe went well, and is now drying in the oven after baking!  Can't wait to try them (actually, my dog will try them!)

More of a question, have not made yet. I have a 130Lb yellow Lab. I want to make these but much bigger because the size shown would be more of a positive training treat, he'd eat a whole pan in a day. So I want to make bigger treats. Anyone have any recommendations on the proportions of ingredients because obviously these would be low for big treats

These are great.  Don't overfeed your dog these cookies so that he does not get too much garlic per day, but it is safe in small doses and even healthy.
