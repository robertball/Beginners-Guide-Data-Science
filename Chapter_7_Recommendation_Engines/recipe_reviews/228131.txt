Sorry everyone..that should be 2 teaspoons garlic! Go with your taste buds. I even turn this into a greek pasta salad. I just use feta cheese instead of parmesan cheese, add cucumbers, greek olives, tomatoes. Sometimes I will cube up some leftover chicken.  Toss it all with some dressing or I like to use my honey mustard vinaigrette.

This is a great little side dish that could go with virtually any meal.  I used half the amount of garlic because my husband doesn’t like strong garlic flavor, and it was still very good.

YUM! I used a bit more milk than called for b/c I wanted it creamier and less garlic just because I didn't want it to be too overpowering. This made a great side dish to our pork cutlets. I will be making this one again! Thanks for sharing. :)

This is a great recipe, but I made a few changes. I used about 1 Tblsp of dried parsley since I didn't have fresh.  I added 1/3 cup parm cheese since we like it cheesy and when I boiled the orzo I added half a cup of chicken stock for flavor. At the end I zested a lemon and juiced half and added it. It came out amazing! :-) very happy. Will make again!

I love this! I added my own twist. I sauteed onions in butter, then added the garlic, parm. cheese and milk and I tossed in some peas that I had in the freezer.

This recipe is delicious even though I alter the method somewhat. I love the look browning the orzo gives the final dish so I start with a couple tablespoons of butter in the pan and toss in the orzo and stir it around until some of the grains are slightly golden. I then toss in the garlic for about 30 seconds, stirring it around in the pan. Next I add the water (or some chicken broth if I have some in the refrigerator) to the pan, using only about a cup plus a splash. Close the lid and simmer until al dente. The pasta will absorb all the liquid with no need to drain. Each brand of pasta is different but I like to use the blue box variety and nine minutes is al dente and not starchy at all. So watch your pasta closely. Finish off by adding the milk (or cream) and freshly grated parmesan. I love the splash of color the chopped parsley gives this dish. Delicious simple side dish!

FIRST NOTE: there is a review correction from the submitter of this recipe.  She said that the garlic should be 2 teaspoons NOT 2 TB. ~ My DH and I loved this dish.  I've tried a few orzo dishes, that we liked, but this, hands down, has been our favorite.  I did not measure the milk, I just added it until it had the consistency I was looking for.  It paired very nicely with 'Simple Slow Roast Chicken' from AR and a tossed salad.  Thanks leogrl, for the recipe and your correction.

when I made this I just eyeballed the butter (country crock margerine)a big heaping tablespoon and I used 2 teaspoons of minced garlic (comes in a jar in liquid you store in the frig its the best without all the hassel). I also used a half cup of parmesan cheese (not fresh the kroger brand in the round plastic container and it still pulled in strings like fresh cheese)as well as a heaping tablespoon of dried parsley flakes (kroger brand) and a half a cup of vit D milk and it turned out fantastic!!! The reason I am writing this is just to say you dont have to go the expensive route to still get a great taste and I had all of these things in the house and didnt have to buy anything speacial this was a perfect size side dish for my 10 year old daughter and I. I served this with one large chicken breast cut in half and pounded coated with flower egg and galic and cheese croutons crushed (kroger brand) fried in the skillet with extra virgin olive oil (some things have to be the good stuff lol) would definately recamend this for a fast cheap and tasty side!!

This recipe is really yummy and easy. I have made it with the garlic and without, and I like it both ways. Now that I have made it a few times I plan to switch it up a little and add veggies or even some shredded chicken to the orzo. Great recipe and very easy!

Would be willing to try again with fresh parsley but my family wasn't overly excited with this dish. My four year old said, "Mom, this isn't very good."

A lot of bang for your buck on this one.  Packed with creamy, buttery, Parmesan-y flavor and couldn't be easier to prepare. Not that it makes a huge difference, but I chose to use half-and-half (and might have even used heavy cream if I had some open) rather than the milk.  This is an ideal side dish for practically any meat - beef, veal, chicken, pork - I can think of.

This is a well-liked recipe in my home, even my two picky eaters (who've told me it tastes like mac & cheese) love this dish.  I've made this recipe with both the 1/4 cup of butter, and with only 2 Tablespoons.  Both are equally delicious, we just add more milk (1/4 cup up to 1/3 cup) if using less butter so that it doesn't stick together so much.  Like another reviewer mentioned, I also add in more Parmesan (about 1/3 cup) because we love cheese!  Be sure to use fresh Parmesan for this, the stuff that comes in a can just isn't the same quality!  (And just a little time-saving tip - after buying a big wedge of Parmesan cheese, I bring it home and grate it all up and then freeze it.  It won't freeze together, so you can just scoop out what you need.  This way, you have fresh good-quality Parmesan with the convenience of canned.)  While I definitely prefer the fresh ingredients, if I find myself in a time-crunch I will substitute 1/2 teaspoon of granulated garlic and 1 teaspoon of dried parsley with great results.  Oh, and I also leave out most of the pepper, my girls wouldn't eat it otherwise!  Great recipe, makes for a quick and delicious side dish!

Wow! Didn't realize how much buttery this really was for such small amount of orzo. Next time will make appropriate adjustments. ...kind of gross. Even my husband mentioned how much greasy this side dish tasted...and he LOVES butter.

This was delicious.  Made it almost exactly as written except that I added fresh basil instead of parsley.  Also added some garlic salt.  Everyone loved it!

This was a quick, easy side that reheats well as a leftover.  My garden parsley is frozen here this time of year so for color I added a bag  of frozen green peas the last minute of the pasta cooking.  Nice color and taste but I would have given it 5 stars even without the peas!

I made this two nights ago. My local grocery store didn't carry orzo so I used linguine noodles. I also added chicken to the dish. I put about half a cup of milk to make it creamier. It was soooooooo delicious!!! I will definitely be making this again in the future (:

This was very delicious. Made  it as a side dish for Sunday's meatloaf dinner. My son came over for dinner and really enjoyed it, as well as my hubby. (whose dad was a chef and it kinda picky about bland foods)  I doubled this recipe and we had it again the next night. Re-heated very easilly in the microwave. I will make this again.

This is a great basic recipe and my daughter loved it but for me it just seemed to be missing something. It was a little bland. Next time, I'll add some more herbs to try and give it more flavour.

I offered to make dinner tonight (wife readily agreed) and decided to pair my marinated and breaded chicken tenders with orzo. But I wanted something better than plain orzo, yet simple and tasty.  This recipe was certainly simple enough, but both my wife and I were exceptionally pleased with the flavor.  This one is a "keeper" in our favorites cookbook!!

If you're using salted butter there's no need to add more salt (parm is very salty already). I used dried  good quality parsley and eyed it. I prepped the butter and 2 cloves fresh minced garlic in the same pot I made the orzo in while it was draining, added the garlic after the butter was well broken and simmered for a few minutes before adding the cheese and milk. Great mild flavor. I tossed mine with sweet peas and it's fabulous. Served with lemon oregano roasted chicken thighs. Yum!

I loved this orzo dish, but sadly the others did not. I made it by the recipe, but probably added a little more cheese.

.  We sautéed shrimp with the garlic and then added orzo.  We had it as main dish rather than side dish.  It was great!! Next time I may add some Cajun seasoning.

This was very good, but next time I would make a few changes.  I wouldn't add as much milk at the end, I would use about 1 tbsp, and instead of adding the parmesan into the hot orzo, I would put it on top of the individual servings, because it melted into the orzo in clumps instead of distributing evenly.  I actually used shredded Asiago, as that's what I usually have, maybe I was supposed to use a grated cheese instead of a shredded, the recipe didn't really indicate which one to use.  I also used twice as much parsley, just because I really love parsley, but it's not necessary. But I would like to make it again, and probably will.

A new family favorite pasta side dish. I have one question though. I assumed that 2 teaspoons of "minced garlic" referred to bottled minced garlic, not minced fresh cloves. Is that correct? As I prepared it, the garlic flavor was too intense, so I'd want to cut back next time. Otherwise great comfort food, even for a slightly picky eater, and super easy.

Pretty good! Make sure not to brown the garlic too much otherwise it would definitely ruin the taste. Thanks for this recipe!

Everyone loved it! That one cup of orzo fed five of us and we had plenty left over for seconds.  Great garlic-y taste and very easy to make.

This was a good side dish, and really would work well with other pastas as well.  I did use half and half instead of milk, because that's my preference.  Thanks for the recipe!

Good. Recipe didnt specify grated or shredded parmesan.. all I had was grated.  I would use less next time; only because it was too salty.

It was bland and I had to doctor it up quite a bit.  Also, my family thought it was quite oily from the amount of butter used.

Delicious! Mine came out a bit greasy, but I guess it's to be expected because of the amount of butter. I used freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese and used unsweetened almond milk because that's what I do. Next time I might reduce the butter, use some olive oil, and reduce the cheese a little bit to make it "healthier".  I can see how the dish can be too powerful on its own - probably should be eaten with a nice chicken dish and a great glass of wine.

Outrageously bland... I’ve had better side dishes from the dry paper packets at the grocery store. 

For the love of god, do NOT cook your garlic for 5 minutes, that is WAY too long! Have your next ingredients measured and ready and put them in THE MOMENT the garlic begins to change color.

I made this dish with a few adjustments... I added 1/2 pound fresh large shrimp, 1/3 cup lump crab meat to the butter (added a slither more butter) and fresh minced garlic and sauted it.  I also seasoned the shrimp with Chef Paul Prudhomme's Seafood Magic seasoning and pepper.  I squeezed a fresh lemon over it while sauteing it.    Then I added my orzo.  Stirred over low heat.  Then added the milk and parmesan cheese.  Stirred again over low heat until well blended and the cheese was melted.  It was absolutely delicious!

This was so tasty! I paired it with a cast iron skillet grilled pork tenderloin, it was a match made in heaven. This side is going into our regular rotation for sure. 
Because I wasn't clear at first, I want to say I used one cup of COOKED pasta; not a cup uncooked pasta which ends up being about two cups when it's done and I think would be bland with this about of sauce. I also splurged on parmigiano reggiano, with such a simple recipe the superior flavor of the true Italian parmesan shines and was completely worth the added cost. The only thing I changed was using half and half in place of the milk. Thanks for this lovely recipe Colleen

I didn't have any parsley so used fresh basil instead. Otherwise, I made it as written. It was delicious. My 4-year-old loved it - such a better alternative as a side than some boxed mac-n-cheese!

This is great on its own or as a side dish. I used dried parsley because I didn't have fresh and it turned out fine. I also added grape tomatoes.

Ok, so I'm an experienced cook and I followed this to the letter. I used high quality parm cheese. It was completely flat. I tried to enhance the flavor but couldn't get there. I'm not going to make this again. It was fine but very bland.

I make this quite often,  sides well with Chicken, or stands alone with a salad and crusty bread. Thanks for the great recipe. I don't change it at all, but I don't use exact measurements.

We loved this recipe!!   I'm glad I caught the "two teaspoons" of garlic change, as that was exactly enough for us.   I didn't make any changes, and I will definitely make it again.  Hubby suggested adding minced onion as well,  so might try that next time.

This is a great side dish! We made it to accompany grilled salmon. It was a bit flat for our liking, so I added 2 tsp of white wine vinegar (any vinegar or even lemon juice would probably do the trick too). I will make again with my minor adjustment.

This was creamy and delicious.  Definitely cut the butter - not more than a Tbsp. is needed. To save on cleaning a pot, I sauteed the garlic, then added the orzo, and let it toast a bit, then added the water. To add flavor, I put a shake of chicken-flavored soup mix in with the water. My kids gobbled this up.

This was a relatively simple side dish that amazed the family.  The parents are first-time tasters of orzo, so this gave them a nice starting place.  We all loved the taste, and it is inspiring us to modify by adding our favorite vegetables.

Ridiculously, unbelievably good. YUM!!! Only things I changed were to double the recipe (made a ton, but I didn't mind!), use dried basil as the herb because that's what I had, and add a handful of real bacon bits. I tasted before and after the bacon and it was actually better before so I'll leave that out next time. This is perfection!!

This is exactly what I wanted as a side dish today with my chicken.  I made 1 serving (1/4 cup) and used dry parsley (will plant fresh parsley ). This was the perfect side with chicken and salad.

We were disappointed because this was not fantastic. It lacked flavor and everyone agreed when I added peas it seemed to help. The cheese made it all clumpy.

Made this easy side dish several times. Our entire family loves it. My 15-year-old son always finishes the bowl. A nice change from potatoes or boxed rice mixes.

We really liked this dish. I cut back on the butter a bit (only used about 2/3 of what the recipe called for) and garlic (used about 1 tsp instead of 2 because my husband can't eat a lot of garlic and there was garlic in the shrimp I was cooking too) and tossed in a seeded and chopped roma tomato for the last few seconds of cooking the garlic and it was fantastic. My husband doesn't normally comment on dinner, but he did tonight.
Served it with shrimp (baked in white wine, butter, salt, pepper, garlic and leeks) and a side of sauted carrots, broccoli & celery.
It's a nice change from rice or traditional pasta and definitely worth putting in our rotation.
Thanks for sharing!

This was fantastic!  Only made a few small tweaks... I used chicken broth to boil the orzo instead of water, used half the amount of butter (1/8 cup {or 2 Tbsp.} was plenty in my opinion), and used 1 tsp. dried parsley instead of fresh.  Also, I used the shredded parmesan that you find in the dairy case and it melted beautifully.  The whole thing was absolutely delicious... I will be making this quite often.  Thanks so much for the recipe!

This was very good, but a little greasy for my taste.  I even used margarine instead of butter since that is what I had on hand.  Next time I will cut that down a bit.

I LOVED this dish.  Only I added a couple beef bouillon cubes to the water and then added a can of drained/rinsed black beans.  Perfect pairing with Steak tips.

Simple and good.  This is essentially buttered noodles.  Nice neutral side dish that could accompany a variety of main dishes.  Will definitely make again but with modifications.  My rating is based on the amount of butter used.  Waaay too much for orzo.  A different pasta could possibly accommodate such a large amount of butter but orzo is too small.  Even reducing butter amount by half  is advisable.  I had some heavy cream that needed used up so I substituted the milk with it.  Still would recommend this

This turned out good.  Had to use dry parsley b/c that is all I had on hand.  Used 3 cloves of garlic and about half the butter called for.  My husband even liked it and he doesn't like rice type things which this is more like than an actual pasta.

Eh. I thought it was too salty and kinda boring. Would need to add some more ingredients to bring flavor to this dish. (And this coming from someone who is happy to eat plain spaghetti noodles with butter or just cheese on bread as a sandwich)

I am really into garlic so used 3 cloves; didn't have any parsley so used freeze=dried oregano. Hubby loved it!

I have to say, even with the two tablespoons, with the way it was prepared, again, with the herb and beer braised rabbit, it turned out fantastic.  Good to know, though!!!:)  Thanks!

Yum....this was very good...not that complicated of a recipe...pretty standard stuff, but still good and easy for those not familiar with cooking orzo.
