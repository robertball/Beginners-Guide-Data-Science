Use a jelly roll pan and bake at same temp/same time for a more "bar" like result. Still very moist and chewy this way.  To make this a "finger food", cut into 2x2 squares to serve.   I only had 2 eggs on hand and it didn't alter the recipe.

The most moist cake I have ever baked. Everyone loves it. Frost the cake and then cut in to bars. Too moist and soft to frost after you cut.

This is a good recipe, but like other reviewers suggest, it is a cake, not a bar. The cooking time is incorrect also, it takes much longer than the time stated. I cooked mine for about 55 minutes and it turned out to be a really light fluffy cake. Also in addition to the 2 tsp cinnamon I added about 1/4 tsp cloves, some nutmeg, allspice, and ginger. The taste was great. Overall, we enjoyed it, it is tasty, just not a bar.

This is a great recipe! My family has made this exact recipe for years. Co-workers can't wait for fall just so I will make these bars and bring them to work. I do not like pumpkin pie, put I love these bars and the frosting!

I really liked this...it was more like a cake than bars.  It was big and fluffy, and even more so with the cream cheese frosting.  Everyone at Thanksgiving liked it.  I had to increase my oven temperature by 25 degrees and bake an additional 20 minutes over the original recipe instructions but that didn't bother me.  I also liked it because I already had all the ingredients in my pantry.

These were a big hit with my family. Easy to make using common ingredients. My oven cooks on the hot side, so I didnt have to adjust the bake time at all. I also made muffins from this recipe by reducing the bake time to 19 minutes.

We call this Pumpkin Bread and make it for breakfast.  Pumpkin is loaded with Beta Caratene which converts to Vitamin A.  So, it is great for the eyes.  The kids love it.  I altered the recipe to make it healthier-low cholesterol & low fat.  I use 8 egg whites since I am allergic to egg yolks.  I substitute apple sauce for the oil, use wheat flour instead of white flour, and use honey instead of white sugar.  I add 1 teaspoon nutmeg, 1/4 teaspoon ginger, & 1/4 teaspoon cloves.  After it is in the pan I sprinkle generously with pumpkin pie spice on the top.  I leave off the cream cheese icing because it is sweet enough without it.  This makes a great fall breakfast dish.

I first had these pumkin bars when I stopped in at an amish bakery in Northern Michigan, and my niece and I fell in love with these cookies. When I got home I searched the net for the recipe and found this one and it was just as sweet, we love 'em

This is a great alternative to pumpkin pie, a nice way to keep up with the traditonal holiday pumpkin with a whole different flavor. Everyone loved it, including myself who doesnt even like pumpkin!

Very good!  I used Organic Pumpkin Puree (from World Market) instead which is a little less thick than Libby's.  This seems to have helped to make a little more "bar" like instead of cake like.

I did not like this recipe. I baked them
for 30 minutes and they still were gooey. I baked them for an additional 25 minutes and they were still too gooey to eat!

Like others have stated, this is a cake not a bar. Made for a family get together and everyone said it was good but there were still leftovers. I thought it was a little bland and will follow the advice of others and add more spice like clove, nutmeg, or pumpkin pie spice. On the positive side it was a moist cake with good cream cheese icing that would balance out the extra spices next time.

As others have said, I expected bars but found it was a cake.  That is no matter to me because it is the moistest cake I've ever had!!  This is one of my favorite recipes ever.  My husband, who doesn't like pumpkin pie, loves this cake more than any other cake.  We prefer this recipe using only cinnamon instead of other recipes that add nutmeg and allspice.  My husband took some to work and his co-workers fipped over it.  One owns a bed and breakfast and wanted the recipe to start serving to his guests.  I made this for Thanksgiving and everyone loved it.  The cream cheese icing gives a nice tang.  This summer, I served with fresh blueberries on top. You will not be disappointed!  Now if I could only find a chocolate cake recipe as moist as this one...

This is great! I used 1/2 oil and 1/2 cinnamon applesauce and I added some pumpkin pie spice too. I also used my favorite cream cheese frosting recipe for this instead. It was gone in 24 hours! Thanks!

These pumpkin bars were a big hit this holiday season.  They stayed moist and they turned out to be very popular with party guests from Europe and the East, which was a happy surprise.

I've made these bars many times and every time I get asked for the recipe. It is more of a cake than a bar, but it is great just the same. Easy and scrumptious!

I use a jelly roll pan to bake this, so the pumpkin bars do turn out like bars and not a cake.

This was good...after a little tweeking.  I added some nutmeg and pumpkin pie spice.  30 minutes was not near long enough.  It needed 20 more minutes.  Also used less sugar for the frosting.  Next time I would use only 2 cups.

I made this recipe for the first time today, and it was just OK. My husband expected a "stronger" pumpkin flavor. I've tried other pumpkin recipes from this site, but I think I'll stick to the pumpkin pie bread. Thats been a hit with my family.

I liked this recipe a lot because I had most of the ingredients already in my pantry, it was sooo easy to make and it tasted great!  I had to cook it about 5 minutes longer than the recipe called for, but that's all. Also, I used Pillsbury cream cheese frosting instead of making my own. Tasted great!

Not a 'bar' but a nice cake.  Definitely add a little ginger, nutmeg and cloves.  I only added a little but I wish I had added more.  Didn't even use a mixer which was convenient!   One more thing:  I used a small single serve container of applesauce, put it in a cup and then filled it with oil.  (instead of using one full cup of oil). - the full cup of oil is not needed for a moist cake.

I've been making this recipe for about three years now, and my friends and family rave over it. In fact, they threaten to not let me come over unless I bring these bars. It's even a hit with people who don't like pumpkin.

I don't change the recipe at all. I've had to sometimes adjust the cooking time to be longer to accommodate different ovens, but as long as I insert a toothpick and it comes out clean, it's fine. When I do have to lengthen the time, I wrap the edges in foil to keep them from browning too much. 

Great recipe to have on hand for fall and the holidays!

Very good, quick, and very easy. My family enjoyed making and eating it. I did cut the vegetable oil in half. One cup seemed like a lot. Cake was still moist. I say cake because that was more of the consistency, although not as much cake resulted. I will add more pumpkin-favorable spices next time like allspice or nutmeg and ginger.

Amazing! I used half oil and half applesauce in place of the oil and used pumpkin spice instead of cinnamon. Huge hit! Will be making these again

Great recipe! Thanks for the tip to prepare in a jelly-roll pan. I also decreased the eggs by 1/2 due to using homemade pumpkin puree, which is often very watery. Came out perfect with the lowest amount of cook time. Came together quickly and performed perfectly.
