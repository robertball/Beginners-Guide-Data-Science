I have mixed feelings on this one and as this recipe's first reviewer I want to be as accurate as possible.  The shortening and buttermilk each contribute to ensure a moist cake, so no problem there, but of course you don’t get the rich flavor of butter – I might go half and half if I were to make this again.  The chocolate flavor was mild, more for looks than chocolaty taste. A 5.5 oz. can of chocolate syrup is not something I would typically have on hand – I simply measured it into a liquid measuring cup from the large Hershey’s squirt bottle. The ingredients and measurements are fairly standard, so I knew I’d come out with a decent cake.  It’s basically the execution and technique I had some issues with.  First, you aren’t going to “fold” the two batters, you’re going to sort of swirl them with a skewer, a knife or, as I used, a chopstick.  I’ve never been very good at marbling but it was nearly impossible when you have equal amounts of both batters. In other words, it would have been better to have considerably less chocolate batter, drop it by spoonfuls onto the white batter and then swirl it.   Also, this cake should be baked at 325 degrees, not 350.  The baking time will be longer, but you’ll end up with a more evenly baked cake.  This is a pound cake, after all, which is heavy and dense.  At the higher temperature of 350, the cake was done on the outside long before it was done on the inside.  I found this an acceptable cake, but not notable enough to make again.

Made this cake for a work pot luck.  This cake is moist but definately lacks in flavor.  It may be better if you used butter instead of shortening.  Should have done a test run for the family first.

This cake is a great easy cake to bake. And it taste great too. I love to cook but i'm not a great baker. The cake was moist and great tasting and best of all I didn't burn it.

I also baked it at 325 degrees for 75 minutes and it turned out great!
