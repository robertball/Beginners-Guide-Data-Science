5 stars for deliciousness but  for something so simple I had problems.  Inside dough did not cook well and there was too much caramel and nuts for stuffing.  Maybe because I used the "light" version of caramel?  I only added a little more of the listed ingredients to make 2 rather than one kringle.  Measure pecans before chopping.  It might not taste like the real thing but it is quite tasty.
