I made this cake twice and each time the people I served it to said it was delicious and moist.    I didn't make them in two separate pans but in a single 9" spring form pan and baked it for 40 minutes instead of 30 minutes.  Another thing I did do the second time around was whisk together the mashed potato and the milk to blend it more evenly as the first time the potato was more clumpy.  I also reduced the white sugar to 1/2 a cup as I found it a bit too sweet.

Wow!  This was a pleasant surprise.  It tastes a lot like carrot cake, but different enough that you can tell it is _not_ carrot cake - prompting enquiries of, "What the heck is in here?"  No one ever guesses potatoes!  This takes about 2 or 1.5 regular sweet potatoes.  The batter is wonderful and will make a cake with two layers nicely.  Mine did sag a bit in the middle after cooling but were still great.  I frosted with Caramel Frosting, which I just realised now I forgot to add the vanilla to.  A chewy moist cake that keeps well.

Cake turned out light, moist, and delicious. I didn't have dark brown sugar on hand so I used light brown. Couldn't find the allspice so I used nutmeg instead. I increased the amount of sweet potatoes to 1 1/2 cups and added a cup of sour cream for extra moistness. I frosted the layers with cream cheese frosting. This cake has the perfect texture with just the right level of spice. This one's a keeper.

I made this cake for some island friends and love it.
I used canned sweet potatoes instead of fresh and added orange extract to the icing to enhance the orange flavor.

This cake is wonderful. Moist and very good flavor. You can still taste the sweet potato even tho there's only 3/4 cup. I put 1 cup of rasins and run them through the chopper with a little of the Bmilk. I put Cream Cheese Frosting on it. I took it to a Church Supper. Everyone loved it.

I made this to use up some extra sweet potatoes I had leftover from Thanksgiving. It had a nice flavor, basically tastes like a spice cake similar to carrot cake. The texture was quite dense though, so I'm not sure I'd make it again. I like my cakes nice and fluffy. Next time, it's carrot cake or nothing!

Way too heavy. I like dense cake, but this was too much.Tastes more like spice cake.
