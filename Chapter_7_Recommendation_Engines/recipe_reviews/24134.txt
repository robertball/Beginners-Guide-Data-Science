These are wonderful! I am always looking for different recipes with pumpkin. Pumpkin is a great source of vitamin A. Making muffins, pancakes, cookies, bread, etc with pumpkin is a fun way for kids (and adults) to get that A. I did switch to half and half whole wheat flour and all purpose, used only 1 1/2 cups of sugar, and added cinnamon, ginger, and all spice.

SO EASY!  These tasted better than the muffins you get at the store.  I added a few extra chocolate chips and they still turned out great.

I made this recipe for Kindergarten treats.  More than one child came back for seconds.  The leftovers went to the teachers and to my husband's place of employment.  The demand for the recipe has been amazing!  I really like the feature on this site that lets you customize the size of the recipe.

These muffins have a good flavor but you have to eat them as soon as they cook or they get tough/dry due to lack of oil. They have a good flavor but I think they really need some oil added for texture. I've made these several times before deciding what was wrong.

My husband bought some pumpkin-chocolate-chip-cookies and they tasted so good I wanted to make some pumpkin-choc-chip-muffins for a brunch that I was hosting. I halved the recipe, used half whole-wheat flour, cut down the sugar to 1cup ( half white, half brown) and used pumkin-pie-spice instead of nutmeg. My batter was pretty thick  so I added a splash of milk and about 1/4c apple sauce to add moisture. The batter was plenty for 15 cupcakes-size muffins that rose beautifully and were done after 24mins. The muffins were absolutely delicious!! Very moist and rich. I did the calorie count and one muffin came down to only 150kcal!!! Next time I'll try substituting half the sugar for sweetener to cut down on the calories even more. Can't believe something this moist and decadent is actually fat-free!! Will be making again!

I cut this recipe in half BUT I cut the sugar in half again to 3/4 cup for 12 muffins or a half recipe. I only used 1 1/2 cups flour because for 12 muffins, that's usually what I use and I was afraid the muffins would come out dry if I added more flour.  Baking these at 350*, my muffins were done at just about 20 minutes. Thirty minutes and I would have had overdone muffins. These turned out okay but they didn't have much flavor. I think if I were to make these again, I'd increase the spices (like maybe use pumpkin pie spice) and I'd use some kind of fat (melted butter or vegetable oil) or even some cold brewed chai instead of plain water.

I divided the batter into two loaf pans and baked them for about 50 minutes.  We are enjoying one loaf now and freezing the second for later.  Fresh pumpkin puree worked well with this recipe.  The "muffins" turned out moist and delicious.

These turned out exactly as I hoped they would. Moist, and darker on top than the picture. They did not stick to muffin tins as some said, but I was generous in greasing them. Cutting the sugar to 2 1/2 cups didn't hurt them. Also, I increased the chocolate chips to 1 1/2 cups.

I made a half batch of these, and used canned pureed sweet potatoes instead of the pumpkin.  Major issue with this recipe: the cooking time.  I see some complaints about dark, dry muffins in the reviews.  No standard sized muffin should be cooked for half an hour.  I baked 20 minutes, perfect.
My kids are loving the sweet potato + chocolate chip combo.  Great way to dose them with vitamins A & C!

These are a little dark and heavy, but the combination of tastes is unique, and the chocolate adds some welcome moisture.

This recipe is so/so.  I wouldn't make it again.  The chips sunk to the bottom and stuck to the pan (which I did grease).  Definitely use paper liners for the muffin cups if you are going to try this recipe.  The flavor was not very good and tasted very eggy, but not much like pumpkin.  It makes 36 average-sized muffins.

No oil, no butter, but still plenty of moistness and flavor going on in these muffins.  My kids enjoyed these all week for an after-school snack.  I cut the recipe in half and it worked great!  Thanks for a low-fat, delicious muffin recipe!

my batch made 30 muffins... very good but i did make a few alterations. i did 2 cups of all purpose flour than 1 1/3 cups of whole wheat flour and did 1 1/2 cups white sugar and 1 1/2 cups brown sugar. i also used a whole bag of semisweet chocolate chips (we have major sweet tooths in this house!) the recipe was good the only thing i would change is maybe some more spices....the pumpkin didnt stick out enough in my mind.

These were great.  I had a lot of leftover pumpkin from thanksgiving (I'm Canadian so ours is in October) and I love chocolate so I was excited to try this.  I cut the sugar to 2 1/2 cups which was good but I upped the chocolate chips to 1 1/2 cups and you could barely taste pumpkin. Next time I will use only 1 cup.  Lastly I used pumpkin pie spice in place of nutmeg and next time I think I will use 2 tsp rather then just 1 as to enhance the pumpkin flavour.

WARNING: 30 mn at 400 is way too long if you are baking in standard muffin tins.  Start with 18 or 20 and add if you need to.  
Not the greatest pumpkin muffin ever, but perfectly workable. I used this recipe because the first one I came across had 1.5 C of oil, which seemed extreme.  I added 1 t of cinnamon and 1/2 of cloves, just 'cause I can't imagine pumpkin bread without those two spices.  
Also, I was using fresh pumpkin so I omitted the water. 
I intend to freeze them: hopefully they won't be too dry when I thaw and use next week.

This recipe has been in my box for quite some time.  I had some extra canned pumpkin from another recipe and I put it to good use in these muffins.  They turned out really moist and good.  My kids are already asking for another batch.

I added in 1tsp each of a cinnamon and ground ginger, and used dark chocolate chips, and these turned out great! Nice and crispy on top. I gave one batch away and I'm getting requests for the recipe.

This pumpkin muffin recipe was a great base.  I modified the recipe to make it more healthy.  2 cups of white flour were replaced with 1 cup of whole wheat flour, 1/2 cup of flax seed meal and 1/2 cup of wheat germ.  3 cups of sugar was replaced with 1 cup of white sugar and 1/3 cup of brown sugar was sweet enough. My kids added vanilla, nutmeg and cinnamon. No chocolate chips in the pantry and they still tasted great!

We made this without chocolate (b/c we were out) and they baked up thick and a bit sticky on top (too much sugar?). Not quite what we were hoping for. We'll keep looking for something lighter and more bready.

One main problem with this recipe: I followed directions and divided the batter into 24 muffin liners, but it was simply NOT enough batter for that many cups. I ended up with what amounted to muffin bottoms with no tops. If you want nice, poofy topped muffins, double the amount of batter or use only 12 muffin liners.

Aside from that, the muffins were delicious.

Very good recipe.  Used fresh pumpkin that I prepared and pureed myself rather then canned.  Very subtle but pleasant tasting, although muffins stick to cup.

These were so delicious ! I didn't put chocolate chips in them but still very good. I also put pumpkin spice and cinnamon in and at the top which made it great.

Okay, but not fabulous.  The second day they were very dense and solid.  I used 1 teaspoon of pumpkin pie spice instead of nutmeg. The cook time was way off.... mine only needed about 20 minutes.

Sadly I was not impressed with these. I followed the recipe exactly, but somehow ended up with burnt, dry nasty tasting muffins that smelled like burnt popcorn!? I had to throw them all out :(

The texture was not at all what I expected (sponge-y), but it was a yummy treat!  The chocolate chips really made it special.  I think next time I would add cinnamon and cloves so it would taste more like a pumpkin pie!

Very tasty; however, I changed a couple things so I don't know exactly how the original recipe tastes....probably just as good!  I changed the quantity to 12 muffins and used 1 cup white and about 1/3 cup whole wheat and 1/3 cup flax meal, just to add some more nutrition.  Used about a tsp. of vanilla too.  Instead of water I used oil after reading the reviews of it being dry, etc.  They are awesome!

These tasted pretty good.  I followed the recipe exactly, but in the end there was a lot of batter so I added more chocolate chips and about 3/4 cup of raisins.  This made 3 dozen good size muffins in a regular size muffin cup.  I was a little disappointed that it was so difficult to get the muffin out of the wrapper.  I guess that's because they didn't call for butter or oil, but next time I will do something different to avoid that.  Overall I was pleased.

These were great moist muffins!  And you can't beat that there is no added oil or fat - except for the chocolate chips.  (I used the mini chips)

DELICIOUS! I love pumpkin anything and was eager to try out this recipe. I substituted the chocolate chips with raisins since I feel their texture and earthy taste better compliments the pumpkin and spice flavor. Taking another reviewer's suggestion, I added more spices to this than suggested in the original: cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg and allspice, all of which this recipe benefits from. 
I expected the muffins to be dense since pumpkin puree is extremely heavy and moist. I used my KitchenAid mixer for the wet ingredients and slowly added the dry ingredients to the wet... I think this made for slightly lighter muffins.  My end result was 24 bright orange, spicy-scented muffins that my friends and roommates thoroughly enjoyed. Remember to grease the muffin tins WELL and use about a 1/3-1/2c of batter per muffin (fill the tin) because your muffins will develop a nice top this way. I can't wait to make this again!

This was a fun an easy recipe.  I used it to make mini muffins, baking for 18 minutes.  I read the other reviews and did make some changes:
1. Used whole wheat flour
2. Substituted water for 1/4 cup of oil and 1 cup of unsweetened apple sauce
3. Halved the sugar to 1 1/2 cups
4. Halved the salt to 1/2 teaspoon
5. Added 1 teaspoon cinnamon
6. Used a 15oz can of pumpkin puree

Delicious!  The eggs really make the muffins light and fluffy. Thank you Barb for a yummy pumpkin muffin recipe.

5 stars despite my own mistake! Lol 

I was flustered today on account of someone misplacing my baking powder. So I decided to make these instead. I was in a rush, and bad mood so I didn't read it clearly. I added 2 CANS (15oz each) Pumpkin puree. I couldn't figure out why I had enough batter for 36 Muffins lol They turned out amazing still, just a little denser and super moist. They stick to the paper a bit too, but its not a deal breaker, they still taste amazing. I consider these more of a cupcake, so I topped half with whipped cream, and the other half with chocolate frosting!

These were awesome! I made them back in the winter and then lost the recipe card that I wrote them out on to.  I just spent hours sifting through other pumpkin muffin recipes and am so glad I found it again.  They were moist and delicious, and freeze very well.  Can also be made into a loaf if cooked for a little longer at a lower temperature.  Thank you!

Both my husband and I agree these are awesome tasting muffins! I substituted half the amount of sugar with the appropriate amount of Splenda (no matter what the makers of Splenda say, it doesn't always work). My muffin tops looked pretty ugly unlike others' photos, and I suspect it's due to the Splenda. My husband didn't care what they looked like and said they were the best! Thanks for sharing such a great recipe!

Tasty muffins!  Very good recipe to cook with children...and one they like to eat.  My three-year-old ate six muffins as soon as they were cool enough.  I made mini muffins, reducing cooking time to 10 minutes for a pan of 24 mini muffins. I used 2/3 whole wheat flour and reduced the white sugar to 1 cup, adding 3/4 cup brown sugar with it.  I think I could even reduce the sugar further and not compromise the taste. I also reduced the water to 1/2 cup and added a bit more pumpkin.  They were not a bit dry. A perfect easy and delicious, and somewhat healthy recipe when you need to bake for a function with children.  I will use it again!

I made this following the recipe except that I used cooked pumpkin that I had in the fridge.  When I mixed it up it didn't seem like enouch chocolate chips to me, so I added about a cup more.  It was good, but not as pumpkiny as I would like.  It mostly tasted like chocolate chip muffins with a mild pumpkin undertone.  I think next time I would add more pumpkin and maybe leave out the water?  I just wanted more of a strong chocolate-pumpkin taste!  They were yummy though.

I liked these muffins.  I thought they were a bit "sticky" but yummy.  I did use 1/2 whole wheat flour and regular white flour.  I also added coconut flakes (when I stirred in the chocolate chips) and it was SO good.

These were really easy to make, and delicious! I used 1 cup brown sugar and 1/2 cup white sugar, and they came out at just the right sweetness with the added chocolate chips. I also substituted the nutmeg with a little cinnamon. The muffins came out at a perfect consistency. I will definitely be making these again soon!

I did add some cinnamon and pumpkin pie spice to the mix...and did not cook them for the full 30  minutes (I think it was closer to 20 - keep your eye on them and don't let them overcook.)  I wonder if those that had a bad outcome used too old baking soda?  I have already made them 3 times in the last 2 days - everyone wants the recipe!

My youngest son and I had great fun making these, but they are very sweet and very, I mean very moist. The second time I made them with less sugar and a little bit less water and I felt they worked better. Worth a try.

Didn't care for these.  Tasted eggy and they were dense, as others have mentioned.  I'm taking them to my son's class today...I hope they will eat them!  All in all, I was disappointed in these.  Also, I filled my muffin tins to the top and still had lots of leftover batter.  Could be spread out into 36 smaller muffins.  I would also add extra spices like some others have mentioned.

This recipe was very dissapointing.  I followed it exactly and the muffins were very dry and dense.  As I was making it I thought the recipe should have some sort of butter or oil in it and it didn't.  That made all the difference.  If I use this recipe again I will add oil.

I decided to do something different this year instead of pumpkin pie.  So I tried this muffin and my kids love them.  I added 1 1/2 tps of pumpkin spice and 1/2 c Skor bits to the receipe.  Awesome, I have already been told I have to make them again!!! Thanks

These were great! we all enjoyed these, they were moist, not dense at all and I could taste the pumpkin flavour through the chocolate.  Will save this recipe forever.

Waste of time.  I followed the recipe to the T, muffins came out heavy and bland.  I trashed all of them.

These muffins only get a 3 because of the consistency once cooked. I was excited to make these as they were simple and had ingredients that I had on hand at home. The flavor of these is good but they came very dense. It was much more like a bread. I did add 1 teaspoon of cinnamon to mine. It made 32 muffins for me.

These muffins were tasty; although they did not have as much pumpkin flavor as I would have preferred.  They were quite moist with an almost sponge-like texture.  They filled the (paper-lined) cups and rose up nicely while baking, but weren't particularly "eye catching" if you are looking to impress (visually).

At first I thought the sugar amount was a little much, but then when I tasted the muffins, they were perfect! Thank's Barb, hope you come up with more great recipes! P.S, If my family knew I added 3 c. sugar, they would kill me!!!

I cut the sugar in half. And instead of all the water added some vegetable oil to ensure moist muffins. To increase the fiber I used half whole wheat and half white flour.

Good muffins!! Did not have chocolate chips, so I added raisins and chopped pecans. Also Added I teaspoon vanilla and 1 teaspoon cinnamon and only because I like raisins and nuts a lot on cookies and muffins and cinnamon and vanilla added a wonderful taste and my house smelled delicious!. Will do again with chocolate chips, but will cut the sugar also to 2 cups.
