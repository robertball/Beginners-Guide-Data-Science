Easy and simple.  I made the Tahini Salad Dressing using the recipe I found on allrecipes.com also.

I LOVED this recipe!! I made my own dressing using sesame seeds and sesame oil since tahini is not easily found in my part of the world, and I substituted slivered carrots for the tomatoes. It was a beautiful and delicious dish! I will definitely make this again!

This was a huge hit - a colorful change of pace from the usual salads!  Added a bit of cumin.

When I first gave my husband a small bowl of this to check it out, his response was that there was only one problem:  the bowl I gave him was too small.  When I make this, I double or triple it - one small recipe of it is never enough.  I made the "Tasteful Tahini Salad Dressing" (recipe on this site) and it was perfect.  When I first tasted the dressing, I thought that it might overpower.  Nope.  Don't change a THING on this recipe before you try it the first time, then if you want to make changes, that's fine, but try it like this first.  It really is a good combination of flavors.

Wonderfully quick salad!! I had left-over red cabbage and was looking for something quick to make with it and with items I had in the refrigerator, to go with burgers and sweet potato fries. I did mix things up a little bit. I used a green onion, white and green parts. Instead of tahini salad dressing I used balsamic salad dressing. I would have loved feta cheese on this salad, but there was none on hand. 

P.S. my husband even liked it!!

This was good, but needed something more, Next time I will add cumin as another reviewer suggested and possibly cilantro.

A good recipe.  I also used the recipe for tahini dressing found on allrecipes.  I used a generous amount of cracked pepper to the salad.  A nice recipe to add color to my diet!

Awesome salad! I tripled the recipe  except the chickpeas (2 cans) and added all of the tahini dressing I made  from this site. It turned out great!

I made my own tahini dressing rather than buying pre-made.  This was delicious.

We loved this salad! It’s a refreshing change from a coleslaw. I used “Tahini Dressing” from AR, which has yogurt in it. This was a meal in itself. It’s perfect: beautiful presentation, wonderful texture, and scrumptious taste. Two enthusiastic thumbs up. Thank you for the recipe.

So good. Even though I had a lot of onion. I made the tahini dressing as well but added natural peanut butter and some palm sugar. So good. And vegan too!
