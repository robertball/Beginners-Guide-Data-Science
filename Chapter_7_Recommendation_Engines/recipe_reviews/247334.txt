They came out great! Only thing I would change next time would be to use bananas that are REALLY ripe to get a little more sweetness. Other than that these cupcakes are awesome!

Loved the texture. Great gluten free cupcake. I did add a mocha frosting because I was looking for a little more flavor complexity. Thumbs up!

This was so good but I added a sugar free jello pudding of white chocolate because I was afraid of it being to dry It turned out delicious recipe I will keep
