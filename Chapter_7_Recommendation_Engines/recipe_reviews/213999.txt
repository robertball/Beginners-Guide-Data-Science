I was curious about the lemonade/soup mix, and it was very nice! However, I did insert little chips of the garlic into the meat with a knife tip, and added some oregano and diced onion to the seasoning. I used a large can of the concentrate.      I decided to marinate the roast in a large bag, turned it a few times, and refrigerated it overnight.  When ready to cook, I dumped the contents of the bag over the roast before putting it into the oven.       When it was done, I scooped out some of the liquid, stirred it in a pan with a bunch of ice cubes, til' the fat congealed, skimmed the fat, and used the result as a wonderful sauce - no need to thicken.      Served on a platter rimmed with spinach garnished with a few slices of clementine orange, blueberries, & fresh mint - Easter dinner guests raved!

Thought this recipe came out very tasty indeed. The lemonade helps to create a crusty-goodness of sugar on the lamb. Will definitely do this again!

I loved the flavour of this recipe but 90 minutes cooking didn't get it to medium-well like I wanted at 145 degrees on my thermometer.  If you want medium-well, plan for at least another half hour and maybe more.  But the seasoning rocked!!

After inserting the garlic chips into the meat.  Changed the rub a little.  After rubbing with margarine, added salt and pepper (less salt and more pepper) and oregano seasoning and rubbed into the meat.  Had a rosemary (essential) oil and added a few drops to the meat.  It came out tasting wonderful especially with the lemonade concentrate.  Next time will try to added garlic chips and rosemary springs into the meat and see what the result will be.

***2015-December 24 UPDATE***
Made it again.  This time did not have any oregano and made it with Ms. Dash Lemon Pepper, minced garlic, dried rosemary and rosemary (essential) oil but forgot to rub it with butter at the start.  Hence, melted the butter and added it before roasting the leg.  Again, it turned out beautifully.  This recipe is easy to make some slight changes but with wonderful results.  If you use this recipe, you will definitely NOT need the mint jelly to go with this lamb.

I bought a boneless leg of lamb that was on sale, and I was looking for an easy yet delicious way to prepare it. This recipe hit it on the head. I did end up cooking it for an extra half hour than it called for, and it was still medium rare and juicy.  I also caramelized some diced onions and poured them over the top of it, and added fingerling pototoes and carrots to the pan.  It was really good!

Can't give this enough stars!  The whole family loved it.  The lemonade/soup mix made the most incredible gravy.  We dumped it over potatoes, carrots and biscuits (oh and the fabulous lamb too!)  Even though dinner is over, we keep running into the kitchen to dunk another biscuit in the gravy.  Mmmmmmm.......!

I was really intrigued by the combination of lemonade concentrate and dry onion soup mix and decided to try this recipe along with the Easter Leg of Lamb for overnight marination (from allrecipes as well). The lamb turned out really tender, but I'm not sure if I really like the dressing.  To me there was something missing.  I personally prefer the Holiday Leg of Lamb recipe (allrecipes), but my boyfriend prefers this because of the lemony flavour.

This was a super easy recipe. I added fingerling potatoes, carrots, onions and baby bella mushrooms to the pan too. It took 2 hours and 15 minutes to reach temperature but was wonderful. Next time I will add extra lemonade and onion soup.

Very nice, altered it somewhat though, used some shallots on top with rosemary pepper and garlic. The only down side, in my opinion, is that not enough flavor penetrated into the roast. But for sure between a 4-5

Was so disappointed. The meat tasted off and I felt like this was a big waste of an expensive piece of meat. I have read other recipes that use real lemons but I did use the concentrate to save time. Big mistake. It was worse because my Mother's Day dinner was ruined and we had to go get hamburgers. I should have tried a different recipe.

I'm dying to try this recipe, but would like to do so using my crock pot.  Is anyone confident enough to convert the recipe?

Thank you in advance!
