Well, they did jump in the pan...but they weren't very crunchy at all (actually, they had the consistency of a raw chick pea - and I cooked them much longer than it said). 
I might have been expecting too much - I think the term 'snack' led me to believe that they would be something you could make and then take for lunches or snacks...it's really an eat-it-hot sort of dish.
It was okay for what it was - my boyfriend really liked them - but I think those chick peas would have been better used in hummus.

This was good!  Cooked for about 20 minutes to get them all crunchy.  Used other seasonings and a bit more oil.

the traditional way to make this is to deep fry well soaked but *not* cooked garbanzos.

I agree with the previous review. However, I took the beans and used them to make hummus out of - it's pretty good! 1/3 cup tahini, 1/4 cup lemon juice, 1 teaspoon salt (although I would use a bit less, or none at all, the lemon pepper and creole seasoning adds enough salt), 2 gloves garlic (although, I might use less than this too). I also had to add some water, I think the cooked beans were harder to blend.

My chickpeas never actually jump (man was I disappointed the first time!), but the end result is always very tasty.  I make this as a snack to take to work and it keeps well for a few days afterwards.  My only suggestion to other is to coat the beans with olive oil prior to adding to the pan.  It seems to help crunch them up a bit more.
