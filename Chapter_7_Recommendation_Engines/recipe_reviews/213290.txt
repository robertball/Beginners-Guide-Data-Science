This is one of those recipes that's only as good as your ingredients. It's a good recipe with a little help. I did want to stretch this a bit (my boys can EAT) so I added one can of organic refried beans and one cup of homemade salsa (instead of using Pace) and one 8 oz. can of tomato sauce. I gave it a little taste and thought it needed a little spice so I added one batch of Bill Echols taco seasoning, which is also from this site. I think if you're broke and you only have pantry items to work with, this is your recipe. It's for certain a boy pleaser. My husband and I remarked that how I made it with my additions, this would make a great taco dip.

Not so good; the soup is a poor addition
