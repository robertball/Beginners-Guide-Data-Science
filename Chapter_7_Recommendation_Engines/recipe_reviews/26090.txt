Messy, but good!  I topped my wraps with some fresh avacado.

Totally delicious.  I added the shredded chicken to the bean mixture and let it simmer all together.  I also added some spanish rice to the wrap, along with some fresh avocado slices.  My husband went nuts.  Make this!  You will love it.

I hate shredding chicken, so I cut some chicken breast into strips, seasoned it with cumin, cayenne pepper, salt and black pepper. I cooked that in a skillet and added the ingredients to it as directed.  I've made this a few times with various flavors of wraps and salsas.  It's become my favorite lunch for when I have some time to cook.  Thanks!

Grill out the chicken first.  Then the chicken is already for this wrap.  Put the
chicken into the microwave for about 11 secs to warm it up before shredding
it for the wrap.

We liked these, but found them a little bland even though I used hot salsa.  We added a little hot sauce just to spice it up a bit.  Great recipe, especially if you have leftover chicken!

Really easy to make and not at all time consuming.  Kids love the fact that they can help make the stuffing as well as choosing what they want to stuff into each one.

Overall, a decent dish.  Not overly impressed and pretty boring.

Mmmmm!  These were tasty and nutritious!  My kids don't like them much, as they don't like beans.  Leftovers were good the next day too.

I loved it!  I added some onions to the mix, but everything else remained the same.  It was very tasty and easy to make.

My husband and I loved this recipe.  We prepared it together.  Served with additional salsa and sour cream.  Yummy.
