My husband and I LOVE chicken wings so I knew this was going to be good! Plus it was quick and easy to put together - not to mention a bit healthier than fried chicken wings! I cut back on the number of servings and used some leftover grilled chicken that I tossed in some Frank's Red Hot, a little melted butter and a mix of seasonings for our homemade hot wing sauce. I also used "No-Mayonnaise Ranch Dressing" from this site vs. bottled ranch dressing. I added some lettuce and shredded cheddar cheese along with the tomatoes. My husband and I loved the addition of the bacon in the wrap!

These were a HUGE HIT! I did do it a little differently though, but nothing major. I used less chicken (because I was making less wraps), which I pre-cooked and shredded into the sauce that I doubled (I melted the butter in a pan and added Frank's Red Hot (instead of the wing sauce) and some garlic powder). Along with the tomatoes, bacon and ranch, I also added lettuce, onions and cheese...SO GOOD! These will definately be made A LOT in our house! Thanks for sharing. :)

We had half of a ginormous package of boneless pre-fried wings in the freeze that we have to use before our big move and this was a great recipe to use some of them in. I had some crisp bacon leftover from breakfast that I used in this recipe which saved me a step. I used the basic Buffalo Wing sauce from the Frank's Hot Sauce website, whole wheat tortillas and my own homemade low-calorie ranch dressing. I did add in shredded lettuce as well. HUGE hit with my husband. He ate four and the one of mine I didn't finish, he ate as well. Thanks for sharing this recipe--I can say for sure that I will be making these a lot for him.

I'm the one who submitted this recipe, 2 years ago. And nope it's not healthy at all. But that being said there are a few things you can do to make it a little less fat and cholesterol filled. Here is what I've changed since submitting this recipe. First I cook the bacon in the oven, drain in paper towels and then crumble. (How much is up to you.) Then I cook the chicken pieces in a little olive oil and add the sauce (as much or little as you would prefer, it's up to you). As for the dressing you can either use blue cheese or ranch or skip it all together if you'd like. I make homemade ranch because that's what my family likes and I know what ingredients are going in it. Bottled blue cheese always tastes metalic to me and I haven't tried making homemade blue cheese dressing yet. Besides, my family isn't crazy about blue cheese dressing although I do like it myself, but not the bottled stuff. 
So, there are many ways to make these wraps to your liking by adding, subtracting or changing whatever you wish. Is it healthy? No, but that's why we don't eat it every week.
By the way thanks for your comment Belveal and I am happy to see most everyone is enjoying this dish as much as we do.

Delicious!  I made a few changes.  The quantities seemed off...3 lbs of chicken is a lot of chicken for only 1/4 cup buffalo sauce.  I used about 1 1/2 pounds of chicken, 5 slices of precooked bacon, and just sauted the chicken in some oil, adding chopped onion and garlic.  I then proceeded as instructed, adding the melted butter, buffalo sauce and wrapping it in the tortilla with lettuce, tomato shredded cheese and ranch dressing.  We all loved it.  Thanks!

Everyone loved these last night!  Pre-cooked chicken with salt, pepper, and garlic powder, then shredded before adding to sauce and butter.  Added a few dashes of cayenne pepper sauce and served with spicy ranch dressing and cheddar cheese.  Cold pasta salad on the side was a nice compliment to the spiciness of the wrap.

These are the best wraps ever!  Anyone who loves buffalo sauce has to try this.  I kept the recipe basically the same.  I added avocado, fresh cilantro, and used corn tortillas instead of flour(they taste so much better).  I also changed the ranch dressing to Blue Cheese dressing.  Buffalo wings just are not the same with out blue cheese dressing.  Best ever! Ill be making these again soon. Thanks for the post.

Very tasty, even my 8-year-old loved it.  I added lettuce to bump up the veggies a little, but otherwise made it just like the recipe.

My second time making these, love 'em! Using pre-cooked chicken cuts the prep/cook time significantly, and since you're coating it in bacon drippings and butter anyway... Point: easy recipe, yummy dish!

This recipe has become a favorite of mine since finding it a few months ago. Sometimes I switch out the ranch for blue cheese, but other than that I pretty much stick to the exact recipe. These are so easy and quick and the whole family loves them!

Everytime I make this, it never fails to please.  My son can't wait to get home for supper and he always wants more than I make.  Wouldn't change a thing, perfect ingredients, esp. the bacon.  A definate crowd pleaser and a change from the chicken wing craze!  Thanks, had it with a ceasar salad... perfection!!

When I was pregnant I craved anything with buffalo sauce on it. You can go to BWW and buy this same wrap for a few bucks, or can spend the same amount on all ingredients and make a few at home! My poor husband was up making these for me at all times of the day and night, but I just love them.

The chicken cooking in the bacon grease really gave it a good flavor.  I didn't think the recipe called for enough sauce to coat the chicken (at least to our liking).  However, as written, it is a yummy recipe!

I really enjoyed the buffalo and bacon combo. Also, the tomatoes went great with the buffalo flavor as well. Nice mix. The ranch and buffalo didn't seem to mix too well though. I think this would be much better as a burrito where everything can sit and not fall out. This would allow all of the various flavors to mesh better. I'll try that next time.

I love anything with buffalo sauce and these are great! The bacon was a nice touch, and I used blue cheese dressing instead of ranch. I will be making again!

These are a HUGE hit in our house.  We always add lots of extra Franks Hot sauce and also shredded lettuce.  Cooking the chicken in the bacon drippings makes this dish.  One night I only had microwave bacon on hand and just cooked it and tossed it in to the wraps. It was not the same as cooking the chicken in the bacon drippings.  I will never make that mistake again.  Thanks for the recipe!

Very delicious! I used bigger wraps instead of flour tortillas for mine. It was so delicious, much better than the ones at restaurants. This recipe is definitely a keeper.

MMM so good! We used blue cheese dressing instead of the ranch!

LOVED these!  I cooked plain chicken breasts in the crockpot so when I got home from work - dinner was a breeze!  (and I didn't have the added fat from cooking it in the bacon grease).Great tasting easy meal idea!  Thanks for the recipe, figgy!

my husband and i really enjoyed this. Very versatile, and filling. The only thing I did different was I "breaded" my chicken strips and fried them before coating them in the buffalo sauce. Yummy with ranch dressing.

This recipe was delish!  We decided that this is going to be a regular dish on our weekly menu.  I cooked according to directions, but then I added a few things.  In a large bowl I added some mixed salad greens, the cheddar cheese, sliced red onions, and then the Ranch dressing.  This made something similar to a cole slaw.  I put that on the tortilla before I started spooning in the chicken mixture.  Overall, this was great!!

These were excellent! I made the recipe in half, but we'll have these again! The 'wing sauce' by Franks is surprisingly not very hot. The only modification was that we used whole wheat tortillas but that's a minor change - everyone really liked these! Oh - I added toppings as well, a little sharp cheddar and diced onion YUM :)

Fast, fresh and delicious!  I sauteed some onions and garlic and took my already cooked chicken (leftovers that had been in the freezer) and stuck in the same pan to warm it up.  I used a little more buffalo sauce than called for in the recipe.  I used green spinach and herb tortillas.  The combination of tomatoes, shredded lettuce, shredded cheddar cheese and ranch really worked well with the meat mixture!  Next time I will be adding chopped avocado.  They looked beautiful and tasted WONDERFUL!

I decided to make these for lunch today. Makes quite a bit of food so I sent the left overs with my cousin so her and her friends could eat them up. Quick and easy to throw together. Semi-healthy (not fried.) I followed the recipe as is and didn't make any adjustments. It was very good. Keeping the 2 tablespoons of bacon drippings is what makes this recipe. Someone said it was a little overpowering but I have to disagree. I loved it. Who doesn't love bacon? Overall, a great recipe.

My fiance and his cousins, that visits all the time, love when I cook this and have started requesting it on a biweekly basis! I don't use the butter and I add cheddar cheese. I don't like fresh tomatoes, so I add a can of seasoned diced tomatoes, and it is amazing. My fiance and his cousin told me that they decided to try it with chicken flavored ramen noodles, once the tortillas ran out, and they said they were literally fighting over the last little bit. Ive never tried it like that, but they think it's amazing like that!

Loved it!  I marinated the chicken breasts in KC Masterpieces buffalo marinade for about 1-1/2 hours, then made it a little healthier by cooking the chicken breasts in canola oil and adding a little of crispy cooked bacon (4 slices cut up and cooked up) over it in the tortilla with lettuce, ranch dressing and grape tomatoes.  Nummy! Great Super Bowl meal!

I only made a couple of chicken tenders and shredded them instead of cutting them into pieces. I think I added too much sauce though and next time I would use less. I also topped it with a little bit of cheddar and next time I might use blue cheese instead.

These are really good... the only thing I changes is that I used can shredded chicken instead of chicken breast to save on time, and it made these even easier :-) yummy!

This was a big hit at our house.  Some added cheese to it, which I thought was good.  Either way, was pretty simple to make and everyone like.

awesome!!!!  All of my kids loved it.  I took suggestions from others and added 4oz of monteray jack and 4oz of charp cheddar. Doubled the wing sauce (used texas pete wing sauce) and doubled the ranch and only 1.5 lb of chicken which I boiled then shredded.  Also used a whole 12oz of bacon.  If you want it spicier then don't add as much ranch.  But a real keepr this one is!

Other than changing the sauce to Ghost Pepper Wing Sauce, I didn't make any changes. Served carrot sticks and celery on the side. AWESOME!

So good! I cooked up about 1 lb of chicken tenders with salt and pepper and once cooled, chopped them into cubes and melted 4 tbsp butter with 2 tbsp Louisiana hot sauce. Eating the chicken straight up, it was spicy, but once in the wrap, the spice disappeared, so next time, I will add another 1-2 tbsp of hot sauce. I added lettuce and a little shredded cheddar to the wraps, and served them with blue cheese coleslaw on the side. Delicious! Thanks for the yummy recipe.

My hubby really like these, I know I will be making them again. I did have to use more butter, but I used a lower fat version so I was not worry about the calories. Next time I think I am going to add some romaine lettuce and avocado to this dish. Great and fast recipe.

Thanks Figgy, this recipe was "Awsome". I made it the original way for my husband, and a low fat version for me. I just used turkey bacon, light butter and light dressing. Both were great! And I can not agree more....please dont rate on how healthy it is or isn't, or if you have not tried it.  That really annoys me!!!!

I made these wraps and, they were a hit. the next time, I would cut the chicken in strips (personal preference). As my husband bit in to the wrap, he immediately said, "mmm - good." I did double the sauce recipe, we enjoy our food with extra sauce. Will definately make this recipe again. A keeper!

Ohhh My Goshhhh!!!! These were very tasty! I cut the recipe in half and we topped ours with lettuce and a dab of shredded cheese but this will definitely be a regular at my house. I happened to be tired and didn't want to make a large meal so I tossed these together...what a hit. (Not only for myself but my kids 10, 21 & 23) I will agree...a little salty but I think that just comes with the Franks hot sauce, too bad they don't make a reduced sodium.

I may also try this as a shrimp wrap---sounds yummy!

I wanted to make this but I knew the amount of wing sauce would be too much for my boyfriend's sensitive stomach so I started with half of the suggested amount of wing sauce and added a healthy dollop of low fat sour cream.  From there I fine tuned it to get it exactly how I wanted it.  It was delicious, and not too overwhelming!  I could have used cream cheese or even mayo, but I had sour cream in the fridge so that's what I used.  We will definitely be making these again.

This recipe was so easy to whip together! It was good. I went a little light on the buffalo sauce and let my husband add more to his at the end. If you want quick and easy , this is the recipe for you!

The chicken was really dry. I don't know if I did something wrong, but I don't think I'll make this again. I used less bacon as well, but I doubt that changed anything.

I did not follow this exactly. I omitted the bacon, dredged chicken in flour/salt/pepper and browned in olive oil. Melted the butter, added about 1/2 C. chopped celery, added Frank's hot sauce and about 2T ketchup till heated.  Coated chicken with sauce.  On tortilla, in this order about 2T mixture of shredded cheddar/monterey cheese, chicken mixture, halfed cherry tomatoes, about 1T. light ranch and some romaine lettuce.  These were amazingly tasty. Thanks for this recipe.  I just wanted to lighten it up a bit.

Way too much bacon.  Blue Cheese dressing & no bacon would taste better to me.  Needs improvement by decreasing the bacon if nothing else if you prefer this type of Buffalo Chicken wrap with the Ranch dressing.

We made these last night for supper, and they were awesome; We didn't change a thing. The side dish we used was "Best Spanish Rice", also from this site. Truly an awesome recipe, we highly recommend;-)
