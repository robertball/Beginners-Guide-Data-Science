I added sage, thyme & basil and it gave it wonderful flavor.  It was a little dry, although I only used 1 3/4 cans of broth.  We ended up using a can of cream of chicken soup as gravy & it tasted wonderful with it. DH thought it was good, so overall, it's a good recipe (with the herb additions) & I'll make it again.

I would rather be able to cook the chicken with the stuffing as opposed to already having it cooked.
Also, too much butter and I don't see the point of the eggs. 
Also, mine turned out WAY too mushy. I'd cut the broth to the stuffing directions.
