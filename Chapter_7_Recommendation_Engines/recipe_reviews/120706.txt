Very good and sooooo easy.  I used a spice cake mix rather than white, and thought it complemented the pear flavor nicely.  I also coated the bundt pan with cinnamon sugar rather than frosting or glazing it.  I used no-sugar-added canned pears and thought it was plenty sweet.  Will definitely make this again!

I followed the advice of two other reviewers.  I used a large can on pears in lite syrup. First I chopped up half of the pears (4 halves) and added enough syrup to equal 15 oz.  I made the cake batter exactly as written except that I then chopped the remaining drained, pear halves and put them in the bottom of a well greased bundt pan.  I sprinkled light brown sugar and freshly grated nutmeg on top of the chopped pears.  I poured half of the batter on top of the chopped pears and then spooned on a streusel filling consisting of 1/2 cup white sugar, 2 tsp. cinnamon, and 1 cup of chopped pecans.  I poured the rest of the batter on top of the streusel filling.  I checked the cake after 45 minutes in the oven and it tested done so you might want to check your cake after 45 minutes to prevent over baking.  When tasting this cake I took a bite of the plain pear cake without any of the additions and although it was tasty, I could not taste any pear flavor.  Additional bites with the chopped pear and streusel filling were much more appealing to my taste buds since I was looking for an easy recipe with pear flavor.  I would make this cake again with or without the additions.

I found this recipe when searching for an alternative to the Golden Rum Cake on this site because I didn't have a vanilla pudding mix.  I'm so glad I DID, what a great recipe!  My husband and sons loved it! I made the recipe "as is" with the exeception of using a 29 oz can of pears in heavy syrup (what I had on hand).  I used 15 oz of the pears and juice in the cake mix as directed.  The other half of the pears I chopped and put in the bottom of the bundt pan that was sprayed with butter flavored cooking spray (I skipped dusting it with flour).  I sprinkled the chopped pears in the bottom of the bundt pan with brown sugar and then poured on the cake batter and baked as directed.  IT TURNED OUT BEAUTIFUL AND DELICIOUS!! Thanks so much for this recipe!!

This is my new favorite cake. I'm crazy about pears and I love the lightness of this cake and the fact thats its not as fatty and full of calories as many cakes. I agree with the comparison to angel food cake but its lighter and more subtle than angel food in my opinion. What I really like to do when I make this cake is peal and slice a ripe fresh Bartlett pear and lay the slices on the bottom of the bundt pan. Ive made this cake in bundt and just a regular 9 x 13 and both ways have their virtues but I prefer the bundt method. Everyone who I have fed this too raves about it, even those who don't have much of a sweet tooth.

I used a yellow cake mix and cinnamon-sugar mixture to dust the pan instead of flour.  And it was awesome!!  I will definitely make this again, all kids and hubby liked it!!

I tried this with yellow cake mix and canned peaches (just happened to be what I had on hand) and it came out pretty decent. I've also made variants of that with nutmeg/cinnamon/cloves/allspice/ginger to make a peach spice cake. You just can't beat this recipe for how simple it is to make.  Note for those making it the first time--at least for the company that made my boxed cake mix, they gave a different (shorter) time for how long to keep a bundt pan in the oven. Ignore what the box says. Also, the toothpick method is a bit hazy to work with on this guy, since the bits of fruit can stick to the toothpick and make it look like the cake isn't done when it really is. Go by the time the recipe states; it'll work perfectly!

This was a really easy recipe that is much lower in fat than a traditional bundt cake. I found that the pears distributed throughout the cake made it gritty, and a texture I didn't care for, but since the recipe is so good, I don't feel it's right to mark it down for a personal preference. Also, I used a reduced sugar cake mix with perfect results. I will make this cake again using peaches, it should be fabulous. Thanks for this great recipe.

This cake is delicious! It's just about the fluffiest cake I've ever eaten, even the batter was like frosting.  You wouldn't guess that it's reasonably good for you!  It's the first cake I've mixed up in my new KitchenAid mixer, and I'm sure that's why it's so nice and fluffy.  Mixing by hand would still be yummy, but nowhere near as fluffy.  The flavor is also great, but didn't have a very strong pear flavor to us- my boyfriend actually thought it was peaches!  The only canned pears the store had were the no sugar added ones though, so maybe next time when I make it with the light syrup pears it will taste more like pears.  Also, next time I think I'm going to put half the batter in the pan, sprinkle 1/4 cup brown sugar mixed with cinnamon on top, then top with the remaining batter.  It tastes great as is, but we're fools for cinnamon sugar and I think the cake would be even more enjoyable that way.  Thanks for the great recipe, I wouldn't have thought of this myself!

i was honestly very disappointed with this recipe.. however, i substituted the cake mix for 2 cups of flour, 1 1/2 cup sugar, and 1 tbsp of baking powder. maybe it was that substitute that made this cake gummy and a little too sweet. i dont think ill keep this recipe.:(

Made this for a light Christmas Eve dessert as directed.   Pear flavor was very subtle, but cake was very moist.  Wrapped leftovers and put in refrigerator - few days later the pear taste was more evident, but still subtle and cake was still very moist.   If you are looking for distinct pear taste - add more pears or fold in at the very end.  Still a very good cake.

Very simple, very easy, and I loved it! It was fluffy and although I couldn't taste the pear whatsoever, it was delicious and I will be making it again! I did use yellow cake mix though because that's all I had.

I thought it was a wonderful light cake and didn't think the pear flavor was too strong.

This is a wonderful cake and so easy to make.  No, I didn't really taste the pears, but I didn't care.  My family said it tasted a lot like angel food cake and I agree though it's denser and more moist.  I will definitely make this again.  It would be great in the summer with fresh fruit and whipped cream.  Definitely a keeper.

The cake has a strong pear flavour which I liked. The kids were anxious to try the cake so it did not get a chance to cool. Served with ice cream, it is delicious.

The pear flavor is very subtle in this and the cake is very delicate. It's not very dense, which I normally associate with bundt cakes.  I used a chocolate glaze on top.

I am one of those cooks who may drive you a little crazy, I mostly tend to change a recipe.  For no reason only to suit my own personal tastes.  I have been baking for a long time and love to come up with new favorites.  I saw this recipe and thought it sounded delightful, but I wanted my own twist.  So I decide to make two different chocolate versions!!
For the first cake, I used a Betty Crocker Dark chocolate cake mix, I did add 2 teaspoons of Penzeys Spices Rich Dutch Cocoa and 1 cup of chocolate chips, 15 oz pears in juice, used 3 egglands best eggs (not just the egg whites) and 1/2 cup applesauce, to make it extra moist.  2nd Cake ~ I made using a white Betty Crocker cake mix, added the 3 eggs, 1 cup of WHITE chocolate chips, 15 oz pears in juice, used 3 egglands best eggs (not just the egg whites) and again the 1/2 cup applesauce.

Prepared exactly as written except used a chocolate glaze instead of powdered sugar.  Also, prepared pan with Pam and then coated with Penzey's vanilla sugar.  Great cake but no pear taste at all.  Will try peaches and some spice next time.  Next time was today.  Used yellow cake mix with 2 whole eggs, 15 oz. canned peaches and some Penzey's baking spice.  Excellent.  More of a peach flavor.  Pan was prepared with Pam and vanilla sugar as before.  Definitely a keeper recipe.

One of my Go To recipes now.  Simple & wonderful every time.  Whether I use a white or yellow cake mix, it reminds me of an angel food cake every time.  No need for any icing or frosting which makes it great for summer picnics & totes well to church dinners or office meals.  Thanks for sharing.  Goodness knows I've shared it with many as well.

Nothing but great feedback on this recipe.  Changes: used lemon cake mix, pinch of brown sugar and cinnamon.  Exceedingly simple to make and the pears in light syrup makes it fluffy and yummy!
