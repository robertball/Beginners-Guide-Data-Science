This is a good sweet potato fries recipe, but I would make a few adjustments: bake in a glass cake pan - they don't stick quite so much and clean up is a lot easier. I toss mine with just enough oil to coat and whatever seasonings I want (salt, pepper, and garlic, and sometimes some rosemary). Also, I bake mine at 400 degrees for 20 minutes, turning halfway through. You can always bake them for longer if they are not quite done, but can't go back in time if you cook them too long!

These turned out great!  I see a lot of people saying they weren't crispy enough. If you soak them in cold water for about 45 minutes before baking they will crisp up nicely.

I make these often. I cut them so that they're circular. I use olive oil and bit of salt - no garlic. If you need them done quick, broil them, flipping half-way through - only takes a couple minutes to cook them this way!

This is a popular recipe in my house, always make it for holiday table. I do not use sea salt - comes out too salty; I use the same amount of kosher salt. I also add a pinch of chili pepper to the spice mix. After consulting with my friends used to Southern cuisine, I now add a pinch of nutmeg and ground cloves to the spice mix, to enhance the flavor

This turn awesome and little bit healthier than fried potatoes. I did some changes adding parsley to the mix, and olive oil instead of soybean oil. I put the potatoes on the sprayed pan and some extra olive oil over that (less than 1 teaspoon), baked the first side for 30 min. and turn over the sweet potatoes and drops of olive oil, left them baked for other 15 min. and they were just amazing! Crispy outside and tender inside.

It was alright, but not very different than regular oven roasted sweet potato. I would like to find a way to make them more crispy on the outside.

These were delicious even though I forgot the garlic powder and used olive oil.  I didn't measure anything, basically just sprinkled and tossed everything right in the glass pan used to bake them in.

Excellent recipe!  I cook for 20 minutes, flipping halfway through.  The flavors are easy to change- I often just do salt, cayenne, and cumin.  A staple!  Just a tip, I always bake mine on parchment paper.  Easy cleanup and crispy fries.  :-)

These sweet potato fries (baked) are so tasty. Everyone in my family loved them and asked  me to make them again. They are crunchy and the sea salt is the tasty saltiness to the sweetness of the potatoes. This is a keeper! I do want to add that I did have to bake them longer for them to become crunchy.

Oven Baked Sweet Potato Fries Haiku: "Baked a bit longer, was hoping they'd 'crispify', but oh man great taste!" Not sure if there's a trick to getting sweet potatoes to get crispier when baked, but texture aside, the taste of these was fantastic. I see one review saying to cook a bit shorter, but I ended up baking mine longer and flipping them more frequently. Always happy to find a sweet potato recipe that's not bathed in sweet ingredients!

Didn't bother with the garlic but they turned out great, check the other users photos as they give good indication of cutting size of the sweet potato.
Mine came out crispy enough, I opened the cooker to check if they were good, turned off the oven and left them in their for about 5-10mins whilst I was finishing the main, maybe this contributed to the crispiness
Very good

I added everything of the listed ingredients. I put them in the oven for 13 minutes, then I flipped them over to put for an additional 13 minutes. When I took them out, they look golden and delicious! I tried one and the ends and sides are crispy and the middle body is soft. I would highly recommend this recipe!

I made mine thinner and half of them came out a bit burnt.  Next time I will lower the oven temp a bit and check on them more often. They were tasty though - I used a bit of corn starch to add crispiness.

Really tasty!  I followed the recipe very closely, but I added some cayenne for a little kick.  My thick wedges went toward the longer end of the cooking time, and I kicked in the convection for the last 5 minutes.  I think if I had used convection all the way through, they might have crisped up a bit more.  Thanks for the recipe!  My son ate these, and he usually doesn't eat sweet potatoes without marshmallows.

I cut the strips quite thin. I used olive oil, a little orange flavored olive oil, and a bit of citrus habanero, and the rest the regular olive oil. Spices were what I had in the cupboard. So tasty. They were crispy. I through in a regular potato, too. Very good.

I  cooked these fries on a baking  sheet with parchment paper; easy clean up. Next, I used canola oil as I don't have soy. I tossed with course salt and Red Bell Pepper Chicken Seasoning. Basically, any seasoning that appeals to you will do.

I make this often. Sometimes with and sometimes without the garlic powder. Good recipe. I go pretty light on the salt when I make mine. I find this recipe calls for a bit too much salt for my taste.

I used olive oil and added rosemary but otherwise stuck to the recipe, and we loved it.  Maybe not as crisp as I would like, but if I'd been patient and broiled them for a few minutes that would have solved the problem.  But we couldn't wait to eat, and these fries were very tasty!  Thanks for a great recipe!

Really enjoyed this recipe. The consistency was perfect -- not too soft.

I used coconut oil, the only oil I had on hand. Keeping an eye on them, I left the fries in a little longer for extra crispiness. Very tasty!

These are good. I was hoping to get them crunchy but maybe have to cut thinner.

I loved the flavor of the potatoes, and used olive oil, salt, black pepper and garlic powder.

I also soaked them for the 45 minutes recommended by another viewer, and it really didn't seem to make any difference.  They still turned out rather soft.

To make them a little bit more crisp, I put them under the broiler (on low) for a few minutes.

These were really tasty. I would cut the oil down a bit next time. I also broiled them on high at the end of the cook time to crisp them up a bit.

I've made these twice now and they are very good. I did follow some of the suggestions of reviewers, like putting them in cold water 45 minutes before baking to make them crispier and mine did come out crispy. I also added nutmeg and ground cloves to the spices as suggested by others and I must say they were definitely tasty! These will be a regular side dish with turkey burgers.

Recipe was awesome as written.  I made them in my air fryer.  It would not go up to 425 degrees, so I set it for the highest temp(400) and baked for 25 mins.  They came out perfect.   A big hit with the family!!!

I made this recipe recently for my family.  My older son loved it.  (  When I make sweet potato fries with oregano he doesn't like them.  )  
I added at least twice the olive oil suggested by the recipe.  
I didn't want it to be too strong tasting, and the oil needed to stretch to cover two large sweet potatoes.  I left out the pepper, and only put a few sprinkles of Himalayan pink sea salt, which I substituted for regular sea salt. 
 
After coating everything in oil, garlic powder, and paprika, by hand, I spread it out on a foil lined oven pan.  I then sprinkled a little more garlic and paprika over it, and baked for twenty minutes.  

The kids and I love sweet potatoes, so we ate them all.  

Thank you for a recipe with paprika, instead of oregano.  This will be my new recipe for sweet potato fries.

I didn't measure my amount of oil, and I used my Copper Chef crisping mesh instead of a baking sheet.   I used too much oil but these still tasted great!  I believe they would have crisped more if I hadn't used so much oil.  Plus, if I have time next time, I will put them in cold water before roasting as one of the reviews suggested.  Thank you!

I tossed them in extra virgin olive oil & tossed them in the seasoning mixture in a Ziploc bag. I sprayed my baking sheet with baking spray. It works better to insure they do not stick. I also baked them at 375 

Very good

The seasoning was perfect! I enjoyed the fries, but didnt quite get the crispiness I was looking for. I'm not sure if that was because it was baked vs. Fried, or what, but I may tweak the recipe a bit by adding butter or more oil next time. Otherwise, it was still super tasty!

The outside of the fries wasn’t super crispy but they were delicious and toddler approved so I’m happy. Might try soaking in cold water before cooking next time to see if that helps but will definitely make again either way.

This recipe was good except my fries were a bit soggy.   I didn’t use enough sweet potatoes,  I will try it again using more potatoes.  They still tasted very good and my family still enjoyed them.

I made these sweet potato fries.  I soaked them in cold water for an hour and a half. Then tossed with the oil and spices. Spread them on a baking sheet at 445 for 15 minutes and they were soft. I turned them and left them in another 10. Still soft but they were tasty. I have already researched how to get them crispy. I will make those and post them.

My first time making  sweet potatoes and it was a success. Easy, fast, delicious. Crunchy on the outside, sweet on the inside. Don't forget to turn fries at least once to get crust. Will make again.

Turned out great! I used parchment paper to line the baking sheets and flipped the fries over after 10 minutes. Sprinkled with seasoning salt after they were done. My family loves them and I feel better making these fries because they’re healthy.

Soaked them for about an hour before baking, the texture was great considering they were oven baked. I also added some crushed steak spice in the seasoning mix. Husband, child and guests loved them! Served with Spicy mayo, makes for a great crowd pleaser!

Very nice recipe and flavoring, only down fall is I want them less mushy, to have a lovely crunch. I will make it again using this as a basis for something I’ll tweak

Subbed EVOO - used seasoned salt - broiled the last 7 min to get extra crispy. Yummy dipped in ketchup. My 4 yr old loved them.

I tossed these in the oven while my burgers were grilling and served it with the Spicy Fry Sauce found on Allrecipes. We love a good sweet potato fry and this one didn't dissapoint. It had a touch of spiciness to it and that was okay with us!

Good flavor for sweet potato fries, but the time to get these crisp takes far longer. I cut the sweet potatoes thin instead of in wedges, but at 25 min. they were still soft and I kept them in the oven for another 10-15 minutes. Then, I turned off the oven and left them in there, carefully checking every 5-7 minutes while finishing other dishes. After roughly 15 minutes more, some of the fries burned, but the others had the perfect texture. Will try the recipe again and soak the potatoes in water first as other reviewers recommended. Thanks for the recipe.

We love these! I have cut the taters in steak fries and 1/4 inch chips. Both ways work well with adjusted cook times for tenderness. I always double or triple the amount of spices.

I really enjoyed these! I've made a similar recipe and decided not to measure, but I probably did add more paprika than called for. I omitted the garlic (just couldn't imagine garlic on sweet potatoes). Instead of sticks, I made hearts. After all, it was the month of love :)  Round slices would work just as well. I still cooked for about 20 minutes.

I used extra virgin coconut oil in place of the soybean (vegetable) oil to keep in line with my anti-inflammation meal planning, and these sweet potato fries were delicious!

This was my first attempt at making homemade sweet potato fries and I thought this recipe was pretty good for oven baked.  My family liked them.  I did make one adjustment.  I sprinkled just a touch of cinnamon sugar on them.

First time we made sweet potato fries at home and we loved them.  They will be one of our favorites to eat  and try different ingredients on them.

I followed the recipe using one sweet potato and one yam for color variety. My husband and I both enjoyed them, and will make the recipe again.

If I make this again I'll try to do something to make them crispier.  I liked them, but the kids didn't, and DH is not a big fan of any sweet potato fries...so maybe this was a 1 and done.

I baked on parchment paper.  I used safflower oil instead of soybean oil because I have a soy allergy.  We loved the way they turned out!

Really yummy as written, except that they were not crunchy.  I followed some others' advice and tried soaking the pieces in cold water before cooking.  I left the peels on, too, but the peels were the only crunchy part of the dish.  Still, husband said "keep that recipe" so I will.

these were very tasty.. the only thing i did differently was cooking them on the gas grill bc it's too warm to turn on the oven.. since the grill is still relatively new i'm not completely comfortable/knowledgeable with the temperature settings.. so i cooked this at medium heat.. it was done in about 40 min's.. bf said if we wanted to crisp up the exterior we could drop these in the deep fryer.. but that would defeat the purpose of this being "healthy".. ty for the recipe!
