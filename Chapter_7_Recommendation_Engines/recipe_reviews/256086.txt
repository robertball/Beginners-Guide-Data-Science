The dough was very easy to work with.  I was able to use 1 large jar of mincemeat and got 8 regular 'cupcake' size tarts, and 24 mini tarts with only a tad of the dough left over.  I am not good at handling pie dough made with a higher butter ratio.  Just out of personal preference, next time I'll just switch the amts. of crisco (used butter flavored) and the butter for a more tender crust.  The addition of the orange zest really made this a nice ever-so slightly sweet crust.  These are intended as a gift but I did have to sneak one to review.  Very, very nice recipe.
