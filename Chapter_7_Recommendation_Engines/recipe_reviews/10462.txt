I'VE MADE 4 PANS OF THESE IN JUST ONE WEEK.  FIRST PAN FOR HOME TRIAL USING JUST WHITE SUGAR.....VERY GOOD.  NEXT THREE PANS (ONE FOR A COOKOUT, ONE FOR A GRADUATION PARTY & ONE TO GO TO W/MY SON TO N.HAMPSHIRE FOR A NASCAR RACE) I USED 1/2 C. WHITE SUGAR & 1/2 C. LIGHT BROWN SUGAR FOR CRUST....EVEN BETTER.  ALSO ADDED 1 TSP. VANILLA EXTRACT TO BEATEN EGG.  I'LL BE MAKING THEM AGAIN THIS WEEK FOR MY BEST FRIEND'S BIRTHDAY. THEY DO TRAVEL EXTREMELY WELL. SINCE I LIVE IN NEW ENGLAND, I'VE TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF THE FRESH BLUEBERRIES THAT ARE AT THEIR PEAK.

Really yummy!  I used butter instead of shortening, and used frozen berries.  I cut the recipe in half too, and used part whole-wheat pastry flour.  I did the "dough" in my food processor, and it never really came together, it was just a powdery mixture.  I thought it wouldn't work, but went ahead with it anyways and it all came together during baking.  These turned out really well.  For those of you that said the dough part didn't have any real flavor, it's probably due to the shortening.  Shortening has no real flavor (plus it's yucky and bad for you).  Try butter, it's so much better!

I can't begin to say how great this recipe is! My sister told me it was good, so I decided to give it a try. Boy, was she right! It is crumbly, but I just added a little liquid (water mixed with lemon juice and vanilla for extra flavor) to the half of crumbs used for the base, and pre-cooked it for about 5 minutes.  The base was not nearly as crumbly as the top this way.  FYI, I used frozen berries for this, without defrosting first, and it baked up perfectly in the same amount of time.

ETA that I have only ever used butter with this recipe- I do not cook with shortening.  I also use at least half whole wheat flour. Healthier and tastier!

Made these bars several times,  most recently for a bridal shower and they were a big hit.  I made a few changes in the recipe. I used real butter instead of the shortening and it made a HUGE difference in the taste. Delicious! Since fresh blueberries are not in season now, I used frozen Maine blueberries (very big bag for under $5.00) that were purchased in the freezer section at Costco.) I didn't thaw them, just used them directly from the bag and the bars came out fantastic. I made these bars several times and found that you have to bake them a bit longer to get them lightly browned on top..I baked them for 55 minutes. Also, when topping with the remaining crumbs, make sure you squeeze the crumb mixture in your hands to form the crumbs before sprinkling on the top.

I followed the advice of other reviewers and used butter instead of shortening.  I also used frozen berries, straight from the freezer and the result was good although if you do this, you'll need to add to the cooking time by about 15 minutes.  It's also a good idea to add an extra tsp. of corn starch and be sure to let them set up for an hour or two before cutting for a clean cut.  These would be really good served on a plate with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.  Thanks!

Delicious!!  I used a mixture of frozen berries: Blueberries, Raspberries, and Blackberries.  I also substituted butter for the shortning and added a small amount of almond extract to the crust.  It turned out amazing!!!

With a plethera of store fresh blueberries, and company coming, I was going to bake a pie-but really felt too lazy so I tried these and WOW they are really very good!! I agree they are kind of like a crumb pie (especially having tasted it while it was still warm 'cause hubby and I couldn't bear to wait til dinner time)! Anyway, I beat the egg a little before adding it to the dough then worked the cut up two sticks of margarine (I think real butter would make these OUTSTANDINGLY rich and yummy), and egg in with my clean fingers until it was fairly crumbly-works better for me. I also added one more Tb. of cornstarch just because it has been my experience that most berry recipes never set up as much as I like. Be sure to lightly oil your pan. I also baked them at a slightly lower tempurature (my oven is weird), and added just a dash of cinnamon as well as a tiny dash of nutmeg to the crumb mixture. We're going to serve big squares of this with a scoop of vanilla ice cream on the side kind of like pie or cobbler because as others have said they are kind of crumbly. Thanks for a wonderfully good and simple recipe!

WOW!!  These are delicious!  Better then any blueberry muffin recipe I have tried.  I took others advice and used 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar.  I also used butter instead of shortening and a full tsp of cinnamon.  I let them cool until almost cooled and then put them in the fridge before I cut them.  I thought the flour mixture was a little too floury but they still turned out perfect!  I will definately make these again.  Maybe with cherries or apples and walnuts. Thank you for this recipe!

Great recipe! Since there are only the two of us, I cut the recipe in half and baked it in an 8x8" pan.  Turned out perfect.  I also grated a little orange rind in with the frozen blueberries that I used.  Actually, my hubby loved this so much I should have made the bigger size!!  Thanks.

This recipe was AMAZING.  It tastes just like my mothers blueberry buckle, but with more blueberry goodness.  I followed other reviewers' suggestions and:

(a) replaced 1c white sugar in crust with 1/2 c light brown sugar + 1/2 c white sugar.

(b) added 1 tsp cinnamon to crust (instead of a pinch).

(c) added the optional salt

(d) added 1 tsp vanilla to the egg

(e) added 1 tsp lemon juice to the sugar, cornstarch, and blueberry mixture

(f) added one extra tsp cornstarch

Definitely worth a try!  I'm about to head out to buy more blueberries to make more!

Mediocre, highly overrated recipe, even when prepared with the wise substitution of butter rather than shortening.  Not enough filling to support the overabundant amount of flavorless crust and topping.  So much tweaking is necessary in my opinion, itâ€™s just better to start from scratch with an altogether different recipe.

This is a good recipe that is tasty and VERY easy to make.I've made this twice now and both times the bars came out perfect. As others have stated, I substituted butter for the shortening, used 1/2 C white sugar, 1/2 C brown sugar, added 1tsp of vanilla, and 1tsp of cinnamon to the crumble.The result is a very flavourful crust 
 Oh and this time I used 2 C blue berries and 3 C   frozen sliced strawberries and the result is just as perfect, so don't be afraid to experiment a little.If you do add the strawberries just add  1/4 C more sugar to the fruits to balance out the extra tartness of the strawberries . Overall this is definitely a keeper!

These are delicious! They are best a little warm with vanilla ice cream melted on top. The crust and crumble topping are great and stay crunchy days later. I used fresh blueberries the first & third time I made these and black raspberries the second. The blueberries is still my favorite. I followed the recipe exactly but I used butter flavored shortening sticks (makes them stay crunchier longer!). This is my new favorite summertime dessert. I still want to experiment with more fresh fruit, I'm thinking of tart cherries. Mmmm!

I made this for the first time at the fire station.  this can be a risky adventure...if the meal is great then make it again.  If the meal is garbage then your life is in danger.

This was awesome!

I went half brown and half white sugar in the crust with butter.  Then I used the only berries we had: blackberries!  This was great right out of the oven and great hours later.  

Great recipe!  Fire Department Approved!  I WILL MAKE THIS AGAIN!

Great use of summer berries. I used 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1/2 cup of white sugar for the crust. I also used butter flavor crisco. I added the salt and 2 tablespoons of cinnamon. For the berries, I used 4 teaspoons of cornstarch. I made a glaze of powdered sugar, butter, vanilla, and milk. Yummy bars and not too sweet. Will def make again. Thanks for sharing!

This recipe rocks! I scaled the recipe to 5 servings, and used a loaf pan. It was the perfect amount for me. I read other reviewers and replaced the white flour with a combination of (1/2)whole wheat flour and then I added oatmeal, to replace the rest of the flour. I ground the oatmeal to a flour in my food processer. I also replaced 1/2 of the white sugar in the crumb with brown sugar. I added a little lemon juice, zest and vanilla to the bottom crust and baked it for 5 min. so it was less crumbly. I used more cinnamon as well because I love the taste. I made this recipe in my food processer and it was very easy to make. If you haven't tried this recipe, give it a try. It is even better the next day.

I thought these were pretty good; everyone at work raved about them.  I followed some previous recommendations and added 1/8 c water and 1 tsp vanilla to the bottom portion of the bars, baking it for 5 minutes before topping with the blueberry mixture and the rest of the dough.  I also added an extra tsp of corn starch to the blueberries.  They smelled delicious baking and tasted even better with some vanilla ice cream.  I look forward to trying this with raspberries.  Be warned--they are crumbly!  Thank you!

This was amazing, especially warmed up with vanilla bean ice cream! I will make this over and over again! I took some tips from the other reviewers and added 1/2c sugar + 1/2c brown sugar to the crust, along with quite a bit more cinnamon then called for, nutmeg and orange zest seasoning. I used butter rather than shortening. I added vanilla to the egg mixture, and a teaspoon more cornstarch to the blueberries; I didn't want them to be at all runny! I squeezed lemon on top of the berries, sprinkled a bit more orange zest, and then used my hands to sprinkle the crust on top. Squishing the little butter clumps with my hands made for a really great crispy topping. I ended up baking for 57 mins total, only because I used my timer in 6 min increments after the 45 min original timer. It probably could've gone the whole hour..
 
I used an 11x7 glass dish (2 qts) because I wanted thicker bars, and lined it with butter sprayed foil instead of greasing the pan. After it cooled, I drizzled a lemon/vanilla glaze I made by using powdered sugar, water, and lemon and vanilla extracts. It turned out SO well, the crust was buttery and crunchy with a hint of cinnamon.. the blueberries were sweet and held wonderfully with the extra cornstarch, and the lemon vanilla glaze? Perfection!!

So, I followed other reviews and did 1/2 brown sugar and 1/2 white.  Also used a cup of butter rather than shortening.  Some were saying that it was too crumbly and I was serving to a standing crowd so needed them to not make a mess... I added one cup of quick cooking oats (and only used 2 1/2 cups flour) and they stayed together well.  I also like the taste of oats in a bar like this!  Really yummy.  The blueberry layer was thick and delicious, but on the messy side.  Serve with napkins.  I have three toddlers and wouldn't let them near these!  Overall, a fresh taste, not too rich.

Great Recipe!  I substituted crisco butter flavored shortening also.  It is also very adaptable to gluten-free.  I used gluten-free flour and no one knew.  Tastes great!

Yummy!! I totally loved these!
Used frozen berries, added twice the amount of cornstarch, added half a teaspoon of ground vanilla bean and substituted some of the flour with oats.
The cooking time were perfect, even with frozen berries.

Pretty good!  These are pretty sweet.  For the crust, I used half white and half brown sugar, 1 tsp of vanilla, 1/4 tsp salt, 1/2 tsp cinnamon, and butter instead of shortening.  Then I doubled the amount of cornstarch and that was the perfect amount to get the blueberries to set.  I'm sure I will make this again and try a different kind of berry.

Thank you.  I used this recipe to make for my school work.  I used frozen raspberries instead of blueberries and butter instead of shortening.  Everyone loved them.  They looked excellent and tasted even better.  Thank you for posting.

Wow! This was great! I followed others' advice and used 1/2 cup white and 1/2 cup light brown sugar along with salted butter and 1 teaspoon cinnamon for the crust.  I mixed up half the dough in the food processor, which gave it a cookie dough consistency -perfect for spreading in the bottom of the pan for the crust.  I used an extra cup of frozen berries, although next time I think I'd double the berries. I still used only 1/2 cup white sugar for the berries, but doubled the cornstarch to 2 Tablespoons. The crumb topping I assembled by cutting the butter in with a pastry harp.  A definite keeper!

This is a great recipe as long as you make a few distinct changes. First off, don't use shortening and use cold butter - this is essential. Next, add the zest of one lemon to the crumb mixture and add the juice of one lemon to the blueberry mixture. Do this and this recipe will turn out great!

I made this to take to my BF's sister's house for Hurricane Isaac. The only change I made was to use 2c all purpose flour and 1c whole wheat. BIG hit with the evacuees!!! Had lots of requests for another, bigger batch. I might add chopped pecans in the crust next time. Thanks for making us happy during the big blow!

I love to bake, therefore bake all the birthday treats at the office.  I planned to make an angel food cake which turned into a disaster!  Well I used the ingredient search to find something to make with what I had on hand and this came up.  I cut everything in half and baked in an 8x8 pan.  Absolutely amazing!  I used shortening as stated and did half white sugar and half brown sugar.  My blueberries were frozen (but they were fresh ones I bought and froze, not the storebought bag of frozen) and I didn't wait for them to thaw.  It came out perfect!

I got into the habit of baking for coworkers' birthdays for the past year and I always get a lot of good reviews (most things I make are from this webiste).  This time I tried the blueberry crumb bars for my boss's birthday it got me a marriage proposal from a collegue who already loved everything else I've made!  Some coworkers who've eaten everything I've baked but never said anything before would not stop giving compliments.  I did use butter and half brown sugar, as well as salt, cinnamon, and vanilla, following other reviews.  I used a 3 cup bag of frozen blueberries and a 2 cup bag of frozen berry medley (strawberries, raspberries, blueberries, blackberries).  One of the easier recipes I've tried too!

Eeeeh.  Sorry to disagree with so many high ratings, but this didn't come out sweet or yummy enough for a five-star.  I followed the recipe and the bars look great, but taste like crisco.  They are not very sweet at all.  Perhaps further experimentation will allow me to tweak it to a good dessert.

these are delicious, and if you want to make them even BETTER, add chopped pecans to the topping, and serve them with whipped cream on the side, *out of this world*!!

These were good but I made with butter flavored crisco instead of real butter. I will try them again with real butter. I also froze a batch for 2 weeks and they came out good.

This is sooo delicious! I used butter instead of shortening. Also used half brown sugar & half white, 1C wheat flour, the rest white. It is incredibly tasty & it keeps really well. This is a keeper! You must make this - so worth it!

I made this today but used fresh cranberries since I didn't have any blueberries on hand. And butter instead of shortening. Also used 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar for the crust. It was delish! Will certainly be making this again.

I prepared these as the recipe was written, and they were very good. The only problem I had was that they were not as sweet as I would have liked. I will definitely make them again, but I'll be adding a bit more sugar next time.

We enjoyed these a lot! I followed some of the other reviewers, added a little milk and prebaked the bottom crust, added extra cornstarch, and the best addition was the extra half cup of brown sugar to the top layer - made a nice sweet crunchy top! Yum!

Easy and taste great!  I followed other reviews by using butter, half white sugar and half brown sugar, and also added an extra tsp of cornstarch to the blueberry mix.  I melted half of my butter so it was easier to mix and by doing this, my mix wasn't dry but more like cookie dough.  I used 4 cups of frozen blueberry and I think it's plenty.  Definitely will make this again.

I made this for my husband because he LOVES blueberries.  The adjustments I made partly based on other reviews - I used butter instead of shortening, used half white and half brown sugar in the dough, included the optional cinnamon and salt and added a tablespoon of vanilla extract, added an extra teaspoon of cornstarch to the blueberry mix, and added 1 cup of sliced almonds & chopped walnuts and an additional 1/2 cup of brown sugar to the remaining dough for the crumb topping.  I also used frozen blueberries instead of fresh.  

It turned out pretty yummy, but I felt like the dough could be a little sweeter - it tasted a bit like biscuit dough to me.  Next time I make this I might up the sugars to 2/3 cup each and try that.  The bars were very tastey though, really showcased the blueberries, and the flavor got even better the next day.  :)

I made a few changes, and the bars were thoroughly enjoyed.  I used butter instead of shortening, used salt, used both cinnamon and nutmeg, and instead of just blueberries I used a mix of blueberries, raspberries, and blackberries.  I used my stand mixer to blend in butter & egg into the dough.  I only had to bake it for 40 minutes, and then drizzled the top with icing (blend 1 cup confectioners sugar, 1/4 tsp. vanilla, and milk to thin) and then sprinkled on chopped pecans.

Great, easy dessert! Brought these to a family dinner and they were devoured.  My dad asked for a double batch for his birthday!  I followed the suggestions of some others - added 1 tsp of vanilla to the beaten egg, used butter instead of shortening, used half white sugar and half light brown, and I cooked the bottom crust for about 5 minutes to get it lightly browned.  I used frozen blueberries and cooked them for 55 mins.  Delicious!

I made this with butter in lieu of shortening, 1/2 brown sugar and 1/2 white sugar for the crust and crumbs, and frozen blueberries.  It was perfect.  I actually reduced the amount of sugar in the blueberry mix and it tasted just fine.  I would venture to say that any type of berry would work well in these bars.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

Love these! Added real maple syrup (2 Tbs) to the sugar for the dough. I also used butter instead of shortening, frozen berries and 100% white whole wheat flour. Delicious! Next I'll try mixed berries and brown sugar.

Nice dessert bars! I definitely would recommend using butter- flavored shortening (or butter) and sticking to all- purpose flour because you can really taste the difference. It would be fun to try out different types of berries. Great, flexible dessert!

Subbed butter for shortening and they were delicious!  I have also made these with strawberries and a little extra cornstarch too.  Fantastic either way.

This is my "GO TO" summer dessert in blueberry season!  I have made it 6 times in the last 3 weeks and it goes over so well.  I usually do the 1/2 cup white and the 1/2  cup LIGHT brown sugar (not dark, it does make a difference) and don't skip the cinnamon.  I usually cook 40 minutes only, just until it is slightly browned on top.  Great warm, cooled, dessert or breakfast!

Made with fresh strawberries for my son's graduation (his fav fruit) and it turned out fantastic. I used 7 cups of fresh berries from my garden and baked 55 minutes. I forgot the egg-no problem. I used butter, half brown & half white sugar-same for flour. I also used most of the crumb mixture for the crust and then made a crumb/pecan/oatmeal crumb topping for on top. Very excellent. I also didn't add the 1/2 cup sugar and cornstarch to my berries-didn't need to--they set up beautifully. Leftovers are eaten for breakfast with a little warm milk!

These are great! Not overly sweet and would be great for a summer picnic or cookout! I did use unsalted butter instead of shortening and added more cinnamon to the dough. Next time I think I will try this with cherries mixed in the blueberries, Yum!

So I was worried about how they'd turn out because the shortening and dry ingredients didn't "crumb" together too well. And then it took a total of about 55-60min for it to brown on top decently. However, I just cut into it and holy , is that yummy!  I did half white and brown sugar for the crust, then about 4 cups of frozen blueberries (only changes made). Wonderful!!!!! The BF will love it! Will definitely be trying with other berries and will try with butter next time rather than shortening. Thanks!!!

Just made this and it tastes pretty good.  I substituted butter for the shortening and I only had frozen blueberries.  I added a bit more cinnamon because our family loves cinnamon. I will make it again.

I made this yesterday because I was jonesin for something blueberry! I cut the recipe in half but otherwise followed the recipe as written. I agree with other reviewers that the taste is not overly sweet. I liked how these came out, but I think I would make a couple changes for next time. I think I will add brown sugar and some vanilla/almond extract in with the dough. Thanks for sharing this recipe!

BLUEBERRY PERFECTION!  What a great recipe.  I added coconut and almonds on top of the blueberry mixture before I added the crumb topping.  Then I lightly added a vanilla glaze.

My revisions are as follows: half AP flour and half WW; 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar; 1 tsp cinnamon; butter instead of shortening; frozen blueberries instead of fresh. I have another similar recipe and everyone advised to defrosting and draining the berries as they become EXTREMELY juicy - as was the case with this. Even after refrigerating they're mushy. And not sweet enough... There are too many other fantastic desserts to eat, so I probably wouldn't make this again.

These were good but a little bland for me. Maybe next time I will add a little more sugar to the crust, more cinnamon and some lemon zest or juice.

These bars turned out really well. This was one of my best attempts at using fresh fruit. Usually it turns out too dry or too wet, but these were just right. I cooked half of the blueberries on the stove with some sugar, then mixed in the rest of the berries before adding them on to the bottom crust. I also added about 1/2 cup of brown sugar to the crust mix before putting it on top. I will be keeping this recipe to try with other fruits when they are in season!

These were tasty! I used butter rather than shortening, plus I added nutmeg (just because I love it!) with the cinnamon.  Refrigerate after they cool a bit, to help them to stick together & cut easily.  Lovely treat!  Thanks!

I followed the suggestions of other reviewers and replaced the 1 c. of shortening with 1 c. of butter.  I served these at a party and they were a hit.  UPDATE: I made these again using 1/2 c. brown sugar and 1/2 c. white.  I also replaced 1 c. of the all purpose flour with 1 c. whole wheat flour.  I will make with these changes from now on.  Also, I've made these both with fresh and frozen blueberries, and they've turned out great both ways.

I made this recipe twice this past week and they were gone in no time -  Everyone loves them!  I took other's advice and substituted butter for shortening and used brown sugar instead of white.  I also used frozen triple berries instead of blueberries, because that's what I had on hand.  After reading other's reviews, I patted 3/4 of the dough onto the bottom of the pan and then mixed in a little more butter and sugar with the remaining dough and used that on the top - turned out perfect. This recipe is a definite keeper!

These are not at all like a cookie but more like a blueberry cobbler with lots of "cobble" or the good stuff (less liquid too). I added cinnamon to the dough and the berries and used the blueberries straight out of the freezer without thawing. A great use of those extra blueberries and everyone loves it.

o my, these are something else. i didnt think there was enough crumbs so i doubled that...which means 2x much crumbly goodness! you might want to increase it by half instead though, becasue they were a little too heavy. Thank you a. beavers, these really scaled the "wow" factor charts...

This recipie is o.k.  I didnt really like the crust/topping because it had a shortening flavor to it.  I wonder how well it would work with butter, because I think it would dramatically improve the flavor.

Oh. My. Gosh.   This is absolutely my favorite blueberry recipe.  I've made it so many times and it is always sugary, blueberry-y (? lol), and delicious.  Served warm with some vanilla bean ice cream on top?  One of the greatest things in the world. :)

This is a simple and fast desert to make.  I used frozen blueberries without thawing them and it worked great. A little sweet so one could cut back on the sugar if they wanted to. I added some oats to the topping to give it a little more texture. I also used more cinnamon than a pinch.  I am thinking nutmeg would be better. Next time I am adding lemon zest to the blueberries and pecans to the topping. That should improve it.

They were yummy! I used all whole wheat flour and so for a little extra sweetness before adding the blueberries I spread a layer of salted caramel hazelnut spread on the dough in the pan, then blueberry mixture as directed ...so perfect!

Very good and super easy to make! I added a little lemon rind to the blueberries. Better to use butter for this recipe and not shortening.

I just made this, and it turned out delicious! I used a can of pie topping (cherry) as I had no fresh berries but it was still delicious! I also used oil instead of shortening. Enjoy!

Jack and I liked these very much.  Since it was just the two of us, I halved all the ingredients and used my 8x8 inch pan...I even used only half an egg (although I don't know that was necessary).  Baking time was about 40 minutes.

I made this with mulberries and it's delicious. Just make sure you drain the berries after thawing if you're using frozen berries, otherwise it will be too watery.  I've made this 3 times already! It's quick and easy.

Delicious recipe.  I followed the advice from other reviewers and used butter in place of the shortening, added some vanilla extract to the crust, and a bit of lemon zest to the blueberries, and then added a cup of frozen dark cherries to the 4c up blueberries.  Thanks for sharing, it was a big hit with my family.

This recipe was changed slightly following some suggestions from other bakers. 1) Used 1/2 brown sugar & 1/2 white sugar for base. 2) used 1/2 butter & 1/2 vegetable shortening, in place of all shortening. Bars were terrific. 3) Beat egg & added 1 Tbsp. water & added to cut together dry ingredients. The only thing I did different, on my own, was taking the dough & pressing small bits of dough,thin to make an almost solid crust on top. Also added a very small thin lemon drizzle over top. I like blueberries & lemon together. Loved by all & finished by end of picnic.

Very good and so nice to see a bar recipe with fruit filling that isn't sickenly sweet.   We prefer to use half butter because shortening does not have as nice a flavor and also better is better for you.   Granted these are quite rich but go a long way.   Just too much shortening by itself is our only complaint.

Great bar! I added lemon zest, 2 tbsp fresh lemon juice, 1/2 brown & 1/2 white sugar, and 2-tsp vanilla to the crust/crumb mixture, and also used butter (ew, Shortening!). I also baked my crust for 7-min before putting the blueberries & crumb top on. And I added 2 tbsp lemon juice and to the blueberries mixture. Soooo good!! Lemon flavor pairs beautifully!! Not too sweet, good for breakfast. I would probably add another 1/2 cup of white sugar to the berries if I wanted more of a dessert. Will most definitely make again!!

Oh these are yummy goodness! I subbed half of the white sugar with brown sugar as mentioned in one of the reviews. Fantastic! Even had a college kid ask if he could take more home with him.

Made this for the first day of the summer. Sooo good! I only had 8x8 pan so I halved everything and only used the yolk of the egg. As other reviewers, I used butter instead of shortening. For the filling, I used 2 cup blueberries, the juice of half of a lemon, 1/4c sugar and Â± 2 tsp cornstarch. Baked for 40 minutes and it turned out perfect. I'll be making it again and again this summer!

Very good recipe.  My husband loves blueberries and he couldn't wait to eat this.  In fact he ate it warm so it was kind of like a blueberry crumble or cobbler.  He's already had a few pieces and it hasn't even cooled.  I did make modifications to the recipe only because I had about 3 cups of blueberries.  I halved the recipe and modified the filling for so the blueberries didn't go to waste.  This might have been too much blueberries for my personal taste but not my husband.  This was a quick and easy treat to make.  I would definitely make this again.

These bars were delicious!    The only changes I made were 1) using 1/2 white sugar and 1/2 brown sugar in the crumb mixture.  2) I used butter instead of sugar and cut it back to 3/4 a cup.   They were  So good!!!!  But so fattening.   I'm going to see if I can lighten it up more by maybe cutting back the butter more and perhaps substituting oats for some of the flour..

Delicious!  I added a little extra cornstarch to my blueberries b/c they were particularly ripe/juicy.  I found the recipe very sweet - next time I'd cut out 1/4 cup of sugar.  Overall very easy to make and a great dessert to serve when entertaining.

Delicious and so easy! A great way to use all those berries from the farmer's market. I have made this type of cookie for years using jam instead of fresh fruit. I did use butter instead of shortening, as that's what I've used in the past. Whole family loved these!

I didn't have any blueberries, blackberries or raspberries but i did have some frozen strawberries. I used that and it turned out really good! i recommend leaving it out to melt a bit when you mix it with sugar and cornstarch, it gives more juices. I definately will make it again!

I made a few changes to these.  I added a layer of flax seeds, added 3/4 cup of oatmeal to the crumble mix, and only added about 1/4 cup of sugar to the blueberry mixture.  They turned out delicious!

never made crumb bars before, and these turned out great! i used frozen blackberries instead of the fresh blueberries and didn't thaw them first. they baked in really well. i also followed somebody else's advice and used smart balance light (boyfriend has an allergy to lactose) and mixed in a half a teaspoon of vanilla to the base layer. so good! and not super sweet. great as a snack, with coffee or as a dessert.

I did the half brown-sugar half regular and it was delicious. My husband said it was the "yummiest thing" I've ever made and said he could have eaten the whole thing and then taken he day off of work because he'd be recovering!

I have to say I was disappointed in how these turned out . . . especially considering all of the glowing reviews!  The base was too flour-y for me, and a bit on the bland side.  The filling was good but the topping was too flour-y in taste as well.  I think adding oats or something would break up the texture a bit?  Not sure but I just didn't have the same great results that others did.  May try again as it is a great idea for all the summer blueberries.

This was one of the best desserts I've ever made!  I served it at a dinner party, sort of like a cobbler.  The cinnamon I think gives it a distinct taste.  I also highly recommend that you serve this with vanilla ice cream to cut the sweetness.

Lower carb version: 

I made a pan today using 1/2 c. sugar and 1/2 c. Splenda in the bar portion and it was very good.

I did use sugar only with the fruit, but cut the amount down to 1/4 cup with success.  

Enjoy!

I liked these bars.  I did what the reviewers mentioned - used 1/2 white & 1/2 brown sugar.  I put about 1 tsp of Cinnamon & added vanilla.  Very easy - I prebaked the crust for 5 minutes before putting in blueberries!  Might not do that again.  Even my husband who doesn't love blueberries (to put it nicely) liked the bars!

This recipe was delicious! Following the advice of other reviewers, I substituted the shortening with butter. I did add the optional cinnamon and salt and I think that the pinch of cinnamon adds just the right amount of flavor to the crust. It was a huge hit with my family!

I'm giving the recipe 4 stars based on the fact that the bars turned out.  I followed the recipe with the exception of using half brown sugar and half white.  Perhaps I would've liked them more had I used butter, but I didn't have any softened.  I might try the recipe again if I have blueberries on hand.

This was REALLY simple to make - and it turned out delicious even though I didn't follow it to a tee! I used all brown sugar for the crust, added some lemon juice and actually ended up using an 8x12 and a 8x8 because I had so much extra! TIP: let cool on wire racks, and then refrigerate over night - makes cutting up pieces SO easy and they don't crumble at all!!

Just made this and it's so much better than I had expected! I followed the recipe exactly. Butter flavored shortening. Frozen blueberries. Added spices that I like, clove and cinnamon (til flour speckled slightly), to the crust, as well as vanilla w/ the egg. I didn't cook it long enough apparently so it went back in the oven to get a deeper browning (like original photo or use foil)
I was worried about using the entire other half on top as I wanted more fruit than dough and some color, but the juices colored the top beautifully!! I think the berries being frozen helped maybe. Started off with my hand pastry blender but both me and my assistant (2 year old son) got bored/tired so it got thrown in the mixer. voila.
SN: made these the day before a road trip so once they cooled I put them in an airtight plastic container and by the morning of our trip they were moist with a nice center and just perfect! Definitely will make these for snacks on a trip again.

Delicious!  I made this recipe with fresh raspberries and blueberries.  I followed other reviewers' recommendations and used 1/2 c white sugar and 1/2 c brown sugar for the crust/topping, and added cinnamon and nutmeg.  I also added a little bit of water and lemon juice to the bottom crust part (to make it less crumbly); and I added an extra cup of berries and at least a tsp of lemon juice to the berries, and didn't use all of the dough that was left for the topping (I wanted more fruit and less crust on top).  They are really yummy.  I think that next time I'll try an oatmeal streusel topping -- I think oats would taste great in this recipe:)

Made a batch of these yesterday with fresh blackberries that the kids picked. Actually, my 9 year old made these. That's how easy it was. They turned out wonderful. Had a bunch of blackberries so decided to make another batch. This time I used 1/2 white and half brown sugar. Toassed a few oats on top for presentation. Can't wait to taste the difference.

Really yummy (especially hot with vanilla ice cream)!  Definitely add some vanilla and do half white sugar, half brown - I also use unsalted butter instead of shortening.  My husband and I both loved them!

Unfortunately we found this to be very dry & bland. I think adding 1/2 cup of blueberries and a full tsp. of cinnamon would help.

This was a recipe I've been excited to make but I made it as stated and it was not very good.. that's a 9x13 pan of not very good dessert.. such a bummer!  So, if I make this again (and we'll see).. I'd use butter for a shortbread effect and add vanilla. Without those two this is just not very good.

This is one of my favorite summer desserts. I have made it with just blueberries, and also with a mixture of berries.  My favorite is to add mainly blueberries, and a but (like 1/3) raspberries.   I used half white sugar, and half brown sugar.  and butter (real butter) instead of shortening. and to avoid mushing the crust, I threw it in my food processor (just don't over mix it.) It had to be crumby!

Used margarine instead of shortening.  Added 1 tsp lemon juice to half of crumb mixture to use as base.  Used frozen blueberries (did not thaw).  Did not use salt.    Next time I will not add sugar to blueberry mixture as it was VERY sweet.

I'm pretty sure I messed this up because I got a dough, not a crumble.. Which is fine for the base but I ended up making another crumble for the top without putting in any egg, which worked. Despite the disaster I had putting it together, it's pretty yummy! Next time I will add more fruit because there's not enough for me.. Although it must be good enough since I've eaten half of it and it hasn't even cooled yet lol!

These were a big hit at a 4th of July BBQ.  I added raspberries to make the red and blue.  Super easy to make.  I don't think it was a mistake when the hostess didn't return the leftovers to me the next day.

Excellent bars for a picnic.  Not too sweet so if you are a sugar fanatic, you probably won't like it.  I used all butter and even cheated by cutting 2 tablespoons out to lower the calories a bit.  I also used 2 pints blueberries, 1 tsp. of vanilla, and some fresh lemon juice in the blueberry mixture.  For the flour mix, I used 1-1/2 cups  all purpose white and 1-1/2 cups white whole wheat for added nutrition.  1/2 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar was just right for flavor.  These are even better the next day so in the future, I'll make these a day ahead.  You could easily add more blueberries to make this extra fruity and delicious.

I loved these. I had blueberries and cherries on hand, so I mixed them together. I did follow another reviewer's suggestion to add a little vanilla and water to half the crust so that the bottom was a little more solid and less crumbly than the top. I will definitely make these again. Quick, easy and delicious!

This recipe was awsome...the only thing I didn't like about it was the portion size was small:) I also added vanilla in the egg and mixed with brown sugar also.  Probably would have also added a pinch more salt.  Will Def. make again!

I actually thought these bars were pretty bland. They really needed something else. They are edible but I would not make them again.

These were sour, too crumbly, and bland. I followed the recipe exactly, except I used butter instead. And it did not turn out. All the other reviews were "great!" and "delicious," so I was excited to make these.

Delicious! I used butter instead of shortening and it came out wonderful. Use the paddle attachment on your stand mixer if you have one, it's easy and does the job perfectly.

Pretty good but not stellar. I added cinnamon and nutmeg and used frozen blueberries. Also used margarine instead of shortening. Oh and I added a half tsp of salt to the flour mixture. This seemed more of a crumble-type dessert to me. So I served it warm with vanilla ice cream.

Great and easy recipe! I love that the same mixture is used for both the bottom crust and the crumb on top! I used fresh blackberries and it worked great. The only thing I'd do differently next time would be to add less sugar. They were a little sweet for me, but everyone else loved them.

I halved the recipe and poured into an 8-inch baking dish.  As per other reviewers I used half butter and half brown sugar.  I also increased the cinnamon a bit (personal preference).  Everyone absolutely loved these.  Moist and delicious!

love these! so does the family. very fresh tasting, and easy to make - my new favorite blueberry recipe! I did make a few changes - I substituted a cup of oats for one of the cups of flour, used butter instead of shortening, used half brown sugar instead of all white. Next time I may try sprinkling some nuts on top too.

don't sub anything except butter for the shortning! i ran out of both and used oil and it was still really good - but definitely would have been better otherwise. next time i'm giong to use some brown sugar, as has been recommended, and stick to the recipe and i'm sure it will be phenominal! Oh, my favorite was that it wasn't super sweet - really fresh!

These were pretty good.  They were easy and looked really good but were very sweet, which seemed to overpower the natural flavor of the blueberries.  The bars were also a little bland.  Next time I will decrease the sugar, increase the cinnamon, and add some nutmeg and vanilla.

OH MY GOD I LOVE THESE!!!!
They are awesome. I served them warm with vanilla ice cream. I used 1/2 crisco 1/2 butter a little extra starch..blueberries always seem to be so juicy.. and a bit more than a pinch of cinnamon.  They do take longer to cook than the recipe says. My picky 9 year old daughter even said  " mighty tasty!!"
That says it all !!!

Excellent recipe.  I followed instructions as stated and only added some vanilla, cinnamon and netmeg to the crust, which I baked per another reviewer's suggestion for about 5 minutes before adding frozen blueberries, which I coated with sugar and cornstarch and the add'l. crumb topping.  Be advised that these bars are dry, a bit more than I expected but with some vanilla ice cream or just whipped cream, they are delicious.  Thanks for the recipe!!

Awesome! We added 2 tsp cinnamon and 1/4 tsp nutmeg and 1 tbl vanilla to the crust and it was fantastic. We also used all butter and frozen blueberries. We made the crust in a food processor. YUM!

These were actually pretty good. I used frozen blueberries, and just baked it for an additional 10 minutes. They came out just fine. I also used butter and sprinkled the bars with cinnamon and sugar. They held together well and were easy to cut and serve.

Delicious! Simple  ingredients and simple to make! 

I made a couple of slight changes -I used butter instead of shortening as per peoples' recommendations, and vanilla essence instead of cinnamon, as that's all I had available. Turned out great! 

My husband & I got impatient and ate some of it warm with vanilla ice-cream, and then left the rest to cool completely before cutting it into bars. I think it works equally well hot or cold! 

When I make it again i think I may use slightly less sugar with the blueberry mix (you only need that much if the blueberries are tart), and if I were to serve it as a hot dish then I'd probably use more blueberry filling, to make it more like a pie. 

Thanks for a wonderful recipe, it's definitely a keeper!

DELICIOUS!  I am rating this a five, but I used REAL BUTTER as suggested in other reviews.  My 9 year old son who has hated every blueberry crisp/bar/muffin I have ever made LOVED it.  I also added some sliced almonds to the top crumble.  SO good, warm or cold right out of the fridge.

I used 1 stick butter and 1 stick margerine instead of shortening. Also greased pan with butter.  I used the 1 cup of white sugar and added 1/3 cup of brown sugar and it wasn't at all too sweet.  I also added 1 tsp. of lemon extract to the crumb mixture.  A little lemon zest would be good with the blueberries.  They were so yummy!

i just accidentaly gave this review to some other blueberry recipe....ooops!! so if you see this review again, ignore it! anyways, i found these to be reaally fantastic, but i altered it alot after reading the reviews. i noted that alot of the reviewers found the dough bland and/or too crumbly. i added the zest of 2 small oranges, 2 tsp cinnamon, 1 tsp nutmeg,1 tsp allspice, and 1/2 tsp salt. i also added 2 tbsp milk and an extra egg yolk.i used all brown sugar, probably 1 1/2 cups. using a food processor was a really good suggestion, so thank you to whomever suggested that! to the berries i added the juice of 1 orange and 1/2 lemon, plus a little extra cornstarch. OH.MY.GOODNESS. amazing!!!!! it's incredible how good the citrus is in this...the dough is anything but bland, and i liked the texture i ended up with! after all the alterations i would give tis 5 stars forsure.

This was yummy! I'm only giving 4 stars because the crust wasn't too good. I used half butter and half shortening and the flavor was good, but the consistency of the crust wasn't what I expected from crumb bars. I suggest using beaten egg plus 3 table spoons of milk to the crumb mixture to make it a little more moist. I used blackberries I picked from our ranch and it was delicious, although next time I'll sprinkle with little bit of lemon juice in berry mixture.

Mmm. Awesome Bars. I was looking for an alternative to muffins since they all seem to come out dry or flavorless. I took some of the other users' advice and used butter instead of shortening and substituted some brown sugar for the granulated sugar. Be sure to cool them thoroughly before cutting (i put mine in the fridge after they cooled on the counter before cutting)

Awesome!  I made it exactly as directed, and it came out perfect.  It tastes just like blueberry pie!  Next time, I'll leave it in the oven a bit longer so it's more golden brown, instead of light brown.  It's now a permanent part of my recipe box!!  :)

Nice.  Yummy - better the second day.

Taking tips from the other reviewers, I used butter instead of shortening, substituted brown sugar for half the sugar.  I also forgot the cornstarch but it didn't seem to matter.  Seems like as long as you let them cool they don't fall apart too badly.

I used a blueberry/cherry combination.  Probably could have used a bit more fruit, but if I do (the next time) I'll add some corn starch just to be on the safe side.

Will DEFINITELY make again.  Have to give these away, though - having them in the house is plain ol' dangerous to what's left of my waist.

Great recipe. Made it twice substituting butter for shortening both times. The first time I brought it to a picnic and got requests for the recipe. The second time I substituted a quick cooking oats for a half cup of the flour - delicious!

Used another reviewer's tip to grate frozen butter..worked wonderfully.  Don't forget to press crust into pan!  Don't skip salt and cinammon in the crust.  I used more than a pinch of cinammon.  Split recipe and made 2 8x8s...one blueberry and one raspberry.  Can't even pick a favorite.  I'm hoping this will work with peaches too!

Excellent recipe.  Very quick and easy to make and extremely tasty. Everyone at the office loved it.  I patted the top layer on to make it as much like a top dough as possible, rather than "crumb" and sprinkled sugar over the top before baking.  This gave it that crisp sugary crust like you get on bakery muffins - it worked out very well. Will definitely make again - can't wait to try another type of berry. Thanks!

These were fantastic after they had set for a day.  Leave them a day before cutting into them! A few hours out of the oven, they weren't anywhere near as good.  Followed recipe as written!

Everyone enjoyed this recipe, I baked it about 8 minutes longer until it was golden brown, this additional time may be due to the high altitude where I live. I agree with another reviewer use real butter it makes a huge difference. Also added a few sliced peeled fresh peaches (about 2/3 cup) that I diced and added to the blueberries mixture. Fast, easy, and yummy!

We thought this recipe was okay.  The blueberry filling was good but we thought the crust was rather dry.  Also, I expected the top crust to be more like a strusel but it didn't quite turn out that way.  I added a vanilla glaze to add the the presentation and it happened to remedy the dryness a bit.  I served it with a scoop of ice cream which is why I think it went over as well as it did.  I don't think my family would have eaten it plain.  No one said they didn't like it but they didn't ask me to make it again either.

This recipe is delicious with a little tweeking. Use butter instead of shortening and no salt or cinnamon and it is perfect. Not too sweet. Can't wait to try it with raspberries. Thanks for sharing.

Yummy! I left out the egg - a friend of ours is allergic and it still turned out great. I took the advice of other reviewers and baked the crust for  a few minutes before adding the blueberries. This one is a keeper!

I made these for a potluck but I was distracted and forgot to add the baking powder.  I quickly mixed up a batch of baked beans to take instead but when these bars came out of the oven I decided to try a little before I threw them out.  It was wonderful.  A little flat but still wonderful.  I ended up taking both the crumb bars and the beans.  Everyone loved the bars.  I told them imagine how good they could have been if I had remembered all the ingredients.  Ha Ha.

I'm not too fond of blueberries, but my husband is, so I decided to try these ! They are WONDERFUL!! I even loved them! When making blueberry mixture, I blended with an electric mixer on ,low until some of the berries were crushed. It didn't specify in the recipie what to do other than to Mix. They are really great!

Excellent recipe. As others suggested I used butter instead of shortening and added a teaspoon of vanilla to crumble. I mixed the crumble in my Kitchenaid stand mixer.  I firmly pressed the bottom layer of crumble in the pan to make a nice crust.  I used frozen blueberries and increased the cooking time by 10 minutes. It turned out great. I will make this again.

I used softened butter instead of shortening and had a winner. My blueberries were quite ripe and sweet, so the sugar called for was perfect. If your berries are a bit more tart, you can always add a bit more sugar. I would also strongly suggest that you up the cinnamon to about a half teaspoon. It really adds a great flavor to the bars.

With fresh blueberries - Delish!

I used softened butter and had no problem forming a crumbled crust, which was somewhat crusty when first baked to lightly browned (45 min. at 350). 

Although I opted for the dash of salt and cinnamon, it was not even perceptible at 1/8 ("Pinch") tsp. I had use. Next time I would at least double that amount. 

The berry filling, however, came out perfect - an once the berries had been cleaned and washed, the recipe took hardly any time to prep.

Thank you A. Beavers - This one is a keeper!

Made this recipe and it was wonderful.  I didn't want to share.  I added a little more vanilla than it called for and instead of a pastry blender I used my mixer with the whisk attachment and it was perfect.  I think I'll try other fruit next time.

Great starter recipe!  Following the other reviews, I also subbed butter for the shortening.  I also used sweet cherries in place of the blueberries, which worked well.  To go with the cherries, I added a dash of clove to the dry ingredients and mixed in 1 teaspoon of almond extract with the egg.

I've used a recipe very close to this one for 35 years, it's pretty versatile.the only changes to my tried and true Cobbler are, 31/2 cups flour, I cup sugar, 1/4 tsp baking power, 1/4 tsp baking soda, 1/4 tsp salt, use 1/2 a lb of margarine or butter flavored Crisco or any other like substitute you prefer even butter. Mix until crumbly. Place 1/2 of mixture in  a 15" by 11" or a 9 by 12" I use the 25" it serves more. You can make your oun filling or 2 cans of pie filling, 2 different flavor if preferred then sprinkle the remainder of your flour mixture over the top. I've found that I needed to bake this longer than 45 min, I just bake until nicely browned.easy , quick and delish !!

I gave this recipe 4 stars and not 5 mainly because even though my family and I liked this recipe it wasn't absolutely spectacular. I baked the bars the night before and my children ate this as breakfast the next morning. The only alteration I made was that I used butter flavored Crisco and this was only because I was out of the other. I actually think that this added a depth of flavor that I probably would have missed with regular Crisco. I am always on the lookout for blueberry recipes so I will definitely be keeping this one in the recipe book. Thanks!

Very easy and turned out perfectly. I also made some of the changes that others did. I used half white/brown sugar, 2 sticks of butter instead of shortening, added the cinnamon, and did 4 tsp. cornstarch. I also added a touch of vanilla to the blueberry mix. Turned out perfectly and after I refrigerated the pan they stayed together super well and were so easy to cut into small bars to give to my friends.

I have been making these for a year now and have always used frozen fruit. I have used blueberries, strawberries, mixed berries, cherries and I also made a mango pineapple with shredded coconut. They are all to die for. I started making them because they are dairy free and I have a lot of friends and family who cannot have any kind of dairy. Also i have made them with sweet and low for a sugar free version. I am always asked to make these they are a huge hit.

I was a little worried on how tart the bars would be because of how many blueberries the recipe called for but that wasn't a problem at all! I substituted the shortening with butter as well as the 1 C. White sugar with 1/2 dark brown and 1/2 white. I made a 9x13 inch pan batch and it was gone in less than 24 hours! Definitely recommend & will be saving this recipe!

Came out perfect! I used both brown and white sugar, added some vanilla extract and used 2 eggs along with butter instead of shortening. Can't wait to have it with my coffee in the morning!

The blueberries were good just too much dough.  We ended up taking off the top crust and covering it in ice cream.

I only changed one thing, and that was using butter instead of shortning.  I will make these again, I'll even try different fruits like sour cherries.

I read many reviews before I made these bars. I used butter instead of shortening. At 45 minutes, the bars weren't brown. I baked another 10 min. The bottom did not crumble. You have to make sure you press the bottom layer down firmly. Also, make sure the top is a nice golden brown. That means the bottom is baked the way it should be. We love these bars. They are absolutely delicious.

I made a batch of these for a BBQ this weekend, and they were a huge it! I made with gluten-free flour, and everyone still raved about them! Next time, I'll adjust the crumble ratio to 2/3 crust, 1/3 topping.

Partial review (in the oven still :D): This is a very different recipe than the usual half in the pan, half on top.  I was uneasy about "halving" with an egg, but I did - as weird as it was.  I added 1/2t salt & cinnamon to the flour mixture; oh, an extra t cornstarch because the berries are very juicy.  The flour part is quite dry. Baking at 375 in glass.  It's competitor is Blueberry Boy Bait (in metal).  We'll see ...  Results:  Pretty bland & ho-hum.  (Yes, those are different in my book :D)  'Looked much better than it tasted.  :(  No repeats.

This is soo good! Used butter instead of shortening and 2 cups of raspberries with 2 cups of blueberries. I sprinkled some sugar on the top for crunch and took the advice of previous reviews for more cornstarch. Gooey and perfect! amazing way to enjoy a dessert with some healthy fruits :))

Substituted butter for shortening, and used all brown sugar for the base.  Used a food processor to cut in the butter. Chopped frozen peaches for the fruit layer so it took longer to bake.  Didn't adjust anything else except that it baked in a 12 x 8 pan so the base was a bit thicker.  Next time would possibly add a handful of coconut to the crumb topping, or try chopped apples and more cinnamon.  Kids loved it. Will make again.

Great recipe. Partner, kids & I have just been blueberry picking, so needed something yummy to make. Only changes I made, was to add the rind of an orange to the crumb mix and used 2 1/2 cups of flour & 1/2cup of rolled oats instead of 3 cups of flour, making it feel healthy!

Absolutely wonderful! Perfect amount of sweetness with the fresh blueberries. I am making it again tomorrow and will make one with blueberries again and then another with a different berry. I also will opt for a glaze drizzle. I think it would make this dessert even better.

Good base.  Like others, I used 1/2 white, 1/2 brown sugar and butter rather than shortening in the crumble.  I used a mix of raspberries, blueberries, and apple for the filling.  I've made this with just blueberries in the past but prefer a mix of fruits for a more complex flavour.  I used freshly grated nutmeg rather than cinnamon.

Some have commented that the crust doesn't 'come together'.  I don't think it's supposed to.  I just pour half to two-thirds of it in the pan and pat it down.  The rest I shake over the top.  I find the powderiness of the crumble makes it easy to work with in this way and it creates a firm base when baked.

Really good bars! I used butter instead of shortening as others have suggested. I used frozen berries that I defrosted & drained (a LOT of liquid came off so I'm glad I did defrost them first). Baked for almost an hour. I did shake a little cinnamon & grated some nutmeg on top. Wish I'd read the reviews first, I would have added some almond extract as someone noted, bet that's a great addition. Also, I wonder if a little oatmeal would be a nice addition to the crust/topping (sub for maybe 1/2 c of the flour?).

This is a fantastic recipe!!! Not too sweet but delicious! I did take the suggestion of others and used butter instead of shortening.  Also, I live in Maine so we had picked 10lbs of fresh blueberries, I used 5 cups I stead of 4 (covered the bottom of the pan). These were delicious and didn't last long at all. I will be trying them using a sugar substitute and then later on some frozen blueberries (as I have frozen some of the blueberries from our last trip). Delicious!

These were wonderful. I prefer these to a pie because the amount of blueberries is perfect. Of course, the amount could be adjusted to taste. Fresh blueberries give it a slightly tart flavor, which I love. I used half shortening and half butter and the result was crispy and gave it texture.

This is very easy, quick fix.  It has no butter, so it's not very Fitch, but still was a crowd pleaser.  People kept going back for more.  The crunch is irresistible.

Just took out of the oven 5 minutes ago and my husband has already cut into it! He said this recipe is a keeper! 
 I also used half brown and half white sugar for the crust and topping, and used half butter/half shortening.  Also, I added a teapsoon of lemon juice and vanilla to crust mixture.  Added an extra tsp on starch and an extra cup of white sugar to the blueberries. In addition, I added one chopped McIntosh apple I had left over from making pies a couple of nights ago.  
I will be making this again!! Thank you for shaing this recipe!!

I followed a reviewer idea and used cold butter instead of shortening. I also added a bit more cinnamon and a few sprinkles of nutmeg to the fruit, I didn't have enough blueberries so I added enough thickly sliced fresh strawberries to make up the 4 cup amount. I also sprinkled a little bit of vanilla cinnamon sugar on top. It was delicious and I'll make this again and again. Thank you for the recipe.

Absolutely awesome! I made these exactly as directed except I used strawberries instead of blueberries. They came out amazing and they were super easy! I never thought I'd be able to find such a delicious dairy-free dessert.

This recipe is fantastic and just downright good.  It has a fresh fruity flavor that doesn't disappoint.  I substitute butter instead of shortening since I had it on hand.  Great easy recipe.  We even eat these for breakfast.

I really didn't enjoy these, unfortunately. Even with additional cinnamon, they lacked proper sweetness and saltiness and were quite one dimensional in flavor. I tried to salvage them with a butter/brown sugar/salt crumble top and it helped... Just don't understand the high rating on these.

made with frozen strawberry slices, and they were fantastic. pretty forgiving recipe, too--you can do a lot of things to it and it turns out great. i did not use enough strawberries for my liking, next time i will do a generous two layers of slices.

Turned out nice with a subtle flavor.  I used fresh cherries (had on hand), and added a tsp of vanilla to the crumb mixture.  To make it healthier I substituted with 1 cup of whole wheat flour in the crumb mix, and sprinkled some ground slow oats on top as well.  The squares held together very well when cooled.  If I could only find fresh "sour" cherries, I think this would really boost the flavor.

Wow, these were simple, easy, and fun to make. I did add the cinnamon and used sea salt. Used butter for my shortening, and as suggested by others, added a tsp of real vanilla to my beaten egg. I also added a tablespoon of minute tapioca to the sugar cornstarch mixture for the blueberries, just to be sure it set up well. It turned out better than we were anticipating. Will absolutely  try this with raspberries and cherries when they are fresh and in season, even fresh diced peaches sound good. Thanks for the simple easy recipe it is going to be a frequent request in my house.

These bars were GREAT! I would recommend subbing butter for the shortening, also I added vanilla, coconut and cinnamon to the crust. Used frozen blueberries, fresh strawberries and blackberries. Topped with whipped cream. Yum!

I love blueberries so anything made with them is wonderful as far as Iâ€™m concerned! I didnâ€™t change a thing, but next time Iâ€™m going to use 1 Â½ cups flour 1 Â½ cups oatmeal. This would make it more of a crumb topping and the base wouldnâ€™t be so dense! Itâ€™s a keeper.

Wow, these are sooooo good!  I don't know if this is an appropriate breakfast, but that's what I made this for.  I used butter instead of shortening, and did half brown, half white sugar only because I'm running low on white sugar.  When I make these again I'll do exactly the same thing with the butter sugar and maybe even use raspberries and blueberries for the filling.  Yum!

Only change was that I used butter instead of shortening. I didn't care for the crumb topping at all...it was bland. I found the blueberry filling to be dry.

I made these for a card party last night, and they were delicious.  Just make sure to cool them completely before cutting, or they will be a bit runny.  Everyone loved them and asked for the recipe.  Great use of blueberries.  My husband gobbled them up!

I am not a fan of berry desserts, but my bf LOVES these.  I made a half batch in an 8x8 pan, and had to make another the next day.  These are easy to make, and I will be trying with rasberries.  If you know someone who loves blueberries, give this a try, you will get raves.  He ate them warm from oven with vanilla ice cream.  These also freeze well...

These were delicious!  I too used part brown sugar and part white sugar.  Added in a dash of vanilla extract and used butter instead of shortening.  These were easy and everyone raved about the buttery flavor.

These were delicious!!  Definitely a new favorite.  I also used butter instead of shortening, otherwise followed the directions exactly.  I may try substituting some brown sugar for white next time, also adding a little vanilla extract as another person recommended.  Be sure to cool completely before attempting to cut.  Excellent recipe!!

These were great however I followed advice from other reviewers and I don't think I should have. I substituted half of white sugar for brown and it almost came out TOO crumbly. I LOVE crumble & "crisps" so that's why I did that but I think next time I will follow the recipe as stated. It overpowered the blueberries. GREAT RECIPE overall!

These are soooooo good. We have made them a number of times with all sorts of different berries. They are wonderful with vanilla ice cream! We did sub the shorting with butter, but other than that, we follow it exactly as written.

Like other posters, I used 1/2 c white and 1/2 c brown sugar, and I used butter.  I also replaced 1 cup of white flour with whole wheat flour to make these delicious bars.  I made them for yesterday's July 4 picnic and ate a couple of the leftovers for breakfast this morning.  They are not too sweet but very tasty.

These were good, but the berry/crumble ratio was way, way off... even for a crust girl like myself. I would have added about twice the berries if I'd known how light on the berries this recipe was. It ended being like a thick slice of crumble crust with a thin spread of berry preserves in the middle-- just not enough to have berries in the title.     Also, I would have liked this recipe to be a little healthier, but you can't have it all I guess.

I used the shortening (butter flavored Crisco) and used 1/2 white, 1/2 brown sugars, with fresh blueberries, and I felt this bar wasn't sweet enough. Maybe my craving for all things sweet threw this off, but I was a little disappointed in this.

This is a tasty recipe if made with butter.  Following other reviewers suggestions, I used half white and half brown sugar and added 1 tsp vanilla to a beaten egg.  A food processor makes preparation go quickly.  I divided off half the crumb mixture for the topping, leaving the other half in the food processor to which I added a rounded tablespoon of applesauce to help hold the base crumbs together.  This is very good with blueberries and fresh peaches would be excellent as well.  I will make this again using butter and probably increase the salt a little too.

Just as everyone else has said, this is extremely easy and really tasty. The first time I made this with blackberries. While it was good, I recommend trying to make it with berries without seeds if you are making this for a big audience. I enjoyed the blackberries but my boyfriend likes the blueberry one better.  One note - I didn't use shortening but replaced it with butter. I added a dash of nutmeg to mine as well. If you want the berries to be a tad sweeter, take a small amount of your berries, smash them up and add some sugar to them. Let them sit overnight in the fridge. The next day add this mixture to the rest of the berries and then follow the instructions. You can also add a touch of vanilla extract.   All in all - I don't know how you could be disappointed. This is one of my favorite things to make now!

I sure love these delicious bars!  It tastes like a slice of blueberry jam pie, with extra blueberry flavor and a nice crunch on top!  I couldn't wait until they were completely cool to have a bite.  I think they would be good warm with whipped cream or ice cream too.  I will definitely make these again!  I used frozen blueberries with great success!

Great recipe.  Not too sweet, which my husband loved.  I did, as another reviewer suggested, sub butter for the shortening and add a tsp of lemon and vanilla to the half of the crumbs that became the crust.  I also added a little water to help it stick together and prebaked for about 10 minutes before adding blueberry mixture.  Then I cut the baking time for the bars to about 40 minutes, just until the top crumbs began to brown.  Yum, it's disappearing fast!

My boyfriend raved over this.  He is pretty particular, but he asked me to make them again SOON.  I added some crushed walnuts to the topping, which was a little more crunch and it was very good!!

I didn't have enough blueberries, so I substitued 1 cup fresh cranberries for 1 cup of the blueberries.  Excellent result -- people went crazy over these!  The cranberries add a little tartness that mixes well with the blueberry's sweetness.  (I also used butter rather than shortening).

I used butter instead of shortening.  Everything else I kept the same.  It had great consistency, but the flavor was bland.  Needs a touch of salt, or maybe some citrus?  Will not waste the ingredients on it again.

All I can say is "Wow". I am not very good at cooking but I picked these bars to make just to challenge myself and they came out amazing! I read some of the reviews and used butter instead of shortening and it was a great choice. If you know how to follow directions then make these to impress your friends and family. They will be begging for more!

YUM!   only a few changes... DEFINATELY use butter over shortening.  added extra 2 tsp of constarch to ensure they stood on alone after cutting.  Added 1/4 tsp cinnamon and 1 1/2 tsp vanilla to dough for more flavor.   Rave reviews from everyone that tried them!! Definate keeper!

Perfect!  I mixed some milk and confectioners sugar for a glaze and drizzled it over the top.  I also halved the recipe for an 8x8 pan, used butter, and kept the whole egg (even though I halved the rest of the ingredients).  Turned out super- perfect summer dessert.

I was a bit skeptical because it seemed too crumbly when making it but after cooking it was good. My family loves them but I think they taste a bit too much like shortening so using butter might be a good idea. Using frozen berries didn't see to make any difference.

These are delicious! The only changes I made were to use 1/2 cup shortening and 1/2 cup butter, 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar for the dough. Just because I didn't have enough shortening and white sugar. I will make these again, with the same measurements I used this time.

Amazing! the whole family loved it. since I am not a big fan of super sweet stuff, i reduced the sugar to 3/4 and 1/3 cups- and it still turned out sweet enough. taking advice from the other comments i added nutmeg, 2 tsp of cinnamon and 2 tsp of lemon juice ... also added 1/2 cup more of blueberries. will def be making them again!

This is wonderful and easy too.  I ran out of white sugar to mix with the blueberries and had to use brown sugar.  I think it made it even better.  I used frozen blueberries that I didn't bother to thaw.  My husand ate most of this by himself.  My oldest sone who doesn't like blueberries loved this.  Serve warm with vanilla ice cream.

I really, really wish I would have used butter. They would be so much better. As is, the texture is great, but butter would have provided more flavor. I also think the filling could stand to be a bit sweeter. Four stars with butter. Three with shortening.

This recipe is amazing and delicious! I came across it on Smitten Kitchen's blog after she made it and raved about it too. I did use butter instead of shortening and added a tsp. of almond extract to the crust which was not needed at all and a tsp. was just a bit much.  Let cool before slicing. Make as stated (except use butter) and you won't be disappointed!  Not too sweet with a nice crunchy top.  Excellant!!

I have made these bars many times. I use wild huckleberries which add a little tart flavor. Used 1/2 of the white sugar and added 1/2 brown sugar. Used butter instead of shortening. Cooked about 5-10 minutes longer. Absolutely love these. Have been asked to bring to work many times.

I baked these for my fiance today as a surprise. He LOVED them! I used all butter instead of shortening and added two teaspoons of vanilla extract to the dough with a few sprinkles of key lime juice for moisture. I pre-baked the crust for 5 minutes before adding the berry mixture, but I don't think it was absolutely necessary. Since I was low on blueberries (I only had 3 cups), I added 1 cup of cherries and it tasted amazing. I added less sugar to the berry mixture than what the recipe called for and these bars tasted perfectly sweet. I will definitely make these again. They're so easy!

Not bad but I found that they weren't sweet enough.  I baked mine in a pan lined with greased foil and they came out great.  I added vanilla to the crumb mixture.

I love these bars! I always halve the recipe and almost always use frozen berries (due to the high cost of fresh berries here) and they turn out perfectly every time.

These squares were AWESOME! I used butter instead of shortening, and took the advice from one of the reviews to add a little water, so I added less than Â¼ cup water with a little vanilla and some lime juice to moisten up the dough, and it worked fantastically!  I also used frozen berries, straight from the freezer, and sprinkled a little sugar on top of the squares before baking.  I had nothing but rave reviews from the boys on the rig!!  They even came knocking on my shack door asking for more!!  I will definately be making these again!!!

I made this with butter and a combination of frozen blueberries and raspberries.  I ate three bars within a couple hours, three more for breakfast the next day, and two at lunch.  These are dangerous!  They were warm and just the right texture and a lot like pie without the hassle.  Thank you sooo much for sharing.  I'm an addict!

These are incredible!  I used frozen blueberries that I had picked last summer and didn't have to change the baking time.  The first batch disappeared immediately.  For the next batch, I used 1 cup whole wheat flour and two cups white to add more fiber and there was no change in taste or texture.  Great dessert that my kids love.

The topping has no taste and the bars are not sweet enough.  I tried fixing them by sprinkling some sugar on them, but that only helped slightly.  Definitely wouldn't make these again

Made exactaly as is except used frozen (I picked them fresh this past summer) blueberries.  Really good and not too many ingriedents.  I did have to keep it in the fridge because the berries oozed out when cut warm.  Maybe next time I'll sprinkle the cornstarch on the crust layer, before I add the blueberries. Will make again!  :)

I added a little extra sugar and I added cinnamon and we still didn't care for this.  My kids wouldn't eat it and I didn't really like it... kinda bland.  I ended up throwing half of it away.

FANTASTIC! This recipe is amazing.  I used room temperature margarine and I didn't find the base too crumbly at all. Also I added the zest of a lemon to the base to give it some zing. My blueberries were on the tart side so I increased the sugar by 1/8 cup and it worked out.  This is my new absolute favourite recipe.

Oh man these are so good!!!  I did use butter instead of shortening as that's what we had around.  My house smells good, the kids LOVE them and it's fruit, so it's healthy, right?  These are divine!!!

This was phenomenal!!! I did alter it slightly after reading the other reviews, and did 1/2C. Sugar 1/2 C lite brown sugar, and also added 1tsp of vanilla extract to the egg before adding in . I also used half shortening and half butter. It turned out perfect!!! DELICIOUS!!!

Easy to make, tasted okay.  The blueberry middle rocks (I used fresh blueberries), but the "crumb" part is tasteless (even though I used butter).  These were average in my opinion, and I probably won't make them again.

One word: YUMMY!!! I had a bit of free time yesterday so I decided to test out this recipe, "the best lemon bars", and "love the mama lemon bars".  Today was taste-test day and everyone absolutely adored these bars!  I did add a pinch of salt and lemon zest to the dough, but left out the baking powder (just ran out earlier that day) and they turned out phenomenally well.  Thanks for the recipe!  This one's a keeper for sure!

I use blackberries, blueberries, peaches or fresh cherries (depends on my mood) For me FRESH berries/fruit is a must, but I have used frozen when others are out of season. I use light butter (butter makes this much better then shortening), whole wheat flour, 1 cup splenda and 1/2 cup brownsugar to mix with fruit. I added 3 tbsp's milk and 1 extra yoke to crumb mixture to add MUCH needed moisture. I added 1 tsp cinnamon and 1/4 tsp nutmeg to mixture. I also add 1 tbsp lemon juice to berries. Only took 38 minutes to bake!There is never any left when I make these!

To ensure that I wouldn't end up with a dry crust (after reading all the reviews) I made quite a bit of adjustments which resulted in a dough that wasnt crumbly, but very moist.  I figured that it wouldn't need all 45 minutes, so I baked it a little less and it came out great.  It had a great buttery taste (dont use shortening!) which worked so well with the fresh blueberries..not to mention the crumb topping which might have been the best part. I served it warm with whipped cream and a few blueberries sprinkled over it.. it would have been great with vanilla ice cream too.

I actually loved this recipe but I did make some changes. I used 1 cup of light brown sugar in the crust. I added 2 tsp of cinnamon, 1 tsp of ginger and 1/4 tsp of allspice, as suggested by another viewer. I also took the advise and used half butter and half shortening, along with an extra egg yolk due to complaints of dryness. I value others' opinions and in this case I was happy that I did because it came out wonderful!! These bars were so very good, as they cool and set up, the flavors intensify and they get even better!!

Bars tasted like shortening.  Next time maybe butter or at least butter crisco could be used?  Maybe they would taste better then.

These bars were delicious.  Everyone loved them.  I used half brown sugar and half sugar because I was just about out of white sugar.  I also used a full teaspoon of cinnamon.  I think the next time I make this I'll add some nuts to the top.  It was very, very good.  This recipe definitely is a keeper.  Thanks for sharing!!

WOW! These are amazing! You can't go wrong making these bars. I read the previous reviews about the butter and I tried 1/2 c. butter and 1/2 c. Crisco and they came out perfect. I also used 1/2 brown and 1/2 white on the 1 c. of sugar for the crust. Hubby and kids raved about these bars. Enjoy!

This is a wonderful recipe! I sent my husband to the store for vanilla ice cream in anticipation of the finished bars, but once I tasted the bars by themselves, it was obvious that they didn't need to be accompanied by ice cream to make them more delicious; these are wonderful just as is. The flavor of the blueberries really comes through in this recipe, and they are not overly sweet. I did use butter instead of shortening as some other reviewers suggested, also used a full teaspoon of cinnamon, and next time I'll substitute brown sugar and add some chopped, toasted pecans. It will be fun to try this recipe with other berries as well. Thank you for this wonderful recipe!

these are very very good but they need a little salt to rbing out the crumb flavor more. also some chopped nuts in the topping (almonds) would be really good.

This recipe is awesome. However, I did make a few modifications after I made the first batch (the topping seemed too crumbly).  After I pressed half of the  dough into the pan, I added 2 T. of butter,another pinch or two of cinnamon and cut it into the remaining dough before sprinkling on top.  That made the topping stay on better...Great Recipe

I made a few changes in this recipe but still kept it basically the same. I halved this but used an entire egg which made the crust/crumb stick together better. I used brown sugar instead of white, butter instead of shortening (yuck), used half WW flour and half regular flour, and substituted frozen raspberries and black raspberries for the blueberries. All the girls at work and my family enjoyed this. It was very much like a thick, firm cobbler. The cinnamon is a must.

These are good.  Easy to make.  Even better with some vanilla ice cream.  The flavors are simple and pure.  The fruit comes through nicely.  Nothing extravagent.  The only thing i did different is that i ran out of blueberries so i halved the recipe with strawberries.  I spread blueberry on one half and strawberries on the other. Tasted good. Not too sweet.  Wasnt able to cut into bars, too crumbly.

These are very good but...  will make a few changes next time. As is, it's much better served with ice cream.  I used butter as recommended by others. Not terribly sweet therefore I think brown sugar would change the blandness that a lot of reviewers were talking about. If you are not into sweet, then as is - is perfect.  Be sure to press the dough into the bottom of the pan for a firm base. A wonderful hint I picked up from somewhere(don't remember where) is to use a grate with frozen butter and then rub into your flour. Soooo much easier than cutting in.  Will certainly make again and I want to try with other fruit.

Cheap and easy - yes.  Delicious? Hardly.  The blueberry/sugar mix does well, but the crust needs quite a bit of work.  This dessert comes out bland and uninspiring.  I tried upping the cinnamon and adding vanilla - eh so so.  Though i haven't tried it, adding pecans might not be a bad thought.  After trying twice, I'm shelving this one.

Don't get me wrong--these were good enough, and we ate them all--but they didn't really excite me all that much and I doubt I would make them again.  Perhaps a different fruit would be better.

Excellent!  I used blackberries because that's what I had, and therefore doubled the sugar on the berries.  Blueberries would be even better (no big seeds)!  Thanks!

super easy to make!  I halved the recipe and used an 8x8 pan, substituted butter for the shortening, and used fresh bkuberries.  Do use the cinnamon, it really makes the crust.

Excellent!  I used frozen berries and it was just fine.  Just make sure the sugar is evenly distributed over the berries.  I used butter in place of the shortening and some lemon zest mixed with the berries and sugar. Great with a scoop of vanilla ice cream!

These were OK, but I made them with the shortening and not butter like others had suggested.  I'm sure they would have been better with butter.

Great recipe! Made this for the first time when friends were coming over for dinner - normally I like to try a recipe first before serving it to guests - but this one was so easy it was mistake proof. I used the optional salt and about 3/4 tsp. cinnamon and I added some vanilla to the berry mixture. Served it with vanilla bean ice cream - everyone loved it! Thanks!

This was very easy, I just threw the crust mixture into my food processor, voila, it was done in no time.  But, my family was not very crazy about it, it needs something, but I can't figure out what.  I used cinnamon, and even added some butter extract to crust, but still wasn't great.

I made this recipe for a 4th of July party and had several people ask me for the recipe.  They were a big hit!!  I used the optional cinnamon and actually did frozen blueberries.  The bars were not dry at all, in fact, I think next time I will refrigerate the leftover bars, because they became a little gooey after the second day.

This was a very easy and tasty recipe.  I added chopped pecans as part of the topping.  I would add some thinned white icing the next time I make it.  I have to bring a dessrt for dinner this Saturday night.  Guess what I am bringing?   Thanks for a great recipe.

A tad blander than I would have liked, but maybe because I didn't add any cinnamon.  Otherwise a great way to use blueberries (a great source of antioxidants!).  Note: I used frozen blueberries with no problems, and replaced half the flour with whole wheat flour.

I just made these and they turned out great!  My son just loves them.  I have to say it was a little tedious to make the crumb crust/topping, but well worth it.  It is also great with vanilla ice cream.

I've had some really bad luck lately with stuff that I've cooked, but I have to say that these were very good. I used huckleberries instead of blueberries, which I had in the freezer (a gift from a very generous friend!) I wasn't sure if I would like these, but they are great! My husband wants me to make this dessert again as a crumble, so this is definitely going to be on my regular recipe rotation. Thanks for sharing the recipe for these yummy-in-the-tummy bars!

These bars were wonderful!  We needed to get rid of our blueberries before they got all yucky and this did the trick.  I kind of over-cooked them though... the edges were hard.  Next time, I'll have to keep track of the time!  Thanks for the recipe.  It's definitely worth making again.

Terriffic cookies that are soooo easy.  I like them since I do a lot of big batch cookies.  I use frozen berries in the winter.  Only word of warning. . .  they are crumbly!

I made it on a smaller scale and it was great. I bought too many blueberries so this was a great way to use them. I actually didnâ€™t have cornstarch but I used bisquick since it didnâ€™t need a lot of it and it tasted great not too sweet or tart.

Very good! I put more than a pinch of cinnamon. I found that it tastes delicious with a little bit of lemon juice for a fresh zing. Try using it with both strawberries and blueberries.

Love this recipe. I used butter instead and less than 1/2 c in berries.  Next time, i will bake the crust first for some extra crunch. 
 Super easy and forgiving recipe for dessert bar.

Oh I will definitely make this again! I used butter instead of crisco, and 1/2 white sugar, 1/2 brown sugar. Also a touch of vanilla, cinnamon and water mixed in with the egg. I should have tried the original recipe, because I'm sure it was just as good. I just went other suggestions.

I totally messed up on this, adding all the dough to the bottom of the pan, and also forgot to add the egg.

I added cardamom to this, and also had to add meringue powder to the dough last minute to replace the egg. It turned out altogether to be fantastic, though!

Because I added all the dough to the bottom, I mixed up more dough (also with like a half tsp of meringue powder and several generous shakes of cardamom with the cinnamon). I started the extra dough with 1/2 cup of flour, if that helps anyone else. Totally amazing, as they set up perfectly, even with my mistakes and that cardamom addition I would definitely add to this!

We figure it would go wonderful with other fruits too. Everyone in my house loved them, my eldest warming one up to add Pierreâ€™s French Vanilla ice cream to it.  It barely made it to the second day in my house. 

Finally, based on other reviews here, I mixed half white sugar with a mix of dark and brown sugars to make the full cup of sugar, and added the same (halved) proportions of those for the additional dough I needed to quickly put together for the top. I also had to bake it a bit longer, too, broiling it a little at the end to help it brown up properly.

Sorry I ended up changing it so much, but I will refer to this recipe time and again, always adding cardamom to it.

These bars are the best ever - so delicious and moist without falling apart. This recipe is one of the few without oatmeal. I have made these bars exactly as instructed and also substituted sugar for monkfruit with delicious results. Every time I bring these bars to an event, everyone wants the recipe. This is my all-time favorite bar recipe.

I followed the directions exactly as their listed, and while the final product looks quite beautiful, itâ€™s extremely sweet!! The crust could use 1/2 the amount of sugar that it calls for. Of course, we still gobbled it down and when accompanied by a good cup of coffee, some of the sweetness is toned down. It was easy enough

i think i messed up the crumb part i just used my hands to mix dough and i think i over did it.. i put 1 cup of butter and 1 extra large egg and 3 cups of flour  and sugar (i am diabetic so i used tagulose but suppose to be same as sugar cooking and baking wise),, i did beat the egg before i put it in the dry mix.. but it came out moist but i thought the butter was maybe too soft by the time i mixed it I thought it was suppose to be soft.after i baked it, it looked good but the dough was never crumbly like the pic.. and i let it get too brown but i usually like it a dark tan color ..anyway i will try it again since it tasted ok but texture could have been better plus the blueberries tasted great..

These were perfect, I followed the suggestions of other reviews and did 50/50 white sugar and light brown sugar. I added the salt, cinnamon and vanilla.  Plus I used a combination of 1 stick of butter and 1/2 cup of avocado oil. 
I really liked that these were not too sweet, full of blueberry flavor and held together nicely.
Oh I also didn't have cornstarch so I used 1 1/2 tbsp of flour with the sugar in the blueberries. Worked like a charm not runny at all without the lumps or taste of flour.  This was a super easy recipe that can be made into anything extra that you want it to be.

Used butter. Added  the zest of a small lemon to the crumb mixture and left out the cinnamon. Used 6 cups fruit - blueberry/ blackberry mixture with 2 Tbsp cornstarch.  Baked almost 55 minutes. DELISH! Like pie in a square!

Easy and tasty! My four and a half year-old even "helped". They were a big hit when I brought them for contribution to Christmas Eve dinner!

I accidentally used half the sugar called for in the dough! It's noticeable but still quite good. I might keep it that way for the calorie save :)   I used someone's suggestion to try to make it less "crumbly" but I still wound up with someone more like a cobbler than a finger food. I tried to post a photo but I guess my photos aren't big enough. I'm not sure what is up with that

BIG YUCK!!!!!

Only recipe that I would give a 0 if I could what a waste of good berries on a dismal and tasteless recipe.  Made it 3 different times with changes from the tips from other users and threw them away every time.

This was a favorite in my house! Everyone especially loved the crumbs on top. I like that you can decide how many crumbs you would like and thus alter the recipe a tad. I will be making this again.

This was delicious!  Instead of blueberries, I used a mixture of strawberries and raspberries.  Added the salt and cinnamon to the dry mix (we love cinnamon so probably about 1 Â½ tsp).  As others suggested, I used butter instead of shortening.  A big hit!

The blueberry filling hasn't really set up after cooling the bars so I'll use more cornstarch next time but everything is quite tasty. I agree that it's a fine base that's easily tweaked.

I followed other cooks' suggestions and used butter instead of shortening, and half brown sugar/half white sugar. I did add the cinnamon and salt. Next time I will try adding some lemon zest to the blueberry filling to make that part stand out more from the crust. Overall my family and I loved this recipe, and I will definitely make it again!

Made this as recipe indicated; not overly sweet but good.  I split the crumb mixture 50/50 top and bottom but the topping does seem a bit "dry" when you eat it.  Next time I might put more topping on the bottom (60/40); I baked it 45 min. exactly and I think longer might dry it out too much.

This held up really well even with gluten free, Cup for Cup flour. My whole family loved it - even my picky kids who never like anything. Great recipe.

These bars were easy to make and tasted great however they were VERY messy. When I went to cut them into bars to serve the blueberry layer oozed out. I ended up serving them in muffin wrappers because they wouldn't keep their shape

I liked this.  I put in cinnamon, and nutmeg.  And substituted the brown sugar, cause that's how I roll.  It was yummy and the family enjoyed it with ice cream.

Well, I wasn't intending to make changes, but then this happened. I'm wondering why the crumbs are more like paste, and I'm smearing the mixture in the bottom of the pan, and it's not going very far, and I think, well, I guess I'm gonna have to make another whole batch of "crumbs" for the top. So I get out the flour and BOOM I realize I had forgotten the flour. Ha! So I put the whole schmear back into the food processor, this time with the flour, and I start to pulse and blend. 

But nothing's happening. There's the sound of whirring, but the mixture is just laying there like a pile of glop with flour on top. I turn it off, turn it on, unplug it, shake it--I can't figure it out. In frustration, I lean back against the countertop--and hey, what do you know, right next to my elbow is the blade for the processor. 

So now I'm cooking (baking) with gas. I dump the glop and flour out, install the blade, resubmit the glopular substance into the processor, and NOW we're getting some crumb action.

Anyway, after all this, it turned out lovely and I will make it again and again with my South Haven, MI blueberries.

Thanks for listening.

Perfect recipe as written!  My berries were a little on the sour side, and the amount of sugar in the recipe was perfect to offset the sourness.  Making again in the near future!

Used butter instead of shortening. Donâ€™t cook at a lower temp or the topping wonâ€™t brown. Add a little more sugar to the blueberry ( maybe 1/4 c more) I think I may do as another reviewer did next time and use half brown sugar and half white sugar and add a little vanilla. Just seemed a teensy bit bland the way it is. Not bad at all though!

I used 1 cup of butter instead of shortening. Five stars, absolutely!
More recently, I used shortening as described in the recipe.  Tarty and so crumbly crisp. Still five stars!

I did not care for this recipe. The crust was bland, and the blueberry filling was not sweet at all. In fact, no part of this dessert was sweet - just dry and kind of sour. I will not make this recipe again.

The taste is spot on, however mine was very moist, not like a bar at all.  I think I will bake the bottom crust first and then use less berries next time.

These are so good, I have made them about 4-5 times and can't stop eating them every time. Last time, I didn't have enough fresh blueberries so used a half a bag of frozen mixed berries (didn't thaw) and they came out great and looked pretty with the raspberries mixed in.  Love this recipe.  Not too sweet.

There's nothing actually wrong with this receipt. It came out just like the photos. The texture was good. Baking time was about right. The problem was that it didn't have a lot of flavor. I used fresh supermarket blueberries. Maybe that was the problem. But isn't that what most people use? I felt the same way after making Chef John's Blueberry Clafuiti. Both will get eaten. Just don't expect a lot of compliments.  Going forward, I'll stick with a good cobbler, crisp, or pie.

I used 2 sticks of butter in place of the shortening and frozen blueberries instead of fresh.. I took about 20 minutes longer to bake, but sooo good. I made them in the evening and then reheated the whole pan the next morning for a warm, breakfast treat.

I like blueberries when they are fresh. In a dish I am not that fond of them, but I made the recipe because I do like their color. It turns out this cookie is not my personal favorite, however my guests liked it.

Absolutely delicious! And easy! I followed the recipe almost exactly as-is. I added just a touch more sugar (literally, not even a 1/4 cup more) after seeing a couple people suggest that, but was running low on butter (I know, I couldn't believe it either) so only used shortening. I also used more [fresh] blueberries (maybe an extra 1/2 cup?) and an extra dash of cinnamon but I wanted a good amount of berry and love my cinnamon!  ***I did have to bake it an additional 10-15 minutes to make the top golden.*** It turned out awesome - my husband and I actually like that it wasn't super-sweet, which makes it easier to eat as a breakfast coffeecake-type dish. It did feel like there was something missing, and I thought perhaps next time I may add more cornstarch and sugar to the blueberries to give them a different consistency. I left it sitting (covered, of course) at room temperature on the counter and sneaked a bite the next day - OMG IT WAS EVEN BETTER! I don't know if it was due to it sitting or being room temperature instead of hot out of the oven, but the consistency of the blueberries is now what I was aiming for that first night. I will definitely be making this again (perhaps this weekend?!) and do want to experiment with other berries and frozen berries.

I used melted/warmed butter instead of shortening, it came out fine.  When I make again, I will used a slotted spoon to scoop out the blueberries into the pan.  There was some sugar that didn't stick to the blueberries, so one or 2  squares  got a sugar rush when I poured! :)

I don't understand how some found this too dry, not sweet enough, or not crispy on top.  I did sub the butter for Crisco and mixed brown and white sugars as many suggested.  Otherwise, I made it as written except for the blueberries.  My entire reason for searching out this recipe was the discovery of a LOT of frozen blueberries when I cleaned out the freezer.  They were old and icy, but after rinsing and patting dry, I threw them in frozen and they were still delicious in this recipe!  I was using a dark pan, so I baked it at 350 degrees, but the 45 minutes suggested was the perfect duration.

Since i wanted to keep low sugar I used blueberries and mix  Smuckers Simply Fruit (blueberry) with the berries for the center.  Loved this recipe and will make next time with almond flour so I can have (MORE) of it.  Great for kids since with this simple change very low sugar.

4 Stars only because  second upgraded batch was better with upgrades from other reviewers implemented.

Add Vanilla to taste to flour mixture.
Add Lemon Zest  to Blueberries 
Replace 1/2 Cup of white sugar with packed Brown Sugar

I made 2 pans of this in 2 days.  1st time I made it, I thought the bars were a bit thin and slightly dry.  2nd time,  I cut the entire recipe in half but added 2 additional cups of berries (fresh blueberries, raspberries, blackberries).  I used brown sugar in the crust instead of white sugar and used butter instead of shortening.  Put it in 8x8 pan and cooked 35 minutes.  It was perfect and the additional fruit made it so moist.  Topped with a homemade whipped topping.  My friends raved over it.

As per comments, replaced sugar for half white and half brown sugar in the dough/crumb;added one teaspoon of cinnamon and a quarter teaspoon nutmeg in the dough/crumb, used fresh berries but made sure to squish them in a bit to get as much blueberries as possible without squishing the berries themselves; added an extra teaspoon of cornstarch. Turned out amazing. Next time will need to add some lemon juice to the berry mixture to make the blueberries pop, but otherwise perfect. You can also add vanilla to the egg before adding to the dough/crumb if you want more flavour.

This recipe is delicious!  I made it with fresh blueberries that I picked the day before.  I followed the recipe exactly and brought it in to work.  Everyone raved about it.  The entire pan was gone in just a few minutes.  There is absolutely no need to change a thing! Guaranteed I will be making this again and again.

Excellent! This is a lighter alternative to a coffee cake, and my husband loved it! I have made this twice now -  The first time I made the crust with half shortening and half butter,  and the second I used all butter.  We liked the all butter crust better.  I did add just a bit more sugar to help with some tart berries. Ended up baking about 50 minutes for a 13 x 9 pan  in order to get it lightly browned.

This is a really great recipe, I made a few changes I first cut the recipe in half and then  I did what others suggested and changed the shortening for butter (becel margarine lol). I also used 2/3 of the crumble to the bottom crust and then mixed roughly another 1/4 cup of butter, 1/3 brown sugar ,1/3 of rolled oats to the left over crumble, as for the blueberries I added a table spoon of corn starch, 2 1/2 cups blueberries, 1/2 cup sugar and half of a lemon juiced in.

I made this except instead of shortening I used butter. My husband said omg 5 stars do not loose this recipe.  I do not often get such rave reviews so a 5 from him is equal to a 9 or 10 I'd say.

I made a lot of changes and it was still amazing, which just shows that this recipe is pretty hard to mess up. I didn't have any shortening , so I used 1/2 cup of butter and 1/2 cup of coconut oil for the crust. I also replaced half the sugar in the crust with brown sugar. I mixed that up in a food processor (kind of like you do with scone batter) -- I didn't leave it out on purpose, but I totally forgot the egg! I used frozen blueberries for the filling. I baked it in two 8x8 pans for 40 minutes. I was a little low on crust for the topping, so I put what I had back in the food processor with about 1/4 cup of oatmeal and a little sugar, to make it more like a crumb topping. It was very sweet!

I made a couple of changes.  Used half white and half brown  sugar for the crumbles, 1 tsp vanilla and used butter not shortening.  I really liked it and so did my guests.  Next time I will add more blueberries to the filling.  But overall a great recipe.

Made it, used butter not shortening, as this crust is a flaky butter crust, same you would use for butter tart squares...tastes better than shortening and added an extra 1/2 cup of blueberries, when i put on top of bottom crust, looked too empty so sprinkled another 1/2 cup of blueberries on top...its looks awesome, cant wait to taste it....took 15 minutes to put together

Good, not too sweet.  My family agreed that it would be better to use butter instead of crisco.

I made the changes from others' reviews: using 1/2 white sugar and 1/2 brown sugar, adding tsp of cinnamon and vanilla to the egg.  I baked it in two pie plates instead of one 9x13 pan and this way I had two desserts!

Added grated zest from half a lemon along with juice to berry mixture. Also used butter instead of shortening in crumb mixture and it still tasted like it needed a bit of something else. Perhaps, ground almonds and oatmeal. Will try a different bar recipe next time.

AMAZING! I followed the suggestions, 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup light brown sugar, butter and a splash of vanilla! I also added about a hand full of oats just because i like them :) as for the blue berries I used about 41/2 cups and 1 cup of sugar with about 2 tablespoons of lemon juice. Topped the whole thing with lemon buttercream icing when it was still hot. Love love love!!!

Very good!  Used an 8 X 8 inch pan and reduced all of the ingredients by half except for the egg and cornstarch; used a pinch of salt and a 1/4 tsp. of cinnamon.  Substituted softened butter for the shortening; brown sugar for 1/2 of the sugar for the dough; and rolled oats for 1/3 of the flour.  Added 1/2 tsp. vanilla and the zest of 1/2 lemon to the dough mixture; added the juice of 1/2 lemon to the berries along with an extra 2 Tbs. of sugar to the berries.  Next time will add a total of an extra 3 Tbs. of sugar to the berries.  Like my berries more sweet than tart.  Used 1 cup each of fresh blueberries and blackberries because that's what I had on hand.  Came out perfect; not too sweet or tart.  Reduced oven temperature to 350 degrees because I used a glass pan and baked 45 minutes.  Yum!  Considered topping with some powdered sugar but it didn't need it.  Didn't have any ice cream so ate plain right out of the pan.  Will try with some whipped cream next.  Will definitely make again.  5/4/17 update:  Made again today with raspberries and an extra 3 Tbs. of sugar.  Good, but not the masterpiece the blueberry/blackberry combo was.  They were out of this world.

I substituted fresh red raspberries for blueberries, left out the cinnamon, and used butter instead of shortening. I also sprinkled a little bit of white sugar on top before I cooked it. As others stated, you could use just about any berry you'd like to. Really, really good.

Lovely, moist and quick. Looks fabulous too (my own anyway), but this recipe is excellent although I only ever use half as much sugar. I must have made it close to twenty times now- whenever unexpected guests turn up and I need to pull out all the stops. My boys make a song and a dance about it, and sometimes top it with some cream or custard!

I like that these can be picked up and eaten like a cookie instead of requiring a fork.  I also like that there isn't any oatmeal in the crumble like every other recipe out there.  The first time I made these I followed the recipe with all the common adjustments that other reviewers have been making: butter instead of shortening, half brown sugar, half white, and adding 1 tsp of vanilla and 1 tsp of cinnamon to the crust/crumble.  I can't imagine how bland it would have been without these changes.  Keep in mind that most people are used to a higher ratio of sugar with the blueberries, so you may want to double (at least) if you're one of those people.  I made some improvements the second time.  I used almond flavoring instead of vanilla, added 1/2 cup of sliced almonds to the topping and mixed the blueberries with 12 oz of blueberry preserves instead of with sugar.  My tasters agreed that this was better.  I also tried using all brown sugar, but I thought it made the base/crumble too dense.

These are very good and easy. I used 1/2 white, 1/2 brown sugar in the crust. Added 1/2 teaspoon vanilla and a 1/4 teaspoon almond extract to the egg.  Also used butter instead of shortening. Very good flavor. I used about three cups of blueberries because two didn't look like enough. So it is more of a plate and fork dessert than a bar, but very good. Next time I will add less blueberries and see if they are more "bar like".

I made this to take on a family weekend and it was a great hit. I used lard since I did not have "shortening" and it was delicious. I cut into bars. I kept them on the table in a covered container for all to enjoy anytime - day or night!

I loved this recipe it was perfect just the way it was. I did not change anything.  I've made it several times and everyone raved about it. I don't understand the comment about not enough sugar I thought it was plenty sweet! Will make again and again.  I have also passed the recipe along to friends and family who loved it!

I have made this four times in the past two weeks. I have tried shortening an butter and both turned out well. The last one I made I used fresh peaches that I peeled an diced. It was delicious as well. I have used fresh and frozen blueberries, but with the frozen I did cook longer as someone else had stated. I do use a little extra sugar with the fruit. I plan on making this again

Not sure what I did wrong. I followed the recipe, only changing the sugar ration to half brown, half white. For some reason, these were very gooey. Not a huge issue, we can just spoon them out, more like a cobbler. Also, I felt they were not sweet enough.

This is a super easy and delicious dessert. I followed the suggestions of subbing some brown sugar for white, used all (good quality salted) butter, added some vanilla to the crumble mixture...a 5-star recipe with those modifications. Last time I tried sprinkling milk chocolate chips atop the crumble over half the 9x13 prior to baking, and I prefer the ones with the c.chips. I do think it looks more presentable using the reviewer's suggestion to gather the remaining dough into balls then gently/slightly crumble it atop the fruit layer so there are slightly bigger chunks of crumble topping and the blueberries show through nicely. I'll be using this recipe over and over, thanks for sharing it!

Only gave this 4 stars because I made a couple of changes.  I don't like crisco so I used butter.  Used half & half sugar/brown sugar.  Had 1 frozen bag blueberries & 1 frozen bag of cherries both half gone.  Rinsed off & drained ice crystals and used both.  Outstanding.  No other change other than baking bottom crust for 5 minutes first.  Happy I found this recipe.

I was not a fan of these at all. The crust and crumble were incredibly bland and soggy. The blueberry layer needed more sugar and was too tart.

Wonderful! The hit of the birthday party. Just a tip:  pour blueberries on top of crust and sprinkle sugar mixture on top of berries. You will get a more uniform distribution.  Yum!

I made these as my occasional Monday-morning treat for my office. They were a major hit ... despite the fact that I realized --  long after the bars had been cut and boxed -- that I had left the called-for egg out of the crumb-crust mix. The result of my error was a crust that was VERY crumby ... but still tasty. I think the berries served to  moisten what might, otherwise have been an unpalatably dry crust.

I CANNOT recommend leaving the egg out of the crust mix, but did realize that my creation did make for a very successful VEGAN rendition!

Some notes: other than leaving out the egg, I followed the recipe pretty closely.  I used the called-for amount of white sugar (and found the bars entirely sweet enough), used butter rather than shortening, and did not add the cinnamon.

I followed reviews and made following changes:  1) halved recipe for the 2 of us.   2) used half ww pastry flour.  3) added 1 tsp vanilla  4) added zest of 1 lemon and 1.5 tbsp fresh lemon juice.    5). Used half light brown sugar.  6) used 1 tsp cinnamon.    Of course, used butter instead of shortening.  With these changes it was good, but I still thought the crust part was ok.   Definitely does not need more sugar!  I would make again, but not my favorite way to use up blueberries.

I've never made a blueberry bar or crumble before this was my first attempt they came out perfect and tasted really good I did you cinnamon just a pinch but I thought they could buy him a little bit more moisture so I'm not sure if it was my flour because I did not use a good flour it was a storebrand flour

I modified this recipe like so many others, replacing a half cup of granulated sugar with a half cup of brown sugar. I also used butter instead of lard and added a teaspoon of vanilla with the egg. But I found it much too sweet. If I make this again, I will use a quarter cup of granulated sugar for the blueberries and a quarter cup of granulated sugar in the batter.

My husband and I thought these were really good, though I did make some of the recommended adjustments.  

I replaced 1/2 C  of the white sugar with brown,
Extra blueberries (we had frozen) about 3/4 C,
Extra corn starch, about 1 tsp,
Extra sugar in the blueberry mixture, about 1/4 C,
4 packets of true lemon in the blueberry mixture.

I also mixed a little powdered sugar with some milk for a glaze, after they had cooled a bit.  

We didn't wait for them to cool completely.  We used extra berries, so there was a nice thick layer.  Though, I can see the original amount being better for cutting these into actual bars, for say a party.  They would be less messy, especially if you expect guests to use their fingers to eat them.  All in all, we like this recipe and I have saved it as a favorite.  I'd like to try it again with some fresh strawberries.

I made for my bible class and they were a big hit! I halved the recipe, used frozen blueberries, and used butter instead. It is a very easy recipe to follow and I did end up baking the bars the full 45 minutes. I can't wait to bake these tasty bars again!

I made these and they were delicious. I'm in the process of making my second pan right now since they are in high demand in my house now. This trumps the house peach cobbler. Thanks for a great recipe!!!!

The only change I made was to use butter in place of the shortening and we added oats to the topping because we made the bottom too thick.  It turned out great and cut perfect bars. I'm going to make it with raspberries next for Valentines sooo yummy.

I followed the directions except for using butter instead of shortening. We found it dry with not a lot of flavor, but it has potential. Next time I'll follow the suggestions and use half brown sugar and a bit more liquid.

These bars are a huge hit, but I did make some changes. First, like other reviewers, I used 1 cup of butter instead of shortening. I also add more cinnamon than is called for in the recipe, and add some nutmeg to it too. I also add about a teaspoon of vanilla extract to the batter. I also just used the frozen mixed berries since I had a huge bag of them from Costco, and it was amazing. I served them at Thanksgiving and there were no leftovers.

This has potential, but needs a LOT of tweaking.

Dry, burnt, flavorless crust/top....I don't know where to start.  It could be good with ice cream, as mentioned in other comments.

I made this with strawberries. Everyone loved them-- not enough to remember them or ask for them again. But they were universally loved by a diverse group of picky eaters.

I made this recipe for a party and it was a Big Hit!
After reading the most helpful positive and negative reviews by MEL06010 and Meagan621, I made a few changes. 
I used frozen wild Maine blueberries (no not thaw), which are small and quite tart, so instead of 1 cup of white sugar I used 3/4 cup white + 3/4 cup brown sugars, and 1 teaspoon of cinnamon instead of a pinch. Also, I substituted real butter for the shortening and added 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract in with the egg.
The flavors added by using brown sugar, butter, vanilla and more cinnamon boosted this reciped to 5+ stars!

So popular with hubby and kids... I made this 2x this week.  The first time I used blueberries and butter-flavored Crisco.  The second time strawberries and Butter.  REALLY, so good either way.  We've had the bars for dessert with ice cream and for breakfast.  Other adjustments I've made is to substitute some brown sugar for reg. sugar; and organic white whole wheat flour for reg. flour.  IAC There's just one bar left so I'll probably make it again tomorrow.  Maybe apples this time.  *Really a good, easy and versatile recipe that even my picky eating boy likes. Recommend.*

Came out delicious!!! 
I added raspberries and it was mind blowing.
I also cut the sugar in half. I don't like my treats too sweet.

Caution!! 
If you eat it hot with a scoop of icecream there is an extremely high risk you will eat the entire pan....by yourself....in one sitting.....just a heads up.

These are so easy and delicious!!! I followed the directions exactly , except for using butter rather than shortening. I had to bake it longer, but that could be due to the altitude in Denver? I felt there was plenty of sugar, but I suppose it depends on how tart your blueberries are. Regardless, these are crazy delicious and I can't wait to try making them with other kinds of fruit.

This is a very good recipe, however I made the following changes:   1) I used half whole wheat flour  and half  all purpose flour;  2) I used half brown sugar and half white sugar;  3) I used butter instead of shortening;  4) I added 1 tsp of vanilla.  And next time, I just may add oats to the dough for the top crumble layer.  Thanks for the recipe!

My kids and husband have been bugging me to make a dessert, so I made this finally!  I didn't try it myself (I eat only Paleo) but they all gave it 5 stars for sure :)  I was short on blueberries so I did half strawberries as well.  Seemed to work out great!  Also followed some of the reviews and I did half shortening and half butter for more flavor in the crust.  Nice recipe, well received!

I got this recipe from the AR magazine.  I like trying the magazine recipes because I know the AR test kitchen has made them.  While the blueberry filling was good, the crust was bland.  I would not make this again as written.  Maybe with butter, or oats.

Basic ingredients make this an easy recipe and it is a bonus that is is sooooo delicious! I did use butter, because that's what I had.  I used 2 cups blueberries and 2 cups strawberries.  Fantastic!!!  Great with a little whipped topping or vanilla ice cream.

If you love blueberries, you'll love this recipe.  It uses a lot of blueberries, so make sure you make this recipe when they're in season.  You need a fairly large amount of them.

It was good with some vanilla ice cream, without the ice cream or was a little devoid of flavor. It was even better heated up with ice cream.

I also used butter instead of shortening and it turned out great - no complaints about flavor.  I cut the recipe in half and used an 8x8 glass baking dish.  I used fresh blueberries since they were in season and added a pinch of cinnamon and nutmeg to the corn starch mixture for extra flavor.  Also, I added a couple of tablespoons of brown sugar and another pinch of cinnamon and nutmeg to the topping to differentiate it from the base.  My flour is gluten free and I used it cup for cup with the recipe.  I will make these again!

I read the reviews before making this and made it with half white and half brown sugar, used real butter, added a tsp of cinnamon and vanilla, increased to 6 cups of blueberries and added oats to the Topping crumble. It came out very good. I only rated 4 stars because of the changes made. Family really liked the extra blueberries! Definitely worth making again!

Glad I read the reviews first because I used butter for the shortening and it made a great crust. Used half white sugar and half brown sugar in the crust and bumped up the cinnamon. Also used 4 teaspoons of cornstarch but it was too much so I should have stuck with 3. A little more sugar in the blueberries would have helped too. It sliced into bars well and kept well for a couple of days in the refrigerator. Guests seemed to like them so I definitely will make again.

Absolutely wonderful recipe! I used mixed frozen berries instead (strawberries, blueberries, blackberries, raspberries), and just thawed the berries before I baked it. Otherwise, I followed the recipe! It is great with vanilla ice cream on the side!!

Really good.  I used butter - no question. I did not have light brown sugar, so I used 1/2 white & 1/2 turbinado. I also added vanilla & cinnamon.  The turbinado added a kind of crunch to the dough which everyone raved over.  I can't wait to try it with a mix of berries.  It also wasn't overly sweet. A tasty addition to my recipe box! Already getting requests for it again!  If you are looking for more sweet, try a sprinkle of powdered sugar on it.

Made as written, baked the bottom crust for 5 mins first, and added an extra tsp of cornstarch to blueberries.  GREAT and EASY!!

I pretty much agree with all of my fellow cooks here when they say that using butter really makes a BIG difference! I made them first with shortening(I hate using shortening, but thought that if I didn't it might be one of those recipes where you shouldn't substitute). They were alright. The next time I used butter and they were quite tasty. I used fresh blueberries, but will use wild blueberries this summer. I think that the tartness of the wild berries would be quite nice.

Great for using up soft fruit that is slightly past its best! For improved nutritional value I reduced the flour and sugar in the crust and substituted LSA(ground linseed, sunflower & almond). 
Unless you have a preference for sickeningly sweet, fruit is plenty sweet enough by itself.

Made these with fresh blueberries-thought they looked too thick for what I like, so I made half the crumb recipe and used a 9x13 inch pan-it was great.  Be sure and refrigerate to let them set up well

Delicious within 2 hours of eating however steadily gets soppy. 
But that could be particular to crumb bars as opposed to these Blueberry Crumb Bars.

I cut the recipe in half for an 8" sq pan & used butter instead of shortening, the first time I used blueberries, delicious
This time as I'm trying to use the pears from our tree before they go bad, (one can only eat so many raw ones)I used pears & added nutmeg & cinnamon to the pears, no additional sugar needed, It was Even Better!

It was good, presentation was nice but it didn't have a wow factor. It was the kind of dessert that if I saw it, I would want to try it, but would be a little disappointed.

This was really good.  Relatively easy to make. I hate cutting butter/shortening into flour so for me it wasn't really easy to make but other than that it was a simple. BTW, I used butter instead of shortening as that's what I had on hand and i replaced one of the cups of white flour with whole wheat flour and the crust was delicious. Other than the butter and flour I followed the recipe exactly.

Such a great and versatile recipe! I used all whole wheat flour, and for the shortening I used half butter and half applesauce. It tasted amazing!

We thought this was great!  I did use butter rather then shortening and 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1/2 cup white sugar in the dough.  I also used nutmeg instead of cinnamon (because I prefer nutmeg).

These are awesome!! I will definitely be making them again. Took the advise of many of the other reviewers and used 1/2 brown sugar and 1/2 regular sugar for the crust. I also used butter instead of shortening.

Just like the others, I did sub the shortening for butter...simply can't beat butter!!!  Awesome quick recipe with everyday ingredients. Blueberries here are not in season right now so they were a little sour- I added an extra 1/4 sugar just to compensate for that and they turned our amazing. Thaaaaaanks

These were okay.  A little bland; the blueberry filling needs more "flavour".  Not sure what I'd do but the potential is definitely there.

I love these bars.. Have made them several times.. Have made these with sugar & Splenda.. The first time making with Splenda was for my Dad so he could eat some.. I must say I tried them and I like them better made with Splenda.. Also the recipe I used did not call for shortening or egg..

Fantastic!  Like others recommended, I used butter instead of shortening.  The flour mixture was very dry going into the pan, but in the end it turned out quite nicely.  Would definitely recommend and will make again!

Delicious!  The only things I did differently was using frozen blueberries and butter instead of shortening.  I just thawed out the berries and used them as directed.  I forgot to add the egg, but it came out beautifully and tasted great!

This is a great idea and comes together nicely!  Tastey, though not the best I've ever had.

I used partially thawed/drained frozen blueberries and it worked nicely.

I plan on using it again and maybe trying other fruits?

Very adaptable to fruit on hand.  I had fresh strawberries and rhubarb so I measured 3 cups strawberries to 1 cup rhubarb for the fruit.  I also used half cup shortening and half cup butter for extra flavor.  Great recipe.  Thanks@

I've been making this dessert for years and my family loves it. This spring, I had tons of rhubarb, so tried it in this recipe with a few adjustments. Delicious! We like it maybe even better than before. I used 3 cups of small diced rhubarb and nearly 2 cups blueberries (frozen). I added an additional tsp of cornstarch and an additional 1/4 cup of sugar to the fruit mix. I also baked it 5 mins longer than usual. Yum, yum!

These were great.  I used 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1/2 cup white and added 1 teaspoon vanilla to the egg mixture.  They were crumbly the first day and didn't stay together well, but the next day they were much less crumbly.  Everyone enjoyed them.

I made these for my boyfriend once (complete blueberry fanatic) and now he requests them all the time. I offer to make other things like blueberry pie, muffins, etc... But all he wants is this. I feel like I'm cheating because it's so darn easy... I hate to think what would happen if he found out these are so easy he could make them himself...?  PS I add cinnamon to taste

Very good.  I used a can of blueberries, so eliminated the need for the sugar & cornstarch mixture.  I used butter instead of shortening.  And my mixture wasnt very crumble-y but it was still very tasty.

A pretty decent recipe. I didn't have butter on hand so I used Golden Crisco. I'll try it again sometime using butter as the topping was a bit too dry/crumbly and I have a feeling this was due to the Crisco.

I used blueberries, blackberries and raspberries;  which was a wonderful combination in these bars.  I would have given 5 stars, but I found the crumb topping too dry and lacking flavor.  Next time I will substitute butter for the shortening.  Very easy to make; recipe is a keeper.

Fantastic and easy.  I took other advice and split the sugar with white and brown and added a tsp of extra cornstartch due to the extra liquid with my frozen blackberries I used.  Thanks for the nice dessert...whole family loved it!

Quite good, I served them warm with vanilla ice cream. I made half with regular flour and half with Bob's red mill all-purpose gluten free flour for a guest, and the GF batch was very good. I did use 1 stick of butter and 1/2 cup of shortening which gave the crust  a good flavor.  Will certainly make these again.

I made some changes but I love this recipe -I can't stop eating it!! This will be a favorite for sure!! Let's see -  I used brown sugar in the crust,  used half whole wheat flour and half white flour.  I used half butter and half shortening.  I also added the zest from a lemon to the crust, and I added  an extra egg (because sometimes whole wheat substitutions need that).  The next time I make it I might add 50% more lemon zest or some lemon essence to the egg. But all in all - Yum! Yum! Yum!!

Great, very easy recipe.  I didn't even have to get out my stand mixer!  I cut the recipe in half (since it's just me and my husband) but still used one egg and it was perfect.  Cooked it in a 9x9 dish.  The ingredients are so basic so I always have them around so I can whip these up any time without a trip to the store.

The hardest part is cutting the shortening into the flour, but other than that this is a pretty simple and extremely delicious dessert. It's a HIT EVERYTIME I make it...I get requests for it as a birthday gift!

YUMMMMM!!! I can't stay away from the pan. So easy and delicious!  I used real butter, 1/2 c. brown and 1/2 c. white sugar in the crust/crumb topping and a mix of frozen berries (blue, black and rasp). Because the berries were frozen, I ended up baking it about an hour.  It was a huge hit by everyone, including my 12 year old son who usually doesn't like anything that isn't chocolate. AWESOME! Now back to the kitchen for one more...

The crumb  topping is just right. I've been looking for months for just the right thickness and crunch and this was it.  Hubby and guests agree, as they've been the subjects of my trials! :)

As suggested before I used 1/2 cup white, and 1/2 cup brown sugar and butter instead of shortening and frozen blueberries. My husband is an avid blueberry lover and loved this recipe. Easy to make and stores fairly well. Thank you!

Excellent, easy recipe! Following others' advice, I used butter instead of shortening, used half white and half brown sugar, added vanilla, and I substituted about a third of the flour with graham cracker crumbs.

This is a great recipe with some alterations; otherwise I think it would be quite bland. For the crust, I used 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup light brown sugar, 2 cups AP flour, 1/2 cup whole wheat flour, and 1/2 cup oats, and 1 cup of butter instead of shortening. I increased the salt to 1/2 teaspoon and the cinnamon to 1 tsp. I added the zest of one small lemon and the juice of half of it, plus 1/2 tsp. each of vanilla and almond extract, directly into the egg. I used frozen blueberries straight out of the freezer and added an additional 1 TBSP of cornstarch to the 3 tsp. in the recipe. I also added 1 cup of chopped, toasted pecans to the topping (mixed in).  I think next time I might omit the oats and replace it with an equal amount (1/2 cup) of additional whole wheat flour. Also, I might omit the pecans. I'm not sure either of those things improved the texture. Also, something kind of strange happened with this recipe: After I let the dish cool and cut the bars, I thought the filling tasted bland and wasn't sweet enough. But after the bars sat for a couple days, they seemed to become much sweeter--almost too sweet. Strange. So I might cut the sugar just a tad next time.

OMG!!!! These are incredible! I substituted 2c of the white flour with 1c whole wheat and 1c Oatmeal. I also sub'd 1/2 the white sugar with half light brown. For the bottom layer I think the trick is to add a bit of water to the bottom mixture (along with Vanilla as per other review) to get a better consistency and avoid it being to crumbly. My Hubby loved it and I will take the rest to my sisters tonight and see how they like. Incredibly easy to make! I will be making these again for sure!!!

I had a container of blueberries that no one was eating, so I entered blueberries on the ingredient list and this recipe popped up.  YUM YUM YUM!  The 9 x 13 pan was gone in 2 days...with just my husband and I nibbling on it as we walked by.  I did use butter instead of shortening  1 cup for 1 cup.  It was great!  It may have been a little too soft to cut into bars, but maybe if I cooked it a bit longer it would have held together better.  Still.....NO COMPLAINTS!

I think these are perfect, hubby doesn't think they're sweet enough.  I made them exactly as the recipe is written.  I used blueberries that I picked fresh today.  I will definitely be making these again, but will probably add some brown sugar, cinnamon and butter to the half of the crust that is sprinkled on top next time...just to sweeten it up a little for hubby's taste.

AWESOME!!! My kids loved them.  I also used butter instead of shortening, and did half white sugar and half brown.  I also added 1 tsp. of vanilla.  Great way to get those antioxidants in!

Wow! These are incredible. I didn't make too many changes. I used butter instead of shortening, and if I do it again I may use 1/2 brown sugar like others suggested. My only bits of advice are to make the bottom layer of crust a little thicker than the top so it doesn't leak through the bottom and to make sure you let it cool for several hours.

These were wonderful.  My five grandkids age 3 to 11 loved them.  I used butter instead of crisco and halved the sugar with brown and white.  Let me just say, I am not a baker.  When I went to make them, my flour was expired in 2005 and my baking powder was expired in 1998.  I had to go back to the grocery store.  It kind of shows you I am not a baker and these turned out GREAT!  We topped with vanilla ice cream. YUM!!

Oh my this is so good. We have a abundant supply of fresh blueberries and wanted to try this and it is delicious. Used 1 cup of butter instead of shortening added a little bit of lemon juice to the berries and a dash of van extract. Cant wait to eat it with homemade vanilla ice cream. Kids love it also.

Very short pastry! We loved it!  The change I made was replacing blueberries by sour cherries as we had that at home. It was really great! Next time I will make it with blueberries as well.

We ate them when they were still warm (the looked so good!), and they tasted a little bland and thick (not very crumbly). I substituted applesauce for the shortening, so that could have been the problem. I will try it again and maybe make a few different adjustments, that is the great thing about recipes, tweak them till they are your own!

I'm obviously in the minority, but I think the recipe as written is nothing special. I made it with shortening since my daughter can't have dairy. I thought it was very bland. It definitely would benefit from using butter and more spices. It's not awful, but no one in my family liked it enough to have more than a few bites.

Very good. I substituted butter for the shortening and Splenda for the sugar. I will definitely make this again with changes: add 1/2 tsp vanilla to the crumb mix (a little bland); split the recipe between two 8x8's to make thinner bars. My bars were too thick. Also I will carefully split the crumb in half to not get too much of it on the bottom.

this is a delicious recipe for blueberry bars!!! they tastes just like bluberry pie except for the hassle involved with making a pie! it took very little time to prepare.i would definetley make it again. the only thing i did differently was adding a 2nd egg since the mixture was a little too crumbly to form the base. thank you for this delicious recipe!

Wow ! These are great. I used butter instead of shortening, and added a 1/2 tsp. more cornstarch....as some other reviews suggested, They were DELICIOUS. I was afraid that they may be too crumbly to cut & bring to a party as bars, but they cut & traveled beautifully. Wonderful recipe! Thanks

Excellent, quick and easy!  As others suggested, I used butter instead of shortening and  used a mixture of fresh and frozen blueberries because I only had 1 cup of fresh on hand.  I used half of the sugar and the results are wonderful!

Not too sweet and a great texture. I used about 3/4 c of butter and it was fine - I might add a bit more next time instead. To the bottom half I added a little bit of milk (probably about a few tablespoons) to help it hold together better; it worked well. I also used frozen blueberries, taken out of the freezer about 10 minutes ahead of time, and they worked great.

These blueberry crumb bars were really yummy! Instead of shortening I used butter and I also used frozen blueberries that I bought in bulk from Cosco. They tasted amazing! At first I thought they would be too sugary but it turns out that they are just right. As with any crumble, I think it tastes best when served warm.

I used frozen mixed berries and the bars turned out great.  I also used half brown sugar and sprinkled the tops with cinnimon sugar.  Pat down the top crumb crust for bars that will hold together better.

YUMMY! I made this today. I used frozen blueberries and cooked it the same amount of time called for in the recipe. I used butter, 1/2 whole wheat flour, 1/2 brown sugar and added 1 tsp of almond extract to the dough part. Even my picky husband who isn't fond of blueberries agreed it was "really good".

I made these yesterday and they are all gone! 6 kids here...I added a tablespoon or so of buttermilk to the crumb mix as I thought it was a little too dry. I'm sure water or milk will do if you don't have the buttermilk. I also used thawed frozen blueberries. An excellent dessert!

We enjoyed these but used a package of frozen mixed fruit with strawberries, rasberries, and blueberries in one batch and just the blueberrries in the other. My husband thought the rasberries brought out more flavor and I aggreed. They seemed to go over well at church. I used real butter too.

I used a blackberry pie filling instead of the blueberry mix-turned out divine. We heated them up and served with vanilla ice cream, also works great as a bar. I used 1/2 brown sugar 1/2 white.

Great recipe...similar to the Great Harvest crumbleberry bars.  I think you could add more berries and mix them to make it even more interesting.  Next time, I might also try adding some oats!  Keeper recipe.

Wonderful.  I made these as per the recipe, except I also added a small amount of liquid to the bottom crust and baked it alone for about 10 minutes before adding the blueberries and top crumbs.  Just fabulous.  I think this would be great with apples also!!!!  Oh, and I also used butter instead of shortening.

Mmmm... definitely a keeper. I have a huge sweet tooth, unlike my parents. So I decided that I would do them a favor and make them something a little healthier. When I saw this recipe and read the reviews, I knew it was going to be a winner. I made a few modifications, though. First of all, I used Splenda to substitute the sugar. And due to my lack of shortening, I just used real butter. I also lemon juice to the blueberry mix, which gave the bars a wonderful tangy-ness and complimented the blueberries perfectly. I LOVE cinnamon, so i added much more than called for to the crumb topping, and proceeded to sprinkle it liberally over the blueberry topping before sprinkling the crumb topping over it. 
Overall, I can say this recipe was perfect for my parents. My mom adored it, because it wasn't too sweet. But for you sweet tooths out there, I suggest adding more sugar.

These were delicious. Like little blueberry crisp bars. Next time I will try adding more flour and liquid to give them a more cake-like texture and disperse the sugar (they were very sweet).

Awesome blueberry flavor! I did add some lemon zest, since it complements the blueberry so well, as well as an extra tsp of cornstarch, just to be safe. The crust does seem dry when you're pressing it in, but that's what creates the delicate texture of the finished product.  Very yummy!

Yum! This is delicious as written, but I made a few changes to make it even better. I use 1 cup oats in place of 1 cup flour, and I also use a little less shortening (butter works as well) just to make it a little healthier. The berry mixture definitely doesn't need so much sugar, since a lot of it doesn't even stick to the berries. I also use half the amount of sugar in the dough, otherwise it's VERY sweet. One more thing I would reccomend: halve the amount of dough, and ONLY put it on top of the berries and not in the bottom of the pan (it just gets a little soggy at the bottom, and if it's on top then it will get nice and crispy.) This is a great recipe for blueberry season! Yummy!

These were okay.  Not spectacular, but they got good reviews from the people at work.  I found them a little sweet, and I used a frozen blackberry, raspberry, blueberry combo from Costco.  They make a lot, which is good for pot lucks, bake sales, etc.  These would be good served in large 2x2 inch squares with coffee or tea.

An excellent treat for munching, and not overly sweet. Holds together rather well, so it is a good hand held food (though you may want a napkin to keep those crumbs, mmm). I left out the optional cinnamon and salt, and it still tastes great. Honestly, I believe that most any fruit could be substituted in, and the recipe would still be excellent.

This recipe was delicious! I made it for a bake sale, and it was a huge it. I used real butter instead of shortening, as per many recommendations.  Also, I used frozen blueberries for one batch.  For the others, I used frozen sliced strawberries.  If you have a sweeter tooth, the strawberries are definitely the way to go.  I personally preferred them to the blueberry bars, but both were great!

Wanted to use up some blueberries but only had 2 cups so I made 1/2 the recipe. It was really good, maybe could be just a tad sweeter. Next time I will increase the sugar by just a bit.

Delicious!  Halved the recipe and baked in an 8 inch square pan.  Subbed butter for the shortening and sprayed the baking dish with cooking spray instead of greasing.  They popped right out.  Can't miss with this one!  Thanks.

Wow, these turned out more like a very wet, rectangle-shaped pie.  I had already upped the cornstarch to 4 tsp per another reviewer but this clearly wasn't enough.  Oh well.  I ended up scooping servings out into a bowl and serving it with a cobbler topping I made and vanilla icecream.

I used butter flavored shortening in the recipe and this was a hit.  I accidentally left out the salt and cinnamon.  The flavor was great -- not too sweet and it was a nice addition to the dessert buffet.

easy to make.  Love the crisp crust, added a bit more shortening since it didn't look much of a crust consistency.  Turned out great.

These were SO good!  I added extra cinnamon and used frozen berries instead of fresh.  I also accidentally left out the baking powder and they were still perfect.  These tasted like they came straight from the bakery. Thanks for a great recipe!

The only reason I rated this a 4 star is because I changed the recipe a bit. My husband and 2 of of my 3 kids loved it.  I followed the advice of others and used 1/2 butter and 1/2 shortening. I also used 1/2 white sugar and 1/2 brown sugar in the crust.  I halved the recipe so I put it in an 8x8 pan.  I still used one egg, beaten, and I added 1/2 tsp of vanilla to the beaten egg before adding it to the mixture.  I used the salt and 1/2 tsp cinnamon(I would definitely not leave this out).  I pressed 1/2 the batter into the bottom of the pan and for the top, I also "flattened" it out to make like a top crust.  Before putting it in the oven, I sprinkled it with a little white sugar.  I cooled it completely before cutting it and it was great.  The will definitely be going in my recipe box.

Excellent dessert.  Family loved it.  I heeded other reviewers suggestions and used both brown and white sugars and added the juice of one orange to base and doubled the cornstarch in the berries. Oh and don't forget to substitute butter for at least half (if not all!) the shortening.

These were very good and very easy to make. Everyone loved them even my food critic son!  I used half frozen and half fresh blueberries and they were great.

People went nuts for this.  I thought it was pretty good, but the reaction I got is what is making me give it 5 stars.

I'd give this recipe 5 stars, but I didn't follow it as is, I did as many others did an changed the shortening to 1/2 cup butter and 1/2 cup butter flavored crisco, and the 1 cup sugar to 1/2 white, and 1/2 brown. THESE WERE FANTASTIC! OMG..I had a few british ladies over for tea, and they could not stop commenting on them. This is a sure fire staple in my house from now on! YUM YUM YUM!

Excellant!! Used frozen blueberries and 1/2 butter and 1/2 shortening. (Didn't want a strong Crisco taste)  Blended in food processor and it worked great. A definite dessert for all seasons.

My family really enjoyed.  I did substitute with Splenda which apparently was a mistake since my husband could really taste the Splenda.  He rated it a 3 using Splenda but a 4 to 4-1/2 if I would use regular sugar next time which I will.  Thanks

Wonderful!!  I let my two and five year olds help me make this with frozen berries we picked this summer.  We had fun making them and even more fun eating them!!  I hope there's enough left to have one with coffee in the morning or I'll be making another batch!  You can really enjoy the blueberries in this, they don't get lost in it and stay very delicious!

I took the suggestion of other reviewers and used butter in the place of shortening and used half brown sugar & half white.  It turned out great!  It's very sweet & gooey, but I didn't hear anyone complaining!  They are even better the second day!  Leaving them in the refrigerator for a day got them to set up a little more and gave the flavors a chance to really come together.

Very good--not too sweet but just right.  The taste of fresh blueberries really shines in this dish.  My picky eater husband and my not-so-picky coworkers all loved it!!!  Also was very easy to make.

Wonderful recipe.  Best blueberry bar by far.
