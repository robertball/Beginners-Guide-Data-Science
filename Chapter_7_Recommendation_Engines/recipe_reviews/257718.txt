I confess that every once in a while when I see the very large amounts of spices in a Chef John recipe, I get a little fearful. No problems here, I made this exactly as on the recipe, except used the broiler in the oven (about 10 inches from the top), and it was just perfect. I served it with Chef John's peanut dipping sauce, a little salad of daikon and carrot, and fresh IPA beer. As always, we enjoyed. Thanks Chef John.

I had to omit the garlic due to an allergy and substitute dried lemon grass (1 T) and ground ginger (1 tsp) because that's what I had.   I also had to cook this in the oven (preheated to 425 degrees, turned to 350 degrees upon insertion, and baked for 35 minutes) because it is winter.  It sure is good though!  This one is definitely a keeper!

this was absolutely delicious! i used the marinade on jumbo chicken wings and bf cooked them up on the grill.. this is definitely a do over! i hate prepping lemon grass so i used lemon grass puree in a tube (equal amounts).. be careful when heating up the marinade for a dip or baste as it can be very potent in closed up spaces.. ty chef john.. you never cease to impress me

Absolutely delicious! Made it exactly as the recipe stated. Couldn't believe how tender the meat was. Yum!

Really good.  I only had time to marinate for 2 hours but the flavors really came through.  We roasted it in a hot oven to 135Â° and let it rest for 10 minutes.  I got lazy and didn't do any basting and it was great without it. I would make this again.

Delicious, moist, tangy, flavorful. I haven't liked beef tip since middle school where they served some tripe they called beef tips that wasn't even good enough for my dog. The all-day-marinade and turning was a bit of work, but nothing the mini-fridge in my office couldn't help me handle. It was well worth the effort, even with my bbq pit having trouble maintaining higher than 300f. It ended up taking about an hour to cook at 270f, but came out fantastic.

My man tweaked the instructions a touch, but not the ingredients. The beef tri-tip turned out Great. Served with a side of potato,  turnip and chive mash!
