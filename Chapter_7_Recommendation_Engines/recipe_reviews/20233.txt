This was very tasty.  I even accidentally overcooked one loaf, and it still came out moist and sweet.  I used half chopped dates & half raisins because I didn't have enough raisins, and it was good.  

One note: this made more than two 9x5 loaf pans for me.  I filled the loaf pans up to about an inch below the top (I was worried they would overflow), and I had enough extra batter to fill another mini loaf pan.

As a welsh girl my self, this is a good recipe.  My only criticism is that it is called bara brith  not welsh tea loaf.  But tasty all the same

I needed something vegan and wanted to use what I had on hand, so I messed with this so much it could hardly be called the same recipe.  However since the result deserved like 6 stars, I figured I owe this recipe at least 5!!  :)  Here is what I did: 2 cups water 1/2 c. raisins 4 t. baking soda 1/3 c. chopped dates 1/3 c. walnuts, chopped 1 c. applesauce 1/2 c. oil 1 1/2 c. sugar 3 eggs 2/3 c. molasses 1 t. vanilla 1/2 t. salt 4 1/2 c. flour 2 t. baking powder  Heat water and raisins to boiling. Remove from heat and add baking soda, then dates and walnuts. Blend applesauce, oil, and sugar. Add eggs, molasses, vanilla, and salt. Graduaully add flour and baking powder. Grease and flour pans (grease with oil to retain parve). Pour batter into pans. (24 mini loaves) Bake 15-18 minutes

I made this for the first time and it took it to an International Potluck dinner with my Trefoil Guild.  The recipe is now going to be included in a cookbook being put together by one of the other Guilds with reference to the author of the recipe and All Recipes.  I was worried with so much water being added, but pleasantly surprised.  I received many positive compliments, and one member even took home much of what was leftover.

The subtle molasses taste is very nice, and I like the dark, rich color of the bread.  I used golden raisins, which I definitely think is the way to go with the dark color of the bread itself.  I would recommend this one and will be  baking it again myself!

I made this tea loaf for work and the comments were excellent!  I followed the directions exactly and the 2 loaves came out so moist and just the right amount of sweetness for my taste.  It's a very simple recipe to follow.  I did have the bake a little longer than suggested, but after 55 minutes I just did the "toothpick test", and after an additional 10 minutes the loaves were perfect!  Thanks!

this was good, but didn't go very fast in my house.  Won't make it again.

I needed to take a dish to a dinner reflecting my heritage, so I picked this Welsh Tea Loaf. It is delicious and easy to make! I used a mixture of golden raisins and currants, which is a combination I love. I added photos 1, 2, and 3...not knowing what I was doing! Sorry!

Went over very well. I had seen another recipe for Bara Brith that had mixed peel with currants instead of raisins so I tried that & liked it better than just raisins. I'm going to try one made with yeast.

I made this bread and followed the directions to a tea.  It has a very strong molasses flavor that my husband and I didn't care for.
