Excellent! I usually up the recipe to do 6 - 8 breasts at one time. If you can't grill you can also bake these in the oven. Very yummy!!!!! Thanks :)

My husband is a dark meat guy, but as far as chicken breasts go, this is his favorite. I use bacon ranch, or regular ranch and less italian dressing. I also set aside some marinade for dipping, heated it on the grill till thick and bubbly. Yum!

This recipe is fine, but it needs more taste.  Maybe more spices and marinate longer?

I've been using this recipe for years and it's still one of our favorites.  The only thing we do differently is cook the chicken in all of the dressing at a low heat (275 degrees) for about 2 or 3 hours or until it browns.  It comes out tender and we then use the left over cooked dressing to "dip" the chicken.  This is our seven year old granddaughter's favorite, especially the dipping!

I hate to give something only two stars, but it needed so much "doctoring", that it was a totally different marinade by the time I was done so I gave it this rating based on the original recipe.  Creamy salad dressing usually refers to miracle whip and maybe that's what was intended, but others took it to mean ranch dressing and that's what I used.  It needed a lot of work so I added garlic powder, rosemary, hot pepper sauce, worcestershire, a few hot pepper flakes, ground black pepper, minced onion and let it all marinate for 5 hours.  I reserved some marinade for dipping sauce and after that it wasn't bad.  There are too many other recipes on this site that don't need this much "doctoring" to make them work.

mmmmmm fantastic! I made this recipe with President's Choice Salsa Ranch dressing and Zesty Italian dressing. The first time I made it I was a little disappointed with the taste...it was good, but not great. The second time I made it I used chicken cutlets instead of chicken breasts, doubled the cayenne pepper and added 1/4 - 1/2 tsp salt, 3 crushed garlic cloves, and a good sprinkling of parsley. I didn't have time to marinate it and I couldn't bbq with the snow, so I covered the chicken with 3/4 of the dressing and popped it in the oven uncovered at 375 degrees for about 45 minutes (turning half-way). I used the last 1/4 of the dressing to baste the chicken half way through cooking. It came out delicious!! I am not a huge chicken fan but this is some of the best chicken I have ever had. I can't wait to invite company over for dinner because I will definitely be making this recipe for them. It is going in my regular rotation!

These were some of the most tender and juicy chicken breast fillets I've had.  So much of the time the grill seems to dry them out.  The had very good flavor and is a recipe I will use again many times.

This grilled chicken was very tender and quite flavourful, much better than other grilled chicken recipes I've had.  I am a novice male cook, but this recipe was easy enough even for me.  Excellent!  Thanks for sharing.

I have found that marinating chicken in Italian dressing is the best way to grill it, next to BBQ sauce. I always choose a bold, tangy, strong Italian dressing. It's that simple. I serve with a nice pasta salad.

This was excellent.....normally, Italian dressing stands out on marinades....which is quite boring to me........but the creamy ranch really broke up the normally overwhelming Italian dressing taste to become a very savory dish. Worked very well. Thank-you, Luann Charity, for a great recipe.This Will be made again.

I used the "Italian Dressing Mix" recipe from this site to make the Italian dressing to mix with the Miracle Whip.   Marinated for about 3 hours and it was really wonderful.  GREAT flavor.  The amount of chicken this will cover will vary depending on the size of the breast; I had smallish ones and there was enough marinade for 4.  Next time I may try this with bone-in breasts and bake them.

This was very easy and delicious. I marinated for about 2.5 hours then grilled for approx. 12 minutes on each side on med-high heat. The chicken was very moist and had a wonderful flavor. Will make again!

This was a great dish! I changed a few things to suit our taste but overall it got rave reviews. Instead of the creamy salad dressing I used about 8oz. of plain non-fat yogurt. (This saves some of the calories) As someone else suggested, I also added a few more spices: cayenne pepper, crushed peppercorn, and a dash of garlic all mixed together. Then I crushed up Kashi Fire-Roasted Veggie Crackers and sprinkled them on top. I let that marinate in the fridge for an hour then baked at 375 for 50 minutes. DELICIOUS!

Most recipes that call for "creamy salad dressing", without specifying a type, refer to Miracle Whip. So that's what I used. It was OK, but if I were to make it again, I would bake it. (with the sauce) I know it would be a lot more flavorful.

The whole family LOVED this recipe..just changed the cooking method a little.  I used Miracle Whip salad dressing and Ken's Steakhouse Italian dressing...the cayenne pepper and added 1/8 teaspoon of garlic powder.  Let it marinade in the fridge for about an hour...poured it into a casserole dish, baked at 375 for 45 minutes..took it out and shredded the chicken.  Cooked up some rotini...threw it in the dish. Put it back in the oven for a few..served with garlic bread, delicious!!

I love ceaser dressing, so I tryed it with a creamy ceaser and it was great. Of course it was a unique taste mixed with the italian dressing, but it worked for me. I also added a few things: dryed mexican chille seasoning and salt and pepper to taste. I liek the spice, but all in all great recipe.

This was ok, but probably my fault since we didn't have creamy dressing at home like I thought. We did however have French Onion Dip, so I used that. I think the dip had a little too much tang for this. I'd like to try it again with the proper ingredients.

THIS WAS GREAT. I USED FAT FREE ITALIAN DRESSING AND FAT FREE CREAMY RANCH DRESSING. I MARINATED THEM OVERNIGHT. I BROILED THEM INSTEAD OF GRILLING BECAUSE IT WAS FREEZING OUTSIDE.

I loved this recipe! However, after reading the recipe I had to tweek it! I didn't go too far with it though. I didn't measure a thing and I never do! I used peppercorn ranch wirh some homemade ranch. Then I added in the zesty italian dressing adding a little more after each taste. Rule of thumb is you can always add but can never take away! When I got that just right I put in a half of an envelope of sazon. Then the cayenne pepper to and kosher salt to taste! I didn't add in pepper because of the peppercorn ranch. I maranated for 4 hours. I cooked on a charcoal grill indirect for 15 minutes then turned and after 5 more minutes I put directly over the coals.  Because I made extra marinate I took out half (before adding in the chicken) and used it for salad dressing and to brush on the chicken as it cooked. So, so moist and good!

I thought the ranch took away from the good flavor that the Italian dressing provides.  Good, but I think I prefer to marinate chicken with just the Italian.  Thanks though, I always appreciate new ideas!

We love this recipe.  I use ranch and it tastes just like we're getting it from a restaurant. My husband is very picky and almost didn't try it b/c he saw it marinating- it's now one of his favorite dishes.  My daughter, who is not big on chicken, requests it as well.

Very tender and juicy chicken.  I enjoy this recipe with just about any dressing. With thicker breasts, I put on medium high heat for 10 minutes each side.

My husband and I both really enjoyed this recipe.  I marinated the chicken for 2 hours in ranch and roasted red pepper italian dressing.  Yummy, will definitely be using this again!

This recipe was just ok for me.  Since the weather was bad I used the marinade over the chicken breasts and just baked them instead of grilling them on the grill.  I used zesty italian and bleu cheeze dressing.  My sauce turned out very salty.  Next time I will try a different dressing and grill them outside.

Husband cooked this on the grill after I marinated for 4 hours and this chicken came out so moist and tasty !!  I used creamy ranch and regular italian dressings....came out really good,  may use just creamy italian next time, and maybe a bit more cayanne pepper, otherwise yummmmmmmm !!

Such an easy and tastey chicken dish. Especially to make with a short time frame, minus the marinating time.  I used boneless, skinless thin cut chicken breast, which I'm sure helped with the shorter marinating time. Marinated with red wine vinegrette and ceaser dressing since that is what I had on hand.  Cooked on the BBQ in short time.  
Followed others suggestion and make more for a sauce, layered it with bow-tie pasta and made the perfect chicken meal.  Super easy and very good tasting.

Awesome!!  My husband is a huge chicken fan and said this was the best chicken he's ever had!  He kept asking me what I did and I told him it's a secret! I used ranch with bacon and zesty italian dressings. My 2 and 4 year old ate all their chicken too!!  Big hit in our family!!  Will definitely be making it again!

I used Ceasar dressing and Spicy Italian and it was wonderful.  So moist and juicy, not to mention great flavor.  This is an easy marinade with ingredients usually on-hand.

I also baked it as the grill is under snow.  I used Ranch and an Italian dressing. Added some Parmesan cheese because I could, then a little onion for taste and some black olives for something different.  Not much of a fan of cayenne as a little can go a long way, so used some Slap ya Mama New Orleans spice.  The chicken was very good and my wife and sone loved it. The only problem was knowing how long to bake it, but it came out done at about 45 minutes at 350.

Man!  These were good!  Very moist and tender.  I honestly thought the marinade sounded kind of weird, but after reading all of the wonderful reviews I decided to give it a try.  I am so glad I did - I'll definitely be making this regularly.

Very easy, no need to marinate for more than 2 hours. Everyone loved this on the grill, very juicy & tastey! I would add more red pepper for the more spicy inclined otherwise very good! I used 3/4c creamy Italian, 1/4 cup oil/vinager & 1/4c ranch  dressing.
