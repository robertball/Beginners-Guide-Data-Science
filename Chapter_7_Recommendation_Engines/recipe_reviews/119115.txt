A friend of mine made this for a gathering and I just love it. She is like the others that add the pudding mix. Vanilla is definitely the way to go. She didn't add any cream cheese and that kept it lighter and not as heavy. I used fat free cool whip and only 2 snickers bars (which I thought was plenty). I like using granny smith apples to add a little bite.

I bring this to parties all the time. People are usually hesitant to try it until I tell them what's in it, but once they try it everyone LOVES it.  I alter the recipe a little...I use 4 apples, 6 snickers bars, one container cool whip, and 8 oz. cream cheese.  I usually freeze or refrigerate the snickers bars for a couple hours, then put them in a ziploc bag and crush them with a rolling pin.

This is one of my most coveted recipes.  I add one small box of either cheesecake or vanilla instant pudding to the Cool-Whip. Sometimes, I'll dust with chopped nuts. Very, very addictive. Watch out. This is best for White Trash or potlucks. Make sure you make copies of the recipe and bring it with. Best double it, too.

My mother introduced me to this recipe. Made for a supper potluck. If you freeze the chopped candy bars before adding them it helps keep the salad cooler longer. Yummy! This is the only kind of 'salad' my husband likes.

This is a great recipe for family or office gatherings.  It does take a little more than 5 min prep time to cut the candy bars and apples though.   For an added touch I have added 8 oz of cream cheese and a small box of vanilla pudding to the mix.  YUMMY!

I was intrigues when I saw this on a recipe request and decided I had to add it to our Thanksgiving menu. We were pleasantly surprised by how this interesting group of ingredients turned out. I did add a large package of ff, sf instant vanilla pudding to a 12 oz Cool Whip the night before, and I froze two King-sized Snickers before beating them with my meat mallet. I kept the candy bits frozen until I stirred them into the rest of the salad. My son is finishing the last of the salad as I type this - I was surprised it still tasted fine the next day - it was not at all goopy or gross.

I love this recipe. I add marshmallow cream,whipped cream, and cream cheese all togerther to make my mix. Then I throw in some marchino cherries with the apples and snickers. It taste wonderful. It gives it a taste like a carmel apple / candy apple.

This "salad" is always a surprise to folks who don't know what it is in.  It is sweet, crunchy, crisp & delicious!  I always use a package of instant vanilla pudding and granny smith apples.  Easy & quick to whip up...and always devoured!

I made this with Golden Delicious apples, thinking the really tart Granny Smiths would be too tart.  But I think they would have been better.  It was quite good, but not fabulous.  One thing I learned is not to crush the Snickers Bars too long before you're ready to mix them into the apples.  They tend to glob together into lumps which don't mix in as well.  Also, because I decided the apples were not tart enough, I added a little lemon juice to the apples (also to keep them from browning).  I don't know if that's what made the whipped topping curdle or not, but it did.  The appearance was then not as appetizing.  I think I'll make it again, but try to correct my mistakes.

SOOOOO yummy!!! I needed a "sweet" salad / dessert for yesterday's BBQ (my fiance & I hosted). I'm really glad I gave this a 2nd try. The 1st time I ever made this, I tried a version that called for slightly diff. ing. - a box of instant vanilla pudding (prep. according to pkg. direct.), an 8 oz. tub of Cool-whip & a mix. of Red Delicious / Grannysmith apples. I didn't care for it. When I saw Elaine's version (and after reading all of the helpful reviews), I knew I had to give it a try. I too added an 8 oz. block of (light) cream cheese & a sm. box of instant pudding - but this time I chose sf, ff butterscotch as lizzifizz did (I had already planned on doing so & was surprised to see that only 1 other reviewer thought of it as well...). I had some caramel ice cream topping & a sm. pkg. of roasted peanuts handy, so I topped my salad w/ both. Two things to note: a) my Snickers bars chopped easily at rm. temp.; I'm not sure they would have if partially frozen (they would crumble into tiny pcs.), b) it's perfectly fine to use low-fat or ff ing. w/ EXCELLENT results & c) use TART Grannysmith apples & DO NOT PEEL THEM (the "real" thing isn't, so why would you??!!?). Next time, I'm going to sub. vanilla pudding instead & omit the cream cheese alltogether. Although I like the richness both added, I think I'd like plain 'ol vanilla and just whipped topping better (it would be more subtle / light). Thx. for sharing, Elaine! We all really liked this a LOT! :-)

A neighbor gal brought this salad to my son's first birthday party. It was truly amazing! I asked for the recipe right away (as did all the other ladies there). The only difference in her recipe and this one is that she also added a box of Vanilla Pudding. It gives it a really good vanilla flavor. A great side if you need something light and sweet!

I got a wide variety of reviews on this recipe. Many people thought that the apples made it feel too healthy to be a dessert. I used fat free cool whip and added fat free, sugar free vanilla pudding. I liked the way it turned out, although it wasn't something I will feel the need to make often.  I thought it was better after refrigerating overnight. Overall, a good recipe. I used gala apples, and I think I'll try Granny Smith next time. It's not the best thing on All Recipes that I've tried, but I'm saving the recipe, and I'm sure I'll use it again.

So easy and so good!  I have made it a few times now.  Some optional ingredients that I have tried: Oreo pie crust, toasted coconut, chopped pecans, caramel topping, marachino cherries.  It is good on its own, or with its many tasty variations. This recipe is a keeper!

Like others, I added 1 small box of vanilla instant pudding.  This is such a fun, easy "salad" to take to a BBQ!  Mmmmmm!

*** I mixed the cool whip and pudding, let it set up in the fridge and then added the frozen snickers chunks and apples to it.***

I saw this on the "buzz" and thought it sounded so different, I had to try it. I made a 1/2 recipe to see how it would taste. I diced the apple and candy bar into 1/4" sized pieces, and left the peel on the apples, as it didn't state in the recipe. I have always thought of fruit salads as being dessert, and this one no differently. And, I really wouldn't call this surprise salad, but more like: "CARAMEL APPLE" salad. It tastes like a trip to the carnival. This would work fine for a real quick spring time picnic pot-luck dessert.

I took the recommendation of one viewer and added 1/4 Cup of caramel sauce to the whipped topping and to me it took this recipe to the next level.  I chopped the Snickers, but next time will crush them into smaller pieces.  Even so, I received lots of compliments on this great recipe.  Thanks Elaine!!

I took this to a Bar-B-Q and it was described as a caramel apple.  VERY easy.  I used a pack of snickers (6) and 4 granny smith apples.  Suggest that you chill or freeze the snickers before chopping.  Definitely a dessert.

easy and tasty. I did sub peanut butter snickers for regular snickers bucause who doesn't love peanut butter and apples? anyway, got a lot of positive comments but not a lot of "got have this recipe"s. Its light and summery.

OMG!! This is sooo good! I used granny smith apples and left the peel on.  I made this on Easter Sunday and everyone thought it was a mayo base.  When they tasted it they were shocked! It was gone in 10 min!!! Tip:  Freeze the snickers to make it easier to chop up.

Let's just say I doubled the recipe so my boyfriend would have leftovers. But I found him eating what was left at 3am. He was standing by the fridge wolfing it down. This salad is that good! Lol

I think this recipe is great how it is.  I have tried the cream cheese addition, which is pretty good.  I thought adding the pudding mix RUINED the salad!  I'll never put pudding in it again. It tastes like a caramel apple if you make the recipe as written.

I loved this and so did everyone else. I didn't tell them that there were Snickers in it.  They were very surprised!! I had my snickers in the frig. before cutting them and they were hard to cut and they fell apart.  When I make this again I will cut them at room tempature.  I will also try this with Heath bars the next time!!

I made this for Easter dinner.  I added 1/2 package vanilla pudding mix to the whip cream.  I don't think it is necessary to peel the apples.  The peel just adds a little extra color which is nice.  I think some maraschino cherries would be a nice addition for another touch of color.

I had this last summer during a vacation.  I made it at home, used 4 apples: 2 red, 2 green.  I also added a french vanilla pudding packet to the cool whip.  I took it to a party and people thought it was potato salad.  They laughed and said it was the best potato salad they ever had.

My mother, grandmother had made an apple salad for all the holiday meals, but never used cool whip, it was made with mircle whip, no snickers, but walnuts, celery, grapes... my favorite until a friend gave me a similar reciept as this one and I have not made the family traditional recipe since. I use 3 each granny smith, 3 red apples, snickers, whipped topping, salted peanuts, fold in carmel topping. top with more snickers, salted peanuts and carmel topping. when I take this dish to family get togethers, I return home with an empty bowl. Everyone wants the recipe, so I always take recipe cards and place beside the dish on the table...

I love bringing this to parties. I usually spunk it up a little by adding honey crisp apples to my green apples and use twix and kit kats to the snickers.

Another super easy & great recipe!  Always a hit with my friends/family. I enjoy watching those who are trying it for the first time guess what candy bar is inside.  I'm going to start playing with candy bar creations. I'm going to try a butterfinger next, maybe rolo's or payday too.

I went for broke with this recipe, added all of the suggestions...the cream cheese, pudding, caramel sauce...WOW...it was a big hit!  I saved some of the crushed Snickers to sprinkle on top and then drizzled with the caramel and it looked GREAT!

Always a favorite with my kids.  I add a box of butterscotch pudding mix to the whipped topping.  It gives it a richer flavor and stiffer base.  It also tastes great with banannas.  Definitely YUMMY!

This is terrific.   My whole family loved it.   It kept better than I thought it would with the apples and cool whip.   I did add the caramel topping and it was really yummy.   Best to keep snickers froze and apples cold before preparing.

The first time I had this was at my husband's high school reunion and I wasn't sure about the ingredients but as soon as I took a bite I loved it.  It is an easy and great recipe that I will use often.

This was ok.  Fun for kids.  The flavor wasn't as interesting as it sounds, though.
