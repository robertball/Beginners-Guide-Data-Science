Great marinade for shrimp!! But i changed the recipe and was glad i had. I cut the measurements in half and reduced the oil to 1 cup based on other reviews, and still had plenty of marinade for 50 large prawns. Also cut the salt/pepper to 1tsp each. And I cut out the oregano, wanting the cilantro to shine. It was so easy and made the shrimp so tasty. We grilled instead of sauteeing them, and it was a huge hit!

I think the measurements are off - 1/4 cup of salt is way too much. This already has lime & vinegar so I reduced the salt to 1 teaspoon and reduced the oil to just 2 tablespoons. With those modifications, I was still left with lots of marinade left over, which I simply cooked and poured over some white rice. Very tasty!!

Not too bad in my opinion, but my tastes are VERY eclectic, I can see how MANY people wouldn't like this. Cut the salt in HALF, both the seasoned salt and regular salt, and cut WAY back on most of the other ingredients, like, maybe in half. This recipe was designed for about 3 pounds of shrimp. If you like the sweet and sour thing, then you may like this. I accidantally made this instead of a regular "tequila shrimp" and it was NOT what I was expecting because I just simply selected the wrong recipe. Eh, write it off to a learning experience.

If you marinade shrimp in lime juice for two hours, it will "cook" it...This is how you make seviche!
I liked it, but I wouldn't marinate it for than 15-20 minutes...
