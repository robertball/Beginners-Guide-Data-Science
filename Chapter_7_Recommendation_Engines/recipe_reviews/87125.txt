I used reduced fat cream cheese, my own homemade italian seasoning and because I'm on a budget, Kraft parmesan cheese. I spread this on french bread and broiled it for about five minutes. HUGE hit with the boys. They absolutely loved this. I was told that this is the only garlic bread to make from now on. EDITED: Now that I've made this twice, this reminds me a little of Laughing Cow!

Fabulous! This stuff is absolutely delicious! I cut the recipe in half to give this a try and boy am I glad I did. This is basically like a garlic bread spread, but the addition of the cream cheese makes this rich and creamy. This is so simple to throw together and has so few ingredients - what's not to love? I blended everything together and you can easily "tweak" this to suit your tastes.  I let it set in the fridge for a few hours to let the blend.  Perfect over warm bread, but also great on crackers and I might even try this on carrot or celery sticks...

Well this recipe convinced me that I may not be a fan of cream cheese on my garlic bread.  I had a French baguette in the freezer that I split lengthwise.  I spread this on the cut sides and popped it under the broiler.  I think the cream cheese prevented this from browning the way I would have liked, but the edges were starting to burn so I had to pull it out.  This was good, but just didnâ€™t appeal to us as much as some others.  I did try the little I had leftover on pita chips and that was good, but again, not a favorite.

Wow, this stuff is delcious! I ordered breadsticks once from an Italian place that sold it with a white spread that came in a little container. This tastes so much like that! Any type of homemade bread stick would taste good with this. I changed it to 2 servings with the calculate button and it made about 1/4 cup, so the full recipe is accurate on the 3/4 cup or 6 servings. To cut the sat. fat back some I used whipped cream cheese and butter with canola oil. I accidentally forgot to add the parmesan cheese. It must have been a good mistake, because it didn't seem to need it. It would have lost the creamy consistency I think anyhow. I also used pre-minced garlic and it worked fine.

Easy to make! Love the alternative to just butter and herbs for rolls!

Good but a bit salty. I toned it down with extra cream cheese. My husband approved. Thanks!

Oh my gosh!!! This was delicious!!! Sadly I didn't have any Italian seasoning so I had to improvise, but this is excellent!!!! My husband who maybe eats 3 pieces of bread normally, easily ate 10! We tried it before and after broiling (3 mins was perfect time for us) and definitely liked it broiled better! The flavors just melted together into some major yumminess!!! Great recipe! Thanks for sharing it!!

FANTASTIC! I slathered this on some sliced Italian bread and threw it under the broiler for garlic bread to go w/ out pasta tonight and it was wonderful! I also dipped a few pretzels in it and that was super yummy too. I see this being a staple in our house...it's soooo versatile. I can't wait to try it on homemade rolls~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

This is incredible stuff. Went really well with our pasta dinner, next time I think I'll spread this on the bread and then pop them in the broiler for a few minutes, as other reviewers have done.  This is a keeper for sure. Thanks for sharing!

Excellent. Used this to spread on top of Herb Quick Bread by Taste of Home. However, I used a tsp of bottled minced garlic instead of fresh garlic and basil instead of Italian seasoning. Next time I'm going to just add garlic powder or salt because I didn't like the chunks of garlic in the spread. I think that will bump this recipe up to 5 stars.

Awesome! I used it on already toasted bread. Next time will reduce the amount of butter
