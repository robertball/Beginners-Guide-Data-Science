I made a lot of alterations, but I decided to write for those who try to "healthy-up" the recipes here. I used 2 bunches fresh broccoli, added 3 squash, and steamed. Used low-fat soup, and fat-free sour cream replaced the mayo. No cheese, and Italian breadcrumbs sprinkled instead of the mix. Instead of butter, I sprayed the top with "I Can't Believe..." butter spray. Even this way, it's a keeper!

So easy and really good, everybody loved it with Christmas dinner.  My alterations: I doubled the recipe, but kept the mayo the same as with the original recipes, mixed the broccoli in with everything else instead of layering, and used crushed Ritz crackers on top instead of stuffing mix.  Awesome!  The doubled recipe only took the same amount of time as the original recipe.

This was pretty good. It goes together quickly, and the taste was great. I used fresh broccoli rather than frozen. I just threw it in the bottom of the dish and then added the rest of the ingredients. I also didn't add as much mayonnaise, and I didn't add butter to the topping. I used whole wheat crackers for the topping instead of stuffing due to dietary needs. Don't be afraid to experiment with this one to suit your tastes.

I love this because it is nice as it is, but also so easy to modify for your own taste. Also easy to modify and make healthier without losing to much in flavor. This is a keeper. P.S. Every time I have served this, no matter what the changes, everyone loves it.

I also made this to be very healthy. I used fat free shredded cheddar cheese, fat free mayo, egg substitute, 98% fat free cream of mushroom soup and the fat free butter spray. As I was mixing it, I was afraid it was going to be too dry, so I added about  1 and 1/2 c. of chicken boullion. My guests loved it.

I rated this a one because my niece, nephew, and dtr liked it.  I must have done something wrong.  The stuffing was very dry on top of the broccoli.  The mixture was clumpy.

This dish is amazing! I used fresh steamed broccoli & made my own stuffing from Nine Grain Wheat Bread using this recipe:  http://allrecipes.com/Recipe/Basic-Bread-Stuffing/Detail.aspx?prop31=2  I also used extra sharp cheddar.  Beyond that, I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out to be so delicious and satisfying!

Edible but nothing i will make again. Used fresh broccoli that i blanched for a few mins but other than that followed the recipe. The stuffing topping stayed crunchy, like croutons, and the soup/cheese mixture wasnt creamy or cheesy enough. I think prepared stuffing should be spread over top and baked for the last 15 mins. I may play around with this one and attempt it again but wont make it as written again.

I made this twice over the holidays ... once for Christmas Dinner and again for New Year's Eve celebration.  Both times it got raving reviews.  I definately recommend frozen broccoli for this recipe as opposed to fresh.  Don't over do it on the breadcrumbs ... in fact I used a little less the second time around and it came out better.  I also substituded Egg Beaters for the eggs and it came out great!    This recipe is so easy that it should be considered for any quick side dish on the fly!

This did not turn out well for me. The eggs in this CURDLED. And not in a cooked, scrambled-egg-like way. They turned into a grainy textured mess. I didn't cook my broccoli beforehand and it was still MUSHY when this was done. I can't even begin to describe the taste. The only part I ate off the little portion I put on my plate was the buttered bread crumbs. I subbed in Italian bread crumbs, and added carrots and yellow pepper. My additions had nothing to do with the gray, sludge-like 'sauce' that ruined fresh veggies and cheese (couldn't even tell it was in there).

This is a great recipe that can be modified in many different ways. Once, I substituted corn and carrots for the b  roccoli and it turned out great! I am always looking for interesing vegetarian thanksgiving ideas. This one is so versatile. Just use any veggies that you have around the house, cook them a little before adding them to the mixture, and voila!

Sooo good! I made just a few changes however, I added 2 or three large cloves fresh garlic and instead of cooking broccoli I just left it frozen and mixed everything but the stuffing and butter. After pouring the mixture in the baking dish I melted the butter and mixed about 5oz stuffing in a small bowl. Then I put that over the broccoli mixture. Turned out great!

This was really tasty, but I was a bit worried cause I didn't know if I was supposed used prepared stuffing or not.  I wound up following directions and spritz water over the butter and dry bread crumbs mix.  I was in a rush, so I missed the part that said cooked broccoli (it should have been listed in the ingredients as so) and I missed the mayo (my fault).  It didn't matter in the end. It was great without the mayo and the broccoli was cold in the middle so I just popped each serving in the microwave and then it was fine. I would definately make this again.

I doubled this recipe and nearly ate the entire thing by myself!  Better than the usual same ole stuffing.  I forgot to add cheese, but it was not missed.  Simply fabulous.  I will try to share it next time. :)

This was very oily on the bottom layers and overly crunchy on the top. Maybe if it were mixed together instead of  the layering it would be much better.

very good dish! I doubled the cheese topping though, and drizzle more butter on top (or use less stuffing). but very good with the cheese sauce doubled

No more green bean casserole for me! This recipe easy, tastes great and is a hit every time I bring it to a dinner.

The only changes I have made are to use sharp cheddar cheese and because the cheese got dry during cooking time, I do not add the cheese until the last few minutes of cooking time only to let it melt. I read this tip from others and it does make it perfect!

I'm not gonna lie, I was leery of mixing egg, cream of mushroom soup and mayo. But it was good! I left off the stuffing for our low carb lifestyle.

next time I make this I'm doing it a lot different--using a little milk in the cheese sauce to thin it out, preparing the stuffing first then putting on top, covering it when baking, NOT use cream of mushroom, will try chicken and put some diced chicken in with the broccoli, maybe add another egg.  The only reason I didn't give this one star is because my kids actually ate this without complaint--so there is a lot of potential here.  Peppers would have been fun too.

I absolutely love this recipe. I will be making this again real soon! I changed out Ritz crackers instead of the stuffing and I used Cream of Chicken soup, since that was the soup I had on hand! Other than that, this is a keeper!!!

I made this tonight as a side dish and it was really good. I made half the recipe but kept the soup the same, and I used cream of chicken plus I added garlic powder, salt and pepper to the cream mixture. Thanks for this recipe Autumn
