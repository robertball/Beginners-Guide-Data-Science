I used red wine vinegar, but otherwise followed the recipe. Excellent taste! I served with mashed potatoes. Will be making this one many times...

I have made this recipe three times so far, and each time, my fiance said it was the best thing I had ever made.  I haven't changed anything from the original recipe because, as the saying goes, if it ain't broke, don't fix it!  I serve this with mashed potatoes and sauteed greenbeans for an elegant looking, impressively tasting meal.  Thanks!

We made this recipe last night to test for Christmas dinner. It was very good and simple to make. We plan to make most of dish (prepare the meat and reduce the wine sauce) before we start our meal and let the final sauce reduce while we eat our salad. I'm not sure if I like the thyme.... we will be preparing the dish with orange rind in place of the thyme. The cranberries are very plump, yummy and festive.

Great recipe!  Delicious and very pretty.  I used white wine vinegar, and it turned out fine.  You have to watch the sauce pretty closely at the end so it's best to serve side dishes that come be made ahead.

This was great and easy. I loved the sweet/sour flavors of the sauce. I used a pork tenderloin cut into thin slices. I also used white wine vinegar instead of distilled.

This dish is wonderful!  My husband and I have had it twice now, and can't get over how good it is!!  I buy a pork tenderloin (1 to 1.5 lb), but it in 1 to 1 1/2" sections and use that for the meat.  It's so tender!!

This was a great recipe - I needed something different and fast for dinner.  I didn't have shallots, or onions and did it without it, it tasted great, and will use this again, when we have company.  Thanks

My family loved this meal.  I served it with herbed mashed potatoes and steamed broccoli.  I used pork loin to make the meaallions which really made it tender and instead of using the port wine I used an available shiraz.  Other than that I don't think I changed the recipe much at all.   Thanks so much for the recipe.

This is one spectacular meal!  My husband was so impressed.  We agreed it was worthy of going in the hallowed All-Stars Recipe box.  This recipe will be making star appearances for many special dinners.

Love this recipe.  It was quite labor intensive, but definitely worth it.  I will make this many times again ( just not on a busy weeknight).

I made this for my family's Christmas Eve dinner. I used a shiraz instead of port & red wine vinegar instead of white vinegar. I used Paula Deen's house seasoning to season my chops with & kept the sauce simmering on my stove until I was ready to serve. Then I just added the cornstarch slurry to thicken, poured it over my plated chops & served it w/ Christmas Cinnamon Pears as a starter,  Sweet Green Bundles, Mashed Potatoes, the Shiraz & Eggnog Gelatin Mold for dessert. Everyone (from my year old granddaugher to her picky mother) loved this dish...thnaks!

This recipe was fantastic! I made this as part of a romantic dinner and we were just wowed by it. Also a winner if you have company. Made one change: regular Merlot wine instead of port (we just happened to forget). Served this with garlic whipped potatoes topped with my own favorite side dish - fresh spinach sauteed in minced garlic and olive oil. My secret to great whipped potatoes: throw in a couple of chicken boullion cubes while they boil. Just heavenly... Will definitely make this recipe again!

I chose this for Christmas dinner and was pleased at how simple yet elegant it was. Perfect "fancy" dish for a relatively inexperienced cook!

This was excellent. My husband usually does not like sweeter pork dishes, but the port and vinegar in the sauce does cut the sweetness down.  I did find that the sauce was quite acidic so I added a bit of brown sugar to reduce the acidity.  The pork was tender and my only suggestion is to make sure that your shallots are really minced, it makes the sauce more smooth.

This was very good.  My only complaint was that the meat could have simmered with the sauce to absorb more of the flavor.  Being on Weight Watchers, I cooked 3 small pork chops and halved the sauce ingredients.

I really don't think I did anything wrong here, just too tart for my taste.  Maybe I didn't reduce the vinegar out long enough?  However, I have a similar way of cooking mushrooms in this kind of sauce.  To give it a more mellow taste, I add 1/2 + 1/2.

EXCELLENT and low in fat and calories! This one deserves five stars! My family loved it!  Used thick, lean boneless pork chops that I cut into 1/2" slices and smaller pieces and everything else exactly as the recipe said.  I think it would work to brown the pork pieces and make the sauce up to adding the thickening ahead of time (could be refrigerated and warmed up later).  Then warm pork in oven at low temp. in a covered dish to keep from drying out(add a tiny bit of water if pork looks dry) and while it is warming up, heat sauce and when hot, add thickening.  I served it with brown rice (cooked in "no-fuss" rice cooker) and steamed broccoli.

The pork was fine but I had to add ingredients to get the flavor up in the sauce. I did not have port so I used red wine. I also added Mango hot sauce and some cranberry horseradish to give it more heat and sweet. Excellent product in the end and gave it a more "chutney" flavor and texture.

Very easy to make! A wonderful recipe for the Fall. I didn't make any adjustments, though my sauce came out thicker than expected, it still tasted fine.

This was a pretty good recipe. I think I needed to reduce my sauce more than I did. I personally find the instructions to "reduce by half" hard to follow. I either get too much (too watery) or too little (too salty.)  And I can never get it perfect. It would be easier for me if it told how much sauce you should end up with in the end. Never-the-less, I will make it again because I think it has great potential.

VERY awesome! I tweaked it, mincing garlic with the shallots and I used a mixture of lambrusco and red cooking wine. I soaked the shallots and garlic in the Lambrusco and it turned out PHENOMENAL! I highly recommend it!

I loved this recipe.  I used boneless pork chops and a dry white wine as substitutes for what I didnt have.  I am sure the sweeter wine would add even more tang to the flavor and a stronger contrast of the vinegar and the sweet.  I also added some crushed garlic to the sauce.  Very tasty.. Thanks

Very good! The only thing I would do differently next time is add less pepper. It was too much for my taste. I also didn't have any Port so I used a combination of Sherry and Burgundy. I served it with mashed potatoes and green beans. Hubby said it was great!

Excellent pork dish.  I used ruby red port wine as I couldn't find a tawny port at the store; otherwise, I made it exactly as written.

Made this for my husband and I for Christmas dinner. We both loved it. A nice balance of sweetness and tartness but not overpowering. My only problem was letting the reduction go a bit too long so we could have used more sauce!

My family thought this was good and would like it again but they didn't rave about it like they do some of the others we've tried.  Thus the 4 stars (I save the 5 star rating for recipes that get "rave reviews.")  I wish there were a four and a half star rating because I personally feel it deserves more.  It was quick, easy and delicious.  I have enough of the sauce ingredients left over that we'll probably have it as a substitute for the usual ham glaze on our ham tomorrow night.  I recommend this one!  Thank you to the person who shared it!

Easy, wonderful presentationand tasted great.  Used this for my thanksgiving dinner as it was just my husband and I ( newly weds on a tight budget couldn't get home to either family).  We used beef medallions instead and it was wonderful.

I originally saw this in a Cooking Light magazine and made it for some dinner guests.  We're sauce people, so I doubled the sauce and thought that it was just right.  It was good, just nothing I'd make a again.

I made this dish for Valentine's Day because I wanted something special...Everyone -from my oldest teen to my pre-teen daughter loved it and asked for more.  It is so easy and elegant I plan to make it for company.  Note- I actually used  half the amount of balsamic and substituted cider vinegar to 
soften the flavor of the sauce.  I also used garlic instead of shallots. 
Served with green beans tossed with lemon juice and slivered almonds.

GREAT recipe; made this for friends and family. Just be careful with the pepper-- it's overwhelming and we didn't need as much as the recipe calls for.

My family rated this in the top 10 of all new recipes I tried out this year.  3 changes: I used a sprig of fresh thyme in stead of dried and I used red wine vinegar.  I cooked the cranberries in the chicken broth and left the cup of water out.  This saved some time reducing the sauce.  I served it with mash & green beans, as suggested by a previous reviewer.  Thank you, that was a good idea!

REALLY loved this one. The cranberries really make it, and happened to have some 'less sugar' craisins at home. I'll probably double the cornstarch slurry to thicken it a little more. We serve it with a portabella mushroom risotto - divine!

Full disclosure: I'm a real neophyte, very conservative when it comes to seasoning and preparation temperature. I had fresh, not dried cranberries, which I "dried" by baking on low heat for a couple of hours. (In retrospect, it occurs to me that this substitution robbed the dish of some taste-enhancing sugar.) And, oh yes, the main motivation for attempting this dish was simply to somehow use a really disappointing red wine.

it took me a lot longer to make than advertised, but then again I do cook at a snail's pace and used pork loin rather than medallions...but otherwise, this was SO TASTY.  served it with mashed cauliflower and a vegetable medley.

I'm not a big cranberry fan, but I'll make an exception for this dish. My wife and I both loved it! I made it exactly as the recipe said (well, my tenderloin was a bit over a pound, but no problem) and it came out great. Sweet, sour and tart all in one dish. And of course, pork tenderloin is an exceptional value.
