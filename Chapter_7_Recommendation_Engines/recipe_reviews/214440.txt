This was really tasty and easy to make!  I did change it by using only one bell pepper and one onion, which was more than plenty, I can't imagine using four bell peppers  and two onions, it would have been way too much!  I also used only 8 oz of the 16 oz jar of salsa, which seemed perfect to us.  I think it would have been even better with fresh salsa.  My husband loved it, we will be making it again!

This was so yummy! Pure comfort food. I was surprised at how flavorful it was since it has such simple ingredients. This is my new favorite way to eat smoked sausage! :)

Great recipe!  I added homemade sofrito and used Goya Adobo seasoning instead of italian seasoning.  Also added chopped cilantro at end for extra flavor.

I was looking for something fast for dinner and found this recipe.  I didn't have everything on hand (no yellow rice or red bell pepper) but it tasted great with white rice and the flavored sausage I had on hand.  In fact, my two picky kids even liked it.  My husband loved it.  So, looks like we'll be making again. Since the sausage I used was already flavored, I nixed the Italian seasoning; I thought it would have been overkill with the sausage and salsa spices.  I'll try to find yellow rice for next time though I may end up just using white rice again but cooking it with chicken broth to give it flavor.

I used a mild fresh salsa since I can't eat spicy.  I used low fat turkey sausage so that it was more Weight Watchers friendly. My husband and I both really enjoyed it and will making again!

This was delicious, I love spicy food. This was quick and easy too. I changed it up a bit by adding diced tomatoes, green chillies and a little bit of tomato sauce. Great spicy flavor even the picky  kids loved it.!! Will try and spice it up a bit next time..!!

Spicy Yellow Rice & Smoked Sausage Haiku: "Title's misleading. Depends on type of salsa. But it was still good." I was actually surprised that this turned out tasty (like a Southern stir-fry w/ the nice flavor and moisture addition of salsa - didn't really see the point to that tiny bit of Italian Seasoning, but I used it anyways.) Made mine w/ basmati rice (crushed a little saffron in it, in the hopes that it'd turn yellow, but oh well, rice is rice.) As salsa is pretty much the main flavor addition, I can only imagine that this recipe could be blah as can be, or kicky, or tame, all depending on what type of salsa one uses. The instructions and timing were pretty dead-on, so for a quick meal, I'd call it a success.

More of a 3.5 rating - this was good, but I think next time I'll work on the seasoning and use can tomoatoes instead of the salsa. Overall the meal was tasty.

I made this recipe so many times that we had to make a point to take a break from it. It's great if you're looking for something very quick and easy to make for dinner. The first time I made this I followed the recipe exactly and it was tasty, but I always find that recipes never have enough spice for my liking. Now I usually amp things up with a few jalapenos or cayenne peppers and only one bell pepper, and I usually throw some cajun seasoning into the yellow rice as it cooks. Using hot salsa of course adds more heat!
