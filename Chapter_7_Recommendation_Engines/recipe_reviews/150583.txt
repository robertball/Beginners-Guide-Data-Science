This soup is delicious and so simple.  I had not cooked with lentils before and I wanted to try them.  I love barley and the thought of having them together intrigued me.  A friend gave a bag of lentils to me and I found this recipe.  When I read it, it seemed too simple to be good.  However I read the reviews and saw most people didn’t change much.  I didn’t have any porcini mushrooms but I had a ton of sliced button mushrooms so I sautéed them in a little olive oil and put them in the soup.    I added a parsnip and a couple potatoes to make it heartier.  To my dismay I did not have sherry on hand so I added a tablespoon of balsamic vinegar which added a full bodied richness.   With a warm loaf of bread and a glass of good wine, this soup was a great comfort food on a cold winter night.  Thank you Diana for sharing!!!

I made this recipe using vegetable stock, which was absolutely delicious. I highly recommend doing that. But, there was one issue: I don't know if beef broth and vegetable broth heat differently, but 2 qts. of veggie broth were not NEARLY enough. I was basically making a stew with only 2 qts. So, I used 3 qts. which made a good, thick, hearty soup. That was as much room as I had in my pot. Next time, I'll use a large pot, and 4 qts. of veggie broth, and I'm sure that will be perfect!

I have to say this was one of the best soups I've made (and I make a lot of soups...)!  The thyme compliments the mushrooms perfectly.  I didn't have the dried mushrooms so sauted white button mushrooms instead.  I did end up adding some homeade noodles and extra stock as I wanted this to be a meal soup, which added nicely to the soup.

This was very good.  My husband ate it and complimented it, even though he doesn't like lentils or mushrooms!  I would have like more veggies in there, but I guess you can just add them to the recipe.

Great recipe!  Although I did tweak it a bit to incorporate the ingredients that I hand on hand...I made it in my crockpot, which is huge, so I doubled the recipe and reduced the amount of liquid as I wanted more of a stew-like consistency.  I also browned some ground beef to give it a little more flavor.  I used a package of button mushrooms and included a can of italian style stewed tomatoes.  This is a versitle recipe which is easily adaptable to what you have at home.  Very tasty...Yum-o!

I didn't add sherry. The soup was good, but I felt it lack of something. Probably a few drops of sherry would solve the problem. I live in the country side of Japan where it is a bit hard to find porcini and button mushrooms. I used Japanese mushrooms, such as shiitake and shimeji, though the soup tasted good.

This was a good soup.  It was easy to make, and my whole family liked it (including my three year old daughter).   I used low sodium vegetable broth instead of beef broth.  I also doubled the thyme and added one large parsnip for extra flavor.  This tasted great along side a pesto grilled cheese. It also tasted even better the next day (as most soups do).

This was pretty good, but I think I will alter the proportions a little next time I make it.  I think I'll want to use lots more carrots and celery and cut the lentils and barley down to 1/2 cup each.  It did have a very nice flavor though, and was just the thing for a cold-rainy Spring night!

Wonderful.  My entire family loved it.  Next time I'll have to double the recipe because it was gone to soon.

This was an easy recipe to cook and modify.  I added corn and used low salt vegetable broth because of my diet.  It is still very tasty and healthy at the same time.

Not bad - but I agree that the recipe needs much more broth to be a soup rather than a stew.  And it was a LOT of stew - I could probably feed a few families with what I ended up with!

This is really quite tasty! I made it in my crockpot; keep in mind that lentils and barley cook rather quickly. I used red lentils, which are very tiny, and they cooked VERY quickly, which made for a nice thick soup (as they dissolved) but if you would like a lentilly textured soup, try the recommended lentils. I doubled the thyme, and sherry, and bay leaf. Used a variety of dried, frozen and fresh mushrooms. The seasonings are what make this so great, so follow along with the recomendations. I also used a veggie bouillion, with a few drops of liquid smoke (use sparingly) to make up for the lack of beef bouillion. Slow cookers beware...this cooks up very fast (although the dried mushrooms take a bit longer), so this would not be a "prep in the a.m., eat in the p.m" kinda dish.

The family loved it!  Even my pickiest eater.  That was a surprise.  I changed it up by adding some browned stew meat and a can of diced tomatoes (drained).  I put the whole thing together on the stove and then threw it in the crock pot to finish for a couple hours.  I would totally make this again.

I made this soup with my home made beef stock and the flavor was amazing!  I love the combo of barley and mushrooms with the lentils.  That said, next time I'm going to use 1/2 the barley and more lentils.  That barley soaked up all of the liquid!  Very yummy recipe!

This is delicious! For those of you wary about dishes without meat not being good, try this! It's hearty and filling. If you really can't live without the meat you could add stew meat. I didn't have porcini mushrooms or sherry, but I don't think I missed out on much. I didn't have beef broth but I did have beef bouillon. I also added two bay leaves as I rather like bay leaves. I want to preserve this soup so I always have some handy.

Yum!!!  Used homemade chicken broth instead of beef and a barley/wild rice blend instead of just barley because that's what I had.

This is a very good lentil soup, and healthy, too! It really doesn't matter what kind of broth you use (chicken, beef, vegetable), it turns out well with any of them. Definitely making this again.

Very good soup!  I used veggie broth to veganize this, and a combo of portabellas and button mushroom because that's what I had on hand, and I also used green lentils and purple barley. It was the perfect soup for a chilly autumn evening, and I'll definitely make it again!

Very good soup.  I threw in a few left-over smoked pork ribs for a smokey flavor and protein.  Also added some brown rice for added texture and fiber. Increased the amount of liquid.

Fantastic! I used about a 1/2lb of chopped bacon and 1T of bacon dripping in place of olive oil. I didn't have porcini mushrooms or any sherry. I eye balled the amount of spices, and I err on the + side. 
Also added about 1 1/12T of minced garlic at the same time as the carrots.
Easy to make, taste great, very filling. Gotta love it.

Very good. Made it basically to the t except added a bit of frozen spinach and used less mushrooms because I didn't have that much. I also omitted the sherry because I didn't have it, and added the ever-crucial garlic. I also threw in a diced red skin potato to beef up the soup a bit. Quite tasty. The boyfriend went for seconds!

Very, very tasty and hearty recipe.  I also added some halved brussels sprouts with about 10 minutes left of cooking which were a good addition.  This soup was very thick, next time I'll probably use more like 2 1/2 quarts of broth instead of 2.

This is wonderful.  I had gotten lentils and barley at the market because they are so healthy, and I happen to have some frozen shitake mushrooms I added.  I only had the powdered beef stock, and it was still wonderful.  My husband is very picky and he loved it, too.  We usually don't share the same tastes because I like some hotter spices than he does, but finally a soup we agree on!  Thanks!!

I absolutely Love this soup! It's always the first one I make in the fall. It's very hearty and warm and you can't even tell that there isn't any meat in it! Definitely one for my permanent collection!

I used leeks instead of celery and fresh shredded carrots instead of canned.  I cooked everything except the mushrooms and zipped it through the blender when cooked.  I sauteed the mushrooms in sherry and added to the blended soup.  Delish.

Used fresh mushrooms instead of dry, vegetable broth instead of beef, and Marsala instead of regular sherry, which gave it a really rich sweet flavor. Make this all the time and LOVE it!

This is a great, easy soup to make. I changed it a little in that I added a parsnip, browned ground beef, sea salt, doubled the broth and added some tomato slices that we didn't use for another recipe. It came out wonderful! Family  ate it right up. 
This was a versatile recipe and very forgiving. Hearty and I have lunch for a few days!!

My husband gave this his best compliment and ate two bowls straight away.
I used freeze dried mushrooms and added some sliced carrots about 30 minutes before finish. I will make this again!

It is a DELICIOUS soup, I agree.  I did accidentally put in 2 tablespoons of sherry.  It was so thick, I did add another 2 cups of broth.  Everyone liked it!

I made this recipe on Nov 1 and my husband and I loved it!! I did not use button mushrooms as suggested. I replaced them with Baby Bella (baby portabella) mushrooms. I think the porcini mushrooms are key! If you can find them in your store definitely use them. Usually you can find them dried in packages. I'm out to go to the store so that I can make it again!

This is a very easy recipe to follow, and it does not take long to make!  I like more veggies than what this called for, so I tripled the amounts of carrots, and celery and added 2  14 oz cans of diced tomatoes.  It turned out really well.  I will certainly make it again and have been thinking of next time adding some ground turkey to it!

I love this soup!  Hearty and healthy.  I love carrots cooked in my soup and 2 was definitely not enough so I'd recommend 6.  
Other suggestions:
1. 2 celery stalks
2.  drain the porcini soaked water through cheese cloth before adding to the soup to prevent grit from getting into the soup.
3.  You can use veggie or chicken broth and still comes out great.  
4.  I didn't use the sherry but did add Worcesterhire sauce. (about a tablespoon).

Awesome!  Used mushroom broth (vegan) and added a sprig of rosemary and a tiny pinch of red pepper to wake it up.  Sautéed the onions and carrots in olive oil, added fresh garlic and baby Bella mushrooms, then toasted the lentils (green and black) before adding the mushroom broth. After 30 min added the barley and spices and cooked another 45 min.  AMAZING RESULTS!

Comfort food; that tasted even better the next day.
I did not have all the ingredients. 
So, I improvised:
white wine instead of sherry
vegetable broth instead of beef

Excellent soup!  Yes, had to make a few changes due only to not having on hand porcini mushrooms or sherry.  I used low sodium vegetable broth to make it vegetarian friendly for my daughter.  My two sons (non-vegetarian) loved it as well.  I'll make this again for sure.

I made a vegan, no oil version. I used "mock beef" broth, sauteed using some broth. Couldn't find fresh button mushrooms so I used regular white mushrooms and maybe just a wee bit more sherry than called for. This was so thick and so hearty, I plan to make it over and over this winter.  The porcini mushrooms lend a 'beefy' texture and I think I will soak them ahead of time in some mock broth, too. Served with our wonderful homemade bread, this is a new comfort meal!

If you love barley you will love this barley soup cooked with lentils. I mixed in a variety of fresh vegetables and added extra broth, much more than the recipe calls for.  It came out delicious.

This is a family favorite, sometimes to make it a really hearty meal, I first sauté some short ribs in the oil, then take them out when browned, follow the recipe and put them back in after the beef broth. Yum !!

I like this recipe but it definitely is slightly bland. I am not really a cook so I'm not sure what to add to liven it up. Instead of barley I used white rice to avoid the gluten. It has a great consistency I think it just needs some sort of kick.

I made this with chicken broth instead of beef, and it was delicious. I used only half the oil , added 2 cloves of chopped garlic and 2 stalks of celery. Very easy to make.I will try it with beef broth next time. Great soup!

My family loved this recipe. I did not have porcini mushrooms but I didn't miss them! It was delicious -- even to my pickiest eaters. I added leftover diced london broil to mine as well. Loved the heartiness of this recipe!

This soup was just delicious!  Simple, hearty, and flavorful. I followed another reviewer's recommendation and reduced the barley and lentils to 1/2 cup each, which I thought gave it the perfect consistency.  I was out of porcinis, so just substituted mushroom broth.  Will definitely make this again!

Pretty good soup.  I added quite a bit more thyme, pepper, and an extra bay leaf. Love barley, lentils and mushrooms.  This is a great combination.  Definately did not miss the beef.

Absolutely delicious!  This is the perfect soup to have on a cold fall day.  I made no changes to the recipe and will definitely make this soup again.  Thanks for the great recipe, Diana!

This was pretty good, just a traditional soup I guess.  Good flavor.  I used vegetable bouillon instead of chicken for vegetarian soup, and I skipped the olive oil, but the taste was the same I assume.  A good generic recipe.  Seemed like a lot of mushrooms in the recipe though... I didn't use as much.  And I couldn't find the specified mushroom in the recipe - I found the button ones but not the other kind.  Anyway, yeah, I'd recommend it as a good cold-weather recipe or whatever.

I loved the taste of this. I did have to alter it, becuase I didn't have some of the ingredients on hand. I didn't put in mushrooms, or sherry, and I substituted rice for the barley. It was still delicious. All of my children liked it except for my picky child, (he wouldn't try it because it had celery and onions in it.) I will make this again.

This soup left an add tast, maybe that of wine and cheese sausage.  I found the appearance unappealing and no need at all for the barley as lentils are incredibly fibrous as is.

Good base recipe. Left out the celery and added garlic, green peppers, and potatoes. Also, didn't have any beef broth, so I used veggie and added a few beef boullion cubes. Great versatile dish that can be ad-libbed depending on what's in the kitchen!

Just made this for my wife and I, it is a wonderful, hearty soup. My wife was surprised that I would eat it because I really like to have meat with every meal. I used shitake mushrooms instead of porcinni, other than that I didn't change a thing.
