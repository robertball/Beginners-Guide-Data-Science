We thought this was very good.  I did go short on the sugar to suit our personal preferences.  I'll make this again because it is a good side dish for a summer picnic!  Thanks, nancy!

I thought it was a bit too sweet, but still very good. I added a few teaspoons of lime juice to help cut down the sweetness. I would only use 1 T sugar next time.
