I've made this recipe several times already this summer, and it is delicious! The only change I made was not buttering the buns, and toasting them on the grill. The mayo combo is so good, I use it on other veggie sandwiches. Thanks for the great recipe.

DEEEEELICIOUS! The basil mayo makes this sandwich, and just puts it over the top. I used sliced portobello mushrooms because that's all the store had this week. I marinated them in the basalmic mixture for about an hour before cooking and they had a wonderful flavor. I did decrease the olive oil to about 2 tbsps. because I was trying to watch the fat and I used light mayo in the basil mayo with great results. This is a definate keeper! Thanks for sharing. :)

Delicious! Very satisfying on a hot summer night. The only changes I made were 1) to marinade the mushrooms in the vinegar/oil/garlic for 2 hours instead of just brushing it on before grilling. The mushrooms were very flavorful that way, and 2) to add a slight amount of cheese (pick your favorite) onto the mushrooms just before taking off the grill. I loved the mayo, and will look for other ways to use it!

Scrumptious!  I enjoyed mine exactly as the recipe was written; my husband and kids wanted to put some cheese on their mushrooms as they were grilling (Swiss).  High fives all around ... we will absolutely make again.  Thank you for the recipe!

Edit here ... I should have added that I did marinate the mushrooms for a couple of hours before grilling.   I think that helped a lot, an will deflinitely do it again next time, too, for sure.   Enjoy, enjoy everyone ... this recipe is a winner.  :-)

The best portobello sandwich I ever had! I served it on artisan bread, warm from the grill. I made bruschetta with the leftover bread and basil, but used that as the bun for my leftover portobellos. So it became a bruschetta portobello burger- heaven! This is a new summer grilling staple at our place. My three year old loved it, but he's an adventurous eater- as for my husband, he's a corn dog man, so this didn't exactly fly for him. But those with a love for gourmet will find this to be kickin!

WOW - these are fabulous! I love portobello mushrooms, so I had to give this a try. Plus they're so easy to put together. It's great for lunch or a quick weeknight meal. I would recommend marinating the mushrooms for a couple of hours vs. a few minutes. Don't skip the basil mayo, it's awesome! I used Hellman's light mayo and toasted some sesame seed rolls then added a slice of provolone along with the rest of the ingredients. These are so good, you'll never miss the meat!

I thought this was a great "burger"!  I have always loved portobello sandwiches and this was no different.  It was very easy to make, especially the smaller portobellos.  I'm not sure how to tell when the mushroom, especially the big ones, are fully cooked, so I think some of the big, thick ones didn't turn out as well as the smaller ones.  I would make these again, but I think next time I'll also marinate some red onions in the same sauce and throw them on the "burger".

This was easy, and delicious.  I've made it twice, exactly as written - no changes.  I toyed with the idea of adding a slice of melty cheese, but haven't yet.  I like the idea of a mostly vegan meal as I am exploring more meat-free dishes.  Really though, you almost think you are eating a savory piece of meat in this sandwich!  Thanks!

Great recipe! First time we made it we accidentally mixed all ingredients together and cooked the mushrooms in all of it instead of having the mayo mix on its own. They were actually better this way!

Wow. I almost didn't make the mayo as I don't typically put mayo on my burgers, but I think this added to perfection!  I made a lot more marinade mix than the recipe called for to help coat the top.

FANTASTIC!!! The balsamic/olive oil marinade on the portobellos is something I've done before and loved; but as absolutely simple as the basil mayo is, that is what takes this over the top. I added a slice of pepperjack and skipped buttering the buns. Will make again and again. Thanks :)

I didn't think it was possible, but this REALLY does have a steak flavor.  Delicious.  I am craving it again!  Even my son who doesn't like mushrooms enjoyed trying this.  Too bad they were all gone before he mustered his food courage and tried the last little nibble.

I've made portobello sandwiches for years and have to admit the basil mayo really puts a twist in them.  Am definitely keeping this as my new favorite way to serve them.  I didn't have any buns so used crusty Italian bread that I brushed with olive oil and toasted on the grill for a few minutes.  Outstanding!

I sized this down for two so it may have adjusted the taste. But i thought this was wonderful. The mushroom was juicy and the may was a perfect complement. I will make again.

Absolutley loved this one! I bought 2 huge portobello mushrooms to grill. The basil mayo rocks out....I used low fat mayo and fresh lemon juice and fresh basil....which I always think is key to get the best flavors....I served on a whole wheat sandwich thin (Arnold brand). Nice summer dinner! Thanks!

the sauce...mayo/basil/lemon was nice, everyone liked the sauce however the balsalmic vinegar did not go over. I've had much better portabello's and this wasn't one. I'd ditch the vinegar.

SO good and SO easy!!  I made this Saturday, and I liked it so much I am making it again tonight!  I took the advice of some other reviewers and marinated mine for about three hours.  The basil mayo is what really makes this five stars.  Thanks for sharing!!

I did not change any of the ingredients and it was delicious.  I will definitely make again.   I had never grilled a portabella before so checked on line and most articles said to peal the top skin off.  It came off so easy.  Since it was so large, I grilled each side 7 minutes and it was perfect.  I put the marinade on a half hour before grilling.

Excellent and fast!   I put basil leaves on the sandwich rather than chopping for the mayo.   Also added garlic salt  and fresh mozzarella.

Fantastic! I don't have a grill so I sauteed the mushrooms. It's a bit more messy but gets the job done. I also put this on homemade bread that I made in my bread machine and it was even better than the first time I made this recipe. Delish!

My husband and I just discovered the beauty that is the portobello when he ordered it at a restaurant a few months ago.  I made this tonight (scaled down for two people), and we both loved it- especially the basil mayo- that really made the sandwich!  The only thing I'll do different next time is to use less balsamic vinegar when marinating the mushrooms.  While we both love balsamic, we thought the flavor was a bit too overpowering.  Great recipe though, thanks!  I'm sure I'll make it again soon!

Delicious! I did sub red wine vinegar for the balsamic. I had one mushroom after a short marinade. Then I had two that were marinated for a few days. I preferred the longer marinated ones. I didn't serve on a roll this time but atop some field greens with EVOO, balsamic, sea salt, black pepper and assorted olives. Will definitely try on the roll another time. The basil mayo goes great with the mushrooms. Thank you for the recipe, Rotorwife!

This sandwich was very easy to make and has a perfect balance of flavors.  It is delicious.  Probably the best Portobello sandwich I have had.

I would give this 10 stars if I could! Fabulous! I've never touched a portobello mushroom (I don't even like mushrooms) but I am SO glad I tried this recipe. I let them marinate for a few hours as other reviewers suggested.

Next time I'll add more basil to the mayo mixture since I thought the basil flavor was really light.  Easy to make and quick to prepare!

Delicious!  Added roasted onions and red peppper along with some pepper jack cheese.  Just toasted the buns instead of butter and used FF Mayo.  Great meatless dinner!  My rolls were larger than hamburger buns, so next time I will cook more portabellas.

Unbelievably amazing!!! Love it! Also obsessed with the basil mayo- use it for everything! I like to grill chicken cutlets with a little salt and pepper and pair it with the mayo. This recipe is super easy to make and deliciously tasty. Highly recommend!

Followed recipe exactly and everyone flipped for it - including our usual "just meat & potatoes" men.  Next time, will double the sauce.

excellent, and very easy!  We halved the marinade and used 2 large portobello caps.  We used dried basil instead of fresh or the mayo as that's what we had (fresh would be yummy too).  I have a feeling we will be making this often.

Scrumptious. Added salt and pepper to the mushroom caps and to the mayo / dijon mixture.  I also used only about 1/4 cup of mayo but kept the other sauce proportions the same.  I prefer that the basil and dijon be stronger and less diluted.  Ate with provolone cheese.  Super tasty and a good deviation from the norm. I'll definitely make this again!

This was amazing! I have made marinated portobellos before, and the vinegar was overwhelming - this was just right!  I marinated the portobellos for an hour, then pan-fried them with 1 Tbl. olive oil (covered) for about 6 minutes on each side, then sprinkled with a little bit of salt.  I left off the butter on the rolls because I didn't think it was necessary (and is just added fat).  The basil-mayonnaise was the perfect touch.  Thanks for the recipe!

I cooked these inside on the skillet since DH wasn't home from work yet and he is the grill master.  They turned out great.  I did marinate for about 15 minutes.

The sauce definetly makes this burger.  I am allergic to mustard so I used worcheshire sauce and I didn't have any lemon juice so I just threw in some fresh lemon basil.  Tasted great!

These were soooo good! I cooked the mushrooms in a pan for lack of a grill. I also threw in some baby bell peppers which were a perfect accompaniment.

This sounded SO good.  I think I should have read the other reviews first.  I think the Portobello's should defiantly marinate.  I did not marinate them and there wasn't enough flavor.  But the Basil Mayo is FANTASTIC!  I put a little black pepper in it and it was that much better. I am going to find different ways to use it (YUMMY).  

I am going to try this recipe again but next time I am going to try slicing the Portobellos and marinating them a lot longer so they soak up the marinade.  Plus I think adding a little salt to the marinade would really bring out the flavors.

Sauce was very good. I used a little less vinegar in the marinade and added some sea salt and ground pepper. Topped mushroom with mozzarella and red onion and tomato. It is amazing how much this sandwich fills you up. Could eat these all summer long.

Wow, so good!  I added a bit of minced garlic to the mayo mixture, skipped grilling the buns and subbed roasted red peppers and mozzarella for the lettuce and tomato.  Couldn't believe what a quick and delicious meal this was - thanks!

This was great! Made no changes just additions, we added fresh mozzarella slices, warmed roasted peppers and grilled asparagus and red onion. Even my skeptical husband enjoyed it!

Loved the flavor!! I had trouble getting the mushrooms to soften on the grill. Cooked them a whole lot longer than recipe calls for.  Not sure what the secret is... All that said, will definitely make them again ??

Loved this recipe! Easy and yummy. Served them on sour dough bread (that's what I had) still yum. If I had to change anything, I would maybe add a little more fresh basil to the "dressing" but that's just a preference.

If you peel the outer layer of skin off of the larger portobello it is easier to eat.

Will definitely make again!  Excellent flavors!  Didn't measure anything for mayo.  Went a little heavy on basil-but I'll do it the same way next time.

Used a cast iron stovetop grill and added some spinach, which was also heated beside the P-burger

Awesome!!  Followed the recipe, but left off the bun.  So easy for hot summer nights when no one wants to cook.  Did marinate the mushrooms for about an hour before grilling them.

I used this recipe, but I only made 2 extra large mushrooms since I'm the only fan.  I used 1/2 tsp. dried basil because that's what I had on hand, and I made it on my stove top grill pan.  Since I'm doing the keto diet, I put one atop a low carb fajita with the mayo, tomato, and lettuce and ate it like an open-faced sandwich, sloppy but all the flavors were there.  I plan to use the leftover marinade and mayo with some leftover sliced steak on a fajita.  I will make this again.

Live in a Senior appartment so didnt have access to a grill. 
I put olive oil in a skillet and cooked the portabella that way. 
Husband even loved it.

Made this exactly as written.  My BF had never had grilled portobello mushrooms so was a bit skeptical and loved them.  When I asked him if he would eat it again, "Most definitely" were his words.  I would, however, add a touch of salt after putting the tomato slices on.

This burger is out of this world! I've made it as written as well as with veganaise in place of mayo and it was great both ways! The marinade for the portobello mushroom is buttery and tangy! The Basil Mayo spread is so good we put it on our burgers, grilled corn and even baked potatoes. It's so light and the fresh basil adds a little something special. Better than any restaurant  Portobello burger I've had. Thank you! This one's a keeper!

This recipe is awesome.  The mayo-based sauce is savory and tangy.  I followed the recipe exactly and even toasted the buns on the grill.  I will definitely make this again!

Mushrooms w/marinade was really good. Too much mayo for my taste in the basil mayonnaise. Next time I'll cut the mayo in 1/2.

My family loved this recipe. The dressing is so good and really makes the sandwich tasty. I wanted to make it again tonight!
