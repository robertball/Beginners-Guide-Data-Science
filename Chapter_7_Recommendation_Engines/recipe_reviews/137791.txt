I made this last night for my family. The talapia and asparagus was very good but my suggestion for the sauce would be to allow your guests to put the sauce on themselves.  It has a very strong flavor and very little is needed for the fish.  Enjoy, Rosanne

I was very disappointed in this recipe.  I could have made something better with my tilapia. the asparagus didn't get done in the length of time it took for the fish to cook, so was very crunchy, and i just didn't like how intense the flavor of the sauce was.  sorry!

Definite potential...sauce was too strong so I didn't use it..so in fear of dry fish, I opened the oven, took out the pan of fish and asparagus and added a little olive oil, some garlic powder and a little more salt/pepper...and topped off with fresh greated parmasean cheese. put back in the oven and it came out great! Really filling!!

I made this last night.  Made a real nice meal, without being heavy.  I served it with wild rice as a side.  Flavor was great.   I'm going to try some other ways of using both ingredients and different flavors.

I would actually only give this recipe 3.5 stars. I didn't have asparagus but I really wanted to try the sauce, which turned out pretty good under these conditions:

Use a sweeter white wine
Keep the sauce thin, between an aus ju and a thin syrup
The sauce comes out very strong, so use sparingly

I thought this was ok. The sauces was not anything I would want to make again. My husband, who likes just about everything involving fish wanted me to go rinse his food off.

This recipe was not good.  The fish and asparagus cooked well, but the sauce was too tangy and did not go with the meal.

I love the flavor combination, and doubled the sauce quantity. I used four asparagus spears per person, as we love it and usually eat five each. That said, the fish was cooked well before the asparagus was even close. I opened the foil after ten minutes, then at fifteen poured wine into the pan to steam things. Overall, cooked for 30 minutes and asparagus was still very crunchy.

I like this.  Even my very picky husband liked the sauce.  However use the sauce sparingly.  Thanks!

I buy those 4 pack's of white wine. I added 1/2 bottle of wine on the bottom then on top i put the goat cheese very loghtly up and down the fish than do the same with green chili's. I use only two piece's of the fish. With four piece's i use the whole bottle of white wine. My friend's rave about this.

I loved the spicy sauce!   The next time I would make the asparagus crispy first by placing it in a hot oven for 6-10 minutes.  After pouring the sauce over the fish, I then added the riveto the sauce pot to capture all that spiciness!

Lemon sauce needs to be replaced. Maybe a pat of butter on the asparagus for each wrap.
