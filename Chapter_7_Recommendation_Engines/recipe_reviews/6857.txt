Be sure to use fresh peppers (not the jarred variety) and instead of shredding the cheese, put the cheese in during the last half of kneading and use cubes of cheese.  The cheese does not seem to disappear into the bread if you do it this way. Good bread!

I love jalapeno cheese bread -it's the best!  And this recipe is a great version of it.  Since I don't have a bread maching, I made some adjustments to make it by hand.  I used a yeast starter (combining the sugar, warm water, and yeast in a bowl and let it sit for ten minutes) and then combined the flour and salt in a bowl and slowly added the starter to it, mixing as I went.  I added a little flour in order to make the dough a nice soft consistency as I kneaded.  I let it rise in an oiled bowl for about 45 minutes and then punched it down, added fresh and pickled jalapenos plus 3 different types of cheese, all cubed.  I put it in an oiled bread pan, and let it slightly rise again for about 20 minutes.  I then baked it in the over and it turned out beautifully browned and fluffy white in the middle.  Gorgeous and yummy!  We ate 2/3 of the loaf as soon as it came out of the oven!

The BEST bread machine bread ever! It was delicious. I cut up my pepper jack cheese so that it was in cubes. Used more cheese than recipe calls for (3/4 cup) and glass jar jalapenos. I will keep tweaking because the cheese still melts into the bread & I want to be able to bite into a chunk. Thanks so much for this recipe!

As I'm eating this all I can say is FABULOUS Recipe!!  I've been making bread for years and years but this one is amazing.  Worthy of printing and putting in my favorite recipe book.

I used 4 large peppers and a large handful of cheese.  Turned out amazing!   This one is a keeper!

Well,so far it doesn't look too good. I'll update if this changes, but with 25 minutes left the bread has sunk, and I've never had that happen. Not sure what is going on, but will update, either way!

I love this bread!!! Thank you so much. 
The only thing I can add was, I cut my jalapenos into circles, kept seeds intact. the larger circles, I cut in half. I used two good size jalapenos. I also kept my cheese cubed and did not use any shredded. I also used Mild cheddar. The crust is very good, you can taste the cheese in it. Thank you so much!! I will be making this for my husbands sandwiches from now on!

The flavor is wonderful, but it didn't cook all the way through in the middle.  I think next time I will bake it in the oven instead of the bread machine.

Great for traditional bread making (i.e., no bread machine).  I used canned jalapenos and replaced about 3/4 or the water with Jalapeno juice.  Otherwise, I follow the recipe as stated.   Great!  Not a burn your mouth hot, but very very tasty!

The bread needed some more "taste" besides just the jalapeno - and the cheese didn't really add anything...just melted into the bread, really.

Wonderful!!!!  I used half Monterey Jack and half sharp Cheddar (cubed).  I think the cheddar helped with the lack of cheese flavor that other reviewers were complaining about.  I also used some leftover peppers we had in the freezer (I think they were hot banana peppers) instead of Jalapenos and the spice level was perfect (I like a pretty good kick)!  So far it's been a big hit with everyone that has tried it.  We will definitely make this one again.

This breads is excellent.  I did what other reviewers did as well leaving the cheese in chunks instead of shredding.  The huge problem is you can't stop eating it!

Me and my fiancee LOVE spicy things and this bread was PERFECT.  Not too spicy, just a bit of a bite.  Of course, I tweaked this recipe a little bit myself.  I used a 4oz jar of chopped jalapenos which actually came to just over 6 TBS called for in the recipe. I had drained the jalapeno juice into a measuring cup and then added enough water to meet what was called for in the recipe.  I set my machine to Basic, XL and light crust setting.  I forgot the monterey jack cheese at the store and used some cheddar I had on hand.  This bread came out GREAT.  Jalapeno flavor, a tiny bit of bite and it's perfect to add some flavor to sandwhiches.  This bread will be made over and over and over...

As for the quickness and kid friendly options, its a bread machine, so I fiqure that should be self explanatory.

I loved this bread, although I used a little less jalapeno's and more cheese, it tasted wonderful.  I am sure to make it again.  Even my finicky husband loved it.

This bread was supper easy to make. I used cheddar cheese, because I didn't have monterey jack and it was still yummy. Also, once the bread had risen, I topped the bread with some jalapeno slices and cheese. Next time I'm going to use more jalepenos. This was so delicious!

Maybe I'm just not a jalapeno bread type person, but I found this bread to be bland and unremarkable.  The spice level was good, but I won't be making again.

This bread was good and flavorful, but not very spicy.  My two-year old ate it with no problem.  I think next time I'll add more jalapenos.

This would have been 5 stars if I had used the amount of Jalapeno called for, but I chickened out. I also cubed the Monterrey jack cheese with good results. This is a delicious, easy bread machine recipe.

Since i am vegan i adjusted the recipe a bit i used almond milk, more jalapeno peppers, cane sugar, and daiya pepper jack and cheddar cheese. It came out so delicious my granddaughters ages 8 and 2 went crazy for it now I'm about to make another loaf or 2.

Picked up a big Oster bread maker at the thrift store for 8 bucks. First recipe I found online (not here) was not great. Started thinking "hmm probably why it was 8 bucks."

Followed up with this one, changed nothing and it came out PERFECT! My little house had the added benefit of smelling like a little corner of heaven for two full hours.

Congratulations Chef on this one!

My all time favorite bread recipe!! i make this at least once every week. I do the dough in my bread maker and add small chunks of cheese (aged chedder and regular cheddar) in after the dough is complete and bake it in my oven. Another variation is to add fried red onions. Fantastic toasted with butter or for grilled cheese. I've even toasted up cubes of the bread and served it with a warm dip to many compliments.

Added 1 1/4 cup cubed aged white cheddar and doubled the jalapeños to the second knead.  To make sure cheese and peppers were evenly distributed I flipped the dough ball upside down and then let it bake.  Fantastic!!!! I will make another tomorrow just to have for sandwiches!!! Flavorful, soft on top, crusty on sides and spicy as hell

I've been looking for recipes to use all the jalapeños coming from my garden and this sounded good.  The only change I made was the type of cheese.  I didn't have Monterey jack on hand, so I used a little cheddar along with some smoked Gouda.  My bread machine conked out and the paddle started turning during the baking process, leaving a large cavity inside the bread. Thankfully I was able to salvage quite a bit of the loaf and finish baking it in the oven.  Quite tasty!  I served it with the Tex Mex Corn Chowder on this site.

I tried this recipe with my new bread machine. I took other advice and added 3/4 cup of cheese i had a blend of monterey jack and cheddar. I just thought the salt was less. I could have added 11/2 teaspoon. But next time Overall the bread was fluffy, light, flavoured just enough with peppers. This is a keeper.

I normally don't like jalapenos, but this is great.  Moist, and just the right amount of spicyness.  Next time I think I will put in small chunks of cheese though instead of shredded for a bit of creamyness.

We love this bread!  I used a small can of diced jalapenos, which was a little more than the recipe called for but I'm so glad I used it all as it had just the right amount of kick.  Used pepper jack instead of monterey jack, but followed the rest of the recipe as written.  DH made great ham sandwiches with the bread.  It's also good toasted, and it makes an awesome grilled cheese sandwich.  Thanks for sharing.

The bread had a great consistancy and crust but, thats about it! I added about 4 extra tablespoons of jalapenos and still no spice or any jalapeno flavor, I added pepperjack cheese and cheddar, and no sign of cheese. This loaf also lacked salt. It's a great basic, but addd way more mix ins to it!

My husband and I loved this bread.  It makes a great grilled cheese sandwich.  I didn't have fresh jalaeno's, so I just used some pickled ones (3 TBS). Thanks for this great recipe, it will be used often in my house.

Mmm, quite good.  Not too hot, but it has a bite.  My machine on the regular setting overcooked this a little, so just a note, may want to watch it in yours.  I also tried cubing the cheese instead of grating it, but I didn't get the occasional gooey bite like I wanted.  Well, I'll be making this again, and try something different then.

Co-workers specifically asked me to bring Jalapeno cheese bread.  Although I cannot eat jalapenos and did not try this myself, everyone who tried it raved and came back for more...it was the first loaf to disappear at the "bread party."  I did add about 1 tablespoon more jalapenos and tried using cubes of cheese added during the last kneading cycle, but the cheese still disappeared into the dough.

I loved the flavor of this bread - spicy and a little cheesy. It was great toasted with some cream cheese. I followed other suggestions and added extra jalapenos (about 8 T total) and 1 C of cheese. My loaf rose pretty well but was concave on top. I'm not sure if that was a fault of the recipe, my changes, or my yeast, but despite that I'll be making this again!

I thought this was practically perfect!  I just harvested my first batch of jalepenos from my garden, and was looking for something different to do with them.  I chopped them extra-extra fine and used the Kraft cheddar-monterey jack crumbles, and that seemed to work great.  The loaf was beautiful, a lovely golden color with a perfect texture and a crispy crust.  I'll be making this a lot.

My mother requested this bread. I used a combo of cheddar and jack cheeses and I waited until second dough cycle to add them. I was very pleased with the results. Next time I will use more jalepenos. Don't forget to wear gloves when chopping fresh jalepenos!!

Yummmmm-EE!!!  I made this loaf for my Dad.  We just tried some and boy, it's soo good!  It has a very good jalapeno flavor with just a little spiciness.  I added just a little extra cheese and i think that made the loaf sink in a little on the top, but it still turned out very tasty!  I will make this often!

Didn't rise as high as I would have liked
(and I use Best for Bread Flour) - might try
a little more yeast.  It is very good and
looking forward to having it as a sandwich
tomorrow. Will certainly make it again!!

This bread is amazing! I used Monterey jack/cheddar cubes and the jarred jalapeños and it turned out wonderful! It is much better than the store  bakery! My husband is so happy he always would buy it when he went to the store and this is so much better! Thanks for a great recipe!

Since I wanted to use my new KA, I didn't use my bread machine. I put all dry ingredients in, along with my instant  yeast (substituted same amount as active dry), and added water, cheddar, mozzarella, and Monterey 1/4" cheese cubes, and the diced jalapeños (about 7 tbsp). I used the dough attachment and finished dough by putting on flour-dusted counter and kneaded for 30 seconds. I sprayed a glass bowl with oil and placed dough in, and cling wrap on top. I let that rise for 50 minutes in microwave (obviously off). When I came back to it, I put it back on dusted counter, cut it in 4, and put each fourth in one mini loaf pan. Put more wrap and put back in microwave. 20 minutes later I shredded more cheese and cut jalapeños slices for top and put loaves in oven 350°. Done in 30 minutes. Beautiful, I will start to make every time we have extra jalepenos. Also I highly recommend putting grated cheese and extra jalepenos overtop=delicious crust. Hope this helps others that don't want to/can't use bread machine. P.S. this was my first time making it, I looked at a lot of reviews and altered my recipe this way.

Love the bread. Used my machine to mix it, but baked in the oven. Doesn't rise as well as my other breads, bit still great tasting. I use Pepper Jack Cheese with 2 finely chopped fresh jalapenos. Tastes great toasted with butter.

Very good and easy to make. I substituted 1 c. of bread flour with 1 c. whole wheat to make it a little healthier and used cheddar cheese instead. No issues with the bread not being cooked in the middle or sinking.Great texture and flavor.

i made the hottest jalapeno bread EVER using the jarred sliced peppers! i substituted 1cup water and salt for just over 3/4 jalapeno juice! then made up the missing 1/4 cup of liquid by slowly adding jalapenos until the constancy was correct! (i set my machine to fruit&nut) i also added a few cubes of jack cheese and peppers to the top just after it started baking!  if you like FIRE try it!

My whole family loved it.  I didn't let any seeds into it so it just had the jalapeno flavor, my kids even liked it.  It comes out perfect every time.

This was fantastic. I did alter the recipe by adding a healthy dollop of sour cream and went for a full teaspoon of yeast. It turned out a bit more moist and fluffier than the first batch, which makes it a bit more ideal for sandwiches.

I'm made many jalapeno cheese breads in the past and this one was not one of my favorites.  The monterrey jack cheese lends very little flavor to the bread.  I used other reviewer's suggestions and cubed it instead of shredding it, and it still just disappeared into the bread and the end result basically tasted like jalapeno bread, not jalapeno cheese bread.  I used 6 heaping tablespoons of freshly chopped jalapenos and it was not spicy at all - not even a little bit.  It rose nicely in the machine and had a nice texture and crust, but was not at all what I was hoping for.  I will not be making this particular recipe again.  If you do try it, I'm sure cheddar is a much better choice.  Good luck!

This bread was good and had a great texture.  I thought it could have used a stronger jalapeno taste.  Next time I will add even more fresh jalapenos.  I also took the advice of some who said to add the cheese in cubes after rising.  I did and all the cheese wound up on the bottom of the loaf and none in the middle at all.  Next time I will just add it as the recipe states.

I had read all the reviews and was excited to try this recipe. I added everything per manufacture except the cheese and the jalapenos (I used 5 large jalapenos leaving the ribs in, just taking out the seeds) until the very last kneading process. The resulting product tasted almost exactly like a loaf of white bread. I was expecting not to taste much cheese but was will to work on it if it had a nice kick to it. But, after eating this I don't think I'll be trying to tweak this at all.

This bread was kind of unremarkable. I used 1/3 cup of fresh jalapenos from the garden and nearly tripled the amount of cheese but there wasn't a lot of flavor. I made it by hand and it turned out a pretty loaf with a nice texture, but there was no heat and hardly any cheese flavor.

I will definately have to try this again because I did not have enough jalapenos.  One jalapeno yielded about 3 tablespoons.  I tried to make up for that by chopping up a green pepper to make up the difference and adding cayenne to make it spicy...no good.  It wasn't spicy at all. So that said, I will try one more time with enough peppers, eventually - no rush.Update!  Tried it again with all of the necessary jalapenos and it became a rock...grrrr...okay, this one is not for me.
