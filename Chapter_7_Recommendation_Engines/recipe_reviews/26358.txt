This is a great recipe, but can be made a lot easier with a couple of modifications.  I would recommend substituing chicken broth for the water and not use the chicken soup base.  Chicken soup base creates a more artificial flavor.  Boil the chicken in the chicken broth.  Instead of a whole chicken, I cut boneless skinless chicken breasts into pieces.  After boiling the chicken in the broth for 1/2 hour, add the other ingredients already chopped (onion, bay leaves, peppercorns, celery, carrots -- I didn't put in the lemon grass) and cook for 1 more hour.  Then add the noodles and the celery leaves and cook until the noodles are done.  The whole pot can remain heating on the stove on low until your guests arrive.  I upped the recipe to serve 30 people and it worked great!

This is the perfect Chicken Noodle Soup Recipe.  Really it is the homemade chicken broth that makes it!  FYI the Chicken Soup Base is the boullion granules.  Our grocery carries it in 4 oz. containers, the recipe calls for 2 oz. or 4T to make measurement easy.  The boullion adds salt/herbs and a little more flavor.  You could also use Vegetable Base if you have it on hand or the store is out of Chicken.  My husband is sick and he had two bowls, hopefully he'll be feeling better in the morning.  If you are looking for a Chicken Noodle soup recipe and you have the time to put into it look no further this is the one!!  Oh, one last thing, don't skip the lemon grass it is a really special addition.  If you have not purchased it or used it before here are some tips: it is a tough green stalk, looks like a pale thicker version of a green onion and is usually sold individually.  Peel the outer couple layers because they are likely dry and tired and then slice much like a green onion (cut off the hard end first).  It is hard, even after cooking and not so great to eat/chew so remember to strain with the other ingredients.  Hmmm...it really rounds out the flavors.

This recipe is delicious, but takes MEGA time! The directions are also a bit confusing and I was not sure what "Chicken Base" was. So I finally found something that is called "Better than Bouillon" that is basically a bouillon cube type product which is almost a liquid, it is kind of like paste. It was not clear if you are supposed to use 1/4 cup of that in its pure form or 1/4 of the prepared broth. After tasting it was clear it calls for 1/4 cup of the pure bouillon paste which is essentially chicken flavored salt. I also used "no yolk" egg noodles and you can't even tell the difference and there is a lot less cholesterol. Good stuff my family loved this!

i make chicken soup all the time and this is very similar to mine, however most people are correct when talking about the noodles. Never cook in the broth, always cook them seperatly and add only the amount you want in your individual bowls to save on broth, then just fridge the noodles and reheat with leftover soup as needed.  also, we ALWAYS with any homemade soup grate lots of ramano or parmesan cheese on top for a delicious salty and pefect topping to the homemade soup.  you won't be dissapointed doing this!!!

YUUUMMMMMMY!!  Just like my Mom used to make.  My children loved this!  Try cooking the noodles before adding them to the soup, as they consume a lot of the broth.  For the chicken base, I like to use "Wyler's chicken (garlic & herb) Shakers" it isn't as salty as other types.  Good recipe!  Thank you Alan!

A good, basic chicken soup recipe.  We enjoyed it for dinner, and I froze the rest (without noodles) for dinner another night.  Another reviewer mentioned the noodles seeming to be too much.  That may be bacause the soup was allowed to stand too long before serving.  Noodles or rice in soup will continue to absorb liquid and grow in size if allowed to stand too long.

I loved this recipe even though there really aren’t any short-cuts to this recipe and it can be time consuming. Like some other reviewers, I boiled the chicken the night before and made the soup the next day—it was much easier to skim off the fat since the broth was refrigerated over night and also much easier to pull the meat from the bone when the chicken isn’t hot! Also, I cooked the soup using a slow-cooker the next day so it really took me a while!
After reading the reviews it appears some people are confused about the use of celery and carrots twice. It’s better to think of this recipe in two stages—making of the broth and making of the soup. You add celery and carrots at first to make the broth (boil the chicken) and discard everything except the chicken and the liquid after you are done. Later, you add chopped (bite-sized) celery and carrots to the broth to make the soup.

I read almost all the reviews and I used the following suggestions:
1. Cooked the noodles separately (if you cooked it in the broth you would end up with chicken noodle casserole as noodles soak up a lot of liquid)
2. Used ¼ cup of “Better than Bouillon” chicken base paste (the broth itself is not strong enough without the base).
3. The broth is just as delicious without the lemon grass (depending on the time of the year, it’s hard to find lemon grass even in Asian grocery stores).
4. Used couple of cloves of fresh garlic and few sprigs of parsley for the soup.

This soup was awesome!  My family absolutely loved this (even the picky ones).   It's a bit time consuming but certainly worth it.   Actually, I did the broth one night and stored it in the refrigerator.   The next evening I skimmed off the fat (much easier when the broth is cold) and finished off the recipe.   I added 2 cloves of finely chopped garlic to the broth.   Also, my family doesn't eat broth (don't ask me why) so I doubled the noodles which soaked up all the yummy broth.   It actually turned out as chicken noodles rather than soup.   They still loved it, though.

The whole neighborhood loved it. I added 1/2 cup white wine to de-glaze the chicken pan. I slighly braised chicken breasts (that's all I used) before cutting and adding to final mixture. GREAT!

Great Soup on a cold winters day! The only changes I made was I added some chicken breast (which I precooked), instead of the lemon grass I added some lemon juice at the end, I also add some fresh ginger which realy kicks it up.

The addition of lemongrass to this chicken noodle soup was wonderful - gives it a fresh taste with just a tiny bit of a bite.  I used Better than Bouillon as opposed to powdered bouillon, and it turned out great.  Additionally, I cooked the chicken whole for one hour with thyme, garlic, pepper, onion, carrots, celery, and a bit of salt.  Then, I threw those veggies out (they were soggy after cooking for an hour and I just wanted them for the flavor) and pulled the meat off the bone.  I put the meat to the side.  I chopped fresh carrots and celery and cooked them in the stock until tender.  Then, I added the noodles, cooked until done, and put the chicken back in the soup last.  I find that this helps me to keep my chicken from getting stringy from overcooking.  Wonderful soup!

Great and easy start to a yummy homemade soup. One change that really kicks up the flavor is using an already cook Rotisserie Chicken from the deli section of a grocery store. Peel off the skin and boil whole carcus in the water with all same same fixings as in the recipe.  YUMMY!

I made this recipe with a store-bought rotisserie chicken. I have had a sore throat and chicken noodle soup was all I could think about yesterday. I forgot the lemongrass, unfortunately b/c I think that would have put this over the top!  I used two cubes of bouillon and left the noodles out, to be added as desired. The first thing my boyfriend said was that it's restaurant quality and after the meal he said it is definitely one of his new favorite meals of mine. My daughter eagerly slurped it up and I felt better. Win-win-win. Wonderful chicken noodle soup.

i used thigh's with the skin,,, that's where the flavor comes from, the skin and bones,, i also use chicken breast,. I think most of these recipes give you ideas of what you should do,, so if you think you need more pepper then what the recipe calls for you, add it,,it's all about your taste,,this was a very good recipe,,the only other thing i add,,, always add when having chicken ,is Thyme,,it does the trick. nice job Alan!

I followed this recipe the way it is written but used "Better than Bouillon" instead of the bouillon.  I also cooked the egg noodles separately and left them firm and added toward the end.  It was delicious!  My first homemade chicken noodle soup, and I am sticking with this recipe!!

Whenever I bake a chicken, the next day I make this soup with the leftovers.  I love chicken soup, but I hated all the "stuff" found in my fathers chicken soup (bits of onion, overwhelming amounts of celery, spices galore).  This recipie has the flavor of my fathers soup but lacks all of those little bits I could not stand.  I scale it down to 4 servings.  The change I made pertains to the 4 serving recipie.  I use 1/2 of a lemons juice instead of lemon grass, which is not available near me.  I also use spaghetti broken in thirds instead of egg noodles.  This soup is so tasty.  The broth is a lovely golden color.  This soup is worth the time invested.  Thank you Alan, for submitting this recipie.

I made a pot of this for a sick friend and made the "mistake" of giving a bowl of it to my husband before taking it to her.  He liked it so
much, I had to do it all over again the next day.
Teenagers loved it, too...they even ate the veggies!  Used Muellers fine egg noodles and the
soup base that comes in paste form.

Very good. I used 3 boneless chicken breasts, so probably would taste better with entire chicken carcass, but the breasts keep it low fat. I also added white wine to soup when cooking. I cooked my noodles separately as suggested by others. Didn't have lemongrass, but added a squeeze of lemon juice while making stock. Great diet-friendly dish!

Excellent and easy.  To make this soup quicker, I buy a routiserie chicken from the grocery store already cooked, pull it apart and put in in my soup along with the veggies.  I let it cook about 30-45 minutes, put the noodles in and it's done in less than an hour.   Excellent tasting soup.  This one is a house favorite!

I always loved this soup when I ate at a restaurant. My kids when they were babies, it was the only thing they would eat in a restaurant after I mash it. Then I found this recipe and I tried it for a gathering at my house. Everyone loved it so much and said it is as good as the one that we eat at that restaurant. My daughter never eats soup, but she ate that one two days in a row and took it to school too.

I did not care for this recipe. I thought, "Give it a shot, everyone else seems to rave about it." What happens when you simmer all your flavors together for hours is that you can no longer distinguish any flavors and everything turns the same bland color.  On the other hand, if you would like to taste something delicious (or really taste anything) at the end of your two hours labor in the kitchen and actually enjoy your food, this is absolutely NOT the recipe for you.

When your kids keep saying "this soup is good!" and "I love this soup Mommy" you have to give the recipe 5 stars.  I used a low sodium version of "Better Than Boullion" and 3lbs of chicken breasts (on the bone and with the skin).   I opted to cook my noodles separately so I didn't soak up too much of the broth.  This is a keeper, no doubt about it.

This is a fabulous soup.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars was that it is a bit time consuming for the average cook.  I noticed that a lot of people are confused about the ingredients.  The 1st group is for making the broth - the only part you keep is the chicken that has been picked clean of bones and skin.  I also recommend leaving the lemon grass whole or cut it into 1 or 2 inch lengths since you need to discard that also.  I used low sodium broth instead of the bouillon (1 cup) and also added crushed garlic.

I have made this recipe several times and it always gets rave reviews.  The time it takes is definitely worth the outcome.  I use 16 oz of noodles and always boil them separately as they soak up too much broth as it is.   I also trim the fat from the chicken before boiling to make the whole process easier and healthier.  Thanks Alan for a wonderful tasting, nutritious dinner that my incredibly picky boyfriend even adores!

I don't understand how people give recipes 5 stars when they are only truly a 3 or a 4 at best.  Perhaps in my opinion recipes only deserve a 5 if they are exceptional.  This is a very good starter recipe for a homemade chicken noodle soup, but it certainly didn't WOW my tastebuds.  This recipe does take quite awhile to prepare - but nearly all homemade soups do!  To save a little time, I recommend asking your butcher to remove the skin and cut the chicken into pieces for you... 1) the chicken will cook much faster  2)you will not have to remove the skin once the chicken is cooked - and it won't make the broth greasy from all the fat!!!  3) the chicken will cool down sooner and it will be easier to remove the meat and discard the bones.  I did not have chicken soup base, so I used a few bullion cubes instead... if you do this, be warned the broth will still be a bit bland and you will need to add some salt and freshly ground black pepper to liven it up a little.  In addition to the lemon grass, I added about 5 thin slices of ginger.  I used a pound of egg noodles, as the author recommended for those who like lots of noodles... unforutnately, this drastically reduced the amount of broth... I definitely would NOT recommend doing this - as you are left with a ton of noodles, chicken, veggies and no broth!!!  For those with a sophisticated palate - do not be fooled by all the 5 star ratings!

This was my first attempt at making chicken noodle soup from scratch.  This came out soooo amazing, my family raved about it for weeks.  Additionally, I was so dumbfounded at how great it tasted, my head swelled up!  The only addition that I made was some parsley flakes in the last 5 minutes of cooking.

OMG!!! This is the best! It is time consuming but worth the effort...especially if you double the recipe and freeze a portion for later. I left out the lemongrass...not a big fan of it. Other than that, I followed the directions...except added COOKED egg noodles instead of raw egg noodles. I used the veggies from the stock to make a ham and bean soup with a leftover ham bone and a ripped up ham steak.

Just like my mother used to make.  Absolutely delicious.  Makes alot.  I used 350g. bag of noodles and the soup was too thick.  I'd use the recommended amount next time.

Better than canned soup but time consuming to make.  If you made it often enough it would probably become easy to throw together.  Like others I cooked the noodles seperately and added just before serving.

Wonderful! This was the ultimate comfort food soup, and totally worth the effort.  I added some red onion and omitted the lemongrass, as my husband was a prude about it. It was delicious, heart-warming soup that I will go to again.

I made this recipe for my husband who is home sick with a cold right now.  He gives it five stars and says it is great. (I'm vegetarian, so I'll have to take his word for it!)

I'm not sure I'd make this recipe again the way it is written, however.  I found it to be way too time consuming.  Next time I will remove the chicken from the bone before putting it in the water.  The recipe simply says to "strain" the cooked chicken from the water, but my gosh, this took me FOREVER to find all the tiny little bones and inedible bits and remove them from the cooked chicken before putting it back into the stock.  This was tedious and certainly avoidable next time.

Thank you to Beezlys (a reviewer) for her excellent suggestions.  As she suggested, I cooked the noodles separately and added them later, used ¼ cup of “Better than Bouillon” chicken base paste, and used couple of cloves of fresh garlic.  I did not use any lemon grass because I wanted a more traditional flavor, but might try that next time.

This is the BEST chicken noodle soup I've ever had! My husband loved it, too, and he's picky. It made a lot, which is great. I put some in the freezer. I used chicken bouillon cubes (9 of them) instead of the soup base. I also used a teaspoon or so of lemon juice instead of lemon grass, which I couldn't find. I also used about a teaspoon or so of lemon pepper. YUMMY! I'm keeping this recipe forever! It takes time to make, but it's definitely worth it.

6/1/2005 ... I made this a second time, and it was even better! I used the lemon grass this time, and I used chicken base instead of the bouillon cubes. MUCH better. My husband LOVED LOVED LOVED it, and so did I!! Highly recommended.

Incredibly good soup. I followed the recipe very closely. One tip - I went to Natural Grocers for lemongrass, and they only had dried lemongrass (bulk foods). My colander wasn't fine enough to strain out the lemongrass, and the texture IS like eating dried grass. The taste is worth it to make sure to include, but I was spooning out pieces of lemongrass because it was like eating pieces of straw. Make sure to use a fine strainer if you can. The recipe was very time consuming (I did a double batch), but the results were worth it. I put the noodles into the broth and they did use up a lot of the broth, so I added some chicken broth toward the end.

1/3/16 Update from first reviews: I made this today and it is so good. I used lemongrass stalks that I kept in the freezer (used four). I used Better than Bullion Chicken for the soup base. I don't think I will ever make another chicken noodle soup recipe again!!  Oh, I boiled the egg noodles separately and added them at the end. Don't skip the lemongrass!

What makes this soup is starting with a whole chicken and creating its own broth.  I love this recipe.  I think if you want a low fat/calorie version use a different recipe.  This is my old chicken soup recipe that helps you feel better in the morning.

Delicious!   I changed up a few things tho.   I sauteed my onion, carrots and celery with some garlic until they were caramelized. Then I added the bird and water.   Really solid recipe. Thanks for posting.

Yum!  The lemon grass is perfect in this, I absolutely love it.  With a squirt of sriracha this is sublime - and I usually don't even LIKE homemade chicken noodle soup. If you can't get lemongrass locally, look in the produce section for plastic tubes that kind of look like toothpaste tube, but big - my local store carries lemongrass, chili paste, and pesto.  They're actually quite good.

I made this soup for our Thanksgiving "light" lunch, since we were all going to my mom's for the big turkey dinner later in the day.  This is THE BEST chicken noodle soup recipe I've tried.  Instead of using chicken boullion as the soup base as I normally do, I used a "specialty" chicken soup base I found next to the boullion at our grocery store. I also found homemade noodles in the pasta section that I used. I did not use the lemongrass.  I made no changes to the recipe - followed it exactly.  It was delicous - my entire family "gobbled" it up!  Great recipe!

My daughter was sick so I took her a big pot of this soup. Later I asked her if it was any good & she told me that my grandson licked his bowl clean. :o) Guess it's a keeper! I used chicken thighs instead of a whole chicken. I  didn't have any celery or carrots on hand so I used celery salt to season it w/ & added a can of sliced carrots when I added the cooked chicken back to the soup. I didn't have lemongrass but did add loads of garlic & some thyme. I also didn't have any soup base so I added 3 cubes of boullion. I did add just a splash of white wine to the chicken stock to give it addtional flavor.

The soup is excellent. The "Chicken Soup Base" is a must, or it would be too bland. (It took me a while to find it at Bi-Lo.) I am not sure why to put the celery and carrots in two batches and one is whole and the other chopped. Next time I will try to combine a few steps. Also, I might reduce the soup base some because I don't like artificial flavoring in general.

Sooo, good and worth the work!  Make the full recipe and freeze the rest.  It is actually better after freezing.  Also for those who think they could just leave in the first round of celery and carrots, DON'T.  Better than bouillon (brand name) is better than bouillon cubes and less sodium.

Pretty darn good. Made a double batch. Added garlic cloves (we like garlic so we put a whole head of garlic in)...made noodles separate. Will make again.

If I could give this ten stars, I would. I only altered the recipe by adding two super large cans of chicken stock. (This liquid amount was deducted from the water amount, to ensure correct measurement.) When I boiled the chicken I added the bouillon with the chicken. I also made the noodles separate because I doubled this batch. I have a house full of summer cold victims and I make the noodles as we go. I simple salt and bouillon the water for the noodles and add them (cooked) into the individual bowls of my family. This ensures that the noodles wont get mushy and a happy helping to each lil belly. The Lemon Grass in this made it AWESOME!!! Thank you, THANK YOU for posting this recipe!

I made sure to add the milk & cheese, it turned out fabulous.  At the very end with no season salt/season all, it was bland.  After adding a ton of it, this was the best chicken noodle soup I have ever tasted.

Excellent. Tasted amazing. The directions were a little confusing to me though, but I improvised and it turned out well. I also added 2 cloves of garlic and some garlic salt.

Time consuming but SO worth it on a cold day (or when someone's ailing!). Don't substitute for the homemade broth- that is what totally makes this soup.I didn't use the lemongrass, but it was amazing without it. I do always seem to need to add extra water, as it keeps evaporating as it cooks....actually I would give this recipe more than 5 stars.

I've truly never had better.  I've never found lemon grass but the soup isn't missing anything without it, either.  One of these days I'll make it with that special ingredient, but in the meantime, it really does cure what ails ya'.  :-)

Tonight was the fourth time I've made this and my wife STILL thinks this is my grandmothers recipe.  I've done this twice now with the Better than Bullion paste mentioned in the other review and agree, this is the way to go.  It's just... well...  better than bullion (cubes). :) 

I've done this with a whole chicken and four pounds of boneless breasts.  If you want soup that goes above and beyond your expectations - use a whole chicken.  It's messy and time consuming pulling the meat off the bones later on but it is most definitely worth it.  

With the pepper corns, tonight I changed it up a bit and used whole corns from a potpourri mixture.  I increased the measurement by 50% and pulverized them with one smack from a mallet.  This helped them dissolve a little better for better flavor but they also sank to the bottom just as before.  So if feed the last ladle full to someone who loves pepper.  

Lastly I don't know why this effects anything, but a fresh carrot seems to blow away chopped baby carrots and diced frozen carrots.

For a basic, no-frills recipe, this recipe does the trick.  It's got a mild flavor, perfect for those days when you're not feeling well but need some healthy sustenance.  I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of tossing in a few cloves of garlic (I added three but will add more next time) and I used lemon grass paste instead of lemon grass, since that's all that was available at my grocery store.  I also added salt and pepper to taste.  This recipe was quite a bit of work, however.  I've made decent chicken noodle soups that had more flavor and took a lot less time.

This is time consuming, but you get out what you put into it.  I had a hard time finding the chicken base (paste). I usually get it at a "superclub", the lemon grass I get at an asian international grocery store.  It smells so good w/ the lemon grass.  I added between 16 and 20 bouillon cubes instead of the chicken base.  Had a salty flavor.  I also added a little basil and a package of frozen, chopped spinach for color and nutritional value.  I like that this makes a lot and freezes well.

This was exactly what I was looking for. Easy, basic and yummy. I let my chicken simmer overnight in the crockpot, it just fell off the bones. I didn't have any lemongrass, but it was still awesome, and you could easily play around with seasonings. Thanks for a great recipe.

I made this last night using MKOSSEN's suggestions and it turned out great.  My husband had 3 bowls!  I did add the lemongrass with the veggies but put them in a wire loose tea basket so I could remove them after an hour. Wonderful taste!

This was a great recipe. Mt husband had 5 bowls of it right after I made it. He couldn't get enough of it. I didn't really measure anything just guesstimating - I used 4 leg quarters and it was plenty for a huge pot.

LOVE THIS ONE!! Best chicken noodle ever! We use thicker spiral noodles so they don't get over-squishy when stored.  I use quartered ckn halves of dark meat only, better flavor than white and it pulls easier too.  Thanks so much alank!

I've made this several times and its very good especially with the lemon grass! I use chicken breast instead of a whole chicken because I prefer white meat.  I like some of the other reviewers suggest to boil the noodles separately.  I use a whole box of farfalle (bowtie) noodles. I also throw in a can of petite diced tomatoes drained sometimes for a change.

In an update from my earlier (5 star) review I'd just like to add that though I'm not overly frugal it kills me to throw out all the vegetables from the first batch. So I save them and purée them for another soup base. Today I cooked barley in vegetable stock with sliced mushrooms and pureed the veggies with a bit more stock. If it's too bland just add bouillon granules, curry powder or paste, or whatever other taste you're looking for. It's not as awesome as the chicken soup but pretty good.

I didn't use lemon grass, but the result turns excellent. Also, I added some salt in the soup after the chicken pulled out and cooked with the carrots and some mushroom. Very nice recipe!

what a perfect and classic chicken soup.  i would add a bit of white pepper.
i cook and hold the noodles separately from the soup.  i also hold the chicken separately.  this practice keeps the soup from getting murky,  it keeps the noodles from getting mushy, and it keeps the chicken from breaking up.
just place a bed of noodles and chicken at the bottom of each individual soup bowl and then ladle the soup over them.  let it sit for a moment and the noodles and chicken will heat right up.  if you are a piping hot or nothing soup eater, you can microwave the bed of noodles and chicken briefly (maybe 30 seconds at high power.)

Simple enough to follow for me!  Tastes absolutley delicious.  I guess I did it a little different.  After my chicken boiled and simmered I sliced up the carrots and celeray and added them along with the whole onion for an hour instead of doing the whole pieces to cut later.  I think it just saved some time and the veggies were still perfectly tender. Goes great with a dinner roll! I didn't use the lemon grass and it's still delicious so if you don't have this don't fret as it turns out fine!

I made this soup when my husband and I were home sick and it was just great.  The only suggestion I can give would be to put the lemongrass (I used dried) in a mesh bag.  It never got soft and we had to keep picking it out of our mouths.

This was my first time making chicken soup, and it turned out great! I did add a couple cloves of garlic to the pre-strained broth, and some minced to the actual broth, as well as lemon pepper (couldn't find lemon grass), and a goodly amount of coarse black pepper. I used about 6 lbs of chicken thighs, and used closer to a pound of noodles (also upped the water to ~ a gallon and a half). As other reviewers suggested, I cooked my noodles separately. Good recipe, esp for first-timers! Thanks!

I thought that this was a good but not great recipe.  It's good in an ordinary way.  No big surprises.
The one thing we didn't care for was the subtile sweet taste it took on due to so many carrots.  I might make this again but would cut the carrots and celery amounts by half and would use all chicken broth rather than water.

Great soup my whole family loved it. I added 4 or 5 chicken bullion cubes in the stock for more flavor. Next time may just cook chicken in chicken stock instead of water.

Awesome recipe!  It was so easy to follow.  We like lots of pasta so we put just over a pound of stars and pearls which made it fun to eat for us big kids.  Just what we were looking for.  We have tons for leftovers, too, but my boyfriend won't give them up!

Can I say this is the best chicken soup ever?  It's not as salty as the ones I've tried on this site and it's absolutely delicious!  The lemon grass gives it that wonderful, subtle flavor.  I'm sick, so I've been making a lot of chicken soups this week and this is my new favorite one.  Lets just say, after I had myself a bowl in the morning, I came back for seconds in the afternoon, only to find an empty pan (makes a mad face). Thanks Alan.

Ok, all I want to know is who has been peeping in my kitchen window.  I just happen to be skimming and I said, "Hey, that's my soup"!!!!!!!  This is one of my ALL time favorite dishes year round.  I did not have to make it to rate it!  It is exactly how I make my soup but with out the lemon grass; however, I will be trying the lemon grass.

Nice authentic recipe. I used chicken granules because that's what I had and it turned out tasty. My pot was not as big as it should have been so I ended up with 3/4 gallon instead. More water may have diluted it too much. I will make this again for sure. By the way, boiled chicken is smelly :) and I didn't expect that. The chicken was fresh so I knew there was nothing wrong with it. Just a little warning for those who will wonder.

Maybe it was just us, but we didn't care for this recipe.  It lacked flavor.  Followed directions exactly and broth was weak...  At the table everyone started throwing ginger and soy sauce in it to try to gain some flavor.  Chicken was dry too, and I even took it out early.  Sorry guys.

It really isn't fair to give this recipe a rating when you are sick and unable to taste food. So, I'll base the rating on how well it settled in myy stomach, ease of eating, and how it felt having the soup go down my sore throat. I'll definitely make this again when I'm sick!

Just made this today for my sick fiance.  Followed the instructions exactly, except I cooked the noodles separately, as suggested by reviewers, because I have dealt with mushy noodles in the past.  It was very good.  The flavor of the broth was very light, but that was good for the sick man in the house!

I subbed the egg noodles with multigrain rotini (my husband and I are just not fans of egg noodles) and omitted the peppercorns since I didn't have them.  This was my first time making chicken noodle soup and I was pleasantly surprised how well it turned out.

Wonderful! I used the lemon grass, and added 2 cloves of garlic also during the cooking of the chicken and veggies. I added fresh onion, carrot and celery. I used the thinner egg noodles, not too thin. Medium size I guess. The girls loved it! I added fresh parsley and green onion to mine. With Club crackers on the side. YUMMY! Thank you!

I boiled my chicken, removed it from the water, added chicken granules and vegetables to the same water, boiled a few more minutes, added back the chopped chicken and then threw in the uncooked noodles and boiled until done. Much easier, but don't forget you will need plenty of water when boiling the chicken, the noodles soak up ALOT. Very hearty, not very good as a leftover.

What I thought was a mistake made, turned out to be great.  I shopped for the ingredients from memory and bought low sodium chicken soup base.  Then saw the recipe called for bullion.  I used 1/4 cup of the soup base paste, but since it was low sodium, lacked flavor.  So I went ahead and added a 1/4 cup of Wylers bullion crystals.  I also added a couple of shakes of white pepper, a couple shakes of onion powder, and a dash of garlic powder.  Perfect.

I also cooked the noodles separate and used some of the carrots cooked with the chicken, and diced them up to add to the last step instead of re-cooking more.

All other ingrediants were used as called for, and I will defiently make "my way" again.

The only changes I made: I used halved, skin on, chicken breasts on the bone (we don't like dark meat) and I shredded my carrots because I have a picky kid.
THANK YOU TO THE AUTHOR!!!!!!!

After making this recipe, canned chicken noodle soup will never quite cut it again! I froze a few servings of the soup for later.  I used the lemongrass in a tube that they sell in the veggie section at the grocery store, since lemongrass is somewhat hard to come by in this area.  I also cooked the egg noodles in a separate pot before adding them to the soup, and I'm glad I did, because there didn't seem to be a whole lot of broth in relation to the amount of chicken and noodles.  I thought that this was a great recipe and it's just nice to know you made the whole thing "from scratch."

This is a very tasty and flavorful chicken noodle soup recipe.  I didn't have any lemon grass.  I used fresh parsley & thyme from the garden as well as some bottled minced garlic.  I also used 2 lbs of boneless chicken breasts and 2 lbs chicken drumsticks.  Make sure you use a huge pot!

INCREDIBLE, just like Mom used to make!  I have been searching for a recipe like this one, and this is it!  I added some minced garlic to the stock along with the onion etc., and I also threw in some frozen peas for color and added nutrition.  This was so nourishing and comforting when I had a chest cold.  The leftovers really do freeze well, and the flavor is perfect.  It's the only chicken noodle soup recipe I'll ever make.  Thanks so much!

WOW!  I'm not kidding, either.  The lemon grass (found in the spice aisle) was such the necessary ingredient as well the chicken base.  This is one to impress and keep impressing.

Today was the second time I made this soup and it came out absolutely delicious again! This time I used rice instead of noodles and I think I like it better with rice (1 1/4 cup dry white rice which I boiled in advance and then added to the pot in step 5).

This recipe is fantastic.I have made this soup numerous times and everyone says it is the best they ever had. I do add more of the soup base to give it more flavor & also cook the noodles separately.

Love this recipe. I've made it numerous times. Never have tried it with the lemon grass, though. If you don't have chicken base, use 8-10 chicken boullion cubes instead.

My husband got a cold so I wanted to make him some homeade chicken soup - which I never tried before.  I started off using another recipe from Allrecipes, but found that halfway through the cooking, the broth was bland and the vegetables were already mushy (the recipe suggested using the same vegetables used for the broth in the final product).  So, I found this recipe and tried to salvage the soup from the other recipe.  I was so glad I did because it came out great.  I made a few variations, such as adding whole garlic cloves to the broth from the beginning of cooking.  In any case, the soup was easy to make and tasted great.  Thanks Alan!

This was wonderful soup.  Definately worth the time it takes to make it from scratch.  I did add some basil, chopped onion, and a few other spices to liven it up a bit.

This is a good basic soup.  I must admit that I didn't use lemon grass (I don't even know what that is), so my soup was pretty bland and since I have never made chicken soup before I wasn't sure what spices I could add to help it at all besides pepper.  I would try it again if I can find some other spices to add to it.  I also used chicken breast instead of a whole chicken.

This has to be one of the easiest and most flavorful chicken noodle soups I've made. I used No Yolks noodles rather then egg noodles, and Better Than Bouillon paste instead of granules, but did everything else as written. The way the ingredients are listed threw me the first time I made the soup, I didn't realize I'd need two pounds of carrots total. My husband's favorite soup is chicken noodle but he has become sensitive to all the salt in canned soup. He likes Panera's, but finds he's at the mercy of whoever is ladling it out as to whether it's brothy or chock full'o chicken and noodles. He loves how full of meat, veggies and noodles this soup is. I make this often through the Fall and Winter.

I did try this recipe it was close to my own. I didn't add the lemon grass and I boiled the chicken pieces without the carrots onion and carrots. The reason being is when I strain it not only do I have to sort the chicken but now I have to try not to waste the veggies amongst the bones and skin.So while the chicken is cooking I cook the carrots onions and celery in another pot with a few veggie or chicken bouillon cubes. The veggies are only par cooked at this point and can be added back to the chicken broth with the chicken and they will cook the rest of the way. Cooking the noodles separate is a must unless you like no broth because they will soak it all up, trial and error. I read quite a few reviews and everybody's ideas were very good and helpful!

Absolutely Wonderful.  I have made this three times.  The first two times was short on time so I used boxed Chicken Broth.  Made this Sunday (6 degrees - wind chill -16 & snowing)so had all day to make the broth.  There is a world of difference!!!  I made it exactly like the recipe, except I didn't have the lemon grass so I put in about 4 Tablespoons of bottled lemon juice, I used skinless chicken breasts & cooked the noodles separate & added at the dinner table.  My 83 year old mother couldn't get enough!!!  To get a compliment out of her is like pulling a child's 1st tooth!

Really good! Made just as described. I agree with a poster who said, "Do not skip the lemongrass." It really adds something. And you can find lemongrass in a refrigerated tube in the produce section. I am really not a big fan of brothy soups, but really loved this! My husband kept eating more and walked away from the table exclaiming, "How can I be this full from soup!?!" We did serve the noodles separately to maintaim the texture of the pot of soup.

This is a very good recipe, but I didn't use the bouillon.  But if you decide not to use a whole chicken, you may want to.  Also, right now lemon grass is expensive, so I used half the peel from one orange instead.  Also, baby carrots are my favorite so used those instead of the whole carrots.  This recipe is yummy!

Yummy recipe! I used my own veggie stock instead of using water and the first portion of the ingredients to boil the chicken. This is a great recipe and I'll definitely keep making it.

My daughter loved this so much she said, "Daddy, I'm going to cry", a bit dramatic I know, but it says much. The cook time was a bit longer then stated here, it takes me about 3.5 hours with prep to make this soup, but well worth the time. This has become a dish that my kids beg me to make.

This was my first attempt at homemade chicken noodle soup and this was very good.  Definitely a keeper!  Was very time consuming though but worth it.

I have cooked this recipe several times now.  It's wonderful!  If you can't find the Lemon Grass, don't bother making this recipe.  It is a must-have ingrediant.  It comes a couple of different ways.  Note:  Lemon Grass sticks need to be soaked to soften and then sliced.  Enjoy!

This is a great soup. I followed the recipe except I added a couple of handsful of frozen sweet peas when I added the noodles. Also I used one tablespoon of dried lemon grass instead of fresh.

A standard and so satisfying to make from scratch! I also made the noodles separate, and I really didn't get the point of making my own stock and then adding store-bought boullion, so I didn't. I just salted what I had already made.

A very good soup.  Only comment is that the chicken base I used had 750mg of sodium per teaspoon so the soup was way too salty!!! Check the soup base you use first & use alot less if the sodium is so high. All in all it was very good & I will defintely make again.  Thanks.

I really liked this soup and my bf liked it too.  I don't like celery, so just left that out but the soup was still great.  Apart from the missing celery I followed the recipe exactly.

This is an excellent recipe.  I followed exactly with the exception of not cutting up the whole chicken and simmering it an extra 30 minutes.  I thought it was easier and the chicken was easy to remove from the bones.  My husband said, "You are a really good cook."

This is a very good recipe.  I used 15 peppercorns instead of 10.  After draining the broth off and letting it cool, I waited until the following morning to continue with the recipe.   As our family loves pasta I boiled  32 ounces of dry egg noodles in a separate pot and added to the soup only before consuming.  This way the noodles would not absorb the broth and become too bloated and thus not depriving us of broth.  My wife said the recipe could use more spice and rated the soup with with 3 stars, whereas my 9 year-old daugter gave it 5 stars.  I will certainly make this again!!

This recipe is amazing.  We quickly realized that we had never had truly good chicken noodle soup before.  This is well worth the extra effort.  You must make it with your own chicken stock.  I truly came to understand the meaning of comfort food when I made this soup during the winter.  It will always be a family favorite.  Thanks Alan!

This is the real stuff; delicious homemade soup.  Don't skip on the lemon grass.  It is a little expensive but worth the addition.  Every year I'm asked to make this soup for our church "Souper Bowl" dinner.  It is always a hit!

This has become a favorite in our house.  We like lots of noodles so we increased the amount to 16oz.  We eliminated the leomon grass and it is still so wonderful.  To save time, we cooked chicken breasts instead of the whole chicken.  Shredding the chicken makes the consistency slightly thicker...a winning recipe.

Excellent!  I used chicken legs w/ backs attached instead of whole chicken, omitted peppercorns and lemongrass  (didn't have either on hand).  I used some of our favorite spices. Next time I want to try this exactly as is, in fact I can't wait. Thank You Alan.K for a wonderful recipe, it is our recipe of choice for chicken noodle soup, my search has ended :-}UPDATE: I made this exactly as is, and now wouldn't make it any other way, the peppercorns and lemongrass add so much to this soup.Highly recommended!

This recipe did not disappoint.  I made it for my sister after surgery, and it was rated "the best chicken soup I've ever had".  I'm making my second batch now and doubling it because it got such rave reviews.  This was the first time I'd ever made homemade soup!

Excellent recipe. Very easy to make and left-overs are almost better than the first time around! As others have reviewed, the lemon grass was a wonderful addition. One variation I tried: because my father can't have wheat ans I was making it to share w him, I divided the soupbroth between two pots right before adding the noodles: I used Japanese rice noodles in one and egg noodles in the other. When it all came down to it, I prefered the rice noodle version.

YUMMY!  I made this because our heat went out last week (chilly in Minnesota) & my mother was sick.  Not only did it taste FABULOUS (the lemongrass *really* adds to it.  Who would have thought???) but it warmed up my house for a couple of hours.  It's a keeper!

Good basic recipe for chicken noodle soup! Broth was light and flavorful. I used the lemongrass.

I followed this recipe exactly, including the lemongrass. After 2.5 hours in the kitchen I was sorely disappointed. My house smelled great, the soup looked good...but it had no flavor. I was looking for a traditional chicken noodle soup, no exciting ingredient or flavor, just the basic soup we all know and love that's stood the test of time. I couldn't believe how utterly tasteless this highly reviewed recipe was! Save yourself the time and try a different recipe because this one was a total flop!

This recipe is okay. Kinda bland, next time I will leave out the lemon grass. I have tried other recipes with better outcome.

Great recipe! And the lemongrass was worth going back to the store for, its subtle but gives a nice flavor.

I didn't add lemon grass and instead added some dill weed. Home made noodles really brought it together. Best chicken noodle soup I have had.

Can't beat homemade chicken noodle soup.  I used homemade chicken broth (saved up the chicken broth after baking whole chickens).  Great recipe. The only thing I did different was use a teaspoon of terragon.

Needed a recipe at 2:45 pm this afternoon. I found this and started at 3:00pm.  Soup was done at 5:10pm  My only changes were two Knorr's Chicken Bouillon Cubes, they're are what I use, some garlic powder. No lemongrass in the kitchen, but it turned out excellent :D   Very, very easy.

Wonderful soup! I followed the directions - only change was instead of lemongrass ( which I didn’t have) I used star anise, which my mother always used when making chicken noodle soup... adds a lovely flavour too. Yes, it takes time... but it’s worth it!

I will definitely make this again! I followed another reviewers recommendations to make it a bit easier and faster - chicken breasts cooked in low sodium chicken broth, then added veggies, etc to complete the recipe.

This soup takes a little time but is well worth the wait. I used  2 Knorr Homestyle Chicken Stock tubs instead of bouillon. You can always add another if you want more flavor. I also used Reamers frozen egg noodles instead of dry. I cook them separate and put the noodles in the bowls then ladle the soup over the noodles. That way the noodles don't soak up all the liquid in the pot

This is THE chicken soup recipe. I don't change a thing and have made this about once a month through the fall and winter for years. I use either chicken quarters or thighs, they are easier to bone than whole chicken. I also use kluski noodles, they don't fall apart as easy as other noodles.

I used this recipe as a guide. I cooked my boneless skinless chicken breasts in purchased chicken broth, then shredded it. Separately, I sauteed the veggies, added broth and noodles. Cooked the noodles in the broth. Lastly, added shredded chicken until it was warmed. Fam loved it!

Yes I turned out great - I didn’t have a whole chicken so I used just the carcass and 2 large drums sticks - I didn’t have whole pepper corn so I used cracked pepper. I halved the recipe really less water and 2 stock cubes and I did add a teaspoon full of salt - everything else was the same my noodle were gluten free pre cooked and frozen which I added later and it worked so nicely - I will make it again for sure I loved it and its going to be better tomorrow I’m sure

Easy and delish! Only thing I did different was add the noodles as soon as the soup came to a boil after adding the veggies because I don’t like the veggies really soft/mushy. The recipe called for adding the noodles after the veggies had been simmering for 10 min and I felt that if the veggies were to boil for the additional time after already simmering the 10 min to allow for cooking the noodles, they would’ve been mushy. With the modification, the veggies and noodles came out perfect!

This was good chicken noodle soup. I added more bay leaves and less chicken cubes. Went to Walmart, didn't have lemongrass (duh) so I skipped that. Added a little more noodles. Not the best I've ever had, but still good. :)

I cooked the noodles separate, used lemon pepper and lemon juice in place of lemon grass. I thought it was a little bland and added thyme as another reviewer suggested, that made a huge difference. Definitely better with thyme.

This is a terrific authentic chicken noodle soup. Having a very broad depth of flavor of the disposable vegetables, the true chicken broth, finished with more delicious vegetables. Really, the only thing I did different was to boil my noodles before they were incorporated into the soup and to add about 3/4 of a teaspoon  of sea salt (no Iodine needed). A firm artisan bread slice moderately thick was a perfect addition to this beautiful Jewish Penicillin! Perfect

I was unfamiliar with the lemon grass.  I found it at International Market.  The flavor was good but it needs to be pulled out before eating!  The vegetable should be done last as they cook so quickly!

worst directions ever! I added the bullion powder when the recipe says to add chopped carrots and celery??? I also kept the cooked carrots and celery because we like veg in this family and just chopped em up and added it in the pot. The recipe turned out pretty good in spite of the directions being terrible.

Very good.  The way the recipe reads it appears they want you to throw away the whole carrots and celery when straining the chicken?  Why waste!  I simply chopped them up and put them back into the pot.  Also added extra bay leaf.
My husband and I like spicy things so for our portions I added some cooked chorizo, squeeze of lime and a dollop of greek yogurt.

Delicious and easy to make. The only tweak I made was that I removed the skin from the chicken prior to the first step.

This was the first time I ever made chicken soup and I loved i!  The only changes I made was that I used chicken broth instead of water and boullion powder.  I did not use the lemongrass.  I made the noodles separately and then added so they would not absorb too much liquid.

Delicious recipe! It has such a good flavor. The only changes i made is that I don't add the celery leaves or lemon grass and only use 1/8 cup chicken bouillon. I've made it twice now and it's so good! It also freezes really well.

The flavor was good but seems a little crazy to make a stock from scratch and then add that much bullion. The bullion overwhelms the delicate notes of the stock and lemon grass.

Excellent taste - the lemon grass adds another dimension that is not overstated.  I did not add the chicken bouillon but instead used chicken stock (primarily because I used less than a gallon of water because of the pot size).  Like other comments, I prepared the noodles separately.   Overall a very tasty chicken soup.

Good recipe, will make again. Followed the recipe with one exception I could not locate Lemon grass in our market.  No where in the recipe did it mention adding salt to the broth. It was very bland with out the salt, which I added along with pepper. I discovered, although others mentioned it) not to cook the noodle in the broth. I cooked the noodles separately from the soup, but had to put them in the pot as it was being served at a church pot luck. They tasted great although they were very large. Received good complements from those in attendance. A definite keeper.

Started with one carton of chicken broth and one carton of veggie stock and two cartons of water to equal one gallon. Added the whole chicken, 3 onions, celery, 4 bay leaves, salt and pepper.  Cooked it for 30 minutes, removed chicken to cool and added carrots and a celery leaves.  Once cooled I removed all the chicken and added it to the pot.  Add salt if needed. Cooked pasta separately and topped it with parm cheese.

Great home style chicken noodle soup!! I have made this several times, and the recipe is very versatile. Add more veggies or chicken to make it heartier. Great for warming you up on a winter day.

Used chicken broth instead of bullion cubes. Added 1 teaspoon of vegetable oil to broth. Cooked chicken in broth. Cooked noodles separately from broth. 
Didn't have lemongrass. Will try to add next time. 
Added a couple of cilantro leaves when serving.

This was the first time I made homemade chicken soup...and it was amazing!  The recipe is very simple, and tasted great.  I used 64 ozs. organic chicken broth and 64 ozs. water.  The broth was so flavorful.  I also used brown rice noodles in place of egg noodles and my kids loved it.

I am a bit of a cooking newbie, so I floundered a bit navigating this recipe.  But the end results were superb.  So I will share some notes in case other beginners want some tips.  First of all, I cut up, skinned and trimmed the chicken in the first step, whereas the directions intend you to just cut the chicken, leaving the skinning and trimming for after it's boiled.  Honestly, I thought it worked great the way I did it, and will probably do it that way again.  (There is a video on here showing you how to cut up a whole chicken, I followed that.)  As others mentioned, I boiled the chicken and the stock veggies (the first, uncut, set of veggies) the night before.  In the morning, I scooped the veggies out and trashed them, using a mesh strainer.  This was very easy, and I had very little skin, fat or anything else to skim.  I was able to pull meat easily off of the bones.  For the soup, you do use a new set of veggies, which was confusing for me until I read other reviews.  These veggies you will want to cut to the size you will want to eat them in your soup.  I did, from other recipes I've used in the past, add a few seasonings to the soup: 1 TBSP each of poultry seasoning, celery salt, garlic paste (refrigerated concoction I buy in a tube in the deli and refrigerate) and kosher salt.  My family likes strong flavors and salty soups.  We added the noodles later.  We froze a bunch in individual sized bowls for school lunches, my kids are very happy.  Thanks so much for this!

Tastes awesome, only thing I did different was to not add the bouillon, instead I let the stock simmer and reduce after I filtered it and added some thyme, salt, and pepper to season the stock.

Don't leave out the lemon grass- it gives it a freshness and depth of flavor.  I added ginger as another reviewer recommended --WOW!  Better than mom or even grandma ever made!

Good.  Halved the recipe to fit our pot.  Thanks to others' comments - cook noodles seperate and only add noodles to soup that will be eaten.  Store noodles seperately.

Found it pleasantly light and tasty especially as a noon meal.  Added about  1 1/2 cup of thin spaghetti 2nd time I made this recipe as a substitute noodle which was nice change of pace.

I'm not a big fan of Chicken Noodle Soup but I really think the Chicken Base really makes a big difference it gave it a buttery taste!  Very Good!

Made it exactly as instructed and it came out great and flavorful.  I didn't add lemongrass and it was ok, because it felt like something my grandmother would make.

I like the recipe but I made changes to suit me. After doing the first step exactly but i haded fresh herbs (thyme,tarragon,parsley) and 20 peppercorns and of course the carrots, bay leaves and a few smashed garlic cloves by on lemon grass or celery bc i dont like it. After straining it when returning it to the pot i added the boullion, carrots and i added peeled cut potatoes and the other half of onion finely chopped. They disappear and leave great flavor. The rest i follow the recipe.

This makes a DELICIOUS broth!  I do not use the lemon grass.  I strain this broth repeatedly using a cheese cloth in my fine mesh strainer until it runs absolutely clear.  I also use cheese tortellini in place of the egg noodles!

I loved this recipe. I had to make some changes because I didn't have some of the ingredients (lemon grass), but it turned out really, really good. I first boiled the chicken with the onion, celery and carrot (diced) along with the bay leaf. After, I cut the chicken into bite sized pieces and put the celery, carrot and onion in a blender with some of the broth. I put that back into the broth with the diced chicken, added some salt, a few celery leaves, and noodles. Perfect!!

this is basically my recipe too. I add fresh garlic about 2 to 3 cloves minced, and a tablespoon of dill weed along with some poultry seasoning to taste. If I leave the noodles out I make matzo balls instead.

I think the lemon grass may have made it a little sweet; so next time I would leave it out. Otherwise it was a fairly easy and delicious recipe.

Loved it! It took time to cook up, but I was so glad I did take the time. I made the noodles seperately as many suggested. I will definitely be putting this on our family's regular menu now.

Adding 5 years after my 1st review- this is still a recipe I use consistently, especially during the winter months or when someone is sick. I'd like to add my tip: I use a tea ball/strainer to put the bat leaves, peppercorns & lemongrass in so it's much easier for me to remove from the stock. I don't usually go through the effort of fully straining (I make enough dirty dishes!). I just remove the big veggies & the tea ball & it works like a charm.

Good recipe! I used a rotisserie chicken and just stripped the meat and boiled the carcass with the veggies, etc to get more chicken flavour. A couple other variations - i used angel hair wheat pasta because I couldn't find egg noodles made with free range eggs and I sautéed the onions and celery in butter before adding to the soup at the end. The flavour was great and wasnt too watery like some recipes.

Great soup!  I already had homemade broth in the freezer.  Added that to the gallon of water, chicken base, veggies, diced chicken I had in the freezer.  The lemon grass was a great touch.  I had some in a jar and minched and added directly to the soup.  I made homemade egg noodles (2 eggs, 1 cup flour) and dropped them right in and boiled for a little bit.  My son's new favorite soup

Awesome recipe.  Love the lemongrass.  I use Acini de Pepe noodles instead, they do not soak up the broth the same way egg noodles do when the soup is kept for a few days.

We made this recipe for my son's Boy Scout fundraiser (Dinner & Trivia Night) and it was a HUGE hit!  I converted it to approx. 75 servings and used whole rotisserie chickens from a local grocery store deli.  We made our own stock and omitted the lemon grass and upped the bay leaves--it was wonderful and everyone came back for seconds and thirds.  Its been requested again for our next fundraiser in April!

This soup was very good except that we thought it was slight dull so I add a teaspoon of salt and 2 teaspoons of pepper to give it more flavor.  Next time I use cracked peppercorns to see if that brings out the pepper flavor more.  Other than that slight adjustment it was great.  Also, this is very time consuming so I cut all the veggies up at once and added to the pot.

Great recipe.  I did use the "better than bullion" that was suggested and found that I needed to add salt because of that.  The whole family loved it.  I did know ahead of time that I was going to freeze the leftovers for another time.

This really is awesome.   I used the Better than Boullion and think it was the way to go.

This is about as good as it gets.  I made this today for the first time and am enjoying it now.  I made a few tweaks to the recipe:  Only used 1/2 an onion. I added a pinch of garlic and onion powder.  Used dried bay leaves instead of whole bay leaves. After I drained the stock, I chopped the onion with a chopper and threw it back in.  I also omitted the peppercorn and instead just did about 15 twists on the pepper grinder at the beginning.  I also used 10 chicken boullion cubes instead of the chicken soup base.  Did not use lemon grass at all.  I am really impressed with how it came out.  If you use the boullion cubes, don't add any salt or if you don't like food salty, use low sodium cubes.

This recipe was wonderful! My family asks me to make it all the time! I do agree with some other reviews though, that you should cook the noodles before hand. They do soak up a lot of the broth if you do not cook them otherwise. We freeze what ever we dont eat so we can have it whenever! This was a wonderful job done by Alan! Way to go!!!

Was gonna give this a 4 and comment on how it needed more chicken flavor, and then I just realized I forgot the chicken base :P
That aside, it was amazing. I really appreciated the mix of colors and textures.

I have tried many different chicken noodle soups and this one is the best!  I used 2 chicken flavored boullion cubes and 1/4c. chicken base for extra flavoring.

I have tried several chicken noodle soup recipes with my family, and this was the biggest hit! I loved the flavor the lemon grass added to the soup. This was a winner.

Loved the recipe. I did add some garlic. I felt it needed a little extra chicken. Didn't try it with the lemon grass, maybe next time.

I'm sorry to say that I found this recipe pretty bland.  I don't even know what lemon grass is, so maybe the soup is not worth making unless you have it.  I thought the peppercorns would give it enough punch, but I should have added extra ground pepper after I drained the veggies. I spent two hours preparing this soup for my sick children, and it was a big bummer when it seemed to be a waste of time.  Thanks anyway.

I have never made soup before----my father-in-law was asking for someone to make him some (my mother-in-law always made him soup but she recently passed) so I made this for him---he said that it was the best soup he has had---boy that made my day! I made this exactly as the recipe stated--this is a keeper!

this is an awesome soup! I did add whole cloves of garlic to the stock (in direction #1), and used lemon juice (1 tsp) due to lack of lemongrass. in the final 10 minutes of cooking, i julienned a zucchini and put that in with the noodles, along with some more fresh onion. fantastic!!!

Once again, a recipe with more work than reward.  I found this soup to be short on taste.  It was very bland.  I doctored it up with salt, pepper and extra chicken broth, and it was good, but not great.  I will keep looking.

Incredible.  My friends look forward to getting sick so I will make them this soup.

Try homemade egg noodles.  Just be careful not to let them soak up all the broth.

Thanks, Alan.

This soup wasn't as great as I thought it'd be from all the reviews I read. The lemongrass needs to be doubled as I couldn't even taste a sign of it w/ 3 TBSP. Much more of a pain than it's worth...thanks anyways.
