I love this recipe and I always get rave reviews. It's now holiday staple!  I cannot have much sugar, so I substituted Splenda and it still came out great!  Wonderful recipe!

This was very good and really easy to make but even with cutting back on both of the sugars, we all found it too be extremely sweet.  I will probably just go back to the oatmeal pie recipe I've used for several years that is similar but less sweet.  If you love REALLY sweet desserts, then this is for you!

The pie tastes like pecan pie but has a crumblier texture. Very tasty and uses readily available ingredients compared to other pies. I highly recommend it!

I made this today because I had a lot of oatmeal and extra piecrust to use. When I checked it at 30 minutes, it very loose. I turned the oven off and let it sit in the oven for an extra 15 minutes. It came out perfect. This is one of the easiest and tastiest pies that I have ever made. It would be good with vanilla ice cream too.
