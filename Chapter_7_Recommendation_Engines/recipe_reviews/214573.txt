This recipe was a fantastic way to use the Thai basil and cherry tomatoes from our garden! We loved it!

I didn't care for the combo of stir fry and potatoes. Also the tomatoes were mushy since you cook them until they pop and the taste of the tomatoes didn't seem to go well with other ingredients. Though I liked the taste of the sauce with a hint of star anise. Also I don't understand why this would be served with rice with so many potatoes in recipe. I omitted the rice. I tried recipe because I love star anise but this one will not be used again by me.
