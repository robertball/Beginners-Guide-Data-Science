I used a petite rack of lamb from Costco, 8 ribs though. I agree with the many others who say the salt could be cut, but not eliminated, say by half. I let the meat rest out of the fridge for about an hour before starting the recipe, those who needed to cook the rack longer than the recipe states either have their oven too low (get it calibrated) or started with the meat too cold. Anyway, after 12 minutes in the oven it was perfectly medium rare in the middle and medium/medium well on the end cuts. It was incredibly easy as well, what more could you ask from a recipe that would impress the Queen?

Restaurant quality!! I made a few small additions as I picked up a few things from reviews and other recipes: In a fry pan, I heated up about 2 tbsn of olive oil, threw in the minced garlic and some finely chopped shallots, added a splash of balsamic vinegar, and a smaller splash of worcestershire sauce. I added italian seasoned breadcrumbs (left out the salt) and put chopped rosemary & thyme at the end. Stirred it up a bit, and set it aside. Turned out SO GOOD!

My oh my was this good!  My guests were licking the bones!  Remember when searing..DON'T TOUCH IT or MOVE IT AROUND.  Everything will be much juicier!  The old cast iron pan is the best to sear in and then throw in the oven.  This recipe was fabulous!

Can I give eleventeen stars?

My tweaks:

I didn't use any salt (easier to add to taste than to take away).  I seared the lamb in olive oil and garlic.

I ALWAYS have the jarred chopped garlic on hand, so I added garlic to the dijon mustard and then diluted the dijon mustard with some of the juice from the garlic.

I mixed the bread crumbs with fresh ground pepper, garlic powder, onion powder and rosemary;

In the oven at 350 for 45 minutes, then 400 for 15 minutes, then cut the rack into individual ribs for another 15 minutes.

Cooking it slower makes it more tender and juicy.

This has gotten the most raves out of anything I've made!

Fabulous recipe! It's very simple to put together and the results were excellent even though we used dried rosemary and granulated garlic.  My husband has eaten a lot of lamb and he raved that this was the best he's ever had!  For a 1.40 lb, 7-rib rack, searing + 17 minutes in the oven produced a medium-RARE roast (some deeper glossy red in the center).  I strongly recommend a digital instant-read thermometer when making this recipe  Also, if not working with an oven-proof skillet, have your roaster pre-heated in the oven for immediate transfer.

I've been making this recipe for at least 11 YEARS and not once have I ever had anyone complain.  I use it on my beef tenderloin too. I have people that would never touch lamb asking when the next time I'll be making it ...give this recipe a try ...you'll be the rave of the town!!  ... I use a little bit of Thyme and also crushed rosemary only because the fresh rosemary is sometimes more difficult to eat.

The rating is for the general recipe but there are IMPORTANT NOTES FOR BEGINNERS.    The recipe was delicious, but if, like me, this is the first time cooking lamb, I wanted to mention some things that I had to research after this recipe went wrong, and should be noted.  Firstly, I asked my butcher for a rack of lamb to be "frenched" - after researching what this meant.  That was great, but after cooking, and trying to serve, I now realize I should have asked for them to REMOVE THE CHINE BONE.  It's not mentioned here, but if you don't ask the butcher to do this, you end up with a mess, like me, since even my Wustof chef's knife couldn't cut through that bone that connects each chop.  Finally, the time was off.  I was planning to serve roast potatoes and asparagus with the lamb.  It ended up taking 20 minutes longer than this recipe said...maybe my over was off a bit, but over doubling the cooking time for medium rare?  don't think so...  Anyway, after 30 minutes, I had lovely medium rare lamb, and the crust was delicious...but with burned/overcooked asparagus and potatoes.  I will try this recipe again as less of a novice next time, and re-comment.

I think this is a great recipe. Like others I found that it took a little longer for me to cook - 30 minutes for medium lamb. I also used less salt and would use less garlic next time. Will definitely cook this again.
   A 7-bone rack of lamb would not be enough for 4 servings at my place - Sydney Australia.

I made this last night according to my revised instructions below and it was divine.  The ingredients for this recipe are great but the cooking time and temp is off.  Lamb is expensive and it's always tough to gauge how long and for what temp when all is listed is a "a rack of 7-8 ribs".  For example an 8 rib rack can range in weight from .75 pound to 2.5 lbs and cooking 2.5 lbs for 12 minutes is nuts!   Also, New Zealand lamb is much smaller than Colorado lamb.  Colorado lamb can be cooked longer since it's larger and it doesn't taste as gamey. So, here is a better method. 1) Use a 400 degree oven when your lamb is over 1 pound. 2) Don't sear the lamb.  S & P it and oil it and put it in a 400 degree oven for 15 minutes and then remove it and add the mustard and bread crumb mixture. 3) Put it back in the oven for 30 min (45 minutes for a 2 pound) and you will have a lovely medium rare rack of lamb with a nice crust.  Let it rest etc...

Absolutely awesome. Everything was perfect, including the timing (12 mins. for rare). Served with "Greek Style Potatoes" from this site, some really good olives, and my own asparagus recipe (with tomatoes and garlic, which I'll be posting tonight). Incredibly romantic dinner for two, with leftovers for lunches to remember it with!

This recipe is so flavorful and delicious. We skipped the searing on the stove, seasoned with a little salt and pepper, spread the mustard and a little olive oil on the meat, then put the breadcrumb mixture on and roasted the rack at 425 degrees until medium rare, about 35 minutes. Absolutely wonderful!

I've made this recipe at least 20 times and it always gets great reviews. I learned a simpler wasy to make this is to cut the rack into individual chops, cover each with mustard and then with breadcrumb mixture and then saute in a frying pan on med-high heat 3-4 min on each side. Fast and scrumptious! use panko breadcrumbs.

Delish! If you don't have fresh breadcrumbs you can use Panko (seasoned or not). Also, I use Kosher salt for this and don't find 1 teaspoon too much. If you use regular salt you probably should cut it in half.

This is a classic recipe that lends itself to summertime grilling. Just grill prior to the mustard step & finish in the oven or else finish on the grill but move to a low heat section of the grill as to not burn the breadcrumbs (placing on foil helps too). The grill will give it another layer of flavor (especially over hickory or mesquite over coals).

In fall/winter I serve it with roasted butternut squash & Yukon gold potatoes. In spring/summer, throw some asparagus or zucchini on the grill along side the meat. 
Wonderfully impressive company dish & your family will think you're a genius!

I would really give this 10 stars if I could. It has been years since I have had lamb and was uncertain how much I would still like it and turns out I still LOVE it! This recipe is very simple to follow but the taste is just out of this world. I was hesitant about the salt because of reading others reviews but I cut back a bit anyways on the lamb itself before searing it. I added extra pepper and garlic and used dried rosemary and all turned out perfect. I cooked it to 130 and then covered it for 5 minutes and came out rare/medium rare. Do not be worried about the mustard if you arent a big fan, you can barely taste the mustard. I will definately be making this again and again!

OMGosh... I love Lamb. This is my favorite. It is better than what you have to pay $30.00 or more at a good restaurant. I go to Sam's Club and get the two pack. (Watch out because some have only one rack, and the rack is much bigger.) I pay $16-$21 for two racks. (one for now and one for later !!) My wife don't eat Lamb, so Yum to Me. This size rack cooks PERFECTLY for me in 14 minutes. This gives a perfect med rare to medium doneness. Do not overcook, but I do not like to poke a hole in my meat either, as the juices will definitely run out. Just trust the timer and change accordingly next time. (My time includes EXACTLY 1 1/2 to 2 minutes of browning on each of three sides using high heat in a cast iron (lodge) skillet.) It rests around 2-3 minutes after browning prior to applying crust and dijon mustard. DO LET IT REST !! Worth the short wait to keep juices in the meat. Try this simple mint sauce. 1/3 c. white wine vinegar, 1/4 c. sugar, and 1/4 c. fresh chopped mint. Bring to boil. set pan on ice cubes to make sauce cool before using. (FAB !!) You will be hooked on this Lamb !! I want some more right NOW...

I cooked this recipe yesterday..... almost exactly as written - I used Panko crumbs.

It was easy to prep., cook, and serve.  And it tasted absolutely wonderful.

I will certainly cook this dish again and not change a thing when I do.

ROASTING TIP: Make sure you determine how fatty/lean your lamb is before you set the temperature. I made the mistake of roasting a fatty lamb at 450 and it came out rather tough on the inside due to the high heat. For fattier cuts, try roasting for longer at 325-350 degrees.

Mistakes aside, this recipe was fantastic. Used whole grain dijon which added some really nice texture along with italian breadcrumbs. I skipped out on the rosemary and it was still fantastic.

The bf loved it. Will be making again at a different temperature next time.

Lamb is my favorite food and this recipe is good because it is cooked in the oven - not outdoors on a grille (which was actually great during winter) - and it stays moist. I left out the bread crumbs and dijon mustard. Those are items I like but I am a lamb purest, it really didn't need these additional flavors. Just some mint jelly. I coated it in olive oil and sprinkled a little garlic, rosemary, salt, and pepper on the rack. I tried wrapped the bones in tin foil one time and another time I did not - the results were the same. I broiled each side of the rack for several minutes. I like my meat medium well and 12-15 minutes accomplished that at 450. Meat from Costco.

OMG...I have cooked many lamb recipes but this one is out of the ballpark. My husband said it was the best meal he had in a long time and no restaurant that he had ever been to had lamb that good. He talked about it for two days. I do agree that cutting back on the salt is something to consider but if you don't you won't be disappointed.

This is the first time I have ever cooked lamb. I ate it once before at an overpriced restaurant and wasn't impressed.. (I realize now what I tried was severely well done).. I cooked my rack of lamb 12 minutes and got a beautiful medium rare. This lamb was so delicious and tender! Crust tasted great! Only thing I changed was the rosemary.. I only had dried (used little a less than a tbsp). This recipe definitely only serves 2 unless you are serving a bunch of sides.. I served with a rice dish and pita bread. Great recipe!!

This was the first time I have ever cooked or eaten lamb, and it was wonderful!  I wanted to try something different and nice for dinner.  I was not happy about the price of a rack of lamb, and I almost got 2 racks, but decided against it.  One rack was enough for the three of us.  Very delicious!

I have never reviewed anything, but I just had to review this. Absolutely phenomenal!! I just made this for my boyfriend for our new years eve dinner and he said it was hands down the best meal he ever had. He said it was fine restaurant quality. The only thing I changed was the amount of salt (I just used a little to season the meat - just a pinch or so) and I used panko bread crumbs. This was sooooo delicious! We had it with garlic mashed potatoes and asparagus. I will be making this again for sure!

I am planning on making this over the weekend. iIhave 10-12 people coming. Is it possible to cook three in a regular size oven or will it throw off the cooking time off? Any ideas would be appreciated as I am a bit of a novice!!!

We made the rack of lamb for Easter dinner. It took a little longer to cook (about 35 minutes)... But it was a great success!!! Even my mother-in-law loved it! Thank you, thank you!!!

This is a fantastic recipe.  I've eaten rack of lamb many times at restaurants, but this is my first time making at home.  I bought a small rack of lamb at Costco, followed this recipe to the letter, and it measures up to any I've ever eaten at a restaurant.  There is one thing that bothers me about this recipe, and that is although it mentions checking the temperature with a meat thermometer, it gives you no idea what the temperature should be.  If I'm not mistaken, most racks are served "medium," and I had to go to another source to find out what the temperature should be.  For any of you who may not know, cooking to 130 degrees F will give you a beautiful rack of lamb cooked perfectly to medium.  This certainly is a splurge nutritionally and one that I wouldn't do often, but it was a treat and absolutely delicious. Wonderful recipe JENNINE1980.

This came out wonderful. Although I took it out at 125 degrees thinking the resting period would bring it up to 130 to 135 degrees. Definately operator error, so leave it in to your desired temp.  This recipe is great, wouldn't change a thing

I spent too much time worrying, and when I did make it, it was easy but only feeds 2 not 4. Only changes I made were less garlic and salt. Had a lot of crumbs left over. Thanks to recipe buzz and Swiss Phil's blog help with photos:  http://allrecipes.com/Cook/11602733/BlogEntry.aspx?postid=194854

This was my first try at Rack of Lamb and it was not only easy, but very delicious.  I did not have a meat thermometer and cooked it for 20 minutes.  Next time I would cook it for about 25 minutes as it was a little to rare for my taste but still very very good.

Got rave reviews even from the "I-don't-really-care-for-lamb" crowd at the dinner table.  Cooked it for 20 minutes, followed all else to the letter, came out perfect!

This lamb dish deserves its 5-star rating - I used honey mustard since I didn't have dijon, and it was incredible.  It's on the menu for Easter this year. Loved it!

I have been making a modified version of this for years.  Slather the rack in minced garlic the night before and place in a zip lock bag and place in the fridge.  Just prior to cooking coat the rack with the Dijon mustard and roll the rack in the bread crumbs.  I've never cooked mine in the oven, always on the grill on a medium high heat.  They are awesome!!  I am a salt lover, but, omit the salt, pepper and rosemary.  Nothing else is needed and they are simple to make.

Good recipe.  Simple.  Quick.  However, for me cook time in the oven was 35 minutes for medium.  I doubled the fresh rosemary which worked out well.  Recommended!

All I can say is Oh MY G-D!  Best lamb ever.  I did cook it a little longer than the recipe said but I had an American rack of lamb which is larger than the New Zealand variety.  If you make this for company, you will blow their minds.

Man do I love a good lamb recipe. My wife and I cooked this on the very rare side and it was amazing. This was a little different than another recipe that we tried and we used a stone ground mustard this time. So good.

I have never cooked lamb before and was very nervous to try.  This recipe was so simple!  It was the best lamb I've ever had, by far!  My husband and I picked this for our Valentines dinner and I am so happy we did!  Will cook again for sure!!!

My wife and I made this for our family's Valentine's Day dinner.  Our oldest (12) is a huge fan of lamb and our youngest (9) can be counted on to always eat lamb chops as well.

We followed the recipe almost to the letter.  The only departures we made were using dried rosemary and garlic.

This was a huge hit!  My wife commented that she has had lamb in a lot of places/countries and tasted numerous preparations but this was by far the best she has ever had.  We bought the lamb at Sam's Club and there were a total of 17 pieces when carved.  Sadly, a huge argument broke out over who would get piece #17...ultimately, my wife shamed the 12 year old into giving it up.

Highly recommended!!!

Absolutely delicious. I typically like to marinate food for awhile to ensure the meat is tasty. Did not have to do it with this recipe at all. Tasted GREAT fresh out of the oven and was STILL delicious after reheating. Instead of using fresh bread crumbs, I used one of those ready made Italian breadcrumbs. It was GREAT. Highly recommended!!!!

This is a very simple recipe for any cooking level.  I don't cook a lot of lamb so I figured I would try a simple recipe.  I changed it a little bit to suit my pallet.  OUTSTANDING.  Use this recipe as a base and change it to make one of your own!

This recipe was the bomb! Made it for Christmas dinner and it was a feast. Do not change the recipe one bit. I even used the bread crumbs, minced garlic, and rosemary mixture on some chicken thighs for those people who do not like lamb - and it tastes delicious. I highly recommend this for any special occasion.

My hubby and I both loved this recipe.  The only thing I would do next time (and there WILL be a next time)is reduce the salt-perhaps not season the rack itself with salt...Thanks for the recipe!

Great flavor and tenderness. If you use seasoned bread crumbs, leave out some of the salt in the recipe. Also at the end, take the lamb out of the pan to rest so the bottom doesn't reabsorb the oils.

Simple. Easy. Just plain delicious.  BTW, I used Panko for a great crunch.

Perfect!  I skipped the garlic and used crushed garlic focaccia croutons in place of the bread crumbs.

Was great!!
Bought a slab at the local WM for around $5.  Seared the lamb, and while I was doing that, I had some charcoal heating up in the grill.
Grilled until meat thermometer said around 150.  Lamb shared the grill with some asparagus seasoned with salt +pepper.
Also made the pumpkin cheesecake II recipe.
Was delicious!  Will probably use the breading for other things as well (steaks, chicken, pork).

Only downside was the quality of the meat from WM.  I'd buy at a meat market if possible, and will definitely recommend this to others.

Delish!  Definitely cut back on the salt because it was way too salty.  Otherwise, a terrific recipe. Will make it again, and again, and again....

Made this tonight. I had two small 8-rib racks I bought at Sam's Club. I used a bit more garlic, half of the salt (as recommended by other reviewers) and a bit more olive oil. It was still enough for both racks. My husband (who is a big eater) and I could only eat 1 rack. Cooked it 12 minutes and let it rest for 5. It was simply amazing. Served with baked potato and steamed asparagus. Absolutely loved this. Amazing.

Made this for Valentine's Day/husband's birthday dinner and it was a big hit! I adjusted it like "msp" suggested by sauteing the garlic and some shallots in olive oil then adding the rosemary, thyme and the bread crumbs. I also used very little salt. I baked the lamb for 12 minutes and then an additional 2-3 minutes and it turned out a beautiful medium rare. Only suggestion by my husband was to finish it off under the broiler for a few minutes to crisp up the bread crumb "crust" and eliminate the additional 2-3 minutes of baking.

Very good. Tasted like it was coked at a 5 star restaurant. I added a little more garlic to the recipe just because I like garlic. I added some garlic while searing the lamb. Lot's of fun to cook. I made it for our Valentines Day dinner. My wife smiled loved it.

THE SALT WAS OVERWHELMING! I say it like that since I forgot having read other people's comments and put in almost the entire amount of salt the recipe calls for... way too much. YET, the recipe is easy, incredibly delicious and simply spot on. I used Costco lamb, and it turned out so tender and fine it's amazing, what you can do with such few and simple ingredients, and in no time! This goes in my special recipe book (minus salt).

This is THE BEST recipe I have ever used for lamb. The mixture of bread crumbs, oil, garlic etc creates a layer of flavor so rich and complimentary to the lamb that I could hardly believe it. Great recipe, made as is, no changes.

I love to cook, somehow, I never made a rack of lamb. Always opted for lamb chops or lamb steak. 
It was time to give it go. I used this recipe. Made a slight adjustment, only because my husband and I are low carb eaters. 
I simply subbed the 1/2 cup of bread cups to 1/4 c of Almond meal. Figured the Almond meal was more finely ground, so I used less. 
Kept everything else the same, except the pre-seasoning salt and pepper, Did not measure just liberally seasoned. 
It was fantastic!!!! Loved it, and it was low carb to boot! Thank you so much!  I am adding this to one of our often made meals. Thanks Jennine!!!! :))
P.S. Bought the Frenched 8 bone Rack of lamb at Trader Joe's.

This was my first experience cooking lamb- thanks for making it such a good one!  I used an electric thermometer that stays in the meat, really the only way to go to avoid over/under cooking!  It took about 22mins, but I had just pulled the lamb from the fridge.  I pulled the lamb out 5 degrees before done, I would suggest pulling it out 10 degrees before it's done and letting it sit as mine cooked another 10 degrees on the counter.

This was a great recipe.  My store did not have rack of lamb so I got a butterflied lamb leg I reduced the heat to 350 and cooked it for 45 mins and it was perfect.  This was only because for the thicker cut of meat it needs to cook slower.  Still came out delicious.  I did reduce salt to only on the rub none in the breading.

This is my go-to rub for any cut of lamb. The flavors marry with the meat so well, I always get rave reviews--even from people who say they "hate" lamb.

This was finger licking good.  Because I didn't let the rack of lamb sit at room temperature, I left it in the over for about 7 additional minutes.  It came out perfectly tender with a little bit of pink meat left in the center.

This was my first time cooking lamb and it came out good. I thought it was a tad on the bland side. I think I will use more Dijon mustard next time and a bit more seasoning in the bread crumb mixture. Overall a good recipe.

Really really really good.  I cooked a small rack for 30 mins at 350 and it turnied out perfectly.  I also used oats rather than bread crumbs and it was perfect. Thanks for the recipe!

This is the second time I've made this recipe.  It wasn't bad the first time around, but it was by far better the second time around.  Any time I can get my kids to eat lamb, I know it rocks!!  This recipe is definitely a keeper in the stable.

The flavor was good, but I halved the rosemary and garlic, and even then it was a bit over-powering.  I halved the salt based on others' recommendations, as well.  I cooked it twice as long as indicated before it got to the correct temperature.  It was moist and tender and had a good flavor, but just a bit too much flavor.  Thank you for sharing it.  I have always wanted to try to make lamb.

I loved this recipe and so did my boyfriend!!!  I followed the directions to the tee, and it came out perfect. Next time I will leave in the oven about another 7 minutes. I like mine more well done.

I used a panko and bread crumb mixture for a more satisfying crunch. This is extremely good and you need not be a fan of lamb or dijon to apprecaite it.

Excellent!!! This was my first try at cooking Lamb. My husband and I loved it and will make this again. I did use less salt and cooked it for 30 min. Left everything else the same.

I also added a little fresh orange juice and peel to this recipe!  1/2 tsp. orange peel and I rubbed the meat with the juice before the bread crumbs.  It added a little sweetness!

I needed a recipe that would assist me in cooking my 2 racks of lamb, which I've never made.  I was a little apprehensive, because it isn't the cheapest meat to experiment with!  I was also looking for something that would incorporate rosemary and garlic.  Neither my husband or I care for mustard so I left it out, and I used panko instead of bread crumbs.  I didn't measure the garlic or rosemary, I just added till it "felt right".  I mainly used this recipe for the technique, and Sweet Jumpin' Jehosaphat on a Pogo Stick, did I ever get what I was looking for!!  I especially appreciated the footnotes and the instruction to cover the end of the bones with foil.  The result was a perfectly medium-rare rack of lamb that my husband and I both felt was better than any restaurant's rack of lamb we'd ever eaten!

Very good.  I used panko bread crumbs for that extra crunch.  I also added a teaspoon of balsamic vinegar to the Dijon mustard.

I served it on a bed of garlic mashed potatoes and grilled asparagus. All surrounded by bit of lamb stock reduction for added flavor.

Absolutely WONDERFUL!

Outstanding!!! Tonight I fixed my husband an English, and I used this recipe. He is English so he grew up on this type of food, but this was my first time cooking it for him. I used this recipe and didn't change a thing, and it was outstanding! Thanks a lot for a great recipe.

This was as good as any rack of lamb I have ever had.  I did cut back on the salt and used whole grain bread to make the fresh crumbs. I threw the garlic and rosemary in the food processor while it was running, so that the rosemary would get chopped very fine, adding the bread chunks at the end to make the crumbs.  Taking the lamb out of the fridge for awhile before baking makes it cook more evenly and quickly to keep it tender.  Lamb is rare at 140 degrees, medium at 160 degrees and well done at 170 degrees.

My husband loved it. I have a brand new oven and I definetly had to add 20 minutes onto the cooking time. Also,make sure you do not overcoat with breadcrumbs. Too many breadcrumbs made it a little soggy. Overall, great dish!!!

This is an excellent recipe that makes lamb easy for beginners and still gives you a very pretty and delicious dish! Do not skip the searing...very important and keep a close eye so not to overcook.  Lamb can go from just right to overcooked in a very short time.

This recipe is GREAT!  My family just loved it.  I didn't cut down on the salt at all like others had suggested.  We dine out a great deal and like our foods with a lot of flavor.  We just had it for Christmas (OK, not your usual meal) and already I've had 3 people ask for the recipe.  It's so easy too.  Even with 3 racks, I just seared each separately and then put all 3 in a large Calphalon shallow roasting pan.

This was great.  I didn't have bread crumbs but used what I had on hand, which was panko.  Although the lamb was at room temperature when I started cooking it took about 1/2 hour as we like it medium.  It came out tender and juicy. I'll have to try this with beef and pork as was suggested.

This was absolutely delicious.  I deviated a little bit: I cooked two lamb shanks instead of a rack of lamb.  The only adjustment I made was that I had to bake it at a lower temperature, and for about 30 minutes.  It was wonderful, and very tender!

The coating on this is awesome! Be sure to use a meat thermometer, and most importantly, put it in the correct spot. If the thermometer is too close to one of the bones, you will get an incorrect reading - as i did and the meat was way too rare.

OH MY GOODNESS!! This was the first time I have ever made Rack of lamb...it melted in our mouths. I had two racks of about 8 or 9 bones. I doubled the recipe. It was out-of-this-world good. I served with baby potatoes and broccoli. I will definitely make this again.

I made this recipe  and loved every last bite of it.
Just fabulous.  If I had to alter it it would be to used less salt and if needed add it at the table. Otherwise it was just delish and I will make this all the time when we get a craving for lamb.  Good enough for a dinner party!!!!!

YUM!!! I picked this recipe to serve for Easter dinner, based on the reviews, but really, I was thinking- it can't be THAT good, maybe they didn't publish the bad reviews. Don't think that- this is awesome, awesome lamb! It didn't have that heavy gamey taste and the crusty part was so yummy!
Instead of breadcrumbs I used crushed breakfast cereal, because I didn't have breadcrumbs at home, and I used less salt (based on other reviews) I also used fresh thyme along with the rosemary and I cooked the meat longer, because I like mine well done.
When I first read the directions, I was afraid it would be difficult, but after I started it was so easy. I never imagined that it could be so easy, quick and look great for presentation, too. Everybody enjoyed it and I will be making this again!

The lamb turned out very tasty.  It was moist and flavorful.  I used the grainy dijon musturd, which gave it a little more texture to the dish.  Loved it and will make again.

Outstanding.  Made this for the hubby and me last night.  Restaurant quality meal and definitely company worthy.  I cooked it a little longer than stated, but I took it right out of the fridge.  Definitely will repeat this one.

While many at my dinner party enjoyed these very much, I thought they lacked flavor.  I had never had lamb before, so maybe I just am not used to that kind of flavor.  I would make them again and maybe change up the seasoning. This was a fun recipe to make and it looks impressive!

We had this for Christmas dinner.  I made it with gluten free bread crumbs and a simple mint, sugar and lemon water sauce.  It was an incredible HIT!  I will get one rack without the fat for myself next time but my husband LOVED it fat on. Delish!

Excellent! I did have to cook it a bit longer than the suggested 18 minutes for medium (about 25 minutes), but maybe I need to have my oven calibrated.

delicious! and easy to make! i didnt use the full 2 tablespoon of salt and it was just perfect. i've made this multiple times, once i didnt have any bread crumbs on hand so i toasted two slices of bread and then crumbled it, no one really noticed the difference. the best i've made was with italian bread crumbs, definitely dont need as much salt if you use this mod.

This is definitely a five star meal - I've made it a couple of times, and it's been amazing each time.  It's relatively simple to prepare, the only modification I made is to skip the step of seasoning the rack with salt and pepper prior to searing - I find the coating adds enough flavour that this step can be skipped.  With garlic mashed potatoes and a glass of red wine, it's a phenomenal meal.  I highly recommend this one, especially for guys like me who like to impress the women in our life every now and again...  ;)

Crazy good recipe - better than what you'd find at many good restaurants. I made it with tabbouleh and a great dried cherry, feta and walnut salad. What a great dinner...

I Loved this!  I substituted regular bread crumbs with Panko, and, because I'm not a huge fan of rosemary, I used 1/2 the quantity of fresh rosemary.  My guests loved this, too, and I'll do it again!  It's a keeper!

Fantastic! Made last night pretty much as directed. Used garlic panko for the breading. So yum, we had none left. Also very easy...was in the oven longer then indicated on the recipe, but no biggie. Served with garlic mashed potatos and brocoli. Will be looking for sales on rack of lamb and do this again very soon.

This is a spectacular recipe. Like several other reviewers I used panko crumbs which turned out very well. I found the mustard worked effectively to 'stick' the crumb mixture to the lamb. With garlic mashed potatoes, and roasted carrots and asparagus topped with feta cheese this rivaled any restaurant meal. Thanks for sharing the recipe Jennine.

This was FANTASTIC!!!  The recipe was very easy to follow and the results were incredible.  My first time cooking lamb, and I came off looking like a pro.    I am going to try this recipe with beef.  I think the dijon mustard rub and bread crumb coating would be equally delicious on a prime rib or beef tenderloin.  Thanks so much for a great recipe!

Well, what can I say that everyone else is not saying, it was great! It was hard not to go off on my own and try adding somthing to the recipe or cut back on others, don't. I always like to try the dish just as submitted for the first run and then I will make it my own. I really have to say the only change for the next rack will be to omit the second tsp of salt that goes straight on the meat. But I will keep the salt recomended in the bread crumbs. By the way it was the first time we have ever had a rack of lamb, I was not really ever big on the tast lamb, until now.

I absolutely loved this recipe! The meat was super oily when I seared it so next time I'm not using any olive oil in the pan. Two bones cannot be a single serving. It's too little! Yum!!!!

I'm a recent lover of lamb, and this recipe is one reason.  I've made this now about 6 times, just as it says, and every time it turns out great!  I will sometimes double the breading mixture because it is just that good.  I could eat that stuff by the spoonful.
Some tips, having made this a few times:  definitely let your meat come up to room temp first, or close to it.  Make sure you let it rest a full 10 minutes or more if you can handle the wait - it definitely makes a difference; 5-7 minutes just doesn't seem enough, from my experience.
I like to serve this with a balsamic reduction.  YUM.

If you have family members that are "afraid" of lamb, or that think they don't like it, I would suggest having them try this recipe.  Simple yet delicious.

Very good! I used an 8 bone rack. The crust really has a nice flavor. I followed the recipe exactly (minus putting the foil over the bones!) & it came out great. Prior to baking I did take the lamb out of the fridge to rest for about an hour. I also reduced some balsamic vinegar in a pan for about 5 or so minutes & drizzled it over the lamb...amazing! But it's still good without it too.

I did not like this at all.  I am very upset I spent that much money on a rack of lamb when the taste wasn't there I think the breadcrumbs ruined it!

I dont have any experience with cooking lamb, and this turned out to be a disaster.

I got the frenched rack of lamb from Costco, and followed the recipe. I stuck a meat thermometer into the rack before I stuck it in the oven.

It took about 22 mins to reach 135F. I removed from oven at that point, and let it rest for about 10 mins. When I cut the lollipops, it was all raw and bloody, surely not how I wanted it :(

I pan-seared the lollipops at this point, to salvage the meat. Its edible, but it didnt turn out the way I would have expected it to.

This is an awesome recipe, and quite simple to prepare!  I love to try roasted rack of lamb wherever I go; mostly at some of the finer establishments..... this turned out better than any I've ever had.  Keys to this.. nice fresh, good quality rack of lamb.  Don't skimp on any of the ingredients; use the best.  Cast iron works best for this.. smoking hot.  Last, use a instant read meat thermometer to test preferred doneness.  You will be rewarded with fine restaurant quality cuisine.  You will amaze your guests with your culinary skills.... My Sweetheart was on Valentines Day!!

My mother-in-law is Greek and this is how she taught me to make lamb for Hubby!  Hadn't made it in a long time, didn't read the recipe right and breaded the lamb before I seared it - it burned a little but didn't taste burned!  Wonderful either way!

This was my first try at cooking lamb.  I was scared since my husband's family raises lamb.  Only buy American lamb (there is my plug).  I cooked it like someone else suggested.  I cooked at 350 degrees for 45 minutes, then 15 minutes at 400 and then an additional 15 minutes at 400 degrees after the ribs were sliced.  I would recommend cutting down the last 15 minutes so that they are closer to medium rare.  I would try about 7-10 minutes.  We all loved them even my 5 year old daughter.  Great recipe that I will use always or at least when my pocket book can afford rack of lamb again.

This is a great recipe! A few tips:
1) use half the salt - that's what I did and even a tiny bit more would have been too much.
2) I like it medium - when the red has just gone but it is still tender and juicy. To achieve this I cooked it at 400 for exactly 30 minutes and then turned it down to about 270 for another 15 minutes. This made the bread crumb coating a bit too toasted and brown and dry but it was still really good.
3) This is not 4 servings - it is exactly two. I doubled everything (except salt)and had exactly 4 servings.
4) I used 2 1/2 Teaspoons of dried rosemary and it was just right. (don't forget that I doubled the recipe)
But it's very good, and doesn't need any other changes, in my opinion!

This was very easy to make and so good!  The presentation was wonderful, too.  Since we like our lamb rare--very, very rare!--after 5 minutes at 450°, I turned the broiler on for 7 minutes.  Perfect, perfect!

I just made this tonight.  HOLY MOLY!!! Total home run!  I added a splash of balsamic & worcestershire sauce.  This was an absolute home run!  I will only make rack of lamb this way from now on.  Paired it with a gourmet mint jelly.  To die for!

So good ! If your rack has a lot of fat trim it down a little so that the searing and  high oven temp doesn't cause excessive smoking. Let the meat come to room temperature and check for the degree of doneness with  a decent thermometer , mine took slightly longer than I expected. This is great for just a family meal or a party as once the racks are seared they can all roast in the oven together. Such a treat!

It was fantastic, at least to my parents. Do not recommend this for kids. However, my mother, a big lamb eater, just simply adored them. WARNING, ADULT DINNER ONLY!!??

Easy to prepare and fantastic flavor.  Used dried rosemary as fresh was not available.  Took about 18 minutes for desired doneness.

Loved the recipe!  It took a bit longer than the 18 mins but that's probably our older oven.

This was the first that I actually cooked lamb.  This recipe was just amazing.  The only thing I would change about it, is adding less salt, otherwise, we will be making this again.

My husband loved this recipe. He said they were the best lamb chops he's had in years. My daughter of 11 liked them, too. She is sometimes hard to please, but her first words were "These are really good!"

Made this for my son & my nephew with New Zealand racks of lamb from Sam's Club. Doubled the recipe. Five stars, hands down. We have had grilled rack of lamb numerous times, which is fantastic, but this is even better. Moist & delicious!

This is delicious and I have made it about 3 times now, but all three times with different cuts of lamb. I used a lamb shoulder tonight, but really, this is a great way to prepare the lamb regardless of the type of lamb you are using. Instead of Dijon mustard, I used regular mustard since that is what I already had in the house and it came out super tasty and seasoned well. I also put a little bit more olive oil in the breading mixture so that it sticks to the meat better. I obviously love this recipe and that is why I keep using it! Try it! Yummy!

This is the first time I have ever written a review after trying many recipes.  This was absolutely outstanding.  My wife says it is the best main course that she has EVER had.  The garlic, rosemary and dijon all could be tasted.  I will save this recipe for the next "special" dinner that I am cooking.

Fabulous and easy! The lamb is fantastic, but I've also used the rub on steak and pork, and it is equally scrumptious.

Second time having lamb (first time was awful) and this recipe was great. We have food allergies, so I had to make a couple substitions: Chex rice in place of bread crumbs, omitted garlic, used aged balsamic vinegar in place of mustard. The lamb was a little too pink for me, so I seared the individual chops on the stovetop after baking.

Just a great recipe, when we have lamb chops this is the only one to use.  I always make a beefstock and red wine gravy to go with this.  wonderful :)

Awesome. I used dried bread crumbs, and roasted it for about 18 minutes in a cast iron skillet after searing, and it was perfect. This will definitely become a go-to for me.

I used lamb chops with this recipe. At first i was worried that it wouldn't work, but they were delicious. I browned the chops, brushed with mustard, then rolled the edges of the chop in the breadcrumb mix. I baked them at 400 degrees for about 8-10 minutes, until they were medium. Put it atop baby red garlic mashed potatoes, sided with sweet corn and a strawberry almond spinach salad. The breadcrumb edges gave the perfect amount of seasoning and crunch, and the mustard gave it just a touch of tang. Possibly one of the best meals I've ever made.

I made this today for Easter.  It was delicious and idiot proof.  The center was medium rare and the side chops were medium well.  Everyone loved it!  This recipe is a keeper.  I omitted all salt and used a champagne mustard.  Wonderful!

YUMMMMO - Cooked this recipe exactly as the recipe states - did cook the lamb for 22 minutes in total for medium, how we like it, it was gorgeous, very succulent and the rosemary/garlic/breadcrumb crust was scrumptous.

I followed this recipe to the T and it was excellent, I don't think you need to reduce the salt at all. If anything I might try using different herbs as some have suggested, but again, this is great just like it is.    All the recipes I try I run them by my kids and my kids loved these. We will be having these for Easter this year. I also loved how beautiful they looked when they were finished.  I will put this in my box and make them when we have dinner guests.

Excellent!!! After reading the ratings, I used Panko and less salt by not salting the lamb. There was enough salt in the mixture and it was perfect! The crust was very tasty! There was another recommendation to serve Ratatouille (of course I found a good recipe at allrecipes.com) with the lamb - a very nice complement to the dinner. We've not eaten rack of lamb nor had Ratatouille, but will repeat both recipes!

Awesome! Per others' suggestions, I cut back on the salt a bit. Other than that, I followed the recipe perfectly. it was a huge hit with all of us!

This is a wonderful recipe and i agree that many people who wouldn't necessarily eat lamb are easily converted with this dish...try this lamb cold the next day and you will be surprised at how tasty this is when the seasoning has a chance to work it's magic...note i substitute one tablespoon of chili oil to give it a slight kick and also add a touch of brandy !!!

Love this recipe!  My husband LOVES to have lamb whenever we go to a nice restaurant.  I had never attempted lamb before so I was a bit nervous.   The first time I made it he was WOWED by my lamb cooking skills! Today will be my fourth time making it for him.  I do the recipe exactly as written and have been thrilled every single time.

First of all, I don't know who is testing these recipes, but they are never done in the time they say - I cooked this longer than it said, and it still wasn't done. If you're going to write a recipe, get the time right - what are you using, a blast furnace?????

This is best lamb i have ever had. Took a risk and cooked it as the first dish i cooked for my girlfriend, and it was awesome, the only problem now is that she expected everything to be at this standard.

I decreased the salt a lot and used 1/2 t of dried rosemary. Other than that, I used dried bread crumbs because I was lazy. Never will I do that again.

First I have tested this recipe with just 3 pieces of lamb rib chop, i didn't have rosemary. I seasoned the lamb with salt and pepper, so I mixed the seasoning with some dried basil and oregano.(just some not a lot) baked for good 12 -15 minutes! turn out great! Because of that, I went and bought a rack of lamb and modify this recipe a bit with the ones that I found on food network.com First, season with salt and pepper, seared all sides in very hot oil for about 3 minutes each side. (till u see a good brown color). Then, I apply a layer of mustard powder/mustard on both sides, then some minced up garlic, press and coat it all over the lamb. Finally, I prepare a mixture that combines bread crumbs, rosemary, pepper, salt, olive oil, Parmesan cheese (a lot!). Coat it on top of the garlic then baked it in a pre heated oven 450F for about 18-20 minutes (i checked at 12 and 15 minutes, but the center was uncooked at all) if you have an internal thermometer, the center of the lamb is ready to be served when it hits 130 F. I have cut it up and served with some mint pesto on the side, very delicious! definitely cook it again

Followed the recipe as written, except I used dry Italian-flavored breadcrumbs instead of fresh breadcrumbs.  I doubled the recipe ingredients because I was cooking 2 racks of lamb. This made WAY too much coating. If you're making 2 racks, use the amounts as given. If you're only making 1 rack, I reccomend cutting the breadcrumb mix ingredient amounts in half. You'll just end up throwing alot of the coating out if you don't.  Cooked the lamb in the oven for 16 minutes. Checked the temp, which was 151. Let the lamb rest for 5 minutes. It came out a perfect MED-RARE.  Taste was awesome! Good "lamb" taste without being too "lamby" (for lack of a better way of putting it!). Meat was very moist and juicy. Coating was tasty and complemented the taste of the lamb very well. Thumbs up!!

Absolutely fantastic!!! Came out just beautiful & juicy. The only thing I changed was the garlic, which I substituted with minced garlic & Jalapeno. Otherwise everything was left untouched & followed to a "T". I severed it on a "hill" of rice, with the lamb strategically placed/leaned around it, & drizzled some sauce around the plate & up the "hill". My girlfriend was blown away by this, & thought she was at a restaurant! It looked fantastic & the tasted even better… Would highly recommend for any romantic dinner, or dinner party… Mind you my New Zealand 8 bone rack of lamb was just enough for the two of use, sparing only one!... It was just that good.

Awesome - will make every time.  We do not care for dijon, but used it & it was not overwhelming, but a good complement to the lamb.  I used a 8-9 bone rack and it took closer to 20 min to cook to 125 degrees in the center.  Delicious!

WOW !!! Oki , i am so not a meat lover and even i LOVED this dish ! picked a slightly fatty rack from Costco ( as opposed to lean ) , eliminated salt altogether and halved the garlic . I read the reviews and followed "msp"s advice on heating the olive oil with garlic, a splash of balsamic vinegar and a smaller splash of worchester sauce ( i used two drops ) ,italian seasoned breadcrumbs and added a mixture of rosemary , thyme and sage ( I found it in Jewel and is called " fresh poultry bouquet". Set it aside, and used for coating later on.  I dont have a roaster yet so made it in a pyrex .. i like well -done, so took me what ? almost 40 mins i guess .  At the end, this was PHENOMENAL ! THANK YOU !

Superb!  I reccomend using a thermometer to ensure you don't overcook the lamb.  They should reach an internal temp of 145F for med rare.

Amazing!  I would not say it's all that easy, but definitely worth the effort.  I mixed some balsamic vinegar with the Dijon mustard and sauteed the garlic before mixing it in.  It came out so perfect that I looked like a gourmet chef. Hard to beat this!

This is my all-time favorite recipe on the allrecipes site.  It is perfection.  Growing up in the US, I never really ate lamb outside of Greek and Middle Eastern food.  While in Japan, I had to make Xmas dinner for an Aussie mate and of course there are no turkeys or hams or beef roasts or even ovens large enough to accomodate them, so I decided to cook lamb for the first time in my life.  This was so delicious we couldn't even stop to talk to each other.  I've made it in both Japan and the US, and in Japan they have only panko bread crumbs and I definitely prefer panko.  I reduced the salt by half. The rack also takes longer to cook than stated, so be sure to use a thermometer and watch closely.  It can rise in temperature pretty suddenly. I have tried the coating with pork and steaks also.  It's best not to use too lean cuts of meat though, because then the coating overpowers the meat.  This pairs well with "Onions Baked with Rosemary and Cream" from this site. Once again, the most delicious thing on this site!!

My husband is Greek, so he grew up eating lamb all the time. I had never cooked it before and decided to try this recipe. My mother-in-law must have been so green with envy when my husband told her it was absolutely the best lamb he had ever had!

I made this for Valentine's Day dinner, and it was a big hit!  It was so easy, and the results were delicious!  Like some of the other reviews warned, the bread crumb mixture makes way too much.  Next time I will cut it in half.  I had let the rack of lamb sit on the counter for about 45 minutes or so while I was preparing side dishes, etc.  It cooked much quicker than other reviews said, and it was an even cook.  All in all, it was in the oven for 20 minutes and came out cooked perfectly (Medium).  I will be making this again!!

This recipe was delicious!! I made it for Valentine's Day dinner with my boyfriend and he and I both devoured it. We are both beginner cooks but this recipe was very straightforward. The only problem we came across was it took us a lot longer to cook the rack. Maybe because our lamb rack was big? We eventually just cut the rack apart between the bones into individual pieces and popped them back in the oven for 5 to 10 minutes on 350 or so. They came out medium - medium-well and very tender! We will definitely be making this dish again! YUM.

This was absolutely incredible!  I followed the recipe exactly except I didn't have fresh rosemary so I used 1 Tbs of dried crushed rosemary.  The fresh herbs would make it even more wonderful I'm sure.  My rack of lamb was small (only cooking for two) so there was a lot of herb-crumb mixture which I generously packed all over it.  It took a bit longer to cook than I expected but when it was done we were in heaven.  Will definitely make again and again!  Served with herb roasted red potatoes and green beans seasoned with garlic, mushrooms and a bit of basalmic vinegar.  To die for!

This was my first attempt cooking lamb, and it turned out delicious.  Because we like our lamb a little more well done, after 1/2 hr at 400 degrees, we sliced the rack into individual chops and then cooked it for another 15-20 minutes. Yummy!

When I opened the lamb package I found 2 racks of lamb.7-8 bones each. I was worried because there was only 3 of us eating. No worries though,we ate all but 6 ribs that were ate the next day. A very good recipe. I usally make my lamb in a greek style. But this is very good for a different spin. Very tender, a melt in your mouth good. I will make this again.

I have to admit, I was a little skeptical regarding how my first attempt at lamb would come out. ..but I have to be honest in saying I was quite impressed with this recipe. I actually modified things a little bit. I had lamb top round instead of a rack or chops but the general principles still worked well and the mustard/herb combination was quite a hit. (So much so a dear friend went as far to say the meal could have been classified as 'gourmet'....and coming from a man who has spent time in the food industry, that was certainly a compliment!) What I did is I salt and peppered the rounds and then pan seared them over a gas flame. I let them rest and after sitting for about 10 minutes coated them with a standard dijon mustard. I then dredged them in the dry mixture (in which I used italian bread crumbs) and put them on a 350 degree grill. They cooked for about 5 minutes per side once on the grill. I think when I make them again I will go for somewhere in the ballpark of 8-9 minutes per side. Obviously lamb isn't supposed to be well done but it was a little more pink than I typically prefer. Even though they were a little more rare than I liked the taste was still wonderful. I certainly highly recommend this recipe. Blessings on your next cooking endeavor!

This recipe was excellent! I had to cook it a little longer, about 25 min. for medium rare. Next time I will let it sit out for a whole hour to get to room temp. before cooking, as another reviewer suggested.

This was a delicious and elegant meal with very little prep.  I did have to cook the rack longer than stated (and we wanted rare) but otherwise everything was perfect.

I have never cooked lamb before, and thought this recipe looked fairly simple. I was amazed that I could cook something that tasted so good! My boyfriend licked the plate clean, and my family are lining up to try it after his reviews!

This recipe was absolutely amazing! In my opinion, the meat between the bones is the best part (besides, you are paying for it!) I did not trim that out. I have never cooked lamb before, and this was so simple!

I've mentioned to my husband that I would love to cook a rack of lamb.  He came home with 2 racks and I came across your recipe.  I had NO CLUE how to make this dish, but this recipe is SO EASY to do!!  I coated my racks with olive oil and seasoned with sea salt and fresh cracked pepper.  I let it marinate in the fridge for a couple of hours and then seared them in olive oil.  I also had to cook it for a little longer about 30 mintues to get more of a pink center.  The crust came out very flavorful.  My daughter loved it.  Leftovers hold up well too.  My daughter took it for lunch for school the next day.  Boy...her classmates were impressed!!

This recipe is awesome; I can't say enough about it expect that I burnt my hand on the pan when I pulled it out of the oven - it was well worth it though.  I did not change a thing on this recipe.  My husband and I love it!

It was amazing!!!  We just modified the recipe alittle by using 1-1/2 TBSP of dry rosemary instead of fresh.  Also we run out of Dijon Mustard so we made our own, by mixing honey dijon barbeque sauce and mustard.  Plus, we found that the cooking time had to be longer (45 mins for medium-well).

I have tried many recipes from this site but have never posted a review, this one was too good not too. I made it exactly as the directions say. It did take a little longer to cook but a used a meat thermometer so no big deal. I will try this recipe with pork chops or a pork tenderloin. Thanks for a delicious recipe. My favorite so far!

Amazing recipe. So simple! I agree with the reviewer who said the roasting time was not long enough, though. I wonder if there's something to do with freshness (since my lamb was previously frozen coming from New Zealand) and it took me 30+ minutes to get to medium rare, and usually my oven temp is pretty accurate, and I started the sear portion after letting the lamb warm to room temp and also put a pretty good sear on all sides.

Giving five stars because unlike the top rated critical reviewer, I had sides that were short to prep-- couscous and a salad-- so I just started those when the lamb was ready to come out and it was perfect! Not my first rodeo with uncertain roasting times for meat!  

I would put a critical ingredient on this recipe, and any other meat recipe, a meat thermometer!

FANTSTIC!!!  Made this exactly as written and it was beautiful. It was melt in your mouth tender and perfectly seasoned.  I wouldn't change a thing.  i have been very nervous about having my neighbor over for dinner since he is a chef...I have now found the meal to impress him for a change!  A Greek salad was very nice with this.
Thank you so much for this recipe.

An absolutely fabulous recipe, and sheer simplicity to boot.  The only change I would make is to cut everything by 1/2.  As it stands, there is enough bread crumb mixture to do at least THREE 7- or 8-bone racks.  I either freeze most of what the recipe makes or throw it away.

Awesome recipe.  I've been eyeing an 8 rib lamb cut in my store forever, but the $15 price curbed my appetite.  After I saw this recipe, I decided to bite the bullet.  I am so elated I did.  This may become my holiday centerpiece.  While the recipe sounds time consuming, it actually comes to the table faster than any holiday entree I've done before.

Get over the intimidation of Lamb.Yum! This my first attempt at preparing this dish. I typically reserve it for nice dinner dates in which a chef prepares it. I will no longer spend astronomical dollars on a meal that is soooooo easy to prepare. My family loved it. We were literally still thinking about it at bedtime and I walked away feeling like this was the easiest and most rewarding meal I have ever made.I purchased packaged lamb from Sam's Club and 2 racks of seven were in there which was perfect for my family of 4. All of my ingredients were fresh down to the bread crumbs. I didn't have stale bread so I purchased a French loaf the eve before and cored the inside then toasted under the broiler. Tip-If your bread is too soft it will stick in a gummy manner in your blender/processor. I recommend taking your lamb out of the fridge no less than an hour before to bring the chill off considerably for a precise cooking time. Go easy on the Dijon and salt as they can be overpowering.  I cooked mine according to directions and left it slightly pick in the center. If you overcook it or prepare it until it is well done it will be tough. Remember fresh is best and good luck!

I do not eat lamb, but my other half enjoyed it very much.  It was actually my first time every making lamb so I was a bit nervous about how it would turn out. I followed the recipe exactly, except I used Lamb Chops because my store did not have a rack of lamb.  He did say he would like for me to make this for him again.

Wonderful.  Knocked my husbands socks off.  He doesn't usually care for lamb.  Poured a Keenan Syrah that was equally wonderful.  Will make again for sure.

Delicious, tender, flavorful lamb.  I used dried rosemary and reduced the amount to 1 Tbsp, because I didn't have any fresh on hand.  I cooked my 1.5 lb rack for 15 minutes at 450, reduced the temperature to 400 for another 5 minutes and then rested it for 5 minutes, and it was a perfect medium.

I have never cooked rack of lamb before so I was very anxious about cooking it.  I found this recipe and decided to try it. I substituted the Dijon with honey mustard only because that was all I had. It turned out great but it definitely took longer than the suggested 18 minutes. I ended up cooking it for almost 38 minutes. Turned out great

I'm addicted to this recipe! I've made it without the bread crumbs, and it's still super tasty! I've stopped measuring the dijon and just use the amount needed to cover the entire rack (usually more than 1 tbl). I have never been able to bake it for only 12-18 min, usually needs around 25-30 min for me to get medium-rare, and meat thermometers are awesome!!!

Just made these tonight. Lamb turned out very moist, but it was very salty, I already reduced the salt to 1 1/4 tsp, next time, I would only use 1 tsp salt.

My husband and step-daughter had never had lamb before.  I saw a petite rack at the store (8 bones) and picked it up.  I followed the recipe exactly, and my only note is that, like other reviewers, the time was off slightly for Medium rare meat, but good lord, who cares??  My husband thought it was so good and pretty, he literally got out his smart phone, went to everyone's plate, and took pictures of the lamb as it was served.  My step-daughter was SILENT throughout the ENTIRE MEAL, which NEVER happens.  When she was done, she offered to do the dishes whenever I made it again in hopes I would make it again soon, and asked if instead of going out to eat for her birthday next year, if I could just make the same recipe of rack of lamb.  This stuff literally almost had us moaning (ok, some of us did moan) at the table. EXQUISITE.

This is the best lamb we have ever had, including any 5 star restaurant we have been to. The recipe was easy and we had all of the ingredients at home aleady. I did use a spicey chipotle mustard in place of the Dijon and it was amazing. Highly recommended.

I wish there was a feature to add MORE STARS!  This recipe was one of the best things that I have ever made.  EVER!  My only advice is to amend the cooking time because, at least for me, the lamb ended up needing to be cooked almost double the recommended time.   It was fortunate that I made this dish for my family, because if I had been preparing it for company I would've been embarrassed that the timing of my dishes was so off.  Still, a wonderful, wonderful recipe.  Thank you so much!  And the video tutorial was fantastic; it was right-on and gave me a lot of confidence to approach an intimidating piece of meat.  Thanks again!!

Superb!!  I followed the recipe exactly as indicated.  The only thing I would change next time, would be extending the cooking time. I found the meat to be a little on the raw side.  Other than that, the flavors were amazing!  Thanks for a really good recipe.

I made this for Christmas dinner last night and it was the best lamb I've ever had. I used panko flakes instead of bread crumbs (which is the norm in my house,) and kosher salt. It didn't even need mint sauce or mint jelly. The 12-minute oven time for rare was perfect. (1.5 lb. rack from Costco.) It served 2 of us and there's one large rib for left for my dinner tonight. Served it with scalloped potatoes, also from Costco.

I loved this!  It was very expensive, but paid off for my family, my 2 year old daughter kept asking for more even after we told her there was no more, could definately have used 2 racks, althought then it would have been a $40 dinner.

Great recipe; easy to prepare with awesome results - I added quartered fingerling potatoes tossed with olive oil, salt, pepper and rosemary into pan with lamb. Panko crumbs made a nice crisp coating.

I'd never attempted lamb before thinking it was too tricky.  This recipe makes it nearly THE most uncomplicated, easy and seriously delicious entree I now can make without hours of effort!!  We absolutely loved it!!  I've made it several times now, even for a family birthday dinner knowing it will come out just perfectly cooked.  Would make a wonderful holiday recipe that allows the chef some time to enjoy the holiday too!!  Aunt Tilly

I made this for our anniversary.  I couldn't find a rack of lamb so went with a lamb chop.  When I followed the instructions, I lost all the breading in the pan.  With the second batch, I skipped the searing part, coated the chop first and went straight into the pan.  I left it covered for about 10 minutes on medium heat before flipping and cooking an additional 5 minutes.  The coating stayed on and was quite tasty.  For the bread-less chops, they also had a very nice flavor (and I don't care much for lamb but I'll prepare it again using this recipe).

This was hands down the best thing I have ever made.  I used whole wheat bread crumbs because that is all I had and I'm glad I did because the topping came out very crispy and dark.  I cooked it very rare and everyone agreed that it was the best lamb they have ever had.  Thanks so much for this recipe.

This turned out terrific. My first time ever cooking or eating lamb. I wanted to try something new and different for Easter this year and this was it.  The entire family raved on how good it turned out. I followed the advise of others and added minced garlic to the pan along with a few dashes of Worcestershire sauce. Yummy, yummy it tasted good and it's now in my tummy. However, either my oven tempeture is not set correctly or the time recommended is off for the size of Rack Of Lamb (2.38lbs) that I purchased. The lamb was room tempeture prior to cooking. Even so, when it was all said and done it took approx. 1hr to cook the lamb to medium well. Other than having to warm up my entire Easter meal over again twice. Everything tuned out delishiously. The Rack of Lamb was worth the wait. I'm well please. Thank you for posting. This is deffinetly a keeper and possibly the beginning of an Easter dinner tradition.

I had never cooked lamb before but it was my husbands bday and he loves lamb.  This turned out beautifully!  I added a little more garlic (we love it) but other than that I didnt change anything.  The timing works out if you dont pull the lamb straight out of the fridge.  Let it sit out on your counter while you are prepping everything else.  Great recipe- will def. be making it again!

This was absolutely fantastic! My first time cooking lamb so I was a little scared. I prepared an overnight of red wine, balsamic vinegar, fresh garlich, fresh rosemary and salt and pepper. Then followed the recipe exactly omitting only adding more salt and pepper. So tender and tasty! The whole family loved it!

absolutely great recipe - so tasty and sooo easy!
I didn't use not even halft the amount of salt stated (in fact I pretty much swapped the salt and pepper quantities around) also, I used slightly less rosemary so it wasn't so overpowering. YUM.

If I could give this a 1,000 stars i would! This was great! I did not have to change anything on here which is a first. It came out so good. We talked about it all night how good dinner was and how much we wished we had left overs for tomorrow. Thanks so much! This is a keeper!

This is the best combination of flavors for lamb.  I used fresh, artisan garlic bread for the bread crumbs.  While the oven was preheating I put the bead crumbs in to dry them out a bit and voila!  Fantastic recipe!

Wow! This was amazing! We also had an 8 rib rack which took a little more time in the oven, but it was sooo good! We didn't have any dijon mustard so we used balsamic vinegar to coat the lamb before we crusted it and it turned out amazing!! We ate every bite;)

I followed the recipe as stated since that's what I normally do to see how I like it as is.  Then the next time, I make my own changes to personalize the recipe.  We did not like this recipe at all.  Too salty, did not like the breading nor the flavor of the dijon mustard. I will not use this recipe again and will continue searching for a rack of lamb recipe that we'll really enjoy. Sorry!

This was GREAT! My children who aren't too crazy about lamb loved it!! I followed the directions to the T (except the cooking time for medium rare was more like 20 minutes), and the only problem I had was the outside didn't get crispy like I expected, however it didn't matter because it was still GOOD!! My husband wants me to make it again this week!

I made this last night for boyfriend and roommate and they both absolutely loved it!! It's very simple to make, I think you'll yeild the best result using a cast iron skillet. I also baked ratatouille as a side dish, which paired well with the lamb. Highly recommended!

I followed all the directions for this except the cooking part.  I did the rub and the searing etc.  Instead of roasting this I grilled it.  I pre-heated my grill on high. Added the Lamb right on the grate to get the grill marks.  Turned my grill down to low. Cooked each side for 7 minutes. I left the grill on and I brought the rack in the house, covered it and let it sit for exactly 5 minutes.  I sliced it up and set each rack back on the grill for @ 30 seconds each side.  (no more)  Served with a side of mashed potatoes and grilled asparagus.  This was awesome.  The Lamb was rare just a hint medium.  Perfectly juicy but didn't run all over the plate.  i would make this again and again.

I marinated for a few hours before hand then followed the directions for the searing, mustard, and bread crumbs. DH went crazy for it and he's from France. I did have to cook it eight minutes longer than called for and he likes his meat pink.

It's a keeper.  Did it in the oven.  It was outstanding.  Can't wait to try in on the grill.  Used Panko instead of fresh bread crums.

As others mentioned it took a lot longer to not get RARE results and that's with a thermometer.... Also I think too many bread crumbs covered up the lambs true taste.  I had high hopes but was disappointed.

Wow! Fantastically easy and YES definitely like eating at a fine restaurant. I used Italian bread crumbs instead of plan bread crumbs. I also did not have fresh rosemary on hand so I crushed dried rosemary with a mortor and pestal.   This will definitely become a regular in my kitchen!

Fantastic! I, also accompanied it with the "Greek Style Potatoes" and asparagus. I didn't change a thing in either recipes. I don't understand people who rate a recipe as great and have made major changes in the ingredients. Thank you for a wonderful dish!

This was so easy and amazingly delicious.  I wish I had made more.  My whole family devoured it, even my 2 year old who doesn't like to eat meat.  Only change I made was I had to cook it about 20 minutes longer to get the meat medium which is how I prefer my red meat.  Definately will make again.

Wonderful and easy!  I made this as a special birthday treat for my husband.  I was a little intimidated to try "rack of lamb" but was delighted with the results.  I would cut the salt used in the breading in half.  I served it with roasted potatoes.  My husband said, "This is the best meal you've ever made me!"

Delicious! I bought a CostCo rack for $12.99 (1.3 lbs) and, in my house at 8,600 ft above sea level, it took 23 minutes to reach "medium" well.  FYI for you fellow Coloradoans.

Made this for Easter dinner and it was fantastic - followed recipe exactly.  I seared it in my cast iron skillet and put that in the oven.  It did take longer to cook in oven - maybe 20 minutes and it was pretty rare.

This is wonderful!  I have never prepared or even eaten lamb before, but wanted to give it a try for a family seder meal.  The mustard and breading are a perfect compliment to the flavor of the lamb.  I used a digital temperature probe and cooked the lamb until it reached 140.  It was perfect.  We will definitely be preparing this again.  I may also try this breading for other types of meat, as well.

I made this two different times in the course of a couple weeks. One time with the Dijon Mustard, the second time with out.  This is delicious. Personally I prefer it without the mustard but that's just a matter of taste. After 12 minutes the temp was about 122*. I kept it in an extra 5 minutes. I recommend doing this in the cast iron skillet as recommended.  Also, I'm a firm believer that salt dries out meat so I omitted it. When we ate it it didn't even need any salt as the flavor was perfect. A winner for sure - Bravo!

This turned out very good.  The rosemary and garlic really goes well with lamb.  I cooked mine an extra 10 mins or so for well-done.  I cooked one rack per person- so I adjusted the recipe accordingly.

Taste was great, and as mentioned by many people the Costco rack of lamb works very well for this.
But, after allowing my meat to sit out after refrigeration (for one hour) and following the directions exactly, I still needed to cook the meat a few minutes longer to get it to medium rare.
Maybe my chops were larger, or I didn't sear it long enough, but I would recommend a longer cooking time.

I am rating this recipe compared to all other meats I have ever eaten.  I have only had lamb once before this.  Compared to that lamb and every other meat I have ever had this was probably the most savory cut I've ever tasted.  I messed up and used dried rosemary... do not do this, or if you must, dust the rosemary in a coffee grinder or with a mortar and pestle.  The cooking time does not allow for whole dry rosemary to soften.  Speaking of the cooking time.  I had to add about 10-15 more minutes (came out medium well).  I also threw a little more dijon into the mix (I love dijon on meats).  I am definately going to make this again, probably this month.

Wow!!!
OK so listen up!! I have NEVER cooked Lamb before....ever! I don't even like it....but my partner does and he eats it regularly. I live in Calgary Canada and I bought my Lamb from Costco. I listened to a TON of reviews on here and thought I should at least share what I did!
I followed the "not as much salt" issue but followed everything else! I did cook/bake it for a total of 18 minutes and acording to the lamb lovers, it was the BEST they have ever had!

It's 'bout time I open up my own little shack hey?? Thanks to whom ever shared this recipe!

I made this last night for our 12th anniversary dinner and it was a knockout!  I did follow some of the reviewers advice and cut the salt in half. And like some other reviews said I had to increase the cooking time by 15 minutes.  I wanted medium rare and it took about 30-35 minutes total at 450 degrees.  I will DEFINITELY be making this again!

We wanted a really special dish for Easter dinner, and this was perfect. We used a leg of lamb instead of a rack and followed the baking suggestion on the package: 15 minutes at 450 degrees, then reduce the heat to 350 and bake until a meat thermometer indicates the desired degree of doneness, as indicated in the recipe. Everyone raved at the appearance, the flavor, and the tenderness of the lamb.

I didn't really like this... It might just be that I have never had lamb before and don't like the taste of lamb... but this wasn't very good... no one went back for seconds (in my family, that is VERY rare =))  It took a lot longer to cook than 18 minutes.  I had it in for 25 and it was still bleeding!

Excellent Roasted Rack of Lamb. My only flaw was not leaving it out long enough before cooking so it cooked a little slower than 12 minutes. Definitely will it make again in the near future.

we have never tried lamb before, but always wanted to make it. I'll tell you for our first time we could not have picked a better recipe. It was truly amazing. 5 star all the way.

I wanted something nice to make for Valentine's day, so I tried this recipe out... I'm not even a big fan of lamb... but my fiancee and I both loved this! There weren't any leftovers... it was a great recipe to follow, the only thing was that after being in the oven for 15 minutes, the lamb was VERY rare... so it took more like 20 minutes, but I served it with home made mashed potatoes and asparagus.

Like others, I cut the salt but added another twist. Making fresh breadcrumbs is a pain, and the store-bought crumbs are tasteless. Since breadcrumbs add no nutritional value, I substituted for cornmeal, and it was a real hit, and healthy too. Make sure to use fine or medium cornmeal, not too coarse or it will be too crunchy.

This is delicous and so easy--I felt like a master chef after preparing this meal.  I did have to add on 5 minutes for medium-rare for a 1lb rack.  
This will become a more common dish now that I know how to prepare it with such a simple recipe.  Thanks!

This was great but needed longer cooking time than specified - mine needed about 20 minutes for medium rare, and my oven is pretty hot.  I guess it depends on the weight of the meat.  Also I forgot the dijon mustard in the rush of preparing the lamb in the middle of the dinner party, would have been even better with that.

This was absolutley fantastic.  I broke from tradition and made this for Thanksgiving dinner.  I cooked three racks for 5 people and I had 1/2 a rack left over.  I only did one thing different, I made my own bread crumbs because store bought are too fine.  I served them with twice baked potatoes from Taste of Home and Garlic Buttered Green Beans from Allrecipes.  Yum, Yum

Very good recipe.  I used kraft shake n bake as my breading since it was what i had.  Turned out excellent.  I did bake it about 20 min longer only because my preference is more well done.  Thanks for the recipe.

This recipe was great! The only thing I changes was reducing the salt by half, but it still tasted a bit salty for me. Next time I will only use 1/4 of the salt.

Awesome!  I omitted the rosemary because were not big fans of the herb and it still tasted good.  I will also half the salt next time as the other reviewers suggested.  The breading was a little too salty for my taste.

I made this the other night for dinner and was blown away by how great it was.  At first, I was a little hesitant to try and tackle the rack of lamb, but this recipe made it a snap.  It was so flavorful and juicy.  My husband, who is a rack of lamb fanatic, said it was better than any he's had at any restaurant.  Superb!

I tried this for easter and it was great. My cooking time was longer because I had 17 ribs. I used a crown of ribs. Please use the exact recipe. I used rosemary in a bottle and that's a no no for this recipe. I agree with everyone to use less salt, you don't need it. The smell around the house was wonderful. I will use this recipe for a long time through generations to come.

EXCELLENT, EXCELLENT, EXCELLENT!!!  Made this, along with a leg of lamb, for Easter dinner.  I felt like Emeril had made dinner for us.  This was tasty, tender, and EASY to make.  I used packaged bread crumbs, so that helped simplify an already easy recipe.  I omitted the rosemary since we don't like that herb.  The dijon mustard added a rich flavor that makes my mouth water thinking about it.  I did need to cook it longer to get it to our desired doneness (maybe I should have seared it longer, or on a burner w/more BTU's to avoid that).  HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!

I made this for supper tonight and it was a HUGE hit!!  I only needed to cook it for about 13 minutes because I used a cast iron pan and it continued cooking to about 135 to 140 degrees.  It was perfectly done!  Only thing I would have done differently would be to halve the bread crumb mixture.  I had enough for a secong rack, so I'm saving it to make another night.  Also, I took advice from other reviews and omitted the salt from the crumb mixture since I was using italian bread crumbs that already have salt in them.  But I liberally used the salt and pepper on the rack before searing.  It was perfectly salted that way.  Even my picky husband loved it! :-)

This is the best lamb I've ever eaten.  It's easy to prepare and restaurant quality.  If you add thick slices of garlic bread in the pan before putting in the oven, they can absorb some of the flavor from the lamb

WOW!!! Wanted to try this recipe with a rack of lamb but living in a small town their almost impossible to get. So I tried this recipe on a pork tenderloin.  The bread crumb mixture was soooo gooood that they were scraping the bottom of the pan for more. The only change I had to make was use ground rosemary (used a grinder because u can't buy them ground) instead of fresh because there was none available at the store.

This recipe worked very well; however, the lamb was very salty.  I highly recommend using only one teaspoon of salt and only one teaspoon of pepper.

This was great - I tweaked it a little as my husband doesn't like mustard, so I simply rubbed the racks with a little more oil before coating, and added lemon zest to the crumbs for that hint of piquance the mustard would usually give.  YUMM!!!!

This is so easy and so yummy! I didn't use any bread crumbs and it's still very good. As far as side dishes, I tried asparages, mashed potatoes and doesn't taste very good with it. So I tried tomatoes, cut in half and shake some garlic & Herb spices on top and put it in the over at the same time with the lamb. It's a perfect combination!! My whole family and friends love it and they requested this every week for 6 weeks straight already!!

Super easy, and can be scaled up to as many as you wish to serve.  I made this with 6 racks of lamb for a sit down dinner of 24 people for Christmas.  Doesn't even need the mint jelly.  It's great paired with baked parmesan fries!

I made this recipe tonight for New Year's Eve. It was my first time making rack of lamb, and it turned out great. I followed the recipe exactly; I have found homemade breadcrumbs to be far superior to store-bought. The crust is so tasty.
I will definitely make this again!

My husband said this was delicious.  It didn't cook in the amount of time specified, so I just stuck it in the micro for 1 min on high and it was done.

This was my first time cooking lamb and it turned out wonderfully - I followed the recipe to the letter. Maybe a bit less salt next time, as some other reviewers have pointed out, but if you like your meat extra-savoury, don't change a thing!  I made this for my boyfriend on his birthday and he was very happy!  Also, as other have pointed out, I did need to cook the meat for a bit longer, about 30 minutes for a Medium.  Use fresh meat, not previously-frozen, and you'll be sure to get a beautifully tender result.

This was so good! Very simple and yet it looks fancy and special and tastes like an  old family recipe you learned from your grandmother. I used store bought, dried breadcrumbs instead of fresh ones and didn't have any trouble. I thought the salt content was just perfect, but as many of the other viewers commented, I did need to cook it a lot longer than the 15 minutes the recipe suggests. I had it in the oven for more like 30-40 minutes. I also reccomend against covering it when you take it out of the oven as this will make the crust a little bit soggy. Thanks for this fabulous addition to my recipe book.

It was a HIT with my husband!!!! I impressed his socks off! 
I checked out the recipe to get a 'feel' for how to cook a rack of lamb. I didn't have all of the ingredients, so I just used:
1 tbsp   olive oil
2 tbsp   yellow mustard
1 tbsp   minced garlic
1 tsp      herbs de provance (however you spell it)
no breadcrumbs
no rosemary
in the oven at 450 for 10 min, but when I was making mine, a windstorm knocked the power out after it had been in the oven for 5 minutes. I left it in for 10 more minutes and took it out of the oven using a flashlight. It was PERFECT!

This turned out better then I thought I wouldn't change anything. I baked it for 45 mins because I like my meat cooked somewhat well done. It was slightly pink just the way I wanted and the taste OH MY WORD I would do my rack of lamb like this again. I had 8 ribs my hubby and ate two each very rich so wonderful here's a pic of the remaining ribs.

Love it and will definitely make again!  Having a digital remote thermometer took all of the guesswork out of cooking...I highly suggest you grab one from Home Depot or Lowes (about $30).  I took out at 130 and it was a perfect medium rare when served.  I also forgot to wrap the bones in tin foil, but thankfully did t see any charring.

Wow, Excellent recipe! The lamb came out quite tender and delicious. My recommendation is to READ the top couple of reviews--they have a lot of great tips there such as taking the lamb out of the fridge and allowing it to come to room temperature so the recommended cooking time is correct. I did find the bread crumb coating way too salty for my taste...and I really love salt. I think cutting the salt in the bread crumb coating in 1/2 (to 1/2 tsp) would be a good idea and then allow your guests to salt to taste. Thanks a bunch Jennine, I will be using this recipe the next time I prepare rack of lamb!

Pleases the in-laws! My family has loved this recipe since I first started making it. My in-laws finally tried it several months ago, and now they're huge fans.  My FIL requests this for every holiday now.  I make the recipe as is, but I typically have to cook it a little longer than suggested.  If I use meat thermometer, it turns out perfect every time.

Holy hell this was good. I had never made rack of lamb before, but this was so easy and delicious. The only thing I would do differently is use less salt, but a bunch of people already said that, so. Mum wants me to make it for the family next weekend, so we shall see what they think!

I would  never make this again! The meat was too tough & under cook, all I could  taste was mustard  in the breading, and when we cut the mea the breading fell off.

I also tried this recipe with a lovely little New Zealand petite rack of lamb from Costco.  Just enough for a dinner for two.  After researching "Frenched", I discovered to my delight it had already been Frenched and proceeded with the recipe.  I agree with other reviewers it was a bit salty (I used Grey Pupon to baste and that has some salt as well) so I will go with 1/2 teaspoon salt in the breading mixture next time but all in all, it was DIVINE!!  I roasted it on convection roast at 425 degrees until an internal thermometer read 125 degrees and let it sit for 5 minutes--perfect rare/medium rare tenderness.  A showstopper for a dinner party so will try it on others next time!  But I'll have to use two or three to serve more.  Merci Jenny!!!

I used herb panko for the crust instead of the breadcrumbs and it was delicious!  The Dijon and herb crust really took away from the typical 'gamey' flavor of lamb.  This was an easy to follow recipe and everyone liked it very much.  I would make it again!

Decided to make this for New Year's Eve dinner...it was truly SUPERB! I followed the recipe exactly; however, I roasted the lamb in my Le Creuset cast iron skillet and made a wine sauce (with leftover Cabernet) from the pan drippings, along with a little butter.  Everyone loved it!

This was my first attempt at making Lamb and I loved this. It was better then I've ever had it in a restaurant. I followed the advice of making sure the lamb rested at room temp for an before cooking. I followed the recipe exactly. At 18 mins it was a perfect medium. Looks like I'll be making lamb more often.

If the flavors of Rosemary and Extra Virgin Olive Oil float your boat, then this easy and elegant recipe is for YOU! Don't even think about using canned bread crumbs or dried Rosemary. Fresh is best. Results are very, very nice. Why dine out when you can cook like this at home? (Use a meat thermometer for perfect results. It took about 15 minutes for the meat to reach 140 degrees. Let it rest several minutes before slicing to get these results.)

Every raved about the lamb at Christmas dinner.  This was my first time cooking lamb.  The recipe was simple and delicious.  I followed it exactly with no changes, I didn't even read the comments prior to starting like I usually do.  I did use a thermometer and cooked it to 155 degrees, I didn't set the time to it.  Would totally cook this again!

I have made this recipe for special occasions including our 10th year wedding anniversary and during Christmas day. Both times, it came out perfectly done, medium-rare for 30 minutes as opposed to just 15 mins. Together with a homemade canned mint jelly, my husband and I enjoyed this one of a kind-gourmet style dining in our home. Thank you so much for sharing this recipe.

I tried this last weekend. It is the best lamb rack I've ever had. I think it is even better than what I had in some up-scale restaurant. Love it and will definitely make it again! Thanks for sharing such amazing recipe!

This was delicious. I followed the recipe exactly as written. the lamb was very moist. We chose to cook for 18mins because we didn't want it bloody or pink. Delicious!!

I don't have a working meat thermometer right now, but I do have a brand-new, accurate oven so I thought that cooking the meat for 16 minutes would give me a medium doneness.  Unfortunately, it was very rare even after letting it sit for 10 minutes.  Edible, but I would have preferred it to be more thoroughly cooked.  I also thought it was too garlic-y, but that may be due to the fact that I used pre-chopped garlic.  The dijon was nice - I would have preferred less breading, less garlic and more dijon!

This is one of the best things I've ever cooked. I have made this twice already and LOVED IT. It tastes likes something out of a fancy restaurant, yet I'm only 11 years old and could make this easily. I will me making this again and again and again, because a recipe this good can't get old!!!

Wow! 14 minutes was a nice medium rare for me, make sure you leave the lamb out of the fridge for about an hour before you cook it. Be generous with the dijon and bread crumbs, soooo tasty!

Excellent. Followed the recipe nearly exactly, with just a bit less salt.  I had a 1.25lb rack and 14 minutes in the oven produced a perfect medium rare. When I took it out of the oven the thermometer read 115F. I let it sit for 5 mins and it was excellent.

The instructions for the bread crumb rub produced way more than I needed. Next time I will only use half of the rub recipe for a single rack.

Of course I also seared and roasted in a red hot cast iron pan which I highly recommend for fast cooking any good meats.

I love this recipe! The combination of fresh rosemary and garlic give a special flavour for the recipe. Beside that, it is very easy to cook and you can make a good impression with this sophisticated dish.

First time I bought the Rack of Lamb in a small store close to my place and they chopped it into pieces, not good, I did not like. After that I bought from Costco, and it was excellent! Less fat and I cooked the whole piece as the recipe says.

I have tasted a lot of restaurant quality rack of lamb and this by day is the best I have ever tasted, I did not have rosemary and used italian seasoning instead and cut back a bit on the salt . I give this 10 stars, a must try .

My husband and my 3 year old son loves this. The only problem I had was keeping the breading on when cutting it. I do not know if I did something wrong but I will definitely be making this again.

Amazing - I always change to taste - and I don't measure unless I'm baking - here are my alterations to this amazing base recipe:  minced and mixed the rosemary and thyme, with one chopped garlic glove - put in a smaller dish and added enough olive oil to coat/marinate - sea salt and cracked pepper to taste.  Let sit - did a two to one mixture of Dijon mustard and apricot preserves for the basting; used panko crumbs, mixed in with herb/oil mixture right before coating.. AMAZING!  I also added shallots to the cast iron skillet prior to searing.  I wish I could upload a pic!  It was unbelievably good!

Making this recipe for the 4th time tonight!  Love how the Dijon compliments the meat.  My only tweak is that because I am celiac, I use gluten-free breadcrumbs or GF cornflake crumbs.  Using the cornflake crumbs gives it a wonderful flavor...the crust can't be beat!  How can you go wrong with garlic, breadcrumbs and rosemary?  YUM!

I don't normally cook with herbs like Rosemary, but I enjoyed the taste. It's a good recipe; was easy to make; however, I found it a tad salty; hence, I'd adjust the recipe simply by not preseasoning the lamb... all else was good.

Made this yesterday for my mom for mothers day along with the crab stuffed lobster tails.  Awesome, Awesome, Awesome.   Substituted panko bread crumbs (all I had), substituted regular mustard (all I had).  Everything else followed to the tee.  My family loved it.  I got rave reviews.  Once again.... allrecipes to the rescue!!  Thanks Jennine1980!!  Will be making this again.

This was good.  I enjoyed the crunch of the outside (I used panko, as other reviewers suggested), but felt it was too mustardy.  Of course, I put on a lot of mustard so it's hard to know if that was my own fault.  I wish the recipe spelled out to be a little frugal with the mustard, though.

Agree with other reviews - easy and excellent - even my 6 year old ate some.  Used Itialian seasoned bread crumbs, jar garlic, and dried rosemary and no salt.  We like our well done so did 23:00 plus searing.

Totally agree with other reviewers that the dish was a little too salty.  Personally I will omit the salt from the bread crumb mixture next time and only lightly season the lamb.  Otherwise, it was super easy and made me look like a gourmet chef! Delicious...

This was my first time making rack of lamb and I am so glad I used this recipe. It was great. I am not a big fan of rosemary so I used a little less rosemarry and added some tarragon. Other than that, I followed the recipe to a tasty, juicy, wonderful tasting Christmas dinner!

Excellent recipe.  I use Panko bread crumbs; much better than Italian in my opinion.  I agree with other reviewers; use less salt. I also like to double the rosemary; you can never use enough rosemary.  Now for the sauce:  I used the recipe for the lamb feta burgers with some tweaks.  Instead of all sour cream, go half and half with greek yogurt.  Also, double the mint and prepare it the day before.

This was my first time making rack of lamb, but the recipe and the comment recommending how to order it at the butcher (frenched & with the chine bone removed) made it easy!  I followed another reviewers suggestion and cooked it at a lower temp for 45 minutes, then increased to 400 for 15, but next time I'll follow the recipe.  I like my meat medium rare and the slow cook method had it well done and not as juicy as I expected.  I will be trying this again soon!

This recipe was really good as it stands and the Rack of Lamb was easy for anyone to cook.  Mine was rare at about 13 minutes in the oven at 450 as prescribed at 135 degrees.  I ended up making a currant sauce from another recipe on Allrecipes and they went together great.  I think for next time I would use less breadcrumbs, maybe just a little bit like less than 1/4 cup, the crust was tasty but I would go with less as it was too breadcrumy, and I would also consider searing AFTER putting on the breadcrumb mixture as opposed to before to cook the breadcrumbs a bit.  I really liked the breadcrumb / rosemary mixture and would consider using it for home fries or breakfast potatoes as well.

What a delicious recipe!  Definitely will be making this one again.    Thanks!
Made this again tonight and it was even better, I think!  I got my lamb at Sam's Club (on sale for $17.00) so there were 2 racks.  I doubled the recipe to accommodate the 2 racks and made the recipe exactly as written.  I can say that the other reviews on the salt were correct.  Don't eliminate it, but do cut it back a bit because mine was a little on the salty side.  I served it with some mashed potatoes and the green bean almandine recipe from this site (which is amazing, btw) and the meal was better than anything you could get in a nice restaurant.  All in all, I think my ENTIRE meal was $20.00 and there was enough to feed at least 4 people.  Try getting THAT at a cheap restaurant, much less one of the nicer ones!

This was a GREAT recipe! Much better than the Lamb Stew we tried before from allrecipes.com.  We didn't have dijon mustard so we used regular mustard and the lamb came out great.  I also followed everyone else's review and used less salt.  We cooked the lamb for 12 minutes in the oven.  Would definitely be using this recipe again! 

Also, I would like to add that there was about half the of the bread crumb mix left over.  Not a big deal, since we'll probably use it for something else.

Turned out beautifully! Bought a lovely rack from Toronto's St Lawrence Market (i'm sure starting with good quality helps), my first attempt at lamb in any form.
I used grainy dijon and it was excellent.
For the pan-searing part, I'll be using canola oil next time, in place of olive oil, which started smoking almost the moment the lamb when in the pan.

Bravo! You made me confident about lamb! Next up, leg...

This was my first time serving lamb at a formal table (filled with Italians who are famous for their culinary discretion).  It was a major hit and the overall adjective was 'exquisite'; the highest compliment an Italian knows how to give for their food.  This recipe is a winner!

The only change I made was on the cooking temperature and times at the suggestion of my butcher: 390F, 200C for 55 minutes on a rack for 8 people.  A longer cooking time gave me the opportunity to enjoy cocktails as well as the first soup course with my guests and the lamb was ready to serve at just the right time.

I served it with a mint sauce.

Loved this easy recipe for lamb.  I needed to cook quite a bit longer for med/rare.  Didn't have breadcrumbs, but didn't miss them either.  Used thyme instead of rosemary 'cause it was what I had.

Absolutely delicious! However I agree with everyone, the salt was too much, probably because the bread was already rather salty. I will omit it all together next time. Also took me a little longer, around 20 mins for delicious tender juicy medium rare lamb. An internal temp of 130F.

This recipe was absolutely DELICIOUS.  The only variation is that I had to cook the rack of lamb for way longer than indicated - closer to 40 minutes.  Needs no other changes.  FABULOUS!

This was my first time cooking lamb and hosting Easter dinner.  Followed directions exactly (scaled up) and it came out perfect.  Everyone loved it.  The butcher recommended 4 ribs per guy and 2 ribs per gal.  Thank you!

This was my first attempt at rack of lamb and it came out great! I used the Costco rack which I think had 7 ribs. The cooking time was definitely longer than the recipe states. But as long as you have a thermometer to check the temp it's not a big deal.

In general I am nervous about  cooking lamb, I know it's hit or miss when cooking. This recipe was a hit with my family. The three of us loved it. To compliment I bought some mint jelly. FANTASTIC!! Thank you for the recipe.

Great recipe.  The rosemary flavor is amazing. The best lamb you can get is the one imported from New Zealand.

This was awesome! I've always enjoyed rack of lamb at restaurants and just had the itch to try making it myself for the first time so I bought lamb at the grocery store one night. I had no idea what to do with it but found this recipe and gave it a whirl. It was incredibly easy to make! The only thing that I changed what I used 1 tablespoon dried rosemary because I didn't have fresh on hand. My husband loved it too!

I've made this several times.   This is the best lamb ever!  I sear it outside on the grill burner so it doesn't smoke up the house.  When you put it in the oven, use a digital thermometer.  My perfect rare is when I pull it out at 125 degrees and let it rest until 135-140 degrees.  I folow the recipe exactly.  Wonderful.  I'm makeing it again for Easter Sunday!

I've made this dish twice now and it was a hit both times!  It was very easy and turned out tender and flavorful.  I omitted the dijon mustard only because some of my family members are not fans.  My 7-year old daughter ate 4 of the chops on her own, so I think next time I'll make 2 racks and try the dijon on one of them.  Delicious!

Great recipe! Have not gotten tired of making this yet. I use garlic pepper (grinder) and panko. I also cut rack into into sections of 2 and lean it against the side of the baking dish. Bake for 25 minutes. Cut into individual pieces.  May need to place the unbreaded side down on the hot baking pan (outside the oven) for a minute so the residual heat can finish cooking the chop.

Incredibly delicious! I read the reviews and anticipated it taking longer than stated, but after my third test with the meat thermometer I simply cut them apart and finished them up in a skillet.

My family loved this but instead of putting it in the over, I cooked it on the pan, just like how I would cook a steak except add the salt&pepper ahead of time so it gives the meat times to absorb it. Definitely will be making this again.

WOW this was GREAT! Im a HORRIBLE cook - I mess up everything, but this was very easy and came out wonderful.  ALTHOUGH, the rack I bought at Costco was WAY too fatty for my taste - very little meat. I doubled the garlic, and used dried rosemary instead of fresh.  Also, the cooking time is actually longer than what the recipe says.  The crust was so flavorful. I will use this recipe on costco's lamb chops next week.  This recipe is a keeper!

It turns out I didn't have any bread crumbs so I substituted Panko for the bread crumbs. I crushed the Panko bread crumbs to make the texture more fine like regular bread crumbs. I didn't have any rosemary so i substituted the rosemary for 1/2 tsp. of dried Thyme. I was worried it wouldn't taste good with all the changes but everyone loved it and said it was restaurant quality! It did take a little longer than the recipe says (I don't like my meat rare). I think it took a little over 10 minutes than the recipe asked for.

We love lamb but have never tried it at home.  This is DELICIOUS!!!  The recipe is quick and easy and it all cooks in 1 pan!  The crust is great and ours was cooked to perfection!  Great Recipe!!!!  I did add more garlic but other than that exactly to the recipe.

This recipe was easy with no hassles and tasted like it came from a fancy restaurant. I purchased the rack at Costco and it was plenty for two. I let my roast come to room temp for about an hour; roasted it for 12 min and temp was 112 degrees so back in it went for 5-6 more min and it came out a perfect 130 degrees for med rare. This one's a keeper and I'll try in on pork and chicken!

My husband and I love lamb but had never had a rack of lamb.  I tried this for Valentine's day and my husband could not stop talking about how great it was.  If you don't like this you either did something wrong or don't like lamb.  For a romantic dinner I started with "Rich and Simple French Onion Soup" and paired the lamb with "Roasted Potatoes with Greens" also from this site.  The dinner was so good that we warmed up leftovers for breakfast the next morning.  Yum!!! Note: If you take it out when the internal temp is 150F and tent with foil for 5 minutes, it will be done to a perfect medium.

I was very impressed with how good this is and how easy it was to make. I made it for an early Valentine's dinner and it was very good. I had to use panko crumbs instead of fresh bread crumbs because it was what I had, but it tasted wonderful and the crumbs were very crispy.

I thought the flavors were good but there were a few problems I see most people having: 1) Searing for even that short amount of time left my pan (a beautiful all-clad) blackened and my home filled with smoke.  I was THIS close to setting off the smoke detector!  And it didn't seem to get charred enough to help the final product. 2) I don't see how the crumbs could get crispy.  Mine were just soggy.  Though still tasty.  Maybe dried bread crumbs would be better?  My husband wants me to make it again but next time I will not sear it and I will omit the bread crumbs.

This was great!   I made it for Christmas dinner.   The only thing that was disappointing was when there was no more to eat.  Very simple to make, too, which is a huge bonus for me.   I forgot the rosemary, and my boyfriend wants me to try it with mint next time.  I hate to experiment with lamb - it's not the cheapest meat, but what the hey....I'm going for it.

Simply amazing. I am not a huge fan of lamb, but wanted to make something special for my boyfriend. He loved it and so did I. Very easy and I followed the recipe and some suggestions from others.

I have not had rack of lamb for 10 years almost and this was just like I remember it to be. Juicy, super tender and outstanding flavor. I did not sear the meat just put into a preheated oven and baked for 30 minutes, came out perfect!

I have never tried making lamb before.  Although, my uncle is Greek, so I knew how it was "suppose" to taste!  This recipe was great, and it turned out perfectly.  Really helps to have a meat thermometer though!  Very tasty!!

This was a big hit!  I didn't have bread crumbs so I crumbled up Ritz crackers instead.  My family loved it.  12 minutes was very rare.  We like rare meat but I had to give it a bit longer. I picked up the meat at Costco for a great price.

This is the best lamb recipe I have found.  My entire family (including my 2 year old) loved the lamb.  I have also used the same recipe for different cuts of lamb.  Delicious!

I also used a Costco 8 rib rack and seasoned it with the basics;rosemary thyme,garlic and served it with homemade mint sauce,new nugget potatoes and a beautiful organic salad.I also added 2 cans of Bavaria beer (Holland by design) which made the cooking time seem to be less.The dinner was fit for me and that`s what counted.5 stars and a keeper.

We had this for dinner tonight and it was beyond expectations!  Absolutely delicious!  So tender and juicy and flavourful.  What a treat.  I found 120 degrees internal temperature was perfect for rare.  And I used Panko crumbs.
This is definitely a keeper!

OMG!!! It's been over four weeks since I gave this recipe a shot and my BF is still raving about it. We live in New York City and dine out alot. According to my guy this was better than in some of the better French places. Thank you so much for the recipe!!! I did make a few tweaks. I cut the rack into individual bones. Used a bit more mastard and not as much bread crumps as the recipe requires.

My husband loooved this recipe.  He was raving while eating it AND the next day.  He said he would pay lots of money to eat this meal at a restaurant :D.  I used shoulder lamb chops instead of rack of lamb and I cut down a little bit on the salt as others suggested.  Thank you for this wonderful recipe.

We made this last week and we will be making it again!! I cooked it for the time asked but when I cut it is was a little raw for me, I just put it an a frying pan and browned it on each side for a min and whola! PERFECT.  To my hudband, all my cooking is "OK", yet this was GREAT. Don't think I have ever head that from him before!!

The recipe was good. As many other reviewers had suggested, I only used a quarter of the salt in the recipe and also agreed with another reviewer that 1/2 cup of bread crumbs is a little much. I also felt that the garlic did not really add any flavor. I would either add more garlic or leave it out (it ended up burnt when taken out of the oven). I made this rack of lamb medium and cooked it in the oven at 450* for 5 mins and then turned the heat down to 300* and baked it until the desired temperature (about 9 more mins.) so that the outside would not be overcooked by the time the inside is at the desired temp. that I wanted (which came out to 132*).

Unending rave reviews, talked about days later - HE says "definately, definately a keeper - THE best rack of lamb ever had!" and HE is quite difficult to please. A note: I ended up having to "hold" this rack about 30 minutes between searing and baking. Afterward, baked for 15 minutes at recommended temp and still rare. Ended up cutting between the bones and broiling at 425 about another 5 minutes. Superb main course.

I made this for my husband's birthday & he loved it.  Rarely raves about my recipes. I thought I should cut back on the salt, but he didn't.  Personally, I would cut back 1/2 of salt.  I will definited prepare this again for special occasions.  The joke in my house is that if you say you like a dish, you'll never see it again.  Hey, there's a lot of recipes out there to try!!  Seriously, I will definitely make this one again.

Wow!  My husband took one bite and said, "you are now a world class cook." I used a 2 lb rack from Costco.  Cut the salt to 1/2 tsp sea salt, and used 1/2 tsp ground pepper, and 1/2 tsp cracked peppercorn mix that has salt in it.  15 min cooking time and it was a perfect medium rare.  I served it with a caesar salad and Roasted Garlic Mashed Potatoes submitted by Kathleen Burton (see my review dated 3/3/07).  I will definitely make this for company.  Very rich and very easy.  Makes a nice presentation.

This was delicious!!!  We thoroughly enjoyed this recipe.  My husband who is Egyptian LOVED it!  I would serve this to his middle eastern family and be proud :)  The only thing I changed was I used powdered garlic with the breadcrumb mix, but it was wonderful!  I highly recommend

This is the easiest and best Rack of Lamb I ever prepared. I serve it as my signature dish for company. It is so simple to prepare and quick and yet it tastes like it took hours to prepare. The recipe is perfect just the way it is.

Amazing recipe! Since trying this, I won't cook rack of lamb any other way.  Especially good if you are new to lamb. I only lightly brush the mustard on which winds up about 1/2 of the mustard at most and I use a less crumb mixture, but I strongly urge lamb fans to try!

Wonderful recipe! I did this for our Christmas dinner and hubby's words was raving "melts in your mouth". I intended to follow this recipe and keeping in mind with tips from other reviews. But were over excited and had put on the herb mustard all over before searing it in a pan. It all turned out well and hubby didn't stop complimenting it. Oh, I added some baby potatoes mixed with butter and rosemary on the side of the rack of lamb while in the oven as a side dish too.

Christmas Dinner smash hit!  Mom stopped by to see what was up and got a real treat.  All the kids ate it up as well.  Didn't really change anything except the usual eye-balling the amount of ingredients.  Cooked to 140, good medium rare.  We ate about 4 ribs/adult, 2 for the young kids.

This was so easy and very good.  I did decrease the salt by 1/2 as others suggested.  But overall it came out perfectly.  My husband loved it!  Thank you!  Second time I used italian seasoning along with Rosemary, doubled the garlic and used panko instead of bread crumbs.  Awesome

My husband and I love lamb chop.  He normally just grilled it.  I am glad I found this recipe. It taste exactly like what we normally have in our favourite restaurant. My husband will definitely be asking for it soon.

WOW, this was so easy and so tasty. The key is to make your own breadcrubs with fresh white bread, much better than the bought ones! Restaurant quality.

I thought this was going to be a disaster because of the strong garlic scent as it cooked. I couldn't have been more wrong. This was one of the best rack of lamb meals I ever had. I cooked 7 ribs and pulled it out of the oven after 15 minutes and let it cool another 10 before serving. My husband is still telling his friends about this meal.

This was so delicious!  As many of the other reviews stated, the lamb needed to cook for about 15 minutes longer.  Everything else was done by the recipe and it was such a huge hit.  I will definitely be making this again.

Wonderful! I didn't change a thing. Roasted rack at time  stated and it was a perfect rare inside with a slight crunch outside. I served this with a mint hollandaise sauce that was used for dipping "lollipops" in.

This was a wonderful recipe. The whole family loved it.I made it for my mother-in-law who was visiting,and doesn't like lamb,and it's all she could talk about. My husband also loved it, and makes sure I get that rack of lamb when I make a trip to Sam's Club. Oh, and my 4 year old also likes it. Wow! Will continue to use this recipe!

Highly recommended. I tried it with a Pork roast- it was EXCELLENT.  My finicky parents raved about it too! For once they were the ones asking ME for a recipe. The only change I would make is to substitute the minced garlic with powdered as the minced can be a bit overpowering.

This rack of lamb has become our Anniversary Tradition.  It is as good as any I've had in any fancy restaurant.  The only thing we do different is put the lamb on the bbq first for 2 minutes each side to sear it and keep all the juices in.  It's superb.

I found this recipe to be excellent except for the amount of salt. I used kosher salt which should have reduced the saltiness, but I could have used less. That aside, the technique is perfect. I roasted the lamb along with halved fingerling potatoes tossed with olive oil, rosemary, salt, and pepper, all in the same pan. It took about 20 minutes for rare lamb - remove and let rest. Turn the potatoes and return to the oven for 10 minutes.

1) I left too much fat and oil on it which created a problem for the panko and yet it was still good.  I would make sure to trim it well and when you're done searing it perhaps blot off the oil.

I was really surprised that pank didn't just burn but I guess it's just not in the oven long enough.

2) A nice add on is to inject some marinade into the lamb itself of a mixture of mustard, wine, salt, and flavored olive oils a few hours before cooking.

3) I used a meat thermometer that I could check without opening the oven.  I took it out at 125F and let it rest.  That resulted in medium or medium rare in the center.

This was one of the best recipes for lamb. I didn’t use a rack of lamb, instead I used lamb loin chops. I put the Dijon mustard and bread crumb seasoning on both sides of the loin chop. Delicious.

Great recipe!  I make it at least once a month and the family loves it.  My wife keeps inviting friends over to enjoy the recipe.  I've ordered lamb many times in restaurants and this is simply better.  I'm not sure if it's the bread crumbs, dijon mustard or a combination of everything, but it almost completely eliminates any game taste which is great, especially for first time lamb eaters.  Love it!

I subbed dried Herbs de Provence because I didn't have any Rosemary. My husband gave high praise and compared them to Lamb from his favorite restaurant.  I've made this 2x.  Its easy but I'm struggling to get these to Medium Rare on the first try.  12-18 min at 400 was too short in my oven, and it runs hot.  I took them out when instant read and oven probe got to 125 and rested them, but I will wait until at least 130 next time.

I definitely will make it again.  I used panko and extra rosemary ground in a spice grinder so it was very fine. Also used five cloves of garlic.  Very delicious and medium rare to rare.

Turned out very good. I had trouble separating them. They were delicious. Took a little longer than the recipe states, but it was my first time with rack of lamb. Will be making this again.

I had a 2 lb Australian rack from Costco.  I still seared all sides in my cast iron pan, let it sit, than brushed with dijon mustard and rolled in the (italian seasoned) bread crumb mix (I cut back on salting the rack).  In the oven at 400 degrees for 15 mins.  I checked the temp at 14 mins and it was 145 degrees.  I let it rest for 10 mins and cut.  It came out medium but perfect, juicy and tender!!  Next time I would still sear then roast for 12 mins for the perfect medium rare.  My 8 year old had 3 ribs!!  She loved it.

This was so good!  The only change was that I used regular bread crumbs and cooked to 140 internal temperature.  Will have to use on beef and chicken and see how it tastes.

This is now one of our family favorites! I used half panko and have Italian bread crumbs and it worked out great. Everyone like this coating so much, I may try slicing the rack of ribs first and then coating before cooking them next time. Thanks!

The only change I made was not braising the lamb first, and I made some cuts in the fat layer, down to the membrane - the tight layer between the fat layer and the meat 3/4 the length of the chop. Removed the rack(s) at 120 degrees, let them sit under foil for a bit- perfectly delicious medium rare rack of lamb Christmas dinner- everyone loved it.

I used lamb shoulder instead of rack of lamb because my grocery store was out of rack. I also added a little fresh lemon juice to the bread crumb mixture. the ingredients are very tasty and works so well with the lamb. This came out very good but I would definitely try to find rack of lamb the next time I make this mainly because my husband and I just prefer the rack of lamb cut.

When I first found this recipe I’d never cooked any kind of lamb never mind a rack of lamb.  It see seemed easy so I gave it a shot and I’m so glad I did. It was fabulous!!!  I’ve tried other recipes since then but I always come back to this one. Thank you so much for sharing!

I was looking for a Gordon Ramsay recipe for a rack of lamb and this one is identical to one of his. It came out PERFECT!!!! The only thing I altered was I did not use breadcrumbs,  I did add ground sage and I let it sit for about an hour with the spices on it before I seared it. SO GOOD

I will definitely make it again. I, unfortunately, did not have enough bread crumbs for the amount of meat that I used and was unable to french it. However, it was delicious anyway which just goes to show, if the recipe is good, it doesn't matter how badly you mess up some of the presentation aspects.

Made this recipe for the first time tonight.  My husband loved, loved, loved it. Made it in convection/toaster oven.  Didn't have to heat the big oven. Will definitely make this many times again.  Can't wait to make it for company--very impressive.

This is the time i cooked lamb so it could have been beginners error. However, this was a delicious recipe. However, we felt it was a wee bit too salty. Next time I will take it down a notch and won't  be rubbing the salt directly onto the lamb as the recipe called for. Other than that, i will do this again. I would recommend it to others

Will definitely make this again... .it was a hit.  I was pressed for time and had the lamb but didn't have the fresh ingredients so I used dried bread crumbs and dried spices..... 1 Tbsp garlic, 1 tsp, rosemary. 1 tsp thyme, extra olive oil to moisten the crumbs....... you'd be pleased if this were served to you in a 5 star restaurant....... Loved it!

OMG, THIS IS AMAZING!  I make it using the tiny loin chips from Costo this time instead of the rack of lamb, and the lamb was perfectly cooked and the baby potatoes that I roasted alongside finished cooking as the lamb rested.  This will be my go-to recipe from now on.

I made this recipe this Easter Sunday (4/22/2919).  I have had other, more complicated recipes for a rack of lamb, but this one, my husband found, and not only is it easy to prepare with all ingredients in your cupboard, but the flavors are amazing.  I didn't change a thing to this recipe.  You can actually taste everything individually and as one unit.  This pairs very well with a great Pinot Noir.  Thank you so much for sharing this recipe.

It took almost 30 minutes for my roast to reach 130-degrees in a cast iron skillet. A keeper of a recipe; easy and elegant... and delightfully tender, savory, and so good!!

Amazing! My boyfriend's boss gave him a rack of lamb from Costco and it was pretty large. I don't know the weight but I can post a photo with my hand for scale. His boss had already seasoned it with some kind of dried rosemary herb stuff. So I only followed the cooking part of this. But it sounds amazing with the mustard rub and I will definitely make this again. I seared my rack in a cast iron skillet for about 1-2 min on both sides. Then let rest for 3-4 min. Then cover bones with foil and place in 450F oven center rack for 13 minutes. That seems like a lot of time but it was perfect. The meat will still continue to cook after you remove it from the oven due to residual heat. I checked with a meat thermometer and my temp was ~120F when I took it out. Covered with foil and let rest about 4 minutes. Perfection! Served with feta couscous and Zinfandel. My boyfriend was raving!!

I too got an 8 rib rack from Costco which came frenched and let it come to room temperature for about an hour.  Being on the Keto diet, I replaced the bread crumbs with ground pork rinds and used dried rosemary instead of fresh.  I took the rack out of the oven after about 15 minutes at a temp of 145 but after cutting chops, they were much too rare for DW.  So I just put the skillet back on the stove top and finished the individual chops  in the pan for about a minute of two per side.  It turned out great and Ill probably do the same thing next time.  It was a huge hit.

Delish! Followed advice to take out of fridge at least one hour before cooking so that meat would not be too cold. Cook times were good.... about 15 minutes in my oven for medium rare.

This is my go to recipe for a rack of lamb.  I get mine from the butcher,  so usually go to 15 minutes to get medium rare.  It goes well with gluten free bread crumbs or almond meal for the coating.

I omitted the salt, plenty of flavor without.  I had no fresh rosemary so I used crushed.  I also had no Dijon mustard so I substituted honey mustard.  It was a big hit!  If rack of lamb wasn't so expensive I'd make it regularly.  It wasn't hard to make, just lots of steps.

Delicious! This is a definite repeater! I also bought my lamb (from Australia) at Costco, and as one reviewer suggested, brought it to room temperature before beginning the prep. It was nicely done after 18 minutes. I did cut back on the salt, but used the full amount of rosemary and garlic. Great Christmas dinner with my family!

Followed the recipe exactly and turned out great! I was worried that the mustard would be overpowering but as the reviews stated - you barely even taste it and it’s really more of a way to pack on the rub. Delish!

So good! I've made this several times and I don't change a thing. Today, I made 2 racks.  I left them in for 20 minutes and they were perfectly med/med rare. The racks were on the small side. There was a lot of bread crumb mixture left over because the racks were so small. I didn't have enough dijon mustard, so I had to mix in a little bit of standard mustard. Still came out delicious! Thanks for sharing!

This was my first time making Rack of Lamb and this recipe was foolproof! I even substituted fresh ingredients for the breadcrumb mixture for their dried counterparts since fresh herbs were sold out nearly everywhere around me due to the holidays. I rehydrated the breadcrumb mixture with a 1/4 cup of water as well. The lamb came out perfectly Medium Rare, at the midpoint of the baking time range (~15 mins) with 5 mins of resting. The meat was like butter and the bread crust was aromatic and garlicky and crunchy. Perfect contrast with the succulent lamb.

The only thing I would change is do something to the Dijon. I think maybe my family and I are just not a big fan of mustard but it was just a little too acidic for our tastes. That's what's holding me back from the 5 stars. Nonetheless, this recipe is a keeper!

Who knew rack of lamb was this easy?! Made this for my girlfriend and she absolutely loved it, so much so she asked to have it for her upcoming birthday meal. Only note... a tad longer in the oven to crisp the coating gives a very satisfying crunch when taking that first bite.

I have made this recipe twice and each time it was great. This time I use ground rosemary and granulated garlic. The response was they people liked this version better. I served with Yorkshire pudding which was also a hit.

Easy to prepare and tasted great.  I had to leave rack in for another 5 mins on top of the 18 recommended.  Meat was still medium rare and tender.

Wow! This was a big hit! Since I had a 2.6# 8-bone rack, I followed another reviewer’s suggestions and did not sear, but cooked it for 15 minutes before I put the coating on. I, too, used Italian herbed bread crumbs. Cooked another 40-45 minutes for a delicious, medium-rare outcome. Will make this again next time I buy lamb. Crust was perfect! (I did cut down on salt)

I used honey Dijon mustard because that’s all I had on hand and it was delicious. This was my first time making lamb, but it’s definitely not my last.

Tested the lamb to be 140 but it was still rare.  Cut and then grilled.

Turned out great - I followed the suggestion to cut the salt in half, and the salt level was just right.  My son ate more than 1/2 of the rack himself - a huge hit!

This was amazing!  My bf  (a CIA trained chef & restaurateur) enjoyed it so much he left nothing but bones on his plate. He said this dish was THE BEST rack of lamb he’s ever eaten and  officially “allowed” me to prepare all meals we have at home - a very big deal;  we loved it so much there wasn’t even time to take a picture of the finished lamb.  I  used ½ tsp of salt after reading other reviews, and this was enough for 2 racks of 8...everything else was the same.  The lamb was room temp when I began making it; an accurate meat thermometer is helpful. 

Thank you for this recipe...it’s a definite winner. I’m going to try the breading with beef, pork & chicken as well.

We used the 8 rib Rack of Ribs from Costco.
I used my mother's old Cast Iron Pan to sear and bake it for 20 minutes  everything was done Medium Rare.  Was not salty as others were stating. And did not take long, very easy recipe.
And my vegetables and potatoes were done at the same time.
Made it last year but came out even better tonight.

Absolutely delicious!  The rack turned out so beautiful and full of flavor!  Instead of searing on top of the stove I put a cast iron in the oven and heated it then seared the roast let it rest coated and put back into the hot oven in the same cast skillet.....fantastic!

I make lamb frequently and this is my new standard. Wow, what flavor. As long as you know how to clean up your rack (getting rid of excess fat and the membrane along the rack side) this will make you the "lamb god/goddess" with all your friends. How simple.

Absolutely Wonderful! I never measure so a grind of Himalayan Pink Sea Salt and Peppercorns, extra Rosemary made a rack that you couldn't pay top dollar for in the most exclusive restaurant! Have since used on chicken breasts and pork chops with the same delicious results!

It was great and my guests really liked it.  I had to substitute a grain mustard for Dijon and I should have cut back on how much I used. It was the strongest taste, but, aside from that,  I was pleased with how this came out.  I'd make this again.

This was a fantastic and easy recipe. My husband not only licked his plate clean, but he licked my plate clean as well! The only issue I had was I had to cook it a lot longer than the recommended time to get it to  rare/medium rare. I would have preferred medium but I was too hungry to wait at that point. I also felt that the salt could have been reduced, but that’s just personal preference. Looking forward to making this again!

Loved the recipe. I let the rack of lamb from Costco set at room temperature for one hour. I have noticed remarks on the salt.  I coated 1/2 tsp. on each side, salting was perfect. Due to the fact that Dijon Mustard is also salty, I LIGHTLY coated the lamb before breading. Of course, I watched the video very closely, because it was my first at home bake. Turned out perfect, and tasted great. It's a keeper!

This was really good. We used more garlic because we love it. Also used a meat thermometer because of the cooking time controversies; the cooking time will depend on the thickness of your meat. Our lamb came out perfectly. Good luck!

Made this for Christmas dinner and it was to die for! Mine was an 8 bone rack and it took about 23 minutes to get it to 135 degrees. After resting, it was a perfect medium done ness... pink inside but not red. Loved it and will definitely use this recipe again!

Outstanding - best lamb ever and I am one fussy cook. Made 2 racks - doubled the recipe.  - salted prior to searing ( based on prior feedback from others). Removed from oven at 130   -let it rest and YUMMY ..  cooked to perfection!!!   Juicy, tender, and so tasty .  You'll never order in a restaurant again - you won't find it any better than this.    Thank you ! Added  Note when cooking 2 racks  -after you coat with crust mix,  stand them up - place on a rack with rib bones intertwined - the juices held beautifully -makes for a great presentation

Made this for our  pre Christmas dinner! It was amazing and so easy. Tasted very gourmet-ish. Served with roasted red and sweet potatoes and yellow onions, paired with spaghetti zucchini and sliced & whole sauteed mushrooms and garlic. Yummmy!

Restaurant quality recipe! When I told the kids I was making lamb they all said "gross" until they tasted it. Once they tasted it they were then fighting for the last pieces. I would say that the recommended cooking time is off as if you follow what is listed it comes out very, very rare.  I now just use a good cooking thermometer which cooks it to perfection.

Hands down the best lamb recipe I’ve ever made or even tasted. I’ve also made it with panko crumbs as an alternative. Just as good.

Extremely delicious, if expensive. I would add 2 tablespoons of garlic powder and thyme, and maybe double the portions. Perhaps some mint jelly on the side as well. Also very important to make sure the chine bone is taken out at the butcher's. Very tough to cut through otherwise.

I wee bit more salt than I like, but otherwise really good.  Since I didn't have fresh bread for crumbs, I used panko crumbs.  That worked out well.

It was delicious!  I would suggest cook it for an additional 5 minutes.  It was a little too raw for me.  The flavor was great!  I sprinkled the bread droppings over the cut lamb before serving and sprinkled parsley on top and a little green onions.

Great recipe and somewhat easy.  Didn’t have Dijon but used honey mustard instead and dried rosemary instead of fresh.  I used panko bread crumbs and it turned out delicious.  This was my first attempt at roasting a rack of lamb and I was pleasantly surprised.

Definitely will make again!  Excellent recipe.  Only change was I used fresh thyme, as  rosemary is too strong for my palate.  I only had 4 chops so I cut the cook time to 1.25 mins & set the temp for 300*.  I nice slow cook that made the chops tender, juice and still medium.  Easy enough to prep and even easier to eat.

This is a real crowd pleaser! I followed the recommendations of using only 1/2 the amount of the salt  in the rub...and I didn't salt the meat before pan searing. Cast iron skillet worked well. Excellent flavor and very moist. Will definitely make this recipe again.

Made this recipe today and my husband and son we so excited to have the rack but once they ate it they could not stop the compliments.   My husband after dinner said it was probably THE best lamb he has ever had.  He wants me to make it for company next time.  I did minor changes as I didn't have any garlic so used garlic &  pepper spice and garlic salt.   I adjusted so the salt wouldn't be too much.  I also only has dry rosemary so I used a little less.  Used a little prepared mustard instead of Dijon.  Finally, this took a lot longer to cook then 18 minutes.  Closer to 40 and it was pretty rare.  I did not allow the roast to warm on the counter before cooking as one had mentioned.  Excellent recipe for my first time cooking a Rack of Lamb!  Thank you!!

I have made this lamb rack recipe many times and it always takes longer than it says. Use a meat thermometer at 160 and it takes about 1/2 an hour and is just right.

Loved it! I made it last year but it did not turn out well. Fortunately, I blamed it on user error and tried again. Tips from other reviewers were a huge help: letting the meat sit for about 30 minutes before prepping, a generous helping of mustard, patience, and about 15 minutes in the over for medium. Also, I got meat from Trader Joe's and I highly recommend it.

The crust is outstanding for flavor, but I had a hard time get the crumb mixture to adhere to the rack before roasting it and much fell off while carving it.

My family love it.  I used 1 cup of bread crumbs and next time would half the salt added to the bread crumb mixture.  I used dry rosemary and also added dry thyme as well.  Will definitely try this on other meats as well.

The lamb turned out fantastic, I used a cast iron frying pan so the browning of the meat was really nice. Used panko as I didn't have any bread crumbs and that was a mistake as the panko doesn't absorb the olive oil so didn't stick very well but the flavours were great! I would also use less salt next time. I would use this recipe again for sure!

The wife said... 'best lamb chops I've ever had."

I was floored how well this turned out.  An easy, quick, & inexpensive dinner (1 rack @ Costco = $11.00), for two.  Was made for Valentine's Day & was a home run.
Will definitely prepare this again.

This was probably the most delicious rack of lamb I ever made.  I didn't change a thing.  I had company for dinner and they raved about it and wanted the recipe.  I will definitely make it again.  Thumbs up on this recipe.

I used a petite rack of lamb from Costco,  8 ribs. I think all the ingredients  are good for two packs of them. I  cut the salt half down and made it and it's perfect, the meat is so tender ! Even the leftover is still very good. I'll try again pretty soon.

I've made three times now in the past 6 weeks - using Costco rack of lamb and cooking in my Dutch Oven.  Only change the last time was adding more Garlic.   Perfect all three times and I'm no longer afraid of cooking lamb!

This is a fantastic recipe.  I like others cut the salt in half. i had some fresh thyme, mint, and parsley  so I minced about 1 to 2 TBL of each  with the garlic in a food processor then mixed with the bread crumbs and olive oil. I used a cast iron skillet for both searing and cooking in the oven.  This one is a keeper!

It's pretty good but too many steps, and dirty dishes, for my taste. Also the cook time was way off, more like 35 minutes.

Cut salt by half. Brought rack to room temperature before starting prep. Let stand for ten minutes on completion. Very tender. Very flavourful.

This was deeeeeeelicious.  I made this for Christmas dinner, and my husband and I chowed down on this until it was gone.  We cooked the lamb to medium-medium rare, and it was so good we were still talking about it the next day.  Wouldn't change a thing.

Great recipe! I found an affordable rack of lamb at the grocery store but had no idea what to do. Luckily, I had all the ingredients for this recipe  in my cabinet and put it together in no time. The cooking times were a little off for this, my rack took quite a bit longer, but came out a perfect medium rare after about 25 minutes.

I've made this recipe twice now and it may be the only recipe I use for rack of lamb ever! It's seriously THAT good! And couldn't be easier! As others have mentioned, mine took about 15 min longer to cook. I recommend using a digital thermometer and checking before cutting into them.

I was a complete novice at making rack of lamb and this recipe was phenomenal the very first time and every time since. It's super easy regardless of whether you cook meat much. I do recommend a pan that can go from stove top to oven to make your clean up easier. A must try if you love lamb!

We absolutely loved this recipe. I did cut the salt in half and I couldn't find fresh rosemary so I had to use dry. Those were the only changes I made. Thank you very much for a great recipe!

I made this last night and they were delicious. My hubby literally devoured them. I did not add as much salt as the recipe called for and it tasted perfect. I cooked the meat for about 18 minutes but will cook it for 2 minutes extra next time. Overall, the recipe is amazingly simple and tasteful. Thank you so much.

My first ever time making a rack of lamb - and my husband, who doesn't like lamb, loved this!  Even my wanna-be vegetarian 13 year old liked it, and said she hated that she liked it (though she still ate very little).  I had a frenched rack, but with the heavy fat layer on the top.  As instructions didn't mention what to do about that, I decided to trim it way down before searing the rack.  I didn't have any rosemary, so subbed a bit of dried tarragon.  Probably used more minced garlic than I was supposed to, but it was fine.  Also subbed panko for the fresh bread crumbs.  You really don't taste the Dijon mustard, so it's definitely not overpowering.  It took me longer to get it to temp, but then it quickly went up past the 130 I was shooting for (as per another review).  I think it was in for about 23 minutes total, and I checked the temp at 12 and 18 minutes.  It was around 135 when I pulled it, and after 5 minutes stand time, I'd call it medium/medium rare.  DH liked it as it was, I could've stood a bit more rare.  Otherwise, wonderful!

I made the recipe as is, except with spicy brown mustard because I didn't have dijon. It was delicious and a hit with my kids. I will definitely make it again. I cooked it to 165F because I have little kids, but I would prefer it around 145.

Other than making lamb on the rod a few times, I have never prepared rack of lamb..  This dish was to die for!  My picky husband even said he was in heaven.  This was easy to make and very elegant.   I served it with buttered asparagus spears.  We will have this again and again!  On a scale of 1 to 5, I rate it at least a 12!

This recipe was the best recipe I have ever made.  Love to cook and try all kinds of different recipes.  This tops them all.  We don't like the taste of rosemary, so I added 2 tablespoons of minced onions instead

I followed this recipe exactly except that I used gluten free bread crumbs as I have celiac. It came out delicious!
Like some others we had to add cooking time in the oven as we like ours medium. The crusting tasted great. I will definitely make these again.

Delicious!!!
I don't like lamb but my husband loves it. I tried this recipe and it is incredibly delicious, this is the only way I can say that I can enjoy it. Even family members that don't like lamb but love it when I make it this way.
This is a hit every time I make it!!!

I have never made lamb... Ever!!!  These directions were absolutely perfect!!! I had a couple thinner slices so I cooked them at the end. I used sweet and spicy mustard from when I made some Chinese food and it added a great flavor. My kids gobbled it up as well as my picky husband. Will DEFINITELY make it again.

I've made this recipe multiple times to impress friends with my cooking skills.  It's simply delicious!  For people who think they don't like lamb, try this recipe and if you still don't like lamb, you never will.    I've made this exactly as written, but now I double the pepper and cut the salt in half, just for my family's personal taste.

This is a fantastic recipe.  Every thing went as planned.  I have always wanted to try rack of lamb and now I can say, been there and done that.  I did not have fresh rosemary so I used dry equivalent.  Thank you for this recipe.

I normally put my own spin on recipes, but this one I made just as it says. The only difference is I bought the rack of lamb already cut into separate pieces. I breaded both sides and followed everything else to a T. The result was restaurant quality!!! Seriously! I spent the entire time eating it raving about it. My guests loved it too!!! I have shared the link with friends and family as I think it is a must try. I made the bread crumbs by deeply toasting wheat bread in the oven on broil. I let the toast cool then chopped it into little pieces. Did I say it was great already?!

Incredibly tastey!  The only thing I've found is that it needs to be cooked for FAR LONGER than described.  It is like blood red with the amount of time they tell you to cook it.  look for much much longer!

I let my meat sit out to room temperature before starting like other reviewers said, however after 15-18 minutes the meat was still really rare. We added another 5 minutes - 23 and it was perfect med rare.

Wow!  What this is fabulous!  Followed everything exactly but used less salt as others suggested.  Take the time too make fresh breadcrumbs. Worth the effort. This is divine!!

That was great. I seared the lamb on the grill instead of the stove to avoid an oil mess, but otherwise followed the directions. 12 minutes in the oven and it was just the right amount of rare. Late Easter dinner.

This is absolutely fantastic. The video helps a lot. I have made this several times, always without the breadcrumbs. It is so tasty and without the breadcrumbs, it is carb-free!

My 9 year old daughter has a taste for lamb so I had to try this. One of the easiest things I've made. Since she's not a huge mustard person I used EVOO before rolling it in the breadcrumb garlic and rosemary mixture. It works great but was a tiny bit on the greasy side. Other than that my kid said its her new favorite meal

As others said, I reduced salt slightly and glad I did. 
This was my first time ever cooking lamb so I was totally clueless.  But my sweetheart loves lamb and I wanted a special dinner for valentines day.  He and I LOVED it.  He said this recipe is definitely a keeper?
But I would like to add that a rack of 7 will not feed 4 people but rather 2 people and that's pushing it!  All guys I know will prob eat 7 by themselves!

I'm not a lamb person but my partner is, so this was a special treat. He said it turned out perfectly and the flavour was great. I halved the salt and tossed in a bit of balsamic vinaigrette. Otherwise, I followed the recipe. Pulled it out at 134°F and it ended up rising in the skillet to 150°F. Concerned it would continue to rise, I pulled it out of the skillet and placed it on a plate. It rose to 155° before dropping back down. The meat was medium-medium well (we were aiming for medium). Next time, I'll pull it out of the skillet sooner. Also, for the small rack I had (8 bones), I could easily have used half the quantity of breading.

I use a few different recipes for lamb.  This our favorite.  The mustard does a great job offsetting the fattiness of the lamb.  I use crushed saltines instead of bread crumbs.  I do that for most recipes just from personal preference.  

The  thing I like most about the recipe is the technique of searing on the stove first.  I do that with beef roasts as well, and it works great for this too.

Wow, this was soooo good.  I used seasoned bread crumbs, dried rosemary, and didn't add any salt to the mix.  Salt and peppered before searing but I didn't have any Dijon mustard so I used a little olive oil to make the rub stick.  Mine was medium rare in 18 minutes and absolutely delicious.  Heading back to the store now to snatch up all of the post holiday racks of lamb on sale. Yummmmmmm!

Oh my sweet Jesus, this was amazing.

I have never made lamb before, and I am not a great cook, so I followed the recipe to a T, and it turned out really well. I cooked it for 13 minutes and let it rest for 5-6, and had a really great rare rack.

Excellent recipe. It was the first item gone from our Christmas dinner.  I know many like their lamb rare, however our family likes  it medium (drives chefs crazy). We had to cook it at least  twice a long  than the recommended 18 - 20 minutes.  Meat thermometer was a must for us. Still turned out tender with burst of flavor.  I added a little bit of fresh thyme to the mixture and used dried crushed rosemary.

This was phenomenal! Knocked a star off bc the cook time was way off. Put it in for 15 min and the inside was completely raw. The rack had been sitting out beforehand and everything so I'm not sure what the deal was. Probably took about a half an hour to come out medium rare. The flavor of it was awesome though and everyone raves about it.

Great Recipe. Agreed on less salt in mixture since you're rubbing it on before searing anyways. recommend roasting until 140 degrees in the meaty part for medium and take meat out early for room temperature.  those who want it well done, give them the edges or sear it on high for 20 seconds on both sides after slicing.  I served it with chimichurri sauce for Christmas party and it was a hit!

First time making lamb at home.  So glad we tried this recipe!  It was fairly easy and the bread crumble rub was super tasty!  The only thing I did not true to the recipe was using panko over breadcrumbs just because I have a lot of panko.  Otherwise followed everything as is.  I will definitely make this again, however I might use lamb chops as opposed to rack of lamb - personal preference as I like more heat contact with the meat.  We served this with a simple couscous and it was delicious.  Not sure why some said the dijon was overpowering - we could barely taste it - maybe they were using a strong ground mustard and not a true dijon?  We will make this again.

Thank you for the recipe - it is one of my go to for special occasions and all my family and friends rave about it.  The only thing I do is shave off the fat off the top of the rack.  This is wonderful - enjoy!!!!

This is one of my favorite recipes, I make this almost every time I come across a rack of lamb.  It's delicious, can't go wrong.

I don't like mine this rare, so I cook it a little extra - about 22 minutes.

I did add garlic when I seared it,  but I add garlic to just about everything.  I make this every Christmas for dinner and my family loves it. Last year some of our guest had never had lamb and still rave about it  when we talk food. Even the little kids loved it.

This is a fantastic recipe.  I've made it twice now, and we'll be having it for dinner again tonight.  My wife isn't a big fan of lamb, and always thinks rosemary is too overpowering, but (I hope) this dish should go down just right!

This is a simple and awesome recipe. I did also cut down on the salt. I only use salt and pepper to season the lamp. I also used brown spicy mustard.

My boyfriend went nuts over this lamb when I made it for his birthday dinner! I would suggest letting it sit out for a little bit before cooking, otherwise you will have to adjust your cooking time slightly. Great recipe.

We love this! Followed tips to let it reach room temp before starting to cook! Also to let it rest and finish cooking! The only thing I did different was to use honey dijon mustard,

Wow - these were just great. I am not a huge lamb lover. But, I made this recipe and did a few of the extras suggested by others (like cooking the bread crumbs first with herbs, garlic, etc.). This was a huge hit. The cooking instructions were also right on point. It came out exactly like we wanted.

Excellent and easy recipe!  I had never made a rack of lamb before.  I purchased a 1.36 lb. "frenched" rack of lamb at Costco.  Based on reviews here, I brought it to room temperature by leaving it on the counter for one hour.  I also only used half the salt called for, figuring more could be added later if needed.  After searing the rack, I brushed with a stone ground mustard (since I didn't have Dijon on hand), then coated with the bread crumb mixture.  I roasted it for 25 minutes.  It came out perfectly!  Still pink in the middle, but done enough for our tastes.  I will definitely make this again.

We thought this was delicious. I did, however, use Kosher salt and the amount was just right - not salty at all. Since the recipe doesn't specify Kosher salt, I think that the reviewers who found this to be too salty probably used regular table salt and that would have been too salty. I always use Kosher salt for this method of cooking meats - so much better!

Delicious. Didn't have Dijon mustard, so I used yellow mustard. Also, not a huge Rosemary fan, so just a sprinkle, not 2 T. 1 T of fresh minced garlic was enough for us. It is a nice recipe and easy to follow. Thanks.

Very tasty, but the breadcrumbs are a little overkill given the rich flavor of the lamb. Use bread crumbs lightly and less salt.

This was by far the best lamb I ever had, and I've eaten plenty of lamb in my lifetime.  I was crunched for time and skipped the whole searing process and it was still amazing!  I'm making it again tomorrow night, but this time allowing more time for searing.

This was delicious!
Few changes were panko crumbs instead of bread crumbs and I added a little horseradish to the mustard. A nice change from my normal recipe. It's a keeper!

I made this for my husband's birthday last year. We had only ever eaten lamb in high quality restaurants before so this was our first home attempt. Served with a red wine sauce, it was a huge hit for both of us.

Never cooked a rack of lamb before, but saw this recipe and it sounds so good I had to give it a try. Glad I did, even the pickiest of the cousins ate this up!! Meat was tender and juicy. Tryed it on Pork Chops and got the same result...mmmm, mmm good!

What a fabulously easy and delicious recipe! Thank you so much for sharing. I made this for dinner for my parents and the rest of my family (including two 4-year-olds!). It was a hit!  I cooked 3 separate racks in the oven at the same time for 17 minutes in total. I didn't have any Dijon mustard, so I used regular mustard (even though I'm not a fan). It turned out well and wasn't too "mustardy".  Be sure to use a meat thermometer, especially if this is your first time cooking lamb. It is easy to overdo it!  Bon appétit!

This is great and very tasty. I cooked it 15 min. and next time I would add 5 more min. I like my meat rare, but many people have a problem eating what they think is uncooked meat. Ease of preparation is an asset, plus the kitchen smelled so good!

This was my first experience with lamb. I thought it was good, but breadcrumb mixture was kinda soggy. I ended up scraping most of that off. But with a few tweaks I would definitely make again.

Thank you!!  This recipe turned out perfectly!  I opted not to use bread crumbs, as I wanted to really taste the meat, but other than that, I followed the recipe.  Searing it really helped seal in all of the flavors.  It ws delicious!

Made this for Valentine's day dinner.  It was very popular!  I took it out of the oven when it was medium rare according to the tip on the recipe, and it did cook a little more even afterwards so it was closer to medium while we were eating it.  Yum!!  I made it with mushroom mashed potatoes.

This recipe was OK, but wasn't great.  I think it would have been better if a sauce was served to compliment the coating put on the lamb.

Just wow.  I used extra-strong dijon, so was a little nervous on how it would turn out, but it was fabulous.  My husband is still raving about it, and we had it last night!

followed easy, precise instructions.  Roasted in a cast iron skillet.  Came out perfect.  A big plus since lamb of any kind in this area is hard to find.  Took remainder off bones, removed any excess fat, laid 'saddle' on bones, and stored.   Next time I will remove the 'fell' from the back of the ribs.  Will try replacing dijon mustard with a mixture of acacia honey and mint sauce.

I just made this dish last night and it was PERFECT!  My oven temperatures are a little high so it didn't take as long but otherwise I followed the recipe and it turned out fantastic.  Made it for my girlfriend and I and she said it was exactly what she imagined lamb should taste like.

Tasty and easy, looks gorgeous, except cooking time took longer than stated in the recipe. Maybe due to the fact that I didnt start with room temperature meat as I forgot to take it out of the fridge earlier.

We loved this.  Use a thermometer to make sure that you get the desired level of doneness as everyone's oven is a little different.  No sense in wasting an expensive cut of meat!  Next time that I make this I will cut the salt in half.  Other than that, it's perfect!

A really fabulous way to add a restaurant-quality touch to an already great meal. The one thing I would definitely change is in the bread crumb mixture, cut down the salt to no more than a 1/4 of a teaspoon because the salt used before searing the lamb will suffice. Other than the amount of salt being used, this is a a definite keeper, no question!

Made this for Easter dinner. I added 2 Tbs chopped parsley and 2 tsp chopped mint to the breadcrumb herb mixture (because I had some). Kept the cooking time scant for perfectly done medium rare chops. Awesome, delicious holiday presentation. My mom, who always cooked lamb until it was gray, said "I had no idea lamb doesn't have to taste gamey." Thanks, Ma.

Delicious!  Followed the reciped pretty much but didn't use salt on the meat. Agree that the meat should be taken out of refrigeration an hour or so before cooking.  I had to cook the racks longer than recipe says to get the desired doneness.

WOW.  We flipped!  Loving lamb, this was just over-the-top for us.  We served on Valentine's w/a beefy red wine and mint reduction and we almost couldn't stand the flavor.  In a good way. The crust is DIVINE.

I normally don't like lamb but cooked this for hubby's birthday (he loves lamb). It was a huge hit with him and the other folks who came for dinner. I ended up with 2 racks totaling 2 lbs., cooked for 20 minutes and let sit for 10. Came out about medium. Next time I will probably cook for a few more minutes for a little more doneness, but I'm personally not comfortable with such red lamb. Was very tender and had amazing flavor, I will definitely do this again.

This was positively, absolutely delicious.  My husband proclaimed it "even better than the meal [I] had at Capital Grille", which hasn't stopped talking about for months.  I used a frenched rack of lamb that we bought at Sam's Wholesale Club and it really couldn't have turned out more perfect.  I will definitely make this again - but invite company over next time!

I used half the amount of salt and garlic and omitted the bread crumbs (had none on hand). Baked the lamb in the oven for 30 mins. The center was slightly pinkish. The lamb was tender, juicy and flavorful. My husband loved it.

Delicious!  We used dried rosemary and balsamic infused olive oil.  Even my 10 year old loved it.

I found this recipe excellent.  I did cut back the rosemary a bit, but followed the rest of the directions and it was superb.  Cooking time was longer than listed but ovens are not all the same.

Absolutely the best! I just made this over the holidays and it got rave reviews. I will be making them again. I did half the salt to the crumb mix as suggested, and used a cast iron skillet. I did have to turn down the oven temp b/c the topping was getting black. I used a meat thermometer and cooked until 165 degrees b/c we wanted it cooked. Fantastic! Served with mint jelly on the side for those that wanted it.

This recipe is almost perfect!  Half the amount of salt suggested, and you're good to go.  The herb combination is sensational--it really brings out the lamb flavor.  Yum!

 6 mins under the broiler. Then breading for another 20 mins. 120 degrees perfect every time.

This was my first time to cook a Rack of Lamb. I made this for my husband and brother for fathers day.  They are still talking about it.  My brother gave me a kiss on the cheek and said of all the things I've cooked for him over the years, this was the best.  Only change I made was in the  bread crumbs. I only had seasoned bread crumbs and no bread to make fresh,so I put the rosemary, garlic and rice krispies in the food processor. Turned out fabulous.

We didn't care for the bread crumb coating, it was soggy and we thought it really took away from what could have been a good dish. Won't be making it again, no one even finished their first helping, most of the rack was wasted. I liked the combination of herbs though, and the lamb was juicy. I prepared the recipe just as stated, before anyone assumes I changed it.

Delicious on lamb chops too! Just sear in the pan and broil the crust for one minute in the oven. No need to bake them.

This is a great recipe!  Used it for my first time preparing lamb.  I ended up letting it bake for about 20 to 25 min.  Turned out great.. very tender.  I used the mint sauce recipe with it.  Both were wonderful.  I will use this one often!

My husband said it was a 5 out of 5 though I think I made a lot of mistakes.  The lamb was so lean, I should not have trimmed the fat.  I got the wrong cut (shoulder with a few ribs) which was impossible to sear all over.  My oven is very, very old so it took a long time to cook.... oh well... it still got a 5 out of 5. 

PLEASE someone tell me what Frenched means!!

WOW is all I can say.   My husband said he found his new favorite place for rack of lamb....the only thing that I did a litle different, was I added a little horseradish to the bread crumb mix, it just gave it a little extra zip, and eliminated the rosemary.

I thought this was an excellent recipe, and the best rack of lamb I have ever had. My husband who had 2 servings thought the crust was a little overpowering but I didn't agree. I would definitely be proud to serve this one to guests.  I cooked mine for 22 minutes to get it perfectly cooked for us.

This took about 35mins for the rack to cook to a nice pink colour. My oven being quite old just doesn't get to a hot enough temp. Next time I will use lamb cutlets instead of the rack. Very yummy though!

Absolutely delicious and easy.  Used a thermometer throughout cooking to get the perfect temperature.  Will definitely make this again and again. Fresh bread crumbs give it more texture...definitely beat using store bought dry crumbs!

I don't usually write reviews-this is my first one, but this recipe deserves a good word. I had to cook the meat longer than 18 minutes, more like 25, but that may have been because it was an 8 rib rack and still cold from thawing. The bread crumb mixture was delicious and easy to make. I used a roasting pan instead of an skillet and it turned out great. I will definitely make it again!

This was the first time I attempted a roast lamb and it turned out great. I stuck some garlic cloves into the lamb, used flavored breadcrumbs, and baked it for about 20 minutes and my boyfriend and I absolutely loved it!

This recipe deserves all the praiseit's gotten. Since my husband loathes garlic I used a bit of Hawaiian seasoned salt instead (which has a pinch of garlic in it). Results were still fabulous.

Very yummy recipe. I don't care for lamb that often but I just may eat more of it after this recipe. Very good presentation as well.

Excellent! I didn't use any salt, used homemade bread-crumbs and prepared the rack ahead of time (a few hours). I put it in the oven when my guests arrived and it was fantastic. I had to bake it for a little longer, it was very raw at first. The guidelines of temperatures at the bottom of the recipe didn't work for me, but I'm not sure if my thermometer was not working well. This is excellent for Easter... watch out, many supermarkets put their racks of lamb on sale near Easter!!

This was very tasty!  I chose a poor cut of lamb as it didn't have enough meat but I can see the potential in this recipe.  I bought some fresh rosemary for another superb recipe on this site (easy focaccia bread) and this was a great recipe so that none of the rosemary was wasted.

We LOVED this recipe! We used it on a ribbed poin loin roast at Easter. I used garlic, oregano, black pepper, and a little brown sugar in bread crumbs made from homemade garlic/butter croutons. My family said it was better than a gourmet restaurant meal!

This was an excellent dish.  I used lamb chops instead of a rack and crusted the sides with the breading.  This was my first time making lamb.  I cooked it rare and it was terrific.
