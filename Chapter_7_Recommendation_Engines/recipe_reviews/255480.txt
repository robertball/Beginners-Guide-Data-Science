I am an experienced cook and when trying a new recipe, almost always make it exactly as recommended the first time.  I made this recipe exactly as recommended.  The flavors  were pretty good, very buttery, but the textures were not.  The cake base was dry and hard and basically tasted like dry, hard, compacted overcooked yellow cake..  The buttery top tasted darned good, but was sticky and gluey; I am reasonably certain it was baked long enough, too.  I will not make it again and cannot recommend it to anyone else.

It doesn't say cake mix. It does say cake flour & they are yummy. It's sad when someone misreads something, then criticizes it unfairly.

This sounds so good! And I can't believe that somebody would give it a rating of one star based on the ingredients without even trying the recipe first to taste it first. Shame on you! So I'm going to counteract that rating because that is not fare.
