THIS IS AWESOME!!!!! We used apple juice instead of grated apples...worked better I think. We are going to try soaking a whole ham in this mixture over night for Easter...we will see how it works

Very tasty and easy.  I broiled the ham steak in the oven for 4 min. each side.  Served with baked sweet potato and canned corn.

This was very good. It enhanced the flavor of the ham without overwhelming it. It will become a standard recipe that I'll use.

I thought this was a quick and delicious recipe that the whole family loved.  Although it was good I thought it could of had even more flavor.  I may double the marinade next time because I barely had enough (maybe my ham steaks were bigger).  Overall very good though

Delicious, the marinade made the steaks very juicy, mine always dried out. I left out the cinnamon-personal preferrence, added apple juice-no apples, and a tsp of hot mustard. They marinaded for 2 days b/c dinner was interupted, that may have made more flavor come through. Thanks for sharing the recipe

This was great.....I did alter a bit, no sherry vinegar so I used red wine vinegar, also no honey so I used Honey mustard,olive oil in place of peanut, 1/2 of a Macintosh apple grated, dried rosemary, and forgot to add the cinnamon.

Not bad.  I didn't taste the marinade much, but what I did taste was pretty good.  I like how quick it was to prepare after being in the marinade.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was good, quick, easy.  I did sub apple juice for ease.  Made a double batch and marinated some tofu for my vegetarian husband and he also liked it.
