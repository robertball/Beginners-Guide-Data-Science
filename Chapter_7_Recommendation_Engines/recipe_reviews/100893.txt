I have been eating Vietnamese sandwiches for a quarter of a century and this is by far the best recipe I have ever found for them. I have made them with bot portabello mushrooms and BBQ pork steaks sliced into thin strips. My sisters and I get together to make them every couple months and like tamales we make them in dozens for our family and friends to enjoy.

These were very good but after trying them with the mushrooms first, I made them next with thinly sliced grilled chicken.  We all preferred them with the chicken.  These are nice since you can prep everything ahead of time other than the basil and cilantro.  The sandwich sauce was great.

One of the best sandwiches I've had!  Didn't have portabella's so I used crimini's and sauted on stove.  Don't forget to add the minced garlic to the sauce. The sauce is amazing.  Thanks for the great recipe.

The sauce for the bread is out of this world. I plan on using it as a dip for potstickers and possibly as a marinade. It did call for quite a bit  of sugar however so I plan on reducing it to 3-4 tablespoons next time. It also makes quite a lot. I ended up using approximately half of the sauce for 6 sandwiches (so this recipe should be able to cover 12 sandwiches). I did have a few changes to the sandwich in general which I believe made it yummilicous, first I toasted the bread and then added a bit of mayo (1 tsp) to each of the sandwiches. I also added a bit of sirloin which had been marinated in teriyaki sauce and then cooked. These things together with her fantastic sauce make this sandwich outstanding.  Thank you so much for the recipe. I know I will be making the sauce for years to come.

I made this for my brother, his wife and their teenage daughter.  All were impressed...this is arguably the best sandwich I have ever made.  I did vary from the recipe in that I did not make individual sandwiches...I made one big sandwich on a full 'pain,' and used 3 portobellos to feed four.  But man...what a fresh and refreshing and wonderful flavor and texture...ten stars!  Add a glass of cheap red and eat out of doors!

This was so delicious and unexpected!  I used grilled chicken with teriaki sauce instead of mushrooms and I loved it.  It was so full of fresh flavor!  I couldn't find the radish, so I substituted celery, and thought it was a good mix.  I will definitely make this again.

Very good.  I didnt have any sesame oil so i didnt even bother with it.  I toasted my bread with butter in the oven on broil 1min per side.  Added the sauce onto the bread, added some mayo to the bread.  I layered everything on it but the mushroom, didnt like it.  I used pulled pork as my meat and it was oh soooo gooood!!  Thanks for sharing!

I love vietnamese food, so when I saw this recipe I had to give it a try.  It is a keeper!  The only change that I would make is the bread.  The baguette was too thin to load all of the ingredients properly.  I tried it again with a french bread loaf and it was truly amazing.  The flavor is very unique and a must try if you like vietnamese food...

This is beyond 5 stars!  Thank you so much for the awesome recipe.  I added some thinly sliced red onion to the carrot/daikon after they were blanched and let the onion, carrot, daikon, and cucumber marinate overnight in the lime juice and vinegar mixture.  My husband and I were just about to dance around the house after eating this ;0)  We also have some leftover sauce that we'll use to dip spring rolls tomorrow night. Thanks again for the wonderful recipe!

I loved this sandwich!  I might try it with chicken the next time as suggested by others, or maybe even thinly sliced steak.  I had leftover veggies, so I threw the chopped jalapeno and cucumber in with the carrot and radish and let it all marinate overnight.  The next day I tossed my marinated veggies with some of the leftover sandwich sauce and it made a nice salad.

Wonderful! Only change was that I used chicken instead of mushrooms (don't like).  Terrific meal, so flavorful.  Lots of chopping and prep work, but well worth it.  Thanks for sharing!

Very good sandwich  sauce!  Blanching the carrots is also a great direction that I didn't find on other recipes. It allows the carrots to soak up the vinegar much more.  Thank you!

This was a really great recipe. Not difficult to make, tasty, and different. My only issue is that proportions are not quite right. The recipe calls for way too much sauce and daikon! And too little carrots and mushrooms, I would double both the carrots and mushrooms  (I can't believe I admit to the latter, I generally dislike mushrooms!) Otherwise, it was great! Thanks!

Thanks so much for this recipe! I loved it- the sandwich sauce is perfect! I didn't have rice vinegar and substituted rice wine which wasn't quite right. Still very very good! A great vegetarian lunch!

This recipe was sooooooooooooooo good.  Thank you so much.  I had left over cucumbers and some left over carrot/radish that I dumped into the left over sauce for a nice veggie salad tomorrow.  Yum!!!

These have so much flavor and I did not have the fish sauce so I used anchovie paste  and did them as an appy, put them on a little toasted slice of baggett  very refreshing if I could rate it higher I would. That sauce for the bread is the best.

You don't say where the minced garlic goes.  I've made this twice without the garlic and it is wonderful so I think I'll continue to skip it.
I have never had this type of sandwich so I don't know what is supposed to taste like.  I do know this was delicious!  I couldn't get any Thai Basil, I guess I'll try to grow some of my own.  I made my own baguettes. This was a really good sandwich, thanks for the recipe.  This would also be great with thinly sliced chicken or beef instead of the mushrooms.

This was easy & delicious. I made the sauce and marinated sliced pork in it while I was at work, then made fresh sauce when we were ready to eat. My toddler couldn't do the sandwich so he ate everything separately, but my husband and I loved the contrast between crunchy vegetables and soft bread. We will be making this again soon!

WOW! I used mock duck in place of the mushrooms- more substantial and more protein! Browned the mock duck in a non-stick skillet and added some of the sauce- a nice hint of sweet.  I shredded the carrots & radish, and didn't cook them.  Couldn't tell the difference in taste and it saved a step.  Wouldn't change anything else!

I felt that the sauce was a little tart for my taste so next time I may decide to do it along with mayonnaise which is also traditionally used in Banh-Mi sandwiches. I would also toast the bread to assure your sandwich doesn’t get soggy too quickly from the sauce. The cilantro and basil combination was great! This is definitely something that can be enjoyed in large portions without guilt.

Too much lime juice and no sugar in the pickling liquid. Otherwise, a good recipe. Sugar, vinegar, water and some salt will do it just fine. A little lime can't hurt of course, but 1/2 cup is way too much.

Really really good. I grilled some tofu and added it to the sandwich instead of the mushrooms and it was a true veggie delight. Only thing I would do differently next time is toast the bread as the sauce made my baguette quite soggy.

this sandwich is so fresh and delightful, I just love the veggies, I did add some meat to the sandwich but the sauce to marinate it in is awesome did add some teriakie to the chicken just so my picky eater would like some part of it. yummy will be on my menu every month. Thanks for the recipe.
