Great peppermint bark,  I made EXACTLY per recipe.  NEXT TIME I will do this: 1) Omit cream from chocolate, it makes it too soft and melts on hands too easily. 2) Melt ALL of the white chocolate at one time and spread on sheet, layer with 1/4 crushed candy 3) Spread all of the semisweet chocolate on top of chilled white chocolate, the semisweet chocolate has a strong flavor, so make the top layer of the semisweet chocolate thinner than the white chocolate ( I was temped to use equal parts chocolate just because I had the semisweet chips left). 4) Sprinkle with the rest of the crushed peppermint candy.  Like I said, I tried the exact recipe and the semisweet chocolate didn't ever set up correctly.

Excellent recipe. I only gave it 4 starts since I modified it after reading another review.  I omitted the cream. I used crushed candy canes (4) and folded them into the white chocolate. I didn't have any peppermint extract so I just drizzled plain melted dark chocolate over the white choc/candy cane mixture and then cut thru it with a knife - so it looked swirly & pretty. Then I topped it with the remaining crushed candy cane. Chilled it, then flipped it on the counter and cut it when it was room temp. It looks beautiful and is a hit on the holiday baking tray!

I got great reviews on my bark! I used about 1 lb of both milk and white chocolate for a 9x13 dish and also used peppermint oil vs extract. I crushed 12 candy canes and sifted the finer pieces out for the first layer and then topped everything off with the coarser pieces. Everyone loved it!

Fabulous!  I accidentally put in way too much peppermint extract into the dark chocolate layer, but it tasted perfect.  I did as others suggested and sifted the broken candy canes and added the "peppermint dust" to the white chocolate layer.  I did the dark chocolate in a double boiler, but then just did the white chocolate in the microwave.  Both came out great.  I did dark on bottom, white, then sprinkled the peppermint in on the top.  A lot of it fell out when I was breaking the bark, so next time I think I will either push it in harder or do as other recipes suggest and put the peppermint pieces on the bottom, pour white chocolate layer over, then dark chocolate layer on the top.  (invert when ready to serve).

I made the recipe almost exactly as shown, though I used semi-sweet instead of dark chocolate, and used 24 oz of white and 12 oz semi-sweet (chocolate chips in 12 oz bags).  I used the creme in the middle layer, and it was not too soft, as some reviews said, but a great contrast to the hard white chocolate on the top and bottom. I "chilled" each layer in the refrigerator so that the next layer could be spread over easily, and it has stayed hard, even after completely warming to room temp.   I took this to a holiday party and got a lot of compliments and requests for the recipe.

As an old time maker of this delicious treat it is important to get the timing of adding the white chocolate to the dark chocolate at right time.  Everyone always say to chill the white chocolate.  I never do.  I keep an eye on it and when the chocolate loses that super glossy look that shows that it is "setting up" that is when I add the white chocolate.  I must add that I live in New Mexico and we keep the house "coolish" so if you have a hot kitchen and want to put the dish in the fridge, go ahead, but watch it every minutes.  Putting one chocolate on top of another "cold chocolate" does not allow the two chocolates to hold on very well and will let the white chocolate come off of the dark when you go to cut it.  I follow the rest of the recipe, more or less, to the letter.

Taste and presentation is 5 star, esp. with the cream & extract added to the chocolate and if careful to layer edges evenly. Which puts this above some other peppermint bark recipes, in my opinion.  I rated 4 stars because I thought the mechanics of the recipe could be better. First "30 peppermint candies" is vague, to me. I used 12 regular/large candy canes: and it was just enough for my tupperware 9x13 (who has a 9 x 12 ?)that I used instead of foil or parchment:it flexes just enough, to work well. I found double plastic bagging and pounding with a meat mallet worked best to crush the peppermint,but not pulverize. Also, the chocolate layer doesnt separate as easily (when cutting)if you don't let it set in fridge more than a few minutes instead of 20 to add the next layer. And, white chocolate "chips" works fine. But be aware to melt  LOW and SLOW ( I did in microwave in 20 second intervals on 50% power, stirring each time) as chocolate seizes up easily(trust me, I know!:) I also,added a little (1 tsp)veg oil to help to liquify/spread easier. And,do slightly press top layer of candy canes into the white chocolate. It falls off, when cutting, if you don't. And, lastly, i will use another full 10 oz bag of white chocolate for a 9x 13:it was barely enough with only 1 " larger pan. Although, these are notes to myself. Hopefully, this helps someone else when making this recipe.

Make sure you use GOOD QUALITY chocolate (like Ghiradelli).   Turned out delicious. I was a little nervous about the dark chocolate layer squishing out after reading the other reviews, but decided to go ahead with the recipe as is. I'm so glad I did!! The ganache does not squish out, not even at room temperature and the flavor and texture are amazing! I'm a huge fan of peppermint bark and this was a great recipe! I really liked it! Thanks for sharing!

I followed this recipe exactly, and it was wonderful!  If you omit the cream, you will not get the ganache filling that makes it so awesome!  I spread the white chocolate and made a little ridge around the edges of the pan, then cooled it.  Then I put in the chocolate filling, and put it in the freezer until it was frozen.  Then when I spread the last of the white chocolate on the top, the white edges seal together.  Just don't spread it around too much or it will melt the chocolate and it won't look as nice.  I cut mine with a large sharp chopping knife and it worked great.  Thank you for this awesome recipe!

I made this because it sounded s-o-o-o good.  It tastes good-----BUT. When it came time to cut it the Dark Chocolate layer completely serperated from the bottom.  In fact, the bottom white chocolate layer was left as an almost solid sheet.  I was going to take this as a refreshment to a concerty of my wife's. I ended up munching on it at home (it was edible) and throwing the rest away.

This recipe is perfect as is!  I don't think I used 30 peppermint candies because I wasn't measuring but you can put as little or as much as you like.  Other than that I followed the recipe exactly and it tastes great!

I made these tonight for the first time (& for a sale item for my son's school fundraiser, so I was a little nervous). I must say, I haven't eaten one yet, but my husband and kids have and they said they were amazing.  I should post a picture of my kitchen after this, but will spare you the gory details and I have posted a pic of my bark instead.  I used molds and used white choc, semi, milk, & dark choc.  Ghiradelli & Hershey's were the brands I used.  Thank you for the awesome recipe.

In the midst of busy preparations 2 days before Christmas, I am taking the time to review this recipe because it is so amazing!  There is absolutely NO reason to change a thing about this recipe--it's perfect as is!  I used Ghirardelli white and dark chocolate and Bob's Sweet Stripes, a softer peppermint stick candy I found at WalMart for 88 cents a box (used 2 boxes).  The chocolate ganache in the middle is what makes this.  I went by the instructions step by step and absolutely love the results.  I make peppermint bark every Christmas--this will be the recipe I use from now on.  Thank you for sharing this outstanding recipe!!

Yum! I was a little preoccupied while making this, so I missed the part where I was only supposed to put 1/2 the white chocolate on the bottom, so I ended up with the full amount of white on the bottom and another smaller layer on the top. I omitted the heavy cream because I was out and it turned out tasty anyway. Thanks! :)

I've made this a few times.  It's pretty and indulgent!  The mint flavor is mild but doubling the flavor starts to overwhelm the chocolate flavor in my opinion/experience.  
To "temper" the chocolate:  Reserve small pieces of chocolate (1/3 of total amount for that layer) before melting.  Melt 2/3 of the chocolate over a double boiler until almost completely melted.  Remove from heat/boiler (being careful to wipe off any moisture from the insert to prevent the chocolate from seizing up accidentally) and stir in the reserved chocolate until completely smooth.  This will bring the chocolate to about the right temperature for spreading (86 degrees F for white or milk choc., and 90 degrees for dark).  
In my first batch the bottom white layer separated a little from the dark layer once cut.  I had much less problems the next time when I made sure there was a mix of coarse and fine candy pieces pressed into the bottom white layer.  Perhaps this gave the both layers something more to hold onto when it came time to quickly spread the melted dark chocolate mixture.  Lastly, using good quality chocolate does make a difference in the taste of the final product.  I prefer using the blocks of Belgium chocolate from a chocolatier as opposed to Bakers' chocolate chunks.  This recipe is a keeper!

I love this recipe, but I did modify it a little. Omit cream, and use a little bit of crisco in the chocolate when you melt it. The chocolate will set perfectly. Also, instead of putting the peppermint extract in the dark chocolate, use a little less, and put it in the white chocolate, to let the dark chocolate taste come out a little stronger, and take a little away from the sweetness of the white chocolate.
My family loves this recipe with the peppermint in either the dark or the white chocolate. I personally prefer it in the white, but its all up to you. =]

AMAZING!  and very addictive.  My husband does not like peppermint bark (he thinks it's too sweet), but he likes this.  It is very easy to make.  I didn't have any problem at all with the dark chocolate center being too soft, in fact it was perfect.  It is slightly softer than the white chocolate, which makes it heavenly.  I wonder if those who had problems used milk chocolate instead of dark chocolate (I saw that some had).  Milk chocolate would have a different consistancy.  This has the best balance of sweet, crunch, softer chocolate, mint.  It was a huge hit on Christmas.  If you have concern about how to crush the mints like I did, it was very easy.  I put them in a ziplock bag, placed the bag on top of folded paper towels on the concrete step outside, and pounded it with a mallet.  Fast, easy, not messy, and kind of fun.  If you're thinking about making this, don't hesitate, go get that chocolate and get started! I do store it in the fridge, and like to sit it on the counter for a few minutes before eating to let it warm up just a bit.

So delicous! Only thing I would change is add whipping cream to white chocolate instead of milk chocolate. But it was a totaly hit.

I never made Peppermint Bark before, this was my first time, and it was *Delish!*  The only thing that I didn't like was that the bark became soft and rubber-like if I left it out of the refrigerator (after I was complete with the recipe).  I googled this result and it appears that it was because I did not temper the chocolate.  I melted the chocolate in a double broiler and was careful not to scorch it...but even after chilling between layers, and chilling over night upon completion...it still got soft when left out at room temp (about 72 degrees). So, this was disappointing to me...

I made it as is, but added 2 T of milk to the white chocolate for the top layer because the chips weren't melting as well as they did for the bottom layer. This made the top a little softer like the ganache center. I actually liked this better, it was delicious and turned out great! This also prevents the white chocolate color from blending with the ganache, so it's easily spreadable.

This was ok. A lot of work for the outcome. I probably will not make this again; however, it was the best peppermint bark recipe that I have come across, so maybe this is just not a treat for me personally.

This was the best peppermint bark I've ever tasted.  I omitted the heavy cream and peppermint extract, melted the white chocolate first, sprinkled with peppermints, and chilled.  Next I melted the dark chocolate and sprinkled with peppermints.  I used about 1/3-1/2 of a bag of Andes Peppermint Crunch mixed with the crushed peppermints.  Delicious!

Very good taste.  The only change I made was omitting the cream after reading other reviews.  The bark turned out perfectly and is beauitful.

Loved this! It was pretty easy too. Make sure you freeze your chocolate between layering! I gave this as a gift for the holidays and everyone complimented it!

I made this three times this holiday season  - once for home and two batches to give as gifts.  I found it easiest to line a small baking pan with tin foil and then "paint" the first layer of chocolate on with a silicone spatula.  I let it cool, threw it in the freezer for 10 minutes and then "painted" on the next layer, etc.  The "painting" really helps create even layers and the freezing ensures the solid layers don't melt too much as you put the warmer melted chocolate on top.  Delicious!

After melting the dark chocolate, I added the heavy cream and peppermint and the chocolate promptly separated. I would not make this again.

I made this twice.  The first time as written, the second time used vanilla instead of peppermint extract, with equal amounts dark and white chocolate.  My family preferred the second batch.

I am making this for the 5th Xmas eve in a row, exactly as written.  Each year my technique impoves and the original recipe makes more sense. The only thing I still need to perfect is my timing -- I am getting so speedy that I had the 2nd layer melted before the first was cooled. But after 5 years it's time to say thanks for a great recipe! My kids help me make this, it is relatively simple and they can all contribute (my 8 year old just unwrapped and smashed the peppermints). We all look forward to seeing this recipe on our cookie tray, thank you carol!

This was a perfect recipe for my friend's annual cookie/confection exchange party, and it went well until it came to the cutting part. The top layer was splitting away from the bottom two. I deduced this must have happened because I sprinkled the dust from the crushed candies between the first two layers,but not the last one. I will definitely make this yummy bark again, but this time I will dust BOTH layers.

I followed the directions exactly and it did not turn out so well. The middle layer of dark chocolate did not stick to the bottom layer of white chocolate. I probably should have listened to the other reviews and omitted the cream.

This bark was completely great and successful until the top layer. The middle chocolate layer is way too creamy....and when I went to spread HOT white chocolate on top, it softened the ganache layer too much and the brown mixed with the white making a mess. I tried to "swirl" it to recover it, but in the end, it was a mess. It still tasted good.  But next time I will definitely put less cream in so the middle layer hardens better.

I wouldn't omit a thing. The ganache layer is what makes this recipe. I am not a big fan of peppermint, but I love this recipe. It has been a big hit with my friends and co-workers.

This was great. I only gave 4 stars because I made some changes.  melted semi sweet chocolate chips in microwave, added peppermint oil and spread on foil lined pan. Let cool. Then added crushed pepermints to melted white chocolate and poured over dark chocolate. Will definately make again !

I made this exactly according to the recipe and it was fabulous!!  I took it to our family Christmas party and everyone loved it.  The softer chocolate layer in the middle really makes it yummy!!  I made two batches of this and the second time around it was so simple to make.  Great recipe!!

This is delicious. I was a little nervous about the dark chocolate layer squishing out after reading the other reviews, but decided to go ahead with the recipe as is. I'm so glad I did!! The ganache does not squish out, not even at room temperature and the flavor and texture are amazing! I'm not even a huge fan of peppermint bark but I really liked this. Thanks for a great recipe.

I would love to give this five stars because it got a lot of compliments.  I think I did a few things wrong.  I should have used a bigger cookie sheet to spread this very thin, I thought it was too thick.  The bottom layer of white did not stick, but I served it with just the top two and they ate it.  People commented that the chocolate 'ganache' was yummy.  I will try this again.

I think next time I will try a slighty larger pan to make it just a bit thinner bc this recipe seemed to be a little thick, but other excellent!  I did not have a double broiler but was able to make do just fine!

So easy and TOTALLY kicks traditional bark up a notch. This is a big hit every year, I don't change a thing and it's creamy on the inside with a great snap and crunch on the outside.

Here's the deal . . .  made this today, and the first two layers worked great.  The chocolate layer had to stay in the refer much longer than I had hoped, and the top layer didn't adhere to the ganach.  So, the white chocolate cracks and separates, which is not attractive.  Also, I had a big cinnamon candy cane to use up, so used that, plus cinnamon oil in the ganach, and it's pretty darned tasty!  Oh, well, I'll just have to eat it all myself and make something different to take to bridge tomorrow night.  Boo hoo.

taste great. the preperation was a little difficult. white chips did not melt, so i added a swig of water. I didn't have enough chips to spread over the pan for either layer. i agree with another poster that the bark is not hard, but a little chewy. in addition the white top layer muddied with the middle chocolate layer.

Yummy!!  I ended up using milk chocolate chips, and white chocolate chips, and candy canes(instead of the round peppermint candies) but it was yummy all the same! Everyone who tried it loved it too. I will totally be making this candy again!!

The first time I made this treat, I followed the recipe and found it a little thick. The second time, I used 1/2 the amount of white chocolate which really brought out the dark chocolate center - yummy!! This treat was a hit at our Christmas Party! I had many requests for the recipe.

Well I will start off saying this is my first time trying candies...  I do not like the dark chocolate with the white. Also I made just as recipe states with 3 layers (white, dark, white) and I think it is too thick. The dark chocolate is to squishy so when I took layers out to cut up...the dark just squished out as I cut with large cutting knife.   When I try this again I shall not add the cream as someone had mentioned. I will not do 3 layers, just 2 layers as in the picture. And I will try semi sweet chocolate instead of dark.   Happy Holidays all!

We threw caution TO THE WIND making a THICK MINTY slab of this bark over the weekend! Like the smile of a dutiful child, a successful county bake sale to save the clock tower, or Tom Brady’s knowing smirk after a big win, in-taking several chunks of creamy minty goodness just warms the soul. This recipe will see me again.

Loved it.  Made exactly as recipe indicated, only microwaved the chocolate for 45 seconds on high and then 10 second intervals until almost melted.  Turned out brilliant, and even though it kind of separated at the ganache filled center when you bite into it, it was still great.

This was delicious! I’m not typically a fan golf peppermint bark but my son loves it so I wanted to make it for him. Easy to follow directions. I read other reviews and I didn’t refrigerate between layers but watched for the shine to disappear as someone suggested. It turned out perfect! No problems with layers not sticking. My son liked it but said he wanted more peppermint so next time I’ll probably add more flavoring. My husband said it was perfect the way it was. I loved it too! The hardest part was getting it out of the pan, ended up using a pizza cutter to get it started...lol. Then just broke it up by hand. Love this!!! New addition to my holiday goods.

Delicious!  I followed the recipe exactly except I had 2 12oz bags of white choc chips instead of 20 total ozs so the white choc layers probably came out a bit thicker than intended. However I think it was a nice crunchy contrast to the soft ganache in the middle. P.S. If you omit the cream from this you are making a completely different recipe.

I made it according to the directions. The only thing I did after reading another reviewers suggestion was to add crushed candy to white chocolate.  I think the heavy cream is a great addition and would not leave it out as some suggested. Really good!

Best peppermint bark ever.  I've made this three times, and the first time, I didn't use any heavy cream as many reviews suggested.  That year, our guests liked it, but it was nothing spectacular.  The next year, we decided to give it another try, but we used and followed the recipe exactly.  The dark chocolate did not come out from the two other layers and we had a perfect, creamy center.  Everybody loved it.  Do not take out the cream.  You just have to be relatively fast when pouring the chocolate and chill it between layers.  If you make this recipe, you will NOT be disappointed!

Absolutely amazing peppermint bark with contrasting textures!  I put candy canes in a food processor and made a pink peppermint dust to layer onto the chocolate.  I also used dark instead of semi-sweet chocolate.   Be sure to use high quality chocolate like Ghirardelli.

Easy to make and delicious. I used cream (a little less than the recipe called for) and it came out perfectly. Didn't have the squishing other reviews described, the chocolate layer was just a bit softer (but still was firm) than the white chocolate.

I've never tried PB before, but now I'm a fan!  This was delicious!  I read that others didn't like the heavy cream, but I thought it paired very well and made it creamy.  From others I hear that regular PB feels like it's breaking your teeth, almost like a peanut brittle.  I liked that this recipe wasn't like that.  This will be the gift item for my neighbors during the Holiday's.  I wouldn't change a thing on this recipe!  Simply Perfection!

So easy and yummy. I combined a few suggestions and opted to reduce the amount of heavy cream to 4 tbls instead of omitting it completely. I thought it was great.
This year I will try it without heavy cream and will report back.

I never liked peppermint bark and was not a white chocolate fan until I made this. I've gotten so many rave reviews for this and everyone asks for the recipe! It's the dark chocolate ganache layer that makes it! I add a couple tbsp's of cream and a 1/2 tsp of peppermint extract to the top layer of white chocolate also, makes it a little softer. Yum!

Gotta do the ganache filling! I had no problem with the layers separating, but I didn't refrigerate the first layer for more than just a few minutes. That way the layers kind of fuse together. If you let the white chocolate completely harden I can see where it might separate. The soft ganache inner layer makes me think of a truffle filling and contrasts wonderfully with the hard white chocolate and peppermint bits. Will make again!

I made this to give to neighbors as Christmas gifts. It was easy to make and got lots of rave reviews. Several people commented that it was their favorite thing in the cookie tin. We will definitely make this again next year. It's a little different from other peppermint bark recipes because the chocolate layer in the middle stays creamy, which gives it a nice ganache quality. The flavor was very good, and they look quite pretty if you cut them into triangles. I used the microwave to melt the white chocolate just to make it easier, and it worked great!

The best peppermint bark ever - I think this will be my 4th year making it! Don't fear the double boiler, be sure to stir slowly so you don't allow air bubbles in the ganache. My family & friends beg for this stuff, nothing compares. Thank you to the creator or whoever came up with this. :)

This is fantastic peppermint bark! I thought it might have too strong of a peppermint taste, but it was perfect. I made the recipe exactly as shown and had no issues. With the cream in the chocolate layer the consistency is more of a ganache, but putting it in the fridge between layers, per the instructions, hardened it right up! I have already shared the link to the recipe with several people!  An easy holiday treat.

I left out the cream, as it kept causing my chocolate to seize, and I found I didn't need it to make the chocolate spreadable. Easy and delectable! However, a word of warning: do not mix peppermint extract with the dark chocolate either. I tried twice and threw out 2 bags of chocolate because the additive makes the chocolate seize. The solution was just to add the peppermint extract to the white chocolate instead, which mixed a little better. These make a great gift and a beautiful addition to a cookie tray.

Excellent recipe. This is so delecious and easy to made. I didn't have heavy cream so I made it my own. I didn't use all the white chocolate because it seems too much and thick when I spred it over the dark chocolate. It turns out good, too. The chocolates that I used is for cooking and it will melt if I take it out from refrigerator for too long. Not so sure if others have the same issue or not. It's time consuming to cut the white chocolate but it's really worthed. I'll made this again. Thank you to share this recepi to all of us.

Great recipe.  Only change was using half the tbsps cream to start out with, and then adding in more if I thought it needed it.  I made this as Christmas gifts, and everyone absolutely loved it and couldn't believe I made it myself.  I crushed my own peppermint, and it was a disaster, so I started using the WilliamsSonoma precrushed peppermint.  This was the way to go if you don't mind spending the extra money.

Delicious result! I found the dark chocolate layer stayed a bit too soft, so the second time I made it, I reduced the cream by one tablespoon. This makes a great gift, presented in a cellophane gift bag.

This was nice and easy. super tasty and makes a LARGE batch! 
what i did different:
I used a bit more dark 12 oz because i like dark chocolate. Also I used candy canes (tis the season) which means i didn't have to peel all those separate candies. i put mint in between each layer. 
i also do not have a double boiler, so i put a bowl over boiling water and it worked just fine. didn't want to spend the money on something i might only use once.

I was a little bummed with this recipe...mainly because my hopes were so high after reading the reviews. The ingredients are by no means cheap either. The center layer was oozy and didn't set up. When trying to slice, it smashed and oozed all over the pretty white chocolate making a mess. We will definitely enjoy at home but as far as using in our annual christmas cookie give aways...its a bust. Still yummy, just messy.
