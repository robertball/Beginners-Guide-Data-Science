Our family all agreed it deserved 5 stars! Alot of work, but well worth it. All you need is a sliver cuz it is so sweet. Will totally make again :-) Couldn't find coffee ice cream so I made it with vanilla yogurt and fat free cool whip. Yummy!

My son wanted an ice cream cake for his 18th birthday, but I made this pie instead. I only used about 2 Tbsp of chocolate chips mixed in the first ice cream layer & it was plenty with the coffee ice cream. Topped the Cool Whip with rainbow sprinkles instead of crushed oreos & chocolate drizzle. He loved it!

Great recipe!  Agree with the other reviewer that it is super sweet so you only need a sliver.  I made my own Oreo crust with ground up Oreos and butter.  So decedent!

My big family had a party and I made two of these.  Everyone LOVED them!  They turned out really beautiful too :).   

I made one with coffee ice cream and one with vanilla since I wasn't sure how the coffee would go over with all the kiddos.  Both were amazing but the coffee was our favorite.  Just seemed to have that extra special something.  My aunt who is known for her mud pies said that her secret recipe involved a drizzle of Kahlua on the top.  I might try that next!

For the crust... I bought 3 prepackaged Oreo crusts and put them into my own prettier and bigger pie dishes.  I wanted to make sure I had enough room for all the ice cream per other reviews.  I had to add a smidge of melted butter to help bind the crust when I did this.  Everything else I did the same... but I used a whole container of ice cream for each one, not just a quart.  Oh, and I did only put one package of tini chocolate chips for both pies instead of just one.  It was plenty.  And for the topping... we like Reddi Whip, so I put that around the edge and one dollop in the middle.  I put cherries in the middle and Oreo cookies around the edge before I drizzled it all with syrup.

Lastly, I did only wait 40 minutes or so before each step.  And yes, like other reviewers said, it is sweet.  But that's what makes it so good!  One of my sisters thought the bottom was cookie dough instead of just ice cream!  When you slice it up, it's as pretty as it is delicious!  Thanks for the recipe!!

I’ve made mud pie for over 30 years (my husband’s requested birthday dessert!) and decided to try a variation, just for fun. (I made this as written but substituted heavy whipping cream for the cool whip.) This is all just too much. Too. Much. The mini chocolate chips are a good idea but 12 oz is way too much...I would recommend 6 oz or even less. Even better would be a crushed Oreo layer between ice cream layers and skip the mini chips. The chocolate syrup on top of it all — again, just too much. (And I like chocolate!) Warming the fudge sauce and pouring it over the frozen ice cream made a mess, although added yumminess. I think I’ll revert to my usual method: chocolate crust, coffee ice cream, warm fudge sauce poured over slice, add a generous dollop of whipped cream, and sprinkle with toasted almonds. Skip the chips. Consider the crushed cookies.

Made this for my husbands birthday - turned out very good!
Took suggestion to cut some of the chocolate chips and added just a few to the bottom layer.  Everyone loved it!

Easy and delicious, a great go-to dessert for picky eaters.  I made this with vanilla ice-cream, because not everyone is crazy about coffee ice cream (personally I love it).  12 ounces of mini chocolate chips was way too many, you could probably use half that amount or less, or even none at all.  You could probably also use less cool-whip.  Overall extremely easy to make, just make sure you have enough time for each round of freezing.  Easy to modify to your liking.

I made this recipe and thought it was way too sweet--but part of my problem was that I couldn't get all of the ice cream called for on the second later, so the chocolate really overpowered the coffee flavor.  I would recommend halving the chocolate chips in the bottom layer.  My pie didn't look like the picture, which looks like it has just a few chips in the bottom layer.  I used the whole bag, which may have been misunderstanding the recipe.  And make sure you thoroughly freeze the bottom layer before you put on the hot fudge layer, or they will get melted together.

Everything was great but don't use chocolate chips. Leave them out. I can't stress that enough. I also only waited 30-45 minutes between each step.

came out good. My pan was too small for the second layer of ice cream so I left it out.
