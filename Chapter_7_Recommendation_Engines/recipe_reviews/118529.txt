I also didn't have any yellow cake on hand, so I used the spice cake I had in the cupboard and omitted the pumpkin pie spice.  I made them into cupcakes and they were a hit.  My husband loved them and said they melt in your mouth.  I was in a rush so I just topped them with pre-made cream cheese icing from the store, and they still had a great homemade taste.

I thought for sure I had a yellow cake mix in the cupboard, but no.  So used a spice cake mix instead.  Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly and this came out great.  What a simple way to make cream cheese frosting! Thanks for the recipe!

Oh geez, you just can't go wrong with this recipe. The only thing I added was pumpkin spice and it turned out fantastic! 10/2009 UPDATE: If you add about 1/2 cup more pumpkin the cake turns out really, really moist. Spice cake works fabulously - just leave out the spice.

Absolutely WONDERFUL!!!!  Thank you for this recipe.  It was SOOOOO easy to make and it is DELICIOUS.  I did not change a thing in this recipe, it is great just the way it is.  EVERYONE loved it and the entire cake was gone in the blink of an eye.  I will definitely make this cake again.

This cake is so "no-fuss" that I had it mixed up and in the oven during a TV commercial! Later, during another commercial, I frosted it!  Hubs is taking this to work tomorrow so for ease in transporting and serving I made it in a Bundt pan.  For the frosting I just warmed up a tub of vanilla frosting and spooned it over the top.  This is mildly spiced with a subtle pumpkin flavor, a very unexpected difference from typical pumpkin cakes or breads - much lighter all the way around and with a very pleasant flavor.  Still, it is what it is, a doctored up cake mix, but a pretty good one.

This was a hit.  When I read the previous review, I was worried that about whether or not to add water, so I went without it and it was perfect.  No water necessary.  This is easy and really yummy.  I think making the frosting with cream cheese is good, but an extra step.  Next time, I'll try a form of prepackaged cream cheese icing and see how it works.  I think I'm going to go have leftovers for breakfast now. YUM!

Very moist!  My pan was 12x17, so baking time was perfect at 20 minutes.  I did not have a yellow cake mix, so I used a reduced sugar chocolate cake mix (which turned out quite good) and used splenda blend in place of the full sugar.  To the (whipped white) frosting and cream cheese, I added a few shakes of pumpkin pie spice and some Butter-Nut flavored vanilla.  I plan to try it using a spice cake or carrot cake next time.  Very good & easy!  Thanks for sharing!

I'm not much of a baker, and this cake was really easy and delicious. Very moist. I made no modifications to the recipe and it came out perfect. I'll definitely be serving this one again.

Turned out great!  I left the sugar out--didn't need it.  It was plenty sweet without extra sugar, especially if you put the icing on.  I used 1/4 cup veg oil and 1/4 cup unsweet. applesauce in the cake and it rose nicely and was moist.  I sprinkled chopped pecans on top of the icing.

Our 8yo made this a few days ago in a roasting pan (we don't have a 15x10) and it was good.  Really moist!   I think it tastes like spice cake and not like pumpkin, so I'd probably just opt for a boxed spice cake mix next time for the sake of convenience.

This was really yummy and makes a lot - perfect for a pot luck, etc! I cut it into bit-sized pieces for my son's pre-school harvest party, sent some with hubby to work, and brought some to my work. Everyone loved it and we even had  enough leftover to munch on for a few days as well.

Pretty good! I made this with a spice cake mix. Instead of using canned frosting, I made Cream Cheese Frosting  II from this site.

I made this cake for my bosses birthday and everyone loved it. I thought it was good but lacked pumpkin flavor, it tasted more like spice cake to me. I frosted it with Cream Cheese Frosting II from this site which I absolutely love. I think anything frosted with that stuff would taste good.

I made these into cupcakes and absolutely loved them! Perfect treat when the weather starts getting cooler. Used regular yellow cake mix but doubled up on the pumpkin pie spice. The frosting is to die for!

Very good! Instead of making Paul's Pumpkin Bars (which seemed quite a bit more labor intensive, IMHO), I decided to make this recipe instead. I made two 8x8 inch cakes. One is for my bible study women's group leader (she just lost her mom so I am delivering her and her hubby a warm meal - with dessert!) and the other is for me and my fiance. I followed Nancy's directions to the letter except for baking two small cakes as noted above. Since I did not bake in a 9x13 pan, I followed the baking instructions printed on my Duncan Hines classic yellow cake mix box - for two 8 inch cakes, bake at 350 degrees for 33-36 minutes (I baked mine for 34.5 minutes total). For a nice finishing touch, I sprinkled each cake with pecan chips. Thanks for sharing your recipe, Ms. Heider! I LOVE fall. this cake had just the right amount of spice and pumpkin flavor, perfect for celebrating the season :)

I made this cake over the weekend and thought it turned out good. I have been reading some of the other reviews and I think I will try to change it up a bit the next time I make it just for fun. It is a moist cake, and not overly sweet which is nice. I did have to cook a bit longer because I'm in a high altitude area, but it was delicious!

I used this recipe to make cupcakes and they turned out moist and delicious. I used a store-bought cream cheese icing because I was short on time, which I don't really recommend. It tasted kind of plastic-y and took away from the rich homemade taste of the cupcakes.

Good, but not great. Made exactly as written, but didn't have a lot of pumpkin taste. Would use more pumpkin and/or spices next time.

Very good and extremely moist. Did not use frosting. I think just  a dusting of powdered sugar is enough. (But I am not really into frosting) My favorite pumpkin cake recipe so far. May make into Pumpkin Bread the next time. Maybe for that use a drizzle of powdered sugar icing for a nice touch and presentation.

Not sure what the fuss was about.  I did not like the icing but then I don't like the store bought frostings so what was I thinking.  I guess I was hoping the cream cheese would work miracles.  If I ever make this again, I'd like to try adding about 1 1/2 cups of grated carrots to the mix!  Maybe that and homemade icing would do the trick.  It was a moist cake but I would like it to taste more of pumpkin.  I brought it to work and it lasted an unheard of 3 days so was not very popular.

I used Funfetti cake mix and it is delicious!  Not the strongest pumpkin flavor, but it is there.  Perfect moisture, consistency, etc.  Great without frosting or with a thin layer of it.

I had to change this recipe some because first of all the yellow cake mix I had in my pantry had expired. I did have a box of Butter pecan cake mix so I used that instead. Also I didn't have pumpkin pie spice so I added one and a half tsp. cinnamon, one tsp ginger and 1/4 tsp ground cloves.I maybe could have used a little more spices but was afraid to over do it as I'm not a big spice cake fan. I made 24 cupcakes and baked at 350 degrees for 20 minutes instead of the 9x13 cake. I frosted them with cream cheese frosting. They still turned out really great, but would probably have even been better with the yellow cake mix and correct amount of spices. Thanks for the super easy yummy recipe. 
Edit: My son just tried these and said not to change my changes. He liked the butter pecan mix substitution and the spice amounts just as they were.

I love this recipe!!! It is sooooo moist and yummy. Not to mention my house smells amazing when it's baking. The only change I made was I used a German Chocolate cake mix since that was all I had and then topped it with the Cream Cheese Frosting II from this site and sprinkled candied pumpkin seeds on the top. WOW!!! I get so many compliments when I make it and it's always the first dessert finished.

I made this for my son's 1st birthday, and it was a huge hit. I made him his own little pumpkin by baking the batter in a small glass bowl, coloring the icing orange, and frosted a marshmallow green for a stem.. The rest went for cupcakes. This will definitely be his cake every year. I like to bake from scratch, but this is great for a crowd.
