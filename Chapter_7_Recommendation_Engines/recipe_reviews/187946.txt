The only thing I did differently was use fresh broccoli and cooked it using a little bit of leftover bacon drippings. AMAZING

In deference to Hubs' sensitive innards, I had to skip the crushed red pepper flakes and used some fresh ground black pepper instead.  I used fresh broccoli, added a little clarified butter along with the olive oil and some minced garlic right at the end of cooking so it wouldn't burn. Some of the best broccoli we 've ever had.

This was really good and couldn't be easier, and probably the only way I will prepare frozen broccoli from now on...I  added 2 cloves of chopped garlic to the pan and also sprinkled with parm cheese before serving.  Loved that I was able to get normally mushy frozen broccoli crispy and yummy, thank you!

This is good! I ate this at the Franciscan on Fisherman's Wharf in San Francisco and it's a great spin on cooking broccoli. When I made it at home I just used olive oil, black pepper, and sea salt. If your going to rate broccoli 1-5 it's a 5.

Very easy and tasty recipe.  I unthawed the broccoli and then gently squeezed some of the water out of it. I sauteed 1/2 an onion and 2 sliced garlic cloves in the oil for a couple of minutes, then added the broccoli.  I topped my second serving with a little fresh grated parmesan cheese.  This recipe is a great way to prepare frozen broccoli.  I had intended on not buying any more frozen broccoli because I usually wind up throwing it out whether it's been cooked or has grown old in the freezer.  Now that I've found a good way to prepare it, I will buy more.

I was looking for something simple yet tasty for broccoli and came across this recipe. I did not use salt but sprayed  "I can't believe it's not butter."  Tasted like I should have made more - really delicious.

What a unique way to cook broccoli!  Wonderful crispness, great flavor and so easy to prepare!  Added fresh minced garlic the last 3 minutes of cooking so the garlic wouldn't burn and turn bitter.  A new family favorite and definitely 5 star!

My vegetable hating husband said this was the best broccoli he's ever had and even my 5- and 7-year-olds liked it (for broccoli). This might become my new regular way of cooking broccoli. I put in the full amount of red pepper and added a sprinkling of garlic salt. I personally think it tastes better steamed for just a couple of minutes before frying because I prefer less crunch in my broccoli.

A variation of this is to use half broccoli and half cauliflower. If you brown slivered almonds in half butter and half olive oil first, then add veggies, man it is really good!!

This was really good and easy and quick to make.  I added some seasoning salt.  After fried, I added some parmesan cheese.  Pretty healthy.

4 stars because this was good and healthy and I will definitely make it again. However, maybe because I was using fresh broccoli, I cooked this for a while - even longer than suggested - and while the end result  was really good, I'm not sure I'd call it "crispy" or "fried". I think sauteed or stir-fried broccoli might be a more apt description for this recipe. Really, a minor quibble though, because it was GOOD!

I would cut down to 1/4 tsp red pepper flakes next time, but we don't like food very spicy.  This is an interesting dish and I would recommend it for a real change when entertaining but there is nothing like steamed broccoli with a little butter for family meals.

I had a big, bag of frozen broccoli around, because I'm trying to lose some weight and eat healthier.  I dreaded, thinking about cooking it.  I saw this recipe and thought it  looked good!  I made this as a side dish.  It's awesome!  I could have eaten a big, gigantic, bowl of this broccoli all by it's self!  I added garlic like some suggested and man, is this good! That little bit of caramelization, the broccoli gets does the trick. I was never excited about frozen veggies before, but I could eat this every day.

This was a wonderful alternative to boring steamed broccoli.  I used fresh broccoli, and LOVED the crunchy texture at the end.  I added some minched garlic to the olive oil and red pepper flakes.  Sprinkled with salt while cooking.  This will be my go-to method for cooking broccoli from now on!  :)  Yum!

This was basically a stir-fry method with olive oil instead of wok oil. But it was really good! Next time, I will play with the amount of red pepper spice as it was a tad too spicy for me. I also added chicken and baby carrots to the mix to take up some of the spice, so I really ended up with a stir-fry type meal! Will def. make again. My husband even liked it. Used fresh broccoli. Thanks!

This was a really clever idea. I LOVE broccoli, and am always looking for new ways to cook it. As much as I like mixing it into stuff, it's nice to see it stand alone as a side. This recipe definitely spiced up my boring broccoli, and made me love it all over again.

This is the first time I've used frying as a preparation for broccoli...not only a really quick and easy way but a delicious one too.  I like broccoli with a little crunch left in it, so this was perfect.  The red pepper added the right amount of heat.  I used fresh broccoli and added a little garlic powder.

This was great! my husband and I love spice, so we doubled up on the red pepper flakes, and I also added a clove of minced garlic. I will definitely make this again! I ended up cooking it a bit longer since I used fresh broccoli, so it needed to cook through longer than what the directions suggested. Thanks for sharing the recipe!

As is this recipe has some potential but the Broccoli would have been bland. I added salt, pepper, minced garlic and a heavy amount of Mrs. Dash. This turned out ok but nothing to write home about.

I think I'll stick to steaming the broccoli.  I didn't see anything special about this and won't be making it this way again.

This is an easy way to cook broccoli.  It was good- nothing special but I will likely make it again b/c we like spicy and it is healthy.  I only used 1/2 TB olive oil to cut down on calories.

My 6 yr old son loves broccoli. I usually steam it and decided to try this, without the red peppers for him. He said it's the best broccoli he has ever had. It was very good, a new fav.

I have never fried broccoli in my life ... boy, did I miss out! This was unbelievably good. I don't know what I was expecting but it certainly wasn't anything as good as this. Who would have thought that 3 simple ingredients, along with a little salt would taste so darn good? I did use lightly steamed, fresh broccoli and I threw in a little crushed garlic with the pepper flakes. I really disliked frozen broccoli until I tried it with this recipe. It's a nice alternative when fresh broccoli is priced so high in the off season. I just love allrecipes and all the great cooks here. Thank you!

This was SENSATIONAL! My modifications: add a little minced garlic when you add the broccoli. I used the jarred kind. My sister-in-law tried this recipe after I raved about it. She used a broccoli/cauliflower mixture and said it was great!

This was an AWESOME side dish to have.  I added minced garlic to the oil and red pepper flakes but otherwise followed the recipe.  We loved it!  I will say that I would maybe cut down on the red pepper flakes if serving to kids.  It was a little too spicy for my 3yr old.  My husband loved it and doesn't want to eat broccoli any other way!

Delicious! I did change it, and added butter and a few splashes of soy sauce, and it was yummy. I let the broccoli cook until come of the pieces got the crispy crust, and it made it amazing.  Served them when company came over, and they declared it to be the "best broccoli ever!". I'd say that's a good recipe!

This was great!  Mine didn't get crispy, probably because the broccoli wasn't dry enough.  Next time I'll let it sit out longer or maybe put it in the salad spinner.

More like "sauteed broccoli." I left out the red pepper flakes since my husband likes to spice his stuff WAY up and my kids don't want any spice at all. I used fresh crushed black pepper and jarred minced garlic. Don't think I'll make broccoli any other way from now on!

I used fresh broccoli and the amt of red pepper listed in the recipe and did not notice a strong red pepper flavor (and I'm not a big red pepper fan).  The only change I made is I added 1 Tbsp Margarine to the pan at the end of cooking and stirred it until the margarine was melted and coated the broccoli. It gave just a little more flavor without adding a lot of calories. It was really tasty (for broccoli), my husband liked it too, definitely better than the normal steamed/boiled method.

Great!  I used garlic salt instead of regular, a bit more red pepper flakes, and black pepper too.  Also, pre-cooked the broccoli in boiling water for just a few minutes.

I was looking for something more interesting to do with broccoli and this recipe did the trick.  I used fresh broccoli, chopped onion, chopped garlic, salt and black pepper.  Thank you for a simple but delicious recipe!

Try with bacon grease...  awesome... I lost alot of weight low-carb using this type of recipe- olive oil is healthier and doesn't add a lot of calories...  but lots of flavor!!!!!!

Good, made exactly as stated, but a little too much of a kick to it, and I love spicy foods...a little less red pepper next time, there is nothing to counter-balance it, so it just comes off as too spicy. Loved texture of broccoli though.

Fried Broccoli Haiku: "Used fresh broccoli, but followed the rest the same. Surprise! It was good!" I typically steam my broccoli w/ a little salt and pepper and butter, nothing fancy, but this recipe grabbed me as just something different to do, and while I swapped frozen for fresh (one of those 12 oz. pre-cut bags) I didn't change anything else and ended up really enjoying this way of eating broccoli. I think next time though, I'd add some crushed garlic to the olive oil, and maybe some grated parmesan at the table.

Really easy and spicey, if that's the taste your looking for.  I too added bacon grease and a few bacon bits.  But it was just alittle too hot for me so I'll  use just a sprinkle of red pepper flakes next time. It just depends on how hot you like it. I will make this again!

I thought it was a delicious dish and thanks for this great idea!  I made a couple of variations just for my  own tastes.....I used fresh broccoli and added some chopped garlic to the peppers and tossed.  Finished it off with a few drops of sesame oil.   Yum.

I'll admit, I was skeptical about this, and how it could taste any better than steamed broccoli.  But it does!  I used the florets that were smaller, for soup, so the frying time didn't take as long, and I didn't use as much of the red pepper flakes, and it was delicious. I'll always make broccoli this way from now on.

I tried it with fresh broccoli. I cooked it first in the microwave with a bit of water and then put it in the pan with the oil and a bit of spread. I did cook it longer than the suggested time, however it didn't get crispy. There may have been too much moisture in the pan. The flavor however was great. I too, added a clove of garlic the last few minutes of cooking. Next time if I use fresh broccoli I think I may not precook it, but instead add a bit of water to the pan to get it crispy.

A great way to dress up frozen broccoli.  flavorful but caution, you should like spicy food!  We will lay off the crushed red pepper next time, and maybe add a few garlic cloves next time.  It was very spicy this time but I think we may have added too much.  Good recipe!

this is a fantastic recipe and so quick and easy but seems like it took so much more effort. I sadly could not make the recipe as directed due to an allergy to the red pepper flakes so instead I used fresh ground black pepper and a dash of marjoram to compliment the rest of the meal. After I cooked it I sprinked a lil parmesan cheese over it and served it even my three yr old and two yr old loved it that way!

What a super way to make broccoli. I found this super easy and not to mention extremely flavorful. I used frozen broccoli along with frozen chopped assorted bell peppers, steamed them for 5 min, then drained water and prepared as below in the oil, the red pepper flakes in addition to the peppers in it gave it a kick. My boyfriend asked for it again tonight! Super!

I did decrease the red pepper flakes for kids sake. Really tasty and different texture compared to the same old boiled or steamed frozen broccoli. Served with "Fresh Pea Soup," "Italian Peas," "Ham and Cheese Bowties," "Pumpkin Seed Beer Brittle," and "Hot Toddy."

Quick & easy but very similar to another one I have using Cajun spice.  You don't get the bloated, gas feeling when the broccoli is fried I think.

I made this for an afternoon snack for my 3 grandbabies and they gobbled it up.  Not one piece left.  I used fresh broccoli.  Huge hit and will be making this for snacks often.

I was a bit curious why such a simple broccoli recipe was causing such rave reviews but I get it now. This was delish. We took some other reviewers advice and added some garlic to the oil and pepper. We also used black pepper out if considerations for the 4 yr old and the one year old. Fried it up and whamo it was done. My 4 year old not only ate it up but asked for seconds! There was none left however so my hubs quickly whipped up another batch. Which also disappeared as quickly as the first. All told we made four batches of this stuff and prob would have made more but we were completely out of broccoli.  So this is a thumbs up as far as I'm concerned!

I love all my veggies done this way only to save the cook top I use a foil lined cookie sheet. Drizzle EVO and spices to taste and bake 375 for your choice tenderness. from 20 to 40 minutes. Brussel sprouts have never been better and asparagus well that will just knock your socks off! SOOO good. Thanks for a well loved recipe.For sweet potatoes give them a bit of softening , then peel and slice and either grill or bake ! Haven`t fried them yet but will!

I've made this for as long as I can remember. I always use 3 cloves of garlic but of course every green in our house is sautéed with  olive oil and garlic.

OMG!!! I love this recipe. I used fresh broccoli, butter and olive oil. Plus added minced fresh garlic about a minute before it was done. I also used Creole seasoning. It turned out great. I will make my broccoli like this from now on.

Made this as stated except that I used fresh broccoli.  A great side dish.  The spiciness is easily adjusted depending on who will be eating.

This was very good! I'm not much of a vegetable person, but am trying to do better. I had been dissatisfied with how frozen broccoli turned out after being heated, but this recipe kept it crispier and bright.

this tasted okay... but I did add diced garlic and garlic powder. And... I had trouble just pan-frying this, maybe because I used fresh broccoli. Anyways, I had to add some water to the pan and cover to steam the broccoli. Don't think I'd make this again, wasn't thrilled with the taste.

This is nice and flavorful. Just make sure you are careful with the portion for the red pepper. I added too much once and the odor was so powerful I had to leave the kitchen.

Very good. Instead of “fried”, I would describe this recipe as pan roasted. I used fresh broccoli and I added fresh minced garlic for the last few minutes per another reviewer’s recommendation. This recipe is now my “go to” recipe for cooked broccoli.

This was great but I used fresh broccoli olive oil with some butter to sauté.  Let the broccoli cook longer so it had a bit of a char. Very tasty.

My daughter won’t eat it because I used the red peppers next time I’ll remember to add them to mine after serving.   I followed the recipe and just added minced garlic and some orange bell pepper.   It’s not my first time making this recipe but it’s my first photo lol

This was so quick and easy! Modified a bit by using ghee (clarified butter). Sautéed chopped onions and garlic, seasoned with dash of sea salt, black pepper and red chili flakes. Then added a teaspoon of low sodium soy sauce. Hubby loved it too. Yum!

This is a good change from boiled broccoli  that delivers a lot of flavor in a healthy way. Frying the broccoli seemed to make it taste sweeter.  When I made it the second time I used butter flavored olive oil  (mail order from the smiling olive). I used fresh ground black pepper instead of the red pepper flakes, and used a  salt free spice blend instead of salt.  We liked this too. My vegetable hater cleaned his plate!

I used fresh broccoli and added some fresh mushrooms while cooking.  My husband and I really liked it.  I will be making it again!  I think next time I will add some grated cheese, as others suggested.

Tossed broccoli with coconut oil, salt, pepper, garlic powder and hot pepper flakes and broiled on low for 15 minutes, then broiled on high until edges browned.  It was delicious!

Have made my broccoli like this for years.Try adding some onions and garlic. Maybe fresh mushrooms.   So good!  I use this same recipe for fresh green beans .  They are so crisp and flavorful and I hate boiled green beans..  I suppose it would work for cauliflower too or just about any vegetable.   mj

Why would you need to rinse and pat dry frozen broccoli? I prefer fresh, but frozen florets will work in a pinch, And I do it in the oven with garlic and refined coconut oil, much more healthful and same great taste but much easier.

I used fresh broccoli instead of frozen. Other than that, I followed the recipe as written.  It was very good, but we found it way too spicy and my husband and I both like spicy food. I would make it again, but would cut down on the red pepper by half or even less than half.

I wasn't sure about this recipe but I didn't have a lot of time to prepare supper so I thought I would give it a try.  I was pleasantly surprised with how good this tasted. It's easy to put together so it's a keeper.

this was fantastic but I made a pretty drastic change. I used olive oil and sesame oil for some drama. I also slice some garlic and tossed in. Highly recommend doing this if you're a sesame/garlic oil lover.

Easy and delicious as written except I used fresh broccoli. Nice kick from pepper flakes; added salt and pepper at end.  Put lid on to help it cook through - still nice and crisp.  Took 10-15  minutes.

This is our new go-to broccoli. First tried it two months ago. I didn't have red pepper flakes so I chopped red pepper. Fabulous!  Tonight I'm going to do the same thing with fresh green beans. Can't wait!

Loved the red pepper ingredients! Used fresh broccoli, so after the frying process, added some water and a lid to the pan to steam it for a little more cooked broccoli. Husband loved it!

I used fresh broccoli because that's what I had and it was great. It is crunchy with fresh broccoli. I imagine it would be softer with frozen. This is a good, easy and basic recipe.

I used fresh broccoli and added some butter to the olive oil. Having made it before, I tried adding a little fresh lemon juice this time but found I liked it better without it. Garlic would go good here; too lazy to chop fresh, I added some powder. Easy and good recipe...thanks!

quite good, very tasty (I also added crushed garlic, like other reviewers) but be forewarned, this is spicy with the 1/2 tsp of crushed red pepper flakes. You can probably cut that amount in half and still have a great flavor without all the heat!

Awesome! Only thing I changed was I used fresh broccoli (what I had on hand). Can't wait to try it with the frozen too.

I love this recipe. I use fresh broccoli instead of frozen and microwaved it for a bit before stir frying. I also used some cauliflower and did the same thing. I've prepared this twice now and will continue to use this recipe.

Loved it.  Used fresh broccoli.  The second time I added chopped garlic and chopped onion.  Next time I may add grated Parmesan cheese. Thanks.

I'm not a fan of olive oil so I wasn't sure about this recipe but it's delicious! So simple yet it makes such a difference in the taste. Will definitely be keeping this recipe in my recipe box. No changes needed.

I didn't expect it to be that good cause it was too easy, lol.
I didn't use red pepper flakes but it was still good.
I never liked frozen broccoli but this recipe changed my mind, thanks!

Why do people buy frozen in the States? What is wrong with fresh? I used fresh and the recipe was delicious. I used Garlic, and Maldon Salt.

Fairly good. Too much red pepper. I tried 1/4 tsp and was still too much. Other than that, I would use the recipe again!

One of my favorite broccoli recipes.  The only thing I do different is use fresh broccoli and saute until it's done.  On occasion, I will sprinkle with a tiny bit of feta cheese.  YUM!

I just made this dish. Its really good! I used fresh broccoli but it was perfect at the 7 minutes in the recipe. Added a bit of garlic for the last minute. Definitely a keeper. Thanks so much for the recipe!

I had a broccoli recipe very similar to this and lost it, so thanks so much for the post & confirming my recollections of the process. In my book this is the best broccoli ever with fresh. Will have to try the frozen variety now.

Simple, quick, healthy and good - right up my alley.  I used broccoli florets, and drizzled / tossed with a little sesame oil at the end.

I never cook canned vegetables, only fresh or frozen.  I tried this once, and I've never cooked frozen broccoli any other way since.  As a matter of fact, I cook all of my frozen vegetables this way, switching out seasonings for whatever I'm in the mood for.  This method definitely keeps the crispness and freshness to it.

Three out of the three people I fed this too wandered back into the kitchen for more, and were sorely disappointed that it was gone.  A ringing endorsement, especially for a vegetable!  I followed this exactly, only I did use fresh broccoli.  Quick, easy and different from the norm.  Great recipe  :)

I made this for dinner tonight using fresh broccoli and just loved it!!  I added six or seven chunky-sliced mushrooms just because I had them and some chopped garlic just because I love garlic.  It took about ten minutes to completely fry, but I would do this again.

Oh my gosh!!! SO GOOD! I will always do broccoli this way. I added garlic,  onion powder, and paprika.  I also  squeezed the broccoli quite a bit to get as much water out as I could. Man, it was great!

This is a tasty way to cook broccoli although I had to put the lid on my pan to steam it after it was browned. I don't think it would have cooked through otherwise. :o)
