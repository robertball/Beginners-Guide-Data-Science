I used fresh broccoli with a very good result.  I cut the amount of cream cheese in half (and used lowfat) and added some shredded cheddar cheese.  I also added about 1/2 tsp. garlic salt to the cheese sauce.  I didn't bother putting any cracker crumbs on the bottom of the pan, only the top.  Really good!

I initially made this recipe on Thanksgiving, only I didn't have any cream cheese, so I used a half a cup of shredded sharp cheddar instead.  My husband and I loved it!  It was the best broccoli casserole I had ever had.  I remembered it for Christmas, and this time, I used cream cheese.  Well, it was thick and creamy, but tasted bland.  I would recommend replacing the cream cheese with cheddar cheese.  If you decide not to, though, just made sure you have the salt on hand!  Thank you very much for sharing this recipe.  I will definitely use it again, just not with the cream cheese.

We loved this recipe! For those that thought it was bland...it's cream cheese!  If you want something with an Alfredo flavor, buy Alfredo sauce...hmmm...not a bad idea!  Anyway, we made this, and it was a huge hit.  

Needed some salt, pepper, and garlic because it is a plain cream cheese flavor, but it's something so different from the normal brocc & cheese, and we loved it!  

We used Town House crackers, and while the crust part of it was soggy, it still added wonderful flavor, and I used a bit more than the recipe called for, and really covered the top of it. Then I sprinkled a bit of Lawry's Seasoned salt and just a tiny bit of freshly grated parmesan cheese on the top.  

Also, because we like crispy broccoli, I boiled the broccoli for only a few minutes, and it was still a crisp tender, even after the baking.  

We'll make it again!

Awesome recipe!! I added some shredded cheddar cheese to the sauce. I also did a mix of broccoli and cauliflower. I'm going to try using the sauce to make a seafood au gratin, with scallops, shrimp, crab etc. I think it would be great. You've got to try this!!!

This was really runny when still hot and after sitting out for awhile began to become more solid.  So, don't plan on serving it as soon as it comes out of the oven.  The taste was wonderful and everyone loved it!

This is sensational!  After reading a few reviewers comments, I decided to use fresh parboiled broccoli, 1 clove of fresh garlic sauted in the butter, and doubled the amount of salt called for.  Added 1/4 tsp of freshly ground black pepper and instead of 2 cups of milk, used 1 and 1/3.  Oh, and fresh breadcrumbs instead of the cracker crumbs and only on top.  Anyway, I guess I changed things up a bit.  Nonetheless, this was SENSATIONAL.

Terrific teriffic (no...not a typo) recipe. Instead of 2 cups milk, I used one cup of heavy whipping cream and one cup of whole milk. And because I had a box of Special K Multi-grain crackers in the pantry, I Cuisinarted (work with me here...) and used those as opposed to what the recipe suggested. This recipe surpassed our expectations! Trusty lovely dish.

Great change from the usual processed cheese and rice casserole.  I used lite cream cheese and added garlic, onion powder and pepper to the sauce.  When the sauce thickened, I tossed in about 1/4 cup of grated parmesan.  Really, really good-thanks!

Loved this recipe, so did my dinner guests. The only thing I did different was I used fresh broccoli instead of frozen and I cooked it just until tender because it cooks more in the oven

This was really good!  After reading some of the comments, I decided to add some fresh garlic and cheddar cheese to the recipe.  I only had corn flake crumbs on hand, but I'm looking forward to trying it with the butter crackers - yum! 

My father, who doesn't like "green stuff," as he puts it, and my 20 month old daughter both gobbled it up! Thanks for sharing - I will be making this again.

I noticed how many suggested cutting back on the cream cheese but I went for it, I used the entire amount it calls for only because I was planning on using a 9x13 dish.  Turned out rather well.  I added a small caramelized red onion into the broccoli mixture and it also turned out great.  I'll make this again but not too often as it's not the healthiest way to serve up broccoli.

This was excellent! I also added chicken to it so it was more of the main dish. I served it with some buiscuts and honey butter and some peaches. Gooooood!

This was GREAT! Since so many people were saying it was bland I added some dried onions, mushrooms, garlic and onion powder, accent, and ground pepper. My husband loved it! Plus the sauce is great for so much more.

I made this nearly exactly as it was written; I just added a little bit of onion and garlic powder to the sauce, because I was afraid it would be bland. I was fairly impressed with the recipe, but my kids gobbled it up like it was going out of style! They loved it! I think next time I make it I'll either double the broccoli or add a package of macaroni noodles and add some cheddar cheese to the sauce. All in all this is a pretty good recipe on its own, but also a very excellent base for expansion.

This was really good.  It makes a lot of sauce for 16 oz. of broccoli, though, so I doubled the broccoli.  I added 1/4 tsp. onion powder to the sauce and 1/4 cup freshly grated parmesan and it really makes a difference.  I then sprinkled some more parmesan across the top along with the crushed crackers before baking.  Excellent!

I converted this recipe to be gluten free - used gluten free flour and substituted crushed potato chips for the topping. I also used goat cheese instead of cream cheese, sauteed 3 shallots and 3 cloves of garlic, added fines herbes and used fresh broccoli. It was delightful, delicious and gluten free, a treat for me!

Very good.  Even hubby, who says he doesn't like anything with cream cheese in it, loved it.  I also added chopped onion, garlic and seasoning salt.  Thanks for a great recipe.

I really modified this, but it’s a good starter recipe. I made a complete meal by adding 3 cups of cooked instant rice and 1lb. of cubed cooked chicken. I did add 2 cups extra sharp cheddar and garlic powder, and extra salt and pepper. I added some onions too. I also used Neufchatel cheese instead of Cream Cheese because I had some. Neufchatel is almost just like cream cheese and is sold in most supermarkets right along side of the cream cheese. It’s usually marketed as “1/3 Less Fat THAN Cream Cheese”. It’s the same price as the cream cheese and the same shape box. The Neufchatel identifying word is usually in little letters on the box. I have another broccoli, rice, chicken, casserole recipe that I prefer, that uses Velveeta and sharp cheddar. That recipe uses F. F. Onions for topping instead of the crackers. But I had the stuff for this version and it wasn’t half bad, but I like the other recipe better. This was better the next day.  The 2 cups of milk seemed excessive. I can’t imagine how much sauce this would have made had I not added all the extras that I did!

I used one large bunch of fresh broccoli, steamed, a bit more salt, some pepper, 1/4 tsp. each of ground thyme and ground rosemary, and I didn't have buttery crackers so I used saltines.  It turned out great.  A wonderful potluck dish.  Thanks for the recipe!

I have often made this as "snack mom".  Sometimes the babes will eat it and sometimes they eat nothing.  However, I tried to get vegies into those tiny bodies!  Let me just say, that the teachers LOVE this dish.  I make double  so they can gobble too -- and they passed the recipe around!  This recipe for adults is a pure 5 star.  For kids, well, it depends on the crowd, I guess!  I will keep trying with the kids.

I've made this a few times now and found that we like it the best when I add in lots of minced garlic, some dried minced onion, and a little freshly cracked pepper.  Also I omitted the cracker crumbs and just topped with bread crumbs and a sprinkle of grated parmesan.

Good. Not Great.  Followed recipe.  Next time I will cut back on the cream cheese...Too much for me.  I'll add cheddar cheese & some spices next time.  I'll also put melted butter over the Ritz crackers on top.  MAYBE even use french fried onions!!!

Very good.  Instead of crackers, I used half a box of stove top on bottom & top.  Gave the dish more flavor.  Will definitely make again.

I  tried this recipe with half of the cream cheese, and replaced the rest with sharp cheddar.  The next time I will just use all cheddar.

I was looking for a recipe close to a resturant i love... this wasn't it. This was good, but too much cream cheese for my taste.

This is a very good recipe. I made it to take to Easter dinner yesterday and it went over very well. I used fresh, steamed broccoli and added a good amount of garlic powder, which went very well with the cream cheese sauce.  I added a few more spices from my cupboard, but I don’t remember which ones. I will definitely try this recipe again.

If you're lactose intolerant, this recipe is not for you.  I increased the salt to 1/2 tsp of kosher salt and added onion flakes and dill to the cream sauce before adding the broccoli.  I also substituted a pie crust instead of the cracker crumbs.  It makes a nicer presentation, and easier to serve. My son, the one who doesn't eat ANYTHING green loved it!

Great tasting and quite easy.  Leftovers taste just as good as fresh.  Sauce is wonderfully creamy and the crackers give it some texture.

I thought it was very good.  My husband said there was a little too much "creamy white sauce" for his liking, so next time I might cut back on the cream cheese or add more broccoli.

I cut the cream cheese in half and it was still too much cream for the amount of broccoli, in my opinion. It was just okay - but a good way to use ingredients on hand.

Excellent! This recipe has a comfort food quality to it that I did not expect. I used 3 oz. of cream cheese and 1/2 C. each grated parmesan and shredded sharp cheddar cheese. Next time I'll make a dounle batch.

Very creamy!  I took the advice of some of the others who tried this recipe, and added both garlic and onion powder, as well as some cheddar cheese.  It turned out well.  I will probably cut out more of the cream cheese next time...but there will be a next time.

This was really yummy! Because of other reviews claiming it was bland I used garlic & herb cream cream and it had such a good flavor. I didn't put crackers on the bottom , but used vegetable thins crackers and shredded cheese on top (Which made a nice crust) 
I used fresh broccoli so that I'd only have the heads and not the other chunks that come in the frozen vegetable packs. Also , made sure to save some for the next day because it is soo good cold! I put enough away for my husband and I the next day and he was lucky to get a bite!

This was ok.  I thought there was way too many breadcrumbs.  Also, I used sharp white cheddar cheese instead of cream cheese.  The flavor was just overpowered by the breadcrumbs.  Next time I will use 1/2 the amount and put them just on the top.

This was pretty good. I also added 1/4 tsp black pepper, DEFINITELY NEEDED IT! I only put crackers on top and used less cream cheese and it was enough. I thawed my frozen broccoli and did not steam it.  I just added it to the mix and it cooked fine in the oven.

I liked this okay, but vegetables shouldn't make you feel guilty.  It was creamy and fattening I am sure.  I added fresh garlic, but some pepper would have helped.  I like the fact that you can add your own flavor...but do add.  My husband loved it, but said not to make it again due to health guilt.  It would be fine for a work party or a special occasion

I didn't think it needed the cracker crumbs on the bottom of the pan.  This was very creamy and tasty but a little bland - I think next time we'll add some garlic powder or Italian seasoning or some cheddar cheese.

AWESOME!!! I did add shredded sharp cheddar cheese to the top before I put the crackers on it! I also added some of the same cheese over the top and baked for a few more minutes before letting it cool!! We liked this so much, I think we just found our new Broccoli Casserole for Holiday menus!!

This is very similar to what I've been making for years. The only difference is instead of flour, milk and butter mixed with cream cheese,  I use a can of cream of broccoli soup and a 1/2 cup of the broccoli broth with the cream cheese. Mix over med heat in saucepan until cream cheese melts. I also use better cheddar crackers instead of ritz crackers.

I made this for an Easter potluck with co-workers and it was a big hit (nothing left but an empty dish at the end of the dinner)! I did tweek the recipe though. I used half the amount of cream cheese and added two cups of sharp cheddar cheese. I also used a mixture of butter and celery salt with the cracker crust to prevent burning of the crackers (also I put the casserole lid on so it didn't dry out during baking). If you think it's going to be bland then add spices and add a bold cheese or flavored cream cheese to make it have a little extra kick--I used minced onion, celery salt, basil and sharp cheddar.

This was delicious!!  Creamy, mild & wonderful; you taste the broccoli - so... if you don't like broccoli, you probably won't like this dish - then again you just may :)  We love broccoli and thought this dish was great.  I followed the proportions exactly and scaled up to be able to use a large bag of frozen broccoli from the warehouse club as I was bringing it to a party.  Everyone loved it and my husband who really doesn't like any creamy type dishes even thought it was OK.  He suggested that next time I add some grated parmesan or romano cheese and I will try that and post an update sometime soon.  Thanks for an easy & elegant casserole recipe!

Looking at the recipe, I thought it may be a little bland for my liking as well. My adaptation includes: Sauteed one small onion and 3 cloves of garlic, thinly sliced, with the butter. When onion and garlic was a light golden color, I splashed a little white wine in, pepper, coarse sea salt, and some parsley. I let that saute for about 30 seconds or so and added flour with a wisk.  Per recipe, I whisked in the milk, turned down the heat a bit and whisked until bubbly and thick. I then added the cream cheese and an Italian mix of cheese, about a cup or so, and continued to stir until all cheeses were well blended into the sauce.  I did not cook my broccoli because I like it crisp. Tossed everything together and layed it out in a large casserole. Topped with parmesean, a light dusting of pepper and sea salt, and bread crumbs. Delicious! Thank you for the base recipe!

Loved the recipe.  A few changes I made was that I replaced the crackers mentioned with ritz crackers crushed only on top and I added shredded cheddar cheese to booste the bland flavor a bit.  In the past I have used velveeta cheese as well.  Very good!!

We fixed this recipe for dinner tonight to see if it is something we want to fix for Thanksgiving. It was GREAT! We took some advice from a few others and I put my own "zing" to it. While getting the butter ready for the sauce, I added a few small cloves of garlic and sauted them before adding the flour and milk. While the sauce was cooking, I added some pepper and garlic salt. Instead of steaming my own broccoli, I got two 12 ounce pkgs of the type of frozen broccoli you can steam in the bag...easy to find at Wal Mart. Both packages were the perfect amount for the recipe. Other than those couple of things...it was perfect and very, very close to what you get at Cheddars. Yummy!!! Our advice is TRY IT!! :) As I am typing this, my husband is going back for more!!

Very good!  I took the advice of some others who left comments and combined 2 cloves of garlic with about a fourth cup of onion to be sauteed in the butter. This gave the dish just enough flavor to be quite tasty!  I also wound up using fresh parboiled broccoli and 1 cup of milk.

I tried the recipe but instead of cream cheese I used cheddar cheese. I also used Ritz crackers and added extra cheese on top for the last 2 mins of baking. It turned out great!! I also used fresh broccoli and par-boiled it first.

As is, this is a nice base recipe to jump off with. After making the sauce to recipe, I didn't like the full taste of cream cheese. After adding some Crackerbarrel shredded white cheddar, a little more milk and some hot sauce, it was much better. As I said, nice base recipe. When the casserole bakes, the flavors all come together in a very flattering way. Thanks for posting the use of cream cheese.

I thought this recipe was fantastic.  I loved the idea of using cream cheese along with milk instead of the old traditional cheddar and condensed soup.  The only thing I did different was added a few of my favorite herbs and spices.  This was great because you can really make it your own by adding more flavor!!

I loved this recipe, I made it for a family get together and everyone fought about who got to take home the left overs! Only thing is I did add more crackers, about double.  Will make again for sure!  Thanks for sharing this.

This was good, but nothing spectacular. I would make it again, though. I might add some garlic powder next time, like other reviewers did. I think that would make a nice addition.

this recipe was a big hit with my family and friends for our Christmas Eve dinner.  I did add minced onion, garlic powder, onion powder and salt/pepper to the cheese sauce to add some flavor.  The cream cheese has a tendancy to be a little bland and it turned out really good.  Thinking about trying this with some sauted chicken and maybe mushrooms  mixed in..

I made this for a potluck. I used fresh broccoli cut into small pieces and microwaved. I made a bit of extra sauce and so I diced three small potatoes into very small pieces (1 square cm). Yes, it became very solid after refrigeration, but a few minutes in the microwave made it better. The crackers never got soggy, and never turned brown in the oven when i had to leave it in for an extra thirty minutes since the broccoli and potatoes weren't soft yet. I also added small chunks of sharp cheddar cheese and much more salt than was called for for flavor.

This was okay.  I added some garlic salt and pepper, but it still needed something else for more flavor.  I may make it again and add some cheddar cheese and definitely more spices.

This was good but it definitely did NOT make 8 servings, unless you consider a serving to be 3 bites.  I liked it, but the flavor wasn't too strong.  I loved the crackers; they made the dish worth it.

I just made this casserole and it's really good. Amazing what you can do with so few ingredients. I added a bit of pepper and garlic and substituted half of the cream cheese for gouda. I loved the sauce! The only  strange thing here was that I had the recipe changed to 3 servings as I was just on my own and thought I could leave some for tomorrow. However, it wasn't very much and I ate it all on my own. I will make more next time I make this... Loved the sauce so much though!!

My whole family absolutely loved this recipe. I added some chicken to it and made it into a meal. They were excited to eat the leftovers for lunch the next day.

I made this during the Christmas eve dinner and was really good and everyone loved it! Instead of using broccoli, I used while cauliflowers instead and I add the cauliflowers into the cheese mixture to cook as the veg will absorb the creamy sauce flavour. Also, I find it taste better if I add half of the biscuit crumbs to the sauce and top the remaining on top to bake instead of placing at the bottom of the casserole. Will definately bake it again as this dish will suit Asian taste!

I made this to take to a family dinner and it went over well with a picky bunch!  I made it with 4 ounces of cream cheese and 4 ounces of velveeta.  I also left the crackers off the bottom.  I will definitely be making it again.

I think this is perfect for a side dish, but when I made it I had it as the main meal and cooked rice on the side.  It is so yummy.  I added chopped onion and I am glad I did.  It has a different taste due to the cream cheese, but its very good.  I will make this again soon!!!

This was a really good alternative to the regular Broccoli and cheese side dish. The cream cheese gives it a really interesting but yummy taste.  My family loved it.

I really liked this, but next time, I will only put a half cup of crackers on the top and none on the bottom. I felt like a cup was a little much, and the ones on the bottom got soggy. Other than that, a little salt and pepper, and you have a great side dish!

Good texture, but bland!  Definitely needs more spices!!   I didn't think this was the worth the calories.  I added tons of garlic and italian seasons and still thought it needed some extra kick.  Won't be making again....

I get requests all the time to bring this dish for holidays, etc.  I had to double it so everyone could get enough.  Some reviews say it is bland...well it is a cream cheese/white sauce.  I do add some garlic salt to the sauce.  Good stuff!

I made this with a broccoli/cauliflower/carrot/squash blend. I used 2 lbs, so I added about 1-1/2 cups of shredded cheddar to the sauce, along with about a 1/2 tsp each of thyme, onion powder, and garlic powder. The flavor was pretty good, but it was a bit too rich. I think it would be really good with cooked chicken or turkey mixed in.

This is a very nice brocolli casserole. The sauce is rich and creamy. I did add a little more salt and a dash of black pepper. My daughter and I enjoyed it very much. I will make this again. Thanks for the recipe.

This was very delicious. I took the advice of one reviewer and substituted 2 c. shredded cheddar cheese for the cream cheese. The sauce ended up being the best part of the dish.

It didn't really taste all that good to me.   Really what the dish lacked was taste.  I tasted the broccoli fine, it was just overall bland.  Maybe with some other seasonings it would be better.  More than just salt or pepper.

After all the reviews about kids liking this I thought I had a winner - but not at my house.  Even my completely easy eater didn't like it.  My husband and my oldest daughter (17) said they didn't think the flavors of the sauce and the crust went together at all.  I have to admit that it wasn't a favorite of mine either.

Wow! Truly a surprise. Smooth, creamy and delicate in flavor, this is a special broccoli casserole.  

I served it with Bisquick chicken and some buttered noodles. Enjoy.

Very good.  I have been looking for a good broccoli casserole without rice.  Next time I want to add cauliflower too.

Everyone loved this!   I used 2 (12.5 oz) bags of Birdseye Baby Broccoli Florets and 6oz of the cream cheese  & it seemed like there was too much liquid but the end result was perfect.  I liked that you could taste the broccoli.   A nice creamy broccoli & it tasted even better the next day..

This is similar to a recipe a friend of mine used to make. Except I sautéed some onion and added some cheddar cheese. And a bit of garlic. As a few have said, it’s a bit bland as is (but it is milk, cream cheese and broccoli, so not sure how it wouldn’t be). Each’s own.  You could also add some red pepper or Italian seasoning or even curry.  Bland recipes are like a blank canvas, you need to add your artwork!! Cheers!

We did like this, however the noodles in the bottom were dry.  When making this again, I will make extra sauce and pour some over each layer as I assemble it.  I did add some garlic for a little additional flavor.

So I didn't have the ingredients for green bean casserole so I found this recipe. I was nervous, but my family loved this! The only thing I changed was that I added sharp cheddar to the mix and topped it off. I will definitely make this again.

This recipe was great! But, I did add a half cup cheddar cheese to mix and then sprinkled more on top then covered with seasoned bread crumbs instead since I didn't have any buttery crackers on hand. I also added a bit more seasoning for flavor . My husband and our guest loved it!!  Will definitely make again!

I made this as is and my family loves it. It tastes very light, and the cream cheese truly makes this dish delicious. A nice option to enjoy broccoli with a little more flavor, and a good side dish for a potluck.

Ive made this several times now and it's always a hit! Although, I do add a bag of shredded cheese and extra seasoning salt. Im a BIG cheese fan! You can never have too much cheese! I also use the California Blend veggies. (Cauliflower, Broccoli and Carrots) I'm only giving this 4 stars because of my alterations. Either way, it's still a great recipe! Most of the veggie casseroles Iv'e seen have rice in them. The hubby is (unfortunately) not a rice fan!

It was amazing.  I also cut up some squash we had from our garden and added it. I love color with my veggies. Might try zucchini next round.

Great recipe. I did make some changes though.  I sautéed the onions along with some garlic then added the broccoli until it just started to soften. I transferred  the broccoli to an over proof dish and tossed some grated parmesan on top before adding the sauce.  I then added a bit more parmesan before tossing it in the oven.  This added changes gave much more flavor to the dish.  Yummy!

Despite some of the bad reviews I decided to try this since I figured anything with cream cheese has to be pretty good. I was pleasantly suprised. My husband and I both thought this was pretty good. I did add a little more salt, some fresh ground pepper and some onion powder. Overall it is a "comfort food" and is a nice change from the chedder cheese broccoli casseroles.
