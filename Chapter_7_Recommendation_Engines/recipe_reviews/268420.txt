This recipe was so fast and so easy and so delicious!  I took the advice of another reviewer and only used half the recommended amount of red pepper flakes... it was the right amount of spice for us.  This recipe is going on our rotation for a quick dinner.

I always know when a recipe is a hit, when my husband has seconds. I didn't have any Mexican oregano, I will get some though to taste the difference, I used regular oregano, still good. my husband wants me to use some fish with the shrimp next time, might be interesting to see how it turns out... Thanks for sharing

This was so yummy!!! I  used my crock pot and let everything cook on high heat for about an hour. Then added the noodles and shrimp until the shrimp turned pink, about 10 mins additional. I also added black beans , and half of a white onion. Very easy to make. Already am planning to make this again.

I added onion and garlic and a teaspoon of cumin.

It was definitely spicy which I liked but a little hot for my wife.  You might want to cut back on the chili powder a bit to suit your taste.

Definitely will be making again.

I didn’t have Mexican oregano, so used marjoram. I also didn’t have a spiralizer, so  cut the zucchini in to match sticks sized pieces. It was very good and will make it again.

So easy and quick to make. Tasty with just the right amount of spice. You could always add more pepper flakes if you want more heat. I added diced avocado and a dollop of sour cream when served. A slice of crusty bread  and you have all you need.

This turned out good.  It was fast and very easy which makes for a great weeknight meal.  The only thing I had to do different was add another can of broth.  Otherwise this was not have been near enough soup or liquid.  I would make this again.

Fantastic! This comes together so quickly and is super flavorful. I topped it with crispy fried seas salt & lime poblano strips and jalapeño slices. If you're not a big fat of heat, cut back on the red pepper flakes. This would also be tasty with fire-roasted tomatoes. A keeper!
