The best muffins ever!  Easy, delicious, moist, and versatile.  They are pretty sticky, so I would say even if you use paper muffin cups, still use the cooking spray or you'll end up eating paper.  Awesome with margarine (or butter for non-vegans) and honey.

i made the batter to the instructions (except i used brown sugar instead of white) 
it was way too dry and was only going to fill 3 of my large muffin cups. so, with a batch of batter made, i added all the ingredients all over again (except the sugar) making a double batch. i added about half a cup of soy milk to combat the dryness.
i baked it in a loaf tin for about 30 mins, it turned out delish, and still very sweet with only half the amount of sugar.

Taste was ok but they were way too sweet. I'm sure 1/3 cup sugar would be more than enough. They're also too moist and sticky for my tastes.

These were terrific, gone in two days!  I'd been searching for a blueberry muffin recipe without oil or butter.  These were a little more like banana bread with blueberries, but they were nonetheless very yummy.  A keeper for me.

This recipe was way too dry. I added a couple tablespoons of water and 1/8 c. vegetable oil to make it pourable into the tin. I also added baking soda to make them rise a little more.

batter is WAY too dry-- had to add 1/2c applesauce to even make it 'stick'

incredible heavy & sticky--..

also took 30 min to bake & still never got 'golden brown'

I think oil & water is missing from this recipe...

These muffins were chewy and flat.  My family wouldn't eat them.  Maybe I did something wrong, but I've never had trouble making muffins before.

these muffins tasted pretty good, but they were really heavy.  I'll probably make them again...

Sorry, I did not care for these.  I came back and read the reviews and the last few seemed good, but i thought they were gooey and heavy.  I think they needed some coconut milk (or Soy Milk) maybe 1/2 cup.  Also, the flour, salt, baking powder should be mixed separate, then folded at the end?  The concept is good.... bananas with Blueberries, unfortunately, i think this is one of the reasons people stay away from Vegan recipes!

The batter was extremely dry and heavy! They came out very chewy and uncooked looking..not good. You will need to add either 1/2 cup of milk or juice to offset the dryness and maybe 1 tsp of baking powder instead of 1/2 tsp for them to fluff up.

I don't use egg replacer, so I used two large eggs. I made no other changes. My kids liked these okay, but didn't flip for them like they did the Health Nut Blueberry Muffins.

This worked out really well! I can't give 5 stars because I tweaked the recipe so I don't know what the original is like *exactly* but what I made was fine. Instead of the egg replacer I just used flax, water and a little oil, I used 3 bananas, some walnuts instead of blueberries, and added another 1/2 tsp baking powder along with the last scrape of applesauce I had leftover. I turned it into a loaf instead of muffins, but I was using a new silicone loaf pan (which I don't think I like) and it wasn't actually as done as I thought it was. But still tastes great! This is exactly what I wanted to find, I have been craving some banana-y bread.

I used regular whole wheat flour instead of whole wheat pastry flour. Indo not recommend this. The muffins were thick, heavy and kind of like a rubber ball.

This is a great base recipe. My sons allergic to eggs so I'm always on the search for good muffins.. Finally found it with some tweaks:) doubled the recipe and I used 1/12 cups of white bread flour, 1 cup of whole wheat flour, 1 tablespoon baking powder, 1 cup applesauce, 2 tbsp flaxseed /6 tbsp water (thickens as stands) added chocolate chips for a treat this time.. The jars half gone and my husband doesn't know there's whole wheat in there as he hates whole wheat

I liked the flavor of these muffins but the texture was dense and too gummy.  If I made these again I'd double the amount of baking powder and put less batter in the muffin cups to try to get a fluffier muffin.  I used very ripe large bananas so didn't find them dry.  Maybe the banana needs to be listed as an amount (e. g. 1 cup) as too little leads to dry muffins while too much makes them gummy.

We added blueberries which gave the muffins additional flavor. So moist and delicious!

Following the directions resulted in a pie crust rather than a batter.  So, I added an unsweetened plant based milk (approximately 1/2 cup) until it formed a batter.  Also, I mixed separately the dry ingredients and added cinnamon to them prior to mixing with wet ingredients.  The result was good but only after these modifications.

My roommate and I are dairy-free. Few things we substituted: coconut flour in place of both the all-purpose flour and whole wheat flour. Since neither of us are vegans, we substituted the egg replacer with one egg. We added more water than was in the recipe. The muffins tasted amazing, super crisp on the top and moist on the inside. Definitely will do this recipe again!

These muffins were the best! My blueberries sunk to the bottom though, but they were still amazing. I also added some cinnamon sugar on top in the middle of the baking process.  Extra yummy!!

Very good!  I doubled the recipe for all 7 of us and I had to change the recipe a little to suit our dietary needs...here is what I did to make our muffins gluten free/vegan. I used Bob's Red Mill g/f all purpose flour for the a/p four, and ground oats for wheat pastry flour, 3 ripe bananas (since many comments said batter was too dry and original doubled recipe called for 4), 1 cup of non dairy milk (I used soy), for egg replacer I used freshly ground flax seed (2tbl) with the 1/4c of water (let it sit till it gets thick and gels).  I also used organic cane sugar, but that doesn't affect taste.  These are very tasty...everyone loved them!  I will probably make more this weekend and freeze them to keep on hand for fast breakfasts.
