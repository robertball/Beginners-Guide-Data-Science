Awesome Recipe!!
My taste buds are still jumping from this delicious lasagna receipe. It cost me approximately close to 15.00 for all of its ingredients. If you are looking for something simple and easy to cook.. try simply lasagna.

This recipe is super easy.  The only thing I changed was what other people suggested:  I browned my beef with garlic and onions, and I had to use about half of another jar of spaghetti sauce.  I was also scared about not cooking the noodles but they turned out just fine!  I am not a big cook, and my boyfriend could not believe I made it! Will definitely use this recipe again!

I love not having to cook the noodles.  Mine always fall apart after boiling.

Very good and very easy.  Used the ready to cook noodles but there wasn't enough sauce to soften the top layer of noodles.  Next time I'll use the regular lasagna noodles.  The flavor was excellent and it came together easily.  Will definitely make again.

Making lasagna often seems to me like such an arduous task, but this lasagna was a snap to put together and I liked that the calorie/fat count wasn't excessive (although I was a little heavy handed with the mozzarella cheese, so I am not sure that mattered). I used freshly grated parmesan reggiano and a 32 ounce jar of Rao's marinara sauce. Next time, I would use even more sauce. This was good, I would make it again.

I made this last night for me and my husband and we both really liked it. I did double the Ricotta and add an extra can of sauce, a bit more mozzarella. I was very nervous about not cooking the noodles, but it turned out fine. Also, there is no way it can be 12 servings ~ with two of us there is only half a pan left! But it's very easy to make, even for beginners, it's economical (cost me around $12 for all the ingrediants) and I will definitely make this one again.

I just recently started to cook and this recipe was sooooo easy and soooo good!!! I let the ground beef and sauce simmer for about a half hour with some sauteed garlic and onions so all the flavors combined. It was awesome! Can't go wrong.

I'd been looking for a lasagna recipe that I didn't have to cook the noodles.  This one turned out great.  I jazzed it up abit and added onion, garlic and green pepper when I browned the meat.  The noodles came out nice and tender.

Great recipe! The only reason I gave 4 instead of 5 stars was that it was just a little bit dry. I will use another cup or two of sauce next time, and then I'm sure it will be perfect. My boyfriend devoured almost the entire pan by himself!

I catered lunch on Saturday for my work.  I made this, garlic bread and poke cake.  Everything was devoured!!  I only changed 2 things, I used Italian seasoning rather than the parsley...it's just what I had on hand and I used 2 parts ground beef and 1 part sausage.  I also tripled the batch.

This was super easy and pretty quick to assemble!Tasted great and after letting it set for awhile before serving, stays stacked and pretty. I made 2 8X8 casserole dishes of this, baked one immediately, then froze the other.For the freezer: let sauce be last layer,lay plastic wrap directly on sauce to make sure no air can get to it.If you freeze in glass dish, bring to room temperature before you bake or start it at 250 for 1/2 hour, then raise temp to 350 for 40 min or so.Put last layer of cheese on in the last 15 minutes. This is great to keep in freezer for the days you just don't feel like cooking!

This was delicious and sooo easy to make.  I used Ragu's Roasted Garlic sauce and I ended up using 2 jars because there just didn't seem to be enough and it came out perfect.  I added some italian seasoning to the beef while cooking and I think it added that little something.  This was my first time making lasagna and my fiance LOVED it.  Definitely a great recipe for first timers!!!

I thought this lasagne was so yummy.  I added an extra tin of tomato soup to make more sauce as the original recipe did not make enough for the size dish they said to use.  The best thing was not having to make the bechamel sauce.  It was very quick and easy to make.

Absolutely delicious! The only thing I changed was adding mild Italian sausage to the ground beef and cooking the two together. Considering that this made twice as much meat, I would double the amount of meat called for automatically in the future. Other then that, it was perfect!

I made this recipe for my family one Friday evening.  I think it was easy and did not take up much time to prepare.  The taste was great.  After reading the reviews I decided to add extra sauce and sprinkled a little extra cheese on my layers.  I also added some sharp cheddar cheese sprinkled to my layers and the top. I am a sauce and cheese person so it came out beautifully.  I wasn't too sure about not boiling the noodles but I just made sure the sauce was enough to cook the noodles.  This was a wonderful recipe I recommend it for all Lasagna beginners.

The taste was excellent, however there wasn't quite enough sauce and i had to add more water than specified to my sauce to cover my top layer of noodles. next time I  might cook the top layer half way before i add them. otherwise great recipe!

this recipe is perfect for anyone who thought lasagna would be too hard to make!  it can do with a bit of spicing up - panfry onions/garlic with the meat and add more fresh herbs to the ricotta mix - but it's brilliant.
there's no way you can stretch this to 12 people though...4-6 more like it!

Great recipe. There is NO WAY there was enough ricotta cheese mixture to make that  dish. I added one more 15 ounce can of ricotta and am VERY happy I did. When setting the pasta in there it looks like there isn't enough because of the gaps, but three pieces IS ENOUGH! I Promise. The Pasta expands A LOT! This recipe makes thin layers, and my family likes thick layers so we weren't able to make the required amount of layers, but this REALLY turned out great. If you double the ricotta cheese put a cookie sheet under the pan in the oven b/c the sauce overflowed just a little.

I was so excited to find a recipe that I didn't have to boil the noodles first. Keep in mind, that any noodles work, you don't have to buy the oven ready kind. AWESOME!! My husband was a little skeptical about not cookin them first (also, the home chef), but said that it was the best lasagna I'd ever made. Thanks. Will definetly make again.

I cooked my shells about half way through - a secret my mom taught me.  Otherwise followed recipe exactly and it wasn't too runny or too dry ~ just right!  Then I toasted some italian bread with garlic, parsley and butter to complete the meal.

Very easy and very tasty recipe.  I added about 8 ounces of feta cheese with the ricotta for more flavor. I also boil the noodles for about 5-6 minutes and let them finish cooking in the oven.  The lasagna is much easier to assemble with partially cooked noodles.

I have always been intimidated by Lasagna recipes. However, after watching the video that came with this recipe, I gain enough confidence to try it. Wow - it turned out great! My husband is not a big leftover eater, but he loved it so much he ate it for dinner, lunch & dinner again the next day. The only thing I would do differently is make more of the cheese mixture. Try this recipe if you want to impress your love ones!

I'm giving this 5 stars b/c of how easy it was and how good it turned out. This was my first time making lasagna, I was nervous about not cooking the noodles but they turned out perfect. I used cottage cheese and blended it instead of ricotta, otherwise I followed pretty closely to the recipe. However for personal taste I would like to add more tomatoes, sauce, perhaps mushrooms, green peppers next time. But for a first timer and a "simple" lasagna this was perfect. Thank-you very much for the recipe.

This lasagna is foolproof!!  I also use extra sauce and brown my ground beef with minced garlic and onion.  I also substitute lowfat cottage cheese in place of the ricotta (not a big fan).  I also soak the noodles in hot tap water for about 5 minutes and poor just a few drops of water all around the edges once it is put together (a tip from a "real chef").  This method makes for absolutely perfect tender noodles that still hold together just right!

I'm giving this 4 1/2 stars because it was a little dry. The reason it is dry is from the cheese mix (ricotta) this isn't runny, but forms clumps and I even spread it thinly but it bakes up dry. I think it would pay to add a cheese sauce layer over the ricotta mix or a tin of tomato puree to give the ricotta some moisture. The ricotta has an egg in it so it bakes semi-firm, no moisture, sort of dry which wrecks what could have been a fantastic recipe. Next time, I'll add a pkt cheese sauce or puree.

The lasagna was great. Made this for a gathering at my apartment and it was literally gone in no time at all. The video clip on the allrecipes site was very helpful because they make each step very clear and easy to follow. Note that when you add water to the meat and sauce, it's about half a jar of water. More than that would probably make it too watery. I also used about 1.5 lbs of ground beef. 1 lb wasn't enough. And I only used 2cups of mozzerella cheese which was more than enough. (the recipe calls for 2.5 cups)

Not bad! While I prefer my traditional lasagna recipe much better, as  a no-fuss alternative, this was perfectly suitable and really hit the spot! I've had a taste for lasagna lately, but didn't want to spend the cash or time to prepare my favorite one (I reserve it for special occasions). Not only was this a nice "welcome home" dinner for my husband (he's been out of town on a business trip), it was hearty, satisfying and a step above the ho-drum meals I usually prepare! As others have done, I too increased the amount of sauce (1.5 jars worth of my grocer's generic chunky marinara). I also added a small (chopped) onion and a minced garlic clove to my beef. My final change was to add my parsley to my meat mixture (after I browned / drained it) and a 9 oz. package of frozen (thawed), chopped spinach to my ricotta mixture instead. Since this makes a TON, I gave my in-laws 6 decent-sized squares to enjoy. Served with homemade garlic bread and a tossed salad, this was a great meal. Thanks Kraft! :-)

Yum! I think I left off a layer b/c my pan wasn't thick enough. I used 9 noodles. It fed a family of five in one sitting. I had no leftovers! I guess that meant they liked it. I did cook the meat with onion and garlic. I love how you don't have to cook the noodles. Great recipe!

Taste BUDS are singing...Minor changes made, I seasoned my meat w/ brown sugar, onion & garlic powder and browned it w/ finely chopped celery & sweet red onions.  I added italian diced tomatoes w/ the cheese mixture.  Finally I topped the final layer w/ mozzarella, chedder & parmesan.  Everyone ate 2nd's & it was so easy to prepare.  This is going into the weekly rotation as a new family favorite....

I messed up and cooked the noodles, but it came out great anyway.  I think this is a great base lasagna, and in the future I might add some spinach or other veggies (in order to trick my family into eating their vegetables)  (-;  This recipe fed three adults, two kids and a toddler for two dinners, and the ingredients cost about $20 (at a Ralph's Fresh Fare in Southern California).

This was a great base lasagna recipe.  I used italian sausage in place of the beef.  I like chunky spaghetti sauce, so I used a mushroom/garden veggie one.  It took about a jar and a half.  I took fresh spinach leaves and wilted them on top of the sauce as it was simmering, then mixed it up and added the meat.  Served this boldly for the first time when I had guests over, and it was gobbled up.  Went great with a nice red wine.

Came out perfect.  I agree that it isn't enough Ricotta (per video)for all 12 pieces of noodles, so I just added a 1/2 container more (or do smaller spoonfuls), I did italian blended cheese instead of just all mozzerella (made it 2x)and it turns out great. Nice not to have to boil the noodles anymore.

This is the first lasgna recipe I've tried and it turned out great. My boyfriend asked if I had bought it. I pretty much followed the recipe as is, except I added some onions and garlic to the meat mixture, and I used ground sausage in addition to the ground beef. When I first took it out of the oven it was very soupy looking, but after sitting for the recommended 15 minutes it dried up perfectly. Very, very yummy.

I'm so happy with this recipe!  I'm not much of a cook, but this was really easy to follow.  Only thing I added was a little sugar to the meat (which I also increase to 1.6 lbs) and sauce.

this was really good. my noodles were on the al dente side, probably could've left the lasagna in another 10 or 15 minutes. Still tasted really good, and the leftovers were even better, will definitely make again.

Great and easy recipe, thanks! We used wheat lasagna noodles, so we boiled them first before arranging them in the dish. Also added mushrooms, olives and a few spices. It tasted wonderful.

This was a very good lasagna.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because I made a few changes...I used sweet italian turkey sausage for the meat, I used fat free cottage cheese instead of ricotta and low fat cheddar in place of the mossarella.  I did add a bit more sauce and the result was perfect!  The lasagna ended up needing to be cooked about an hour and 20 min.  The result was great!  My four year old came to the dinner table saying he didn't like lasagna and then had seconds!  This is a keeper!

This is a great recipe that I have used several times. As with any lasanga, the ingredients are a bit pricy so I don't make it too often, but its a treat for me and my husband when I do. The only thing I change is the amount of sauce. I use a half a jar more than what the recipe calls for. Excellent and easy to make! Thanks!

Updated Review: After making this for a few years now, I continue to get compliments each time I put it on the table. People go crazy over this lasagna and several of my family members have asked me for the recipe. I always add an additional jar of sauce and it comes out perfect. Thank you for this excellent dish. This is one of our family favorites.

This is an awesome recipe. And by all means is a keeper in my book. I didn't change much to the recipe except when I browned the hamburger meat I added finely chopped onion with it Garlic seasoning and some fresh mushrooms to the meat mixture. We have 4 in our family and how we rate recipes is that everyone gets a vote to to either give it a star or not. Since all of us voted to give it a star we do another vote to determine if it just gets 4 stars or 5 all the way! This one was a 5 all the way!

Like the title states, this is a simple lasagna dish. Great, since I had never made lasagna before. I was really worried about not cooking the noodles first, but my mom assured me it can be done. Doubled the ricotta like others had stated and used the previous nights spaghetti sauce since I didn't want spaghetti again. Added another jar of sauce to the leftover to ensure enough. And I used every bit of sauce and ricotta mix. Did end up using 15 noodles total since I had a real deep dish, and a bit extra cheese. Came out great! I loved it, my boyfriend loved it and the kids did too! I know what's for dinner tonight too!

I have made lasagna for years how my mother taught me.  Her way of course is delicious, but this recipe is SO easy.  I was a little nervous that the noodles were still hard about 2/3 of the way through cook time, but they softened up at the end and the result was fantastic!

My first attempt at making lasagna. I got a little confused, but it turned out wonderfully. I did leave out the parsley, but other than that, I followed this recipe to the T.

Edited: My husband says this is better than the lasagna his family makes, A++++!

This is a great lasagna recipe.  I have always been scared away from making lasagna but decided to try this one and am so glad that I did.  My family of eight finished the pan.  I followed the advice of previous reviews and added onion and garlic to the meat while cooking.  I also used more sauce and more cheese.  I made this with the Great Green Salad, also from this site.  I serve with french bread and a vegetable.

Flavorful, hearty and NOT runny when you cut it (yay!). Next time I would add a little red pepper flakes and/or sub some of the ground meat with Italian sausage for a little more flavor. I will definitely make this again.

While I'm not a huge lasagna fan, I mainly make it for my lasagna-loving husband. This recipe is pretty good!  I browned my 93/7 ground beef (no grease to drain) with s&p, garlic/onion powders, and Italian seasoning. I had a small zucchini to use, so I diced it up and sauteed it along with my onion. Used two entire jars of sauce due to family preference and added extra shredded cheese between the layers. In addition, I spruced up the ricotta mixture by adding a bit of sea salt, pepper, garlic powder, basil, and a pinch of nutmeg. Husband went crazy for it! Easy, straightforward recipe that will be repeated in this house!

This was my first time cooking lasagna and it was sooo easy.  I used soy crumbles instead of beef and everyone loved it including the meat eaters.  I also used fat free ricotta.  I am going to make it again this weekend for my husbands birthday party and will grill the soy crumbles with garlic & onion as other recomended.

No cooking the noodles - I didn't believe it! It worked great! I used turkey in lieu of beef & added onions to the meat & spinach to the cheese mixture. I have tried a lot of lasagna recipes & this one is not only the easiest, but one of the best!

This is definitely a good shortcut recipe for lasagna. However, I take issue with the amounts in some of the ingredients. I don't know how one 26oz jar of sauce would be enough. I used two 32oz. jars and I used it all! I also used 4 cups of mozzarella. If I hadn't had the extra amounts of those two ingredients, I would have been really disappointed. I would make it again, but use the amounts I mentioned.

very good and eash lasagna recipe.  I did use more sauce than it called for about 32 oz., also I would add a little more cheese, and use a good sauce too.  Add spices, salt and pepper to your taste, but this recipe couldn't be easier and my family loved it.

Not the greatest.  My husband, who will eat about anything, didn't eat much of this at all. There wasn't enough sauce, meat, and cheese to go around.  Very bland and dry.  We love cheese and sauce, so it just wasn't enough for us.  Will look for a different recipe next time.  Thanks though.

This is a easy and great tasting recipe. I added a little garlic to the cheese mixture. Everyone loved it even myself which is good because I'm not a fan of Lasagna.
