I think the measurement for the baking powder should have been 1 tsp instead of 1 Tablespoon.  Everyone said the cake was good but I could taste the baking powder and did not enjoy the cake (but I'm critical of my cooking).

Yum...I was looking for a snack cake to have around and this is it!! The changes I made from the recipe was using 1/2 cup softened butter, 1 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar, added 1/8th tsp ginger to the spices and soaking the raisins in apple cider before adding to the batter. I also used 3 eggs instead of 4. It just got out of the oven and while it is awfully crumbly right now I haven't even waited for it to cool properly yet and I'm sure it will firm up slightly while cool. I also drizzled a thin glaze made from powdered sugar and apple cider on while still warm but in truth it is sweet enough without it.

made this today, used 3/4 cup brown sugar and 3/4 cup white sugar, didn't have raisins so i added 1/8 cup applesauce and 1/4 cup oats, and because i love spice, added a 1/2 teaspoon allspice and 1/4 teaspoon more nutmeg, and i took this cake to a class i go to, and i kid you not, it was gone. i was told by two of them that they don't even like nuts, but that it was perfect with it(i used coarsely chopped pecans and walnuts).  it smelled and tasted wonderful, very moist, chewy, and i had cooked it in a bundt pan with no problem.  so glad i found this recipe, a definate hit!

There isn't a thing about this recipe that I would change.   Even thought a few of the proportions seemed unusual, I went ahead and trusted the recipe and I'm glad I did.  The creator of this recipe definitely means to use 1 Tbl. baking powder and 3/4 tsp. cloves! Don't be afraid!  The cake turned out really moist, flavorful and dense, as a good snack cake should be.  This recipe is definitely a keeper!

This is the closest recipe I have found to an old favorite, named "Fine & Vital Oat Cake", that I found in a Sunset Magazine in the 1970's.  Unfortunately that recipe burned with my house two years ago and nobody in my family had the recipe ... and I have spend 2 years on the web trying to find anything close to it.  Packs well, goes camping well, is a great oat cake.

This is a great recipe! I substituted dried cranberries for the raisins, and used 2 loaf pans instead of the tube pan.

I usually don't like it when people review a recipe after having made a ton of changes to it, but this time I must. This is a great recipe as is, but today at work, I adapted it to include some chopped apples and some leftover oatmeal from breakfast.  We were short on butter so I substituted shortening, we were short on raisins so I added some chopped apples as well, and I wanted to use up the leftover oatmeal so I reduced the amount of milk and applesauce and dumped the leftovers in.  The cake is nice and heavy, moist and spicy, and really smelled wonderful baking.  It tastes delicious warm from the oven, and I'm willing to bet it will be delicious cold, too. Oh, and I only used 1 teaspoon, rather than 1 Tablespoon, of baking powder.

This is really a wonderful recipe!!  Moist and full of flavor. Doesn't need frosting at all. It's very much like banana bread but much lighter in texture. Melt in your mouth good!! I didn't change a thing. I baked it at 325 (I used my convection oven) for 60 min.

Very good moist cake and very close to what I made for special "MAN" birthdays years ago. I had lost the recipe and now will use this one, thanks.    I made this in two 8" rounds with cream cheese frosting for my son's 31st birthday, perfect!

This is a pretty good cake!  I halved the recipe and baked it in an 8 by 8 pan because I don't have a tube pan.  I also doubled the cinnamon, used half brown sugar, left out the nuts and used dried cranberries instead of raisins.  I can't decide if I like it better with or without the cranberries (I'm not a big fan of "things" in my cake or bread) but a cranberry glaze or something would be really good.  I'll make this again, it's quite fluffy and delicious.

Awesome recipe.  I followed the recipe exactly, however, I baked the batter in three loaf pans.  This lowered the cooking time (to about 40 minutes) and enabled me to gift some cake to friends and family.
This is definitely a keeper!!!  Thanks!

This cake is a very "heavy" cake. Probably one of the worst recipes I have tried.

This recipe is awesome... I work at the county jail & have calculated it to feed 200 people.  We use a little less on the nutmeg & cloves as they can be overpowering & we do not have nuts or raisins available to us, but it still comes out fantastic!  We have used both whipped cream & a light powder sugar glaze for topping & both were great.  Lots of great complements when we serve this.

Brilliant recipe, I too was worried about the tablespoon of baking powder, but it works great!  In the UK you can't buy jars of applesauce so I made some from Bramley Apples, worked a treat, moist, tasty and got lots of compliments at church!

I agree with the person who said that it tasted a little too much like baking powder. It still had a very good flavor, but I did sort of keep noticing the baking powder. I'm not sure what would happen if you used less though. I used half wheat flour.

This was pretty good.  I used 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1 cup Splenda to reduce the amount of sugar.  I also left out the raisins and I think that was a big mistake!  Not bad though!

I don’t know what it is about this cake, but it is delicious and I can’t stop eating it. I made it without the raisins and walnuts because I didn’t have any. And it is still awesome!

I substituted homemade peach butter for the applesauce....I just wish I had seen the note about the baking powder before I started....I didn’t sit down and read the comments until mine was in the oven but I agree that it is too much baking powder which causes a metallic, aluminum-like aftertaste which is just a shame because otherwise the flavor of the cake is delicious and has a nice texture from the oatmeal.

Very good snack cake.  I didn't have nuts and don't care for raisins in cake, so I added about 2/3 cup of shredded carrots.  Also used a peach yogurt (6 oz) in place of some of the milk.  I followed other reviews and reduced the baking powder to 2 heaping tsp. I don't usually ice or frost my 9x13 cakes - my priority is the cake - but it would be good with a simple icing.  We both liked it, and I will make this again.

I made a few small changes due to not having certain things in my pantry, but I think it turned out well. Maybe a bit crumbly, but the flavor is nice & not overly sweet. I didn't use raisins or nuts, went lighter on the spices, I forgot the milk, and used a whole can of unsweetened applesauce. I also baked in an 8x11 glass baking dish (prepped with cooking spray) for about 40 minutes. It's a good way to use up some of the extra oatmeal and applesauce I had in the pantry. Will probably make again.
