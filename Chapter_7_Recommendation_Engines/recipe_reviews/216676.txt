I made this exactly as the recipe states - the only change I made was to top it with barbecue sauce, because I'm out of chili sauce.  I liked the vegetables in it, I'll definitely do that again.  I would probably add a bit more salt, but other than that it's a good recipe.  Thanks for sharing!

I had some of my sons' friends over for dinner the night I made this.  It disappeared in minutes!  I added some shredded carrot, and changed the chili sauce to bbq, as I didn't know how spicy our young guests liked.  My kids request it all the time now.  The more veggies I can sneak in the better!

I'll admit I didn't think this would be good, but I was wrong! I did double the seasonings, but otherwise followed the recipe. With Valentine's Day approaching I shaped it like a heart. The vegetable confetti added to the festive look.
