My husband prefers center cut, boneless chops (which are kind of thick), so the first time I used this recipe, the chops didn't turn out as tender as I had expected.  Tonight, I butterflied and tenderized the chops and they turned out absolutely delicious.  I used breadcrumbs instead of crackers and cut back on the butter.  I also broiled the chops on both sides after they were cooked to eliminate the mushiness.  Even my three year old, who never eats pork chops, absolutely loved them!

This is the recipe my mom has used since I was a child.  Ritz crackers are the key.  For everyone using substitutes for the breading, you are missing out on the best breading.  Also,"flash" brown the chops at high to med/high heat to keep them moist (as you would veal).

I love this easy pork chops recipe, so good and so easy to prepare.  I have made it several times and the family loved it, especially our little girl.  The only change I made on this recipe is to use the Ritz cracker with garlic flavor, two eggs and cut down butter to ¼ cup.   To give the baked pork chops a bit of crunchy taste, I followed other members’ advice and remove the foil for the last 15 minutes in the oven.  I normally serve this dish with macaroni and cheese with a can of veggie.  Thanks for sharing this great recipe.

I wasn't searching for a low-fat recipe, so I have to give this one 5 stars! Very tasty - my husband never likes baked pork chops, but loved these! I added parsley and used Garlic Butter flavored Ritz. Yum! Save your egg - you only need 2. Definitely use 1/2 of the butter, turn over after 20 minutes, and uncover at the end.

Made these the other day, and DH gave these a thumbs up.  This one is a keeper.

Instead of butter, the chops were browned in light olive oil in a frying pan and transferred to a sheet cake pan, lined with foil & sprayed lightly with olive oil spray.  Baked them at 300 degrees, uncovered in the pan for about 25 minutes, then turned them over and baked them for another 25 minutes.  During the last 15 minutes, the temperature was increased to 375 degrees so that they would be crispy.  These chops were very tender  and good.

Very disappointing.  Little flavor and soggy chops! This recipe requires too many modifications to prevent it from joining the ranks of "just another pork chop" which unfortunately as written, it is......

Not bad at all!  I made 6 boneless chops about one inch thick each.  Instead of salt and garlic I sprinkled them with just Seasoning Salt, and I only needed two beaten eggs to coat them.  I crushed up about 2 cups of fat free seasoned croutons in my food processor and coated them with those.  I love to use croutons instead of bread crumbs for extra crunch and flavor.  I had about a half of stick of real butter left from my holiday baking so I dabbed that all over, and poured the remaining croutons on top.  I didn't flip them.  They were nice and moist and quite tasty!  Thanks!

These were great!  So moist and tender.  I did remove foil for the last 15 minutes so that they browned a ittle bit and weren't too soggy. Will make again.

We loved these chops.  They are tasty and have great flavor.  Plus, very easy to adjust the recipe to cook for only one or two people.  The only think I would change is to decrease the amount of butter used on top of the chops.  I think one tablespoon per chop would be more than enough.  I used two as the recipe called for and thought it was way too much.  My chops were swimming in it and didn't crisp as much as I thought they would have without that much butter.

I have made this recipe twice already, and my husband loves it. It is super easy to make, and gets done quickly. I would recommend turning the chops when half-way done, do be sure that the bread crumbs are cooked all the way on both sides. Also be sure to place the butter evenly over the tops, so that it will melt properly. I too broiled mine the last five minutes, to eliminate the mushiness. Great flavor!!! Thanks, Heather!!

This is a simple, basic way of oven cooking pork chops and my family loved it!  I had 8 boneless chops, so I increased the ingredients with the exception of the butter.  I only sliced up about 2 tablespoons and it was plenty to place around the meat.  Also, I crushed up 2 sleeves of crackers and had plenty left over. Next time I will only use 1 1/2 sleeves.  I placed them in a Ziploc bag and used a rolling pin to quickly turn them to crumbs.  After dipping the chicken in the eggs, (I only used 2 eggs, too.)I dropped them in the bag of crumbs, shook it a little, then really pressed the crumbs into the meat.  Next time I may try the garlic crackers like other reveiwers suggested.  Also, during the last few minutes of cooking, I turned on the broiler and flipped them over to crisp up each side.  I baked them on a Silpat in a sheet pan and they turned out crispy, yet juicy on the inside!

An easier way to do these and get crispy crust is to put several tbs. of cooking oil on foil lined pan and spread around. Place chops on this and spray chops very lightly w/olive oil.  Bake at 375.  After 20 minutes, turn the chops.  Cook another 20 min.  Will be crispy and moist.

Love these! Been making them for years! You can use the breading of your choice (bread crumbs, Ritz cracker crumbs, saltine crumbs, etc. - don't be afraid to experiment!!), and I would suggest the following simple changes: Use garlic POWDER instead of garlic salt (more garlic flavor, less unneeded sodium), and for the butter part -- take 3 to 4 tablespoons of butter and place in an oven proof dish. Place in hot oven and allow to melt completely and even begin to sizzle a little. THEN add your breaded chops to melted butter, flip over (so both sides are "buttered" and bake as recommended. This will give you a nice, crunchy coating when done baking and avoid the sogginess some folks have mentioned. (Part of the reason some of you are finding your chops are coming out soggy is because of the way the original recipe states to add the butter, but even more so, it's how much butter is called for - wayyyy too much, causing your chops to simmer in butter instead of browning in it.)

Great recipe - turned out yummy.  Simple comfort food.  Read reviews and did the following alterations:  Crumb Ritz crackers coarsely for more texture.  used all the butter and 1 t. of  garlic salt.  Baked for 20 mins, turned over, sprinkled with remaining crumbs.  Baked for another 20 min and removed cover and bumped up temp to 400 degrees to bake for the final 15 mins.  Got the crust I wanted for texture but without soggy.

Try adding a tablespoon of Dijon to the egg and adding some rosemary to the crumbs for an added kick of taste! WoW! That gives it the 5 stars for sure!

this recipe gets 5stars..tried it last night, did the double dip, lightly sprayed olive oil in bottom of PYREX dish, think the glass contributes to the browning issue, half the butter, took others suggestions, a little parmeson in the crushed cornflakes, a dab of dijon in the egg dip...the chops were perfectly brown, crispy, tender and juicy...adding to the rotation..thanks..and to the puritans who resent  giving 5 stars when others use a little enhancement to a dish...a good cook always knows how to tweak a recipe...the originator deserves 5 stars for the initial recipe...

This is a good recipe for bone-in pork chops. Soggy?  I believe that the correct term is "tender".  Too many people grew up on overcooked, dried out pork chops.  This isn't 1960!

So, I wish I read the reviews first.  My chops were too thick, and I thought that would be a problem, and it was.  Next time I will certainly either butterfly them and tenderize them, or get thin cut chops.  Secondly, I am disappointed that the recipe mentions nothing about uncovering them, or turning them over.  It is sad that you have to read all the reviews in order to get a recipe that would be ideal.  I guess that is something that I need to remember about this site.  There are many great recipes, but most of them have been tested and altered by so many folks, it is hard to tell what to do sometimes.  This time, my chops came out looking quite pale, and I had to broil them uncovered for 10 additional minutes, but the bottoms were still quite mushy, so I ended up turning them and broiling them again.  That ended up in too much cooking time.  I really enjoyed the flavor though, and will certainly do this again, but buyer beware, make sure you read the reviews, and read them carefully.  This primary recipe is good with the alternative methods, but left much to be desired if you followed the main recipe steps.

I took the advice of several of you:  only use half the butter, turn over the chops hqlf way through the cooking cycle... then broil for about 3 minutes.  About half-way through making iled/mashed potatoes, steaming broccoli (sp?), and the pork chop preparation.. I swear I said to myself "I should have gotten fast food, I should have gotten fast food...etc (it was a long day at work today before all this - - not to mention logistically getting a car towed to get worked on in the middle of dinner)... anyway, after all was said and done... my pork chops ended up being the best pork chops ever made on the face of the earth ...that may be a slight exaggration.  My daughters and wife loved them and I shall never think of fast food as an alternative to this dinner. Delicious beyond measure...and I can only think of 99% of all other pork chops I've had .. the cooks always salted them to death... they should know better.

I have been making this recipe for years with nothing but compliments from friends and family.  If you are a huge fan of Parmesan cheese as I am you'll throw in a few tablespoons of the cheese into the crumb mix.  Delicious!

Wonderful recipe.  However, after reading all the reviews, I, too, added some igredients here and there to make it my own (added Dijon to the eggs, added parmesan, pepper and fresh sage to the Ritz cracker crumbs).  
A lot of the reviews seemed to have trouble with the baking of the chops ---- too soggy, etc.
Well, try this:  I followed the recipe (with my own additions), BUT I did not use a casserole dish.  I battered and breaded the pork chops (approx 3/4 inch thick) then placed them on a (greased) rack that had been placed on a cookie sheet  I only added a couple of small pieces of butter to the top of the chops before baking).  I adjusted the cooking time to 425 degrees for 16 -22 minutes.  The chops turned out great - no turning, no broilig, no sogginess.
Just a suggestions.  Loved it!

I thought they weren't crispy enough and the Ritz crackers were too sweet tasting for pork chops in my opinion.  I like a coating that is crispier and with a more savory flavor.  I think I will stick to my traditional breading using Italian Seasoned breadcrumbs.  I think oven frying them in Canola oil produces a crisper crust than using the butter and is healthier as well.  We didn't hate them but they weren't good enough to become a family favorite or replace my old standby made with a breadcrumb coating.

Excellent dish... hard to believe that Ritz crackers and garlic salt could produce such a delectable dish. I used 1" thick boneless chops, so I ended up cooking them 15 minutes more longer than the suggested 45 minutes. I also reduced the butter to about 1/2 the suggested amount. The was really no need for all that butter. And I removed the foil for the last 1/2 of the cooking time so they were crispier and not soggy. They were juicy and tender. My hubby LOVED them. He kept asking where I got such a great recipe.

Five stars from my husband, who does not like "breaded" chops!  Both of my kids enjoyed them also.  We broiled them a coupe minutes before serving just to brown them up a bit.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Great recipe, have been enjoying for years since I was a kid and my Mother made them.  However, you might want to try crushed cornflakes instead of crackers, they are crispy and very tasty!

This one is *in the rotation* - regularly appears on my family's dinner table.  I double-dip, from the cracker crumbs back to the egg, then another turn in the crumbs.  I also add some poultry seasoning to the crumb mixture.  Yummy.

Instead of garlic salt, I went on Food Network and found Paula Dean's House Seasoning recipe and used about a teaspoon or two of that as the seasoning for my Ritz cracker crumbs.  Covering these while cooking keeps them moist so they don't turn into saw dust chops, but they do look kind of wet and anemic when they're done.  So, when they were nearly done cooking I removed the cover and turned the broiler on medium-low and broiled the chops for 2-3 minutes each side or until they were a light caramel brown and slightly crispy.  They were absolutely perfect after that.  Will do these again and again!

The first time I tried this, I messed it up because I was unaware that pork chops and pork cutlets are not the same thing. For one thing, cutlets are much smaller (and cheaper). Also, they don't have a bone, so they don't need to cook as long. If you happen to be using pork CUTLETS, use one egg, and 1/2 cup of butter crackers. And bake for 25 to 30 minutes, rather than 45 (until no longer pink).

Excellent!  I used 1/4 cup butter after reading all the other reviews.  Here's a trick that worked great...I put the butter in the baking pan and melted it in the oven, then breaded the chops and set them in the pan and flipped them over right away. Perfectly evenly buttered coating.

Too "soggy" so only gave it 2 stars originally. Tried again, dusted chops with flour before the egg/breadcrumb process. Then pan-fried in butter over medium heat for approx 3-4 minutes each side until golden brown, then out of the pan and into the oven on a baking tray for 15 minutes (depends on thickness of chops). Delicious, tender and not soggy!

Very good pork chops - do not need 1/2 cup butter - 1/4 cup is plenty.  Used Ritz Crackers - put them in the blender with the pepper and garlic salt.

For those of you who like to cut back on the calories, I made the following changes:  Used reduced fat crackers, Egg Beaters, and only 1/4 cup of margarine instead of 1/2 cup of butter.  And the pork chops were still delicious and incredibly moist!  Also, I took another reviewer's suggestion of broiling the chops after baking to "crisp it up" a bit and give it a nice golden brown look.

Delicious!! I melted the butter in the oven  and cooked them at 400 for 25 minutes they came out perfect tender and juicy.  The key is to let them get to room temperature and then season, dip in egg and then roll in the crackers and cook uncovered. 45 minutes is far too long unless you like a dry tough chop.

Thanks for sharing this.

Great recipe, but I did have to modify it quite a bit. I double-batter my pork chops. I coat them with flour, and then I dip it in egg. Afterward, I roll it in the crackers. Also, I pan-fry it for a few minutes on high heat to brown the crust before baking it all the way through. Always turns out super juicy with that delicious crunch.

Simple and delicious recipe! I took the advice from a few reviews listed and used 4 boneless pork chops,  2 eggs, Ritz crackers, and uncovered the dish with 15 minutes remaining. They were tasty, moist, and tender. Highly recommend it!

Excellent. These went over very well here! Moist and delicious. I am out of garlic salt so added approx. 3/4 teasp of garlic powder and 1/2 teasp. kosher salt. Two eggs was more than enough for 4 chops. The baking time was perfect in my oven. Thanks for sharing!

These are fabulous. Like one of the reviewers suggested, I started them in the oven at 300 degrees uncovered on a shallow baking sheet covered in foil sprayed with cooking spray, baked one side 25 minutes, turned them, baked the other side 25 minutes, inreased heat to 375 for 15 minutes to crisp them nicely. That's it. So easy, and so tender and flavorful. Will use this often.

This is one of our favorite recipes!  Here's what I do:  Only use 1 egg; use Ritz cracker crumbs; season with Garlic Salt, coarse black Pepper & dash of Cayenne pepper.  Dot tops with 1/3 stick of butter pats.  Bake (uncovered) at 400 for 15-20 minutes.  Turn chops over & top with pats from remaining 1/3 stick of butter.  Bake 15 more minutes.  Perfect!  Crispy outside, tender & moist inside!

Have been baking chops this way for YEARS. If you want more flavor,add 1TBS. of Worcestershire sauce to beaten eggs. Always use Ritz crackers as one reviewer wrote.....More

This is a great basic recipe. I use a cup of panko bread crumbs instead of cracker crumbs and 3 egg whites instead of full eggs, and added a few more spices. It was delicious.

This recipe was excellent.  I noticed in the reviews some were saying their pork chops came out mushy, be sure you don't crowd the chops.  I used 2 cookie sheets covered with foil (easy clean up) for 6 chops.  Half way thru the cooking time rotate the pans. They were so crisp and tender. I needed 2 sleeves of crackers after the egg bath. I will definitely make again.

I'm not a big fan of pork chops but these turned out GREAT! Instead of crackers I used crushed stuffing mix. I also put a pat of butter on top while baking in addition to around it as the recipe calls for. The meat was still a little dry so next time I will probably put a little more butter on top to keep it moist. Still very tasty!!!

This recipe was excellent.  Like others, I pan fried it on each side for 4-5 minutes to get a bit of crispness to the breading and then baked it. I also cut the butter in half and took the foil off when I turned the chops.  It was excellent - even my daughter who groans when we have pork chops said it was great. I served it with saffron rice and broccoli. I followed guidance of other raters.

I read the reviews and used the ingredients as listed. The only think I did different was to flip the pork chops over and to uncover during the final 15 minutes of cooking.  Blah.  Even uncovered, it was mush.  The only thing good about the recipe is that it was done in the time suggested and at the oven temperature given.  Will not make again d/t mushiness.  My search continues for a pork chop recipe...

I used the roasted vegetable Ritz crackers and only 2 eggs for 8 chops. I thought, after reading all the reviews about the coating being mushy on the bottom that I'd leave the bottoms of the chops uncoated. Seemed to work just fine. There wasn't as much flavor as I expected, especially since I used the roasted vegetable flavored crackers. Chops were moist though, so that's a plus.

Made these tonight and followed the exact recipe...guess I should have read the reviews about not covering them. I covered them and they came out of the oven very soggy.  We prefer our chops to have some crispness to them, like what the picture shows.   Next time I'll bake covered for the first 15-20 minutes and bake uncovered for the rest of the time.  Hope that makes a difference, because these were a disappointment.

The pork chops were a huge hit for my family. Had my father-in-law over for dinner and he even enjoyed them, though he doesn't care much for pork. I used 2 eggs for 6 chops and also took the foil off with 15 minutes left on timer. It crisped it up a little but still left it incredibly moist!!

Didn't turn out at all, no one had dinner tonight! But, based on the other reviews, I will try this again.  I used bone-in chops, breaded, covered dish with foil and removed the last few minutes and they just didn't look very appetizing.  They were pale and "wet".

I do not like pork chops they are very dry, I thought that there had to be a better way to make them so everybody liked them because my husband is the only one that likes them, to my surprise my kids ate everything on there plate I think I have the most picky eaters on the planet! They all requested that I make them again I think the only thing I did wrong is add to much butter I think other people were right cut down on it, other than that they loved it! I usually do not cook and this was very easy!

I used whole wheat crackers since that was all I had on hand. I also added some Parmesan cheese to the egg mixture. I uncovered the chops after 20 minutes for a more browned meat. Everyone raved and my Hubby said, "That was the most tender pork chop I have ever eaten!" That and it was the most flavorful!! Thanks for a delicious recipe :o)

Although I modified it just a bit, this was the first time I actually liked (and will make again) pork shops that were baked.  The meat was so tender and this dish had a wonderful flavor!!!

My husband said, "Let's only make pork chops like this from now on."  So I'd say it was a hit!  I only needed 2 eggs, cut the butter in half, flipped them half-way thru baking, removed cover for the last 10 minutes and broiled on low for about 5 minutes just to finish browning them up nicely!

These were spectacular! I added a 2 Tbl parmesan cheese and some finely chopped hazelnuts to the crushed Ritz to pump up the flavor of the coating a bit. (I use the same combination on fish as well) and followed everyone's suggestion of using less butter and egg. The results were crunchy and juicy and very flavorful. Will definitely make these on a regular basis.

I thought these were amazing!! The only thing i did different was I used garlic butter club crackers instead of ritz. My husband and i loved it and so did our kids so it's definitely going to become a regular at our house :D.

This recipe was great and so easy. Everyone agreed that I will have to make it for them again. Though, I do agree with what others were saying about less butter, I put in about half of the recommended amount, and I also took the foil off with 15 minutes left and broiled it with 5 minutes left. It wasn't mushy at all, the outside was crisp, and they were very tender.

I agree....Ritz crackers are the way to go. Such a tender meat it turned out to be. Served with Knoor Sides-noodles, snow peas and mushrooms.

Made these exactly as written except I cut the butter by 1/2.  They were DELICIOUS!!!  I'm not a big pork chop fan and I had seconds and my husband and I even argued over who got the one we had left over.  :)

THE BEST PORK CHOPS I HAVE EVER MADE!!  I seasoned the chops with seasoned salt and pepper, and did the same for the eggs and crumbs (adding a garlic and herb seasoning to the crumbs, also).  I used panko bread crumbs, 2 eggs, 1/4 C butter.  I would've given them 5 stars, but they didn't turn out quite as tender as mentioned.  Even after 45 min in the oven they weren't really tender, but they weren't too tough to be enjoyable, either.  Broil for a few minutes on each side if you want the brown color and crispy texture.  I will definitely make these again.  We really enjoyed them, and the leftovers were just as good.  "DELICIOUS!" as  my family put it.  =)

The BEST pork chops I've ever eaten! Definitely turn pork chops over half way through. Uncover and broil for the last 5 minutes. And you can cut the amount of butter in half. This recipe is great! Thank you!

Couldn't believe something so simple could be so tasty.  Next time I will try putting a cooling rack in my pan so the bottom of the chop is as crispy as the top.  I will definitely make this again.

I really like pork and my husband does not really care for it.  So i am always trying to find recipes for pork to win him over on it.  These were very good.  My husband said "for pork I'd give it five stars but if you are comparing it to steak I'd go about 3 stars".  So thats about as good as you can get from him.  I used garlic powder instead of garlic salt because I figured my Ritz crackers had enough salt.  Easy to prepare and my whole house enjoyed eating them.

Was pleasantly surprised at how tender and juicy these stayed in the oven. Followed recipe exactly except I added much more garlic and season salt to the cracker mixture, and I was glad I did. I found that for four pork chops, 2 eggs for the wash was plenty(luckily, because that was all I had). Also, before I put them in the oven I generously sprinkled Parmesano Reggiano all over the top. THis added extra crispness and flavor. These are going into my regular rotation. Even my young 3 and 6 year old ate them, and they never eat pork. Only reason I am not giving this 5 stars is because I reserve those for recipes that are really extraordinary.

These pork chops were pretty good!  I agree with others to use half the butter.  I would probably use only 2 eggs instead of 3 next time... as there were plenty of eggs left over.  I found that 1 cup of cracker crumbs was also a tad bit much.  FYI, to get 1 cup of crackers it took almost an entire sleeve of Ritz crackers.  I think about 20 crackers would be enough for 4 pork chops.  One last thing, I didn't see the part to cover the pork chops while baking and I thought mine turned out pretty good.  Overall I thought this was a 4 star recipe.  ****  On a side note, I also do this similiar recipe with chicken breast... yummy!  (See Famous Butter Chicken also submitted by Heather.)

These were without a doubt the best pork chops that I have evr tasted.  My husband is not a big fan of pork chops and really enjoyed these!  The onlly thing I did differently was at the end, broiled them for 3 minutes to make the outside crispy... Fantastic!

I thought this was a wonderful meal, there is only a few thingsI think I would change,I would shorten up the butter a little, and cook it for 30min covered and the last 15 min uncovered, I found by doing that it made the coatting a little more crunchy!!

NOT good!  I decided to do what the other reviewers suggested and UNcover the pork chops during the last 15 minutes and turn them over.  Well, when I uncovered the pan, the "breading" was all puffy and soft, and when I tried to turn them over it all slid off!  Yuck!  So, if you are looking for pork chops with a crispy breading, this is NOT it!!!  Definitely will not make again!

I have been cooking and baking for more than 60 yrs.  With a couple of additions, this recipe is one of the best and tastiest I have cooked in a long time.  I added a little crushed thyme and Bell's Poultry Seasoning to the cracker mix.  I use butter crackers.  I spray the topping with butter-flavored Pam or drizzle melted butter over both sides prior to cooking. I put a rack in the bottom of my pan, then place the boneless pork chops on it.  I take off the foil for the last 6-8 minutes.  Tender, juicy and crispy on the outside.

OMG...the best pork chops ever!  Adding the butter made all the difference.  We loved them and we are both a hard sale on pork recipes.  I passed the recipe along to my brother, he tried them and LOVED them.  Definitely going to be a regular in my home.

Delish! I had small boneless chops and I baked them covered for 20 minutes and then uncovered for another 15-20. They were great. I used crushed Club crackers too.

I followed this recipe just as it was written. Sorry but it was far from crispy. Not one I would attempt again.

Excellent! I used ritz crackers and added some onion powder and italian seasoning. Used only 2 eggs. I also seared the pork chops which I think is key to lock in the juices. Cooked for 400 covered for 15mins and uncovered for 10. Did not use any butter, did not need it. Thanks for the recipe these chops where juicy and crispy.

My pork chops turned out dry and soggy.  I used thin pork chops - maybe thicker wouldn't dry out???  As for the sogginess, I'm not sure how to help that.  My husband actually liked them (he ate 2 of them) but my daughters (2 & 9) and I didn't like them at all.

Yummy and easy! I used only 2 eggs, half the butter, pan-seared before baking, and baked for about 30 minutes. I served with Chef John's Mushroom Gravy on the side. Easy recipe to adjust to your family's tastes.

I made this for dinner and they were good. I used the ingredients as stated. The pork chops were tender.  Like other reviewers, I also removed the foil and broiled for the last 15 minutes to brown. The only thing I would tweak is to make the cracker mixture a bit spicier, since it was a little bit bland. Still, yummy and will try again.

I followed the instrctions very closely (added flavored crackers instead), but after cooking, I needed to use the broiler to brown the chops.  Used broiler 4-5 minutes per side.  Very delicious and will ake again.

I have been using AllRecipes for years and this was the first time I have been disappointed in a recipe ever. I just didn't care for it - flavor was very blah and won't make again. I just don't get why everyone liked them so much. Oh well....

This is pretty good, but not real great. The only real changes I made was to putthe spices in the egg instead of the crackers. I also added basil. It seemed to take forever to cook, though. I ended up sticking them in the microwave to finish cooking them. (I used a glass cssarole) I took the lid off and browned them too, but the breading was still mushy. That's why only 4 stars instead of 5.

I rarely give 5 stars, but this is my favorite pork chop recipe. The only change I make is I use Italian bread crumbs and I melt the butter in the pan first by heating the whole casserole pan up first in the oven. I don't need that much butter, but you do have to use REAL butter. Awesome!

These were really good and a great way to make a bunch of pork chops at once.  My only complaint is that the breading on the top was a bit soggy.  I think next time I make it I'll take the foil off with about 10 minutes remaining and see if that helps.

Update: Giving this one an easy 5 stars! Have been making this recipe now for a few months. Originally tried bread crumbs, and continue to use them on this recipe. They turn out nice and moist with the butter that gets placed around the pan. I have used a suggestion by others to add paprika, and that still adds a nice flavor. I cook 8 to 10 chops at a time, so increase the cooking time to 1 hour, and they come out perfect. We use this dish about once a week or so. It is a family favorite!

Mine was a little soggy, but I only made two chops, so I will reduce the amount of butter next time.  Flavor was amazing, though!!!  Delicious!  Definitely making again. (Also, I uncovered for the last 25 minutes of baking.)

I made these exactly as directed. They were good, but came out soggy instead of crispy, eventhough I uncovered them for the last 15 minutes.I wonder how they would come out if they were baked uncovered for the duration...hmm.

It turned out great!! So good and so moist! We followed the recipe exactly. We used ritz crackers for the coating. Because we were worried about a soggy bottom we took them out of the oven about 20 minutes before it was done then placed on a cooling rack (placed on a cookie sheet) then let it cook uncovered for the rest of the time. While it didn't completely get rid of the sogginess it certainly helped. Other than that...yummy!

I skipped the garlic, added 2 tbsns brown sugar and  some cracked black pepper for a different flavor. My family is only OK with garlic, but the sweet/hot kick of the brown sugar and pepper was a hit. I did broil the meat for a couple of minutes to brown them , but did not add any time overall to the cooking process. They were very good, very crispy, and very tender.

Wow, I'm a beginner cook and I tried this recipe and it turned out perfectly! My husband and I loved it! One successful dinner made. I used Ritz cracker and I put a little bit of Old Dutch Peppercorn Chips. It gave it a bit of a kick.

This was great. I was very surprised at how flavorful this was and tender. This will be my new official baked porkchop recipe. Yum.

These were ok...I cut back on the butter...half a stick is just way too much for four pork chops. I also halved the salt. They were tender, but really didn't have a lot of flavor. Not sure if I'll make these again...

These are very good! My family enjoyed this recipe, only next time I am using less butter in the pan OR a large casserole dish for less "wetness" to the breading. It is very good though!

THANK YOU for posting this recipe!  This was incredibly easy as well as super tasty.  My husband actually enjoyed something I cooked with minimal ingredients.  I was thinking this was going to need hot sauce on it for some flavor but it didn't.  The only thing I cut back on was the butter but otherwise this was awesome!  Usually I shy away from pork chops because they end up dry and overcooked but these were extremely tender and very good!  This recipe is definitely a keeper and I'm passing it along as well (and giving you credit, of course :) Thanks again!

I made this exactly as written, except for adding some oregano spice to egg mixture. First three eggs was way too much for four pork chops, two are fine. It took 55 minutes to bake mine, I did remove the foil the last ten minutes trying to crisp the coating. The bottom was mushy and the top was slightly crisp. If not for my added oregano these would have been bland tasting. My pork was very tender but expected the coating to be crispy. If I tried again I might turn half way through and remove the foil to try to crisp the bottom also.

Made it exactly as instructed and it was wonderful.  Very homey and comforting.  I thought about browning it more with the broiler, but stuck with the recipe and it was great.  Kids even loved it.

This is a solid recipe. I combined this with other pork chop recipes and comments to come up with something even better. I didn't have butter crackers, but I had some leftover store-bought breadcrumbs, to which I added flour, cornmeal, garlic powder and Mrs. Dash. Then I browned them in a skillet before transferring them to a baking dish. I continued with the recipe as given, using olive oil instead of butter. Meanwhile, I used the skillet to carmelize some sliced onions and mushrooms.

For a healthy version use three egg whites, seasoned bread crumbs.  Spray medium baking sheet with non-stick spray, bake in pre-heated 350 oven for 15 min. turn bake for another 15 min. Perfect every time.

My husband loved this recipe.  The only reason I gave it four stars is because it was hard to get the coating crunchy.  I even uncovered it for the last few minutes of baking.  The taste was awesome though.

These are the best pork chops I've see had!! They are soo moist and have a crunch.  I used half the butter and 2 eggs also flipped after 20 minutes uncovered them for the other side and broiled an additional 5 mins.  Delicious!!

The crackers makes all the difference...I tried it with Italian bread crumbs and it was still good, but  with the crackers is so much better!  It has become a staple at my home!

YUM! I made this for my husband and I, and it was amazing! I used italian bread crumbs instead of butter crackers (I didn't have any on hand) Because I was making for two people, I only used one egg. Added little pats of butter around the chops. Took off the foil for the last 10 minutes of baking. Served with green bean casserole and mashed sweet potatoes. AMAZING! Will be adding this to my often-used recipe book. Thank you!!

My husband surprised me with dinner the other night and had these ready when I got home from work. He used Brown Sugar and Cinnamon Ritz crackers (they're new), no additional seasonings, pork tenderloin, and 1/2 the amount of butter called for. I was so surprised with his gesture as well as with the choice of crackers and they turned out absolutely scrumptious! Thanks so much HAULBUR for a good recipe that adapts well to many flavors!

I used panko bread crumbs, since I did not have butter crackers. Next time, I will make sure to season the pork chops with garlic salt before dipping. The seasoning was not as pronounced as it would have been had the meat been seasoned before dipping. Start checking the meat at around 35 minutes. Mine was done in just under 40 minutes. Good recipe.

I seasoned the pork chops first with seasoning salt then melted the butter in the pan before added the chops.  I also uncovered after 30 minutes then broiled each side for 5 minutes as others suggested.  The BEST pork chops I have ever eaten!!!  Sooo yummy!!  The buttery crackers are such a nice flavor for the breading.  Mine came out moist and sooo tender!!  Will definately be making again.  :)

Delicious, but here are some things to take into consideration: I used the full amount of butter with a pan that nestled the chops right next to each other, and they ended up coming out delicious-but soggy (even after I uncovered them to let them brown).  I think if you're going to pack the chops into a dish close together, you could probably cut down the butter to 1/4 cup, end up with crunchy chops, and not even miss the difference in flavor.  If you're spacing them out in a large pan though, you might need the full amount to keep them from drying out.  Pan size seems to be the key though.  Delicious anyhow.

Wonderful!  I only needed 2 eggs for 6 chops.  I breaded my chops with ritz crackers, black pepper, salt, garlic powder, parsley and onion powder that I mixed in my food processor.  I seared the chops before placing in baking dish and used 1/4 stick of butter, if that.  I baked 20 minutes and flipped, baked another 20 minutes and then broiled for about 3 minutes.  Really, really good!  This recipe is a keeper!  I served with macaroni and cheese, asparagus and applesauce.

This is the best pork chop recipie I have run into to! My chops always come out over done and dry, but these were amazing! I used garlic butter crackers, and 2 eggs, and you should defenetley take the lid off the pan the last 20 minutes or so, other wise it turns otu kinda soggy :) GREAT RECIPIE!

Our kids love Shake-N-Bake so I wasn't sure this was going to work because it is so simple. Sometimes you just have to go with what you have. To my pleasant surprise I have served pork chops this way a number of times and nobody seems to miss the old Shake-N-Bake at all. I do add different herbs and spices just for change but it really doesn't need it. Simple is good.

I made these pork chops a few nights ago and they were delicious! I didn't have the regular Ritz crackers so I used a combination of the new Ritz Flipsides (Ritz cracker on one side, Pretzel on the other), and Club crackers. It tasted great! Thanks for a great recipe that I will use again!  Mummio2

These are easy, quick and delicious!  I've made these a couple of times already and my whole family loves them.  I usually use boneless chops and they always come out moist and tender.  The only change I made was to use a 1/4 cup of butter melted and then drizzle over the top instead of the 1/2 cup chunked.

I was out of ritz crackers so I used Cheez-its.  Came out great. I broiled for last 5 minutes to crisp them up.

This was as bland as it gets: no flavor, no zing. Might has well have just baked the pork chops with nothing on it, because the coating fell off anyway and did not go well with the pork. Will not make again.

we used tenderized pork chops making these cut-able with fork. To make it crispy the next day we just broiled it. Excellent!!

This is a recipe my Mom has made since I was a child. I cook my chops in a skillet on top of the stove. After you have breaded your chops mix any of the egg mixture and cracker crumbs together and cool in the frig. When your chops are done, don't clean the pan, I add a little oil and make patties out of the mixture and cook them about 4 minutes on each side till browned.

This recipe is good but I wouldn't call it famous.  I followed others advice and used 1/2 the butter, uncovering them halfway, and broiling for 5 minutes at the end. I liked it a lot, and I'll probably make them again experimenting with different seasonings.

Good, basic pork chop recipe.  I followed the others' advice and baked uncovered the last 15 minutes; then a 5 minute broil on each side.  I also cut back on the butter.
Very good. I will make again.

This was a very easy meal with a great flavor. I used Club Crackers, and it worked well. However, I forgot to account for the saltiness of the crackers when I seasoned the chops with the garlic salt, so it did come out a tad bit salty. I just wanted to mention this so it doesn't happen to you.

Kids (10 & 8) and hubby loved them. For the crumbs, I used a sleeve of Wheat Ritz plus garlic salt and threw in 1/4 cup wheat germ and 2 tbsp flaxseed for some sneaky vitamins/fiber. I had a large assorted pack (8 chops) of bone-in, thin cut chops, and used 2 glass dishes to bake them in. Cooked once for two dinners, love the convenience. This one's a keeper; thanks for the post!

My kids don't like pork. Don't know why but my son told me I loved that chicken mom. He is so picky so it must have been good. My mother took home the last pork chop and she told me today that it was awesome. I will use this recipe again.

This recipe is so good.  I did prepare the chops differently however.  I like to use my electric skillet.  I prepare chops as directed, but instead of baking in the oven, I brown each side in the skillet at medium-high heat and then I turn down the heat to low and cover and bake for approx. 35 more minutes.  The chops turn out so moist every time.  My family loves this!

I really liked this recipe.  It was easy to make, with ingredients I typically have at home, so I didn't need to make an extra trip to the grocery store.  Plus, it was delicious!  I used Club crackers for the breading and added a little bit of parmesan cheese as well...turned out better than I expected.

These were delish! They turned out perfect. I only added half the butter, and melted it and drizzled on top. I also added dried parsley flakes to the ritz cracker mixture.

These were great no leftovers here. The only change that I made was that I did not cover it at all. Cooked it on 375. It was not burnt or soggy just cooked to perfection. Yummy Yum Yum. Next time I might try one of the flavored ritz.

Very easy and delicious! Based on other recommendations, I used only 2 eggs, which was more than enough to coat the pork chops. I also removed foil during last 20 minutes to crisp up the cracker topping. A nice variation of the original breading could include various herbs.

Made these tonight, and like numerous other reviewers, uncovered them after 30 min and cut the amount of butter in half.  Turned out great (among the best pork chops I've had), and I will definitely make them again!

I tried out the recipe tonight & it got the thumbs up from my family!
I did however change some of the ingredients.
Firstly, I didn't use any butter & second I didn't have any Ritz biscuits, so I just used "Krackawheat" (UK) - these are quite salty, so I didn't add anymore salt.
I coated each pork chop in the egg & then in the Krackawheat crumb, shallow fried in olive oil on both sides & put into the oven on 180 (UK electric oven) for around 40 minutes (turning twice).
While the oven was on I also put into a seperate tin, red, yellow & green peppers, carrots, red onion, mushrooms & 2 cloves of garlic drizzled with olive oil & a sprig of rosemary.
I then served mushroom rice & a garlic baguette - delicious.

This was a wonderful recipe! I usually don't like to cook pork because alot of pork recipes are just not good. I added some grated parmesan cheese as another reviewer suggested and some dried rosemary. I used some garlic powder, onion powder and some garlic and herb seasoning. It was delicious and not dried out! Will be making this again very soon!

We loved it!  It was simple and delicious.  We didn't use any butter, but just sprayed it all with butter cooking spray.  It kept them moist and cut down calories/fat and they didn't get super soggy.  I made them last week and I am making them again tonight.

I added some Italian seasonings to the Cracker mixture and after transferring the pork chops to the baking pan I put the left over cracker mixture on top for extra breading. My boyfriend loved it and will definitely cook this again.

We used breadcrumbs instead of crackers and less better.  Turning them half way through is necessary.  Very good.

Very good. Did as others suggested and flipped them after 25 min. Did not use as much butter as recipe called for. Added a little more butter after I flipped them. Came out brown, tasty and tender. The recipe might be a little bland for most, so spice them up with your favorite seasonings! Great with mashed potatoes and green beans.

This is a great dish!  I did find, however, that if you crush the crackers too much then the coating will be a little soggy.  To fix this I simply turned my broiler on for about 5 minutes at the end and that seemed to make the coating a little crunchier.  Great recipe overall!!

GREAT! Awesome! I used the buttery crackers and made sure to add plenty of salt (don't like garlic salt), pepper and garlic powder since others said it was bland. I sprayed my baking dish and threw it in the oven. After 30 minutes I turned them over and realized I'd forgotten the butter (but the breading didn't fall off and wasn't poofy.) I put about 1t of butter on each one and baked for a few more minutes.  Hubby loved it, 3 yo loved it. A definate keeper!

This was a delicious way to cook pork chops. My husband warned me before I made them that he isn't a big pork chop fan, but afterward he said they were delicious. That they were the best thing I'd made from this site in recent memory! The only variation from the recipe was that I turned them halfway through and then left them uncovered for the last 25 minutes. Great recipe, thanks!

I liked this recipe a lot - but there are some things I did change and will change the next time I make this dish.  To the cracker crumbs I added a little Old Bay seasoning, omitted the salt and added fresh ground pepper.  At the advice of other reviewers I reduced the amount of butter used (only about 1/4 - 1/3 cup) and we found this to be plenty; I also uncovered during the last 20 minutes or so of baking time.  I used boneless butterflied chops, but I think next time I will use bone-in pork chops and after uncovering, I will flip the chops because this was the only thing we didn't like about this dish....the bottoms of the chops were very soggy and unappetizing.  Apart from that, they had very good flavour and I will make them again.

These were good.  You do need to season the cracker crumbs to get a good amount of flavor.  I also broiled them to get them to become a little more crispy....and they really didn't.  I liked the taste and they turned out very tender.  Thank you for the post.

My family loves this recipe. My husband commented on them without my having to ask him. I did make the following few changes: spray dish...use olive oil instead of butter(and not a lot)...turn halfway through cooking. **suggest using club crackers for breading.** great taste.

Tried this recipe last night and my kids and husband loved it! I cooked for half the time covered then cooked the remainder of the time uncovered and then broiled for 5-7 minutes at the end. I also sprayed the dish with non-stick veg spray and cut the butter down to 1/4 cup but was still a bit too greasy.I also added Italian seasoning to the cracker crumbs. Will definetely use again. Thanks for sharing the recipe.

Best pork chops!  So tender too.  A family favorite.  They pretty much liked the plate!  I used garlic powder instead of salt, used a little less butter and baked at 400.

This was my first attempt making pork chops & they were tasty :) I did read a lot of reviews and glad I did I went with what reviewers were saying about uncovering for last 15 min my chops were still not as crispy as I hoped but there was no lack of flavor in any way , I did also go with using garlic powder and seasoning salt I went bone in option my husband loved them and my 1 1/2 yr old daughter kept screaming more more !!!!! We will be making these again very soon thanks for all the reviewers tips.

thinner chops, cooked for 35 min, could have cut time another 5-10 min, a little dry, but good flavor.

Didn't really light us up.  It was OK, but nothing to rave over.  The butter makes it soggy (even uncovered for the last 15 minutes).  Don't mean to be overly critical, it's just that there are lots of recipes on here that bring something special to the table.

Made these with some suggested changes... like baking without covering and adding less butter. We liked this recipe pretty good, but next time I think I will use some other seasoning besides garlic salt (even though I generally like garlic salt.) Really liked the butter crackers used as crust.

This was delicious.  I cut down on the butter as suggested by others.   My husband enjoyed this and he is not a big fan of pork chops,  being they are usually dry.  These were moist and tender.  Yay!

I really enjoyed these. They came out perfect for me. I put the butter around the pork chops, not on top at all. I also used thick pork chops and butterflied them.

They were so extremely easy to make and sooooo delicious and moist. I made a few minor changes to the recipe though. I only needed 2 eggs, cut the butter down to about 1 tbsp and instead of butter crackers, I used Italian seasoned bread crumbs. Delicious!

I am sorry.  We did not like this at all. I think it was all the buttery flavor - from the buttery crackers, and all the BUTTER added to PORK CHOPS. I don't often give out bad reviews, but this was BAD.  I gave it 2 stars because it was : 1. very  2.  easy

I love this recipe! I am very sensitive to spices this recipe had plenty of flavor with no problems. I did add crushed seasoned croutons to the ritz crackers and broiled the top for 3-5 minutes after original cooking time was complete. Thanks for the great start to a wonderful dinner.

Not the greatest ever, but pretty good.  Very simple.  The amounts specified in the directions worked for 7 pork chops, one-inch thick. Covered the pan with foil and did not check during baking.

Not that flavorful but crispy, tender and juicy.  My boyfriend said he really like the coating and I did too once dipped in ketchup!  I dredged in seasoned flour, then egg and coarsely crumbled ritz with Lawry's seasoned salt.  I dotted with softened butter (probably only used a tablespoon or two for two chops) Put on Silipat and baked at 400 for ten minutes, flipped, dabbed with more butter on underside and baked 10 minutes more.  Broiled each side a couple of minutes to crisp up.  Total oven time was 25 minutes.  Served with seasoned oven roasted potatoes and asparagus.   Also I like to use thin, boneless center cut chops, they turn out tender if you don't overcook the pork.  I'll use this method again, I'll just make sure to doctor the breading up a little bit more.

We really liked this recipe, but am giving it four stars since it needed slightly altered.  I increased baking time to 55 minutes, turning chops over after 30 minutes and removing foil.  I placed them under the broiler when done so they would brown up a tad more.  Next time I make these I will add some garlic powder to the mix.  More garlic salt would be too salty.  Don't decrease the butter as others have done, especially if you plan to remove the foil at the end.  My kids loved these too :-)

Followed recipe to a T other then using garlic butter ritz. If I had not switched it to broil at the end and flipped them they would have stayed soggy..but they are yummy and all 4 kids and husband loved them. Will make again ( I didn't use all the butter.. forgot about that)

This was delicious.  I removed the tin foil cover after 25 minutes, however the butter hadn't even completly melted.  I ended up cooking the 4 pork chops for about 55 mintues.  And cooked them with the fan oven on for the last 8 minutes or so.

This dish was very tasty.  The only changes I did were to use only 1 egg, 1/4 cup butter and bake at 425 degrees for 16-22 mins.  I also turned the chops when they were half way through cooking.  To crisp, uncover the last 15 mins.

I mde this tonight for my family, followed the directions to a T, but the cracker coating was soggy.  The pork chop itself tasted good, but you had to scrap the coatig off.

I made this recipe using wild pork chops and it came out better than I could have hoped.  Extremely tender and delicious.  Cant wait to try it again.

Very tasty!  Not as crispy as I was hoping for, but really delicious.  The flavor of the crust was really buttery and delicious, and the pork was cooked perfectly (because nothing's worse than undercooked pork).  I will probably make again, but maybe use less butter so they stay a little crunchier.

Disappointing. Crust was mushy and flavorless. Chops were overcooked. Only thing that saved this was a can of cream of mushroom soup for dipping.

I loved the cracker crust! It really held in the moistness of the pork chop. I wish I could figure out how to keep the bottom from being mushy. It was still very good. Definitely going to make this again.

This is hands down my favorite recipe from Allrecipes. It's so easy, but SO good. My husband and kids ask for this all of the time and it's always gone in no time! I make it exactly as written, no changes. It's to die for!

We used bone-in chops and they came out dry, tough and soggy. Was very disappointed with this mediocre recipe, not worthy of 5 stars by any means.

This was amazing and so easy!  I actually didn't have eggs on hand, so I used light sour cream to coat the chicken before I dipped it in the cracker crumbs.  I didn't use as much butter as called for.  YUM!

Soggy breading and not enough taste either. I also found 3 eggs was too much, 2 would do. Butter was overpowering so that would have to be cut way back. Burned to the pan so I would suggest spraying Pam on your baking sheet. Disappointing recipe as written.

Very easy and basic recipe. You can add whatever spices to the cracker crumbs for individual tastes.  I added about 1/2-1 tsp of italian spice to the crackers and cut the butter in half. Didn't use all the crackers and eggs for 4 chops.  Also baked at about 350 until done (for thicker juicier chops). Also removed cover toward the end. They turned out great and kids loved them!

These turned out pretty yummy!  Turned them after 20 minutes and then took the foil off with 15 minutes left.  Might try to take the foil off even earlier the next time.  And only used 2 Tbsp of butter in the pan.

Even I couldn't mess this up! I am a notorious 'jerkifier' of all oven meats.  These pork chops turned out juicy and tender.  It was EASY and so delicious.  I'm so glad to finally have a good pork chop recipe.

Against my better judgement, I covered the pork chops like the recipe said.  Big mistake.  They were ridiculously soggy and unappetizing.  I tried to salvage them by putting them under the broiler for a few minutes.  We ate them, but I was very disappointed.

For the breading, I used a 50/50 ratio of crushed up vegetable ritz crackers and plain bread crumbs because that was all I had on hand.  Following the rest of the recipe, it turned out really good.

People, it did not say to put butter on top, it said around the pork chops.  
This was a good version to serve a different pork chop.  Yummy

I've always been wary of making pork chops, they just never turn out good for me.  Well, I was told by my family that this is THE recipe for pork chops - thank you so much!

PERFECT!  So easy and so good.   I used Ritz crackers crumbled and flash-fried on each side before putting them in the baking dish.  They were unbelievably juicy and tender and were not mushy at all.  A definite keeper!

Had to rate via stars but not even one stars.  This was pure mush.  Why oh why did I listen and cover for cooking??  Not one little bit crispy, totally mushy breading. Beyond disappointing.

I loved the flavor.  I did find that 2 eggs were more than enough.  I put the crackers in a zip-lock bag, sealed it and rolled over the bag with my rolling pin to easily crush the crackers, opened the bag and added the garlic salt and black pepper. After coating the chops, I put each one in the bag and tossed them to coat.  Easy to do and eliminates an extra bowl to wash.  Then just toll the bag and remaining crumbs.  I did them one at a time to make sure each got a good coating.

These pork chops are super easy and delicious! I love that there are few ingredients and all things I keep in the pantry. I used the ritz crackers which gave the pork a delicious flavor.  I only used about 1 tablespoon of butter for 2 pork chops, way lower in fat and still awesome flavor.  Also cut back on the eggs. Next time I will probably mix it garlic powder instead of garlic salt, with the Ritz crackers they seemed a little salty.  Great recipe that I will use again and again.

this was great. my wife loved it and it was simple to make, but I changed the recipe instead of egg i used olive oil and also coconut oil instead of butter. Since we have egg and dairy allergy in our house.

I made this tonight exactly as stated but I'm guessing my boneless pork chops were too thick because they did not fall apart so if I try it again I will make sure they are much thinner.

a fantastic recipe.  The family just loves it.  I also use Ritz crackers, tried several others but I think these work the best.  Nice and easy.  for a little extra zip, I add a pinch of cayenne to the egg mixture.

This is really good!  I used 6 thin sliced pork chops and 1/4 cup of butter.  I think next time I will cook them a little less or use thicker slices.  My husband who doesn't like pork chops that much LOVED them!

i didn't have the time to read the reviews and just trusted the recipe as written and my pork chops were super soggy. the flavor was good, but i think the recipe needs to be adjusted to remove the foil the last 15 minutes so someone doesn't have to read reviews to get good results.

My family loved this.  I couldn't use eggs because my son is allergic so I dipped my pork chops in buttermilk first and I did take the cover off for the last 15 minutes of cooking so they would be a little crispy.  I will be making this again!

very easy to make!  I didn't have any crackers on hand, so I crushed up some seasoned croutons, and then added a little more seasoning (we like alot of flavor!).  I used some leftover herb butter that I had made previously in place of regular butter...yummy!    Like other reviewers, I would also recommend placing under the broiler for a few minutes after baking.

Finally! A recipe that stands up to its review! SOOOO yummy.Everybody LOVED it and it was easy to make and easy to remember the recipe (I hate always having to re-look it up) I did flip them twords the end to get that crunchy texture on both sides. This will added to the list of regular dinners in this house.

Simple and delicious! I put the butter on top of the pork chops; no they weren't what I would call crispy but they were very tasty. I used the generic version of Club Crackers, with some garlic powder and seasoned salt. My pork chops were thick cut boneless and they were tender and we enjoyed this recipe very much!

These were pretty good but not sensational.  I made them just like the recipe said to, except uncovered them the last 20 min.  You couldn't taste the Ritz crackers in the crust, like you'd like to.  The bottom was soggy, but not awful.   Don't think I'd make them again.

Wonderfully tender chops. I do think they lack flavor and next time I will add some Lawry's season salt to themand/or consider marinating before breading them.

I give this 4 stars because I changed this recipe. I brushed the chops with Ranch Dressing. Then coated in saltines, italian seasoned bread crumbs, seasoned salt, and lemon pepper. Baked uncovered at 375 for 50 minutes. Good flavor.

I agree with previous posters.  Only use 1/2 the butter and 2 eggs is plenty for the coating.  I added Lawry's salt and garlic powder to the cracker crumbs.  I cooked uncovered and broiled at the end to give the chops color.  These were so good!  Both of my kiddos raved and they don't usually care for meat.  I normally don't care for pork chops but I loved these!

Simply yummy! Made it according to the directions and it was great. Next time I made it I did some standard family tweaking to the breading process.  To the eggs I added a touch of milk and 1 TBSP or so of Mustard. Mustard adds a slight tang. To the bread crumbs I added italian seasonings and changed the garlic salt to garlic powder because bread crumbs with sodium and so does butter. Whether you follow the directions or tweak it....you can't go wrong with this recipe.

So easy & so good! I made these last night & took the advice of some previous posts & removed the covering during the last few minutes of baking so that the breading would be crisp & also reduced the butter to 1/4 cup. I added a bit of onion power to the breading mix as well. The family loved it & has already requested that I make this again next week!

Followed directions to the  "T" and it came out wonderful, flavorful and the meat was tender and juicy. I did use Ritz crackers.

Wasn't all that impressed...followed the recipe exactly. Wasn't what I expected with all the great reviews. Baked for 35 minutes and was definitely done by then, 45 minutes would have been too long.

Made these as suggested with half the butter...they were ok, but I wasn't really impressed. I didn't find that the ritz crust had much flavor, but I didn't have garlic salt so I added garlic powder and salt (maybe not enough?)

These were good, but not good enough to justify adding 1/2 cup of butter!   I dont think I'll make them again.     I prefer using egg whites and seasoned bread crumbs with no added fat.

I made this pork chop and my boyfriend loved it!!! I didn't have the butter cracker so I use seasoned (garlic & herbs) croutons instead. I also didn't use butter (we are trying to eat healthy) but instead use a little bit of olive oil to grease the baking pan. The last 10 minutes of baking, I switched to broil to get rid of the mushyness. It was a hit! The pork chop came out really tender and mouth watering. My boyfriend keep saying how much he loved it. I'm making this again tonight per his request :)

These were okay, but not really my cup of tea. They were a bit too soggy. I liked the "Baked Pork Chops I" recipe more. I did rate it 3 stars because I'm not big on pork chops to begin with and because my family did seem to enjoy them. To me, they are fine but nothing spectacular.

Very moist, but I felt that the coating was lacking spice.  Next time I'm going to add some either crushed rosemary or sage.

This was fabulous! My husband loved it! Read some of the reviews and did little to change. Since I was fixing only 2 pork chops and they were thick, I melted a TBS of butter in my dish, added pork chops and covered. Removed cover after 30 min. and turned chops over in dish and cooked for 15 min. more.  That helped lower butter used. Will make this many more times! and pass on to my kids!

These were definitely good. Based on other reviews, I only used two eggs, which was plenty, and I added more spices. Also wish I would have cut back the butter. Used center cut boneless chops and they came out pink, which confused me as I always thought they should have been white when done. I did a little research and found a couple of sites that says pink is still okay, as long as the internal temp is at least 145 degrees (it used to be 160 degrees).

This was the BEST pork chop I ever had! It was so juicy and not a bit tough. I used bone-in chops which probably helped with moisture. I also used crushed seasoned croutons for more flavor/crunch. I uncovered the dish after 25 min., turned the chops and cooked for 20 min., then switched to a low broiler for the last 10. PERFECT!

Uhm... these were ok.  This is a very basic concept, but definitely needs some alterations to be a '5'.  For this go 'round, I only used 1 egg and 4 tbsp of butter.  Next time, I will definitely uncover for the last 10 or 15 minutes... followed as is results in soggy chops.  Also, I used pork steaks and could've pulled them out after 35 minutes of baking - 45 minutes was too long.  Better luck next time!

I was unhappy with this dish. From the reviews I expected something really great but all I got was a pork chop with ritz crackers on it. Not much flavor. I did follow the recipe to a T and they did come out crisp and juicy but the flavor just isn't there. My husband did not really like them either. Not bad enough to eat but I will not be making this again.

These are great. I have changed the type of crackers used to what I have on hand and they are always good. I don't think I use as much butter, but I only make two pork chops when I make them.

Disappointing.  Coating was so soggy and chops were too dry and not flavorful.   Maybe if I had baked uncovered instead of covered as the recipe said, the coating would have been crispier.  Don't know what the purpose is of all that butter. I followed the recipe exactly.

I didn't have Ritz, so used seasoned bread crumbs. Used Garlic powder and onion powder, season salt, and a few "Bams" of Emeril's seasoning.  I put half these seasonings in the egg wash and 1/2 in the crumbs. Used 1/2 the butter around rather than ontop.  I also "double dipped" the chops - egg/crumbs/egg/crumbs. Baked covered for 25 mins. (4 1 in boneless) and 20 uncovered then 2.5 min each side under broiler. I make pretty good pork chops anyway but everyone LOVED these.  Can't wait to try with the flavored Ritz like other reviews.

I'm sorry but, I didn't think these were good at all. They really lacked flavor and turned out very soggy, I'm guessing too much butter. I was hoping they would have been a lot crispier. We have leftovers that will just go to waste. Oh, and 3 eggs was way too much, 2 would have been plenty.

Very easy to make. Only used 2 eggs and cut the butter in half. It helps to place one pat of butter on top of each pork chop. Good alternative to country fried steak. They turned out moist and tasty and are versatile. You can do a lot with this recipe. I drizzled with homemade honey mustard (dijon, honey, and balsamic vinegar) and topped with some cooked apples and onions and these were fabulous. I wonder if this would work as well with chicken.

I give this a five for great flavor and great texture. I did make some healthy alterations - I seared the breaded chops in olive oil, then baked uncovered for 20 mins, flipped and baked another 20 minutes (turning the heat up to 375 during last ten mins for extra crispy texture.) This eliminated the need for butter and prevented sogginess as some reviewers mentioned. Thanks for sharing!

I made this recipe exactly as written the first time. My family loved them, but the coating didn't stick well. After reading the reviews, and using  my own experiences, I changed 2 things. 1 -- I let the chops set out for 1 hour first to come to room temperature and then for 30 minutes after I breaded them. These tips will help coating stick to anything -- chops, wings, etc.  2-- I uncovered them for the last 15 minutes, as suggested by other reviewers.  Perfect coating, great taste! A winner for winter!

I used boneless center cut chops, about 3/4" thick. Overcooked the first time.  Second time, I cooked them at 350F for one hour - perfect. Used cracker crumbs and half the butter.  Also flash fried them first.

I was in a hurry so didn't read other reviews which I should have because I didn't care for this at all.  The pork chops were tough and the breading was mushy.

These were a hit! I "flash browned" them on the stovetop before baking. They were nice and tender and had a lot of flavor! Thanks!

My Husband LOVED these. They are very good. I also reduced the amount of butter & uncovered for the last 15 mins. Served with garlic mashed potatoes.

Really good, I cut the butter down a bit and flipped them once or twice during baking, to get them a little crispier I even broiled them a bit on each side.

Such pork chops! I was afraid of them being too salty with the addition of garlic salt to the Ritz crackers, but I decided to trust the recipe and it was no problem. I added a few shakes of onion powder to the cracker mix too. Also follow the suggestion of some others and broiled on one side for a few minutes to get crispy. They were still very moist and delicious, even though I thought my chops were a bit on the thin side. This will probably be my standard recipe for pork chops from now on.

Not bad, but not good.  If you grew up with dried out chops, this will be amazing, but if you already knew how not to dry out a chop, this is super boring.  Sorry, but there wasn't must to this.

These were excellent.  I did take some previous advice and use less butter, Ritz crackers and put them under the broiler for 5 minutes after they were done

I had made these chops awhile ago, and forgot to review. These are basic baked breaded chops, I didn't think they were anything great. I do think more herbs and seasonings should be added to the crushed crackers, and all that butter is not necessary. My chops were soggy when done, so I had to let them bake uncovered longer, and then use the broiler, and they still were somewhat soggy. I may try this again with some tweaking, thanks for the recipe (:

I'll have to try this recipe again. My chops came out pretty tender (I used a meat tenderizer to smash them since they were pretty thick) but they were not really flavorful- I might try brining them before cooking next time. The crust also was soggy, even though I followed other's advice and removed the foil the last 15 min, and even tried broiling them for a while. Not a bad start though.  I did press some fresh garlic and mixed it in with the crumbs, which was tasty! Next time I think I'll add more seasonings to the crumbs.

I used low sodium saltine crackers which worked just fine. I pan fried the chops (which were about 1 inch thick) on medium heat with a few pads of butter for about 6 min on each side, then finished them off on wire rack in the oven at 375 for 20 minutes.  They came out so moist and tasty, not as crunchy as I hoped, but the cracker coating really sealed in the juices. My roommate keep raving about them! Great and easy way to make pork chops.

I didn't have cracker so I just used bread crumbs and the same cooking method. They were delicious, moist, and buttery.

My husband loved this recipe. I followed it to the T. The only exception is that I pulled the foil off the baking dish when 15 minutes remained (as suggested by other reviewers) for crispiness. I served this with cheesy veggies and coleslaw salad. I will be making these again!

I will make again, but I will only bread one side of the chop.  The bottom was really soggy.  I didnt use all the butter called for, I just "dotted" butter around the chops.  I also threw in some seasoned bread crumbs to the cracker mixer b/c I was afraid it wouldnt be seasoned enuf.  Also, as suggested in other reviews I uncovered towards the end and broiled a bit. I'm thinking if I only bread on side I dont need to use the butter, just spray with non-stick spray. Husband really liked though!  Good idea for boring chops!

This was good but not as good as the Famous Butter Chicken recipe on this site.  It is the exact same except for the meat.  I did halve the recipe and one egg was more than enough for two chops and maybe would've been enough for four.

a good recipe.. I did a few things different.. Used boneless pork chops which were thick  so butterflied them and only used 2 eggs which was plenty as another suggested.. I did not use the butter, I used butter flavored cooking spray and baked uncovered for about 40 45 minutes.. I thought it turned out great and saved some of the fat and very moist and nicely browned Thanks for the post.

This is an excellent recipe.  Forget shake and bake.  We used the Costco 1" boneless pork chops mallet tenderized.  Two eggs is enough for four pork chops and I used Ritz Crackers.  I used garlic powder instead as my family are not big salt users.  I followed some users ideas and took the tin foil off at the last 10 minutes to brown up.  Phenominal recipe.

I tried this recipe again and opted to marinate the pork chops before breading them.  I salt and peppered them, then added fresh chopped garlic and marinated for a couple hours.  Then followed the recipe the same.  Turned out more flavorful.

OMG. I just made this for my 8 year old daughter and 15 year bro. And they loved it. Soooo good. I did take the others advice and took off the cover and broiled it for an extra 15 minutes. I also added some Parmesan cheese to the cracker mixture and used half the butter. Loved this one!

I used 1/2 cup of cheezeit crackers & 1/2 cup of saltine crackers for the crust. When I baked it, I only used 2 tablespoons of butter, that i cut into pieces and placed around the pork chops. I baked it as directed, and it turned out perfect! The crust was not soggy and the meat was very moist. My family was disappointed that I did not have more made for them to eat, and said they definently want me to make this recipe again.

I followed this recipe exactly as written, and like many other reviews, I had a soggy mess.  The only way I salvaged the chops was to take them out and "fry" them to try to get some crisp onto the chops.    Very disappointing.

Soft, tasty, and very easy to make. I had brussels sprouts cooking at 400° so I cooked the chops at this temperature for 45 minutes. The pork chops I had were 1/2 inch thick. Next time I think I'll add some minced garlic.

An amazing recipe. My family usually is not thrilled with pork chops, but they actually begged for this again! The first time I made it, I used considerably less butter than the recipe stated, and I did not cover the dish. It was not soggy at all. The next time, I used more butter and I covered it and it was soggy. I have learned my lesson. Less is better and do not cover!

Pretty good.  Use thicker chops rather than really thin (too dry otherwise). Also, only need 1 or maybe 2 eggs - and half the butter.

Bye-bye Shake & Bake. These were way better and just as easy. My husband even complimented, and that says alot. I did not use all the butter, I just put a few pats here and there. Melt some in the bottom of your dish first our they will stick.

My husband and kids (ages 13,7 and 3) could not stop raving about these. Very easy to make and if I can get my kids to eat them without complaint this recipe certainly deserves 5 stars. The only thing I did differently was to use seasoned bread crumbs instead of the crackers and that was only because I didn't have crackers.

This is a new and refreshing way to do Pork Chops.I reduced the amount of butter in half, and it was still wonderfully tasty.This will be one of those recipes I pass along to family and friends.

I tried this last night and it was great. I thought I was tired of pork chops, because they always seem so dry, but this recipe perked them right up.. Thanks

OMG were those good!  I'm going to try using butter buds instead of butter next time though to cut back on the fat.  Delish!

Easy, fast and great.  I used one sleeve of RITZ Low Sodium crackers and 8 thin center cut pork chops. I did not cover them.  I melted half the butter in a rimmed cookie sheet, placed the chops in and then put a pat of butter on top of each chop.  I also agree with other reviewers, only 2 eggs are needed. Thanks for sharing this recipe!

I love these pork chops! I had downloaded this recipe a long time ago and didn't label it with the copyright info. I was so glad to see it as the recipe of the day so that I can give the correct credit!
I make these all the time. As much as once a week! They are wonderful and easy to make!

This is how I make these pork chops but I steam them and add onion and pepper to season it a little more. After I put them in the egg wash, I fry them in butter for a little bit on each side. Then I put them in heavy duty foil with thick cut onions and peppers, seal the foil and put the whole packet in a baking dish with about a half inch of water in the bottom of the dish. Cover the dish and bake for an hour and a half.  THey do come out a little soggy so I just have to figure out how to fix that.

This was the best pork chop recipe I have ever tried. We are pretty snobby when it comes to food, and these pleased our palates wonderfully. I followed the directions exactly except I didn't measure the butter; I put 2 pats on top of each chop. Also, I uncovered for the last 15 minutes then put them under broil for 5 minutes each side to crisp them up. Delicious!

Not sure why this didn't turn out better. Used crushed croutons & dry Italian dressing mix mixed w/ parmesan cheese - but still flavor was less than expected. Breading worked out great but meat not tender. Good starting point and I'll certainly try again.

This was pretty darned good- I was surprised by how flavorful the crackers were. My 4 year old loved her "chicken" (that's what she thinks all white meat is!) and even the husband ate a whole chop (and he only likes pork if its covered in BBQ sauce!) Very easy recipe and we will make it again.

Delicious recipe!  My husband was a big fan!  I didn't have garlic salt, so I used minced garlic and salt and pepper to taste.  I double dipped the pork chops in the egg and crackers mixture to make sure that they were well coated.  I cut the amount of butter, and only placed a small pat of butter on top of each chop.  I also sprayed the casserole dish with Pam cooking spray, to keep the chops from burning.  I followed the advice of a few other reviewers and turned the pork chops over half- way through the cooking time.  I used the last 3 to 5 minutes of cooking time to place the chops under a broiler.  It made the cracker topping nice and crispy.  Make sure to watch the chops closely while broiling, so that the topping does not burn.

Easy and delicious!  I added some sliced fresh garlic cloves to the butter around the chops.  It came out perfectly roasted and ready to spread on french bread.  My husband was scraping bits off the bottom of the casserole.  I also only nedded 1 egg for 6 chops.

These turned out pretty well. I didn't get them as crispy as I would have liked, and I even took the foil off 15 minutes before I took them out of the oven. (I also turned upthe heat so that they would crisp up...I guess I would hate to know how it would have been otherwise!!) But they still tasted good. My oldest said they were too plain but I think she just wanted to complain. Everyone else had seconds. I did add garlic powder to the crackers as well as lots of pepper. I even added garlic and pepper to the eggs. I thought that they were a nice change from what I normally do with pork chops. I will do again!! Thanks...

This was very good and received raves from my family. Next time I would remove bone from pork chop before placing in oven for easier eating once served on plate. I would also add more seasonings to cracker crumbs for next time. The aroma in the kitchen while cooking was great!

I baked them uncovered on a cookie sheet for about 1/2 an hour. They turned out soggy and tasteless. I tried broiling them to crisp them up but it didn't work out. I wouldn't waste ingredients on this recipe again!!!

We really liked this recipe. I did use extra spices and gave the chops a light coating of flour (also seasoned)before dipping and dredging them in the crackers. I took others' advice and took off the foil for the last few minutes. These were tasty and tender!

the whole family loved these--everyone gave them 5 stars.  by the end of dinner, my husband and daughter were stealing the few bites i had not yet finished right off my plate!  i did go by other reviews and used 1/2 the butter, seasoned the chops before coating (salt, pepper, sage), and uncovered for the last 10 minutes or so.  i think the chops would have been soggy if i hadn't uncovered; as it was, they were perfect.  also, i used whole wheat ritz crackers.  thanks!

We really liked these!  I used 3 pork loin chops & adjusted the recipe accordingly.  I did add some poultry seasoning & seasoned salt (but next time I will add a little more), could of got by with 1 egg (instead of 2), only used 4 T of butter (instead of 6), removed the foil the last 15-mins, & broiled them just a tad after they came out of the oven.  Turned out very crispy for oven-baked!

The familly really enjoyed this.  I used a nice thick cut chop. I didn't cover them, but put them on a cookie sheet sprayed with butter flavor PAM.  I'm giving only three stars because I made so many changes. The orignal seemed bland.  I used more spice in the crackers, I put Old Bay season in the eggs, along with 2tbsp of light mayo.  The crust was excellent. The chops extremely tender.  I used a meat thermometer to check for doneness.  I depise a dry chop.  Thanks for the idea, it was the a good place to start.

These were just "ok" despite adding extra seasoning. The chops were very soggy, so I had to broil at the end to crisp them up.  Good concept, poor execution. If I made again, I would season crackers even more & reduce the butter by at least half. Honestly it really wouldn't even be the same recipe anymore. Sorry.

In my husband's words, "These pork chops rock!"  They were delicious and easy to prepare.  I did what a couple of other reviewers suggested and broiled them the last ten minutes of cooking, and I was glad I did because it made them a bit crispy.  I also used a small amount of butter, rather than what was called for.  So good!  Thank you

I'm not a huge pork chop fan because they're usually either smothered in some sort of sauce or too dry for my liking.  This was a perfect recipe.  Totally juicy and flavorful, great seasoning and so tender.  I did uncover the pan and broil for about 10 minutes right before taking them out of the oven just to brown them up a bit and it was perfect.

Pork chops were quite tasty. Next time I will try it using my larger stone casserole, sprayed with PAM, and a little less butter. As the others stated I took the cover off for the last 15 minutes so they weren't soggy. I also blotted them with paper towels before serving to get excess butter off of them. Good recipe. This also works well on Chix breasts.

My husband and picky eaters loved these. I used 1/2 sleeve of Keebler Club crackers and 1 cup of Caeser croutons crushed together to dredge the pork chops in and 2 eggs as was suggested. I cooked them for 35 min covered and then uncovered for add'l 10 min. Turned out great. Will cook again.

My husband and I loved this recipe. It was delicious! My husband always told me he would never eat pork chops. So when he sat down he thought he was eating chicken because it was so moist and then I told him it was pork and he could not belive it! Will definitely make again!

This was not a very tasty recipe at all.  It was extremely greasy in the pan, and the breading did not have much flavor and I even added a little italian seasoning.  The crumbs never got crisp.  It was just a big soggy mess.  I followed the recipe exactly, but I still could have screwed it up somehow.  Thanks for the recipe anyway.  I will continue looking for a good basic pork chop recipe.

These chops were excellent and very moist.  Before dipping in the egg, I seasoned mine with Lawry's, garlic and onion powders.  I also layered the bottom of the pan with sliced onion which added a lot of flavor.  However if you do that, I recommend uncovering the chops for the last 20 minutes and then broiling for a crispy coating.

Great recipe!  Fast and EASY!
I give this a five because my husband said it was the best pork chops he has ever had.  I thought they were pretty good too.  Next time I will uncover them the last 10 or 15 minutes to make the crust a little crunchy.

The name of this recipe doesn't suit it at all.  Neither I or my family cared for these pork chops.  They didn't have much taste and were just too soggy.  I will not make this one again.

Very Moist - EXCELLENT flavors.  I used bread crumbs rather than crackers and also broiled the dish for the final five minutes.  Will make this again and again.

This was pretty good.  Definately easy.  I think it might be prettier if you uncovered it for the last fifteen minutes to let it brown.  I used about a quarter of the recommended butter.

These are really good.  I usually add a teaspoon or so of Worcestershire sauce to the eggs, and it adds just a little more flavor.  I also season my chops before dipping in the eggs.  All in all, this is a keeper.  Thanks!

These were great.  A little salty, I only had salted crakers on hand and I think that's what did it.  I only used a small amount of butter on each chop, about 1/2 pad for each.  For the last 5-10 minutes of cooking, I uncovered them, sprayed butter pam on them and they had a crunchy top.  So moist, would make these again with unsalted crackers.

I coudln't believe how well this turned out and I was impressed by how fancy it looked.  I cut back the oven time by 10 minutes, because my chops were the cut thin.   It was moist and delicious.

Excellent. I used boxed bread crumbs, because that's what I had on hand. They were fork tender. I wasn't looking for crispness, because I prefer then soft. Everyone pigged out; pun intended.

This recipe was delicious. The only thing I did differently was season the porkchops before dipping in egg mixture but I still added the garlic salt and pepper to the crushed crackers. Amazing. Will definitely make again. So easy

Delicious! Very tender and quick and easy. I pressed fresh garlic and used bread crumbs instead of cracker crumbs, but very tasty.  Also I took the cover off the pan about the last 10 minutes so the breading gets a little crispier.

This was great! I could cut the chop with a fork, literally! I turned it halfway thru, and finished it under the broiler. I won't fry pork chops again.  Thanks.

This is so easy to make and absolutely delicious.  You do want to take the chops out of the pan right away though as they will get soggy.  I soaked my chops in a brine if 1 cup milk/1/2 Tablespoon of salt for an hour before cooking.  Melt in your mouth!

This is my second time making this recipe. I have to say the only thing I didn't do the second time around was cover the chops. I put them on a non stick metal cookie sheet with sides. They were crispy on the outside and moist and tender on the inside. No knife required here. You may want to leave off the salt. The Ritz have plenty already. Made with fresh green beans and scalloped potatoes from this site. YUMMY!

Just tried this recipe and worked like a charm!! I didnt have to change anything in this recipe except for time, I had lean chops so I had shorten baking time to 18 minutes in total flipping at the 12 minute mark and then broiling for the last 2 minutes! These came out delicious crispy outside and then so tender and juicy in the inside! I paired the chops with AK Grown Yukon Gold Sour Cream Mashed Potatoes, and fresh pan seared Zucchini out of the garden! Great Recipe will def be a recipe I use for years and years to come! 

The only thing next time I will use 2 eggs didn't like having so much egg waste afterwards!

I of course read the reviews as I always do before I make a recipe on this site.  So I followed all of the helpful suggestions: reducing the butter, uncovering the last half of bake time, and putting under the broiler to brown both sides at the end.  Personally I thought the breading was awful.

I am not a big fan of pork chops but I LOVED this recipe.  I followed some of the other reviewers advice and went down to 2 eggs.  Also taking off the tin foil for the last 15 minutes made this meal amazing!  Highly recommend!

Didn't use any butter, and it came out tender, moist, and delicious! Next time, I'll broil the chops, uncovered, for a few minutes since the breading was a little soggy. Still detectible! :)

2 eggs were enough to coat the chops. I thought the bottom was soggy from sitting in the butter. They did not get especially tender. Not worth the extra calories and fats by cooking them in butter. I would not make these again

this was a great idea! I used it with my pork steaks. I hate frying! They were really moist covering them up with foil and browning later. Very flexable!

Good, simple recipe.  I made it exactly as written the first time, but substituted panko bread crumbs the second time.  We like them much better with the panko crums...adds a great crunch!

This is my go-to recipe for pork chops, the whole family loves it.  I have used both butter crackers and saltines, we prefer saltines. Also, I use maybe 1/8 cup butter at the most. I slice it thinly and drop throughout the pan... a stick of butter is unnecessary and way too much.  Delicious!

I did the recipe as directed and while I did like the flavour, I too found the bottoms of the pork chops to be mushy/soggy. I believe this to be because of the amount of melted butter that sat on the bottom of the dish didn't allow it to bake crisp on the bottom. Other than that tastey and would try again with some experimentation to fix the soggy bottom issue.

Use 1 Tbls of Butter for each chop.  Cook time was more than recipe, but they were mostly frozen when I put them in.  2 eggs instead of 3.  I cooked 8 chops.

I put it in the oven without covering it for the first 15 mins -  you pregnancy brain!! then I covered it for the remaining 30. So, they came out a bit tough and soggy...I used ritz crackers and I think the garlic salt was a bit too much salt for me on top of the salt on the crackers. So all in all, not sure I will make this one again. But thanks for putting it on!!

I have always had trouble getting my pork chops to be tender. We had this tonight and it was really moist & tasty! I only had panko on hand, baked as directed, and put the dish in the broiler for a few minutes to brown the tops.. Making this again! Thank you! :)

This was the first thing I have cooked in years. I followed the directions with the exception of reducing the butter amount by 1/2. I also flipped the chops halfway through and took off the foil with about 10 minutes to go. They were a tiny bit soggy, but it really didn't matter. The flavor was excellent and they were done just right at 46 minutes. Chops were 3/4-1" pork loin chops. The exciting thing was I didn't have to dip them in ketchup like I usually have to when I eat pork chops!

I made this last night, and we loved it!  My man said it melts in your mouth... and it DOES!  I had huge 1 inch thick bone in chops, so I did them at 350 for 1 and 1/2 hours then let them rest, still covered for 15 minutes.  Everything else exactly as the recipe says.  It was the best pork chop I ever ate!  Will make this again and again!

This is a wonderful recipe but you've got to cut down on the butter!!!!! My pork chops were extremely soggy!!!! I would cut it by atleast half if not more!

Used 3 pork chops, 1 egg, no butter, garlic powder, salt, pepper and italian seasoning mixed in with the crackers. Took other peoples advice and cooked uncovered for the last 15 minutes. The coating was nice on the top but soggy and gross on the bottom, even without the added butter. Pork chops were dry and tough. Flavor was good but all in all a disappointment.

Great taste, Ritz crackers are definitely the best! Wish I'd used half the butter (most of it just ended up melted in bottom of pan, wasted) and wish I'd taken the lid off for the last 15 min! 45 min. was a bit long and they were a bit overcooked. Overall, tasted great.

I added basil, garlic salt, and paprika to the cracker crumbs.  I also uncovered the pork for the last 10 minutes of baking time and it made the coating crunchy.  Delicious!

Made this recipe yesterday, after reading reviews I took the cover off last 15 mins and used 1/2 the amount of butter - but it still came out mucky/soggy, I ended up broiling it for 5 mins to crisp it up. I used Ritz crackers and I did think these made a great tasting topping I just need to find away to cook it without it turning soggy - I think I might try omitting the egg, using even less butter and try pan frying as I  found the meat to be tough.

I tried this recipe for the first time today after receiving it in my email subscription a month or two ago.  My husband is very finicky about changing a recipe if we have one we like ("If it ain't broke, don't fix it.") but he took the porkchops to work for his lunch and he gave me the thumbs up!!!!  Definitely stick to using 1/2 the butter than the recipe calls for.

The ritz crackers make this dish! The only change I made was using a FOURTH of the butter! It just doesn't need that much butter. It didn't get very crispy on the outside even though we uncovered it the last 10 minutes but it was still good.

This is the first time I made the recipe and I followed it exactly. The pork chops came out so beautifully and tasted great. It was the perfect cooking time but we also had thick pork chops. If I use thinner pork chops I don't know if it would have come out as good so if I try I will update.

I had 3 pork chops and used one egg.  I used 1/4 cup of butter and it still came out too soggy, even after broiling it.  The meat itself was tender but the breading was wet and stuck to the pan.  If I try this again, I will use even less butter and maybe leave it uncovered the whole time?

Loved these. So easy and I usually have crackers hanging around to make it. Be sure not to over do it on the butter so they don't get soggy... I made that mistake once.

I made this tonight.  It was wonderful.  I agree with some of the others to uncover for the last 15 minutes, and to turn the chops halfway into the cooking time.  I do love garlic, but I did not enjoy it in this recipe.  I plan on making it again next week with no garlic salt.  I am also going to pair it with a apple/cranberry/raisin dipping sauce that goes great with pork.  Thanks for sharing this.  My husband and I both loved it!!

Excellent recipe! I used 1 inch thick boneless chops so I ended up baking mine for nearly an hour. The last 10 minutes I changed the oven to broil and uncovered and wrapped some fully cooked bacon around each chop.  Delicious. Next time, I think I will marinate the chops the night before in Italian dressing to give the actual meat more zest, but the coating turned out nice and crispy and yummy!

Put these in the skillet with a little butter before putting them in the stove. Took an extra 15 mins to cook so the crust was not soggy even with the skillet browning. 
Tasty enough to eat without a sauce.

These were great, I made with Ritz crackers.  My chops were thick, I baked in a 350 oven about 45 min covered and they pere perfect.  We all loved this recipe, also we had good chops.

Came out too soggy. Probably should have removed the foil towards the end as some commenters mentioned. Probably won't be making this one again.

These are great, my family said, these are the best pork chops I've made.  I followed the recipe almost exactly except for the actually baking.  I baked these on a cooling rack over a sheet tray, lined the sheet tray with foil for easy clean up.  I placed the butter on top of the chops after I coated them with the Ritz crackers (I did not use 1/2 cup.  I just used a few pats of butter on top).  I covered with foil, and took foil off for the last 10 minutes to brown.  No sogginess whatsoever.

Very tasty!  The family really liked them.  Here's what I did, I used boneless chops and added a little parmesan to the coating.  I only used 2 eggs and that was still too much.  I baked them for 20 mins and then uncovered them, turned them over and baked them for another 20 mins.  They were nice and crispy on the top but mushy on the bottom.  I will definitely make them again and when I do I will use less butter.  Still a great recipe just needs a little tweaking to get them crispy all over.  Thanks Haulbur!

Family really liked this recipe. I cooked it exactly as specified but covering the pork chops while baking made the cracker coating soggy. Next time, might cook covered for the first 20 minutes then uncover for the last 25 so that the crust is crispier. The flavor was delicious, though.

In all honesty, I would give this a 3 1/2.  It was good, but for my tastes, too much butter--I think you could use 1/4 cup and still get great flavor.  And the garlic just threw off the butter flavor, an herb such as sage or thyme would have been a better flavor combo and not have distracted from the buttery flavor of the cracker crumbs.  I also seasoned the meat with salt and pepper before dipping--pork is bland to leave it to seasoning the crumbs alone.

Family loved this recipe - I butterflied the pork chops as they were quite thick and cooked them for 20 min on one side 20 on the other and then took them out and put them on a cooling rack over a cookie sheet to bake them for an additional 10 min.  They were not soggy and had a nice flavor!

Tried this baking method instead of my usual slow fry in a little olive oil. Should have known not to mess with perfection. The flavor was there, but coating turned out mushy, especially on the bottom. My family missed the delicious golden crunch.

Made these pork chops per the recipe with only two small modifications (I reduced the butter to 1/4 cup and added Italian seasoning ). The pork chops turned out juicy but I did not grease my casserole dish so the cracker coating pulled off the bottoms. The pork chops turned out ok but wasn't a big hit. Not sure if I will make them again.

I have changed nothing about this recipe!  The pork is always so tender and juicy and so much flavor.  I know it's a full fat recipe, but sometimes it's worth it for the extra flavor!

I used saltines and Italian breadcrumbs since it's what I had on hand. I was just doing two pork chops, and 1 egg was plenty. They were good flavor and moist; my husband isn't usually a huge pork chop fan, but said he liked these!

ABSOLUTELY AMAZING! I made it for my boyfriend because pork chops is his favorite dish. I had never made pork chops before and was very intimidated and tried to just find a simply recipe that I thought I could handle.... He LOVED IT!!! I used about half of the butter. I flipped the pork chops at 20min and uncovered them 30min into it. i took it out after 40min then put it on a cooking sheet sprinkled the left over RITZ CRACKERS mix, sprinkled some seasoning salt, and some Italian bread crumbs. Put it back in the oven for 5min uncovered... I served it with mac and cheese and green beans.... AN ABSOLUTE SUCCESS according to my boyfriend. Will definitely make again!!

So good! I added parsley flakes and used minced garlic instead of garlic salt.  Also used multigrain Saltines. I turned them halfway, used half the butter, and only one egg.  I uncovered it 15 minutes before it was done, and they were not soggy at all.    Delicious!  This was the first time I've ever made pork chops, and my husband wants them more often now.  :)

Had to substitute buttered bread crumbs for the crackers, but they turned out wonderful just the same. Next time I make this, I'm planning ahead and getting some Ritz to do it with! Loved it. The flavor and texture of the chops was great.

I carefully read all the comments and tried the tips (cut half the butter, flips the chops--tried to, and broiled last minute).  The chops still turned out soggy.

This is a really awesome way to make pork chops. I doubled the recipe and also baked for 1 1/2 hours because we had 8 chops that were 1 1/2 inches thick. This is really worth trying.

Very tasty!!  I took the advice of other reviewers and only used half the butter and they turned out perfectly.  Thanks for an awesome recipe!

I sorta messed up and mixed the eggs into the cracker mix but it worked really well. In fact I think the pork stayed more moist because I slathered the chops in the mixture and left it on while it baked. Yum!

My daughter didn't really care for them but me and my hubby liked it. Nothing to complain about because this was a stress free dish. I followed other advices and cut down on the butter and uncover for the last 15 min.

Very easy and tasty.  Better with spice addition into the cracker mix.  Also added a bit of water with the eggs.  PLENTY of cracker mix and eggs for the recipe amount. Prob reduce the amount next time.

These pork chops are great! They were easy and delicious. My only (minor) complaint is that the coating wasn't very crunchy, so next time I'll try what the other reviewers suggested and uncover it for the last fifteen minutes or so. Otherwise I loved them and will definitely make them again!

I loved this recipe. Used Ritz crackers, added some adobo Goya to the cracker mix and used less butter. I followed some of the other reviews and uncovered the dish 20 min before. Turn out great. My husband and two years old loved it as well. Thank you for the recipe is a keeper.

Wow...this was so good!!!  I didn't have garlic salt, so used adobo instead.   The chops were moist and tender; will make it again.

Easy and delicious, what could be better? I used thin cut boneless chopped, which were done in about 30 min. I did not cover with foil and they were nicely browned but not dry at all. My husband is not a fan of pork but he liked these a lot.

I made these last night for supper and it turned out fantatic!  I cut a center loin roast into chops.I did not have crackers, so I used a mix of Panko bread crumbs, regular bread crumbs and some casear bread crumbs that I threw in the food processor until it was crumbs. I also forgot to add the butter (oops...) while baking, so I threw it in after I took the foil off. I also baked my chops for 45 with foil and 15 without. SO good! We could cut them with just forks! I served with honey mustard, it went very well.

Used cornflakes instead of crackers since we had on hand.  Used bone-in pork chops.  Removed foil for last 15 minutes.  Delish!

Delicious!! I am usually not much of a pork eater, but these were so good. I took others advice & turned half way through cooking time & broiled once done to help bring back crunch. stayed very moist!

I made this last night and it was delicious - a big hit with the family.  My chops were just too big and everyone was stuffed - I should've bought the thin chops but they are really good.  As for those claiming that it was a little mushy, you MUST uncover the chops for 10 to 15 minutes so that it can brown on top which will eliminate the mush.  Also, DO NOT USE SALTINE CRACKERS - the recipe calls for a buttery cracker like club house, etc - Saltine's are salty not buttery.  Another thing I would caution is if baking in a glass or steel(aluminum) pan, use foil cause mine stuck to the bottom though I didn't spray it I only put a couple globs of butter on the bottom but it still shouldn't have stuck so use foil on the bottom of your pan and enjoy.

This was delicious! I didn't have any saltines, just a few handfuls of 4 cheese Cheez-its  and some panko crumbs.  I added some Tapatio (Mexican hot sauce) to the egg wash and then after coating stuck in the frig for a few hours to help the crust stick better. I had thin cut chops so they cooked up in about 40 minutes, served with some whipped garlic tatoes and a salad.  Will be making this again soon, thanks for posting!

This turned out very nice and the family liked it. I deviated from the recipe a little (who doesn't?). I sautéed some chopped garlic and browned the outside of the chops in the same pan. I used Italian bread crumbs (didn’t have the crackers) too. Also, three eggs is too many, you can get away with two. I will make this again.

I'm not getting why most people loved this (??).  I thought the general concept of the recipe was good but I didn't like how baking the breaded chops in the baking dish with butter made them soggy.  I think next time I will bake them on a wire rack atop a cookie sheet, spritz with the melted butter and see how that bakes up.  Hopefully not soggy like these turned out.

My bf really loved these. Very tender and flavorful. I admit I used Panko breadcrumbs instead of the butter crackers, so I guess I can't really say how good it was, I assume the butter crackers work well with the butter (duh). I used 2 eggs (more than enough) and 1/4 cup butter (plenty). I also took the foil off the last 15/20 min of baking. I'll try the crackers next time.

Good recipe.  As per other reviews I removed the foil with about 15 mins left to go, but I didn't decrease the butter.  At the end of 45 mins chops were still very soggy. I had to give them another 20 minutes and then I only took them out because I was more worried about the chops drying out before the crust got crispy.  Still the flavor was good and it was super easy.

Loved this recipe!  I am always looking for fast easy ways to prepare meats.  This was perfect.  I will make them again, for sure.  There are a lot of good suggestions for substitutes and can't wait to try them.

Good recipe - I made it the first time following the recipe. Found better success the second time around...you don't need so much egg and butter...I added some garlic powder to the cracker mixture and also placed the pork chops on a sprayed cookie-cooling rack on top of the roasting pan so the chops wouldn't be soggy from sitting in the juices...they came out crispy on both sides...

Wow- these were excellent. I was skeptical due to the small amount of ingredients but they were great. I did follow the recipe exactly with one exception. Other reviewers said to tenderize the pork chops, then coat them in flour before you put them in the egg wash and I think this is what helped the breading stay on. My husband even commented on the fact the breading didn't fall off. It was super moist even the next day after reheating in the microwave. Will definitely be going in my recipe box! Thank you!

Great Pork chops.  I put them in my dutch oven and covered until last 15 mintues.  I uncovered them as others have suggested to crispen them up.  These were tender and moist.  Thanks!

I never liked pork chops, but this recipe is really great! My boyfriend and i don't like the mushroom sauce usually served with pork chops, but cooked this way we eat them plain, and my family pours the sauce over top. I have made this recipe twice and they have turned out great both times! I used less butter, and only 2 eggs to do 12 chops.

Very nice recipe, it needed more seasoning though. I added some garlic, paprika and lemon pepper. Without those spices it would have been pretty bland.

Bland - I had high hopes for this but it was a let down.  I have leftovers - I will probably dump some mushroom soup over it.

Steve loves!!!  Cook at 415 degrees.  Add Parmesan cheese and panko crumbs to cracker crumbs.  Drizzle with melted butter before cooking.  Turn after 15 min - total cook time 28 in - then broil for 4-5 min - Watch!!!

This has really good flavor and the pork chops were very tender but I would have preferred a crispier breading.  Mine turned out soggy.

These were delicious! I didn't have Ritz so I just used saltines and some Italian bread crumbs. I also used boneless pork loin chops. I'm a college student and am learning how to cook. I had two guy friends over to try it and they raved! Thanks a lot for sharing! :)

I let me 8 year old daughter make these (supervised). She used only 2 eggs which was plenty and cut way back on the butter. We put them under the broiler for a couple of minutes after taking out of the oven. This is a great, simple recipe and a good one to play around with in future. My kids loved it!

Delicious! I used boneless pork chops, and sprinkled them with salt before dipping in the egg. I also melted the butter and poured a little on the top of the chops. Cooking time was perfect. My fiancee raves about them and is constantly asking me to make them!

only two medium eggs are needed. i baked it for an additional 25 minutes because it still looked really pink after 45 minutes. use butter substitutes to make it less fatty.

These pork chops were a first for me.  Very tender and very Juicy.  I added one other thing and that was meat tenderizer prior to placing in the egg.  It was excellent!  Be careful on the amount of garlic salt you add though.  It can get quite salty!

I cooked these with only two pork chops.  I cut back on the butter, and used ritz crackers (store brand, actually), I love spice, so I put a bunch of black pepper and garlic salt and these were fantastic.  I'm cooking them for friends tonight!!!

Simple to put together and delicious. My kids ate more of these pork chops than I've ever seen them eat. I used thick "farmer's cut" pork chops from the butcher counter and they came out absolutely perfect.

I covered the baking dish in foil and I think that was my mistake because along with all the butter in the pan the cracker crumbs didn't keep their crispness.  I'd like to try this again sometime and see where I messed up because I like the idea of this recipe, but when I tried it, it was a complete failure!

Very good, my family loved them. Only change I made was to cut down on the butter; 2 Tbsp. was plenty. You might be able to use two eggs instead of three. Thanks for sharing, I will keep this recipe.

These are the most tender pork chops I've ever had the privilege to try. This is a 5 out of 5 rating. It truly doesn't get any better than this. These are great if you are on a tight budget. 2 of these filled my boyfriend! It usually takes 4-5 of the boneless ones to fill hil. I basically fed BOTH of us for about $4, mashed potatoes included! Nothing is better than having a full tummy on such a tight budget! Thank you so much for sharing!

This was a great recipe.  The only changes that I made was that I baked them on a rack and put small slices of butter on the pork chops.  I didn't cover because I wanted the outside to be crispy.

These were so tender and juicy. A little more seasoning and half as much butter and these would be 5 stars.

Tender but not too tender! My boyfriend said I had to make this again :) I actually realized at the last second I didn't have garlic salt, so I used garlic powder, and seasoned salt along with the pepper. Was great!

I have never made pork chops before, so this was a new experience. My husband loved them, and my son who says he doesnt like pork chops, ate them up without knowing!  i added some crushed up cheese crackers and that gave an extra pop.  Awesome!

The Pork Chops I made looked nothing like the picture here.  Mine looked flavorless and raw.  I cooked them for an hour and did not taste or even looked so good.  The coating was soggy, and did not have that golden look.  I was embarrassed serving them to my family.  I know I followed the recipe as noted, (Except for the butter, added olive oil instead, but I'll defenetly give this recipe one last try, with butter this time.

The best pork chops I've made yet! Soooo tender and easy. The next time I may try some different varieties of spices/herbs. Highly recommend this recipe.

I followed the recipe measurements exactly.  The only thing I did different was to add the garlic salt and pepper directly onto the chop before I dipped them in the egg.  That way, the pork chops would be sure to get lots of seasoning.  I used Ritz crackers and I did turn them over once after about 30 minutes, then uncovered for the last 15-20 minutes.  These had a delicious flavor.  My husband raved about this dish and couldn't believe how savory it was.  My dogs feasted on the bones too.  It was all good in our household.  Thanks for a great recipe.

Excellent! - everyone said it was better than grandma's - which is a heck of a compliment.  The only thing I did different was crumble extra crackers for the crust, the amount given was simply not enough.

delicious. mine were not soggy: I seasoned the bone-in chops with seasoning salt and pepper, then dipped in egg, then ritz crackers (added a bit of garlic powder and pepper). I melted 3 tablespoons of butter and placed in on the bottom of a foil lined cookie sheet. Then, I put another few pats of butter around the chops. Baked at 375 for about 30-35 minutes. Perfect!

I used bone-in loin chops that were about 3/4" thick, and followed the recipe exactly. Like others suggested, I uncovered the chops with about 20 minutes left, to crisp them up. My only complaint is that they weren't crispy enough, but had wonderful flavor.

These are by far the best pork chops!! I made them today for dinner and every one at home loved them. One thing I did do was insted of seasoning them with salt and pepper. I seasoned with all purpose seasoning. And I broiled them alittle to make them crispy!! Defenetly a keeper. (I set the oven to 325' to avoid drying them. And keep a good eye on them if u decide to broil) :0)

This recipe has quickly become a family favorite. My kids love it (they never ate much pork for me and now they ask for seconds) and my husband wants me to make it every week! Ritz crackers definitely make this recipe what it is. Well done!

When I told my husband what was on the menu for the night, he promptly told me that porkchops aren't supposed to be breaded. And then he ate one... which turned into three! We both absolutely loved it (and I'm not big on pork!). Next time I'll use one fewer egg though... no sense in wasting anything!

Tender and flavorful.  I used only 2 eggs and still had more than half left, so will only use one egg next time.  Also, had lots of leftover Ritz crumbs, so will use 1/2 as much next time.  I let it broil for about 5 minutes to improve the appearance and crunch factor.

These were very good and very easy to make.  I browned the pork chops briefly before putting them into the oven, and I followed the advice of other reviewers and removed the covering for the last 15 minutes of baking.  I did turn the chops halfway through so that they cooked evenly.  For the breading, I used reduced-fat Ritz crackers and Egg Beaters to help reduce the fat.  I also used half of the amount of butter called for.

At the end, these pork chops need to be broiled so they aren't mushy.  Also - skip the butter.  Makes it too mushy as well.  Just use Pam.  For the last 5 - 10 minutes, uncover and broil, or at least turn the heat up so the breading has the slightest crunch.  Much better that way.

This was great! Thank you for all the reviews too Cause I did marinate the chops in soy sauce and onions for an hour and cut the butter down then cooked the onions in with it with the butter and also flip the chops half way through. Good recipe!!

My husband and I loved these pork chops.  They came out so soft and tender.  Before placing the pork chops in the egg batter though I would season them with Adobo.  They were delicious.

For a healthier option: use wheat crackers, eggs whites, and reduce butter or use olive oil. Still yummy!

Enjoyed these but not knock your socks off enjoyed.  First off save yourself an egg - you don't need 3 and I used a lot less butter (I used smart balance) and melted it and drizzled over the chops.  I did not cover this and still had to put under the broiler for a few minutes to crunch them up....For some reason this works better for me when made with chicken (Famous butter chicken).

This was pretty good.  Easy as can be.  I reduced the butter a bit & flashed the chops in a 450* oven for 10 min.. then baked at 375* for about 20 min... then about 3 min. under the broiler.  They turned out very moist, I think 375* for 45 min. would yield dry chops.  Thanks for the help with dinner!  :o)

I looked at all of the previous comments and suggestions prior to attempting this dish, and I must agree....Ritz crackers are the way to go!  This dish turned out incredible.  (Especially b/c I butterflied the thick porkchops.)  It serves well with sauteed garlic greenbeans.

Wonderful!! The only thing different I did was add a little onion and garlic powders to the cracker crumbs, but even without that, I think these would've been just as good!! My family LOVED them!

We tried this recipe tonight and it was average for us. The breading didn't crisp up, as I had hoped. And they didn't have as much flavor from the garlic or the crackers. We all ate our serving but it wasn't quite what I expected.

I used Ritz crackers, as some of the reviewers suggested, and they were wonderful! The cracker crumbs really made them nice and crunchy. I think next time, however, I'll try baking them in something other than butter because the bottoms of the chops came out saturated in butter.

Very good.  I baked uncovered and would recommend using only 1/2 the butter to help it be a little crunchier.

Love this!!!!!!! I use this breading on chicken as well.  My DH was not a big fan of pork chops until I prepared this dish.  Now he requests them!!!!! The best part is that they are sooo easy!!! Thanx for the great recipe, and making me look like a hero!

These were pretty darn good and I have made them twice already.  I did add some garlic salt to the crackers and that was perfect.  I thought that the recipe called for way too much butter and I only added half and will probably cut that down again next time.  Yes, I think that they can get a little soggy, so be sure to broil them for the last few min to crisp them up.

This was very bland for my taste.  Might make it again, we loved the crunch of the crackers but it definitely needs more seasoning.

Had a friend over for dinner and she and my boyfriend LOVED these. I wanted them to be crispier but they seemed to like them as they were. Cut the butter in 1/2 and added sliced onions on top to bake with the chops. Yum!

Pork chop was very tender.  I was expecting a crunchier crust, but the crackers were just soggy.  I did broil mine for a minute to crisp it up a little.

I love these chops.  I have at this point stopped making other chops.  I don't think you need a full 1/2 cup of butter though...maybe a 1/3 cup or less.  Either way, crust is very yummy and the chops are juicy.

WHy such harsh reviews...let's face it people pork chops are VERY bland.  I thought my chops were very tender! I added salt/pepper, garlic powder, & parm cheese to bread crumbs.  I also tenderized my boneless chops. I buttered the pan before placing chops and placed a tsp of butter to the top of each chop. Cooked covered for time advised. Then uncovered and broiled for 10 mins.

Here's what I did, using the popular recommendations of other reviewers: I pan-fried the pork chops for one minute on each side (to keep chops tender), dipped chops first in egg, then in crushed cheez-its (substitution for butter crackers). I then placed pats of butter around chops (halved the amount of butterin recipe) and then covered pan with foil. I cooked for twenty minutes on one side then flipped chops over. Removed foil for last 15 minutes. I followed all of the recommendations of other reviewers and still my chops were so mushy that NONE of the cracker coating stuck to them. What I was left with was plain, unseasoned porkchops. The only positive note I can make was that they were really tender! Didn't even need to use a knife... I don't know what I did wrong, but I was really disappointed with the way that my dinner turned out!

These pork chops are great. I season the pork chops before dipping in the egg and crackers. Also, melting the butter and then pooring over the breaded pork chops helps out.

I made these with wheat Ritz for my family dinner last week and my entire family just loved them. It's just a little twist on something basic that makes a great meal. We served with mashed potatoes and steamed veggies and it was a great combination.

This was super yummy!! I used regular breading from the grocery store, added garlic powder, Season-All, and black pepper. Browned the meat first and baked for 45 mins on 350. I also used Smart Balance instead of regular butter and it's still super good! Served with white rice and put some of the resulting sauce in the rice. Mmmmm.

I'm not a huge fan of pork, but I tried this recipe to get rid of pork chops in the freezer. AMAZING!!!
This is the best porkchop recipe I've ever had in my life, and I actually crave it. I am making it again tonight. Highly recommended! I only needed 1 egg.
Try this recipe, you won't regret it.

I just found my new "go to" pork chop recipe.  These were so good - my whole family loved them!  I follwed the recipe exactly, except I used only 1/4 cup of butter.  The chops were melt in your mouth yummy.  Thanks for the recipe!

These are so good. I usually don't care for pork chops but these are very tasty. I baked them 25 minutes covered then 20 minutes uncovered. Not soggy at all. Served them with baked sweet potatoes with butter and cinnamon and green beans. Awesome. No more shake and bake for me.

Smelled delicious, breading was delicious, but the meat wasn't nearly as juicy as I expected. I did take the foil off at the end to brown them, so maybe I should have left the foil on longer or something. I will try again!

FANTASTIC RECIPE! I loved this! It was so easy too. I used Whole Wheat Ritz Crackers. I also had 6 thin cut chops instead of 4 thick ones, so I baked them at 350 for 30 minutes and they were absolutely perfect. I also just dotted them with butter, I probably only used about 1 to 2 tablespoons. This will be my new way to make pork chops. Thanks for the recipe!

I used a cast-iron skillet to cook these, and melted the butter in the pan while the oven was preheating instead of adding on top of the chops.  I flipped the chops after 30 minutes and recovered.  I can't say for sure how much butter I used, but it was less than 1/2 cup.  It was wonderful, a nice thick, coating and juicy chops.  I'm making then again tonight. YUM!!!

Very yummy! I used Club Crackers, and a very small amount of butter around the chops but not on top. Cooked 10min then flipped so the bottoms wouldn't be soggy. Cooked another 5min then put swiss cheese on top. Melted and served.

A nice quick meal alternative.  Used boneless pork chops (1/2" thick) and baked for approx 30 minutes.  I only used 2 eggs and found a 1/4 cup of butter was plenty.  I turned half way through to make a bit crisper.  Served with twice baked mashed potatoes from this site.

I made this the other nite for my family, and they liked it, although next time Im going to try ritz crackers instead of saltines, (that was all I had).  Even my picky 8 year old daughter loved it.  I will make this again.

This was a great meal. It was very tasty and I loved the fact that it was so quick and easy to make. I only used about 2 TBS butter to cut back on fat, but it didn't cut back on the flavor!

Really good and very easy.  I took the top off for the last 10 minutes of cooking to give more of a "crust" but only because that's the way we like the.  Very tasty!

YUMMY!!  I will never use Shake N Bake again. These were so good. I used Ritz crackers & only two eggs. I drizzled some butter on the top of each pork chop before baking instead of placing it around them. I baked uncovered on 400 for only 25 minutes. They turned out perfect. They were moist & delicious. These are by far the best pork chops I've ever had!

Loved it. I used thin cut chops, and Keebler Townhouse Crackers. I didnt have a way to print so I winged it. I mixed in equal parts onion and garlic powder with the crackers. I also added salt and pepper to the top. One egg was used since they were thin cut and I only had 4 chops. I baked them covered at 375 for about 10 minutes then at 400 for about 30 minutes. Delicious and crunchy.

Awesome!!  I made this dish for my girlfriend and she absolutely loved it!  I rarely cook due to schedule but I followed recipe and cooked at 400 for 25min (uncovered) as another reviewer recommended and they came out perfect, juicy and tender.  My girlfriend is proud and thanks you/ I thank you.
Can't wait to try my next recipe!

hubby made this tonight.....we all liked it a lot- was a little salty although I have no idea how much he actually put in....he does not normally cook. Could not find garlic ritz- so used the "toppers" crackers with garlic and they worked well.  Also used 1/2 the butter and did melt it and poured over the chops.....they were crispy and not over cooked.

These were just ok for me. I flipped them and uncovered them for the last 15min like other users suggested but they still were a little soggy for me. I used garlic and herb ritz which did tast very good. 
Maybe with a little tweeking this could be much better.

Yummy!!  I made these last night and we loved them.  I made 5 bone-in pork chops (Costco thickness) and seasoned them with salt, pepper and sage before dipping in the eggs (use 2 instead of 3).  I used Chicken in a Biscuit crackers--I would highly recommend them because they are already so buttery and seasoned and it's what I had in the cupboard.  (I haven't tried this recipe with the Ritz crackers so I can't compare.)  Then I used about half of the butter, melted it and drizzled some on each chop.  Definitely bake uncovered for last 15 minutes as other suggest.  The 'cracker crust' was so yummy that I hope to incorporate it into other recipes!!

I gave this 3 stars because it was not crunchy at all.   It may have needed to be cooked appr. 30-45 minutes longer than recommended, because it came out very "wet".   Although adding this cooking time may cause the pork chops to dry out.  Next time I would probably melt the butter and drizzle it over the pork chops, that may help to make it come out a bit more crunchy with the recommended cooking time.

This recipe was great with only a few changes. I just took some of the advice from the reviews and it turned out great. I used 4 boneless pork chops, used garlic powder instead of garlic salt, Italian seasoning, black pepper, 1/3 cup butter & 2 eggs. Coated pork chops with ingredients first. Then dipped into beaten eggs. Then into crushed crackers. Then flash brown. Then into oven. Last 20mins uncover. When done place onto plate and poured about ¼ cup of strained Golden Mushroom soup onto each pork chop. Strain because wife don’t like mushrooms. This recipe is a keeper for sure. Mmmm Mmmm

These were not very good at all. It was like eating something raw because they lacked any color and the flavor was not that exciting....I will delete this recipe.

I enjoyed this with a few changes. Too salty & I used garlic powder instead of garlic salt.  I did uncover but not soon enough. I used Parmesian cheese which may have added to the saltiness. Will work on that.  Will make again.

I made this recipe without reading the reviews first.  I used saltine crackers.  Big mistake.  It was ok, but I now see that it would be much better to use Ritz.  I will try again.  Hubby still loved them.  He ate 3.

So easy to prepare with simple ingredients you're likely to have on hand.  This really was a big hit.  It's amazingly tasty.  I'm new to this site and sure am glad I found it.

I used half of the butter called for and this dish was still very good.  I followed others advice and uncovered the dish for the last 15 min of baking and used only 2 eggs.  I did rub some pork chop spice on the chops before I coated them in the egg and cracker mix, and also seasoned the chops themselves after they were coated rather then seasoning the cracker mix.  I baked them along with the roasted brussels sprouts (also from this site), and they were both ready at the same time.  The pork chops were nice and juicy - I can't see why I would make them any other way from now on!
**** UPDATE: I made these without eggs completely (I had run out) and they were still great.  Since the recipe calls for baking instead of frying, the topping stayed on even without the eggs.

For the first time ever I finished off a whole pork chop!!  Thank you so much for a great recipe. I added Ore-Ida Potatoes O'Brien to a dish after I greased it with Crisco lard and put the pork chops on top with the whole amount of butter. Took the foil off the last 15 minutes and we absolutely loved the results. Will definitely make again, no doubt about it!!

I made this the other night for my two toddlers and husband.  The kids loved it since they got to be part of the prep work (crushing crackers), they have never eaten pork chops so well.  I like that I have everything in my pantry and the pork chops came out very tender and juicy. My husband and I thouhgt it could use a bit more flavor though.  I will definately try again and add more seasoning.

My husband and I enjoyed this recipe.  The Ritz Roasted Vegetable crackers that I used were saltier than I expected.  I did add a little more salt to taste and it ended up being too much.  I used only 2 eggs, half of the butter, and uncovered the pan in the last 15 minutes of baking.  I will make these again.

Really good. Very moist and tender. You may want to bake uncovered for the last 10-15 minutes to make the chops a little crispy on the outside.

Very good!  I only needed 2 eggs, 3 tablespoons butter, pulled off the foil and broiled the last 10 minutes to slightly crisp.  Wonderful!  A new family favorite.  Thanks for sharing.

This was soooo GOOD!! We normally do not like pork chops, but I always tend to buy them anyway.  I did the recipe as stated but added about 1/4 cup of grated parm cheese. YUMMY!! It has such a rich buttery taste and its So easy to prepare to, we are actually going to make as one of the entrees for our family Christmas dinner.  I am not sure if this makes a difference but I also used Butterfly center cut chops and cut them in half, I think they usually end up more tender.

My family loved it and it was so easy- I wish I could have given 4.5. I only didn't give it a 5 because they were a bit soggy on the bottom- no butter maybe next time. I only used half anyway. This was easy and great- winter comfort food! :) Thanks for the recipe!

These are very good!  Some Italian seasonings make them even better ;)

Do not use all that butter though--I just put a little dab on top of each one.

Very easy to make. I used club crackers, seasoned salt and lots of pepper for the breading mixture. I covered with foil for half the recommended cooking time and then removed for the last half. I used some of the melted butter from the pan and drizzled it over the top for the last 5 minutes and finished under the broiler for a crispier texture.

Pretty good - but needs more seasoning and less butter.  I used panko crumbs in place of the crackers with fresh basil and parsley mixed in.  Turned out moist and flavorful.  Will make again when in need of something quick and easy.  Thanks.

Not bad...but turned out a bit dry in spite of flash browning as others suggested.  I used half the butter which worked out well.  Seemed to be lacking flavor...but paired nicely with a side of sweet potato casserole.

Fantastic recipe!  I needed a new way to make pork chops, and we really enjoyed it.  It's a little heavier than just baking, so it will be an occasional meal for us.

These came out very soggy although the flavor was good.  I will try them again and see if I can experiment a little to get more crispy.

I must have done something wrong because these pork chops came out bland and soggy.  They looked really good in the picture and I was expecting a nice, crispy pork chop but that's not what I got.  Perhaps I should have lightly covered it with foil instead of wrapping it tightly?  I was disappointed.  Won't bother with this again.  Anyone know of a really good pork chop recipe??

This recipe was a big hit with my children.  I didn't have butter crackers so I used bread crumbs and some italian seasoning.  I like my breaded pork chops a little crunchy so I uncovered them for the last 5-10 minutes.  Will use this one again!

I don't know what the rave was about this recipe! It was soggy,I had to jump up the oven to 500 to dry it it out and by that time the pork chops were like leather! My name I obviously hate to cook and am always looking for saomething easy...this looked easy, but tasted awful! BLAND! Better luck next time!

Prep is quick. Good if you want something that looks nice and you don't have a lot of time to cook. Great with StoveTop Stuffing. I subed bread crumbs though.

It was a good recipe. I used breadcrumbs instead of crackers. Cooking time was too long and my chops were dried out somewhat :(.

This came out delicious! I used breadcrumbs cause that's what I had and I seasoned the breadcrumbs with lots of garlic powder, salt and fresh ground pepper. I used a little less butter I think. I didn't really measure out the butter, I just used a spoon to drop butter pats all around the chops. I covered and cooked for 25 minutes then I uncovered and broiled on low for 15 minutes, turning every 3-4 minutes until they were nice and crispy! So good and tender. (and not too soggy as long as you broil and turn!) I will make these often. This is a good alternative to frying with grease.

My husband LOVED this. Sooo easy to make and if the chops are thinner, only cook in oven for 1/2 hour. I also added some herbs to the cracker mixture. Some Basil and Thyme. YUM!

These were very good, tender and buttery.   As recommeded, I uncovered for the second half of baking, but the breading remained somewhat soggy.  I used only 1 tbsp of butter, 1/4 c seemed exsessive.  A perfect pair with roasted red potatoes and a fresh spinach salad.  Next time I will experiment to see if I can achieve a crisper crust, but the flavor overall was excellent.

I should have read the reviews before attempting this one...The secret is probably in turning and uncovering at least half the cooking time.  If cooked as directed the chops came out with this mushy coating on them.  
Very unappetizing!  I may try it again with the new cooking insturctions.

AWESOME pork chops!  I LOVED the cracker crumbs instead of regular bread crumbs- I also added in some Old Bay to give it a little "kick"- but it's very versatile so add in whatever you like- my 3 year old who usually doesn't eat pork chops loved them too!  I will definitely make again!  I took the top off for about 5 min but I think I'll do it for 10 next time- the bottoms were a bit soggy but I think it's because I piled them up in a casserole dish maybe I'll use a longer one next time...  Oh and I also reduced the butter (margarine) to 1/4 cup- PLENTY! anyway- definitely a good recipe! THANKS!

This is a whole lotta fat for a whole lotta nothing!  I was surprised at how little overall flavor this recipe had.  I added additional seasonings per the suggestions of other users.  I added celery salt, onion powder, a healthy dose of pepper, and garlic salt.  Still nothing.  The butter and the crackers did help keep the chops moist but this recipe needs lots of work.  I think I'll try the Tonkatsu recipe next with panko before I try to fix this one.

Overall this recipe was very good.  I do think the amount of butter that is called for is a little overboard.  I will make again with a much smaller amount of butter.  Very moist & the coating has great flavor.

Alert the media!  My 8 year old daughter (who eats nothing but pizza and bologna) liked these!  I'm not a pork chop fan at all but these were quite good.  DH approved too :)  I used Ritz crackers and baked them in my Pampered Chef stoneware...first pork chops I've ever made that were actually moist.

There's a running joke in my house about pork chops. I've tried so many different recipes and all seem to come out dry. The joke can stop now because I finally found the perfect pork chop recipe! I almost cried when I tasted this because the chops were moist and bursting with flavor! My husband made sure I deleted every other pork chop recipe I ever tried. Thanks so much Heather for getting me out of the pork chop doldrums.

Very good. Inexpensive to make. I will definately make them again. I did cut back on the butter and flipped them halfway through. Then I broiled them for 5 minutes at the end. They were delicious!!

I have made these a couple of times, once with crackers and once with bread crumbs and both times they turned out delicious!! I used some of the other additions that the other reviewers used, like garlic salt in the breadcrumbs or worcestershire in the eggs. Either way i definitely recommend this recipe! I used the bonless sirloin chops.

This is one of my favorite recipes!!!  Instead of using the crackers, I use italian bread crumbs and I also use boneless pork ribs instead of the pork chops.  I'm sure it would be fantastic with the pork chops.  Its WONDERFUL!!  Definately recommend it to everyone.

My husband really liked these.  They sounded a little bland to me, so I crushed a few seasoned croutons in with the crackers.  They turned out great, but next time I wil turn them over when they are half done.

I never liked pork chops before this recipe. The pork was moist and flavorful. My husband and 3y/o loved this!  It was quick, easy, and you already have all the ingredients on hand.  Will definately make this again.

This recipe did not impress me. They definately have to go under the broiler in the end and it probably wouldn't hurt to cook them uncovered! The crackers were too mushy! Maybe I did something wrong, but I don't think so.

This recipe was so great and very easy! I only had buttered round crackers in the house so I definitely was able to cut back on the butter. It still came out great. I also suggest using broil in the last 5-7 mins. Thanks for the great recipe!!!

great flavor and I cut way back on the butter - just used a little - sprayed the pan first with nonstick cooking spray - put them under the broiler for a few minutes at the end to crisp them up and brown them.

I did not make any changes to the recipe other than I only had three pork chops thawed.  There was enough egg and cracker mix to coat six.  I will definitely make this again.

I used this recipe with chicken breasts and it was very good!  I did not cover while cooking, instead moved oven rack down to insure chicken cooked throughout.  I also took a previous suggestion and heated Pyrex with butter before placing chicken in and I had no issue with sogginess.

I'm not a pork chop fan...I'm not a great cook. But my family loves pork chops - this is my go to recipe that I use almost 5 times a year (so almost every other month). It's super easy to follow and they always want more when I fix these. Goes great with fried apples and broccoli rice.

I spread the cut up butter AROUND the chops with one small piece actually placed on top and I turned on the broiler for a couple minutes at the end to  crisp up the top. They were a hit. Would make them again... I’d probably add more seasoning to the crackers next time. I also used just 2 eggs.

Made a few tweaks based on other feedback and it was awesome. Season the chops first with salt, garlic salt etc.

This was very simple to make.  I liked all aspects of it.  But I gave it only 3 stars as the reviews said it was moist and tender.  I followed the recipe exactly and mine was not moist like the reviews said.  We needed to use a knife and it was tough to chew.  Three eggs is way too many - even though it called for 4 pork chops, my package came with 5 so that is what I made, and had so much egg left over.  The topping was soggy when I took it out of the oven and removed the foil cover.  It ended up being just another pork chop recipe.

My pork chops were thick & not center cut,  so cooked 15 min longer with cover off.   Don't be afraid to add your spices.

For me, the recipe needs about 5 - 10 minutes of broil time (depending on your oven). 

Too much butter and not enough browning made the chops soft and greasy. 

Less butter more broiling.

My kids loved this! My only suggestion is be careful how long you cook the chops. It is easy to overcook them!

I took some of the recommendations from other people that made it and the pork chops still turned out tough, mushy outside, undercooked and without flavor.  would NOT recommend.

I cooked the pork chops according to the recipe. They were ok however I don’t think I will make them again. They weren’t anything I would rave about. They were simply breaded pork chops.

Used less butter. I didn't turn them because they were still soggy and lost the crust when flipped. Not to worry because they crisp right up when foil is removed.  Delicious.

I used the air fryer instead of placing butter (dipped them in beaten eggs first, then the dry mix) on the pork chops and they turned out nice and crispy.  My apologies for not thinking to take a picture of them after taking them out of the airfryer though.

I used keebler club crackers and garlic powder and pepper to make my breading. I dipped the pork in flour first and then an egg wash so the breading would stick better. They were moist in the center and crispy on the outside.

I made these chops for dinner and they were delicious.  So much so, that I am making them again tomorrow when my family comes for dinner.  I will cut back the eggs to 2 and cook the chops for 35 minutes as they were ready by then the last time I made this.  The ease of prep is good as it gives us more time to visit when family is here.

These were the most juicy, beautiful, marvelous smelling, best tasting pork chops I have ever made.  I did tweak the recipe a little. I added real chopped garlic, some shredded parmesan, and parsley for beauty.  I really didn't know many pork chop recipes so I tried this one.  I wanted amazing chops and that's what I got.

I made lots of changes. I used corn bread  stuffing instead of crackers and added garlic powder to the crumbs with salt and pepper. Melted 4 oz. Butter in the pan. Used only 2eggs and had some left over. Breaded the chops put them in the pan covered and baked for half the time. Turned them and baked uncovered the rest of the time. The breading was good. The chops were still a bit drier than I thought they would be.  It was a lot of work for ok chops.

I read a lot of reviews and did the suggestion of decreasing the butter by half and it was still swimming in butter.  So I broiled them at the end of baking to get a bit of brown and a crust.  The chops tasted good otherwise.  Would not do this recipe again.

I made no changes in the preparation of this recipe but I did use boneless chops not the bone-in type.  It turned out just as it had been presented in the video.  Absolutely delicious and I will surely make it again.

I made the recipe before I read the reviews.  It had a good flavor, but certainly needs improvement.  The breading turned out mushy, it wasn’t tender enough, too much butter.  But I am certainly going to try this again, using suggestions from the reviewers.  I’ll use Ritz crackers, a thinner chop, and brown it at the end.  I like the “easiness” of this recipe and don’t want to lose that.

I changed the garlic salt to just garlic powder the crackers provide plenty of salt. I also didn't have the Ritz type as shown in the video. I had the regular butter crackers so I used them.  I also added some onion powder. My family loved this.  I have another similar recipe for Chicken Parmesan. Last night cooked this and tonight family requested the Chicken Parmesan.  I thought I had got the Chicken Parmesan recipe from this site but I can't find the same one. I have it wrote down/typed in my binder. Anyway this was awesome and the chops were tender.

Oh so simple and quick. lot's of room to do your own thing with the cracker coating. Add a bit more spice if you like. I thought the butter was excessive, so dialled it back and still had a great result.
The chops were tender, juicy and tasty!

My mother used to make these and I have many, many times.  I simpler version is to simply bread the chops with crushed saltines and fry to brown then finish off in the over at 350 degrees for about 25 min.

Boneless chicken breasts are great  using this recipe. I replaced the egg & butter with mayonnaise. Just coat the meat with mayo & dredge with crushed crackers. Always a hit.

It was easy and my husband said it was very moist and very tender.  I altered a bit. I had some left over garlic butter from garlic bread sticks so I used a bit of that and some olive oil for the bottom of pan. I also used cracker crumbs as that is what I had. I used only one beaten egg for three pork chops and I still had egg left over that I fried up for my dogs. I covered mine with tin foil and and took it off during last 15 minutes to help brown the top of dish.

I used Ritz crackers as the cracker base for  this recipe. I've been cooking for my husband for almost 32 years now. Felt like trying something  different but needed easy as I was recovering from major surgery followed by a stroke a week after getting home from hospital. This was very easy but filled my need to grab onto "normal" again. My husband LOVED this dish & now it's the only way he wants his pork chops done. Thank you so much for this recipe!!!

Excellent all the way around! I took the advice of another reviewer and butterflied my pork chops. I added a little more butter to the tops of the chops during cooking and cooked them without foil the last 5 to 7 minutes. These were so delicious with the Au Gratin potato recipe on her and

Yum!  Used less butter as suggested and turned oven to 400 last 15 min. Also used broiled last 5 min. Next time I’ll use even less butter, use the broiler longer and keep the ritz crumbs bigger so they stay crunchy. The smaller the crumbs the more they soaked up the butter and got soggy. Very good and moist pork chops. Used bone in loin chops.

Made as-is - just okay. I have much better luck browning chops coated with egg, panko OR cracker crumbs...then putting them into the oven (with oven safe skillet or pan, covered with the halved amount of butter called for in the recipe.).

I have made this for years, except that , instead of butter, I pour milk so that it comes about 2/3 of the way up the side of the chop, and then baked for about an hour.  My daughter didoesn't like pork, but she loved t them cooked this way.

I put gluten free bread crumbs on them instead of the crackers. They were delicious, but I think more garlic would have increased the flavor. The breadcrumbs are more bland than crackers. Otherwise delicious! And they looked beautiful in the pan.

After reading  other reviews, I  flash fried the chops in the pan before putting the pan into oven, which made the crust a little crunchy.  My Husband liked these alot, and so did I, this is a keeper.  We had yams as a side dish, mmm. good.

This was the first time I breaded pork chops, and this recipe was perfect.  They came out juicy and tender, and the cracker crumb breading (which I took some  liberties with) added a strong yummy factor.

This recipe should probably specify what size chops they use, because using larger pork chops may create soggy pork chops for thawed chops equals more moisture. I made these and they turned out soggy. I followed every instruction.

Made this tonight.  I followed many of the great ideas from the review.  Next time I will use even less butter than the halved amount I used.  Only gave 4 stars because my 11 year old was not to sure, but the picky 9 year old gobbled it up.

Great recipe. Used ritz crackers and a little garlic powder. I turned the boneless chops halfway through and broiled last two minutes for browning.  Make sure the meat rests for at least 5 minutes but mine rested 10 and were perfect. Not soggy and very tasty ??.

I took another reviewers advice and turned them after 20 minutes and took the cover off for the last 15 minutes.  It still wasn't quite crispy, but the flavor was very good.  Next time I will try 20-25 minutes with the cover off.  I'll report back when I do.

Good groceries! I used seasoned bread crumbs instead of crackers. A shake of dry ground mustard with the other seasonings in the bread crumbs. A squeeze of brown spicy mustard in the egg batter. Yum.

These were delicious! I used Slap Ya Mama seasoning rather than garlic salt, it just has different peppers in it as well as garlic. For crackers I used Carr's Table Water Crackers (garlic and basil) as they were what I had on hand. I also cut the butter to less than 1/4 cup. I will probably make these again because they tasted so good. I would uncover them for 20 minutes or maybe more to get more crispy goodness.

You need to turn the meat over half through to brown the other side. Also looks soggy so I would probably try not covering it or taking the cover off for a while

Awesome and moist. I cooked in the oven on a rack so that they weren't sitting in their own juices.  I removed the foil for the last 15 minutes or so and for the last 5 minutes put under the broiler to toast.  Everyone loved.  They were BY FAR the moistest pork chops I've made.  Everyone loved these.  I cut up a pat of butter into 1/4's and put on each pork chop.

As another reviewer wrote, these chops were terribly soggy on the bottom. As recipe states, I turned oven up to 375 for last 15 mins, but still not crispy on top, so broiled for a few mins (watch carefully so they don't burn.) Suppose I could have turned them over, while still on broil, to get both sides brown, but didn't realize I would need to do that until we ate them. Also, three eggs for the dip was not needed; two would have been plenty.

Quick and easy for a meal ready when I get out of the shower after work. Slightly salted the pork chops and used a pork rub before egg was and dipping in crushed crackers. Even better left over and will add this to my "go-to" menu!

BUTTER crackers & baked with BUTTER?  Doesn't get any better than that!  These were very good.  Since I was just cooking for myself, I used 2 boneless pork chops (I butterflied them since they were a little thick), 2 eggs, kept the crushed butter crackers (Town House) at 1 cup & used 3-4 tablespoons of butter. (I also dipped the chops in flour first before the eggs, out of habit). Baked for roughly the same amount of time, uncovering them for the last 20 minutes or so.  I agree with another reviewer that BUTTER crackers are a MUST.  Also, I would only use real butter, not margarine/spread.  This is a keeper.  Thanks for sharing!

My oven quit working before the Chops were done , so I put them in a pan on the stove and finished cooking them, which didn't take long and gave them a browning effect. They were delicious !!!

I used thin cut pork chops, and these were phenomenal. The breading was buttery and perfect, and they were so tender. My three year old barely eats meat, and he ate two of these!  But, still delicious for the adults!

Nice flavor , tender, and very moist.   I only used two eggs and about 1/2 the butter.  Just wish they were crisper.

I was expecting these to be better.  After reading some of the reviews, I used 2 eggs, and cut back on the butter.  I did everything else per the recipe while preparing the chops for the oven. I did take the cover off about 15 minutes before they finished, which helped brown them a little. As far as  tenderness and juiciness, they were fine. However, they were very bland and didn't make me want to go back for a second chop. I don't think I'll be making this recipe again.

Oh my gosh are these delicious! I followed a few suggestions... I used garlic butter Ritz and added Morton's All Seasoning Salt. I browned them in hot Olive oil then baked. I didn't add butter, didn't need it. I cooked 18 chops and the 6 of us only left 5! Paired them with broccoli cheddar rice. Dinner was a big hit.

I was very astonished that the chicken came out so crispy based on the fact that you just put tabs of butter in the pan. Delicious, would definitely recommend it.

Awesome! I also used breadcrumbs instead of crackers this time. Pulled off the top foil for the last 15-20mins. Not a soggy mess. Will use again.

This turned out great although I did use only half the butter it called for, I uncovered it for the last 15 minutes and broiled for 5 minutes to crisp it up a bit. I will make this again.

I used Ritz butter crackers and as some people suggested, dipped pork chops in melted butter instead of adding pieces of butter around pork chops. Cooked covered with foil for 20 minutes on one side, then turned them over, cooked for 10 minutes covered and then removed the foil and cooked uncovered for 15 minutes. Came out perfect! Crispy crust but tender and moist inside. My husband loved it!

This instantly became a family favorite!  Not only delicious, but SO easy for how extremely good it is!

From the first time we made it, we substituted ritz crackers for the butter crackers (same thing? not the same? I don't actually know) but it was so good, we've never looked back!

Yum!

Sad that some equate dry and tough with pork chops.  As written, this recipe yielded tasty, tender chops which were perfectly done, and not the least bit "soggy".  If You like eating shoes, this is not the recipe for You.  Otherwise, enjoy!

I absolutely love these pork chops! 1st of all, the butter crackers make this recipe. DON'T SUBSTITUTE THE RITZ!! To spice it up a bit more, I used Garlic Butter flavored Ritz. They are a little difficult to find in stores but when you do, it's worth it. 2nd, I'm always so afraid to overcook pork, the timing on this recipe is perfect for thick cut pork chops, bone-in. 3rd, you have to try this one, that's all I can say.

Fantastic and easy recipe! My family loves it! I have made it over a dozen times. I don't make it using pork chops - I use tenderized cubed pork tenderloin and I use either bacon flavored or garlic butter flavored Ritz cracker crumbs.  This is absolutely a restaurant quality dish!

These were very yummy. The only change I made was I didn't use a half of cup of butter. I just used a few tablespoons. They had a nice crispy crunch to them.  I  recommend using ritzs crackers.

Very easy - little prep, so I'll throw this into my weekday cooking  line-up. I forgot to make sure I had "butter" crackers, so I mixed panko crumbs with some garlic-herb pita chips I had and it turned out really good.  Like others, I set the last five minutes or so under the broiler to get a little crispiness to it.

I made this for dinner tonight. Wow!! This was very good, my husband loved it. I changed two things. I did not have Ritz crackers so I substituted with stuffing and coated the porkchops in milk instead.   I read some of the comments. One that stuck out to me the most was the comment about how the porkchops came out soggy.. this recipe calls for some kind of breading. If you use breading it will come out soggy!

I absolutely LOVE this recipe. The first time I made my pork chops using this, I couldn't stop eating them! My family seems to enjoy this recipe as well, which makes me happy. To everyone looking for some good chops, I recommend this 100%!

Dry and tasteless. I will probably have to try and salvage the leftovers by scraping off the crumb coating and maybe putting some kind of gravy on the chops.

This recipe was fast and easy to make.  I used garlic ritz  crackers and added garlic powder and onion powder and a special seasoning mix that I make to it.  I used less butter than called for. My chops were a little thin so I only cooked them for 30 minutes. The last 5 minutes I put them under the broiler. This will be my new way of cooking my pork chops. Great recipe.

These are delicious.  I used garlic and butter croutons instead just because I love croutons.  I also foiled the pan and used cooking spray instead of butter. I did cover with foil and baked at 375°, flipped after 15 mins, cooked another 15 mins and uncovered for 15 mins.   My family loved them.   Thank you for a great receipe.

Absolutely love love love this receipe. Everyone in the family loves it. The only change I made was instead of Ritz I use French's fried onions. Gives it much more taste and still comes out falling apart

Substituted panko bread crumbs because that was what was in the cupboard. Added some all-purpose seasoning with other recommended spices to the crumbs. Used only a few slabs of butter instead of the larger amount the recipe called for. Yummy and tender result!

This recipe is almost identical to the famous butter chicken recipe on this site.  The butter is an excellent way to get flavor & crispiness into your meal.  Thanks for submitting.

We love these pork chops!  I have used different cuts of pork with this recipe and it is a bit tricky to know when to pull them from the oven.  I have overcooked them many times, but now I check the temperature at about 30 minutes just to make sure I won't end up with dry meat.  Also, butter crackers are CRUCIAL to this recipe for 5 star results!

Great especially considering how quick and easy they are. Only mmodifivacations were using garlic powder and I flipped half way through as well as took the foil off the last 15 min and even broiled last couple minutes.  Definitely not for those looking for a low cal meal. I used regular butter crackers, generic brand, and 6 boneless 1/2 inch chops. Only used half the butter and it was still plenty. I would say DEFINITELY Flip chops half way through and broil the last 5 minutes or so until crispy unless you want them soggy. It was incredibly good. I did need to add a touch of salt to mine after I cooked them but I think that is because I used garlic powder instead of garlic salt cause that is what I had on hand, but they were perfect. 5 stars because it was easy and tastes good. That gets 5 stars in my book.

I made these tonight for dinner and I wish I had read the reviews first.  The butter made the breading soggy - I would either omit the butter or do what these other reviews are saying and take the foil off at the end so the butter will crisp them instead of make them soggy.  I would also cut the butter in at least half.  Otherwise very delicious!

Yes I tried it and my family loved it! I had to tweak a few things but it was still awesome! The last fifteen minutes I took the foil off and cooked at 425 and the last five minutes I broiled it for a "crispier" and golden brown coating!  My family loved it!

This is definitely a keeper in our house. Didn't have garlic salt so I used a little garlic powder and omitted the salt altogether. Delicious. Chops were tender and moist.

quick and easy BUT...way too much butter. What should havde been a crispy crust was mushy/soggy. Taste was OK with a little tweak.  I added some smoked paprika that came out nicely in the end.

I just made this & it was fantastic!  I didn't have cracker crumbs but I had a box of corn flake crumbs I used instead.  I followed the directions completely and the chops were moist but still crispy on both top & bottom!  Will make this again and again.  Hubby loved them too.

Soggy, bland taste. I think if a rack were placed in the bottom om the baking pan and they were placed on it, along with uncovering 15 minutes to crisp them a bit they may be better.

I have tried this recipe several times but have made some modifications.  I use townhouse flatbread crackers (Italian herb) instead of butter crackers.  I also melt butter in cooking dish prior to placing pork chops in dish.  These are sooooo good!

These were excellent!  Great flavor.  Next time I will broil them on each side for 5 minutes at the end, as they were a bit mushy on the bottoms.  Probably cut back on the butter and just grease the pan with butter instead of using a half stick.

Made these last night EXACTLY as written. Pork was tender & had good flavor, but coating was mushy vs. crispy.  Tried to "crispen" it up on the stove, but coating then fell off (which I kinda expected, but thought I'd try).

Pretty easy to make but some details I would add to recipe.  I got 3/4 inch boneless pork chops and it was done in 30 min instead of 45..to get rid of sogginess..finish them on the pan after you take out of oven to get them a little more crispy. Ritz crackers good touch too.

I had stopped cooking pork chops because they always were dry no matter what recipe I tried. With this recipe I can make chops a regular menu item again. Easy, quick and simple ingredients, that's what makes this one of my favorite recipes. Great for serving guests!

Yum!! I made a few small changes based on the reviews.  I only used 2 eggs, and that was still more than enough to coat my chops.  Then I also only used 1/4 c of butter not a 1/2 c.  It ended up being the perfect amount for me.  Then I also melted the butter in the pan first before adding the chops.  When I added the chops, I placed them on one side first, then after they were coated with butter I flipped them over then put them in the oven.  Halfway through the cooking time a flipped them over again.  They were very good, and I will make these again.

After reading the reviews I was thinking I had finally found a great recipe for chops. I did take note to all of the not so positive reviews also. I weighed my odds and decide to give this recipe a whirl. I followed the recipe exactly and didn't have a problem with the breading being soggy like some reviews mentioned and my chops where moist and tender, no complaints there. The only problem that hubby and I had was not much flavor.  I have spiced the recipe up with different thing a few times. Once I used Ritz crackers as suggested.Then more garlic salt, garlic powder instead, fresh garlic, ect. I really wanted this to be the end all to my quest for the perfect recipe. However, I'm just not satisfied with this recipe. Any suggestions would be appreciated.

I would love to give these a four and a half stars. I made exactly as stated above and they were yummy but I wish the crust had stayed on a bit better. I think in the future I will flour before the bread mixture and also cut back on the butter in the pan and flip half way through the cooking. As stated they were juicy and rich tasting. I would spend the extra money to buy real ritz crackers

Wow this recipe is just about wrong in every way. 1st the cook time is way too long, there is no flavor with the seasoning suggested, I used 2 eggs for 5 chops that were 1" thick. I did broil to get rid of the total sogginess but it just dried them out to make 5 uneatable chops. Will never make again. UGH!

These were super easy. I followed the recipe as written. I liked the flavor that the Ritz crackers gave it. I felt like the flavor would have been completely different if I had of used breadcrumbs. I also liked that I used ingredients that I already had on hand.

This didn't work for me at all.  Nothing wrong with my oven, so I can't blame it on that.  Just didn't get crispy the way I would have liked them.  I agree with another reviewer that they were a bit soggy and not what I expected.

It's another, more healthy way of cooking port chops.  At our house, I use saltines crushed, and pan fry 'em.  They get brown and crunchy.  I know, bad for you.  But really good!

The flavor was very good, however, I was so looking forward to cutting these chops with a fork, not even close, they were dry, far too well done and I followed the recipe to the letter. VERY DISAPPOINTING.

This was quick and easy. I added some basil and oregano to give it a little zip. I also would recommend cooking uncovered for the last ten minutes so they are not soggy

This is a recipe I grew up on. It was always one of my favorite meals my mother used to make. She used soda crackers, which means she didn't use salt and like her, when I make these, I never put them in the oven. I fry them in butter at a lower to medium heat until the chops are moist done (dried out chops are like eating cardboard) and the breading is crispy.

I didn't have any crackers, but did have StoveTop stuffing.
And it worked great! A++ Thanks for the recipe!





had(2)1 1/2in boneless pork chops, one egg, about a cup of Stovetop crunched. 375 @ 45 min.
Margarine worked great. Such a yummy tender chop!

This has quickly become a staple meal for me. I love it because it's something you can throw together at the last minute. I love adding a little grated parmesan and dried parsley to the cracker mixture, and per other reviewers I bake covered for 25 minutes, then uncovered for the remaining 20. If I have extra crumbs, I add those on when I uncover the dish--this, along with the uncovered baking, helps alleviate any sogginess. 

Update: After forgetting the butter a couple times, I realized it doesn't hurt the recipe at all and actually seems to help prevent the chops from getting soggy.

I made these pork chops for my family and they LOVED them!!!  They were tender and juicy and had great flavor!!!
I used Ritz crackers and took the advice of other posts about this recipe to take the cover off the pan a little over halfway before they are done.  This gives the topping a golden color and great texture and flavor.  My new favorite pork chop recipe!!!!!

Gluten Free! I made this gluten free with Glutino's Table Crackers and substituted Ghee for the butter. Man! These were good! Exellent. I used a meat thermometer due to the fact that I used very thick pork chops but 50 minutes seemed to do the job!

The cracker breading really makes this dish! Very easy to make. I 'breaded' the pork chops and cooked them for 40 minutes, then for the last 5 minutes topped them with additional crushed crackers and let them brown on top. The pork chops stayed moist- I didn't place butter around them in the pan- and this recipe is now a staple.

Used japanese breadcrumbs because I did not have cracker crumbs.Did not need to put any butter, just sprayed a bit of oil on the pan and the chops. Tasted great and tender, too.

Yum, Yum, Yum! My family LOVED this. So easy and so good. I did not take the foil off as others suggested. I made it just like the recipe, except for one small change. I used veggie flavored Ritz crackers. Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly and it was perfect. Will make again!!!!

Made as written. Mixed results at the kitchen table. The meat was moist and the crackers crunchy . It just missed the mark. 4 out of 6 of us did not care to eat it again.  I personally found the crackers a bit sweet. The top was crunchy but bottom mushy. Not my favorite.

A great recipe.  Following some of the suggestions of others, I baked them in Ritz crackers, covered, on a low temp. (325) until tender.  I uncoverd them and broiled until brown.  They were great.  It's difficult to find tasty recipes for pork chops that don't result in dry, tasteless chops.  I have found cooking them on a low temp. and then broiling, unless they are a cacciatore style recipe, works best.  This recipe was almost foolproof, thanks to its originator and other readers who experimented. Thanks for such a tasty winter meal.

I'm confused. I was reading through these reviews and I don't understand how someone can follow the receipt precisely and still have either soggy or dry pork chops. I also followed it and you could cut the pork with a fork and the taste was superb! I love home cooking, soul food and 5* restaurants, so don't say it's a matter of taste. There is just no way these could come out less than perfect if you follow the recipe; unless you have an oven that doesn't cook evenly.

Good basic ideas for a breaded pork chop.  I had thin, boneless centre cut chops and baked them for about 20 minutes.  They were so dry, it was like eating cork.  What kind of pork chop takes 45 minutes in the oven??  I'll try this recipe again, but take the chops out after 12-15 minutes.

Loved this recipe!  I used 8 thin sliced boneless pork loin chops and it tasted very much like schnitzel!  Very good!  I also added a tablespoon of dijon mustard to the egg mixture - then shallow fried the chops in a 50/50 mixture of butter and olive oil - 2 minutes per side.  They were soooo good - the boys loved them!  Served it with a mustard potato salad and green beans.

These were excellent. I double breaded them and cooked them in a glass baking dish, plus I flipped them after 15 minutes and took off the cover for the last 15 minutes. The breading was crisp and the chops were moist and delicious.

I use graham crackers instead of Ritz. It keeps the pork moist, like the Ritz, but with a different flavor.

Really quick and easy recipe with few ingredients. I followed the recipe exactly and it was tender and moist. I didn't even need ketchup. Will make again!

Better off simply marinating and/or throwing some seasonings on the pork chops. I'm not sure what all the fuss is about, I made exactly as written Texture and flavor just wasn't there..sorry will not make this again.

I should have remembered to broil for a few minutes  so they wouldn't have been mushy.  Can't wait to try it again.

These were fabulous.  I used one-inch thick boneless pork loin chops and they came out so-o moist and tender.  I doubled the recipe and still needed only the three eggs called for.  I also removed the cover the last 10 to 15 minutes of the bake time so they could get a little brown on top and not too mushy.  That way they'd have a little bit of crunch to them.  Thanks for a great, simple recipe for pork.

It was great!! I would just use less butter next time for a crisper texture. I did uncover the foil for the last 15 minutes. This recipe is a keeper. My husband and I enjoyed!

These are REALLY tasty and EASY to make. I made one chop for myself for lunch. It was so yummy that I made 3 more to share with my boyfriend for dinner.  He LOVED the coating, so did I! I used the Veggie Garlic/Herb Ritz, they turned out REALLY good. Per other reviews: I used about half the recommended butter and sprinkled leftover cracker crumbs onto of the the chops with the limited butter - they turned out nice & crispy, not soggy at all. I also took the cover off for the final 15 mins in the oven. I highly recommend using THIN pork chops! Nice recipe, thanks, I will use again!

I was pleasantly surprised by this!  I usually steer away from breaded meat recipes because I hate cooking in the hot oil and getting splattered everywhere and then having to figure out something to do with the oil afterwards.  This turned out wonderful in the oven and was very easy clean up.

I thought these porkchops were perfectly fine but nothing to write home about. I gave 3 stars because they're average. Good, but average. I did not like that the crust was soft, not crisp, and wish I'd taken the cover off for the last 20 minutes or so.

Fantastic!  I followed directions and used all the butter called for and it was great!  After the 45mins was up, I uncovered the chops and turned on the broiler and I let them broil for about 15minutes to get them crispy.  It worked!! But the butter in the baking dish also burned a little...so maybe put broiler on low.

These are very delicious!  I took the advice of some other reviewers and used half crackers and half bread crumbs, and it works very well.  You only need one or two eggs max for dipping.  A keeper!

This was great! Was looking for another way to cook pork chops instead of having the usual.  The only thing I did different was use Town House crackers (didn't have Ritz) and for my 3-yr-old cooking assistant/boss, I added Cavenders-which is his favorite spice. Everyone loved it!

Yummy recipe! The pork chops i had were pretty thick so they still needed to be cut with a knife, but they were juicy and had just enough of the butter flavor from the crust. Good staple recipe.

Very DELICIOUS! I actually had 5 bone-in chops and of course I HAD to tweak the recipe by adding more herbs, but what a fantastic base to work with!  I used a whole roll of ritz, garlic salt, pepper, about a teaspoon+ of dry mustard, about a teaspoon garlic powder, about a tablespoon dry minced onion, about a tablespoon of brown sugar.....YUM!....my hub loved the hint of sweet from the brown sugar.  I used a little over half the butter as well.  I also browned mine for about 5 min under the broiler uncovered for some crunch.  I might try half of cooking time uncovered for crunch next time.

These are the best pork chops I have ever made - and it does not get any simpler!  I followed the recipe as written except I only used about 3 tablespoons of butter.

Amazing & super easy. The only part that is a little time consuming is making the crumbs, but you can do that ahead of time.

Delicious! In my version, I brined thick loin chops for a couple of hours. Brushed with melted butter, then breaded with Ritz crumbs with a little pepper and garlic powder. No salt needed because of the brining. No eggs. Baked covered at 350 for 45 min, then uncovered at 425 for 15 min. Someone said that Ritz crackers are a key ingredient. Yes! Much better than standard bread crumbs.

These were very moist, something that usually eludes my pork chops.  I was in a hurry and they weren't cooking fast enough so I finished them in the cast iron skillet for 10 minutes. I did only use 2T of butter and and a splash of olive oil.  I am sure if I had put them in sooner they would have finished in the oven.  My daughter usually doesn't like pork chops and she had 2 helpings.  So I know they were good.

Made this for my family and they loved it! I used bread crumbs instead of butter crackers and I added italian seasoning to it. Also, definitely use two eggs, as others have suggested... it really makes a huge difference. Will be making this again soon!

I used both boneless pork chops and ribeye pork chops. The ribeye pork chops tasted much better with this recipe. My 2 year old son who doesnt eat awhole lot of meat loved it. I cooked it a little longer than the recipe and some part of the crackers were still a little soggy and came off the meat easily. Overall really good, only wish it was a little more crispy.

This is so simple and delicious. My 9 year old daughter can make it on her own as it's so easy. I add a pinch or two of garlic powder. WHen the chops are done, I prinkle with cheese and put under the broiler. My kids absolutely love these.

Maybe my pork chops were smaller, but I used only one egg and 1/4 cup butter.  I uncovered the last 15 minutes, but still turned the broiler on for a few more to try to make crisp.  Although I wasn't overly impressed with the look and texture, I did give four stars because they tasted great.  May try this one again.

The only reason why I rated it 4 stars is that I think it should have been fried, even though that's not as healthy, but it was a little mushy, I also liked squeezing a little lemon on the top, very good though.

These were good but it doesn't need as much butter as the recipe calls for and I suggest using a lean pork tenderloin chop.

I used bread crumbs and added some Italian seasoning to it.  I have no garlic salt so I just used normal and two eggs was more than enough.  Unfortunately the breading didn't cook as well as I had hoped, even though I covered in foil for the first 35 mins and flipped them at 20 mins, so I attempted to sear them in a pan afterwards, which mostly worked.  However next time I will do this before I put it into the oven.

For four boneless pork chops (about 1 lb. total), I used one egg (and threw away the extra) and I topped each pork chop with just a little spoonful of margarine (I didn't measure it).  The crackers I had on hand were wheat TownHouse crackers which were very good.  Took the advice of others and uncovered for the last 15 min. and still turned on the broiler for a few minutes in the end to get the coating crisp.  Will definitely make again.

My husband and son raved about the flavor of these.  Only change I will make is next time I will remove foil at the end of cooking time and brown the top so they are not  soggy on top.

This is a very easy, simple recipe that tastes great.  I used half the butter and 2 eggs.  I added garlic powder and used onion salt instead of garlic salt.  Excellent!  Will make again.

excellent! these pork chops are melt in your mouth tender....i ust say though that a little less butter would work wonderfully, and i did follow others advice and uncovered the last 15 minutes and flipped them over once. thank you for  a great easy recipe!

For myself personally I would've given it 3 stars - way too much buter, too many eggs and I had to use twice as much cracker crumbs. Porkchops are great by themselves anyway so I won't say I didn't LIKE it - mostly it just had way too much of a buttery taste and I don't like butter. But my husband and my kids just LOVED it! They want it in our regular rotation. So I averaged it out to a four-star review. :D

I've tried this several times and found that it definitely pays to cover the baking tray with foil for most of the cooking process. Otherwise the pork dries out and becomes hard and stringy. I use crushed saltines, adding salt, pepper, oregano, parsley and garlic and onion powder to the coating mix. It's a decent recipe that's quick and easy.

Made these tonight for a guyfriend with sides of mac-n-cheese, corn on the cob, 7-grain pilaf, and cheese-topped french bread.  I did tweak the recipe and made it only for 2 big, thick-cut, bone-in porkchops, beginning with using Late July brand organic crackers and wheat crackers mixed with freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano, garlic powder, salt and pepper.  Used two eggs instead of 3 and real butter (though much less than called for, just a few small pats).  Into the oven at 375 degrees for 55 minutes because of larger cut, broiling for the last 3 minutes.  This tasted fantastic and my friend was very impressed.  Would make this again!

My husband - who is not a big complimenter - said he's never had better pork chops! These are a 10. I used 4 chops (halved two butterfly chops) and used 1/2 of the butter called for.  I baked them uncovered at 375 for 50 minutes. Yum!!!

This is an awsome pork chop recipe. I made some changes to the recipie: I tenderized the pork chops and marinated them in soy sauce+brown sugar+ pressed garlic for 10 minutes. I used animal crackers instead of butter crackers and added paprica and Italian seasoning in the dry mix. It was the best pork chop I've ever had!

This was tasty!  I had 3 large bone-in chops to use.  I used 1/4 cup butter and 2 eggs, and there was still some egg left over.  My kids ate it (and usually they challenge me on meat dishes) and enjoyed it.  I used Ritz like suggested by many.  There were no leftovers.

loved this recipe!!! I didn't change a thing, and it turned out amazing. The butter really makes the chop. It adds so much flavor, brilliant! I didn't want it to end, it will definitely be in my recipe rotation.

Very flavorful, added a little garlic salt.  Also a good alternative to the crackers is salt and pepper chips or salt and vinegar chips!!  I've used both very yummy!

I've tried this recipe twice -- the first time, the porkchops were a little overcooked and the bottom crust was mushy.   The second time, I cut about 5 minutes off the cooking time, since I was using thinner chops. I also sprayed some cooking spray on the pan before laying down the porkchops, so the crust won't stick to the pan.   I was concerned about how much butter the recipe called for, so used only about half a stick at first, then checked every 10 minutes or so to see if more butter is needed. If the pan was getting dry, I'd put a few pieces in -- at the end, I used about 3/4 a stick. I think it also helped make sure the bottom didn't get soggy.

Yummy, easy to prepare, and husband loved them.  I cover with larger glass bakingdish instead of foil wrap.  Then when you take out of oven, you flip the chops, sprinkle generously with garlic salt, pepper, and paprika and the extra buttery cracker crumbs.

Don't know if I did something wrong but they were a little soggy and not so crispy like I expected. The flavor was good though and I agree with other reviewers that 1 Tbsp of butter per chop is more than enough

This is amazingly tender and so easy to fix.  I would use half the butter next time as it was quite greasy.  Also think I would uncover for the last 15 minutes as noted in another review.  Great for company or family meal.

It is necessary to brown the chops on both sides first (in about 2 TBS butter). I only used 1/4c butter total and still ended up with excess butter/fluid in the pan which I had to drain off 2/3 the way through cooking to keep the crust from being soggy. You can't go wrong with butter crackers... much better than bread or saltines.

The flavor was good. Only needed 2 eggs for the dipping.  Didn't have thick chops to use so desided to fry instead of bake them.

I made these last night and changed a few things.  You really only need 2 eggs and I added a litte cajun seasoning to the cracker crumbs to spice it up a little.  I cooked on 300 degrees for 20 each side and then on 375 for 15 minutes. They were still a little mushy so I broiled them for about 5 min.  They didn't come out as crunchy as I would have liked but they were still good.  I definitely think you need to add some other type of seasoning other than the garlic salt.

Either use garlic salt or season salt, don't use both.

These were the best pork chops I have ever had.  The crust was flavorful and kept the meat tender.

I thought this was a hit! A nice alternative to boring shake n bake. I didnt have enough crackers, so I used half breadcrumbs. Added some Lawrys and a garlic spice blend to the crumb mixture before coating and it gave a great spice to mixture. Husband loved it- so did I- will do again and again!

This was easy and the chops came out SO juicy! I substituted garlic Triscuits instead of the buttery crackers and also added some minced garlic to the mixture. I'll definitely make this time and time again!

This is a fantastic recipe!  I didn't have butter crackers, so I used ritz crackers.  Next time, I'll put them into my magic bullet to make them more powdery.

Very tasty - and fast, easy, & moist.  This is the best pork chop recipe I've tried so far.  The topping was a little mushy, but still worked.  I will be making this many times.  Thanks for sharing.

This was nice and simple, and easy because you should have the ingredients on hand. I used Socialable crackers, not Ritz and love the even more buttery taste. I covered for the first half-hour, then left uncovered for the last 15, to make sure it wasn't mushy. So good! Will definitely use again when I don't feel like being fancy with my chops. Can't wait to try on boneless chops.

I'm not a big pork fan but these were really moist and flavorful. I used thicker cut boneless chops. I only used a few tablespoons of butter and baked at 350 for about an hour (also didn't cover mine). Delicious!

Very good!  We followed another's advice and butterflied a center cut chop and then tenderized the meat by beating it first and then finished it off in the broiler.  We also used 1/2 Ritz and 1/2 plain bread crumbs and it was still sooo buttery tasting.  This was the MOST tender I have ever had pork - seriously good!!!

I've baked porks many times but this has the best flavors of all. I used my small baker stoneware and it baked it crispy and delicious. It took only 35 minutes for succulent tender chops.  I will make it again. My hubby even said they were the best chops he ate as far as flavor goes. Thanks again Mrs Suzan

DELISH!!  Super easy to make.  I put my cracker mixture in a ziplock bag to make it easier to coat the chops (shake n bake style).  Definitely follow the directions (don't skimp on the butter).  Texture looks like mush but tastes great!  Don't be deceived by appearances or other reviews.  5 stars all the way.

This got mixed reviews here. My fiance liked this, but I was really turned off by the texture. Good flavor, but the crackers were so mushy. I baked uncovered for the last 15 minutes and then broiled for 5 minutes and the breading was still really soggy. Thanks for sharing :)

I followed others people suggestions and cut way back on the butter to about 1 to 2 teaspoons per chop. At the end of the time, I removed the foil and broiled the chop for 5 mins but it could have been for 10 mins but was good texture and taste. I served with tomato rice and salad. I will use again.

This recipe was a hit.  I combined crackers and italian breadcrumbs for the coating and dipped the chops in eggs only. My husband said, "How did you finally stop the coating from falling off?"  I would also only use butter, no substitutions.

These were super yummy and juicy! I too cut back on the butter. For 2 chops I used a little over a tablespoon. I also flipped them at the halfway point and uncovered them for the last 15 mins. Excellent!

I'm giving these 5 stars under the category of pork chops (meaning I don't like them better than pizza or ice cream but as pork chops go, these are the best!)  I didn't measure the amount of garlic salt or pepper I used and I did not use name brand Ritz crackers b/c I didn't have them in the house, I had generic.  But other than that I followed the recipe.  I did uncover them the last 15 minutes & broil them the last 5 for crispiness.  The flavor was great, they were very "melt in your mouth" and easy and fun to make.  The family was pleased and it was a success!

You must make this using Ritz Crackers.  The only other thing I changed was from 1/2 cup butter to 1/4 cup.  It wasn't as crispy as I hoped and turned them over after 20 minutes.  I will try next time to add lots of crusted crackers.

After the fact of buying pork chops did I find out that not only me, but my husband as well are not actually fans, I must say they turned out fantastic, melt in your mouth goodness.

Very good.  I used garlic & herb topper crackers and skipped the salt.  I only used 1/4 cup of butter.  During the last few minutes I turned on the broiler to get some brown on them.

I am not a good cook.  I can ruin just about anything.  These were even great for me!  I was very impressed!!  I used someone's suggestion about broiling at the end to brown and used bread crumbs because I did not have Ritz crackers. I used pork steaks cut in half because I did not have pork chops.  They were the best pork anything I have ever cooked!! Who would think it would be so easy and really turn out to be one of my favorite recipies.  I am not even a fan of pork. I would rather have most anything else, but I will make these again and again.  THANKS!!

These were sooo delicious!  I used thin center cut chops and they looked so beautiful when they were done-just like the picture. All my kids (even my oldest who doesn't like pork chops) ate these up. The Ritz really give it a special flavor, almost a sweetness in the crust. I'll be making it again. Thanks a bunch!

I thought these tasted great, but the breading turned out very soggy and didn't look very appealing. I will most likely try again but follow other's suggestions to get the breading more crisp and also cut way down on the butter. I didn't even use the full 1/2 cup as the recipe states and it was more than enough.

I wish I could rate this recipe a 4.5 since I thought it was better than average but not great as is.  I thought the chops needed a bit more flavor.  However, my husband liked them the way they were.  The next time I make these, I think I will use the advice from some of the reviewers of this recipe and sprinkle Season All onto the chops before flash browning.  Good recipe overall.  I just need to tweek to fit our tastes.  I will definitely make this again.  Thanks for the recipe Tricia.

This was a really good way to cook pork chops!! The only thing I really changed was that I sprinkled some Thyme on top before putting them in the oven...that added an awesome flavor to it!

I didn't really care for this recipe. The coating was pasty and white at the end of 35 minutes (1/2 inch bone-in chops) so I put them under the broiler for an additional 10 minutes just to get some color. They were still moist with good flavor though, so I gave them a 3. Won't make again.

I made these and packed them up with hubby for work, so we didnt eat fresh. He said they were a tad dry, but that couldve been me overcooking too.  Will try again so I can try them this time and try them fresh.

Very yummy. I used thick, boneless pork chops. Covered and cooked for 1 1/2 hours, then removed cover for 20 minutes.  The coating crisped up nicely on top, inside tender and juicy.

Great quick & easy recipe.  The flavor was right on, but the chops didn't come out quite as tender as I expected. I would still make them again though! Thanks so much, we really enjoyed these.

This was my first time making pork chops (I rarely cook meat), and they turned out great.  I added some freshly grated parmesan to the breading, and cut the amount of butter by half.  The chops were still swimming in butter, so I can't imagine what they're like with the whole 1/2c of butter!

I am still in the process of learning how to cook everything...so I needed something easy,and that wasnt hard to mess up. These were the BEST pork chops I had ever had!! I used the boneless little ones. I used a corning ware dish with a lid. They were just right! cooked to perfection. I was really impressed because alot of the things I try, the first time around isn't the greatest.

My family and I liked the pork chops alot.  I used boneless chops.  Next time, I will cut back on the butter by at least 1/2 and I will also take off the foil the last 15 min.  I didn't take off the foil, but did try to brown under the broiler for a couple minutes at the end.

This was just OK for me.  The pork chop breading became soggy on top. I tried broiling it the last 5 minutes or so, but it was too soggy to work without overcooking it.   I made it as instructed, except I did not cook it as long as suggested.  Good thing. They would have been way overcooked.

Not the greatest chops I have eaten! My husband did not like them. He said there was "nothing special" about them. I used lean chops and they cooked fine and were not mushy or dried out as some have experienced.  I used Pam instead of the butter tho. Felt the butter would be to much and I did not want my chops cooking in any extra fat. I don't think I will be making this recipe again.

I'll say a four,they were GOOD! I just used breadcrumbs,italian seasoned breadcrumbs but everything else,just exactly and they were so tender,you didn't really need a knife,but I used thin chops. My son even liked them but then he dipped them in barbeque sauce,he thinks you need bbq sauce with everything! hehe.

These were sensational for being so easy! I used homemade bread crumbs with some cut up fresh onion mixed in, and bought 2 butterfly-cut pork chops and just divided them in half for 4 total. I did everything exactly as the recipe said except I put a small tab of butter on top of each one before they went in the oven. They turned out fantastic! They didn't need any sauce. I served them with mac & cheese and some corn. Yummy!!

Very good. I didnt cover my mine or even turn them and they just turned out awesome. When ever I make pork chops again I will be making them with this recipe. These are worth a try. I have no complaints.

I had some pork chops in the freezer that I needed to use so I tried this.  I tried it with fine chopped weat thins(magic bullet)  Im not a big fan of pork chops but this recipe was good.  My wife and I both liked this and will probably make this again.

I don't know why these turned out so mushy but I even broiled them at the end till the started to burn and still not crisp. I think I will stick to bread crumbs or maybe try and pan fry them. I gave this recipe four stars though because my husband loved them...my four year old too.

My husband LOVED this recipe...usaually whenever I try to make pork chops they dry out.  These were very moist.  Thank you for a great recipe!  (The cracker breading has a wonderful flavor and I took the advise of another ,and "flash" cooked the pork chops before baking.)

I did not like these pork chops but my husband thought that they were amazing. However, this recipe called for way too much butter! Cut the calories and use less butter. I used a 1/2 stick and there was still too much butter. Also, I only used 2 eggs and I still had plently left over. Thanks though.

The pork chops were yummy, but I did what other people recommended and broiled them on both sides at the end. I will not use as much butter next time, probably just lightly spray them with butter spray, the chops were soggy on the bottom, but broiling them helped. Will make again!

Excellent! Yum, Yum... I did a few thing different. I baked a thin boneless breakfast chop instead of a thick chop. Reduced the baking time to 25 minutes.  I also turned the chops over 1/2 way through baking. reduced the butter to 1/4 cup as well. Uncovered 1/2 way through baking. Turned out great! Thanks for making dinner easy tonight!!

Really excellent flavor, but it turned out really mushy.  I did 1/2 cup of butter to ten pork chops, cooked them for 45 minutes, covered and then for another 15 minutes under the broiler.  The meat was really tender, but the coating didn't get as crispy as I would've liked it to be.  Will definitely make this again, though.

Something went wrong, the chops were too tough to eat.  Covering them didn't seem right, they were soggy, 375 degrees for 45 minutes seems like way to much for chops.   Never again will we try this recipe.

Two eggs is sufficient and it would've been nice to have a general idea of how much garlic salt - 1 tsp, 1 Tbsp, 1/4 cup - ANYTHING!  I don't normally cook so I just had to guess and that's always scary!

The crackers really made this recipe what it is.  I didnt have butter crackers so I used Hot N Spicy Cheez Its instead. So good!  I did take the foil off the last 15 minutes as others suggested and was happy with my results.  I think perhaps less butter will be used next time I make this because the bottoms did feel a little mushy.  Also a side note, it would be easier to use pork w/o the bones.

I really don't understand all the rave reviews for this.  It had no flavor at all.  It would need a lot of doctoring to make it taste like anything other than pork and crackers.  The only positive thing I can say was that it was filling.

I like to try recipes as written on the first try. This one didn't meet my expectations on that first go. The chops had a nice flavor, but were not as tender as I'd hoped and the breading was soggy. Another reviewer claimed that it wasn't soggy, it just wasn't 1950 (or something like that), but I gotta say, the right word for how mine came out is soggy. I think I'll be moving on to other recipes for chops, but if I can't find anything else, I may come back and do some of the suggested modifications on this one.

I had thick boneless chops so I cut them in half to make them thinner.  I cut the butter in half and baked them for 45 mins.  Then about 10 mins under the broiler.  Great taste!  Just make sure they aren't cooked too long and dry out.  Next time I might cut the baking time down to about 35-40 min since I broiled them too.

Decided to make this tonight since I thawed out some pork chops. On other recommendations, I added only half the butter and removed the cover for the final 15min. Since my husband loved them, I gave the recipe 5 stars, since he's hard to please. Only wish they would have come out less soggy, for me.

This was different from the "shake n bake" but it was good.  It was a little soggy so I ended up putting it under the broiler for a few mins.  I would make this again in the future but it is not a favorite.

I was disappointed with the chops, they were mushy, wet, and not tender at all. In fact they were dry on the inside. Maybe I bought too thick chops, I don't know.

The breading was good.  The good stops there.  I followed the recipe and mine turned out soggy, tough, and almost flavorless.  I used boneless chops.  That could have been the problem. I don't know but because of the soggy result, I will not be making this again.

It is an ok recipe. I followed it to a T. I was thinking that the pork chops would have a dryer, crisper crust after being baked but they were soggy. With a whole stick of butter put on the chops, it made them very greasy as well. But the taste was good.

This recipe was probably the easiest way you could make pork chops. They had a wonderful flavor but a little on the soggy side. i will cook uncovered a little longer next time. But i will use this recipe again when i dont have a plan for dinner, Quick Easy and all ingredients on hand. Thanks for sharing:)

This is a tasty recipe and sure beats Shake n' Bake!  Although the butter adds flavor, I found a whole stick was just a little too much, as the chops are just swimming in it. Could probably cut back to 3/4 of a stick and still get the flavor.  I also would add more seasoning than I did, but all in all, the family liked this recipe and I'll make it again.

I followed the recipe exactly and these turned out ok. I flavor was fine but I had to take the foil off and broil for a few minutes because of the butter, the chops looked mushy. This helped to dry things out. Also the chops were not as tender as I would have liked but that could be because of the type of pork chop that was used. Overall, they were good and I will make again but not with as much butter.

Flavor was fabulous.  After going exactly by the recipe, I had soggy pork chops swimming in juices.  For 15 minutes, I continued to bake uncovered & broil to get rid of the soggy & have a nice crisp coating.  They were great, except parts were way too dry due to needing to cook longer.  I'd do again, but would uncover at the 30-35 minute mark to drain juices and broil.

The meat was dry. I used Panko breadcrumbs, and so it was just ok. Will try with Ritz crackers next time, if I have it.

Wow awesome recipe!  I normally fry my pork chops, but was looking for a good way to bake.  I think the butter helps keep them moist.  Everyone loved these.  Will definatley be making them again.  Thanks!

I made these pork chops this weekend, and everyone enjoyed them. They were a little soggy, even after removing the foil for the last few minutes, but they still tasted great! Next time I'll brown them a little longer, I think.

These are not for anyone on a diet, but they're worth every calorie!  I halved the butter to 1/4 cup, and only needed 2 eggs for our 2 large pork chops. Ritz crackers do make an excellent breading.  I took the foil off for the last 15 minutes of baking, but the breading was still a bit soggy in the end from swimming in all that butter--I flipped halfway through and also put a pat of butter on top of the chops--but it in no way took from the dish.  So easy to make, and so tasty!  Give it a try if you're tired of the many recipes that have pork chops smothered in mushroom soup.

I have been looking for a new way to make pork chops...and this was it. It was very easy to make. I had a bit of a problem with the cracker breading sticking to the pan, but all in all it was a great meal! I too used half the butter. I well definitely make this again~

Very good and soooo easy to make!  Had these whipped up and in the oven in no time.  I was a little skeptical about using crackers as bread crumbs but they were more moist than any bread crumbs!  I'm saying goodbye to bread crumbs - try this I bet you won't be disappointed.

I cook for a family who can be very picky sometime, I thought they might not like this but they really love it. I did cut the butter in half and used vegetable ritz cracker which gave it a wonderful flavor. This is recipe is a keeper.

Made this with boneless center cut pork chops. Husband LOVED it!! He said "This one is a KEEPER!"
Meat stays moist...and has plenty of flavor. I served brown rice as a side with this meal...used the clarified butter that was left on the bottom of the pan to drizzle over the rice. YUM!

This is a good base recipe but it needs some work. I use cheddar crackers and add garlic powder and rosemary to the crumbs. It makes for a good flavour. I use only a couple teaspoons of butter because I like them to be crispier. I also grate some cheddar cheese and sprinkle it on top when they come out of the oven. It is delicious!

I was alittle worried about this...just cause of my own cooking abilities...but this can be done even by me, then anyone can do it! It tasted very good, my kids liked them and so did the hubby. I don't think you need three eggs though. I also uncovered them for about 10 minutes to make it more "crunchy" on the top. Thank you!

This was super easy and very tasty.  I used egg whites and dipped teh chops in seasoned breadcrumbs.  I used 1/4 cup of butter instead of what the recipe called for.  My family loved it, and our dinner guests raved.

these were just okay.  I only used 1 egg, i don't know what you'd do w/ 3??  The bottom of the chops were a little soggy & the breading stayed in the pan when i lifted them out.  these were a different way to make pork chops but won't be making again.

I used bread crumbs instead i didn't have any crackers. And i covered the chops with foil while in the oven to keep them moist. Worked out great.

I wouldn't use this rceipe again. It was quick and easy. I baked the chops for 25 minutes and they were done but still tough and the coating was mushy and I like mine crisp. For an experienced cook, I have other tried and true recipes that are better keepers.

Wow! These were delicious! and easy to make. I usually use Shake 'n' Bake because it's so easy, but I wanted to try something new. What a great flavor! I cook the pork chops in a covered casserole to keep in the moisture but didn't allow them to brown the last 15 or 20 minutes, so they looked a little funny, but, boy, did they taste good! The second time I cooked them, I took the cover of the casserole off, and let them brown a bit. Looked great, tasted great! This is now a favorite in my family!

Tender, tasty and easy to make.  You don't need 3 eggs, two work just fine.  Also, you can get by with using some cooking spray on the bottom and 2 T. butter.  It's still very good and lower fat!

This was great.  I substituted ritz wheat c rackers instead of butter crackers.  The pork was soft and juicy.  Wonderful recipe.  Pork chops have never been more exciting.

Thank you Heather.

This turned out very well. I followed the advice of others and baked it for 30 mins, then removed the top for 10, and broiled it for the last 5 mins. I also mixed in a little bit of parm cheese into the crushed up crakers and sesonsed the pork with salt and pepper before dipping in egg and crumbs. : )

My hisband really liked them, but my daughter said they tasted "weird". I'm vegetarian, so I can only go on their reports. Keep in mind that my daughter is 16 and didn't like anything much today. I left them uncovered for the last 15 minutes to brown, and will probably uncover them for even longer the next time I make them (for my husband). A very easy recipe to put together. Served with squash and baked potatoes, for a good oven meal for a cold night. Thanks.

Overall this receipe was good.  I used Rits crackers and used virgin olive oil in the place of the butter however I believe that if I would have slow cooked this over the stove covered it would have being a little more moist and easyer to cut through.

The pork chops are wonderful served with mashed potatoes and corn. We used Ritz crackers (crushed very easy with a glass) and thin boneless pork chops.

I'm sorry but we did not care for these. The baking time was way too long and the breading was not good at all.

Not sure what I expected-hubby and I aren't big pork fans, but I think we will be now! I did add a considerable amount of parmesan cheese. Will probably try baking uncovered for a little more of the time too. Overall, this tasty/tender/simple recipe is a winner that belongs in everyone's dinner rotation.

Very, very tasty! We don't normally like pork chops so this came as a pleasant surprise. My only gripe was that the breading was too soggy. I will have to agree that removing the lid would have been a good idea.

This recipe was okay, needed a little more seasoning and mine didn't get very crispy. Next time I'll try and tweak it a little and see if I can make it work better! But not too bad! Thanks!

Very Easy! VERY TASTY! I didn't have the crackers in the house so I used homemade bread crumbs I had on hand (bought at a local specality shop) to the bread crumbs I added garlic powder (instead of the garlic salt) McCormick's Italian Seasoning, Sage and some dried minced onion. Once in the casserole dish I added the chunks of butter between the chops and the salt and pepper on top. Delicious...everyone loved it! Thanks!

These were excellent! The only thing I changed was I didn't use Ritz, I used Saltines. And I also used 1/2 of the butter that the recipe called for. Will definitely make again!

This was an AWESOME recipe! My husband and I both loved it. It's a great change from the normal pork chops. Next time I won't use as much butter though. I think it would be great with half as much. Maybe even add some jalapenos for some kick? :-P  This is something that you will want to add in to your weekly routine!!

These were really tasty. I would have liked them a bit more crunchy. The only change I made was reduce the amount of butter by half and I think it was still too much. I also tried to Broil them for the last 5 min to get them more crunchy but that didnt really help. Just need to figure out the correct texture as the flavor was there!

Didn't know what to expect.  Thought it might be too buttery with the butter crackers (Ritz) and the 1/2 c. of butter - boy, was I wrong!  They tasted wonderful and didn't give off the buttery taste I was hoping I wouldn't taste! Husband LOVED them - will be making again and soon!

I decided to try this recipe when I had short-notice company over. It was delicious (the pork chops, not the company *wink*)! I used Club crackers, garlic pepper, and omitted the salt. Thanks for the great recipe!

Well, I had to cheat and use a wheat type cracker (Can I say Wheatsworth here?).  I'm low carbing and butter crackers aren't on my diet.  I used a loin chop since that's what I had.  The flavor of this was amazing!  I'm lucky to have some leftovers which I'll reheat under the broiler.  This is a keeper!

A hit with the whole family - 2 that normally don't like breading at all! I cut down on the butter a bit, and probably would only use 1/4 cup next time. My new favorite pork chop recipe!!!

Wow this recipe is EASY and so tasteful.  I broke up oyster crackers, then added seasoned salt, seasoned pepper, garlic powder, three type of bread crumbs: Italian, Parmesan and Garlic and Herb.  I also added Parmesan cheese to the eggs.  The hardest part was pulling out the ingredients.  My husband RAVED over this recipe.  We ate it two nights in a row, and then he asked me... do we have anymore pork chop in the freezer.  He said, that is one awesome website you have found!  This dish is a KEEPER and so are all of you lovely ladies that provide recipes and tips!  Kudos to all!!!

Loved this recipe, I never make porkchops because mine always turn out so dry but I figured anything cooked in butter couldn't be that bad. 

I agree with the others it's best to flash fry them to get a nice color and to keep this moist. The hubby could not stop raving about them. I will be making these again and again.

I will make this recipe again.  I used a thick cut of chop and cut the butter down.  I will use more seasoning next time; however, the chops were tender and moist, no leftovers with this one!

it was just ok. the spices were good with the crackers. my husband said, after he ate it, "maybe you should crisp it up a little at the end". thats funny, because thats what people rating this are saying.

I'm always looking for new idea's for dinner. This is GREAT!!! My family LOVED it!! I have a picky 11 y/o and she loved it!! Pork Chops were very moist and tender. Very simple to make. I would stick w/ the butter crackers. I followed the others by removing the foil after 30 mins. They were brown & crunchy. I would make again & again!!! Thanks

Yummy!  My kids actually ate them.  That is hard to do.  Plus it's an easy pantry type of recipe.  It doesn't call for many special ingredients if you tend to have butter crackers.

I made these pork chops and they were truly the most moist and tasty I had every made.  What a simple and quick recipe that will please everyone.  They were so tender you didn't even need to use a knife.  The only thing I did different was used Whole Wheat Club crackers because is all I had on hand.  Would recommend to anyone.

My guys loved this. They were really moist but make sure not to put them on top of eachother or the ones on the bottom will get soggy. I also cut the butter to a 1/4 cup and uncovered them the last 15 min. They were great!!!! Will make them again. And again.

Really good, and I don't like pork. For a delicious buttery alternative, use crushed potato chips instead of crackers--My great Aunt always does it that way, mmmm! :)

My boyfriend really liked these and said it is the best meal I have made so far! They were a little bit soggy so I took other people's advice and broiled them uncovered for the last 10 minutes, which was very helpful.

My family loved this recipe!  I did use thick-cut, bone-in chops last time, and they were just tender enough.  A simple recipe with ingredients not too fancy.  Good stuff!

My husband is kind of a picky eater and he LOVED it! It's very moist and flavorful. I used garlic and onion poweder instead of garlic salt. Also add a little seasoning salt. Instead of butter crackers I used saltines since it's what i add on hand. Will have again soon. Might even try with chicken or beef patties next time.

It was okay. Nothing tasting too special. I used boneless chops though. I may try this again, but with thinner cuts of meat.

We really liked this recipe.  It has a good flavor, was easy to pull together.  This is a very basic base recipe that I can use to either feed kids or dress up with a few extra spices for something different.

I though these were excellent- very moist and flavorful. Also, this recipe avoids browning them first, a step that I dislike for some reason. Although I loved these, the rest of the family only said "good"

Great recipe, the coating did turn out a bit soggy, so I will do as the other reviews suggested and uncover and broil them. My picky man said they are way more tender than his favorite, Shake & Bake, but excellent flavor. Will make again!

Fantastic!  Even the 2 year old ate them for dinner!  One difference, instead of chunks of butter I melted it and then drizzled it on with a brush, fantastic, really yummy and crunch on top!  Cooking time was right on as well.

Don't know what the secret is to these chops -- maybe you shouldn't use butterfly chops.  Ours were tough and dry and the breading (which did have a great taste) was mush.  I even baked them for 20 mins uncovered to try and "crisp" them up at the advise of other reviewers.  I may try them again with bone-in chops.  Just trying to find a really good pork chop.

I vented the foil during cooking to prevent sogginess. Didn't work. Took it off last 10 minutes. Still soggy. Flipped 'em over for a bit. At least that hit the soggy side on the bottom. Maybe flipping halfway through instead of just at less than 10 mins left would have worked. SOme ground nuts would maybe add some more flavor and crunch to this.

This is a good basic recipe.  I used crushed crostini because I didn't have Ritz crackers and it turned out okay.  I will try it with the Ritz crackers next time I bet it will be even better!!  The cooking time was just right.

Thanks to many suggestions posted here I was able to spruce up this basic recipe and my family liked it a lot -- even my 7 year old who claims not to like pork chops.

Very good, I used crushed croutons and flipped them over as well, next time I'd use less butter but we really enjoyed it!

amazing moist chops.
I added curry powder and a little dill or what ever spices i feel drawn too ( really good with cajun seasoning) to the mix and omited the salt and pepper my husband now asks for these on a weekly basis.

I LOVE these pork chops!  I have never tasted pork chops that are so moist!  Ritz crackers give the perfect flavoring.  I use Smart Balance instead of butter.  A definite keeper!

Very juicy.  I used italian bread crumbs instead of crackers.  I also used olive oil spray instead of butter before I put in oven.  I took another reviewers idea and added some butter to each chop once I flipped the chops 25 minutes into cooking process.  Next time, I might put them under the broiler for the last 5 minutes just to crisp up.  Both my boyfriend and I liked these and we don't usually eat pork chops. Thanks for the recipe.

These came out very moist inside.  I used seasoned breadcrumbs instead of crackers and came out very well.

My family loved these.  Even my 4 yr old son cleared his plate...which never happens!!!  Very tender and juicy.  I used cornbread stuffing mix instead of the crushed crackers.  Will definitely use this recipe again!

These were just OK.  Not a whole lot of flavor.  I did uncover and flip them over for the last 15 minutes of baking time, so they did brown up nicely.  Will try them again, but will spice up the cracker crumbs.

This is my family's favorite pork chop.  This is how we got our toddler to start eating things other than chicken!  I add different seasonings to the breading, depending on what I'm in the mood for, but ALWAYS comes out wonderful!!!

These came out great!  I flipped them 1/2 way through and uncoverd for the last 20 min.  GREAT!  They don't taste like crackers at all - just yummy!  I also used 1/2 the butter recommended.

Pretty good! Probably would have been better had I used butter crackers, but we had none so I used saltines. I also added garlic salt, pepper, and onion powder for some more flavor.

Very good!  The reason I gave 4 stars is because this uses way to much butter!  I only used 2 tablespoons and I thought it was plenty crispy and good.  Otherwise the chops were nice and tender and very tasty.  I'll be making these for many years to come!  Thank you!

I thought the flavour of the pork chop was great...I did not have garlic powder on hand so I substituted seasoning salt...my only complaint was that the breading was a little wet...I think I would uncover for last 15-20 minutes of cook time to make it crispier!

Very good, moist chops.  I recommend uncovering the last 10-20 minutes if you want the crust to be a bit crunchy.  I also substituted olive oil for the butter and used a bit less.  They turned out great!

These are the first pork chops I've made in a long time that we both liked. VERY MOIST, which is how I remember my Mom's to be, (back when they made pork with fat on them)
Yummy! I added some Crazy Jane Salt, plus garlic powder instead of salt. Will make again soon.

I've been looking for a great pork chop recipe, and I think I've found it.  Awesome.  They get very tender.  I only gave it 4 stars because of the high fat content.  I won't be able to make these very often!  Thank you though.

These were just alright.  I added a lot more seasoning to them before baking and broiled them to crisp them up, but they just never did get crispy enough for me.

I was not impressed with these at all. I also removed the cover and broiled them so they were not so soggy. Not much flavor. I will not be making these again, but it was worth the try.

I didn't care for this much, but my husband *loved* it.  Neither kids ate much of it, so we probably won't make it much unless my husband requests it.  It was easy, though, and reminded us a little of chicken fried steak.

Great pork chops, they were very tasty and tender! The whole family loved them and the leftovers were great the next day. I would suggest the broiling tip, it did seem to dry them up a bit. I did cut down on the butter and they were still great. We will make these again.

These were fantastic! I combined Ritz crackers with the Saltines and it gave them a very buttery flavor.  Even my 9 year old who cried when she found out we were having pork cops for dinner, ate the leftovers the next day. I uncovered them halfway thru which made them crispier.  Awesome recipe!

I cut the butter in half, and I broiled them for about 3 minutes after they were done.  The breading was very tasty, and they turned out wonderfully.  They were no more 'soggy' than store-bought breaded things.  My husband even complimented me before I asked how they were!  That's a first.
