Very tasty, made for a gluten-free friend. She absolutely raved over it. I ground almonds in a coffee mill for the almond meal. Important to cut bars while warm, as they set very firmly after a couple of hours.  Would definitely make it again.

Really good! Easy, tasty, gluten-free without being dry, and ... did I mention it's tasty?
