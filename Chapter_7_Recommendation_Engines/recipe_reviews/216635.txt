I don't drink almond milk so I used nonfat milk in it's place. I also used my own homemade sugar-free chocolate syrup and I used a whole teaspoon of almond extract. Just what I needed for an afternoon pick-me-up after a long morning. This would make a good summer coffee drink, blended with ice.

This tasted pretty good. It reminded me of a coffee version of a toasted almond ice cream. I did change a few things as the other reviewer. I used very vanilla soy milk that is on the store shelves instead of almond flavor. I didn't have the time to make espresso so I used a Tblsp. approximately of a good brand of instant coffee mixed in about 1/4 cup of water. To reduce the sugar I used lite chocolate syrup instead of regular. And, just heated the coffee and the rest of the ingredients in the microwave for 1 minute instead of a pot to also save time. (Be careful not to add too much extract it will go from tasting lightly of almond to a strong alcohol almond taste. One drop is definitely plenty per cup) Once it was done I topped it with whipped cream and crushed sliced almonds. It made a nice almond treat!

Purchased vanilla almond milk.  Had to make this recipe as soon as I found it - Yum!  I used some leftover morning brew and warmed it all in a big mug in the microwave.  My coffee loving kids will like this with decaf for an after school treat.  So much cheaper than a coffee shop.

This sounded like a wonderful recipe, but after I made it exactly as written, the almond extract overpowered the delicious Almond Vanilla milk. I added more, and I just could not get the nasty smell of the almond extract, nor the oily taste from the almond extract to lessen. This was wonderful without the almond extract. I will definitely make again.

I used almond flavored almond milk so I omitted the almond extract. I used an expresso chocolate topping my sister sent me for Christmas in place of regular chocolate syrup. Overall this was pretty tasty. Next time I would like to add some fresh whipped cream and a sprinkle of cinnamon. Very easy to make whether on the stove or microwave.

I'm not a huge fan of almond flavor, but I liked this more than I expected to.  I did not heat the milk, but used brewed strong dark roast coffee and just added the other ingredients.   I agree with Sarah Jo's review that this would be wonderful blended with ice.  I think I would like it even more!
