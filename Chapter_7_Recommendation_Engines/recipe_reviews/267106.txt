Plan on doubling this recipe to save yourself an extra trip to the store. They will disappear very quickly. They are that good. These are a must try if you are a fan of the salt and vinegar flavor combo. No changes needed, this is perfect as written. Thanks for a great recipe France C.!

Too vinegary for me, but I did like the way it was crispy on the outside and soft in the middle.

My husband thought these were ok. I didn’t like them at all. Tasted nothing like salt & vinegar chips. Kids didn’t like them either. Wouldn’t make again.

Got an air fryer for Christmas and thought I would try some simpler recipes, this being one of them. Fam thought the overall flavor was good [personally thought too much vinegar but that may be I left them soaking for about an hour as I had to run out]. My son and I couldn't decide about the consistency though. Yes, a bit crispy on the outside and soft on the inside but didn't quite come together as I thought it would. I made a double batch at once so maybe that's why they didn't come out as expected. Always willing to try something new so thanks for the recipe. Jury still out so not sure if I will make again.

I was surprised at the consistency. I was expecting them to be 'crunchy'... like honey roasted nuts. The shells had a little crunchiness but, the insides of the chickapeas was a bit soft.
