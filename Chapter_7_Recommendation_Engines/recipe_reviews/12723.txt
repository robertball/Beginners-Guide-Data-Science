YUM! The family really liked this for our 7 fish deast on Christmas Eve. HINT: Once you scrub the clams, put them in a bowl of cold water and sprinkle 1 T corn meal over them. Let them sit for half and hour then rinse and cook. This cornmeal "snack" feeds them and they spit out any sand they have inside in favor of the cornmeal. Learned this trick from Cooking Light.

I'm giving this recipe 4 stars for several reasons.  I cooked it as directed, except for the amount of clams, and felt several things were out of sink.  First, 2 cups of wine is more then needed, 1 cup would be plenty. Secondy, I would increase the amount of red pepper flakes to 2 teaspoons, for a little extra kick.  With that said, I thought this was real good as is, but could have been better.  What really blew my mind was the amount of clams it called for....."36 small clams in shell"....to serve 6.  Are you serious??  I cooked up 5# of small calms, about 150-200 clams, and had enough sauce left over for 100 more. Who eats just 6 clams?  Anyway....I'm sure I will make this again, with the changes I mentioned.

wonderful recipe! i made this as an appetiser this evening for my boyfriend (he is milano italian, extremely picky eater) and myself.i served it with extra fresh parsley and lemon wedges, crusty bread. was only able to eat two clams because my boyfriend hogged the bowl and ate everything, but i was just happy dipping the bread in the broth. It's great (the sauce) on spaghetti too. excellent with a glass of good white wine

I have made this recipe several times.  I put the clams and sauce over linguine and it is wonderful. My father used to make linguine and clam sauce all the time and it took me a long time to find a recipe that is nearly as good, this is it.... Great recipe...

There should be a 5+ star option on here!!! All I'm going to say is "Oh my gosh...." ironically, that was all that was said while my fiancee and his friends *inhaled* all 40 clams. The only change I made was doubling the garlic (that's just our personal taste - severe garlic lovers!!)

We were looking for a recipe that we could recreate at home to one of our favorite appetizers, this recipe is the closet we have found, substituting chicken broth for the white wine made it perfect!

We did not like this at all. I used a Chardonnay wine. Maybe that was the wrong wine to use.  Too much oregano and parsley.

Very tasty and easy to make.  It is great as a meal or an appetizer.  Remember the dipping bread, that is the best part.

This recipe was just delicious and so very easy! We went to a restaurant and ordered clams and they were excellent but my husband thought that these clams were even better!! Big compliment, coming from a critic.  My son even loved them too.

Ive been doing this recipe for a few years now, although i also put shrimp and throw some fresh basil(makes a huge difference). This is served well over angel hair pasta, and you can still dip your bread. Really good recipe.

Delicious, but needs more zing.  Try fresh basil instead of Oregano.  Also finely chopped roma tomato and serve with a handfull of green onion tops chopped fine.  Squeeze of lemon and good to go.  Use small, sweet and tender clams.  Larger clams might be easier to eat, but this dish is not intended to be anything but an appetizer or light meal, so who cares if the clams are massive, Lizzy!  Yuck, they are way too meaty for this delicate recipe.

Wonderful!  Restaurant-quality dish!  The broth is truly amazing - definitely need bread to dip.  And it's easy - what could be better?

Excellent dish.  Easy to prepare even though it looks and tastes gourmet.  My boyfriend loved it.  I added mussels and served it over linguine.  Next time I think I will add clam juice as one reviewer suggested. This was worthy of being served at a dinner party or for a special occassion.  I can't wait to make this again!

This recipe was right up our alley!  We enjoyed a local fresh catch of the day and made about 200 clams.  My family enjoys the sauce over linguine so I was pleased that the recipe made so much.  I doubled the recipe with the exception of the clams and used several pounds.  I subbed beer for the wine because, well, we drank all of it earlier LOL  - it was vacation after all!  Fantastic recipe enjoyed by all.

Actually, my boyfriend made this for my birthday dinner a few months ago.  It turned out great, except that he didn't know you're supposed to soak the clams before cooking so they release all the sand and other grossness...I feel that should be added to the recipe instructions for newer cooks!

Otherwise, great recipe as-is.

Delicious - delicate tasting but full of flavor. I halved the broth ingredients as I was using smaller clams (pre-shelled when hubby caught them), and I added a few frozen julienned carrots and some sliced mushrooms to the broth about 4 or 5 minutes before taking off the stove. Next time I think I may reduce the oregano a bit like another reviewer suggested.

This had good flavor and the clams were tasty.  Next time I make, not so much oregano, used fresh parsley.

DELICIOUS and a life-saver for me when my dad randomly came home with a bag of clams...and asked ME to cook them. I will definitely save this recipe for the future. Another page on this website told me something essential to cooking clams and that is that you can tell when clams, unlike mussels, are fully cooked when their shells open, and this takes about 4 minutes. I made the mistake of cooking my first dozen clams for 15 minutes, and although they were still good, they were a bit chewy. 4 minutes was perfect and so were my next dozen clams :) thanks!

Restaurant quality recipe.  Flavor is unbelievable. Definitely a favorite of mine but My only problem (and it has nothing to do with the recipe) is that no matter how much I seem to clean the clams I get sand! Any suggestions from anyone?

I've made this for special guests who know "good food".  They all, myself included, LOVE this dish!!  I used a Sauvignon Blanc although you could use a Chardonnay.  I also changed all wine to 1/2 wine, 1/2 chicken broth.  I serve it with Ciabatta (my personnal favorite) but have made this with linguini.  Wonderful! One of my all time favorites!

The white wine sauce smelled and tasted wonderful.  I used fresh oregano and parsley, took someone's idea and served with Italian bread.  It made a lovely firs course.

I also agree with the individual that gave this recipe one star.  The finished product definately had too much oregano and parsley and masked any other flavors.  I'm giving this two stars though b/c I think it has potential and perhaps I also used the wrong wine.  After I added fresh lemon juice, salt, pepper, and fresh parmesan the broth was tolerably palatable.  I will not be following this recipe again.

AMAZING. We made this with 100 manila steamer clams and it was SO GOOD! Our few tweaks were fresh parsley, a pinch of dried onion and fresh squeezed lemon juice. Even our 9yr old raved!

Wonderful!Love this sooo much. My husband used to be disgusted at the sight of clams, so I bought some for myself and made this recipe, the house smelled amazing, and it convinced him to try this, since then he has becoe a clam addict, and my father in law put the juice in a cup and started drinking it =(. Also I used chicken broth, i didnt have any wine.

Excellent. I used fresh parsley and cooking wine (which has salt added). Next time I will use regular wine because it was a little salty - but still delicious - and very easy to make!

This was wonderful!!  I didn't have all the ingredients, so I used a cup of chicken broth instead of wine, my kids don't really like the taste of wine in cooking. I also used fresh parsley chopped up, and left out the oregano and pepper flakes. My 10 yr. old son had 3 helpings! My 13 yr. old daughter loved it! I made it with stuffed clams and a salad. It was a very quick dinner, and everybody loved it! This is definatly a keeper! Thanks Bonnie!!

What a great recipe! Easy, beautiful. I felt like I was back in Italy! Really! We had an abundance of clams that we dug that morning, and I was looking for a good recipe that wasn't chowder, etc. This was perfect. Its an easy one that will definitely "WOW" company! I highy recommend it.

great recipe, i reduced the wine by 1 cup and added half a chicken bullion cube for more flavor.  I also reduced the oregano by half.  Otherwise very good.  Served it with pasta.

This is a fantastic recipe! I usually serve this dish over linguine, but most recently, I cooked the clams and sauce in a large foil pan on the grill and served it with crusty Italian bread as an appetizer. Received many compliments. And you can freeze the leftover sauce for another meal -- just add some fresh clams.

Yeah, it was really good. I used one teaspoon oregano and and a half teaspoon of red pepper. My son and I ate about 5 pounds of clams. Also had bread and salad. Like I said...really good.

So simple and so delicious!  I made this recipe tonight.  I nearly tripled the amount of clams and there wasn't a single clam left.  My son alone ate more than two dozen of them.  I served them with linguini.  The clams and the broth were perfect with the pasta.

I grew up in Seattle Washington and pride myself on knowing good seafood.  This is a great recipe and very easy to make.  My two and three year old enjoyed it as well.  Try sour dough with the meal, I think it brings out some very subtle flavors.  Good recipe.

This was so good and so easy. I reduced the amount of butter and wine just a tad, and used fresh parsley. I could have drank the sauce, it was that good.

Soooooo good!  One of the best clam recipies I have tried thus far.  Delicious with crusty bread for dipping and a salad.  Make sure to use quality wine for this as it makes a big difference!  What you don't use in the recipie enjoy with your meal!

There seems to be some confusion re: size and type of clams used in this recipe. I sought this recipe out after trying a similar appetizer in a Cape Cod restaurant where cherrystones(small quahogs were used. It's a bigger, meatier clam and a perfect appetizer served with crostini for dipping.Steamer clams..while good, don't do this recipe justice (in my opinion) as an appetizer as they are so small. They would be better served with this recipe if served over linguini. My favorite additions to the broth include cilantro,lime and chopped red pepper. This is THE PERFECT appetizer for any shellfish lover. Thank you!

This was outstanding! I've never made clams before, but order them often when we're out. I was tempted by all the great reviews, and I've gotta tell you, these were just awesome. I can't believe how easy these were to make and will be making them often. My husband even loved them and he isn't the biggest fan. The other clam lovers that were here couldn't stop raving them. BRAVO! notes: I only had cooking wine on hand, and felt it worked fine. I made one batch as a test, left the broth on the range and only added butter to make the second batch. Everyone loved the broth for dipping their crusty bread in.

I would definitely reduce the amount of wine and add more garlic. The flavor was a little diluted with the amount of wine. Tasted great, but I went without the red pepper and won't do that next time I make it. It did need a little kick.

I've made this recipe many, many times for friends and family and it's always wonderful.  I live in the Pacific Northwest where clams are plentiful on the beaches so trying to find different ways to prepare them is fun.  The only thing I do differently in this recipe is use a lot more clams than the recipe calls for, I cook them in batches since they won't all fit into my pan and I just keep adding more to the same broth as the others cook and are removed.  I also use fresh parsley since we never seem to have dried ones and instead of wine, we use chicken broth like someone else suggested.

First and foremost, hold back on the wine with this one!! The sauce comes out way to watery/thin. I would like to try the recipe again, but this time I will reduce the wine and possibly add a little flour to thicken the sauce up. Flavor was good. I tossed it with fettucini and served with fresh, Italian bread.

excellent recipe, I would reduce the amount of wine.  Also, we used unsalted butter but it tasted salty.  Don't know what made it salty.

This recipe is outstanding!  I would not change a thing.  I used it as a appetizer. Dipping Italian bread in the broth is a great idea too!


Thank you so much for sharing this recipe.

My favorite recipe on this site! I've never made clams before, but this was easy, fast, and my boyfriend LOVED it (even though he's not a seafood fan). As other users suggested, we put the clams and sauce on top of some spaghettini, although, I think the sauce was a bit thin, so next time I'll just sop it up with Italian bread. I will also probably chop up some tomato and put it in at the end.  Overall - amazing.

Much too brothy.  Lacked depth of flavor. Not sure how to fix it.  Need enough liquid to steam the clams, but the broth/sauce needs butter, olive oil and undiluted seasonings.  Won't make it this way again.

Just tried this today. Used fewer clams because they were really large.   RESULTS:   PRO: Tastes good enough to serve in a restaurant. Broth really smells and tastes delicious. Easy to save all that broth to put on pasta later.   CON: clams a bit tough even though I removed them right when they popped open. I thought the oregano flavor was just a bit too strong. I probably shouldn't have used oregano. I thought it was perfect with just garlic and parsley.  Also I simmered too long and broth got just a bit too salty.  4 stars because the flavor was very good but not mind blowing.   Next time:  Less or no oregano. Unsalted butter  Figure out how to get more tender clams.

My boyfriend just returned from a fishing trip to B.C. He brought back a bunch of fresh clams. He had me get a recipe on our favorite site, All Recipes, and we came up with this one. OMG is all I can say. It is heavenly. I would have to agree with the other reviewer though that you could cut the butter and wine in half. I did use a homemade Chardonnay and it was delicious. And dipping your bread is a must. Kudos!!

thought i would give this one a try, 1/2 cup of butter sounded like a lot, so i changed a few things. First i just used 1/8 cup butter. and since i didnt have any wine i substituted apple juice. also i added cream to make it a yummy creamy sauce to go with the clams.kept all the other spices called for. im not much if a clam eater, but my father in-law ate the entire batch and asked if there was more.

FABULOUS.  Absolutely loved it.  I also used 1 tablespoon of red pepper flakes, and it was PERFECT.  I usually use Scott Ure's Clams from this site, but I think this recipe is definitely better.  The only change I made was to add 2 tablespoons of chopped garlic.  Unlike other reviewers, I think the red pepper flakes and 2 cups of white wine is perfect for this recipe - it makes a GREAT dipping sauce for crispy bread like Pugliese, Olive bread or Rosemary bread!  Bon appetit - this is phenomenal... thanks for the recipe!

It was good but why o why would you add that much red pepper flakes?  I only put 1/2 t., and it was still too hot. I used mussels and shrimp and served over thin spaghetti.

If you're serving this as an appetizer 36 clams may be enough.  But if you want this as a meal, make sure you increase the amount because they certainly won't last. The recipe is excellent.  Try serving mussels this way (which I like even better than clams.)  Thanks for sharing!

This came out great!  I cooked the clams exactly to recipe.  Then I made this into an entree by tossing some of the broth into cooked spaghetti and then topping the pasta with the mussels.  There were tons of mussels left over so then we had second helpings the "appetizer" way...just mussels in the broth and then used bread for dipping.  It was wonderful both ways.  Will definitely use this one again.

Everyone loved this.  Even my 6 year old who turned up her nose when I was cooking them.  I did change the wine to chicken stock. I used littleneck clams, so I just made a 100 count bag.

Yum-bola!  I, too, had never made clams before, but now that I know how easy it is to prepare a delicious clams appetizer, I'll make them often.  I did heed some of the other reviewers' remarks about the amount of broth, and halved the broth recipe while keeping the specified amount of clams.  Still had plenty of yummy broth to sop up with some crusty bread.  I do agree that 6 servings is a stretch - it's too tasty to just eat 6 clams.

Not only is this delicious with clams but also with mussels and my personal favorite; the true little steamer clams (ones with the tails). And yes Bonnie, a nice loaf of Italian or French bread to sop up all those wonderful flavors is a must! Thanks so much!!

I’ve learned from Rick Moonem  to steam clams separately in cup of wine  and splash of water remove them as they JUST open , set aside , strain the juice in fine strainer lined with cheese cloth. then sauté  garlic, shallots, butter, more wine, etc  Add clams to heat. Great flavor, no grit.

I loved this recipe. I could only get a dozen little neck clams so I added a half dozen Argentinian shrimp and cut the recipe back to two servings which is great for two appy's or a meal for one. Crusty bread is a must so I made Ciabatta Bread , the recipe is by Marina and on this site. After cleaning the clams I placed them in a bowl of water and added a good sprinkling of corn mean that the clams will ingest, something that my Dad always did. This will result in the clams releasing any sand that may be in the shell.  I cooked these for four minutes, shaking the pan occasionally. Great recipe, thanks for sharing.

This was really good as is. I used fresh herbs and added basil, but I think it would have been just as good without the addition. My kids ate this, and even my husband, who's even pickier than the kids, ate this. I served this over homemade noodles and sprinkled with Parmesan cheese. Will absolutely make this again!

The recipe was very good. I used only 2 cloves of garlic, to give it a softer flavour, and we ate al the clams in two people only. I'll do it again for sure!!

Tried it! loved it! so easy and quick to make, without any problems. Sister loved it, she kept saying "hmm it's so good" throughout dinner. My only edit would be less wine and more red pepper flakes, I like it spicier and with more of a subtle wine flavor, sister liked the wine flavor, she hardly noticed it. Overall excellent recipe and tweak to your own liking would be my only suggestion. We had it over linguine and with bread, sister loved the bread to soak in the sauce, just as others had suggested....Do try this recipe!

Overall the recipe as is is a good starting block. I added a little more garlic and red pepper flake, tsp of salt and pepper, some basil and diced onoin. Also, I did not use 2 full cups of wine (Pinot Grigio). Instead I used a small can of minced clams with it's juice and filled the can twice with white wine (approximately 1 cup). I also added some diced potato. It was pretty darn good. Great for dipping bread, and the potato added a little substance so it could be eaten as a soup as well.

This is phenomonal.  Very simple recipe.  We serve it over linguine tossed with canned white clam sauce.   The only change we make is serve about a dozen clams per person.

This was the first time I have ever made clams, and I absolutely LOVED them. Restaurant quality! The reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is because I ended up only adding 1 cup of wine instead of 2 as another suggested.

This is a good recipe but the wine was just too much and overpowering for us. I made it again the next day because we just all love clams and instead of 2 cups of wine, I used only 1 and used 1 1/2 cups of chicken stock. 36 clams for 6 people is also not realistic.  Between 3 people, we easily had 4 pounds of clams (which was way more than 36) and could have had more.

I made this recipe today.  Loved it!!!!! Crab legs, cole slaw and mini ears of corn rounded it out.  No white wine in the house, so chicken stock.  Increased the pepper flakes to a tablespoon.  Perfect.

Absolutely wonderful. This was my first time making clams, and this recipe is easy and impressive. I only gave it four stars because I will omit the red pepper flakes from now on (though I know they were optional, I wanted to try it). They make the dish too spicy for me. Otherwise this dish is great! Thanks

Excellent!  First time I've ever tried steamed clams, and it was a big hit!  Knowing the spice tolerance of my guest, I replaced the red pepper flakes with about a teaspoon or so of Old Bay.  Also thickened the sauce with corn starch.  Wonderful results!!  I'll put it over linguine next time!

My son and his girlfriend came to dinner last night. I wanted to make something a little "different" for them, so following many of the suggestions by other posters, we had this dish in its main course form with 5 lb of mahogany clams. I reduced the wine by half, replacing it with chicken broth and used 3 T of grated garlic. This one goes into permanent record!

My son is scarfing them down as I write.  Said these are the best clams he has ever eaten (he's 8). Tweaked the recipe as I was out of oregano.  One cup of wine, butter, parsley, fresh garlic and a dash of granulated garlic made this recipe fabulous, easy and very quick.

I agree with other reviewers' comments that it's way too much wine and oregano. Used half cup of wine and there's about 1 cup of liquid left at the end. And too much oregano even for 2 cups of wines. I used Sauv.Bl the first time and too tannic and acid. The second time I used a drinkable chardonnay and turned out way better. Reduce dried oregano (organic) to 1 teaspoon, you can always add more afterwards, but you can't take it back once there. Also added the red pepper flakes the 2nd time, and the taste of the broth completely changed, therefore be cautious about the amount used.

There was too much wine in this recipe, I think between half a cup and one cup would be sufficient. Also, some added lemon juice gives it just an extra kick!

This was delicious!  I made it for my fiance and I for dinner and we absolutely loved it!  The sauce was so good we decided to save the leftovers and use it on pasta.

Very good recipe. The only thing I did differently was to add fresh parsley instead of dried. I make this twice a month. Even my sons (7 & 5) like this one.

I've never made clams before and I decided to make this recipe for Christmas eve. Everyone raved about them! My husband said that they're the best clams he ever had. I don't eat clams, but the sauce smelled delicious!

I made this tonite for dinner, exactly as it was written.  WONDERFUL!! Don't change a thing!!! My husband at first thought it was to garlic-y but then as he ate the clams he said it was like we were out for a very expensive dinner!  Everyone loved them - including my 4 year old daughter!  Make sure you get alot of bread - this sauce is amazing!  5 Stars!!!!!  thank you!

This recipe was excellent. I didn't have wine ( I realized this after I bought the clams) so I used 2 C chicken broth instead and it was awesome. I love the red pepper in this recipe. I makes a huge and tasty difference!

This is pretty good, dipped crusty Italian bread in the broth and was in heaven.
