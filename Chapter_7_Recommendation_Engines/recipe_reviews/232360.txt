Well, this is the closest as I've been able to find to my grandmother's recipe.  I,,,,we only have fried green tomatoes when we have Catfish and hushpuppies.  I salt the slices for a while and dab off the water.  Then I put them in flour and let them set for a while.  Before making the hushpuppies, I dredge the catfish in the cornmeal/salt and pepper, and let them set a while.  I then dredge the tomatoes in the flour and let them set.  I set the table and heat up the deep fryer, then I dip the tomatoes into the egg/milk (instead of water) and then into the cornmeal.  I let them set.  Each time you let the flour or cornmeal set, it "glues" itself to the food.  I then mix up the flour egg/milk and cornmeal with some baking powder and minced onion, onion powder and make the hushpuppy dough.  Well, I got off the subject, but I hope this helps someone.

Fantastic recipe although I didn't use any cornmeal, instead, I used Panko crumbs.  I find that the cornmeal gives it a heavier taste and holds more oil than panko crumbs do.  I also gave them a quick spin in the blender to make them a bit finer.  It worked like a charm.  I added some cayenne pepper to the flour and left the salt out until the minute I took them out of the pan.   I placed them on a rack on a rimmed baking sheet so that the air could circulate around them and put them into a preheated oven of 275F while I cooked off the rest of them.   WOW!   They are AMAZING and were perfectly browned AND not greasy AT ALL!   Great recipe!

This Carolina Girl LOVED it! Add a dash of salt as soon as they come out of the pan!

Easy, tangy, and tasty.  Make sure you slice your tomatoes thin, so they cook through and through.  I would make these again.

2 cups of cornmeal to the 1 cup of flour if you want that "gritty" the  Southerns go for. Everyone prefers them differently though. I am from Missouri and so were my grandma's. One did them 2 parts flour to one part cornmeal and the other did 2 parts cornmeal to one part flour so it is just a matter of personal preference I suppose. Either way, the one thing I recommend is lightly salting them right out of the fryer and eat them while they are hot.

This is a very good recipe. I added a little cayenne pepper to the flower to spice it up a bit. The batter sticks to the tomato slices well. I saved this to use again. Thanks!!

I used milk in the dredge instead of water.  Flavor was good.  Make sure that you add plenty of salt and pepper to the cornmeal.  Also, needed more cornmeal than this called for to do three tomatoes.

Super simple, quick and easy. I drizzled them with a little Frank's Red Hot Sauce.  That's it.  Great as a side dish or a snack.

I made the recipe using really yummy homegrown green tomatoes and did not make any changes.  I served the, with homemade pesto and ranch dressing.  

The end result seemed more trouble than it was worth to me. I would call it a two, but my guy liked it a lot (maybe because he didn’t fry it?) so I averaged to three stars.

Maybe I’ll make salsa with the rest of the tomatoes?

Excellent recipe! Simplicity is best here and the flavor of the tomatoes really came through and the crunch from the cornmeal was perfect. A+!

I have eaten plenty of fried green tomatoes, but this was my first time cooking it.  It turned out perfect! I did have to add some more cornmeal to the bowl. I already had white cornmeal so that’s what I used and my husband and I both loved it! Thanks for the recipe!

I am from a small Alabama town, raised on a farm with no knowledge of a grocery store until I was about 11 years old. We here all of our own food, including sugar, flour and meal. And these, the fried green tomatoes, never had corn meal in them. Try them the way we had them also. You could like one better than the other. Put them in a egg dip, and dredge them in flour. Spring with salt and pepper. So good. Pulls the natural tanginess and tart from the tomatoes. Fry until golden or for a healthier version, start in frying pan, and bake to finish. Good either way
