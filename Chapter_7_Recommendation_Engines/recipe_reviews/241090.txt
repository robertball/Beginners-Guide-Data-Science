This is my first review I think, because this was so good! I cook a *lot* of Asian food, lol. 
 I didn’t have some ingredients, and I doubled the marinade/sauce, because we always like extra sauce for the rice underneath. I didn’t measure how much I put on the pork to marinade though, just what looked like enough. I also put the garlic and fresh grated ginger (I have a rasp I use on both the garlic and ginger, a lot of my Asian recipes call for both), right into the marinade, instead of putting them in later. 
The veggies I had on hand were fresh broccoli, carrots, green onions and a can of water chestnuts. I usually cook them first, and saw that other reviewers suggested it too. I stir fried/steamed the broccoli and carrots  but under cooked them, so they wouldn’t get too done when mixed in at the end. 
I put them on a plate, and drained the pork of the marinade. I stir fried it, breaking it up into batches, so the wok wasn’t over crowded. After it  all was done, I added back the rest of the pork and marinade, and brought it to a boil, so I could thicken it with a slurry of cornstarch and water. Once it was thickened, I added back the steamed veggies, water chestnuts, chopped green onions (3). I then drizzled some sesame oil on top, and sprinkled sesame seeds on it. 
Oh, I’m really not comfortable frying with sesame oil, I use it as a finishing oil. I fry in an asian stir fry oil tha

Made as written and although I would have preferred fresh veggies over the frozen, it was perfect for a night in which I was pressed for time. The pork stayed SUPER tender and even after being reheated the next day. Thanks for the great recipe!

This is a great recipe! My son really doesn’t like pork dishes, but he liked this. I stuck with the basic recipe for the most part, but subbed oyster sauce for the hoisin sauce, because that’s what I had on hand. I also added 2 Tbsp honey to the sauce, and used onion powder instead of chopped onion. I used pork tenderloin, cut into thin strips. I added the sauce to the meat while I cut up veggies, then made a triple batch of sauce while I was cooking the meal. After the veggies were cooked, I removed them to a large bowl & added the extra sauce to the skillet & thickened it with a little corn starch slurry, then poured the meat back in. Delicious!

Made it with fresh veggies (peppers, scallions, carrots and mushrooms) and chicken vice pork. Also added some honey and hot sesame oil to the sauce.  Served over brown rice and it was excellent!

I didn't have hoisin sauce so that was missing but we really enjoyed it.  I will purchase the missing ingredient and make again.

I substituted the frozen veg for fresh Korean cabbage, kale, and cauliflower, served over rice. I also had no hoisin sauce, and used coconut oil to fry everything in. Turned out marv. I didn't rank it a 5 star , because I am waiting for the boys to get home!
