I much prefer this casserole to the standard plate of corned beef, potatoes and cabbage. The phyllo dough, Swiss Cheese and mustard wine sauce makes it so very tasty! You can prepare this the day before and simply throw it in the oven when guests arrive, so YOU can entertain while the oven does the work. I hope you like it as much as I do! (You might try a little less black pepper. My new black pepper was spicier than my other, and 1 tsp would have been plenty.)

I think this was ok except in my opinion, it had too much potatoes and not enough corned beef and cabbage. When I made the mustard mixture, I had to make a another with less pepper because 2 tsp. of pepper is just way too overpowering! I didn't have phillo dough so I substituted cornbread mix. It worked out really well and was a good flavor addition to the corned beef and cabbage. I also didn't have Swiss cheese at the time so I used Parmesan/Romano. That worked out alright in a pinch

What a delicous and unique idea for St. Pats leftovers.  My Super old fashioned Irish grandfather thought it was a SIN to mix the Irish heritage with the Greek but once he took a bite.  He was Hooked.  Trust me, if he liked it, it had to be good

Good flavor, but a once a year recipe.  To cut some prep time, I used a seamless Pillsbury Crescent Dough Sheet instead of phyllo as the cook noted. Also, I purchased pre-cooked corned beef, and pre-cut cabbage from a bag with carrots (nice addition). Even with my short cuts, took more than 1+ 1/2 hours. Left out the pepper because of the kids, and didn't need the butter on the dough. Next time I will add more cheese because we like cheese!

I used this for my St Pats leftovers and it worked out really well! I wasn't a huge fan of the Filo dough with it so next time I think I'll try a sheet of crescent rolls or something along those lines.
