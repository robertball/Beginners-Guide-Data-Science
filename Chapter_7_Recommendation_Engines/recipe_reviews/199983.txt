oh my!, these are really, really good.  I used fresh green beans and fresh garlic.  I cut the sugar in half and it was fine(always find recipes to be to sweet).  I will be making these again and they will show up on the holiday table.  Caught my son dipping bread in the sauce.  Thanks for sharing.  YUM, YUM!!

I agree with SWEETJAM  who previously reviewed this recipe making 2 alterations.   With the reduction in sugar (used 1/2 of what the recipe called for) and using 1 fresh minced clove of garlic, this was a HUGE hit at dinner last night. Way better than I expected.

GREAT recipe! I cut the sugar amount in half like others, and it worked great. However, by drizzling the sauce on top of everything, it made some bites unevenly stronger than the others. Maybe you could mix the beans, sauce and bacon together before baking and that would help? Overall, a great recipe that I will use again.

Oh. My. God. So I have to be honest. I picked this recipe over the various others because of the fact that you bake it. This is much easier when making a large Christmas dinner. I was VERY worried how it would taste, the brown sugar part was making everyone make faces. So I took the suggestion of others and halved the brown sugar. As I was worried about the sauce permeating through all the beans, I also added 50% more sauce. Turns out this second part was not needed, but taking the brown sugar down by half was. IT WAS PERFECT. Everyone LOVED it. The only other changes I made was that I did cut the bacon into smaller pieces before microwaving, but I still layed it on top, and used enough to cover the beans. I also used frozen beans, and 4 bags worked well. We will definitely be using this recipe again!

Huge disappointment. 40 min @ 350 = extremely over cooked beans and I used fresh beans.Can't imagine what canned beans would have been like since are already partially cooked.I used half the sugar and they were way too sweet. Used only 5 tsp soya, 7 would have been too much. Used one clove fresh minced garlic; that was good.  Overall these beans had a nice flavour but they were overcooked, too sweet and too greasy. If I tried this recipe again I would make the sauce with less sugar, less soya and less butter, I would steam the beans, cook the bacon with the garlic, make the sauce and pour it over the cooked beans. But guess that would be a whole new recipe.

Loved these!! I used a pound of fresh green beans, just covered the beans when I baked, diced up the bacon and fried it then added a little bit of butter to the bacon grease so it would equal 1/4 c. I took the suggestions of cutting the sugar in half and then I just added the soy sauce slowly until I liked the flavor. Also used minced garlic instead of the powder. I'll make these again.

really good! I halved the recipe for 3 people, 5 servings. I cooked the bacon about 1/2 way in a pan, then cut into smaller pieces, added to 2 cans of green beans into a 8x8 baking dish, then tossed to coat with the sauce. I tasted a bean 1/2 way thru cooking and added more soy sauce to make it less sweet.  My boyfriend really liked, and ate the extras :)

Excellent!  I used fresh green beans and halved the brown sugar.  (If using fresh green beans, cover the dish when baking to allow the beans to steam.)  A keeper!

Yum! I will definitely use this recipe again. I used fresh green beans, about 1.5 lbs i think and cut the other ingredients in half. I wish i made more. It was very good.

This is one of the best green bean recipes I have ever tasted.  I cook for a homeless shelter once a month and I made these beans to go with their meal and everyone loved them.  I also have made them for a church potluck and there wasn't a single bean left.  The only thing I do differently with the recipe is that I completely cook the bacon ahead of time, crumble it and add it to the green beans before I pour the butter mixture over them.  This recipe is definitely a keeper!

None of us cared for these. Way too sweet, and DH didn't like all the soy sauce. He thought they were supposed to be a chinese recipe. Too bad, because I really had high hopes, and this makes a LOT.

I have a very similar recipe that omits the butter.  It does not diminish the taste at all.  Also, if you marinate the beans in the sauce a few hours or overnight, the flavor is greatly enhanced.

Made these today for Easter dinner.  I used 2 - 1 lb pkgs of frozen green beans thawed.  We browned and drained the bacon first.  While the bacon was cooking we cooked the beans and onions in a little water to tender crisp and drained.   Did not have any soy sauce so used 4 tsps Worchestershire sauce and only 1/3 cup Splenda brown sugar and added extra garlic.  Also added 1 can of sliced water chestnuts (diced) and 1/2 cup sliced almonds for extra crunch. Made this on the stovetop for ease.  Would not have altered the recipe, but found we were missing ingredients after we had started cooking!

Yum Yum and Easy Easy!  I ended up using 2 (30 oz.) cans of green beans, half of the brown sugar, and used the pre-cooked bacon pieces found near the salad dressing in the grocery store.  Oh, and used minced garlic.  A keeper!

Not really sure how to rate this since I didn't actually try it myself. The only thing I did different to the recipe was to use 100oz. of green beans instead of 75oz. Took it to a church potluck. My mom said that there was too much green beans to get the full effect of the flavor. She also said it was too sweet. I will have to make it again soon using the right amount of green beans for just my family and see what they think of it. Next time I will probably cut up the bacon and mix it throughout instead of just laying it on top in whole slices, and lessen the brown sugar by a little bit. This was definitely very easy to make and I'm sure it will be a yummy dish once I use all the right proportions.

Great flavors! We did make some alterations: Chopped up 8 slices of bacon and pan-fried until crispy and rendered. Sauteed 2 pounds of fresh green beans in the bacon drippings. Omitted the butter. Half the amount of sugar. 2 cloves of fresh garlic. Delicious - loved how the sauce made a nice glaze on the bacon and beans! Will definitely make again.

Didn't have time to bake these in the oven, so I tried it on the stove top as others have. The flavors married really well and it was a nice change of pace as green beans are not my favorite vegetable. Thank you KamiShay for sharing this recipe; can't wait to try these baked!

My husband loved these, but I thought they were too greasy.  This may have been my fault though in not cooking the bacon long enough before laying it on the beans.  I cut the recipe down to 4 servings, which used 2 cans of green beans.

Easy crowd pleaser!  I took the advice of the other reviewers and cut the brown sugar by about half and also cut some of the soy sauce and used minced garlic.  The beans turned out wonderfully!  I took them to a church group event and every bean was eaten!!!  Now I plan to serve them at my mom's for thanksgiving.  I may even let them marinate in the sauce overnight before cooking the day of. . .

This is a great recipe! I actually just fried all the ingredients together and didn't worry about putting it in the oven! The whole family loved it! I used fresh garlic instead of garlic powder!

Very good stuff. I did half the recipe because I didn't need such a large dish. I cut the sugar by half and added some dried minced onion. We really enjoyed this one!!

I don't like the usual green bean casserole.  These seemed a little to sweet. But I just lessened the sugar amount a little. Perfect!  Most liked it better than the other green bean stuff!  Definitely will be making these more often!!

I made this for Easter and they were a hit.  My sister especially loved them.  I did cut down the sugar by half like others suggested and added more bacon.  Will be making these again.

Thank you for this recipe!  I needed to find a good green bean recipe that I could substitue either fresh or frozen green beans, as I will not buy canned vegetables.  I had a small group for Christmas dinner and tried to adjust the servings accordingly.  I ended up using fewer green beans and the same amount of sauce, but this dish turned out great!!  Everyone loved it!  Will definitely make it again.

Very good. I tried this with fresh green beans, then with frozen just cut the cooking time down. Worked well both ways.

Everyone ate their vegetables  and my vegetable hater had seconds. That says it all! I will make this again and again.  I cut this recipe in half. I used 2 cans of green beans, 4 pieces of bacon, 3 teaspoons soy sauce, 3 tablespoons butter,  1/4 cup brown sugar, 1 teaspoon garlic powder. I used a 9 by 11 glass pan. I followed the directions as written.  Wonderful!

I have made similar to this. One change I have done is buy a can long green beans not cut.  Take 10 beans and take bacon cut in half and wrap half on beans and hold with toothpick. Pour the rest of ingredients over it and follow directions. Great for potluck as they can pick it up with the toothpick and eat.

Usually, I make the traditional green bean casserole with the condensed soup and fried onions. I needed to find a gluten free recipe.  I subbed gluten-free tamari sauce for the soy sauce and used frozen green beans for the canned ones. It worked out well and will probably be part of our Thanksgiving meal this year.

Amazing! I've made this recipe dozens of times and everyone loves it each and every time. In fact, this is the one dish that I am always asked to bring for family functions. After sharing the recipe with my sister-in-law, she added raw chicken breasts in with the beans before baking and the results were wonderful. Thanks for the great recipe.

This recipe was awesome! My son's father said this was his new favorite meal (paired with a Aussie Chicken & VELVEETA® Down-Home Macaroni and Cheese, ~both recipes off this site). And he is somewhat hard to please at times, so to say his favorite, means a lot.  
I myself made no real crucial changes, other than frozen green beans and cooked bacon on stove since I already was for another recipe, and it was awesome!

This is really good as long as you don't add too much garlic powder and make sure there's enough brown sugar. Pretty comparable to Texas Roadhouse green beans.

After the first holiday dinner I brought this dish to, I was told that I couldn't attend another dinner without bringing the green beans with me.  There's never any left over.  I was a little leary with the soy sauce since I'm not a fan and I can't stand canned green beans but these are the best beans I've ever eaten.  I will continue to make from here on out!

This was delicious!  Rather than putting bacon strips on top, I used "real bacon pieces", and stirred all ingredients together before pouring into pan.  Wonderful!

Was looking for something a bit new to do with green beans. This did have a delicious flavor. I would recommend cutting the bacon into 4 parts before putting on top because it is not bite size once the dish is done. I will also look into thickening the sauce SLIGHTLY next time but the flavor was delicious.

I make these beans all the time my entire family loves them. As a matter of fact my family prefers these beans rather than the standard holiday green bean casserole.

These are very good and most loved them; however, two in the group found them to be too sweet.  I am keeping them at 5 stars because I thought they were fantastic.

One of my favorites for holidays and gatherings! I use fresh green beans rather than canned. I also mix the sauce with the bacon and beans before putting in the oven. Thank you KamiShay for sharing this recipe!

I cut the recipe way down for just 3 of us eating them, and these are absolutely divine. . . I didn't have bacon on hand, but did have Hormel Bacon pieces, added a handful, a dash on onion powder, and garlic powder. I couldn't get them in the oven fast enough as the husband was eating them out of the mixing bowl ! ! ! Definitely a keeper, and thanks for the recipe!

Awesome! My husband said you can make these again! I used the pre-cooked bacon which I didn't put in the microwave at all. I just tore the bacon slices in pieces and laid them on top of the beans. So good!

I made this dish for a 4th of July potluck yesterday after reading the reviews. It worked out alright for the potluck but we didn't think it rated 5 stars. It was tasty but not amazing. Not sure if I will make it again.

We didn't like these green beans much and I was disappointed. I think it was too much soy sauce for our tastes, so I may try to tweak it and make again. If you don't love soy sauce, this may not be for you.

I loved these green beans! My roommate doesn't like green beans, but thought the sauce had an excellent flavor so I'm going to also use this sauce with sauteed asparagus.

I make this at least three times a week. Although i use about one tablespoon on soy sauce and i add 1/4 cup honey. Also you can make them into an appetizer just roll bunches of green beans in bacon add toothpick and viola!! O i also soak in juices over night. it's delish!!

This is an unbelievable recipe.  I cook mainly healthy (California living) but my husband happens to love canned green beans.  I made just as directed and my family of 4 could have eaten twice as much.  Savory, sweet, smoky.  Great

It is not that this dish isn't delisious...because it is. Everyone ate it, but I cut the sugar in half and I still felt like I was on a sugar high after eating it.  It was way too sweet, and if you are going to be serving a vegetable dish during Thanksgiving when you have alot of other sweets on the table, it could be the thing that puts you right over the edge. I would choose a healthier dish to make than this.  But, if you just want a vegetable on your dinner table that your kids will eat, and there are not other sweet items competing, this is a great dish.

I wish I could give this more stars.  I was really looking forward to trying this.  I made it exactly as directed, and the soy sauce flavor was completely overwhelming!  I barely finished my portion due to the overpowering soy sauce flavor.  I think I may try it again and cut the soy sauce in half.

Pretty good. I used frozen haricort vert, brown sugar splenda and turkey bacon. I also used a little olive oil instead of the full amount of butter. I think adding onions to this would be good next time

We thought these were very good, but next time will put in half the sugar. All in all a very good dish.Oh, and I halved the recipe.

Hubby really liked these. Not as healthy as we normally prefer and a little bit too sweet, but may try substitutions next time.  Soy sauce was a fun addition, and we used fresh green beans and fresh garlic.

These green beans were off the charts. Excellent. I halved the recipe and followed directions. Afterwards, I hand chopped the bacon and enjoyed.

As written, the beans are a little sweeter than I prefer.  I made a second time with a little  less sugar and an extra can of beans and it was better.  Next time I will try low sodium soy sauce and Splenda brown sugar to see how that turns out.  They are certainly a pleasant change from ordinary ones.

This was very good and a pleasant change from the typical southern green beans I usually make.

I ate a similar recipe recently and knew that I didn’t want it quite as sweet, so I cut the sugar in half. My husband couldn’t get enough. He said it was his new favorite green beans.  My kids didn’t care for it.

My husband and I absolutely loved this! However, my mom and cousin did not care for them. For a shortcut, I sometimes cook this on stovetop. Note: if you do find it too sweet, be sure to cut the soy sauce down with the brown sugar.

This has become my families go to recipe. My daughter-in-law asks for it any time she comes over, which is weekly.  I just substituted worcestershire sauce instead of soy sauce. It gives it a little bit of a kick.  I also put it in a slow cooker so I don't have to think about it.  Love this recipe!

Very yummy!  I took advice from others here and cut the sugar by half and I steamed fresh snap green beans first, (18 mins for steamed) instead of canned. The family loved this side dish for Christmas dinner.

My family LOVES this recipe!!! I do have 3 recommendations. One is reduce the sugar!!! Two is mixing everything together so the beans are coated. Three cut the bacon into pieces and mix into the beans instead of laying on top. This way the bacon the bacon is stewing in the juices and that's when you get the yummy flavor.

Big hit every time I take it to a pot luck.  With one exception.  I drain the liquid and add cornstarch to thicken it then I pour it back iver the top.  S&P as you like.

This was a huge hit at my house this Thanksgiving!  The only change I made is that I added a diced onion to the bacon when I fried it, and I chopped up the bacon before it was fried.  It was super delicious and I will definitely make it again soon.

I made these for Thanksgiving this year and everyone raved.  We have one more gathering this weekend, & I plan to make them again.  Thank you for sharing our Southern Family Traditional green bean recipe

I used fresh green beans, fresh garlic, and did half of the brown sugar (possibly could have still used a little less) . Came out fantastic. I’m sure I’ll be making it again.

Per the suggestions in the reviews, I decreased the sugar by half each time I have made it. Always a hit! It would be 5 stars if I did not have to adjust the recipe.

This was awesome! I added fresh mushroom slices and next time I make it will garnish with toasted sesame seeds.  I also think I will put the beans in a bowl and toss with the sauce to get more even coating.  I just brushed the top of the bacon with a little sauce.  My wife was eating these off the cookie sheet as quickly as they cooled.  Delicious!

So, this was really yummy. That being said, I liked the look of the recipe (except for canned beans) but I am not in my own kitchen, so had to improvise. I sauteed fresh green beans, then melted the butter added honey instead of sugar, added the soy sauce and garlic powder, then poured that over the beans.  Added some left over turkey bacon that we had for lunch the day before. It is a great recipe that can be so easily adapted and still be delicious! Thanks

I thought I had the brown sugar in my pantry as I always do. I must have used it all during Christmas. So, I had just bought a bottle of maple syrup aged in bourbon barrels at Costco (I could drink the stuff it is so good). I substituted maple syrup for the brown sugar keeping in mind that many cooks suggested half the brown sugar in the recipe. It was delicious! AND, the family said I should make this again. It is a keeper!

We made this for Christmas dinner and it was a huge hit. We also cut back on the sugar. We also made it a day ahead and mixed it up. We left it in the fridge overnight and cooked it up at dinner time. Definitely marking this again.

I made this for Christmas dinner and my family loved it!  I used French cut and I cut up the bacon so that it was easier to serve.  The second batch I made, I accidentally left them in the oven about 25 minutes longer, and it resulted in a nice caramelizing of the sugar and crispier bacon.  I will probably leave them in longer from now on.  Everyone enjoyed it - this dish will be part of family celebrations from now on!

Excellent for more than just green beans. I'm not fan of bacon so I tried it again on snap peas and asparagus ( no bacon). Slightly blanched veggies and added to pan and drizzled sauce over and gave it 2 min on med heat. Crispy, yummy.

Good Stuff !! When making "fancy" green beans, I always just stuck to the cream soup and fried onion recipe. However....  I LOVED these!!  I will definitely make again.

This dish was a big hit at our Family Brunch. It was to first dish totally devoured by our guests.  Many of which had positive statements regarding the flavor. One suggested they may swap this recipe for the traditional green bean and mushrooms dish at Thanksgiving. Thank you for sharing .

I cut up the bacon and cooked it.  I then removed the cooked bacon and used the bacon grease to cook a bag of frozen green beans.  Added everything to that pan and heated up on the stove instead of baking.  Used half the amount of sugar and didn’t need the butter.  So so good!!!!!

This was a big hit with the kids.  Made it as described with the the following exceptions: 1) I used fresh green beans and not canned green beans; 2) I only used half the amount of brown sugar.  Everything else was the same.  Will definitely make this again.

My family loves this recipe for green beans.  I use maple flavored smoky bacon on top and it is absolutely heavenly.  The only tip I would add is to reduce the amount of time in the oven.  40 minutes is too long and will dry the beans out.  I usually put them in for 30 minutes and they are great!

Oh boy are these grean beans good.  Cut sugar in half and added shallots.  I used Liquid Amino instead of soy sauce. Fresh beans baked covered with foil.  A keeper for sure.

This recipe is a hit for our church socials.    When I make this recipe for my family,  I adjust the serving size to 2 servings( calls for 1 can of beans).    I love allrecipes for this little tweak!

This was good. I cut the bacon up and fried it. Then added onions and mushrooms and sautéed them. Used the whole amount of butter and cut the brown sugar way back. Added the green beans and other ingredients together and put in a ziplock bag overnight. Cooked in the oven as directed. Good flavor and a nice change to just plain green beans.

I used minced garlic instead of the garlic powder and I added onions that I sautéed in a small amount of butter. 
I prepared it the day before Thanksgiving and let the green beans marinate overnight, cooking them on Thanksgiving day. 
They were delish!!!

I would give this recipe 10 stars if I could! I make this exactly as written but I double the sauce because it is that good! Also I've added 2 tbsp of corn starch to thicken the sauce to help it stick onto the green beans better because it is just that good! Thank you so much for sharing this recipe!

I used the full amount of sugar but I did not pack it. I also recommend tossing the green beans in the sauce before cooking and serving so that it is evenly distributed. Personally I wasn't crazy about this recipe but my husband enjoyed it and it is a different taste which is nice every now and again.

This was so delicious.  I did make it on top of the stove with frozen green beans as the house was too warm to turn on the oven, and it turned out wonderful.   I also made the "Quinoa Side Dish" recipe from allrecipes.com and after tasting them I mixed the two together to make one marvelous tasting dish.

I was pleasantly surprised with this recipe.  I made it as instructed except I only used four cans of green beans and I cooked the bacon and diced it up before adding it to the green beans.  To me, it was slightly sweet (not overly) which balanced what I made it with.

Nearly ate the thing before it was done. I made a few changes, but the essentials  were still there. I fried my bacon in the oven til done, and then crumbled them. I made green beans in a pot, with a little bacon grease. I added one diced onion. Halved the sugar, more soy sauce. No butter. Simmer it for an hour or two. Everyone loved it. Ill definitely will make again!

Delicious , I used 3 cans of beans and halved the sauce and proportions were good, 5 cans would have made a lot. I also cooked the bacon in the oven do not care for microwave bacon and you can control it better.  Will definitely make again!

Very easy to make.  My family really enjoyed it.  It has a different taste from the "usual" green beans with bacon dish.  We're definitely adding it to the rotation.

They always say not to make a new recipe for a holiday but I love making my extended family be my guinea pigs. I made this for the first time on Thanksgiving 2015 and have made it numerous times since then. I was looking for a green bean recipe that was a compromise between beans cooked with sausage/bacon/potatoes and green bean casserole - trying to have a holiday dish that was different - and everyone loved this! It needs very little alteration. I did cut the brown sugar in half. Otherwise the only change I make is to cut the bacon into smaller pieces and to stir the sauce and coat all the beans instead of just pouring it on top. Fantastic! Even great for regular old tuesdays!

Chop bacon and crisp to desired doneness in oven-safe skillet. Drain off drippings except for 1 or 2 tsp. Add drained green beans to skillet, omit butter, add remainder of ingredients to skillet, toss until well mixed and bake until piping hot.

I made this with only 3 cans and it still had enough for me, my husband, and 2 of my kids to have seconds, plus leftovers. I cut the sugar down to only 1/4 cup and it was still a bit too sweet for us so will do a little less next time. Cut the soy sauce down to 3 1/2 tsp and garlic to 1 tsp since we used less beans than it called for. Used 6 slices of bacon but cooked on the stove until crispy, crumbled them, and mixed them in with the beans instead of on top. And I mixed the sauce in with the beans as well. Except for it being a bit sweeter than I like, it came out really good and everyone went for seconds. Will make again.

Have made this dish twice.  My family loves it!  The second time I used fresh green beans.  I didn't have much time so I stuck the prepared dish in the microwave for 15-20 minutes and then finished it in the oven.  It was even better than the first time.  The bacon was crispy and the dish had even better flavor.  This is one that can't go wrong!

Made this tonight and it was delicious!! Definitely cut the sugar by half or more because the taste of the brown sugar will over power. I followed what another reviewer did in frying the bacon and adding butter to the drippings. Definitely a keeper!!

Delicious! I used two small bags of frozen green beans, fresh garlic and coconut aminos instead of soy sauce. I left out all of the sugar because we are on a low carb diet. I also added in some  onion powder and mixed everything real well before adding the bacon. It was delicious and we all loved it. I served it with a baked chicken.

The BF and I do like this recipe but next time I will cut back on the brown sugar, just a personal preference.  But a great change to the boring old green beans. Always looking for something new. Will make again.  Thanks for sharing.

SO GOOD !! i cut the recipe in half less brown sugar also it was perfect that way, and I added chopped red onions also. P.s. less time in oven also just enough for the onions to cook about 20-30 mins.
2cans of green beans half of a onion bacon bits two handfuls and 3 teaspoons of soy sauce and 3 table spoons of brown sugar i sprinkled it on top of everything after I stirred it first, salt and garlic powder with one clove minced up also. yummy!!

I tried with fresh green beans. after 40 minutes they were still not done. I believe they would have been exceptional if I had just used canned green beans like the recipe. I did cut up my bacon into bite sized pieces. Fantastic taste!!

I did not bake it but cooked the ingredients in a pot. I let the ingredients simmer before adding the green beans cooked. turned out fairly well.

I used fresh green beans that come pre-washed in a bag for steaming and I used half the brown sugar as everyone recommends. It was great and everyone loved the sauce. My daughter even ate a few green beans which is unheard of!

This is more like 4.5 stars.  I did cut the recipe in half for my family.  I cut the brown sugar just a bit like many wrote they had  done.  I used 8 pieces of bacon and fried it on stove like I normally would.  Nice twist on green beans.  Thank you

I halved the recipe using 2 cans of green beans, 3 slices of bacon and so forth.  As alot of others have said.....way too sweet.  Next time, I'll use about half of the amount of sugar called for. I stirred the beans into the sauce then poured them into the baking dish so that the sauce was evenly distributed then scattered the bacon on top.   I covered the dish with foil and baked about 30 minutes.  I think that without covering it, the beans would have been dry.  I will be making this again because it is easy and is good overall.....just less sugar.  Will also try with fresh green beans.

I cooked the bacon in a pan (about halfway done) instead of microwave.  Then I used a couple of tbsp. of the bacon grease in the place of butter.  I mix everything together and let them sit in the fridge for a few hours before baking.  My family really likes this recipe.

Delicious, easy recipe. I used fresh pole beans and minced garlic. I reduced the brown sugar to one tablespoon because we don't like anything that sweet. I followed another users advice and put a cover on the fresh beans so they could steam.

Wow! My six year old and the pickiest eater of a three year old absolutely devoured these green beans. I made with a bag of fresh green beans from the produce department. I cut the sugar in half. I added fresh garlic. Then the bacon cooked on the stove top and cut into quarters. I mixed all of the ingredients together into the baking dish and Voila! Spectacular side dish that I will make again and again. Yum.

Too sweet for our taste. I'm sure some people would like the overly sweet taste. I added a couple tablespoons of cider vinegar and two additional tablespoons of butter. Taste was amazing. I would make these green beans again with that small adjustment.

a big hit.  I crumbled up the bacon afterwards before serving, and it was VERY well received.  First time I've seen both my boyfriend and his son eat all the of the vegetables before starting on the main dish!

This is a great potluck recipe that can be modified easily. I used one of those bulk-sized cans of green beans, drained it, and put in a large bowl. For the bacon, I cut 7 slices into 1-inch pieces and sauteed them with 1/2 of a chopped onion until they were both partially cooked. I mixed the other ingredients together, using only 6 teaspoons of light soy sauce, and then stirred them into the green beans with the onion and bacon to coat all of it before I poured it all into a 11x15 baking pan. They cooked just 30 minutes, and really could have cooked less. They were delicious and made a LOT. Yes, they are soft, and yes, they are sweet. They're canned green beans with brown sugar in them, so that's not surprising. Even though I used more green beans than the recipe called for, I didn't increase the sauce and it ended up tasting just right. Thanks for a great recipe  - and as an Arkansan, I love the name of it!

These are good. I used frozen beans and cooked them on the stove first. So once I put them in the oven with the other ingredients, I didn't leave them in for 40 minutes. Since canned beans are already soft, I would recommend not leaving them in the oven that long either.

I loved this. I had three out of ten that didn't like the crispness of the green beans. I also didn't have garlic powder so I traded it out for garlic salt. I like salt on my vegetables so this worked out fine. It definitely adds flavor to them. Great recipe and not to time consuming or hard to do.

I now use this recipe for my thanksgiving dinner. I also use fresh green beans that I par boil first. I also add about 1/4 cup of dried cranberries which makes it more "Thanksgiving-ish". Delicious!!!

This was a hit at our Thanksgiving feast--even with my 3 year old who won't eat greenbeans!  My only change to the recipe was I omitted bacon--my husband doesn't eat pork. (That is a love sacrifice right there!)  I imagine it would be amazing with the bacon, but even without it is fantastic. A definite keeper!

My family loves this recipe.  I take it to potlucks and it always goes over well.  Make use you use canned green beans with salt.  It levels out the Brown Sugar well.  I also cut the bason in one inch pieces.  Much easier to serve this way.  Make sure you mix the sauce well.

Quadrupled this dish for a large party.  Everyone raved. Not one bite left.  The only change I made was to chop up the bacon and sprinkle it over the top of the beans.

Have made this recipe many times. Family requests for birthdays and holidays. If you are a person who likes there beans on crisp side this is not for you. Have used canned as recipe states and also my homemade canned. Family loves both.

This was amazing. It got my 12 year old to eat two helpings of green beans which is unheard of for him to eat even one! I liked them tho they are a bit too sweet as written. I made no changes to the recipe.

I loved the taste of the sauce.  The sweetness mixed with the bacon really is a nice combination.  Since it's sweet, needless to say the kids loved it.  It's definitely a keeper.

My boyfriend and I really enjoyed this recipe...
First I did the recipe as is - which was fantastic tasting. I do prefer fresh green beans over the canned though. My boyfriend loves Asparagus, so he requested that I add that as a variation.
Second time around, I did 2lbs of fresh green beans and 1lb of fresh Asparagus. When doing the sauce, I kept everything the same (except I did not realize I had no brown sugar - so I substituted regular sugar with molasses.)

Made this at Christmas, and was the favorite of most guests. This marinade would be great with meat, and other veggies. I imagine we will be using it for kabobs in the summer. Like others suggested, I used only 1/2 cup of brown sugar. I thought it could be less, but my guests like the sweetness. I steamed green beans in advance, and cooked the bacon in advance in a pan. We had ran out of soy sauce, but had packets from past Chinese take out. Seven packets later, I had a great marinade to pour over the green beans. Will definitely make again, but maybe experiment with the proportion of brown sugar. Thanks for the recipe!

These were awesome. My daughter-in-law has never said anything, about what I have made, till now. I was surprised, when she told me they were really good. I have made them 3 times, in the last month. My hubby asks for them now. The last time, I added ham, instead of bacon. Still great.

This is a great dish.  The only think I would suggest, if you don't like the "sweet" taste is to cut the brown sugar in half.

These have become a go-to recipe for Holiday meals for me. I gave my cousin this recipe for this past thanksgiving since she was cooking this year, and everyone was raving about it and asking for the recipe. The first time I made it, I made the mistake of using fresh beans but forgot to adjust the time, and we ended up with undercooked beans at dinner. I definitely recommend using canned beans, I think they have been the best for this. Also, I recommend tearing the bacon up into bite-size pieces before putting on the beans. The whole pieces I used the first time were hard to eat.  Also, I tend to prefer savory foods, but I don't find the sweetness of this recipe overpowering at all, it is perfect as is!!

Wonderful side dish (: I read the other reviewers suggestions and cut down the sugar to much less. Other than that I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out SO tasty!

It was really good still though, definitely going to be making this again!

I made these green beans last night along with Fondant Potatoes and Country Style Steak, all from this site. Let me say the were DELICIOUS. I didn't have, nor do we like soy sauce so I used a little bit of chicken broth in them. Very good KamiShay, thanks for sharing!

This turned out so great!!! I've cooked it on several occasions. The first time I followed the recipe to the T and it turned out great. My guests were licking thier plates from it. The second time I tried it, I cooked them in a pot on the stovetop for 15 mins. Turned out just as great as the first time. The recipe is very quick and simple. Cooking it on the stovetop is the way to go for me. It's a requested food very often for my household and parties.

Good, not great. I used canned beans. Next time, I will use either frozen or fresh. I also microwaved the bacon for two minutes before adding it to the dish to minimize the grease. Perhaps I will make this again.

upped the brown sugar to a full cup because my hubby likes it a little sweeter and I used frozen green beans.  Even my picky daughter loves these.  I have also made it with ham hocks and it turns out just as well.  Definitely my go-to green bean recipe!

Thanks to the other reviewers I only used half the sugar. I made a smaller serving portion of these beans, and it was the first time I had ever made anything other than plain Green Beans, or Green Beans with potatoes. I've made them twice now. And I loved it! 

I wasn't the only one, my mother asked for 2nds both times I've made them. Only one who didn't was the 8yr old. I also took the hint and mixed the beans into the sauce instead of just pouring it over the beans. I also took the bacon slices and cut them into pieces, mixing them into the beans as well. I have baked them @ 325 uncovered and they were fine, and I also baked them at 350, but covered for about the first 15-20min. Mine have all came out done in 30min and delicious!

Very good recipe.  The mix of the brown sugar, bacon, and soy sauce adds nice savory sweetness to the beans.  What a wonderful side dish with a roasted pork loin.  Definitely a change from the norm and a very good change at that. Yum.

This is now the ONLY green bean recipe I make for company.  Thank goodness I can get rid of the nasty casserole with onions on top.  Everyone loves this.  It's so versatile.  I have made exactly as is, or used frozen or fresh beans.  I have substituted olive oil for butter for a person allergic to dairy.  I have used hormel bacon crumbles.  Every time it is a crowd pleaser.  I usually use a 16 oz bag of frozen green beans, keep sauce as is and half the bacon.

Oh my YUM!! I made this with fresh string beans. I cooked off the bacon dumped most of the fat, then took my onions and sauteed them with the remains of the grease. I used half the amount of sugar. I took someones advice and mixed the beans with the sauce. Half way through I fliped the beans around so there was more of an even flavor. Also with the fresh beans it took longer in cook time about 60 mins with foil!! Thanks for the great treat!! Oh and may I add that  my 3 and 5 yr old LOVED THEM!!!

Fanastic but I didn't have any bacon so I used leftover ham.  Still really good. My only problem was using fresh green beans.  I covered them with foil like another person suggested and cooked for 40 minutes in the oven.  They were still raw.  I had to microwave them to finish cooking.

Wow!  Made this instead of green bean casserole on Thanksgiving.  Really easy to make and really good.  My only change was that I used the Splenda/brown sugar.  Will use this recipe over and over.

Simply amazing.  Used fresh, steamed, beans.  I also used the amounts given.  The sweet from the brown sugar completely balances the salt from the soy sauce.  It was perfect.  Thanks so much.

I add extra bacon because everyone loves it and there never seems to be enough. Plus I always make at least 3 to 4 extra servings so that we can have second helping which tend to happen every time.

Loved, loved, loved these!!  I used fresh green beans, cooked them for about 20 minutes before making the recipe.  I will probably take suggestions from others also and cut down a little on the brown sugar and use fresh garlic.  WONDERFUL recipe for a twist on the delicious green bean!

This was beyond awesome!! I am not a fan of canned green beans but my son and husband love them. So that's why I tried this. This is a huge hit in my home. If I go to a party, I am requested to make these. TRY 'EM YOU'LL LOVE 'EM!!!

A little less brown sugar, a little less soy sauce, and only three cans cooked on the stove top for a ten to fifteen minute simmer. Tasty!

Wow!!!  My husband loved these.  He kept saying "these are amazing".  The only thing that I changed was I reduced the sugar.  They were still really sweet and tasty.  We will have these again.

I only used 3 cans of green beans...  Used splenda brown sugar blend and added 1/4 t of red pepper, 1/2 t of black pepper and threw in a handfull of almonds...  I also cooked it on the stove because my oven was busy with fish!  SOOOO GOOD!!!!

This is really yummy. My 2 yr.old loves my green beans but he wouldn't eat these. I was suprised being they are sweet. Guess he just prefers my garlic butter family green beans. These are yummy tho and really good for something different. And I too could drink this sauce...LOL Oh yeah,my husband was saying this sauce would be awesome on pork chops. When we try it I will post and let you know how it is.

These were excellent, though I did a few modifications. I only used 2 T. of raw, organic honey, 1 T. brown sugar, 6 T. of tamari sauce, and sauteed a couple of real garlic cloves and a little onion. Also used turkey bacon and fresh green beans instead. They were fantastic. I think if you used all of the brown sugar they would be WAY too sweet. Thanks!!

Cooked this for a dinner party and it was a big hit.  I did half the sugar and tear the bacon into pieces rather than laying the strips of bacon across the beans.

I had 10 guests over on the weekend and they all loved this recipe. I too reduced the brown sugar to 1/4 cup & let the beans soak for about 1 hour before baking.

This has been a hit wherever I've taken it. I really cut down on the sugar..maybe even half as much. I diced the bacon then cooked it in the micro. I cooked it as a holiday dish using 5 cans of green beans and increased the rest accordingly. Thanks for the recipe.

Fabulous! I cut the recipe in half and cooked in an 8x8 and there were no leftovers! Super easy and so good. I didn't cut back on the sugar like some suggested and I thought it was yummy.

I was craving green beans and came across this recipe. I had to make adjustments in the ingredient amounts since I was only making it for me and my boyfriend.  I used one box of frozen french cut green beans (thawed and drained), 1 heaping Tbsp brown sugar, 2 Tbsp butter and about 2 tsp soy sauce and garlic powder to taste. I used turkey bacon, cooked it on the stove top and broke it into pieces before addding it to the beans, poured the sauce over the whole mixture and baked for about 20 - 25 minutes. My boyfriend loved it and it was even better leftover after it sat for a couple days. Next time I'll make two boxes!

A wonderful vegetable dish. We have served this several times since we first served it at Thanksgiving. Don't use fresh beans, the canned are better.

These beans were delicious! I am so happy to find a new way to make green beans. these may even hve to replace the sme old onion/mushroom soup recipe for the holidays. All I did was use canned cut green beans and they were easy to make with a very savory flavor and not too sweet. This is definitely going into my recipe box. It's a keeper!!

This one is the keeper for our family.  We have been looking for a green bean holiday recipe for years.  Next time I will pull out the bacon and crisp it up and crumble it in the beans and I might add some french fried onions.  The recipe is a 5 star as it is though.  Thanks!

Wow what an amazing dish!!! The only change I made to this wonderful recipe is that I used frozen green beans and not canned. The first night I made this for supper, I made it in a 13X9 baking dish, there were NO leftovers...SO, I ended up making this again a few days later :)  My four year old who's not a big fan of veggies LOVED IT...my husband too. This is definatley a keeper for my family. If you want a nice dish EVERYONE will love, make this!!!! Planning on taking this to our Thanksgiving this year and looking forward to sharing this great dish with the rest of my family. I'm sure it will be a big hit!!! Thanks for sharing this recipe!

I cut the sugar by half and it was still almost too sweet. Good though, but I put less bacon and used fresh beans instead. Makes a lot so be prepared to eat for a few days (or have 5 people come to your table at least).

I made these for a church potluck supper and everybody loved it! I didn't change the recipe at all, but I did cut the bacon into one inch pieces before frying it up in a pan. I will definitely be making this again! Thanks!
