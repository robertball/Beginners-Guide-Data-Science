Excellent drink, a must for any special occasion. Many people like poinsettias better than mimosas but it all depends on taste. For a poinsettia, replace the OJ with cranberry juice! Also you should ALWAYS put a half ounce of triple sec into your Mimosas and Poinsettias, you'll see the difference.

Drink was good as-is but like everybody on this site does, I tweaked the recipe a little.  Instead of champagne I used whisky and instead of OJ I tried ice.  Perfecto!!!

I found it to be a little to dry for my taste so I added more orange juice.  Guests at my brunch loved it.

This is the first time I ever made mimosas. They tasted great and this is something very simple to make. I asked the Recipe Buzz on recommendations of champange to buy since I had no idea. Most people recommended a Brut champange so that is what I used.

I liked this a whole lot, but I definitely like my mimosas to have just a little more juice. Next time I'll do 2 parts bubbly to 1 part juice.

I drank a glass of this on Christmas morning, as it only has 2 Tablespoons of wine per glass. I talked to some people on the recipe buzz about the best "sparkling wine" to use. I found that the mid priced ones worked the best. I got a bottle of Moscato D'asti, for about $11 at a whole sale club. It is a regular sweeter white wine I like anyway. It is slightly sparkling, unlike French champagne. And, it is much sweeter than the lower priced dry sparkling wines. I also used a favorite oj without the pulp. The proportions are perfect in this recipe, just follow it exactly.

My favorite festive beverage.  Would not be Christmas without them.  So refreshing and light.  We always make the kids' with lemon-lime soda instead of the champagne, in the fancy glasses, so they can toast too!

Neither Hubs nor I are champagne drinkers, but I occasionally will buy a bottle when it's called for in a savory sauce for an entree, which is why I had some leftover.  It was put to good use for our breakfast this morning with these Mimosas.  Light, refreshing and pretty, served in pretty champagne flutes and garnished with mint.  Not something we'll have routinely, but it was a nice treat for a more elegant breakfast/brunch.

Didn't like it.  Champagne tastes bad and mixing it with Orange Juice makes the O.J. taste bad also.

This recipe was just what the doctor ordered. Instead of white wine, I chose a strawberry flavored wine, which gave it something extra. Worked wonderfully!

I definitely enjoy making this drink. A non-alcoholic version would be to substituting sparkling white grape juice for the champagne.

Classic mimosa.  Most guests asked for theirs 1/2 and 1/2.  I used white zin champagne because I prefer it.  Served with Mother's Day brunch.  Was well enjoyed.

For the first time ever, we had this wonderful drink at our Thanksgiving breakfast, along with Eggs Benedict.  What a fine way to celebrate a holiday, the beginning of a relationshipship or the end of one...or any other reason.

A perfect ratio between the champagne and the orange juice.  I also made a non-alcoholic version for my kids using ginger ale and orange juice, which was just as delicious!

Very refreshing.  I always garnish with a orange a toothpick that has an orange wedged and strawberry for a special touch since I usually serve at special occasions. Also for the kids you can sub the Champagne with sparkling apple juice.  This is much healthier than soda and they will feel special too.

Mimosa are usually 1/2 Champagne, 1/2 OJ and a Splash of triple Sec to soften the OJ.  Serve with or without ice.  But all are good !

nice. i used sparkling apple juice because i didnt think the real champagne was worth it. the reason i say 4 stars is cause the apple juice was kind of bubbly and had one taste and the orange juice had a sour kind of taste and first it was apple then BOOM! it was orange.

When my younger brother stayed with me one summer, we had these often after dinner on my porch while he played his guitar. For me, mimosas bring back nice laid-back summer memories.

Try this: Reverse the ratios with more juice and less alcohol... and then substitute POG juice for straight orange. Breakfast will never be the same!

The only change I made was using Barefoot pink champagne . I did try the poinsettia one but I think I'll stick to the traditional recipe.

Truly a good alcohol to juice ratio. Tastes refreshing and not too strong. Will experiment with different juices in the future just for fun.

I've never done more than equal parts of  sparkling wine and OJ , except to add pineapple juice to soften the tartness sometimes. I'm not much of an alcoholic beverage drinker, and this is how I use up the champagne and proseco that I accumulate as holiday gifts and party leftovers. I serve it for brunch or luncheon get togethers. Mix your own --- go straight juice or wine (kept in ice bucket). Now the mixers can add a dash of triple sec to taste. What fun!

Make sure and use a champagne that you enjoy. The first time I tried this using brut  champagne  as suggested here and I didn't like it. Much better with pinot  grigio  champagne ,  my favorite.

I love Mimosa! This is the perfect proportion of champagne to orange juice. I saw someone had made this recently, and I asked my hubby to PLEASE bring home a bottle of champagne! :)

A mimosa for Brunch hits the spot. I did use 1/2 orange juice and 1/2 champagne. I garnished the mimosas with blueberries and clementine oranges. Some of my guests wanted ice. So, have ice on hand.

Traditional mimosa.  I made a few "additions" and modifications due to personal taste: 

I made it in a punch bowl due to the amount of people serving, so be careful to watch the measurements when using the All Recipes serving totals.

We have a diabetic in our family so I made a separate batch for him that included a low sugar orange juice and mixed in a minute maid diet mango drink.

For the adults I added in the left over cranberry juice and pineapple juice I had from the cranberry whip recipe I made.

For the children I made a separate version (with the cranberry/pineapple juices) but used a carbonated grape juice for the champagne.

All were delicious!!!

Perfect for Easter or Christmas brunch.  It's also really good with guava juice instead of the OJ.
