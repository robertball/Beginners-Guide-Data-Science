Deeee-licious!  I am drooling thinking about eating another one.  The only thing I changed was I used 1/2 tsp of salt...a full teaspoon seemed like just a bit too much.  The cookies are wonderful.  For those who had trouble...don't forget to only use eggs and butter at room temp.  It makes a big difference!  Don't use dark cookies sheets...they'll burn.  The use of more brown sugar than white sugar keeps these nice and chewy for days!  Thanks for the recipe!

These were great! When I bake cookies like this though, I bake at 325 for about 10-12 mins, depending on the size. They are chewier that way, so I suggest this method only if chewy is what you like.

Recipe a 5...Some recommendations, 350 to avoid burning (375 they will begin to burn after 7 min), 1/2 tsp. salt (too salty w/ 1tsp.) and 1/2 cup chopped walnuts or other are a nice addition. 
The difference in this recipe has to be the ind. beating of each egg and vanilla - that's the key.

this was a great recipe, made even better by...banana! I didn't have quite enough butter, so I put in a stick and a tablespoon that I had, and substituted half a medium banana for the rest. it is amazing! just subtle enough to add sweetness and a real melt-in-your-mouth quality. cream it with the butter and sugar, and you might need to cook it a little longer. dough is fluffier. great!

We loved these cookies so much... Now I must say that when I started making these cookies I thought I had a full bag of chocolate chips, well I didnt...LOL..So this is what I did... I used 1/2 cup chocolate chips,1/2 cup white chocolate chips, 1 cup oatmeal, 1/2 walnuts, and also threw in 1 (medium sized) mashed banana that needed to be used... They turned out so delicious!!. I have since made the recipe with the 2 cups of chocolate chips and they are great... This is the recipe that I always use now...

I have to admit, I am not a cookie baker.  I haven't tasted a good homemade chocolate cookie, EVER...until last night, when I made this recipe.  The cookies are filled with chocolate chips, they are gooey and chewy.  My husband loved them, he even took some to work to share.  These are delicious!!

I have sort of a love/hate feeling about these. On the up side, there's a lot of butter in these cookies and the taste really comes through - they're buttery rich and delicious, and there's kind of a sweet/salty thing going on that really is good. On the flip side, however, there's a lot of butter in these cookies - which makes them not as thick as I prefer, and a little on the greasy side.  I did add 1/2 tsp. of baking powder in addition to the baking soda to give them a little more lift and, as I always do with cookie doughs made with butter, I chilled the dough for about an hour.  Still, they spread quite a bit while baking and a flat, spread-out cookie is not very attractive to me.   This would be a five star cookie if I was eating them blindfolded!

Easy to make. Not too sugary at all. A big hit even with folks who supposedly don't like cakes, cookies, etc. Well, they love these. Use 1/2 the salt. Find them a bit too salty with the full amount.Use all the sugar and chocolate. Everyone comments on the rich chocolate taste- without being too sweet! Baked them in a convection oven for 8-9 mins. at 180 C. Turned out perfectly. Thank you for the recipe!

These are some of the best cookies I've had, however, I made some improvements to make them even better!  

Buy 1 bag of mixed peanut butter and chocolate chips and 1 bag of straight semi sweet chocolate chips. Use the full bag of mixed chips and about half of the bag of chocolate chips. 

When you put the dough on the cookie sheet, make the BIG. (about double of a "normal" cookie). Bake them for 10 minutes. Take them out and squish the tops down with a spatula. Now, put them back in the oven for 2 - 3 more minutes. 

This will keep your cookies soft for days. My family loves these cookies and so do I.

I just made these cookies expecting them to be, like the reviews say, beautiful and puffy and delicious. Unfortunately, all I got were flat discs that were burned on the outside and gooey on the inside. I was supposed to bring these to a party, so I had to use another recipe. I used the Nestle's Tollhouse recipe on the back of the bag, and those cookies came out beautifully. I would NOT recommend this recipe to anyone.

WOW! These were great cookies! I used butter flavored shortning instead of butter. I also made my drops larger than a TBS. These were the cookies I have been looking for. They were big,thick,soft,chewy, and just perfect. I baked mine on a pampered chef bar pan (I highly recomend). 8 1/2 minutes to chocolate goodness!
Thanks,
Steph

These cookies are good but a little more crisp than I would prefer.  I tried decreasing the cooking time and while it did improve the texture, they still weren't where I'd like them to be.  A good recipe but not the absolute best.

This recipe was good, but honestly it did not taste much different than the traditional recipe on the chocolate chip bag from Toll House.  I doubt I would go through the effort of coming back to this recipe when I could just use the one on the bag.  Average.

These were great! Initially, when I had some fresh from the oven, I thought they were too cake-like at first. But I let them cool for a few minutes, and then I couldn't stop eating them! Great cookies!

I have tried over 75 chocolate chip cookie recipes. If you are looking for a cake-like cookie, this one is very good. Here are some basic cooking tips to help with this recipe: stir in the dry ingredients by hand -- never use a mixer when a recipe says stir! The dough is very stiff on purpose - that's what produces the cake-like consistency in the end. The dough shouldn't spread out like other cookies - again that's what gives these their cake-like quality. The salt is perfect in balancing the sweetness of the chocolate (which may be too much chocolate if you aren't eating these solely for their chocolate). They stay soft and moist very well. Keeping the dough in the refrigerator between batches makes scooping with a mini ice cream scoop or melon baller easier. Enjoy!

These are awesome!  But the dough is much thinner than other CCC recipes.  I almost added more flour but decided not to and I'm glad I didn't.  They are moist and chewy!  The thinner batter makes for a thin cookie, but if you refregerate the dough for a couple of hours, the cookies come out a little less flat.  I followed the advice of some others and used 1/2 tsp of salt since I was already using salted butter.  Thanks for the recipe!

These taste great! I love salty, so I thought the amount of salt was perfect, but I understand when people say it was too much, so be aware of that. The texture is gooey and rich and they melt in your mouth.

The thing is, they are very flat. I even added 1/2 t. extra baking soda hoping that would raise them a bit, but they still came out very thin. Visually, they are quite unattractive. That brought the score down a whole two stars for me because looks are important when it comes to baking, especially for others!

So basically, this is one of those cases in cooking where it's not pretty, but it still tastes awesome!

These cookies had a somewhat cake-like texture with a flavor of a tollhouse. My family prefers a crispy outer shell with a chewy inner texture. These weren't for us, but others may find them delicious.Thanks Stacey.

Such a delightfull cookie!! Very soft and 'cakelike'.  Becareful not to over cook. I recomend that you don't add the full 2 cups (try 1 or 1 and a 1/2) of chocolate chips...its a bit much! And don't make them too thick, the inside wont cook so well.

Perfect, my new standard choc. chip cookie recipe!!  Easy, delicious, and ingredients that you'll always have on hand.  They were devoured in less than a day.  I used semi sweet, but agree w/ others who said milk choc & pb chips are a good combo to try too!  I disagree w/ the "tollhouse" references to this cookie- I've always found those to be greasy, and this was the perfect texture- moist & chewy!

I consider myself to be a good cook, but I have never been able to make really great chocolate chip cookies.  This recipe is EXCELLENT, easy, and impossible to mess up!  I used bittersweet chocolate chips to counter the very sweet batter, and it was perfect.  Thank you Stacey for helping me keep my reputation!

This was a horrible recipe. The cookies were so cakey and didn't taste good too. In the end, I have to discard all the cookies. Luckily I half the recipe or else I will wasted more ingredient.

This was a horrid tasting cookie.  They flattened out to "see-through" thin wafers that were "deep-fried" crispy on the edges and non-stop chewy in the middle.  I feel like I am in the twilight zone with all these rave reviews saying how wonderful and soft and flavorful they are.  I won't be trying these again.

I think these are the best on the site.  They are a little less sweet than most and that is what my family prefers.  Nice tender crispiness with soft centers.  I always add a few extra chips on top for the look and the flavor.

I have made the twice in the past 1 1/2 weeks! My nephews were here while I baked the first batch and they disappeared. They are even better the next day if that's possible. I did as another review said and took the temp to 325 for 11 to 12 minutes on some parchment paper. Let the cookies sit on the pan for about 2 mins and perfection.

These are the best batch of chocolate chip cookies my daughter and I have ever made!! it was soo good. I was looking for a great chewy chocolate chip cookie recipe and I found it! I however baked about a dozen cookies the same day and regrigerated the rest over night. It made such a difference! The cookies tasted even better and chewier!

These cookies are great. They turned out very soft and fluffy. For those who say the cookies were flat you should make sure the pan isn't hot before you put the cookies on it or they spread out too much. Next time I make them I will use a little less sugar. Very good recipe. Thanks!!:)

We made this recipe along with the award winning Debbi s recipe 722+ reviews. Side by side everyone we asked prefered Debbi's tasted better softer. Both were equally easy to make.I will never make this recipe again I think you could take any recipe off the chocolate chip bag and it would turn out as good. The Debbi Award winning recipe was well like and will  use again until I find a better one. I have a bosch mixer so I Bake ALOT so I know what I'm talking about. If you are new to baking this recipe may be better than what you have used before.

My search has finally ended. My family and I just loved this delightful cookie. I made sure to use room temperature ingredients and the cookies turned out just as described...soft, chewy & yummy. I might try adding cocoa powder to this some time for a chocolate variation. Enjoy!

I have never gotten so many compliments on my cookies!  These were a huge hit.  I saw some of the reviews saying that the cookies came out too crispy, so I made my cookies a little bigger, which seemed to help.  I made one minor change to the recipe by adding 1/4 tsp almond extract.  Great recipe -- will certainly make again.

These cookies are so tasty! The first batch I burned, you really only need to leave them in for 8 mins. Once I got that right, they were delicious, soft and chewy....its a definite keeper!

This is an excellent chocolate chip cookie recipe!!!!!  We substitute milk chocolate chips for the semi-sweet chips and they become completely irresistible.

I guess the choosing the 'ultimate' cookie really depends on personal taste. I did not like these as much as the other reviewers; they were way too 'cakey' for my tastes, almost like sponge cake with chocolate chips! They won't be wasted but I wont spend the money on the ingredients again; butter and chocolate is never cheap!

Better since my last review 2 years ago.  This is my second review. I tweaked recipe. Cookies are dry, add just 1/4 whole milk or evaporated milk. I purchase Bakers chocolate and chop up the chocolate. I use some time all brown sugar, the brown sugar seems to make it softer. The temp for your oven should range 320-325 8-10 minutes(time is very important) anything higher higher will make your cookies hard. 

These are delicious with the chocolate chunks. I have tree nut allergies I had to change from the chocolate chips, and use the Bakers chocolate bar.

I followed the recipe exact, only using organic eggs. I made these for my husband and kids and did not try them myself but they all liked them only my husband did say they were a bit salty. I should have went with my gut and cut the salt back to a half teaspoon. I did chill the dough for most of the morning and went to bake them and they spread all over the cookie sheet and darn near burned, even when I reduced the temp. I had to warm it a bit, then add another half cup or so of flour to get it to a firmer consistancy. That was a total buzzkill.  NOTE: When I first baked these chocolate chip cookies, I automatically baked them at 350*, after reading a few reviews that suggested that. Even turning it down to 325* was just too hot and they baked too quickly and burned. Once I added flour, it was a lot better. 350* for nine minutes was fine. These are a darker chocolate chip cookie that turn out kind of cakey. Because I had to play with it, I wouldn't make these again.

These were good. I think letting dough sit in the refrigerator for 2 days made them alot better. Good recipe, I will try again.

Yes, this recipe has been heavily reviewed, but I've made many a chocolate chip cookie and this is the best one I've found so far.  It's a wonderful recipe to add things to, based on your personal tastes.  Works well to add walnuts or split up the chips between milk chocolate and white, but I've had rather poor results with raisins.  

I've made this into giant hand-sized cookies, and they're fantastic.  I also undercook for a couple minutes, but when I cook it for my father (who prefers crispness) I run it for about 12 minutes and he adores it.

My boyfriend's roommate used to ask him, every time he came home, if I had given him extra cookies.

These are the best chocolate chip cookies that I have ever made! I overbaked the second dozen and they were just a little hard, but that was my fault. The rest were perfect! They tasted wonderful and they were soft and chewy. The only change that I made was that I only used two cups of flour. Thanks Stacey for this recipe! I am going to bake a few dozen and take them to my youth group! 
(Note: If any cookies that you bake turn out hard put a piece of bread into the container that you store them in. It will make them softer.)

This is an outstandly recipe for Chocolate Chip Cookies.  Out of all the Chocolate Chip recipes, this was the best in texture, chunkyness, thickness, gooeyness, and was just perfect.  We've made quite a few batches with this recipe and each batch has turned out wonderful.

I seem to be the odd one out here, but I didn't think these were anything special.  It's pretty standard fare and I thought they were a little bit flour-y.  Might have just been me though! They'll get eaten but I won't make them again...

Based on reviews, I was dissapointed after I made this cookie recipe.  I expected it to be a very basic chocolate chip cookie...soft, chewy and gooey. I followed the recipe exactly, but my cookies were cake-like mounds and kind of bland.  My kids are eating them, so I won't say that they are bad, just not a chocolate chip recipe that I will make again due to preference.

I thought that these were delicious cookies.  I have tried the Tollhouse recipe and one from Williams Sonoma, and I thought that Anna's cookies blew the competition away.  I couldn't stop eating them.  I will definitely be making these again.

I was adding ingredients when I looked on the side of the baking soda box and saw almost the exact same recipe!  These cookies came out too cakey, probably from so much flour. I mixed together white chocolate chips and regular chocolate chips with peanut butter chips and pecans, then measured out 2 cups of the mixture, instead of just 2 cups of chocolate chips.  My boyfriend thought they wee great, but from now on I'll just stick with recipe on the side of the baking soda box.  Maybe those won't be so cakey and dry.

I didn't think the recipe was very different from "Toll House" in taste (except I do prefer the taste of brown sugar to white sugar) but they didn't spread as much as "Toll House."  I agree with the previous reveiw that the salt could be cut.  I used milk chocolate chips and added a cup of coconut but the salt taste overpowered the more delicate coconut flavor.  This recipe is definitely replacing the current chocolate chip cookie recipe in my recipe box!

Probably one of the best chocolate cookies I have ever made or tasted.  Kids had friends over and they couldn't get enough.  Cut the recipe in half in case we didn't like, now I wish I had made the full batch.

Just made these cookies this morning and they are absolutely fabulous!  Eating one now with strong coffee.  I used a bag of milk chocolate and peanut butter chips and they are sooooo good!  This is my favorite cookie recipe by far and I will definately make these again, using semi sweet chocolate chips also.  I used margarine and they turned out great!

These are truly the best chocolate chip cookies I've ever made.  It was 90 degrees out today, high humidity, and I was cranky baking cookies...too hot.  Once I popped one of these into my mouth though, I forgot all about the heat!  Wow!  These are the best!

These are the best!!!! I have tried a million chocolate chip cookie recipes over the years, but my cookies always turned out like hockey pucks.  I've made these twice, and both times they have turned out soft and moist.  I will definitely pass this recipe along to friends and family!

These came out pretty crunchy (I cooked at 325 as others had suggested) instead of chewy. They were still good, but not what I expected.

My cookies had a good flavor...I followed the recipe but I must have done something wrong.  The first batch they all ran into each other, so the rest of them I put in a small glass casserole dish.  Turned out great as a bar cookie.  Wonder what I did wrong?

amazing! best choc chip cookies i've ever made. and my husband thought they were out of this world (and he would tell me otherwise if not!).  i used unsalted butter and then used not quite a tsp full of salt. i also forgot to get the butter and eggs at room temp before i started, so i left them on top of the oven to heat up a bit while i prepared everything. by the time i needed them, they were close to room temp! thank you for a great recipe!

These were REALLY GOOD, on the thinner side with crisped edges and soft, chewy middles.  They spread b/c of the all butter content.  Baking on parchment keeps them from getting too browned.  The neighbor kids gobbled these up!

Tried this last night. Fabulous recipe. I ran out of chocolate chips and ground up chocolate squares, which turned out waaaaay better than store bought chips. :-)

I wish I could give these 4 1/2.  Really good but not the best I've ever had/made.  One thing I like about this recipe is you can get away with dirtying only one measuring cup; the 1/2 cup (and one measuring spoon too!)

normal good cookie. maybe better with milk choco chips? mine came out soft but a little dry... i thought the batter was a bit dry in the first place. wonder if it's because of the butter... should i have left it in room temperature longer? if baked for another minute or so, they become crispy.

These cookies were great and had the perfect texture, crisp on the outside and soft in the middle.
I followed the suggestion of cutting back on the salt to 1/2 tsp. It tasted good but I felt it could have used the whole 1 tsp. The full tsp. brings out more of the sweetness of the cookie and rounds out the flavor better.  Just make sure to use UNSALTED butter. I also doubled the vanilla. I baked these cookies at 330 degrees for 12 minutes on a dark nonstick baking sheet.
Also make sure to use keep your dough cool.  I kept my bowl of dough in the fridge between batches baking.  And I also rotated the baking sheets so that I was also placing the spoons of dough on a cool sheet, too. This will keep your cookie from melting too quickly and flattening in the oven. For a more aesthetic look and for the chocolate lover-- before you bake, press several chocolate chips on the tops of each spoon of dough while on the baking sheet. The cookies will come out looking like you bought them at a bakery!

I have read others review of this recipe and must say, if they had problems with this recipe, maybe they should re-evaluate their skills in the kitchen.  This is a very good recipe.  I can't stop eating them and anyone that has tasted my cookies, loves this recipe.  Awesome!!

These were delicious!  I took the advice of other reviewers and only used 1/2 tsp of salt, and just 2 cups of flour.  They turned out chewy and tasty!  Oh, and the cookie dough is super yummy.

These cookies were delicious! The only changes I made was using 2 cups of flour instead of 2.5 and using 1/2 a teaspoon of salt instead of 1 teaspoon. I also baked for 8 minutes on 350 degrees and they came out soft and chewy!

I use a variation of this recipe every day in my bakery/cafe.  It is our number two seller, next to our double fudge brownies.  The funny thing is, both recipes are from my Grandmother...Anna!

We use more white flour than oat, otherwise, the recipe is the same, and FABULOUS!  TRY IT!!

The taste of these cookies was very yummy, though I think I screwed up the texture by using tub margerine! I would recomend sticking to the recipe and using regular butter, and not substituting.

Very moist and tasty. I didn't have unsalted butter and I thought that there was a slight salty taste with the recommended salt. Next time, I will half.

Wonderful! I used to burn the bottom of cookies while trying to leave them in long enough to firm up, but now I can take these out a little early and they are perfect! I have gotten a ton of compliments when I've taken these to work, and I have had consistently good results.

These spread out really big and got really flat for me. Plus I overcooked them slightly and they got a bit too crunchy for my liking.  And they were too greasy.  Aside from all that, they had a really delicious taste. I used half choc chips and half heath bits. It was a nice touch. I'm definately going to try this recipe again.

These cookies are absolutely delicious!!! I found that if you put in a little less salt the cookies turn out much better.

These were pretty good, though nothing special.  Just your average choc. chip cookie.  By the OUTSTANDING reviews I read, I thought they were going to be something amazing... kind of disappointed.. just your run of the mill chocolate chip cookie.

Very good cookie, not so "pretty" but good.  Football Sunday = boredom for me, so I decided to bake cookies.  My 11 year old & his 2 buddies waited patiently for these to get done, the one boy asked "where's the milk?"  Thanks Stacey!

Delicious.  I made cookies using this recipe, but didn't have much in the way left of chocolate chips, so used white chocolate chips instead, added oats, chopped walnuts and some coconut (everything but the kitchen sink went into these cookies).  I took them into to work and everyone raved over them.  Very good and I would highly recommend them!

I had them in the oven for the full 10 minutes and they weren't too soft, or too crispy.  Everyone loved them, and took handfuls home with them.  One person even said they were the best cookies they've ever eaten.  They still remember them weeks later.

I hate it when cookies get runny while cooking, and that's why I loved those, they don't run! They stay nice and thick so the inside stays chewy. I substituted Butter Flavor Crisco for the butter and it worked all the same. Thanks Anna!

Disappointing recipe.  I agree with the several other reviewers who commented that this is nothing better than the traditional tollhouse recipe. Taste was acceptable but not exceptional.

This is a great cookie! I used vegan margarine, egg replacer instead of eggs, vegan chocolate chips (they're DARK!!), and a vegan sugar (non-refined)...I still had to use the brown sugar....BUT it worked beautifully! Excellent!!!

The cookies tasted like they had too much flour in them. It didn't taste like a real chocolate chip cookie. It was too dough-y. I don't think I'll ever make it again.

These are wonderful cookies!  I used a 1/4 measuring cup to make mine and increased the baking time to 11-12 minutes.  Huge, soft and delicious...  A lot of the problems I read that people had with this recipe can be attributed to dark baking sheets, uncalibrated ovens, warm cookie sheets, cold butter, cold eggs, etc... common baking problems.  Read up on baking basics if you aren't completely familiar with the process!  Then try these cookies - they are great!

Sorry- but I thought these were horrible.  They didn't turn out.  They were extremly flat and the browned so fast but the middle's were goo.  Won't make these again.  I through out half the batch during baking.  I don't know what happened.  I always make cookies and they have never turned out like this before.  Jessie

We just love these cookies.  I had some imitation French vanilla extract which I tried and it worked.   Baked for 8 minutes and the cookies were soft which is the way we like them.  Thank you for sharing.

My husband is very, very picky when it comes to food, particularly anything with chocolate in it. But he loves this recipe! The salty juxtaposes the sweet absolutely perfectly. There's a lot of butter in it, but hey, who would complain about that? I'm going to add nuts next time to see if that'll change the texture of the cookie. Overall, really soft and delicious.

I really hate when people rate a recipe after making multiple changes, but I did decrease the salt just a tad and cooked them at 325 on the convection option for about 13 minutes.  Even the ones I left out overnight were STILL super soft.  Someone wrote that they were really flat and I found them to be opposite, next time I'll flatten mine a bit before baking.  They were awesome cookies and I'm adding this to my hardcopy recipe book.  I'm going to have to hide them from myself because I lack self control LOL!

The recipe is good, but the cookies fell a little flat, literally.... They spread like crazy! I doubled the baking soda and it helped a little, but I would recommend baking them at 350 for about 11 minutes, because 375 burns the bottoms. Also double the vanilla extract, makes it better... True to yield, and very basic, if you like that kind of thing :)

My ONLY difference was to use mini M&M baking bits - I did not have chocolate chips. They were great - soft, chewy, great texture. Do not overbake! Remember they continue to bake on the pan. Take them out at exactly 7 minutes, let them cool one minute, remove. Perfect!

It was very good but be careful not to over beat because they come out very cakey. Next time I will use the mixer on the lowest velocity and make sure to leave a little bit of crumbly texture instead of a smooth mix. Also I think they should be baked to a lower temperature like 350 f for about 9 minutes.

I gotta go 5 with this. I used my trusty kitchen aid mixer with the dough hook though. Melted the butter in the MW and went 50/50 with dark chocolate and butterscotch chips. I chilled the dough for an hour to stiffen it up, then rolled a ball, a little smaller than a golf ball for each cookie. It made an even 36 on the convection setting in my gas range. This one's going to my keeper file for sure with big thanks to Anna from my kids, their friends and yours truely!
Flat? Cake like? You got me....mine were picture and pallet perfect!

Super!  I deleted the other CC receipes I had. This is the only one I will use now.  I didn't change anything with the exception using Imperial margarine instead of butter.

Delicious! Some said they thought the salt might be too much. It wasn't. Leave the recipe as is. But even if you add less salt, that's ok too! These are delicious!

I am a professional baker and these cookies are amazing!!!!! The ratio of ingredients are perfect!  I used 1 cup dark chocolate chips and 1 cup butterscotch instead to mix things up and also only used 1/2 teaspoon salt as suggested in previus reviews.

YUM  These turned out great! I did only teeny changes that fit our house. I used a teaspoon sea salt, because thats what we like with our chocolate and I baked at 325 degrees for 13 or so minutes watching carefully, my oven is having its personal issues, hot and cold flashes ...like me...aging gracefully! But great cookies, it is already taped in my "Best Recipe" cookbook I will be giving to my daughters when they grow up ! THANKS !

Great Cookies but way too much salt. I used unsalted butter and the amount of salt it called for and I will do half that much next time. They seem to stayed big, not flat, regardless of if it was put in the fridge or not.  I cooked them for 9 minutes at 350.

Awesome!  All the chocolate chip cookies that I've tried to make always turned out hard after a few minutes.  These were totally the opposite.  They stood soft and chewy on the inside and a little crispy around the edges.  Absolutely delicious!  Reduce the salt to 1/2 tsp. If the cookies last a day or two (everyone will eat them!) because you made alot like I did, microwave them for like 10 - 15 seconds.  Htey taste so much better!

These came out good, but not quite what I was looking for.  As a lot of others said, they are definitely "cakey".  I think next time I will halve the baking soda and add a little more vanilla for a sweeter taste.  These aren't bad, just not the chewy texture I'm looking for.

Not one of our favorites.  While they did stay puffy and soft, they were very cake-like and not chewy like we prefer our chocolate chip cookies.  Kids still ate a few, but probably won't make this one again.

FINALLY!!!  I chocolate chip recipe that "I" can make.  After over 30 years of trying, this is the recipe that I found that produces the richest cookies.  I've never been able to bake a chocolate chip cookie that turns out well.  This recipe turned out the best cookies ever.  A definite "5" in my book.

This is the chocolate cookie recipe I always go back to. I find 3/4 cup of brown sugar is all that is needed.  I have two favorite chocolate chip cookies on this site and this is one of them.  This is a soft chocolate cookie.

Also reduced the temp to 350 for 10 mins. But they turned out great, for a first timer! Used red and green M&Ms instead of choc chips too, for a holday cookie exchange! Yummy and easy!

Best with 3/4 cup of sugar, and 3/4 cup of brown sugar, then I used 2 teaspoons of vanilla. I also cut the baking soda to 1/2 a teaspoon so it wouldn't be so cake like.

This cookie recipe was pretty good.    The only thing I would do next time is cut down on the raising agent as they turned out a little cake-y for me.  Having said that, the brown sugar I used wasn't the usual soft kind (I live in Seoul & have to be happy with what I can get sometimes ingredients-wise!), so they probably would have been chewier had they had the caramel-y effect of soft brown sugar.  I'll give them another crack.

I cannot believe this recipe! I am one of those women who loves a late night snack after the hubby and kids are in bed. Naturally, my favorite sweet treat is a well-made chocolate chip cookie. I belong to the "thick and chewy" camp rather than the "thin and crispy." I had been having bad luck with thin cookies, so I turned to this website for guidance. This recipe promised to be cakey and delicious.  But lo and behold, when the cookies finally emerged from the oven, they were completely thin! I couldn't believe it. Not only that, they took unbelievably long to bake (fifteen minutes)! I was very disappointed. I had been so looking forward to some thick, chocolate goodness, and instead, I got the usual greasy, crunchy mess. I just don't understand what went wrong. Of course, my daughters and husband had to eat all of them, and I was left at midnight with an unfulfilled craving for something delicious. I've been driven to boxed cookies from Safeway. Perhaps others will have more luck?

This is a good cookie but I was missing a bit of that extra flavor you get from the regular tollhouse recipe.  These cookies were nice, properly thick, soft cookies.  Will make again-------:o)

Wow, I have tried 4 of the chocolate chip cookie recipes on this site (all with more/higher ratings than this one) and I personally love this most!!  My boyfriend agrees.  Not too cakey, not too mushy, not too crispy.  Just right for us.  We followed the recipe to the letter but used Smart Balance (we can't have milk products).

These were a little too cake like for me and not sweet enough. The kids liked them though. I'm going to try agian with more white sugar. Maybe that will help.

This recipe was great! So quick and easy for delicious, homemade cookies! I had a hard time softening my hard brown sugar so I heated it up in the microwave with the butter and it ended up making my batter warm, which melted my chocolate chips when I added them in. My friends were mystified about how amazingly delicious my marbled chocolate cookies were.

These were delicious, however, I did add an extra teaspoon of vanilla per the many recommendations.  They turned out much better than when I followed the recipe exactly.  I would call these the perfect chocolate chip cookie!

Thanks!  These are the best chocolate chip cookies I've ever made!  I increased the flour 1/4 cup, and the temperature at 350 for 10 minutes.  I also made sure I mixed with electric mixer well every time I added an ingredient, and added the flour a little at a time.  The eggs and butter should be at room temperature as well.  They stay soft and taste great!

I have tried a large number of chocolate chip cookie recipes on this site, and PHEW! I am finally done searching! This is a simple, chewy, very tastey chocolate chip cookie.  I use 1/2 cup butter, and 1/2 cup butter flavored shortening in place of the 1 cup butter. the shortening gives it a little more shape, and keeps them from going flat.  Thank you so much! Every time I make these my husband and my brother comment on how good these are. This is our go-to recipe for chocolate chip cookies. FINALLY! My search is over!

Very good! Only thing I did differently was put 1 1/4 cup of flour because I had a bad experience with another recipe. Turned out good, although I overcooked them.

These were great! I'm more of a cook than a baker and I notice that in my family, people tend to use more of that fake butter stuff than the real stuff when baking (I don't know why! I think the realy stuff taste better)Some in my family complain when I use real butter that it doesn't taste like butter (huh?) so I added 1/2 tsp. butter flavoring found in the seasoning isle of the grocery store the first time. They didn't notice the diffence. I did. The batch with flaving tasted fake and over flavored. This recipe is perfect just the way it is. 

I did have to adjust the baking time to get the cookies to the right doness I like but everyone's oven is different.

This is a great, basic chocolate chip cookie recipe. I don't know how you could possibly mess it up. Follow basic baking rules of using slightly softened butter and mix in dry ingredients/chips by hand - absolutely delicious. No frills - just your classic choc. chip cookie, great with a big glass of milk.

These are good cookies and bake up so nice. I used softened butter and room temp eggs as suggested by another reviewer. I used a Tablespoon cookie scoop and baked them for 12 minutes at 350. These cookies didn't run all over the pan like some do that are made with butter.

I have looked endlessly for a moist chocolate chip cookie recipe and I have found it!  I knew this was the one as soon as my son kept emptying the cookie jar and his friends did the same!  I can never seem to keep the cookie jar full :)
These cookies are soooo moist and stay that way.  I did take advice from another baker, who also rated this recipe, and I only added 1/2 tsp. salt instead of the full tsp. the recipe called for.  The cookies do seem to stay moist and not spread out as much.  Thank you so much.  This is now my family's chocolate chip cookies recipe, and will be handed down.  :)

Really great cookies.  I baked my cookies on a baking mat ontop of a cookie sheet at 350 for 10 min.  They came out crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside (once cooled).  These cookies didn't spread enough for me - I enjoy flatter cookies.  After making 1" balls I flattened them with my fingers.  But if you like fatter cookies, leave as is.  This one's going in my recipe box.

Fabulous and extremely easy recipe to follow.  To those who rated the recipe low, I agree with another member-you may want to explore other avenues of food preperation.  This chocolate chip recipe was soft, gooey, and incredible yummy.

These are some of the best cookies I have ever made, and I consider myself quite the cookie expert.  I made 2 small changes: I used equal amounts of brown and white sugar and I reduced the amount of butter to 3/4 cup.  They were absolutely delicious!

I fail to see what all the fuss is about. My first batch burnt because the temp was a wee bit high for my oven. My second batch turned out ok.. but I found them nearly inedible. No chewiness, no crispiness, the chocolate seems to disappear into the cookies.. just not for me.

I promised my boys I'd bake choc-chip cookies for them today & then I could not find my recipe! (U think I'd have it memorized by now! LOL)  This recipe is a good one!  It was an easy one to follow & the results are very good!  To my tastes (and they are still cooling) they are good all-round cookies.  One suggestion - decrease the salt by 1/2.  And I must make my cookies a bit smaller, because I got 6 dozen out of this recipe.

these were pretty good! it was a little cakey, but my mom really liked them and said they were the best cookies ive made. personally, i thought they could be a little sweeter but thats probably why she liked them. also i substitued half the chocolate chips for mint chips, and they turned out great! really easy to make, and all in all a cookie i would make again.

I agree with another reviewer...too much flour, not enough sugar.  Even as I was tasting the batter I thought it was awfully floury.  They are definitely soft, though, which is nice.  I used a bag of Nestle peanutbutter and chocolate chips, and the flavor just wasn't right.  Normally you can sub stuff like that in cc cookies, so I am a bit disappointed.  My 4 year old loves them, though, but I can't say much for a child who will eat a hot dog for every meal.   I think I'll be sticking to my old standby, from Betty Crocker, or even better, my Wilderness Place Lodge cookies (on this site).  I also reduced the temp to 350 because I didn't feel the cookies were being baked all the way through.

Wow.  I read through many of the reviews AFTER I had mixed up these cookies.  I was a bit skeptical that I wasn't going to be happy with the results, but these cookies are awesome.  They are gooey, chocolatey, sweet and all-around yummy.  They turned out perfect- crisp only around the edges, and soft and gooey in the middle.  
Oh, one more thing- I tend to over-bake cookies, so I reduced the temp to 350.

These were excellent cc cookies--definitely the best that this novice baker has made.  Based on other reviews, I did make a few modifications.  I reduced flour by 1/2 cup. I melted the butter first using a double boiler and then melted the brown sugar (minus 2 tablespoons) in the butter mixture (off heat now). Once it had cooled a bit I beat in the white sugar.  To the flour mixture, I added: 2 teaspoons baking powder and 1 teaspoon salt.  I also tripled the vanilla and added 1-2 tablespoons of milk.  On my air-onsulated cookie sheet, 12 minutes was a perfect cooking time, but on my non-air cookie sheet, 12 minutes was a tad too long.

These cookies come out brilliant everytime! Everyone who has tried them ALWAYS wants more!

Once I used soft butter instead of normal butter, and the cookies were too liquid to be cooked normally - so instead, I filled a cake tray with the mixture, and made COOKIE CAKE! It was insane, I recommend it!

Not very good at all, sorry. too cakey, they weren't even chewy , not even when eaten hot, right  out of the oven. I wouldn't make these again.I think if you would make it with less flour, they might be a little better.

It has an excellent flavor.  However, the cookie spreads a great deal and thus the texture is very flimsy.  I will try it again, but with less butter.

I almost feel like my rating of this recipe was unnessacary since everyone else was right on in what they said. These cookies are excellent! They are similar to the traditional toll house cookies. I doubled the recipe and gave them away to everyone and they were very well recieved. Wonderful recipe!!

These were very good cookies.  Definitely above average.  Good cookies if you like a firm cake like texture.  I read a few reviews here before baking and saw some used shortening.  I used half butter and half butter flavored shortening.

These cookies are so yummy!  I made them in the evening and let them sit 
overnight - they tasted a million times better and everyone gobbled them up!
They are not too sweet, not too crunchy, not too soft, but are too perfect!  I 
recommend this recipe to everyone!

THIS IS GREAT, THE LAST FEW COOKIES I MADE WERE FLOPS! ONE THING I DID DO WAS REFRIGERATE THE DOUGH FOR 2HRS BEFORE I COOKED THE COOKIES. WHOEVER SAYS TOO MUCH SUGAR, I JUST DONT UNDERSTAND THAT! THEY WERE PERFECT, THEY LOOK LIKE BAKERY COOKIES AND NOT TOO SWEET AT ALL.

This recipe turned out great! I only used half a cup of butter and added a little olive oil to make up for it. My cookies did not turn out chewy, but it was soft. Yummy cookies and easy to make.

As a novice baker, I was looking for a basic, no-frills chocolate chip cookie recipe to start on my new baking adventures.  This one was it for me---I appreciate how simple the instructions were to follow and how successful the cookies came out.  I didn't have any pure vanilla extract so I had to use single-strength vanilla imatation and double the quantity, but the cookies still tasted delicious.  I also used Nestle Tollhouse semisweet chips to good effect.  Thank you to to whomever created and submitted this recipe!

Absolutely, hands down the best Chocolate Chip Cookie recipe, with a couple alterations:Add 1/3 cup Bailey's Irish Cream 1/3 cup more Flour More Chips, including Butterscotch chips. The extra salt makes the difference!

I loved this recipe.  The cookies kept their shape very well.  I think chilling the dough helped with that.  I added a cup of chopped walnuts and used the mini chocolate chips.  The chocolate seems to get more evenly distributed that way.  This is a keeper.  They taste just as good as the toll house originals, and the texture is better.

This recipe is so great I keep making it again and again!  
I had to shorten the cooking time for my mom's electric oven so they would be chewyer:)  Fantastic recipe!

This recipe was simple and quick and really made the best chocolate chip cookie.  
The ingredients are already in the cupboard so you can make them any time.  I 
made them for my 2 year old son--they're better than the store bought cookies
and as good as any gourmet cookie from any fancy cafe.

I catered my friend's cookout and these went BEFORE the main meal! By far, the best chocolate chip recipe I have found. So easy (I didn't even have a hand mixer...)!! Thanks

Overall, very good cookies. A touch on the cakey side, but that's less a complaint than a compliment. I like them that way. I didn't have to change anything to the recipes, worked very well as-is. Thanks!

I found these cookies a little less dense and chewy than I like my cookies, but I took them to a party where I knew only the host and spent the entire night hearing "Wow, so you're the girl who made the cookies.  They're great cookies!".  I used m&ms instead of choc-bits (can't get the latter here in China), a high gluten flour ("dumpling flour" - again, all that was available), and popped the dough in the freezer for 1/2 an hour before baking.  I found them best when taken out when they were still quite soft (but no longer shiny) and left on the baking tray for a couple of minutes before putting on a rack.  A couple of minutes past this point, and they become too crunchy when cooled (I didn't take those ones to the party!).

Maybe I did something wrong?  These cookies were terrible.  They came out like little round cakes!  The usual cookies I bake would flatten out a bit, but these remain in clumps (and no, they were not undercooked).  They were like little mini cakes with chocolate chips.  It had too much flour :-/

Yes , this makes a great cookie, there a re so many chocolate chips that you have to work to keep them all in the dough. The first batch I pre heat the oven  to 375F , put the cookies in turn in the oven off then immediately back on set to 350F for 15 minutes. They came out exactly. The next batch I repeated all the steps but cut the cook time to 13 minutes.. incredibly soft and moist !

Wow!  These cookies are wonderful!  They did not go flat and were soft and oh so yummy.  I cooked them at 350 for 8 minutes.  I was baking other cookies and didn't realize the temperature change.  Nothing bad came of it!  They were perfect!  I will always use this recipe!  Thank you!

These are amazing! Perfect combination of chewy and crunchy. I know many reviewers suggested cutting the salt, but I guess I'm a salty girl because I used salted butter (all I had available) and still added 1/2 tsp sea salt, used a combination of semisweet and milk chocolate chips, and I will never need another chocolate chip cookie receipe again!

With almost 900 positive reviews, I thought this was going to be a sure winner. Boy was I surprised. These are decidedly the worst cookies I've ever made! I had to check myself to make sure I didn't do something right because these cookies are ridiculously fluffy and very, very bland. My 10 year old took one bite and put it back on the pan. My 5 year old came in later and tried one, and the first thing he said was, "These taste weird." I threw them all in the trash.

I just made these cookies this evening and the recipe came out perfect. I did take other reviewers' suggestions by cutting the salt in half. I'm very happy with the cookies. The first batch I baked at 350 for 12 minutes. They came out flat and yummy. The second and third batch were baked at 375 for 10 minutes. I had chilled the remaining batter so I figured I would raise the temperature. They came out a little thicker but yummy as well! This is my first time baking chocolate chip cookies and I have officially ruined my appetite for dinner! Oh and I only used a cup of mini chip semi sweet morsels. I'm not a big chocolate fan and this worked out great for my cookies.

Good. Chewy. Easy. I use half milk and half bittersweet choco chips. I also tend to under cook them so they stay soft!

These were excellent! They turned out perfectly-- crisp edges but cakey texture, so they look  pretty too. I was even missing an egg so I added a generous splash of heavy cream to make up for it (why, I don't know) but it worked. Yummy!

This is the best cookie recipe I have found. I use it all the time. I like to put the oven on 350 it doesn't brown them so bad. Thank you for this recipe. I have tried so many choc. chip cookie recipes but none as good as these.

I tried this recipe last night and they were good but I will continue looking for a great one! If you love cookie dough, these are the cookies for you! Even after cooling overnight, they stay somewhat gooey and soft. I left the first batch in for 8 min and they were getting really dark on the bottom but they stayed almost raw in the middle. The second batch I took out after 7min and the bottom was perfect but they were even more raw in the center. Those two batches went in the oven at the same time and came out 'puffy' not flat, however, the third batch which had to wait about 10min before going in the oven came out very flat! I read that another person had this problem of spreading out a lot. If you saw them you would think they were two diffrent recipes even though I used a cookie scoop for all batches and didn't flatten them before baking.
They are also a little salty for my taste. Great if your looking for a sweet&salty taste but if you take a bite with no chocolate (which is hard to do cause these are loaded!), the cookie tastes much saltier than expected. If I make these again, I will probably leave out the salt all togther!

I LOVE this recipe I have my own secrets I add too this but only a few, and the cookie the first time I made it with no tweeks was amazing. I like how they take like no time so I finish them quickly. I make these for my grandma and she hides them from everyone! Its great all around and I HIGHLY recommend it to anyone.

I have made many chocolate chip cookies, and this recipe was by far the worst. The taste of flour and salt overwhelmed the entire cookie and i didn't particularly care for the texture.

I had to review...my husband loved these and he's very picky! The only thing I changed was adding an extra egg and I used half white and half whole wheat flour.  I baked at 350 for 9 to 10 mins. Very good recipe!!

I've made these cookies twice, thinking that I messed them up the first time, but no. These are probably the worst chocolate chip cookies I've ever made. Dough is very bland and spreads terribly.

These cookies are good. The only reason I didn't give them 5 stars is because there is something that needs to be subtracted and I'm not quite sure what.

I have used this recipe for so many years now that I thought that it'd be real sin if I didn't tell everyone how I cherish and value this particular cookie recipe! I have made so many batches of cookies and so many cookie cakes for kids' b'days. Now my boys are older but this is still their favorite!

I followed others' advice and reduced salt to 1/2 tsp. My cookies were about 1.5" wide after baking, so actually only took 8 minutes of bake time. I also used butter and eggs at room temperature. My only significant change - add 1 1/2 cups of finely ground pecans to stir in the mixture after the addition of flour. It gives the cookie a FABULOUS taste that distinctly sets it apart from the run of the mill chocolate chip cookie without defeating the purpose of baking a familiar comfort food. I also used milk chocolate chips, personal preference.

These are a good flavored cookie, but not my favorite.  We like a chewy cookie and had a little trouble keeping this from being a little overdone and crisp.  They were very thin and flat.

I've tried A LOT of chocolate chip recipes and I'm not 
the best baker in the world but they all seem to burn on the bottom (even when i leave them in for the recommended time) and this is one of the 1st recipes ive found that cooked AWESOME at 10mins, no burnt bottoms, no hockey puck cookies!

awesome recipe and i'll stick to this one for sure!!!

Delicious!!  The best chocolate chip cookie recipe I've found with a solid cookie taste.  Took them to a large church function and they were a hit!  I'm not sure why people are getting a cakey texture-they don't have it at all.  Don't use semi-sweet chips, use milk chocolate and it's so much better!  Also, only use half the salt called for and bake at 325 for about 10 min. for perfection!

PERFECT! I just made these, used with 1-1/2 cups of chips and 4oz of german chocolate cut up into chunks (didn't have enough chips and had to improvise).  I baked at 350, be sure to take them out when the edges start to turn golden so the cookies stay chewy :)

I tried this recipe last night and the cookies were terriffic! My mother always told me to add coffee anytime I use chocolate so I added some espresso powder.  The cookies were indeed nice and chewey and will probably not make it through tonight.  This is now my "go to" recipe for C.C. cookies.

Pretty good cookie. I did add more brown sugar/lessen the white sugar and added an extra 1/4 tsp of baking soda to the 1tsp already added. It is cake-like - I do like it as well as the chewy kind too. I would like to find a recipe that is more chewy and fuller cookie like this one. I think the baking soda made it rise more. Overall a really good cookie and recipe.

These were the best home baked choc. chip cookies I have ever made!!!  Just excellent and so very simple to make.  There is just no way you could not like these cookies.  I will never use any other recipes.  My only complaint is that I halved the servings because I didn't want 48, now I only have 24 and they are going fast.  Yummy : )

These cookies were very good for a cake-type chocolate chip cookie.  They taste great right out of the oven and stay soft.  I'm not sure why people thought the oven temp. was too high.  I initially lowered the temp to 350F and it took about 16min. to cook the first batch.  I then increased the oven to 375 and it took 10-12min depending on h ow big I made the cookies.  In total I got 39 cookies out of the batch.  I used a mix of semi-sweet and milk chocolate chips since I ran out of semi-sweet and the mix worked well.  Will make again when craving a cake-type cookie, although my absolute favourite chewy is from Chef Michael Smith on the food network, made with oats and walnuts.  Soooo good!

A truely amazing chocolate chip cookie recipe!! I followed the recipe as written and it worked out well. I recommend putting in the 1 tsp salt. It really gives the cookie lots of flavour and they don't taste salty at all. My kids loved these cookies. Will make again. Thanks for sharing, Stacey!

Very good cookies. Kids dug into them within minutes of coming out of the oven. I only used 1/4 cup of white sugar and increased the brown by the difference. Cooked at 350 degrees for 10 minutes, came out perfect. Temperature is important and you need to know your stove. Mine keeps almost exact temperature so I am finding that with most recipes I can lower the temp slightly.  Will make again.

These cookies were perfect (a little too perfect - I am ashamed to admit how many cookies my husband and I ate last night)! I baked them at 350 degrees as suggested in some of the other comments, but otherwise did not modify this recipe at all. Thank you!

I guess it's a matter of preference but these cookies were way too fluffy and cake-like for me. They taste fine, but the consistency just isn't what I expect for a chocolate chip cookie.

This is an excellent recipe. I followed the suggestions and baked at 350 instead of 375 and cut the salt in half. I also doubled the vanilla and added just a little bit more brown sugar and they turned out perfect. I baked them for ten minutes and when you take them off the sheet they're so soft and gooey its almost like they aren't done and they will fall apart if you aren't careful but trust me, they're done and they're fabulous. The cookies are "cakey" as others have said but that is sooo not a bad thing at all. The next day the cookies are still as soft and yummy as they are hot from the oven. I will definitely be coming back to this recipe again and again.

I have made these cookies twice, and both times they have end up more like a cake than a cookie. My fiance said they "kind of taste like a pancake," they are definitely a cake-like cookie.

I agree with the other reviews I've read.  I cut the salt to only 1/2 a tsp. and changed the oven temp. from 375 to 325 and baked my cookies for 10 minutes per batch.  They turned out so good!!!  I will definitely make these again.

Really good classic chocolate chip cookies. Definitely LOTS of chocolate chips. Check cookies after 8 minutes to see if browned. Made 60ish small cookies that didn't flatten too much. Overall good cookies.

I'm not sure about these cookies, to tell you the truth. The batter spread A LOT on the sheet and I think there might actually have been too many chocolate chips. I realize that might be blasphemy for some people, but the cookies had more chocolate chips than cookie. I will try these again with fewer chocolate chips. On a good note, my husband loves them.

I followed this recipe to a t. It's lacking that "wow" factor...it was good. I've had better, I've had worse. Nothing to write home about.

I'll give it 4STARS, but don't get me wrong with these.. IT IS CHEWY AND PERFECT. It's just that for me, there's something missing.. and rather than adding 1teaspoon of salt, I only added half. It's just that there's still something missing. But 100% that I'm gonna bake this again. :)

These came out very good.  I did add walnuts.  I did not need to chill the dough to keep the cookies from flattening with this recipe which was nice.  I will make these again.

Loved these cookies, but my only recommendation is to use 1/2 teaspoon of salt especially if you use salted butter. But other then that they were really yummy.

Don't mess with this recipe. It is perfect. I've been making this recipe for years and it never fails to make cookies that are crunchy and chewy all at the same time.

These were excellent, would have preferred them to be thicker instead of thinner, next time i guess i should add more baking powder, kind of sweet though next time I will use less brown sugar & add pecans or almonds this recipe is a keeper.

These were the best!  I have been searching for the perfect chocolate chip cookie...not thin and crunchy, but not cakey either.  I reviewed a LOT of recipes and decided on this one, based on the ratio of sugar to flour.  I am so pleased with the results!  I cooked them for a generous 10 minutes on parchment, 12 cookies per pan.  I let the butter and eggs come to room temperature before using them, and I did not refrigerate the dough before baking.  When the timer went off I was not sure that they were actually done…the edges were golden but the tops were still a little light, but I removed them from the oven and left them in the pan for about 10 minutes (enough time to cook another pan).  Once cool they were firm and chewy and just the right thickness.  Delicious!  I have finally found the chocolate chip cookie recipe I have been looking for, after many years of searching.

I made these cookies for my sister's volleyball team for a pre-game snack and all the girls absolutely LOVED them! I made sure to give them bags that weren't too full because full tummys before a game isn't the greatest but they asked for more! Will definitely make again!

I used butter flavored Crisco instead of butter and doubled the vanilla.  The texture and flavor were good but I think next time I'll use butter and see how that works. I don't know why some reviewers say they are bland (or flat, or puffy, or dry) - when I looked for a recipe they were all about the same.  Maybe the difference is in the preparation, not the recipe.

These are EXCELLENT and I'm glad they turned out to be just what I was looking for.  I'm not a cookie baker but they came out just the way I wanted at 350 for 12 minutes.  I live in Vegas and would make special trips to the Toll House shop at the Miracle Mile Shops for their cookies.  I think these are just as good. Mine flatten after sitting out of the oven for a few minutes being slightly crispy on the outer edge and very (perfectly) gooey on the inside.  I did exchange 1/2 of the a.p. flour for org soy flour trying to get away from some of the gluten.  I'm wondering if that is why they flattened a little.  But I don't mind.  They are perfect! And I added pecans!

Diaster. I was so excited fromm reading the reviews of this recipe. I followed the directions of the recipe exactly, except for the reviewers suggestions to chnage the temperature to 350 and half the amount of salt. They were flat as a pancake. I could literally look through them. Also I could not get them to bake properly. Either they were raw cookie dough, or burnt, dry crisps. My family, however, ate some of them out of loyalty.

Yummy, they taste exactly like the Famous Amos cookies. However, I'm only giving it four stars as I felt that the recipe is a bit too sweet for my taste. Next time I'll add less sugar and chocolate chips.

Awesome!! I work in construction often being the only girl on site. It can be hard at times but these cookies can soften any mans heart. They request them often!! I add M&Ms. Depending on the time of year I mix in the different colored ones to match the holiday...special colored M&Ms make for great holiday cookies!!!

These are the best chocolate chip cookies I've tried so far. I am still searching for that perfect cookie, though (which I may never find, because I am too picky!). I baked these at 350 for 12 minutes. They thin out a lot, which I actually like better than a thick, cakey cookie.

These cookies are AWESOME! My family loved them!  I followed the advice of others and increased the vanilla to 2 tsp and decreased the salt to 1/2 tsp.  I also baked the cookies at 350 until the edges were browned and let them sit on the baking sheets for about 10 minutes after removing them from the oven.  Perfection!  I'll never use another chocolate chip cookie recipe!!

Very good...I didnt have chocolate chips so I used some left over chocolates I had just cut them up.  I used someone else suggestions and baked them at 350 for about 11 minutes or so.

Very good cookie, but almost too buttery.  This cookie is very rich.  I added 1/2 cups oats instead of flour.  Delicious - but quite decadent.

These came out great.  I used more brown sugar than white as suggested and they are soft and chewy.  Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly.  Thanks.

With all the reviews saying how great these were, I had to try it. Unfortunately disappointing. I'll stick to my Mrs. Fields recipe from now on. These were very cakey. Definately need to cut the baking soda back 1/2, big balls of cake.

I made this because I wanted to eat the dough, and it was just right. Tomorrow I will bake them. :)

Ok, it is tomorrow and some have been baked. They are fabulous!! I baked them at 350 for about 12 min. They were perfect, the edges a little crispy and the inside nice and soft... MMM I am bringing some to my guy at work right now!!

I doubled the recipe and then placed the dough in the fridge to chill for a little while (b/c it seemed too soft).  I used my small cookie scoop and baked these at 350 for 9 minutes.  I took them out when they looked a little "under-done" and let them set on the cookie sheets for a minute or two and then transferred to wire racks to cool & they set up just fine.  I gave some away and received a request for the recipe within the same hour.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.

Soft cookies, chewy edges. I used margarine instead of butter. I thought they tasted predominantly of flour and were greasy. Something was just missing as far as depth and richness of flavor. Decent recipe, but not a favorite.

These cookies are amazing; I love the chewy consistency a lot. Even my boyfriend (who eats top-knotch cookies all the time because his mother is a pastry chef) admitted that they were good. A little part of my soul died when I dropped some on the pavement.

Yum! Delicious cookies. The only ingredient I changed was that I used half the salt.
Also, I whipped the butter, sugar, egg and vanilla until it was the consistency of whipped cream and used the hand mixer to combine the wet and dry ingredients, too.
I baked the cookies at 350 for 11 minutes.

I wasnt even going to try this recipe, considering it was almost identical to the tollhouse recipe. But after reading all the reviews I decided to go for it...and what do you know, they looked and tasted just like Nestle tollhouse.

I've made these cookies probably fifty times now and my family and friends keep asking for more! I substitute one cup of chocolate chips with butterscotch chips and add 1/8 tspn of cinnamon (for browning and a little flavor twist). SO good!

I've made these cookies numerous times and have always gotten praise for them. The one thing I will say is that you MUST follow the recipe EXACTLY as is and do not hurry through any of the steps. I think the secret ingredient is patience. I've also noticed that every oven is VERY different, and you can get some varying results if you don't compensate for your oven.

I always have trouble with chocolate chip cookies - they never turn out quite right.  But these did!  Yay!  They were so good.  I made them exactly as the recipe says, but baked them at 350 for 12-13 minutes.  They came out soft, chewy, and delicious!  I'll definitely be making them again.

These cookies are absolutely delicious! I made them for friends and they all LOVED them! They're soft, flavorful, and easy to make. I definitely agree, though, that the amount of salt can be cut in half. Other than that, these cookies are perfect!

These cookies are great easy recipe.  I baked for 10 minutes because they weren't golden at 8.  They stayed much more moist than past cookies, and as a chocoholic, I loved the amount of chocolate in the cookies.  I do want to try and make these with half margarine to cut the fat.

These were good, I've had better, I've had worse. I didn't have any chocolate chips on hand, so I substituted M& M's. Will I make these again? I don't know, i might check out a couple other recipies. They tasted goo, they just weren't very memorable.

Wonderful and I did't change a thing!  I loved them!  They were chewy and melt in your mouth good!  I really think that many people either let the butter get too soft or they over mix the batter.  My family loved them!

I thought this recipe was very tasty.  I read other reviews that the cookies weren't sweet enough.  I added some extra sugar and brown sugar. I also refrigerated the cookie dough.  They came out perfect, but I had to make the alterations.

These are the best chocolate chip cookies ever! I've tried so many different recipes looking for the perfect chocolate chip cookie, and this is it! It also makes the best dough...I had to make myself quit eating it. Thanks for a great recipe!

My guys loved these. I think next time I will measure the vanilla instead of eyeballing it. It needed more. In my oven 8 to 10 mins was all it needed. This is a keeper.

I had no luck whatsoever with this recipe even though I followed it to the tee. First time I used real unsalted butter and the cookies flattened out and melted together. I tried it again with margarine and thought they were a little puffier, they were still quite flat. Not the best flavor either.  I was quite disappointed in this recipe, especially reading all the rave reviews. I don't at all understand how other bakers ended up with cakey cookies?

It's a recipe that works if you don't have many ingredients on hand. It's a simple recipe. The cookies are very cakey and light. Almost too light and airy. We like the rich,buttery REAL chocolate chip cookies. For a last minute idea with hardly any ingredients on a friday night--the kids were happy!

These cookies did not turn out as I planned. I made the recipe twice, just to make sure I made them correctly. I think it calls for way too much flour. They turned out very cakey and not as sweet as I as hoping. I ended up making another recipe that only called for 1 1/4 cups flour and that turned out much better.  This just did not have the texture I was after. :(

Well, we tried the recipie... and it wasn't the best. I thought it was much too sugary. So, I used half as much chocolate chips, and it still didn't taste that good. In my opinion, I think it was too sugary for me. If you are a person that craves sugar, U'll probably like it, but if you don't exactly crave sugar... well, I don't exactly crave sugar and so...

I gave this 4 stars because they wern't what I expected. These were my very first cookies so I was suprised since they didn't taste like the regular cookies out of the bakery. It was very very cakey. I liked it, but I was confused when I first saw it in the oven, since it looked like it wasn't done I added up to (in total) 25 minutes which made the cookies come out charred and stuff. The second batch was beautiful but again, confusing to tell if it was done or not. 

In the end I got a good wax paper full of cookies, lovely recipe. 

Edit: I WILL be using this recipe again, many many of my family members LOVE IT. My sister didn't too much because it was too sweet and gave her a toothache. Other than that (because she's not that important), this is a lovely recipe. Tastes better after you put it in the fridge overnight. [Gave this 5 stars now]

These cookies were NOT GOOD!!!  They were really bland and not a good texture at all. There was too much flour & not enough other tasty ingredients.  I took them to work and no one liked them either-So, it wasn't just me.  I will not use this recipe again. I will stick the the recipe on the back of the Tollhouse Bag.

I made these and my roomates plus most of my friend's dorm loved them.  They are exactly what I expect in a chocolate chip cookie, slightly crunchy on the outside, buttery, and moderately chippy.  Also, they are very forgiving to make, I had pretty inaccurate measures, a cheap shiny cookie sheet, and a bad oven and they still turned out great.

I always make these cookies to bring to parties and they're gone the minute I step in the door.  One of my friends even requests me to remember to make them whenever I'm invited to a party. I double up my cookie sheets to prevent burnt bottoms and they take about 10-12 minutes to bake.  I also cut up milk chocolate into chunks whenever I'm out of chocolate chips and they're still awesome!  I recently learnt the importance of the baking soda, I once made the cookies without it and they didn't spread out at all (they were still yummy though) Thanks for the recipe!

These cookies were okay, Id give them a 2.5 rating if possible. I agree with previous reviewers, they tasted very cakey. Not my idea of a great cookie.

This is a really good chocolate chip cookie recipe. Remember, you will always get the best results when you invest in the best ingredients. My cookies always turn out better when eggs and butter are at room temperature. You just can't beat a good chocolate chip cookie and a glass of milk! Enjoy.

Great recipe! Easy, too! Makes a wonderful chewy cookie.  Personally, I added a little less chocolate chips and brown sugar, and it was still fantastic.  I'll definately make these again!

I made these cookies sometime last week and I was expecting more from the reviews that I read. I make a lot of cookies(like to try new recipes), and I was not that impressed with this one. For the person who said they were too sweet, I actually forgot 1 cup of brown sugar....oops!! and they were still ok. Dont get me wrong, they were eddible but I dont think I will be making them again.

We just made this recipe tonight.  I was not as impressed as others.
There just seemed to be something missing.  I can't quite point it out.  Too fluffy for me.
I like the crispy on the outside gooey on the inside kind.  These were barely crispy and fluffy on the inside.  almost reminded me of little chocolate chip muffins.
one of the best recipes I ever had still beats this one.  With oatmeal flour in it.
sorry I'm not impressed

Turn your Kitchen Aid on slow and keep it going throughout the process, make sure to semi-melt a 1/2 cup of butter and then add 1/2 cup of Crisco instead of the second stick of butter.  It makes the cookies plump up more.  These have been a family favorite for 6 years!

Follow Directions Exactly. Hey, their cookies!
Good enough for me and my family.  A little greasy, but I used a oily black pan.  Space them about 2 inches apart.  Make sure you use a blender to mix the batter. Soft, just a little bit chewy, Not too Crispy except around edges. Ok, they spread out a bit when cooking.  They came out brown instead of a creamy ivory but so what??? Too many chocolate chips.

I am not a big baker and just joined this site. I was bored, I had a bag of chocolate chips on the cupboard, so I thought I'd look at recipes online. I came across this recipe, tried it, and it tatses great to me! Of course, I halved the recipe; I didn't have any vanilla; I didn't have any brown sugar so I used all white sugar (added a bit of cocoa powder for color); and I ended up putting a tiny bit of soya milk in the mix because it was too dry to make a dough! I also only put the cookies in for 6 minutes. Made 24 decent sized cookies, with some raw dough to much on. Thanks! Yum. Next time, I'll try it with brown sugar.

I've sent them in care packages to college students and given them to my husband.  I've even given them to my second graders.  The outcome is always the same:  EVERYONE LOVES THESE!  I use an ice cream scoop to make the cookies larger, and I bake them on a pizza stone.  They always turn out perfect!

This was the best cookie recipe i ever made. My friend Fanrui helped me w/ my history test so i made these for him and him and about all the other kids who stole them from him thought they were ABSOLUTELY AMAZING! I LOVED THEM. The only difference i made was i added milk chocolate chips instead of semi...i'm not a fan of semi. I loved them though, i dont know about that whole flat thing everyones talking about they were perfect to me. :)

I certainly would not rate this recipe with 5 stars.  The batter got to be so hard to stir that I actually had to ask my 6 year old to help for a minute.  I brought these cookies to a Labor Day party and they were a hit with the guests - just not with me.  The cookies are just "so-so".    I definitely prefer the original Tollhouse cookies to these.

This made the best choc chip cookies ever!  They stayed soft and chewy, which is just how I like them.  I used milk chocolate chips instead of semi-sweet.  Perfect!!!!  Will definitely make again and again!!

They were very good.

I just made these and I am so excited!  I always flub up chocolate chip cookies--they are either flat and hard or way too cakey.  These came out flawlessly.  I will use this recipe from now on.

Maybe I'm in the minority but I love soft cookies.  I just don't care for hard, crunchy chocolate chip cookies.  These were very soft (and stayed soft over time), very easy to make and quick.  My fiance got sick because he couldn't stop eating them lol. :)

Excellent!  These were, by far, the best chocolate chip cookies I've ever baked.  They were super-soft, almost cakey.  They don't last long when I bake them.  Thank you, Stacey!

This was the best chocolate chip cookie I have ever had.  I used half butter and half "I can't believe it's not butter, light"  which I think made it a moist, light cookie.  Very chewy.  I also added nuts.  Will use this recipe from now on.

This cookie recipe was by FAR the best I've ever made.  I've tried multiple chocolate chip cookie recipes, and this is the first one I've found that has a great texture, is chewy....and not flat and crunchy!! Spectacular!  Thanks for sharing!

I'm 14 and these are the first cookies I have ever made by myself.  They are delicious!  I didn't have chocolate chips so I used some dark chocolate Dove candies and chopped them up.  They worked great.  My mom and dad love them too.  :)

I've been looking for a recipe like this for years. These are just like the cokies I used to buy from the cookie stand when I was a student in Birmingham (UK). Dead easy, no weird ingredients, soft, moist and addictive. :-) The only thing I do differently is chill the dough - it seems to make them cook more evenly.

I've always believed the dough is better than the
cookie, but in this case I'll actually eat the
cookie. I added about 1 cup oatmeal and split the
chocolate chips with butterscotch chips. My hus-
band and kids like this recipe out of all I've
baked (even Tollhouse) and I've baked ALOT!
OOH YUM!

This was the first time I had strayed from the back of the TollHouse bag, and to tell you the truth I will never ever be able to go back to the bag. These cookies were absolutley excellent and whoever said that they didn't spread, spread to much, etc. made the cookies wrong. These cookies were excepllent and I look foward to making them again and again. Thank you for sharing a really good recipe.

I did not like these cookies. They had too many chocolate chips and they were very sweet. They didn't rise very nicely either they were kinda flat and greasy. I have to say they were very nice and soft it is just they were way to sweet for me.

WOW!  These are by far the best choc chip cookies ever!  They were a cinch to make too.  I whipped them up while watching saturday morning cartoons with the kids and they ended up as lunch.  We couldn't stop eating them!  Even hubby, who hates chocolate, nearly made himself sick eating so many.  Forget tollhouse, these rock!

This is a great recipe, although I, too, cut down on the salt.  I think this is the same recipe as the one on the back of the Nestle Toll House Chocolate Chips.  If it's not identicle, the only difference is the brown sugar/granulated sugar ratio!

I was initially disappointed by the recipe. The cookies came out thin and not at all soft and chewy. I froze the remaining batter and baked some of it today. After being frozen, the cookies turned out wonderfully. They were soft, chewy and had a nice texture. I do not think that I would rate them above the standard Toll House recipe, but they were very good.

I have baked a lot of chocolate chip cookies, and this one is our favorite! These cookies combine the perfect balance between soft and crispy.

These are great, chewy cookies.  They are soooo chewy, especially when they first come out of the oven.  I was asked by many people for the recipe.  I only used 1 cup of chocolate chips though.  Try using a melon baller to make perfect shaped cookies!

These cookies truly are the best Chocolate Chip cookies I have ever made or eaten.  They barely lasted one day in my house.  They stayed moist and chewy.  Really a winner!  I plan on making them for the Memorial Day weekend.

I usually use Butter Crisco for chocolate chip cookies instead of butter. This looked like a good one for using butter when I am out of Crisco so I tried it. I liked it - the cookies actually reminded me somewhat of that recipe I use from the from the Butter Crisco package. But I do have to say I like my other recipe better.

After reading all of the excellent reviews of this recipe, I felt like these would be wonderful cookies.  They really are slightly better than the original tollhouse recipe.  Not at all what I expected.  I am mostly dissappointed.

This chocolate chip cookie recipe is the best I've tried.  Better than toll-house and Guittard chocolate chip recipes. They are easy to make and everyone liked them.  They have a great texture and stay soft.

Delicious!  I made these as written except I used half white chocolate and half semi-sweet chips (per the request of my 4 year old assistant). I LOVE this recipe!  Some reviewers suggested not baking at the suggested time and temperature, depending on your baking sheet. I use a darker pan so I lowered the temp and I only baked for around 8 minutes. The cookies came out soft and somewhat chewy in the middle with some crispness - but not too much - around the edges. They were perfect!  I  about to make another batch!

The only changes I made are that I used half and half cake and pastry flour and white, b/c I used what I had and only 1 1/2 cups chocolate chips. These are the best that I fave found on this site and will make again. Simple and great. Thanks for sharing.

Ahhhhhmazing cookies!!!! If you love soft/chewy cookies that rise up beautifully, this is the recipe for you!! I followed recipe as stated. However, I realized I'd forgotten to put brown sugar in so did that right before adding the dry ingredients which I was relieved to find did not mess up the recipe. 
I did make my cookies little bigger than the tablespoon and 8 mins on 375 worked perfect. I lined my cookie pans with aluminum foil and let them cool for few minutes on foil until removing them on parchment paper to finish cooling, as suggested.

These turned out really good. I followed the recipe to the "T".  I've always struggled to make a good looking and good tasting classic chocolate chip cookie.  This will be my go to recipe, when I need to make some classic chocolate chip cookies.  It's a bonus that this recipe shares my name:)

Made these cookies today and they were so delicious. My kids and husband says theses were the best cookies yet. I used 1/2 tsp of salt like the reviews said and it was perfect. Will add some nuts next time!!!

My guests loved the cookies made from your recipe. The only change I think that can make it better is to use 70% of the butter. It was quite buttery but still, it was great!!

This is an amazing recipe. I made the cookies bigger by turning the oven down to 350 and using an ice cream scoop to put them on the cookie sheet and baked it for 15 minutes. Also, I put some sea salt on the top to enhance the flavor. Overall, I love this recipe and it will be my go to chocolate chip recipe.

I made these last night, using the ingredients as listed (although maybe just a bit less salt because I was concerned from other reviews, but wrongly, they were fine).  My change was shaping the cookies with a scoop and then chilling the balls for a couple hours before baking. I made about 28 big, fat cookies. They came out awesome, big and thick, crisp on the outside, soft on the inside. *Maybe* a bit too sweet, and a bit too much chocolate chips (if there's such a thing?), but cookies are a treat for us, they tasted great.  Texture was excellent. I highly suggest chilling dough after shaping so they won't spread much if you like a thick cookie. I think I'd like some peanut butter chips in these. Will try that next time!

I made these and they turned out great but I did go with the Advice of the other bakers that made them before me. A half teaspoon of salt is perfect and baking at 325° is much better to judge the baking golden brown color. Perfect.....cookies everytime! Love them....

These cookies are very tasty! They're soft, chewy and have a toffee taste to them thanks to the brown sugar.

I have tried many chocolate chip cookie recipes.  This one is good for the proportion of dough to chips leaving enough dough to add my own twists (grape nuts, potato chips, khalua, cinnamon and ancho chili powder).  They spread more than other recipes. I think that adding some baking powder would have made for a thicker cookie and seems to have been left out of the ingredients.

Sweet Baby Jesus that is a DELICIOUS cookie!  Lower the temp to 350 and bake for 12 minutes... perfectly crispy edges and gooey center.  DEFINITELY my new go to!  I also used 1 cup semi sweet chips and 1 cup peanut butter chips... WOWZA!  Thanks for the amazing recipe.  PS.. decrease salt to ½ tsp and make sure you use unsalted REAL butter and not margarine. We hope you all enjoy these as much as we do.

This was my 1st time making chocolate chip cookies. It was a hit with my nieces and nephews. I agree with some of the comments the salt was an after taste. I didn't have baking soda so I use 4X the amount of baking powder and it still came out great. Now I have to prefect making them chewy.

My 11 year old daughter wanted cookies and I had the ingredients for these on hand.  It went together very easily with just a bit of help from me, such as teaching her to "cream" the butter and sugar as well as how to drop them on the pan.   They were tasty and easy.

I'm not quite sure what I did wrong...these came out poofy and too sugary so I guess that's where I messed up-no brown sugar on hand so used 2 cups of white sugar...anyways my boyfriend loved them so that's all that mattered??

This is the best cookies. I ran out of brown sugar so I replaced it with more white sugar and molasses. So good, my husband wants them all the time. Making ice cream sandwiches out of them too. Would make a wonderful crust as well.

Excellent cookie with half the butter of other recipes.  I was short 2Tbs of butter so I used margarine.  I also only used 1/2 tsp as others suggested.   They were soft and crunchy.   Would make again.

These are the best classic Chocolate Chip Cookies I have ever made.
I used all Organic ingredients. I did not realize I only had 1 cup of dark chocolate chips and accidentally discovered this is a perfect amount for my husband. *Joy*
I shaped the dough by the teaspoonful into high flat cylinders. Baked at 375 (scary lol) for 10 minutes. They are perfect with this method. Don't change a thing :)

This is a great cookie! Of course I made some additions! I used about 1 1/4 cups chocolate chips, 3/4 cups butterscotch chips and about 3/4 cups walnuts to add some layers of flavor and more crunch with the pillowy texture! I always use 1/2 cup butter and 1/2 cup I Can't Believe Its Not Butter because I like the texture the combination delivers and always chill my dough before baking. One more tip....if you aren't going to eat the whole batch in one day, bake them by the tray so they are real fresh...they really are best that way!

The best way to keep your cookies from spreading in the oven is to warm the pans before you put the cookie dough on them. Works like a charm.

This recipe was great and easy to make! Although reading the comments I adjusted a few things. I did 350 degrees for 10 minutes,1/2 teaspoon of salt, and I put aluminum foil on the pan to keep the cookies moist and easy to take off. I would recommend this addicting recipe to friends, and I will use it again!

I've made this recipe countless times, far more than any other recipe I've worked with, and I'm still never prepared for how effortlessly delicious these bad boys turn out. Instant classic. I do what many others suggest and cut down a little on the salt, but I've never noticed a difference either way. Also bake it for slightly longer than suggested for a better golden brown. I usually use whatever bargain brand ingredients I have laying around, but recently decided to splurge on Ghiradelli chocolate chips and Kerrygold butter - what a difference, didn't think it could get any better! Treat yourself, spend a little extra on bougie ingredients and go to town on this recipe!!

Followed recipe to a t. and while  they are pretty good I was surprised that when I put a decent size of cookie dough the cookie spread out a lot. But I think next time I'll add a bit of baking powder to make them rise a bit. My first batch came out soft and breakable. so the last batches I left them in for a couple of minutes longer so they got crunchy and I liked them a lot more that way.

We absolutely loved this recipe !
FINALLY we found the one to our liking .
I used 1/4 C less of both sugars to equal out the 1/2 C Less that I wanted.
I made them this way the very first time that I tried them, as we were reaching for just a tad less sweetness and VOILA !
We also cooked them @ 325 for 10-11 min as I find that 325 for all my cookie recipes works great !!!! 
 do not hesitate for these cookies because they are the best by far .

I decreased the salt like the others.  I didn't have enough regular flour so I used cake flour.  I reduced the temperature to 425.  My cookies my cookies came out great.  They were so delicious.

This is a great recipe.  No nuts were added due to family preferences.  I was a little leary since in the photo the cookies looked flat.  They were not flat at all, they were crispy on the outside and soft in the center.   Definitely will be using this recipe for now on.

These are the slight adjustments I made based on other reviews: 1/2 tsp salt, used 1/4 c margarine, 1/4 c salted butter, only used 3/4 c packed brown sugar (next time try 1/2 c packed), 1 1/2 tsp vanilla, baked at 325 for 12 min on non stick pan or 14-15 min on cold pizza stone.  Delicious soft chewy cookies!

Thank you for the recipe. I received such good compliments from my spouse and friends. It was so yummy. Can't wait to make it again.

It was slightly sweetish for my taste. Will reduce the sugar next time.

I really enjoyed these cookies! They were soft and creamy, though they were a bit sweet for my taste, but that is subjective. I would definitely recommend trying this recipe out for your next baking function! ;)

Delicious, thick, gooey cookies! This is our "go to" recipe. I use my kitchen aid mixer & make a double batch. When baking, I usually cook for a few extra minutes than the recipe calls for & they turn out perfectly every single time.

These cookies are simply amazing! I got a craving at ten o'clock at night and for once I am glad I caved. The cookies were wonderful! I did make a few changes... I added a cup of peanut butter chips and some sliced almonds along with cutting the salt down.  I would highly recommend these cookies to bakers of all levels!

I was making these with my toddler and we didn't have enough to make the full batch so I halved everything and the dough turned out great!  Of course, I didn't realize until we went to add the chocolate chips that were were completely out!  Epic fail mom!  So, I  added 1/4c of shredded coconut, 1/4c of dried blueberries, 1/4c dried cranberries and a 2Tbs of sliced almonds.  We will definitely come back to remake as per directed as the cookies came out perfectly even when altered. ????

I love this recipe and will likely never use another for chocolate chip cookies.  These always come out soft in the middle (even when I forget that I'm baking and accidentally overcook them!) and don't get hard after a few days sitting on the counter.

This recipe turned out great! I only use 1/2 a teaspoon of salt and always melt the better just a little bit before baking. These cookies are LOVED by everyone in my family and throughout all my friends!! This is a definite must have recipe!

Instead of softened butter, I melted the butter. I also used a mixer to mix the flour and baking soda mixture once I had everything else combined. I added walnuts. They were amazing!!!

My kids will no longer allow me to make any other chocolate chip cookie! They stay soft and chewy for days, with just the right amount of crisp surrounding it all.

They came out really good I had less chocolate chips so I used less of everything but I should've added more flour to make them look crispy I also added half a tsp of ground cinnamon.

I loved these cookies........ The only thing I did differently was when I made the batter it looked a bit to dry so I added a little bit of milk. The first batch that I made I put it in the oven for 20 minutes, but it came out just a little bit burnt. Then I put it in for 15 mins and I let it cool for a while. When I tried it, it was delicious, I think Santa will love them!

Soft, delicious.  I followed another reader's suggestion to bake them a few minutes longer at 325 for soft cookies and it turned out very well.

These were very good. I was looking for a chocolate chip cookie recipe with a good taste and that stayed soft. A lot of times cookies will taste good right out of the oven but then a few days later , they are hard and don't taste the same. These were perfect.

I think this recipe is perfect...depending on your personal preference for cookies. If you like big, soft, chewy cookies, then this recipe is perfect! My husband tends to like crispier cookies, but even he said that these cookies are really good! I cooked them at 350 for about 12-15 minutes and just took them out when they were golden just around the edges and they were perfect even when cooled completely.

First things first:  THANK YOU STACEY, for sharing this wonderful recipe!  Your friends moms recipe is the BEST!

Because I keep away from GMOs, I did use ALL ORGANIC  or NON-GMO ingredients.  I also baked these on 325 for exactly 15 minutes on parchment paper. 

I followed the directions to a T.   I did use a little less salt, but other than that. I did go by the directions.

These were ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS!   I use to love Toll House CCC, and this recipe tastes like it - which is a compliment to Anna!

The recipe was easy to follow and I will be making it again.   Seriously, TRY THESE.  You will not be disappointed.

Lastly, I have say it's wonderful knowing what you are NOT eating, as opposed to what we are eating, when we eat all that plastic, processed food.  Always use organic, when possible.  :-)

Great recipe! I took other people's advice and did 1/2 tsp salt instead of 1 tsp. Also, this is the second time I've made this recipe and I thought the first batch was too cake-y, so I used 2 cups flour instead of 2 1/2 cups. The texture was perfect! 

Just a note, I tried 350 degrees for 12 min as other people suggested (so they wouldn't burn) but they were a little too soft and brittle. Next time I'll use the recipe's temp and time.

Delicious.  Because I didn't have butter and used margarine, these didn't spread out as much as they would have with the butter, and so took a little longer to bake at 375.  This is my new favorite chocolate chip cookie recipe.

Terrible! I don't know what I did wrong because they turned out thick and cakey. The flour dulled out the sweetness of the cookie. I should have went with my gut and decreased the flour by half a cup.

I'm new to the kitchen, and I was craving something sweet that I could share with my family. These were great, and I somehow made 72 cookies using just the original amount of ingredients... So mine were thin and crispy while everyone else's may have been a bit on the thick and chewy side. I used the tiny chocolate chips so I could pack lots of yummy goodness into each cookie. The family loved them! Make sure you use eggs and butter that are at room temperature, and use 1/2 a teaspoon of salt. Loved these! Thanks!

Love this recipe! I changed 2 ingredients. I use unsalted butter and light brown sugar. Just some advice, you use salted butter you don't need to add more salt. I noticed the type of flour I was using didn't make them taste right. I bought Unbleached Flour. Talk about night and day difference!!

I used mini chips and added oatmeal and used only 1/2 tsp salt. They were a hit with the grand kids. The first batch went for 8 minutes and the second batch cooked for 8:30 minutes. I think the second batch turned out more to my liking.

Yummy! These were wonderful! I used all brown sugar because I was out of white sugar, I decreased the salt to 1/2 tsp and decreased oven temp to 325 like others suggested. Baked for about 16 min. Will be my go to recipe!!

This recipe was ok.  The batter was to thin and the cookies were flat.  I usually follow the recipe completely the first time i try a new one.  I did so with this one and i was worried after mixing when i saw the batter.  Mu suspicions were correct.

I love this recipe, I have tried many different ones and this is the best. I like it because it calls for less flour than some of the other ones and the cookies don't seem like cake. I love cake but not when I want the perfect cookie.

I loved these cookies! I have made them a few times! I use only 1/2tsp salt and 1 1/2 tsp vanilla (personal preference) but the recipe is great as is!! The cookies are more cake like but I like them that way!

It's official..... These are the best chocolate chip cookies I've ever made.  My 2 teenagers begged me for another batch immediately after the last cookie disappeared from the cookie jar!

I made this recipe exactly as stated (except I only had a little more than 1/2 tsp salt) and it was fantastic. I baked at 350 degrees for about 12 minutes and they came out amazing.

Great recipe! Easy, fast and delicious.  I made some of the suggested changes: half tsp salt, and baked at 350 for 9 minutes. Another rater mentioned they came out flat, so instead of dropping the dough onto the cookie sheet I rolled a teaspoon amount of dough into balls first. They didn't look "fluffy" and they weren't exactly "flat", but they taste so good I don't think anyone's going to mind how they look!  I also used half chocolate chips, half white chocolate and added some walnuts.  Will definitely be saving this recipe. :)

I had to adjust based on what I had in my cabinets. I used white chocolate chips instead. I was also out of vanilla, so I had to use imitation almond extract. They came out amazing. All of my coworkers loved them. I will be keeping this as a staple recipe. :)

YUM! i was looking for a cookie recipe with a small amount of white sugar and butter (had no car, had to work with what was at the house for my child's birthday) :) I halved this recipe and it made 30 cookies (some were small).  It was a great tasting cookie and the texture was just perfect...don't use cheap chocolate (i use Guittard's bittersweet chips) and you won't be disappointed.  i followed the recipe exactly - just halved it all and it was super great!

These cookies were amazing! I had a late night craving for chocolate chip cookies and these were great, complete satisfied my craving!  This will be my go-to recipe from now on,  I can't wait to try these at Christmas with red and green M&Ms.  I baked for 9 minutes, they were perfect done all the way through but still super soft; I have had a hard time finding a recipe that turns out like that.  I didn't have enough chips but these are so good they would still be great w/o any chocolate chips.

yum! I used large dark chocolate chips, and these came out perfectly, and stayed soft for the 3 days that they lasted! Watch the time though, a couple in my first batch were a little darker than I wanted on the bottoms...

This is a classic chocolate chip cookie. I added a splash more vanilla (probably would use about 2 tsp next time). I also only used a sprinkle of salt (1/2 tsp). They ended up cooking for at least 10 minutes though. They puffed up and didn't flatten out as some other people mentioned. All in all a good cookie if you just want a plain chocolate chip one.

Overall, these were pretty good cookies, but too much salt! I tend to like a lot of salt, but these cookies were far saltier than I like for my sweets. I would cut the salt in half next time.

Me and my girlfriend just finished making these and they turned out great. They rise quite well and are a good and tasty cookie. I likely will be making these again as they turned out great. We turned the oven on to 350 degrees F instead of 375 and worked quite well. They are nice and sweet, very good cookie.

Kids were pleased with the results but I've had better. I chose to reduce the recipe to only make 24 cookies and I think the measurements might have been off a bit. My cookies didn't turn out soft at all. Could be the cook or the oven but we followed directions precisely.

These are the best cookies I've ever made. My husband called them "amazing!". The only thing different I did was bake them at 350 for 13 minutes. They came out nice and fluffy!

These are great cookies. They are very soft. The only bad thing is the chocolate chips melt too much, but other than that they are great. Next time i will follow one of the reviews that tells how to make it more chewy.

I have to agree with other reviewers these did spread quite a bit in the oven, and my eggs and butter were room temperature. Even so they are a good cookie, crispy on the edges and chewy in the centre. Thankyou Stacey.

I usually make the standard recipe on the back of Toll House chips...this recipe makes way better cookies. Nice soft middles with a touch of a crunchy edge. They were gone in no time!! Glad I branched out.

    They turn out perfect every time as long as I follow the directions in the exact order. I do add just bit more baking soda and vanilla though.

PERFECT chocolate chip cookies!  Don't change anything!  I used a small ice cream scoop to shape the cookies - fast, easy, consistent and easy clean up.  Yummy!  Can't stop eating them.  Thank you!

By far the best chocolate chip recipe I have done. The cookies were moist and a little bit crispy on the outside - just the way my family likes them. I will definitely be making these again. One change I made was adding more vanilla extract for more flavor. Other than that the recipe was great!

This is THE toll house cookie recipe.  The sugar variation is a little different.  Toll house cookie uses 3/4 cup of each sugar.  Always a favorite.  Make sure your eggs are at room temperature.  Enjoy!!!!

These are by far the best and easiest chocolate chip cookies I have ever made! I added 1 cup of chopped walnuts as a personal preference, but the recipe is great as it is. I agree with previous reviewers; change the temperature to 350 and bake 10 minutes. Perfectly done!

Just made these tonight and on recommendations here cut the salt by half and baked at 350. Mine took 12 minutes and came out perfectly done. These are the puffiest chocolate chip cookies I have ever baked, definitely not flat, they hardly spread at all from how I put them in. Very good although not exactly what I was expecting. I will definitely make them again!

Great Cookies! I went with some of the recommendations and included walnuts. I was out of vanilla extract and substituted with maple syrup. Delicious.  My husband devoured them in two days.

I love this cookie recipe!  If you like a darker, crispy on the outside and a little chewy on the inside, these are perfect.  I have always made chocolate chip cookies with more brown sugar than white sugar and it gives the cookie a terrific flavor.  I won a contest years ago for my chocolate cookie recipe which was exactly like this one.  One difference is that I mixed the baking soda with a 1/2 tsp. of water to dissolve the powder.  I have find this creates a more even texture.

I did not care for these. They were like cake cookies, too spongy, not moist, but not crunchy either. The temp had to be wrong or the cook time was off.

Pretty Good, I didn't have Brown Sugar so I substituted 1/2 cup Raw Sugar for white. Twas fair enough, came out a little hard but with a dip in thee coffee they were quite good.

Good recipe but was a bit too cakey for me. I think I needed to add more chocolate chips or something. I also added oats to it and it came out even better. Although cakey, a good recipe.

I subsituted most of the sugar for a "splenda" type of sugar (approx 1 1/2 cup) and only put 1/2 cup brown sugar.  I made them for my mom who is diabetic, SHE LOVED THEM!!!

Great recipe.  These turned out perfect!  I have made these several times.  Also great to use as a base to add any kind of nut or chip to!  I have even used caramel bits.

This was a great, easy to make recipe! I made it with my 8-year-old sister, and she enjoyed the simple construction and the wonderful taste!! It was a family favorite; not overly sweet, not to filling, very delicious. :] One note: You get a little more than the promised 48 cookies with this recipe. We ended up with 64... But not too much of a problem. I give it a 5!

These were super good!  Needless to say they didn't last very long.  They were soft and chewy.  I always add an extra tsp of vanilla when I bake. Definitely will make this recipe a keeper

These tasted great...I doubled the vanilla and ended up having to add several tablespoons of extra flour because the cookies turned out rather flat.

Just made these. My husband loves the classic chocolate chip cookie and this sounded like it fit the bill. I love a soft, chewy cookie so baking at 350 degrees will give you that result. Cut back to a half teaspoon on the salt as recommended by other reviews. Also, in place of using just chocolate chips I added in a mix of butterscotch chips, toffee bits and chunks of chocolate. Great result.

The flavor is delicious!  I did lower the amount of choc chips because they looked like enough and lowered the temp a bit.  My only complaint was that they came out really flat!  I looked around on the internet and I think that my dough was too warm, so I'll try chilling it next time.  Delicious!

It has been said before, but this IS the BEST Chocolate Chip Cookies recipe. They have the perfect amount of sweet and a little saltiness to them. My husband said "These are the best C.Chip Cookies I have EVER had in my life ..really honey, they are!" And that is huge here, because he seems to think that he can make everything better. :) Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe. There is NO need to look for anything better, cuz there isn't!

My son is allergic to eggs - I've been workig on different recipes with different substitutes for the egg.  I subbed 6tbl of prepared plain gelatin (1/4 oz gelatin + 1cup boiling water) - and it works wonderfully.  This is my new chocolate chip cookie recipe, I'm done experimenting.

These were delicious! I usually make the Nestle Toll House recipe, but today I decided it was time to try something different. My Nestle Toll House ones were always hard as soon as they cooled. 4 hours later and these ones are still soft, that's a plus!! But I also only used 1/2 teaspoon of salt and I also substituted margarine for butter and they still came out amazing. They smell delicious and I am craving another one!

The flavor in these cookies is good, but not the best. I substituted margarine for the butter that I didn't have (about 3/4 cup margarine). I got a very cake-like cookie. I much prefer chewier cookies over the cake-like texture. I will try this again with butter to see if I get a better texture, but I doubt it will replace my current go-to recipe for chocolate chip cookies.

These smell SO good! I used baking powder and still they worked out fine. I also reduced the sugar to 1 cup: 1/3 cup white sugar and 2/3 cup packed dark brown sugar. I also used about 1/4 tsp salt. YumYumYum.

These cookies are delicious. I am making them for the second time now and I can't wait to take them out of the oven. I also used 1/2tsp. of salt and I also substituted a 1/4c. butter for shortening, which I think makes them stay chewy a little longer. yumm!

I was pretty dissapointed because mine turned out too cakey. They were good just not gooey enough for my liking. I believe you should not use so much flour and maybe more white sugar.Good recipe though if you like the cakier cookies!

Usually my cookies come out too thin, so I was pleasantly surprised when these cookies puffed up nicely. They didn't really taste like chocolate chip cookies, though...they were kind of cake-like.

The first time I used this recipe, I did not have real butter on hand so I used margarine and they came out very dry and didn't keep well overnight. The next time I used real butter and they were much better. A great recipe overall!

Really easy to make.  I baked the cookies on convection at 325, as I always overbake cookies.  They took a little longer, but came out nice and chewy...just like we like them!

4 1/2 stars actually.  I baked at 350 degrees for 12-14 minutes so the cookies wouldn't be too dry, the rest was all as the recipe stated.  The reason for the 4 1/2 stars is I once made a recipe which called for butter-flavored Crisco instead of butter (Geez, I need to find that recipe back).  Now those were absolute perfection by which I now rate all cookies going forward.

This is my new favorite chocolate chip cookie recipe. My only change was to bake them at 350 instead of 375. I baked them for about 7-8 minutes and then left them on the cookie sheet for another 10 minutes. This resulted in very soft and gooey cookies- just the way my hubby and I like them! Thank you!

Very Good recipe. I had no experience with cookies baking and followed exactly on the recipe and instruction. The result was really good. My boyfriend brought the cookies to office and offered to the colleagues and everyone thought the cookies were from SUBWAY.

These are pretty good, much better than the last recipe that I tried.  I didn't follow the recipe exactly as written as i didn't have all of the ingredients.  I will give these another try.

I just finished making these cookies and this recipe has become one of my new favorites for chocolate chip cookies.  I followed the recipe as written and they turned out perfectly.  I formed the dough into teaspoon size and the cookies are puffy and moist in the middle.  My husband and kids LOVE them, I will definetly be using this recipe again, since I don't think that they'll last very long around here!  Thanks for the great recipe!!!

As previously suggested by other posters, I:   1. baked the cookies at 325F and not 375F  2. did not add the full amount of salt (add half the amount called for in the recipe).   3. In addition, I added a little more brown sugar (1/2 teaspoon more and almost twice the amount of vanilia extract called for  4. I baked the cookies until they were golden brown around the edges.    Not bad.   I bake with a dark/nonstick pan which seems to heat things faster than a regular pan so putting it at 375F I knew would not do. If Indycook didn't suggest putting it at 325F, I would have passed this recipe by.  This is why, I'm giving this 3 stars because if I had followed this to the letter, I would of ended up with salty hard cookies.

Tried these today and husband loved them.  So easy to make and very yummy indeed.  Will probably use this in our family cookbook that I'm trying to put together for a family reunion.

I should not have made these....now I can't stop eating them! Made them just as recipe says, but used a 1/2 tsp salt, as someone had suggested and melted the butter as someone also suggested. Baked them at 325 for 10 min and they turned out really great - a chewy, somewhat cake-like texture for those of us that like them that way. I added little mini M&M's to mine instead of chocolate chips. Yummm!

This is by far the best chocolate chip cookie recipe I've ever tried. The only change I made was to use 2 tsp of vanilla. Perfect! I had four other recipes for chocolate chip cookies in my recipe binder, and after I made these I threw them all away. This is my new go-to cookie recipe!

these were delicious!! big hit with the whole family. I added some peanut butter chips to some... that was good too. I greased the pan so the cookies spread out really well and were perfect. A little crispy on the edges and soft in the middle. Perfect for dunking in milk :o) I will definitely be making them again and again. mmm...

super yummy cookies.
I didn't have enough butter on hand so I replaced it with shortening. It worked out fine. Added in some chopped pecans. My boyfriend looooooved the cookies and thought they were the best that I've baked. Thanks for sharing your recipe!

These are delicious! I made mine with margarine and added  1/2 teaspoon cinnamon. I baked them at 350 degrees between 10 and 11 minutes. Very good! I will definitely make them again.

I've made alot of chocolate chip cookies but these cookies are AWESOME.  They have a wonderful, fluffy texture.  My daughter made these cookies for her class and loved them!

Wonderful, Wonderful, WONDERFUL! I used white chocolate and milk chocolate chips for lots of flavour. These cookies need to be baked until they are golden to dark brown so that they stay together as they flatten out quite a bit.

These are the best cookies I've ever made and eaten. They are fat and fluffy. Iv'e been making chocolate chip cookies since I was a little girl and these are the best ever. I make them every Sunday for people at church, because every Sunday they keep asking me to make more for the next Sunday. Everyone loves these cookies. Try them, you won't be disappointed.

These come out of the oven super soft! They're very cake-like.

Like several other reviewers, I'd recommend baking at 350 instead of 375; I find they cook too quickly on the outside otherwise.

These were the best chocolate chip cookies I've ever made. The consistency was just right and I probably ate half the dough! I also used only 1/2 tsp of salt, and it turned out perfectly! Yum!

This recipe is great - i used a cup of butter flavored crisco and 6 teaspoons of water in place of the butter... i also lowered my oven to 350 and baked for 10 minutes.

Love it! I bake all the time and have tried plenty of chocolate chip cookie recipes, but this one is truly the best. I took the advice from one of the reviews to lower the temp. and cook a little longer and it made the cookies that much better. I also baked them in a cupcake pan so that every cookie turned out perfect and the edges weren't all crusty.

These cookie are great.  I only use 1 1/2 sticks of butter,don't pack my brown sugar, and also don't put quite a 1/2 cup of white sugar so they aren't as sweet and trust me they are still plenty sweet. We like fuller cookies so I take an ice cream scoop and a glass of HOT water and dip the scoop in the water before each use. They come out great each and every time.

I read all the reviews and was very careful what to do and what NOT to do. 
The dough was too sticky and cannot be dropped nor hand-rolled.  Even after chill, the cookies spread out too much and were TOO SWEET.  After chilling for abt 45-60 mins, they turn out much better.

Excellent! As always, I chilled my dough for an hour in the fridge (or 1/2 hr in the freezer). The got a LITTLE flatter than I like (I like mine puffy). So next time I may add just an extra 1/4-1/2c flour. A great cookie!!!
And the dough is sooooo good too!

These cookies were delicious. The only thing was that I used margarine instead of butter because i didn't have any. Don't know if it makes a difference. My husband loved them and wouldn't let me take some to share with my co-workers!! He actually took some to work and everyone loved them. Thank you soo much for such a great recipe. Great soft cookies!!!

What a great recipe! I followed it to a "t" and the cookies came out perfect! The only thing I did, not metioned was I cooled the batter for about 30 mins before baking and chilled my cookie trays before putting another batch on them. Soo tasty, we've already eaten a dozen and the last few are still waiting to be baked! Hee hee! Will use this one again and again. Single and tasty, what a great recipe should be.

Excellent!  I picked this recipe because I wanted minimal, REAL ingredients (unlike a lot of recipes on this site which call for fake ingredients like crisco and vanilla pudding mix.)  They were simple to make and very tasty.  I did, as several reviewers suggested, reduce the salt by 1/2 tsp and I left out about 1/2 cup of the flour called for.  They turned out perfect!

I always get requests for this recipe! Instead of 2 cups of semi-sweet chocolate chips, I take 1 cup of milk chocolate, 1/2 cup of dark chocolate and 1/2 cup of white chocolate and coarsely chop it myself. I also cook it for 8 minutes only (until they hold their shape but are not brown) and put them on a cooling rack.

These cookies were very, very good.  I altered it a little by adding baking powder along with the baking soda.  They are a little denser cookie but very soft and moist!!!  I will use this recipe again!!

This is the same recipe (minus 1/2 tsp salt) as the recipe I use and I love it!  I got it from a friend while we were missionaries in Romania.  We use a whole bag of chocolate chip cookies and everyone raves about the cookies.

Good recipe.  I used white and regular chocolate chips.  I also used cake flour and increased the amount to 3 cups.

Absolutely amazing recipe.  I made these last night, and they are the best chocolate chip cookies I've ever had.  I've brought them to work today and everyone is raving over them!  They are very soft and moist.  The only change I made was using chocolate chunks instead of chips. Thanks so much!!!

Good cookies, but definitly too salty.  Next time, I'll take the advise of other reviewers and cut the amount of salt in half.

i was very impressed with the number of good ratings this recipe had....But I was very disappointed when i tried this recipe myself. Personally, this recipe calls for too much sugar, which made it too sweet. The cookies also turned out stiff, not soft like some of the other chocolate chip cookies recipe I've tried. This was NOT one of the GOOD chocolate chip cookies recipes on this site.

These are so moist and yummy.  My husband eats up one batch and immediately asks me to make another.  Very, very good.  Didn't change a thing but did try with 1/2 choc chips and 1/2 peanut butter chips.  That is good too.

This recipe is really very good. The only thing i did wrong was bake it too long, so when they cooled they were a little too hard and i put less butter, but other thatn cooking it too long it was a great recipe!!

These turned out good. I think they were a little flat, but very good with a cold cup of milk.
I plan to make some choc chip ice cream sandwiches with these. Sandwich ice cream in the middle of two cookies and then wrap with foil and freeze. Very good on a hot summers day.

I love these cookies.  So does my best friend.  She thinks they are the best chocolate chip cookies, and I have to make them for her at Christmas every year.  The only thing I do different, I use milk chocolate chips instead of semi-sweet.

I have been trying to bake chocolate chip cookies for as long as I could remember and every time I did they came out flatter than pancakes, this is the best recipe I have found for these types of cookies. Thank you so much, my family will enjoy them.

Excellent recipe, everyone loved it, never got any complaints. The cookies come out soft and great tasting. They even taste better the next day! I make my cookies kind of small, so i do get 4 dozen. I also use margarine, the imperial cubes, and they turn out perfect. 
Thanks Stacey for the recipe :D

i have made many chocolate chip cookies, and no recipe can compare to this one.  an entire dorm floor begs for more.

i only get between one and two dozen cookies out of the recipe.  if you need lots, you might want to double it... my cookies are extra big, but no matter how small you made them, i can't imagine getting 48 like the recipe claims.

be careful not to overcook!  the best part of this recipe is how gooey the cookies are.

I made these for the first time and my 6 year old grandson was so impressed he told my daughter how good they were and that the chocolate chips melted.  I found this cookie to be soft in texture and tasty.  I use unsalted butter only when I bake and you can tell the difference.  I was surprised at the so so reviews.  Perhaps they bake differently according to the weather, humidity and altitude.  We liked them very much.

I was disappointed in this recipe.  I have had many better chocolate chip cookies.  I followed the recipe exactly and the cookies turned out very dry, hardened quickly (weren't very chewy the next day), and were not even that flavorful.  Guess I have to keep on looking for the perfect recipe!

Not as flavorful as I would have hoped...a bit cakey (maybe too much flour?).  However, the ratio of chips to cookie was high which made up for the lack of flavor and consistency.  Will most likely try another recipe.

i was rather disappointed cos i expected more after reading the reviews.cripsy on the outside soft on the inside but i found it abit too soft and too buttery/greasy for my personal liking.may make them again though for my mother loves them as they arent dry, but i'll probably use less butter next time.i scooped teaspoonfuls of the batter because it flattens out a lot and keeping it in the refrigerator does help to control the shape of the cookies.was uncertain about when to remove them from the oven as they seemed to be soft forever but it does harden after some cooling on the wire racks.took more than ten minutes to bake though.have a cant-stop eating quality so not the best but worth a try!

I made these cookies because my name is Anna. They turned out great- I made about 50 of them for a party and the plate was empty startlingly soon! I'm still searching for a recipe that makes slightly less cakey cookies, but this is my favorite so far. I prefer it to the Award Winning recipe w/ pudding.

These cookies were very fluffy. I used atleast one extra cup of flour just to get them so they weren't sticky, so I could put them on a pan. Taste was great though!

Great Recipe. i have made these cookies on numerous occasions, each time a success with my children. For a more grown up taste, i have substitued the vanilla extract with Almond Essence which still makes the cookies taste awesome!

These are absolutely the best chocolate chip cookies I've made, the only thing I did different, as I'm not a huge chocolate fan, is I only added 1 1/2 cups chocolate chips but it was just for personal taste.

The absolute best!  I use milk chocolate chips and often add toffee chips or peanut butter chips.  The best basic chocolate chip cookie recipe I've found.

I've made this recipe at least six times, and I love it.  I had a different recipe that had a range of flour (e.g. 1-2 cups) and I ALWAYS screwed it up.  This one comes out perfectly every time.  (Those of you with flat cookies... are you sure you measured right?  I used to get that with too little flour in my other recipe.)

The last time my boyfriend measured the chocolate chips out, and he didn't bother about being too exact so it ended up being about an extra quarter cup.  Doing so makes it close to a chocolate overdose, but still quite yummy.  (But perfectly wonderful with the 2-cups called for.)

Also try substituting a quarter cup or so of caramel chips for a change sometimes.

Thanks Stacey!

LOVE this recipe.  It is EXACTLY what I was looking for in a chocolate chip cookie.  Dense and chewy. Bready, but not dry.  I will make these again and again.  Goodbye waistline.  I have taken MANY recipes from this site.  This is the first time I have been so inspired as to rate one. Thank You Anna and ofcourse Stacy!

These are good cookies. My husband loved them! I tried to make them on a regular cookie sheet and wasnt too impressed but then i cooked them in heart shaped "cupcake" pans and I loved them. They were thicker and moister.

*drool*! These are the best, no buts about it! If you're using an older cookie sheet though, I suggest greasing it up cause these babies'll stick. These are perfect, a little on the cakey side though... probably cause I used self rising flour and no salt and baking soda, which I suggest you follow the recipe... but these are awesome - a must kids, a must not for those avoiding putting on weight, cause you can't stop at just one!

I was looking forward to enjoying these '*****' cookies but must admit I was a little disappointed.  They were not the best cookies I've had by any means - I baked them at 350 and used 1/2 tsp of salt as others suggested but I thought they were just okay!

These turned out excellent.  I made them for some friends and they totally gobbled them up.  I did use 1/2 tsp of salt and bake them at 350 as some have recommended, and they came out perfect.  Nice and soft and fluffy.  Will definitely make them again.

I did not enjoy this recipe.  It was very easy to make but I found all i tasted was sugar.  Way to much sugar for my liking.  My 4 year old even said "mommy there is a lot of sugar in this"
Sorry

I followed this recipe to a T and it was great, but my friends and I tasted a bit of a nutty flavour (in some of the cookies more so than others). I thought this was odd and wondered if anyone knew why.

I found this recipe to be so easy and so good.  I always thought my recipe was great, but this recipe surpasses.  My grandson asked me for the recipe so his Mom could make them for him!  Thanks for sharing, Stacey.  This is now "my" recipe.  Sandie47

This recipe was incredibly easy and delicious. They were soft, chewy and moist - in short, all the things a cookie should be. I've tried other recipes before, but this is definitely the one I'm going to stick with. It was incredible!! :-D

wow~ what yummy cookies! living at high altitude makes it difficult for cookies to be soft & moist. I didn't have any chocolate chips and very little butter so, I divided the recipe in half and added a tablespoon of peanut butter and I have never had such yummy gooey cookies!!!!!!

excellent recipe. it was exactly what i was looking for, a cake like cookie. made them with mini hershey kisses, m&ms and chocolate caramels instead of chocolate chips, and it worked great... not too chocolatey. everyone who's tried them has absolutely loved them, this is definately the best chocolate chip cookie recipe ive tried

This recipe was great!  I did substitute the "semi-sweet" for milk chocolate chips which I must confess made the cookies that much richer.  I think next time I use it I will cut back the chips a little bit if I do milk chocolate chips again.  This recipe was pretty simple and quick.  To put in perspective I made over 6 dozen in less than 2 hrs including prep, mixing, and baking.  I will be using this recipe again, and again.

This was a very good cookie. I have been baking for many years and this is I have to say the best chocolate chip cookie I have every made. The review on this recipe who says she is stuck in the twilight zone should try baking this cookie again and follow the recipe more closely this time for there was nothing wrong with this recipe. Very good cookie

Absolutely perfect! This was exactly the kind of recipe I was looking for. Not too soft, not too dry, delicious and easy. I used margarine instead of butter, and it worked well.

The cookies were very good, a little on the rich side, 2 cookies a serving is definatly enough. Since the recipe calls for two sticks of butter make sure that the butter has been softened. I didn't and it was as hard as a rock.

These were easy to make and yummy-my batch made 2 dozen and they were gone in less than 24 hours :)
 My 20 month old little boy liked the chocolate bits in them and ate round the cookie part though!

These cookies spread a lot and seem very greasy, which is okay sometimes but I prefer to subsitute vegetable shortening for half of the butter.

I liked these cookies, but from most of the reviews I was expecting a more cake-like cookie. It was less greasy than the regular toll house recipie, I was just afraid to add more flour because I didn't want a flour taste to them.

This is a very quick and easy recipe to follow.  Although it had a good taste, it was too doughy in the middle.  They rise beautifully and stay that way, but the middle is too much to swallow!

These cookies were fabulous!  Definitely the best I have ever made.  I agree with a couple of other reviewers who thought that there were too many chocolate chips (next time I will use only 1 cup as opposed to 2 cups).  Besides that, they are wonderful!

This was a great recipe for chocolate chip cookies. I even added some pecans and large chocolate chips and achieved perfect results. At last a recipe that makes soft, sweet cookies. The only suggestion I have is for those cooking with electric ovens allow about three minutes more for baking time. Other than that, great recipe. Will definitely try again.

I wasted my chocolate chips on this recipe. My sister is laughing at me right now because of these "award winning" cookies. They were cakey and not sweet enough. The cookie dough looked really good, then i had them dropped by Tablespoonfuls on the cookie sheet and baked them. I opened the oven door and expected to see cookies. Instead I saw the spoon-shaped dough I put in the oven. Yes my oven was on and I followed this recipe exactly and I bake all the time. I am not sure where these rave reviews came from.

I'm 14 so I don't have a lot of experiance making cookies. But I love this recipe I have made it 3 times already, The first time I only got to eat one because all my parents friends ate them all, and Rod our neighbor aksed me to make a batch just for him, the other time, I mad them the day before my friends came over and by the time they left all the cookies were gone Great recipe all around, but it takes me a little while to make them :)

These cookies are wonderful!!! By far the best chocolate chip cookies I've ever had. They were really easy to make and didn't take long at all. My hand mixer died halfway through the recipe (it's 30 years old- it's not because of the recipe, just because of the age! :) and I was forced to mix by hand. It wasn't that difficult to do, either! I'll definitely use this recipe again! :)

The cookies were wonderful.  Not one person didn't compliment them.  The best part was they stayed soft until they were all eaten.  Whick didn't take more then a day.

I made these for a friends birthday and they were a hit.  I did add an extra quarter cup of white sugar the second time making them.  Quite easy.

They're good. A basic chocolate chip cookie recipe. In my opinion, however, they use way too many chocolate chips.

I tried this recipe and was so pleased. I was tired of the cholate chip cookies that make you feel sick after one or two because they are too greasy or too sweet; and just too rich. This cookie was fabulous and had the right amount of salt. I'll definitely use it again!!

With kids around the house all the time, you can never have enough biscuts which tend to be very expensive. Its so nice to find a recipe that is quick and easy that takes next to no time to prepare or bake, a real life saver and money saver! Thanks.

I compared this recipe to the Toll House one and there are some differences. More flour, and the sugar/granulated sugar ratio is different. I thought these cookies were cakier than Toll House. I loved them.

These were very good: crispy on the edges and soft in the middle.  My husband loved them and they kept well.  I did increase the butter by a couple of tablespoons to get a crispier edge.  My eight month old also enjoyed some non chocolate chip pieces of Daddy's cookies!

Mmmm Mmmmm Good! These are th best cookies I have baked in my life! There was a slight problem but I just thught I would add some milk.. about a qtr of a cup and it worked the dryness out! The cookies were delicious, and not dry. Outsides were crispy and insides were good cuz of the melted chocolate chips and it was tender.. delcious!

I added my standard 1/2 cup or so of vanilla yogurt as I do to any sweet batter. I added one egg minus the yolk and for the other egg I used egg substitue. I suggest flattening out each slunk of dough w/ your hand and then placing it on the cooking sheet for they won't spread out if you don't. The flavor was excellent! Perfect sweetness!

These are great --especially if you like your cookies a little cake-y. I put 1/2 chips 1/2 M&Ms in mine which was fun and made them colorful.

Good cookie, your basic, everyday chocolate chip cookie.  People like how they are kind of, 'cakey'.  Very easy to make.

These cookies are excellent!  I brought them to work and they were a huge hit.  Everyone thought they were like 'Soft Batch', but better!  Remember to bring the recipe where ever you bring these cookies, everyone will want it.

Love it, love it, love it! It was soooo easy to make, and came out delicious! (It was the first 
'from scratch' cookie recipe I have ever made!) It
came out much better than I expected! I think on Monday I may take some to school for my friends! I recommend this recipe to anyone, even to someone
like me who has never even made cookies before!

Pretty good cookie but next time I make them I will try using half of the salt. I thought they were a bit on the salty side.

This is an excellent recipie, a hit with my 4 kids, husband and my mother.  I found it easier to chill the dough for about an hour.  I then rolled the dough into balls and pressed with a fork.  I got 36 cookies from this recipie.  Thanks for the recipie Anna it's a hit.

I thought these cookies were nice and soft but they were more cakey than chewy. I thought the salt in the recipe made the cookie dough taste too salty.  They were still good but I've had better.

YUMMY! I like to roll the dough in balls and freeze.  Now I can bake as many as I like, much better than the store bought dough logs, plus when baking frozen dough the cookies don't spread as much and turn out much softer.

My husband loves cookies, especially chocolate chip.  Instead of all chocolate, I added 1 cup choc. and 1 cup peanut butter chips.  He loved it and so did the neighborhood kids.  Thanks!
