This is a really good base recipe that can be made great!  I cooked the rice in 1 cup organic, free range, low sodium chicken broth and 1 cup light coconut milk.  I used canned corn and added some finely diced red pepper.  I thought 3 shallots was a bit much, I used only one large one and served it with herb and garlic marinated grilled chicken cutlets.  This made way more than 5 servings!  I think this would be a great way to make couscous.  You could even add cooked chicken or tofu to the mixture and serve it as a main course.  Might be nice to sprinkle a little fresh lemon juice over the top just before serving as well.  Thanks for a great base recipe!

Even though this recipe looks like it might taste bland, the peppermint adds an unexpected subtle flavor that makes it taste anything but bland.

yummy! I always make short grain sticky rice, but i needed a change for an indian dish. This was very tastey! I didn't use any mint, however, because that just didn't sound appealing to me AT ALL. I used frozen corn because we had in in the freezer. Yum!

I always use Jasmine rice for every rice dish. This is very fresh tasting and tasty. I'm a Personal Chef and I make it for my clients.

I sauteed red onion until soft (instead of shallots because that's what I had on hand), added the corn and sauteed for another minute then added rice & water and cooked all together.  The starch from the corn gave a creaminess to the rice when cooked together.  A real comfort food, yum!

This recipe was great.  I did not add butter to the rice and it was great.  I also cooked the rice in low-sodium chicken broth for more flavor.  Cut shallots to two and did ot add any sugar, salt or mint.  I did add parsley and added finely chopped and sauteed red and green papper with the corn.  My husband and I loved it.

This was a quick and easy side dish.  I used brown rice instead of white and since I don't care for mint in savory dishes, I used fresh parsley instead.  I also added some garlic.  Thanks so much for the recipe!

I have to give 4 stars instead of 5 only because I didn't follow all of the recipe. I like to use what I have on hand, so I used a can of mexicorn instead of fresh corn, onion powder instead of shallots, and I didn't use any mint. But my family really enjoyed it so I will make it again the same way, since I usually have those ingredients on hand.  However, I will probably decrease the butter just a tad.

This is a delightful side with seemingly unrelated ingredients.  Both my husband and 10-year-old loved it!  I think this would work well served warm OR cold.

I like corn, and I like rice... so I've made a couple of these corn/rice recipes and they've all been good.  This one, like the others, proves to be delicious.  Will not use as many shallots next time, though, or will chop them finely.

Loved the mint in this... Loved the shallots.  I'm thinking of adding garlic next time or, maybe, saffron.  Very good!

Perfect accompaniment to the salmon cakes I made for dinner. I made my rice in a rice cooker to make it easier on me- Just the rice, water, and a bit of margarine to keep it a little loose (I can't cook rice in a pot, it always burns down! I'm a very distracted cook). I used canned corn for lack of fresh and so used half creamed corn, half 'peaches 'n' cream' niblets. Substituted a small yellow onion for the shallots and used mint that was previously frozen, though I had less than the recipe called for and cooked it along with the other stuff in the pan. After tossing the corn mixture with the rice, I squeezed half a lemon over it and mixed it again. The acidity cuts the sweetness and evens out the dish.

OK this recipe sounds soo weird.  Mint?  But as the ONLY food I had in my house tonight was rice and (frozen) corn, I tried it.  Very, very good!  I was skeptical of the mint, but decided to try it since I'm fond of experientation in the kitchen.  It was a good move.  The frozen corn worked fine, although fresh would be better.  And I used dried minced onion since I was even out of onions (and our small podunk grocery store has never heard of a shallot.  )

Simple and delicious.  I would have never thought to mix the starches of rice and corn together - but it works.  Served this with "Orange Ginger Pork Roast" from this site and everyone enjoyed their dinner.  It reheated nicely for lunch the next day.

Yummy, I used leftover basmati rice that was in the fridge, and  Trader Joe's frozen roasted corn which was what I had on hand. I cut the recipe down for 1 person. The mint really makes it unique and delicious. Who'd have thought? Thanks!

Simple and tasty - a good side dish for something spicy because the mint has a cooling effect.

Seriously. Yum. If you like rice, mint and corn - this recipe is for you. Seems like an odd combo, but it turns out fab. I had some simple syrup on hand (1 part sugar, 2 parts water - boiled), so I used that in lieu of the plain sugar. Added some nice moistness to the corn mixture. 

Other than that, followed this to a T. Great with some blackened fish and mojitos!

Used regular fast cooking rice and added cilantro and lime/lime juice. Left out the mint since I used the cilantro instead. Reduced shallots because I didn't have that much and used frozen roasted corn from Trader Joe's. Delicious hot or cold. In fact, my daughter is taking some for her lunch today.

Basmati rice has been a staple in our house for many years, annd I have been making fried corn for a while, so when I saw this recipe, I had to try it.  It was great.  It goes great with grilled chicken and steamed veggies.  I will be making this again!

I really enjoy this easy, refreshing recipe.  I've made it twice now- I add a lot more than 2 tbs of mint, and use a can of corn, plus put ground black pepper in the oil as it heats.  Delish!

Very unique. I didn't have fresh mint, so I used loose-leaf dried spearmint leaves made for tea (not the instant bagged stuff). I really like this combination of ingredients. I added just a bit of garam masala to the rice to give it an additional exotic zing. I think a sprinkle of lime juice would be nice as well.

This was pretty good although nothing special. Next time I think I'll add more mint as i couldn;t really taste it.

This was great served with chicken. The mint really adds to this dish.

Very novel and tasty change from just plain steamed rice. I did deviate a bit from the recipe, in that I used parsley instead of mint, spring onion instead of shallot and added frozen green peas because hubby loves them. Also cooked the rice in pork stock that I had sitting in fridge. this dish went divinely with the roast pork and greens that we had that night.Mmmm, will certainly make it again and maybe add pimiento and chili to spice it up.

I used the chicken broth instead of water (had to add like an extra half a cup because of the rice that I used) and it was a huge hit! I actually got lucky with this recipe because I had all ingredients on hand but I did use white long grain rice. Even had the fresh kernels that I had frozen from the August harvest(I LOVE fresh corn!). This recipe is perfect. I skipped the mint and everyone loved it and it didn't last very long on the table. I served this with tacos and they went really well together. Definitely one of my new favorite recipes!! I may try it with cilantro next time...

This was delicious!  I used three ears of leftover corn. Didn't have shallots, so I used one large clove of garlic and about one cup chopped sweet onion.  I sauteed them and then added the pre-cooked corn at the end. The fresh mint adds a different touch, making this a nice change from ordinary corn and/or rice. Thank you for the recipe!

this just tasted weird to me and bf agreed but said "weird in a good way".. i DID use dried mint so maybe that's why but i didn't think it was going to make that much of a difference.. this tasted "floral" to me.. splitting the difference, i'm giving it a 3 until i can get a hold of some fresh mint
