I did tweak this recipe a little;instead of the canned milk, I used leftover gravy and it was great. The best turkey pot pie I have ever made!!

I feel like the next Marie Callender! The crust was unbelievably tasty (which seems bizarre with such few ingredients), however I had to make a bit more than the recipe called for in order for it to cover the whole pan. I used butter instead of shortening (mostly because shortening reminds me of some sort of callus cream) and left out the sage because I didn't have any. SCRUMPTIOUS!

I had trouble with the crust but not due to the recipe, I'm not a natural born baker. But I will use butter next time. I also used left over gravy rather than the milk.  I used what veggies I had on hand. Tip: If the pie pan you're using is the same size as a throw-away pie pan, cut out the center  and then just lay it on top of the pie to protect the edges. When you're done just save it for future pies.

This turned out very well. I followed the recipie,  with exception on the crust, used 1/2 butter flavored Crisco shortning and 1/2 real butter. I made 1 small mistake by adding uncooked potato,(2 small yellows cut up) Long Story. But, they cooked ok, but sucked some liquid from the sauce..so the pie filling as it sat thickened. But Flavor was VERY good, Crust was perfect. My two pictures show the completed pie & another with the slice cut out. The sauce was thick and perfect at first cut, but as it cooled it thickened. So to finish the left overs I will be making a separate sauce batch to add to it.  Very Good. My veggies added were Potato, carrots, peas, celery.

My hubby's comment was, "WOW!  If chicken pot pie always tasted like this I wouldn't dread it being on the menu!  I'd look forward to it!"  Guess this is my new go-to pot-pie recipe.  I did everything the same except I used chicken instead of turkey and I added a generous handful of frozen pearl onions.  YUM!  I want to make it again this week!

Really great! I "cheated" and used pre-made pastry crust, but the filling was fantastic.  I used frozen vegies and sauteed them in butter with garlic, onions, and mushrooms, to which I also added rosemary.  Delicious!!!

First attempt at a home made pot pie, and man did they get into it! We wanted to try something different and not an everyday dinner so I made this! Two, with chicken instead of turkey, and man the crust was perfect. I steamed a few different frozen veggies of our pick, just before tender, then added them to the recipe when called. Everyone that ate it is still been commenting about it (especially the crust), I made for a dinner on Martin Luther King Jr day, and a little gathering at work for the second pie. I will be making this again and have a feeling it will be pretty soon...Thanks so much for the scrumptious recipe!!

OMG!!  I don't care what anyone says about the recipe...it was awesome.  I started out by doubling the recipe and for the first time ever, there were no left overs.  It tates soooo good.

This is a great recipe.  Instead of canned vegetables, I used cooked carrots, celery, potatoes and peas.  Also, I did not have evaporated milk on hand, so I used regular milk instead.   The dough was very easy to work with and I was able to use the recipe as is to line the top and bottom of a rectangular baking dish.  My husband ate half of this pie all by himself!  Will definitely make this again.  Thanks!

This was very good indeed....  I bought the pie crust. However, I steamed onions, potatoes, carrots and broccoli instead of the veg all. I added fresh corn and frozen peas. It was great. I made it for my son that was here from out of town and he loved it. He has requested it again while he is here for christmas. Thanks for the great recipe

My whole family LOVED this recipe! I made a couple of minor adjustments... I didn't have any evaporated milk, so in its place I used a cup of leftover turkey gravy from Thanksgiving. Also, I used frozen veggies cooked in the microwave. Other than these changes, I followed the recipe exactly. The crust was awesome and baked up nice and flaky.

This is for the crust only.  The shortening taste is overpowering.  I don't normally make crusts with shortening - always use butter, but I thought what the heck.  I had just made 2 pie crusts with shortening (different recipe) for pecan pies just 4 days earlier with the same shortening I used for the crust to this pot pie.  I normally use another pie crust recipe but decided to give this one a shot since the other ones came out so well without the butter.  I won't be making this crust ever again.

This pot pie was my first attempt at homemade and it turned out great! I had a boxed crust mix that needed to be used up, so I used that instead of making my own and it turned out just fine. I also used thawed frozen mixed veggies instead of canned. This had tons of flavor, not too salty. It was perfect! Thanks for sharing! =)

Definitely will make again, but I did tweak it a bit.  I used 1/3  butter and 2/3 margarine for crust.  I used half milk and half cream instead of evaporated milk, I used a variety of fresh vegetables instead of canned veggies, and lastly I used savory spice instead of regular sage.  Most the substitutions is what I had available to me, but came out wonderfully.

The crust was not big enough to cover both top and bottom. You need to double the recipe given if you want a top and bottom crust. I also did not like this crust. I would have added butter to this - an all shortening crust is just not good.  As for the taste of the actual filling - it left something to be desired. I'm not sure why there are so many rave reviews of this. Maybe people have never tasted a good pot pie before. This was not a good filling. There was not enough liquid with all the vegetables and the turkey. It was very dry.  I would not make this again.

The crust was very flaky and fairly easy to work with, but to make a two crust pie from the amounts given, had to roll it verrrry thin.  Would increase the crust ingredients next time to have a little more dough to work with.  Also chilled the crust in the fridge to let the dough rest while making the sauce, then rolled out.  We sauteed a diced small onion and a clove of garlic in the butter before adding the flour, then used half-and-half and water to make the sauce, which still tasted really good.  After the sauce came together, we added the turkey and frozen mixed veggies, letting it simmer for about 10 mins with a lid on to cook up the veggies before putting in a crust and into the oven. Made a nice dinner, but took a little time to get everything together and done.  Would probably double the sauce next time, as we felt it was a little dry.

This recipe was amazing and resulted in the pie pan being licked clean!  I will admit to changing a few things but the sauce - which is the heart and soul of this pie - was perfect.  First, I used a pre-made crust because I didn't have time to make one from scratch.  In our house we can't stand canned or frozen veggies so I diced onion and celery and shredded a carrot.  I sauteed the veggies in a bit of EVOO.  Instead of rubbed sage I added about a tbspn of fresh chopped sage and a tbspn of fresh chopped thyme to the veggie mixture after I turned the heat off.  I followed the sauce exactly and then combined everything and dumped it into the crust.  The cooking time was spot on. Definitely give it time to rest before cutting into it and you will end up with perfect pieces.  I've been asked to use this in our regular rotation!  Thank you, Kae!

I made this into individual pot pies but I could have used more sauce. Loved the flavor. All in all it turned out good. My mom even liked it.

I'm not a big fan of commercial pot pies. This was delicious. My only change was the crust - I used Pillsbury roll-out pie crust because I stink at making crusts.

This was very easy and very good!  I did make a few mods but followed the basic recipe.  I made the roux (as shown) then used 1 cup chix stock, 2/3 cup leftover gravy and a 1/2 cup of evaporated milk.  In a separate pan, I carmelized 1/2 of a large onion with 2 stocks celery chopped.  Then added 2 small cloves garlic and 1 t. of Poultry seasoning instead of sage.  I also added 4 chopped carrots (par boiled) and 1 cup of frozen peas (heated in the micro).  Combined and baked.  Next time, I will add 1 can of chopped water chestnuts for a little extra texture.  This was very tasty- definitely will make this again!

The crust is delicious and so is the filling!! I was very happy with this easy to prepare dish! My only suggestion would be to add maybe 1/2 cup more chicken broth - otherwise - perfect! (and definitely put foil around the edges)
