This was a great lower-calorie bread - I was very impressed. I did add about 1/4 to 1/2 tsp. ground ginger, which made for a nice addition. I had no complaints about the lack of pumpkin taste - let's face it, pumpkin by itself just doesn't have that strong of a taste. If that's really what you're aiming for, make a pumpkin pie instead.

This is fantastic pumpkin bread.  I'm bringing the recipe to my next weight watchers meeting!  I followed other reviewers' advice and doubled the pumpkin, adjusting the cooking time accordingly.  I also used freshly baked pumpkin instead of canned.  (Slice wedges and bake for at least an hour or until soft.  Puree with a hand mixer)  This freezes well in individual portions and reheats well. Wrap one piece in a paper towel and pop it in the microwave for half a minute.  Yummy!

Yummy!  I tried this recipe to use up some extra fresh pumpkin puree, and it turned out great!  I added sliced almonds to the first batch and chopped pecans to the second.  Also, I used 1/2 tsp. cloves and 1/2 tsp. ginger in the first batch to replace the nutmeg (still used cinnamon), and 1-1/2 tsp. pumpkin pie spice in the second batch to replace the cinnamon and nutmeg.  I also added 1 tsp. vanilla to the second batch.  Both batches were great!  Pumpkin doesn't have much flavor, so it's all in the spices!

I realize that there's a lot of opposition to rating a recipe to which you have made significant changes, and I understand why. However I enjoy reading about what changes other cooks have made, it gives me inspiration. If you don't agree you may want to stop reading now (no hard feelings, I swear).   I substituted half of the white flour with wheat flour. I used about 1 and 1/3 cups of real pumpkin puree, substituted 2/3's of a cup of Agave Nectar in place of the 1 cup of brown sugar and used 2 tsps of pumpkin pie spice instead of the individual spices.  I made buttermilk from 1% milk by adding one half a tbsp of white vinegar to the 1/2 cup of milk, stirred and let sit for five minutes. I baked the bread in muffin tins at 325 for 25 minutes.   Yes the five stars are based on my version but I have no doubt the original recipe was just as yummy, and by making these simple changes the calorie count was further reduced to about 110 calories per serving.

This is an easy and delicious recipe.  My husband especially loved it, because it's not too sweet.  It sort of tastes like gingerbread.  We ate it warm with a little whipped cream on top and it was great.

This tasted good, but I did have some problems with the baking time. I baked it for about 20 minutes longer than recommended, and it was still slightly undone in the center. We could still eat it - the problem was slight, but be prepared to adjust the baking time.

This is a very moist light quick bread.  It was very easy to make and the family just loved it.  I think next time I might add some chopped nuts and/or raisins for just a little more flavor and texture.  This is great for afternoon snacks and school lunches.  Thanks bunches!

I love this bread and make it all the time. Some people say it doesn't have the "rich" pumpkin taste - tastes great to me!  Add one cup of chocolate chips and substitute sucanat for the brown sugar to make it even better.

This is a great base recipe!  I did read the reviews and added all four of the recomended spices:cinn.,ginger,nutmeg, and vanilla.  I doubled the whole recipe and used one big can of pumpkin for two loaves.  I used whole wheat flour in place of white flour, plain yogurt instead of buttermilk and olive oil in place of veg. oil.  My husband, son and I really like it!

When I first made this recipe, I thought it was a little blah, not bad, but lacking something.  So I added raisins and walnuts.  I also tripled the recipe so I could use a large can of pumpkin all at once (3 cups), and substituted regular white sugar for 1/2 of the brown sugar.  Also, instead of buying buttermilk, I just mixed 1 Tbsp lemon juice to each cup of milk, let it stand for a few minutes, then added it in.  Turned out great.  Anyhow, I now really like this recipe, and have made it a few times.  It is also really good with some icing drizzled on top, but fine without it.  I'll be removing my other pumpkin muffin/bread recipes from my recipe box.  This low fat version is just as good and much better for you.

Very delicious and moist! Didn't have a really strong pumpkin flavor (which is what I was looking for).  The 2nd time I made it, I added an extra 1/2 cup or so of brown sugar and liked it better.  My daughter and son request this year-round.  In fact, when I try a new recipe, they say "It's really good, but will you make the pumpkin bread again?"  =)

Excellent flavor with 1/3 cup more pumpkin and go heavy on the spices.  However, eat it up the first day, it tends to gets moister and stickier with time.  Betty

I read the other reviews before starting, so I did add the other 1/3 pumpkin puree and the teaspoon of vanilla. I adjusted the baking time to add an extra 15 minutes due to the extra pumpkin added, and that turned out to be perfect. This was a big hit in our house!! Tastes and smells wonderful!

Though I liked the bread, the first thing my mom said was "This is low fat, isn't it?"  It was pretty good but was obviously low fat.  Will try again, but with some modifications.

If you are looking for a good pumpkin bread recipe, this is *not* it. There was no pumpkin taste at all (and I followed the advice of others and added more pumpkin).

However, if you are looking for a good spice cake recipe (flavourfull, moist, dense, filling), you will not be disappointed. I wasn't looking for spice cake so I was disappointed with the results.

If you're looking for a bread recipe with rich pumpkin flavor this isn't it. I thought it tasted more like a spice cake. It would be a great recipe for people who don't like pumpkin.

This bread is so yummy! I made it for a Christmas party and everyone loved it. I doubled the recipe and made 3 8 3/4 by 3 1/2 inch loaves. I also added some ginger and sprinkled brown sugar on the top before cooking for a little extra crunch. I thought it could use a little more pumpkin even though I added about 1/2 cup extra. Overall I loved it and it does taste even better the next day!!!

Very good bread with a nice texure.  After putting it in the oven I realized I forgot to add the butter.  The bread was marvelous without it and provided an opportunity to splurge by adding butter to a warm slice!  I followed suggestions by others and added  an additional 1/3 cup pumpkin and used 2 tsp pumpkin pie spice.  A definite keeper.

The first time I made this, I found the bread too moist for my taste...so next time I increased the flour to 2 cups, left out the butter but added a little extra pumpkin, doubled the spices and it turned out great.

I cannot believe that you can make pumpkin bread with out oil! Amazing, moist flavorful. I omitted the butter and used a whole can of pumpkin, used pumpkin pie spice could have used more. I didn't have buttermilk so I made my own. baked in an hour. It's wonderful.

I added the extra pumpkin and vanilla, but otherwise stuck to the recipe. It was delicious, moist and only 2 WW points per slice (9 slices per loaf)

This pumpkin bread turned out fluffy, moist, and delicious. I used 1/4 cup Egg Beaters instead of real eggs and it was still wonderful. Thanks for a great recipe!

Delish and very moist, big hit over Christmas. Modified recipe as follows -- instead of 1 cup pumpkin puree I used the whole 15oz can; instead of 1/2 cup buttermilk I used 1/3 cup; instead of cinnamon and nutmeg I used 3 heaping 1/2 teaspoons full pumpkin pie spice. I mixed all wet ingredients together then folded in the sifted dry ingredients and I sprayed the baking dishes with nonstick spray. I baked two loaves together took full hour and then I turned off oven and left in for 30 mins. Let bread cool before removing from baking dish so it sets -- it is so moist and heavy if you don't cool it may fall apart.

I made this as written and it was fine.  I followed some other reviewers' suggestions to add more pumpkin and it was better.  I used a 15 ounce can of pumpkin instead of one cup.  Delicious!

Just made this today.  Very nice recipe, but made some changes.  The stars are for the recipe, not mine, but mine was 5 stars. To do this right (and healthy)I used whole wheat flour (add 2 tablespoons more flour when using whole wheat), also used pumpkin pie spice (a tablespoon).  USe a bit of apple sauce and another 1/2 tsp of cinnamon makes a difference.  Instead of buttermilk, consider greek yogurt (non-fat, vanilla or plain) and I used splenda but the recipe is best with the recommended sugar mix.  Also, use a bit more pumpkin than a cup.  I went with twice that and it is great.  Hope this helps!

My DH says these are the 'moistest muffins' he has ever had.  I have made these a couple of times now.  Originally I followed the recipie exactly, I have also (depending on what I had on hand at the time) substituted pumpkin pie spice for the cinnamon & nutmeg, olive oil for the butter, and another time substituted sweet potato for the pumpkin.  I used a 15 oz. can of cut sweet potatoes in juice, drained, then mashed with a potato masher.   Each time the muffins are moist, delicious, & gone before they get a chance to fully cool.  Oh, yeah, did I mention I usually bake these as muffins instead of in a loaf pan?  Equally delicious either way.

This is the best pumpkin bread i have ever had! This is also my first attempt at baking in 15 years and it came out perfect. I added raisins and extra buttermilk, next time I will add nuts. It's so moist I can't stop eating it!

This is a really easy yummy recipe. I use soy milk instead of buttermilk since that's what I drink and I also add a teaspoon of pure Vanilla. So good and it tates even better after a few days. Thanks for this recipe!

Fantastic!  I followed the recipe exactly the first time I made it and it was sooo good.  The next time I jazzed it up a bit by topping it with a mix of: 1/4c dark brn sugar, 1 tsp. cinnamon, 1Tbl. flour, 1 Tbl. melted butter.  That will top two
loaves...trust me you will want to double the bread recipe.  I also added Craisins and chopped pecans.  It is the best the day after baking.  I found this recipe better than the higher fat and cal. recipes thank you for sharing!

This may be the best "light" quick breads I've tried. I did modify the recipe to make it a little healthier by substituting 1/2 c. whole wheat flour for that portion of the all-purpose, and reducing the brown sugar to 3/4 cup. Added approx. 2 T of chopped walnuts as well. YUM--totally worth your time!

Unfortunately, I did not enjoy this bread and I could not finish eating it. While it smelled wonderfully like pumpkin as it baked,  the bread lacked any pumpkin flavor. The texture was rather tough and dense as well. I will continue to look for a good pumpkin bread recipe.

I added the extra 1/3 cup pumpkin and extra spices and 1 tsp vanilla. I also added some raisins to one half of the loaf, I will definately put raisins in the whole thing next time, it was delicious! My 3 year old and 18 month old devoured it!

11 21 12 ... http://allrecipes.com/recipe/6845/baked-pumpkin-bread/ ... Sooo good.  Been making this for years, but the submitter went from Eleanor Johnson to JJOHN32; which is okay, but confusing.  Glad I found it to save. 11/12 Had a mini -bakeoff & this beat pumpkin gingerbread.  This is a prettier bread - more rounded & orange color.  Only negative is that it's sticky on top pretty soon.  Maybe less sugar next time.

This was a great pumpkin bread! Super moist. I decided to make it more healthier by only adding 1/2 cup packed brown sugar and 1/2 cup wheat flour. I think I might add some cloves next time. My husband said this was his favorite so far! I call it my yummy diet pumpkin loaf. :)

OH MY GOSH. I made this recipe a second time with 1/3 c. more pumpkin, a bit of added ginger, cloves, and vanilla, oil instead of butter, and a handful of chocolate chips. THIS IS AMAZING- my new favorite recipe for pumpkin bread! With the extra pumpkin, it does take an extra 5 minutes of baking but is SUPER moist.

Loved it ! Didn't have buttermilk so I used whipping cream. I found it to be very moist.  I know what people mean about the slight salty flavour but I thought it was the baking soda.

OMG This was the BEST! Thank you for FINALLY giving me a lower fat/calorie version of my favorite! The guys at my husband's work LOVED this & no one even knew it was low fat! The only change I made was the buttermilk - I didn't have any so I used skim milk (since that's what was in the fridge.) Didn't seem to make any difference & was still yummy! Thanks for such a great recipe!

Loved, loved, LOVED this recipe.  Tasted just like my grandma's used to taste!  Just for that, I would give it ten stars if I could.  The only change I made was to add about a tsp. of vanilla.  Excellent recipe for pumpkin bread.

Easy and delicious recipe.  I've made these many times, and baked them in smaller, single size pans for small Christmas presents.  You have to decrease the baking time when you do this though.

This is the best recipe for healthier bread....you can easily substitute at least 1 cup of the flour for whole wheat flour.  Add some walnuts and a few raisins....cut back a bit on the sugar a bit....Delicious! Moist and sweet and filling.

Very moist (I did add just a couple tablespoons of oil).  The only think I'll do different next time is cut back on the nutmeg to 1/4 tsp. vs. 1/2 tsp.  Very good!

What a waste of ingredients! It came out like a brick. I'll throw it out to the squirrels, but I doubt they'll even eat it.

The whole family liked it.  I added extra pumpkin (about 1/3 cup) and extra cinnamon.  It was moist and delicious.

I hate pumpkin pie... and i loved this bread.  we used fresh New England pumpkin pulp. we found it helps make the bread sweet.  it's harder then opening a can, but we think it's worth it.  We also made 6 mini loafs, instead of the one big loaf.  Still bake for 1 hour.  Great for going to see old friends.  You'll find it's hard to keep this bread around.

These were great! I substituted the following to make it slightly lower in calories: replace 1/2 cup flour with 1/2 cup whole wheat flour, 2 tsp pumpkin pie spice instead of other spices, 15 oz of pumpkin puree, and 1/2 cup applesauce instead of buttermilk and butter.  I made these as muffins instead of bread - same temperature, bake for 20-25 mins. Super moist and delicious!

I did make some changes that other reviewers had suggested. I used a whole can of pumpkin, 2tsp. pumpkin pie spice, omitted the butter, added a splash of vanilla, and used skim milk with lemon juice instead of buttermilk. It turned out fantastic! Very moist, full of flavor, and hard to just have one slice! I cannot post a picture because my husband and I have already eaten half the loaf :)

This is my go-to pumpkin bread. My family loves it! I've recently veganized it with soy milk and vinegar instead of buttermilk and egg replacer instead of the egg and earth balance instead of the butter, but it tastes pretty much the same. I always add chocolate chips to mine, about 2/3 of a cup. Yum!

I loved this and made it several times over the holidays. I was wanting something not sweet and made it into a savory bread that turned out great.Exactly the same but NO sugar. I browned a handful of fresh sage until crispy in a little oil oil with a pinch of salt, added that to the mix, with a dash of a spicy chili powder garlic spice mix, drizzled a ting bit more oil oil on top. It is delicious! Great versatile bread!

I loved this bread! It didn't find it lacking in taste at all. To be healthier, I used half wheat flour and made my own buttermilk from vinegar. Will DEFINITELY use again!

I substituted sour cream for the buttermilk, since it's what I had on hand, but it is delicious nonetheless. Definitely something I'll be making again and sometime soon.

I often have changed recipes around per other reviewers suggestions & had nothing but success.  I wish I could have written this review without rating it.  I gave it 4 stars since most people said they had to add extra spice ... & it it wasn't the recipe's fault that I had to throw it out.  It was mine.  

I increased the pumpkin & the spices.  Other than that, I added more spice, 1 tsp vanilla extract & a generous amount of pecans & raisins. The batter tasted pretty good  I highly recommend being very careful altering this recipe if you, like me, are not a very experienced cook.  Mine was a gooey mess.  By the time it cooked the top & sides were burnt & it tasted terrible.  I really should've stuck to the program on this one.

I was looking for a low fat, lower calorie pumpkin bread and this fit the bill.  

Delicious! Delicious! Delicious!

I did make some adjustments to suite my tastes.  I added 1 teaspoon of pumpkin spice, 1 teaspoon of honey and an extra 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon.  I also did not need to leave my loaf in the oven the entire 60 minutes, as the recipe called for - mine was good to go around 50 minutes.

This bread is always a huge hit and never lasts more than a day in our house!  I have made this exactly as specified, as well as with double pumpkin.  It always turns out wonderfully, no matter how I make it.  I always use the milk and lemon juice substitution for buttermilk as that is not something I buy.  I have found that I usually need to bake for at least an hour and 15 minutes, more if I have increased the pumpkin in the recipe.  I will be making this bread for many years to come; thanks for the great recipe JJOHN32!

This turned out delicious, very moist! I substituted 1 cup of the white flour for whole wheat and used honey instead of brown sugar. Great as a breakfast bread or with coffee in the afternoon, I will definitely be making this recipe again!

I've made pumpkin bread many times using various recipes but this is by far the best!!! I did however alter the flour as I try and add a bit of healthy whenever possible.  Since this was my first time trying the recipe, I used 1/2 cup white flour, 1/2 cup wheat flour and 1/2 cup almond meal.  I've never used almond meal before but read it's good for baking and can be used to substitute up to 50% of the flour in a recipe.  I cannot taste the almond meal in the bread at all which means the health benefits are there without noticing.  The rest of the recipe I followed exactly except I baked it in a square stone pan for 30 minutes rather than a loaf pan.  It came out perfect.  Next time I will probably omit the white flour completely and just divide between the wheat and almond meal.

This is my absolute favorite pumpkin bread recipe.  I've made it several times and have never had a problem with it.  In fact, my kids wanted to bake gifts for their teachers last year - this is one of the items we used.  Several of the teachers sent their compliments on this specific bread.  The only change I make is to use pumpkin pie spice in place of the cinnamon and nutmeg.  And I never have buttermilk around so I make my own.  Does not negatively impact the flavor or density of the bread.  Yummy all the way around!

This is a fantastic recipe! I have a few comments!  1) I didn't have brown sugar on hand so I used 1/4 cup molasses and 1/2 cup sugar. It still turned out fantastic! It also lowered the calorie count to 145 calories per serving  2) We totally kicked up the spices, but who doesn't :o)  3) We loved this bread so much we turned around and made muffins immediately with the leftover pumpkin! We may/may not have added 1/8 cup chocolate chips to this batch ;o) We baked the muffins 20m & began checking with a toothpick.  I am so excited to have these on hand in the freezer for toddler hands to enjoy!  P.S. For the poster who had problems with the cooking times, a meat thermometer is a surefire method to test the doneness of bread, or you can use a skewer to make sure you're reaching the bottom. Cooking times are so varied by oven/weather/etc. It's rarely the fault of the recipe.

This bread was super super super super super good according to my 6 year old.  She really loved it!  She even brought some to school to share at snack time, and the other kids loved it too! -even with the added raisins- I made a few minor changes: doubled the cinnamon and nutmeg and added 1 tsp ginger and 1/2 tsp ground cloves (per loaf) and added probably half a cup of additional buttermilk because the batter seemed heavy.  The bread was moist and delicious!

Delightful recipe!  I made several minor-ish changes to suit my tastes and inventory.  I added about an extra 1/4-1/2 cup of pumpkin, about 50% more of the required cinnamon and nutmeg, and 1/2 tsp of ginger (I like it spicy).  I omitted the butter as it didn't seem necessary.  I used yogurt instead of buttermilk, and replaced half of the flour with whole wheat.

This is quite good.  I have quite a lot of pureed fresh pumpkin in the freezer that I need to use but I'm also trying to reduce the fats...  I think I may try using 1/2 whole wheat flour and maybe dark brown sugar.  Thanks for submitting!

This is absolutely the best pumpkin bread EVER! NO joke, I keep making loaf after loaf because I can't keep it on the counter more than a day. (I'm trying to blame the kids...) Awesome recipe!!

I followed other reviewers suggestions-more spices, more pumpkin, etc, and I was unhappy with the results.  I had to throw the loaf out.  I will make this again, following the recipe, and see if I find it more favorable.

Recipe should more appropriately be called SPICE CAKE.  It has very little pumpkin and lots of spice.

This is a wonderful pumpkin bread!  I added 1/8 teaspoon of ginger and poured the batter into muffin tins, then baked for 15-20 minutes.  My boyfriend and I both loved it, and I had a hard time believing it was low fat...I couldn't believe how incredibly moist they turned out!  So tasty...this one is definitely a keeper.  Thanks, Eleanor!

I also am not a huge pumpkin pie fan, but this bread....I love it!!  So moist and flavorful!  Let's see..I had a piece for breakfast, one for an afternoon snack with hot tea, and I will probably have to have another piece after dinner. It's addicting. (and really low in fat!!!) Thanks for a great recipe.

Very good, although the texture was a little off, but that could have been something I did.  Not super sweet, which is what we liked about it.  Would add chopped walnuts next time.

Good!  I added an extra 1/2 tsp cinnamon, a dash of cloves, and dark chocolate chips.  Really moist (which is rare for baked goods without much oil/butter).

Made two loaves of this bread today (day off due to "Superstorm Sandy" and I was lucky enough to have minimal damage). I doubled the amount of pumpkin (as recommended in other reviews). I increased the cooking time by almost 25 minutes. After an hour, I tented the top of the pans with aluminum foil to prevent burning (should have done this earlier). The taste was awesome. Some burning due to the prolonged cooking time, so I took it out before the knife came out clean. I'd definitely make this again!

This was a good recipe.  I modified it for my gluten intolerant hubby.  it adjusted very nicely to my many modifications.  Plain loaf but allows for a nice helping of cream cheese icing.  Thanks!

Delicious!  Cleaning out the freezer I found a cup of pumpkin puree from our CSA in the fall.  Whipped this bread up and it is wonderful. Also much more economical than the other recipes I reviewed.

Very moist, no crumbling like so many recipes. Good alone or with vanilla ice cream. At 6,000 ft altitude, although I used 1/3 cup of extra pumpkin for 1 x the recipe, you really don't need that much extra pumpkin even though some reviewers suggest that. I made two loaves and froze one for later. I will be making this often! When we decided to use the frozen one, it was even better than the one we didn't freeze. My husband had rave reviews...he loves his cake moist. The only additional ingredient I added was nuts. Yum!

Sooo good!  I had just baked a pumpkin, and used some of it for this bread.  It tasted a lot better than my normal recipe, and was much healthier.  I even used whole wheat pastry flour and applesauce instead of butter.

Made this recipe exactly as written, except baked in mini loaf pans. Expedited cooking time to only 20 min. Turned out wonderfully moist and delicious. Great recipe!

I followed the directions to the letter.  My family ate the loaf in less than a day.  It was wonderful!  When I make it again I'm going to make a loaf with nuts.

Just made this today for 1st time. The changes I made were: Used whole wheat flour, used only 1/2 teas salt, used 1/2 the nutmeg, added 1/4 teas allspice, used 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1/2 cup Splenda, used Lactaid milk (didn't have buttermilk) and sprinkled top with cinnamon sugar and sliced almonds.  Baked it exactly 1 hr and it turned out moist. If you are looking for a sweeter bread, this recipe is not for you.  I probably would add more to the spices I used and add additional Splenda & Brown Sugar.  It tastes good warm and I can't wait to see what it will be like in a day.  I doubled the recipe when I made it to get 2 loaves.  So I am giving this 5 stars due to the fact it's not overbearing on flavor and for me, it's just right.  I also say, it was very easy to make - everything in one bowl was great!  I will probably make again, because I can have this on Weight Watchers also - it's only 3 points a slice, compared to other pumpkin breads I looked at!  Thanks for sharing this one.

Great recipe! I substituted 1/2 cup Splenda brown sugar and added raisins.  Less calories and still yummy!

This bread turned out dense, chewy, plenty moist and not overly sweet. I didn't measure the spices I used, but I definitely added more than what was called for. I dumped in cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves, ginger and went a little overboard with the cardamom, so that's a bit more noticeable than I planned, but it's still tasty.

This is a great recipe. My kids LOVE it!! I have passed this recipe onto lots of friends who loved the bread and how healthy it is. Very moist and lots of flavour. The only changes that I made were doubling the spices, use whole wheat flour and add a tbsp. of ground flax seed to up the nutrition.

I must have done something wrong.  I was excited to try this recipe as I love pumpkin bread.  It turned out very dense and kind of gooey in consistency.  It didn't taste very good either.

This recipe is terrific! Not full of oil and white sugar, but full of flavor! I added just a little extra spice, but didn't make any alterations.  Just carefully watched the cooking time and adjusted the heat down on my oven by a tick toward the end.  Cooked about 56 or 57 minutes, but the last five minutes I cooked at 325 rather than 350.   I made this bread and the house smelled so good! And 24 hours later, my husband and I have eaten more than half the loaf.  My only advice:  Double the recipe, because it will be gone quickly!

This turned out amazing!!!  I wanted something sweet but not too sweet and this hit the spot.  My husband and 3 year old enjoyed it as well.  I followed the directions to the T and it was very easy to make.

Recipe turned out ok, but needed more cooking time and the outside turned out to be slightly overcooked - don't know where I went wrong, unless you are supposed to remove from oven with inside still moist, i.e. toothpick not coming out clean? Also found a little bit too salty and maybe would have been better with half or a quarter the amount of salt and double the amount of pumpkin.

loved the recipie but needed a bit more zip. Added 1/4 cup more pumpkin and 1 teaspoon cinnamon and 1/2 teaspoon nutmeg  1 cup walnuts and 1 teaspoon vanilla.  Also used fresh pumpkin.  I found blending the spices with the pumpkin first gave it more flavour.  I didn't bother buying buttermilk just used the recipie on this site using lemon juice.  After these ajustments bread was fantastic.

Easy, quick, but do not use pumpkin pie filling as a substitute for the pumpkin puree, too many spices - I'm sure it will be better the next time I make it though.

Are there more than 5 stars? It is SO GOOD.  I sprinkled with sugar and pecans before baking, the best.  In one day, my family finished one loaf and I made a second.  I had to back about 1 hour 10 minutes, could be my oven.  Make sure to check with knife or toothpick.  SO EASY!

This bread turned out great, I did make a few adjustments though... 
I added 15 oz of pumpkin and also added half a cup of grahm cracker flour. I also added some powdered ginger, slivered almonds and white chocolate morsels. Instead of buttermilk, I used almond milk. I told my 8 year old it was gingerbread and he can't get enough!

I tried this recipe twice with very disappointing results and I just don't understand where I went wrong.
1st time I subbed 1/2 c whole wheat pastry flour for the 1/2 c white flour. I also added a full can of pumpkin and only added 1 tbsp of butter.  I made muffins instead of a loaf, baked them for at least half an hour and they were still not cooked in the middle. 
Next time I subbed all wheat pastry flour for white, didn't add any butter, added whole can of pumpkin and baked it in a loaf dish for 90 mins.  The outside is dry and rubbery and the inside is still undercooked...?
I'm not going to even attempt a 3rd...

This is a great recipe, I've been using it for a few years.  It always gets good reviews when I bring it to a food sharing event. Also, once I forgot the buttermilk, and substituted evaporated milk, and it tasted good!  It's defintely better with the buttermilk, though, and even low fat buttermilk works.  So yummy!

I specifically searched for pumpkin bread knowing I had half a can left-over from the holidays. After sifting my dry ingredients, imagine my surprise when I pulled my pumpkin out of the fridge and only had about 1/2 a cup! Oh, well - I was already this far into the recipe, so I mashed two bananas, added my little bit of pumpkin and hoped for the best. My husband and son said it's the best bread I have ever made! I never told them it was also low-fat (I used lite country crock in place of the softened butter for even less fat & calories). I will definately be making this again and again!

I made this bread.  The only change I made was I used whole wheat pastry flour.  It was AMAZING.  I really loved it and so did my whole family.  It is good enough to give as a gift.  I am going to try with more spice though, because I like my pumpkin bread a little spicy.

I liked how you could add or take away a bit to meet your taste and it still turned out nicely!!! I did as someone suggested and did 1/2 whole wheat flour, used plain yogurt instead of buttermilk, and left out the butter all together.  I did mix in about 1/2 cup of chocolate chips and used cinnamon and all spice.  I think this would be nice too with a light powdered sugar glaze.

I was looking for a recipe for pumpkin muffins when I came across this. I added a little bit more nutmeg than what it calls for. Instead of the loaf pan I made muffins, they came out moist and yummy! I baked them for about 17-18 min.I will definately make theses again soon!!

I wouldn't listen to anyone who says this isn't low-cal - compared to other breads (250+ calories per slice), this is very reduced and still incredibily delicious. I took the advice of other reviews and added some vanilla. Mouth-watering! Smells grand. Will make again.

I am so glad to have a good recipe without a whole cup of oil!!I added 1/2 cup of mini chocolate chips to make my kids happy. That was a big success!

This bread has pretty good flavor, but I'm not in love with the texture -- it's a little rubbery.  It's definitely moist, though!  I'll of course finish eating this loaf, but I don't think I'll make it again -- I'd rather try modifying a higher-fat recipe that I love, and make it less greasy.

Nice basic recipe - I read other reviews and also added extra pumpkin and vanilla, along with extra spices and some ginger.  Tastes great and is nice and moist, too.

This is yummy! and my 3 yr old ate it up. i used just one small handheld pumpkin, it had just enough in it. i used fat free buttermilk and added 1/8 tsp. of ground cloves and ginger. i had to put it in 2 separate smaller pans and it was done in 15-20 minutes. very good texture. thanx!

This bread was wonderful.  It might not be sweet enough for some, but it was just right for my family.  I made one loaf with as the  recipe suggested and added walnuts and raisins in the another.  It was very moist, and came out beautifully.

I made this recipe twice so far. Now a regular for Fall season:) I would suggest checking at 50 minutes. 60 was still delicious except threw away the end pieces. My husband really enjoyed having it in his lunches. I baked as directed for spices and it’s excellent!

This has been my favorite quick bread for years now.  Very moist and delicious!  I keep everything exactly the same except I do use all or part whole wheat pastry flour.  Comes out great for me every time.

I loved this recipe and will absolutely be making it again. I made a few changes - I roasted and pureed fresh pumpkin instead of using canned, I added a dash of pumpkin pie spice, and I added mini chocolate chips (as I always do to fall bread). Moist and delicious!

Love this recipe because it doesn't have copious amounts of oil in it.  In fact, there's none.  I also added 1/4 tsp ground clove for an extra flavor boost.  Moist and delicious!

I made this bread 3 times last fall. DELICIOUS!!

I probably add more spice but I don't measure it.  I go by smell and when I can smell enough spice I stop.

I make a double batch and bake it in a bundt pan so that it cooks all the way through.

I mix powdered sugar and cream cheese to spread on each piece if my guests desire a little splurge.

This is so yummy.  The house smells wonderful while it bakes.

Adding this to the permanent collection! Used 1 1/3 cup roasted hubbard squash in lieu of pumpkin (it's what I had on hand) and used 2T olive oil (instead of butter) and 2 tsp  pumpkin pie spice instead of the cinnamon and cloves. It took a full 55 min to bake. So moist and delicious!

Next time I'm going to try subbing 1/3 c shredded carrots for 1/3 c of squash and maybe adding in raisins.

Loved it!!  Super moist, super flavorful!  I used evaporated milk instead of buttermilk and didn't use the butter.  Even substituted 1/2 cup of wheat flour for the white to make it a little healthier.  Nom, nom!

Made it according to the recipe with no additions, which is rare for us. It was delicious! My coworkers loved it and my daughter took some to school and one boy offered to pay for more! Definitely a keeper. But next time I may add a little vanilla to the mix.
Edit: Made it a second and third time. Added vanilla. Made them into muffins with a cream cheese filling. Even better!

Very good especially for a lower calorie bread, keep in mind one serving is 1/12 of the loaf. I did add a crumb oat topping. Overall not a very sweet bread but has good flavor. I used this recipe because I had some leftover buttermilk and the lower calories helped as well with my interests in this recipe. Will probably add nuts and raisins next time which of course will add to the calories. All in all this met with my expectations.

Great recipe. I followed it for the most part. Just decreased the sugar down to 3/4 cup cause I'm not a sweet person and used 1/2 cup of 1% milk with 1/2 tbsp of white vinegar to substitute for the buttermilk. Still very most and fragrant.

LOVED IT! Such a great snack, healthier & cheaper alternative to Starbucks bread everyday! I made 2 already this week (I froze one), and can't wait to make more! I added low-fat chocolate chips to one of them and it really made it delicious!

Super easy! I did make adjustments though.  I added a teaspoon of pumpkin pie spice...left out the nutmeg. I only used a 1/2 teaspoon salt. I added 1 teaspoon of pure vanilla. Instead of butter I substitued extra virgin olive oil.  It came out perfect and tasted great for a low calorie bread!!!  It took about 55 minutes to bake.  Highly recommend if you are calorie counting!!!! Cheers!

My husband and I loved this recipe! It was sooo moist, tasty, and wonderful! Instead of buttermilk I used 2% milk because it was all I had on hand. I also just used one cup of canned pumpkin pie mix and skipped the nutmeg. SOOO good and I will definitely be making this again very soon. :)

One of the best, moist pumpkin breads that we have had.  This was gone the day I made it, and I still can't believe that it only has 2 tablespoons of butter.  I was about 2 tablespoons short of buttermilk, so I added in appplesauce to make up the difference.  This baked up beautifully, with a slightly brown crust that was a little crunchy around the edges.  This bread was wonderful by itself, but we spread on some cream cheese frosting to a few slices and wanted to bake another loaf to finish off the frosting.

This bread was such a huge hit at my party with adults and children!  I even have a friend who doesn't typically like pumpkin bread who loves this recipe.  I made mine with real pumpkin puree and used half egg nog, half regular milk instead of buttermilk.  Yum!

Great texture and taste for low fat version.  I used fresh pumpkin and Vietnamese Cinnamon from Pensky's Spices.  It was delicious.

Wonderful pumkin bread - not too heavy or spicy. I'm always looking for the healthy school snacks for my boys and this recipe was just it. I followed the recipe exactly and the result was great. Thanks!

THIS IS A LOWER CALORIE PUMPKIN BREAD?  Bravo. My sister has made this twice and it's very moist. It's perfect with butter.  My sister didn't use buttermilk, just milk, so it probably could have tasted better or differently. I've taught her how to make butter milk now, so we won't have that problem any more.  I definitely recommend this recipe as a snack or desert.

Wonderful! I had started mixing the pumpkin, sugar, and spices for a pie and then realized I was out of evaporated milk. I scrambled for a recipe and found this one. Worked out great! I did have 1 1/4 -  1 1/2 of pumpkin already, and 2/3 cup white sugar and 1/4 cup brown sugar, so I just used that and then 3 3/4 tsp pumpkin pie spice (since it was already in). Everything else I kept the same and it came out great! Even my husband, who doesn't compliment very many things actually complimented this one! It is definitely a bread, though; not sweet, so I had some cream cheese frosting on the side. Great recipe! Thank you!

Loved this recipe, and the fact that it didn't call for an obscene amount of oil. I added a little ground ginger, as well as about a half cup toasted walnuts.

This was a great healthy recipe!  I modified it by using whole wheat flour, fat free sweetened condensed milk, and 1/4 c egg white.  Very dense and moist.  Will deff make again!

Love this recipe. Oh my gosh, I used the 15oz can of pumpkin and change some of the ingredients, but this is awesome. I even topped it with the "Cream Cheese Frosting II" recipe and it was to die for. Super yummy!  I'm in love with this recipe. What I changed was: 1/2 teaspoon of salt, added 1 teaspoon of ginger, 1/2 teaspoon of ginger. Used 1 cup of milk. Used ¾ cup regular sugar and added 1 teaspoon of pure vanilla extract. It took longer to bake, but it was worth it.  Yum, can't wait to debut this at Thanksgiving!

I had a ton of good reviews about this. I thought it was great with coffee/ tea. When I got down to the  last ingredient I realized I diddnt have it, but it turned out great anyways.I also used 3 meatloaf pans, the measurements werent the same, but it was just fine.  Ill make this again soon.

This is by far the best pumpkin bread I have ever tasted and it is super easy - one bowl! You're guests will NEVER know that it's so low in fat and calories. I like to toast slices under the broiler and put butter on it...crispy on the outside and soft as ever on the inside!

I couldn't measure 190g of flour so I used nearly 2 cups,1 cup of mashed roast pumpkin leftover from a roast pork dinner with some homemade apple sauce,I don't have baking soda so left that out and couldnt measure 6g so I put 2 teaspns of baking powder,instead of buttermilk I used 1/2 Cup milk with a little lemon juice,1/2 cup brown sugar(220g seemed alot if im claiming it to be healthy)I guessed cinnamon because I couldnt measure 2g I put 1 teaspn,1/2teaspn ground ginger and 1/4 teaspn ground cloves.I baked it in a loaf tin that is more like 8 1/2x4 1/2 Inches than 9x5 and it took about 35mins at 180C (not an hour).Looks and tastes good.I give the receipe 3 stars because I found I had to guess some of the quatities and so I felt I had to take a risk.It's our first try at pumpkin bread and I think it won't be our last.

I loved this recipe!  We doubled it and made it for muffins like one of the other reviewers recommended.  I used extra pumpkin and removed the butter and used half whole wheat flour and it was wonderful!  We got tons of warm comments when we gave them to neighbors as a Thanksgiving gift.

I used Dark Brown sugar for this one, It has a VERY heavy taste of molasses...so Next time I will use regular brown sugar.  As it is now, all I can taste is molasses.   I also didn't have any buttermilk, so I used sour milk.  It is very heavy and moist, and I am looking forward to trying this one again.

This bread is great! I replaced the butter with canola oil and the spices with pumpkin pie spice. I also threw in raisins and walnuts and it tasted wonderful, almost like warm gingerbread.
You won't believe its low fat.

This recipe is easy to make and the bread smells wonderful when it is baking.  It bakes up light and fluffy, but is a bit sticky.  It definately could use a 1/4-1/2 tsp of ginger to add some more flavour.  I don't really see how it is low calorie though, low fat yes, but not low calorie.  I would maybe make it again, but I think that I prefer my other pumpkin bread recipies in general.

This bread was great.  It is just my husband and I in our home so we were slow eating and I kept worrying that it was going to get hard and nasty, but it stayed perfect for over a week with just foil over the pan.  Awesome!!

I loved this recipe. Very light and moist!! I have made it several times, and will continue to make it.
It was very easy. I did add some vanilla, and  other spices, like ginger, as recommended. I also add chocolate chips in my pumpkin bread.

This bread was tasty yet light and airy.  If you are watching your calories, this is the bread to make.

Very tasty.  Definitely add more pumpkin and vanilla.  The raisins were an extra treat.

This was an excellent recipe! It didn't last two days! I added walnuts for some extra pizazz. My husband, who doesn't like pumpkin,loved this bread. Thanks!

I am very new to baking and I was looking for a low fat snack.  This is perfect!!  I am going to make it again in muffin cups!  I substituted egg substitute for an even lower fat bread.  It was extremely moist!

I used leftover pumpkin puree from another recipe -- my kids loved this bread (so I didn't mention that the beta carotene from the pumpkin was good for them)!

Great tasting and fast. I baked several mini-loaves to give as gifts; it got rave reviews. Also nice because it's fairly lean. Yum!

This bread is quite good, especially when you consider how low fat it is. My only complaint with it is that it doesn't taste very pumpkiny (if that's a word!). Next time, I'll try adding more pumpkin and see what happens.

Very yummy! I've made this so often -- I can't believe it's taken me this long to review it. This recipe has worked with both fresh (cooked) and canned pumpkin.

I absolutely loved this recipe.  I substituted 2 Tbsp. apple sauce for the margarine to cut down on fat, and it was delicious!  Very easy, but addictive!

The bread was easy to make but was a little plain.  You might want to add items to spice it up a little, nuts, etc...

This is a fabulous bread.  I used freshly ground nutmeg, which really pumped up the flavor.  Also subsituted butter for margarine.
