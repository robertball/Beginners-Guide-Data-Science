Ive been making this recipe for years, my grandma showed me this when I was a little girl, but instead of regular hashbrowns we used the o'brien potatoes. Really yummy.

I did as the recipe said with a few changes.  Bake at least 55 minutes, I used seasoned salt and cream of mushroom soup. Put the potato mixture in a 9X13 , sprinkled  1/2 the cheese on top and half the can of onions, than the chops I baked them 55 minutes to an hour, than I sprinkled the rest of the cheese and onions on top  and put in the hot oven till the cheese melted.  My husband couldn't  stop saying how tasty it was.  He loved it.

This was good but i cooked it at 375 for 50 min covered, then 15 uncovered.  Paranoid about under-cooking.

This is a good change from regular pork chops.  I also tried it with cream of mushroom soup.

A pretty good recipe, but I felt a little guilty eating it and serving it to my in-laws. The amount of fat and calories is a bit overboard for my comfort. Have kept the recipe, but am not sure how often I'll be making this recipe.

This is a good base recipe.  I made it exactly as described and it was good and very comforting.  But I think I would add a bit more spices next time for a little something extra and a bit more flavor.

This is an absolute winner..The only thing I changed was I added diced onions to the hashbrown mixture and saved all the fried onions for on top!!!This was very easy to make and very satifying to eat!!I will for sure make this again!!

i used vidalia onions in the casserole with the french onions on top for the last 15 min. Really good.
My dad used to make this for us when we were kids but the sour cream and the cheese made a huge difference in flavor me. A keeper... thanks for the receipe.

We just thought this recipe was okay. I followed it exactly and was a little underwhelmed. It did taste better when we ate it for leftovers, after having sat overnight. The potato part was just a little bland. Still a good recipe; maybe it just needs a little excitement.

Yummy!  We usually scale back on the chops since it's just two of us eating them.

I followed ingredients as listed in recipe.   I used 3 -1/2inch boneless pork chops and brown them several minutes on each side. I ended up cooking the dish for an hour so that the potatoes would cook and brown. Changes-- in future I would  slightly defrost the potatoes to shorten cooking time. I also might add some frozen mixed vegetables.  Then you would have a complete dinner in a dish.

My husband and I loved this!  I added 2 onions and 2 peppers to the mixture.  I also browned the pork chops to the point of almost being done and added all the spices that I usually do when cooking them.  We will have this again!!

I seasoned this a lot more than the recipe called for, and it turned out pretty good.  I really liked the potato mixture.  I think my family would prefer the chops separate from the potatoes though.  It was a little bit of a hassle to try to get the chops out with the right amount of potatoes... but I will make the potato portion again for sure.

This was my first time making this recipe and it was delicious.  I read the reviews prior to trying it, so I made sure to spice up my chops while browning with salt, fresh ground black pepper, garlic powder and sauteed onions. That seemed to do the trick. Definately a re-do.

I usually make this just as a side dish without the pork chops.  I also add a little bit more cheese because we love it--it's a family favorite!

I use potatoes o'brien (cubed taters with pepper and onions) and add a little garlic powder. Make sure you let this diesh sit for about 10 - 15 minutes before serving as well. I prefer using boneless chops as well. My great aunt found this recipe in a magazine many years ago, and has been a family favorite since. If it seems a little runny, try reducing the milk a bit and adding some extra sour cream.
