I'm giving this 5 stars for ease of preparation and texture, but know that it will taste like jello since you are using gelatin to flavor it.  I made a double batch of cherry and had a blast whipping it up and prying it out of the bowl.  I used a dry wooden spatula to spread it better in the pan (I used 2 cookie sheets) once it set slightly.  The next time I made a batch of cherry, I put several drops of peppermint oil in the boiling sugar mixture.  As far as cutting and packaging this candy, I've cut into squares and I've also handrolled small tubes using confectioner sugar coated hands.

This divinity is fail proof.  Even when I didn’t cook it long enough the taste was in-creditable.  I used strawberry jell-O… and it tasted great too.  It is also beautiful to serve.  

Special note:  When cutting the divinity, dip knife in large glass of cold water.  This will help keep the knife clean between slices.

Excellent... I'm getting the my Christmas candy list prepared and test out new recipes to use at the holiday.  This one is a keeper.  I used strawberry banana jello and it was pretty & good.  I think I'll try to dry out some cherries and mix those in with the nuts.  Oh and since it is humid out here in southeast Texas, I did keep out 2 tablespoons of water.

I'm so glad i came across your gelatin divinity recipe. The candy is so pretty and the fruity taste from the gelatin just makes it more tasty than plain old divinity. Just a tip, when I make divinity or fudge I turn on my dehuidifier,as high humidity can cause the candy to not set up. This recipe will definitely become a holiday tradition in my home.

This is the same recipe that my grandmother used. She passed many years ago when I was still in grade school and I have tried several times to make this. Thank you so much for bringing me back to a christmas tradition that I have missed for so long. AMAZING!

oh wow.  I just got finished fighting this out of the mixing bowl and it is delicious!  although quite the sticky confection, it is really tasty - reminds me slightly of saltwater taffy without the salt mixed with marshmallows...I guess I'm just a northerner new to divinity, but it is definately an entirely new type of candy to be made in my kitchen.  I used sugarfree cherry jell o and it made no difference (obviously, since there's three cups of sugar already!).  I'm already considering a batch of lime...

So I have learned that I don't like divinity after it has set.  it's just too sweet for my taste, as well as everyone else in my house.

Wonderful recipe!  I made it with lime gelatin, and also with raspberry.  Both taste fantastic.  As a newbie to candy making, I was not too sure about the whipping "until the candy loses its gloss," so each batch I made came out a little different texture-wise. But all the candy was deliciously edible.

Not the divinity I am used to, being from Ga. but more of a salt water taffy consistency. Maybe I didn't beat the mixture enough, it's still a tiny bit glossy but my electric beater sounded like it was going to blow so I stopped. I may add salt next time and create a salt water taffy. PS: I left out nuts for the kids. Overall 5 stars, loved it.

I've never really tried divinity before this recipe. I used black cherry jello mix and it came out like a dream.

This came out very chalky.  I used a candy thermometer and have made candy before but I don't know what happened.  Not gonna try again.

These were perfect! I made these for a baby shower (for a baby girl) and not only was the color perfect for the occasion but everyone loved the cherry kick in this divinity.

I love what the egg whites in the jello.  It the jello a light, airy, feeling in your mouth. I wouldn't have ever thought of that. My family loves this so much, we always fight for the last scoop!

I am not sure what I did wrong but most likely it was my uncertainty of what 'not glossy' is. I thought the mixture was still glossy but it started to get too thick so I stopped mixing. I have never had divinity before but I imagine it being kind of like nougat (?) and this texture was not it at all (likely because I messed up with the mixing). I used 2/3 the amount of sugar and it was borderline too sweet. My daughter loved it even though it was sticky and messy to eat. I would try making this again, or perhaps another recipe, to figure out what I did wrong. Benefit of a doubt, 4/5.

If you like divinity, this is the recipe to use. Using Jello helps the divinity to set up better and it adds a nice flavor to the candy. 

Beware! This is a very sweet candy. We never make more than a single batch at Christmas.
