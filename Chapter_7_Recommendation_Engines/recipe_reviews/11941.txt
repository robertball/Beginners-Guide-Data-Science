Yum! Super easy and fast. I used cream of chicken instead of cream of mushroom and it was really good!

I changed a view things in this recipe to spice it up a little and make it nice and creamy. First I used cream of chicken soup, added 2 tablespoons of plain yogurt and 1 tablespoon Mrs. Dash Table Blend (Classis Garlic Italiano). Then at the very last I added 3/4 cup Mexican Blended Cheese. Yummy!

It was quick and easy, the only problem was the lack of flavor. Need to add seasoning to the meat next time.

Good starter recipe.  I cooked the chicken with garlic and white wine and then mixed with noodles, milk, snow peas, mozz. cheeze, and soup. I added xtra cheese and milk as well as salt and pepper at the end.

I made this tonight because I had some extra ingredients that fit this recipe.  I changed two things.  First, I added a cup of leftover sour cream, some seasoned salt and pepper to cook with the soup mixture.  The next change was that I used 5 leftover frozen chicken patties that I had, microwaved them and chopped them up. I added them at the end.  The vegetable I used was brocolli and I did use the mozzarella cheese.  My husband, daughter and I all really liked this meal.  I think the chicken patties actually added a lot of good flavor, and that it would have been kind of bland with just regular chicken.  This is so easy that I will definitely make it again!

Good recipe.  The original would probably have been a little bland for our tastes, but we substituted broccoli for the peas and sour cream for the milk.....yum!!!!

Quick and easy to make, but changed up the recipe a little.  I added some Mrs. Dash and some chicken seasoning to give the chicken more flavor.  I only added 1/4 cup peas, but threw in 1/2 can carrots and 1/4 cup corn.  Gave it a yummy taste.

This was quite bland the way the recipe is. I saut√©ed  the chicken in EVOO instead of boiling and used cream of chicken soup instead. I wish I would have used two cans, cause it wasn't as creamy as I had hoped. This is a good jumping off recipe, but it definitely needs to be tweaked.

This recipe tasted very good.  I used broccoli instead of peas, and I added another can of soup - we like a lot of sauce!  I would also recommend seasoning the chicken.  I used garlic and pepper.  Easy to make!

this was really good! not amazing or anything, but a great meal if you dont have much time! this is what I did. i substituted "cream of chicken" because of the other reviewers. I also sauteed up mushrooms in butter and garlic for more flavor. Added salt and pepper of course. when it was all done i put it in a baking dish and put more mozzerella cheese on top and broiled it on high to get the cheese nice and golden. added a good touch :) next time i will add an onion, i just didnt have one on hand. will definetely make again though! thanks for the recipe!

We liked this with some changes.  I diced the chicken, seasoned with garlic salt and pepper, & sauteed in pan. Then added 8 oz. sliced fresh mushrooms, and cooked until just barely tender. I decreased milk to 1/4 c. and added 1 can cr. of chicken, increased mozz. cheese to 1/3 c. and added 1/3 c. parm. cheese. Five stars with changes.

YUM! Great for a simple meal without much fuss. Just what I was looking for and didn't have to go to the store for ingredients.  Added a can of Cream of Chicken for a more creamy base. It was just a bit too creamy, so maybe 3/4 or 1/2 can would be perfect.  Added some garlic salt to the cream base as well as some salt and pepper.  Added about 2 cups of frozen broccoli, carrots, and cauliflower mix instead of the peas. Went well with the flavors.  Would make again!

Comfort food!!!  Made a double batch, used "Campbell's Healthy Request" cream of chicken soup, subbed light sour cream for milk, and used a can of fat free evaporated milk.  Skipped the cheese also.

This was a good recipe after I changed a few things. I substituted egg noodles for penne pasta, and used 1 cup all natural colby jack cheese. I also used a california blend veggie rather than just peas. These are just changes for my family's preferences but I bet even the normal recipe is delicious! Definitely will be making it again.

I think that making this recipe as it is given would only be 3 star recipe, but changing a few things really helps! This recipe is perfect for those who need something fast and need to use up food from their food supply. I changed this recipe by using whole wheat spaghetti noodles (the only noodles I had), grilled the chicken with seasonings instead of boiling, used spinach for the veggies (REALLY GOOD), used cream of chicken soup instead of mushroom, added 1/3 cup of sour cream to the mixture and almost a cup of Mexican blend cheese. The spices I used in the sauce were  italian seasoning, salt, garlic salt, and santa maria seasoning (a blend) and Wah-Lah!!! It turned out fantastic! This recipe was awesome because it allowed me to be creative and try to improvise a dinner... and it turned out fantastic. I will surely make this again!

Great idea! The sauce def. needed something more. I added sauteed garlic, onion powder, italian seasoning, cayenne powder, black pepper and salt. Boiling the chicken is a nice touch since it makes the chicken very moist! I used the left over chicken broth instead of milk just cuz I'm resourceful like that. I added frozen spinach along with the peas. It all turned out really great. It's a great use for the million cans of cream of mushroom soup in the cupboard!

Fortunately/unfortunately, I am like many others on this website...I "tweek" recipes to fit my tastes and pantry ingredients. I used most of the comments and some chicken I had already baked. There was one reviewers who said to use cream of chicken instead of mushroom, did that. I used French-style green beans instead of peas. I also used cheddar cheese, because it's what I had. This was ready in no time, easy to make and very tasty, my picky eater son loved it as well. I did add some garlic powder and onion powder. This is the kind of recipe that's easy to change and alter any way you want or need to change. I will make this again.

I would only recommend this recipe if you really like mushroom soup because that's all you can taste...made it exactly to the recipe and we did not care for it.

Easy, creamy, delicious pasta. I cooked chicken the day before in seasoned water, so the chicken its self was delicious. I sauteed chopped onion with salt and added cream of mushroom and sour cream instead of milk. Then mixed together all the ingredients. Sprinkled with Romano cheese when served.

This was pretty good, but I did things differently. I sauteed 4 thin chicken cutlets with garlic and onions, then made the cream sauce. I also had to add a LOT of seasoning as it was pretty bland; I used fresh parsley and a bit of tarragon and it made all the difference! A good basic recipe that needs to be jazzed up.

After reading some of the other reviews, I also used cream of chicken soup. While waiting for the pasta water to boil, I sauteed the chicken with some salt and pepper, and when it was nicely browned I added the soup, a little less milk than called for, and a couple dollops of sour cream. To this i added plenty of black pepper, some salt, paprika and a dash of garlic. I used carrots and peas I had on hand, and asiago cheese I had on hand. A very good starter recipe!

This was pretty good. I added 1/2 light sour cream as well as onion powder to taste. I also didnt boil the chicken, I pan fried it seasoning it with pepper. No need to use any oil or butter when frying the chicken, it's juicy enough it wont stick.

I liked this a lot. I ended up using cream of chicken soup and angel hair pasta which created a different but great texture. I also put a little sour cream and used a Colby Monterey jack cheese mix. I seasoned my chicken with seasoning salt and added garlic powder and Italian seasoning to the sauce. Very good.

It was good, but only after I added another 1/3 cup of milk and another can of Cream of Mushroom. I think the quantites were off on the original recipe.

Very good for a quick meal on a cold winter night. I doubled the recipe, using 1 can mushroom soup and 3/3 c. sour cream. Also added about 1 1/2 c. veggies (1 c. frozen mixed, 1 c. fresh broccoli). Finally, I seasoned the chicken with Italian seasoning and garlic before mixing it in, and the whole thing with salt and freshly ground pepper. The family really liked this one.

Yummy. I cooked the chicken breast in the microwave while the noodles were cooking to save time and used cheddar rather than mozzarella cheese. Good, quick dish.

Like others I thought the recipe needed pizzazz after I first made it. I withhold the mozzarrella but add 1/2 cup French fried onions, 1/4 cup Italian seasoned bread crumbs, 1/2 tsp onion powder, 1/4 tsp garlic powder, 1/4 tsp ground black pepper and 1/4 tsp salt substitute. I also bake the chicken in an egg and crumb mixture first. No need to prepare as a casserole; all but the noodles can be heated in the microwave.  The onions and bread crumbs give the mix body, and the result is tastier in every respect without overwhelming the chicken. Adding 1/3 cup parmesan is optional and may be guilding the lily.

Really simple, easy, kind of plain, but good with salad as a starter.  Used whole wheat egg noodles.

Turned out pretty good.  It did lack a little a flavor, but nothing a little garlic salt can't cure.  I might make it again.

This is OK.  It's just tuna casserole w/ chicken rather than tuna.  Suggestion - Saute your chicken w/ seasoning.  I used Mrs. Dash but even s&p would be better than boiling.  I had the ingredients and not many choices for dinner the other day when I made this but I won't make this one again.

Try using Cream of Asparagus Soup and adding a teaspoon of veggie stock powder. Gives it a nice balanced flavor.

Surprisingly quite good!  First, I sauteed the chicken in EVOO and Penzey's Italian Herb.  For the sauce, I used 2 cans CO Mush, about 1/3 cup of sour cream, Penzey's Black & Red, Garlic powder, more Italian Herb season, and milk.  Tossed in a couple handfuls of mixed veggies.  And, used more mozzarella.  No Yoke noodles.  Served with garlic bread.

I thought this was delicious. I threw some green onions in the bowling water for both the noodles and the chicken. I had no peas so I used celery and carrots. I also added some garlic to the soup and milk mixture. After mixing everything together I added some salt for a little extra flavor. Very tasty! Very creamy!

I substituted elbow macaroni for the egg noodles and used a whole bag (16oz) of frozen mixed vegatables.  I also didn't have mozzarella cheese so I used Colby Jack instead.  To give it a little extra flavor I added some garlic pepper and onion powder.  Turned out very yummy.  Will definatly make it again!!

Needs more flavor - I added quite a bit of seasoning and still wasn't entirely satisfied.  Not bad, but needs some work. I'd give it a 3 as it is.

I thought this was horrible.  Cream of mushroom does not belong in it at all.  Maybe sour cream would have made it a little better.

I was just looking for something that would be quick and easy to do for supper and this certainly fitted the bill.
It tasted really good and the melted cheese really helped to give the sauce a velvety finish.

EXTREMELY simple and very tasty.  I marinaded the chicken overnight first (honey dijon marinade) added some sour cream to the milk/soup mixture; I also added some mild spices.  I only added a touch of cheese. My husband loves this, and it's easy to make. Thank you.

I made just as directed, using the broccoli option and a little more pasta and cheese than called for.  I also cooked my chicken, seasoned with mrs dash, in the crockpot and shredded it to add to the mix.  I thought it was just ok...a little bland.  I did add some salt and garlic salt to it and that helped.  That being said, my children (7, 5 and 2) ate it all and said it was so good.  And my DH liked it with some Tabasco added to it.  So...it's a keeper in our family and one we'll make again.

I made some changes but overall this is really good. I salted & peppered the chicken & pan fried it in extra virgin olive oil. Added 3 cloves of chopped garlic & some sliced mini portabella mushrooms. I also added about a 1/4c of Parmesan cheese since I wanted to use the last of what I had. I added some chicken bouillon cubes to the pasta water for flavor & added about a ladle full to the chicken/sauce mix when I added the noodles to help thin it out. I'll definitely make this again, it comes together really fast.

I made this tonight, but I did tweak it a bit. I used Barilla Cellentani pasta, 1 1/2 cans cream of chicken soup. First I sauteed a small amt of choped onion and then added chopped garlic and then removed it to a bowl. I cut the chicken in small pieces and cooked in same skillet. I seasoned the chicken with Lawry's Seasoned Salt, garlic salt and pepper. After removing chicken I put soup, milk, a scoop of sour cream, a big scoop of cream cheese, peas, chicken bouillon & parsley. Then parmesan and mozzarella. Then I added back the chicken and onion mixture and pasta and seasoned more to taste. Very good. Thanks Melissa.

Giving it 4 stars for a jumping off point. Good start, but needs ALOT more flavor. My additions, which produced really yummy results (everyinging into the mixing bowl -- Sauteed (together) 2 diced carrots, 1/4 c. diced onion, 1 lg. clove minced garlic. Then add 1/3 c. shredded cheddar cheese, 1/4 c. mayo, 1/4 t. thyme, 1/4 t. each salt and pepper. Note: Thyme is a really essential addition to creamy chicken casseroles. Really enhances flavor of an otherwise ho-hum dish. Don't overdo it though -- a little goes a long way.

Not a huge fan of this one. It was very easy to make but lacked flavour. I followed the recipe with no changes though. I think adding a few more things would help but I'll probably not make it again to find out. Thank you for the recipe though!

This is a great recipe, its quick and easy, and you can change it up a bit to suit whatever your in the mood for. But I have to agree that it could use a bit more salt. Putting herbs on the chicken and cooking it stovetop makes for a great substitute for salt for those watching their weight or those who like to spice it up.

Be sure to find a good brand of the cream of mushroom soup, because most of the flavor comes from this if you stick to the recipe. I like that this recipe keeps things simple, because it gives you a clean slate to build on to make it yours. I might try this with cream of chicken soup, and maybe even sundried tomatos.

My 4-year-old son and I made this for supper tonight.  Super easy and fast.  My son said, "Yum!" and ate it all up.    

Before making, I realized that a lot of the reviews mentioned it was blah, so I added some seasoning.  I also used broccoli (I cannot get my son to enjoy peas) and canned chicken breast.

This recipe was really good, but I hardlystuck to it!!! First, instead of boiling my chicken, I browned it in olive oil, mince garlic and salt to give it flavor. Then for the sauce I added xtra milk plus evaporated milk. I didn't have any mozzarella so I added asiago and parmesan. It gave it alot more flavor and I highly recommend using these cheeses. I added a 4.5 oz. can of mushroom stems and pieces, and I didn't have any peas so I just did it like it was. The sauce turned out really good!!! : )

This was somewhat bland but the family liked it. I guess I need to claify what the family is my husband, me and our 2 year old. It was a hit with the 2 year old.

I made this recipe last night because I had the noodles and chicken and wanted a variation of a chicken breast meal that my family had never tried before and it was an instant hit!  I used broccoli for my veggie because I had it on hand and the recipe was a little bland so I added some Mrs. Dash table blend to the chicken as I cooked it.  Even my baby girl who is very finicky about foods cleaned her plate!

This was a really simple, lovely warm and creamy dish! I'm going to try a different cheese next time, and maybe add a different veggie as well.

This recipe was good when I first made it, but it was GREAT when I modified it a little.  The sauce was a little bland and too mushroomy so I added an 8 oz block of Montery Jack Cheese, parsley, salt and pepper.  The chicken I flavored with Adobo (a spice), seasoning salt, pepper, and Tapatio (a hot sauce).  Everyone loved it and it was easy to make.   A definate new favorite!
