This was a decent recipe.  Not enough rice.  I added a full cup more.  Also, for kick, I added a tsp of mustard powder, dill and garlic powder.  Would have again.  VERY easy to make low-fat/lo-cal by using no-fat mayo/miracle whip, reduced fat cream of chicken soup and the fat-free Wow! potato chips.  I've tasted both versions and they are identical!

I've made this recipe for years but always called it Baked Chicken Salad.  To give it great flavor and keep the chicken moist I buy a cooked roasted chicken from the grocery store and take the meat from it for the recipe (Sam's Wholesale Club in my town has the most meaty and jucy roasted chickens I've ever eaten).

I made a few changes to the recipe like broccoli instead of water chestnuts and cream of celery soup instead of mayo. I also added some white cooking wine(just a splash), garlic powder and sauted onion. It was a hit! Two teens and  a husband whose mom is an awesome cook ate it up. Only enough leftovers for his lunch the next day. Great recipe!

I substitute waterchestnuts with hardboiled egg sliced and I clean up the fridge using old mushrooms and green onions in this as well.  Delicious and good to freeze and serve.  A family favorite, I can't get enough of it.  One of the few things where the leftovers don't sit around!

Holy moly.  It may be tasty, but recipes has Way too much fat!  Cheese, mayonnaise, AND deep-fried potato chips in one dish? I do like the option that some people show of not using the mayo.  It helps a little, at least.

O.K., so even tho I added extras to make this dish more flavorable, I'm still giving it a four because a three really sounds like it's garbage and the recipe really had good bones. I used two cans of soup (mushroom and celery) added a lot more seasonings and because I had leftover chicken marsala from our party, I used that with some of the sauce. That alone added a ton of flavor. Used a garlic cheddar, leftover chips and leftover fried onions for the top. I don't even like rice, yet I and my family really loved this. Daughter Ashley's boyfriend went back three times to pile up his plate. Again Paula, this was great but it I felt it did need a little extra umph. Thanks!

You can make this recipe lowfat and add nutrients by substituting cornflakes (5 c. slightly crushed, melt 2 tbs marg, shake in  ziploc bag together). I also add 1/2 c. slivered almonds to cornflake mixture to give casserole more crunch. Use lowfat mayo and BROWN rice. Yum!

Easy & a bit different.  Overall, not a bad recipe, but it could use a little more flavour.  I added some cayenne & tabasco for a little more kick.  Will try it again, but make some adjustments.  Thanks!

Alittle bland.  If I make this again, I'll probably prepare it with Miracle Whip instead of mayo.

Changing my rating - I've made this recipe now several times and with a few changes, it's among one of the favourites in my family. So I'm changing from 4 to 5 stars. -replaced mayo with 1 can condensed broccoli soup -replaced celery with chopped broccoli -didn't bother with the onion and put in a little onion powder, and garlic powder -used a 8x8 baking dish to make a thicker casserole (needs to bake a little longer -I also usually buy one of those rotisserie chickens from the deli, then de-bone it and use the whole chicken.

Great meal for a cold night.  Left out the mayo. Added more cheese and a bit more water and used ruffle chips.  A keeper.

Our family enjoyed this recipe. However, as a matter of personal tastes, I would make a few changes the next time. I found the amount of chicken was fine, but like a previous reader,  might add a little more rice. More veggies. Also, next time I will double the soup and use a double of a mixture of mayyonaise and miracle whip. Maybe some curry? Just a little something to kick it up a notch. Also, I would like to try some different cheese on top. I wouldn't bake the potato chips but add them last.

While definitely not one of the healthiest recipes that I have made, my family loved it. I did use almond slivers and used one can of Cream of Chicken and another of Cream of Celery.  I also followed another reviewers advice and doubled the rice. One cup is definitely not enough.  I will make this one again.

I made a few changes to this recipe just to fit family tastes and availability of ingedients, but it was very good.  I used 1 1/2 c rice, mushrooms instead of water chestnuts, and ritz crackers instead of chips (we only had barbecue) but it still turned out great.  We will make this again:)!

I have been making this recipe from this site for years and just realized that I never reviewed it!  I made this originally because of my daughter who loves potato chips.  I use low fat cream of chicken soup and Helman's mayonnaise and I usually skip the water chestnuts and the celery.  I did used to put in the water chestnuts but they really only add crunch to the dish.  I didn't notice any difference without them so I just leave them out now.  Tasty and good comfort food but lots of calories!

i was pleasantly surprised by this recipe. i considered mixing the cheese into the casserole, but didn't, and i'm glad - i think it keeps the chips on top from getting soggy, they stayed nice and crisp.  i'm a little scared of the nutritional value to this recipe, but i did use the lighter soup and light mayo - hopefully that helped some!!

This was great!  It doesn't HAVE to be fattening - just sub for lower fat ingredients like the cheese, mayo, and soup.  Very creamy with lots of crunch.  Certainly satisfies the gooey casserole cravings we all get once in awhile!

Easy and delicious!  I used Baked Potato Chips and Olive Oil Mayonnaise to reduce the fat and make the dish a bit healthier.

I thought this was really good stuff and the kids loved the potato chips on top!  The inside turned out nice and creamy, despite that I forgot the water.  I had to substitute the soup because the MSG gives me headaches.  I used a jar of chicken flavored gravy.  The only other thing I changed was adding some sliced almonds and I couldn't imagine this without them!

This was an excellent week-night meal.  My kids loved it because it had potato chips on it.  Next time, I will leave out the rice and just add more chicken, onions and celery, since I'm controlling my carbohydrate intake.  I did use half a large onion this time, and chopped it rather than grating it.  I left out the water chestnuts at my hubby's request and substituted light sour cream for half the mayonnaise, which gave this an great flavor and saved some fat calories.  I also used oregano and basil (both dried) in the sauce/chicken mixture.  A little hot sauce would have been good too.  I may add in mushrooms next time.
Great recipe.  UPDATE:  I made this for supper again last night, and substituted diced zucchini for the rice.  It was heavenly!  By the way, if you saute your veggies along with the chicken, you don't have to worry about your celery not being completely cooked.  Everything is more flavorful that way.

I tried this recipe last nite, but substituted the water chestnuts with 1 cup bean sprouts to make it more nutritious. Did not make it with rice but used instead pasta noodles as we dont eat rice at nite meals, and used half the amount of mayonniase with used yoghurt for the other half, also a liberal sprinking of lemon juice makes the casserole more moist, tasty and nutritious. We cut up all the salt called for in the recipe.

Good--I thought it was a little bland, but the boyfriend loved it, so I'll probably be making it again. I made it as is, but added a hefty dose of garlic pepper while I was mixing everything together, and also sauteed my chicken with a splash of white wine to boost the flavor.

This wasn't bad at all. I made it with lite mayo, low sodium cream of chick soup, and sour cream and chive flavored chips. If I were to make it again, however, I would saute the onion and celery. Thanks for a quick, easy and inexpensive meal!

My family loved this dish! The only thing I did differant was in place of white rice I used yellow rice with saffron. This can be purchased at any grocery store. It was very good!

I've made this recipe for years and call it Hot Chicken Salad, but make it with a topping made with cornflake, almond, and a little butter heated in a skillet.

I would have given this recipe five stars, but because of all of the fat content, I was forced to figure out how to make this healthier.  Here is what I came up with:  I used low-fat cream of mushroom soup, 1/2 cup of lite Miracle Whip, ommited the water chestnuts (no one here like's them), added Lay's Baked Potato Chips, some cayenne pepper to give it a zing, a dash of Lea and Perrin's Worcestershire sauce, and low-fat sharp cheddar cheese.  It came out amazingly good, and is something I can now prepare on a regular basis, instead of just once every five years!

This was a good way to use up left over chicken. We omitted the mayo, lemon juice, and water chestnuts.  We added red bell pepper, diced, and garlic.  I substituted Velveeta for cheddar and used left over cooked rice, so I didn't add the water either. It was tasty for sure, but I wish I had saute'd the veggies a little before adding them to casserole.  I also used cheddar sour cream potato chips for the topping, though as an after thought I could have used Cheese Nips and had  a slightly stronger cheese topping flavor.

This was very bland and didn't go over very well, not even with my three kids.  If I was to make this again it would certainly need doctoring up and I would probably change it to cream of mushroom soup as I found the cream of chicken gave it an off taste.  As other reviewers said I would either omit the celery or cut it up super small as it never seemed to cook and was still crunchy after 30 minutes.  Overall this recipe didn't seem worth it for the amount of fat and calories we ate in one serving.

The kids and I loved it, husband not so much. I'll probably fix it again, though. Very tasty! I used 20 oz canned chicken, 1 tsp onion powder, and left out the celery and water chestnuts.

I amended the recipe per previous reviewers suggestions, using 2 cans of soup, less water chestnuts and extra rice.  I also added about a 1/4 cup of white wine.  For all the fat this recipe has, the casserole wasn't all that tasty.  Very rich.  Fine for a first time try but not sure I'll make it again.

My husband & I really enjoyed this recipe. I took some other's reviewers advice and added some spices like oregano, poultry seasoning, lots of paprika, some parsley and chopped garlic. We liked the crunchiness of the water chestnuts! They added a nice texture. I used baked Lay's instead of regular chips and used much less than the recipe calls for, and it was plenty!
Easy! Will definitely make it again.
Thanks!

While definately not one of the healthiest recipe that I have made in some time, this was exactly the kind of comfort food that I was craving.  I did use low fat soup and used one can of Cream of Chicken and another of Cream of Celery.  Also cut the mayo in half and used low fat instead of regular.  I also followed another reviewer's advice and doubled the rice.  One cup would definately not have been enough. Next time I will use fewer water chestnuts and will chop them up.  They sort of overwhelmed the recipe.  With some tweeking, I will make this one again.

Had a great flavor!  Great change from a traditional cream of chicken soup casserole.  The mayo gave it a richer flavor.  I will definitely make it again.

Made according to directions using leftover smoked turkey DH made and homemade cream of turkey soup, again using leftover smoked turkey. For the rice I use Uncle Ben's Basmati Medley Savory Herb from the AR & Sponsor Share package. It really added a nice addition of flavors and texture. I bumped up the grated cheddar cheese to 2 cups per our personal taste. Rich, decadent and can absolutely be categorized as Comfort Food. Next time I make I'll add broccoli, asparagus or frozen peas.

Several reviewers have noted the fat content of the recipe. Here are some ways to trim it a bit: Use reduced-fat cream of chicken soup, substitute plain Greek yogurt for the mayo, and use reduced fat (2%) cheddar cheese. Then top with crushed baked potato chips. I've made this recipe through the years and always omit the water chestnuts. To me they do not add much flavor and will turn soft and 'sour' when you try to re-warm the casserole as leftovers.

Good recipe.  I had more chicken and rice so I used a can of cream of celery soup and put in a little sour cream and extra cheese to make the cream enough for the other ingredients.  I also substituted 2 cups frozen mixed veggies for the water chestnuts.  It made a whole meal and the family loved it!

This is a great "clean out the fridge" recipe. I had left over chopped broccoli and onion from a stir fry and I mixed that in.  Another time it was green peppers and green onions.  It's not a casserole the family goes crazy for but they eat it and the leftovers are an easy lunch the next day.

Not my favorite, but i don't like mayo so that's probably what ruined it for me. My company said it was good. My hubby said it was okay but wouldn't ask for it again. Thanks for something new to try, but not a repeat at our house.

Too many calories and fat so I sub. w/: lowfat mayo, lowfat cheese (also cut down amount), brown rice, organic bran flake cereal (instead of chips), threw some spinach (cooked for 1 min or so), and snuck in some finely grated zuchinni (cooked) and flax seed to enhance the nutrition level.  Very good both ways since my family loves the high fat version just as much! Very flexible recipie if you want to make it healthier.

We really liked this, but I only gave it 4 stars because we had to add some spice to give it some flavor.

I sauteed the chicken with about 1/2 cup diced onion, butter and EVOO.  Then added salt, white pepper, cajun spice (very little for some "bam" factor), oregano and garlic.  I also used half sour cream and half mayo.It was fantastic!  

Also, my hubbie suggested next time we use chedder/sourcream potato chips!  Yummy!

Very tasty recipe. The whole family liked it. The potato chips give it a nice crunch.

If you hate the taste of mayo, then don't eat this.  I put in less mayo than it called for and I still thought that it tasted strongly of mayo.  I did not like this at all.  My husband thought it was ok.

Good taste, easy prep, & also provides a way to use up leftovers!  My husband took two helpings -- & that is something I watch for when trying a new recipe.  My only changes: I used bread crumbs on top (as I had no potato chips) and I used Campbells "Southwest Pepperjack" soup.  I will leave out the mayo next time to save calories, as I figure it won't be seriously missed.  Thx, Paula, for the post.

This is really an awlsome "cold night" dinner!  My whole family enjoyed this meal.  I also doctored it up after reading that the org. recipe didn't have much flavor.  I chopped my chicken up with a food chopper.  The spices I used were a tiny bit of McCormicks Garlic with Extra Virgin Olive Oil, curry (since we are huge fans of curry powder), 1 sliced hard-boiled egg, salt and pepper.  I also used 2 cans of the cream of chicken soup and added French Fried Onions on top along with the pot. chips and cheese.  When it came out of the oven, it almost smelled like a crab dish!  I also used the Rippled potatoe chips.  We will definitely have this again....but not too often....very fattening but dee...lish!!  Gotta try it!  I will pass on to my other family members and friends!  Thanks for the recipe!

This is delicious. I also add more rice and cheese. Had this at a teenager at a neighbor’s house and she put almonds on top. I usually double the recipe. Easy to make and the family loves it!

Wow.  The salt! I like salt and this one was way too salty for me.  I was not a fan of the texture either.  That soup needs to be thinned with something, but then I'm afraid this casserole would be way too runny.  This one just isn't for me.

I use a pre cooked roasted chicken from our local market. After removing all the meat, I boil chicken carcass with an onion (onion skin and all - gives your broth a rich golden colour), garlic and celery - then use this hardy broth to cook rice in (this is key). Also, as one other commentator mentioned, a good hit of Tabasco and some curry powder really gives this recipe some needed zip!  As far as calories, ignore them - like anything else, moderation is key!  Don't bother adding wine.... Drink that while preparing!

I could tell simply by reading the ingredients that this was going to be rather bland!  So I increased the zip-factor with a couple of dashes of curry powder, a clove of chopped garlic, and a tsp of tabasco.  I also used extra rice - I'm thinking you could substitute pasta for rice for a change also.   I'll make this again, but definitely not using the recipe as it stands!  My version had far more flavour than this would, I think!   Very easy to make!

I nailed it on this one! This dish was first  introduced to me by my aunt linda at thanksgiving dinner. I just remember how much the men in our family loved this dish, and so tonight I made it for the hard working men in our family who are remodeling a rental and eating only Mexican food everyday?? inspired to change it up a bit.

I put my own twist to it. I Par boiled the rice in sone chix  stock. And with the left over water was my quarter cup for the water,I omitted  the  celery, onion, and lemon juice.I also mixed the cheese in with the chicken mixture. I crushed the chips with some garlic salt  for  some  extra  flavor. And I cut the chix up and cooked it in the casserole. I loved it! Will definitely  make this again!

I agree with the other reviewers. This recipe needed more flavour.
 I added three cloves garlic and fresh pepper. I also added more potato chips after reheating, before serving. Substituted cream of celery for one of the cans of cream of chicken soup. These changes added more overall flavour to the dish.

Very tasty recipe, usually have some cooked chicken around that needs a home. Found one now. This recipe is something like a hot chicken salad. Deffinatly a keeper. Fast to put together, got it together and in the oven. Made afast salad and dinner was ready. I did cut the calories some by using low fat mayo and cheese. Didnt have the sharp but still tasted great. Guess you could still cut more by useing baked chips and spraying the top with oil spray. But just don't seem the same.

Very good. 2nd time I made it I didn't have cream of chicken and I used cream of celery instead. Turned out just as good.

This was a great, quick dish. Made a few changes. I didn't mix the rice in, but served the chicken mixture on top of the rice. Also, I used low fat mayo and celery seed instead of celery. Amazing - the kids even liked it!

I used to make this recipe years ago and loved it and i was thrilled to find it again here.  I made it last night and it was just like i remembered it and the whole family loved it.  There was plenty for leftovers and it was just as good cold as it was hot.  I used a bit more chicken than it called for but it made no difference in the taste, so many different textures..very interesting.

this tasted pretty good, I didn't make it but my husband did and his only complaint was that it had many steps and seemed a bit time consuming...but the end result was yummy! (next time I won't add the celery 'cause the kids didn't like that, maybe just celery powder...)

My husband and I loved this recipe.  The only thing I changed was chicken broth for the water.  I will make it again, but will follow Karenve suggestion and use Jalapeno potato chips.  This also freezes well.

Started out with this recipe but then totally changed it.  I used chopped cooked chicken, 1 can low sodium/low fat cream of broccoli soup and cream of celery soup.  2/3 cup of fat free miracle whip, 1 cup plain yogurt, 1 tbs lemon juice, shake of mustard powder and garlic powder.  2 cups of cooked noodles instead of rice and ritz crackers instead of chips.  Used the cheese on top.  Is it even the same recipe anymore?  Everyone really like it but me.  So, I guess I'll have to make it again...

This was very good - cheesy.   I left off the celery - picky child.  My family liked it.  Next time I will make it with more rice.

My family really liked this recipe.  I omitted the water chestnuts and added a little more celery.  Next time I will halve the amount of chips on top.  It was too much and made the dish too salty.  Other than that, it was great!

Great way to use the left over Chicken that I roasted. Did not have cream of chicken, used cream of onion that I had on hand. Didn't have water chestnuts and if I make it again I will leave out the celery or chop even smaller. Too much of a texture difference for me.
