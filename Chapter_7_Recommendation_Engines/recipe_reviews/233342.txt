We really liked this cake.  I would say it is more like a cake-like pie.  I guess my pan wasn't deep enough because it overflowed. . .thank goodness I had the pan on top of a cookie sheet.

2.5.15 ... https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/233342/blueberry-mystery-cake/ ... I've been in the overflowing blueberry syrup situation before - & having homegrown, very juicy blueberries nearly ensures a mess - soooo to minimize, I used an 8x8 glass dish.  It was fine.  I added 2T cornstarch to the berries (very juicy ones) & reduced sugar in the cake part to 1/3c.  'Done in 35- 40 minutes.  Done = it bubbles five minutes.  The cake part reminded me of a sugar cookie.  It's crisp on top, but soft on the blueberry side.  A bit too much sugar.  'Not the prettiest dish, but you want to eat it, not just look at it.

Tasty & easy but not much different than other fruit cobbler type recipes. No one jumped up for seconds.

this is quite good.  i was looking for a recipe to use the last of my blueberry crop and this fit the bill.  the only one thing i would change is to add a bit of cornstarch to the berries before putting in the pan.  it is a bit soupy when serving.  other than that, no complaints.  delicious, quick and easy to make.  thanks for the post yogurt4k, i will make again!

This was easy and was a big hit at my spinning group.  I wish I read the first review, I didn't protect my oven and it over flowed.  Otherwise, I loved it and will make this again.

I’ve made this recipe several times and just love it. Instead of a pie dish I use a cake pan. It’s guaranteed not to spill over in the oven. I usually add a few more berries or even other soft fruit I have on hand. The recipe should say ‘scoop’ rather than ‘pour’ the batter over the berries.

I have made this Mystery Cake 5 times in the last week and half! My husband loves it! I made it with blueberries the first two times, blueberries and blackberries the next two times, and right now it's in the over with peaches! It's really really good and really easy to make! most ingredients you would have in the house except maybe the fruit. It cooks up beautifully with a nice crust and I would consider this more of a cobbler type recipe than a cake. During the summer we have access to beautiful marion berries which will be wonderful with this recipe! I highly recommend this, have posted photos on FB and given the recipe out to several people already! It's going to be a staple dessert in my house!

To be fair, this is more of a cobbler than a cake.  But I can tell after making it once, I will be making this regularly.  I followed directions exactly, except I used my frozen berries from last year.  I can't wait to try it with blackberries and may even try strawberries.  :)
