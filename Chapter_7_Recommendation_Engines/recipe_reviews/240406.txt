Have made this a handful of times. I tweak it a little each time. I like to sautee in olive oil,  garlic,  and butter along with the stems. Spooning them in its tedious so I put it in to a Ziploc bag,  cut the corner off, then squirt it in each cap (like a frosting cake thing). You can get in to all the corners of the cap and it's less mess and looks better. I also sprinkle shredded Parm on the tops before throwing them in the oven. Gives it that extra kick in the mouth. Finally,  when baking, I bake it on a broiler pan so they don't sit in all that juice. They are way less soggy this way and again, less mess.
P.S. serve in a deviled egg dish. They fit perfectly!

I really liked these!  There was a lot of filling so you may need more mushrooms depending on the size.  IMHO they do need a bit of color, maybe chives, red/green pepper, paprika on top or parsley.  I added little drops of hot sauce since I like spicy.  It added color and an extra zip.  Great appy, thanks Lindsay! #MyAllrecipes #AllrecipesFaceless

I made these mushrooms and my husband and I both liked it a lot.  It had a nice zing to it because of the cayenne pepper.  This gave me two
batches of at least 7 mushrooms a piece x2 for 2 :) and maybe some extras.

This is a super easy base for stuffed mushrooms.I have made this with smoky bacon,sausage,crab,and prosciutto or pepperoni bits.Veggies I have used,sateed chopped spinach added roasted or chopped red pepper,carmeluzed onion scallion.Any left overs works great as a stuffing for pounded chicken or turkey breast even on top of  burgers.They always disappear.

I make these around the holidays and they are always a hit! I add seasoned breadcrumbs on top and spray it with a little olive oil spray or a drizzle of olive oil before baking. To save time, I prep them the night before and store in a flat air tight container. Enjoy!!!

I made this recipe for New Year's Eve. I I changed two things. I used hot breakfast sausage crumbled and browned, mixed in. And I topped them with bread crumbs. They were a hit! Thank you so much for sharing your recipe ??

Great stuffed mushroom base. I changed the cheese to cheddar and added chopped crab meat. You can add just about anything to the recipe to please all taste buds. I will be making again!

These were inhaled by my family! I did as others suggested: put mushrooms on a rack with a foil-lined sturdy sheet pan underneath.

Made this 2 ways... 
I added cooked strips of bacon in the bottom of the mushrooms. - Amazing

And I ended up with extra cream cheese mixture so I took left over bacon strips and smeared their length with the cream cheese mix and then rolled them up like sushi rolls. OMG- even more amazing than the mushrooms!!!

This was really good! We added 2 1/2 strips of bacon and green onion. Only used about 4-5 ounces of cream cheese. Also added some mozzarella so they wouldn't be too runny.

I have made these several times as appetizers and everyone loves them. The preparation time is not to bad if having cleaned and de-stemmed ahead of time. I also extend the volume as 12 never seems to be enough. I would recommend using a glass dish for cooking, as a thin cookie sheet buckles in the oven and tips over the mushrooms during baking.

These were delicious.  I used herb and garlic cream cheese, and sprinkled a bit of Italian bread crumbs on top.  Serve three of us with big mushroom caps, wish I had more at the time.  So YUMMY!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Great recipe and I have had a few times.  Decided to try on my own.  I made a few changes, sautéed a Jimmy Dean sausage roll and chopped up and cooled completely as step one, to be added to the mix before putting in the mushrooms.  Also, used fresh grated Parmesan versus the dry bottled stuff.   Lastly, I love when these are super creamy, so instead of regular bar Philly Cream Cheese I used the 8 oz. whipped container.  They were AMAZING and due to the added ingredients made about 20 mushrooms versus 14.

These are delicious! The cream cheese is a perfect match for the mushrooms. I used a four cheese blend instead of just parmesan. It had provolone, asiago, romano, and Parmesan cheese. I will definitely be making these again!

I was looking for a keto friendly recipe and this fit the bill. I had a big container of baby portobellos to use and the amount of cream cheese mixture was perfect. I used cheddar, mozzarella and parmesan. I also poured some dry red wine over the tops and so they were sitting in a little bit of wine. They soaked up the flavor.  I broiled them for about five minutes at the end and the top had a nice crunch without the use of breadcrumbs. These were dinner along with a salad. The leftovers heated up nicely in the microwave for lunch the next day. I could eat them daily!

Absolutely delicious! Will make again! Added chicken broth, parsley and breadcrumbs to stuffing mix, then once mushrooms were filled, dipped again in breadcrumbs.

I made this for a meal with my parents, therefore I did omit the Cayenne.  When I make again, which I will absolutely do, I look forward to the Cayenne added back in.  As I expected the flavor to be dim, due to the Cayenne omission, I added in about an 1/4 cup of minced cooked bacon. Yes, Bacon makes everything better:)

I made these as a Thanksgiving appetizer and they were a huge hit.  I followed the recipe exactly except I omitted the cayenne pepper and added crumbled bacon.  They were moist and flavorful.  I made 3 dozen medium sized mushrooms (maybe plus a few) and I had plenty of filling. Definitely will make these again!

Amazing!  But I didn’t have cayenne pepper and onion powder so I made adjustments. I added crushed red peppers - just a touch. And chopped two green onions. It was amazing!  I will make this again for certain.

Easy on the barbecue!  I followed the recipe pretty closely, just added a bit of finely chopped red pepper to the mushroom tops and garlic when I was frying those up.  Then popped them on the upper shelf on the barbecue as it was heating - The mushroom caps were perfectly cooked when my delicious marinated salmon was done - maybe 20 mins with BBQ temp fluctuating between 325 and 375.

More mix than mushrooms. I'd prefer to thin out the cream cheese with more mushroom and breadcrumbs. Very tasty.

Very good appetizer. Good for people with gluten issues.
I've made a few times and use whatever cheeses are on hand. Everything works. You'll get lots of compliments.

My family demands I make these every time we all get together. Definitely a favorite. I skip the cayenne pepper just because we aren't fans of spicy. Love this recipe!

made this kinda.... used it as a guide.

used stuffer mushrooms 
wrapped a slice of bacon around
instead of the seasoning in this recipe i just used about a tbsp of chili powder. 
and a lot more garlic lol 
same temp and a bit longer due to the bacon

I used one package of mushrooms (which had 8), and I only used 4 oz cream cheese. I sauteed the chopped mushroom stems with a tablespoon of a bbq rub my brother makes instead of all the spices listed in this recipe. I added in chopped bacon with the cream cheese mixture. I skipped the parmesan cheese. Very delicious!

I ended up putting it under the broiler for a few minutes as the baking did not seem to do much to meld the flavors or melt the cheese. Pretty tasty.

I made this but with half the cream cheese (only 4 oz.)  It came out wonderfully and tasted delicious.  Normally I don't like spicy but this was very good.

Very tasty and not hard to make. I baked the stuffed mushrooms in parchment cups which was (I thought) a little easier to handle for my guests.

I quadrupled the recipe for a large party (nearly 50 mushrooms). They weren't difficult to make, even though I made 4x the original recipe. There was lots of extra filling, so I bought more mushrooms and stuffed those, too! They were ALL eaten up. I added a little bit extra spice but I don't think it was necessary.  Simple recipe that pleases a large number of people. Bonus, they're vegetarian so ALMOST everyone can eat them. :)

First time I have made these and we loved it. I added red peppers and green onions. I had two containers of mushrooms and had plenty of filling for them. I will defiantly be making this again!! I had a few left over and they heated up nicely the next day. Yummy!!!

This was a great hit for Christmas appetizers. I had more filling than mushrooms so used the extra on a large portabella I had on hand. I also added a green onion for color and taste but otherwise followed recipe.

I didn't have cayenne pepper or onion powder on hand, but  decided to try them out because they sounded delish. 

I added a handful of finely crushed garlic and parmesan focaccia croutons into the cream cheese mixture (for a bit of crunch) and they turned out great! 

Thanks for sharing your recipe :)

I made it as written and the flavor is delicious. a bit spicy so be aware of the kick. I'll make this again but might try substituting paprika for the Cayenne for a more smokey flavor. the reason I gave this 4 stars instead of five is because the filling makes a lot more than will fit into 12 mushroom caps. I ended up using every mushroom in the 16 oz container which made 32 mushrooms and still had filling leftover. I might try halving the cream cheese and seasonings next time. will def make again

These were fabulous!!! I somehow forgot to put the sauteed mushroom stems with garlic into the cream cheese mixture (realized after mushrooms were stuffed and was short on time). I sprinkled them over the cream cheese, and despite my mistake the pkatter was still empty. Thank you for a great recipe!!

I am NOT known for making delicious meals. Seriously. But these were the absolute best stuffed mushrooms I've ever made... maybe even the best appetizer I've ever made.  (Thank you Lindsay!!) I followed the recipe except I forgot the onion powder, I used 5 oz of cream cheese, and I crushed up one strip of bacon and sprinkled a pinch on the bottom of the cup before filling with cheese mixture, and another pinch on top of the cheese mixture. Also, I took someone else's advice and piped the cheese into each cap to pack it in. I baked for 10 minutes, and broiled on hi for 6 minutes. Perfectly done. Yum!!! I can't wait to make this again.

Made these for the first time, and they are phenomenal! Definitely going to be making these again. Only thing I did different from the recipe was sprinkle some shredded parmesan cheese on top before baking. I also filled some baby bellas which came out quite nice!

This was a favorite of the whole family's Thanksgiving dinner. It was eaten really fast. What I did was I combined this recipe with the Bacon wrapped stuffed mushroom and tada!! First thing gone on the table.

Thank you for this recipe

Excellent mushrooms.  I added a splash of white wine to the mushroom stems and garlic saute.  I melted the cream cheese into the pan with the saute.  I then added a generous pinch of both shredded mozzarella and cheddar, then stuffed the shrooms.  I did not add cayenne.

Sauté onion or scallion and then garlic cloves in butter along with the stems - also chopped spinach, roasted or chopped red pepper... Add some bacon, sausage, crab, prosciutto or pepperoni bits.  Or change the cheese to cheddar and add chopped crab meat.  Add a few drops of sriracha/hot sauce for extra spice. For more colour: maybe chives, paprika or parsley on top.  Cut the corner off a Ziploc bag and squeeze filling into caps.  Panko on top plus shredded Parm for extra kick.  Bake on a broiler pan so they don't sit in juice - less soggy and less mess.

These were great.  I did not make any changes.  My husband also loved them, although he SAID they were so rich he could only eat one.  I noticed, though, that later he was eating two at a time.   I will be making these for guests in the future.

This was my first attempt at preparing stuffed mushrooms and they were wonderful. I added a fresh jalapeño and bacon to the stuffing. I will definitely be making these again!

I liked these 3 stars, but since everyone else at Christmas dinner really loved them I gave them 4 stars.  I didn't make any changes.  Personally, I thought they tasted too cream cheesy.  They were very garlicky also which I liked, but just felt they are missing something.

I thought this was a very good recipe, but I think next time I will add sausage to the stuffing mix.  This was very easy to make and disappeared from the plate pretty quickly.

I liked the simplicity of this recipe. Unlike other stuffed mushroom recipes with spinach, peppers, crab..., this one delivers a clean mushroom taste with a hint of garlic.
The amount of the cream cheese sounded like alot for 12 mushrooms (  mine were medium size)
So I cut it by half and I had plenty of stuffing for all the mushrooms.
My Mushrooms were little watery though, maybe next time,raising the oven temperature little bit, would prevent that.

It was really good. I added onion instead of garlic. Also added spinach and red bell pepper and Italian bread crumbs and shredded Monterey and cheddar cheese.
