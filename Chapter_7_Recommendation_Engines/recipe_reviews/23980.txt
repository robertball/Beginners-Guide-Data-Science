Very tasty, simple, and quick recipe....perfect for a weekday dinner or lunch. I doubled the tuna and it came out just right -- any less and you won't taste much tuna.  The sauce was the perfect amount for a 12 oz. package of egg noodles.  Serves 4 dainty appetites, or 3 hearty ones!

To enhance the flavor, I browned the tuna and added a 4oz can of sliced mushrooms in with the onion.  I also added chopped green onions and fresh ground pepper at the end.  I will definitely make this again.

This was so easy to make, and my husband really liked it.  I didn't have sour cream, so I used a splash of milk and added bread crumbs.  A great last-minuter, thanks!

I thought this was great. I followed the recipe as written but added 1/2 a cup or so of frozen peas. Seasoned with fresh ground pepper and it was delicious! So easy and fast too.

This was VERY YUMMY!! All you need is a 12 ounce package (which is just right for the amount of sauce made) of egg noodles instead of four 8 ounce packages (which I thought was way too much)that the recipe calls for. Make sure you saute the onions on low for several minutes until they're soft and translucent. This is a DEFINITE KEEPER!! Thanks Michelle!!

This was pretty good. I used 2 cans of tuna - that seemed to be the right amount for this recipe.

A great family supper recipe.  Quick and easy to make.  My two toddlers loved it.  I added zucchini, peas and corn to make it a complete meal.  Next time, I'll try substituting plain yoghurt for the sour cream to lower the fat content.  Thanks Michelle.

This dish didn't have much flavor.  I added onion powder and that made it a little better but this isn't something I'll be making again.

Doubled recipe (three cans of 5oz tuna). Used minced onion.  Sauteed onion and tuna.  Then added it to the sour cream and soup in a microwavable container.  Heated for 5 minutes. Put it over the noodles.. It was done! Super EASY! and my entire family liked it! Definitely one to keep handy for a quick and yummy meal!

This was pretty good. I used whole grain penne, fat free sour cream, 99% fat free soup, and I added spinach to make it healthier. I also added four cloves of garlic to the onion.

This esentially tastes like the creamy tuna helper they have, but slightly more sour. Maybe a bit less sour cream?  This was quite tasty and could easily be tweaked to make something even better.

My family liked this a lot more than I did but Que Sera. So here's what I did: I used 1 tablespoon of canola oil, a can(10.75 oz) cream of chicken soup, 2 cans of tuna (5oz), and 3/4-1c. of mozzarella cheese. My son loved it! He thought it was the best tuna ever which is why I gave the recipe 4 stars. Yes I changed it a bit, but I still think it deserves it because by posting it Mickeymoo saved me a lot of time and much need money. I had forgotten to something out for dinner that night. Thank for posting it.

I doubled the recipe, using a 12-oz package of whole-wheat egg noodles and two 5-oz. bags of tuna (we prefer the bags over canned tuna!!).  I also added about 1 cup of frozen peas as I mixed and heated the soup and sour cream.  This was fantastic, and the leftovers tasted just as wonderful the following day!  Yum!

Very good and creamy. Hubby said it was okay, but too bland so could only give 4 stars. Will play with this some with different spices though to please him.

Delicious Indeed! This is a great recipe that can easily be seasoned to your taste. I made it with the following modifications: I used a 12oz pkg of noodles and 2 cans of tuna plus a bit more than 8oz of sour cream...I used up what was left in my container. I added liberal amounts of fresh ground pepper and a bit of sea salt. I will definitely make this again. This would be wonderful with the addition of sliced fresh mushrooms perhaps with some milk thrown in the extend the sauce to cover the extra veggies.

Yummy! Made a few tiny alterations to the recipe but not much; used penne instead of egg noodles (as I had some leftover already cooked), added two cans of tuna, some leftover frozen (cooked) corn (I added this in the same time as the sour cream to heat as it was already cooked) a tiny bit less sour cream and a tbsp each of onion powder and garlic powder. Also seasoned dish with garlic salt and fresh peppercorn before serving. Perfect amount of flavor for my picky kids! My husband even went back for seconds! Super quick and easy too, it will defn be on my recipes for busy weekday nights :)

This is a great start! I found the above recipe to be quite bland, so I added about 3 tbsp. brown mustard after adding the soup, and then tossed in what I had left over of frozen broccoli florets (maybe 1 1/2 cup or so). It was DELICIOUS, and my husband (who generally dislikes tuna) loved it. Definitely a keeper!

Good as written but we like a little more flavor so I spiced it up a little with some Mrs. Dash original flavor. I also added some red bell pepper just because I like them and they added a nice crunch.

Quick and tasty meal! I did not have any cream of mushroom so I used cream of celery. Added tomatoes, some green vegetables, doubled the tuna, and garnished with a little cheese. Thanks for the recipe!

I liked this recipe. I added a little minced onions and onion powder. And added sweet peas. Makes a meal in one. If you feel a little adventurous you can add touch of garlic powder and a touch of lemon juice. But put the lemon juice in with the tuna first and mix it. Then add the cream of mushuroom and the sourcream. Adds a little more flavor. But if you do that don't put peas in with it.

MY KIDS LOVED IT!! I didn't have any onions, so I skipped it but added onion salt instead. My husband and kids do not eat onions, so I used cream of chicken soup and added a second can. I also added a can of peas when I was done and it tasted WONDERFUL. There was not a single bite leftover. :)

This recipe was a real let-down. I had really hoped for better since it's so highly rated, but like some other reviewers, I found it very boring. I even added one chopped garlic clove, some chopped fresh mushrooms, frozen peas, and bread crumbs, but it still disappointed. Had to add pepper, salt, and red pepper flakes to make it more palatable. I could see it being a good recipe if you have children in your family who are picky eaters, I suppose, but I wouldn't recommend it otherwise.

Quick and easy and no leftovers!! My additions made it a little more of a balanced meal IMHO: another can of tuna, 2 c. of frozen peas, and about 4 oz. of fresh mushrooms sautéed with the onions. We'll be making this one again for sure!

It wasn't very flavorful.  I added minced garlic with the onion, and some Parmesan on top.  It helped, but was still missing something.

This dish is so easy and it's good either hot or cold the next day.  I always add pepper to the tuna and soup mixture and sometimes I substitute chopped onion for onion powder depending upon how easy I want to make it.

loved this and i was able to cut some of the fat by using light sour cream and 98 percent fat free cream of mushroom soup. I used a 12oz. pack of egg noodles and 2 cans of tuna. I also added peas and mushrooms for more substance. I will make this again soon.

Some changes I made: •Add only half a container of sour cream •Brown tuna with the onions •Sprinkle mozarella cheese on top, mix it in, and then add some more (I love cheese!)  I have made this recipe three times now, and these alterations were made only today, when I made it for a fourth time. I found that it was better than it had ever been like this! It was more flavorful and did not need extra salt. I also used rotini pasta instead of egg noodles, which was nice for texture.

I really enjoyed this.  It has been a recipe that I have done on my own in the past.  The sour cream does make it taste so creamy.  For those of you that like a bit more spice, try adding canned chopped chiles and chopped black olive. The browned onions give it good texture.  Thanks for printing the recipe for all to use!

Everyone in my family loved it. I thought it needed something, so I added some green beans and crunchy chow mein noodles to mine for texture. Then I loved it. Definately a keeper and so quick and easy. Will definately be making again. Thanks!

I wasn't raised on this kind of food and have never tried it before, so maybe that's why I don't like it.
Suggestions:
* Might be better with a tasty canned tuna.  I used a cheap plain one.
Changes:
* Used whole wheat spaghetti
* Added peas.
* Used yoghurt instead of sour cream.

This was pretty good although my toddler, who will normally try anything, wouldn't even touch it.  She thought it smelled bad.  It was pretty fishy, could be the low-fat soup and sour cream I used weren't enough of a match for the tuna.  I would have this again though, maybe with potatoes instead of noodles or ground turkey in place of the tuna.
