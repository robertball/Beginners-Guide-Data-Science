This gravy was a huge hit tonight at my house.  It was so simple and so delicious.  It was smokey, with a hint of sweet from the brown sugar glaze the was on the ham.  This will definitely be a new tradition in our home every Christmas.  Baked brown sugar ham with ham gravy!  I wish I could give it 6 stars :)

I LOOOVVEE this recipe. . Ham gravy is the best..I use corn starch when I don't have many drippings because I have found with using flour with small amounts of drippings it makes it taste starchy sometimes. But like he said you are missing out if you don't try this!!!

I grew up with another version that had 6 oz. pineapple juice and yellow mustard ( about a tsp) or however much you want. I use French's yellow mustard

So true that people don't make ham gravy ?   My mom and sisters always make it and its so easy. Ham drippings ,  corn starch, and maybe some extra beer to make enough so we don't fight over there not being enough

I make this most delicious and wonderful dish a little different.  I always use a 10-12 pound smoked picnic, substitute apple juice for pineapple juice, pin sliced pineapples to the ham with toothpicks and add 2 tsp dry yellow mustard.  My mom would make this dish for me the first Sunday I was home on leave overtime!  There is nothing better and the leftovers are just as good!!
If you haven't tried this dish, you simply must.

Yes I made one added a half teaspoon of ground cloves to the brown sugar before I rubbed it on the ham. I also think that it needed more time in the oven maybe 45 minutes. I am definitely going to make it again because every thing was wonderful and my family really enjoyed the gravy.

I'm sorry, but the gravy was inedible. The ham was fine but there wasn't really anything to it, just brown sugar. The gravy was really horrible, it may be that it's just not my taste but it was really weird. I had a couple of guests taste it before I served dinner and they all agreed it was not something they'd want so I quickly had to whip up another "regular" gravy. This one got tossed with no-one  liking it.

Not everyone at our Easter table loved it, but others said that it was the best ham and gravy that they've ever had.   I thought it was excellent and while I'm writing this review, mine is the only vote that counts.   I did coat the ham in a tablespoon of prepared mustard before the brown sugar because I was a little worried that it would be too sweet.   I'm glad I did this.   I think it was a perfect offset to the sweet.   I used a 10 pound bone and I cooked it in my electric pressure cooker for 52 minutes.   I also used 12 ounces of apple juice.  Thank you for a great recipe.
