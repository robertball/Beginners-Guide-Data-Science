Yellow mustard works fine in place of spicy ( dijon ) mustard. I used thin cut boneless chops--lightly dusted each one w/ "Smokehouse Maple" flavored seasoning before they went in a air-tight sealed bag of marinade for overnight stay in fridge. Impressed with the all-day smoker taste after a few minutes on gas BBQ grill. Novice griller chefs: If moisture is a concern, don't panic. pour pineapple juice in a small metal pan, place grilled chops in pan, pour enough more pineapple juice to just barely cover them--and seal tightly w/ foil, place in 250 degree oven for 7-10 minutes. Take chops out pan and allow them to rest for another 10 min. before serving.

We just made these tonight and it was the best pork chop I have ever had! I followed the recipe except I didn't have any mesquite seasoning, so used a regular grill seasoning blend instead. I had four smaller cut chops so did not butterfly. We grilled them after marinading about 4-5 hours and they were perfect!

Very easy to put together!  I marinated overnight for about 10 hours.  Pork chops were flavorful, moist, and tender.   Thanks for the recipe!

I did not use mesquite-flavored seasoning. I don't even know what it is. But I used all the other ingredients listed and the chops had a wonderful flavor.

This is a fantastic recipe!  I marinated some pork for only about an hour, and it was excellent. The rest of the pork I marinated overnight.  Instead of mesquite seasoning, though, I used sriracha sauce. Absolutely delicious!

This marinade is great.  Quick and easy.  I marinated my pork loin chops just over 2 hours.  Cooked them on the my Weber.  Grill time about 4-5 minutes a side - perfection and really tasty!!!  WOW!!

this was SO delicious! instead of two pork chops i used 4 thin bone in pork chops and regular mustard for the spicy brown like others did.. left out the sugar per usual.. used about 1/4 tsp ground thyme bc for the regular bc i always worry about how strong it can be.. i use montreal steak seasoning for the mesquite flavored seasoning all the time.. idk if that's anywhere close but i haven't had a mishap yet.. used fresh parsley for dried and mistakenly used table salt for kosher salt (doh!) but the chops still came out wonderful.. ty so much for this recipe

OK this marinade is really great. Better than I expected. I didn't have mesquite anything - no bbq anything either - I added a dash of cayenne and paprika. I have no idea what that did. I also didn't really measure anything out. Didn't have onion powder, so I chopped up some onions and added them. Used normal yellow mustard and red wine vinegar instead of white. Sauteed the chops in the sauce in a frying pan. Despite all my substitutions for lack of ingredients, it was absolutely delicious! Thanks for a great marinade.

This was delicious......the chops glazed nicely on the grill. I used apple cider vinegar  and like most people, I didn't have mesquite seasoning, and so I threw in a little Aleppo Pepper to add some zip.  Totally saved to use again......and again. Going to try it on shrimp next!

Yummy recipe w/ some adjustments to taste for next time.  I used ribeye boneless pork chops. Marinade for 7.5 hours.  I tripled the recipe and substituted Heinz 57 for mesquite seasoning.  They came out juicy off the grill, however Thyme overpowered the rest of the seasonings.  I'll reduce Thyme and olive oil the next time around.

Best Pork Chop Marinade Haiku: "Taste was delicious! Used a tenderloin, not chops. Easy, no fail, good." Didn't have mesquite seasoning, but otherwise, used all the ingredients as written, marinating a 2 lb. pork tenderloin for 6 hrs. b4 searing and finishing off in the oven, and then serving w/ a roasted vegg medley recipe that I'd found on AR as well. Very tender and flavorful, and surely just as tasty of a marinade on chops, roast, chicken etc..

I really liked this recipe a lot. I used it for the first time while in my RV (meaning I didn’t have the luxury of a fully loaded kitchen pantry!). That being said, I had to make a few tweeks as circumstances obliged. Instead of plain olive oil I used garlic infused olive oil. Instead of kosher salt I actually had applewood smoked sea salt (yum!), and instead of the white wine vinegar I had cherry balsamic vinegar (another yum!). I would probably use a balsamic even if I had white wine vinegar just cuz I prefer it. Anyway, the rest was basically the same. The chops I used were thick cut chops but they did have a bone so I ended up de-boning them first so I could butterfly them. In the end I just would use thinner cut pork chops. Easier! The outcome was an extremely juicy and very flavorful dinner! The night before we spent $90 at a local steakhouse and this dinner (with a very simple Caesar salad and fresh veggies) was head and shoulders better! Mmmmmmm (my husbands contribution to this review!) I will definitely be saving this recipe to my favorites so that I can outdo the steakhouse yet again!

This was good the first night, and exceptional after leaving the chops in for 48 hours!  The spicy mustard & brown sugar charred bits from the grill were amazing!

I made it with regular yellow mustard and it came out perfectly. Also, I didn't have white wine vinegar because I'm a poor med student so I just used regular sad white vinegar. It came out great though. I paired it with sautéed veggies and hence the 5 stars. Will make it again.

Love it. Other than the part asking for mesquite seasoning idk where you found that but i couldn't find it at the grocery store. Used a "smoky" flavored steak seasoning instead. Anyway I've done similar marinades to this before but without the
mustard... But the mustard absolutely sets this marinade off.  Make sure you use good mustard when you make this. I saw someone reviewing this saying it had no real flavor and id bet it's because they used low quality mustard. I used grey poupon mustard and it came through ever so perfectly. I'm usually not a big fan of mustard but how it's used in this marinade is perfect and separates it from other pork chop marinades using oil/vinegar/lemon juice/Worcestershire sauce that I've tried before. I'm saving this in my bookmarks and will definitely make it many times in the future

Delicious!  Made this for a large dinner party and got rave reviews. I used thick-cut pork chops, bone-in, and grilled them over charcoal. The flavor from this marinade is fantastic. Not too obvious, but unique. They marinated for about 10 hours and it was perfect. But maybe longer would be even tastier?  Will try that next time.

I love making this recipe. I make up the marinade with Italian seasoning instead of thyme and fajita marinade instead of the mesquite seasoning and it is perfect every time. Instead of marinating the chops I put frozen chops in the crockpot and pour the marinade over it. Let it cook on low for 6 hours and it smells amazing in the house all day

I used this marinade in two parts - with pork chops and with boneless chicken breasts that I had cut in half.  Ran out of Dijon, so used regular mustard.  My family raved about it - will definitely use it again!

I used this marinade and pretty much made it exactly like the recipe.  The best part is I saved just a little bit of the marinade and brushed it on asparagus before grilling both and the asparagus was just as great as the pork chops.  I'm going to try the marinade with brussel sprouts next, the asparagus was so good I'm sure that will be good as well.

I cooked them on my grill after 8hours in the marinade. the chops were juicy and flavorful, they glazed up nicely thanks to the brown sugar. I would add a touch more salt and some more lemon juice next time, just to help tenderize the meat a little more, i also used apple cider vinegar instead of white whine vinegar. Even my wife who doesn’t like pork chops are her whole serving. Great marinade, worked very well with a hot seer on the grill.

I have made this twice so far. It really is the "Best Pork Chop Marinade" Followed the recipe except for the mesquite seasoning. I left if out both times. There is more than enough flavour in this marinade without it. Truly an excellent combinations of flavours .

Amazing marinade.  I seared on stove-top, two minutes each side, then finished at 350' in the oven for 15 minutes.

I made the marinade with a few changes as I didn't have all the ingredients! I used Cajun grill seasoning in place of  mesquite, a few drops of lime instead of lemon, balsamic and apple cider vinegar instead of white wine vinegar. Lastly I added some bourbon to add flavor and thin out the sugar. Was delicious!!

I just wanted a marinade for chops and then BBQ sauce them. I tasted this marinade before I put chops in and now I don't think I will use BBQ sauce it was so good.

I needed a marinade for my chops and happened to find this one. I marinated the chops in the morning to make in the evening. An unexpected rain storm prevented us from barbecuing,and was forced to broil them. They were very delicious! I had to substitute red wine vinegar for the white,and use a German beer flavor mustard for the brown spicy called for in this recipe. Still, it turned out,and we'll be looking forward to using this marinade for chops on the outdoor grill.

WAY too much thyme. If I made it again, I'd use maybe 1/2 tsp instead of 2 tsp.

My family loved this - I didn't even have a chance to marinate it but only a couple of hours. Even a non-meat eater really liked it. I've already had requests to make it again. I used apple cider vinegar because I didn't have the wine vinegar

The absolute best pork chop marinade I've ever used. We've used this for several dinner parties and everyone raves and wants to know what we did. I use it exactly as its laid out but add a little extra garlic. JT

Fantastic flavor! I used 2" boneless pork - did not split in half. I did not have mesquite seasoning so I used smoked paprika. Used Dijon mustard b/c it is what I had and, due to a review, I cut the thyme by half.  I marinated in bag for 5 hrs and grilled in oven for time recommended according to size of pork. It was tasty and very tender and very juicy. 
This recipe is a definite keeper. I will absolutely make this again and again!!

Made this a couple of nights ago and it was delicious.  My husband said, “ This is a keeper.” So when he says that I know it’s a good recipe.  Thanks for  the recipe Beth Anne923.  I only used 1 tbs of brown sugar as I’m trying to watch my sugar. And it was still awesome.

Love this marinade!  The flavor was awesome and the only thing I will change is to add another 1/2 teaspoon of salt.  That’s just because I like salt, lol.  The spices melded perfectly together.

Skipped the mesquite seasoning.  Cooked it in the sous vide for 2 hours at 129 degrees then seared it on the grill.  Thick bone in pork chops turned out perfect

Great recipe.  The flavor was A + .  I ended up tripling the recipe and marinated 6 pork chops overnight in the fridge.  We have no grill so I broiled them (about 8 minutes on each side - they were thick chops) and put the marinade on top each time I turned the chops.
I'd make this again in a heart beat.

I used this recipe as a map of sorts substituting based on what I had in the cabinet. I did not have white wine vinegar. I used distilled white vinegar. Did not used mesquite-flavoring. Used avocado oil instead of olive. used garlic salt, forgot the thyme (that's a shame because that would have been a nice addition). Used GF soy sauce instead of worcestershire  sauce.

This recipe is amazing, my pork chops were juicy and tender with an awesome flavour. Even my hubby loved it and asked to make sure I kept this recipe in my "special" recipe binder. WOW. This is definitely going into our regular rotation. 

The only substitutions that I made were because of a lack of ingredients were 1/2 oregano because I didn't have quite enough thyme, dried minced garlic instead of fresh garlic, and I unfortunately was not able to BBQ because of poor winter conditions. So I baked it in the oven.  Thank you BethAnne923

I am so glade I made this recipe  as written, however I used smoked paprika in place of the mesquite seasoning.
It was DELICIOUS! I broiled the chops in the oven because it was raining outside but I imagine they would be phenomenal on the grill. Plan to use for chicken as well. Very good!

This was delicious! I made this twice. The 1st time when I made it, I dumped all the marinade in the pan and as you can see in the pic I posted, it got a bit burned. However, the marinade got caramelized and it came out awesome! Yesterday, I cooked the marinade separately in a small pan. It was still good but I think I like the caramelized version better. It has a lot of ingredients but they're all something I already have in the fridge and pantry so I will definitely make this again. Thanks!

Was a bit skeptical but we had gotten some pork chops on sale so I decided to try it.     Did not use the mesquite flavoring but I doubt it mattered.    Not only were they fabulous the first time, but the leftovers were just as good.

We marinated a pork tenderloin.  The only change we made is that we did not have mesquite seasoning.  I replaced with a different seasoning and red pepper paste.  The tenderloin was sooooo juicy.  My other favorite is Bada Bing pork chops so it will be hard to choose which and when to use both of these, but I will!  Over and over again!

I made this as the recipe called, except I left out the Worcestershire because I'm allergic to fish.  It was amazing.  We threw these butterflied chops on the grill and the flavor was just right.  We will be making this again.  Might even try it on chicken thighs!  Thanks for sharing!!

I made this last night for hubby and myself and it was delish! Like others, I had to substitute a couple of ingredients, but nothing major. I didnt have brown sugar so subbed in pure maple syrup (no maple flavor was noted), used Dijon instead of spicy brown mustard, and left out the mesquite flavoring. The marinade was still lovely and the thick cut pork chops came out with a wonderful flavor and moist (I grilled mine on the barbecue). I’ll use this recipe again!

Very good marinade but was a little sweet for me. The next time I decreased the brown sugar by a third and increased thyme and added a little white wine. Was excellent.

Cooked the pork chops low and slow on the grill. Turned out so delicious that I'm making the recipe again this weekend.

I loved this marinade and so did my family. I didn’t have onion powder so I used onions. I didn’t have mesquite seasoning so I threw in a tablespoon of adobe sauce from a recently opened can of chipotle peppers. I marinated it overnight and the meat was very tender.

All I can say is AWESOME!!!! Was looking for a different way to prepare pork chops,  stumbled upon this recipe and so vey happy I did.   I didn't have the dijon mustard so used yellow mustard (as i saw many others did) and it was fine.   The only thing I will change next time is cut the thyme  by half,  it was a bit overpowering but if you like it strong you will be fine.  Definitely a keeper. Can't way to try on chicken!!!!!

Very flavorful marinade. I only had a few hours so I marinated the pork chops for 2 hours and then pan fried. Sill came out great. I will try grilling when it warms up outside.

We really enjoyed this.  I only marinated for about 3 hours and we cooked them on the BBQ.  Cooked just till done then rested in foil for about 5 min.  They were very juicy and tender.  Would make again for sure.

Best tasting pork chops I've ever made!!! Outstanding flavor!  I substituted only 2 ingredients to accomodate what I had on hand: 1) yellow mustard in place of spicy brown, 2) Grillmates Maple Smokehouse seasoning instead of the mesquite.  Thanks for the inspiration!

I have yet to make it but love the sound of it. I will make this with "Butterfly" pork chops, already cut because my usual local store does not sell thick enough pork chops to attempt to slice.

Can you say "Yummy"! Did these on the grill and one of the best tasting pork chops I've made.
I did make 2 small substitutions though.
Instead of the Mesquite seasoning I used 1/2 tsp Mesquite liquid smoke. Didn't want to be overpowering. Might increase the liquid smoke by 1/4 tsp next time. Also, used aged (the key word here is AGED), balsamic vinegar in place of the white wine vinegar.

Nice flavor. Grilled the pork chops, and although they ended up a bit overcooked, the marinade helped to retain some of the moisture. Will make this again for sure.

This was fabulous.  I used chipotle powder in place of the mesquite and Dijon mustard.  I had two very thick pork porterhouse steaks and only marinated them about two hours.  Cooked on high on the grill 3-4 minutes each side and they were perfect.  My family loved it so much they want it once a week.

I made this as written except I did not have any mesquite seasoning or spicy mustard. I did use yellow mustard as others did and it turned out just great. I butterflied my 2 thick boneless chops and marinated several hours. They turned out so tender and moist and had a great flavor. I served them with sautéed green beans with chopped onion and mushroom and a side of mashed sweet potatoes and we had the most awesome dinner ever!!! Can't wait to make this meal again. We grilled them 5 minutes per side and that was perfect timing although the chops could have been a bit browner, but couldn't have tasted better. A real keeper. Thanks BethAnne

Quick and simple marinade. Tasty too. I only put in 2T of brown sugar. Probably won't put any in next time. I don't think it needs it. Will definitely use this recipe again. It takes plain pork to new heights.

I didn't have the liquid smoke and the white wine vinegar.  I substituted balsamic vinegar instead, this turned out very nice! I will be using this marinade a lot!

Loved these chops! I did the recipe for 4 chops and it was the perfect amount for my 8 small chops. I used Epicure French onion mix instead of the onion powder...and Montreal steak spice instead of the other spice listed...and they were great! Will definitely use this recipe again.

This is really tasty!  I marinated them about an hour and baked them in the marinade. Kids loved it too.  In fact, I started liking pork chops because of this recipe. I didn't have mesquite seasoning so I added a bit of smoked paprika. Definitely is my new go-to pork marinade. I can't wait to try it on the grill after a longer marinade!

This is one of the best pork chop marinades I've ever had. The only change I made was adding about a 1/4 tsp. of rosemary. Absolutely loved this, recommend it to anyone making pork chops.

This was excellent as written but I didn't have mesquite seasoning but used liquid smoke once and just used a chipotle seasoning and they both worked well.

I thought this was a great recipe, but I didn't have mesquite flavored seasoning so I used a different seasoning instead.  Other than that I kept everything the same and the pork turned out very tender and yummy!

Excellent flavor and easy to put together in just a few minutes. I doubled the marinade for some boneless center-cut (thick) pork chops and let them sit in the fridge for 6 hours before throwing them on the grille. Outstanding taste!

Excellent flavor! It's well worth putting a few minutes into making this marinade. I didn't have mesquite and will try to find it before making this again, but everybody enjoyed this very much.

Very nice.  I used this on about 6 small pork chops that hubs grilled for Memorial Day.  I marinated them overnight and they turned out excellent.  Very flavorful, and hubs didn't even complain about the brown mustard in this.  Surprisingly, I had everything on this list in the house so I didn't change anything.  Thanks for the recipe!

Excellent marinade.   Came out perfect.   I found that this was enough for four small chops.   I used a vacuum sealer marinade attachment to speed up the marinade time and that worked great for this recipe.

Delicious! I was feeling lazy so I used garlic powder instead of chopped garlic cloves. I didn't have any lemon juice so I used water instead. I cooked the pork chops in the George Foreman grill.

Absolutely awesome! I used 2 rib pork chops and cooked them on the George Foreman grill- wonderful flavor! I will certainly use this recipe again. It would be great on steak as well, I think!

This was awesome! I used the recipe almost exactly as shown, only substituting the mesquite seasoning for BBQ sauce since I didn't have any.  Was super simple to make and will definitely serve this again and again.
