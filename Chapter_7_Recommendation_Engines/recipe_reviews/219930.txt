This salad is amazing and has great layers of flavor!  I believe this is in part due to the pimento peppers - which are fantastic.  The celery and roasted corn are also key.  This salad is also very easy to make and healthy.  If you need something great to bring to a summer BBQ - bring this!

This was very good.  This makes a lot of salad - way more than 6 servings I would estimate.

Yummy. No husks on corn, so sprayed with Pam and grilled slowly, turning often. Don't like bell pepper- didn't miss it -  added  a little more celery. Out of Balsamic, so used red wine vinegar. Still really good. It definitely improves AFTER 24 hours.  Will make again for sure!
