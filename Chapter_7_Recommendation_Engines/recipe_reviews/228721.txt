Patty the ONLY reason I am giving this 4 stars is b/c I couldn't find the limeade. I used lemon-lime Kool-Aid and Lemonade vodka instead. I put everything in the blender along with some Splenda-1/4 c. & ice. Boy Oh Boy was it Tasty!! The color is as you can see Perfect! Thank You so very much Patty2007 for such a Fun drink!! Hope you like my little drinking buddies they have been in the family for Years!! LOL
