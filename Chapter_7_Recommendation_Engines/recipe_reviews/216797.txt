So long since I have had this pie or even heard of it.  This is a great recipe and, like another reviewer mentioned, prefer it with a regular pie crust.   When whipping egg white adding a pinch of cream of tartar keeps them from weeping. I do this with lemon meringue pies and it works.

Delicious and beautiful!  I think I would make this with a regular pie crust next time because it was a bit sweeter than I'd like, but overall it turned out lovely.  I did use a different meringue that's no bake - it had more sugar in it than this recipe so that's probably the difference.

Great recipe, thankyou. I'm Aussie but I make this for my Ukranian-Canadian stepfather - he loves it. Its his birthday today and he likes this as a birthday cake lol so I'm checking out recipes to see if I can improve on the one I have currently. 
I usually leave the sugar out of the crust.  Us Aussies don't add excess sugar to crumb crusts with sweet baking as a rule. I also use a good pinch of cream of tartar in the egg whites to stop weeping. I wish I could find a recipe for a firmer custard - this pie never cuts cleanly. Still, its very popular in my house. I can't get Aussie's to enjoy it, its a bit too different for our tastes, but I like it.

Terrible - meringue started on fire.. after 1 minute.. then after removing and baking meringue (nicely browned) custard did not set.  So. Flapper soup. Pass.

I think this recipe assumes a pretty advanced baker is doing this and doesn't explain some tips/tricks that would've helped. My filling did not set well and my meringue burnt (other reviewers appear to report the same). When I spoke to people who have made pies like this, they had some advice that would've helped, like letting it set in the fridge, pipe the meringue so it goes on more evenly, etc, etc

If I made it again I would add more egg whites to the merangue.

The custard was awesome but never, never put a merangue under a broiler.....it will cook too quickly and burn the tips then come out all shriveled when it cools.

I used a 10 inch pie plate - smallest I have - and I had some filling left over.  And  have NEVER heard of broiling a merengue ( no wonder people had issues with it burning ) so I just baked it as I have always done with them.  Perfect results as usual.

Slightly less cinnamon, and it was perfect! Let it cool in the fridge overnight and it was magnificent the next day

this is my husband's favourite pie, and he loves it. The only change I made was that I did not put cinnamon in the custard. The cinnamon in the crust gives enough flavor. This is a great recipe

Just came out of the oven and waiting for it to cool.  The custard is lovely, but I would reduce the amount of butter in the crust.  It was too much and would reduce it by half. Will try again with the reduction but I think it will be tasty.
