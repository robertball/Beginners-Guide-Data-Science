The recipe had good taste except the tortilla chips got too soggy. Is there a way to thicken the sauce? I boiled mine for 15 minutes. I also used Red Hot Sauce but not enough.

Very good but way too soupy! I would cut the tomato juice down to 2 cups next time. I also seasoned the beef and onions with cumin chili powder and cayenne pepper while it cooked. We used it on top of tortilla chips and as a burrito filling. I used the other half of the onion as a garnish on top with the cheese and a little sour cream.

Not hot enough. And we wish that we had not poured the mixture over the chips but rather used it as a dip. It is good though.
