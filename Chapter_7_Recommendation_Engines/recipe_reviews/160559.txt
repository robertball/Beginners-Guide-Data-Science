This recipe turned out great! I added about 3/4 cup of cider vinegar, as well as a lot more salt, a dash of soy sauce and let the brisket marinate overnight (not wrapped). Instead of water, I used a bottle of corona. My family LOVED this recipe!

It wasn't horrible, but if you prefer horseradish to mustard this is not the recipe for you.  The texture was nice.  I gave this recipe a two star rating, because it was middle of the road considering I don't give anything a five unless it really blows me away probably twice in my life.

Not enough of corned beef taste. Made the mistake of trying because I thought it might save me the cost of buying real corned beef bust it was a waste of my money. I stick to packaged corned beef cooked exactly as they wrote it in SLOW COOKED CORNED BEEF FOR SANDWICHES on this sight.

OMG this was DELICIOUS!!! The only thing I did differently was to dump everything in the slow cooker right off the bat and leave it overnight.  I also used a raw store bought corned beef brisket.

I've been making Corn beef and cabbage for quite some time now and this recipe is a great twist. It is a very good change from the normal boiled dinner that Corn beef is. Thanks

Loved it!  My husband and I really enjoyed this.  I did not allow the marinade to sit over night.  Next time I will definately do this.  I think it will be much better.

I added some new potatoes and baby carrots with the cabbage.  Although I should have cooked the potatoes and carrots longer, the microwave saved them.  Entire dinner was a great success.  Thank you for sharing this great recipe!

I made it according to directions except for the pickling salt. Dad is on a very low salt diet. So I used some Kosher salt 1 tsp. even still it was good. The meat was coming apart with my large slotted spoon in the crock pot.  Now that I know how everything is together, I can adjust the other ingredients in the paste for more umph in the flavor. Best even though it takes a couple days before cooking; it's only minutes out of your day for the prep work.

Used Chicken Broth instead of water and my family loved it!  It was our St. Patty's Day dinner.  My brother said that he was glad that it had flavor unlike most Irish dishes and the three year old drank the broth out of a cup!  I also used "Creole Mustard" it was a little more coarse than Dijon and lacked the citric acid that I found listed in the Dijon mustard ingredients.  Added extra salt and regretted it.   Saved some of the marinade for a condiment,  but the broth was SO good that it didn't matter.

I made this and another recipe side by side to compare. Hands down this was the best by far! You really  cannot go wrong with this. I did cook my carrots and cabbage separately from both corned beef so I could judge and rate the recipes solely on the difference in the meat. This is excellent!
