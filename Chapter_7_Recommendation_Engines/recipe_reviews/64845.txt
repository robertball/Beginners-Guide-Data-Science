This is a rating review from my daughter Emily who made this recipe. We had to do a couple of tweeks. To help this recipe be a success for her. I only helped her when she got a little confused on why it looked like shredded cheese with mayo and pimento. So here's the adjustment. We took out a hand mixer to break down the cheese and get it like the bought version you get at the local grocery store...This helped a lot. It lacked something, but didn't add salt or pepper, we added 1/2 tsp of paprika and to Emily's taste it worked. She was so proud of her self that, she wants to make this again.

I used half regular sharp cheddar, half sharp white cheddar cheeses and added a couple good shakes of Frank's Hot Sauce. I made no other changes. PURE comfort food. The kids and I can't get enough of this.

This was my frist attempt ever at making pimento cheese.  I haven't actually had the stuff since I was a child, and it was always the stuff from the store.  I have  alot of jarred pimentos from my summer garden and decided to make this for a party.  I doubled the recipe and made it exactly as written.  I did not measure out the full one cup of mayo, I just added it a little at a time until it was how I wanted it.  Like the first reviewer I used a hand mixer to help incorporate the cheese.  I did use a block of extra sharp cheddar and shredded it myself, since I have read that the bagged shredded is no good for this kind of recipe.  I did also add some of the juice from the peppers, just to add more flavor.  Just a few splashes, maybe 3 or so tbsp of it.  This was WONDERFUL! I love it!  This will definitely be made again!

My mom makes her pimento cheese just like this...uses light mayo occasionally. The consistency is just like I remembered when she made it...perfect! I added a few shots of (Louisiana) hot sauce for a little kick. Yum!

Great recipe. I was raised on pimento cheese in NC, favorite was Stan's Pimento Cheese in Burlington.  I put two jars of pimento in the one I make, never enough of the pimentos.

Delicious!  I used this as a sandwich spread and it was so tasty.  I jazzed it up a bit with a touch of mustard, and sprinkle of onion powder, and a pinch of cayene for a little heat.  Just threw everything in the blender for a smoother spread.  I'll definitely use this again.  Thanks for sharing this versitile recipe, Rhonda.

A teaspoon of garlic was WAY TOO MUCH. If you try this recipe, do not add a full teaspoon. It overpowered every other flavor in the pimento cheese. I couldn't even taste the pimento.

I thought this recipe was delicious.  I just started eating pimento cheese in the last few years.  My husband bought me a food processor for Christmas, so I was anxious to make my own pimento cheese.  VERY good and simple too.  We eat ours with pretzels, its addicting.

I've made this several times just as the recipe reads, didn't do any adjusting.  I grated the cheese myself and mixed it by hand.  The longer it sits in the refrigerator the better it is. I wouldn't change a thing.

I agree with an earlier commenter that there is a touch too much garlic.  Other than that, it was great.  The second time I made it, I switched the cheddar for pepperjack cheese.  If you like a little heat, this is terrific as well.

Yummy!! The garlic adds another subtle dimension to the flavors. I used sharp 2% cheddar and mild 2% cheddar (half and half) shredded in a food processor.  Think I could eat the whole bowl now, but will try to hold out for lunch of a toasted Hearty Nut Bread (bread machine) sammich with home-grown tomato slices!

I added onion powder and substituted half of the mayo for miracle whip (just a personal preference).  My hubby who doesn't even like store bought pimento cheese liked this recipe.

Thanks, John 
My wife loves this receipt, she only wanted to add sliced olives with pimentos.  I goes great with her packed lunch and some assorted crackers.

This was very good.  I used a combination of sharp cheddar, and a soft cheese like Velveeta.  It was easy to prepare and my family loved it.

Needed seasonings, some cream cheese, yogurt or sour cream for texture.  Just OK.

Easy to make recipe for a southern classic. I've made it many times for family and friends. I've noticed the the flavor is stronger if it is refrigerated over night.

Excellent! I grew up on homemade pimento cheese and it is easy to adjust the amount of garlic according to your personal taste. I think any cheese will do except Velvetta. I prefer a mixture of cheddar & white myself. Enjoy...

I just made half of this recipe because it’s just my husband and I. We thought it needed a little salt and pepper plus a tablespoon of sugar. We ate the whole thing in one day so I made another batch. We get tired of chicken salad so I’m adding this to our rotation of lunches or light dinners. I didn’t grow up eating this but I love it! It’s great on white bread, saltines or pita chips!

Loved the simplicity of this recipe, and the fact that it does not call for cream cheese, which I find too bland in a good pimento cheese. However, 1 tsp. of garlic powder was far too much. The second time I made this, I substituted 2 tsp. of finely grated onion, a pinch of cayenne and a good sprinkle of fresh-ground black pepper, and it was just right. (FYI: Duke's mayonnaise, y'all, unless you make your own.)

Super easy and a good flavor. My husband really liked it; however, the fairly significant garlic aftertaste not so much to my liking. Still, that wasn’t a deal breaker and I would make it again.

This was my first attempt at pimento cheese.  I was happy with the way it turned out except that it was a bit sharper than I expected.  Based on some other reviews I had scaled back the Garlic to half a teaspoon.  I will be use a less sharp cheese in my next batch.

I cut the recipe in half just to try it. The only adjustment made was that I used less garlic powder for our taste. My husband and I loved it! Great on crackers and celery. I will make the full recipe next time for sure, and look forward to making it for family and friends.
