Wow, LAGIRL, you have really outdone yourself! This dish is incredible! The only changes are I used spiral pasta, and romano cheese instead of parmesan. By the way, for those of you who substitute chili powder, it's not quite the same as the paste (though if you don't have/can't find the paste, it should work). It's thick and spicy, and really enhances the flavor for the chicken. I found mine in the produce section of Ultra Foods (I would assume it'd be in the same place as other major grocery stores. I had never heard of chili paste before until I accidentally stumbled upon it and realized what it was.) They are in squeeze tubes, near the fresh herbs. Look for it, because the paste makes all the difference! Wonderful, wonderful recipe! Hands down, a keeper!

I love anything with pesto and cheese so this was already a winner but adding vegetables (zucchini, mushrooms, red pepper, green pepper, onions), a bit of garlic and white wine was a huge plus to making it more nutritionally balanced and full flavoured...

I make this all the time! It's easy and tastes excellent. Couldn't find chili paste but chili powder works just as well!

I changed and added a few things to this recipe and made it a 5 star but I think just the way it is would've been a little plain for me so I gave it a 4 stars. I used 3/4 of a pound of fresh shrimp instead of chicken. I also added one red bell pepper, fresh mushrooms and a can of diced tomates. Instead of just 6 Tablespoons of pesto sauce, I used the whole small jar that they have in the spaghetti aisle and I added the 4 oz. of goat cheese at the end. Also, the chili paste that I used I found in the Asian food aisle of the grocery store and it was called Roasted Chili Paste. Not sure it that is the same stuff that the recipe called for but it gave it a little kick and a nice flavor. Very good recipe with a few changes and additions.

***UPDATE***  Just made this again the other night, used diced up chicken breasts, red bell pepper, red onion and diced tomatoes. Instead of goat cheese this time, I used 8 oz of reduced fat cream cheese with the pesto sauce and 3/4 cup of half and half. The cream cheese helped the pesto coat the pasta better. It was FABULOUS!!! This recipe is so easy to play with.

This was excellent.  I added zucchini and sauteed mushrooms and quite a bit more pesto.  My guests commented that it tasted like a dish from "an Italian restaurant," one of the highest compliments.  Be sure to adapt it to your liking, it's great!

This was "TDF", to die for.  I did make some suggested changes that resulted in the TDF rating. I did not have cilantro, so I used parsley. (Wife doesn't like cilantro!)
I also substituted Bella Cucina Artful Food's Sun-dried Tomato Pesto. I increased the chili paste to 1 1/2 Tbs.  (Sambal Oklek brand) Absolutely wonderful!

I love this pasta.  I can't tell you how many people I have made it for and they all love it.  When I make it just for me I go very spicy, but for company I cut back on the spice.  For the chili paste I use Sambal.  I wouldn't change a thing.  For those that don't like this recipe you must of thought you liked pesto and hot spicy food?  This is that and for me couldn't get any better.  
Thanks  LAGIRL!

great recipe!  I used chili powder, and added mushrooms, garlic, and sun-dried tomatoes as others suggested. I also added half and half.  I will make this again and will try with pine nuts.

My husband and I thought it was OK.  Too much pesto, and the pasta would be oily; tried to cut down on the oil, and the pasta was too dry.

This was an incredible dish. I added a bit more pesto to it than was recommended. It's quick, it's simple and it tastes amazing. No complaints from any of my attentive critics

I would make this again and again!!  It turned out to be so much better than I anticipated. I used chili powder and cayenne pepper instead of chile paste. Along with chicken I also added some shrimp, peas, and broccoli. Chicken turned out to be a bit dry, but the shrimps were succulent and well-seasoned. Also, I added some reserved, salted pasta water to the dish and it created creamy, cheesy sauce. oh, I omitted cilantro.   Now I'm really curious how the dish would taste with chile paste.

Very tasty item. Both my son and I enjoyed it. I also tweaked it a bit by adding mushrooms and carrots. Next time I'll add zucchini since I didn't have any this time. I simmered the chicken on a low flame a little longer while I covered the skillet. It helps the chicken absorb the chili flavor while keeping it moist. Definitely a good spice to the dish.

Wow, this was great. I'm a novice cook and so far, this recipe has had the most flavor of everything I've made. I added 1/2 of a large red onion and several cloves of garlic (mostly to get rid of those items, they'd been sitting in my fridge for a while). Next time I make it I'll use a different type of pasta just to experiment. Thanks for the recipe, it's a keeper!

This is a tasty recipe and we'll repeat. Use whatever kind of pasta you prefer to eat. We used cavatappi and enjoyed it very much, but there's no reason you couldn't use anything else.

Other than the type of pasta, we made no alterations. We found this to be both flavorful and spicy, even though some reviewers found it be neither. The quality of the chili paste may play a role. We used the Huy Fong stuff and found one tablespoon to be perfect. It gave it a nice kick, and any more probably would have been too much.

I'll note that since this recipe doesn't have a traditional "sauce", the leftovers will dry out pretty quickly. By the next day the re-heated extras were decidedly disappointing. Best to eat it while it's hot and fresh!

This initially came out a little more bland than I was expecting (though I was a bit short on the basil pesto). If anyone else has this problem, try adding salt and cayenne pepper to taste. It helped to bring out the flavors and gave it the kick I was expecting.

A REAL KEEPER!!! after reading several reviews I made a few changes that suit my tastes; when cooking the chicken I added a TBSP of minced garlic, then after the chicken was just about done I added 8oz of sliced fresh mushrooms. From there I followed the recipe exactly, and added toasted pine nuts for presentation. I really couldn't taste the cilantro but it added nice color. I'll keep it in the recipe as it came out so good removing anything could mess it up. This recipe is perfect for company, as you can cut / measure everything in advance and then in 15 minutes (while enjoying a glass of wine) you can prepare this in front of everyone and they will be impressed!!!
Cheers!!!

This is absolutely my favorite recipe so far on AR.  I make this every time we have company and I have yet to come across one person who doesn't love it.  While it is perfect as is, you can easily adjust it to your personal taste.  Add or subtract the chile paste, cheese, and/or pesto to your liking.  If you want a one-dish meal, add some veggies.  I suggest making extra as well since it makes great leftovers.

This recipe is deliscious and very easy to make, i substituted the cilantro with sun dried tomato and added roasted pine nuts and the taste was very rustic. I cooked it for my family and they loved it. It's a very good recipe and don't be afraid to add what you like in pasta, for me this is going in my recipe box.

This was excellent and so easy to throw together.  The only change I made was I chopped up some zucchini and threw it in there with the chicken while it cooked.  I think next time I'll also add some bell pepper.  Awesome recipe and will for sure make it again.  Thanks!

We love this dish.  It's especially a great last-minute meal to throw together with some store-bought pesto and rotisserie chicken.  Followed the suggestion of another reviewer and added some onion, zucchini, green pepper, & white wine which really gives it an even better flavor.  I also sometimes substitute half butter for the olive oil.

Ok, made this recipe again, with the following mods:  sauted chicken in garlic and white wine along with three tbs chili paste (we like it hot);  added green and red peppers and zuccini.  I thought I was cooking for three, SEVEN ended up showing up so upped the chicken and pasta content(me, hubby and five picky teens)  Sigh...... no leftovers for tomorrow -- seems it was a resounding success!  :(  === Wonderful Taste!    However, the cilantro wasn't a hit.... was one too many flavours

Very good dish! Full of flavor. I didn't have the hot chile paste so I used hot pepper flakes to taste. Not a saucy dish, which is a nice change.

Really easy to make and tastes delicious. Perfect for busy worknight. I took others suggestions and used the artichokes, sun dried tomatos, and mushrooms, i chopped them all up and tossed them in the salad. Yummy, thanks for sharing this!

This is by far my favorite pasta dish. I've always loved pesto, and this recipe is so easy to make. I added mushrooms, and use more chili paste (I like it spicy!) Other than that, this recipe is perfect!!!!

Stunning, loved it. Added red bell peppers to the recipe but apart from that followed it to the letter.

Will enjoy playing around with this recipe and adding something different each time.

This was awesome! Very quick to make and very tasty too. I used Srirachi sauce and it was perfect for the adults. A little too spicy for my son tho, so if you have kids you might want to use a little less than called for. Toasted some garlic bread in the oven and it made for a delicious meal!

I saved this recipe and finally made it last night.  I followed the directions completely and we both loved it.  Next time I might add some fresh mushrooms or sun dried tomatoes...maybe not as it's easy and oh so good!

I love this recipe! It's very quick and simple to make for those who want something delicious and fast. I use SRIRACHA chili sauce and it gives the chicken a nice red color. I also use more pesto as I like more sauce to cover all the pasta and the chicken. My boyfriend and I really enjoy this.

This turned out awesome, although I admit I altered it a tiny bit.  I didn't feel like there was enough chicken so I increased it to one and a half pounds for the 1 pound of pasta.  I couldn't find fresh chili paste so I bought red garlic chili paste in the Asian section of the grocery store which tasted fantastic (I think the garlic made it even better!).  The only thing I added was about 1/2 container (maybe a cup and a half?) of light sour cream to make it into a creamy pesto dish and the tartness of the sour cream really melded perfectly with all of the other flavors.  The spice wasn't too hot (but it is noticeable) so I think it will go over well for the potluck I'm bringing it to but making it for myself I might increase the heat just a little more.  Really great flavor and it tastes impressive,  like something you'd get at a nice restaurant!

My husband and I LOVE this dish.  I only use about 75% of the pasta it calls for and I add a little extra chile paste.  When I don't have chile paste, I use garlic chile sauce.  Definitely needs salt & pepper added to it!

This was very simple to make. I did make some changes. I used chili powder instead of looking for the paste. I used chopped cilantro leaves instead of purchasing fresh ones and cutting it up. I also added shrimp to the pasta and garlic bread as a side. It didn't take long at all to make. After finishing up, I did have to add a bit of season salt before the flavor was very bland. After that it was quite delicious.

We've made this twice now. The first time, according to instructions. Last night, we sauteed the chicken in white wine and then went with one reviewer's suggestion and added cream cheese & half and half (also mixed in baby green peas at the end)...This recipe is simple, adaptable and Delish!

Add sundried tomatoes + garlic.  Use Sriracha instead of chile paste.  Will try with veggies next time!  My fiance told me this was the best pasta dish he's ever had :)

Loved this!!  I made just like the recipe - except I added red onions when cooking the chicken - then added a few TBS of sour cream at the end just to make it a little creamy.  Served with salad and garlic bread.  Will be using this as a "go to recipe"!  :)

I made this last night and the only thing I left out was the cilantro (only because I forgot it at the store) it was awesome! My hubby is not usually a fan of spicy food, but he loved it. It wasn't super spicy,  just had a nice kick to it. Definitely add the goat cheese at the end!

My husband & I really enjoyed this recipe.  It was quick, easy and yummy.  I did make a few changes, but not many.  Since we don't eat meat, I used Trader Joe's Soy Chicken.  We like pesto, so I added more.  I also sautéed some onions and added some defrosted peas at the end.  Yum!  Will make this again.

This was great, perfect amount of heat.  Chili Powder is not the same as Hot Chili Paste and I would not recommend this subsitiution.  I have never made anything with pesto before so this was fun AND my daughter loved it.

We really liked this recipe.  I think next time we will use a little more chili paste, we like it spicy around here.  But this one is definately a keeper.  Even the leftovers were great the next day!

This was amazing! I added two minced cloves of garlic to the chicken while it was cooking, and half a minced shallot. Nearly doubled the chili sauce as we like it spicy! When the chicken was nearly done I added a chopped zucchini and half a chopped green pepper for added nutrition. Served with pine nuts on top and shredded parmesan cheese. Delicious!

WONDERFUL as written!!  The chili paste is a must.  I found it in the produce section with the fresh herbs.  Everyone in my family loved it, and we sent leftovers to school with the kids the next day.  My son is notoriously picky, and he LOVED it.  I will make this again and again.  Thanks for the great recipe.

Thanks, Teena for a quick and very tasty chicken breast and pasta dish. For  three servings, I adjusted the recipe accordingly and added a jar of  marinated and drained artichoke hearts, halved. I also added a splash of white wine instead of more pesto for additional moisture.I only had high fiber, white penne pasta and it worked great.Yum. Next time I am going to try it with shrimp.

We loved this!  I made it vegetarian and didn't add the chicken, which made it even easier.  I used 1 tablespoon chili powder and 1/2 tsp cayenne pepper rather than the paste.  I added chopped up artichoke hearts and sundried tomatoes.  And I added the full container of pesto.  It was very easy, very tasty, and I will definitely make again!

im going to be honest, i was really disappointed... it was very bland.  i usually read the reviews ahead of time, but i didnt until after i made it.  i added some more salt, onion powder, oregano, basil, and fresh ground pepper, about 1/2 tsp-1 tsp each and it helped the flavor a lot.  i will probably saute some vegetables and mix it in/have it as a side to enhance the flavor.

This was awesome!  I didn’t have the hot chile paste so substituted  hot sauce. I also used an organic whole grain angel hair pasta.  It was so quick to make.  Definitely a keeper recipe!

This dish is AWESOME!!! One of our favorites that we make almost weekly! The only change I made is I use the cheese tortellini instead of regular pasta. Also never use cilantro mainly BC I never have any. Great dish!!!!

Delish, although oily.  Of course, I DID use an entire jar of pesto, so perhaps that explains all the oil that was left in the bottom of the pan, haha :-)  Both my husband and myself thought it was awesome, even with the extra oiliness. Yum!

This is a great, quick and easy recipe to throw together for weeknight dinners.  The combination of pesto and hot chili sauce is different and unexpected.  There is a spicy kick to this dish!  I could not find the hot chili paste, so I got the hot chili sauce in the asian aisle...hope it's close enough!

Used shrimp and Thai chili sauce because that's what I had around. Didn't have any goat cheese or cream cheese so I tossed in about a tablespoon of butter right before adding the pasta, cilantro and parm. Might try it with a splash of cream next time. At any rate, I thought it was delicious! The chili sauce added a nice little kick to it. Quick and easy to make.

So yummy and so easy!! Did not have chili paste; used chili powder. After reading several other reviews, also added about 4 Tbs. cream cheese, and 1/4 cup milk. Made it very creamy and silky. Hubby loved this and I will be making it again soon!!

Great easy recipe.  Followed recipe exactly, except used penne. I used chili pepper paste,  not sure if that is the same as mentioned here, but it worked.  The chicken was very tasty.  In fact if I change anything it would be slightly less pasta and a little more chicken.  Thanks for the recipe:)

I loved this recipe! My grocery store did not have the chili paste so I used tomato paste and mixed it with chili seasoning until I got my desired heat. I also used the entire small jar of pesto. This was so delicious and I love that you can modify it so easily!!
**UPDATE** I veered off the beaten path and did the following to make it more rich. In addition to the small jar of tomato paste with chili seasoning, I also added mushrooms sauteed with the chicken. From there I used an entire 8 oz tub of pesto along with an 8 oz container of cream cheese. This was so unbelievably rich and cheesy! Great recipe that you can adjust to your tastes. Bottom line this recipe is fabulous as written, but you can adjust it easily to your personal taste. Thank you for sharing!

Made as written, but used whole-wheat rotini (personal preference).  Absolutely Five stars!  Truthfully, this recipe would probably be Five stars using the bow-tie pasta too.  ... Or penne, ... or linguini...  Yeah, I'll be making this again, and often.  Thanks, LAGIRL!

I've never really liked pesto, it kind of grosses me out. But this sounded pretty good so I gave it a try anyway, and glad I did. This is very tasty and will be added to the dinner rotation. The only change I had to make was using Chili Garlic Sauce instead of the Sambal Oelek, simply because that's what I have and I don't use enough to justify purchasing both. But maybe that will change now that I've found this recipe!

Made this tonight. As have others, I made minor adjustments: I sauteed half a large sweet onion (diced) and 3 large cloves of garlic (minced) in 2 Tbs olive oil + 1 Tbs butter. I added the cubed chicken when the onions were translucent, sprinkled with S&P, and added 1-1/2 Tbs Sriracha when cooked through. Into that went 1 jar Classico basil pesto and 1/2 jar (about 5) sundried tomatoes in oil, diced, and 1 c white wine. That simmered while the pasta (ziti) cooked and tossed all together with a palm-full of Pecorino Romano. DELICIOUS.

We liked this a lot. I didn't measure the cheese or the pesto, just kept adding both until it looked delicious. Thanks for the recipe! EDIT 6/16: Had to use just 2 tbsp pesto this time when I made it. Don't do that! Use the full amt called for or more or don't bother making this specific one :)

Wow! Simple and fabulous! I had used andouille sausages that needed to be used, also, I didn't have chili paste, but did use the closest thing which was chili garlic sauce, and poured a bit of cream just to smooth out everything. We also made fresh linguine pasta (AR's basic pasta), so we felt it needed a touch of olive oil before serving. Served this with homemade italian bread (AR)with herbed oil/balsamic dip. Oh yeah, I hate cilantro so I omitted that.

I doubled the amount of of chile paste and still couldn't taste it at all. So much for the "spicy" part. So I added 3 more tablespoons and a ton of garlic. That made it much more palatable. Surprised how bland this is without any alterations. Good starting point, though.

I doubled the meat and should have increased the srirachi, as we all added more to our servings.  I used rainbow rotini since that was what I had onhand. This is a flavorful, quick dish and perfect for a weekend lunch.

Pretty good for a quick dish!  We always have Buitoni cheese tortellini in the freezer, so we used it instead of the farfelle.  Yummy!

This is amazing and so simple!  I have made it several times....everyone thinks it is better with garlic, mushrooms and zucchini added.

I was really surprised that I didn't like this more after reading the reviews.  I have used this site for years and have been consistently pleased by the rating/review sections.  The flavor was good but I found the ratio of pasta/chicken/pesto to be off.  I think this would have been better with half the amount of pasta.  I had to double the pesto and even then it didn't seem like enough.  I think the flavor was good but with the amount of fat in the recipe it just wasn't worth it.  I will try it again with half the pasta and adding the goat cheese (I love goat cheese in anything).

This was excellent.  My mouth is still burning, and that's a good thing.  Maybe I used a bit more chile sauce than recommended.  I also used cilantro from the spice rack instead of fresh, and a combination of parmesan/mozzarella.

My husband and I loooove this dish!  I used penne pasta since I can't find any bowtie pasta that is gluten-free.  I also add a little red pepper flakes to the chicken and hot chile paste to give the chicken an extra kick.  Great recipe!

This was delicious. I added zuchinini, red bell pepper, mushrooms, greek yogurt(for a creamy texture as I did not have cream cheese), and white wine. I did not have chili paste on hand, so I used chipotle chili seasoning and chili powder. I used my homemade organic pesto and organic pasta, and I could eat this 3 times a week!

This was excellent...so easy to make too !! I had dinner on the table in as little time as it took to boil the pasta. I used spicy garlic pepper sauce instead of chili paste (cant wait to try chili paste version) and it was still FAB !! I also used precooked chicken so it was a matter of heating things up...very easy, very good, cheap to make and a hit : )

I love this recipe.  It's so quick and easy.  And it's tasty and pretty healthy too.  I personally skip the cilantro because I'm not a fan of it.

WOW!!!  I prepared this exactly as written and my family thought it was excellent.  I think the key is the chile paste which adds a lot of flavor and spice to the chicken.  I found the paste in the Asian section of my local grocery store.  This is definitely a recipe I will make again.

This is so amazing!  I put a little more chili sauce, and added more fresh parm at the end.  It was absolutely delicious.  I believe next time fresh garlic would be a great addition.  Thanks LA Girl, I will definitely be bringing this to the next work pot luck.

Great Recipe!!! This was my first time using Pesto at home. And I wasn't more then pleasantly surprised. I added and sauted some garlic in the oil prior to mixing everything together. I was even able to make this during the week. Great quick, easy, and tasty recipe. My 1 year old loved it.  ;)

We absolutely loved this pasta. I had a ton of homemade pesto and was looking for ways to use it up, but next time I'll make the pesto just for this dish. We used about half a bag of Quorn vegetarian chicken in place of the real thing, and it worked perfectly. We also added halved cherry tomatoes, which really complemented the flavors. The chili paste that we had in the fridge was Thai, and it had a sweet undercurrent that worked well.

three people I made it for loved it and wouldn't change a thing. I, on the other hand, didn't think it was flavorful enough. way too bland for my tastes... I think more chili paste and maybe 1 tbsp less oil would be good for the next try.

Fantastic! I used the "Simple Garlic and Basil Pesto" recipe for the pesto (but I modified it to substitute half of the parm. cheese with Romano and substitute the Brazil nuts with all pine nuts). I used Romano cheese in addition to the parmasan cheese, and it was so delicious! Thanks for the recipe; I will most definitely use it again!

I made this as directed & thought it was pretty good. I could find chili paste but did find roasted chili paste. We didn't think that it was that spicy. I will increase the chili paste next time.

This was soooo yummy!!  I did cut back on the olive oil and the pesto or it may have been too oily.  Also it doesn't make a lot so if you have big eaters in your family, double the recipe.  Would also be very good with scampi.  I added a clove of garlic too.

My husband and I loved this recipe. I made my own pesto with the magic bullet because prepared pesto tastes too salty to me. I used another reviewer's reco and added sauteed mushrooms. Next time I'll also add sauteed red peppers and zucchini (also previously recommended). We used just a couple drops of hot sauce and it gave the dish a little kick. Thanks again for such a delicious meal!

I made this tonight, didn't have the type of pasta it called for but used corkscrew pasta, and it was a hit.  The family came running wondering what the smell was and I had to double the recipe,...well there isn't much left!  Thanks for this recipe!

Fantastic!  I followed the recipe exactly and it was great.  Quick and easy to make and just the right amount of heat for me.  I may try adding vegies like some other suggested next time, but it's fine as is.

There was nothing wrong with this, it just wasn't anything great.  I don't plan to make it again, but we will eat the leftovers.  I did add the goat cheese as suggested.  Without, it really would have been bland.  I served it with asparagus drizzled with evoo and fresh lemon juice, kosher salt and fresh ground pepper.

This was so quick and easy to make!  I made double the quantity as the chicken breasts had to be defrosted (it was a large pack so lots of leftovers!)  I didn't want to have to freeze the pasta so I kept it separate and served the chicken mixture on top.  Also, I was worried that the overall mixture would be too oily so I drained the oil after cooking the chicken and before adding the pesto.  What I should have done was coat the pasta in the chilli oil and then drained it from the pan - I will try that next time.  Thanks for sharing!

This was good. I added the goat cheese because I love it, and it made it a really rich meal.

Picked up a deli chicken to use when I was in a hurry.  This recipe is fabulous and our whole family loved it (which is a huge bonus)!

I added chili oil along with the 3 tbl of oil to make it spicier. I also added parsley instead of cilantro. Over all the dish was pretty good and I would make it again.

Excellent dish with the following modifications:  saute onion and garlic with chicken and chile paste (make sure to use the paste!); add strips of sun-dried tomatoes; add splash of white wine and cream/half & half/whole milk; toss in some toasted pine nuts at the end; and do NOT forget the goat cheese at the end, it makes all the difference.  As good as this is hot, it's even better next day cold.  This has become a staple recipe and fun to play around with.

Loved it! We didn't have any chili paste, so we rubbed 1 Tbsp blackened seasoning on the raw chicken instead. Marvelous!!!

This recipe is excellent.  I have made it twice and my husband and daughter love it!!!  I used the low fat version of pesto found in the refrigerated pasta section.  The chile paste adds a great punch while the cilantro adds a nice freshness to the mix.  This is definitely a recipe that I will keep.

Wow!  this was really really good.  I didn't have a full box of pasta, but I'll definitely use a full box next time because  the pesto was laid on just a bit too thick, but that was more my fault than the recipes.  I substituted parsley for cilantro because I just don't like cilantro and it turned out very tasty.  I would definitely make this one again

Instead of chilli paste I used two medium chillis and I used about double the amount of pesto. It was quick and easy to make and tasted pretty good.

This was great for a quick summer meal.  I substitued the chile paste with some garlic powder and red pepper flakes and it was really yummy!  My super picky 5 year old ate her whole bowl!  Next time, I will add some sauted veggies, as reccommended by some other reviewers.

I really enjoyed this recipe. It was fast and good. I couldn't find the hot chilli paste, so I used some garlic and a shake of red pepper flakes. It worked well. I used a bunch of mushrooms, grape tomatoes, olives and artichoke hearts. It added a lot of flavor, which it really needed.

Very delicious. A couple of minor changes: Added fresh spinach, fresh tomatoes, garlic and onions to the pan with the chicken when sauting. Made my own pesto of tofu, some leftover broccoli, spinach, a few walnuts and some vegetable broth. No parmesan and served this over whole wheat pasta. The chili is a nice change of pace and really opens up the winter sinuses!

I am not a cook by any stretch of the imagination, but my Mom was coming into town and I wanted to make something that I could handle, but wanted a very flavorful dish. This recipe was easy for me to manage and very good! Per the suggestion of an earlier review, I added sun dried tomatoes for additional flavor and am glad that I did. I have already made this a few times.

This recipe is awesome.  The cilantro works wonderfully in this dish, and I encourage the addition of goat cheese right at the end of the recipe- it gives the pasta great depth.  I garnished this with pine nuts and sundried tomatoes.

Very nice! I didn't have cilantro, so I used parsley as someone else suggested. Added a bit of onion and some sundried tomatoes too, and it turned out very well! I reduced the olive oil by 1/2 because the pesto had enough oil; it was plenty.

I'll be using this as a good basis for a quick and easy meal from now on. It's even pretty and tasty enough for casual entertaining.

Thanks!

Amazing! Love the addition of chili paste to the pesto. Just used whatever pasta I had on hand and left out the chicken because it was for “Meatless Monday” but can’t wait to add chicken and/or veggies to it next time!

This is a great base recipe.  I tend to make changes to almost every recipe and did the same with this one.  When I was sauteing the chicken, I added minced garlic, diced shallots, sliced zucchini, some frozen spinach and artichoke hearts and a few diced grape tomatoes for color.  I had a little bit of half and half that I needed to use up, so I also threw that in when I tossed the pasta with the parmesan cheese.  It was VERY flavorful and there was enough sauce to keep the pasta from being too dry.  I will be making this again!

I could not find sambal oelek, so used green Thai Chili Paster instead.  Fairly simple dish to make and the kids liked it....but guess I was hoping for a little for kick.  Will try to find sambal oelek for next time.

All three of my kids & I LOVED this recipe. I followed the recipe exactly except I think I added more cheese than it called for. I know we will be making this often in the future. It was very easy to make and was delicious! I can’t wait to have some of the leftovers tomorrow.

This turned out great. Used 1 1/2 tablespoons of the chili paste for a little added spice, and a little chopped garlic with the chicken while cooking. Sprinkled with a little shredded Parmesan when fully cooked. Delicious

Soo delicious! The flavors of the chili paste and pesto really come together    We love garlic so I added crushed garlic  when I cooked the chicken and it was  great! If you can find the Sambal Oelek it is worth it!

Delicious!  I never would have thought of combining sambal and pesto, but it works.  I did add some pasta water and stirred in a little goat cheese at the end.  I will definitely make this again.

A favorite for nights with little time but we still need something yummy! Recommendation: use sriracha as the hot chili paste and double the amount. I like a little more spice and it adds to the flavor :) It is one of my favorites!

Husband loves this, I wasn't really a fan.  He loves Sriracha and I don't. We had Sriracha, not sambal oelek.

We LOVED this! Even my slightly picky teenage son said he thinks this is his new favorite pasta dish. I don't usually have the chile paste on hand, so I will use pepper flakes sautéed first in the olive oil to season the oil. Then we add the chicken. This dish is a home run.

Yum, this was so good! I reduced the pasta by half and was glad I did. There wouldn't be enough sauce if using a full box.  Quick and tasty weeknight meal, will definitely make again. Thanks for sharing!

Made this last night for boyfriend...  It was delicious!!  Had never used Sambal Oelek Chili Paste - used  one teaspoon to start - very tasty - will add more next time.  Also sautéed three garlic cloves, thinly sliced, and added about six julienned sun-dried tomatoes in Italian oil seasoning.  Will definitely make again!!

We loved this one!  Will definitely make it again!  I had some ricotta that I wanted to use up, so I stirred some in at the end and it added a bit of creaminess.  Will probably add a bit more chili paste next time.

Loved this! Had to modify because if the lack of certain ingredients in our fridge but added garlic to the chicken in the pot as well as a jarred slice of Jalapeño. Then deglazed everything with cotes de Rhine white wine before adding pesto and pasta!

Easy and tasty!  I changed things up: halved the recipe.  Used whole wheat pasta.  Used shrimp (only to use up frozen shrimp).  I sautéed crimini mushrooms separately so they brown a little.  Sautéed shrimp with red bell pepper.  Used the full amount of sambal oelek even though I had halved the recipe.  Not spicy for us!  Didn't have Parmesan so threw in some shredded Swiss/gruyere mix.  Definitely add the cilantro, it gives good flavor.  This would be great just as a veggie pasta too (zucchini, mushrooms, peppers)

This was a huge hit! I cooked the chicken with some sliced fresh garlic and a few shallots.  I also added quite a bit of pesto.  I couldn't find any chili paste so I made my own with tomato paste, chili powder, red pepper flakes and some other spices. And I doubled it! I served up a cucumber, tomato, olive, feta cheese salad with it and some garlic bread.  Perfect!! This is s SUPER easy and delicious dish!!

Because my husband doesn't like spicy I changed the recipe up a bit and used sun-dried tomatoes instead.  The recipe still lacked flavor however.  I may make it again but will have to spice it up a bit with maybe more garlic.

I made it, made some changes, used penne, added spinach more pesto eliminated the chile sauce added some seasonings like garlic , coriander, salt and pepper.  I thought it was bland and needed a punch of taste.

This pasta was excellent The only change that I made was using cavatappi pasta instead of farfalle. The chile paste gave it a nice kick and the overall flavor of the pasta was divine. Looking forward to making this again!

This was really good!! Only change I made was to halve the chicken and chili paste, and then split the pasta at the end  because our daughter is vegetarian. I will definitely be making this again. Might  try with shrimp next time so my daughter can eat it with the spicy "meat." It is company worthy food. Would have made a crusty loaf of bread to go along with it, but our oven broke last night.

I used Indian Vindaloo hot sauce instead of Sambal since I used what I had in the house.  We also added some onion and peppers for colour and flavour. I'll make it again for sure.

Very very good! Make sure to use basil pesto you like the flavor of (should go without saying, but alas, I didn't do that)! I also used sriracha for the chili paste and it was perfect. Added some frozen peppers and onions too. I will definitely make it again (with pesto I like). :)

Excellent!...And so adaptable to what you have on hand. I used rotini pasta, sriracha sauce, 6 blend Italian cheese, and some diced roasted red peppers with garlic.  Everything else the same. Entire family loved it! I'm new to pesto so I can't wait to try variations of this recipe. Thanks Teena!

Absolutely loved this. I couldn't find chile paste, so I just used red pepper flakes to add that kick. I also sauteed the chicken with garlic and used chicken thighs. I also used the ribbed spiral pasta, to give it that added texture. Lastly I topped everything off with sun dried tomatoes. The perfect blend of textures and flavors. Best of all this was quick and easy to make when you have 3 kids under 3 and are working full time.

This was great! I was worried because mine looked darker then the picture but it was delicious! Also, I used chili powder instead of the paste

I do not change recipes and rate them, so I made as stated.  After tasting, however, I added some extra kick ( for personal taste), pine nuts for texture.  Other than that, it was great. I would make this for a dinner party.  Fast, easy and keeps well.

I'm glad I tried it though as it's given me an idea of what sort of ingredients would make it more to my taste. Thanks for posting!

This was so delicious! I added bell peppers and mushrooms to the pasta. I cooked the chicken with garlic and onions. So tasty! I enjoyed the heat of the chili paste so much that I doubled it the second time I made this dish:) So simple and so good! A repeat in our house for sure!

Phenomenal! Like everyone else I added just a few extra tidbits- zucchini, red bell pepper, and red onion, as well as a little extra pesto, chili paste, and Parmesan. Also used whole wheat rotini pasta. SO GOOD! I will probably add artichoke hearts next time, and use a flavored pesto just to see how it goes! :)

I made this last night and it was really yummy and pretty easy and simple too!
I gave it four stars because I did make some changes. I added red onion, spinach, prosciutto and sun dried tomatoes. I do feel this added a lot flavor wise and texture wise.  When I make this again I'll almost double the pesto as well.
Thanks!

I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out great.  It took about 15 min. start to finish and couldn't be easier.  It tasted like I spent much longer on it than I actually did.  I'll definitely be making this for guests!  I used the chili paste I found with the fresh herbs at my grocery store and Classico basil pesto.  It was the right about of spicy for me - not too hot, but enough to have some kick.

This Chicken Pesto was... incredible!  My fiancee rated it a 7/10 but then we both kept going back for more and more and more. Hahaha I'll give it a 10! I did take out the spice, added green beans, and used tri-color pasta. Awesome!

Yum! What a good blend of flavors! I was excited to have a use for some homemade pesto that's been in my freezer... I really enjoyed this dish! A nice level of heat from the hot chile paste, creating a deeper flavor with the blend of pesto, cheese, and cilantro! Great dinner that comes together quickly!

This recipe is fabulous! I was looking for something simple to make with leftover chicken.  This is the best! My husband and son loved it (me too!).  I didn't have chile paste, so i used chipotle powder and i loved the "kick" the chile adds to this recipe. Definitely a repeat!!

As I was making this dish my family kept coming into the kitchen wondering what smelled so good!!  My son went on-line to find a spicey chicken recipe and found this one...  he loved it! I had a hard time finding the paste so I used a garlic paste instead and it turned out wonderful.  Will definately make again.

From all the reviews, I expected this to be absolutely fantastic. It was good, but definitely not the best. I did have to up the flavour a bit because what the recipe called for made it a bit bland.

This recipe has ruined all other pesto that I eat beause it is so much better.  We make huge batches of it with our basil plants and freeze in mini muffin pan cups.  It is an easy dish in the winter to just pop a couple in the microwave to defrost.

This Dish is delicious. The only thing I had to change was the chili paste. I couldn't find it at my local store. I did find roasted chili peppers in oil. I added crushed pepper, tom. paste and made my own paste, this worked well.

I've got to say, we really didn't enjoy this dish and I was surprised because we are usually always thrilled with the dishes I've made from AR, as I typically choose higher stars with a lot of ratings, but we found this to be pretty bland, especially the chicken.  I won't be making it again.  I'm bummed!

Excellent! Made it for my boyfriend and he ate 4 bowls. I added zucchini, mushrooms, and I meant to add diced tomatoes but completely forgot about them. This is a new favorite recipe- thanks!

I really like this one! I made this word for word by the directions and loved it. The second time around, I experimented by adding more hot sauce, more pesto, fresh garlic, shallots, mushrooms and red/green peppers. The first time I made this, I used the chili paste and the 2nd time I used- "Taste of Thai" Garlic Hot Sauce. This is a great recipe as is or to build on.

This was fantastic!  I subbed angel hair pasta for the bowties.  Also, I marinated my chicken breast whole and cooked them in the oven then sliced instead of cutting it up and cooking on the stove.  Will make again and again.

This was really yummy!  I did add more garlic as the pesto I bought didn't have enough for our taste.  My husband even asked that I keep this recipe and make more often, which is REALLY unusual. He's typically not a pasta lover.

This is one of my favorite recipes ever! Definitely go for the chili paste, not the powder. It adds something special. Added a smidge more pesto the second time around to balance the chili paste a bit more. Several people have asked me for this recipe - this is outstanding!

Delicious! A keeper! My (sometimes picky) husband and guest loved it.

I did kick up the spices a little, as we love savory, spicy, strong dishes. I added extra cumin, chili powder, pesto, and some garlic powder.

I also couldn't find chili paste at my local grocery store. The chili powder didn't have enough depth of taste (or kick) to it... so I added a tiny teaspoon of adobo sauce (from a chipotle chili in adobo sauce jar) to it. Perfect! Not too spicy, but oh so flavorful!

this was fantastic!  an instant hit in my house.  I used a jalapeno flavored olive oil for cooking the chicken, to try to spice it up.  If you really like things spicy, I'd add more hot pepper paste, ours (although really tastey) came out pretty mild.

This is absolutely delicious! The only chili paste i could find was the oriental chili paste in the international isle in the market, and it tasted great actually! I also did what other reviewers did and added goat cheese at the end and i think that really made the dish, it made it really creamy. I'll definitely make this again, even my picky boyfriend who doesnt really like pasta loved it.

Made this last night and WOW was it good.  I made my own pesto to use in it and found the chile paste easily in my grocery (produce section).  Hubby and I decided this one is definitely a keeper!  I also, as suggested, stirred in some goat cheese at the end (about 1/2 cup.

I thought this receipe was good but overrated.  I dont know if it was because of the pesto I used or chilli powder instead of the chile paste.

This was fantastic!  I especially love the goat cheese I added at the end.  The only problem I had was that it was a bit dry.  I added a touch more olive oil, but it didn't help much.  I attribute the dryness to my own inabilities, but it was still great, even my picky boyfriend loved it!

Leave out the chicken and it's even cheaper/vegetarian, or at least I think it is, I'm not a vegetarian though. Anyway, it was quick and easy, and delicious. A great meal to enjoy with your significant other along with a movie ('This is Spinal Tap' for us). Cheers.

We enjoyed this recipe very much.  I added pine nuts to it which added a nice little flavor.  I completely forgot to add the goat cheese (which I LOVE) so I'll be making again soon and adding that as well.  Thank you!

Not quite what I was anticipating and we kept saying, "What is this missing ?"  Finally determined perhaps shrimp and a little sun-dried tomato would offer a little flavor burst.  Not a goat cheese fan, but I'll bet that would add something as well. Thanks for sharing, Teena. :-)

I decided to stay true to the recipe.  I also sprinkled crumbled goat cheese in at the end as was suggested as an option.  It was yummy and creamy.  Real comfort food!

I thought this was fantastic.  We cooked exactly as the recipe instructed.  For chili paste we used Heavenly Chef Hunan Red Chili Sauce.  Looking around online I learned that chili paste contains hot red pepper, salt, and garlic typically -- which makes up the Hunan Sauce (sold at Safeway in Arizona). The pesto we bought pre-made from Fresh and Easy.  With pre-made pesto, this recipe is incredibly easy and makes a ton of food.   If you like this recipe, try this one.  Somewhat similar (and my favorite meal). Not nearly as easy to make however.

Outstanding.  I made this with the "Simple Garlic and Basil Pesto" recipe on this site and the meal was simple and divine.  It was even easier as I used leftover rotisserie chicken so I just heated the chicken (added a little noodle water to keep it moist) and proceeded to pile everything on.  My honey loved it too; proceeded to eat the rest of mine and go back for seconds (thirds?).  Thanks!!

Made this last night for dinner, DH loved it.  I knew for my own taste to only add 1 tsp. of chili paste so he added chili flakes later.  I sauted mushrooms and I wish I could have added more of the bounty that I had in my fridge.  I agree with the suggestion of adding white wine cause the juices seem to disappear quickly.  I will be making this again and adding more veggies and using up my homemade pesto!  Thanks!

I LOVED this recipe. I have tried cooking Italian dishes before with not much success. This was exceptional! I made my own pesto and spaghetti since it was all I had on hand. Plus I added some cherry tomatoes. The whole family loved it!

I had this in my recipe box nine months before I finally tried it~! I am glad i did! This was awesome. I cant wait to make it again. I am adding more chicken next time. Also I used the toasted pine nuts as suggested, I can't imagine the dish without it! Also leftover are great cold, or throw a vinaigrette on there and it is an awesome cold pasta salad!!

This was incredible. I have no idea what chile paste is so I added a couple of dashes of cayenne and it came out excellent. This is a great summer time dish and is probably just as good cold as it was hot.

Yummy!  I used angel hair instead and a little more chile paste (we really love spicy food).  My fiance now requests this dish specifically on a regular basis.

This was a good recipe.  We added sun-dried tomatoes for a great touch.  I would probably add some more of the chili paste for some extra spice.

Delicious and just the right amount of heat - I added 1/2 cup of heavy whipping cream to make more of a pesto-cream sauce and it was terrific.  I used store-prepared fresh basil pesto and left out the cilantro.

Great starter recipe LAgirl. I added a little chopped garlic, 1 - 2 tbs more pesto, sun dried tomatoes (a must!) and a touch more chili paste. Turned out really good, but next time I will DEFINITELY add in a swirl of goat cheese. Feta crumbles would be tasty too... :)

Thanks for a great recipe.

This one is a keeper for sure. I followed the recipe exactly, except at the end I added about 1/4 cup of half and half because the chicken and spice mixture was getting a bit dry. I think I'll go easy on the chili paste next time, as it's a tad bit spicy for my personal tastes. It is still delicious, though. Thanks for a fantastic meal!

Very good tasty pasta dish that is quick and easy to make. I think it will taste great with any kind of alterations made to the recipe. I had roasted a chicken the night before so I used the leftovers. I added some chopped garlic to the oil and heated it with the chili paste. I then added canned artichoke hearts, chopped sun dried tomatoes and the chicken. After heating thoroughly, I added the rest of the ingredients. The pasta came out delicious and quite hefty.

This was delicious!  I followed the directions except that I added 2 cloves of garlic because we love garlic.  I also found that I needed to add twice the amount of pesto called for to properly saturate the pasta.  This was so easy to make, and delicious, it will definitely be in our regular rotation.  Both my husband and I went back for seconds.  Both of us thought that it would be even better if we added some sundried tomatoes to it.  I might try using the sundried tomato pesto instead of the green stuff for a kick.

This dish was amazing! WoW! Perfect amount of spice..I did use the goat cheese at the end...PERFECT touch..I mixed it with some 1/2 & 1/2 and melted it in the microwave, then I just stirred it in at the end. I also added pine nuts. Oh and Romano cheese instead of parmesan as others suggested.

I think this recipe can be very yummy with a few small changes.  I add about 1 cup of diced cherry tomoatoes and 1 can of artichoke hearts, split in half.  I also recommend adding slightly more pesto (just 2 tbsp more) and bit less parmesan cheese, about a 1/4 cup.  Other than that this recipe is great.  I love the Chili Paste!

I made a version of this where I marinated the chicken in the red pepper paste and then baked it for about 50 min at 375. Added some grilled veggies and pine nuts and it was amazing. Great dish!

This was o.k. It was kind of dry and I didn't even use all of the pasta that was called for in the recipe..(Thank Goodness!)I added a little extra oil to moisten it and that helped a little but not much...Maybe more pesto would have done the trick but I only had enough of what the recipe called for... All in all, the flavor was good, we like spicy...

This recipe is fabulous. A favorite at my house already! I usually put cook the chicken as directed in the recipe, and then add the same amount (again) once it's all cooked to add some more kick! Mmmm...

When I made this dish I added a pack of sliced mushrooms, a sliced up zuchinni, and a couple tablespoons of mascarpone (just because it was in the fridge) and it was DELICIOUS!  I also made the pesto at home in the food processer and I used a lot of garlic.  I can definitely see how this dish would be bland, but as long as you take other's advice and add extra seasoning and vegetables you won't be disappointed.
And if you don't know what chili paste is, it is mashed up chilis with garlic, soybean oil and salt.  You can find it in the asian section.

Very yummy!  I added a little feta cheese and some fresh basil on top.  My husband loved the spicy flavor mixed with the pesto and cheese flavor.  Will definitely add to our meal rotation.

This was great!  I used chili powder instead of paste, the entire container of pesto, and I added artichoke hearts, which I think really added to the flavor.  I love anything that allows me to use up cilantro.  Yum!

This recipe was incrediable!!  I could not find chili paste so I just used chili powder.  I doubled the amount of pesto sauce and added crumbled goat cheese at the end, but otherwise followed the recipe as posted.  I will be making this one again and again!

This was a great quick recipe that everyone loved. I added extra pesto like other reviews said and a little milk because I thought it was a little dry. Thanks for sharing!

this was a hit!  

I didn't use the bowtie pasta, I used similar pasta to the one in the picture.  I also added a little extra chili paste for extra spice... wow that stuff has a lot of kick!
I added the goat cheese as recommended in some other posts.  The goat cheese was a great idea!  I also forgot to get the cilantro (whoops) but it came out just fine without it.  I served with a salad, to balace out the heat.

You know, I was all ready to love this, since I love pesto and I love spicy and I love pasta.  But I have to admit that I just found it sort of oily and bland (even though I used about twice as much chili paste and an extra two or three tablespoons of pesto).  I did do two things which could have affected the outcome, though.  First, I added mushrooms, zucchini and red pepper, which I sauteed together after I'd cooked the chicken in the chili paste.  To help them soften I put the lid on the pan, which of course drew a ton of moisture out of the veggies, which I didn't drain off before adding the chicken, which might have diluted the final product.  The other mistake I made was using store-bought pesto.  If I make this again - which I might, since the idea sounds wonderful - I'll make my own pesto, cook the veggies separately, and maybe use a little less pasta.  If it works out, I'll add another review.  This time around, though, it gets three stars (because hey, let's face it - even if it just tasted like pasta with olive oil and parmesan cheese, that's still a pretty good thing.)

Wanted to add...  I didn't have time to read through the reviews, only the 3 most popular at the bottom.  Came out excellent! I added the suggested sun-dried tomatoes (which I enjoy) and I went lightly on the parmesan (which I don't like excessively). What an easy and delicious dish that can be adapted many different ways!  Try it! I'm not even a huge pesto fan and I thought it was TASTY!

very yummy.  We will make this again.  Pesto and chili paste matched each other nicely.  Fresh parmesan grated made it very good.  Had it with sugar snap peas.

My family loved this. Couldn't find chili paste at first so I just used chili powder and they liked it. Made it again by request the same week and with chili paste and it was even better. Next time we are adding sun dried tomatoes

Lovely tasting chicken pesto pasta.  Read the advice from others such as adding vegetables and sundried tomatoes and would definitely recommend adding these extras.

I've made this dish countless times but I always add chopped sun dried tomatoes (Packed in oil), artichoke hearts, and sauteed onions, zucchini, & yellow squash.  Other than that, I always keep the recipe the same and is excellent and easy to make.  Even my 14 month old eats it!

Yum.  This recipe is just in time for my super-homemade-garden-grown pesto sauce.  I added vegetables as did other reviewers and used sambal olek chili sauce for kick - another cook did as well.  Great recipe, a real taste of summer!

I LOVE this recipe.  It is ridiculously easy and so yummy!! It's also versatile--you could add mushrooms, sun-dried tomatoes, whatever.  I used whole wheat rotini.  A great meal that's on the table in 30 minutes--you can't beat that.

I followed the recipe (but with 1.5 T chili paste) and everything turned out right; I just wasn't very impressed. It's very easy to make, but boring and bland. Maybe it would be better with half as much pasta or twice as much pesto.

Excellent!  Very flavorful.  We could not find chili paste in our local grocery store; substituted tblsp. Hot Chili & Cumin Sauce in a can; wonderful.  My husband and I loved this meal.  One of the best recipes I've tried from AllRecipes, and I cook all the time off this website.

This was fantastic.  I added chopped roasted red peppers to add color (and because I had some around) and a little chopped onion.  Used chili oil instead of paste, and toned it down for the kids.  This is easy and a keeper.

Came together nicely. First time my husband and I had pesto, so we had to get use to the taste, but after a few bites, it was good (whole bowl basically gone.) I added garlic and cheese sausage with seemed to add more flavor.

This was an easy and tasty recipe!  I made minor changes to it.  I added sun dried tomatoes and gorgonzola cheese.  I also eliminated the cilantro as I don't care for the taste of it.  This is something I will make again and again.  Thank you!

My husband loved this.  I thought it was kind of bland.  We both agree it could use more chile paste and cilantro.  The goat cheese might add a little more flavor too.  Will try it again though.
