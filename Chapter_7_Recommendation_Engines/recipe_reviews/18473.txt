I will make it again, but wish I had read the reviews first. It was incredibly difficult to roll out and kept breaking. Eventually, when I was about to give up, I grew brains and rolled it out on wax paper and transfered it to the pan from that. When I was ready to put it in the oven, I rubbed a bit of water over the top and sprinkled sugar on it, and wrapped the edges in aluminum foil. It was the best looking pie I've ever made, and my parents said they had never tasted better, either.

This is the recipe my mom taught me about 40 years ago. EXCEPT, we adds more sugar!  That's funny...she said it was a family secret!  You must be in the family!
Great crust recipe for the first timer.  You'll be the talk of the town! To manage the richness of the crust, roll crust out and place the crust into the pan with wax paper.

I love sugar cookies and this crust really does an apple pie justice.  I made an apple pie with it and it sucked up the flavor of the apples and cinnimon really well.  It was like eating a cookie along with my pie.

I really like this crust for custard type pies. I just press the dough into the pie pan and that eliminates any issues with rolling it.

This was a delicious crust, but a bit difficult to roll out. I did as some other reviewers suggested and added extra egg, and that helped a lot. Will make again!

Pretty straightforward.  I used one large egg total.    Folks need to remember that flours can vary by quite a bit and experience pastry (and bread) makers know this.  Perhaps the recipe should make a note to add flour or water by teaspoon  until the dough sticks together in a ball.  I used a pastry blender, wrapped it in a pastry cloth in the refrigerator.  I always used to have a difficult time rolling out doughs until I invested in a heavy marble roller and tile.  These are put in the refrigerator or freezer to make them cold to reduce the stickiness that occurs when the butter/shortening gets too warm when working.  All in all, a great and easy crust.  4 stars because of lack of dough consistency hints.

This crust was excellent. It looked good, and it tasted good.It was the perfect classic pie crust. It is easier to roll out the dough on wax paper. My friends and family loved it, plus I'm only 12 and this was my first time making a pie, and I was able to call it a success. I'm using this recipe for apple pie tonight, on Christmas.

CHANGES: added 1 tsp vanilla and used 1/4 cup sugar. I mixed all the ingredients IN the pie dish and pressed it into the dish rather than rolling it out. This way was faster and easier to to. Good recipe - will use many, many times.

Very tasty, bakes well, slices nicely (doesn't crumble or fall apart).  Worked beautifully with pumpkin pie.  I used one whole egg rather than 1/2 so that it wasn't so dry.  Otherwise, it was very quick and easy to make.  Some people may find it a little bit on the sweet side - next time, I may not use so much sugar.  Overall, one of the best pie crust recipes I've tried so far.

Use the whole egg, and don't roll this recipe! It's meant to be pressed evenly into the pie pan quickly after mixing. Great for strawberry pie.

I have been baking for many years and by far this is the worst pie crust recipe I have ever used. It was easy to mix. The mixture was too gooie and very hard to roll out. I will never be using this awful recipe again.

Following others' comments that the dough was dry, I used a whole egg. The dough was perfectly textured and incredibly easy to work with. However, the crust itself didn't have a super great texture or flavor. It was kind of powdery. Not a bad crust, but not a great one either.

Wow! I'm not a huge fan of pie crust so I thought I would try this. Loved it! It was so easy to make too. I rolled it out in between 2 sheets of wax paper and did not have any problems as other reviewers did with it. I did used 2 eggs for 2 pie shells instead of 1. Turned out great! Great compliment to my pecan pie.

This pie crust was AMAZING. I made it with a pumpkin pie (the first pie I've ever made from scratch) I'm not a big fan of crusts, I usually eat the filling and leave the crust alone. I Loved the way the crust turned out, I plan on making many more pies with this recipe!!

I was looking for a pie crust like a sugar cookie and then I came across this recipe.  I followed the advice of some of the reviewers and used 1 egg and more sugar.  I also used wax paper, however, for me it was still hard to roll out.  Then I remembered some reviewers just patted out in the pie pan.  This definitely worked.  Well, I like this crust much better.  I was never a crust person...I always ate the pie filling and left the crust.  However, I like this crust and my 4 year old liked it as well.   I made the crust with a sweet potato pie and it went very well with it.  I will make again.

This was very easy to make in the food processor.  Definitely refrigerate this crust or it can be difficult to work with!  This was a good crust for the chocolate chip pie I made it for.  Thanks for the recipe!

Wow, now I'm convinced about putting egg into pie crusts! And adding the sugar really does make it almost like a sugar cookie or shortbread.  I doubled the recipe, using a whole jumbo egg.  I kept half in the fridge for a week and had another great pie crust.  I used the crust to make a blueberry "galette" from a recipe in the Detroit News. Brush the top with another beaten egg, sprinkle with sugar before baking.  Yum!  Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe is delicious! I am new to the neighborhood and wanted to make fruit pies for my neighbors. This made excellent apple pie! I did add a bit more sugar than suggested, and used a whol egg instead of half, but other than that I stuck with the recipe and it was g-o-o-d!

I can honestly say that I never make pie crusts because they NEVER turn out right. I have made this one 4 times, and it's been perfect every time!! It really does taste like a sugar cookie. My family used to eat the pie and leave the crust. No more!!

A nice sweet crust.  I doubled the eggs and patted it in the pan instead of rolling it out.  It turned out a bit more yellow-looking than normal (from the extra egg) but good-tasting.

Oh my gosh this was fantastic! I read some other reviews a little late, but i would reccomend doubling the egg like they said. I did add a bit of water, but it was easy to handle once I got it right. I swore I would never make another crust, but now I will never buy one again!

I thought this was a wonderful crust with a pumkin pie. My family thought it was great. I did add a bit of milk to soften th crust before I rolled it but it turned out just wonderful. Thanks so much.

Pretty good crust since I didn't have shortning and this recipe used butter. I used a little less than stated because that's all I had. I would use more sugar next time and a whole egg.

I live in a country where shortning is expensive and doesn't come in large quantities... so this recipe saved me from having to find it and it was easy to make and yummy. I added some cinnamon and more sugar for the heck of it and made a pumpkin pie! i had rave reviews!

I made this crust with "Apple Pie by Grandma Ople".  I brushed the crust the last ten minutes with an egg wash and sprinkled sugar on it.  It was delightful.  Everybody raved about it!

Great pie crust. I always buy crust instead of making it from stratch, but I'm glad I tried it.  This is a quick and easy recipe for even a first timer. I followed other reviews and put a whole egg. I also rolled out the dough onto plastic wrap (didn't have parchment paper). I used it with sweet potatoe pie- it was delicious!

Tasty crust - but very hard to work with.  Wax paper is  a must if you plan on using this crust. :)

I was looking for a pie crust with more flavor...I found it! I made an apple pie, cooked it in a paper bag. The only thing I would do differently is brush the top crust with flavored coffee creamer/egg wash...this is the icing on the pie.

My husband thought it was too much like a cookie for a pie crust so he wouldn't eat the pie at all. I actually didn't mind the crust and thought it was ok but maybe it's just a bit too rich for a sweet potato pie.

This pie crust had a very good flavor and was so easy to make. Like someone else suggested I doubled the amount of egg. It turned out great. I will never use a store bought crust again.

I made this crust for an apple pie, doubling the recipe.  I took the advice of other reviewers and increased the amount of egg, so used two eggs.  I didn't have any trouble working with the dough.  It rolled out nicely (between waxed paper) and baked well.  I did cover the pie with foil to prevent over-browning.   As for the final result, the texture of the crust was nice, and the flavor was OK as well.  Not too sweet, but not as good as I'd been hoping.

I have never had much luck with making pie crust. after trying this recipe, I have faith in myself again. It is a great recipe but I double up on it, and put the leftover in the fridge to use another day. It is great with apple crumble pie.

This was my first time trying to make pie crust, and I was successful. I am young, just out on my own for a few months and I already had the ingrediants. My boyfriend loved it and I got to call my grandmother and brag that I made a pie crust, the one thing she has never mastered.

I could not get this dough to roll out without splitting and cracking beyond repair. I had to roll it back together and add water to try again, and it still split terribly. Then I made the mistake of using this for a blueberry pie that needed to cook for 50 minutes. (I was unsure from the directions whether the crust was meant to be baked 20 minutes before being used in a pie that needed the filling to be baked, so I put the filling in when it was raw.) When I took it out of the oven, the crust was blackened all around the edge of the pie. I gave it 2 stars because I bet if I really tried I could get this crust to work for me, but I'm not going to bother. I will not make it again.

This was a great crust-I only have made a few and this was the best tasting.  I think next time I will only bake for 10-15 minutes before filling it though because the outer edges of the crust got really dark, but that could have been because of the apple pie recipe I had. Good recipe ;)

This was a unique spin on your average pie crust, but it was wonderful! I used it with a family pumpkin pie recipe and it was delightful! A hint of sweet, a little flaky, excellent!

Made this for Thanksgiving and loved the crust.  I took the suggestion of other contributors and used a whole egg instead of a half.  Also used butter flavored Crisco for the shortening.  Rolled out chilled dough between wax paper sheets and it was very easy to work with.  The flavor (with 4 T.) sugar and the light flakey texture was the best crust ever!  Will always use this recipe.

I don't know why people said it was too flaky... for me, it was too thick and moist. I'll make it again since it's so simple but will add less butter, definitely.

Very good pie crust. I used this recipe to make lemon meringue pie, and it turned out great! I don't know why but I can never seem to roll out and transfer a pie crust without it cracking and breaking, even though this dough was very moist since I added a whole egg. Call me innovative I ended up using a cake pan to make the pie since I have no pie plates, but it turned out great even when I had to press the dough into the pan where pieces had broken off!
Good recipe, 4 stars.

I gave this recipe 4 stars because it was extremely good (i never eat the crust off of pies, just the filling, and I ate this one!), but I found it EXTREMELY hard to roll out.  I did use a whole egg, as other members had suggested. I can't imagine what it would have been like with only half an egg.  When I make this again (today or tomorrow), I am going to make it 2 1/2 times bigger for two pies.  Very good tasting pie crust though!

This pie crust is tasty AND easy to make. I used egg substitutes and half applesauce in place of half the butter. Came out great. One tip for dummies like me - roll the dough out onto a floured surface!

About this pie crust...it was the worst I have ever made. I hard a really hard time with it breaking apart. I have made many many pie crusts and I would not reccomend this to anyone. Not to mention I made it today for Thanksgiving. I only gave it one star because it wouldnt let me leave without it.

I used this for a blueberry pie that had to bake for 55 minutes, so I did not bake it before filling and it turned out OK.  The only complaint is that the dough was very crumbly and was not easy to roll out, I had to keep adding water and it still split and cracked.  My pie crust wasn't pretty, but it did taste good.

It was very good. very sweet. Perfect for a person that has a sweet tooth. The only problem I had with it was I could not get it to roll out. I had to piece it together. Other then that it was good.

Definitely easy to make and rolls out well.  I've never used a half an egg, but after stirring I just removed  half of the egg.  This isn't as flaky as your typical pastry crust and it definitely is like a cookie.  Tastes great and I will make again for the ease.
