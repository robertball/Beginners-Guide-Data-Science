My daughters wanted waffles and we were out of milk and eggs.  We are not vegan. These waffles are very serviceable.  We added another 1/2 tablespoon of cinnamon. Would make again in a pinch for sure.

Thank you for a Great recipe! These were crispy and tasty! I was able to make six waffles with items already in my pantry. I normally make buttermilk waffles for my family on the weekend. I was out of eggs and milk so I searched for a vegan recipe. My daughter and I normally eat vegan breakfast and lunch. So the real test were the guys. My little one asked for seconds! It was really easy and quick to assemble. I added some pecans/chocolate chips to a few. Of course the possibilities are endless. I will definitely make these again!
