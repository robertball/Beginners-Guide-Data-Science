Let me start by saying that I am *NOT* a vegetarian.  I made this for my book club (vegetarians and non) last night and they LOVED it.  It has a great consistency and the flavors are wonderful.  The vegi burger crubmles gave it a good texture that most non meat chili recipies seem to lack.  I just dumped everything in the crock pot and cooked on high for 3 hours and it couldn't have been easier.  Everyone is asking for the recipie.  Thanks for sharing!

My husband and I want to start cooking some vegetarian dishes because they are healthier but we like meat and we're not big fans of veggies.  So I thought chili would be a safe start.  We were both a little freaked out about the vegetarian meat substitute so I remembered a chili I've had from Pullman, WA where we went to college (they grow a ton of lentils) and substituted lentils.  I boiled 2 cups of lentils according to the directions on the bag and added it to the dish instead of the meat crumbles.  It came out AWESOME.  I hope others try my lentil substitute, because it was really amazing.  Great recipe!

I admit I was skeptical of this recipe.  It looked too simple and I just couldn't imagine that taco seasoning and ranch dressing mix would come together to make a tasty chili.  It does!  I followed the recipe exactly but substituted ground beef for the vegetarian crumbles. I served this with cornbread muffins. Delicious! I can't think of a thing to change with the exception that maybe next time I will add some chopped green pepper. I can't wait to have leftovers for lunch!

This makes a fantastic vegetarian "chili"! I've also made it w/ground beef in place of the veggie crumbles, and with or without beans. It is really good and I love that it is SO easy. It's good for everyone...grown ups, kids - everyone who likes "chili" (and even some who don't!)will enjoy this. Chili Snobs may sneer, but I'm telling you this is a surprisingly delicious, easy recipe. Thanks

It was really amazing how well it came out. I used 1/2cup barly instead of the fake beef and added a little bit of chili mix. All in all, amazing!

you're right, i didn't believe how good it would be! followed the previous reviewer's suggestion of making the taco and ranch seasoning from recipes on the site (cutting out most of the salt). this really saved me cos i'm hard up for groceries for a few days, and i had the stuff on hand (used yves mexican ground round instead of burgers). this is a keeper. thanks!

This was a fabulous recipe! I loved that it was fast, easy, and versitile. You could easily substitute the veggie meat for ground beef or ground turkey and it would work great. I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out very tasty. My kids didn't even know it was veggie meat! I would definately make this again and again!

Very salty and lacking in vegetables.  I made this because I had all the ingredients on hand and didn't have time to go to the store, but I would not make this again.

Not overly spicy.  A big hit with my extremely picky vegetarian boyfriend, which means kids will probably like it too.

This is really great.  Would be wonderful for large parties!  I used a two serving can of Hormel Chili with both beef and beans, and then added a 16 oz can of northern beans, a 12 oz can of white shoepeg corn, some lamb vindaloo and basmati rice leftovers from an indian restaurant, 2 cups v8, cayenne pepper, hot sauce, ranch dressing, red pepper flakes, canned green chilies, and a dollop of sour cream and half a handful of sharp cheddar cheese to each bowl.  Can someone say food coma? :)

Easy and delicious! My vegetarian daughters loved it. It was a bit salty with regular taco seasoning instead of low-sodium, so I'll make sure to get the low salt kind next time. Thanks for sharing!

Just as the recipe is titled it was "Unbelievably Easy and Delicious Vegetarian Chili" and was a hit with both vegetarians and meat eaters at a Superbowl Party my husband and I hosted.  I was not sure about the ranch dressing mix, but everything came together well.

Awesome! Everyone loved it and asked for the recipe (always a good sign in my book, lol) And it was just as easy as Tracy B. said it was.   I made a couple adjustments because I was serving it to people who love their chili hot. I used one 10 oz. can of Rotel tomatoes with green chilies and one 14.5 oz. can of regular diced tomatoes instead of the 28 oz. can of diced tomatoes. Plus, I used 'hot' chili beans. Oh yeah, one more change but I doubt it enhanced it at all but after adding the meat, I cooked in a crock pot it on low for 10 hours (you could probably get by with less time - I simply forgot to turn it off :-).

This was SO good!  I actually made it with ground turkey instead of the vegetarian burger crumbles.  My family loved it and we didn't have enough for left overs!

This was great!  I made some changes based on what I had on hand... Used 28oz can crushed tomatoes;1 can Great Northern beans; 1 can Kidney beans; and instead of vege burger crumbles, I shredded 1 package of Tempeh in.  I put everything into the crock pot in the early afternoon on high, cooked for about 3 hours...The Tempeh was great in this chili; it gave an interesting texture to the dish.  Will definately make again.

This chili is amazing! It is by far the best chili I have had in a long time, and it is so easy to make! 
One suggestion is to use only 1/2 a packet of ranch dressing mix and 1/2 a packet of taco seasoning mix. It makes the flavors of the beans and meat stand out more. Delicious!

Awesome! The kids loved it and my husband couldn't believe it was meatless....great texture. I only made a few modifications. I used 1/2 onion and saved the other have to sprinkle on top raw. I added 2/3 of a green bell pepper and substituted 3 tablespoons of chili powder for the taco mix because that is what I had on hand. Very thick chili and delicious.

I love this recipe!  I add green peppers and corn, then cook it for an hour, then, when I put in the "fake meat," I add cinnamon and cilantro.  It's always a hit!

Even without cheese, this isn't vegan. The ranch dip mix contains various milk ingredients, including outright buttermilk. I wasn't too upset (didn't realize it wasn't vegan until after I bought everything), as my boyfriend and I aren't strict vegans. It wouldn't have been as good without the ranch mix. I browned garlic and onion in oil before I added the other ingredients, as well as using tofu instead of beef crumbles to save money. The tofu wasn't needed, and I will be making this without any "fake meat" next time - the chili was so good, it didn't need any! This recipe was simple, easy to make, and so delicious! I will definitely be making this for my boyfriend's family (meat eaters). His mom is allergic to soy protein, so it's great that it's so delicious without it! The only negative about this recipe is that I should have doubled it - 6 servings is not enough to feed my boyfriend! I want at least 3 days worth of left overs! It's so good. I commend you on an excellent recipe, but PLEASE specify why this isn't vegan. 

This is my new go-to food. I'll be making this whenever I go to a BBQ. Those meat eaters won't know what's coming! Who doesn't love chili?!

This is my absolute favorite chili by far - my father, who eats meat, said that it's outstanding and that you'd never know it's vegetarian. It's so delicious and filling that no one would miss the meat anyway!

Super excellent chili recipe!! I love this, it's so delicious! I followed the recipe as written, and I was so skeptical being there isn't that many ingredients, but I was so wrong. So easy to make, especially during a busy weeknight. I topped this with shredded cheddar cheese, sour cream, green onions and black olives. I served this with cornbread also. We loved it, and will be making this again for sure. Thank You :)

Very tasty, extremely quick, and so filling! I rinsed my white beans to get rid of as much salt as possible and added a can of whole kernel corn. I did make this with ground beef and browned that with a clove of garlic. My boyfriend added cayenne pepper to his and I ate mine with a dollop of sour cream... yum! Next time I do think that I would add some tomato juice to give it some more liquid, it was just a tad too thick for us. Very good, thank you :)

The only drawback to this recipe is it's embarrassing when people ask for the recipe!  Not a gourmet chili, but really tasty and absolutely perfect for large groups, and doubly valuable if you have unexpected vegetarians.

OMG!  I tasted it without the protein and it was great.  I did'nt add the cheese and it was still great.  I love to cook but live alone so don't spend too much time unless I'm having guests.  Yes, it is unbelievably easy and  delicious.

I love how easy it is to make and it is very inexpensive too.  I made it the night before a big camping trip and froze it.  It helped keep the things in the cooler cold and when it thawed out we cooked it for dinner.  Yum!

This beats my "I spent all day making this" chili. I added 1 cup frozen corn and 2 tablespoons of brown sugar to cut the acidity of the tomatoes.

I used extra lean ground beef plus added a can of tomato sauce and a can of diced green chilies (I need spice).  It came out great!  Will definitely make this again.

I was short on beans...but....did have a can of Bush's "Grillin Beans, Black Bean Fiesta" in the house so added that (It does have bacon and chicken in the recipe so avoid if your a strict vegetarian!).  Yummy addition to a great recipe!

this was good.  my crockpot was too small to add the burger crumbles so i left that out and it was still good.  also, i took the advice of other reviewers and used 1/2 packet of seasoning mix.  it was a tad salty still and that is why I gave it 4/5 stars.

I thought this was a good chili.  I used homemade ranch dressing mix and homemade taco seasoning--so much easier to make it than to buy it, especially with the amount of spices I have around!  I added some chili powder, but I kind of regret doing so because that made it spicy.  I used veggie burgers and they got a bit mushy.  I thought we'd be eating this at about 2 pm or so, so I put it in the crock pot on high, then I switched it to low after about an hour.  but we didn't end up eating until almost 5 pm, which is why i think the veggie burgers got mushy.  So, if you use the crockpot, don't add your crumbles until maybe the last hour or so of cooking.  Otherwise, this was a nice, warm meal for a cold evening.  And since the problems were all my fault, I'll make this one again when I am wanting vegetarian chili again.  Thanks for the recipe!

The important thing is to use low sodium taco seasoning. I only had regular and it was very salty. I only used half of the ranch packet and I added some diced bell pepper and celery.  Next time I will make sure to use low sodium seasoning. The flavor was delicious and my whole family loved it.

I'm always interested in recipes with a short list of ingredients! I agree with the other reviewers, this was very tasty. I made a few modifications. Instead of taco seasoning, I used Mexican-flavored veggie burger crumbles. I also didn't add the Ranch packet, because I'm trying to eat as many natural foods as possible. I didn't add cheese, either, and I didn't miss it. In addition, I cooked some whole grain quinoa, and served the chili over the quinoa. Delicious! I will be making this again.

Love this chili!!  So does my husband who is a die hard meat lover, along with every one of my other friends who has had it.  Great for casual parties!!  I make a full crockpot of it, and rarely have leftovers for more than a day or two!  Very flexible in regards to type of beans/amounts etc. also!

This is a very quick and easy recipe. I made it with three alterations: I sauteed the onion with two cloves of garlic in the same pot before adding the rest of the ingredients. I used canned whole tomatoes, since I had those on hand. I also left out the veggie crumbles, since I couldn't find them at my grocery store. The flavors were great, but a little intense for me - I think that next time I will use half a pack each of ranch mix and taco mix, and it will be perfect. But the easiest, tastiest chili recipe I have found yet.

This was so fast and easy, and it tasted great. The store where I usually do my shopping stopped carrying burger crumbles, so I used TVP. I added a can of vegetable stock to the mix (to reconstitute the TVP) and added the TVP after bringing it to a boil. Will definitely be making this again!

Perfect for chili and corn bread! I make this on those nights that I really don't want to cook! I add a can of corn and another can of beans to it and sometimes it I want even more texture I will add a package of original smart ground (this one is good because it's so dry already) to it.

I've made this twice and it's dynamite!  A hit among vegetarians and non-vegetarians alike!  The only thing I added was that I crumbled some tortilla chips in the bottom of the bowl before serving to give it a little crunch.  I'm definitely going to make this one of my regular dishes!

OK, I never review stuff but this is amazing! I am a picky vegetarian and I loved this, I mean I couldn't stop eating it. I did add an extra can of beans, a can of corn and a can of crushed tomatoes so that the seasoning was not too strong. I have never made anything so easy and so good!! It is worth making since the leftovers are just as good.

I only tried this because I was craving chili and, since I'm not much of a cook, this recipe looked super simple.  Wow, was I pleasantly surprised!  Not only was it quite possibly the simplest recipe I've ever tried, but it tasted great too!  And I didn't even use the burger crumbles!  To make this dish stretch a little farther, I added a can of red kidney beans, a can of corn, and an extra can of chili beans.  When I put it in bowls, I topped it off with grated cheese, Fritos, a spoonful of sour cream, and sliced olives.  Yum!  I had three helpings myself and nobody even mentioned the lack of meat!  This recipe is definitely a keeper for me!

This chili made me a super star! I cook only because I have to, so whatever I do HAS to be easy.  I made this chili and everyone freaked out like it was the best chili in the world. Sometimes i make it with ground turkey for the meat lovers and it is delicious. thank you thank you thank you for this amazingly easy yummy perfect recipe!

I wish I could give this one more stars.  I was curious about the ingredients and made this.  I did put ground turkey in and I used 2 cans of chili beans as I love them.  What a wonderfully easy way to make chili and very tasty.  I used the left overs to make nachos.  I used baked chips and 2% Mexican cheese.  What a great, lo-cal, lo-fat appetizer. Thank you for a keeper.

WOW! When I read this recipe I was more than skeptical but the raving reviews lured me in.  Let me start by saying I am absolutely a chili snob.  I made this today and was pleasantly surprised.  I did a few things different, I browned about 1/2 lb ground beef with 2 cloves of minced harlic and added that to the pot.  I also thought I had bought Ranch Dresisng mix when I actually bought Ranch Dip mix, I almost ran back out to the store but it was too late, the snow was already falling hard.  I used about 3/4 of the Taco Seasoning packet and about 1/2-3/4 of the Dip packet.  As i was tasting it I added slightly more taco seasoning than dip mix because I felt it tasted a little too tangy (maybe because it was dip & not dresisng), I also added about 2 tspn of chili powder and a pinch or 2 of crushed red pepper flakes.  It was quick, simple and surprisingly good.  My husband even loved and he is a BIG fan of my usual chili, he ate his with some totilla chips and mine was plain.  Also, I didn't realize until we were done eating that I totally forgot to add the onion.  I will definitely make this again - with the onion and with dressing mix instead of dip mix to see if there is a difference between the two.

So darn easy. Definitely add a can of corn. Hardly any cleanup. And those soy crumbles are completely beef-like. Who knew?! Plus they're inexpensive and healthy - the best thing I learned from this recipe.

This was pretty good, and I will probably make it again.  I'm not vegetarian, but still used Boca "Ground Beef" and I didn;t really notice a difference.  I bet it would be good with actual ground beef also.  I added some chili powder just because I wanted to, but probably didn't need it.  Even my friends, who were hesitant about the fake ground beef, liked it.  This was tasty.

I am making this "again" for a church soup dinner. (Last time they licked the pot clean.) The first time I made this a couple years ago during a horrible ice storm. I made this for my vegetarian daughter and my regular chili for the rest of the gang. Once the family had this wonderful  vegetarian chili they refused, yes refused to eat the meat variety. (My husband even questioned whether it really was vegetarian.) I love how quick and easy it is to make and it is so low in fat with the soy crumbles. Thank you for the great recipe...it's a keeper out our house.

This chili was fantastic considering it takes only five minutes to prepare.  My nonvegetarian husband loves it just as much as I do.  Much better tasting and healthier than store bought chili.

I might try this again.  I thought the ranch flavor was a bit overpowering, so I'd cut it in half.  Also, mine was way too salty, which was likely my fault because I used a fajita seasoning rather than low-sodium taco seasoning.  Next time I think I'll make my own chili seasoning for it.

definitely extremely easy and fast...i changed the recipe however, and it still came out great (but spicier than I had expected).  i added 1lb ground turkey, some whole wheat elbow macaroni noodles, a can of "rotel", some chili powder, 2 cans of tomato sauce and one can of tomato soup.  then i had to add water because it was still very dry with the added meat and noodles.  i added 2 cups of water and then it was perfect! SO EASY

Not a vegetarian, and I was VERY skeptical about the veggie crumbles. Well, it was GREAT!  We couldn't even tell it wasn't real meat...my kids never would have touched it if they knew. 

Only modification was I added a can of kidney beans.

Try it!

Way too easy! I used half package of ranch and half of taco seasoning, and left out the TVP, and added a tsp of chili powder.  I recommend draining the beans- less sodium and thicker chili.   YUMMY! My friends loved it, even the super carnivore!

Absolutely fantastic recipe! I accidentally bought soy taco filling instead of regular soy ground beef so I just omitted the taco seasoning. It tasted amazing even with the revision and only took about 10 minuets start to finish.

The plus for this recipe: VERY easy to make. I literally dumped in the required incredients, turned the burner on low  and walked away. Chili does not get any easier.

Overall, the chili had a great smell but was way too salty. (For the record, my husband didn't mind it at all.) I followed the directions exactly, but if I made this recipe again, I would only put half a packet of ranch mix in.

Yummy, yummy, yummy and super simple to make.  The only thing i changed on this recipe is I halfed the crumbles to use in another recipe later.  I cook for two (me and a 5 year old) and I don't want to make too much food.

Very good and easy.  I followed the recipe exactly but added frozen corn which gave the chili additional color and flavor.  Definitely better the next day.

I'm a vegetarian college student with very little time or energy to cook.  The ingredients are cheap, and all you do is throw it in the pot and it's ready in minutes.  Super easy and super flavorful!  I'm glad I found this recipe :)

It's good! I thought it would be too much taco seasoning, but it works out. I used barley instead of the meat crumbles and added corn.

tastes great, easy to make, and goes quick! if you're cooking for a family and want leftovers you might want to double the ingredients for a big batch.

Loved how simple this was, although I made some modifications: added two bell peppers (one red, one green) and used a can of mixed beans instead of chili beans--the chickpeas in it really added a nice flavour and consistency. I also added two handfuls of TVP; it didn't change the taste and added quite a bit more protein. Topped it off with some plain Greek yogurt, yum!

Really tasty - but I made mine with homemade ranch mix (just the spices, no buttermilk), homemade taco seasoning, and added about 1/2 can of tomato sauce. The ingredients on ranch mix are, to put it mildly, TERRIFYING. Really. Packaged taco seasoning is slightly better, but can have yeast extract - which is kinda like MSG. Ranch mix outright says it has MSG. 
Anyway. Quick and easy!

We're not a vegetarian family but we have been making an effort to incorporate some meatless meals into our weekly menu and this was pretty lack luster compared to regular chilli. I think it was the taco and ranch seasonings as opposed regular chilli seasoning. I also used crumbled baked tofu tossed in the taco seasoning as the "meat" which worked out well. I had to add a lot of garlic, red pepper flakes and chilli spice to try and make it taste more like chilli.

I am using up dried beans that have hung out too long so I soaked them rather than buying canned beans. My husband loved it. I'm happy about my increased cupboard space. The lady who said it was salty must not have used the low sodium taco seasoning as directed in the recipe because this was not salty at all.

This recipe is soooo easy! The only thing I changed was I did not add the veggie crumble ( just a personal preference).  I just ate some of the leftovers for lunch today and it was even better then it was last night. I will never buy canned chili again! Thank you for the recipe :-)

Delicious! I loved this recipe but I added some fresh corn and did without the ranch mix. Used garlic powder, black pepper, cayenne, and dill instead. It wasn't too salty like some are complaining. I think this is a good alternative!

Easy, delicious and filling.  We only sprinkle a bit of the taco seasoning and ranch mix into it while cooking, we don't use the whole package. If I do not have an onion handy, I use 1/4 to 1/2 of a lipton recipe secrets onion soup/dip mix and its wonderful. thank you for sharing!

I made this for my vegetarian son. He's a bit picky about his chili and he loved it. He particularly liked the consistency. I will be making it again. I did not make any changes to the recipe.

This is my new go to for chili, though I just dump everything into the crock pot for 3-4 hours on high to make it even easier. I used the Taco Seasoning I and Ranch dressing seasoning on Allrecipes instead of the packaged kind (about 2 tbsp of each) and it's so flavorful, and even more so the second day! I also use pinto, black beans, or navy beans, depending on what I have on hand, which works just fine. This recipe has been requested by two of my friends already, who raved about it when I made it. Delicious!

I love this recipe! I'm not a big fan of tomatoes so swapped in a can of corn instead. It's so delicious and easy, a nice go-to recipe for busy nights when everyone is hungry and no one has the energy to cook. Highly recommend making cornbread to go with it!

Made this for my 14-year old daughter who is a recent vegetarian and she LOVED it.  I can not express how easy this was.  We did add Portabella Mushrooms which made a great addition.  Will definitely make this again.

I found it TOO salty even though I used 1/2 packet of both taco seasoning (LOW SODIUM pack) and  ranch dressing mix. However, it was still delicious! I also added crushed fresh garlic, green bell peppers and frozen corn. Will recommend and make again. Only next time I will add less of the taco and ranch seasoning packets.

I followed this recipe exactly. It was delicious. I brought it to a potluck and it was eaten up by vegetarians and omnivores alike! I brought a bag of Fritos to add and make Frito pie and it was even more delicious. I will make this many more times.

Great recipe for my school's spooktacular spuds luncheon!
Received many compliments.  I added a can of corn and skipped the vegan meat ingredient.  The chili is
also really tasty with spaghetti.  Thanks!

This chili is amazing! I was looking for a filling recipe to take to work for lunch. The veggie crumbles and beans add a lot of protein and make it very filling. The juice from the tomatoes and chili beans give it the perfect chili consistency. The ranch seasoning may sound weird but still include it! It helps the flavor! I added Fritos and shredded cheese to make of a frito pie and it makes it even better. This also makes a lot of chili so it is perfect for a family, or to make on a Sunday night and take it to work for lunch each day or have it for dinner.

I like this recipe as it is, but I also like my version of it. I make the ranch dressing mix myself by adding buttermilk and spices straight to pot and I substitute vegetarian burger crumbles with quorn. Even my meatlover husband loves this chili. Thank you so much for sharing this recipe!

Great starter recipe although it was quite salty.  I made a few changes the 2nd time and then it was 5 stars.  

I started off my sautéing one chopped green pepper, one chopped onion, and one chopped Anaheim chili (de-seeded).  After this I added the diced tomatoes and seasoning packets.  I brought it to a low boil and simmered for about 25-30 minutes.  Then I added 2 cans of chili beans.  Although I’m a vegetarian, I don’t like fake meat look-a-likes so I omitted the fake crumbles.  The recipe is really hearty and doesn’t need it at all.  

Like all chili’s, this chili is better the 2nd day!
