It was waaaay too sweet (called for too much powdered sugar). I could not even get the hint of the beautiful browned butter or vanilla due to the sweetness of the powdered sugar.
Headed in the right direction, but not getting there yet. Thank you, though!

This was an easy recipe to make, worked great for my cinnamon rolls, but it makes a huge amount of icing. I would only need about 1/4 of the recipe for a 9x12 pan of cinnamon rolls. Will make it again.
