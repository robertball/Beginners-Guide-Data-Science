Moist carrot cake. I cut the sugar in half and used half oil half apple sauce. Would be great with cream cheese icing.  If making it again I would add more cinnamon.

Follow this recipe exactly for perfect baking results.  So moist and just sweet enough with a thin cream cheese frosting of your choice.

Nice and moist...

I use self raising flour instead of AP flour, therefore did not use baking powder and baking soda.

I have reduce the sugar. I use 1cup of caster sugar and half cup of brown sugar as I do not have ground cinammon.

Nice, moist batter. I did about 2 tsp cinnamon and 1.5 tsp nutmeg, subbed in applesauce for about half of the oil, reduced the sugar to about 1.5 cups, added cranberries and chopped pecans, baked it as cupcakes, and frosted with cream cheese frosting. The results were delicious and rose well, considering how moist and full of chunks the batter was.

Good recipe. Needs a bit more flour or less oil to make a great batter. Added orange zest to add some flavor .
