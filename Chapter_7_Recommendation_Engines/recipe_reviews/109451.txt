I did this just a little bit differently.  I sauteed the pork in the pan first and then removed it...then made the sauce in the same pan so I could use all the little bits of flavor stuck to the bottom.  I cooked the mushrooms first, added flour to the mushrooms to cook for a bit (to get rid of the "floury" taste).  Then added the wet ingredients.  I then added the pork to the pan again for about 10 minutes to cook in the sauce to reheat.  Turned out really well.  Thanks for the post.

I followed the recipe loosely, using it basically as a guide. I used the traditional flour, egg, bread crumb method for breading, a little more seasoning in the crumbs, some shallots along with the mushrooms and garlic and a good deal of chicken broth along with the wine for the gravy. Didn't bother to measure anything, just used all ingredients to taste or as needed. We loved it.

I'm not sure if this dish came out looking the way it was supposed to for me.  But even if it didn't- I can certainly say that it was delicious!  We all loved it just the way it was.  No changes- great dish!

We went to a German restaurant recently and had their schnitzel.  My husband has been craving it since.  We decided to try this one.   A very easy and flavorful recipe.  We made a dijon mustard cream sauce to accompany our schnitzel.  Great dish.  Adding to the recipe box and will be making again.  Thank you  for sharing this.

Great recipe, I have switched up the parsley flakes with others like tarragon, basil and rosemary depending on the side dish I serve.

Delicious!  I had a pork loin that I cut into abaout 6 slices and then pounded.  I also thinned the mushroom butter sauce down by putting about 3 Tblsp of water into the pan I browned the pork in, loosened the drippings and tasty bits then added to the mushroom sauce.  This was so good.  Will definately be making this again but will make a bit more sauce next time.

I read the reviews first and decided to follow the suggestions of others who cooked the pork first (I used panko bread crumbs instead because I like the texture better). I also cooked the pork at least 8 minutes on each side, then removed the pork and subsequently made the sauce in the same pan. 

I used 5 cloves of garlic and 1 shallot with the butter and sauted for about a minute then added the sliced mushrooms and cooked for a couple of minutes. Then added about 1/2 cup white wine and about 1 1/2 cups chicken broth and let it cook down until the alcohol evaporates some, then combined the cornstarch and water and added to the sauce.

This turned out fabulous!

I served with garlic mashed potatoes and green beans.

I didn't use the sauce, because we don't like mushrooms, but the pork was delicious!  Since I did not use the sauce, I decided to add some garlic powder to the bread crumb mixture and it worked well.  I made 6 pork loin chops for my husband and I, but I will definitely make more next time!  It was so good, that it barely lasted for more than one meal.  Loved it!

This was so tasty! The only change I made to the recipe was to cook the pork first and kept warm in the oven at 200 degrees, then made the gravy. Served with garlic mashed potatoes and peas- such a comforting meal!

The breading for this recipe is definitely good.  I would use it again for breaded pork chops.  However, I wasn't really impressed with the sauce.  The amount of butter seems a bit excessive.  It was oily and the flavor was flat.  I had to add additional seasonings to enhance the flavor.

Delicious. I did have to alter slightly, lcaking some ingredients, substituting others.: used saltine crackers, not bread crumbs, along with cornmeal; red not white wine, but still was really good. Will try this again with all the right stuff, and it will surely be just as good!

I followed some of the changes recommended by other reviewers.  Overall it was a great recipe.  Flour, egg then breadcrumb for the cutlets.  Added additional  cup of chicken stock to the pan for additional gravy and increased the corn starch by a tablespoon.  You can never have enough gravy ;)

Pretty good, but I also found the butter content to be excessive. I would go so far as to quarter it the next time I make it. This was pretty quick and easy, good weekday meal.

Was very very good, I subbed chicken stock with a squeeze of lemon for the white wine, cut back on the butter two four tablespoons, used the dripping of the pan from frying the pork, tossed in some garlic  and chopped onions then add some cremini mushrooms and sauteed. Then added the stock lemon, cornstarch and water together mixed and added it to the pan. Overall my hubby said yummy make it again..not enough gravy. oh well will have to double it next time.

I'm sorry, I just didn't think the breading was very flavorful(are others using Italian bread crumbs, maybe??) & the sauce was just melted butter w/mushrooms...so, very greasy/oily. I didn't find that the wine added anything to this.

Very good even if you only use the breading to fry the chops. Oh I added a little green onion when cooking the garlic to add in the gravy.

I scaled this recipe back and made it using 4 thick-cut pork chops.  After I browned them, I put them in the oven to finish cooking and topped them with the sauce.  Delicious!

I made similar changes as other reviewers that I felt added a depth of flavor to our liking.....I used a more traditional schnitzel egg/milk wash, flour dredge,  another egg/milk wash, then a final crumb approach.  I added more parm, granulated garlic, granulated onion, S&P to the breadcrumb mixture.  I sauteed the pork then kept it warm in the oven while I deglazed the same pan for the sauce.  I added several splashes of chicken broth to the wine that poached the mushrooms instead of a saute.....try this on top of some butter/parm dressed egg noodles and this site's 'Baked Acorn Squash with Apple Stuffing' recipe or some homemade applesauce for a nice fall/winter meal.  Thanks for the recipe!

I love this recipe! I scaled it to 3 and kinda wish I hadn't...the only change I made was to swap the wine (which I thought I had) for beer. I did salt my mushrooms at the table, they were good but the salt made them great (my butter was unsalted just for the record). Got to use my brand new meat mallet and work off some aggression too! Thanks for this delicious simple super-fast recipe!

I really enjoyed this recipe.  The pork was so tender.  I too reduced the amount of butter in the sauce.  I used cremini mushrooms and sautéed them before adding the wine.  I would have given this 4.5 stars if possible.  My husband really liked this also.

I had been looking for a new, simple way to cook the same old boneless pork chops.  I tried this recipe and my husband loves it!  Quick and easy, and the mushroom sauce is delicious!  I prepared the recipe as directed, except that I used apple juice instead of white wine.

I loved this. It was my first time ever cooking pork and it turned out great. We can eat mushrooms in my house so I made extra sauce and put the pork over mash potatoes to make a "meal" will make monthly.

The sauce wouldn't thicken. Tried thickening it with sour cream and flour, which ended up in little curdles. Finally blended the whole thing, which turned out... surprisingly good :) the schnitzels turned out really well.

Thus recipe is delicious. The only thing I did different is that I fried the chops first in a couple of tbsp of olive oil and then in the same pan drippings I cooked the mushroom gravy sauce  as the recipe called for. My Family loved it. Thank you for sharing this recipe.

We all loved this recipe - I tweaked the sauce a fair amount with salt, parsley, pepper, more garlic, and more wine and used about 3TBS capers instead of mushrooms (to use what I already had). It was so delicious all together. I used thin cut chops and we halved the recipe - wonderful.

Family loved... But I made a different gravy, not enough mushroom lovers in my home - but the pork was awesome!

I used pre-tenderized pork leg cutlets, and that part of the recipe was very good.  I added a bit of oregano.  The mushroom "sauce" on the other hand was just incredibly greasy mushrooms.  The right mushroom sauce would be good in this recipe but this mushroom sauce isn't it.

this was decent, but not something to rave over.  I have made this twice, and the mushroom butter sauce has yet to turn out correctly, and turns out to be more of a gloop than a sauce.  will keep to my original schnitzel recipe.

The pork chops turned out so good I think I might use this recipe everytime.  I didn't make the sauce though as I don't really like the ingredients.  I just fried the chops up, and made some mashed potatoes.  Sorry, so I can't comment on the sauce.

When I added the cornstarch mixed in water, it turned into a patches of thick paste instead of a sauce-like mixture. I don't know what went wrong.

This was delicious. I do not use alcohol of any kind so I substituted 1 1/2 cups of chicken broth and used 5 fresh large white mushrooms sliced. I did season them with a little salt and pepper while cooking, and left everything else the same. The chops were very tender. The coating was a treat. At the end I poured the mushroom mixture over the chops in the pan but it soaked up the sauce. Next time I will just plate the chops and pour the mushroom sauce over them as per the instructions which would make a much better presentation. I served them with garlic smashed potatoes and peas. A very tasty and satisfying meal.

This is a really amazing recipe!  I did deviate from the recipe just a little.  Instead of using mushrooms, I just used cream of mushroom soup and eliminated the cornstarch and water.  The whole family loves this!

Cooking this---it smelled wonderful.  We started on the grill with a large caste iron pan.  Per a suggestion, we browned the pounded pork in the pan then removed them.  Next we sauteed the garlic and mushrooms, until the mushrooms sweated and were slightly tender.  Adding the wine and corn starch slurry.   Then added some of the pork back into the pan.   It looked and smelled wonderful.  The sauce was bitter.  I think it was too much wine.  I would imagine using some wine but mostly chicken broth might help with the bitter taste.  Oh, and the amount of bread crumbs was too much---I had 1/2 left over.  I used 2 pounds of pork sirloin 'steaks' pounded thin.  I had great expectations for this one.

I found that the wine overpowered the sauce a bit. And unfortunately I’m not a fan. The butter and mushrooms helped. Also for thickening it’s equal parts fat and flower (which is also cornstarch). I unfortunately didn’t do that and the sauce was not as thick

I know this is terrible to have done to such a great recipe, but I was looking for something fast... so i substituted 1 can of cream of mushroom soup in lieu of mushrooms, and as much water as fills the soup can. Used sherry instead of wine. Added butter to pork pan sauteed garlic quickly as instructed then deglazed with the sherry. Once really heated, added soup and water. Left out cornstartch ( totally wasn't needed thickened from the soup) Simmered for 10 minutes. Served over the pork with pickled red cabbage & carrots. 45 minutes! SUPER DELICIOUS! THANK YOU FOR SHARING THIS!

What an easy and tasty recipe. Following the advice of another reviewer, I did flour, egg and bread the cutlets and fry them first in olive oil. Removing them and picking up the recipe adding butter and garlic. I started out with 1/2 inch cutlets and pounded down to a 1/4".  Frying them about 4 minutes per side. So nice to have a different recipe for pork cutlets.

Spent time in Germany and this closely resembles the Schnitzel I enjoyed there. I did not substitute or add any ingredients. I did however cook the pork chops first, placed them on a cookie sheet, covered them with foil and put them in the oven to keep warm while I made the sauce.
I made the sauce with a quality white wine and it turned out sooo good!My son lived in Germany for 3 years and claims this recipe as his favourite! Many thanks for this great recipe!

So delicious! Even my 8 year old ate it and asked for seconds!  I followed one reviewer and fried pork first, then made the sauce in the same pan, the sauce was so good, I'll double it next time as we were all fighting over it.

I pretty much made it by the book as stated.   I added quite a bit of chopped fresh parsley to the sauce just because I had it, but it didnt need it. I added red bell pepper rub to the breading also just because I had it, it didnt need it. My husband said the Pork Chops were really tender, which he NEVER says about meat I cook lol!

Absolutely delicious!  It was so good the refrigerated left overs were gone by the time we went to bed that night.  I found it helpful to add generous amounts of butter during frying time to keep the schnitzel from drying out.  I will certainly be cooking this recipe again.

Excellent! I have been looking for pork chop recipes that result in moist chops. This is it.
After reading other comments, I added thyme, tarragon and sage to the bread crumbs. Reduced the butter, since I only made 4 chops. Used the mushroom pan to sear the chops.
I will make this recipe again with more mushrooms.

I went to Germany 3 months ago and fell in love with Schnitzel!
I wanted to recreate it,  and this recipe is just that. My family of 5 raved about how delicious this was. I don't think its the actual fried pork loin, it is the sauce. Yummy! I am not a wine drinker and don't really care for the taste of wine so I cut the wine portion to half. Make extra sauce because everybody was fighting over it. Delicious!! This will be in my recipe book forever.

The family loved it. The only changes I made was I used half the amount of butter  and added onions to the mushrooms.

Very tasty. My husband rarely says anything I make is worth making again, but when he ate 2 plates, told me to send recipe to his dad, and keep it in my repertoire, I knew he liked it. I don't like mushrooms so I just picked them out.

Very good, maybe a little too complicated for some child pallets, my son wasn't a huge fan as the wine, even after cooking the sauce for 15 minutes, was pungent. Husband said its one of his favorite meals that I've made, and I was very happy with how it turned out as well. Boiled some spaetzle and made creamed spinach with a German white wine and listened to some German folk music. Fun culture night for the family.

This was very bland.  It did not taste bad, but it was not noteworthy either.

This was really good. I didn't have any white wine so I used chicken broth instead. I had a ton of bread crumbs left over so I will cut that in half next time. Def will make again!
