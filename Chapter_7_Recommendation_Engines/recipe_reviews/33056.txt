Being a Flan lover, I had to try this recipe.  The instructions are not very clear.  You should prepare the pan were you are going to bake the flan (caramelized) and in the blender mix the rest of the ingredients.  Pour the mix over caramelized pan and bake.  It took a litle more than one hour, but is is worth it.  It is delicious!!!

I make flan all the time. I've made all kinds but I had never made mango flan. I bought mango pulp that comes frozen (Goya brand carries many fruits this way) and it was about 1- 1/2 cups of fruit rather than 2 cups. Other than that, I followed the recipe for the flan including the rum. I do make my caramel differently. Over the years I've found that making it in the microwave in a Pyrex glass measuring cup is way easier.  Add 1 cup of sugar and 1/2 cup water to the Pyrex dish and heat on high until it turns an amber color. Do not let it get too dark or it will taste burnt. This usually takes about 7-10 minutes. Pour that caramel in your pan and distribute it evenly in the bottom and sides of the pan. Do it fast as it will harden, but that's ok. I added all the flan ingredients in a blender and mixed them up there to create a smoother consistency. Then I poured the mix in the pan that had the caramel. I did the Bain Marie as indicated but had to bake longer than 45 minutes for it to set. It took about 60-70 minutes instead. Cool down, put in refrigerator and flip on to a platter when ready to serve. It looks gorgeous!!

This is a good Flan recipe. If you are looking for pudding, look elsewhere. It is a bummer that the person rated it low because they were expecting a pudding. Flan is more of a custard than a pudding.  **Important note!! This (and all Flan) recipe is mediocre at best if served warm fresh out of the oven. Make sure you chill it at least one day in the fridge before serving, and you will have everyone asking for seconds.   I switched the rum for Amaretto, and used key lime juice instead of lemon juice. Also, I used much less sugar for the caramel than it calls for, and it turned out great.

I love mango pudding so i tried this recipe. I did not like the pudding at all! It was too sweet and the mango pudding didn't taste right....my suggestion: if u want mango pudding...try the recipes that was some sort of gelatin for the setting of the pudding...those tend to be not so heavy and syruppy...

Did not like it. My husband and I love mango, so I decided to give this a try. It didn't taste like mango at all to us.  I would not make this dessert again.

My husband and I make this recipe and come out great, good flavor and consistency. But will taste much better if you make the mango puree with ripe mangoes. And real ones too, not those which came y cans with syrup because the flan will taste oversweet.

Living in Panama and having many mango trees, I had to try this. It came out wonderful! I read the other reviews and I think maybe the "powdery" taste that one person talked about may have came from not fully ripe mangos. Also the ones who said it was not like a pudding, well it's not a pudding it's flan. It's a type of custard dessert. If you like flan, you will like this!

I didn't like this at all. I made the recipe exactly like stated, but it tasted powdery. Which i suppose came from the corn starch, which Ive never seen in flan before.

I made this last night put it in the refrigerator overnight and tasted it this morning and it was delicious!!! Being hispanic flan is something we have constantly for dessert. I loved the flavor! Mango brings such a refreshing taste to flan! The only change that I made was used 10oz of sweetened condensed milk only because I didn't have enough, and I also omitted the rum since I didn't have any but other than that I followed the recipe exactly and my family loved it! It's already being requested for a birthday on Monday!

Never did fully set even after an hour+,so I baked it for 25 minutes then kept it in the fridge overnight. Was a good breakfast after i drained all the sugar water off, which I used for lemonade. To much hassle to make again. Gotta find some other way to use my mangos

The instructions on here had me confused so I went to the Flan de Coconut recipe which helped me out. I just was not a huge fan of the flavor here, but the texture was great and it was simple to make.

Made it, love it. Followed LatinCook's recommendation to: "Add 1 cup of sugar and 1/2 cup water to the Pyrex dish and heat on high until it turns an amber color. Do not let it get too dark or it will taste burnt. This usually takes about 7-10 minutes. Pour that caramel in your pan and distribute it evenly in the bottom and sides of the pan. Do it fast as it will harden, but that's ok" but warmed my pan on very low burners on the stove which made it amazingly easy to distribute. THANKS FOR THE TIP LatinCook!  Other than that followed the recipe - it was a hit!

This was a hit on our Thanksgiving dessert table!  ...and a note to several folks here who gave poor reviews...and those who says it is runny...Use a good mango puree...not mashed fresh mango...&/or  you probably failed to properly thicken the custard before baking...a good FLAN is a science!  This recipe is excellent!
