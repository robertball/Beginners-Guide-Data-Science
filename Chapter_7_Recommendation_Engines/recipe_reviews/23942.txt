I made these for a friend's wedding reception, and they went over very well!  Although, when someone asked me for the recipe, I realized that I used twice the amount of sour cream (16 oz containers instead of 8 oz)!!!  It didn't seem to matter though.  Needless to say, they were very creamy!

Thanks for an easy and great tasting appetizer. Your creation will be on my New Years Eve Buffet, for sure. I will be adding some finely grated Parmesan Reggiano to the mix.

Delicious and easy to make!  I used green onion dip instead of sour cream and used chopped green onion gave it a wonderful flavor.

Great flavor, but it was very loose as others had stated.  I would make again and totally remove the sour cream.

I wasn't overly impressed with this recipe.  Maybe it was the horseradish and onion that made it taste too raw.  However, they were very easy to make.

My great aunt made a similar recipe to this every year for our family Christmas party. I don't have her recipe and was trying this one to see if it was the same as hers, but the filling in these is too runny. The flavor was good, but they are difficult to cut for hors d'oeuvres. Next time I will use a very small amount of sour cream.

i personally found this recipe pretty good. I had to have pickles or cucumbers with it. Also I battered them up in egg then breaded them with bread crumbs and fried them they where awesome that way as well. I think the horse radish was what gave it that kick that made them so delicious

I LOVE ham rolls and I like horseradish too but the combination was strange. The recipe made a lot and I had a lot left over. I think next time I might just spread them with some french onion dip.
