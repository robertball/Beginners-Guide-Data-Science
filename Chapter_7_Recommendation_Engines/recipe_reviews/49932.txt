As a healthnut, I'm rating this very high because I've changed it to be 'very-Healthy.'  I try to include ingredients that provide the most-nutritional benefit, cut calories and fat, and include good fats and flavor. This is my healthy version of this recipe:  The first [4] ingredients stay the same.  I used 1/2 cup oatmeal, 2 egg whites, 1 chopped RED onion, 1/2 cup shredded Reduced-FAT Pepper Jack cheese (optional), 4 oz Vanilla Greek yogurt (Chobani), 1/2 tsp of each:  oregano, cumin, garlic pwdr, & Cayenne Pepper, and 2 tblsp. olive or canola oil... I cooked the lentils in water first.  Then, drained and added them to everything else. (I don't like my veggies mushy, so I DON'T saute them before forming patties).  Shaped into patties, and baked @ 375 for 12 to 15 minutes.

Great recipe, I added parmesan cheese and omitted the walnuts. Instead of frying I baked in the oven on sprayed cookie sheets.

Very tasty! We are not veggies, but we loved this anyway. Did not use cereal (didn't have any) and only used half of the soup mix. I was afraid of the salt content. We ate the patties with Sweet Chile Sauce that you can buy at the chinese grocery store. It's kinda like a duck sauce with a kick. Thanks for the recipe, again, we loved it.

Pretty good, but very easy and cheap, especially if you omit the walnuts like I did. Didn't have poultry seasoning so I used a mix of oregano, parsely, black pepper, dash of coriander and some garlic powder. I also used red lentils instead of brown, since that is what I had. Mixed a few breadcrumbs in, but didn't bread them on the outside. Ate with ketchup and honey mustard. Probably will make again.

These were a really great surprise.  I made them this week and they have a wonderful flavor and texture.  I did not coat in breadcrumbs and the browned lentils in the pan were really tasty. I served them on hamburger buns with all of the fixins....good stuff.  They don't reheat well, though, so only cook them to order and save the leftover mix for leftover night.

I really did enjoy this recipe.  I did add a handfull of flax seeds.  I think this recipie freezes well.  I like to eat these crispified patties with fried mushrooms/onions and melted swiss topped off with steamy marinara sauce, it's very delicious and thank you for the recipie.

These were so delicious! I am trying to eat more beans and lentils, so I decided to give this recipe a try. I had cooked lentils before, but really hated them, so I was skeptical  about these at first.

I couldn't find brown lentils at the grocery store, so I used green instead. I used almond milk instead of cows milk, 1 cup of quick oats instead of wheat barley cereal, egg substitute instead of real eggs, olive oil instead of vegetable oil, and finally I put two pieces of multi grain bread in the toaster, and then put them in the blender to make the bread crumbs. I also put the walnuts in the blender to chop them up.

I ate them without a bun and just added ketchup. I fell in love at first bite! This is saying a lot. I am a very fussy eater!

These were perfect substitutes for hamburgers!  I left out the bread crumbs because I didn't have any, but these lentil patties were still lovely.  They were somewhat crumbly, so I think next time I will put all the ingredients in a blender so they really mix into one.

Just finished making these, they're delicious.  I didn't have any cereal on hand, so I added 1/2 cup of breadcrumbs to the mixture.  I did not bread them before frying.  I will definitely make this recipe again but will try using a blender next time to make them less 'lentil-y'

I improvised just a little from the original recipe to create a vegan style Lentil Pattie. Instead of eggs, I used 4 TBS of ground flax and a small amt of water. This is a great binder as well. I also used soy milk instead of regular milk. Vegetarian or vegan style, this is a great recipe. :)

So I made these because we're moving soon and I'm trying to get rid of stuff in my pantry.  I had about a cup of lentils that's been in there for who knows how long.  Anyway, because my goal was to decumulate, I was not going to go out and buy more ingredients.  So here are my substitutions and let me say, this was quite delicious!

Oatmeal instead of cereal, pecans instead of walnuts, ranch mix instead of onion soup mix/poultry seasoning.  Yes, those are some major changes but the recipe author wrote that she also has played around with the ingredients too so I think she'd approve!

I did change it a bit, and it was delish! I am on a no/low/sodium diet with low carbs, so I omitted the onion soup mix. I boiled the lentils with crushed tomatoes and basil added to the water, along with smoked paprika, garlic, onion, black pepper, dried chives, oregano and cayenne pepper sauce. I subbed oatmeal for the grape nuts. I also omitted the bread crumbs and nuts. I blended 1 red bell pepper, 1 red onion, mushrooms and a handful of baby carrots in a cuisinart, and added that to the cooked lentils and oatmeal. Subbed egg whites. Grilled on a flat top grill....amazing, my whole family raved. I topped mine with avocado and tomato, but others were putting it on a bun with all the fixing of a traditional burger. Great base recipe that one can build on to suit their own needs! Thank you!

Another variation on a great recipe is to cook the lentils in chicken stock, which gives them great flavor, mix the cooked lentils with 1 cup oatmeal, 1/2 cup walnut, add a pinch of salt, and some chili flakes and pepper, two instead of three eggs, mix well, and then scoop out and dip patties in bread crumbs, and fry. Serve with yogurt sauce (yogurt, garlic, mint) and serve in warmed tortilla.

I made these for my parents and they loved them.  They both are serious meat eaters, but also both agreed that I should have made a double recipe so we could freeze some to have on hand all the time. I made them pretty much by the recipe, but used about half as much milk as called for and substituted oats for half of the Grape Nuts.  I also didn't use the bread crumbs and cooked them on the bbq, making Mom and Dad feel like they were eating meat.  Next time I will probably play around with the spices a little and go for a spicy, Mexican flavor.

Amazing!  I'm not a vegetarian and a fan of meat but these are still amazing!  I like to prepare them in patties ahead of time and then freeze until I'm ready to cook them for an easy meal.

Very tasty! I had never had lentils before (to my knowledge), but I'm trying to eat better and found this recipe. I didn't add walnuts. I couldn't find dry brown lentils at the store, but found the canned version (which would be easier because you don't have to do the first step). However, I noticed the texture of the mixture didn't hold up well and was falling apart and making a mess. So I added and extra egg (total of 3), which did the trick! It was delicious! I made a lettuce wrapped burger with onion, tomato, avocado, ketchup, and Dijon mustard. I would definitely make this again. My boyfriend and our roommate, who are both not keen on healthier food options, loved it!

Not bad, but they fall apart significantly when you fry them.  So, I plopped the rest of the batter in the fridge and took it out a few days later and baked them--for about 15 mins on each side, and it worked much much better. IMO baking is the way to go.  Thanks for the recipe!

These tasted great, but they were a little bit dry. I made them exactly as written, though I baked them instead of frying them. I'll make them again with a sauce to go with.

I'm making this recipe for the second time now.  My family just LOVES it.  So much better than a store bought "veggie burger" - and so good for you too.  Thanks for sharing this with us!

Better than LOTS OF non-meat patties I've had, including store-bought.  The texture is ground-beef-like (the nuts help), you can control the saltiness, I didn't wonder "What the heck is in this mystery fake meat thing?" as I ate, and it's SATISFYING in way others aren't.  
  Used oats instead of Grape-Nuts. Great with A1 sauce.
  Like some other reviewers, next time I'll mash
some up to help it stick together more.  Maybe I'm frying wrong but it was too greasy so I baked them, turned out fine.  And this made 10-12 burgers, good thing I liked it on the first try!

My first time with 'veggie' patties. These turned out better than I had hoped. I used oats instead of cereal and threw in a little whole wheat flour (which I will eliminate the next time) to sub for the cereal and breadcrumbs. I made this as more of a 'fritatta' instead of individual patties - flipped it after 3-4 minutes on medium heat then cut it like a pie and served it with cherry tomatoes in olive oil, sea salt and balsamic vinegar. Very delicious and forgiving dish. :)

Easy to make, these are patties are delicious - I strongly recommend them for vegetarians - they are more flavorful than the frozen veggie patties at the store.

This is a very good fritata. I am always surprised on this site how many people say: Very good but I changed it, I enjoyed it... but changed it. If you like the recipe, say so. If you changed it, then you aren't rating the recipe, you are submitting a new recipe.

I've made this several times since I discovered it.  We have triplet teens and both boys are strict vegetarians -- the rest of us eat only chicken/fish.  We all consider the lentil burgers a genuine treat.  I have used a small electric grinder to pulverize almonds (raw) instead of walnuts.  I've also used cashew (raw or roasted with sea salt).  Both are good.  It's a great recipe to vary and it still comes out well.  They can be "fragile" to handle when flattening into patties in bread crumbs and then put in the skillet.  But they always turn out beautifully.  We eat them like burgers, on thing whole wheat buns.  Thanks, Susanne, and all those who comment.

We liked this veggie burger. My husband is not a real experimental eater, but he liked it too.  Instead of onion soup mix I used dried onion and a little soup base.  I also added shredded carrots. Next time I'll not use the bread crumbs.  I used some dill/cottage cheese bread I made in the bread machine.  Yummy sandwich

This recipe was easy and turned out great.  My 13 month old loved it and ate it the next day for lunch. I made my husband try a bite without a condiment to cover the flavor and he just kept eating.  I used a grill seasoning (italian herb?) instead of the onion soup.  Didn't put walnuts in it.  Baked at 375 for 12 minutes.  I cooked the lentils longer so they would smush together better.  Next time I'm going to try a different seasoning and add a bit of cheese to it.

BEST FRIGGIN VEGGIE BURGER RECIPE EVER!  To be fair I also made a few tweaks.  I never have what i need so  I subbed plain oats for the cereal as suggested, skipped the walnuts, and i think I may have used food processed crackers instead of the bread crumbs.  I also add a ton more spice but what I loved is that they were NOT DRY!  For once i made a veggie burger that actually had a moist inside! THANK YOU THANK YOU!

So Delicious!!!!  I have tried several lentil burger recipes and this one wins hands down.  The whole family loved it(including my 6 year old).  I accidently mixed the breadcrumbs in with the rest of the mixture, instead of rolling the patties in it as the recipe instructs and they still turned out great.  I put them in a pan in the freezer after forming the patties for 20 minutes before cooking them.  I'm freezing my leftover patties in individual zip lock bags in the freezer for dinner later in the week.  This is the best lentil burger/pattie recipe ever!  Thanks!

Never actually had lentil burgers work before! Great recipe as is, or I made a few tweaks: used oats instead of cereal. almond milk, replaced onion soup mix with my own seasoning, pecans instead of walnuts, and put the bread crumb into the mix instead. My 3 yr. old even liked it!

Excellent "burger".  I did not have any cereal so used saltine crackers instead. Added bread crumbs to mixture rather than rolling them in it.  And used egg yolks instead of whole egg and soy milk instead of milk.  Patties held together well even on the grill.  Next time I will make the patties a little less thick, but definitely very moist and delicious. My teenage vegetarian loved them!  And me too!  Way better than store bought.

Surprisingly meaty! I read the comments and made a few adjustments. I used Bulgar wheat instead of cereal, no breadcrumbs or nuts and I baked them. I was skeptical that they would stay together, but they did. 350 in the oven for 12 minutes and we had burgers for dinner. Thanks for the recipe!

These were delicious! I did change it quite a bit. Used wheat hearts cooked cereal instead of grape nuts, 1/4 C. dry onion and 1 boullion cube instead of onion soup packet, doubled the walnuts, and added 1/2 C. chopped mushrooms and half a bell pepper chopped. Will definitely make many more times! Probably a different way every time!

I cooked a chopped onion with the lentils instead of using soup.  These cook up well with the bread crumbs, but they do well without it, too!  The eggs really could be elinminated.  We liked the taste and the ease of making these!

Really yummy.  Mine were too moist though, as I pureed everything.  Next time, I would puree half the lentils and leave the other half whole.  I used oatmeal instead of the cereal, and then ground up rice crispies for the coating as I can't have wheat.  Really yummy with Marinara Sauce and a greek salad.

I must say that I will never buy frozen veggie burgers again.  This were so good.  I halved tghe recipe as my husband is the only veggie in the house but I did taste them.  He ENJOYED them!  I boiled lentils with a veggie cube and I put pepper instead of poultry seasoning.  I also used oatmeal instead of the wheat and barley cereal.  Left out walnuts but added some bread crubs to the mixture as well as rolled them in it.  YUMMMY!  This recipe will stay around in this house!

pretty good little patties!
i followed the recipe, but subbed coriander and black pepper for the poultry seasoning (i don't eat sage), and i used panko bread crumbs with onion powder, garlic salt and dried parsley instead of the already seasoned kind. the flavor of the finished product was very nice, but could be worked on a bit.
besides the above minor modifications, the only thing else i did differently was put the mix in a food pro to make them stick together better, while leaving about 1/2 cup unprocessed for visual purposes.
one suggestion to all: flip them after about 3 minutes to check their progress. some of mine burned before the 5 minute point & left my house VERY smelly!

I am on a low sodium diet and a moderate lowoxalate diet. I am always looking for things using lentils that have some texture and flavor, and this totally fit the bill. However, I did make my own dry onion soup mix, and that is where most of the flavor comes from. The grapenuts are such a good idea! I will replace the walnuts with something more low oxalate next time, but the grapenuts would be difficult to replace... they add such a lovely toothy crunch. Genius idea.

I made a few changes and I split up the batch. From the beginning, I didn't have poultry seasoning so I used grill mates seasoning in roasted garlic and herb and they were very good. When I cooked the second half I added turkey bacon bits to the pattys and they were phenomenal. I also melted muenster cheese on two of the patties in the first batch. I will make these again for sure! Thank for posting your recipe...

This recipe has been part of our monthly recipe circulation for years and the whole family loves it, from picky husband to my 8-year old to my 2-year old. The recipe is perfect as-is. My pet peeve is people rating the recipe as they have changed it. Grrr. However, I have occasionally made changes based on mistakes and poor planning/emergency substitutions. It is also good with ranch dressing mix instead of onion soup mix. It is also fine with the breadcrumbs mixed in rather than as a coating. I made it this way for over a year before I re-read the recipe and discovered it was a coating. They are even better made with the breadcrumbs used as directed! :)

This was extremely frustrating to make. The patties were SO crumbly, and there is absolutely no way you could roll them in the bread crumbs while shaping them into patties as the recipe suggests. I don't know if I messed something up or what. It got somewhat better as I went and squeezed as much moisture as possible out of the patties, but even then most of them broke into several pieces. Also I was thinking these would be a fairly healthy meal, but they were REALLY salty and soaked up a TON of oil.  We ate them with tomato sauce and the flavor was okay, but if I'm going to have that much fat and salt I might as well eat french fries. Probably will not make again.

Yum! Great weekday dinner for kiddies; I made them into smaller patties and baked at 375* for about 8-10 minutes each side on parchment paper. Didn't have cereal so I used 1/2 cup oats, added some shredded cheese, 1/2 tsp cumin, garlic powder, chicken consomme, a little diced red onion and some breadcrumbs to the mixture. Refrigerated before shaping. I love the texture of the lentils... served with a horseradish-dill sauce I happened to have... even my one year old was into it!

Excellent on a whole wheat bun with bread and butter pickles and some lettuce. Definitely refrigerate for at least 1/2 hour after making this or they will be too soft and fall apart.

Made recipe as written. Loved the walnuts and grape nut cereal in it. The onion soup mix and poultry seasoning not so much.  When I eat something that looks like a hamburger, poultry seasoning throws me off - but that's just probably me. Next time will skip the mix and seasoning,  use one egg and grate a small onion. Perhaps some garlic too. They reheat well in microwave in covered container with a touch of water or chicken stock.  Will definitely make again with the seasoning changes.

Great recipe!  I served on whole wheat pocket bread (need a whole wheat to complete the protein) and topped with lettuce, tomatoes, green onions, cucumbers, lemon juice and olive oil.  Cumin and cayenne are also nice additions before cooking the patties.

Delicious! I recommend mashing the lentils before mixing with the other ingredients as these patties have a tendency to fall apart. The flavor is great, though, and my whole family enjoyed them.

Man, these little patties are fantastic! Much better than any processed frozen "thing" you get at the super market.   I omitted the onion soup mix, I always add half a vegetable bullion cube to my lentils. I also added freshly chopped onion and  mushrooms to the mixture.

These are really great (not to mention healthy).  I didn't have grape nuts, but crushed bran flakes worked just fine.  These patties can be spiced however you like them, just throw in whatever sounds good and experiment.

These were a true surprise, they were great!  Usually I find that lentils overpower most recipes, but here they are wonderful.  These are best immediately after cooking, but I also liked crumbling a patty over a salad.  Next time I will leave the mixture uncooked and just cook as many as I need each time; I'll have to see how the mix holds up in the refrigerator.  I recommend this recipe, it's a tasty winner!

We really liked these - very flavorful and filling!  Left out the walnuts with no negative results.  I mixed them up in my food processor.  I served them as the 'meat' in a meal with mashed potatoes, vegetable gravy, green beans, whole wheat rolls and salad.   

Meatless meals are new to my family, and I was so pleased to find something easy and nutritious that everyone enjoyed.  I think this simple and tasty recipe will be used often at my house.  Thanks for sharing!

Really good. Easy to make and very substantial. I put them on buns or toasted whole grain bread with lettuce tomato and ketchup and american cheese. Take care to use the minimum time possible if microwaving to reheat as they will get too dry if you mic them too long. Yum!

These are very good.  I always end up having to use more oil though to fry them in.  I usually serve them as the 'meat' with rice or potatoes.  You'll need to use a gravy if you decide to do this.
