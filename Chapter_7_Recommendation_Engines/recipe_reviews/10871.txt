The recipe mentions topping the cookie with the apple butter after baking.  They sounded wonderful, but I thought they would be more well received (in my family) if I mixed the apple butter in and then baked them.  They were EXCELLENT!  I should have made more - my husband raved and raved about them.  He can't wait until I make them again.  Great with a cup of coffee!  Thanks Kevin!

Really enjoyed these, but must 'fess up, I did make some adjustments: (like some other reviews suggested) I added the apple butter before baking, I used walnuts (ground half of the amount and left the remaining amount finely chopped - I am a texture freak), didn't have wheat germ so I used whole wheat flour and milled flax seed and lastly, I used the entire egg. The result a moist cake like cookie that reminded us of pecan sandies - will definitely make again - thank you Kevin.

They are okay- I mixed the apple butter in to the recipe because I didnt know if I could freeze it 'raw'.  I dusted them with confectioners sugar to make them look better.  Would probably not make again.

I greatly improvised on this recipe.  Didn't have wheat germ so I just used more flour.  Also ran out of vanilla so and used almond extract instead.  When the mixture was ready for baking, it was really crumbly  - too crumbly to form into balls -- so I added back in the leftover egg white.  The cookies turned out good.  They baked for about 20 minutes and were crunchy but not crumbly.  They have a good taste.  They look a lot like pecan sandies when they're done.  My hubby mistook the crushed pecans for oatmeal and declined my offer to try one.  Something that might be worth trying is to roll these in crushed pecans before baking.

It was my first time making this and it's delicious!! 
It is super crumbly so next time I will probably add another yolk. Definitely a keeper though.

Excellent cookie. I, too, applied the apple butter before baking.  I needed them to travel easily, which they wouldn't do otherwise.  Very very good cookie.  Also good with raspberry jam in the centre but that entails a name change;-).  Having said that, I don't think these even need anything in the centre, they are so good.  So, even if you don't have jam or apple butter, go ahead and make them anyway
