We really liked this!  Instead of the canned chicken, I used two grilled chicken breasts that I had leftover from a previous dinner.  I also added 3 green onions and a large clove of garlic.  I agree that the Havarti is key. It brings a different flavor and texture that Mozzarella just cant provide.  I will be making this again!  Thanks for a great recipe!

This was surprisingly good! I made it because we needed an appetizer and I had all the ingredients in my pantry, except the Havarti cheese, I only had mozzarella so I used that. This is rich but the salad dressing gave it a nice flavor. Good for the cooler weather.

I used plain greek yogurt instead of sour cream & replaced the Havarti cheese with pepper jack cheese. This gave the dip just a bit of a zesty kick my family loved!

I use mozzarella cheese instead of Havarti, and also add some pepper paste (about 1 teaspoon) to spice it up a bit.  I've made this dip several times, and it's been a HUGE hit every single time!

This was a big hit at New Year's.  I screwed up by trying to make it lighter-instead of plain yogurt I accidentally bought sweetened plain yogurt.  Still good, but I think unsweetened plain would have been a lot better so I'm giving it a 4.

Everyone loved this and asked for the recipe!  I did substitute 4 chicken tenders (simmered, drained and chopped very finely) for the canned chicken and used Zesty Italian instead of the regular.

AWESOME!  I added more Havarti on top due to cheese lovers! Serve with Ritz crackers. I've made over 5 times for 5 different events.  Everyone loved it!

This was a hit! Definitely will make again but will probably enjoy playing around a bit by adding spinach and mushrooms.

We didn't care for this dip.  I thought the Italian dressing mix gave it an odd flavor that was just too strong.  I didn't think the almonds went well with the dip, either.

I have made this several times, it is excellent!! Don't substitute the Havarti, it can be hard to find but the flavor is excellent. Can't get enough, thank you!

Used Ranch style dressing instead of Italian, mozzarella instead of Havarti and it was very good.  Thanks for the recipe.

YUM! I used Mozzarella instead of Havarti and added around a half a cup of chives from my garden,  don't be lazy, cut and cook your own chicken!
