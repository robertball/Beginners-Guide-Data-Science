Fun simple recipe with reliable results. I made with homemade sugar cookie dough and with half the chocolate topping. I did it more as a chocolate drizzle than a full coating. Very good!

What a big pay-off for such little effort!  This was beautiful, delicious and decadently chocolate (almost too chocolaty for me but not for Hubs or any other serious chocolate lovers).  I made a half recipe, using the "Snack Size" Betty Crocker Cookie Mix, which is roughly half the regular size.  I wanted it a little more glamorous so I used a 9-inch springform pan. So easy.  I used Ghiradelli Semi-Sweet chocolate bars rather than the chocolate chips. LOVE that this recipe calls for real whipped cream rather than "frozen whipped topping."   I cut it in small wedges and garnished it with whipped cream, mint and fresh raspberries.

These are delicious and memorable - perfect for a gathering. They do take a lot longer than the suggested time because the three layers have to cool individually. I let the first two layers chill overnight before adding the topping. Also, as a novice cook, I find it easier to double the topping to make sure it spreads across the whole pan. Will make many more times!

Mmmm:) Amazing! Followed the recipe except for making Cream Cheese Sugar Cookies from this site for the sugar cookie crust (half recipe).

Out of 6 reviews so far I guess I am the only one who did not like this at all. First, I don't think this is 'simple' as others have said. There are several steps where the time is off (for instance mine never 'set' at the specified times making this recipe go on for what seemed like forever!) Additionally, the finished product is bitter and horribly heavy with too much chocolate. The top layer of just chocolate and whipping cream is so bitter and heavy it makes one feel sick. The best part of this is the cookie mix on bottom. As one reviewer stated it would be much better just drizzling the top with chocolate as opposed to making a whole layer. Perhaps by doing that, this would have been spared the garbage.

This is very good and easy to make.  I used 1/2 cup (instead of 1 cup) of butter with the Better Crocker cookie mix and it turned out great.
