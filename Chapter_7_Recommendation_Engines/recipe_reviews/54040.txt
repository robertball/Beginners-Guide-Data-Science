I really love the versitility of this recipe. I didn't have any mirin so instead I used a good red wine and added about 1/2 tsp of sugar to sweeten it. It worked out really well with beef. Like another reviewer I added some hot pepper flakes. My husband thought it "was tasty" which is a pretty high compliment (usually says it's "OK" for everything). Thank you Caroline!

This recipe was quick and tasty. My boyfriend, who has lived all over Asia, loved this dish.  I added a bit more garlic and 2 Thai chilies to give it a bit of zip, but that is just personal taste. The combination of rice vinegar, mirin, and soy sauce was perfect.

I ate this, and it filled my belly, but it was a real disappointment.  When I try a new recipe I sure do expect more from it than it just being edible.   I backed off on the marinade by half and that sure worked  better for me than the full amount would have.  Still, the amount of soy sauce was enough to color the vegetables as well as somewhat obscure the flavor of them, and there was still enough of the vinegar for it to impart a slight, but unpleasant,  tang.  I included the ginger, even tho' I typically don't care for it, but believed I could tolerate it if I reduced the amount indicated in the recipe. That, too, was unpleasant.  The ginger should add just a hint of its flavor, not announce itself boldly.  A little soy sauce, a little mirin, and a little garlic and I would have liked this dish far better.

After reading the reviews, I made a few adjustments. Instead of the mirin, I used 1/4 cup unsalted chicken broth. I used 3 cloves of garlic, minced and instead of green pepper added 4 cups broccoli flowerettes and 1 1/2 cups pea pods. I tripled the mushrooms, and I sliced an onion to add to the stir fry, and put chopped green onion over the dish before serving. I added 1 tsp of corn starch to the reserved juice, which slightly thickened it. Served over jasmine rice, this was delicious (not too salty - the extra vegetables and the chicken broth likely helped).

This review is just of the sauce; I used it with a tofu/veggie stir fry.  And it was delicious!  Very tangy and lots of flavor.  I've been looking for a nice light sauce because I'm tired of those heavy, thick pre-made sauces and this is perfect.  I also added some red pepper flakes to give it a little more kick.

Very versatile and I quite enjoyed the simplicity of this recipe, however, could not find any sweet Japanese wine in any grocery or liquor stores so had to substitute with White cooking wine with 1 tsp of natural sugar.

Fantastic!  I did make a few changes.  Since I didn't have the mirin, I substituted a splash of a slightly dry, tart Reisling wine.  I added an additional garlic clove, 1 teaspoon of sugar, and another tablespoon of ginger.  I also added more vegetables - red cabbage, snow peas, and carrots, and some raw peanuts.  Very fresh and not overly sweet or salty.  I made plenty to have left overs but my kids had third helpings and polished off the entire entree.

This was a different dish that I'm used to preparing for our Asian nights. I ususally use chicken or beef, but that night, I used a pork tenderloin instead.  I thought this had too much vinegar.  Too much of a tang for me, but it was good. My husband loved it though. He would probably give it 5 stars. Next time, I'll cut down on the vinegar and maybe increase the miran and ginger.

This tasted good but just too much soy sauce. And the meat was way overcooked. Vegetables became soggy too drenched in sauce. Won't make it again!

Very flavorful.  The marinade was great.  I did add a lot more garlic, ginger and some hot pepper flakes to the heating oil.  And because the sauce was already very salty, I cut the reserved liquid with some chicken broth (and thickened it with cornstarch) before adding it back into the stir-fry.  I'm looking forward to making this again.

This was delicious! I just used a tiny bit less soy sauce, even though it said it was essential, because I'm not a big fan of the stuff. Otherwise, it was incredible! One of the best recipes on the site.

I used quorn in this recipe as the protein, and it was great. FYI - the seasame oil is essential for flavor. Don't decrease the amount. It only adds 30 calories per serving, or 3.4 grams fat.

I was looking over this recipe today and wanted to add that you don't need a tablespoon of sesame oil, especially if you are stir-frying in a non-stick panwok.  You probably only need around a teaspoon. Making this change this will cut down on the fat significantly.

This is tasty, quick, and low-fat.  I do reserve the marinade, add cornstarch, and add it back in when everything's almost done.  The sauce thickens and it's just delicious.  We love this recipe!

Great sauce. I made this dish with boneless skinless chicken thigh pieces cut up instead of pork , yellow pepper instead of green and added some julienned carrot. I just bought a Veggetti tool today so I twirled a zucchini into a spaghetti, microwaved the results for one minute and served this dish on top. Super delicious and a healthy option to rice.

This is a great do-ahead recipe!   I had the pork marinating while I chopped all the veggies.   It came together very nicely!   I added edamame and zucchini to the vegetables and thickened the sauce with a flour slurry.   Served with a pouch of Schwan's steamed brown rice.

I guess I'm going against the grain here. With the exception of my daughter (who loved it), we all thought it was "ok." I may try it with chicken to see if I like it better but otherwise I don't plan on making it again. Thanks though.

Good flavor, time consuming slicing all of the meal and veggies (as any stir fry dish will be.) I ran out of the rice vinegar and used regular distilled white vinegar and the dish still tasted great.

So very NOT good... at least for us.  I followed the recipe for the sauce exactly, and the final dish was almost too vinegar-y to eat (I used rice vinegar!).  I don't know how to fix this recipe.  We dumped the leftovers.

I was disappointed in this recipe after all the other rave reviews. I found it to be way too salty - too much soy sauce? I followed everything to a "T" except used seasoned rice vinegar. Maybe that's where the extra salt came from. Although even ignoring the saltyness, I didn't see anything spectacular about the sauce. Will make again only to see if I messed something up.

The dish had a nice presentation.  I used snap peas rather than mushrooms.  However, the sauce was a tad too tangy for me.  Next time I will use less of the vinegar.  Thanks Caroline..

I used chicken and it was very good.  Lots of flavour, little fat, and easy to make.
