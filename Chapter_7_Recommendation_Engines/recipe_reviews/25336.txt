We altered this recipe by making a dressing of olive oil, red wine vinegar and sugar and added it to the tomato mixture. It turned out really well!

Pretty good, it has a nice light flavor.  We added more olives and next time I'll probably add some chopped garlic.

If I could give this 10 Stars, I would!!!  This was one of the best pasta dishes I have ever HAD, let alone MADE!  My husband had SECONDS and finished the bowl! I nearly licked my plate clean! We will make this again and again!

This has become a definite favorite at our house. We love it!  I also suggested it to a friend whose family loved it, too.  I made a few changes though.  First, I use angel hair pasta instead, a 28 oz. can of chopped tomatoes instead of fresh, 1/3 cup basil instead of a whole cup and add a small can of chopped black olives.  I make this on a regular basis and never tire of it!

Very good.  I eliminated the onions and used minced garlic instead.  I also left my olives whole.  Overall, I like this, but I think I'd prefer a pesto instead of the olive oil and I'd prefer everything cooked.  Still, very easy, quick, and a great meal to turn to after a long day.  Thanks for the recipe!

This is an absolutely amazing recipe and one that's now a family favourite. The onion can be a bit overpowering for younger eaters, but us adults just love it. Also, I've found that any pasta can be used.

Good.The kick of your basil and onions are going to impact the flavor. I'll add garlic next time.

BLAND! This was even less tasty than the nights that I just throw together a pasta/veggie dish. Of course, it probably would have been better with better (in season or grape) tomatoes, but still. I liked it better the next day for lunch after I microwaved it (so the feta got all melty) and also added balsamic vinegar. Will be deleting this from my recipe box, sorry.

I made this last night for my boyfriend and I and we both loved it! Its gorgeous and refreshing as you have a cold salad 'sauce' on a bed of warm pasta, beautiful! By the way, we couldn't get hold of fettucini so we used fresh egg fusilli which was very tasty!

Great recipe!  Simple, quick and delicious!  I will definitely be making this again and again.  The salsa is great with all types of pasta.
