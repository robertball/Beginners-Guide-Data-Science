I opted to make these without the icing since the others said they were really sweet and I also thought they would be good topped with vanilla ice cream. I have to say for as much butter and sugar as these have I would prefer something else. I just didn't find them all that exciting. I was a little disappointed that the carmel sauce wasn't all that carmelly tasting...it kind of just soaked into the cake part.

I made this for my kids as a special treat. They LOVED it! I thought it was good but a little rich. I would make this again.

I would suggest using a spoon instead of your hands to mix the cake layer it is Really sticky! Not crumbly like the recipe said. I had made the caramel sauce so this came together pretty quickly. My DD and her friend really liked these they thought the crispy edges were yummy. I added a drizzle of cream cheese frosting. Very rich & TOO SWEET!! Please pass the milk!! Sorry Beans this was not for me.
