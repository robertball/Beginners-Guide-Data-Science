I'm a strawberry FINATIC !!! In my house, if we buy a carton of strawberries at noon, they will ALL be gone by the afternoon! I put my own little spin on this recipe, I added a garnish, and didn't use cream cheese. I never would have thought of cream cheese!!#FAVORITE

Loved the strawberry glaze on the strawberries making it shine so beautifully and look so appetizing.

This was a big hit with my family!  I followed the recipe exactly except for cutting it down to 6 servings, and those servings fit into 3 cups as shown in my photo.  Perfect!  This was easy, and it really was best served either right after making it or within several hours (overnight made it soggy).  This would be a great and easy dessert to serve after a heavy meal!  Thanks,  Brittany (and your mom)!
