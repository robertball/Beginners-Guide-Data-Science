Very tasty, light, fluffy cake. I didn't have buttermilk on hand, so I soured milk (~ 1 tsp lemon juice/1 C. milk) & it turned out perfect. Next time, since I love spicy gingerbread, I'll had  more molasses & maybe 3/4 tsp ginger. But, that's personal taste. This is a great recipe my family loved. I'm enjoying it w/ coffee this AM too. Thanks JO!

Really yummy...made it to share and everyone enjoyed it.  I've made it once exactly as is (using frozen blueberries), and once with these substitutions: whole wheat flour instead of all-purpose, lemon juice and milk instead of buttermilk.  Enjoyed both ways.

I had last year's blueberries in the freezer and I needed to use them up and this was an excellent method for doing that -- the gingerbread drew rave reviews at the office, and when I took it to a friend's house for dinner, and my kids loved it too.  It's a good idea to cover lightly to keep the top crunchy.  Wonderful served with whipped cream.

Wow! Loved this recipe. Followed the recipe exactly. Got rave reviews from family. Not to sweet or bitter - just absolutely perfect! I cooked mine in the tiny little aluminum bread pans, wrapped in christmas plastic bags with pretty ribbon and a little tag as gifts. Perfect!

I used another reviewer's suggestion of 1/2 brown, 1/2 white sugar. I also used soy milk and added 1/2 cup of walnuts. This was so delicious! I brought it in to work and my coworkers begged me for more! It's yummy warmed up with a big scoop of ice cream on top too.

This recipe is a surprisingly good combination (and i've been told close to an old fashioned gingerbread).  I have made it a few times now and it holds great for lunch box snacks.  The only change is we like a darker gingerbread, so we halve the sugar with brown and make sure the molasses is dark.  If I am trying to sneak in some extra fiber, i halve the all purpose with whole wheat.  These changes are just personal taste, great as exactly followed too.  Definate keeper.

Yummy!  This turned our very good!  I used frozen blueberries, I used butter instead of Oil.  I think it's best eaten within a couple of days.  When stored it stays very moist but if you want the thing sugarry top to say dry and crispy the bread will dry out after a couple of days.  but whatever, its still good with a moist top!

It's passable; the bread was on the dry side and too sweet for me; I added toasted nuts and replaced the white sugar with 3/4 cup of light brown sugar.  And the sugar on top was not necessary! The blueberries were not noticeable and I would not make this recipe again.

You gotta put ice cream on top.  I didn't add molasses to the recipe and it turned out fine.  Very yum.  Today I am substituting the molasses for maple syrup and making these into muffins.

8.1.11 ... https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/60012/blueberry-gingerbread/ ... Not bad, just not that good either.  I had to sub honey for molasses.  'Don't love nutmeg, so I always halve it.  I added a 1/4t cinnamon; which wasn't bad, but made it less gingerbready - more spicy.  It has a funny look to it - shiny.  It's almost similar to a cakelike cookie - like some Archway cookies are - but still moist.

I made this for a friend who loves gingerbread and he gave this an "A." I used frozen blueberries and served it warm with whipped cream. This is a delish and easy dessert and it's not cloyingly sweet -- I'll make this again. Would be great with a cup of hot tea on a rainy afternoon, too!

We loved this, not too spicy, moist and tasty.  I used Jersey Blueberries in season.  They were so big that I used more then the recipe called for.  I also left off the additional sugar.  It really wasn't needed.  Thanks for sharing this with us.  It was great!!!!!!!!

Great recipe. I'm off dairy so I used almond milk with a dash of white vinegar in place of the buttermilk, and it turned out perfect.

Excellent - moist and great spicy flavor.  I used fresh cranberries and it was delicious - and a little more seasonal.  I also swapped out half of the all-purpose flour for whole wheat to try to boost the fiber and nutrients, and also followed the recommendation to use 1/2 brown sugar instead of all white for richer flavor.  It is pretty sweet, so I could even see reducing the sugar to 3/4 cup.   And now that I trust the original recipe I'm also going to try lowering the fat by swapping out some of the oil--though sometimes it's worth just going for the indulgence!

This was really good, despite my trepidation about combining blueberries and gingerbread. It was really tasty. It didn't look that great because it was SUPER moist (maybe add more flour) and sort of fell apart, but people raved about it. Next time I was thinking I might use cherries instead of blueberries-- for some reason that makes more sense to me. Try the Boscobel Ginger Cake-- that's an amazing ginger dessert recipe.

I liked the results of this recipe.  I followed the amounts and instructions, but I had to substitute the 11 x 7 pan for a 9 x 9.  The cake rose and the height of the cake was fine in the larger pan.  My family noted that the flavour was much like a spice cake.  I put the remainder of the cake in a plastic container with a lid.  The next day, the cake was noticably moister than the day I made it.  The cake is still good, but I liked it better the first day.   I think the plastic container sealed it up too well.  A good recipe and I will make it again.

This bread is very good. I replaced the oil with applesauce. I also added some leftover streusel topping I had from making muffins earlier that day.

Wonderful recipe, especially for those who love blueberry!  We made this tonight and it was wonderful eating warm from the over with whipped cream.  This was easy to put together and the consistency of the cake is great.  This is a keeper for our family.

Fabulous cake, well received both fresh and the next day.  My only problem was in baking it, after 30 minutes I still had uncooked loose batter in the centre of the pan.  I ended up cooking it on two different occasions for 15 extra minutes.

I made this to share with a neighbor.  Everyone loved it.  It is so much more moist than regular gingerbread.  I used fresh blueberries, the high bush large kind.  When I can find some of the smaller, sweeter low bush kind like they have in Maine I will try it again.

Hmmm...well I LOVE gingerbread and I LOVE blueberries, but I didn't love them together in this recipe.  But, I wouldn't discourage anyone from trying it.  I am giving this 5 stars b/c the gingerbread is awesome! I used a heaping 1/2 t of ginger and a bit more molasses.  I will definitely be making this again, just without the blueberries.

This was delicious. But, I did alter it. I had no buttermilk, so replaced it with plain lowfat yogurt. I also replaced 1c flour with 1/2c whole wheat flour and 1/2c shredded wheat crumbs (thanks to previous reviewer for suggesting the whole wheat flour). And, I used more than 1 cup blueberries. With all that, it still turned out great.

This recipe is fantastic! Light , moist and flavorful. I do however cut the sugar in half and it's still plenty sweet.

This is the perfect gingerbread recipe. I have made it twice, once exactly as written and once without the blueberries, double spices, and 5 tbs molasses. It is great as written, my hubby just isn't a blueberry fan so that's why I tried it that way. I will use this recipe as my go-to for gingerbread!

This is easy and delicious, perfect for a back-to-school snack cake. Juicy late summer blueberries in cozy autumn spiciness. Yum!

Blueberry gingerbread is wonderful. You wouldn't think blueberries and gingerbread would be a good combo, but they work remarkably well! So, so, so good! A square of this makes a great breakfast.

It went together easily and was tasty, but the gingerbread flavor wasn't as strong as I would like. I would add more ginger next time, but otherwise keep everything else the same.

I really liked this, and was asked for the recipe at the dinner party we were attending. I was dubious about the blueberry gingerbread combo, but it was delicious. Changes I made: scant 1/2 cup white sugar, scant 1/2 cup brown sugar, and only 1T of white sugar sprinkled on top. It was still PLENTY sweet. Also I dislike nutmeg so I eliminated that and instead increased the ginger slightly, to a rounded teaspoon.

Nice and moist. I will probably use more ginger and less sugar next time as it is a little weak on ginger taste.

I made this just like the recipe except I used sour milk (1tsp. lemon juice with 1 c. milk.  I also think the sugar on top is not needed.  It was very moist and even my husband who isn't fond of gingerbread loved it.

It was super moist and tasty. I used frozen blueberries and found I needed more baking time because it was under cooked with the time suggested. I should have added more flour to compensate for the extra moisture coming from the berries. Overall it eventually baked and turned out great. I served mine with warm brown sugar sauce. Yummy!

This was delicious. I used gluten free flour and 3/4 c brown sugar but kept everything else the same. It was light, moist and not overly sweet. Perfect for an after dinner treat with whipped cream and then on it's own with coffee the next morning. I will make this again and try apple's next time!

Made mine completely fat free and with less sugar.  I substituted unsweetened applesauce for the oil,  fat free Keiffer for the buttermilk, egg whites for the whole eggs, brown sugar (half the amount) instead of white sugar.  Also used whole wheat pastry flour.  Came out very moist and delicious.  My husband really enjoyed them.  Will make again tonite...

I've made a few gingery things in my life -- Alton Brown's cookies and some pear-ginger cake from this website -- but this one takes the cake. It's amazingly fluffy, as well as tangy, balanced, and aromatic. I used a round bundt pan and I thought it would bee too little, but it rose fantastically and filled it out nicely.

Amazing. Whoever commented that it was dry, is so off. This was amazingly moist and held together beautifully. Even more moist at a day old. I put 3/4 tsp ginger instead of 1/2, and didn't have the buttermilk so added a tsp of lemon juice to milk like another person advised. I will be making this again and again.

Very delicious recipe, but a little time-consuming to make compared to other simple cakes. Made as directed in the recipe but changed the blueberries to red raspberries since they are my daughter's favorite berry and this was for a Christmas Eve dinner.

Good, moist bread.  I used chopped fresh apples instead of blueberries.  It was good.  After I curdled my milk w/vinegar, I added it to all the wet ingredients, made a well in the dry ingredients and mixed it all together (this saved a bit of time).  The apples paired well with the gingerbread.  I'd like to try it with two-thirds of the sugar and see how it turns out.

I used almond milk, used 1tsp ginger paste, and added 1/8tsp ground cloves. I skipped the extra sugar on top and the gingerbread turned out wonderful, not too moist, and not too sweet. The blueberries add a tartness that some may not like. Next time I'll add more ginger and molasses to make it spicier!

This was an EXCELLENT gingerbread recipe much like my grandmothers.  I did not care too much for the blueberries but that may just be personal preference.  I will certainly make this again - without blueberries it will be easy, quick, very tasty and very inexpensive - what more could one want? 

I used 1/2 white and 1/2 whole wheat flour and 1/2 white and 1/2 brown sugar as suggested by other reviewers and increased ginger to 1 t. so I can't give it 5 stars. Worth trying.

I got so many compliments on this! It turned out really moist and flavor-filled. Some at work ate it with cream cheese, which was also delicious.

i didn't have to make any changes to the recipe, since it was great already. if you don't have buttermilk you can search up 'buttermilk alternitive'

GREAT bread!! Has been a huge hit everywhere I have taken it. Take blueberry cream cheese & blueberry preserves to spread on. Thanks for the recipe.   (I did change it up a bit using almond milk rather than the buttermilk, applesauce instead of oil, 1/2 white sugar 1/2 brown as suggested in another review & unbleached all purpose flour.)

Kind of blah - there is really no flavor to this at all.

I wasn't too sure about the idea of blueberries with gingerbread.  I decided to try this recipe based on the first two reviews.  

This is the BEST bread I have ever made. I plan to make this for Christmas gifts this year.  This is a keeper!
