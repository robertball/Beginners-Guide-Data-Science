I subtracted one teaspoon of water and added a teaspoon of pure vanilla extract. I made no other changes or substitutions. This turned out absolutely perfect. I've been wanting to try low sugar jam for a while now (because my family eats an obscene amount of jam) and you know, it was just as good. My oldest child said that he preferred it "less sweet".

so easy and great strawberry taste. I have never made jam before as I thought you needed way more berries. Not so! I will definately make this again An added note I did add the lemon juice, 2not 3 teasp per 2 half pint batch.

I followed it exactly, and only after my jam was runny and didn't set did I realize the recipe does not include an important step.T You add "and heat to a boil." to step #2.

I used this recipe for making 12 8oz jars of Strawberry jam and it turned out perfect! It was my first time making jam ever and I also never did canning before. I used honey and apple juice as well. I multiplied this recipe x8 and it called for 3 cups of sugar or sugar substitute. With a regular jam recipe it calls for 7 or 8 cups of sugar. So not sure if I could call this recipe low sugar but at least you can use honey instead of granulated sugar so it's still so much better. Will make this again!

I tried this recipe for the first time today and it turned out perfectly!  The level of sweetness was just right, and since low-sugar pectin is used the huge amount of sugar one normally uses in making jam isn't needed for preservation.  (I used water instead of fruit juice and the 1/2 cup sugar).  

As one other reviewer mentioned, the consistency inside the processed jars seemed to be more like thin syrup at first, but about three to four hours after pulling them out of the water bath they had thickened up to a perfect consistency.  I highly recommend this recipe!

Perfect amount of sweetness. Have also used this for peaches, cherries, and blueberries, and I always add cinnamon and/or nutmeg, ginger. Can add in some finally chopped mint too.

A couple of tips.  This recipe is for a very small amount.  I tripled the ingredients and ended up with 5 - 8 oz jars of jam. I boiled the recipe for 10 minutes, and I skimmed off all the foam after removing from stove, otherwise the fruit will fall to the bottom.  And last , I returned the full jars with lids back into a bath of water, covering the jars for 10 minutes.  This will seal the jam and you will hear the lids pop as they concave.  Otherwise you will need to use paraffin wax.  This way your jam stores for a year without spoiling.  I hope this helps some of you, because I have made many mistakes in the past, like having to recook the jam, the fruit falling to the bottom of the jar and so, it's with tips like this you will save extra work .  Once I had had some friends try it, I will let you know how they liked it.  Oh and I used Cranberry  concentrate for the liquid.

I am making this recipe for the second time, as my family and I, as well as my co-workers, absolutely love it as is.  This will be added to my recipe collection as a keeper.  It is so simple and easy to make.  You could never tell that it is a low sugar recipe.  I'll continue to make this recipe for years to come!

I listened to the only 2 star review and made sure to add 'and bring to a boil' to step 2. This was wonderful! I also listened to 'alexabean' and tried my favorite fruits. I did cherry and then blueberry. 30 cherries made 2 perfect half pint servings. I think 2 cups blueberries (pre smash) would do the same. I did about 2 1/3 to start and had a little extra. I used honey and apple cider. It wanted to separate into the jam and the pulp. I fixed this by turning them over and shaking them about every hour. Delicious!

My family loved this jam! I added 1/3 cup of minced fresh basil from my garden for something a little less sweet and it came out perfect!!

I followed the recipe and used the water and sweetener recommendations. It tasted great and I will probably try it on other berries as they come into season.

The taste is fantastic, I used sugar and apple juice.  I am going to decrease the apple juice as it was more like an ice cream topping than a jam.  It makes the toast soggy when I use it, and I use butter.  I doubled the recipe and got 5 8 oz  jars of strawberry.  I am going to tweek this as I really like the flavor.

Meh.  Just okay.  I used Stevia as a sweetener and it turned out okay.  It's a good starting point.  I think the flavour of my jam is not "right" because of the stevia.  Next time I'll try half stevia half sugar, or honey.
