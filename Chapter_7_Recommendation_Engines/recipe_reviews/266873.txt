This recipe is similar to the parrot head salad, also delicious and on this site, using a few more fruits and vegetables and omitting bacon. For the parrothead salad, I like to make a poppyseed dressing, replacing some of the vinegar with citrus juice. That would be wonderful here as well. You may question the mix of sweet and tangy at first, but it actually works!

The salad was very good and I enjoyed all of the fruit in it.   I left out the eggs because I don't like boiled eggs & used mandarin oranges instead of clementines.   I did have the salad for lunch because in all honestly eating it for breakfast seemed odd to me.  It was a tasty lunch though!
