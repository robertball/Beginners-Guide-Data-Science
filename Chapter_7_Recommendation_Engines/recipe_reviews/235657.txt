This is a great simple recipe that I used to get rid of the extra veggies from a pot luck.  I brought veggies + dip and there always seems to be leftover broccoli and cauliflower.  I used this easy simple flavorful recipe to roast the veggies and they were great.  My 9 and 5 year old boys loved it.  Thanks for sharing!

I love Romanesco! It is fabulous!! I make this all the time!! The only thing I do different is use Lawry's garlic salt and instead of paprika I use Italian herbs then sprinkle with Italian grated cheeses!! MMMMM Good!!

So much better than broccoli. I will buy romanesco more often now! Love, love, love this recipe! Now adding broccoli and cauliflower with the romanesco. Awesome blend!

We roast most of our vegetables this way so it's not a new way of doing veggies but the Romanesco was new to our family.  What a great vegetable and a great way to enjoy it.

My husband and I both loved this! It was super-easy, took just minutes to prep and then roasted happily in the oven while I made a protein. We'll definitely have this again.

Simple and easy.  I recommend following the instructions to spread it onto a baking sheet (as opposed to a casserole dish).   The reward is a nice varied texture.

I have made this several times and it is always a hit. Sometimes I also add some cheese at the end that just gives it  an extra touch.

This is a great and simple recipe.  I made it but cooked it in a large cast iron skillet that is seasoned well. I have tried this when roasting cauliflower and it works out great.

I used some crushed fresh garlic in the oil and gave it a few drops of balsamic at the end. It is a delicate veg so it doesnt need much.

A few weeks back the couple in front of me was buying some of this psychedelic looking stuff I had never seen before and they explained it was romanesco. I vowed to buy some as soon as I went back but it was gone! Well finally tonight I got to try it out and it was AMAZING. 

This recipe is so simple anyone can do it (believe me if I did it, it is easy) and it is delicious! if only I could find it more often!
