1.1.17  Iâ€™m sure this would be delicious served over curry, but I served it over grilled haddock which was sensational.  The combination of cilantro and fresh mint bring a very pleasant, surprising flavor.

Made the recipe as listed except I had to use less cilantro since i was running low and not going shopping!  It is quite delicious, i served it with plain yogurt and tofu tikka masala. The second time i added the olive oil someone else mentioned in comments, which was also delicious.

I made this for a work lunch for 40 people. Our department made Indian dishes for the group. This salads freshness perfectly complimented the meal and everybody raved about it. This is a definite keeper!!

I used red onion and added some celery heart, and lemon pepper. I used 1/4 cup fresh chocolate mint and no cilantro. We had this with some grilled chicken marinated in yogurt and lemon. This was a good complement to the chicken.

This was good the day I made it, but awesome the next day. Very refreshing! I didn't have any cilantro, but didn't really miss it.
