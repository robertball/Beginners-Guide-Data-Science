Simple, simple simple.  just a few ingredients and you can't screw it up.  The only thing is to watch the milk.  like other reviewers, decrease about a 1/4 cup.  I also useregular flour and add 4 level teaspoons of baking powder to make up for the self rising flour.   For the butter milk i used 2 teaspoons of vinegar with 2 cups regular milk. (Thanks for a great week night biscuit recipe.

These are really good and the only biscuits I've ever been able to make that were actually good.  Watch the buttermilk bit though.  If u use too much they don't bake and are doughy in the center.  very good.

I can't wait to make these tomorrow night. Such an easy, straightforward biscuit recipe! Thanks for sharing!

*I believe all of the reviewers would've made these perfect the first time had they heeded the advice in her intro/comment. The author cautions that these biscuits are heavy and clearly indicates that she usually has leftover buttermilk, thereby warning people not to use too much of it.

I have tried to make biscuits for many years, and had given up long ago. My adult son jokingly asked me to learn to make cat head biscuits as a new years resolution.  Challenge accepted! I have made them exactly by the recipe several times now, and they have been perfect every time. The next time I make them, I want to measure the buttermilk and shortening so I get it right every time.

I'll definitely be making these again whenever I want to have sausage gravy over biscuits. They were perfect for that! I got rave reviews from my guests. I did not have self-rising flour, so I used regular flour + 4 level teaspoons baking powder. A lot of other reviews called for reducing the buttermilk, so I also did that... but ended up having to add in the full amount specified after all. I would recommend starting with the reduced amount (1.5 cups) and adding more as needed.

Followed the recipe exactly. These biscuits take me back to my childhood. My grandmother made these every day. Hers were a little different, but these are close. I’ve only made them once, but will make them for every family gathering from now on.

These biscuits are made just like my mom used to make hers. I haven't actually made your recipe yet, but am very excited to try. I never wrote down her recipe but I watched her make them a thousand times. I always wished I had written it, down so thanks for providing this recipe! I hope these taste as good as my mom's. Fingers crossed!

Super easy and delicious. My husband was raised in the south and he loved them! I took the tips of adding vinegar to the milk to substitute for buttermilk and adding baking powder to the flour to substitute self rising flour and it turned out great. I will try it with the recommended ingredients next time, I just didn’t have them on hand so thank you to everyone who adds tips for substitutions. I would hate to miss out on a great recipe because I’m missing some ingredients!

These are tremendous!  No White Lilly Flour here  in the Colorado Rockies, but the recipe still works turning Hungarian High Altitude Flour into self-rising.  Big, soft pillows to another in sausage gravy!

I made these to serve with biscuits and gravy, they turned out perfect. I didn't have any buttermilk so I added 1 tablespoon + 1/2 teaspoon of white vinegar to the 1 3/4 milk and let it sit for 5 minutes. I didn't use it all and followed the recipe as written. perfect and easy. thank you for sharing it. I will definitely be making it again.

I followed the instructions with a few changes. I substituted 1cup whole wheat flour and added 1 1\2 tsp of baking powder and 1\4 tsp of salt.. The cook time was about 7 minutes longer but they turned out great.

These biscuits are a bit toasty in the outside and moist and tender on the inside. I didn't have buttermilk on hand so I made sour milk adding lemon juice to milk. They turned out just great. I did reduce the milk as others suggested. We'll be having these again!
