I think this was one of the best coleslaw recipes I have ever had. I used a bag of coleslaw mix, 1 tbsp each of sugar, vinegar, lemon juice and green onions for white, let it sit overnight and topped pulled pork sandwiches with it, we really enjoyed this recipe, thanks Francine!

Excellent coleslaw.  I used a 16 oz. bag of shredded cabbage and carrots which made it easier than bringing out the Cuisinart.

This was awesome!  I followed the directions exactly, except I left out the sour cream because I didn't have any.  It was great!  Next time I will include the sour cream and try that out!  Hubby loved it, too, said "don't lose that recipe"!
