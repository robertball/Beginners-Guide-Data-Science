very good. I did not use flour and brown the pork. I just tossed in crockpot for 9 hours and added 2 cans of chili beans. I made lime and cilantro rice and poured chili over it.

This recipe was AMAZING!!! One of the best Mexican dishes i've ever made. I omitted the jalapenos cause hubby and kids in my house don't like spicy, and made sure the other ingredients were mild, also bought some sour cream, an avocado, cilantro for topping and made some brown rice with corn tacos (hard and soft types). To die for!!

I've made this several times, served over Basmati rice, and each time it's delicious.  I do not use the jalapenos -Rotel tomatoes and green chiles adds plenty of spice- and I use fresh roasted Hatch chiles.

Sub. 1 jar 505 Green Chile sauce ( hot) for 1 jar salsa verde, and used Rotel w/ cilantro and lime. Reduced jalapeño to 1/3 can. Added cumin, chili powder, garlic & onion powders to flour before dredging. Cooked on High for 3 hours and it was tender. Served over brown rice, topped w/avocado, cheese & sour cream. Yummy! Will make again. Enjoy!

Flavorful, moderately spicy, and easier than other green chile recipes I've tried. Will make again. I added a little extra cumin and some chili powder at the end, but otherwise followed the recipe. Good over rice, burritos, or even baked potatoes.

Super easy.  I used 3 pounds of pork loin and still very hearty.  I am not much on meat.  Loved the simplicity and really tasty.

Delicious! I had a 6lb piece of meat so I cooked all the meat all at once with some of the salsa, pulled out half the meat after it was cooked (made green enchiladas with it) and then added everything else and cooked a little longer.
