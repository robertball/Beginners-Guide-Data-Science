I substituted one regular jar of sweet potato baby food for the tofu, and these turned out GREAT!! The sweet potato added extra nutrition and just a little hint of sweetness.

I took the advice from one of the other reviews and used sweet potatoe purree instead of tofu. I also used 3/4 cup whole wheat flour and 1/2 cup all purpose flour, 1/2 tablespoon applesauce and 1/2 tablespoon oil. I added 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon, a 1/4 cup brown sugar. I think the salt was too much. So next time i will cut it down to a 1/4 teaspoon. I also used vanilla almond milk. Very yummy and healthy

Maybe it was my lack of knowledge with tofu, but when I made these, they turned out soggy and soupy. Not good!

We loved them! Next time will use 1/2 whole wheat flour. Delicious!
