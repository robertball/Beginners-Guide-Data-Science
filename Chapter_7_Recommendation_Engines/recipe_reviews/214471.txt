I forgot to add a step!  After it is taken off the stove, it needs to cool in the fridge/freezer until it is just hard enough to scoop out with a small cookie scoop. It should still be "sticky" enough for your choice of coating to adhere to the truffle. *UPDATE* Someone reviewed it who said they couldn't get the right consistency while in the fridge. I will add that you HAVE to stir it a couple times while it's in there.  So sorry I didn't put that at first, and I hope no one else will have problems with it.

Wonderful recipe!  I didn't add the optional espresso powder as I felt it would be too strong for my taste. also the type of baking chocolate was not specified...there is more than one kind, I went with the normal unsweetened and it turned out amazing! also...after cooling for a while in fridge I scooped out approximately the amount for each ball and let them cool in fridge on baking sheet...then took it out a bit later to shape them more.  This seemed to work better since otherwise you would need to let them cool for several hours.

Simply YUMMY!  I don't bother rolling it into a ball, just pour it into an aluminum pan 1" deep and cut into bite size squares.

Amazing! These truffles are super rich and oh so delicious. I did add the espresso powder, it gave these a wonderful flavor and really complemented the chocolate. I rolled these in crushed pecans, didn't want to roll them in anything sweet because they are so rich! Thanks Mykaela for this amazing recipe!

5 Star taste but 2 Star for prep.  These taste AMAZING. I used Ghirardelli chocolate and dark roast coffee.  Mine never got to a workable consistency. When I chilled the mix the outer layer hardened completely while the middle stayed a soupy mess.  I finally had to put both hands in to make small balls of goop.  I dropped each into a muffin paper (next time find candy size).  For toppings I used sprinkles, coconut, honey roasted peanuts, peanut butter, orange liqueur, slivered toasted almonds, craisins, raisins & powdered sugar.  If you can figure out how to make this recipe manageable for you,  it will easily become your go-to favorite.  Big Valentines Day hit - but wow, give yourself time to figure out the best technique.  Here's hoping everyone else has more success because these really do taste better than anything I've ever bought at a candy counter.

Flavor is excellent.  Fairly time consuming.  I dipped them in melted dark chocolate after chilling.  Yum.

Yum!  I made these without the espresso powder, and they were delicious.  I did modify the preparation, but not the ingredients.  I put all of the ingredients in a large pyrex measuring cup and heated in the microwave for 2 or 3 minutes, stirring every 30 sec., until the chocolate was melted and the mixture was smooth.  I skipped the 1st refrigeration step and just poured the molten chocolate into candy papers (mini baking cups), then put those in the frig for a couple of hours.   Next time I will sprinkle on some nuts or sprinkles before I refrigerate them, and I will also try with a single pecan on top and maybe some mint extract in the recipe.

My sisters and I made this for my mom on Mother's Day- it was her favorite part of the meal. We let it refrigerate over night before we scooped it into balls that morning; it worked better than waiting just an hour (we were opening the refrigerator more than necessary). We used a melon baller for the general shape and then used our fingers to make them more uniform. Then we wiped our fingers with a paper towel before rolling them in pecans and coconut, so they would look lovely for Mom. We continued to store them in the refrigerator because Georgia is warm and humid in May.

These turned out fantastically! They were simple, and tasted just as good as any of the ridiculously expensive truffles you buy in the store. I left out the espresso powder and it was really really good, so if you don't like coffee flavor, don't hesitate to make them without the optional espresso! Another thing my friend and I did was with the melted chocolate mixture in the sauce pan, after we poured almost all of it into the bowl to cool, was dip strawberries in the still hot melted mixture. It was amazing!

I followed another review and stirred the chocolate batter a couple of times while it was setting in the refrigerator, but it still took several hours to set.  I coated the truffles in crushed peanuts, dried cranberries, sliced almonds, and crushed m&m's.  These were a hit!  One other thing is that I wouldn't really call these dark chocolate truffles since all of the ingredients are semi-sweet chocolate, not dark chocolate.

The only problem I encountered with this recipe was my own lack of a proper scooper. Using two regular dinner spoons, btw, is very, very difficult if you are looking for a proper, round truffle. I tried it again, switching the espresso powder for 1 tbsp ground coffe and 1 tbsp powdered sugar, and It gave a small distinction in flavor that I personally loved. I also drizzled it with some melted bitter-sweet chocolate, and it was simply excellent. Great recipe, whole family loves it.

I made a batch with and without the coffee. Without a doubt, the one with coffee was much better although it does not taste like coffee.  I left it to cool overnight and it took me an hour with a small melon baller to put them into mini cupcake holders.  Next time I will not let it set that long as it was work to get them all done. It was worth it to get all of the compliments.. Thank you for the recipe!

These came out really good. What I didn't get from the recipe and viewers should know is that when on the gas, it is liquidy. It only thickens once in the fridge. I didn't realize this and get trying to heat and mix it (almost burnt the chocolate). I followed the reviews and kept mixing it the whole time it was in the fridge and it worked perfectly.

Omg, this recipe is only surpassed in its incredible taste by the ease of making it.  If I could rate it higher than five stars I would.  I will be making this often for family and friends.  That is if there's any left by the time I can get it to them.  Lol

First time I have made candy of any kind.  I made a batch of the mocha flavor and a batch of peppermint flavored and put them in Christmas tins and gave them to all the folks in my Sunday school class.  I've been warned that if I don't make them again next year, I'll be kicked out of the class.  Thank you, Mykaela, GREAT recipe.

Wonderful!! So easy and creamy! I used a melon baller to scoop the truffles onto the sheet to chill - seemed like the easiest way to do it.
