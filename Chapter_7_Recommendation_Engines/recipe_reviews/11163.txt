Good grief! Get this recipe off the website, it's all wrong, terrible. My batter was SOUP and I realized after  the fact, when looking at other Florentine cookie recipes, that the heavy cream is never more than a few tablespoons, not almost a cup!!!!!!  NO NO NO. I had to throw it all out, wasted perfectly good ingredients, and start all over again...made Florentine cookies from the Foodnetwork, perfect.

was really good but had to make a few changes such as: not cook as long and thicken the batter a little

Is white sugar powdered sugar or granulated sugar?  This recipe looks great!
