INCREDIBLE! Made this for dinner tonight and wish I had made more! This in an incredible recipe, followed it letter by letter and the shrimp turned out perfectly. My wife absolutely raved about it. Was a bit unsure about serving it with ranch dressing but... it was the perfect dipping sauce for the shrimp. 

This one goes to the top of the favorites list and will be made many times both as a 'football snack' and as a main dish. Tonight we enjoyed it with shrimp cocktail before dinner and a nice Broccoli  Au Gratin served in individual gratin bowls.

Thanks for posting this awesome dish!

I love this recipe. I used half corn starch and half flour in this recipe, but it made great shrimp breading. My favorite food to get from Hooters is their buffalo shrimp and this gives it a run for their money. I would recommend not cooking more than 2 minutes each side so your shrimp stays very fresh.

I make fried shrimp about once a month for our family.  They all said this was the best.  I used fresh shrimp.  It was good with or without the hot sauce.  Will be using this recipe from now on.
