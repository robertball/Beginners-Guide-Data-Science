Excellent! This is a high-end gourmet quality feast. But, the directions need tweaking. I made this last nite for 2  girlfriends. I made the sause:  used 6 tble. lite mayo, 2 teas. of wasabi, 1 tble. soya, I didn't use any other spice, mixed all well, reserve in small bowl. I marinated the filets in 1 tble. soya and 1 tble. rice vinegar, both sides, brushed mayo mixture on top, flipped over and brushed mayo on other side, covered and refrigerated for 30 min. No longer. Toasted seasame seeds, 8 tble. set aside on a small plate. To cook fish, I heated no-stick pan sprayed with baking spray on medium meat.  Place fish filet, one at a time on seasames to coat, brushed with the mayo on other side and coated that side. Then into the pan. We like tuna med. rare so I cooked for 2 min. per side, for fish that was 1 1/2 inches thick. When fish is done put on serving plate. In same pan, I added leftover mayo mixture, there is lots, as I just brushed on to marinate (both sides) before marinating.  I quickly heated reserved up and spread 1 tble. of this to top side of cooked tuna, and served immediately. The sesame seeds browned beautifly and stayed on fish. I would also like to try this using a good quality balsamic vinegar instead of the rice vinegar.

My favorite selection at the Cheesecake factory is their Wasabi Crusted Ahi Tuna. I bought a bag of individual servings of frozen Mahi Mahi at Costco hoping to find a recipe like this in allrecipes. It's not exactly like Cheesecakes, but close enough. Yum yum yum! My husband and daughter kept telling me how good it tasted. I didn't add the five spice, and since I love wasabi added extra. That's something that can easily be played around with. I also doubled the first ingredients so I would have enough to re-apply before I was ready to cook. After re-applying one side I then coated with panko crumbs and did the same on the other side. Oh so good! Thanks for sharing Jennifer!

Was delicious. I doubled the sauce and after marinating the tuna, I cooked up the sauce and served it over top of the fish. My husband and his friend were licking the plate.

I did what others suggested and doubled the sauce (step 1). I also only made about half as much tuna, so the sauce was plentiful and really gave the tuna good flavor. I will say that the flavor was most overwhelmingly form the Chinese 5 Spice Powder, I didn't taste the wasabi at all really. But the taste ended up being very authentic, similar to dishes I've had in China. And it is super easy! I would make it again exactly like I did before.

This was just okay for us.  Like someone else said, the sauce didn't really stay on the fish.  Plus, the five-spice had a strong licorice flavor that I wasn't crazy about.  Next time I'll try less spice and make extra sauce to spoon over the fish after it's done so its not so dry.

DELICIOUS! Excellent! I substitute the tuna for Mahi Mahi and I only had 2 filletes but used the same amount of ingredients for the sauce and it was PERFECT. Wasabi taste was definitely on my fish after cooking it on the skillet. I also just cooked it sushi grade for just 1 min and a half each side.  I served it with a macaroni pasta with peas, shredded carrots and scallions just tossed on little olive oil, it made the flavored balanced well and avoid concentrate on the saltiness of the fish (soy sauce). Hubby loved it. Big 5 STARS!

Instead of Yellowfin Tuna, I substituted it for Tilapia and flash fried each filet.  It was realy good. I served the fish topped with fresh scallions chopped and squeezed lemon juice on top. Yum! Will make again.

This was tasty, but all the marinade burnt off in the pan.  I might have had the heat too high, and i'm still adjusting to new non-non-stick pans.  Worth another try.

Great recipe and oh so simple. I didn't have the 5-spice on hand the first time I made this, but I made it with the remaining ingredients and it was fantastic!  I've made this several time and never used the spice.  I double the wasabi sauce each time to have extra for adding after cooking.  Didn't know preparing great tuna steaks could be so easy!!!  Family favorite.

Very disappointing.  The sauce was not great.  I tried to save it by adding soy ginger sauce, but the mayonaise overpowered the taste of the tuna.  Would not do this again.

This is a wonderful recipe that I follow almost exactly.  The only thing I do differently is save the excess mayo mix and dip the fish into again right before searing.

I combined this marinade with a recipe for wasabi encrusted tuna and it was excellent!

A 4 3/4 star recipe! Admittedly I'm not much of a seafood lover, but this is good! I would love to see more recipes for tuna like this. So thank you Jennifer W.!

Tasty marinade. If tuna is cooked perfectly it tastes great with wasabi sauce.

I thought the use of may did little to add flavor. Next time I will substitute it with reduced fat cream cheeses. I did use 1/4 tsp sesame oil drizzle to the tuna.

Love this - very creamy - skipped the Chinese 5 powder, used balsamic vinegar - doubled the sauce.  Perfect flavors for tuna, gourmet and perfect for guests!

Made to directions. Didn't achieve the "crust" I was hoping for however still tasty enough I would serve at a dinner party. Second time I made it I finished it off with a tiny drizzle of suracha cream sauce and was very pleased with the outcome.

Outstanding.  I used Pomegranite Red Wine vinegar, because that's what I had & saved the mayo-wasabi mix for a sauce.  Patted on sesame seeds before grilling.  Yum!
