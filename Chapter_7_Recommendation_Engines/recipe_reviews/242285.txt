This was the star dish of our BBQ dinner. I adjusted it to make it healthier: substituted organic sucanat (dried sugar cane juice) for white sugar, substituted arrow root for cornstarch, used sea salt, used 1 T minced fresh ginger, juice from  2 -3 fresh oranges, and used Kerrygold butter from grass fed cows. Delicious!

My OJ mixture was really thick after 60 seconds in the microwave (will check next time at 30 seconds, everybody's microwaves are different), so I did add some more OJ to it before adding the butter.  I microwaved the potatoes yesterday for 7 minutes, and they were totally cooked, so check for doneness early or you may end up with mashed sweet potatoes.  We particularly liked the ginger-orange juice combination, gave it just the right zing!    Mixed everything together today, baked for 15 minutes, and had a really delicious side dish for our pork tenderloin. Keep this one in mind for the Holidays, as this would be a perfect complement to a turkey or ham. Pamela, thanks for sharing not only a delicious recipe but an easy one, too.   We really enjoyed it!

Really enjoyed not having the "bite of lemon", but may have used too much ginger.

I used to micro-bake and mash my sweet potatoes with orange marmalade. Now that I found this recipe itâ€™s my new go to whenever I make sweet potatoes. I even added some grated fresh ginger. Yum!
