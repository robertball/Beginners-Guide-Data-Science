My family loved this recipe.  It was easy and good.  My three year old even liked them.  We also make them with what ever lunch meat we have on hand.

I tried it with Catalina dressing instead of Ranch. Very satisfying!

I used english muffins instead of bagels and cheddar cheese instead of mozzarella and they were still very tasty!
