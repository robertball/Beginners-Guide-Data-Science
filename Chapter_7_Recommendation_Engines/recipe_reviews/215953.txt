10-20-2015  ~This is a pretty darned respectable “recipe” for minestrone, buy by nature, a true minestrone needs no recipe – it’s basically to use meats, vegetables and pasta you have on hand.  Still, if it had to be written down, this is reliable and delicious.  In the spirit of personalizing it, I did make some additions, but I omitted nothing.  I removed some Italian sausage from its casing and browned that before adding the celery, onion and carrots.  I also added fresh parsley and oregano as well as both the rosemary and thyme, a good glug of red wine, a couple of Parmigiano-Reggiano rinds as it simmered, some Swiss chard as well as the zucchini and, for a more robust broth, beef broth rather than chicken broth.  We’re headed out of town again first thing in the morning so this was the ideal thing to make beforehand to clear out the fridge and for ease of serving and clean-up.  If you’re a novice to making minestrone, or any soup for that matter, you can make this with confidence, tho’ don’t hesitate to make it your own with whatever your preferences are or to use what you have on hand.

I made this according to recipe, but after tasting, found the broth bland and the consistency thin. To remedy, I added 14 oz can of tomato juice, 1/2 tsp EACH marjoram, oregano, basil, onion powder & paprika, and a dash of cayenne & tobasco. I simmered it another 15 minutes with the seasonings and it was delish. I also swapped kidney beans for cannellini beans, used a teaspoon of dried thyme rather than a tbsp of fresh it called for and added some frozen green beans. Good soup with a little tweaking.

I thought this soup was flavorful and delicious. I had a bag of frozen veggies for veggie soup so I used that but still used fresh onion and carrots and a zucchini and yellow squash. I used a can of undrained diced tomatoes. I usually won't eat soup for more than one day but I had this for lunch three days in a row!! I would make this again. Thanks!!

I thought this was very good, esp with the Parmesan.  I wouldn't make it again right away b/c it took awhile to eat it all, but I will be making it again.  Healthy and hearty and not too hard.  Didn't really love the zucchini in it though.

This soup was amazing! I did add my own twist to it though, instead of chicken broth, I did beef broth and 1 lb of beef chunks cooked in olive oil and fresh garlic and added it to the soup last. It's our new favorite soup!

It's a great base recipe for sure. I omitted zucchini  ( gets to mushy) and added tomato juice, sea salt, cracked pepper, and garlic powder. Both red and white beams, can of corn, mild Italian Turkey sausage,  plus the rest. Turned out great! Left the pasta on the side and scooped a spoonful in for each bowl (unless your eating it all, otherwise you'll end up with devolved pasta that turns the soup starchy). I will make this again
