This recipe was easy to make and came out really good. My family enjoyed it very much and there was many different kinds of great juicy flavors. It was very simple to make, especially important to someone lik me who is just starting to cook.

I was looking for something different to do with pork chops, and this recipe sure fit the bill. It was easy to make and came out very nice. I only used a teaspoon of cinnamon, and maybe it could use a little more, I'll try that next time I make this.

WAY too much cinnamon. Was missing flavor so I added homemade Italian dressing to the mix and lots of extra garlic. This helped. Pork ended up drier than I'm used to. Good ideas- needs work.

I made a few changes to this recipe as an experiment and it turned out pretty good.  I salted and peppered the pork cubes and also added all spice, I then coated the cubes in all purpose flour and sauteed them in veg oil until golden brown.  At that time I added the rest of the ingredients without the cinnamon.  I added a 1 tsp. of Cayenne pepper just for kicks.  Family didn't complain, I live to cook another day.

It was good.  I only used a couple dashes of cinnamon and added fennel.  The apples are a nice twist.  I'll probably use 2 next time.  My son gave the rating...
