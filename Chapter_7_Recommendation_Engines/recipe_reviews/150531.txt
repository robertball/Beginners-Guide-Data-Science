Yum! Super easy. I skipped the nuts as my boyfriend is allergic. The frosting tasted a little too much like powdered sugar for my taste so I added a little bit of corn syrup and a dash of cinnamon. This was so simple for what I got, and DBF was very happy with his breakfast in bed!

These rolls were very simple to make, and pretty good taste wise.  I think next time I will use a little more cinnamon inside the roll, and skip the pecans.  I really like the frosting to drizzle over the top, it's a good cinnamon roll topping.  I like these even better heated up the next day in the microwave.  I will definitely use the frozen bread dough for a base in the future, and will probably use the entire recipe again.

These cinnamon rolls are simple to make and everyone loves them! I get requests for them constantly. I don't use the icing recipe provided because I make a cream cheese icing instead. DELICIOUS!

This is a simple enough recipe.  I thought it just tasted "okay".  I do like the ease of using frozen bread dough, so I think I will use that idea and just search for other filling/frosting combinations.
