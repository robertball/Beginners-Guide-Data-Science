This was a quick and easy recipe that will make a great addition to a get together. The cranberry is a great pop of color and goes great with the brie and salty pretzels. I think it could use a bit of a kick with chipotle peppers mixed in. Next time I am going to try strawberry jam or pepper jelly. I think this is an excellent base and can be made with a variety of toppings  instead of or in addition to the cranberry sauce. It was a hit with my crew!

While I kind of like this, it is more of an "assembly" than a recipe.  Instead of using premade cranberry sauce, I used fresh cranberries and made a quick compote.  Since my group is either sweet or savory but never mix the two, I also whipped up a quick pesto to place on top for a more savory version.  Both went over well.  Thanks for the inspiration!

Very good and versatile easy party snack. Add pecans or walnuts. Serve on pretzel crisps or good wheat crackers.

this was very good, but I used the whole cranberry sauce instead of the jellied. The jellied just doesn't have the same flavor as the whole cranberry.
