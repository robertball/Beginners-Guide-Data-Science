Very yummy! An easy way to spice up leftovers from thanksgiving. They fall apart really easy though, I wonder if adding an egg or something in the mix would help it stick together.

I made a lot of changes, so take this review with a grain of salt. I didn't have any stuffing, so I saut√©ed an onion, added 1/2 C of peas, and a whole bunch of seasoning to the mixture. Instead of panko and butter for breading, I used 50/50 plain breadcrumbs and parmesan. I needed far more breading than the recipe called for. I made mine golf-ball size and I think I baked these at 400. My family LOVED these and they kept asking me to make more. The entire turkey leftovers wound up being turned into these croquets.

Really good and easy! Good way to use up leftovers and healthy alternative to frying.  I added a pinch of salt and 1/2 tbl Old Bay for a little kick

I made exactly as written.  While this is definitely a great use of turkey and side dish leftovers I found the recipe blah.  The amount of panko and eggs was not enough and I had to use another egg and more panko in order to cover all of the croquettes.  Would not make again.

8.1.16  This was delicious today made with chicken, but what a great way to use up Thanksgiving leftovers...remember this one for the Holidays!  They crisped up nicely on the outside, and were plenty tender with those mashed potatoes & stuffing inside.  If you have any turkey gravy left over, I think a drizzle  over the croquettes would be good.  I also think these would be a good candidate to go into the freezer and baked later and also could be finger food or a buffet table candidate.  Weeble, very, very nice recipe, thanks for sharing!
