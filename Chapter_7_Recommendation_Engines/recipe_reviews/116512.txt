This is the best recipe I've found for manicotti so far. It was a hit with my family. However, something in the ingredients made it slightly bitter tasting. I do recommend using marinara sauce instead of spaghetti. Also, try using a sandwich bag with a corner cut to insert the cheese mixture into the shells as somebody had suggested before. Overall, it's a terrific recipe.

I've never made manicotti before and this recipe was very simple. I halved it since there were only 2 people eating it. Also, this dish was great on the second day, possibly even better than straight out of the oven so I would recommend making the full recipe and eating it for 2 days (then again, I love left over pizza)

After making this like the recipe called for. I made it a second time to make some changes that I'd like. I halved the recipe except the sauce. I added raw zuccini slices on the bottom and around the sides. I used small curd cottage cheese (less fat) Added some shredded chicken breast and mixed in well with filling. Cooked the manicotti al dente to make it more workable while stuffing it with filling. I used a freezer bag with tip cut out to fill each pasta piece. I used fresh grated parmaggiano reggiano cheese. I cooked the same amt of time as the recipe covered but put the cheese on before baking then added extra on top and cooked about 7 minutes longer uncovered. To add a little bit to the bland taste that I usually experience with cheese stuffed manicotti I added a tsp of crushed red pepper flakes to the filling. You may want to add even a little bit more. Next time I may put a little bit of the zuccini chopped up in the filling and more whole slices in the surrounding sauce. A very good base recipe. Thanks for reminding me of a recipe I hadn't made in a long time. Reminds me of Mom... :-)

It was delicious before being cooked and heavenly afterwards. Easiest recipe I ever made. I followed the recipe exactly and it came out perfectly. The Manicotti was eaten in one night! Thanks!

I made this last night and my husband and I both thought it was excellent.  Since I was only cooking for two, I only made one pan, so I cut the ingredients in half,although I did take the advise of others and increased the sauce and used about 1 1/2 jars for one pan.  Will definitely make this again!

Awesome!   The only thing I did differently was added some parmesan to the mozzarella for the topping.  Will certainly make this again.

This was wonderful.  It was very easy to mix together and my only advice is to make sure you don't boil the noodles too long... it makes for difficulty stuffing them!  They were a hit in our family. Definitely something we would make again!!

This a simple manicotti dish that turned out great.  I used a fire roasted garlic and tomato sauce from Classico that gave it a nice garlic taste.

This is really easy and really good. I halved the recipe as I was only making it for my husband and myself, and it worked out beautifully. I doubt I'll ever make another cheese manicotti recipe since this is so easy.

I made this for my husband and I last week and we absolutely loved it! I might add some red pepper flakes next time I make it because we like a little kick to everything we eat, but other than that, the recipe was delicious!!

I love this recipe; it's my signature meal.  It's what's requested at potlucks and dinner parties.  Instead of using spaghetti sauce from a jar (since I really can't stand the stuff), I use the "Best Marinara Sauce" recipe also found on allrecipes.

This was delicious. I did not have parmesan so I used some cheddar that I had that needed to be used up. I also halved the recipe and used jumbo shells instead of manicotti. There was enough filling to fill about 3/4 of the shells and I used a plastic baggy for this step which made things a lot easier. I was cooking for two so there were plenty of stuffed shells left over (not yet thrown in the oven) that I just stored in the freezer. I will definitely be eating this a lot during lent season!

I made th recipe as is except for the fact I was a little short on mozarella and substituted almost half colcy-jack (couldn't even tell once baked!).  I think next time I'd reduce the spices a little.  The only thing I really do not like about this recipe is that even cut in half, it's a lot and there is only 2 of us.  I made my own "manicotti shells" from a recipe on this site - all I had to do was drop some of the mixture onto each one and roll it up - super easy and super fast!!

This is absolutely delicious. It is a little time consuming but not difficult to stuff the noodles. I first tried stuffing them with sandwich baggies with holes cut out, but found it much easier to use bare hands.  I added 1 lb of hamburger, cooked with a few cloves of fresh garlic. I also only boiled the noodles for 1/2 the recommended time because I didn't want them to get soggy. Next time I will either reduce the cooking time, or add additional sauce because it was on the dry side. I also do not recommend spagetti sauce--will be too sweet. I used Marinara  I was able to feed 5 children, & 6 adults with this dish + salad and still had most of the 2nd pan leftover. Most adults even had seconds and I got lots of compliments! Even better then 2nd day. I will make it again

This is amazing!! I have never made manicotti before, and I loved this recipe! I used marinara sauce instead of spaghetti sauce...and had my husband hold the noodles as I filled them. I have already recommended this to friends. I am actually making it again tonight =) So easy & so delicious!

I made this recipe as is and was a little disappointed. It tasted very very sweet. I think it was the spaghetti sauce, which is the kind I normally buy. The only think I can think of is the lack of meat. I always put ground beef in my spaghetti sauce and without it, I think the sauce wasn't hearty enough for me. I plan on making this again, but this time I will mix in some ground beef into the sauce. FOLLOW UP: Made this again last night and added meat to the sauce and it was wonderful!

The best recipe I've tried. I also sometimes substitute with large shells, they're just easier to scoop the cheese into. Reminds me of the food I used to get at an Italian restaurant in my old neighborhood.

I have my own manicotti recipe but I decided I wanted to try a new one. I was making dinner for my husband and I so I actually halved this recipe. It turned out really good! The seasonings were perfect. I would definitely make it again.

I  made a meat sauce and used an Italian blend cheese for the filling.  But, topped it with mozzarella at the end! Delicious!

Very good. But I don't know who said prep time is 20 minutes. It takes almost that long just to stuff the shells, so expect to spend a half hour doing prep. They freeze well, so you can still enjoy this if you are only making it just for yourself.

Loved it. I left out the onion powder, garlic powder and seasoned salt. Instead I used green onion, minced garlic, and added 2 cups of fresh chopped spinach. I covered it all with spinach Florentine sauce (Classico brand) It was phenomenal... Happy mouths and full bellies!

This manicotti is amazing! I've made it multiple times & it is definitely a favorite! I followed the recipe exactly and no changes were needed. It was better than the ones I had in restaurants! Next time I'm going to try adding sauteed mushrooms and spinach to change it up a bit.

Very, very good!  I followed the recipe as written, except instead of jarred spaghetti sauce, I used "Best Marinara Sauce Yet" from this site.  The filling had a really nice flavor.  I piped the filling into the shells out of a ziploc bag, and worked well, although it was a little cumbersome.  Will definitely make again!

Not only is this Manicotti incredibly delicious, it doesn't take much to make it. I left out the Parmesan cheese and used extra Mozzerella. Quite tasty! I also followed the many comments to not cook the shells first. I will definitely be making this again!

I changed this recipe by putting teeny pieces of chicken(Im not big on beef), browned on the pan, into the mixture, turned out amazing, but I think it would have been great without it. Perfect tasting and easy.

My husband and I really enjoyed this recipe.  We arranged sliced zucchini under the manicotti in each dish and added a 10 oz. package of chopped spinach to the manicotti filling - and it turned out wonderfully!  We made one dish with Classico Traditional Sweet Basil sauce and the other with Emeril's Homestyle Marinara sauce; both were excellent.  Since this recipe made such a large amount, we'll probably freeze one of the dishes for a later meal.  We'll probably make this again.

I used this recipe with "Melharvey's spaghetti sauce", from this site with great success.  My family of 8 LOVED it and it will definately find a place in our dinner rotation.  This is easy enough to put together for kids to prepare it and is pretty kid friendly on taste, even for little ones.  (ok, maybe it's just my youngest child who is the pickiest...) Thank you for a great recipe!

My family had never had this and I was really wanting some Manicotti, so looked up the recipe and decided this had to be the easiest one to make, although I did add some Provalone cheese and a pack of frozen, rinsed, and squezzed dried Spinach. I also add the remaining Parmesan cheese I had left to the top. I was GREAT!! Although a lil much for 3 people but it didn't go to waste! Planes for the next batch is to add some diced Jalapeno peppres.

Very good recipe! Even my carnivore husband exclaimed, "This is good! I almost forgot there was no meat in it." Huge compliment from him - haha. 
I scaled the recipe to 5 servings but somehow had lots of leftover filling. And I'd like to try to prepare it without cooking the manicotti first b/c they tend to split when you fill them. I've seen that option in other recipes. Hope to recreate this recipe in that manner in the future. Thanks!

My wife and I fixed this dish tonight based on her recommendation.  And...  I must say...  It was wonderful.  The ingredients for the stuffing all mixed very well to make for an incredibly tasty and VERY easy to make dinner.  We used McCormick's spices, Wal Mart brand cheeses, and Ragu sauce, and even with cheap ingredients the dish was delicious.  Tender, tasty, and simple.

Highly recommended.

This was a good base manicotti recipe.  I did think it needed a bit more flavor so I added some garlic and spinach.  It was very tasty and I'll be making it again soon.
