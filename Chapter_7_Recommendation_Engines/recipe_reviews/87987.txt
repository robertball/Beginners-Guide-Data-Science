Delicious! Got some Crowder Peas at our farmer's market and found this recipe. I had no bacon or ham (although both would be great in this recipe) so I used 1 tablespoon butter. No bell peppers, so I added an anaheim pepper, also from the market. Instead of garlic powder I used a fat garlic clove. And I didn't crush the bay leaf but put it in whole & removed it when ready to serve. Great recipe and great seasonings. Thanks GLOKEY--it was just what I needed!

Holy Moly!  These were great!  I have eaten crowder peas/purple hull peas forever but not like this.  Didn't use the ham and didn't miss it.  Used minced garlic and cooked my fresh peas for the first hour with a slice of uncooked bacon as instructed by my southern relatives.  Saved in my recipes for use again and again.  Thanks.

I am giving this 5 stars - because I do not want to ruin the rating - but I searched literally probably 40 stores by phone and in person and could not find crowder peas in my state (Utah).  I bought all the ingredients and it was a tremendous let down.  Anybody familiar with crowder peas - I would love a good substitue. I read you could use blackeyed peas but the flavor was much milder - which is kind of a letdown. I so want this to be authentic.  Any ideas from any of you would be appreciated??

The most common mistake in cooking fresh or frozen field peas of any kind is to add a bunch of seasonings.  The peas have a delicate flavor and should not be seasoned with anything other than a moderate amount of salt and some seasoning meat (smoked ham hocks, dry salt meat, etc.).  Cover shelled peas with lightly salted water with the meat.  Bring water to a boil, reduce heat to a simmer (covered) for one hour.  Remove lid and continue to simmer for 30 min. (this is important to get the rich dark broth that is so important)  Serve with cornbread and cold milk with fried green tomatoes or fried potato/onion patties.  Nothing better!

I doubled the recipe (except for the water, kept that at 2 cups) and added a lot more ham, making this into a main dish.  I had to use black-eyed peas because I couldn't find crowder peas.  Very, very tasty!  I will use this on New Year's Day for the traditional serving of black-eyed peas for good fortune in the new year.  Thank you!

Everyone loved this recipe. We used fresh peas and chorizo from the farmer's market.  The flavors are absolutely out of this world.  My 18 year old said it was wonderful.

I love some Crowder peas. I would say the thyme is not necessary though, just let the taste of the peas come through, please

This recipe was fabulous and I even made it wrong!  I could not find crowder peas anywhere, so I decided to substitute black-eyed peas.  Unfortunately I had everything ready to go and realized I did not have black-eyed peas.  I used baby butter beans instead and it was still wonderful.  I served it with yellow rice.  A big hit.  I will definitely add this to my menu more often.

Delicious!   My entire family loved them and that isn't always easy when it comes to beans/peas.   They do take some time to shell but the fresh peas are terrific.   I cooked per the recipe.  The Peas were really tender in about 30 min.   I've been craving them since I made them and will make it again soon.

Love crowder peas!  I had to make a few changes because I didn't have  everything on hand.  No bacon or ham so I used smoked sausage.  I browned that first with my onion and fresh garlic.  Didn't have green pepper so I subbed in a 14oz can of chopped tomatoes with green chilies.  I also added a 14oz can of chicken broth along with added water.  Was also out of thyme. Will try that next time.  So I added a Herb ox low sodium chicken bouillon packet and I did have the bay leaf, but I didn't crush that.  Just kept that whole.  The peas turned out wonderful!  Definitely making again :)

Awesome! It was as a big hit with everyone. I had just gotten some home grown crowder peas from a friend of mine so I looked for a good recipe. I didn't even realizes that those peas were called crowder peas until I looked for a recipe cause in the south we just call them peas. I just love shelling those things.

This was very good. The only changes I made was adding some miinced garlic and salt to taste. I ommitted the thyme and parsley per other reviewer comments. I will use this again. It even passed one of the picker eater's of the household taste test.

We used fresh crowder peas, fresh garlic, whole bay leaf and added kale - it was delicious! Served like a stew or soup with no rice.

This was a yummy use for the crowder peas and peppers I received in my CSA box! I fried up the bacon and set it aside, cooked up the onions and peppers in the grease then tossed everything into my slow cooker for about five hours. I put the bacon on the top when we served it later that day.

I had never heard of crowder peas until I recently moved to TN from IL.  I found some at a local Farmer's Market and thought they looked interesting so I bought some fresh.  I made this recipe almost exactly as written, but I had a few less than 2 cups of peas, so I cut back on the water to about 1-3/4 cup and added extra garlic (fresh - can never have too much) and a couple shakes of cumin (we like things a little kicky) and it was WONDERFUL!  Will definitely be seeking out more peas at the market this weekend and making a larger batch.  Thanks so much for sharing!

My changes: 1) one teaspoon garlic powder; 2) heaping tablespoon of sweet pepper relish instead of green pepper; and 3) a cup and a half, approximately, of cubed baked ham (more ham would not hurt it). It works best with a tight fitting cover. My finicky teenaged son LOVED it.

Followed recipe almost to the letter. Used fresh crowder peas from my farm stand. Wasn't sure how much ham 2 slices of cooked ham was, used 3 fairly thin slices of a small cooked ham. Tasted great. Loved it. Will make it again. Thinking about trying it with shrimp and andouille. The peas took a little longer to cook than I expected. The pea portion of the dish was a little runnier than I expected, but the rice soaks it right up. You want that yummy liquid, so don't try to boil it off.

Loved it!! My picky husband and friend said it was one of their favorite meals I've made. His friend even told me he'd pay me to make it for him he liked it so much lol! 

The peas portion I made very little changes. I omitted the parsley, used a whole bay leaf and removed it when done. I added a little extra water at the end and 1lb of Polish sausage cut up. Did not use ham.

This recipe is perfec.  I was concerned about the amount of garlic powder, so I put half in and ended up putting the rest in.  Glokey hit the nail on the head with this one.

Not quite what I expected, kinda bland for my taste.  I ended up chopping some fresh jalapeno to improve the flavor but as written it was just ok.

I'm excited to find this recipe as I got some seeds at a local seed exchange. I didn't know anything about them!  According to a local here, you can use them fresh or dried and they dried so fast I'm going to use them dried.  Thanks for the recipe!
