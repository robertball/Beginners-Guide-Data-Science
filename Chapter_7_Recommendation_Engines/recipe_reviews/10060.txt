This is a great and EASY recipe! Basic pantry ingredients!! DONE---in like 5 minutes--the hardest part is waiting for them to cool so you can enjoy them! (i've never put the chocolate finish on them) PANCAKE SYRUP(my preferrence) is an excellent substitute for the corn syrup, since it's essentially maple flavored corn syrup.  It is the best no-bake cookies I have tried--but I had to shorten the boil time. I shortened the boil time to 30-35 seconds--if they get too hard, you boiled it too long.  You can try most any cereal and I also suggest adding more cereal like others have said---but they are good really gooey too just as is! I am asked for this recipe repeatedly. Having your peanut butter measured and ready before you start is key!

My kids love these! These are also good made with Captain Crunch cereal. I've also tried Chex cereal and they turned out great. My kids like them best made with Rice Krispies. I ususally whatever cereal I have on hand.
For those that had them turn out too hard, you just cooked them a little too long. I begin timing as soon as I see bubbles around the edges of the pan.

A family favorite. I've made these 3 times in the last 2 weeks!!! They are so easy and so tasty. It's an easier alternative to Rice Krispie treats and they taste better too. I left off the chocolate, etc. Not needed. I made these as a girl when I was in 4-H and I'm thrilled to have the recipe again. Take my advice- don't let the corn syrup mixture boil too long. If you do, they get hard. I let it boil for about 30 seconds at the most. I measure the peanut butter before I turn on the stove, so that the corn syrup doesn't over boil. Make this recipe. You will love it.

Instead of dropping these for cookies, spread and pat in a pan for bars! Then just spread the melted choc/butterscotch chips on top. Less hassle than dropping them on wax paper. I have been making these for years but my recipe calls for Special K cereal.  This is a favorite around our house and gets raves wherever I take them! So yummy and Chewy!

Wow!This recipe is truly delicious and so easy!it only took me 5 or 7 minutes to make it!I do agree on adding 5 Cups of(crushed) corn flakes instead of 4 1/2,they didn't stick at all and also only boil the corn syrup for not more then 35 seconds so they won't harden up.You may also sprinkle powdered sugar once they cool off a bit.Enjoy!

I thought these cookies were great, but I didn't like the butterscotch and chocolate drizzle, it hid the peanut butter flavor. Next time I would only drizzle melted chocolate.  ALso, only use about 1 Cup of chips total, I drizzled very well, and still had half a bowl left.

Yummy, yummy, yummy!  Thanks for sharing this recipe.  I only let the syrup boil for 1 minute, then added 5 CUPS cornflakes.  I spread the entire mixture onto a cookie sheet (sprayed with Pam), and let cool.  I drizzled the chocolate/butterscotch combo over the top, but my family and I decided that we did not like the flavor of the two.  Next time I will only use chocolate.  They were very easy to cut into squares once cool, soft and chewy.  Awesome alternative to Rice Krispie Squares!

Quick and easy.  The best thing I can say about this recipe is that it is still good days after making, they also took care of my sweet cravings very well.

This recipe is wonderful! It was very easy to make and everone loved them. They were very chewy. The people who had hard chews, probably over cooked the syrup.

Not a fave for our house. Seemed bland, we were hoping for more of a peanut butter and chocolate flavor, but instead it just tastes like sugar.

Try it this way!  I took Trader Joe's high protein/high fiber cereal and processed it until fine.  I used 2 1/2 cups of that and 1 cup of regular rolled oats.  4 1/2 cups of dry ingredients would have made this much too dry.    Very very good and at least some nutritional benefit.  Not a 'diet' food of course, but a 'cookie with benefits'...

These are awesome. This is one of the bars (we put them in pans instead for easier serving) that we served recently at my daughters high school graduation open house. I never do these on the stove. I use the microwave. I  put the syrup, sugar and butter in a glass bowl and when it is bubbling take it out and add the peanut butter.

I made these two weekends in a row.  Loved it! loved it! loved it.....!  

I have made these a couple times and I have been adding 5 cups of corn flakes.  It helps cut the sweetness and they are not as sticky on the wax paper.  Easier to remove.  Still very yummy!

I use Rice Krispies to make these easier to work with, always remove from heat *after* stirring in the PB, and skip the drizzle!  If I'm making them for home I press the recipe into a 9x13 pan and then cut into bars, but for a large group I make them into balls for ease of serving and clean up!  (to make balls, scoop onto wax paper lined cookie sheets quickly, then go back and roll each "pile" into a nice ball!)

I'm so delighted to find this recipe!  Both of my husband's grandmas worked in the high school cafeteria so he grew up on these except they were made with Cheerios and they were pressed into a pan and cut into bars.  I never really cared for them but I love this version with corn flakes.  They make a softer bar and are much easier to chew.  I followed the advice of other reviewers and boiled the corn syrup mixture for about 30 seconds. Then I lightly crushed the corn flakes so that they would have a more uniform texture.  Once cut, I dipped the bars in melted chocolate and drizzled the rest on top.  My whole family LOVES these.

Super easy recipe and my grandkids love them!  I used Rice Krispies instead of corn flakes.  I also reduced the cooking time to 30 seconds like another member suggested.  Just keep them out on the counter in a cookie jar and watch them disappear!!!

Very yummy!  I agree with CALNICKMOM, you have to be very careful to not boil the sugar too long.  Mine didn't get hard, but they did stick to the wax paper, very badly! I recommend putting them on a non-stick cookie sheet. I took them to a club meeting, they were a hit!

I have been looking for this recipe for years since I remember them from grade school!  I remember they used to cut them into square bars and sprinkle them with chocolate sprinkles!  Thanks for bringing back a childhood memory!

Waaaaay BAD!! These are far too addictive to keep for yourself.  We added chopped salted peanuts for extra crunch. Easy peasy to make and super fast - these will become a regular in our house..... even Roxy the dog likes the crumbs!  Thank you Cindy x

This is an awesome recipe for peanut butter lovers!... Like others suggested, I only boiled the sugar and corn syrup for 30 seconds... and I had the peanut butter premeasured... I used about 2 1/2 cups of Chex cereal and 2 1/2 cups of Honey Bunches of Oats cereal... I also went ahead and made the chocolate-butterscotch drizzle...which was awesome, but way too much...I drizzled pretty generously and still had a lot left over... which wasn't bad because I used the remaining mixture to dip half of the drizzled "chews" in... I think the chews were good without the drizzle, but you won't be disappointed if you do decide to make it... My suggestion is to reduce the chips to 1/2 semi-sweet & 1/2 butterscotch... Overall, this was a very rich and delicious treat!

These are sooo yummy and simple to make!!! DO NOT USE PANCAKE SYRUP! I used 5 1/2 cups of cornflakes, omitted the chocolate/butterscotch drizzle (they are super sweet already) and mixed everything in a large glass bowl. As others have mentioned boil only 30 seconds (boiling them too long causes them to become hard instead of chewy). Spray your wax paper w/ cooking spray before dropping the chews onto it. These are even tasty warm but better the next day. Next time I may add some almonds for a crunch. Little ones are sure to enjoy this tasty treat!

Such an easy, sweet treat.  I spread these in a metal 13x9 and then just sprinkled the choc chips over the top then stuck it under the broiler till the chips started to melt and I could spread them with a spatula.

Just like we used to make as kids!  I didn't have corn syrup so I substituted 3/4 honey and 1/4 pancake syrup.  It's all I had on hand and it turned out very good.

Ok, so I really stuffed this up. My 'chews' ended up rock hard! Was my mistake to boil the corn syrup and sugar for one minute, starting when the WHOLE pan was boiling? Or should it have been one minute from when the mixture was furiously bubbling round the edges of the pan? I threw them all out. What a shame!

Chewy and delicious no-bake cookies!  I made half the recipe and used 2 1/2 cups rice crispies. Put spoonfuls onto large wax-papered cookie sheet, then formed slightly with hands to smooth the balls.  Got about 2 dozen.  Omitted chips.  Agree not to boil corn syrup/sugar more than 1 minute, 'cuz they really hardened up by the next morning!  Not just for kids.  Why make bars when you can make drop cookies more easily and not have to cut them or mess a pan?

These were simple and tasted great.  We made these for a quick treat.  We used Corn Flakes.  I was out of waxed paper so I used foil.  They lifted right up without any problems.  I melted chocolate in a double broiler and then placed in a baggie and cut the tip off to easily drizzle over the chews.  Very enjoyable.

My kids and I love this recipe! It is so simple! I have tried it several ways. My favorite variation uses rice cereal in place of the corn flakes. These are very addictive!

I couldn't get the chips to melt.  They burned in the microwave and then I tried a double boiler.  These cookies are sticky and too sweet.  I doubt that I would make them again.

Whoa, these are really SWEET! I made 1/2 recipes and using a cookie scoop still got 30. I think I may have made them small though. They turned out and they were definitely chewy as suggested. The peanut butter caramel flavor is a good combination. The sugary taste was just overwhelming. I used peanut butter and cornflakes without sugar to. I guess it was to be expected though with both sugar and corn syrup. I will see how well they go over tommorrow in the work coffee room. It might just be personal preference on sweetness. I didn't do the optional chocolate drizzle either.

went looking for a dessert that could be made with regular pantry items and found this one. Fast and delicious! Instead of semi-sweet chocolate chips, I melted a large dark chocolate bar in the microwave and used it to spread on the top of the chews that I had spread out in a cookie tray (as suggested by many). Thank you for submitting!

I think these are WONDERFUL! I followed some of the other reviews by only boiling the syrup for 30 seconds, I opted in for chunky peanut butter and added cashew bits to the top! YUMMY!

I've been making this recipe for years (as bars) and topping with the chocolate/butterscotch chip combo. The consistency is fine if you don't pack it down too much. I never have any leftovers of these bars. Excellent and super quick!

YUMMY!! Our whole family loved these! I pressed them in a 9x9 square pan, sprayed with Pam and covered with the chocolate and butterscotch chips. They were easy and delicious.

I make these a lot either when my husband is craving something sweet RIGHT NOW or I'm low on ingredients and want to make something with what I have on hand. If I made them any more than that, we'd be as big as a house.

I've made them with chocolate, butterscotch, peanut butter and white chocolate toppings....sometimes they've been intermingled. Sometimes, I'll even throw the chips into the mix or even salted peanuts.

These are heavenly, and so easy.  I usually bake every weekend for deserts for full week, but this week I was just tired.  5 minutes in the kitchen and these were DONE.  I did increase the peanut butter by about a 1/4 to 1/3 cup, and increased the Corn Flakes to 5 cups.  I just sprinkled the chocolate chips on top and let them set.

Sub Special-K cereal for the cornflakes and press it into a 9X13 pan and you have K-Bars! I just sprinkle the chips on top and put them into a warm oven for a few minutes (not too long or it will be as hard as a rock)just to melt the chips and then frost with a spreader. Be careful about overheating the corn syrup and sugar or your end result will be very hard.

These really bring back childhood memories.  We always had these at family reunions when I was little - always had them in a pan (like rice krispie treats) and cut into squares.  So good!

Ok...these were very good. They reminded me of some bars my mom use to make when i was young using Special K cereal and a 9x13 pan. Next time I will do a few things different. If you use wax paper I HIGHLY suggest spraying it first with cooking spray! We could not remove the bars from the paper after they cooled for 2 hours. Also, i will make them much smaller because they are awfully chewy which makes eating them very difficult when they are a bigger size. I think I will just spray a 9x 13 pan...press the cereal mixture into this....then pour chocolate mixture over the top:)

These are just like the ones I remember from school when I was a kid. They are really easy to make and kids love 'em! I prefer mine plain without the chocolate drizzle. Drop onto parchment paper and they will not stick once they are cooled.

YUMMY!!  Kids LOVED it!!  Here are the two secrets to make this.  1- a quick boil of the corn syrup mixture, 30 seconds is best.  2- spray your hands with no stick spray to keep the mixture from sticking.  Enjoy!!

These were yummy.  I did change the cornflakes to cheeriors.  I also added 3 sifted tablespoons of cocoa as I was needing a chocolate fix.  I didn't have any chips to add either.

Whatever you do...don't leave these to cool on wax paper for too long, I would use parchment paper next time.  We left these to cool, lightly covered, overnight...and they were STUCK to the wax paper in the morning.  I couldn't get the wax paper off because the cookies are chewy/gooey and I just made a huge mess, so I had to toss them.  Good thing we tried a few the night before, while they were still warm:  they were tasty, but I also made them a bit too large.

Oh my gosh- SO YUMMY!! My coworkers are going nuts over them. I had no problem getting them to stay soft and chewy. My Pampered Chef small scoop was perfect for spooning them out. I took the others' advice and used 5 cups of cornflakes and didn't bother with the chocolate drizzle. I think I need to move them out of my office before I eat the whole batch!

I liked these, but I think I liked "Peanut Butter Bars VI" on this site much better because they were more crunchy.  I thought these were a bit tough to work with (i.e., gooey) when dropping them, and were chewy to eat.

This is the first review I've ever given...but I absolutely had to!!  These are the cookies I remember getting during school lunch.  And we all know there wasn't much to look forward to during school lunch.  I used the 5 cups of cornflakes as others suggested.  Brings back memories...THANKS!!!!

This simple recipe turned out great!  And to easily clean the gooey mess from the pot, add hot water to it and set it on the burner. The corn syrup will dissolve in the boiling water, making it easier to clean!

I love these!  They are the best!  I add a cup of raisins to them, and call them breakfast bars.  The kids love  them too, and think of them as a treat for breakfast.

Good recipe for kids. I made these with rice crispies,using 6 cups to make up for
the chocolate chips/butterscotch. These are plenty sweet plain! I sprayed a 9x6 baking dish with non-stick & pressed flat. Spray your knife with non-stick too. Turned out perfect!

Kids loved these. I have a similar recipe that calls for 8 cups of cereal which makes them harder and more for a bar cookie. I'm going to try 6 cups next time and cut into bar cookies. Great tasty recipe!!

deeeeee-lish!!!  I used 5 cups of rice rispies & only drizzled with choc chips.  I also let it cool slightly, then sprayed my hands with pam and shaped them more into cookie shapes-- you could probably shape them into nice designs. Just watch out for some Hot spots!!
Definitly a keeper recipe!!!

I had to toss out the first batch and start over.. I cooked the syrup about 6 minutes instead, added some vanilla, and used tiny chips instead. In fact, everything had to be really small, in order to form these at all. After the adjustments.. it was really good. I mailed 4 batches out with other cookies for xmas.

really quick and simple!  They turned out really good and I had a really hard time keeping my 2 year old out of them.  I bribe him with candy to go potty and he chose these over his favorite candies for his potty treat!  WOW!!  My picky husband even complemented me on them and ate 2 in a row!  Great recipe!

Very good, easy...I took them to a fundraiser bakesale.  People that bought them and sampled them came back and bought more.  These are almost a candy instead of a cookie.  I'm glad I left off the melted chips.

I thought these were great, and so did my mother who normally exhibits great self control when it comes to sweets.  She didn't with these, she ate 7 of them in one day!.  I did some plain and some with drizzled chocolate.  Chocoholic that I am, I preferred the ones with chocolate.  I didn't feel they were messy at all.

These peanut butter chews are AWESOME!!!! They are so easy to make.  I had a craving for something sweet and threw these together in minutes.  I loved the fact that it is made from things I always have on hand...can't beat that.

I learned how to make these cookies in middle school home ec class so long ago!  I lost the recipe and have been making them by memory since then - which means sometimes they turn out and sometimes they don't!! It's great to have the recipe now! :)  Also, these are great to make with kids - I used to make them when I would babysit and called them "goop" which the kids loved!!  Finally, you can also use rice krispy-type cereal in place of the cornflakes, if you like.

This recipe is a big hit in my family.  We have enjoyed it (without the chips) for many years.  We press it into a pie pan and cut into bars, rather than make drop cookies.  Makes a great gift with recipe included.  Everyone that trys it, loves it!

Made em, liked em, probably make em again. I didn't have corn flakes so I used some stale rice Chex, also used dark corn syrup because I had left over syrup from thanksgiving pecan pies I made.  It worked Well.. I made bars because it was quick, chilled them and cut then into small two bite squares. Perfect. See the photo.

My dad wasn't a huge fan, but my mother and brother (self-proclaimed peanut butter addicts) were over the moon! Next time, I would definitely do what some other reviewers said and put this into a bar pan and make the chocolate more of an icing. Thanks for the recipe!

I used brown sugar instead of white and oats, about 2 cups, instead of corn flakes. Also chopped about 1/2 cup dry roasted peanuts to get a slightly sweet/salty taste (you can use more but I used chunky instead of creamy peanut butter). Came out great and looked more like the ones I used to eat in school. Forget the chocolate and butterscotch, the ones I had in school didn't have it besides sweet enough as it is.

This is amazing! We used to LOVE getting these from the school cafeteria when I was in the 7th and 8th grade and I've been wondering how to make them lately, so I got online and voila! Thanks for sharing.  Never would have guessed that's what was in them, and I thought cocoanut was in them, too.

Easier than I thought.  Could I add chocolate chips into the mix?  Used the Betty Crocker glaze instead of melting chips.  Also made it gluten free by buying the right cereal.  Eatten up quickly.

These were good but really sugary sweet.  The chocolate did not melt down to "drizzling"  consistency...ever.  We just spread it, then it didn't look great but oh well.  Tasted pretty good but probably won't make again.

I liked these!  BUT, I think better if you only used chocolate chips, not butterscotch-one too many flavor competing here..and I made mine a little too big..I should drop them by smaller spoonfuls next time because they are pretty rich and can give your jaws a workout.  Very chewy/candy-like and very good!

so easy!  everything is usually on hand.  used rice krispies tho.  let the mixture boil for about 35 seconds (as to prevent hardness as recommended by other reviewers).  worked beautifully.  thank you!

Easy and delicious! I had these done in about 5 minutes. The hardest part was waiting for them to set so I could eat them. It says the topping is optional, but that is what really pushed these over the edge for me.

Oh my - these are spectacular!  I used 5 cups of cereal and only about 1/4 cup of butterscotch chips.  I spread these out in a greased pan and then drizzled the melted chips on top so we'd have bars.  It doesn't get much better than this!  I, too, only boiled the syrup/sugar mixture for 30 seconds and these stayed nice and soft.  Takes very little time or effort and the flavor is out of this world!

Quite simple to make.. I didn't make them into cookies, i made them into bars, and I refrigerated them after i put the chocolate on top so it would harden, but DON'T DO IT! They were impossible to cut, so I had to 'unthaw' them in the microwave.  I brought them to a staff party and everyone loved them, but they are so so soooo sticky and get stuck in your teeth, and are actually quite hard to bite into.  So people DO like them, but I won't make them again.

Pretty good. I used frosted flakes (5 cups as suggested), and I crushed them some, but I'm thinking they might have been better crushed more finely, as it would have made the bars more dense. I like them best refrigerated. I sprayed a 9x13 pan with Pam and pressed the mixture into it. 3/4C of melted chocolate chips drizzled on top was plenty.

IMHO, Cheerios are the best cereal to use with this recipe.  I usually press into a buttered pan and cut into squares.

I just made this for Fallfest at my school. I needed a no-bake recipe and chose this one because it had the least ingredients and seemed easiest to make. I used pancake syrup instead of corn syrup because that's what I happened to have and it's mostly corn syrup anyway. The ingredients were easy to mix and prepare, I boiled the corn syrup for 30 seconds like the other reviewers suggested, that gives it a good consistency. The difficult part comes when you have to form the cookies, the mixture is extremely sticky and refuses to behave. I have no idea how those nice even balls (as seen in the photo) were made. The cookies taste like pure sugar, although they smell like peanut butter, you can't really taste it. It's a nice quick recipe if you need something for a school event, but if you know how to bake, I'd stick to that (at least I will). Hopefully the hungry college students will appreciate these more then I do.

I love these- I don't even bother with the chocolate. They are addictive. One of my favorite things to do is to mix up a batch, but instead of dropping them by the spoonful, I spread the whole batch evenly on top of a cooled pan of brownies. Cut them into bars- always a big hit!

Wow these were so good and so easy! I didn't have corn syrup on hand so I did try it with maple syrup and I just patted them into a 9x13 pan. They turned out great! My hubby didn't like them that much so I took them work(so I wouldn't eat the whole pan!). They were gone in half an hour!

My family LOVES these easy to make treats.  One thing I do differently is put the corn flakes in a very large bowl, then add the peanut butter mixture.  It is so much easier to mix and less mess.

I loved these when I was a kid. It would be nice if the school cafetarias where we lived actually made great food like this, rather than hire companies to come in and serve our children the processed junk that they put on the line. Just my 2 cents.

I heated the mixture in the microwave for about 2-3 minutes, until it was very bubbbly. I also used a bit less sugar, and more corn flakes. I spread them on a baking sheet instead of shaping them into balls, because they were breaking too much. I didn't like them when they first hardened, because they were too chewy and sweet. Two days later, I cannot stop eating them! They are still very sweet, but now they are light and crispy. Also, they make a huge batch, so I would recommend making half a batch the first time. If spreading on a sheet, they cut nicely into squares, or just break them with your fingers like I did!lol

Yum!  My pantry was overflowing with peanut butter but sadly I did not have cornflakes so I substituted frosted flakes and cut way down on the sugar and they turned out wonderfully! I also did not drizzle the chocolate but will try that next time.  Oh, and per another reviewer spraying the wax paper with Pam was a must. My kids really enjoyed them. Thanks!

Yum! I followed other comment suggestions and added more corn flakes than the recipe called for and left off the chocolate topping! They were sooo good!

These are so good and so easy.  My 11 year old son made them with me and we have already finished about 1/3 of the batch.  Will have to make a double next time.  We didn't use any of the chocolate or butterscotch on top.  Didn't need it.

Excellent!  I didn't make the toppings to drizzle on top because they were sweet enough already.  Will definitely make again.

this is really good... 
my first batch, well you won't wanna try. it was sooooo hard that your teeth could fall out. but that batch was customied to make 4 cookies, so i think that if you wanna size it down, don't over do it like me. 
i had to make it for my home econmic class so i kept trying until i decided to just size it down by a half... before i know it, it was all devoured by my classmates. they all loved it and wanted to know the recipe!

This recipe was excellent. The only thing that didn't work for us was combining the butterscotch and chocolate chips - they just didn't melt. We used ice cream toppings instead - we drizzled chocolate and butterscotch on top of these they were awesome. It won me 2nd place in a dessert making contest.

My aunt used to make these for us when I was a kid.  I'd never had the chocolate drizzled over them, so that was new.  I think next time I'll try milk chocolate instead of semi-sweet (since I really love the chocolate/peanut butter combo).

These cookies are sooooooo yummy!  I used to make these after school when I was a kid and making them for my kids really brought back memories.  Make sure you use a non-stick pot if you can - it's a mess trying to clean the sticky goo out of the other kind!

Very good. After removing the mixture from the heat, I put the chocolate chips in and stirred until melted, then followed the rest of the recipe. Husband and kids love them.

These were really yummy. I didnt do so well with the chocolate drizzling, melted chocolate projects are always kind of a mess for me, but these were a fun alternative to the traditional cookie. A friend asked for the recipe and was surprised at how easy they are to make.

it was disgusting, I don't know if it's because corn flakes are different in Canada as they are in the U.S. but something just did not make it right, and they were not chewy at all, they became very stiff, and hard on your teeth, not enjoyable to make, and it's very messy...
not something you want kids running around a house with, sticky, that's all i have to say...
