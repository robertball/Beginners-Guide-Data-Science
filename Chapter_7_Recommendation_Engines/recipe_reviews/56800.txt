I actually haven't tried this recipe because I have one from my mother that uses coconut butter instead of dairy butter, and social tea biscuits instead of butter cookies. But there is nothing on earth quite like this dessert. 

I've had this every Christmas since I was old enough to chew food. My mom still makes about 10 of these every Christmas and gives them away, and everybody always goes crazy for them.

ALWAYS use coconut oil! The original german recipe asks for coconut oil. Also, you don't have to put rum in it. My mom would make that cake a lot for birthdays (I actually am german and grew up over there) and she never put alcohol in it.

Wow, the alcohol content in this dessert was unbelievable.  This is definitely not something you want to give children.  With that said, this was quite worth the time and the ingredients to make - it turned out extremely rich and flavorful.  I did not use "standard" American butter cookies for this dish, however, as the holes in the center wouldn't have allowed them to lay properly in the pan.  You will need European style cookies for this - they are square.  I used a brand called LU Petit Beurre - it can be found in any large-scale supermarket.  The rest of the recipe I did "as normal", and it worked perfectly fine.  Very rich and delicious, indeed.  It's well worth trying.  Just watch the booze!!!!

It is very good.  I used the cookies someone mentioned before because they fit very well on the bottom of the pan.  I am from Germany and my mom made it for years but never ever used coconut oil as someone else mentioned.  My mom was a cook in Germany in her younger years and she said she never heard of anyone using coconut oil.

I have been looking for a replacement for my Grandmother's recipe for years and this did it! I cannot find the solid coconut oil where I live, so I needed something else. This tastes just like my Grandmother's! Booze included! :)

This recipe is excellent exactly as is.   I see the reviews mentioning coconut oil, I will try that next time as I use coconut oil as often as I can for the health benefits.  I did have a hard time finding a good cookie that would be suitable, but after searching in several stores I was able to setting on one that was rectangular in shape.  I think next time I will bake my own cookies and make them to fit perfectly in my pan.

I've just prepared this and it's in the refrigerator. I found the assembly instructions confusing. At first I put six cookies on the pan bottom and stood others around the pan's edge. But I could then see the dessert would be less than an inch deep in the center, with the tall rim of cookies, so I removed those around the edge and used them as more layers. Still I didn't have as many layers as pictured. I have to take this to a gourmet club's Oktoberfest dinner tomorrow.

I’m pretty sure we used Bahlsen cookies and Schmalz (palmin) I don’t remember the Rum but that can only be good.
