I made this pie for Christmas dinners and no one ate it.  The filling turned brown after cooking and had no taste.  It is the first time I've had to throw away 2 pies.

My mother and grandmother  made this pie when I was growing up in '50's-60's. I was pleased that it turned out like I remember. Mom did not add ground pecans to meringue but I did add far less than the 1/4 cup recommended. The double broiler and "pinch of salt" told me it was probably as old as my mom's recipe. I didn't have a double broiler but put a stainless steel mixing bowl over a slightly bigger  sauce/dutch oven type pot with boiling water. I chopped in a  small processor the pecans for the filling a little coarser than what I would consider "ground pecans" would be. I wanted some chopped pecan pieces big enough to chew like I remembered.  Next time I will not make the filling as thick as I did this time but it was still raved over.  I doubled the recipe and the picture is of the second one that spent the night in the frig that shrunk the meringue a bit.  Will definitely make it again... will have too. Ha Ha

I think this recipe was written wrong, I would suggest baking the pie & shell 1st ,about 15-20 minutes BEFORE adding the second meringue layer.  Also this pie is lacking in flavor, I would (and did) add Nutmeg to the cream filling.
