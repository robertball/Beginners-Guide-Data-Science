Loved this pie! I used a deep dish pie shell & poured all the filling in one shell, I halved the meringue ingredients & I did use 1 & 1/2 cups of blueberries but I think that needs to be decreased by half a cup. Next time I may try using frozen blueberries ... I think the fresh had a little more crunch than they ideally should. I garnished w/ a bed of crushed lemon drop candies, a tiny sprig of mint & several blueberries. Beautiful & yummy!

This is a wonderful recipe!  It is quick and very easy to make as well as delicious.  Two suggestions I have are to double the filling recipe,(one batch of meringue is plenty) and to chill the pies well before eating so they have a chance to set.  It definitely a recipe I will use again and again!

This recipe only makes one pie, not two, (the meringue is for two) but my what a pie it makes.  I've had wonderful comments on it.  I use a graham cracker crust for an extra crispy foundation.

After reading other reviews I decided to only make one pie.  I like more filling in mine.  It came together so easily and beautifully!  The flavor is great but the filling is a little sweet.  Next time I think I'll mix a block of cream cheese in with the lemon and blueberries to cut down on the sweetness.

Tasty pie, but this could have used a little more lemon flavor and a lot more filling. I made one pie, but should have used the whole filling recipe as there just wasn't much of it. I did enjoy the snap of the fresh blueberries in the filling.

Couldn't taste the lemon at all, not even after adding lemon zest and more juice, i like the blueberry lemon "custard" pie better!

This did not set at all. Is there a step missing when the filling is cooked somehow? I ended up with a liquid runny mess. Tastes good. Might reattempt and try to resolve the liquid issue, but man, that was unfortunate.

This pie was pretty gross! The filling was not good. I think if I made a traditional lemon meringue pie filling and added blueberries it would be much better.

Good recipe, I did make a couple of changes and it worked out great for me. This is one I will keep.I added some lemon zest and doubled the amount of lemon juice called for in the recipe and only made one pie instead of two pies. My husband said it was a keeper and coming from him that is great!!!!!

I also changed a few things. 1st I did use the deep dish pie shell 2nd I did not make the meringue, I find it too rich for my taste 3rdsince I also took another users idea and mixed a brick of cream cheese in with my milk 4th I used the above filling part for one deep dish pie.

I made one pie as directed and one with my changes. The original was a hit as usual and my new version was equally a hit. I personal will make my version again due to the fact that it is easier, cooler in the summer time with the cool whip and it sets up much better. The original is sort of runny to me after the 1st slice. Either way it's an easy great refreshing pie!
