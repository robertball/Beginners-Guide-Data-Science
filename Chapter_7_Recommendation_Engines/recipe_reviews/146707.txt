Thank you, thank you, thank you for this recipe!  I made a couple of changes after reading the reviews; vanilla instead of water, 2 egg whites and 1/2 white sugar and 1/2 brown sugar.  My father loves pecans and I served this at his 60th birthday party.  So many people asked me for this recipe I lost count after a while.  Absolutely delicious and addiciting!

I changed this just a little and they are now my favorite nuts. In place of the white sugar, I used brown sugar. I also add a small amount of cumin and cayenne pepper.

A+ I tested this recipe a number of times.  They are wonderfully sweet and adicting as is. A few changes I made: replace the water with vanilla as already suggested; use the called amount salt in the mix, and add an even sprinkle of seasoned salt to each batch and stir before baking. This makes for a "sweet and salty" pecan that is hard to close your mouth to.

These were good.  They did need some modifications.  I used 2 egg whites, half white sugar half brown, and also added vanilla.

This recipe is amazing!  The cinnamon sugar just made a nice coating on the outside of the nuts.  I'm sure you could use peanuts or cashews for this recipe also.  I made it with pre-roasted pecans, and it was just phenominal!  This is a must try recipe!

ADDICTING!!!! These are SO good... I used 1/4 cup white sugar and 1/4 cup brown sugar. I ended up using 2 egg whites and 2 tbs water. Try these as a salad topper in place of crutons.. you won't regret it!!!
Thanks for a great recipe!

Wonderful treat just like at the fair. I did tweak as recommended: sugar/br sugar, 2 egg whites, vanilla. Next time I will add more cinnamon or some cayenne for more kick. For those worried about cleanup-it was as easy as cleaning up after cookies...no worries!

Excellent and delicious  I've made this twice (using 2 egg whites and vanilla in place of water) with some allspice and cumin thrown in.  Then I tossed it in with a fresh fruit salad - this recipe takes plain fruit salad to another level.  Using the cumin in the recipe, it gives the fruit salad an exotic, complicated flavor.

OH MY GOODNESS!  Still in the process of making these, but had to taste a sample!  SO glad I did! They are indeed toooo yummy!  These will surely make wonderful gifts at this time of year.   I, too, doubled the egg white and split the sugars w/ brown and white.  I also split the flavorings...half vanilla and half almond (instead of water) and added a bit more cinnamon.  Delish!  I'm making two more double batches!  Thanks for the recipe!  :)

I also used vanilla instead of water, and 1/2 white sugar and 1/2 brown sugar. I did use half walnuts and half pecans, because that's what I had on hand. Next time I will try almonds. The whole batch was gone in an hour, my future husband ate so many he had a stomach ache but they were so good he couldn't stop.lol

Excellent, a neighbor had made some so I looked up the recipe on this site with the suggestions of 1/2 sugar and br sugar and the vanilla it turned out perfectly. I then had a few co-workers sample and next thing I know they were all making it for the holidays. You can use any kind of nut, almonds are awesome. Highly recommend.

Absolutely addictive. I just made them for the first time today. It smells so good in my apartment building now. I better hide some from myself or my roomates won't get any at all.

These were sooooo good.  I did mine with the 1/2 and 1/2 sugars and a bit of cayenne pepper.  They were awesome.  I'm sure the original tastes just as great. :)

These taste delicious! The amount of egg and topping was enough for easily 3 cups of nuts, though. I should have tossed some of it out, as these ended up much more coated than I need.

I used this recipe to make pecans for a fruit salad (lettuce, craisins, apples, grapes, pecans, and a raspberry dressing) with the following changes: replaced the water with vanilla extract, omitted the cinnamon, and halved the sugar. They worked great with my salad without being too sweet!

These are absolutely delicious.  I've made them by the recipe and they are great.  Having made them a few times I've made a few adjustments to suit my tastes.  I use 1/2 white sugar and 1/2 brown sugar.  After mixing the pecans with the sugar mixture in a plastic bag and spreading them out on my sheet pan, I sprinkle them with a little additional coarse salt.  Can't beat the salty sweet combination!!!

these were good, but I wish they were a little more flavorful.  I used about 1/3 white sugar, I'd use all brown sugar next time.  If I were to make them again, I'd add more salt and might try the spices suggested by another reviewer.

I used  mixed nuts w/out peanuts & 1/2 white and brown sugar and fresh cracked black pepper ( only) and bagged up in indiviual bags to each I  added dried cranberries. Bought similar at Costco and wanted to try it at home. Turned out very good. Thank you so much for sharing the master recipe.

OMG! OMGoodness! Scrumptious! I sprinkled vanilla extract over the pecans halfway through the roasting.  The vanilla extract added more flavor!  I also roasted them a little longer than an hour (about one hour/twenty mintues) to really get that roasted flavor locked in. I will definitely have to roast more tomorrow! Pecans are my favorite nut!

This was so delicious and easy! I didn't make any variations and it still tasted great, but I did put about a half cup more pecans.

These were awesome. I made the suggested changes below and added more seasoning and cut the recipe in half as I didn't have enough pecans. But I served these at x-mas and they were gone before I brought out the first appetizer. People were actually asking me for the recipe. It was awesome... thanks for making me look good in front of the family. I scored major cooking points that night :)

These were easy, delicious, and exactly what I was looking for. I made these with walnuts since pecans aren't available where I am and they were perfect.

I tried this recipe for the first time, heeding the comments below and they were excellent. Vanilla instead of water.. half brown half white sugar, a pinch of cayenne for that tingle on the tongue. The aroma was wonderful in the house.. brought some to my neighbors and they devoured them. I will make these for Christmas next week and start the new tradition!  It helps that I have 2 huge pecan trees in the yard to work from!  Thank you!

These were soooo good.  After reading the other reviews I used 2 egg whites, vanilla instead of water, brown sugar instead of white and added a pinch of cayenne.  I also used a mix of pecans, almonds and cashews. I did use more nuts than called for and upped coating amts some to accommodate that and as such did follow one reviewers advice and baked them a little longer, 1 hr 20min as at 1 hour the coating just seemed to need a little more time yet.  My husband went crazy over them.

This was a HUGE hit! I took some liberties and added bacon though. I cooked thick cut bacon on the stove, chopped it up and tossed it with the pecans once they were done. I used an equal amount of bacon and pecans, but I'm sure it is easily adjusted. This will be served at all of my future parties!

This recipe is absolutely delicious. My dad loves these. My family isn't too big of a fan on cinnamon, so using only 1 teaspoon of cinnamon works too. Also, if you like honey toasted pecans, then use this recipe, but substitute the egg and water for 1/3 cup of honey. They are delicious.

Seriously good! I made this over the weekend, and it came out fragrant and flavorful. We're  surprising family with the snack later this week. The biggest problem will be not snacking on them before we travel!  I followed the recipe almost exactly. I used liquid egg whites and used 3/4 of the sugar called for. You don't miss it and, I think, you end up with a more nutty flavor. I'll definitely make this again!

Instead of sugar, I like to use two tablespoons of natural honey. I also added 2 tbsp of melted butter in with the egg white after beating. I barely sprinked it with sea salt and Saigon cinnamon before cooking.

I made this recipe 9 times one Christmas. The reviews are spot on. I too made the changes many other reviewers made. I used 1/4  C. Dark brown sugar & 1/4 C. Sugar in the Raw.( my grown daughters tweek) I too use vanilla insteàd of water.  I also use   1  1/4 C. Walnuts & 1  1/4 C. Pecans.  All pecans are GREAT in this recipe. However I use half walnuts B/C they are far less expensive AND healthier .. I also do a diabetic version, as another reviewer  did I(we)  use splenda and splenda brown sugar. Actually that version is my favorite.
Wonderful as a gift.,on salads and healthy snacking...one after another and another....WOW.

These were absolutely amazing and so easy it's unreal.  I made one batch that my hubby and girls devoured and wanted to know when I was making more.  Then the guys I work with tried them with the same response.  Needless to say I ended up making about 10 pounds worth this past December.

I changed it to make it more  low carb/ keto version.  I substituted Golden Monkfruit instead of sugar.  It was great.  I tasted after 45 min and sprinkled a little more sweetener on and then roasted again.

They are awesome! I modified it to make it more diabetic friendly and used stevia instead of sugar 1-1 change. Awesome treat that does almost nothing to my glucose!

These look delicious and I will be making them this weekend!  

On a side note, it would be nice to read reviews based on the original recipe that was submitted and not based on all the modifications it seems folks feel the need to share (yes, I am aware that there is such a prompt suggested at the beginning of the review).

I have now made it 4 times to perfect it in my opinion and these are my recommendations from the original recipe:
Definitely replace the water with Vanilla
Definitely use 1/2 sugar and 1/2 brown sugar 
Do Not over heat the oven.   If you want crispier nuts, use a 250 degree oven, for less crispy use 225.
Stir for sure every 15 minutes.
Everything else was fine and these are addictive!   Enjoy!

I did add a bit of Cayenne to the mix as some suggested...next time just a pinch or two instead of a few pinches or more ;-)    Delicious!

These are so good! I followed the many other reviews and substituted the water for vanilla extract. I also did 1/4 c brown sugar and 1/4 c white sugar instead of 1/2 c white sugar. They turned out exactly how I imagined. They remind me of the ones I would buy at a carnival.

I may have used more pecans than the recipe called for...2 qt sized bags, but it's probably better for those who are diabetic or can't have salt. you can still taste the candied coating. they're just not super coated.

I needed something fairly nutritious as a snack for the holidays, and this recipe fit the bill. I had the ingredients on hand, it was easy to make, the fragrance as the pecans toasted, and the crunchy sweetness all made this a five-star winner. The recipe went into my holiday binder and I will definitely stock up on pecans to make this again next year.

I cut the white sugar to 3/4 cup, but could have used 1/2 C and been better. I was hoping for more of a glaze, but overall they are great. I added a little vanilla to eggwhite/water, and that was perfect. I made both pecans and a batch of almonds (the almonds taste like the ones in the little pink bags at Magic Kingdom!

No changes made...no changes needed!  These are great. Not too sweet and just right. I've tried some of the other modifications but they seem heavy and I'm a big natural vanilla fan.
