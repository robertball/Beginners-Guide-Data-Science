Instead of flouring them since many people complained it fell off while cooking, I just tossed the scallops directly in the seasonings.  Instead of garnishing with Parmesan cheese, I added it to the seasonings.  To make sure your scallops don't get tough, undercook the first bunch so they don't overcook in the oven while waiting for the second batch to cook.  I added wine and butter to the pan juices to make a lovely sauce.  I served it all over fettunci.

The flour mix totally fell off in the oil. What did stick was not crispy but soggy. Next time I'll try to use the flour mixture on the scallops but maybe bake or broil them. *Update* I've tried this a couple dif ways and have had great success. First, leave out the flour-you don't need it. I put all the seasonings in a ziploc bag with enough olive oil and lemon juice to make a marinade. I used the seasonings called for plus, minced garlic, garlic powder, onion powder, parmesan cheese and old bay seasoning. Just put whatever amount looks good to you in the bag. Marinate it for several hours in the fridge, turning occasionally. I broiled the scallops, about 5 min per side and I tried some more in a nonstick pan with Pam instead of oil over med heat. Both ways turned out great! Just don't overload your pan in the oven or on top. I only cooked 8 or 10 at a time in a 9 x 13 foil covered dish sprayed with Pam and probably the same amount on the stove. I did get a little smoke in the oven towards the end but that was from the scorching juices and reuse of the same foil. I'm sure if you used fresh foil you wouldn't have a problem. I just threw away the foil! No mess at all! These have been scrumptious! I cooked the rest of my shrimp the same way. Even better! They are the huge 13-15 count that I found on sale at a local supermarket. They are the kind that come with the shell on but have been deveined so it is cut on the back and really easy to take off. Very nice and meaty texture.

My husband loved this.   After cooking the scallops and setting them aside, I mixed a 1/2 cup of wine in with the lemon juice and parsley and added it to the juices left in the pan.  I then added 2 tablespoons of butter and a tiny bit of the flour mixture.  I let it reduce and thicken.  I spread rice on a platter, put the scallops on top, and drizzled on the wine mixture.  It was delicious and very pretty.

Delicious!  I followed some suggestions on here and had a fantastic, restaurant quality dinner.  I added parmesan to the mix, and did not have lemon pepper.  I added lemon juice to the olive oil I cooked them in on the stovetop instead.  I "breaded" the scallops in a ziplock, which was perfect to coat them, but not cake them up.  By placing the scallops in the pan and really letting them get toasty before manually turning them, I got a beautiful browned effect with the perfect cooked texture.

I also added in some butter and white wine after I took out the scallops to make a delicious sauce.  I served them in a pool of sauce with some French peasant bread slices and a green salad.  It was sooo good!

Only average, even after adjusting the herbs to our liking.  If a person was to use the amount of herbs and lemon pepper recommended I think they'd be very disappointed as it would be overpowering.  Also, scallops should be seared over medium high heat, not high heat.  Once they crust and release themselves from the surface of the pan, in about a minute or two, turn and finish on the other side for another minute or two.  Finally, using oregano and thyme on scallops was an experiment for me out of curiosity, but now that we've tried them we know oregano and thyme is not the best choice for the delicately flavored scallops.

This is a very simple and delicous recipie in which to prepare Sea Scallops. Be careful with the lemon pepper however as it is overpowering if you use the reccomended amount in the recipie. I reduced the amount by more than half and was very pleased with the results. Serve with a pasta dish...YUM!

This is THE BEST scallops recipe.  The most important thing about scallops is to get them as dry as possible before searing.  I defrosted mine, then placed them on top of 3 paper towels, and wrapped them with a couple of kitchen towels.  After an hour or so, I then put the flour and seasonings into a Ziploc bag, and shook about 1/3 of the scallops at a time.  The frying pan I used is a ceramic-lined Cuisinart frying pan - it's really important to have a good non-stick pan.  I heated the olive oil until very hot, then placed some of the scallops into it, being sure to leave some breathing room between scallops.  When those were nice and brown on each side, I took them out and placed them on a plate.  I then seared the 2nd and 3rd batches the same way.  When all of the scallops were seared, I poured about 1/3 cup of white wine into the pan, then 1/4 cup of butter and some lemon juice.  After pouring that delicious sauce over the scallops, I served them over fettuccine.  We sopped up the rest of the juices with some ciabatta roles.  Fantastic!!!

This tasted sooooo delicious, my whole family couldn't get enough of it!!! Would make a great appetizer at my next party! I sprinkled parmesan cheese over it at the end, and that was yummy. Sweet and succulent. Squeeze with a small squirt of lemon/lime for that extra zing of flavor (it will make a difference, trust me!) YUUUUMMMMMMMYYYYY!!!!! Definitely make this!

This was very easy and good for the first time I've ever cooked with scallops. I didn't have lemon pepper, so I soaked the scallops in lemon juice, used regular pepper in the coating mix. I also added Old Bay as someone else suggested. I think this would be a hard recipe to screw up, as long as you don't overcook the scallops. They cook so fast.

My family really liked this. I served it with scalloped potatoes and wild green salad with walnuts, blue cheese crumbles and raspberry vinagrette. Very fancy but easy. I'll make this again. (PS- My 4 year old and 18 month old even liked them).

These came out just fine.  The seasoning I felt might have been too much with all the lemon pepper but it was not.  Nicely seasoned.  I did take some garlic and cook it in the olive oil for a short bit just to get the flavor out of the garlic.  I discarded most of the garlic but the olive/garlic oil that was left was fine for cooking the scallops.  This will be a favorite in my home.  Served it with a strip steak and grilled asparagus.  Nicely done.

Simply terrific.  I added a little garlic powder to the recipe, also.  I pan fried the scallops so they were browned and then put them in the oven to cook them through.  I'm going to try this recipe with other fish also.  Thanks for a keeper.

I used tarragon instead of the oregano and thyme, because it is much more subtle. I think it's also a better fit with the delicate flavors of shellfish. The folks who've had trouble with the flour getting soggy and falling off may have been using scallops that have water added. They release it as soon as they hit the pan. It's important to check the label when you buy frozen ones, and look out for clumps of ice in the bag or excessive frost on the scallops. They should look relatively dry, with no opaque edges that indicate frost burn. Icy clumps not only indicate that water was added, but that they probably thawed at some point and were re-frozen.That's always the case if you see frost burn. Thawing and re-freezing always mean less flavor and a shorter life in you freezer.  Someone mentioned using sea scallops instead of bay, and I agree. If you buy them fresh they should look solid, firm, and somewhat dry-not watery and flaccid. Ask the clerk if water has been added. I think buying fresh is better because you can see the condition of the meat. It's hard to judge that when they're frozen. But I've had great, flavorful (and dry!) frozen scallops too. Hope this helps!

Like a previous reviewer, I didn't coat my scallops in flour.  I just mixed the seasonings in a bowl and tossed the scallops in the bowl to coat.  I did add a tablespoon of garlic powder to the mixture because we love garlic.  Seared the scallops on medium high heat, turning them once.  I didn't do mine in batches, but put all of them in at the same time.  At the end of cooking, I deglazed the pan with some white wine , lemon juice, and a bit a butter. I boiled the sauce until thickened and poured it over the scallops.  I served it with rice pilaf and a salad.  Delicious

We did not like this at all. The flour coating created a consistency with the scallop that we did not like and the seasoning overpowered the taste of the scallops.  Next time I will just try with the herbs and regular salt and pepper and finish with the lemon juice and leave the rest of it out.

We love these scallops.  I use only 1/3 c. of flour and add parmesan cheese and garlic powder to the mix.  We like them with mashed potatoes.

Fabulous! My coating stayed on. Not sure if it helped, but after coating them I put them in the fridge for a couple of hours before cooking.

LOVED this recipe. I had NO PROBLEM with this being soggy as others have written. The secret is leave space between the scallops when pan frying. I used a large electric fry pan. I was able to cook all at once.  Served over angel. I am going to make this a regular. I will try as a salad next time. Yum! I did find that shaking scallops in plastic bag (as suggested by another) to coat worked out well. Thank you for a great recipe.

This recipe was good, tweaked a bit.  No flour, the scallops were so sweet and firm I didn't think flour was  necessary. Half the salt and half the lemon pepper. I also pan seared them all, put on plate and made a sauce with the lemon juice and added some wine to de glaze the pan. Put them back in the pan for a minute and dinner was done.

I used Old Bay instead of Season Salt.  Deglaze with white wine and finish with butter.  Make small batches if making more than one recipe -- to avoid excess buildup of flour in the pan (results in gummy sauces).

Very good.  I didnt use the flour either.  It did need a light sauce though... I recommend pairing with a pasta that has a light creamy sauce to use with these scallops.

Pretty good. Hubby said it's the best I've ever made. I don't have lemon pepper and I put all scallops in. I also add in 2 tbs of butter to the olive oil, but then you need to watch those more closely. Needs at least 4 minutes on each side.

I made this recipe last night, and they were delicious!  I cooked them a bit longer, and they still were a little under done, so will cook them 3 minutes per side next time.  The spices to coat were delicious, and the lemon and parsley was the perfect touch.  I recommend this recipe highly, and my husband does also!

I thought it was a bit salty, but the texture was wonderful! Used a melted butter and lemon as a sauce.

This was okay, but the crust was awfully salty. I really think I prefer the scallops to be marinated in some olive oil and salt and pepper and then seared without the flour coating. The sauce was good, though (I followed other recommendations to add white wine to deglace the pan and then add the lemon juice and parsley allow it to reduce).

Excellent - we devoured the scallops!  I did not have seasoning salt so I used regular salt, and I did not have lemon pepper so I put in about 1 tsp regular pepper and I put in half tsp pepper blend (sezuhan style).  There's so much flour in the mix that I did not find that overwhelming at all, so just use something you have on hand to give it a little zing.  Bang any excess flour off the scallops, after you roll them.  You should not have so much on there that they could possibly become soggy. I cooked the scallops on medium heat until they were lightly browned on both sides.  I drizzled some lemon juice on top (don't care for parsley on scallops) and they were fantastic.  Thank you for the recipe!

These are the best scallops my husband has ever had.  We will never order scallops in a restatant when I can easily make these at home.

Quick and easy - even for someone like me who doesn't cook much. I followed the original recipe, but I think reducing the lemon pepper as others have done would be a good idea. I also wish I hadn't tossed them with all of the parsley and lemon juice at once - ended up a bit too lemony. Overall very good though.

I thought it was pretty good.  I didn't have lemon pepper in the house, so I just put in some regular pepper, and I thought it was yummy.

This was a really good dish! One very important step that isn't mentioned in the recipe is to pat dry the scallops with a paper towel before coating them with the flour mixture. Otherwise too much flour sticks to the scallops and ends up falling off in your oil when cooking.
I did not have any lemon pepper so I used 1 tbsp white pepper and grated my lemon into the mixture before juicing it. The results were fantastic!

The recipe is good.  Dont cook on High for 2 minutes though.  They will not cook thoroughly and will burn the outside.  Cook on Med High

This recipe is great!  After washing the scallops, blot them dry with a paper towel.  Toss them in the flour mixture to get a light coating them place them in the hot pan.  When you flip the scallops, don't put them in the same place.  Move them to a part of the pan that hasn't been cooked on yet (it's hotter and will sear the scallops better - a trick I read in Ad Hoc).  2 minutes on each side was perfect!  I will definitely make them again!

This recipe is a good way to cover the delicate, delicious flavor of sea scallops. I had a couple pounds of jumbo Alaskan sea scallops and used this recipe, really disappointed in it.  This would be fine for a stronger tasting fish.  A little olive oil, butter, garlic, salt and pepper is all that you need to do a wonderful seared sea scallop.

This was really good but you need to let the pan come up to the proper heat before you add the scallops. There's a smidge too much dried oregano. Oh, and if you swirled a bit of butter into the pan juices & added the lemon juice to that, you'd have a delicious sauce. :o)

The seasonings in the flour were great, the directions were clear and everything had great flavor. This may be common knowledge to you all but if you're thinking of trying this with a shoddy pan, one which doesn't heat evenly, you will be super disappointed. I knew I shouldn't have attempted it but I ADORE scallops and wanted to make them this way at home as I think the natural flavor comes through more than baking/stir frying. The problem is you don't move these around like your stir frying and the scallops are more delicate/floured unlike the meats you may brown/sear in the pan, so you NEED a heavy bottom which heats evenly. My pan is super-thin and not stainless, nor completely flat anymore. I ended up with about half my scallops in various stages of browning/burning, I threw them all in a baking dish with some melted butter and white wine poured over and managed to cook/overcook them by baking. I will try this again when I set enough aside for an All-clad or my Le Creuset.

Two minutes each side burned one of my sides on high. I would say medium high heat is better.

This is a nice, easy way to prepare scallops.  I liked the seared herb crust.  I used super fine flour for gravy and added a little butter to the pan with the evoo.  Delicious!  Topped with some scampi sauce.  Thanks for sharing.

We made thse for Valentines day and absolutly loved them. The flour creates this really delicate crust. We bought thick (approx 2-3") scallops so we seared for 4 minutes each side. They were cooked perfectly! We made filets, lobster, sea bass and scallops.....the scallops were everyones favorite.

followed advise to toss ingrediants in bag including parmesan cheese and added about 1/4 cup of white wine to the pan. cooked quickly to sear and give the carmelized color, but not overdone to avoid rubbery scallops.  Beautiful and tasted great!

I am not sure what to say. I just did not care for these at all. Two tablespoons of lemon pepper was too much. After two scallops, I wiped all the seasoning off. Even my husband who eats just about anything did not have much to say. Said they were "Good" and left it at that. Normally, he raves through out the whole meal.

These were just OK as far as scallops go. They made a huge mess on my cooktop. I would suggest using a stockpot to sear them in to prevent the spatter from coating your cooking area. Since you only cook 4 at a time, the high sides won't get in your way.

Love these but I made one major change when I make them. I make the seasoning exactly as outlined, sear them exactly as recipe calls for too but at the end, once they are browned, I pour orange juice over them in the pan and let boil to a reduction. Adds a little natural sauce and a meal that isn't made with butter!! Love them!! (Other hint is that I let the olive oil get REALLY hot before throwing the scallops in and I throw them all in one pan vs the 4 at a time bit).

I followed previous suggestions by omitting the flour.  I marinated the scallops for 3 hours wiht italian seasoning, garlic powder, olive oil and lemon juice before searing.  I also deglazed the pan with white wine and poured over the scallops when serving.  I am normally not a scallop eater but these disappeared off of everyones plate.

Pretty tasty. I omited the lemon pepper and added some much needed garlic.   Scallop cooking tip (from my chef friend) - Since most of us overcook the first side, cut the cooking time on the other side in half. This will give you moist, delicious scallops every time!

Very good, a little too peppery for my husband. I used Bay seasoning as the seasoning salt. Instead of lemon pepper, I dipped the scallops in lemon juice before dipping them in the flour mixture. I liked the crust on the outside, and it was great the next day, too.

The flavor is very light and subtle. I suggest sauteing the curry and ginger with the garlic to bring out the flavor more - then adding the vegetables.

These were quite good! I patted my scallops dry w/ a paper towel so I would only get a light coating of flour & avoid clumping. I used Old Bay instead of salt & I think next time I will increase the herbs just a bit. For me, the parmesan isn't optional...it's a must! Without it, I think these do need a light sauce...the wine & lemon juice is a good idea. I served these w/ zuchinni batons (from food network), a fresh salad w/ vidalia onion vinaigrette & lemon syllabub (from this site) for dessert. Thank you Chris for your contribution to a wonderful meal!

Delicious.  I rarely get the chance to have sea scallops and I love them.  This recipe is amazing.  Simple and easy.  I did follow the advice of another reviewer and added some lemon juice and white wine to make a simple sauce. A keeper, thanks for the post.

I thought these were awesome. I only made 4 very large scallops to accompany to filet mignions. I served them w/ fresh lemon. I had no issues with the flour making them soggy.

My husband loved this recipe.  I sliced 4 cloves of garlic and added about a teaspoon of butter to the olive oil and lightly toasted the garlic.   I removed the garlic and set it aside and then fried the scallops.  When the scallpos were down, I added the lemon juice and parsley to the pan with the drippings and added the sliced toasted garlic. Then I dizzled the sauce over the scallops.  Delicious!!

Great recipe! I did use less flour and added garlic & parmesian as other readers did.  I also used the lemon juice to deglace pan and poured juices over the finished scallops.  YUM!

Both my husband and I loved this recipe.  I used less flour than called for and mixed the parmesan in with the coating mixture as others suggested.  The dish was very light and delicious!

SUPER easy and SUPER good.  My husband came home with a pound of dry sea scallops and wanted a nice, light prep for them - this definitely fit the bill.  It's mild, simple, and doesn't obscure the taste of the scallops too much.  One of the few "perfect!" reviews from his very picky tummy.  My only comment is that I ended up with a lot of extra flour/seasoning mix - you could probably cut this recipe down by half, or possibly even down to a quarter the original measurements, and still have enough.

I just made these last night and my fiance loved it! I added the flour like the recipe said but just didn't add as much. At most I put a tablespoon and Half. That amount was perfect, nothing clumped up or fell off. I do know that the flour helped it sear. My only issue and this may be my own fault. My oil was WAY to hot although I read online that it should be very hot. The oil splattered every where and made a huge mess. So net time I will tone the oil down. The scallops were perfectly cooked but were a tad salty to me, although my fiance went crazy over it. So really it just depends on what you like. All in all, thise recipe was delicous, he said it was his favorite meal. I paired it with asparagus and garlic angel hair pasta.

I think this is a good  base recipe.  I agree with other users the amount seasoning salt and the lemon pepper should be decreased.  I added some garlic powder.  Next time I think I will add even more.  I served it over garlic fried rice.  I had no problem witht he flour coating coming off.  I did cook the scallops in half butter and half evoo. yummy

To keep the crust on, try double sifted flour, works great (try on chicken too). Makes a nice fine crust.  Also try adding a little butter to the oil, they will brown faster.  I used lemon flavored pasta to change it up.  This is always a favorite!

This was very easy to make and quite tasty. I didn't have any lemon juice, and I added a few squirts of spray butter to the scallops before I rolled them in the flour. My only complaint is that they were a little 'watery'. I put them on a paper towel to soak up the water and it helped a lot. I'll definitely make them again.

Best Scollops EVER!!! But we modified it some...  Adjusted for 2 servings using 6 sea scallops; hubby quote "best scallops I've ever had in my WHOLE life".  We didn't have lemon pepper (OH! NO!) so we modified it to 1/2 tsp dried lemon peel and 1/2 tsp finely ground black pepper.  Added 1 tsp garlic herb Old Bay seasoinng  Did not use lemon juice at all.  Also, we found cooking them on high heat using an electric stove was too high; suggest cooking an a mediam high temp insteaed (7 or 8) if using an electric stove.  Finished scallops off with a sprinlke of grated parm. cheese, chopped fresh parsley, and a dash of Old Bay garlic herb seasoning.   Scallops were olden brown and VERY flavorful.

Added paprika, ginger powder, and garlic powder to the flour mix. Was awesome! But make sure you don't put too much lemon juice in the end coz your scallops will be a little soggy. Will definitely make this again!

I did not use flour either on this recipe. It was very very good! I cooked it for my boyfriend, and he loved it! He said it was exstacy in his mouth! I marinated the scallops for 3 hours in all spices called for plus onion powder, garlic powder and enough oil to constitute a marinade. I fried them in a pan over medium heat. I had a rough time making the sauce after cooking the scallops, does anyone have any suggestions on making it better?

I was afraid to try this recipe because some reviewers said the flour fell off while cooking.   I rinsed and drained the scallops but also patted them dry..that is the key!  I dusted them in the flour mixture and put it in very hot oil.  The flour did not fall off.  The recipe is very yummy.  I will make it for my guests next week.  I hope the scallops are on sale though...They are very expensive but they were worth it!  Love this recipe.

I made these for my brother, who was in town, and he LOVED them!  I liked them a lot, too, but thought 2T lemon pepper made them too lemony (and that was w/o the lemon juice suggested at the end).  So, will definitely make these again - probably cook a little longer than 2min each side...possibly 3min each side depending on how thick the scallops are...and will cut the lemon pepper down to 1 T.

PERFECT! I did not use the flour, and it was still perfect. The high cooking temp and the seasonings make it a bit crunchy on the outside. Lovely!

This is a good recipe. My entire family enjoyed it. I followed it exactly as written. The next time that I make this I will change the following: 1) Instead of cooking on high heat, I will cook on medium high heat.  The pan became too hot and almost burned the outside of the scallop.  2) I will omit the flour because it kept falling off as I ate the scallops. I do not think the flour is necessary.

This was very good. It made a nice crust on the outside. We had a mushroom creamy pasta on the side and that was a perfect combination. We'll definitely make again.

Wonderful. Did as others suggested and marinated scallops for a few hours in the frig. Sauteed scallops for a few minutes on each side and removed from pan. Deglazed the pan with white wine and added baby portabello mushrooms and 1 T. of butter. Served scallops along side angel hair pasta with mushroom sauce. The best!!

Really good flavor but the coating completely fell off the scallops.  I will take other reviewers advice and skip the flour next time and add some parmesan cheese too.  Quick and easy!

I love this, I use the flour but try to use very little, w/ me it's more of a "dusting" than a "caking". I like a lot of flavor so I increased the spices.

These are so great! Good for a low calorie diet, too. My only problem was the sodium amount from the seasoning salt. Usually, I omit this and use some other spice like paprika or Mrs. Dash - Salt Free. Also, I sub the regular flour for whole wheat flour for a little more fiber.

Ok,so I tried to make this with bay scallops instead of sea scallops. Didn't come out a disaster,still a great flavor, but I wouldn't recommend it. I used bread crumbs instead of flour and these came out delish. I also sprinkled a little parmesean on top when done.

Good but the flour from the scallops burnt in the pan between batches, making a smoky, messy, unsightly meal.  Not a good first-time prep option for guests.

This is a very good recipe but not quite five stars. I like my wife's recipe better... I don't know how she fixes hers but she coats them in something? and bakes in the oven.

This recipe was great!  My boyfriend was very impressed!  The recipe doesn't tell you what to do with the lemon juice and fresh parsley, so I just drizzled it over the scallops while they were in the oven, while I finished the rest of the meal.  I will make this recipe again and again.

Good spice combination but some of the scallops were not thoroughly cooked and the burning oil & flour caused my smoke detector to go off!  Perhaps my kitchen is not built for pan-searing ...

I have tried many scallop recipes, this one is my favorite.  They were absolutely perfect!  We didn't have fresh parsley so we used the dried stuff.  These were as good as you would get in a top restaurant!  Thanks for sharing chef!

Way too much lemon juice!  Scallops have a sweet, delicate flavor and do not need to be masked by lemon juice.  I liked the cooking method, but will use a different seasoning next time.

This recipe is fantastic!  Quick, easy, and tasty.  I do have two suggestions.  First, to avoid waste, cut all dry ingredients in half.  Second, as a tweak, substitute OLD BAY for Season Salt.  Will be making this again, and again, and again!

I used this as a guide only. Too much salt and lemon pepper. I used Slap-Yo-Mamma seasoning from New Orleans - 1/2 tsp plus 1/2 tsp lemon pepper plus flour 1/4 cup and 1/4 cup Panko all in a ziplok to dust the scallops. Seared them in 1/2 olive oil and 1/2 butter. deglazed the pan with white wine to serve over the yummy scallops. This I served with a brown rice pilaf (Mushrooms/onions) cooked in broth.  A wonderful meal served with arugula and orange salad.

Good recipe!  I followed the other suggestions, and omitted the flour, but I also added ~1/4 tsp cayenne, cut the oil by 1/2,  omitted the lemon juice and served with long grain & wild rice.

delicious, when they don't get soggy. I have made this recipe successfully and, more often, unsuccessfully.  Too inconsistent to rate 5 stars. I don't know...maybe it is the scallops themselves that are inconsistent. May never know.

The ingredient portions are way off and the flour just turns to soup. a 1/2 cup of flour with only, what, 3 teaspoons worth of seasonings? Everything just gets lost in there. Im no BobbyFlay but I'm not a bad cook either. And a previous reviewing is correct, thyme and oregano is a wierd combo.My guy was telling me not to try this one and should have listened.

made these scallops tonight along side a nice green salad and fresh corn on the cob. the only thing  i changed as i didnt have any one hand was the lemon pepper i used garlic seasoning instead and replaced olive oil with  Avocado oil infused with lemon turned out very nice did have two cook an extra 2 minutes as they were too raw on the inside for me but over all very good will make again

These were great, but the breading was a little much, and got soggy if they sat in the oven too long waiting for others to cook.  Great flavor, but not as good as a perfectly cooked unbreaded scallop with a nice crispy sear.

The best scallops ever.  I followed the recipe as written with the exception of adding the cheese to the flour mixture.  I made sure the scallops were dry and just dropped them in a baggie and tossed.  Thank you for the post.

Love this recipe. I have made this several times but have never wrote a review. When I spend the money on big scallops I only make them this way. I love to finish this with a spray of truffle oil spray before serving these. Wonderful! Now I have to go make these again.

My husband did the actual frying with these, but I made up the coating and got them ready to fry.  I took other users' advice and skipped the flour in the coating.  I also added some white wine and the lemon juice/parsley to the skillet to reduce off a nice light sauce for the scallops & pasta.  We served with fettuccine.  The scallops seemed to soak up a lot of the oil during cooking, so my husband decided to add a little more for the second round of scallops.  We made a total of about 16 large sea scallops, and had plenty of spices with the recommended mix.

I followed the user reviews and eliminated the flour all together.  I added some garlic powder to the herb mixture, and let the scallops marinate in the herbs, juice and oil for a couple of hours before cooking.  I was quite pleased with the results.  I served them topped with some grated Parmesan cheese, steamed green beans, and seasoned baked potatoes.

Awesome flavor. I also took the advice of others & did not use the flour. Didn't miss this ingredient. Scallops were very tender & flavorful. Served with lobster ravioli and oven roasted asparagus and garlic. What a dynamite Christmas dinner. Thank you.

Perfect!! Really, really good! Although, I did listen to the others and left out the flower, added some parm to the mixture. I put all the Scallops in a freezer bag and coated them.. Best Scallops I've made!

This was so good, my hubby even said so..and he usually doesn't make any comments about a dish. I used an iron skillet to give me a nice crust on the scallops! I put a little butter and white wine in the pan after removing the scallops. Served over linguine with the sauce. Very elegant and tasted rich. Will make this again.

This recipe was pretty good. As per everyone else's reviews/comments about the crust falling off in the pan, I subbed in panko (japanese bread crumbs) for the flour and dipped the scallops in egg whites before rolling them in the batter and searing them. They came out pretty tasty! I used a little white wine on them while they were in the pan- really tasty and served with lemon & lime juice. I also added parm. cheese to the batter, like one of the other reviews recommended. My only complaint is they were a tad salty- an easy thing to fix!

Excellent flavor.  I didn't cook on the stove, instead I put them under the broiler as one reviewer suggested.  I used a foil covered cookie sheet sprayed with pam.  I marinated the scallops just for 5 minutes as I was short of time.   They came out tender and full of flavor. These would be great with a touch of old bay added for heat as well.  Thanks for a great idea!

I messed w/the recipe a bit, because I can't seem to stop myself.  I'll be making this again w/slightly different modifications because in general, my husband and I both really liked it.  I used bread crumbs instead of flour to give it some extra 'crisp'.  That worked well for us...  The end flavor was a little strong on the spices for us, next time I'll spice a little lighter so I don't overpower the scallops quite so much.  Overall really good, something I'll be playing with again soon.

I tried what others did and excluded the flour.. the lemon pepper and salt was WAAY too much. it basically overpowered the scallops. I like mine with a bit of flavor but this was too overpowering for me. Will not do this again.

I think there was a little to much flour, but they're pretty good.  I added a little more lemon juice then the recipe called for.  Next time I think I'll substitute the parmesean for the flour like someone else suggested.

Delicious.  I will definitely make it again.  I just had 1/2 pound of scalloped, so I halved the spieces and more than halved the lemon pepper (I thought that sounded like too much).  I didn't have enough lemon juice, but I used about a teaspoon.  Wonderful!  Tasted like something you would eat in an expensive seafood restaurant.  This was the first time I had cooked scallops.  I can't wait to fix this recipe again.

This recipe is actually very tasty.  I thought I bought sea scallops at the store, but they turned out to be bay.  My husband really enjoyed it (he is really not a fish eater).

Very Good.  I melted butter with a squeeze of lemon and drizzled over the scallops, then sprinkled with fresh chopped parsley, that made a lovely presentation.  Served with Spinach and Potato Casserole.  Good Dinner!

We really enjoyed this recipe.  I did add some garlic powder and onion powder to the flour and only 1 teaspoon of garlic pepper.  I drizzled a little butter on serving plates and put the scallops on top of the butter then served as a side dish with steaks.

Just made this recipe for Sunday dinner to rave reviews.  Took someone else's suggestion to add garlic powder.  Scallops were delicious.  This is definately a keeper.  Will make again and again.  Thanks for a great recipe.

This was really GREAT!! My whole family loved it and wanted it again.  I took the suggestion of adding garlic powder to it, which seems to be a good addition.  It is so easy to make too!

I’ve always been afraid to cook scallops, but this recipe made it very forgiving.  We used the 2 minutes on each side as a guide.  I would do 1 min 45 seconds on each side.  Don’t be afraid to cook scallops!  This recipe is outstanding!!!

Nice concept but you’ll ruin your scallops if you follow this recipe to the letter. Stove tops are different. 2 minutes per side at high heat will substantially overcook and char your scallop. Especially if it’s been floured. The flour, herbs and seasoning salt are a nice, quick combination but need to be cut in half or all you’ll taste is lemon pepper and seasoning salt.

I also left off the breadcrumbs but I subbed grated parmesan cheese. I also added garlic powder (the same amount as the oregano and thyme). salt and pepper and a pad of butter to the olive oil. I served it over basil pesto sauce with kale spaghetti. Yum!

I made these scallops just as the recipe called for. (exceptI I live alone so it was 1/2 the recipe).  I could not get over how little effort for how delicious and satisfying the result.  Bravo

As I was leery of using olive oil at too high a heat, I likely did not have it hot enough for them to sear nicely.  The next time I will stick with vegetable oil and butter for the nice sear.

I will definitely make it again.  I expected the outside of the scallops to be a little crispier after dredging them in flour. The flavor was delicious. I would only use half as much flour as I threw at least half the flour mixture out.

Easy, good flavor. 
However, the coating didn’t stick at all and made a gooey mess in the pan.  I’m an experienced cook, but I guess I missed something on this one.

No lemon pepper, only dried parsley, but really, really sweet and tender.  My breading stayed on, key was having the olive oil very hot.

I'll probably lessen the amt of lemon pepper next time, but this is a great, simple way to make scallops. I had on top of quinoa with mango salsa. HOLY cow!

Outstanding recipe and so easy!  My husband usually orders scallops whenever he sees them on the menu at a restaurant, so I thought I'd give this recipe a try.  The pressure was on for me to prepare something that would stand up to the restaurant quality he's used to.  Success was mine! We both enjoyed our scallops from this recipe. Thank you.

I followed the recipe  as written, using a cast iron skilled for a deep, rich sear. The scallops were excellent. The pasta in the photo inspired me. I made penne to which I added broccoli florets for the last minute. As the pasta drained, I sautéed a minced clove of garlic in olive oil (in the pasta pot).  Added the pasta and broccoli with 2T fresh lemon juice, 1/4 cup of heavy cream and 1/4 cup of fresh parsley leaves and stirred until slightly thickened. Served the scallops on top. I will define to make this again.

This was excellent!  I didn't have fresh parsley, so I used some homemade parsley pesto I had in the freezer to top the scallops right before serving.  I found 2 minutes was a little too long at medium high heat, so I adjusted the time and temperature a little so as not to "blacken" them.  Will certainly make this again.

I like my scallops cooked more than the recipe called for, so I ended up with a smoky mess. There's  got to be an easier way.

Definitely a keeper.  I did not coat the scallops in flour - I simply seasoned them.  I also added a little paprika.  They were delicious!

Just made this tonight. I floured the scallops, it did not come off ( I think those who commented theirs did didn't have their pan hot enough). I used slightly different seasonings and made a piccata sauce in the pan after removing the scallops to a warming plate. Served over pilaf and green beans. Totally delicious! I paid $33 for a similar dish on Cape Cod this past summer. I'll make my own going forward thank you very much!

I followed Vorcha's suggestion and marinated the scallops then I put a pice of foil on the grill while it was getting hot which was perfect for searing!

All the breading fell off in the frying pan.  So I ended up with spoonfuls of mush. I will not be making this again.

Awesome!!!  I substituted corn starch for the flour due to a gluten intolerance.  I also used 1 tsp Old Bay seasoning in place of the seasoning salt because that is what I had.  The scallops were slightly crunchy and delicious. I think cooking them aon high is the trick to keeping them crunchy and not mushy as some reviewers mentioned.  Brush with melted butter before serving.

Made it exactly per the instructions and they turned out great. Not sure if it makes a difference, but I used a well seasoned cast iron skillet. They turned out golden brown, and with an excellent flavor. Can't wait to make this dish again. Five stars all the way.

I didn't have any trouble with the flour coating falling off or sticking to the pan. I used a mixture of olive oil and butter in a cast iron skillet. I like the suggestion of skipping the flour altogether and will try that next time, though. My husband, who seldom compliments my cooking, said "It was good." That's how I know this is a GREAT recipe!!!

This recipe is so simple and quick but so delicious! The mix of spices with the lemon juice creates amazing flavor. I added garlic because I love garlic in everything. The scallops cook best if they're not dry before the flour.

My family loves seafood and thought we'd try this recipe for a new twist, and were very disappointed. I only used 3 teaspoons of lemon pepper and thought is was still too much. I also think maybe half on the other seasonings would be enough. I also tried the Parmesan cheese and thought that it made the scallops come out gummy. Overall, just too many flavors taking away from the natural goodness of the scallop.

I am new to making scallops, but not new to this website. I trusted this to make a good dish with an expensive ingredient. I followed the recipe to a Tee, and they burned horribly -- and quickly. My whole kitchen is filled with black smoke.

I am terribly disappointed. So upset that I don't think I will ever try to make them again.

This is a great recipe and the scallops turn out just fine if you sear them properly.  I heat the olive oil on high heat with some minced garlic, but I reduce the temperature between medium and high when I add the scallops and turn them only once.  I've also prepared this dish by adding a couple of tablespoons of Old Bay to the mix, rather than seasoning salt, which gives it a nice "seafood restaurant" taste.

This came out good except its way too salty.  Next time I would not use salt at all.  Also didn't use the flour.  Ended up having to rinse the scallops and flour them and put them back on the pan.  Got rid of some of the salty taste but it was still there.  Without the salt this would have been really good.

Wonderful, simple, not overly spiced lets the scallop flavor stand out. Having the texture of crisp on the outside, but oh so tender on the inside. Definitely need to watch timing so they don't turn to rubber. Will make this regularly.

I have tried many scallop recipes and this is far and above the best.  I have to admit I think the fact there is no garlic helps because it becomes bitter so quickly in a sauté pan.  I loved it.  Thanks

I followed direcions with the exception of squirting the lemon juice afterwards, which I will definitely try next time.  The scallops were great!  I tried one right after it was done searing and it was excellent, however; the ones I put in the oven to keep warm got SOGGY!!  I was very disappointed.  Next time, I will use a bigger pan or two pans and not put them in the oven!!!  I sparayed my pan with non-stick cooking spray before I put in the olive oil and I did not have a problem with the flour mix falling off or sticking to the pan.  Can't wait to make it again!

These were very easy and tasty. I didn't have lemon pepper on hand so I used regular black pepper instead and lemon infused grapeseed oil rather than olive oil. They came out great! I also didn't have fresh parsley or lemon juice but I didn't even miss it. Next time I'll try it exactly as written as I do like lemon.

Personally, I found that the herbs and seasoning really overpowered the scallops, and I cut back a bit from what the recipe called for. The cook time was perfect though, so for my first time actually searing scallops myself the texture came out nice.

So salty!  Otherwise a good, easy recipe.  Definitely skip the salt and half the lemon pepper.. add extra lemon juice at the end!

Great recipe! Also very easy and fast to do. I served the scallops on top of linguini and i put the parsley, lemon juice, and one table spoon of olive oil all over. The presentation is great with the scallops surrounded  the linguini! The lemon juice, parsley and olive oil made a sort of sauce for the linguini! DELICIOUS.

Phenominal! Nicely crusted, with a great flavor, enhanced at the end with the lemon juice and parsley!

This recipe is great, I cooked this for friends and they all loved it. I did two things different, one  was to put the lemon and parsley as a dip and not tossed on the scallops and the other was to add some butter to the olive oil. The prep time for me, because I am not the fastest in the kitchen, was about 5 minutes and the cook time was about the same as the recipe shows.

WHOA!  Only 1/2 cup of flour but 2 tspof seasoning salt and 2T lemon pepper.  I blindly followd the recipe and it was wayyy salty.  Was good, but almost ruined $25 worth of sea scallops.

Excellent way to cook scallops.  I reduce the amount of flour and cook in a mix of olive oil and butter on medium high heat.  Serve on a bed of greens with cherry tomatoes =)

a few tips that I followed to get really crispy golden brown scallops: dry the scallops thoroughly so oil won't pop at you when you put them in, preheat the pot and oil until the oil "moves" (oil needs to be really hot if you don't want the flour to go all soggy, and this way, less oil will be absorbed into the scallops).  For this, I would use a metal skillet since I've been told that non-stick don't do too well with the preheating.  Once the scallops were in, I lowered the heat to medium, and seared on each side for ~3 minutes.

I made these as directed and they turned out perfect. I made my own sauce in the pan as other reviewers suggested using white wine, flour to thicken, butter and fresh spinach. I served it over pasta. Everyone loved it.

This one turned out really good!  Like some others said, I skipped the flour and just tossed in the spices.  I also went a little easy on the seasoning salt.  Everything seared perfectly with lots of burned-in flavor.  Very nice!

this was great and so easy.  i've been afraid to cook scallops because in the past i overcooked them.  This recipe was perfect and my fiance that they were awesome.   i tried a batch omitting the oregano and thyme and added cayenne pepper and garlic powder to the flour mixture. It had a nice bite if you like spice.

This was disappointing, considering how much I paid for sea scallops.  Not restaurant quality, even though I followed the helpful suggestions.  Definitely DON'T cook this on high heat!  I served it over pasta, but there wasn't any sauce to put over the pasta.

This was excellent.  At suggestion of others I deglazed the pan with some white wine, butter & lemon juice.  Used a little too much lemon :( ..so had to add a tablespoon of sugar to offset the acid but it was still delicious.

This turned out AMAZING! Browning the bacon has always been a puzzle; sooooo first I browned the wrapped scallops on their sides! When bacon was done as best I could, without destroying the scallops, I seared the flat sides of the scallops & added just a touch of Trader Joe's Balsamic Vinegar & cooked until just a very dw mins til done. The sweetness of TJ's own brand of balsamic vinegar really sends this recipe over the top! Oh Yeah!

I love scallops but have trouble making them on my own.  As I took the scallops out of the pan they looked awesome.  I did not put them in the oven to keep warm as suggested.  I think that might be the trick.  When I went to eat the scallops the crust was not crusty any longer.  Still delicious, but I really wanted a crusty shell.

It was good to find a recipe for scallops that didn't include garlic!  Cooking these on high was too hot for mine.  They got blackened just on med heat.  Has a nice mild balance of herbs which helped bring out the natural flavor of the scallops.  If you're used to a lot of seasonings then this might not be to your taste.  Overall a nice recipe!

This was delicious.  Simple to make, and this recipe really enhanced the delicate flavor you find in scallops.  Followed the recipe exactly.  You will have much of the sauce left over in the pan, but DO NOT pour it over your scallops once they're on your plate.  It will overpower the dish, as this is what happened w/my husband!

I won't make again, because we didn't care for all the lemon flavor, but that's a personal preference. I recommend large scallops and don't cook on high heat.

I've shared this recipe with two friends who rave over it as well.  Easy and looks elegant on the plate.

This is THE BEST scallop recipe I have ever tried. My family LOVED it.  And it was soooo easy. I would not change a thing, it's perfect the way it is!
