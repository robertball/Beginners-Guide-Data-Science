We went to a Hulk-themed birthday party this weekend and this is the EXACT same recipe she used for Hulk Juice. All the kids loved it. It makes a great foam on top, just like a root beer float. If you want to cut back on the sugar, I suggest you try to use SF soda and lowfat sherbet.

This turned out great for my daughter's Halloween themed birthday party! I added 1 pound of dry ice and it really made that sherbet bubble. Just don't fill your bowl up too far if you use the dry ice because it will overflow! Great recipe; the kids LOVED the effect!

You could add red maraschino cherries and juice into each ice cube prior to freezing.

It was okay I had to make a lot of changes to get the drink in the right taste, Which took a lot longer than 10 minutes :|
