This is AMAZING!  I didnt have the kidney beans so i went without.  I forgot to put the dill in the patties so I mad a dill mayonnaise mixture as a dressing and threw some sliced tomato on the burger.  Make these-you will not be disappointed!

I have never tried to make veggie burgers before and I was excited to have another meatless dish to add to our dinner rotation, but I'm not sure I will try this again.  The flavor is excellent, but there were some serious drawbacks.  There is definitely a lot of prep work to chop all of the vegetables.  If you have a food processor, it would save a lot of time to use that to mince everything.  I also had a really difficult time getting the patties to stick together.  I ended up with 11 patties, because the patties were huge if I just divided the recipe into eight.  We started out putting them on the grill on tinfoil (because I was afraid they would crumble), but I ended up just transferring them to a pan and frying them in a bit of butter because they were sticking to the foil and falling apart.  If I do try them again, I will add another egg to the mixture, make the patties even smaller, and just pan fry them in a bit of olive oil.

This is an amazing  meal. I didn't use all of the veggies, or an egg, and I also used black beans instead of kidney beans. One tip also is that I recommend not using a grill,  and instead you can use a pan and a little olive oil, (so if the patties break apart they won't fall into the abyss of the grill).  This is just what I did and you can make it differently, otherwise, this is an amazing burger, also great if you don't eat meat and or animal products.

Fabulous to freeze for lunches!
The first time I made this said "never again!" - it took two hours or more to do all the chopping! But then I spent the next 6 weeks or so eating them one by one from the freezer for lunch those days I stopped at home to eat between jobs. I've since made a second batch and am borrowing a blender this weekend to speed the chopping for a third batch!  (Note: I tried a borrowed "magic bullet" smoothie maker to chop things for the second batch, but it just turned them to mush. I'm hoping the lower power/speed on a real blender will do it right.) I don't sub any ingredients, and despite not liking dill pickles (the only other "dill" thing I've tried), I love these. One other note, regarding texture: they do tend to fall apart, but I eat them with a fork rather than trying to keep them on a bun so it's all good.
PS: After using AR for years (from time to time), I actually joined just now so I could review this recipe. Yes, I love it that much!

Wonderful, well-rounded flavor! Lots of prep, even with my mini chopper. Very sticky mixture, so I wasn't able to fry them on the pan like some suggested. I decided on a mess free/leave the kitchen option (silicone cupcake cups). It worked beautifully and when I popped them out they were cute little cakes. I drizzled with nonfat yogurt with crushed garlic in it and served with asparagus. Enjoy this, very yummy!

This took a long time to make but it was great!  Add extra egg as it doesn't stick together otherwise

I loved that there were so many wonderful ingredients in this recipe. I figured it might take a little longer to prep than the estimated 30 minutes. It took me hours to get everything minced (and I even resorted it a food processor)! I finally made them into burgers, and within minutes of going on the grill, they fell apart. We were able to save some of them,  and we turned what was left into more of a hash on the stovetop. It tasted great!!! But it wasn't great enough for two hours of work and the disappointment of everything falling into the grill. Maybe it would have been better if I had just put them in a skillet from the beginning. At least the flavor was good!!

Flavor!!!  Like everyone else I found the prep to take hours.  I used a food processor to mash the beans instead of a fork, and then used it to mix the ingredients together and believe that was the reason the mixture thinned out.  I ended up adding more bread crumbs to compensate.  Next time I'll mash and mix as directed and see what happens.  Once I was able to form patties I brushed them with olive oil and cooked them through on my George Foreman grill.  They got a nice crust on them also.   Even after freezing and recooking (cast iron grill, frying pan, oven) they were still great!  My vegetarian friend has been on the hunt for many years for a veggie burger with flavor, and she raves about these.

Nice veggie burger but challenging to handle. I added an extra egg and made the patties half sized.. that did help.  I waited until I got a good crust on one side before I flipped them too. Next time I think I'll add some ground oats to see if this helps. I cooked on a stove top... might try baking next time as well
