About 20 minutes after this soup finished cooking, it was served and disappointed. Little taste was detected. The single pinch of nutmeg and cayenne faintly hinted something was going on in the background but extremely lame. I probably added 3 pinches of each after taste testing while cooking. It was rated 3* at that juncture. The next day, however, this soup significantly improved, and I would rate it between 4*-5*. The cream topping is the star performer so don’t leave that out, and don’t be shy with the lemon zest (or add a few drops of lemon juice to make it more lemony). In terms of method and saving time, blended this soup in a Vitamix blender which eliminated the immersion blender and mesh strainer steps. This would be a fine, healthy choice if wanting to eat light on a hot summer day or trying to trim a hefty waistline. As Chef John said, it is a gorgeously colored, green soup.

My wife is the asparagus eater in our family so I make asparagus soup
occasionally.  Springtime especially.  This is indeed one of those
dishes that seems to develop flavor overnight.  However I found a way
to increase the flavor from the get go. Simply take the tough parts
of the asparagus stem (the part you'd normally discard) and SIMMER 
them in the chicken broth for 30 mins or so. Then discard them and 
proceed as per recipe. Adds a bang to the flavor.
Many thanks, Chef John.

Wow, I don't think I've ever been the first person to write a review before.  I followed the directions except kept adding more and more of all the seasonings to taste.  I also added more of the Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese and lemon rind than recipe called for.  This was a very nice soup for spring!

This soup was very easy and delicious.  Make sure you pay attention to the long simmering time for the onions, i really wanted to move on after 5 minutes but stuck it out and i'm glad i did.  Think of the 15 minutes as time to do the dishes!

Personally, my husband likes more pieces of asparagus in his soup so it was my fault to have used the emersion blender a little too long. I thought it was good. I am hoping tomorrow it tastes better. I had to use a little more seasonings as it was rather bland. I don't think my husband will eat anymore unless I put another pound of asparagus in it and leave it in pieces. Sorry.

It's a GREAT and beautiful soup but you will definitely need to add more than a pinch of seasoning to taste as stated, especially additional cayenne pepper. I also poured into my Ninja as I don't own an immersion blender.  I left off the cream topping  but served with the cheese and still a great soup with a side salad.  Thanks Chef John!

Another reviewer mentioned simmering the woody parts of the asparagus in the broth and water  for thirty minutes in a closed sieve or muslin bundle, removing them after 30 minutes and discarding them, then adding the tender parts of the asparagus and preceding as directed in the original recipe.  This made a lot of sense to me.  So, I prepared the recipe as written and added this step.  After really pureeing the soup and passing it through a very fine sieve, I finished the recipe off as written.  No need to wait the 24 hours.  This is one of the best soups I have ever had.  The added flavor from the woody stems extracted in this manner gave this soup fabulous flavor.  
     With this soup it is so important to taste, adjust seasonings, taste again and adjust as needed.  I will keep this recipe forever and it will be the star of my next dinner party.  The lemon cream with the parmesan and lemon zest takes it over the top.  Thank you so much, Chef John, and the wonderful reviewer who suggested extracting all that great flavor from the stems.

so disappointed.  The 2 cups of water ruined what could have been a creamy soup.  It was thin... didn't coat a spoon and lacked flavor.  so disappointed.

I made this soup and it was super delicious. I started to strain it but didn’t have the heart to throw away all that fibrous goodness, so I didn’t. It turned out thicker and yummy. I’ll definitely make it again.

I really like this!  I made it pretty much in accordance to the recipe, except I added a little diced celery to the onion sauté.  I also used half & half instead of heavy cream.  I did take the advice of one reviewer and included some of the throwaway pieces of asparagus in the initial simmer.  I think it helped increase the flavor, but it was tedious to remove without discarding onion too.  Don't be afraid to season this to your specific taste!

I am not a big fan of soups and when I took my daughter to a fancy restaurant she ordered a bowl of asparagus soup and she insisted I try it and it was love at first taste. I love asparagus and I went to allrecipes and decided to try this recipe. I added 1 jalapeño with the diced onion and that is the only change I made. This recipe is Fantastic and every bit as good as the one we had at the restaurant, and yes, I will be making this often. Thanks for sharing your recipe!

Yes, I would recommend this soup to my friends. Yes I made some changes. I used half chicken stock and half vegetable stock. I did this because I did not have enough chicken and vegetable stock, but together I had enough. This was excellent soup and I got lots of praises for making it. Friends and family wants me to make more. I have enjoyed  all of Chef Johns recipes that I have made. Thanks Chef John for the recipe and the video instructions .

I sautéed the pinion in butter, added the broth, then the asparagus. Blended it and just added salt and pepper to taste. It was PERFECT.

I saved all the asparagus tips and added them at the very end, so there would be some pieces throughout.  Easy to make and I like the texture, though I found it to be pretty flavorless; even had trouble tasting the main ingredient.  Soups always seem to taste better a day or two later though. I added diced mushrooms and didn't do the cream topping, though next time I might add lemon zest directly to the soup.  And I might experiment with other herbs too.

Made this for the first time yesterday. Did not thicken up for me, even after adding 1.5 cups of heavy cream. Flavor was good, though I think all the extra cream may have knocked down the asparagus taste. I bought enough to make this twice, will try another attempt.

This is 5-stars given a couple tweeks... I read all reviews before making this and made the following adjustments: 1) cook woody ends in chicken broth using a submersible  strainer during the initial boil. The strainer makes it easy to get the woody/tough pieces out. Discard them befoe the tender asparagus goes in.  2) Hold nutmeg...this was a personal preference. 3) I held the cream. 4) The most important thing was to leave this in the fridge overnight to develop the flavor. Strain the soup! It makes a big difference; no woody bits! Reheated the next day with lots of salt & pepper and fresh imported parm.  This freezes well without the cream.

I made this wonderful soup.  I had left over asparagus (extra thin) that was still a bit woody.  I made this soup and ran it through my food possessor for couple of minutes and it turned out perfect no straining required.  We opted for the extra Cayenne pepper and it was over fantastic!!  Thanks Chef John your the best!!!!!

Excellent starter for me! I didn't purée all the  way... Left chuncks. I added more nutmeg (several shakes) and only used black pepper. I used 5 chicken bouillon cubes to 4 cups of water for the chicken stock. Also, no fresh lemon so just put a splash of lemon juice in topping. I LOVED it!

Deliciosa. Segui las instrucciones al pied de la letra y realmente es una sopa deliciosa. Solamente añadí un poco más de media crema para darle un poco más de consistencia. Mi familia adoró esta sopa. Definitivamente es un must en la lista de recetas de esta increible página. Las recetas del Chef John son siempre deliciosas.

This recipe is so easy.  I also like its versatility. I did not use cayenne paper because I was planning to serve it to children.    I also used more of the other seasonings that the recipe called for because there was a lot of liquid in comparison to the asparagus and onions.  I also substituted half and half for the heavy whipping cream.  I was super smooth and creamy even though I didn't strain it. Next time I make it, I will add more asparagus and probably hold off on either a cup of broth or water.  The flavor and consistency in the end product was very good. My daughter had 2 servings! Oh, and I didn't make the cream, lemon topping.

The best asparagus soup I've ever made!  Used half and half rather than cream, which was just fine.  I don't get that some reviewers thought it lacked rich taste.   Adjust the seasonings to your liking, that's all!  Did not do the cream topping this time and it was still awesome.  Next time, I'll make it.  You rock, Chef.

I loved this soup, but I also added a bit of Parmesan cheese on top.   It was very delicious!

Cudo's again to Chef John! This was delicious! I have made this recipe a few times and only change the heavy cream,(canned milk) and leave the asparagus a little chunky. The flavor is wonderful, love it.
