This is a great recipe. Based on my preferences and from previous feedback, I made some modifications. My husband and I like spicy food but I found this recipe as is is a little too spicy.  I only use a 1/2 of the jalapeños and cayenne pepper.   I use 2 cans of the green chilies. I wanted my chili a little thicker so I pureed one can of the white beans and only used 2 cups of chicken broth.  I also added a can of black beans and a can of corn.  And finally since the cheese adds a lot of fat, rather than mixing it all in, I just sprinkle a little on top before eating.  This is really delicious.  Everyone I serve it too raves about it.

We loved this recipe but it is soooooo hot! Per a previous review, I cut down to 2 cans of beans, and only used 1/4 tsp of cayene pepper and added some sour cream to cool it down but still...HOT! I will make again but I will eliminate the jalapeno peppers altogether (I'm not a huge fan of them anyways), cut the cumin down to 1 tsp and omit all cayenne pepper. Really, the taste is fabulous...if your not weak of tongue. I was practically sweating just eating a bowl! Still, will make again with my alterations.

First of all Excellent the tase is quite unique.  Two helpful hints.  I put everything together before I even turned on the flame on my big pot.  Also I put the cheese in last so that it would not burn on the bottom of the pot.  Made it both ways and frankly both ways turned out the same with the surprise when you eat it the next day.  WOW!

I added a can of corn, used a can of cream of chicken in place of one can of chicken broth, used all mild green chilies instead of jalapenos (it came out perfectly spiced), and threw everything into the crockpot on high for 4 hours.  I hand-shredded the chicken at the end and put it back in.  Delicious!  Oh, and I also pureed one can of the white beans and that really helped to thicken things up.

This chili is outstanding.  My husband isn't a big fan of chili, so I thought maybe a white chicken chili would interest him instead.  Ten bowls later, I can assure you he (and everyone else) loves it!  Serve with a dollop of sour cream and a scoop of salsa on top...it tastes great once it's stirred in.  But be careful if you don't like hot foods, or are serving to people who don't.  It is considerably hot (and this is coming from someone who eats jalapenos out of the jar, wasabi with a spoon, and puts cayenne pepper in her green bean casserole).  Cool it off with less jalapenos (replace with mild green chiles) if you need to.  I also like to serve this chili over a serving of rice (sounds strange, but it's really really good!).

OH MY GOSH! This was great!!! I used skinless, boneless chicken tenders instead of the cooked chicken. I sauted them until they were no longer pink, then added the onions, fresh garlic, chiles, and spices to the same saute pan...Then I dumped everything into a big stew pot, and simmered it for an hour or so. I also added about 2 tsps of Chili Powder, and substituted shredded Colby/Jack cheese...This recipe got rave reviews from everyone! I served it with warm flour tortillas, and a huge salad. YUM! Will make this again!.

This soup is nothing short of awesome. My husband raved about this soup for 2 days. I did brown the cooked chicken w/ the onions, didn't have white beans, just used 1 can navy beans & 1 can dark red kidney beans, added some frozen corn and 1 can of cream of chicken. Then, since it was EXTREMELY spicy (quite a kick) and sort of thin, I added some diced potatoes to absorb some of the broth and "kick". My husband was getting it out of the pot before I even added the cheese, which I'm sure is just as good sprinkled on top later.  This recipe really surprised me on how it tasted like something you would get @ a pricey restaurant. It smells really good when cooking and would be an awesome soup to serve @ a party (and impress your guests). Way to go!

This is the BEST chili! By far my new favorite. It's the perfect amount of spice, very warm! I used pepperjack cheese and replaced 1 can of white beans with black beans. I added 1/2 c. sour cream at the end and topped with tomatoes. This is absolutely wonderful chili, thanks for a GREAT recipe!

This is SO good!  I just made it and am waiting for my husband to get home; if he doesn't hurry, it will be too late.  :-)  We like hot spicey foods, but we don't like it so overpowering that the heat takes over the flavor.  SO!  I used only 2 tablespoons of the jalapenos and chopped them up very finely so they would be well-distributed throughout the dish.  I also used 1/4 tsp of cayenne pepper.  This is perfect seasoning for us.  I also only put in one can of chicken broth on the advice of other reviewers, and I added a 4th can of beans to thicken it up a bit.  Thank you, Cathy!  It is great!

Yum!!  We loved this recipe.  Made some changes.  Used one pound all white meat ground turkey and 2 skinless, boned chicken breasts diced.  Cooked the meat together with the seasonings.  Added some chili powder to the seasoning.  Reduced the cayenne to 1/8 teaspoon.  To further lower fat I skipped the cheese and put 1/2 can beans in food processor and used this to thicken.  Garnishes on side to use as desired were: cheese, tortilla chips, sour cream, salsa and red onion.   Warms your tummy in this very chilly winter!

I love this recipe! However, I make a few modifications.. #1, I throw everything into a crockpot (including the uncooked chicken) and let it all cook together.  #2. I puree the white beans before putting them into the mix.  This makes it much thicker and chili-like.  #3. Once the chicken is cooked I shred as opposed to chopping it.  I also don't use that much chicken broth - maybe a cup or a cup and a half.  It's a very thick and rich chili when it's all done - delicious!

Wowzer...this was awesome, but HOT!  My 4 oz can of jalapeno peppers really packed a punch, but it was oh so yummy!  I only used 1 can of small white beans, which I pureed before adding to the pot.  It made the chili nice and thick.  I also used a whole block of pepper jack cheese, which I grated.  Next time I make this, I will use a rotisserie chicken (if I can remember to buy one) instead of the boiled chicken tenders I used. At the end, I threw in a handful of chopped cilantro and served the chili over crushed tortilla chips. This was excellent and I can't wait to make it again. Thanks a million.

So good I doubled it the second time I made it for leftovers!  Delicious the first day but even better the second day as the flavors infuse.  I double the green chile peppers and leave out the jalapenos to make it kid friendly, and it's still plenty spicy.  I also puree one can of beans for thickening and serve extra cheese on the side for topping.  Best white chili I've ever had!  Thanks for this awesome recipe!

everyone loved it.  used a costco chicken shredded (about 4 cups- no wings or legs).  too much chicken.  next time stick to 3 cups.  used about 1/4 of the jalapenos and perfect (served rest on side). served w/ crushed tortilla chips too- so yummy. left cheese on side and sour cream (added lots of sour cream to kids bowls to cool down the kick).  cooked on stove brought to a boil then put it in slow cooker on low for an hour and then kept it warm so it was ready when we got home.  i pureed 1 of the cans of navy beans but i bet  1 1/2 would be better- also used the blender/puree thing in the entire crock pot to make a tiny bit thicker.  depends on your preference.  served w/ bread and hot dogs.  yummy.  enough for 6 adults or 4-5 adults and a few kids.

I just won a chili cookoff with this recipe, out of 12 entries!  I was a little short on time, so I did end up using a store-bought garlic and herb rotisserie chicken, which I shredded.  I also doubled the amount of green chiles, left out the jalapenos, added a small jar of salsa verde, and doubled the cumin so that it tasted more like chili than chicken soup.  I took someone else's advice and pureed one can of the beans for a thicker texture, swirled sour cream on top, and sprinkled chopped cilantro on top for a prettier presentation.  People were clamoring for the recipe, and I'm making another batch this week for the folks who weren't able to taste it before it was all eaten up.  My first chili cook-off win ever!

I've made this twice now, and both times the pot has been licked clean! I use my crockpot on low and throw in raw chicken breasts with the chicken broth and diced onions ans let it cook for a couple hours. Then I add the seasoning and chilies and jalapenos and give it another couple hours. Then I hand shred the chx breasts and add 2 cans of white beans, 1 can of black beans and 1 can of corn. Another few hours in the crockpot and its ready! Sprinkle cheese and a dollop of sour cream and its amazing!!

FANTASTIC!  I do have to agree, however, that we must call this what it is - soup.  But FANTASTIC SOUP!  The variations I made:

-Pureed one of the cans of white beans
-Added one can of Black Beans
-Added frozen corn
-Used only 1 Tbs Jalapenos
-Added extra can green chilis
-Added dollop of fat free sour cream to each bowl
-Omitted cheese in soup, but sprinkled some on top of each serving
-Used one whole rotisserie (sp?) chicken instead of cooking my own
-Used 1/2 called for cayene pepper
-After cooking onion, threw rest of ingredients in the crock pot on low for 6 hrs

Made MUCH more than 4 servings!  My crockpot was full.

This resulted in a yummy, yummy soup.  Spice mild enough for my 3 & 5 year olds.  Hubby and I added some extra jalapenos to each of our bowls to kick ours up a notch, but it was plenty good without it.  Served with cornbread - mmmm!  THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU!

I think the key to this recipe is to use shredded chicken instead of chopped.  Boil the chicken with the garlic (I doubled the garlic and onions), onions, jalapeños, green chiles, spices and broth until it's able to be shredded, then return to the broth and simmer on low for as long as possible.  Then add the beans (undrained) and the cheese.  It's absolutely delicious!  You should NOT radically alter the recipe.  

P.S.:  The perfect accompaniment to this recipe is Absolute Mexican Cornbread (http://allrecipes.com/Recipe/Absolute-Mexican-Cornbread/Detail.aspx).

I usually make my Mom's recipe for white chicken chili, but have always found it too much like a soup, rather than a chili.  Tried Cha Cha's last night and it was fantastic!  Maybe it's not quite as thick as chili, but it's really close.  I put in 2 1/2 cans of navy beans and then smashed up the other 1/2 can, which helped to thicken it.  Also, I used 2-3 teaspoons of the jalapenos and green chilis, rather than the amount called for.  In addition, rather than chicken broth, I used store-bought chicken stock.  I also cooked it for an hour, rather than the time called for.  When it was done, I spooned it in individual bowls and hubby and I added cheese and sour cream to our liking.  This was fantastic, only takes one pot to make, and will definitely be made again in our house!

This really is a fabulous recipe. If you are thinking it is too spicy, just omit the jalepenos. I add a cup or two more of chicken broth and I use different kinds of beans each time I make it. I love it with Black Eye Peas. We sprinkle green onions, cilantro, monterey jack cheese, crushed tortilla chips, guacamole, sour cream, and a lime wedge on top. SO INCREDIBLY GOOD! A real comfort food. This is almost just like the White Chili recipe from Beyond Parsley. A cookbook put out by the Junior League of Kansas.

This was fantastic. Reading the reviews, I followed the recipe with the exception of only adding 2 tbls of chopped up jalepenos and I added 1/2 cup sour cream, it really needed that to make it white, and not soupy looking. Will be making this again and again in my crock pot. Cooked the chicken first in the crock pot for 4 hrs on low and shredded it after that. Great.

This was fabulous, and much easier than my old recipe that started with dried beans.  I had grilled chicken breasts on hand, so I shredded 3 large ones up for this chili.  I also modified amounts of spicy stuff, as we are not terribly fond of very spicy food.  I used 4 ounces of “tamed” jalapeños, and only ¼ teaspoon of cayenne.  Before serving, I smashed some of the beans in the pot to thicken the chili a bit.   I also topped the chili with the jack cheese instead of stirring it in.  Additional toppers  were chopped avocado, thin sliced scallions and salsa verde.  If you don’t have salsa verde, just some cilantro would be great.  Tamed jalapeños are a jarred product from Mezzetta’s.  The jalapeño was developed by Texas A & M Univ., and they have greatly reduced the capsaicin in these peppers.  They have all the flavor of traditional jalapeños, with *much* less heat.  We absolutely love them.  My old white chili recipe has been replaced!

Very simple. I'd never made white chili before, this is a good beginner recipe.  I added two chopped red peppers which I sauteed with the onion and garlic and used Bill Echols taco seasoning(minus the hot spices because the soup would be hot enough without adding more chili pepper. I've got two kids I'm feeding, too.) I also added a small bag of frozen corn from Tacoma Boys. It's warm here, so I put all the ingredients in the crockpot and let it cook away on low all day. I think that might have been a bad move, because the chili came out kind of soupy. Other than that, I thought the flavor of this was very good, though a little weak. Could use a little more taco seasoning. I made Mexican Sunset Bread to go with. NOTE: I read somewhere that if you mash up one can of your beans, you don't have to worry about it thickening up. That's what I did and it would have worked out great, had I not made it in the crockpot. The next day, I did end up adding another round of Bill Echols taco seasoning and fresh cilantro. That helped the flavor quite a bit.

Delicious!  I didn't know how this would turn out since there wasn't a thickening ingredient like red chili, but when everything is in the pot and you add the shredded cheese it thickens up perfectly!  I did omit the can of jalapenos and stuck with the green chilies.  Recipe is a keeper! thanks

Have made this twice -Would give this 5 stars but I tweek it so I can't give it five as it stands.  It is definitely on the hot side, I ease up on the peppers a bit and it is still plenty spicy. I like cumin, so I add a bit more. Add a small can of diced, drained tomatoes..Then I add a little heavy cream to make the color more white, use the hand blender to make it a little smoother, and then top it with sour cream for a cooling affect and cilantro for color. YUM! Now its ready for 5 stars!

Definitely 5 stars with only minor changes.  I pureed some of the beans, added an entire de-boned rotisserie chicken from the supermarket and halved the cayenned.  I also sauteed the onions until they were caramelized.  Fabulous!

Brought it to the potluck.  And out of the 5 crockpots full of soup, this was the only one that disapeared, and disapeared quickly.  It was a hit.

Ok it was altered.  But still very close to the original.
no can of green chilis - I deseeded and put in 2 Anaheim chilis;
no jalepenos and no cayenne - 1 tsp of crushed red peppers; 
no chicken broth - 3 cubes of bullion, one cup water, one cup milk;
2 cans of white beans plus juice, not 3;
2 cups of moterey, not 1, dairy is what makes white chili, want healthy? then go eat red or green chili;
added 2 tblsp of lime juice;
added 1/4 cup of fresh cilantro

I have made this recipe twice. The first time I followed the recipe without the green chilli peppers and about half of the spices. It was very good. The second time, I used left over turkey meat from Thanksgiving and followed the recipe exactly as printed. This was entirely too spicy for us (even my husband, who likes it very spicy). So I added the following: 1 large onion, 1 stalk celery, and 1 carrot (all diced), an extra can of chicken broth and 1 can of veggie broth. This helped to lighten the heat. I will make this again because the general recipe is very good. With a little improvising this can be adjusted to your preferences.

This recipe is great, but instead of adding a can of jalapeños, I add chipotle chile powder for heat and a bit of tomato paste for a little richer flavor.  Plus, I leave out the oregano since it seems just a touch overpowering to my tastebuds.

Very good.  I served jalapeno and cayenne on the side because I have small children, but otherwise followed the recipe.  I did take the advice of one of the reviewers and pureed one can of beans to use as a thickener.  Worked perfectly!

This was outstanding! My husband, who is not a big chili fan, really liked it, too (got an "eyebrow raise" while eating it - ultimate compliment! : ) I used a shredded rotisserie chicken from Sam's and navy beans, 1 can diced chiles, a smaller amt of jalapenoes that I chopped up. Admittedly not a pretty dish to look at, but MAN, is it good!!

I am going to buck the 5 star trend here.  I made this for the Superbowl; I cut the jalepenos by 1/2 based on other reviews. Even then, it was left mostly untouched by my guests. It was unpleasantly spicy. At the end of the game I had 15 bowls with one or two bites taken from it.  What a waste! So "as written" I give it a one or two star rating.  I would definately cut the cayenne, jalepenos and cumin by at least half, then add them back to taste later on.  I would also use more cheese and serve w/cheese on top. This can definately be a 5 star recipe, but as written, it will not get 5 stars from me.

If you are like me, and prefer to save as much time as possible, cook this in your slow cooker.  I added all ingredients except cheese (used 3 large uncooked chicken breast) and cooked 8 hours on low - it came out fantastic.  I did use some other user's tips:  I cooked with 2 cans white beans, 1 can black beans, 1 can of corn, omitted the can of jalepenos and added a fork full of sliced jalepenos.  You can't mess this up in the slow cooker, it came out nice and thick.  I served with a dollop of sour cream and my husband added cheese and ate with tortilla chips.  So simple and came out great!  Thanks for the great recipe!

Delicious recipe! I did cool it down a bit by leaving the jalapeno peppers out and thickened it with a bit of corn starch. We loved it!  An easy recipe to customize although delicious to begin with.

I've had this recipe for a while and I finally made it and it was excellent.  It's probably the best "soup" I've ever made.  It really is more of a soup than chili which is fine with me.  You just need to add more chicken and beans for chili.  The flavors and spices compliment one another very well.  Wonderful recipe!

Excellent dish. Added a can of Ro-Tel's in and gave the mixture a few seconds of my handmixer to add creaminess and texture. Also upon serving I gave a squeeze of fresh lime and a little chopped cilantro.
Ole!

This recipe was awesome especially when served with Grandmother's Buttermilk Cornbread from this site!  Since I had some cooked leftover chicken I used that and threw everything in a crockpot on high for 2 hours and on low for about 3 hours.  I used a vidalia onion, reduced sodium chicken broth and left out the cayenne since my leftover chicken was already spicy.   However, I did add about a cup of mild salsa and jalapeño jack cheese.  I will definitely be making this often.

Excellent recipe!  Based on other reviewers I made these changes: pureed 1 can of cannelini beans, used 1 can each of Rotel, corn, cannelini, black beans & a can of cream of chicken soup to thicken it up.  Also reduced the cayenne to 1/4 tsp & gave 2 dashes of Chipotle Tabasco for some smokey flavor.  Served it with diced thai chiles for mny chile heads, diced poblano for milder, cilantro & sliced cherry tomtatoes.  It was wonderful!  thank you so much for this recipe!

This was AMAZING.  Sooo good!  I used fresh jalapenos instead of canned (de seeded) and I used real chicken stock and leftover chicken off the bone.  That makes all the difference, I think. I simmered it all day, adding broth occasionally, and then added the cheese at the very end.  Served with sour cream, and it was so good.  My husband was raving about it. Definitely keeping this recipe!

This was a great recipe!  I love hot foods and this was definitely HOT.  It was a bit too hot for me, actually.  I added one more can of chicken broth, a bag of cheese, fresh jalapenos with out the seeds, a half teaspoon more cumin, one can of diced tomatoes , chili powder instead of oregano, and ground chicken instead of chopped.  I rinsed all of my beans and tomatoes really well.  The cheese and extra broth cut down on the spice quite a bit.  I think that using fresh seedless jalapenos instead of the canned may have cut down on the heat as well.  All in all, this was a very good recipe and easy to manipulate into your own style.

Very good.  Very spicy, though, and I only added a pinch of cayenne not the whole teaspoon.  I stirred in some sour cream (maybe 1/3 cup) instead of the cheese, and then added pepper jack cheese and crushed tortilla chips to each bowl

I LAUGH WHEN PEOPLE "REVIEW" AND THEN SAY BUT I CHANGED THIS AND THIS WELL I AM ONE OF THEM NOW. THE FLAVOR WAS AWESOME AS IS FOR PEOPLE WHO LIKE SPICY - DON'T CHANGE A THING!. 
HERE IS WHAT I CHANGED FOR MY PERSONAL PREFERENCES. I WOULD OMIT THE JALAPENOS BECAUSE I DON'T LIKE SUPER SPICY, I WOULD CUT THE  BROTH BECAUSE I LIKE THICK CHILI TO MUCH BROTH MADE IT SOUPY. AND HONESTLY I DIDN'T COUNT THE "CUPS" OF CHICKEN I JUST CUT UP 4 CHICKEN BREASTS COOKED THEM AND TOSSED THEM IN. OH YEA AND A CAN OF DRAINED WHOLE  KERNAL CORN BECAUSE I LIKE CORN.
ANYWAY THE WHOLE FAMILY LOVED IT!

This was the first white chili I've tried, and I have already had a request to make more. I used the full amount of spices, but followed the suggestion to puree one can of beans to make the chili thicker. I let it simmer for 20 minutes longer than suggested, and it came out thick (like chili should be!) It was twice as good the second day.

I took a hint from reviews that mentioned this wasn't very thick, and used only half of the broth. It made for a nice, thick chili. I also left out the jalapenos (served them on the side as topping for those who like heat) and cayenne to accomodate those who don't like heat. I took the hint from the submitter and subbed them for an extra tin of green chilies. This is the first white chili I have made and we all enjoyed it. It's even better the next day. Really flavorful.

Very delicious....especially the second day!  I used two cans of green chilis and soaked two cups of dry beans instead of using canned.  Next time I will reduce the amount of cayenne pepper....it had just a bit too much kick for my kids, but they loved it anyway.

I would have given this recipe 5 stars, except I made a few changes!  I agree with the other reviews that this was going to be super spicy so I changed it up a bit so the entire family would enjoy.  Instead of preparing it like the directions, I used the crockpot instead! I threw in 2 frozen chicken breasts (you can put in thaw uncooked chicken to speed up time), 1 can of corn (drained), 2 cans of white beans, 1 can of white kidney beans, 1 can (4oz.) green chiles, 1 can of chicken broth (I found it was too soupy with 2 cans of broth, but just my preference), half of an onion (diced), 3 cloves garlic (minced), 2 tsp cumin, 1 tsp cayenne pepper, 1 tsp oregano, salt/pepper to taste.  I put the crockpot on for 6 hours (high) and then shredded the chicken 30 mins before serving.  It was so delicious!!!  Certainly will be a regular at our house.

Excellent, fairly easy dinner on a below 30 degree night!  To pre-cook the chicken, I brined & poached it in salted water with about 2 Tbsp. southwest seasoning.  I'm almost glad that I brined it, because the chili itself was a tad underseasoned.  I added a few tsps of salt to perk it up.  
Great heat level for my taste (I don't like too much) and the 4 of us finished off the pot for dinner with some corn bread.  Will be making this again!

I'm so happy to see this recipe posted.  I made it a few times last year and misplaced the recipe.  We all love it and you can make it as spicy as you like by adjusting the ingredients slightly.

This is a sensational recipe and a nice break from our other chili recipes! I made it as described and it was perfect! I did not think it was too hot, though we like a kick to our chili. I used a rotisserie chicken from the grocery store, which made this recipe even easier, topped with a little extra cheese and a dollop of sour cream. We served it with corn bread and a black bean salad. This one is a keeper and we'll definitely make it again! Thank you !

We LOVE this recipe!!!  I made it exactly as stated, it was spicy but not as horrible as other reviewers said.  Really this recipe doesn't need any changes, but I think I will add a can corn next time for texture.

This was fabulous. I omitted the jalapenos and cayanne pepper (because I have small children and a heartburn prone husband), used 2 cans green chilis (pureed for my picky son), 1/2 teaspoon cumin, and black beans (because I was out of white). I left everything else the same. It was so yummy and even my bean hating husband liked it and said that I could make it again.

I followed this as written except for omitting the jalepenos and I thought it was just ok. I was looking for a creamier, thicker sauce I think so I followed some other reviewers suggestions and pureed one can of trhe beans. I also added a little half and half and corn. With these changes it was a four star.

My favorite...always double or triple for large crowds or freezing and eating later!  Pretty spicy so I often don't use all of the chiles and jalepenos.

I LOVE this chili. I have made this recipe several times and finally found the perfect combination for my tastes. To begin, I cook and shred about a pound of chicken breast. I dice 1 medium onion and cook it along with 6 cloves of garlic. I omit the jalapeno peppers. I add two cans of green chilies. I use 2 tsp. of ground cumin, 2 tsp. of oregano, and 1/4 tsp. of ground red pepper (do not have cayenne pepper). I use 2 cans of chicken broth. I use 4 cans of white beans (puree 3 of the cans in the blender). I do not add the cheese to the mixture, but rather let everyone add what they would like on their own. It is excellent with crushed tortilla chips and sour cream on top as well!! This recipe is a KEEPER!!

I LOVE LOVE LOVE this recipe! Can't believe I'm only reviewing it now...I've been making this for a good 2 years now.  I simplify it quite a bit though...I only use green chiles, garlic, onions, cumin, italian seasoning, chicken (canned or rotisserie), broth and combo of great northern and white kidney beans.  Perfect EVERY time!  Wonderful recipe!!!

Right up my ally but I gave it only 4 stars since I had to make so many alterations to the recipe. Based on other reviewers suggestions, I omitted the jalapeno and only put about a pinch of the cayenne pepper in it. These are some other alterations I made to make this good dish an extraordinary dish: the juice of 2 limes, 2 tbsp chardonnay, little less than 1 tbsp balsamic vinegar, 1/2 tsp salt, 1/8 tsp ground black pepper, 1/4 tsp sugar, pinch red pepper flakes, and fresh cilantro. I also used just 2 cans of white beans and 1/2 cup frozen corn kernals (frozen for better freshness). I also cut a few corn tortillas into strips, brushed them lightly with oil, and baked them until very lightly browned for extra garnish and flavor. Delicious with these additions!

Superb flavor!  We love spicey, so this was perfect for us.  Even dared to use fresh jalapenos.  And during the season (about August) we used hatch chiles... which added a wonderful taste!!!  This is just darn good chili!

Really changed this up! Wanted my picky eaters to enjoy this so left out peppers and spices.  Substituted italian seasoning and added cooked whole grain macaroni.  They ate it all!  Used ground turkey instead of chicken breast.  Great quick meal everyone will enjoy!

I tried this out for a Chili fund-raiser at church.  It was a smashing hit.  Everyone wanted to know the recipe.  I am going to cook it tonight for a pot-luck dinner at church tomorrow.  BTW, I used a rotisserie-style chicken instead of the breast.  It was already cooked and just had to be deboned.  Thanks, Cha Cha

This was absolutely delicious. Like others suggested, I used about 2 heaping teaspoons of the diced jalapeno and most of the green chilis - not all.  I used both cans of broth (didn't cut back as on of the reviewers suggested).  I used two cans of canned white beans (pureed one) and one can of pinto beans.  Then when it was done and in the soup bowls, I put a little shredded mozarella on top.  Really good recipe and easy!  Oh and I sauted some celery with the onion.  Also added a can of corn to it.

outstanding!  after reading reviews, I decided to replace the jalepenos with more mild green chiles and to only add 1/4 tsp of cayenne.  It was still plenty spicy for me.  I also took about a third of the soup before I added the cheese (I dodged most of the chicken)and pureed it and then put it back in the pot to thicken it up.  The puree really makes the flavors and the consistency come together nicely.

Awesome recipe!  Every time I serve this someone asks for the recipe.  I must admit to altering it a bit: less liquid (we like stews better than soups) and less peppers (full strength it's a spicy for young palates).

I made this at my parent's house and we all loved it.  Heat-wise I found it to be mild and my parents thought it was just perfect.  When making it for myself I would probably add peppers much higher on the Scoville heat scale.  It had a great flavor anyway so for most people adding hotter peppers would be unnecessary.

If you want more of a chili I'd recommend swapping one can of broth with an extra can of beans.  Just mash beans on the side of the cooking pot to preference.  Don't forget that you'll be adding cheese at the end which will thicken it even more.

I've made this recipe dozens of times now, and it's always a huge hit. My husband can't handle spicy foods, so I leave out the jalepenos and the chilis and offer them on the side, along with olives, more cheese, tobasco, green salsa ... you get the picture. Guests love the "make as you like" presentation. One person even asked me for some pickle juice. The chili stands on its own as well.

I loved it.  I used fresh roasted green chile & freah jalapenos instead of canned.  I added an extra cup of cheese, Misson corn chips & a little bit of sour cream.  My boyfriend never eats leftovers, but this time he did!  Great recipe!!!

I give this recipe 4 stars, although I don't make it exactly as written.  We never use canned beans, so I pre-soaked 1 lb. of dry white beans and cooked them with the other ingredients in the crock pot.  I did skip the jalapenos and only used a dash of cumin & cayenne, due to my family's preferences.  I think the crock pot cooking makes all the difference in the world, because it gives the flavors more of a chance to combine, which reduces the "bland" flavor some have complained about.  It also soaks up much of the liquid, and after removing & pureeing some of the beans just before serving, it ended up with the perfect texture.  The initial recipe is great for a quick meal, but the crock pot makes it so much better.  (I cooked it for 7 hours on high.)

I absolutely LOVED this recipe!  I took the advice from other reviewers, regarding the heat, and omitted the jalapeños and red pepper.  I did; however, add another can of green chilies.   Other than that, I followed the recipe to a T.   This will definitely be my Go To White Chicken Chili recipe!

Loved this ! I used no sodium broth so I could adjust the salt as needed. I also used a can of corn in place of one of the cans of beans. Always rinse and drain your canned veggies very well before using. I had a fresh jalapeno ,so I used half of a medium sized jalapeno, chopped fine.You definitely want to adjust the heat factor to your liking as this can get really hot ! I started out with half the cayenne and less than half jalapeno. I used a dollop of sour cream instead of cheese and added tortilla chips when serving. My boyfriend took this to work and all the guys loved it !

First time making a chicken chili. This is really good, made a few changes based on review and families dislike of a lot of heat. I used 2 cans of green chili's and just a dash of cayenne, omitted the jalapeño. I added 1 teaspoon of flour when I sautéed onions and garlic. I smashed 1 of the cans of beans to help with thickness, someone did mention it was a bit to thin for chili. It worked out fine, was the perfect texture and thickness. Really good flavor, will def. make again.

A great base recipe and is one of my wife's favorites.  Like others, I use just two cans of beans and add cheese and sour cream after plating.  It is a little on the spicy side, but I like it that way.  I use fresh chopped jalapino and use a can of Rotel instead of the can of chili peppers. It's even better the next day.

This soup is great!  It's so easy to make it your own with whatever you have on hand.  I put in some fire roasted diced tomatoes which tasted wonderful.  We'll be making this on again for sure!

I make a big pot of this twice a month.  We all love it!  I think the heat is just right. I've begun adding a couple cans of garbanzo beans for their texture (navy beans are so soft, garbanzos keep a little chew) .  I use fresh jalapeños when I think of it, which adds a nicer flavor then the canned.  Other than that I make it pretty straight from the recipe.  Healthy, fast, delicious and tastes even better over the next few days when I bring it to work for lunch.

Very hot if made per recipe.  I normally like a medium hot sauce but this was way too hot.  The 2nd time I took the advice of many of the reviews and reduced cayenne pepper to 1/2 teaspoon and cumin to 1 teaspoon.  Also, omitted jalapeno peppers and increased green chiles to 8 ounces.  Much better.

Not bad at all. Really nice flavor, used black beans, chick peas, and great northern beans and didn't use any jalapenos and it still had a decent kick! even for me who likes spicy! I sauteed the chicken and then let it simmer on low for 2 hours with all the spices and then shredded it which thickened the chili up so nicely.

There's definintely a lot of leeway here for modification for those of us who don't want a terribly spicy dish.  The submitter makes excellent suggestions to substitute the jalapenos for mild green chiles, which is what I did.  I also added a can of Rotel.  Great dish and comes together quickly if you use a rotisserie chicken, which I did.

I like it a tad thicker so I only added 1 can of chicken broth and added 1/2 cup sour cream. I cut cayenne in half as it seems plenty hot with all the spicy ingredients.

This was a huge hit at my house!  I have made it several times and there are rarely leftovers.  The only thing I did is omit the jalapenos and instead, substitute hotter green chiles because we prefer that flavor.  So good!

I used pickled jalapenos because that's what I had on hand. I also used the spicy Mrs. Dash since I didn't have any cayenne pepper. I also did an extra can of white beans pureed to thicken the broth. This recipe is definitely a keeper! Easy to do and tastes great.

This was pretty good as written, but I had to adjust the spice level for our tastes by reducing to cayenne to about 1/3 tsp, and I also only used the one can of jalapenos as I didn't have chilis on hand.  I wanted to make this to reheat later in the week, so I omitted the Monterey Jack as I wasn't sure how that would reheat, plus now I can top with either the jack, queso blanco or even just plain sour cream at each serving.  I also omitted the parsley and subbed fresh cilantro which I added in the last five minutes of cooking, and I didn't used canned beans, but rather soaked and cooked my own great northern beans the day before, and used homemade no salt added chicken broth, so I did add a bit of salt for flavor to the finished product.   I think next time I'dd like to add some sort of vegetable, corn, carrots or zucchini, and I think using boneless, skinless chicken thighs instead of or in addition to the chicken breast would give this a bit more flavor, but all in all, I liked this!

AWESOME! I followed the recipe exactly, with the exception of adding 1/2 the amount of jalapeno peppers (I knew we couldn't have eaten it otherwise -- it would have been too hot for us). Very hearty and delicious meal ... will definitely make again!

Great chili!  This is the only chicken chili my husband admits to liking.  I typically use various fresh (& spicey!) peppers, and I also puree 1 can of the beans to thicken it up.  Delicious!

My husband and I get together with close friends every weekend and I've made this for our dinner twice. It is the best white chicken chili I've ever made, hands down. I only made 2 changes to the recipe: I use Caldo con Sabor de Pollo for the broth which eliminates the need for additional salt and I leave the jalapeno peppers out because not everyone likes the heat. To make up for it, I had a healthy dash or three of Crystal hot sauce.  If you're looking for a tasty white chili recipe, this one is it.

Very good!  Left out the jalapenos because I was afraid it would be too hot and my husband hates onion, so I changed that to 2 tsp granulated onion.  That was the only change.  Loved it.

Contrary to so many rave reviews, we found this mediocre as written. Nothing stood out to make this any more than white beans and chicken combined together. Having said that, it was something we would make again after adding Sweet Baby Ray’s Honey Barbeque Sauce, and using this dish as a topping for baked potatoes.

We think this is quite tasty!  The only changes I make is to puree 1 1/2 cans of cannellini beans & we added canned creamed corn this time (as opposed canned corn last time we made).  We then simmered it for 1hr to reduce & thicken.  I still love this recipe.  It's delicious.  I've even thought of using this as a "filler" for enchiladas, burrito pie & even lasagna.  Think I'm going to attempt to do this soon!  Great Recipe!  I just prefer thicker like most commenter's do as well.  We served w/jack cheddar combo & sour & homemade cornbread.

This is one of my favorite reciepes! My whole family loved this one! I did follow the advice of another review and I cut the jalapenos and cayenne pepper in half, I used only 1 can chicken broth, 2 cans green chiles, I pureed 1 can of the beans for a thicker soup, and I added a can of corn and a can of black beans!! This is delish!!!

Can't give it 5 stars because I did alter it a little...
I cooked the chicken and then added the onion because I didn't have any precooked chicken.  I used 2 fresh jalapenos instead of canned.  I used 1/2 tsp of cayenne and replaced the other 1/2 tsp with regular chili powder.  I only used 1 can of low-sodium chicken broth because I didn't want my chili soupy.  Last but not least I used only 1/3 of a cup of Pepper Jack Cheese, instead of an entire cup, to lower the fat content a little and well, quite frankly that is all I had.  I topped with a tsp of light sour cream and a pinch of minced cilantro.
This was still quite spicy but not overwhelmingly so.  My kids complained about this being what I was making for dinner, however both went back for more.  Easy & Tasty!

Really good. I made it almost exactly as written. I accidentally bought jalapeños that had carrots, but I think it added to the flavor. My husband and I both loved it, and had leftovers. I think this is more than 4 servings, I portioned out 2 cups per bowl and had over 6 servings. Don't think I did anything wrong!

Good stuff.  I made this awhile back following the recipe exactly and thought it was too spicy.  This time a only added 1/2 can jalapenos and loss cayenne.  I think I could have used all the jalapenos and would have been fine.  It is definitely the cayenne that gives it the heat, so reduce that if you don't want to set your stomach on fire (although my boyfriend would have loved it with all the heat).

This is so delicious!  I don't use as much jalapenos as the recipe calls for and I go a little light on the cayene and it is still very spicy, but not so spicy we can't eat it.  I omit the cheese because I'm on the never ending diet and you really do not miss it at all.  I puree 2 of the cans of white beans because we like our chili thicker.  Fabulous!  I make it all of the time now.  Thank you!

I tend to use recipes as guidelines and means of inspiration so I almost never follow them exactly. So, while I made my own adjustments I'd still say this recipe is an amazing base and guideline for the perfect "white" chili.

This was delicious!  I love white chili but had to make it with a purchased mix because I did'nt know how to make from scratch.  This is easy and tasty.  I only used 1/2 can of jalapenos and it was just right. My husband and son took seconds and emptied the pot!

Sheesh, what else can I say about this?  It's delicous!  I had to sautee the onions/garlic then add the chilis and jalapenos and the beans and then I puree EVERYTHING in the blender.  My loving boyfriend doesn't eat "chunks" but if I blend it he's none the wiser!  Actually, I think I would prefer it this way even if I didn't live with Mr. Picky.  It made the chili very rich!  I also pureed with it some Salsa Verde for fun.  YUMMO!

This chili is a hit! I don't like a lot of spice so I didn't add the jalapeños. I added about an eighth of a cup of Franks red hot to give some added flavor. I also added a little extra chicken. It was even better the next day after all the flavors had time to stew.

Great amount of heat.  We killed it.  A little soupy though.  Next time we'll go with a can of cream of chicken instead of one of the broth cans.  Thanks Cathy!

I love this recipe. I use fresh jalapeno's and fresh green chiles I've roasted and frozen each year.  Adds so much more flavor than the can.  I love spicy food and think it is great!  If I have company I cut back on the spices or make a batch with milder chiles.  It freezes great but beware, it gets a little spicer.

Subbed green chilies for the Jalapeno.  Still spicy but could be spicier.  Add flour to thicken

I really liked it, but with modifications.  I eliminated the jalapenos, half the cumin and cayenne, added corn, and sour cream and tortilla chips at the end.

Delicious - Cut out the jalepenos. Used 3/4 of can diced chiles and half the cumin & cayenne pepper.n Mashed 1 of the 3 cans of beans and substituted a can of broth for a can of cr. chicken soup.  After onion, etc was sauted, I threw everything in the crock pot on high including the uncooked chicken breasts for 3.5 hours.  Took the chicken out - shredded it and out it back in the crock pot for 1/2 hour.  Perfection!

I made this tonight for dinner.   My husband even ate it, and he doesn't like red chili.   I omitted the jalapeno peppers and used 2 cans of chopped chiles instead.  I did mash up one of the cans of beans for texture.

YUM!  I used a 5lb chicken and it's broth.  I soaked a bag of dried navy beans.  I used the larger can of diced green chiles. I added lots of black pepper and sea salt.  We sprinkled each bowl with shredded Monterey Jack.  What a great way to get some healthy organic chicken broth in my babies! YUMMY!!

This was good. I did add extra cumin and some fresh cilantro from the garden. I also mashed half the beans because it was too soupy for me. We had it with a dollop of sour cream on top. I think next time I will add more spices. Thanks for the recipe... it's a great base white chili!

A lovely white chicken chili. Based on others' comments, I only added about 1/3 -1/2 of the broth to make it less soupy. A few comments: the jalapeno bite was very nice but the flavor behind it didn't offer as much depth as I like in my chili. The added cheese and cilantro (both as garnish) helped but it was still one dimensional.  I made this and the "meatiest vegetarian chili" for a crowd and the flavors in my vegan option beat this chili hands down. A nice alternative, but not a blue ribbon option.

Just make this recipe as directed.  You don't need to add cream of chicken soup or anything to thicken it.  It thickens because of the beans.  It's a spicy chili and that's what makes it so wonderful. I did add some frozen corn, just because. My husband and myself love it.  I use this recipe everytime I want a white chicken chil.

Spicy hot but so good.  We cool it down with a little sour cream on top.  Perfect for winter...and for a crock pot!

Really tasty. Used 2 cans of green chilis instead of jalapenos. Also pureed some of the beans to thicken into more of a chili and less of a soup as was recommended by pervious users.Thanks!

This was great for a chilly January day. I did not add the canned jalapenos, but subbed another can of green chilies, as I was feeding this to an eight and two year old. Also, I only added a couple of shakes of  cayenne pepper. As other reviewers suggested, I waited unil I had put the soup in bowls before garnishing with the Monterrey Jack cheese and a dollop of sour cream. Very good with the Basic Corn Muffins recipe also from this site.

I made this for my girlfriend on ended up apologizing for having subjected her to it. As made, it's bland. I used serranos and fresh jalepenos, and once you get through the spice, there is nothing to it.

My husband and I love this recipe.  I have also shared it with my grown children and they love it too.  We think the spice and "bite" are just right.  When my son made it, he thought it was too runny.  I realized that I cook it longer than 15 minutes so the whole chili thickens up a bit more and all the flavors blend and deepen.  I probably cook it for about 30 minutes.

Wonderful white CHILI, not soup, if you make a few changes: used 1/2 lg. onion, 1 can 30% less sodium chicken broth, 1 bottle beer (Bells Winter White today), no jalapenos (didn't have any), meat of one rotisserie chicken with skin removed (too salty otherwise), puree one of the cans of beans.  Other ingredients not listed were the same.  Near end I added about 4 oz. low fat cream cheese and about 4 oz. low fat sour cream.  Served with a dallop of sour cream, cheddar cheese, and Fritos.  Excellent!

This recipe was good but like the others said its to hot.  I didn't use jalepeno peppers and still found it to be hot.  Next time I will decrease the cumin.  I also added diced tomatoes with green chile peppers.

I made the whole thing from scratch so I could control the sodium. I made the chicken stock and then de-boned the chicken and used that for the chili. I also used dry beans instead of canned. I'm not a big fan of the jalepenos, so I used just one can of the green chilis. I was also out of cumin and cayenne so I improvised with a dash of chili powder and some cinnamon (hey, I was desperate!) and the oregano. I also used 8 cups of chicken stock and twice the amount of beans and chicken. The overall result is mild enough that my three small children gobbled it up and yummy enough that I really enjoyed it! I think I would like it a thicker "chili" type consistency so next time I will try the previous suggestion of pureeing several cups and I also cut back on my chicken stock. I served it with homemade cornbread and it was a HUGE hit! What a delicious, VERSATILE recipe!

This is one of our favorite chili recipes! My boyfriend and I like our food spicy so we throw in 2 cans of jalapenos and omit the green chilies since I'm not a big fan. I also about 2/3cup of corn and 1/2 cup more cheese. It's a staple in our recipe list!

Here's an endorsement if ever there was one.  After ooh-ing and ah-ing over his first few bites, my husband said he would stand in line and take abuse from the soup nazi for this.  I changed it up a bit which helped with the "ugly" factor that some reviewers mentioned.  I sauteed cubed raw chicken breast in olive oil and then added the onions, etc.  Because I had them on hand, I also used chopped celery, red, green and orange bell pepper in addition to the canned chilies.  I used fresh jalepeno rather than canned.  I had half a can of diced tomatoes left from a meal this week so dumped those in.  I also started with dry beans and soaked and cooked them myself rather than using canned, so I left some of the liquid on the beans and added chicken base paste rather than using the canned broth.  At serving, I followed someone's suggestion and crushed some tortilla chips in the bottom of the bowl, used cheddar and jack cheese to garnish,along with a dollop of sour cream and just a few sprinkles of fresh chopped cilantro.  We loved it and will certainly make again.  It wasn't ugly at all by the time i was finished with the make-over.

This is the best Chili, it even tops my dad's, although he would never admit to that. 
I threw all of the ingredients in a crock pot, including three whole chicken breasts. I cooked it on low for about 7 hours and right before I served it, I shredded the chicken (not that it needed it much, it just fell apart! FANTASTIC!

This recipe rocks.  I have made it several times.  The only thing I do different is puree 1 1/2 cans beans and leave the other 1 1/2 cans whole.  It makes it nice and thick.  Also, I don't mix the cheese in...I just sprinkle some on top at the end.  Other than that it is a great recipe...just adjust the hot peppers to taste.  Remember you can always add more, but you can't take them away.

Now this was AWESOME. Followed recipe modifications recommended by others and reduced the jalepeno and cayene pepper.  Was more than warm enough. The left overs keep well and really flavor up in the fridge.

I have made this several times now and love it! I followed the recipe very closely - and it was perfect... after simmering for about a half hour the flavors blended perfectly- Despite the peppers and cayenne it was not too hot at all (although maybe I'm not the best judge, since we do like a lot of peppers..) THis recipe is perfect for SOuth BEach dieters- including Phase I I'll be making this often! Thanks for a great recipe!

This was quite good and very fast to make. I too modified the recipe to suit my family's tastes. I used two cans of beans, mashing 1/2 can to thicken the chili, used only 2 oz of chopped jalapeno's, and added 1/2 cup of half & half at the end. I will definitely make this again.

This is FABULOUS!  A great alternative for a big crowd.  We had a bears party and served this along with a pot of "regular" chili and this was a tremendous hit.  I would consider it more of a tortilla soup than a chili.  Either way it is AWESOME!

This chili is awesome. The recipe makes much more than four servings. I had a whole crockpot full.

To get a more white chili, I slowly added about a 1/2 to 3/4 cup of ranch dressing to the mix once it was simmering. I also added a little bacon bits.

Also, take one of those 15 onunce cans of white beans and mash it up into a paste. This help thicken the chili.

This was VERY good! I browned the chicken in a pan and then cubed it and put it in a crock-pot. I also followed some suggestions of others: used cornstarch to thicken and pureed one can of beans. I also had most of the jalepeno as a "side" item as well as the cheese. I will be making this again!

Unbelievable flavor for so little effort.  Per other suggestions, I mashed 1 can of beans with a fork; I left out all the hot stuff, subbed 3/4 of a large jalapeno, sliced very thinly, fried up with the onion, and 1/4 tsp red pepper flakes.  Added one small can salsa verde. Used 2 cups water and 2 bouillon cubes in place of broth.  Used a precooked store bought chicken.  Wonderful recipe, very very quick and so delicious we were amazed!  Thanks!

This is the only chili recipe that we eat in our house. I add a plate of condiments to the table when I serve it with cilantro, extra grated jack cheese, black olives, green onion and extra jalapenos for those who want tospice it up! My friens rave about this recipe.

Great white chili - I used fresh jalapeno instead of canned, 1 can of chicken broth and pureed one of the cans of beans as a thickener. Simmered for longer, nice if you have the time but probably not necessary. Top with sour cream and cilantro served with flour tortillas.  YUMMY

Fantastic!  Make sure to puree an additional can of beans to thicken up the mixture, and cut out one can of broth.  I omitted the jalapenos and it still had a nice, delectable kick to it.  Sauteed the chicken with the spices and garlic, onions, and chiles, then combined it with the bean mixture.  Served with hot french bread on a cold rainy day- a big hit at my house!

I love this!  I make it in my slow cooker and it is always a hit!  I somtimes play around with the green chilis and jalapeno depending on who I am serving it for!

I do find it to be a little on the watery side, so I have to cook it for a long period of time in the slow cooker.  One of those great recipies you can put in the night before.

Very good!  I did this in the crock pot and cooked on for several hours.  I left the lid off for the last hour trying to thicken it up.  I had tried just pureeing one can of beans like everyone said, but still thought it was too soupy.  We like more solids than broth.  I ended up putting in a fouth can of beans to make it thick enough to suit.  I also left out the jap's entirely and it's mild enough for even our light-weight pallets.  Will definately make this again.

I've been making this 10 years, since I first found it on AllRecipes.com. Buy a pre-cooked roaster chicken (I like BBQ or Sam's Club flavors), remove the meat, rough chop and set aside 'til needed, then cover bones, skin, etc. in water and create broth from it while you're cooking the onion mixture. The seasonings from the roaster chicken give it an added depth of flavor. Fill a discarded bean can with the broth (it's 14.5 oz) twice and add to your mixture. Also, I only use 2 oz jalepenos, and double up on the cheese. Enjoy!

HOT! HOT! HOT!  Too darn hot! But if you must make it be sure to use cannellini beans, drain 'em and rinse 'em.  I thought it was too spicy to really enjoy the flavors.  But my husband enjoyed it.  No way I'd serve it to kiddies.  If you aren't sure I'd suggest serving the jalapenos on the side. I used half and was still overwhelmed.  I like spicy foods but this wasn't for me, sorry Cha-Cha!

Very good. I used a can of cream of chicken soup with the broth to thinken a bit. I also mashed some of the beans. If the chicken is diced pretty small this makes an excellent dip for tortilla chips.

I have rated this chili before but have just won 2nd place in a chili cookoff with this in Cincinnati!  The judges thought it was good enough to take 1st place but I was the only white chili entry and was named 2nd instead.  Thanks again for the recipe!

I agree that this is more of a soup.. but it was excellent.  I did not use any cheese and used a premade rotisserie chicken from the grocery store.

Oh my, this recipe is fantastic! As "bad" as it is, we add even a bit more cheese to thicken it up a bit, and top with some sour cream, and every time I make it I wish I had doubled the batch!  Thanks much, Cathy, we love it at our house!!

Overall, I think this is a good recipe, but I only used 1/4 teaspoon of cayenne pepper and it was still VERY spicy. I'll cut down on the jalapenos next time, too. It was kind of soupy, so I added crushed fritos to thicken it up a little.

this was so hot i nearly burned a hole in my tongue.  i even diluted it with an extra can of chicken broth and it was still way too hot.  i would recommend leaving out the cayenne pepper or the jalapenos, or both, because this is wayyyyy too hot.

This was great Chili! I made it for 3 friends and one of them made it for a couple of friends the next day. I used a fresh Poblano in place of the jalapenos and forgot the cheese. I didn't measure the spices, just added them until it tasted right. One friend said it tasted like it needed something, which may have been cheese, sour cream or salt. I also used the water I boiled the chicken breast in for the broth and added soup base to taste. This will definitely join my repetoire!!

I absolutely LOVED this recipe!  I didn't follow the recipe exactly...  I love spicy food so I added additional jalapenos, I also cooked the chicken in the slow cooker all day while I was at work and just shredded it and added it that way.  I didn't measure how much I used...more chicken is always better! :)

Just made this and it was awesome. Didn't have time to put in crockpot so I made it on the stove. Didn't have jalepenos so used 2 cans of green chiles. Also, put everything together on low except the chicken and ran to Costco to get a rotisserie chicken. Came home, shredded it and put in pot at 5. Let it simmer some more and ate it at 6. SOOO GOOD!!!!!!  Husband loved it.

I used fresh serrano peppers rather than canned jalapenos. Good started recipe but I think next time I will roast some tomatillos, blend them with cilantro, onion and garlic and add it to the chili. This will add more depth and more flavor.

12 cups... I added a can of corn, added a can of cream of chicken, used all mild green chilies instead of jalapenos (it came out perfectly spiced), and threw everything into the crockpot on high for 4 hours. I hand-shredded the chicken at the end and put it back in. Delicious! Oh, and I also pureed one can of the white beans and that really helped to thicken things up.

YUM!!  I am kind of wimpy when it comes to spicy food, but I was making this for my boyfriend who loves, LOVES spicy food. He likes to turn red and break a sweat when he eats (very weird). So I used the full amount of cayenne, but I used chopped FRESH jalapeños. I must be missing something when everyone says it's so hot. I didn't think it was even the slightest bit spicy. Maybe is was because of the fresh jalapeños. So I added more cayenne and still didn't think it was hot. I broke out a jar of jalapeño slices and put about 1/4 cup in the food processor and chopped them up. It's perfect for me, but I know it won't be spicy enough for him. But it's sooo super good.  I also puréed some of the beans and that was a great idea, thanks to all that recommended it. I made naan to eat it with. I'm so pleased with myself!  :-)  this stuff is awesome. I must be building up a tolerance to spicy food though. Great recipe. Oh, and yes.. The longer it sits, the better it is. All the flavors really combine.

The author of the recipe states it is pretty spicy and if you want a milder version cut back on the jalapenos.  A teaspoon of cayenne is quite a bit.  I reduced the cayenne and increased the green chilies with excellent results.  The flavor was more like a Navajo-style green chili stew made with chicken instead of pork.  On a second batch substituted chicken thighs for the breast with excellent results.

Even my picky teenager loved this!  I left the cheese to sprinkle on top and served over noodles.  I didn't think it was too spicy, but it was a little thin, so I think I'll try the pureed beans tip.

This is so good! The reviews are right, this is quite spicy! I followed the recipe almost exactly with only a couple of changes. I used my own home made chicken broth, I minced the garlic, and I didn't have canned jalapenos, so I diced up a fresh one, ribs, seeds, and all. I only used two cans of white northern beans, and I took a potato masher to them to give a little thickness to the chili. I have to say that I didn't cook the onions or anything else first. I just took all the ingredients and put them in the crock pot. It's been so warm here that I didn't want to even turn on the stove. I just took the crock pot to a downstairs room, plugged it in, set it to low and closed the door. Six hours later, supper time, and it was done! I used rotisserie chicken breast and I left out the cheese. It was just awesome! Spicy and so full of flavor I don't think there was room for any more! This would be great, even without the chicken! I think it might have something to do with the absence of chili powder, honestly I don't think it needs it, and would probably not help at all. Cilantro might be good in this though, and maybe sour cream for cutting the heat, if that's the way you roll. This is the best chicken chili recipe I've ever used! Thank you!

I make this all the time. I leave out the jalapenos, just because I am a wimp. I put it all together except for one can of beans and use my hand blender right in the pot. It thickens the soup to look cream based without the dairy. Then I add the last can of beans. LOVE IT! I also leave out the cheese since I don't do dairy. Thanks for sharing.

This is now my favorite chili recipe.  Just keep in mind that they aren't joking about the standard recipe being spicy.  If you want more of a medium spice, you might want to swap the jalapenos for green chilies or reduce the cayenne.

Also, it won 2nd place at a work chili cookoff this year.

I add extra broth, extra chicken, extra cheese and sub 1 can of green jalapenos for red jalapenos.  I also add one small bag of frozen corn, 2 roasted red peppers (from jar and diced) and a dash of cinnamon to give it a hint of sweet before the heat.  I mix it all together and simmer for an hour (except for the cheese) and then refrigerate for at least 1 day to let the peppers marinate throughout.

There is a pub up north that's known for their white chicken chili. This tastes just like it and I make this recipe a lot. I don't always use the jalapeños. Usually I'll do two cans of the chiles. Every else is the same and I serve it with tortilla chips.

This was great! I doubled the chiles and halved the cayenne, and it was spicy enough to make us sniffle, but still had great flavor from the peppers. Will definitely make this again!

This chili was a nice change to ordinary soups/chili. I doubled the servings to 8 and only put in 3 cans of chiles and no jalapenos. It ended up being the perfect spice.

I made this for my co-wokers for a chili cookoff.  I never dreamed that my crockpot would be the first one emptied!  As other reviewers have noted, I pureed some of the beans to give the soup a thicker texture.  This is a keeper!

I made this with a couple of substitutions. I didn't have canned jalapeno peppers, but added a couple of pinches of dried jalapeno peppers.  I also added a couple of ounces of white wine and omitted the cheese. This was fabulous! I made my cornbread and had it for lunch and for dinner! Will definitely make this again! Thanks, Cathy!

This won my neighborhood's chili cookoff.  Here are my shortcuts:  Buy Perdue Chicken "Shortcuts" in Southwest flavor--dice and use.  In addition to the 3 cans of beans, add another can of white beans but pureed--adds great thickness.  I always throw in a little extra cumin too.  Great for a football game or a healthy lunch, best recipe on this site!!!

Awesome! I have made this several times and it is always a hit! We had a chile cookoff at work and I won with this recipe. Not fond of lots of spice so I do cut the cayenne to 1/4 teas and eliminate the pepper as well.  Also use rotisserie chicken which adds lots flavor.

Wow.  This is amazing.  I had about 1/2 of a cooked oven stuffer roaster that I was looking to repurpose.  I tried to stay true to the recipe but though I LOVE spicy food, I toned it down a bit for my family by leaving out the jalapeños and just using canned chilis.  I always try to sneak more veggies in so when i turned off the stove, i stirred in the zucchini and let it stand covered for about 15 minutes. i need to avoid dairy so i didnt stir the cheese in but rather topped the bowls with Colby jack.   as i was making it, i was tasting and thought it was really good.  i tasted after adding the cheese and the cheese takes it from great to completely amazing.  i will be making this again - CHA CHA CHA!

Simple, spicy, delicious. 

No need to add salt (broth, beans, cheese provide enough). Two cans beans is plenty, so is 1/4 teaspoon cayenne. Used white onion for a Mexican touch. Simmered two chicken breasts in broth with a few chunks of onion before chopping chicken and to remaining ingredients along with the broth the breasts had simmered in. 

Added 1 heaping T masa harina before last 15 minutes of cooking to lightly thicken the sauce. Stirred in 3 T chopped fresh cilantro just before serving. 

Instead of mixing in the cheese, topped individual bowls with 1/4 cup cheese and a few tortilla chips for texture. Served with cold Corona and lime. My husband loved it. So did I.

Wow!  I'm a big red chili fan, so I was really skeptical while I put this together.  But my very picky 18 y/o brother ate several bowls!  I garnished with the cheese, sour cream, and cilantro.  Wouldn't really change anything, I loved it!

We loved this recipe! It was so easy to make and definitely will make again. I did do some of the recommended changes. I cooked the chicken breasts in a pan with ranch dressing packets. I used one 7 oz green chilis and didn't use the jalapeños since my family doesn't like things too hot.  I used low sodium broth and a can of cream of chicken. I  put in a can or two of tomatoes with mild green chillis.  I did grind up one can of beans to make a little thicker. I  added one can of hominy too for a little added flavor and a can of corn too. I let it simmer for a few hours and then I  topped the chili with a little bit of cheese on top of each bowl.  Everyone LOVED it!!
Mexican corm bread was a good addition to the meal too. Thanks!

This is an outstanding recipe.  Healthy, easy to make, and tastes great.  I've made it a zillion times, and have found the following modifications to be helpful:  I use two cans of diced green chilis and skip the jalapenos.  I also use 1 tsp. of chili powder instead of the cayenne.  It still has a kick with these changes, and you can always turn up the heat in each bowl with Tabasco.  I add the chicken broth last and only add as much as necessary to get a good, thick consistency.  Assuming you don't drain your beans, using all the broth will result in chili that is more like soup (unless you boil it down).  I brown the chicken (using ample salt, pepper and oregano to flavor) and saute the onion/spices separately, then throw everything together into the crock pot and let it simmer for a long time.  I often add chunks of sausage to change up the flavor and texture.  I do not add the cheese, but rather sprinkle a little on top before serving.  To improve the presentation (it can look a little like gruel), I serve with cheddar cheese, sour cream, chopped cilantro and sometimes a bit of chopped red bell pepper.  Yum! A definite crowd pleaser.

I make this all the time and love it. I follow many of the suggestions. I like things pretty spicy, but I put in a quarter of the cayanne and work up from there. Also to get it creamier I will mash up one of the cans of white beans(drained) and depending on how healthy I am wanting it, I wil add varrying amounts of cream cheese, sour cream and\or plain yogurt. I will also sub out one can of white beans for black and add it in a can of corn. I double the recipe and freeze for later. I never review anything but I use this so much I felt I needed to

I love this chili! I've been making it with this recipe for years, and I don't change much.  If you're feeding people who don't handle spice well, skip the jalapenos and use a double sized can of chiles. I also shred the chicken instead of cubing it.  It's a more pleasant texture, even if it does take a little bit longer.  Making it for a dinner and board game party tonight. Mmm...

Delicious!  A big hit with everyone.  I used half of a chicken in place of chicken breasts.  I boiled the chicken for about 2 hours, skin, bones and all, to make my own chicken stock.  Then, I picked the chicken clean.

I love spicy food so I thought this was awesome!  I added extra cayenne and used red peppers and green chiles in addition to jalepenos.  I topped each bowl with pepperjack cheese.  I didn't wanted to add the cheese to the entire pot because I knew we'd have leftovers.

So good! Definitely cut back on the cayenne and jalapenos, I did and it was still pretty spicy. I didn't have onions so I used 6 tbsp of minced, I also didn't have garlic cloves so I used 1 1/2 tsp of minced. I pureed two of the cans of beans just to make it a little thicker. I also added 2 tbsp of sour cream to cut the heat down a little and cooked it on med-high to start then reduced it to low and cooked for a couple hours stirring occasionally. Don't forget the cornbread!!

Fantastic! The other reviewers are right... this stuff is spicy! But that is exactly how we like our chili. The chicken broth I used was very low sodium and organic. I love that this recipe doesn't call for salt, and it doesn't need it! I like a thicker chili so I cut down on the broth and added a tsp of corn starch to thicken it up. I also used two fresh jalapenos instead of the canned chilies. I think that it's the cayenne that makes this dish so wonderfully spicy! I also added a can of Rotel tomatoes and a can of regular diced tomatoes. For the beans I used cannellini, Great Northern, and pinto. I added some chopped cilantro at the end. I will definitely make this again! Thank you for sharing!

Used a 7oz can of green chiles, and left out the jalapenos and cayenne (because I was feeding several children).  I pureed one of the cans of beans.  FABULOUS!  Very tasty!

I think this was a good recipe, I added McCormick WCC seasoning 1 pack per /4 servings.  Also made meatballs with ground chxn, doubled the cheese.  I think it.would be good to try with sour cream and tortilla chips.

This chili tastes so good. We skipped the jalapenos since we didn't have them.  The green chiles gave it enough spice.  We only had a monterey cheddar mix for the cheese, and it was great.  This recipe is a keeper.

YUM! I omitted jalapenos, and only had 1 can of beans, but enough to serve 4 still. Depth of flavor was awesome for a slow cooker meal. Served over tortilla chips with cheese on top.

I'd give it 2 1/2 if I could. My husband and I agreed that we would change several things if we had the chance -- add some veggies (bell peppers, carrots, celery are some ideas) and reduce the amount of onion. As is, it was average-tasting and overly populated by onions.

This is delicious and has a great amount of spice! I did have to change it up a bit based on what I had in the house - I used a can of tomatoes & chilies instead of the canned chiles and jalapenos. I sliced up jarred jalapenos and added them, along with some of the juice. I even added more cayenne pepper! I only used one can of beans. So tasty - and great with the tomatoes.

This was pretty good, except it was still a bit spicey even after I omitted the jalepeno peppers and chile peppers. Maybe cut down on the cayenne pepper. I used 4 cooked chicken breasts.

I have been forever using McCormick white chicken chili seasoning packet, now I don't have to! This is a real good recipe! After reading other reviews about how spicy it is, I used two cans of chopped green chilies, not diced jalapeno peppers at all. I used 2 full sized chicken breast, diced then sauteed. I used only 2 cans of white beans. I made me own low-sodium chicken broth (approx 3-1/2 cups), I rinsed and drained the beans to try to remove as much of sodium. I added 2 tablespoons of masa harina to thicken it. This is really good!

I had leftover chicken to use and leftover navy beans in the freezer, so I looked for something using those ingredients and came across this...loved it!  While this is not a kid-friendly meal, for my family (the 4-year old didn't like the way it looked and therefore wouldn't touch it), the adults in my life raved about it.  The only real change I made was to add green peppers, onions & omit the jalapeno peppers & chile peppers...I'm a fan of allowing others to determine their heat level.  I added minimal red pepper and for many that was just enough.  I will make this for pot lucks and/or for myself when the kids are away.  Thanks!

Easy and delicious.  I used double the amount of green chiles and no jalapenos because my kids would complain.  I plan to make a batch with the hot stuff this weekend though.  I also added about 2 teaspoons of lime juice.

We weren’t as thrilled with this as I had hoped.  And as written this is more like chicken and bean soup, not like any chili I'm familiar with.  I took some ideas from other reviewers and used two cans of diced chiles, no jalapenos and I cut back on the cayenne pepper.  My biggest regret was that I pureed one can of the beans to help thicken this up, but that gave the chili a gluey taste/texture.  I should have made a roux with flour and butter and added that to the chili to thicken it.  Oh well, maybe next time.

Dellicious!  I made a few subtle substitutions.  I used one can of cannnellini beans and pureed them to thicken the broth, and as previous reviewers suggested, halved the amount of jalapenos.  I also cut back a bit on the amount of cayenne pepper, and  amount of oregano to just over 1/2 teaspoon.  I purchased a grocery store rotisserie chicken, and cook time was a snap!  This recipe is delicious, versitle, and budget friendly.   A keeeper at my house!

My first attempt at this recipe was good but not great. I shredded the meat on a rotisserie chicken from my local grocery store instead of cooking my own. I use this for my chicken tortilla soup as well because it has a fantastic texture and melts in your mouth not to mention, it's a huge time saver. I heeded the warnings about the spice and used half the can of jalapeños and 1/4 tsp of cayenne. Next time I'll definitely kick the spice back up because the flavor fell a little flat and the chili was extremely mild. I drained all of the ingredients so that it wouldn't turn out muddy looking. I also took the advice of others and pureed 1/2 of a can of the beans to thicken the chili. I'm still on the fence about whether or not I like the texture with the pureed beans. One last addition was a can of super sweet white corn which I enjoyed. I couldn't taste the cheese melted in the soup and it didn't seem to affect the texture so instead I would suggest just adding a bit on top for more flavor and less fat.

Very good. Made with two cans of chili's and no jalapenos.  Very flavorful and just the right amount of kick.  Very tasty and simple to make.

Flavorful chili, but HOT! I only used 1/2 tsp of cayenne pepper and it was still spicy. I needed some sour cream and a milk chaser, but I'm sure my husband will love it!

I actually used 8 ounces of medium salsa verde instead of the diced jalapeno and chopped green chiles because it was what I had on hand.  Turned out great.  I only used half the cayenne pepper and it was zippy but not overwhelming.

Really really good! I've been anticipating this since summer, and it didn't disappoint.  I don't like super spicy, so I left out the jalapenos.  I did have to thicken with a little cornstarch, but it was excellent overall.

Hubby and I enjoyed this very much. I cheated and bought a Mojo rotisserie chicken and used that. I omitted the jalapeno but doubled the green chilis and added the cheese on top of each serving. Served it with sour cream and lime wedges to juice and that was really a nice addition. I wish it was a bit thicker, I added some cornstarch and that helped some. I will definately make this again.

used 2 pounds of ground turkey instead of the cubed chicken. doubled the recipe, and ended up using only 4-5 cans of beans instead of 6. also, i used fresh chiles and jalapenos. i then added more chiles a half hour before it was done cooking, as letting it simmer for 2-3 hours took most of the heat out of the peppers. simmering also allowed it to thicken a little. it was spicy, but that's the way i like it. will definitely make again when i want a different taste in chili.

This was a hit!!! A Few modifications: I used 2lbs ground chicken, cannellini beans ( white kidney beans), no jalapenos, just crushed red pepper, 5 tsp of cumin, instead of 2 and then to thicken it at the end, mixed up 2 tablespoons of cornstarch.

Really good!  Made a couple of changes: used about a pound of ground chicken rather than the chopped; used all green chilies (NO jalapeno for this wimp!); added a can of chopped tomatoes and a can of corn; used one can of chicken broth (because we like it thicker); just a pinch of cayenne (see disclaimer above); pureed one can of beans as others done; and left out the cheese.  Will defintely make this again!

Yum, we loved it.  Doubled it for my family of 7.  Added more garlic, less broth and mashed one can of the beans as others suggested.  I also did not add the can of jalepenos, did all green chilis instead.  Only put in 1/4 tsp of cayenne.  We are wuss'

This was delicious.  I took a fellow raters advice and added corn and black beans.  My family and I love spicy foods and we garnished with sliced jalapenos. Lots of heat- we really enjoy its.  Thanks for a great dish!

After reading some of the other reviews, I pureed one can of beans and added a can of black beans. My daughter is 5 and doesn't like spicy so I just stuck to using only diced green chilis, no jalapenos. I also added cilantro 'cause I had some and a dollop of sour cream on top.  Super Yummy!!  My husband isn't a big chili fan but his exact words were, "wow babe, this is the gourmet action!"  We're going to enjoy this a lot this winter!

Like most reviewers, I changed this for our tastes and mix it up each time I make this.  This time I used no oil but PAM, no garlic, one very large white onion, and an extra can of beans, which I pureed before adding. Tasted the canned jalepanos and found them to be super spicy (unusually so), so only added half of a heaping teaspoon of cayenne when I normally use the full amount.  Roasted 2 large bone-in chicken breasts with only salt and pepper and used that shredded which really brought the chili together.  Used a mixed blend of Mexican cheeses at the end and about a bean can full of water since I thought the chili was too thick.  Great recipe and one that is very easy to modify based on your family's tastes.

AWESOME! I'd give this one 6 stars if I could! Nice change from tradition chili. I have little ones so I cut the jalapenos and cayenne in half, which left just a bit of heat without making everyone gulp a cold drink between bites. The whole family loved it.

I eliminated the jalapenos and cut cayenne down to 1/2 tsp. I only used 2 cups (not cans) of chicken broth and pureed one can of the white beans to make it thicker. I only used 2 cans white beans total (including the pureed one) and added one can of black beans. I only topped each individual bowl of soup with the cheese and didn't add it to the pot directly. Top with a dollop of sour cream and chopped fresh cilantro, and this was great.

This was a fantastic recipe.  Extremely spicy so be careful if you can't take the heat.  I only put about 1/4 tsp of the cayenne pepper in and it was still very spicy.  Next time, I think the jalapenos will be good enough.  This chili isn't very thick like a normal chili, it's more of a soup, either way, delicious!!

Great recipe! I made a few modifications, based on what I had/didn't have on hand, but overall, followed the recipe as is. I was unclear whether or not to drain/rinse the beans, so I did, and it ended up a very thick and hearty chili (which is kind of the point of chili, I guess! ;)  

Really great recipe, and as others said, can definitely be modified endlessly, according to individual tastes! Thanks for sharing this!

Excellent.  I used two cans of diced chilis instead of sour cream.  I also did not stir in the cheese.  Just top it with crushed nacho chips, sour cream, chopped scallions and shredded cheese in each bowl.

I used just the chilies and it was PLENTY hot for our tastes. 
In the future I'll add some pureed beans to thicken it as others suggested per personal tastes.
Really a GREAT recipe, amazing flavor. My husband said, "This is one we HAVE to have again." 
Thank you!

i made this 3 times already! i would have given 5 stars, except for the first time i followed it exactly as written, and it was rather spicy, and a little too thin and brothy for me. so i changed it the next 2 times, and omitted the cans of broth, and changed it to a cup of water with 2 chicken bullion cubes. i also cut down the jalepenos by 75% and got rid of the cayenne, so it wasnt too spicy for me. i also added a little paprika and some salt. i topped it with shredded white cheddar, and it was so good that it made me wanna slap my momma!

I was looking forward to trying a white chili for the first time, after hearing so many people enjoy it, and figured this was the best recipe to start with ... but I'm slightly disappointed.  Aside from chicken and beans, there's nothing much to this chili.  Some spices, yes (and I don't know what people are talking about being too spicy!!), but it tastes like there's something missing.  Just tastes blah.  Or maybe I just don't like the taste of white beans and chicken together.  Hubby liked, but me, not so much.

Delicious! I reduced amounts of chiles, omitted cayenne pepper, and added paprika, chopped green peppers and sweet corn. Perfect with corn muffins!

This was so easy and delicous not to mention relatively low fat!  I made a few revisions  - I used a rotisserie chicken and shredded the meat, two cans of white beans and one cup of Trader Joe's frozen roasted corn, two cans of chilis and no jalepenos as I didn't want it too spicy.  I left out the cayanne pepper as well but added a few shakes of chili powder.  I also made a fat free crema to dollop on top - one small container of plain fat free greek yogurt, juice of 1/2 lime, a few sprinkles of cumin and chopped fresh cilantro.  So good! I will be making this a lot in the cold months.

Insanely rich, delicious, and satisfying.  Wow.  It could have something to do with using organic ingredients and making my own broth, but geez, if someone doesn't like this recipe, it's them -  not the recipe!

This is really quite good - I made it the other night. I made three changes - used a 7 oz can of jalapenos/omitted the green chili (couldn't find it), added a T of chopped cilantro and thickened with 1 T of cornstarch instead of mashing the beans. Delish - thanks for the recipe Cathy!

This is a good basic recipe, and my family enjoyed it a lot.  Nice change from regular chili.  I had to spice it up a lot to suit our tastes however.  I used more seasonings, and added pureed chipotle with a little adobe sauce.  Also, instead of the two cans of peppers I used a can of Herdez green salsa.  And I added lime juice at the end.

This was good, but a tad bit bland. It was a nice change of pace from the usual chili, and it was super quick and easy! I skipped the jalapenos and found it to be just the right amount of spicy. I did feel like it was still a bit bland though... maybe next time I will add some black beans? And I will cut the chicken broth in half so it isn't so soupy. Definitely worth making again though.

Very Nice!!  Used leftover turkey from X-mas mmmmmm  Listening to other reviews I cut back on the Cayenne, used 1/2 a tsp and it was fabulous just the right kick. I think I may try more next time.  Used green pepper, hot banana peppers, and sweet cherry peppers. 2 cans of beans and no cheese to cut some calories too.  Perfect winter Chili served with a lil sour cream.

What a great change up from the "norm". This chili was tasty, filling, easy/quick to make and relatively cheap...and when served with crackers (yes, crackers...they don't like cornbread!), went over great with my young children.   I omitted the jalapenos and just added green chiles - this was still PLENTY spicy for a younger crowd. I also only added one teaspoon of cumin, as I thought two would be overwhelming for that small of a batch of chili and I'm SO glad I did. The only other change I made was that I used a pre-shredded "mexican blend" cheese instead of just Monterey Jack. We'll be making this one again!

OMG! cut down on the japs and spices...And this is coming from a gal who loves japs, can eat them straight from the jar.  I also consider this white bean soup not chili...So substitute one can of chicken broth for cream of chicken soup or mash up a can of beans.  Otherwise the flavors are nice, just too much.  It also did not look very appealing...too much green, I would cut down the japs and green chiles by half.  I will make again, just with several modifications.

Made this with leftover turkey from thanksgiving.  For the beans, I used two cans, one white kidney beans or northern and one can navy beans with bacon. Made some adjustments based on other reviewers comments.  Used half Texas onion half green onion, 1 fresh jalepeno, and substituted chili powder and red flakes because I was out of cayenne.    Served with cornbread, a salad, and an option of toppings for the chili (fresh scallion, diced fresh jalepeno, chopped fresh cilantro, and shredded coley cheddar cheese mix)

This is a great recipe. We already knew we weren't going to want it super spicy, so we only used the chopped green chile peppers. Also, we used a variety of beans and added corn as well. It turned out really hearty and we will definitely use this recipe again in the future.

Good but not as good as my favorite white chili w/ ground turkey here in AR. Well, both has some similarities. The hubs do like this one more than me though because it has more heat.

WHOA! I made this exactly as written. They aren't lying when they say it's spicy. We really like spicy food but, whoa, this was hot. I added some cheese and sour cream on the top and it took the edge off. I'd probably cut down a lot on the jalenpeno's. :)

It was a nice change to our weekly line-up, but I will continue to try to improve a white chicken chili. The boyfriend and I decided we both prefer the traditional tomato based chili, but this is not a bad recipe to try. I made the following alterations: one fresh jalapeno instead of canned, less cayenne pepper. To make the chili a bit creamier I added a half cup of milk after I removed the chili from the heat. I served topped with sour cream, freshly chopped tomatoes, and fresh cilantro.

The best "white" chili I have had!! I almost never change a recipe before I rate it, but others saying it was thin got me a little nervous. So I only made one change. Since I always make my own chicken stock from granules, I simply added only 23 oz of water and 3 tsp of granules. I thought this worked very well. I like the heat of the dish but can see how some would not.... I would not recommend changing the peppers in the recipe at all as they give a lot of depth to the flavor. If you want it milder, I would suggest dropping the cayenne instead of the peppers (you can always add a sprinkle to individual bowels later if you have a mixed crowd). As many have said: you can also top with a dollop of sour cream to cool it down which is very good.

Edit 1-29-17: Made this again today and wanted to add a few comments. As written, the sodium is perfectly balanced imo. All I had today was low sodium chicken broth, so I had to add a bit of salt after tasting. Still delicious but not quite the same so I won't do that again. Also after reading other reviews, I added extra green chilis because we love them, but didn't notice my cans were 7 oz,  so added 14 oz total. Next time I will stick to 7 oz max, as I think this change slightly upset the wonderful balance of flavors that I love in this recipe. I still use the changes from my original review so I will stick to only those for the next time. Still this is a fabulous recipe if you like chili and so flavorful. 
---------------------------------------------------

I have made this often, and I think I prefer it to "regular" chili. I use jalapenos from a jar, only 1/2 t cayenne, and add 1 T chili powder and 1/2 t coriander for even more flavor. I don't find it to spicy at all. I also cook my own chicken rather than using canned. It's a bit soupy as I leave out the cheese, and serve it on the side along with sour cream, avocado, and tortilla chips. Definitely a 5 star, delicious recipe!!!

YUM!  I made a few changes because I wasn't looking for all the heat: I left out the jalapenos, and I used 1 t. of smoked paprika in place of cayenne. I also only used 1 t. of cumin (daughter doesn't love it).    In place of chicken breast(hubby prefers dark meat), I diced 1 lb of chicken thighs and browned them with the onions before adding the remaining ingredients.    Thank you!

Great recipe! Hubby and I loved it, and my 7 year old liked it, though she said it was a little spicy.  I didn't use jalapenos at all, just 2 cans of green chiles.  I think I went a little heavy on the red pepper.I used water and boullion cubes in place of the broth, I didn't have any broth on hand, and I couldn't find my garlic press, so I used garlic salt rather than the fresh garlic. It still turned out delicious. Will definitely make again!

i have made this recipe as-written 6-7 times and it's one of those that comes out fantastically every single time. i prefer spicy food and the 1 tsp of cayenne pepper is *almost* too much heat.  in the sake of saving time and making more servings (4 servings doesn't last long in this house!), i've made the following modifications to approximately double the recipe and save time:  1-onion 3-cloves of garlic, crushed 2-10 oz cans Ro*tel tomatoes and green chilies with the juice (use mild if you like less heat) - omit the canned jalapenos & green chile peppers 1-15 oz can of corn double the amount of cumin (4 tsp) & oregano (2 tsp) 1/2 teaspoon cayene (omit the cayenne unless you like this REALLY spicy) 3-15 oz cans of white or cannelini beans, rinsed and drained 32 oz of chicken broth 1-rotisserie chicken, skin discarded and meat shredded 1-8 oz package mexican blend cheese (~2 cups)  after cooking the onion and garlic in the bottom of a large stockpot, add all the canned ingredients, spices, broth and shredded chicken. add 2 cups shredded mexican blend cheese to entire pot and stir thoroughly prior to serving.   i love this recipe because it's done  30 minutes -- and it tastes fantastic! there's also only one pot for the husband to clean.

This was delicious!  I only added 2 cans of beans because it seemed like too much.  Came out perfect!  I will be making this again.  :)

This was awesome!  My favorite chili yet.  LOVED it and my picky husband scarfed it down too.  Made it with ground turkey as that is what I had thawed.  It still rocked!

Works well with ground pork or chicken, instead of using chicken breasts.

The recipe was so wonderful. Omitted the jalapeno and it still had a kick to it.  Added a can of Mexi-Corn.  Will definitely make again!

This has become one of my families favorite recipes, especially during the winter. If it is made by the recipe it is a little spicy for my kids but the flavor is the best. I use 2 cans green chiles for them & leave out the jalapenos but would prefer them in. I also make this in the crockpot so its ready when we get home. I still saute everthing as directed & pour it into my crock pot with all the other ingredients & let simmer on low all day long. Served with some corn bread and this is a feel good meal.

The cayenne pepper was a bit too much especially if you are going to use jalapenos as well. Cathy was right about it benig "kinda spicy"

Good recipe, but I would cut back on the number of beans the next time, and maybe puree some of them for better thickness.  Great taste and flavor!

It's the Best!  my kids usually do NOT try no dishes but they loved this.  We now make this recipe monthly.  I like mine thicker and usually add  blended cheeses  which I melt on top and top with sour cream. Yummy on cold days.

amazing!! I made mine in the slow cooker. I cooked it for about 7 hours. We had the leftovers the next day and it was even better. Next time I will add hominy for a change. I loved the simplicity of the chili!!!!

Loved all the seasonings! Yum. (My bad, I used dry beans which I had soaked - however I should have cooked them first :P before putting it together - this took a lot longer and a lot of water because of that)

This was really super good. I used 4 chicken thighs, celery, onion, carrot, garlic, blk peppercorn, and bay leaf to make the broth. I added twice the jalaps (but fresh) and fresh roasted green chilis. I didn't saute anything just threw it all in the pot at once and simmered for a few hours. Will be making this one again! We loved it!!

This was sooooo good!!! A few variations - used 1 cup chicken broth, only 1 cup white beans, added 1 can stewed tomatoes, doubled the garlic, added 1tsp chipotle chili powder, omitted the jalepeno and green pepper,  and cut the cayenne down to 1/2 tsp because I was afraid it'd be too hot for my 2yr old. It was still too spicy for him but it was FAB!! The sauce was thick and tasty. i usually buy the white chicken chili packet at my local grocer but I'm DEFINETLY adding this to my list of favs. Homemade from now on!!!!

Excellent soup.....it was a little too spicy for me though.  I will lessen the amount of cayenne next time.  I chopped up a red pepper and added it to the soup and it turned out great.  Thanks for this wonderful recipe, I will definitely be making this again!

No jalapenos here.  They aren't just hot - I don't like the flavor.  So of course it made it a different kind of spicy, and not too hot, and had a flavor all its own.  I've always liked white chili and this is a super good one!  I probably should cut back on all that fattening cheese but, well, it's good. :-)

I did it in the slow cooker with 1 can of white beans subbed out for a can of mixed pinto, kidney and black. Put 2 frozen chicken breasts in, came back after 4 hours on low and cubed them and then returned the chicken to the crock and cranked it up to high for another hour or so. Also added about 1 cup of frozen corn for the last hour. It came out really good, but I would call it more of a soup than a chili. Maybe because I used an organic cream of chicken soup which is a little thinner than the icky red label kind. I ended up thickening it some with a roux and it resembled a white chili more after that. Good flavor as written, but I added a little seasoned salt and also a ts chili powder (it's not chili without chili powder!). I used fresh jalapenos rather than canned. Served it with a dallop of sour cream, fresh chopped parsley and we crunched up tortilla chips on top.  I've been sick, and this stuff with a whole lot of tabasco is the only reason why I can actually breathe right now!

This is a great, easy white chili recipe. The entire family gave it 5 stars, including my chili-snob son. Based on other reviews, I cut the jalapeno and cayenne amounts in half and doubled the green chilis as my mother-in-law doesn't do spice. I also put 1/2 can of beans in the food processor to thicken it up a bit. It turned out terrific. Thanks for the recipe.

I make the 'wimpy' version by using double green chilis versus jalepenos and halving the cayenne but I've made this several times and it is always a hit.  My hubby prefers to add corn to his but I prefer it plain, either way it is good.

This was my first attempt at making a white chicken chili.  I really enjoyed it!!!!  I did it in the slow cooker and it was delicious!  Even better the next day as leftovers!!  We had it with cheddar cheese and sour cream on top.  I served it with "Golden Sweet Cornbread" and wow, what a hit the meal was!!!

Very good.  I added corn.  I only used a few jalapenos, because it is very hot (spicy) as other reviewers mentioned.  I browned my chicken in a skillet and then cut into cubes.  Next time I will cook the chicken in the crockpot so it has a more 'shredded' consistency.

Great recipe! I decided to make this recipe today because I had all the ingredients handy, except for the green chilies.  I reduced the cayenne powder by half and added a little chili powder for the taste and color.  I started out by sautéing the onion and garlic and then added fresh cubed chicken.  Once the chicken was done I place it in a crock pot with the rest of the ingredients (except for the cheese).  The chili cooked for about 3 hours and when I was ready to serve I added the cheese and topped each individual bowl with low fat sour cream. My husband (who hates soup) really loved this recipe and said it was a keeper!

I left out the jalapenos and cut back on the cayenne as one user suggested and even then holy mother loving spicy!!!  I figure it must have been the brand of the roasted green chiles I used, because wow, spicy!  I ended up plopping in a few spoonfuls of reduced fat sour cream and then about 4 TBS of reduced fat cream cheese to cool it off, that helped a ton, but still incredibly spicy!  However, EXCELLENT flavor! If you like spicy, this is the dish for you!

Very good. I wanted to use a crock pot and a lot of left overs so I made a few changes.  I sauted the onions, garlic and green chiles.  Then I put the seasonings (minus the cayenne pepper and jalapenos since I didn't want it spicy).  Then put all the spices adding a little extra and did 4 cups chicken (which I put the breast in and let them cook and at the end took out and cubed) and did 3 cans of beans and added a fourth that I mashed.  Let it cook on high for about 5 hours.  Yum!!!  Thanks!

Delicious! My first time making it. A neighbor made it a few weeks ago and it was awesome, so I thought I'd give it a try. I like my chili thick, and thought the 2 cans of chicken broth a little much. I did not add as much cayenne but did add my own diced tomatoes and corn. Next time I'll cut down by maybe half a can of broth. Otherwise, a hearty and delicious recipe. A dollop of sour cream and mont.jack cheese complete it perfectly.

Tried 2 times & not going to waste time trying anymore. The 1st time I made as written, but didn't like white beans & it was overpowering from the heat of the cayenne pepper & jalapeno. Last night I used different beans which worked, didn't use cayenne pepper & seeded jalapeno pepper & it was still to hot. We added sour cream so we could eat it. We like flavorful food, spicy is great, but we like it where one ingredient (jalapeno or cayenne if using) doesn't overpower everything else. We felt that the jalapeno did just that - you couldn't distinguish anything. We'll stick with regular chili or a chicken taco soup from now on. Very disappointed.

I made this over the weekend and followed the recipe exactly (except I threw in 2 cans of chopped chilis thinking one can was jalapenos but I still added a can of jalapenos)...I let it simmer on the stove on real low heat for a couple of hours, just because I was busy and then tried it...It was incredible!!!! It was even better the next day as leftovers.....

This was wonderful!  I only put in part of the heat because I don't like it too spicy.  My boyfriend sprinkled his with dried peppers so he got his the way he likes it...very hot.  I thickened it by swirling around my hand held blender for about 30 seconds while it cooked.  I tried to make it as light as possible by cooking the vegetables in broth instead of oil and I didn't use cheese at all.  It was very good!

I can't really review this recipe because I made changes and it wouldn't be fair either way to review a recipe I didn't follow. I just wanted to thank you for the great jumping off point. I used what I had on hand, chicken breast tenders, great northern beans and chicken broth. I simmered the tenders and chopped onions in the broth with some cumin, basil, oregano, garlic, salt and pepper until the chicken was cooked. I cut it up and added 2 cans of beans then an additional can of navy beans that I mashed as a thickener. I served it with corn bread and it was a hit. Thanks again. I'm sure your version is great. I'll try it when I have the ingredients.

I made this for my son's birthday this weekend.  I got rave reviews...it is definately a nice change from a standard chili.  I made the soup the night before and added everything but the cheese.  Once it was heated through, I put in refridgerator and then in the morning I put everything in a crockpot added the cheese and heated until cheese had melted.  I will definately make this again.

Great alternative to regular chili!  I wish there was a 4.5 star rating.  I love this recipe and so does my husband, but I have to tweak it a little to get it right for us.  I've made this many times over the last couple years and the first couple of times, it was way too spicy, but we liked it enough to try it again (and again).  I use fresh instead of canned jalapenos (one or two, depending on size) and take out the membranes and most of the seeds when I mince it up.  I also cut back on the cayenne pepper - using about 1/2 tsp (maybe a little more).  And I don't like to stir in the cheese (other reviewers' advice too) in the pot, but let each person put some on top.

Delish! I followed others recommendations and eliminated all things spicy. No chili powder, no peppers. My husband can't do spice and without those ingredients it was perfect.

This is by far the simplest and quickest chicken chili I've tried, and we loved it. I wimped out and omitted the jalapenos on the first try, but they'll be in there next time. (Along with dry beans instead of canned if I plan ahead.) We also left out the cheese, which made this a very low fat and high protein dish. Thanks!

This is wonderful. I made a few modifications: No jalapenos, 2 cans of green chilies instead. I was out of cayenne, so I added red pepper flakes and some Louisianna hot sauce. I used a 32 oz box of chicken broth and 48 oz jar of great northern beans. Added a whole bag of shredded jack cheese (2 cups). Also, I added about a cup of half and half. The soup was delicious!

after reading many reviews, I made the following changes for texture and spice:

- boiled 2 bone-in chicken breasts with red pepper flakes and cummin then shreaded the night before
-substituted 3/4 cup of half & half for 3/4 cup chicken broth (creamier texture)
-blended then added an additional can of beans (thickness)
-did NOT rinse beans and included syrup from can (also helped with thickness)
-substituted 2/3 of a fresh jalepeno
-omitted cayenne pepper (between the red pepper flakes in the chicken and the jalepeno, this was just slightly hotter than mild)
-ganished with additional cheese and about 1/4 cup of fresh chopped cilantro

It was a big hit and definitely one worth making again!

Wow! Yeah, spicy. But my hubby & I love spicy. We both prefer the texture of shredded chicken in soups, so I put the chicken in the soup pot with 2 quarts of water and a dash of salt, dash of cayenne, and dash of cumin, and let it simmer at medium for an hour. Then I pull it apart. Set the chicken aside, discard the cooking water (not as flavorful as the chicken stock will be) and follow the recipe from there.

Wonderful!  My kids who HATE chili, loved this!  I cut the cayenne pepper in half and omitted the jalepenos and it still had a kick to it.  Add a little sour cream and cheese to your bowl and it tones down the spices just perfect!!  I will be making this for the whole family this holiday season!!

Made a few changes to use what I had on hand and to adjust for my wimpy family. I didn't use any chili's or jalapeno and it was still spicy probably because I only used one can of broth because we don't like it runny.  So, I added 4oz of sour cream and 4oz of cream cheese. I threw in a few diced tomatoes I had and some cilantro and cheddar cheese instead. It was very good and creamy.

i  made this recipe one night because i was having a lot of company over. i was unsure that it would please everyone because of its spice. we added some sour cream to it and it chilled it out enough for everyone to enjoy it. i also found you can puree some beans, add alittle more cheese and use a boullion instead of chicken broth and it thickens right up. mmm so good! i cannot wait to make it this evening for our office halloween party, wicked white bean chili!

Yummy, good comfort food on a cold day. I was scared of the spice that some reviewers complained about, so I cut out the jalepenos and doubled up on the green chiles. Next time, I will use the jalepenos. It seemed that it was missing something so I added ground coriander, chili powder and a couple of dashes of Tabasco. I also used a whole rotisserie chicken, shredded, per other reviews.  Next time I will definitely use cubed breasts. The rotisserie made it too salty and it just fell apart into tiny strings, making the chili look a little like mush soup. It is tasty though.

This chili is a staple in our house.  My husband and I buy a rotisserie chicken once a week and I use the left over chicken for this recipe.  I substitue cilantro for the oregano and puree one can of the beans.  I also only add about 1 tbs each of the chili and jalapeno (and freeze the rest).  I just add the cheese as a garnish to lower the calorie/fat content a bit.

This was awesome!  Glad I read some of the other reviews; I took their advice and pureed one can of beans & only used one can of broth to make it thicker.  Wanted to make something spicy, and this definately did the job.

I made this when my church was serving dinner to a parent support group -- everyone brought their own variety of chili.  This was the one families kept coming back for and requesting!  I reduced the amount of jalepenos... a real keeper, I need to make this again soon!

Oh, so good. I did what a few of the others suggested. I put half the beans with the onions, garlic, peppers and some of the broth in a blender and pureed it. It thickens the  chili and my family loved it.

This is a good recipe for a unique chili.  I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil and omitted the jalapenos because I didn't have any and used two cans of chilies instead.  Delicious and different.

Great recipe!! Ready in 30 minutes! I boiled chicken tenders for the cooked chicken it calls for. Made the recipe as written except I added a little extra chicken stock and a little bit of milk to take away some of the kick. The milk also gave it more of a creamy look. Stirred  sour cream and cheese into individual bowls, not the whole pot like it calls for. Also added avocado, cilantro, and lime juice to the bowls. It was so yummy and my Fiance said we needed to put this recipe in the "Make Again" pile. :-) Served it with cornbread muffins.

Loved it!!  

I gave this 4 stars only because I did make a few changes like a few other reviews suggested.  I pureed one full can of the beans, obmitted the jalapeno, upped the green chile to 7oz and instead of cayenne pepper I added only 1/2 tsp of chili powder (because that's what I had on hand).

I will make this again and again and again...

My family really enjoyed this.  I followed other reviewers' advice and omitted the jalapenos but used 2 small cans of chopped green chilis instead, only a sprinkle of red pepper and added a can of corn.  Used left-over turkey breast as well. The spice level was just right for us though my husband sprinkled his with a tad more red pepper. We even forgot to add the cheese, but it was still wonderful and marvelously low fat! Delicious!

Extremely hot!  I did half the cumin, half the chile pwd and 1/2 tsp of jalapenos and it was still quite hot.

I cooked the chicken in 1 qt of water along with 1/2 a diced onion, salt, and diced carrots and celery and shredded it when fully cooked.  I then used the liquid in place of the chicken broth and onion in the recipe.  I dumped everything into a slow cooker and let it cook on slow all day.  Wonderful!!

What a delicious change from the standard ground beef tomato based chilis. This dish is hearty and very flavorful. I had two bowls. A new favorite!

This is very good.  Very spicy, so next time I will only use 1/4 tsp. cayenne pepper.  Was almost to hot for me to eat.

This recipe is pretty good! I added julienned carrots to help take down the spiciness a notch and also to help with the bean digestion. I try to sneak in all the healthy stuff I can when I am cooking for my family.

This recipe was OK.  I have had much better White Chicken Chili before.  I did make some other changes as other poster's said.  But still not impressed.  We wont make this recipe again.  We will continue to look for a better recipe.

This is a spectacular recipe....for soup. As a big chili buff, I could not bring myself to call it chili when served as is. The next night I added 1/2 lb browned ground turkey breast, a 15oz can of drained diced tomatoes an a can of light red kidney beans. MMMMMMMMMMMM....now that's chili!!!

I have been making this dish for a few years now and just wanted to comment on how good it is. ESPECIALLY if you are watching your diet! My family loves it and I add lots of cilantro (which we love!) Super easy...I can't say enough!

This recipe is delicious. Though, as previous reviews have mentioned, it certainly isnt a chili no matter how many cans of crushed beans you add. We should just accept that its a soup. Fantastic, thanks for the recipe.

I made this in the crock pot, adding the onion and garlic raw, but the chicken was cooked. I used 1 can of diced green chilis, no jalapenos and no cayenne since I was making it for kids, too. I pureed one of the cans of beans, so it had a nice thick texture. We all liked it, and it was not overly spicy.

I just made this recipe and I love it. I, like a few others, made a few modifications. To solve the thickness problem I made a roux of 2 tablespoons butter and 2 tablespoons flour and added it with the broth. I also only added 2 cans of white beans and shredded the chicken by hand for a more homestyle effect. I served it with tortilla chips, which were very good crumbled on top. I will be making this again!!!! Thanks.

This is phenominal!  I make this a lot.  Lately, I made it for a potluck at work.  I made what I thought was way too much, however, there was nothing left!  I always serve green onions, chives, sour cream and white corn chips on the side for toppings, if desired.  Also, you can adjust the "heat" if someone likes or doesn't like the spiciness.  Thanks!
ps.  Last fall, at my new job, I won a chili cookoff with this recipe. Thanks again!

I bake the breasts the night before then just dump everything except the cheese into a crockpot and let cook all day. 

I also use 1/2 the jalapenos and double the cheese. 

I have been asked for this recipe time and time again, some friends claim they have won chili cookoffs with it.

Oh man, sooo good! I used leftovers from a roasted chicken I made last night... my boyfriend and I both loved this recipe! All the reviews about how spicy it was scared me, (my tongue is not very brave!), so I scaled it down to 1/4 tsp. of cayenne and only about 1/2 the can of jalapenos... gotta say, I could have gone a lot spicer! Next time I will use all the jalapenos, and some more cayenne. I put in about 1/4 cup more cheese, let it simmer for about 20 minutes, and served it with some cut up avocado... yum! Definitely will make again!

I left out the jalapeno and green chile on this so my kids would eat it. It's still delicious and very flavorful. This made about 6 cups, which to me equals 6 servings. The nutrition information didn't look right to me so I calculated it myself not including the cheese and it is just 216 calories per cup (not 700-something as it says) and 32 grams of protein per serving.

This recipe has been in my box forever and I can't believe I haven't rated it before now.  Whenever I make it people beg for the recipe.  I sometimes sub a can of cream of chicken soup for some of the stock to thicken it, other times I make it as is.

This is by far the best chicken chili I've ever had.   Instead of the jalapeño's, I use one fresh Serrano chile, I prefer their taste  and they don't have the burning hot taste, just the perfect flavor and heat for this chili.  Tried it once with soak your own beans and it wasn't nearly as good as using the good old fashioned canned white beans (which I drained and rinsed)!!!

We really liked this - the second night.  Right after it cooked it did not have any flavor, just the heat from the chilis.  But after it had a chance to blend over night, it was excellent.  Also, the nutrition info seems off.  There is NO way that it is just four servings, maybe 8-10.

Great recipe!  I made some minor changes, and it turned out superb!  First off, I added some diced celery to the onion, and substituted some Tabasco for the cayenne ( I was out of cayenne).  I used homemade chicken stock and added a can of low-fat cream of chicken soup while the mixture simmered.  It toned down some of the spiciness, I thought.  I only had 2 cans of beans, so that's what I used.  Thanks for the recipe!  It's a keeper!

This stuff is awesome!But if you're looking for something that tastes like beef chili this is not for you. This chili tastes like a chicken enchilada recipe I make with a  thick souplike consistency.The only changes I made were to mash one of the cans of beans at the advice of other reviewers and I added a tablespoon of cornstarch to thicken it up a bit more. We also garnished with a Monterey Jack/Cheddar cheese mix and sour cream. Delicious! Will definitely make again.

Spicy! Husband loved it ~ it was a bit too hot for me.  I made three changes ~ decreased the garlic, pureed one can of beans before adding (added some creamy texture to the soup), and increased the cheese (husband's preference).  Quick to put together & reheats wonderfully.  Will make again but will tone down the heat.

My family LOVED Cha Cha's White Chicken Chili.  The only things I did differently is cut out the jalapeno peppers, reduced the amount of green chili peppers, cumin, oregano and cayenne pepper.  Our family does not like real spicy food.  I also pureed 1/2 of the amount of white beans and this made the chili creamer.  This recipe is a "Keeper" according to my family.

This chili had great flavor!  I have a similar recipie with dried beans and was looking for a new recipie that took less time to make.  I did take the advice of other reviews and added an extra can of beans and mixed one can in the blender to make the soup thicker.  I cooked the recipie in my crockpot on low for about 5 hours and it came out perfect.  I also added approximately a cup of salsa to the recipie which adds a little more of a mexican flavor.  Great recipie!

I made a few changes.  I used one can of ckn broth, I smashed two of the three cans of beans and I added two raw chicken breast and a half of pound of smoked sausage and I let it all cook in a crockpot for several hours.  It came out very tasty.  I left out the cayenne pepper and it was still nice and spicy.  I served it over wheat rice.  I've never had white chile before but to me it tasted alot like red beans and rice only it was white beans instead. Maybe it was the way I prepared it.  Anyway my boyfried and I enjoyed it.

Forgot to say last time that I agree with the others- need to add extra beans (I added white butter beans)and more chicken breast. Also added cilantro and a dollop of sour cream and served with tortilla strips on the side! And, for those of you who haven't tried it with the Campbell's Creamy Chicken Verde Soup and canned creamed corn, I urge you to give it a whirl.  I don't think you'll be disappointed! Happy Cooking! :-)

Wow!  Spicy!  This definitely needs the cheese to temper the heat.  I used leftovers from a Costco rotisserie chicken, and only 2 cans of beans.  I also added cubed chayote squash as a variation.  It was very good.  I didn't mix the cheese into the chili, but rather served it on the side for sprinkling.  This was a definite hit and a keeper...
 ..........*note - just made this again last night, 1 can drained beans, 1 can ortega chiles, 1 can DICED TOMATOES (really added flavor!), frozen corn, chicken, onion, garlic, 1/2 can chicken broth.  It turned out really flavorful.  The tomatoes mean that it's not "white" chili anymore, but it was great!

Delicious! A nice change from regular chili. Husband's into red meat and loved it. I like boneless skinless thighs in this too. The broth is SO tasty!! I would recommend the canned broth instead of reconstituting boullion powder. (I tried it that way once.) I used a fresh jalapeno (cheaper AND more potent!)

Thanks!

This chili is awesome!  I have brought it to a few school functions and earn rave reviews everytime.  My modifications are: adding an additional can of chilies and sauteing long enough to get the heat into the chili, I also add the jalapenos in the last stage of simmering to keep most of the heat down, oddly enough.  My beans are also 1/2 drained in the can to keep some starch in the chili, but not too much.
Finally, I serve jalapenos on the side for those that want it.

Wonderful! Only gets better with time, freezes well. I simmered it in the crockpot for about 6 hours after sauteeing the onion, garlic, and chilis. I also added some green pepper. To cut back on the fat, I added a can of fat-free cream of mushroom soup instead of the cheese. (I think this also cut some of the heat for the taste buds.) Also, I added a can of corn and subbed some black beans for one of the cans of white beans. Addictive!

This dish is great and not too difficult either.  I add more garlic, jalapeno, and onion and cook it slowly over medium-low heat for 1 1/2 to 2 hours with the lid off.  This reduces the chili down quite nicely, otherwise, you'll end up with a soup.  I've shared this recipe with several others and everyone has had great results.  Enjoy!

My husband and I loved this recipe, we love very spicy food and this fit.  I added cilantro and thickened the sauce with cornstarch as it was thin. I only used 2 cans of beans and 1 3/4 cans of chicken broth. Thanks!!

wow.....this was great chili....I made it with leftover turkey from the holidays that I had cubed and frozen. I threw it all in the crockpot on high for about 5 hours. It was apsolutely wonderful. I did add extra jalapenos....and it was perfect hotness. I have a 1 year old son and a 2-1/2 year old daughter and they both LOVED it and could not seem to get enough. My husband also thought that it was the best white chili he has ever had (and his mom made a lot of it).....worth the try and you can crockpot it!!!

This was delicious. A wonderful soup for a cold winter night!! Here are the changes I made....2 cans white beans, 1 can black beans(for color and texture)3 cups chicken broth, 4 Tbsp water and 2 Tbsp corn starch to thicken it and 1/2 cup sour cream just before serving.  Top with more sour cream, cheese and chopped tomatoes. I also cut the jalapenos down to 1 Tbsp and cayenne to 1/4 tsp. but that is because I have 3 children under 3 years... I think I will increase it as they get older. :)

Excellent!  Very spicy.  Next time I will use half the amount of peppers.  Also added some flour to add thickness and sour cream to cool it down.

1. I doubled everything but the jals , green chile peppers, onion and cayanne (and it was still quite spicey)
2.  I took the suggestion from another reviewer and added 1-2 cans pureed beans.
3. I piled high lightly crushed tortilla chips, cheddar cheese and avacado

It was a hit!

This was so good!!  Very spicy, but we liked it a lot.  I only added two cans of beans and I added about 2 cups of cheese.  I also seasoned my chicken with salt, pepper, and chile powder before baking them.  I will definitely make this again....looking forward to having it when it is cold and snowy out!!

Wonderful soup! I cut the heat down by only using half a can of jalapenos and instead of a teaspoon of cayenne (ohmygosh!), just a few dashes. That left it with a nice spice, but the kids could enjoy it, too. I used mozzerella instead of jack, and added a good handful of chopped fresh cilanto in with the cheese. The first time I made it I'd been a little worried that it was too brothy, but that cheese at the end really does a lot to thicken it up and make it creamier.

We love this recipe and make it for guests often.  We fluctuate the amount of chilis and peppers based on our guests' preferences.  It's so delicious with a slice of sourdough and green salad on the side.  Yum!

This is now one of our favorite dinners!  It's very spicy, but we love it.  To make it quick and easy, I used a rotisserie chicken.  I also mashed 1/2 of one can of beans to thicken it a bit.  This is a great recipe, thanks!

The best "white" chili I have ever had.  Start with a little less of the hot stuff and add according to taste 'cause this stuff is really hot!

I altered this a little bit by leaving out the jalepenos and substituting the monterey jack for mozzarella.  I was so worried that this wasn't going to be good but it really was.  I think you could do a lot with it by adding some other vegetables.  I think it would be a lot like a tortilla soup I used to get in Texas by adding some avocado pieces and squash.  My husband loved the white (Northern) beans.  It was really easy and will make it again.

I make this recipe over and over; it is suitable for folks who don't eat red meat and everyone else likes it as well as red chili.  I serve it with hot corn bread.  I use ground thighs and diced chicken breasts, mild peppers (and it is still spicy), and no cheese for the sake of lessening the fat content.

Wow! Terrific chili recipe. A great change from the usual beef & tomato based kind. I used 4 cups of leftover Thanksgiving turkey instead of the 3 cups of chicken, along with a little extra broth and 1 extra can of the mild green chiles. I also added a pinch of McCormick fajita seasoning. I'm making this one for the Super Bowl this year!

I loved this Chili!  We had it at a friends house and had to have the recipe!  The recipe is easy to "tone down" if you don't like it too hot.  Just watch the amount of cayenne peppers and jalapeno peppers you add.  Also, extra beans and chicken will help to tone it down.

This recipe was a hit with my husband and son and the party-goers at our New Years Eve party.  It was a little too spicy for my taste but really has great flavor.  When I make it next time I will leave out some of the jalapenos.

This is so simple and soooo tasty! I used 2 cans of green chiles and omitted the jalapenos.  I also cut back a little on the cayenne, added extra cheese and used 2 cans of beans instead of 3 as suggested by previous reviewers.  This will definitely become a cold-weather staple in our home!  YUM!!!!

After having my sister-in-law's version of White Chicken Chili, I was interested in making it myself, so, of course, I came to Allrecipes.com!!  This recipe is SPECTACULAR!!!!  I didn't use canned broth though, only because I forgot it at the grocery.  I sauteed the onions, garlic, chilis and spices (added more of everything plus red pepper flakes, lemmon pepper, and garlic salt after reading another review) with 3 bouillion cubes and the chicken breast, then added water and the beans.  I also added some half and half to make it a bit creamier.  I didn't add the cheese to the soup.  I garnished with sour cream and shredded Jack cheese and a few drops of cayenne pepper sauce and between my husband, brother-in-law and myself, we finished off the whole batch in one night!!  My version may not be very healthy, but it sure was DELICIOUS!!!!!!

Wow!! This was a spicy one.  I had a friend over for dinner and he had to run to the bathroom to get a tissue for his running nose!  My boyfriend, who loves to eat suicide wings at Buffalo's Anchor Bar, loved the spiciness.  I added twice the amount of mozz cheese to the chili and a dollop of sour cream to my own bowl to cool it down a little.  Next time I'll only add two cans of beans instead of 3.

Oh, wow! That was some of the best food we have ever had!  I didn't have any chiles or jalapenos, so I used about a cup of my favorite Mexican restaurant's salsa.  That made it actually kind of beige rather than White Chili, but I can't handle anything too spicy, and it's an amazing recipe, since it did so well with my adaptation! This one is a keeper, in our regular rotation now!

Excellent! I followed the recipe for the most part.  However, I cooked the chicken in the broth.  I also toasted whole cumin seeds and then ground and added. You may also want to adjust the amounts of broth, beans, and chicken to yield the consistency you like best (thick or thinner).  Careful on the jalapeno's if the folks you are making it for, are spicy sensitive....Will make again, thanks.

LOVED this!! I also stirred in 1/2 cup of sour cream at the end, to give it a creamier flavor. Thank you for this great recipe. I'm so glad it's "soup" season now!

I made this chili the day after Thanksgiving.  I was hoping that it tasted like the one in the local restaurant served as an appetizer.  It was wonderful and really easy to make.  We topped it with shredded cheese and sour cream and added crushed crackers in it and it was absolutely wonderful.  My kids (2 and 7) loved it.  I think I will make it for our Christmas family gathering next month.

This chili was perfect - super easy to make and delicious.  I made it for my boyfriend who puts hot sauce on everything, but he didn't have to use the hot sauce for this one - spicy enough on its own!  I added chopped fresh tomatoes since they are in season and a dollop of sour cream to each bowl to balance the spiciness.

I really love this! I don’t care for regular chili at all but this I love. I’ve made it a bunch of times already and sometimes I add a can of diced tomatoes; gives it a different flavor and still delicious.

I made a half recipe, minus the cheese (didn’t have any) and it was delicious (I used one can chopped green chiles and one can  drained, rinsed  cannelloni beans and a container of 'no fat' 'no msg' chicken broth) and minced small half green bell pepper and half red bell pepper; made the chili colorful. The spices were perfect...  Next time, I might add a little fresh or canned corn. My husband also enjoyed it, so will plan on making it again. Easy and quick, especially as I often have leftover cooked chicken breast meat (I used three small  baked chicken breasts, but would also use rotisserie chicken meat or leftover roast turkey)... A nice alternative to my regular chili. Yum.

This was excellent. Even better the next day. Both of my teenagers loved it. I did put less than half of the jalapeños and cayenne just due to my tolerance for heat. Also puréed one of the cans of beans to make it thicker. Great, easy recipe.

It was so delish. I altered it a little bit omitting the spicy stuff and adding noodles and Himalayan pink salt and a orange bell pepper. It was so good perfect for a light lunch.

Super tasty! Our whole family had seconds. We took the other reviewers’ advice and didn’t add any jalapeños. My husband ended up adding Tabasco to spice his up. I had really wanted to make a slow cooker soup today so we doubled and added all the ingredients (except the cheese) into the slow cooker and cooked it on high for six hours. We used frozen chicken breasts and just cut them up near the end of the cooking time. We stirred the cheese in about five minutes before the end. We topped the soup with some broken tortilla chips. Magnificent!

It was very good but spicy. I cut the recipe in half because I was making it for just myself. I didn't have jalapeno or cheese. It said to use 1/2 tsp of cayenne and I cut back to less than  1/4 tsp. It was even better the next day after all the flavors came together. I added a sprinkle of Goya Adobo all purpose seasoning to add a little salt that was missing because I didn't have cheese.

Very tasty, and even better after a couple of days to allow the flavors to mix! I substituted a second can of diced green chiles  for the jalapeños. Next time I’ll Include them to add some more heat. Great with corn muffins!

I subbed the jalopeno peppers with more green chili and for  my husband and I it was just the right amount of heat. The problem I have with the recipe is it came out way way way too watery. Really more of a soup instead of a chili. I personally love the flavor and and I don't think it is bland at all. It just tastes like beans and chicken with a subtle flavor which is great in my book. I do regret adding the cheese and it was against my better judgement to do so. The cheese just cools and sticks to things. I recommend adding it just when you serve it. I also recommend some fresh cilantro on top! YUM!! :)

My family likes this when I temper the heat. I prefer it as written, with maybe a little more cumin and/or my own mix of Adobo seasoning. I have made this maybe 4 or 5 times and it's pretty fool proof.  The kids really like rotisserie chicken in it and in a slow cooker for a few hours on low.  Generally,  I've used pinto beans, but cannelloni beans are pretty tasty as well. As for the cheese, we are cheese folk, so anything goes for us.  For melting and blending, I've also tried conjita and Guerrero; I think mild cheeses or cheddar work better as an add-in and we top with the sharper varieties. Overall, great as written and very adaptable.

Had some leftover roast chicken and wanted a meal with beans.  This recipe fit the bill.  It is a bit spicy, but we like our food that way.  The broth was  thinner than we prefer.

I made this on a cold night for a hearty meal. I did not use all the jalapenos called for as some of my family likes the flavor and not all the heat. This is very good, my son-in-law makes this all the time at home. He was even asked to make it for someone at a birthday celebration. Needless to say my entire family finds this a keeper.

This is a delicious recipe, easy to follow. I modified it a little by cutting down on the spices by cutting them in half. I added homemade Pico de gallo because & it was a great topping.

I've made this a couple times and got rave reviews.  This last time, I substituted a can of hominy for one of the cans of beans and everyone loved it.  The hominy is just a type of white corn and it was right next to the white beans at the store.  I will definitely do that again!

Well, I think this is a good start, but we found it lacking in flavor.  Next time, we will add some rotel, season the chicken better.  This was a soupy chili, and we like ours a little thicker.  If we make again, we will need to make some modifications

Awesome - too spicy for me as it is written. I give it five stars b/c I don't want to bash the recipe just because I can't take the heat. :) I cut down on the cayenne and only use mild chilis instead of jalapenos.

This is the best white chili I have made. I used only half the jalapenos, but otherwise followed the recipe as submitted. I had been saving the leftover bits from rotisserie chickens in the freezer for several months, and had just the right amount to make this recipe (it was actually closer to 4 cups so I added a little more chicken broth).  I'll be braver with the jalapenos next time.

Followed directions above, simmered for 1+ hour and really liked it. I enjoy spicy hot food and this was really good. Next time, try to get thicker consistency with cream of chicken soup or puree a can of beans, aslo want to add black beans.

First time making this, and it turned out great!  I did not add the jalapeno peppers as I am not a fan of super spicy food.   I added a can of corn (drained) and used slightly less broth than the recipe calls for.  I added the cheese per serving instead of adding it directly to the entire pot of chili and added a bit of sour cream per serving as well.  Served this way, it was just spicy enough for me.  This makes a lot more than 4 servings in my opinion.

This is AMAZING!! I want to eat it everyday!
I thought maybe's peoples perceptions of spicy were different as most ppl said it was super spicy. I LOVE spicy food and yes, for me even it is really spicy!!
Few changes I made:
- extra chicken (pan-friend 4 breasts then diced up)
- extra teaspoon of cumin
- added 1 can black beans
- double the amount of cheese (and used jalapeno Monterrey)
Definitely make this TONS more!

We loved this recipe.  The only thing I changed was to use a 7 oz can of chopped green chilies and leave out the jalapenos, and reduce the cayenne pepper to 1/4 tsp.  I would have liked using the jalapenos but my husband prefers it milder.  I also used 3 cans of Campbells chicken broth (the 10.5 oz cans that you're supposed to add water to), but didn't add water.  And I did puree one can of the beans to thicken it up a bit.  Also sprinkled some cheese on top of the bowls instead of adding to chili.  We will definitely be enjoying this often!!

We just totally loved it!  Left out jalapenos, due to me having a tracheostomy,( really hot foods make me couch), did everything else the same.  Husband said I could make ie any time.  You really should try this once!

I have made this many times and is a big hit for family gatherings. All ages and genders love it. great with sour cream and tortilla chips. can cut back on spice (cayenne and half the peppers) depending on crowd and set out hot sauce to taste for larger gatherings. We do not add the cheese, rather set it out for those who want to add it on top of their bowl as desired. If you use bone in chicken breast with ribs and boil, you get a good broth, if you have the time.

This is wonderful white chicken chili and we love the recipe just as it is written!  As time passed we changed to using smoked chicken breast (thank you Cameron's Stovetop Smoker for making it so easy to smoke chicken without a multi hour commitment!) which really tastes fabulous in this chili. We have found that this recipe is very easy to make while tailgating, so this has made its way to NASCAR races and Chicago Bears games!  Easy to change the level of spicy based on your audience at the time.

My boyfriend and I didn't find it too spicy at all, as some of the other reviewer said. We even used a fresh jalapeño! I do prefer chicken chili with shredded chicken, and I found the recipe a little soupy, but flavor-wise, it was pretty good, and easy to make.

I've been making this recipe for years, but with a few differences. I don't add the jalapeños, too hot, but I will add another can of green chilies making 2 cans total for the recipe. I also like my chili a little creamier so once the soup gets hot, instead of putting in the cheese, I add one cup of sour cream and 1/2 to 1 cup of whipping cream. It just makes the soup more on the creamier side which is how I like this recipe.

Delicious chili! The best recipe I've ever made and I've tried many. I did cut the jalapeño in half and next time I will omit them and double the green chiles. It was a bit too spicy for me. I used less broth and smashed one can of the beans before I put them in to thicken the broth.  I also doubled the cheese and it was perfect. Thank you!!

Fantastic things to add:
-1/2 tsp of cinnamon (it truly brings out the cumin)
-Paprika in addition to a dash of cayenne
-A can of diced tomatoes 
-I browned the chicken, onions, and garlic ahead of time with some flour to add more flavor
-1 tbsp (3 tsp) cumin instead of 2 tsp

I skipped:
-The chilis and jalapenos

We really enjoyed this.  I did modify it a little for our preference.  I omitted the can of jalapenos and subbed it instead with 2 cans of diced green chilies.  Used only 2 cans of white beans and rotesseri chicken.  Topped it with jack cheese, sour cream and cilantro.

Loved this recipe.  I drained the beans and peppers. Also, added 1/2 of a diced red bell pepper when sautéing the onions and minced the garlic cloves instead of leaving them whole as indicated in the video.  Toppings I had available were cheddar cheese, diced red onion, cilantro, avocado, sour cream, jalapeños, and lime wedges.  Use all, some, or none.  Also had blue corn chips available for added crunch.

just quick note for those who thought the chili to be to thin, I always keep a small bag of Massa flour on hand to thicken my chili with, as I like the beans in my chili to be whole. with Massa you can easily thicken to your liking.

I've made it a couple of times. Last time in the crock pot. Didn't like that for some reason. I used 1 can of mild green chilies and 1 large fresh jalapeno. Used a lb. of chicken tenders. Not really too spicy . I did skip the cayenne.  I love White Chicken Chili.  I did thicken w/ a roux this last time though I don't recall needing this when it was cooked on top of the stove. I added the cheese as it was served. I consider this one of my go to recipes.

Tasty but nothing spectacular. I felt that it was heavy on the cumin and needed maybe some tomatoes to brighten it up. if I make again I would add stewed tomatoes for sure.

I Love this recipe.  I have modified it a bit to make it perfect for my family.  I use less of the jalapeño and reserve the rest for my husband as he likes more heat than I do.  I use my immersion blender to puree one can of white beans prior to adding it in,  this helps thicken it.  I add a can of corn as well.  I make extra because this is perfect for packing in lunches the next day! but be warned the original recipe is definitely spicy so if you are not a fan of a lot of heat, go easy on the cayenne and jalapeños.

Great recipe just the way it is provided. It does have the heat but with some sour cream (or greek yogurt) and avocado, it was awesome!  Came together in less than an hour - although I did let it simmer a bit longer.

I had a small amount of leftover chicken that needed to be used, so I halved this recipe. To the onion, I also added a small amount of chopped bell pepper, and yellow and red pepper. I like spicy, but I always cut back on them because another person's idea of hot is probably different than mine. Too much can really wreck a dish, and you can always add more later if need be. I did add a bit of chile powder and some brown sugar. It seemed a little watery, but I'm thinking if you mash up some of the beans, it may add more thickness. Nice change from the standard beef chili. Thanks Cathy!

I modified to have red and white kidney beans and spicy tomatoes and loved it. Also cut back on the spiciness because we have young kids. Great, easy recipe!!

Although I have to go easy on the jalapeno and cayenne because my husband can't tolerate spicy hot food, I absolutely love this recipe!! The flavor is sensational.  I like to fry thin strips of corn tortilla to add to the soup (like you would crackers to an other soup).  Yummy!  Thanks for this recipe.  It's a definite keeper.

Good for a change of pace over regular chili. I served over cornbread. However, I did omit all of the "spicy" ingredients, and only used a small pinch of cayenne pepper, because of my kiddos.

I made this for a chili cook-off competition in my office and WON! I followed the recipe exactly as instruction except I let mine simmer in a slow cooker for about 4 hours on low after I had cooked in a stock pot. Add sour cream and tortilla strips and you'd swear it was from a restaurant!

I am not a fan of spicy food, so following some of the other recommendations, I used the green chiles.  I seasoned the chicken breasts with onion powder, white pepper, coarse black pepper and garlic and cooked them on the grill.  That added a whole new layer of taste. I added instant mashed potatoes to thicken it up and served it with cornbread & toppings.  Very tasty.  Thank you so much for this recipe.

You can't beat this recipe - it's so adaptable and always good, plus quick and easy.  Great base for adding what's fresh and interesting.  Perfect as-is with salsa, fresh chopped cilantro, and sour cream on top.

My kids don't like red chili, so when a friend made this for it and they loved it, I had to try it at home. Once again, a HIT. Even doubled the recipe and made for parent/teacher conferences. Rave reviews.

Turned down the heat so my kids would not complain. Two 4 ounce cans of mild diced green chilies rather than the jalapeno. Half the cumin and just a sprinkle of Cayenne. Very good. Will make again.

This is a family favorite.  To dilute the spiciness, I add extra chicken and chicken broth. That way there is more for everyone!!

This was really really good. I did make a few changes based on other reviews. I didn't add the jalepeno or cayenne. I drained the green chiles. for beans I put in two cans of navy beans and one great northern bean can. I added some more chicken broth. I left out the cheese for people to put on as they wanted. for the chicken, i didn't feel like cooking it so i used three cans of chicken and cleaned up the meat.

Four stars because I didnt follow the recipe exactly, but it was amazing... I knew the two peppers would be too spicy for my family, so i just did the diced jalapeño peppers. I  also used two large cans of chicken instead of chicken breast. it was very good, would definitely make it again.

Loved it! Was definitely hot, so tame it if you can't usually handle it by doing mild chiles instead of jalapenos.

Hands down one of the best chili recipes ever!! Have made this for over ten years and altered to our tastes but it never fails to get rave reviews and requests. We use two cans of green chilies, 3 tbls of cumin and 1 each of chipotle and reg chili powder with a dash of cayenne. Two cans of white beans and one each of corn and rinsed black beans. We only individually sprinkle the cheese on top with dollops of sour cream but we love to eat this with rice (wild or white) while plating.  But we've also added rice to the simmering pot of chili for thickening as well as topped off the pot with milk to make it more mild for specific crowds. It's always better the next day and it is our annual after Thanksgiving meal to use up turkey!!

I've made white bean chicken chili before, but this is my new go-to recipe! I followed it closely, but added 7 cloves garlic, and 3-4 tsp. cumin. I used  two can green chilis and no jalepenos. Other than that, no changes. My kids loved it! I loved it! A keeper.

We are a spicy, chili eating family and loved this recipe.  Only made minor changes.  I doubled the green chilies and halved the jalepenos (had a guest for dinner).  We like a lot of beans so 3 cans was perfect.

Delicious - quick and easy. I reduced the cayenne to 1/2 tsp which was plenty of heat.  Also used two small fresh jalapeños because that's what I had.

Very good recipe.  I left out jalapeños  in fear it would be too spicy.   I should have included them- overall good taste back lacked a "kick"

Very satisfying.  Moderately spicy.  I shredded a deli rotisserie chicken instead of chopping up just breast meat.  Try replacing a can of white beans with black beans for variety.  I added half a bottle of lagunitas little sumpin' sumpin' ale and two bay leaves at the beginning of the 15 minute simmer.  Definitely going to make this again, and again.

I think this was a great base recipe.  We like hot and spicy, but I was cautious and used two cans of chilis, no jalapenos.  We really liked this soup.  Spice it up or tame it down.  Thanks!

Do not hesitate to make this chili!! IT IS ABSOLUTELY AMAZING. It's so inexpensive to make too. I can't take the heat so I always omit the peppers, but I do use mild chilies, and it's still very flavorful. I also blend one can of beans to thicken up the texture. My family will eat this up before I can get seconds if I'm not quick about putting some away!

Great recipe.  Fast, easy.  I keep all the ingredients on hand in case I don't feel like cooking and throw this together.  My husband loves this.  It has good flavor.  I wish it had a little more of something else, but it is pretty good.

This soup is super HOT! Its too bad because the overall flavor isn't bad. If I had company, I would only be able to serve this to people that can really tolerate hot foods. My sister in law is famous for her white chicken chili. She has a lot of kids and must have a less hot recipe. It was very easy to throw together though. It may work for lunches for a heat loving person in my family.

Wonderful recipe! We followed the original recipe. Very spicy, but we were warned in the reviews. Next time we will cut the jalepino peppers and the cayenne by half. We topped ours with shredded cheese, tomatoes, and sour cream. Deliscious!!!

This is now one of my "go to" recipes. Though I prefer using my own stock, when I'm in a hurry I grab a rotisserie chicken and canned chicken broth for a quick, delicious meal. I make this according to the recipe and it turns out wonderfully. Also, this freezes well. It's nice to tuck some away in the freezer and reheat whenever you need a quick dinner.

Easy and delicious.  I used fresh seeded jalapeños and added corn.  I wanted a healthier version so I used fat free, low sodium broth and added the cheese on top of rice that I added after I served it.  Will make again.  Next time I'll cream some of the beans and corn.

My boyfriend (jokingly)asked me to marry him when I made this! It is so good and easy!! I did adjust a few things: pureed one can of beans to thicken it, added a 4th can of beans, frozen corn and used a whole rotisserie chicken. Thank you for the recipe--Yum Yum Yum!

As many others said, it's WAY too hot if you follow the recipe (and I like spicy food).  So I typically use the 1 can of green chiles, just 1 spoonful of the jalapenos, and probably only 1/4 teaspoon cayenne.  I also don't stir in the cheese in order to keep it low fat.  I just put out shredded pepper jack or 2% cheddar to sprinkle on top if wanted.  We love this chili!

I used this recipe for the first time and it is delicious. I made a couple changes.  I did follow Cathy's suggestion to sub in mild green chiles if you don't like it too hot.  I only used 1/4 tsp of cayenne.  I had two pounds of ground chicken on hand so browned that with the onion and garlic.  I added in 2T of maple syup and at the end of cooking time, one cup of whole cream.  It is delicious and even better the second day.  I also did not put the cheese into the pot but had people add their own. Worked great.

My husband and kids really enjoyed this. I thought is was okay. I took the suggestions of others and puréed a can of beans and added it to the mixture to thicken it up. I also added a half of cup of sour cream, can diced tomatoes and frozen corn. I also added a can of garbanzo beans. Threw it all in the crock pot and cooked on low for 6 hours. Served with a dollop of sour cream, fresh chopped avocados and shredded monetary jack cheese.

I left the Jalepeno out and the kids devoured it. :)  I prefer it with the Jalepeno but don't want to make a seperate batch just for myself. Also, after cooking it in the pot, I dumped it in the crock pot on low for a good 4 hours. It really made it pop.

Love the flavor, but like other reviewers I tweaked it.  I love hot, spicy food, but still cut the jalepenos to half a can, and increased the green chillis to 2 cans.  I only added 1/4 tsp of cayenne and it was still burn your lips hot!  I also tweaked the cooking directions as I was going to be out for a few hours and wanted flavors to blend well.  I sauteed chicken, onions and garlic together til chicken was cooked, then added chillis and also 3Tbs of flour as I wanted a bit thicker a chili.  I put this in a crock pot and stirred in the rest of the ingredients, except cheese (some of us added it later) and left it for a few hours...it was a hit with everyone!

FIVE stars as is for us hot food lovers!  If you have a more sensitive palate, make it milder with 2 cans mild green chiles and don't add the cayenne.  I like many others, dislike people who rate it based on their unique changes but I made it 99% true to the original except I didn't have cayenne but did have chipolte powder instead.  I served it with chopped cilantro, avocado, lime wedges, shredded cheese, tortilla chips and sour cream at a friends pot luck get together and allowed everyone to customize it to their preferences.  Everyone loved it on a cool Sept. evening.  Thanks so much for sharing.

I've made something close to this before. It's a recipe and I always play with them to get the taste I want. I didn't put as much spicy into it, I left out the jalepeno and reduced the cayenne for kids. I put chili powder in and bell peppers and added mexicorn and Rotel. I put beans in, but what I had on hand, light kidneys, cannellini beans, and great northern beans. I add more to taste, like garlic powder, oregano and Knorr Tomate broth granules instead of salt. I used some chicken broth concentrate to make 2 cups broth also. I used cubed chicken. I also used cilantro and Monterrey Jack cheese. It was yummy. My kids liked it and my husband.

Very, very good. This recipe makes more of a hearty soup than a chili, I would say.  Didn't have green chiles, so I used a can of salsa verde, and only 2 cans of beans.  I think with the amount of broth, it could handle 3 cans but I made this in my crock pot and it was almost full to capacity. 

For crock pot, I just threw everything in together, except the cheese, and cooked on high for 4 hours. Shredded the cheese in at the end. I used pepper jack for a little more flavor, and added some sour cream to thicken the broth.  Excellent, would make again. :)

I used the spices and proportions but made some modifications to accommodate my available ingredients. Instead of cooked chicken breast, I used 8 skinless, boneless chicken thighs, trimmed of fat and cut into 1" pieces. Because it was uncooked, I seasoned with salt and pepper and cooked in my Dutch oven in a Tbsp of vegetable oil prior to cooking the onions. When it was mostly cooked, I removed it and set it aside, then added another Tbsp of vegetable oil and the onions. I didn't have a can of green chilies, but I did have a poblano pepper, so I roasted it under the broiler, the removed the skin and chopped the pepper and added at the same step as listed. I also deglazed the pan with half the chicken broth, scraping up any flavorful browned bits from the bottom of the pan before adding the chicken and their juices, beans and the remainder of the chicken broth. At this step, I also added 1 14oz can of diced tomatoes, drained, and a small package of frozen corn. I brought it to a slight boil, then covered the pot, reduced heat and simmered about 15 minutes, until chicken was cooked through. Thighs are great because they remain so moist and juicy! This was a great recipe for using up miscellaneous fridge items (slow cooker white beans, diced jalapeños, poblano pepper)!

My wife doesn't like chili but volunteered to make some for the church chili cook off. SHE WON!! Great recipe, we didn't change much, just didn't add the Jalapenos and added some sour cream.

This has very good flavor and just the right amount of heat.  I did think it was a little thin and may be improved by pureeing a portion of the beans to thicken the broth.

The whole family loved this recipe.  I sauteed the garlic and onion first.  Then browned the chicken real well.  I then deglazed the pan with a splash of chicken broth and added 1 can of hot green chiles, 1 can cream of chicken soup and 2 cans white beans and 1 cup of chicken broth.  I then shredded the chicken and added that.  I let this simmer for about 3 hours on my stove and kept adding chicken broth to thin it out as it thickens as it simmers when cooking on stove top.  I garnished with a dollop of sour cream, shredded monterey jack cheese, diced tomatoes, chives and cilantro.  It was awesome!!!!

I made this chili five times in the last three months.  It is way too spicy when made with the jalapeno peppers.  Omit the jalapeno's and it's perfect!  The last time was the best though.  I omitted the jalapeno's, used a 32 oz carton of chicken broth instead of two 14 oz cans and drained the juice from the beans.

I think this is one of the best chili recipes I have ever made.  I love spicy food and thought this was the perfect blend of spice, with one change.  I did not have any canned jalepenos on-hand so instead I used one fresh, seeded jalepeno and it was perfect.  For the beans I used 1 can garbonzo beans, 1 can cannellini beans and 1 can pinto beans.  Before adding the beans I put approx 1/3 of each can (unrinsed) into the blender, pureed and then added everything to the pot.  I also grilled my chicken which added a nice layer to the flavor.  This would be great to serve to a large group with a variety of toppings and add-ons (rice, crushed tortilla chips, avocado slices, pico de gallo, etc).

It really is as good as they all say.  Like others, I changed it up a bit- sprayed my pot with Pam instead of using oil, used 2 cups chicken broth, pureed 1 can of white beans (which I drained before I realized the recipe calls for the whole can..... noxt time I will not drain), 1 can kidney and 1 can black beans both with juices, omitted the jalapenos and the cheese (calories) and cut cayenne in half (for the kids).  Kids even liked it!  Definitely  better when a little shredded cheese (fat free) and sour cream (fat free) were added but they are not necessary.

I loved this chili! Although I would classify it more as a soup.  I actually tweaked it a bit by using shredded chicken that was cooked in a marinade of the spices prior to putting in the crockpot.  We served it with tortilla chips! YUMMMM! Love it!

Based on the other reviews I made a few changes.  I only used 2 cans of beans since my family doesn't like beans, and I pureed one of the cans to thicken the broth. I also did not use jalepenos, and I substituted chili powder for cayenne.  I think next time I may use the cayenne or perhaps smoked paprika.

fantastic recipe..I added about 2 handfuls of cilantro and a whole lime. I did puree 1 can of the beans to thicken like most folks. Also, for chicken I just deboned a whole chicken from wal-mart and added at the end so it didn't get tough. If you like hot you'll love it,added the cheese on top at the end as well...can't quit eating it !

I left out the Jalapenos and halved the cayenne (family doesn't like hot) and it was still nice and spicy. I pureed one can of beans to thicken slightly.

Muy delicioso!  My family loves this chili!  I used more mild green chili instead of the spicy, diced jalapenos, as I have a 6 year-old.  Will definitely use this recipe a lot more in the future!

This is awesome!!!
I didn't have any peppers, so I added a can of Rotel, diced tomatoes & green chilis.  It was fantastic!!  My husband just had 2 bowls and said "This is EXCELLENT!!!". I was afraid he wouldn't eat it, because he hates tomatoes!

VERY GOOD! Made it 4x's now. To save time, I put the chicken in a crockpot covered in chicken broth on low. Come home from work & shred the super tender chicken, then make the rest pretty much by the recipe. Only other thing I change is I blend a can or two of the beans instead of putting all 3 cans in whole. This helps make it thicker which we like. Note that the nutrition values are not accurate (more like deceiving). This makes about 4 quarts. The calories are based on 4 servings, but a quart is a big serving! I calculated that one CUP is approx. 230 calories...I have a big appetite & 1-2 cups of this is filling!

GREAT recipe.  I'm not big on really hot food so substituted a second can of green chiles for the jalepenos.  Also used boneless skinless chicken thighs instead of breast and sauteed them in garlic olive oil.  Finally, added a little chili powder and mild tabasco for bite since I didn't use the jalepenos.  Brought to a party.  Disappeared within 20 minutes!

I could see the original recipe being too "soup like" so I agree with other reviewers on a few modifications: 1) mash white beans to add thickness, 2) sub a can of cream of chicken soup instead of broth, 3) to make it really decadent, I mixed in half & half and sour cream along with the shredded cheese.  It was great... just adjust the peppers/cayenne for taste. I used shredded rotisserie chicken and served it over white rice. My dad added Cholula hot sauce to hi to kick it up a notch. Loved the leftovers!

This was so filling, delicious and fairly healthy. Two of us ate the whole batch in three days. I added about a half cup of ricotta to make it creamy and skipped the monterey jack cheese.

This was more like soup than chili.  It tasted really great (though I cut back on some of the spices, as I don't love spicy things).  But, it wasn't thick like I think of when I think of chili.

This is a great recipe.  You can make it mild by adding less peppers.  I suggest adding more cumin to give it a nice flavor.  Use any type or combination of white beans. Serve with sour cream. Always a crowd pleaser.

Good. Added corn, used only half the amount of cumin. Pureed 1 cup of Northern beans to thicken it up. Left out the jalepenos, used only green chilies. Added cheese to each individual bowl for calorie control.

This was quite good. I was serving to a 2 and 4 year old so I subbed green chiles for the jalapenos. I used ground turkey instead of the chicken just based on personal preference. I cooked the turkey with the onion, garlic and spices and then put everything in the crock pot for the afternoon. We added the cheese to the bowls when serving.

Very good!  I added a little cornstarch to thicken the chili and instead of the jalapeños or cayenne pepper I substituted a little ground white pepper.

I left out the Jalapenos, thickened it up a bit with some flour and a roux, and cooked it for several hours in a crock pot on low.  I then topped it with some more Monterrey jack and broke cornbread biscuits over it... it was fantastic!

Tasty Dish! Based on reviews I reduced the amount of heat.  Everyone in the house ate this right up.  If you need to stretch the meal, it's really good served over rice/wild rice. I make this dish time and time again!

The only changes I made were I shredded the chicken instead of cubed and used about 3.5 cups of Chicken instead of 3. I also purred one can of the beans so the soup would be a little bit thicker. I also added in a half of a can of beer...Don't ask but it made it so much more flavorful and the beer cooks out. Once it was in my bowl I topped with a sprinkle of monterey jack cheese, a tbsp of sour cream and some pico de galo. Also can eat tortilla chips with it. I did cook it a little bit longer just so the beer would cook down and it would be back to the thickness I liked....Will definitely make this again...It was DELICIOUS!!! And no...it wasn't too spicy.

This recipe was excellent! I used an extra clove of garlic, some garlic powder and some onion salt as well. It was a hit with the whole family!
Green salsa adds a nice touch on top

Perfect, I left off the peppers for the whimpy family members, topped with cheese,  sour cream, fresh green onions and corn chips, yummm! They call it Cha Chili.

I thought this was extremely good; however it didn't get rave revues from my family, which is why I only gave it four stars.  I made a couple of changes due to my sons dislike for hot dishes.  I put in one can of cream of chicken and one can of chicken broth (I like my chili a little thicker) and I didn't put in the jalapenos.  It was still too hot for my son.

Although the amount of spices and jalapenos seemed daunting, the spiciness was “just right” after simmering. I wasn’t sure if the cans of beans were supposed to be drained or not, so I held onto the liquid at first. Then it was obvious that the chili needed more liquid, so in went the bean juice! I also added a can of Cream of Celery soup as suggested by other reviewers. Otherwise,  followed the recipe as shown. Served this to a group of skiers and they devoured it! No one complained that it was too hot.

Yep - this is definitely 5 stars!  While I found it to be just a little hot for my taste, my husband thought it was perfect. For me, I toned down the heat with a dollop of sour cream, and that made it just right.  This is very hearty, you shouldn't take as much to start as you might normally - this is gonna fill you up fast!  This is one that my husband was asking me to make again - before we even finished the first batch!  Quick and easy, this recipe is going to become a part of our regular rotation of favorites.

This recipe is wonderful. Like the others I added my own touch. I am making it for a Christmas party so I added some diced green and red peppers while sauting the onions. Baked the chicken, cut it up and added it to the pot.  I also didn't have jalapenos on hand so I used a jar of salsa verde in it's place and omitted the cayenne.  Turned out fabulous. Going to let it sit over night in the fridge and warm it in the crockpot before the party. Plan on serving it with sour cream and cheese on top.

Oh my goodness this was so good! I used the leftover turkey from Thanksgiving this year and it was delicious!! It is a bit spicy but the heat stays on your tounge and is not so overpowering that you can't enjoy the other flavors. It makes way more than 4 normal servings! If you are cooking for four hungry boys this will be perfect...but even warmed up its fantastic!

The first time I had this was at my Sister-in-laws home and it was great. Tasty and hearty. I am cooking it right now for my husband and it makes the house smell so so yummy. I used white cannelli beans, used a can of cream of chicken with herbs and 2.5 cups of chicken broth. The cream of chicken thickened up the soup so it isn't runny at all. The jalapenos I used have no heat so I added more cayenne pepper ( I love spicey food ). I didn't use oregano cos I don't have any...just used some dried italian herb seasoning. I also added about 1/2 cup of corn. I seasoned my chicken tenders with poultry seasoning and cooked it in the oven ( personal preference) so it's moist and flavorful. Going  to leave the cheese off to be added as desired during dinner paired with some garlic bread.

Very yummy!!! I used a pre-cooked rotisserie chicken, which I like since I really enjoy both white and dark meat.  I also used a fresh jalepeno and hatch chilis, which we have here in this area.  Turned out great!  Added some salt & pepper to taste and topped off with some tortilla chips for a little crunch and it was a big hit!  Will definitely be making this again soon!

This was delicious and healthy!  I tried to cut some of the heat out so my kids would eat it.  So I cut the amount of jalapeno's in half and left the cayenne pepper out completely - and it was still real hot.  But my husband & i enjoy the heat...it was delicious!

This was SO good and SO easy!  I cooked the chicken ahead of time, so just needed to throw it all together.  

I topped my bowl off with a little plain Greek yogurt and it added even more flavor and zing.  Delicious!!

Very spicy, very tasty.  Will make again!  I used ground chicken, and it still turned out wonderfully.  I made this for a reception along with a red chili and some cornbread.  This was an absolute favorite of the crowd!

Amazing!  I used a fresh Jalapeno instead (If you deseed it first it will be less spicy) I put all the ingredients in the pot and put on low and let it sit for a couple of hours-which put the flavors in the chicken as well! (putting it in the crokpot as well will work) I cancelled out the cayenne pepper, and served over rice with Colby-jack cheese sprinkled over top instead of mixing cheese in the pot

this dish was awesome, we loved the white beans, makes it a little heartier which we don't normally eat. It was definitely spicy and though my husband and I love the heat, he was sweating by the end of the meal.

Wonderful recipe!  As per other reviews I substituted the can of jalps for another one of green chilis to keep the heat down.  It was perfect!  Definately a keeper!

The only reason that this doesn't get five stars is because as is it is too spicy! And don't get me wrong, we like spicy, but this is too much. With some alterations, this is definitely a five star.

I was asked by a friend of my daughters to make chili for a cook off his family was having.  He told me he wanted a spicy white chicken chili.  I found your recipe and knew it would be what I would work from.  I changed very little, but I did triple the recipe.  I added extra fresh jalapenos and and 3 extra cans of beans that I pureed.  It defenitely made it thick and awesome!  He brought me the first place trophy the next day.  Thanks for the great recipe.  I am making it again tonight.

This is very good!  A great alternative to our old standby of beef and bean chili.

This recipe is amazing!!! A favorite in my household! I did take out the jalepanos and use two can of green chilis, also I used 2 cups of chicken broth to thicken it. Also I buy a rotisserie chicken and shred it because that chicken stays tender after reheating several times! Most of my house puts a dollop of sour cream but it's great with or without!!

WONDERFUL, even though I didn't have sour cream on hand.  I had a few sub rolls I had to use, so I stuck them under the broiler for a minute with butter & garlic powder for a quick & easy garlic bread.  The bread helped to tone down the "zip" of the chili a bit, so it was a perfect combination.  Definitely a keeper for those frosty nights!!

Good Overall!  Would put in half the jalepenos, especially if using jar vs can.  Agree that some mashed up beans makes consistency better.

This is my fave chili recipe!! I dont like tomatos so its perfect for me!! I always double the recipe but only add one can of chilies and no jalapenos. I also double the cheese at the end. I always serve it with extra cheese and tortilla chips. I have been making this recipe for a couple of years now and its always a hit!!!

I've made this a dozen times and it never disappoints. So easy and delicious! I usually make a rotisserie or beer butt chicken the night before and use the leftovers in this recipe. Topping it with fresh tomatoes, avocado, cilantro and Franks or Taptio is the norm in our house. Enjoy!

Cooked unsoaked beans in a pressure cooker first and then added everything else.  I did not add the jalapeños--my kids would not have eaten it.  But I added about 9 cloves of garlic.  I did not have oregano so I used thyme instead.  Super delicious dish.  Will be making this again.  Thanks.

This was good.  I used 3 fresh jalapenos from the garden, so it was a little spicy (yum!).  I also added a can of diced tomatoes.  It was delicious!

I'm only giving 4 stars because I didn't follow the recipe exactly. I skipped the jalapenos and halved the cayenne, per others suggestions, because I knew it would be too spicy for my 2 little boys. I did puree one can of white beans to create a thicker consistency but it still came out more like a hearty soup rather than a chili. No worries -- still VERY tasty! I sauteed the onions and garlic in some olive oil and added to the chicken broth in my crock pot. Added the white bean puree, then blended in a bag of frozen corn and all my spices (garlic powder, onion powder, white pepper, cumin, cayenne, and about 3 T of dried cilantro)... I then sauteed my chicken in olive oil and a blended garlic herb spice, until it was just browned & added to the mix. Let that cook on high for about 2-1/2 hours in the crock pot and served with shredded col-jack cheese, sour cream, sliced jalapenos and chopped green onions. Also used the buttery cornbread recipe from this site. DEFINITELY going into the dinner rotation. Can't wait to make this again once it gets colder! Big hit with the family -- even my 2 yr old!

This is a pretty good basic recipe. My first time at making white chili. I sauteed a yellow onion, lots of garlic and a jalapeno pepper in some olive oil until soft. Then I added the shredded meat of two rotisserie chickens, four cans of white beans (I mashed the last can to a paste to make the chili thick), two packets of white chicken chili seasoning from McCormick, plus more cumin, pepper and enough chicken stock to give it the proper consistency. Very good with cornbread muffins.

I love the flavors in this and I make it all the time!  Per directions it is really more soup than chili.  Since I prefer it to be more chili than soup, I smash 2 cans of the white beans with a potato masher first and I add one can of cream of chicken soup.  Thank you for the recipe!

Good, hardy, quick and easy.  Great for a cold winter's supper.  I omit the jalapenos and only use two cans (15 or 16 oz) of cannellini beans.  I find that slightly mashing one can of the beans thickens the broth nicely. This recipe is a staple in my home during the winter months.

This was an awesome recipe!  My fiance loved it as did I.  I made three small changes to it though.  I put in 4 chopped and cooked strips of bacon, half a packet of dry ranch dressing mix, and half of a green pepper.  Absolutely amazing!

I thought this was delicious, easy and healthy! I left out both the jalapeños and the cayenne (because my kids won't eat spicy). That left it a little bland. I added 1/4 tsp salt and 1/8 tsp pepper and that wasn't quite enough; another dash of each in the bowl cured it and it was delicious. I used (very chicken looking) pork chops on accident and it still tasted great. To save effort I put the meat and the broth in the blender on low and it shredded the meat for me...very easy.

Awesome recipe!  I made this several times through Lent.  Everyone loves it.  I skillet-fry the onions and spices with veggie oil and then add the chicken broth.  I also add a good squirt or two of vinagre and a 1/4 cup of sugar.  In a slow-cooker, I put the beans and chicken and then pour the broth mixture over that.  I cook it on the low setting for 4-6 hours...DE-DILSH!  Everyone just adds their own cheese (and chopped green onions/cilantro) to individual bowls.

Yummy! We don't like super spicy so I eliminated the jalapenos and only used 1/2 the green chile peppers. I also like corn in my chili so I substituted 1 can of corn for 1 of the cans of beans. Added it all to the crock pot and let simmer on low for the afternoon. Served topped with cheese and sour cream. Delicious!

This is great. I have never made a white chcken chili, but love to eat them.  I didn't have everything on hand so this is what I did.  I had left over rotissiere chicken, I threw the carcass in a pot and put maybe 6 cups water in.  I let it stew while turning the chicken on occasion, maybe a total of an hour.  Removed the bird, pulled the meat off, returned the meat to the pot, liquid had reduced to about 4 cups.  I sauted onion, and a red pepper I had laying around, with the extra garlic.  Put it in the pot, dumped a can of corn with juice and 2 cans white beans, with juice in.  I didn't have jalapeno's or chiles (would have used a can of chile's if I had them).  Put in spices, reduced cayenne by just a little.  Wanted to thicken it up a bit, didn't have Monteray, so I put in a brick of cream cheese (next time I might only put in 6 ozs).  It is delicious!  Looking back, I thought the recipe called for corn so I threw it in.  It was a good addition.  But I had only done 2 cans of beans.

Turns out perfect every time!  I don't add the cheese in, I just let people put the cheese when it is served.  I think it saves a little bit in calories, or at least I hope it does!

This was really good- but very spicy.  I used chicken thighs, decreased the amount of chicken stock and pureed 1 can of the beans.  I also used dried thyme instead of oregano,  Next time, I will puree 1 1/2 - 2 cans of the beans and decrease the heat.  Everyone really enjoyed it!

This was excellent and extremely tasty.  I crumbled some tortilla chips and it added a nice crunch.

Love this soup! I am not much for spicy though so I left out the jalapanos and cayenne and just doubled up on the green chilies. I also added some heavy cream towards the end of cooking to add extra creaminess. Perfect Chili!!!!

We absolutely love this recipe! Often times we use leftover Beer Can Chicken that was cooked on the grill and you get that really great grilled flavor.  Other times I put it all in the crockpot and let it go all day.  Great both ways.

Excellent! I cut back to about a tenth of all the hot spices and gradually added a little at a time. Used less cumin, more oregano. Added chicken cubes. Best recipe I've tried from here in awhile! Thanks for sharing!

So yummy and healthy.  I use 2 cans of chiles (no jalapenos) and leave out the cayenne - so my kids and I can eat it.  I also usually add another can of broth to make it "soupier".  The cumin and oregano make this great!

As written four stars but this is very adaptable according to personal taste. It reminded me of traditional ham and beans with a mexican flair! Based on other reviews I pureed one can of white beans and eliminated a can of chicken broth. I used IQF chicken tenders and put them in the crock pot first and then added the remaining ingredients. I eliminated the cumin and peppers to tone it down. & added a can of diced tomatoes. Cooked on high for about five hours. Shredded the chicken and put it back in with about 3 Tbsp. of flour to thicken it up.  We love homemade soups and I'll be making this a lot. Thanks for sharing!

Great flavor!  Sauteed thigh & breast meat w/onion in olive oil to start; 7 oz green chiles, 1/2 can jalapenos; 1/2 tsp cayenne; 1-1/2 cans broth; added extra beans & hominy - all drained; + 1 can crm of chicken, undiluted, thickens it up.  It could even stand 1 sm can salsa verde.  Needed salt, white pepper, coriander - But honestly - just fine as written, any other tweaks are just personal preference and it just makes sense to keep the heat down a bit and let people dr. up their own bowls if they want it hotter.  Cheese, sour cream, tortilla chips, avacado all on the side.  Yum!

This is my new favorite chili.  My husband and his friends devoured it and I am making more the next day!  I did use fresh jalapenos and replaced one can of broth with a can of cream of chicken.  It was plenty thick that way and not too hot at all.  This chili is addictive.

I left out the jalapenos and only added 1/8 tsp cayenne.  (made for guests and was cautious with the heat).  I also mashed one of the cans of beans to thicken.  I used pre cooked chicken breast strips. It tasted really good, however, I simmered it for about 30 min and lost quite a bit of juice.  If only there was a better way to get it into more of a true chili consistency.  The next day, it was too thick because there was hardly any broth left, but the flavor was great.

This was SO good.  I used lentils, white kidney beans, and pinto beans.  I used two cans of chile's instead of the jalepenos and I used vegetable broth from concentrate.   I simmered the onions, then added the raw, cut up pieces of chicken, chile's, garlic, and spices and cooked on low until the chicken was tender.  I then added the remaining ingredients and let them simmer together for about a half hour.  The rest I left as-is and - Wow!!  I'm making it again tonight for a guest.  So excited to eat it again!!  Make this recipe, you and your guests will really love it.  Great winter comfort food, indeed!

We've been using this recipe for a couple of years, it's a family favorite.  I only use 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper and 1/2 the can of jalepenos; my parents who love spicy food use the recipe amounts.

This is awesome, very spicy, so if you like that, you will love this!  If you like it more mild, then cut the cayenne some.  So good, and I am not usually a chili fan!

It is good but it is HOT!! I didn't even add the green chiles either. It is very delicious though. Perfect for a snowy day. To modify I might cut back on the spices & jalepenos.

I too followed other reviews. I excluded the jalapenos and decreased the cayenne pepper to just 1/4tsp. I can't do too much spice and at the end of the bowl this still had a kick to it. I also pureed one can of the beans, only added one can of chicken broth and added a can of corn. Overall, this recipe is definitely a keeper!! Perfect for a cold rainy day!

I didn't have some/all of the ingredients on hand and so I made a few alterations. First, I do not like beans so I left them all out. I love chicken chili with tomatoes so I added two cans of diced w/ green chiles  tomatoes with the juice. I only had one can of broth. I omitted the cayenne and cumin, but added a dash of paprika. Only diced about 6 slices of jalapenos and it was still spicy. We like it hot, so it worked but I probably wouldn't serve it this spicy to guests. Also, there was plenty of juice because of the tomatoes. Fabulous!! We usually use the packets at the store and this was much better.

My uncle Mark made  this for deer season it was different from all the other chilis we normally have. It was really good... Chicken and chili... Great combination. He made a few changes. only 2 oz of jalopenos, 7 oz of chilies, a tablespoon or two of cilantro, and an extra can of chicken broth.  Very good!! might not have needed the extra broth though.

I love this recipe but a few modifications are a must. If you add more than a can of chopped tomatoes and chilies, you'll be breathing fire like a dragon. The one can was enough. I used the beans from the bag since I'm not a fan of the sodium that comes with the can. Once the beans we're ready, I simmered the broth, chicken, and other ingredients from the original recipe. I used thighs since they don't dry out. I definitely recommend adding some corn. It’s a nice touch. Added a can of cream of chicken to thicken it up (diluted with a 1/2-3/4 can of cream) 5 minutes before it was ready to serve. I forgot to add the cheese. It wasn’t missed.

I thought this was pretty good. I did have to make some changes only because I didnt have the items but I think it would be great with them. I didnt have either the green chilis or the jalapenos so i simply added some ancho chili powder. I didnt add but a dash of cayenne. Didnt want it hot so the kids would eat it. I added a half cup fresh chopped cilantro and I didnt add cheese. My 6 year old and husband both really enjoyed this. I madecorn bread to go with it. Will make again.

I added 1 tsp parsley when you add all the rest of the spices.I also cut the jalapeno pepers to 2 oz and 1/4 tespoon cayenne pepper. Then when you are doing the chicken i added 1/2 salsa also. At the end I added 1 1/2 tablespoon corn starch. It turned out good. My husband loved it!!!!

I just made this today and it was exactly what I was looking for.  I did make a couple of substitutions:  2 fresh jalapenos instead of canned, I roasted two poblano (mild) peppers and threw those in, and used a pre-made roasted chicken from the grocery store.  I did cut back on the cayenne pepper as well.  It is very tasty and can be customized for your likes/dislikes.  Will definitely make again!  The only reason I gave it 4 out of 5 stars is because it's more of a soup than a chili.  But by pureeing a bit of the beans or adding potato, it can be thickened to chili consistency.  Happy eating!

Very good and full of flavor!  I read through a ton of the reviews and while I LOVE spicy food, I noticed many people saying it was way too spicy, so I used 2 cans diced chiles and 1/4t. cayenne and that was it for the spice.  And I actually went ahead and threw everything into the crock pot with two frozen chicken breasts and left it on high for about 1-2 hours and then on low for 4-5 hours.  SO easy.  All I had to do was take the chicken out before serving and shred it lightly...it just fell apart, it was so tender.  I also threw a cup or so of the mix (minus chicken) into the blender to thicken it up a bit which helped a lot.  Great recipe though.  Next time I may even add some corn!  Mmmmm.

This recipe is perfect just the way it is.  The only thing you may want to change is the chiles and jalapenos if you can't handle the heat.

very good flavor...**shredded chicken** and used 1 7 oz. can CGchiles and 1 fresh jalapeno seeded and diced, which makes it less spicy altogether...drained beans before adding...really yummy...didn't even have to use cheese, as others also suggested but used sour cream instead

This is a very nicely spiced chili. I used 3 large fresh Jalapeno's, I doubled the green chilies, and only 2 cans of white beans. To thicken, as I do even my Chili Verde, after all ingredients are sauteed, add 3 to 4 TBS oil to pan and 3 to 4 TBS flour, stir for about 30 seconds and add chicken broth. I used about a cup more chicken broth.

I loved this chili!  I omitted the jalapenos and used about 2 cups of chicken broth.  Grated pepper jack on top and sprinkled with cilantro.  Thank you!

My husband is VERY hard to cook for...lots of food aversions, including onion, garlic, most vegetables, etc., but I tried this recipe with a few variations and he LOVED it!  I omitted the onion, garlic and peppers and took the suggestion of another poster and added in some Mrs. Dash Chipotle seasoning, as well as some hot red pepper flakes.  I also pureed one can of northern beans to thicken the stock.  It was delicious!!!

The heat in this recipe is just perfect!  This is a great recipe to make for large potlucks.  

I am STILL making this recipe over 5 years later.  I really like it.  I do put less chilis in it because it is on the hot side, but yum!

soooooo good! I made this for an office chili cook-off and was the only person to make a "non-traditional red chili". It was a hit and came in 3rd place out of 13...I was happy enough with that. I will def make this again!

Good recipe. I kept the spices the same and it did not come out too spicy in my opinion. I did add a can of corn and I pureed one can of beans to thicken.

We all loved it. Only change was subbing out the jalepenos for an extra can of chilis, and adding a can of corn. Did smash up part of the beans to thicken!

Wow!  This will knock your socks off!  Definitely spicey, but in a good way.  I added sour cream and a little extra cheese to mine and it was amazing.  This is perfect for a cold fall or winter evening.

This white chicken chili is the BEST! I made some for my father in law and now he cannot stop making this! I follow the recipe exactly and have never had any problems - my husband likes to put the leftovers in a tortilla with some cheese and sour cream as a quick lunch or midnight snack - You cannot go wrong with this one!

This chili is AMAZING!!! I made it using one of those store-cooked chickens and pulled the meat off the breast bone. I also pureed half of the beans (I used butter beans) per previous reviews for a thicker consistency. This was super easy and had a great kick of heat! Pairs very well with cornbread.

EXCELLENT!!! Kind of spicy but I didn't think it was too much.  A kind of different chili but very good.  The only things I did different from the recipe was using 1 can of broth and pureeing one of the cans of beans.  Also I found out I didnt have cumin or cayenne powder so I used a teaspoon of chili powder.  Will make again! Oh and I added a can of corn and halved the amount of jalapenos!

Very good...definitely a keeper.  The family gave it a big thumbs up.  Spicy - so you might want to cut back on the cumin and cayenne pepper for the first time - you can always add more if you need to.  Thanks for sharing!

Amazing White Chili ~ works well in the crock pot and then 'pul' the chicken. Any type of beans work, I used whatever I had in the house.

Loved this!  Because my family does not like things too spicy I didn't use the jalapeno peppers and only used 1/2 tsp ground cayenne.  The only other difference was that I used tequila lime flavored frozen chicken breasts because that's what I had on hand.  This, as my husband said, is a keeper!

Family loves this recipe.  Was also a big hit at a church chili pot luck.  I did tone down the heat a bit for the church function by omitting the jalapeños and doubling the green chiles. Also reduced the cumin to 1tsp.  It was spicy enough to warm the back of the throat as we ate it, but mild enough that even kids enjoyed eating it.

My family loved this recipe.  I did substitute one of the cans of white beans with a can of butter beans- it gave it a little more visual variety.  Just before serving I stirred through some fresh cilantro.  Excellent!!

I love this recipe, I make it atleast 2x a month in the winter, and it is great for parties. Like most other reviewers, I toned down the spice. I add about half the jalapenos and only a quarter (or less) of the cayenne, I also add less beans. I usually whatever chicken I have on hand, it is great with either boneless breasts or shredded off the bone.  This recipe is great base and then you can make some adjustments for your taste. Thanks for sharing, delicious.

I absolutely loved this recipe! The first time I made it I followed the recipe almost exactly (modified for 8 servings). I did, however, substitute fresh diced jalapenos for the canned ones. The bright green of the fresh peppers really added a lot of crisp freshness to this chili. I like spicy things as do my friends, so we really enjoyed this. On my most recent venture with this recipe, I did make a few changes. The chili seemed really soupy the first time I made it, so in addition to the 6 cans of beans the recipe calls for (keeping in mind I make this for 8), I added 2 more cans of pureed white beans and one can of pureed black beans (this added wonderful color). This made the chili a lot thicker and much more "chili-like". I did find that I needed to add more cumin, cayenne, salt, and pepper since the beans did slightly dull the flavor. But after some spice tweaking, this made a WORLD of difference! Much, much heartier when you add the additional pureed beans. This is definitely going to become a staple in my winter recipe box!

Loved it!!  I did omit the jalapenos and chillies and substituted 1 can of Rotel.  I also pureed a can of beans like some others suggested to make it thicker. It was fabulous!

Good chili. I actually let this simmer for 2 hours. I added a 3 cans of chicken broth and a can of pureed white beans and 1tbsp of cornstarch to thicken it up. Topped it off with green onions, sour cream and crushed tortilla chips. Yummy.

HOLY HEAT! I had to make this for 40. So I ad to adjust it. Unless I screwed up something serious, nobody could eat it. I am trying it again for another large group but I am really watching the temp!

This is an excellent recipe!  I used a 7 oz. can of chopped green chilis and then roasted 3 jalapeno peppers and seeded and chopped them (and have a burned arm to prove it...lol).  Didn't have any cayenne so added some black pepper.  PERFECT amount of spice for me.  I did drain the beans, but didn't rinse them.  I also used 2 1/2 cups of broth from the two chicken breasts that I boiled with some bouillon.  Ate a bowl for lunch with a dallop of sour cream - DELICIOUS!

Gave it 5 stars after following recommendations from other reviewers.  I eliminated the jalapeno peppers entirely, cut the amount of cayenne pepper and broth in half, mashed one can of white beans and added a can of black beans and corn.  Even my husband, who loves hot dishes, thought this was delicious with those changes.

This soup is very easy to make.  I doubled the green chilis and skipped the jalapenos.  I also added in a can of diced tomato and added in extra cayenne.  It was very good.    I tried calculating Weight Watcher points and was a little surprised that this recipe is listed as only 4 servings.  I would say it's closer to 6-8 servings.  Great recipe that's good with cornbread muffins.

My family LOVED this recipe! Very hearty and a great "soup" for those cool crisp days! I was worried about it being too hot and so added green chilies in place of the jalapenos. Only other thing is I added some jalapeno-ranch dressing just before serving & it was terrific! Served with some cornbread and honey-butter. Mmmmm

This recipe was just OK in my opinion. I didn't think it was too spicy, but I followed others advice and only used 1/2 can of jalapenos, but extra cayenne. I have had other white chicken chili that is much better, Probably won't be making again.

This was an excellent change from regular Chili.  My family and I loved it.  I used mild green chiles instead of the jalapenos and it turned out with just enough heat.

This was nice and light and it tasted pretty good, but I found it was more spicy than flavourful. I omitted the jalapenos and used only green chiles. Next time I will probably leave out the cayenne. Nice to eat on a cool day.

This was wonderful!  I used previous advice and started with half the cumin and cayenne pepper.  I nixed the jalapenos (too hot for me!).  After tasting I added a dash more of cumin and it was perfect!

I too toned down the spices because I have kids and they loved it. I used four cans of cannellini beans--pureed two in the blender with the chicken broth before adding it to the crock pot. It was the perfect thick consistency. I will make it again and again.

Awesome way to use up leftover roasted chicken! My modifications: 5 cloves garlic; 1/2 fresh diced jalapeno instead of the can; 1/2 tsp cayenne; 2 cans of beans (plenty); added two fresh pablano peppers and a couple shakes of hot pepper flakes. I didn't measure the liquid, but I used water + 3 tsp of chicken bullion, and it was still too watery. Mine turned out mildly spicy, just about perfect, tho I think next time I'll use the whole jalepeno.

Absolutely delicious!  I used the basic recipe except for a few simple adaptations - I used 4 cans of White Northern Beans (pureed one for thickness) and added a bit more chicken.  Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly.  Yes, it is very spicy, but that's the way we like it!

This is delicious!  I have a 2, 4 and 6 year old and they loved it. Because of the boys I left out the jalapenos and cayenne, so this can be made for mild palates and still taste great. Added a can of black beans and topped with sour cream and homemade tortilla chip strips. A fall favorite!

Very good after reviewing some of the recommendations. From the original photo it looks way too thin so I also pureed one can of the white beans. I also added a tsp. of Chipolte Chili Seasoning. I used the 50% low sodium chicken broth too. Oh, the fiesta corn was awesome added to this! ;) 2 cans of broth is the perfect amount. I did not add the Jalapenos because I was afraid it would be a tad to spicy but I personally would love that. My kids thought it was too spicy but young kids can't usually tolerate heat but I thought it was mild. Next batch I will add the Jalapenos and add a full tsp. of Cayenne Pepper. I only used 1/2 tsp. for this one. It wasn't hot at all to me!    The texture is very good. Not too thin or too thick. Perfect...IF you follow some of the recommendations. The taste is very good and the spices are perfect.    A must try! Just add/subtract ingredients to your personal liking. ;)

UPDATE:

Using the Jalapenos makes this dish VERY hot. Most people will not be able to tolerate that so be selective here with your ingredients. I personally love to sweat eating soup. LOL! Very good!

Everyone who has tried this soup loves it. Make it without the Jalapenos if you plan to feed people you aren't familiar with. They may not like it that spicy.

Amazingly easy - has a bit of a kick to it. I made it (almost) true to the recipe 1st time around, as I always do.  It would be very easy to make different variations.  I am usually a "from scratch" cook, but I will use this shortcut recipe again!

Unfortunately, this was very bland. I liked the spice, but spice alone does not make the dish enjoyable. I doctored this like crazy and was unable to make it great. I'll stick with the Slow Cooker Chicken Taco Soup on this site. Close, but a bit different and absolutely wonderful. **Just an update, if you really want to save this as I did, add a can of cream of chicken soup. Not very authentic for chili I know, but it did add a good chickeny something.

Used rotissarey chicken and just a smidge of the jalapeno and chili peppers taking warning from other reviewers.  Just enough of a kick.  At the last minute through in a can of drained corn for a lunch crunch.  Just fantastic and pretty healthy too!

This was delicious! We had to mild it down for the kids, but it was still fabulous. Just subbed green chiles for the jalapenos and just a dash of cayenne. So tasty.

My favorite soup.  It's hard to get something too spicy for me or my husband so this is perfect.  I use fresh roasted green chiles and fresh serrano peppers instead of canned but otherwise I make it exactly as written. Perfect served with corn tortillas and even better the next day.  Make this. You won't be sorry.

Very good chili. I followed the recipe exactly except for the jalapenos. I used half the recommended amount. It had enough heat to open your sinuses but not enough to be over powering. I combined ingredients as recommended then put them in the crock pot. I highly recommend a dallop of sour cream in your bowl!

This is good,I made my own broth from the chicken legs.  Boiled them with, onion, salt, pepper, cumin, mexican oregano.  Then used the broth and everything else in the recipe and threw it in the crock pot for a couple hours.

Use a bit more chicken and cut up small.  Use a little more cheese and make sure you grate it fresh as it is 100 times better that way. Only one can plus a little of the 2nd can of chicken broth. Be sure to blend 1/3 of the beans till thick like hummus. Serve with green onions, sour cream and cornbread. So good, this is now my go to recipe and I've been looking for a while. Thanks for sharing.

VERY good, although it is extremely high in sodium.  Try to cut that by using lower-sodium chick broth.

This is excellent White Chili but horribly hot!  I'll definitely make it again but eliminate most of the "heat".  I also pureed one can of the beans which made it a little hardier by thickening the base. Also had to eliminate the onions due to allergies. With homemade biscuits it was delicious.  Can't wait to make it again but a less hot version.

Love this! I changed the cayenne to Crystal Hot Sauce because I didn't have cayenne; and change 1 can of beans to 1 cup of corn. It's flavorful, easy to make and healthy! Try it! You won't be sorry.

I had to add on - I've made this so many times now and wanted to say thanks to Cathy! I make it as directed, and it's fabulous. Sometimes I add sour creme with the cheese. 

You can do the prep with this and leave everything but the beans in a slow cooker and add the beans at the end.

I used cannellini beans, navy beans, and great northern beans.  I also added in a bag of baby spinich at the end for color, health, and taste.  I skipped the cheese in cooking and served with a spoon of sour cream and sprinkle of cheese on top.

Awesome!  I've made this so many times and have shared the recipe as well.  Very simple to make.  I usually don't add any chilis (of any variety) or cayenne pepper for my children's benefit, but I do add them to my own bowl.

Fantastic recipe! I used 3 small fresh jalapeno peppers and roasted them, then took out all of the seeds. Did not use cayenne or green chiles to make up for that, but it was still EXTREMELY spicy. Luckily we love spicy, but next time we will probably only use 1 or 2 peppers to get more of the bean and chicken flavor. We also used dried beans (soaked overnight, then let the chili simmer for a little over an hour as opposed to 15 minutes), and used 2 cups homemade chicken stock and 2 cups of water. Also added a can of sweet corn and used cheese as garnish at the end. I used dried beans and fresh peppers to cut down on the sodium but then added my own salt near the end to bring out the flavors. Will definitely make again!

Thank you for this great recipe! I did follow other reviews by pureeing one can of white beans to add some thickness and adding the cheese at the end. I didn't think it was very spicy at all. We ate it with tortilla chips. Great for a cool spring day!

MMMM good.  Spicy. Used 2 cans of beans, one can broth and one can cream of chicken.
This time I blended one can of beans with some of the broth, one can of whole beans and added corn.  Just a dash of Cayenne pepper.  Still kicks with both cans of jalepanos and chilies.

It's spicy! I halved the amount of cayenne. I used a can of fiesta corn in place of one can of beans. Next time I will leave out the jalapenos and double the green chiles. Topped it off with queso fresco.

You go Cha Cha! I enjoyed this simple yet hearty white chili concoction. I used the notes from Candis and liked the consistency of the chili that resulted from the pureeing of one of the cans of beans. I also reduced the chicken broth to one can to thicken the soup. It might be helpful to note that three chicken breasts will yield the 3 cups of chicken required by the recipe.

I had to modify this for my family...I used only green chilis, no jalepenos, and cut the cayenne in half.  I also added a can of corn (great addition!) and pureed one can of beans to thicken up the consistency.  I added the cheese to individual bowls before serving.

Very good with the following substitutions: I used a 7oz can of chopped green chiles and omitted the jalapenos because i'm not really a fan.  I also cut the cayenne in half.  I love heat, but 1/2 teaspoon is perfect in my opinion.  I also used 4 cups of chicken stock instead of the 2 cans of broth, giving it a more pronounced chicken flavor.  To make the chili thicker, I mashed the beans up a little bit after adding them to the pot.  Absolute Mexican Cornbread is the perfect compliment to this chili.

The best white chili recipe on this site!  I eliminated the oil & just used the juice from the can of chilies for moisture to sweat the onions.  I agree with other users about the heat, it's a bit much (and we love hot!).  So, I used 4oz. of diced jalapenos to 12oz. of green chiles, subbed 2t. chili powder for the cayenne.  I used 6 grilled chicken breast for the 6 cups (grilling added a nice flavor).  The beans I used were Mixed Beans (northern & pinto) & Canellini (white kidneys).  I also held the cheese out to use for garnish & a dollop of sour cream on top is always great!  My health nut daughter said "Wow, you could sell this stuff!"  Thanks so much for the post Cathy!!

I make this all the time, my husband loves it.  Although I do not put as much of the chili peppers in, hubby don't like spicy, and I use ground chicken.  All in all this is Excellent!

I have been using the same white chicken chili recipe that I have been using for a long time.  My husband really enjoyed it, and I just wanted to try something new.  I have found my new favorite white chicken chili, this is phenomenal!  It's also easier than my previous recipe, and my husband says he likes it a little better!

I loved this recipe but was concerned about the chili being too thin.  Being a celiac, I decided to add some soft corn tortilla's to thicken and it worked perfectly!  I served with Chi chi's corn bread (also gluten-free!) on the side and was a hit with all.  Making again this week!

This is a very tasty recipe, but I agree with others that it is a little spicy.  I halved the recipe, used only green chilies, added 1 Tbsp. flour with the spices, and used one can of broth.  It had great flavor and nice semi-thick consistency.  I may cut down on the cayenne next time, but I will definitely make it again.

This is one of my boyfriend's faves on a cold, rainy night and is now in my rotation!  Sometimes I add a can of corn.
I use fresh jalapeno instead of canned and have substituted green salsa for the chiles.  I top with cheese, a dollop of sour cream and garnish with cilantro. It's a very pretty dish too!  My friends rave about it when they are over for dinner. :)

I turned this into a crock pot recipe and it turned out great.  I added all the ingredients to the crock pot(minus the jalapenos and cayenne to keep the spice down). I pureed 1 can of beans because it was too thin, and cut down on the chicken broth too.  I cooked on high for 4 hours then shredded chicken.  Served with cheese and sour cream on top.  I might add some black beans and corn next time for some color since it does look a little bland.

We loved this. I made it in the crock pot by pouring all of the ingredients (except one can of the beans which I pureed as suggested by another member)over a frozen chicken breast and cooking it on low for about 5 hours. Then I removed it, shredded it and added it back to the chili. Next time I will only use one can of broth. I think cooking it in the crock pot rendered all the juices from the chicken and made it too thin. I also added a can of corn and 1/2 cup fat free half and half to it and served it with corn bread.

This recipe won me first place in a chili cook off at work.  I tweaked it a little bit.  i used a rotisserie chicken and twice as many green chilis and no jalepenos. and to thicken it up a bit i, not only mashed up the beans with an immersion blender, but also added some powdered chicken gravy mix.
everyone loved it.
it really stood out because it was the only white chicken chili.  everyone else had regular chili

I have used this recipe before and been quite pleased. This go-round, I had cooked a turkey (**heads up to everyone who will have leftovers after Thanksgiving!**) and had lots of meat (and bones) to use up. I boiled the carcas for 30 min or so and was rewarded with a savory broth. I used this along with 3 cups breast meat and the end result was SO GOOD. I also followed other reviews: green chiles only, cheese only to top. Also added a small can of corn for a mild sweet note. Definately consider this as a post-Thanksgiving treat!!!

Great base recipe. I like to use fresh chili's and jalapenos. I saute them with the onions. We like our chili a little thicker-so I added 2T of flour with the spices and cooked for a few minutes. Just served the cheese on the side with sour cream. Yum-We like it hot!

Aside from shredding the chicken, I followed Hawesa's recommendations.  I thought the chili tasted pretty good.  My only complaint is that it was a little on the thin side.  However, the following day it thickened quite a bit.  It tasted better the 2nd day as well.

Very easy and fast-  I had to use canned chicken and veggie broth, but it came out great- i left out the jalapenos for less heat, and the green chilies were plenty to flavor and spice it for the less spice tolerant!   I added corn for color.
Great for a fast no fuss dinner!

Had this at a family soup pot luck.  This was voted the favorite by most.  I used 3 cans of white beans and one can of white kidney beans.  I accidently used mozerella cheese. (I grabbed the wrong "white cheese" from fridge!)  But is still was amazing!!!  I diced up my own jalepeno pepper rings (from a jar) and didn't put in the cayenne (I just don't love it.)  I also let it simmer in the crock pot all day, just because I didn't have time to make it AFTER work.  I would really recommend this recipe!!

This is absolutely delicious.  A few changes I made:
First I used 1 1/2lb of ground turkey instead of chicken.  I used 3 cans of chicken stock and added 1t of cinnamon.  I also used a real jalapeno instead of canned.  I put 3/4 of it in food processor along with 1/2 can of northern beans, and onion.  I omitted the red pepper.  It was plenty hot!  Next time I may even use only 1/2 of the pepper. I then simmered for 30 minutes.  Yumm!!

Fabulous! I did what some other reviewers suggested and cut out the cayenne completely and added one small can of mild green peppers (I am cooking for kids so couldn't make it too spicy!!!)..It was fabulous and everyone's been asking for the recipe now!!!

Very good soup, but I let it cook for about an hour before serving so the beans were nice and tender. I have someone with wimpy tastebuds in my house, so I subbed more green chiles for the jalapenos and paprika for the cayenne. It was still tasty without the heat. I used three chicken breasts, which I grilled with taco seasoning, and I think I could have just used two.

I made this soup according to directions.  The only change I made is that I thought it was too thick so I put 3 cans of broth instead of 2.  I thought the chili was better the next day.  I not sure I will make this again.  I have a white chicken chili that is to die for.

Awesome!! I didn't put in the jalapenos.  I  just added extra green chilies. I also put in 2 cups of Monteray Jack cheese at the end and let it melt.  I serve with crisp tortillas strips to put on top of.  I'm making it for the gang tonight for Monday Night football.

Great base recipe. I actually changed a few things which makes this a great recipe to use to make something your family will love. Both my kids ate it up and hubby liked it too! I added three different white beans(what I had in pantry), a can of stewed tomatoes, can of corn, can of reduced fat cream of chicken soup and three cans of chicken stock. No peppers added and I did reduce the cayenne pepper. Hubby added own hot sauce. Served with tortillas and mexican cheese. Yummy!

Excellent recipe with a few revisions: 1 tsp. of cayenne is way too much for our family (next time only 1/4 tsp.); added three (instead of two) cans of chicken broth; used 2 cans of green chile peppers (no diced jalapeno peppers); diced up chicken and cooked it along with the onion. Even though the cayenne pepper made this way too hot, we enjoyed it because I was able to dilute it down with the extra can of chicken broth. Thank you for sharing this with us.

This is delish!!  It is requested often at my house; even the picky ones gobble it up.  A few changes I make are I leave out the beans (not a bean eating family) and add two cans of corn.  Plus, right before serving I add one cup of sour cream.  This gives the soup a thicker consistency.  Served with homemade corn bread and salad rounds out the meal.

I made this tonight and the family loved it.  It's very spicy, but when served with sour cream, it tones it down to a nicely spiced soup. It is more mexican in flavor than italian.  I served it with tortilla chips, a relish tray, and peanut butter sandwiches. It was a fun dinner and truly tasty.  I highly recommend this recipe!

This is a great recipe!  The first time I followed the directions exactly.  The next time, I tweaked it a bit.  I cut back the broth to one can and slow simmered the chicken in the broth along with the onion and garlic first, rather than cooking in oil.  Used more chicken.  When adding the beans, I included the juice from one or two cans, to make a desired consistency.  I used either green chilies or jalapeños, but not both ~ too spicy for most.  After the soup bowls were filled, cilantro was sprinkled on top along with slightly broken corn chips and a shredded Mexican three cheese mix.  Yum yum!!

I love this recipe. I, like others, added 2 cans of green chiles instead of the jalapenos. Great flavor. I used a rotisserie chicken.

Pretty good...Aaron didn't like it as much as I did but the baby loved it!  She loves beans though.  I didn't add all the peppers b/c it would have been too spicy for the kids.

I get seriously impressed guests when I make this recipe!  My only changes are that I adjust the spices to my taste (fewer peppers, more other spices, and much less cheese to lighten it up a little), I shred a rotisserie chicken instead of cooking chicken separately, and I puree a can or two of beans to thicken the chili.  A squeeze of a lime wedge in the bowl before eating really brightens the flavor wonderfully.

Great recipe but... after making it exactly as stated, I felt it needed a little more flavor (other than just the "hot").  Added 1 cup corn (for a little texture), a large can of diced tomatoes, 1/4 cup chopped cilantro, garlic powder, juice of a lime, fresh cracked pepper, and 1 tsp. chicken bouillion granules. (It wasn't just "white" chili anymore) but with just a few changes, for our tastes, we love this recipe. Thank you so much for this terrific recipe!

Very good recipe! I did as some of the other reviewers suggested. Cut all the hot from the recipe..no red pepper or jalapenos. I used 3 cans of green chile instead and a little more cumin. I also used 1 can of garbanzo beans instead of one of the white bean cans because that's what was in my pantry. I also added 1 can of cope's corn (dehydrated yellow corn in a can for those of you who are not familiar) It added an unexpected texture and a nice bit of sweet. I served the chili with jalapenos, sour cream, diced raw onion, and the cheese that was supposed to be in the chili on the side. For those of you who count point valus for food, if you omit the cheese in the recipe the point value is only 6 for a big bowl of this great chili. Definitely a keeper!

I really enjoyed this dish a lot but didn't make it the way the recipe states.  I made this as a filler in a tortilla and pureed an extra can of white beans and mixed it in at the end to make it nice and thick.  It was super in tortillas!  Looking for a flavorful change of pace when it comes to tortilla filling?  This is it!

This was AWEsome!  With the changes that I made this was just spicy enough and just hot enough.  I like spicy, but don't like food so hot that I can't taste it.  What I did was add the cumin by 1/2 t. until it was spicy enough and added the cayenne by 1/8 t. until it was hot enough.  This was perfect!
Here are the changes that I made:
did not use jalapeno peppers (yes, I was scared), used 2 cans diced green chiles, used 1 1/2 t. ground cumin, used 1/2 t. crushed oregano (uh..I ran out, would have used more if I had it), used 1/4 t. ground cayenne pepper, only used 2 cans beans (one butter, one pinto...closest I had to white beans and two cans was plenty), added 1/4 c. sour cream (I wanted it to be more opaque than it was).  Oh yeah, for the chicken, I cooked one large half of a boneless, skinless chicken breast right in the chili.  When it was cooked through (about 20 minutes), I removed it and shredded it and added it back into the pot.

Excellent white chicken chili!  This chicken chili is the best!  My husband cannot eat spicy foods so I split the chili into two pots and add the chilis to one.  Instead of chopping the chicken, I shred it.  I serve extra chilis, sour cream, chopped ciliantro, chopped white onions and shredded jack cheese as condiments.

YUMMY!I will be making this again very soon. I added 6 to 7 cups of the beans pureed and 1 1/2 cups whole. I cooked a rotiserrie chicken in my slow cooker and used the broth.I used about 46 oz of broth. I left out the jalapeno peppers and cayenne pepper but used 3 cans of green chilies and 1 tsp of chili powder. I also added salt and pepper to taste. Besides using the monterey jack I also sprinked sharp cheddar on the top. Wonderful change from the traditional chili.

By FAR the best recipe I've found on this site!  The only change I made was omitting the jalepenos, and adding a can of white shoepeg corn.  I have people begging me to make this now!  A guy friend even offered me money to make this for his superbowl party!  Delicious!

Excellent flavor! I threw everything  including 3 frozen chicken breasts into the crock pot. I only had 2 cans of beans so added a large can of hominy and some cut up carrots. I love the texture and color they added. Had no cheese but it's delicious as is. Served over rice with cornbread - YUM! Thanks for this!

This recipe is awsome!  It has quite a kick!  We loved it!  We are going to try it next time with only the beans, maybe add an extra can and mash them a little to thicken it some.  But, the spice combination is so good, I woulnd't dare mess with it!  Yummmmmmmy!

Incredibly flavorful and fits all the criteria of a true comfort food.  The herbs and spices really make this a fabulous choice, especially the ample cumin.  And it is easily adaptable, as well.  This week I added some chicken sausage as well as the chicken breast, and used an asiago blend cheese, also mixed in a few pinto beans for color.  I brought it to a chili cook-off and it got rave reviews.  Thanks, Cha Cha!

This chili rocks! The second time I made it, I pureed 2 of the cans of beans as another reviewer had suggested.  It did make the chili thicker if that's how you prefer it.  That being said, the recipe is great "as is" and served with some cornbread on the side is the perfect dinner for when the weather starts turning cold.

This chili is AMAZING! This is one dish that my entire family asks for. The first time I made this it was way too hot for my children(they are 8 and 9). My husband and I LOVE spicy food and it was great. I played with the recipe and have made several amendments:
I use 6 cans of LUCKS  great northern beans...these are the thickest I have found and make it more of a chili
I do not use the jalapenos...I substitute a 4oz can of green chili peppers and serve jalapenos on the side
Cut down the cayenne to just a pinch
ADD 1/2 pint of heavy whipping cream...NO it is not healthy, but makes the chili DELICIOUS and controls some of the heat. I use 1 block of monterey jack  with peppers shreaded in to the chili and then add some to serve as a topping. IT IS AMAZING WE LOVE IT!

Love, love, love this chili!  It is my new favorite dish, and it's so easy!  Did not put in jalapeno peppers or the cayenne powder since I don't care for really spicy things.  Pureed 3/4 of one of the cans of beans to thicken it up.  For chicken, I cut up the meat from one rotisserie.  Delicious!

I love this recipe!  I add some canned diced tomatoes to it.  It is not so much white anymore, but I think the toms add great flavor.  Also, I love spicy food, but add cayane to taste.  You can always add more, but can't take it out if it gets too hot!

The recipe was great!!!  I actually used a rotisserie chicken due to me being pressed for time.  Personally I should have only used the white meat.  But overall it was delicious!  I waited until the next day to eat it so the seasoning had really settled.  I didn't have cayene pepper so I substitued crushed red peppers.  I love it and will be sharing the recipe with all my friends!!!

Everyone LOVED this recipe! I added one can of corn, one can of black beans, I pureed one can of the white beans, took out half the jalapenos, added another can of the chili's, put in 1/2 tsp of cayenne pepper, and sprinkled the cheese on top. It was marvelous! Thank you so much! I can finally make my husband say, "WOW, you really do make the best white bean chicken chili!!" It was worth every second it took to make it (which honestly wasn't more than 2 hours total, but definitely more than 30 minutes.

Excellent!! My husband said that he would like to try white chicken chili and I told him that I had a recipe that I wanted to try. Shame on me, for waiting soo long. We loved it and I didn't have any jalapenos or cumin on hand and it still was delicious. Thanks for sharing!!

If you're short of time, try using 2 cans of the 98% fat free chicken (found where you would find can tuna). I broke up the chunks of canned chicken with a fork and added the chicken along with the broth to the chili mixture.  My husband also added a can of diced tomato to his. (I'm not fond of tomato) To make the broth a little thicker, I followed the advice of another review and pureed one the cans of white beans before adding to the chili. This is very spicy, and I even left out the cayenne pepper. Very good if you like things hot!

This was absolutely delicious! I didn't add the onions because my husband is allergic and i'm not too fond of them, i would definately recommend this to anyone who loves spicy foods. We also made some cornbread to go with it, we just placed it on top of the chili in our bowls, yum!

I thought this recipe was very yummy. I like to double the recipe and freeze half for a later dinner. It is even better after it is frozen. It is also  good served over rice.

This was yummy!  We will definitely make again.  It seemed to be more of a soup than a chili to me, but aside from that, I can't say much bad about it.  Thanks for a yummy recipe!

Total comfort food.  This would be great for company too - - like during a Eagles' football game. I made this more like a hearty stew instead of a chili. I added cubed potatoes to thicken it up a bit.  But there really is no reason why I couldn't have added some kick to it by adding the jalapenos.  (I just didn't have any in the house).  Oh, almost forgot, I did throw in arugula right before serving for some color and texture.  This one is a keeper.

This was seriously good - very easy, and extremely tasty.  My husband and I needed some comfort food, and this hit the spot!  I hollowed out a crusty bread roll and served it inside this to soak up all the juices..we love hot food, and we used pickled jalapenos and one fresh green chili and it was hot enough.  Very good!

I've been thinking about making this all week and finally found the time to do so. Since I haven't personally made home made chili like this accept from a box this recipe gets 4 stars. The 4 stars are based on the fact I don't have anything home-made to compare it to & the extra step I had to include. 1. Easy Ingredients to find in your local store. 2. Easy to follow directions for a newbie making White Chicken Chili. 3. Full of flavor, the cumin & cayenne are a perfect balance, I sauteed the peppers in with the onions after the onions began to become translucent as well as allowed the full 3 minutes for the spices to toast and really release their flavor. 4. A great meal for hubby and I since we both enjoy spicy meals.

Recommendations based on our experience with the recipe: Add this step to create a thicker & creamier chili base. Blend or process  about 2 1/2 cups of (mostly) beans & broth with what onions and peppers happened to fall in the ladle. Pulse a few times and return to the pot. Simmer on low until ready to serve.

This was really good-- a little spicy for my taste, so next time I will cut out the jalapenos and pare down on the cayenne pepper.  I also added cornstarch to this to make it thicker. This recipe is easy to tweak to individual tastes, though.  I will be making this again

My husband really lkied it, but it was way too hot, even for him - and I used "mild jalapenos" I'll probably try it again - with no jalapenos, the mild green chiles should be spicy enough for us! Also, instead of two cans of chicken broth, I used one of broth, one of cream of chicken soup.  That thickened it up somewhat. The person who said a little tweaking will make it 4 or 5 stars was really accurate!

Tasty, but spicy to the point of making your nose run. AND I only used half the chilies! I also used 2 cans of beans of 3, which was a personal preference. I'd like to see the broth a little thicker. I think it could be a 4 or 5 star recipe with some extra tweaking.

What a wonderful recipe!  On my first try, I didn't do so hot on following the cheesecake rules (don't overmix, waterbath, etc.) and had giant cracks criscrossing the cake, and the outsides were a bit too done.  My second attempt was fantastic - I used room temperature cream cheese (creams better with the sugar, no lumps - less mixing!), pierced the egg yolks before adding to the cake mixture to avoid over-mixing, and baked directly in a waterbath.  Just be sure to use 2-3 layers of foil around your springform pan to avoid cheesecake soup.  One more tip: add the vanilla with the last egg - I found that when added with the flour it sucked up the vanilla and made little brown lumps.  You'll get TONS of compliments!  I served with strawberry sauce (berries, sugar, bit of corn starch, then blended) and/or crushed Heath bar.  My mouth is watering just writing about it!

I'm sorry to say that I just don't care much for this recipe.  I made the chili (which is a soup, don't let the name fool you) according to directions, except for leaving out the jalapenos, since my kids won't eat anything that's hot.  There was just too much cumin -- and I love cumin!  I also found that even though I didn't use low sodium broth, this soup needed salt to make it palatable.  It didn't thicken at all, even though I mashed up one can of the beans and cooked it for almost thirty minutes.  I was disappointed and I won't be making this again -- maybe another of the chicken chili recipes on this site will be better.

This was a hit at our Super Bowl party.  Very tasty and couldn't of been any simplier.  I did replace the jalapenos with extra can of green chili's.  I also cooked a whole chicken the day before and used white and dark meat.  For the white beans, we used Bush's Navy Beans.  I placed all ingredients in crock pot and slowed cooked for about 3 hours.  We added Colby Jack cheese when we served. Also, this recipes makes more that (4) servings as described.  But is great leftover too.  Everyone requested the recipe.  This will be prepared again & again at our house.  Thanks for the great recipe.

Yum - made for super bowl and had to taste test before we went to the party. Fabulous. I added a half-cup of sour cream at the end to make it more white. Also, like others, pureed one can of beans for texture. I think I'll let everyone add their own cheese. Thanks Cha Cha.

This is really a great recipe.  I used ground turkey instead of chicken and white kidneys for the beans because that is what I had on hand.  I didn't add cayenne pepper either because I don't care for it.  However, it came out great and I enjoyed it.  I will keep this in my recipe box.

This was great!  I omitted the jalepenos, added a can of tomatoes w/green chilis (along with the original can), omitted the oregano.  I also cooked cubed chicken with the onion and garlic.  Still quite spicy, but delicious.  My 10-year-old and hubby gobbled this up!  Thanks for a great recipe!

WE LOVE THIS RECIPE!! I have recommended it to several people, and they love it too. I do use Black beans instead of the white beans, and to me; that makes the soup just a little better.

A nice variation to the traditional chili. Careful, it's got some kick! The cheese is a great addition and makes the sauce nice and creamy.

Love this recipe!  I added more chicken, so a little more broth, and a can of chili ready diced tomatoes.  I also didn't put quite as much jalapenos.  It tast wonderful, the aroma while it's cooking is delightful.  I simmered it for several hours.  I will certainly make this again.

I made this for a party and everyone had me print out a copy of it before they left. I doubled the recipe for the party and only used one can of jalepenos. It was still pretty spicey. It was really an easy recipe too.
Thanks

Our all time fave chicken chili recipe! We LOVE spicy and this one clears the sinuses. If you want to less fat but a thicker texture, puree half the beans and leave out the cheese. You really don't miss it! This freezes really well. We generally saute uncooked chicken breast with the onion & spices when we back this. We serve it with cornbread. We always separate out part for our little girls before adding the jalapenos as they don't like spicy.

This recipe was really good, but way too hot for us and we acutally like food with a kick.  I will make it again with about 1/4 of the jalapenos.

Great recipe! Consider adding 10 oz of frozen corn for health purposes, definitely cut back the jalapenos, puree 1 can beans, add the cheese on the top only when serving.

Excellent chili! I used the recommended amount of jalapenos and chilis and found it to be the perfect amount of spice, however, I do like spicey.  I substituted one can of black beans for a can of white and simmered for an hour. It is very hearty and the flavor is awesome!  Will definitely be making this again in the very near future!

Excellent recipe!  Only thing I changed was I used a lot fewer jalapenos and I chopped them up myself since I had a jar in the fridge.  I kept some extra chopped jalapenos on hand when serving for anyone who wanted extra heat.  Very good with a dollop of sour cream put in each bowl when serving.  One note: do NOT use red Tabasco in this, as it changes the flavor completely.  Green tabasco would probably be okay in it.

Loved this recipe. I made it for a friend who needed and meal and also for a dinner party of close friends. It is easy. BUT IT IS SPICY. I made it once with all green chilies and once as the original recipe. I say just go with all green chilies unless you like it HOT. Also, I did add sour creem to the pot and stirred it in when all the cooking was done. Left it on the stove a few minutes more on low to warm back up.

ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS!! Very different and original. We talked about how good it was non-stop. The only changes made were I used a crock pot. I like soups that simmer for a while for more infusion of flavors. I did sautee the onion first, but put small cut up pieces of raw chicken in the pot. I pre-cooked a heaping tablespoon of flour in broth to add- to thicken it-because it was a little too soupy for our tastes.  Following the other reviewers advice, I just used the green chili's and skipped the jalepeno's and it had the perfect amount of spice., and we do like spicey, Cooked on high 2 hours.

Cha Cha, you know what you are doing.  I have made chicken chilis in the past, but this one is healthy and great.  I am on the south beach diet, so I just substituted extra virgin olive oil and reduced fat cheese--but it was GREAT!!

This is SO good! I have always been a fan of white chili but have never made it. This is fantastic! I made mine in the crock pot, and used the suggestion of pureeing one can of beans. It didn't thicken up like I thought it should (I'm not a very skilled crock pot cook), but when I served it I added a big scoop of sour cream to stir in and then the consistency was just right. I'm definitely making this again!

Very delicious!  Great for Fall.  I didn't add the jalapenos because I have two children. I will try it that way next time for me and my husband.  I cut down on the red pepper, too.  Still very tasty.  I will keep this one in my kitchen!

Excellent!!! I used ground chicken instead of cooked chicken breast which was easier and made it seem more like "chili" also--adding the sour cream is a MUST if you're looking for more of a thick chili-type soup. I also mashed one can of the beans and added a little bit of mesa flour (it was left over from a chili kit) and that added the perfect southwestern flair! Will definitely make again! Just the right amount of spice!!!

This soup was amazing!  It was so easy and took less than an hour to make! I used all green chili's (no jalapenos) because I am a wimp when it comes to spice, but it was still fantasic.  This was enjoyed by ages 9-50 at my dinner for 6 and was paired with Ceasar Salad Supreme.  Together it was the perfect combination for a light family dinner :)

Thank you so much for this wonderful recipe!!!!  I omitted the jalapeno peppers. I was scared :)  The taste was awesome!  My 13 yr. old daughter even loved it and she is a picky eater.  I will definitely double the recipe next time.

Very very good chili... We thought it was a bit spicy. I like heat but my family is a little leary SO I added one can of chilies and then only about a half a can of jalepenos and I thought I'd add more to my own. But when all was said and done that was perfect for me and a little too much for them. I like to make it and then in each dish add lots of co/jack cheese and then dip in the tortillas. YUMYUM

This is the best chili ever, I prefer it hands down to tomato-based chili any time! Nice and spicy -- makes my nose run but is not unbearable. Leftovers get better each day they sit. Pretty impressive for a one-pot dinner. Excellent!

Wonderful! I used 3 green chillies and Cheddar cheese and it came out perfect. Great leftovers, could not get enough!

Easy and good.  I reduced the chicken broth a little but that was the only change I made.

Pretty good stuff, but extremly spicy!! I used only a couple teaspoons of minced jalapenos since I have small kids, I also used an extra can of chilis and lots of a shredded mexican blend cheese. It really is more of a soup then a chili, next time I will probably only use one can of chicken broth. I garnished with a dollop of sour cream, and some hot salsa and it was really good! A nice change from the tradional red chili.

This is very good and very spicy.  I will adjust the spices a little next time.  I will also add a 4th can of beans semi-mashed next time for more beans and thickness.  Good stuff!!!

A real winner!  No changes to the recipe were necessary.  When we make this we usually double it so that we have leftovers for lunch and dinner!

EXCELLENT.  Here is my variation:  use only 2 cans white beans (do not drain) and purify in a food processor.  Added a can of black beans and a 16 oz. package of frozen corn.  Also substituted 1/4 + 1/8 tsp. garlic powder for the fresh garlic.  Put this in the Crock Pot for the superbowl and everyone raved about it.

I love this recipe, but i liked it with the beans drained. And if you take away the cheese and add 1/2 cup heavy cream, 1/2 cup sour cream, it's super creamy and delish!

Followed the seasoning quantities as written but the soup was way too spicy.  Next time, I will cut back on the cayanne.  I followed the suggestion of others and cut the broth by one can and pureed one can of beans.

A little bland, but used more spices to get things moving.  Served with bruschetta and wound up dumping the tomatoes into the soup for flavor.

This was excellent.  Was making for the first time for a church potluck, so I didn't want it to be too spicy.  I use two cans of chilis, 1/4 tsp. cayenne and omitted the jalepeos and it was perfect!  I added sour cream as a garnish and that made it good too.

This white chili recipe ROCKS! Everyone who tries it requests the recipe. I also add the juice of one lime, and a cup of fresh cilantro. We serve with avacado slices, and fried tortilla strips, even the kids love it when the jalapeno is omitted or reduced.

This turned out perfect!  I used leftover turkey from Thanksgiving (which was injected with jalapeno seasoning prior).  I omitted the jalepeno and used just a dash of cayenne since my kids would be eating it.  I did not have any trouble with the thickness.  I just cooked it 20 minutes uncovered at a low boil.  Once the cheese was added at the end, it was plenty thick.  Very good & will now be a day after Thanksgiving/decorate the tree tradition!

Mmmmmmmmm!  Had this dish for the first time a few years ago at a Ruby Tuesdays and have been hooked since.  Made is as Sunday dinner for my boyfriend and I a few weeks ago and we haven't stopped talking about it.  Followed the recipe to a tee (unusual for me) and it was perfect.  Had a great kick!

This was good, I did use one extra can of beans and a can of white sweet corn.  I drained everything before adding it and also put 2 cans of the beans in the food processor to created a more thick and creamy texture.  Thanks for the recipe and thanks for all the great tips!

This was great! I just used one can of chile's and left out the jalepeno's - I am a little wimpy when it comes to spicy food! I used 3/4 tsp. cayenne pepper - and it was perfect. Don't skip the avacados! They compliment it perfectly!

My entire family, including my 14 year old son who hates most everything, loved this recipe.  I am afraid of food that is too spicy, so I omitted the jalapeno peppers and just went with the green chile peppers.  Also, I only used 1/4 tsp of cayenne but we all decided that next time I will use closer to the tsp. that is in the recipe.  I used about 2 cups of shredded colby-jack cheese. I did simmer everything for about 30 minutes.  Wonderful!  The whole house smelled great.  Definitely a keeper. Thank you Cathy.

Flavor is fantastic. Texture- not so great. I was hoping for more of a thicker stewy chili- but this was soup with chicken and beans. I am not sure how I would thicken it up- maybe it needs to cook longer, or it needs more beans. I will keep working on it.

I've made this twice, and it's delicious. I poach the chicken in the chicken broth, and omit the cayenne pepper. I also add only part of the can of jalepenos, and it's still hot. I recommended tasting before adding too much heat. I also blend 2/3 of the beans in the blender. I use 1 can of white kidney beans, and 2 cans of great northern beans. Next time I might make it with more beans.

WOW! I LOVE chili!!! However, I had never had white chili, so I decided to give it a try. My boyfriend tried it first. He took one bite - and said you have to make this again!! What a wonderful meal!!! This is definitely a keeper! I did leave out the onions and used powdered garlic (our preference), and just used the broth from boiling the chicken (forgot to buy the canned broth - haha - but it worked just fine). Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly, and it was WONDERFUL!!! Thank you for a new recipe!!!

The recipe was good, but it was way to spicy for anyone to actually eat, we could only take small sips.

I've been using this recipe for over five years now and it always gets rave reviews. The only change I've ever made is to substitute a diced, seeded jalapeno for the canned; it seems to cut the heat while keeping the flavor.

Oh, this chili is devine!!  I've been making this for about a year now, and it is always a hit at our house!  I use mild jalepenos and add even more shredded cheese so that the chili is thickened by the cheese...it totally is the perfect meal with some lime flavored tortilla chips and a glass of lemonade!!

Quick, easy and very tasty!  A bit on the spicy side so limit the peppers if you're sensitive to that.  Great meal and easy preparation. Enjoy!

This recipe is fantastic.  I added one can of whole kernel corn and a few tablespoons of sour cream - everything else was just right.  My husband and son each had 3 bowls.  So much for leftovers!

This was wonderful!  I used a 7 oz. can of chiles and just diced up about 8 jalapenos so it wouldn't be too spicy for my daughter.  I omitted the cheese so it would be healthier and garnished it with fresh cilantro!  We didn't miss the cheese.  It was very fresh tasting and we will definately make it again.  Thanks!

i added a couple teaspoons of tabasco and about a teaspoon of worcestershire.  also, if you want to make the chili more creamy... crush about 1/2 cup of the white beans.  very easy to make and really yummy~~

This recipe meets my two most important criteria:  Delicious & easy to make!  I sometimes add a can of whole kernel corn for variation.  There were no leftovers when I took a pot of this to our annual office chili luncheon.

This was awesome.  I was a little scared about using the jalapenos so I stuck with all green chiles and it came out great!  The cayene pepper gave it plenty of "kick" for me and those I served it to.  I have shared the recipe with a few other people, and they too have had great results.  Thanks a bunch to both Cathy and ChaCha.

I made this recipe for my daughter's middle school chili/soup dinner fundraiser. I knew I'd have to tone it down for the public, but even after reducing the jalapenos, it was still quite spicy. I added brown sugar (not enough to taste) and sour cream. The combo helped alot. The sour cream made a richer base. I have had so many compliments on this! I've been told "it's the best chili I ever tasted" to "Please make this again for the next dinner"! Thanks for an awesome recipe!!!

This is so good!  Everyone in my family loved it and my 10 year old had 2 bowls.  The only changes I made were leaving out the jalapenos since I have kids and it would be too spicy and I added corn for veggies.  Very good!  Thanks for the recipe.

Yum.  I added: an extra can of white beans, mashed. This does wonders for the texture.  Also added a few tablespoons of chopped fresh cilantro, 1 tsp of chili powder, 1/4 cup chopped green onion, & 2 bay leaves.  Served with avocado slices on top.  This recipe is perfect for South Beach Dieters, all phases.

Wonderful recipe!  I made it at home, and my boyfriend loved it.  I made it for work a week later and won a chili competition.  Like others had suggested, I cut down on the spices (1/2 t. cayenne, 1 t cumin, 1 can chiles, no jalepano) and added less chicken stock (only 1 1/2 cans) and an extra can of great northern beans.  Definitely a keeper, thanks so much!

This is a good recipe.  The longer it simmers the better the taste.  I used 2+ cups of extra sharp cheddar cheese instead of monterey jack.  As the recipe states, this is a spicy chili!  For my husband, I would not need to change a thing.  For myself & others, though, I will use a bit less of the peppers.

This is sooo good!  I'v made it several times in the past few weeks.  As suggested by others, I puree one can of the beans for a thicker consistency, but other than that I haven't made changes.  Yes, it is hot - but you are warned of that ahead of time, so don't be surprised!  If you REALLY like hot, it's perfect.  My husband REALLY, REALLY likes hot & adds additional spice to his bowl.  He uses something called "Z" from CaJohn's Fiery Foods that has 4 million Scoville Units.  That's almost 7 times hotter than a habanero pepper.  Now that's hot!

I think this recipe is the best one I've ever had for white chili.  I've made this several times now, and I think each time I like it better than the time before.  Definitely a keeper!  However, it IS spicy, so I don't use the jalps.

I changed a few things. I only added about a Tbsp of the canned jalapenos, and instead of the chicken I bought a good-sized turkey breast, roasted it in the oven, and used the meat from that. (Do not over cook the turkey! Remember it will be cooked some more in the chili.) Also I just passed the grated cheese on the side. I also added some salt. With these changes, and served with warm flour tortillas, it's really great. My youngest had me make it for his 13th birthday party, and it was a big hit.

This was good, but like other users have said, it's more like a soup than a chili.  I will make it again, adding some mashed up beans to help thicken it, and adjust the spices a bit to our taste.  It makes a good starting place for creating a white chili that suits our family's tastes!

Excellent and super easy. I omit the green chilies and oregano and use fresh jalapeno and 2 10 oz. cans of chicken. Can make it thicker or soupier to taste by adding either more broth or beans and add heat to your hearts content! We like corn bread or garlic cheese bisquits on the side.

I love this recipe.  Used mild chilis instead of hot ones.  With the cayenne it was still plenty hot.  I am bribing my brother in law to help around the house by promising to make this recipe!

This was "ok" but nothing special.  My family liked it and we finished it all, so I can't say I was disappointed in it.  I used 2 cans green chiles and no jalapenos.  Maybe that's what was missing.  It didn't taste much different than white bean soup.  Good, but not great.  I'm going to keep looking for a recipe for the white chicken chili I get at restaurants.

I Made a batch of this soup to serve in my bakery/deli, made a couple slight adjustments...added some chopped cilantro. It got more than a few compliments, and a regular soup customer of mine, said it was one of the best ones I've come up with.  I had to be honest though, and tell him I had gotten the idea/recipe from this site, and changed a few things.  This was the first recipie that I've made from this sight, and was very happy with the outcome, thanks "Cha Cha"

This was a little to spicy for my taste...my husband says ketchup is too spicy for me. He loved this recipe. I will sub green chile for jalapeno and cut cayenne pepper in half for myself. Even though it was spicy I couldn't stop eating it!!!

Excellent!!  I've made this recipe many times since first discovering it.  Plus, I've given out the recipe countless times.  Everyone loves it!  I usually make the slightly less hot version, by increasing the mild chilis and decreasing the jalapenos.

Pretty good recipe.  I used ground turkey instead of chopped chicken.  I also added double the garlic and a little more of some of the spices.  By using fresh peppers and little more cheese, I think it has a more "chili-like" texture.  It is pretty spicy, so unless you like things hot, you may want to tone down the jalepenos and cayenne pepper.

This was my first attempt at a white chili and I am so pleased!  It was very spicy - but I liked it that way!  I served it with some corn bread and butter- YUM!  I am looking forward to going home tonight for the leftovers.  Thanks for a great recipe!!!

I made this for my boyfriend, my mom & my stepdad last night. Although it said 4 servings, I don't think thats entirely true. We all had to have very skimpy portions & also I only added 3/4 of a can of chicken broth & it was still soupy. But the overall taste was great! I'll make this again.

An instant family favorite!  I omit half the cayenne, so my guests can add more at mealtime if they want.  Fresh cilantro is also very tasty sprinkled on top with the cheese.

this was really good. an excellent variation. i however dont do spicey so i added just the can of chilis and no jalapenos, it was awesome. i also took advise and one of the cans of beans i used black beans... this was GOOD cuz it woulda looked really albino if it was all white. i also added a can of white corn and it was really tastey... thank you.

This recipe is awesome!  I used leftover turkey from Thanksgiving and used it in place of chicken!  This recipe has just the right kick, and the spices are so right.  If you love spicey or Mexican food you will love this!  I poured it atop crumbled corn bread in bowls and my boyfriend raved about it!  Definitely a keeper!

This chili was very good.  It was a bit spicy though, everyone who ate it kept blowing their nose.  Next time I would only add half of the can of jalapenos!!  Good flavor though, thanks.

This turned out great.  I did not use jalapenos.  The recipe description says "Substitute more jalapenos for the green chiles if you're scared!", but the green chiles we use are milder than jalapenos, so don't do that if you want it to be milder!  I've served this twice at parties and it always gets rave reviews.  I also added some lemon pepper.

This was such a great recipe. I added lots more peppers and it turned out wonderfully. Usually I have to add extra cayenne (it's out on the table with the salt and pepper at my house). This was great though. The flavor is amazing after sitting in the fridge and reheating! I added one can of black beans too because we like them a lot. Thanks for this recipe, I will make it over and over.

Pretty good -- I left out the cheese to make it a bit healthier, so it was kinda soupy.  However, once I refrigerated it, it seemed to tighten the mix up.  Definitely a spicy mix..........

Excellent! I've doubled and quadrupled this recipe for the office and it's always gone in less than 30 minutes! I've substituted habaneros for the jalapenos to give it a bit more kick, but it really doesn't need it. Again, Great recipe!!

Very good Chicken Chile but I'm going to have to tone down the heat index on this one.  This is a great tailgating food, especially on a cool fall afternoon.

Spicy and delish. Easy to adapt. Used 2 cans of rinsed blk beans bec that's what I had. Pureed a can of rinsed garbanzo to thicken it.
 Used 1/4 tsp red pepper and 4oz chopped jalapeños fr a jar. Didn't have any green chile's and I forgot to add the cheese. Still wonderful.

This turned out great! Good flavor. I made it a crockpot soup. Sautéed the onion and garlic first in oil on the stove for a few minutes. Then threw them on top of a large chicken breast (raw) and added remaining ingredients. Cooked for 6 hours on high. I left out the jalapeños and doubled the green chilies. And used 3 chicken bullion cubes with 4 cups water instead of chicken broth/stock. I think the cayenne is a key ingredient. Once completed i pulled the chicken breast apart with a fork to make it shredded in the soup.

I somehow managed to buy regular chili beans (pinto) instead of white beans for this recipe. I decided to try it anyway. Still turned out wonderful. I adjusted the spices to my family’s liking and since I was being lazy, just threw the chicken breasts into my crockpot with all the other ingredients (except oil) and let it cook all day. When dinner time came round we shredded the chicken and put it back in the pot. The sauce was way too thin for us, so I took a cup (or more) of frozen diced okra and puréed it in my blender until no okra was seen. Tossed that back in the pot and we had a thicker (and healthier) chili. No one was the wiser and everyone loved it. I also just sprinkled the cheese on top, as not everyone in my family is a fan. I put the leftovers in to-go bowls for lunches and threw them in the freezer. Now I have yummy lunches in a snap.

This chili is a winter staple for me. I crave it as soon as the weather turns cold. Sometimes I even male it in warmer weather if I have a cold or am in need of some comfort food. :-)

Not the biggest fan of chicken chili, but the family agreed that this was a good one. I’ll make it again.  Used one can of chilies instead of one can chilies and one can jalapeños.  Reduced cayenne by 1/2.  Perfect.

This chili was REALLY good. I toned down the heat by a lot but really liked the flavor combination. I used navy beans and pintos.

Due to the fact that my husband does not like things so spicy, I omitted the jalapeno pepper, cut down the ground cayenne to 1/4 tsp, cut down the cumin to 1 tsp and used two 4oz cans of mild green chilis. Great flavor but next time I will try to use shredded chicken instead of cubed.

I've prepared this recipe many times and absolutely love it. I love it for the great northern beans (not a bean fan-but these are the best  besides black). Also: it's easy, just a few ingredients, No Tomatoes! and it's very fulfilling and hearty tasting. I did change a number of the spices, I have a zero tolerance for Spanish hot. So I remove all Spanish spice and just add a half or whole 4oz can-depending on serving size-of green chilies. To me it's 'warm' but dull and non specific in it's hotness. I also reduce the chicken stock volume to half and I blend one can of beans of the total called for instead. Excellent recipe!! Love you for it, ChaCha!!

This was delicious. I did not include the jalapeños and it was spicy enough with the green chiles for my kids. I put it together the night before with rotisserie chicken and started the crockpot in the morning. My kids enjoyed the dish after school and again for a late dinner after sports. Thank you for the recipe.

Easy to make, great flavor. I doubled the recipe,,,,added an extra can of chilies by accident, but I think it helped. Used a whole roasted chicken shredded and chopped, as well as 3 cans white beans, 3 cans cannelloni. Made plenty for left overs. Only used 1tsp cayenne, and that was plenty for an 11 year old to enjoy.

The whole family enjoyed this for dinner, and was a great way to use up some leftover grilled chicken.  I toned down the spice for the kids and hubby, still plenty of flavors and very filling.

Easy and flavorful! Easy weeknight meal. Cut jalapeno and cayanne pepper amounts in half. Smash 1 can of white beans to make chili thicker. I used a precooked rotisserie chicken and used about 3/4 of it.

Delicious!! I always cook the chicken while I cook the onion, and also add a bit more of the seasoning while the chicken is cooking,  I’ll use the same pot while doing this and also use about a cup of chicken broth while letting g the chicken cook.  Once that’s done I’ll pull the chicken and while it’s cooling to chop add the other ingredients into the pot.  I also use rotel instead of the separate jalepenos and green chili’s-it’s better suited to our toddler’s spice preference.  Top it of with cheese and sour cream if it’s your preference, and you have one yummy meal with some cornbread!

This is by far the best chicken chili that I have fixed. I cooked my own beans and used the juice from the beans instead of the chicken broth, I also put a can of rotel with Jalapenos in.

My family isn't big on spicy food so I left out the jalapeno (and added some hot sauce to my bowl). I also added corn and some cream of chicken soup. Super duper tasty chili, will be making again!

This recipe was delicious!  We will definitely be adding it to our regular favorites.  I didn’t have cumin so I subbed for chili powder. Also, we like it hot so I added a teaspoon of red pepper flakes at the same time I added the chilis and the jalapenos.  My husband who usually complains when we have chili, had 3 bowls! Very tasty and definitely worth a redo.

Hubby and I enjoyed this and didn't find it too spicy for our tastes.  I just cooked the chicken in the pot. Next time I will take the suggestion of other reviewers and mash up one can of the beans to thicken it up some. I found it  too thin, more of a soup than a chili, but that's  just personal preference.

I've won a chili cook off (best overall and peoples choice) with this chili.  Its amazing.  I shred the chicken and sometimes I use a rotisserie chicken to shave some time off of it.

It was just ok. Without the cheese in it, it was a very basic recipe with not much flavor so the cheese was the key to the recipe. I don't like recipes where the cheese is the star of the recipe. Will not make again.

I’ve been making this recipe for a few years now and never tire of it!  I use 3 cans of green chiles and one can of diced jalapeños and cut the cayenne back to about 1/4 tsp. I use 3 cans of beans, one of them mashed up to thicken the chili. Rotisserie chicken works great for this too. Eliminate the cheese added in and instead serve on top with a dollop of sour cream and some scoop tortilla chips!

So Yummy!
I've made this several times.
You can add whatever you have in the cupboard and it's always great.  I like to throw in a can of tomatillos.  My kids like it with corn.  We like spicy food, so had no problems there. Thanks for this great addition to our family favorites!

Really enjoyed this!  Diced one whole fresh jalapeno, added a red bell pepper and a can of corn.  Cut back a little on cayenne, and seasoned also with salt and pepper.  Didn't measure the chicken stock, but added until it was the consistency I wanted.  Will definitely make again!!

Easy and very good.  I'm not a fan of cumin, so I cut back on that and added some fresh diced tomatoes and fresh cilantro. Great for those nights you need a quick, simple dinner.

Good but veers towards too spicy without enough actual flavor. I added some sour cream in addition to the cheese to mellow out the spices and I and my 2yo really enjoyed it.

I made a modified version of this and made soup, not thicker chili. I used one can of navy beans, 3.5 c. chicken broth, only 3/4 t. canned diced jalapenos (and that was plenty!), 1/4 t. dried oregano, 1/4 t. salt, three cooked chicken tenderloins, diced, about 1/2 t. cumin, and OMITTED the cayenne pepper and green chiles.

My daughter and I enjoyed this so much.  What a great comfort food as well. The only thing I added was one extra can of beans. I also baked 3 boneless chicken breast  with the same seasonings that is in this recipe and it was great with a side of cornbread.

This is my go to white chili the flavor is perfect.  

Personal preferences 4 cans of beans instead of 3.   2 cans of green chilis instead of 1 can green chilis and 1 can of jalapenos.

Delicious! I’m definitely making this again. The only change I made was doubling the chilies, and omitting the jalapeños because I felt it would be too hot for my family. Thanks for sharing!

Great recipe. I don’t care for super hot food, so I scale back the cayenne to a minuscule pinch and omit the jalapeños. No other changes are necessary. My family loves it.

Super good- the kids even liked it. Because it was for our family I did not use the jalapeños and only used a little cayenne. I did puree one of the cans of beans to thicken it a little. Awesome!

I threw 3 frozen chicken breast in the crockpot just covered with chicken broth, for about 3 hours on high. Then drained that liquid. I shredded the chicken (super easy), added a half diced onion back and about a 1/2 carton of chicken broth back to crockpot, let that simmer for 1/2 hour, added cane of white beans, Italian seasoning, salt, pepper, 2 cloves minced garlic and let it simmer another 1/2 hour. My fam ate it up. We added sliced avocados, sour cream and my kids scarfed it down with tortilla chips. YUM. Thanks for the recipe

I thought this was absolutely fantastic.

I like a watery chili, but my wife prefers thicker chilis, this will come out watery as is.

Others have suggested pureeing a can of beans to add in to thicken it, and my wife suggests flour. Your choice.

I prefer to go full board with the jalapenos, if it's too spicy I suggest a dollop of sour cream, or load up on cheese.

All in all, very delicious.

This is my go-to recipe for white chili.  When my family feels like having spicy hot chili, I add all the jalapenos and cayenne.  Otherwise , I halve them.  My husband loves this chili!

My husband used this recipe with a few minor modifications and won first place in a chili cook off.  
He puréed an additional 2 cans of beans in the blender and added them to thicken the chili and he used 2 fresh jalapeños instead of the 4oz can.

This is great. I didn't have pre cooked chicken so i diced raw chicken into cubes then cooked them in my dutch oven for my recipe, removing them once it was all cooked, but left all the juices in there to be absorbed by the onions etc. Doing it that way made it SUPER chicken flavor packed.
This one is a keeper and stupid easy!

Too hot for us, whew!!!  Beyond the heat, it was quite bland, remade with my changes.
Won't post here as not to upset anyone with changes made.  Greatly appreciate posting  your recipe, great for those who can handle the heat.

This is THE best white chili. I made it ages ago and then lost the recipe for awhile. Now that I found it again I almost cried. SOOOO good. Thank you for sharing.

This is a tremendous recipe. It has become a staple in my house. however... I have to cut the cayenne pepper, chili's,  and jalapenos in half. I love the flavor of cumin so I don't cut that more than 1/2 teaspoon. The thing is, I grew up on spicy foods. I LOVE spicy foods. But if I made this without cutting the peppers, I wouldn't be able to eat it. It has serious heat. by cutting the peppers in half, it is at the highest heat level that I can tolerate. My reason for saying this is, if you are someone ago doesn't like really spicy foods, you need to cut the peppers by at least half. But I definitely wouldn't omit either the chili's or the jalapenos. you need both for the flavor. omitting one would alter the flavor.

This was delicious, I read others reviews and did a couple alterations to fit my tastes. I don't like things too spicy and I like soups on the chunkier and creamier side so here's the changes I made. I didn't add any jalapeños and used 2 x 4oz cans of mild green chiles. I smashed one of the cans of white beans to give a creamier texture and also added a can of strained navy beans for extra chunkiness. I added More cheese than it called for (added to taste) and served with a dollop of sour cream and more cheese sprinkled on top. To save on time I got a store bought pre cooked rotisserie chicken and used all the meat I could get off of that (ended up being about 4 cups of cooked shredded chicken). It still turned out a tad spicy so I might use a little less cayenne next time. We loved it immediately and it was even better the following day.

I have been making Cha Cha's recipe for at least 10 years now and it never disappoints. If it is too spicy, it can easily be served with half the peppers and a huge dollop of sour cream. I recommend sour cream either way, because it makes the chile so creamy. Also, crumble some tortilla chips into it for crunch. Yum.

Not  bad...not great.  Didn't have to modify the recipe much.  Used dry beans (1 lb.), added 1 tsp. salt,  used only 1/4 tsp. red pepper, an extra cup of chicken and pureed a portion (before adding chicken and peppers) to make it creamier and thicker.  Kudos for the base recipe...it just wasn't "WOW" enough to put it into a regular rotation.

Love this! Normally would rate as written but I just prefer less hot so am rating 5 stars. I just use more green chilis in place of the jalapeños, and add cheese & sour cream on top. I multiply the recipe, freeze some and eat leftovers, which are delicious!

I've been making this for years and have never met anyone who did not love it.  I take it to potlucks, make for parties or just for my own picky eaters and it's always a hit. I generally make it just as written but it's easy to tweak.  I don't like cheese so have never added it.  when I share the recipe I let people know there is no cheese and how much they should add, but most people feel it's great as is and never end up adding the cheese.    Based on who I'm feeding I add/subtract the amount of chili peppers/jalapenos, spices.  I usually just smash up one can of the beans to help thicken the chili since I don't use cheese. Great recipe that has been shared many times!

I have been making this dish for a couple of years now. It is one of our favorite soups, and my family prefers it to tomato based tortilla soup.   I like it because it is easy, quick and delicious!  

Often, I use 2 cans of northern white beans and 1 can of three bean blend (black, kidney and pinto).  I always leave out the jalepeños and cayenne, as my family doesn't dig that sort of thing.  I serve options like  cheese, tortilla strips, avocado, sour cream.

This was delicious! I made it for little bitty ones, my mother and grandpa who can't handle spicy, and my father and I, who both love spicy. I omitted the jalapeños and just did 8 oz of green chiles, and cut the cayenne in half to be safe. It wasn't spicy at all, but full of flavor still. My picky 3 year old sister said it was "awesomeness." And us spicy-lovers were still satisfied without the heat. We ate it with tortilla chips, it was a good combo.

We like spicy chili so the spices here were great for us but may be too hot for some. Second the amount of liquid that the recipe calls for is fairly high. I cut the liquid in half and then even use a quick slurry to thicken it up a bit while it simmered.

Another step I took was I did this in a fairly big pot so I cooked the chicken in the pot first removed it, then did the onions in the chicken fat and a bit of broth. Then added the rest of the ingredients as noted. Turned out great! AS usual a recipe is just a guideline for anyone. Make it your own.

Very good.  I  cut the cayenne in half, and used some frozen chopped jalepeno from the garden ( I'm guessing equal to less than half a can or equal to 1 jalepeno without seeds).  It had just the right amount of heat for me. Topped it off with some fresh cilantro from the garden and a dollop of sour cream. Yummy!

As per other reviewers, I eliminated the jalapeno peppers altogether because I didn't want it that hot. I also used 3/4 tsp of cayenne pepper instead of 1 tsp.  I may add some corn next time to give it a little sweetness to contrast with the spiciness. This was a good recipe. We ate it with some tortilla chips, which added a nice touch.

Excellent dish. It's my first time having chicken chili and I enjoyed this dish. I omitted the green chilis because I was worried it was too spicy. 1 jalapeño with the seeds was spicy enough. Based off the other reviews, I only used 2 cans of beans. Overall, an excellent dish!

This was delicious!   I like the added can of mashed up white beans to make it thicker..     I added a can of corn for the crunch factor.  Next time I'll add some black beans as well to make it more colorful.
I will keep this recipe for sure!!

I actually added a lot to this recipe. I added one chopped bell pepper, a can of tomatoes with chilies, and I used a 7 ounce can of chilies-no jalapeños. I only used one can of Great Northern beans and added a can of pinto beans and kidney beans. I like color! I accidently put in too much chili powder so it was a little hotter than I intended but it was a tolerable heat! Added cheese and ate it with some organic blue corn tortilla chips. My husband and I liked it and it was perfect for the Superbowl! Or should I say "Souperbowl"?

Cha Cha's white Bean Chilli
Delicious!  I only had 2 cans of the beans;; and I halved the pepper and other seasonings.  I used two frozen jalepenos, from my garden, taking the seeds out instead of the can of jalepeno peppers---the result was great!

I substituted adobo seasoning for the oregano and jarred diced chipotle peppers (~1.5 peppers) for the jalapeños and green peppers which added a nice smokiness and plenty of heat. The chili turned out incredibly delicious! Thanks for the recipe!

This was delicious with the spices toned down. I usually try not to change these recipes until I make it once as originally written, but I knew I couldn't handle the spice. I changed 3 cloves of garlic to two, used 1 teaspoon cumin instead of 2, and eliminated the can of jalapeno peppers. Instead of 3 cans of white beans I used 2 plus 1 can of roasted corn. It was delicious!!

After making many times, I know use 1lb of ground chicken and 2 chicken breasts. I don’t put jalapeños in and 1/2 the cayenne. I use northern, chili beans( not drained) and pinto. I add 1/2 tea of chili powder. I serve with sour cream  and cheese on top. Delicious,!

Sooo yummy served with chips, cheese, avocado and sour cream! Also, we used fresh jalapeño (1.5) and for the beans, 1 can white, 1 can black, 1 can garbanzo. Will absolutely make again! Enjoyed the spice.

Quick and simple. Very flavorful for having so few ingredients. I added yellow bell pepper (cause I had it), cilantro and didn't add the cheese as instructed. Kept cheese as an optional condiment.

I used rotisserie chicken, 2 cans northern beans, 1 can of black beans and added a can of corn. I only used about 1/8 of cayenne pepper, 7oz can of green chile pepper and added plenty of salt, pepper and 1/4 tsp of garlic powder (I only used 1tsp of minced garlic during sauteeing, prob could've used more and eliminated the garlic powder later). Didn't use cheese to cut down on animal product. Overall, very delicious!

My older son came to visit and had a massive bowl.  It was enough for 3 bowls.  Luckily I had an extra can of beans, green chiles, spices, and broth to throw into the pot to make enough for the remainder of us.  It all blended together very well, and only took minutes to add the extra items.  As my family said "oh this is good".  This recipe was so good, and easy, boys asked for a copy of the recipe.  So now we all have it.  I intend on making this for super bowl.  Thank you for your submission.

This is a great and quick cold day recipe.  It's also a great way to use leftover chicken.  It was a little too spicy for me with all the peppers and the cayenne.  Being from Texas, I'm not a huge green chili fan, so I left those out and used half the jalepenos called for and about half the cayenne.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe to the tee and it came out great.  I used leftover chicken from a slow cooker meal I had made, but I imagine leftover rotisserie chicken work well, too.

I have made this several times. The last time I needed to adapt it for vegetarian audience, so I substituted Quorn products for the chicken and veggie broth - outstanding! Garnished with avocado, cilantro, creme fraiche & grated cheddar. So versatile - perfect flavor base for getting creative with meat(less) options

OMG, this recipe. So simple, but grand. Really, incredible. I made a few changes because I prefer my chili to be thick. If you do as well, follow these tips. 

Puree one can of the beans. 
Simmer for longer to burn off extra water and mend flavors (or make your chicken broth 'denser') 
Add a can of cream of chicken (if you like it creamy) 

The other things I changed... 
One fresh jalapeño instead of canned
Reduction in cayenne 
Chicken heavily seasoned with cumin, salt, pepper and garlic while cooking

This recipe is amazing and a staple in our household now. Seems like it can easily be thrown into the crock pot as well which is such a plus.

This is one of the easiest recipes to make because you can substitute fast solutions when necessary.  Fresh chicken, slightly frozen cuts the easiest and when thrown in towards the end of cooking will make the chicken nice and tender, but if you're in a hurry, you can get away with using canned chicken, juice and all.  The canned juice actually adds a bit of flavor and as long as you use a quality canned chicken it still tastes great.  I also added about 1/2 c. of sour cream near the end to add a creamy flavor and texture and I garnish this with Cilantro.  Another great add is dill.  Dill is great with this dish as well.

My family really enjoyed this chili.  The only thing I changed was cutting the cayenne pepper to 1/2 tsp and it was still a little spicy for me.  I also mashed up one can of the beans to make the broth a little thicker and creamier.  We added a dollop of sour cream and it helped tone down a little of the spiciness.

Very tasty, I used the mild green chile peppers and it still had a nice kick to it.  Everyone raved about it.  I think the next time, I will add more cumin since I love cumin and maybe a little cornstarch to thicken it up a bit.

I used 3 hot peppers, and half of the cayenne. Also, I didn't have monterey cheese so I used mozzerella. I also added chicken boullion to give it a little more flavor. Very good :)

This was very easy to make but I didn't have all the ingrediants...I substituted 3 cans hominy for the beans...2 large cans chicken for the raw chicken...3 TB chopped garlic in oil for the garlic cloves...1 (7 oz can) chopped green chiles and 2 cups Colby-Jack instead of Monterey Jack.  I, also, topped each bowl with a large dollup of sour cream.  Everyone loved it!  I usually put both hominy and white beans in my white chili because it seems more hearty to me that way but this is real good, too.

The flavor is absolutely outstanding!  And that is without the cheese yet.  So I did make it a tad different....I started with frozen boneless, skinless chicken breasts (3) and cooked them in the chicken broth.  Then I took the meat out, shredded it and set it aside while I strained the broth...it had a lot of chicken gunk in it :(  While the meat was cooking, I chopped the onion and garlic and measured the seasonings.  Sauteed the onions, garlic and seasonings according to directions then added about 1/2 of a fresh jalapeno (diced) with the seeds removed and a small pack of Hatch, New Mexico green chiles that I had in my freezer (grilled with skins removed before freezing)...probably 3 times what the recipe called for.  Added the strained chicken broth and simmered it for about an hour before I added two cans of S & W chili seasoned white beans with liquid (didn't have 3) The aroma is amazing and the flavor is unbelievably good!  Can't wait to try it with the Monterey Jack cheese.

So delicious! Thanks to the previous reviewers, I toned down the spiciness and seeded the jalapeños before chopping and adding to the chili. I used two drained cans of Great Northern beans, and added about 12 oz of leftover homemade pureed white bean soup to the mix. I used about 2 cups of chicken stock made from pouching two large skinless boneless chicken breasts and added a tsp of "Better Than Bouillon." The chicken was shredded and I put everything into a slow cooker on low for a few hours.  Thanks for an awesome chili!

This was way too spicy for my liking. I couldn't taste the other ingredients! Next time I'll halve the cayenne pepper and substitute another can of green chiles for the jalapeños! Other than that, it was great!

Based on other reviews mentioning this was overly spicy, I used only one can green Chilis and 1/2 teaspoon cayenne.  Also two cans of beans.  Turned out great! May reduce the cayenne a bit more next time and try more green Chilis. But all in all it was a huge hit - even though I forgot the cheese!

I have a young son who doesn't like a lot of spice the rest of us REALLY enjoy spicy, but for the sake of our youngest I opted to omit the Jalapenos and use a second can of green chilies as suggested. I  only used 1/4 tsp cayenne. I used a cooked Costco chicken ( measure out 3 cups of meat) and froze the rest for future use. Used the carcass to make my own broth, Only used 14.5 oz of the broth and pureed one can of beans. I added the cheese to the bowls as I served them.  Everyone LOVED it. Served with sweet corn bread cake. This is a keeper! Thanks Cathy!

I mostly followed this recipe.  I read the reviews  and left out the jalapenos and reduced the amount of cayenne.  I found that this left the chili not spicy enough.  Next time, I will keep the cayenne at the normal amount.  I found that 2lbs of chicken was sufficient to feed 4 people with left overs.  I did add a can of cream of chicken soup and still used 2 cups of chicken broth.  I did not need to puree some of the beans.  The chili was thick enough and not soupy at all...I found the amount of cumin, oregano, and garlic to be great.  It was easy to make and not time consuming at all.  I cooked this in a cast iron pot for a camping meal.

This was very good.  I used one can of chicken broth, omitted jalapenos, and cayenne  and used 4 cans of beans. I also used raw, skinless, boneless,  chicken breasts which I seasoned with salt, pepper, and garlic powder and put everything in crock pot for 4 hours on high.  Just garnished with cheddar cheese.  Made it again as above, but added a dash of cayenne and chicken broth to get consistency I wanted.  Forgot all about the cheese which is amazing since I am a cheese lover.  Hubby and I both loved it.

I used this as a base for my chili that has won several awards.  Make sure to put in only half the peppers and chiles unless you like burning your tongue off and even still it is fairly hot.

Love this recipe! It is easily modified. I usually make it in the crock pot for 8 hours and add/substitute the following depending on what ingredients are in the house:
32 oz of chicken broth, 1/2 fresh jalapeño (seeds removed), fresh cilantro, 48 oz jar of great northern beans, uncooked cubed chicken. Sometimes I add a cup of frozen corn too.

I've made this recipe several times now. Like others have mentioned, I eliminated the jalapeño and substituted 1 can of mild green chilies in. I also eliminated the cayenne and used a couple teaspoons of white chili powder in its place. I'm not a fan of super spicy! To thicken it, I decided to take a can of fat free refried beans off the shelf...dumped into a bowl and added 1/2 cup of chicken broth and just stirred it up a bit! Turned out great!

Since this was made for my daughter's family and the grandchildren I toned it down by skipping the cayenne and jalapenos. It was delicious and my son-in-law loved it. I gave it 4 because it would have been way too spicy as written for us. Also I soaked 1 3/4 cup of white beans and cooked those before combining rest of ingredients. Thanks Cathy I will make my version of this again.

We love this as a basic recipe, but I do make a number of changes, as it is far too spicy as written. I TRIPLE the recipe, so all of my suggestions are based on that quantity. Instead of 3 cans each of the peppers, I use 2 cans of the jalapeño peppers and 3 of the diced green chilis. Instead of 6 tsp. of cumin, I put in 4 slightly rounded. Instead of 3 tsp. of cayenne pepper, I put in 1 heaping. I make the chicken really easy by using a large (50 oz.) can of diced chicken. Made as written, the recipe is more of a soup; since we like our chili thicker, I only use 1 large cardboard container (32 oz.) and 2 cans (14.5 oz.) of chicken broth. Using these quantities, we get a chili that is just the right heat and fits in my large crock pot perfectly (I throw everything in at lunchtime and put it on high for a few hours, then down to low when we leave for after school activities. It also works to put in on low for the whole day.).

This was a great recipe esp for my last minute dinner. It was rainy and cool and chili sounded fantastic when I got off work, I searched white chicken chili since i only had white beans and chicken and made this one.
Only changes I did puree 2 cans of beans to thicken and used the other 2 for the Chile whole.
I also added about 1/4 a cup of salsa verde i had in the fridge with the green chiles since i didnt have jalepenos and also added a bit of garlic salt and cumin in with the beans i pureed.
Great recipe cant wait to have for lunch 2morro as well

This was very good. I used 3 nice sized chicken breasts and followed the rest of the recipe to a T. I now have enough to feed an army! It is very spicy so I had previously made some homemade sweet corn and threw it in the pot after it was done and heated through to cut some of the spiciness.  I also added a shake or 2 of seasoned salt. Other than that I didn't stray from the recipe. Pretty Tasty!!

This has become my go-to White Chicken Chili recipe; I've made it many times. It's a great dish to throw in the crockpot for a Halloween or Super Bowl party. My only change is that I don't add the cheese to the pot. It doesn't really add to the flavor and adds a lot of calories. It's much better just sprinkled on top to taste. Great recipe!

This was excellent chili. I made some revisions due to necessity and desire. Added only one can of green chilis. With that and the cayenne pepper was plenty spicy for us. I added a can of whole kernel corn and a can of cream of chicken soup to thicken it somewhat. I added 6 cups of water with chicken flavored Better than Bouillon in lieu of canned chicken broth. The cheese I had on hand was a Mexican blend, which worked out perfectly. Ok, everything's not white for sure, but it's sure good.

I love spicy food but this was way too hot for my taste. The first time I made it exactly as the recipe was written and it was too hot for my family to eat. The second time I doubled the chili peppers, omitted the jalapenos and used a 1/4 tsp of red pepper and that made it a 5 star recipe.

What an easy recipe that tastes awesome!  I have made this Chili a couple of times now and it is my go to recipe when I have leftover Rotisserie chicken (I make the chicken broth from the chicken carcass in the slow cooker and add that to the recipe the following day).  I go light on the spices as a personal preference and used black beans since that was what I had, and added a little Salsa (Verde or Traditional) for a little zing.  It is so easy to through together.

The wife and I really liked the recipe. I made just a couple of changes. I used fresh jalapeño and poblano peppers instead of canned and added a little sour creme, chopped green onion and a little cilantro for garnish.

Doubled this recipe and made it during a snowstorm. My friends loved it! The next day we drained off the liquid and spooned it over tortilla chips, covered with cheese and baked it for 10 minutes. Delicious nachos!!!

This recipe is very delicious and easy to make!  I always get complimented on it by family and friends.  I always serve it with cilantro, avocado slices, chopped green onion and grated cheese.  I often add fresh chopped jalapeno.

Made it for a big family dinner, but had to sub out the red pepper &  jalapenos for chili powder & canned tomatillos because one of my guests can't eat spicy food due to health reasons and it turned out perfectly mild and absolutely DELICIOUS!  I left the green chilies for flavor and it still worked out well, seems all the spice comes from the red pepper and jalapenos.  I do plan to make a pot using the jalapenos down the road.

I did mine in the slow cooker and used chicken breast diced up. I recommend draining the juice in two cans of beans and holding to the side to add later if not moist enough or either less chicken broth. Also, I cut back on the jalapeños because my husband and child don't like really spicy foods. Overall, we all loved it. I did have to add some cornstarch mixed with some water to thicken it up a little.

I tripled the batch and used 8oz mild jalapenos, 8 oz green chilis and only about 2 tsp. cayenne for spices.  My husband thought it could be spicier, but I needed to make sure the kids would eat it too.  It's difficult to find recipes that all, or even most of us will eat, much less honestly enjoy.  Out of the 9 kids, only one didn't care for it, but she still ate it.  My picky eater had 2nds.   So I'd call it a success.

I made this exactly as written and as another reviewer mentioned it is definitely a "soup and therefor the 3 stars".  I even used less broth as per other reviewer's suggestion and with one can of beans pureed in, it still had a soup consistency. To me and my family it was very close to chicken tortilla soup without the tortilla!  Tasty but will not make again as chili!

Absolutely great! This chili was so incredibly flavorful. The only adjustment I made was to nix the jalapeños (we like food a little milder) but I added roasted tomatillos in their place. Next time I might just use 1 can of the broth VS 2 because it was a little more watery than I would have liked. Overall it was a huge hit!

This is a great Chicken Chili recipe.  I did add about a tablespoon of chili powder.  I also added a can of Cream of Chicken Soup, to make it thicker.  I also added Rotel Tomatoes, instead of the green chiles.  The family loved it, which I have a very picky husband.

Made it slow cooker style with the same ingredients....yum!  Started with the oil, onions and garlic in the crock, added 3 frozen chicken breasts then the remaining ingredients except the cheese.  After 6 or so hours, I cut up the very tender chicken then let it cook a few more minutes.  The cheese was offered on the side.  Good recipe, thank you!

This is a very easy recipe. I read all recommendations before making this. I sautéed the chicken in onion and garlic first. I also added a can of corn and cream of chicken along with chicken broth. I love spicy food but was nervous after reading reviews so I did one can of jalapeño and 1 can of mild chillies and reduced cayenne pepper to 1/2 teaspoon. I figured I could add extra heat if needed after I made soup. This is a great recipe!! Thanks for sharing!!

Holy Toledo!  That is way too spicy and we like spicy food.  I definitely won't make it as stated again.  I will put another can of green chilies instead of the jalapeños and I'll prob cut back on the cayenne pepper also.  Otherwise, from what I could taste, it was good.

I dropped the cayenne amount by half. I added a 1/4 teaspoon ground coriander. I was generous with the chicken, and only used two cans of great Northern beans. I omitted the green chilies, and only used 1/2 of a  jalapeño.  I also used five cloves of garlic. I can't help myself. I tweak recipes all the time.  My husband loves it. MAN approved!

Followed other reviews and only added 1/3 can jalapeños, mashed a can of beans and added to soup.  Added a little more cumin and taco seasoning and topped with sliced avocado & scallions.  It was the perfect heat.  Absolutely delicious and so easy!

I've made this a few times and like most reviews I think it is hot so I now use the mild chilis, cut the jalapeños required in half and use a pinch of cayenne and if I think it needs more towards the end I add another pinch stir and let it simmer in for a couple minutes and taste again, I'll do this until it's got the desired bite.  The cumin I think is the spice that gives the chili it's unique flavor so I usually  add whats in the recipe.  I'll also substitute 1 can of rinsed black beans for a can of the white beans just to give it some color and then add a small can (or a few large spoons) of drained corn.  I've found what works best for the chicken is I'll buy a cooked rotisserie chicken and use both the dark and white meat, it's moist, tender, flavorful and really easy.  Adding the cheese at the end is what thickens it up and it helps a little in cooling the spice down a little.  Take some sour cream and thin it out just a little with milk and drizzle over the top.  Best Chicken Chili you'll probably ever have !!

This was delicious, but I did have to tweet it a little. After reading other reviews, I only used one can of chicken broth and added one can of cream of chicken. This made the sauce nice and creamy. I also put in 1/2 the jalapeño and 1/2 cayenne. I didn't have green chillies on hand so I just omitted them. I also added one can of black beans and one can of corn. It gave the dish some color and added flavor. I also didn't have any Monterey Jack cheese, so I just used cheddar .  I served it with brown rice. The amount of spices I put in was just right. The heat wasn't overbearing but gave the dish a nice spicey zing.  My family loved it!

Followed the recipe except I substituted  a second can of chopped green chili for the jalapeno which I love but my family does not... The soup/chili was great when fresh and even better when warmed days later for lunch. I did puree one of the cans of white beans. I think next time I make this recipe I will substitute or add a can of black beans.

Excellent recipe and followed the most popular suggestions in the comments section.  Cut the broth in half as I like my chili thicker; added one can of diced tomatoes; did not use jalapenos and doubled the diced green chiles; cut the cayenne in half (yielded this time to my daughter's request).   I strongly suggest you try this recipe, it is a keeper!

loved this recipe! My husband and I couldn't get enough.  I also loved how easy it was to put together.  Thanks for a good white chili recipe.  It did come out spicy which we liked but it tastes great with a little plain yogurt or sour cream added tableside to temper the heat if one thinks it's too spicy

I love this recipe.  I'll mix it and put it in the crockpot on low. (Especially with dried beans that have been soaked overnight).  It's just spicy enough for my family!

Very good. I did half the Cayenne pepper and no jalapeños and it still had a decent kick. I also blended one of the cans of beans before adding. I will definitely make it again. Easy yummy soup

In my house this has become known as Tim's Second Place Chili. I have taken it to 5 different chili cook offs between church and work and won second place every time. I love this recipe, and it is my go to on cold winter days. I keep a good stock of all these ingredients on hand so I can make this chili at a moments notice. I almost always make a double batch as it disappears too quickly.

At the suggestion of others on the site, I left out the cayenne. It was PLENTY spicy without it. Also, I threw in some bacon.

As with most recipes we tailor for our families, it always takes a great base recipe to begin with. This is delicious the way it is, but when you have a family of 6 to please....I always have to double the recipe (or we'd run out mid-meal because of our two teenage boys) omit the jalapenos, double the green chiles,  double the chicken, use taco seasoning instead of cumin/oregano/cayenne mix, and use a potato masher at the end to thicken it up. Yummy!

Note: I've read some add everything into the pot and then begin cooking. I do make some soups this way, but this particular soup is amazing if you take the time to saute the onions, garlic and jalapeno before adding the stock. If you make it this way add some flour just before adding the stock and it makes a lovely thick soup. On with my review: I made this lovely recipe and it's spot on. After making it as it is listed I decided to up the ante a bit (not because it needed it, but because I had some items I needed to do something with. I had some lacinato kale that needed harvesting a bit so I added a good hand (bunch) chopped finely. I added some of my fresh herbs; rosemary, oregano and parsley. I also added a few small bay leaves to my chicken breast and stock along with some black peppercorns. I had half a smoked turkey sausage left from a gumbo I made over the weekend so tossed that in as well (I would have normally added pimenton for the smokey flavor.) I like making a BIG soup kettle of soup so I can freeze some for those work lunches and weeknights I don't feel like cooking so added a large and small potato to thicken up the big pot of stock.  I love this versatile recipe! Thank you for sharing.

I found that 15 minutes of simmering was not nearly enough to reduce all the broth down so it looked like chilli instead of soup. I simmered for longer and added 1 tbs of flour to help thicken it up. However I otherwise followed the recipe exactly and it came out delicious. So spicy! Yum!

A solid, "feed a crowd" recipe.  I love it as is, but sometimes I add cream or sour cream and more jalapenos.

This chili was so good!  I used rotisserie chicken.  I put two cans of green chili instead of jalapenos.  I added about 1/8 tsp of the chili powder, because I'm a spice wimp!  Added sour cream and cheese to the bowl and topped it with green onions.  I will be making this again and again.  Thanks for the recipe!

I made this recipe as instructed, except I used 1/4 tsp of cayenne instead of 1 tsp. At the grocery store you will likely have the choice of mild or hot green chiles in a can. I chose mild.  I like the flavor and spice of jalapenos, so I kept them in. The flavors were hot, but pleasantly so. Definitely not unbearable. It had a good kick.  Of course this is all to each person's taste--what is mild for one person is too hot for another. If you are concerned about the heat level, use mild green chiles  and play with the amount of cayenne. You can also buy "tamed" jalapenos in a can, if you want the flavor but not the heat. FYI--this chili is actually more green than white, if that matters to you.

This a keeper! It is spicy but that's the way we like it. Too many "chicken" or white chili's are bland...but not this one. I did make the day before ( read in one review) & puréed 1 can of the beans with some chicken broth for creaminess. I did not stir in the cheese but left as a garnish for everyone. Also served w/a dap of sour cream which helped to cut the heat. This will be my go to recipe if I want to serve a white chili variation.

Really good, will make again, only changes I made was 1 can of chicken broth instead of two and I didn't put in any jalapeño's  in and it was the perfect amount of spice for my husband and I. Then when serving we topped it off with a spoon full of sour cream and chopped cilantro.

Awesome.  Followed suggestions by SeleneJC, but didn't sprinkle cheese on top - just omitted cheese altogether, and didn't blend any beans.  Did a little less cayenne, too.  My daughter, who can't handle spiciness, asked for seconds!

Loved it. My husband is a huge chili fan but had not tried chicken chili. He loved it!  I have a friend that is having surgery so I'm bring a big pot of this over to her family for dinner with some corn bread.

Hubby and I enjoyed this. I reduced the jalepenos, and pureed one can of beans. I also used white beans that were seasoned for chili. I don't normally add salt to food, but did need to sprinkle a tiny bit to make the other flavors pop. I'm going to add some brown rice and quinoa (Seeds of Change brand.) I wish I'd made cornbread.

I expected this to have a lot more kick than my batch did. I simmered this 3 times longer than called for and my cayenne pepper was rather old. Update: I made this a second time using chicken thighs, a can of hot peppers instead of the mild and fresh cayenne pepper. This batch was very spicy almost too hot for my wife but just right for me. This one is a keeper.

Awesome recipe!  I usually have to double the spice for recipes, but not this time!  Quick and easy way to use my leftover chicken.  A very different flavor from other suggestions for cooked chicken.  Hubby LOVED it! Thank you Cha Cha!

I didn't have cooked chicken, so I browned a pack of chicken thighs first, then added some oil to the pan and cooked the onions in that. After the onions were cooked down, I added 2diced green peppers and the jalapeños and cooked them down a bit. Finally, I deglazed the pan with a bit of white wine and let that cook off for a few minutes before adding the spices etc. It came out wonderfully!

I love this recipe. Easy enough for a man with no kitchen experience. My personal touch was adding a half a bunch of chopped cilantro. I'm not sure it made the dish better, but it did make it mine.

Yes n yes
I used a pound of ground chicken and only chopped it up a little bit, not crumbly not  too chunky then set it aside in a bowl.
I only had a red onion and used fresh garlic. Jalapeños fresh too, 1 large, diced no seeds.
I used 2 cans of cannelli beans and 1 of garbanzo beans, 1 can corn, all mostly drained but not rinsed. 1 can of chopped green chiles. I used a heaping teaspoon of oregano and used the cumin and red pepper and chicken broth  as directed. I used half cup Colby jack and half cup pepper jack cheese.
Best recipe ever. Got rid of the others!!! Tyty :)

I only added 1/4 tsp of cayenne because I knew it would be wayyyy too hot if I added more. I felt this was very blah in terms of depth of flavor. I added sour cream once in individual bowls and some cilantro but it was still boring. I felt like it needed red bell peppers or some other veggie to flavor it more.

As suggested in the recipe, I cut the jalapeños and used extra chilies instead (my daughter is not a fan of super spicy things). I thought the flavor was great, but the consistency was very runny- it was more like soup than chili. Not sure how to make it thicker?

Based on other reviews I was a bit wary of making this too spicy for my daughter, so I skipped the jalapenos and used two 4 oz cans of chopped chilis instead. I also used some chili powder, and the spiciness was just right- enough for the adults, not too much for the kid. I used one can of chicken broth, two 19 oz cans of white beans, plus added a can of corn. Also, 5 (!!) cloves of garlic, which was (thankfully) fine. It was a little watery so I added about 1/2 cup of shredded mozzarella 15 mins before serving, it thickened up nicely.

From another recipe I made some avocado/sour cream topping (1 avocado, 1/3 cup sour cream, 2 teaspoons lemon juice, dash of salt), it was perfect on top of the chili.

Great recipe, will definitely make again - thanks!

I have to preface, that I DID make slight changes, because I prepared this in a crock-pot.  I hate it when reviews are changed, but this was just too good not to review.  I made pretty much exactly as is, except I had the chicken already cooked and shredded, I used fresh jalapeno from garden, and I only used half of cayenne pepper.  I placed all items in crock pot for the entire day.  I did not add the cheese, as the recipe called for, but I wanted a thicker chili, so about an hour before serving, I made a mixture (from an old chicken stew recipe I have) to thicken - mix 1/4 milk and three tablespoons of flour - blend well and add 3 tablespoons of sour cream.  Add to crock pot and cook on high until ready to serve.  This was delicious and I will be making again - thanks for the recipe!!

This was a great and easy recipe but I had to make changes as I thought I had all the stuff and had to improvise. I live in Singapore and could not find a can of green chilies  so I used Ro-Tel instead. I also did not have cayenne pepper, which I thought I had at the house so I used Cajun seasoning instead as I had already started to cook this. I also substituted one can of white beans for chic peas and it added great texture. All in all I feel the original recipe would be great if I could get all of the stuff here.

Great and healthy, hearty meal.
I made a couple of changes due to reviews: I blended a can of beans for thickness and I added a can of corn for sweetness-great ideas!
I also reduced the spice by cutting the cayanne and replacing the can of jalapeño with a fresh seeded jalapeño. This resulted in a warm dish, but I would prefer it to be hotter, so next time I will use the can of jalapeño. 
I also replaced the chicken with mini turkey meatballs :) 
This is definitely a keeper for my family!

I made this just the way it said and Yum! The whole family loves it. Not sure why everyone thinks it's too spicy.... Loved it just the way it is and could also take more heat. Will for sure make it again!  Delicious!

This is a staple in our house in cooler weather!  But when you add just a pinch of cloves.....WOW! What a taste!! I leave out the jalapenos and use extra green chilies.  I may not be able to wait until cool weather....I'm ready for it now.

This is a great recipe, but I modified it by omitting the jalapeno peppers and replacing them with a jar of salsa verde.  The seasonings in the salsa verde give this chili added flavor.  I kept everything else as written in this recipe, except that I also have started using rotisserie chicken instead of 3 chicken breasts - just to make it quicker from start to finish.

My son made this for a Boy Scouts chili cook off. 
He used 2.5 lbs ground turkey and browned it in the oil with the onion and garlic like you would for regular chili.  2 tbls cumin, garlic or jalapeno salt, 2 cans of white beans, 2 cans white corn (with the liquid).  Two cans green chilies but substituted a jar of salsa verde for the jalapenos.  Also offered cubed avocado, sour cream, tortilla chips along with Jack Cheese as toppings.  
Won 1st in the non traditional chili category.

This is the best white chicken chili recipe that I've made!  I mash a can of white beans to give it a little more body and cut back on the cayenne a little.

This was quick and easy. My family loved it! I added a can of corn and two cans of green chilies. I only did a big spoonful of jalapeños. Wasn't that spicy. My sons and husband ate it.   If you like spicy then you may want to add all jalapeños.  Will definitely make again.

This is a great recipe! Easy to make, tastes great. I recommend having all the ingredients ready to throw in the pot before you start. I have made this recipe several times. I sometimes add corn. Goes great with cornbread on the side.  Highly recommended!

Cha Cha's White Chicken Chili Haiku: "Just ate cheese on top, rather than stir it all in. Better second day." Other than reducing to 2 servings (which actually was still more than enough to feed 2 adults, 1 child, w/ enough for a small leftover bowl the next day which incidentally, tasted even better), my only change was fresh jalapenos from my garden and the aforementioned use of individually choosing how much cheese to sprinkle on his or her bowl. Very very good, a definite repeat Cha-Cha!

I had to use many of the reviewers' suggestions to make this a recipe I would use.  I decreased the spice considerably (by 3/4 for the hot spices), puréed a third of the whit beans to make it more like chili and less like soup, and add vegetables (I added corn, baby spinach and carrots).  This was good, and I will continue fine tuning it, especially with the spice blend.  Next time I will replace oregano with marjoram.

This recipe is HOT!!! I used the jalapenos only, thinking the chili's and cayenne would be too much.  We like our food spicy, but I had to use potatoes to draw some of the spiciness out. Outside of the heat, the chili is on the bland side.  We had rice on the side or chili over rice, and cornbread. Sour cream also helped cool down the peppers.  Be very aware of the spice.  Maybe use the green chili or cayenne and add jalapeno if necessary.  I wont be making this again.

I grilled two chicken breasts and substituted pinto beans.  I have never made chili without tomato base so was unsure how this would work out.  Also, i used two 4 oz chili cans instead of jalapenos and cut cayenne in half to tone down the heat.  This has great flavor and is easy to make -  will definitely make this again, thanks!

Per other reviews: Cut back on peppers and cayenne pepper as it is very spicy as is.  Put everything into a crock pot (including the uncooked chicken) and let it all cook together. #2. I puree the white beans before putting them into the mix. This makes it much thicker and chili-like. #3. Once the chicken is cooked I shred as opposed to chopping it. I also don't use that much chicken broth - maybe a cup or a cup and a half.

This was really good. I gave the four stars because I omitted the cayenne, jalapeno and chile peppers. I added cinnamon and chili powder instead. I used a can of cannelloni beans and a can of chili beans. I took some chicken thighs and simmered them for an hour. Shredded them, put them aside. I browned some sausage, drained it and used a tablespoon or so of the grease to saute the onions, garlic and green bell pepper with the seasonings. I dumped the mixture of chicken, sausage, veggies and beans into a big pot with a can of cream of chicken soup mixed in. I used the reserved chicken broth and eyeballed it, adding a small amount here and there; enough so that I was happy with the consistency. A thick, delicious meal served over rice.

Great tasting, whether you make it straight off the recipe or have to adjust due to grocery miscalculations:).  I apparently didn't have the green chilis as I had thought, but rotel and the addition of a can of corn were wonderful...also put 16oz. Sour cream right into the mix at the end, love it!

Loved it! I used a rotisserie chicken to speed things along. Based on the other reviews I cut down on the amount of jalapenos, green chilies and cayenne pepper by half and pureed one of the cans of white beans to thicken it up a bit. The only thing I would do different next time would be to cut the jalapenos and green chilies into smaller pieces. It was even better with a little sour cream and cheese on top ;)

This is delicious.  Although, as many others have mentioned, VERY spicy.  I cut back a little on the spicy stuff and it's still a little too spicy for me.  I chopped up 4 small jalapenos in place of the can of jalapenos, and I cut back a little on the cayenne.  I think next time I might leave the cayenne out entirely or maybe use just a sprinkle.  I think the jalapenos OR the cayenne would be good, but not both!  However, other than that I am very happy!  I served it over fritos, because that's how I first had white chili and it is soooo good that way!

This chili is FANTASTIC!  I made it last nite and my husband is STILL talking about it today!  I modified slightly:  I only used 2 cans of beans, I did not put in the can of jalapeno's but instead, used 2 cans of Fire Roasted Mild Chile Peppers.  I also only sprinkled some cayenne pepper in, I definitely DID NOT use a tsp.

It is simply fantastic!

Everyone liked it. I did substitute a cream of chicken for a can of broth and I cut out the jalapenos since my kids don't care for spicy foods. It was delicious!

I went by several reviews and cut the jalapenos in half and upped the amount of green chiles.  I think next time I will stick with the recipe on this because my family really likes hot food.  The suggestion on using half cream of mushroom soup and half chicken broth was a great idea as was the ones on pureeing some of the white beans.  Thickened it up nicely.  I will definitely make this again.

This recipe is good, but I feel like it's missing some depth of flavor. I made it in the crock pot with 3 chicken breasts so the would shred. I accidentally added double the cumin, but I like cumin so it's still good. I also added some veggies- corn and okra. I will play around with it and make it again. Thanks for sharing!

This has amazing flavor. It doesn't look all that pretty and it smells a little bland, but the tast is warm and comforting. Perfect  for a cold ugly day outside!

Love this recipe and have made it twice in the last month. I add a bag of frozen sweet corn and two heaping spoonfuls of sour cream at the last minute. I serve the cheese and jalapenos on the side with sides of sour cream and chopped onion so people can fix it the way they like it. Everyone loves it!

Very good! I started with raw chicken breasts and pan cooked them first, but usually use canned chicken for recipes like this. I didn't use jalepenos since I didn't have any on hand, and the spice was just right. Cooked on the stove for about 20 minutes then transferred to a slow cooker to hold until dinner. I finished it with sharp cheddar cheese and a dollop of sour cream and we ate with crackers.

This chili rocks! I cut back on the jalapeno peppers and cayenne. I find it too spicy for most people (not me though!) if that is not done. The recipe freezes well so I always make a big batch. I poach boneless, skinless chicken breasts and shred them with 2 forks. It is a great meal on a cold rainy day.

I love this dish. I like that it's a chili with a chicken broth base, rather than a tomato base. I was so nervous because of all the reviews saying it was too spicy, so I cut back on the spices the first time around and was disappointed because it was too bland. Just made it again according to the recipe and it was much better -- I don't find it all that spicy.

Very good recipe. I always read both positive and negative reviews before making a new recipe. I see that there are people who say they found this "bland" and then I see people who find this "too spicy". The way you clean your jalapeños would make the difference. The more seeds you remove and discard, the milder the flavor. I really liked the flavor of this soup and will make it again. My only confusion was that the recipe said 3 cups of chicken and 3 cans of white beans yielded FOUR servings. I used 1can of white beans and 1 1/4# of ground chicken. I added a can of retried beans to make a thicker soup.

Very good!! Better the next day! I followed the recipe except I didn't add jalapeno and reduced cumin to 1 tsp. I didn't have cayenne pepper so I used  wet crushed red pepper. I cooked it for 1 hour. It makes a lot so I shared with a neighbor and she loved it too!!!

Yes, it was far too hot!.I only put in half the jalapenos and a forth of the cayenne and still I had to calm it down. I added a Tablespoon of sugar,a whole, large,chopped,raw potato and instead of the cheese I stirred in quarter of a cup of sour cream. I must say the results were great. Still extremely hot but very creamy & flavorful. Next time I'll try the recipe as it stands with no cayenne and the 2 cans of chiles. But there will definitely be a next time and soon!

Loved this tasty chili! Just a couple slight changes to make a little less spicy. Omitted can of jalapeños and added a second can of green chilies. Also used only a pinch of cayenne pepper rather than a teaspoon. Perfect!

We loved it. I got the mild nacho style jalapenos and mashed 1 can of the beans and added some frozen corn, after reading the reviews. I didn't change the other ingredients except that I used about 4 oz. of cream cheese stirred in at the end since it was the only cheese I had at the time.  Hubby brought home some cheddar later and we used it on top.  Due to picky kids who don't like onions, I sauteed the onions then used my immersion blender on them with some of the broth and they never knew they were in there. I use this trick a lot, and sometimes I add the garlic to the onion mix to blend because my husband doesn't like garlic or onions.  What they don't know won't hurt them I guess!

Yummy!! I followed some of the other reviewers and pureed the third can of beans in my mini-chopper before adding.  My kids don't like super spicy stuff, so I left out the jalapenos and cut down the cumin and cayenne pepper.  I also sprinkled extra cheese on top of each bowl when I served it.   I only had a red onion so I used that instead. It was fantastic.

Wonderful! The spicier the better! Also--- flavor is much richer and better with a shredded seasoned rotisserie chicken without the skin (and a GREAT saver of time).

I loved this recipe and so did my family.  My husband does not like spicy foods, so I made the alterations suggested by others - only mild chilies, half the cumin, and I used chipolte pepper instead of cayenne.  It was so flavorful!

Awesome Chili!!!  I didn't put the jalapeno's in it because I'm a wimp.  When I first took a taste, it was a little spicy for me so I added some more broth and it was perfect for my taste.  If you can tolerate spice then this is your recipe as is.

Absolutely delicious and so easy to make!  I changed the recipe slightly by using one fresh jalapeño, only one can of broth (to avoid the soup consistency) and simmered for about 45 minutes.  As others have mentioned, it was even better the next day!  This was a nice change and is definitely going into our dinner rotation.  Thanks for sharing!

I have made this recipe several times now for my husband and myself, as well as friends and family. Everyone loves it and it has become one of my go-to recipes. I do leave out the jalapeno however, and it is still hot enough. Love it!!

Great recipe! However, based on commments, I omitted the jalepeno peppers.  Good thing too....cuz if those babies had been in there there is NO way we could have eaten this. It would have been WAY to spicy. YUMMO! Thank you for sharing!

This is a wonderful winter dish.  I added about a third more cumin, oregano and cayenne because I like spicier chili, and every last drop was eaten by my family.

Made this last night and it turned out delicious. Was surprised at how easy it was to make. I did simmer it for longer than 15 minutes ... more like an hour. Also added corn and cilantro. This is definitely a "do over and over again" -- yum, yum, yum.

This was wonderful however it was slightly too spicy for my taste.  The only change I made was to use fresh jalapenos instead of canned so this may be why it was so spicy.  Next time I would probably eliminate the cayenne pepper and discard the jalapeno seeds.

Wonderful change from ordinary chili!  Exceptional flavor; I will definitely be making this again (and again!) Some in my family do not like spice at all, so I skipped the jalapenos and cayenne, adding the pepper and cheese at serving time. Those  who wanted some kick used pepper jack cheese as well. Also served with lime wedges. The lime juice added a nice zing.

I loved the recipe but made some modifications based on a coworker making it first. It was a little on the liquidy side and really spicy even with slightly reducing the amount of cayenne. But when I made it I reduced the cayenne in half and then I only put half of the jalepenos in. I don't eat onions so I left that out. Instead of cubing the chicken I boiled it (no oil necessary) and then shredded it and it thickened it up better. In one ob of my bowls I also added cooked brown rice which was really good too and I served it with a side of french bread. You could do one more can of beans if you don't want to add rice or you could substitue the beans for rice or noodles to make a soup. It was tasty. Still on the spicy side but when I added the rice it did help. Going to make it again this weekend.

I made this with a group and we could not keep from eating it! It smells so good while prepping, and even better once it simmers.
I've made this a couple times for myself and share it with neighbors.

This was so delicious but a bit too spicy for our taste. Still, great flavor and it went so well with a side of sourdough rolls. Thanks for a terrific recipe!

it was edible but I have no desire to make this again. apparently we don't like white beans very much. even after reading reviews and cutting back on the liquid it was still very runny. I thought it was bland since I left out they cayenne for the kids, but that seems like it shouldn't have changed the flavor that much.

EXCELLENT!  But this is more of a soup than chili!  Prepared exactly as stated, but used fresh jalapenos-fresh is best!  I like a thicker "soup", so before adding chicken, I used an immersion blender in the pot, pureed one can of beans, and then added the 2 additional cans "as is".  
This IS a spicy "soup", so if you can't take the heat, reduce cayenne pepper by 1/2.  
Thanks for sharing your wonderful recipe!

Served at a family New Years Day gathering as an alternative to traditional red chili.  Everyone who tried it raved about it.  Doubled the recipe with these modifications:  used 1 can of jalapeno and 2 cans of green chilis (heat was just right) and 4 cans of white beans vs. 6.  Pureed one of the 4 cans of beans to thicken up the consistency.  Finally, we added some cilantro. Other than that, every other ingredient was doubled.  Prepared the day before in the crockpot and let cook for 5 hours, then reheated on the day of the party. Served with shredded cheese, sour cream, chopped scallions and cilantro.

This recipe is wonderful!  I can't tolerate too much heat, so to tone it down I only use 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper and a fresh diced jalapeño with seeds and ribs removed.  The first time I made it it was incredibly hot, but I successfully turned down the heat with HONEY, yes that's right, honey-it doesn't affect the flavor at all.  A tbsp of honey cuts the heat in half and it was super delicious, though still a little hot.  I also boil my chicken (I used 2 fresh chicken quarters with skin on) to make my own stock-with a little salt.  Then just remove the skin and shred it by hand after its done!  Delish!

DELICIOUS!  Everytime I make it, I'm asked for the recipe.  If you like really spicy chili, try adding shredded pepper jack cheese instead of the monterey jack.  Sometimes I leave out the jalapenos if I'm going to have kids eating, then people can add whichever cheese they need.

Fabulous!  This is the BEST "white chili" recipe that I know of.  It can be pretty spicy so add your jalapenos at the end of you wish, and cut down the Cayenne, if you so please.  We like it hot!  It clears the sinuses and cures what ails ya. Never-ever-ever cut down on the cumin.  It's what gives it the smokey chili flavor.  Thanks for the recipe!  I have been following this one for years!

With this recipe as the basis, I have made it in a variety of ways, including the way it is written. (I always do this the first time I make something)  If I have the time, I use dried beans. I have used rotisserie chicken, poached chicken, and canned. The heat depends on who will be eating it. I like food very spicy so throw some McCormack firey pepper on top. I use the cheese as a topping along with greek yogurt and salsa. Yummy

I was skeptical about this recipe being bland but I was in for a surprise, it was super delicious!! I added 1 shallot to the onion to give it more flavor and omitted the oregano. I topped mine with fat free sour cream and fat free cheese and chopped cilantro and it was OUT OF THIS WORLD! This recipe is a keeper. Healthy, hearty and high fiber--its a winner!

I cooked the chicken breasts in the slow cooker while I was at work so they'd be ready to use when I got home - so my chicken was shredded rather than chopped. I also eliminated the jalapenos and tried to mash up the beans with my spoon just a bit while I stirred (after reading all the reviews about it being too thin). It turned out perfect! Rave reviews from company.

Good just as presented with only modest changes for taste.  Adjusted the spiciness with only one can of fire-roasted (mild) diced green chiles; didn't use the jalapenos at all.  Great way to finish off the last of the Thanksgiving turkey.  Rather than stir in the cheese, we just sprinkled it on top.

I woke up this morning with plans to make white chicken chili.  After looking at the reviews, I decided on this one.... and I'm glad I did.  It turned out so good, I had a bowl for breakfast.  I made it close to the recipe, but used only 2oz jalapenos, and elimated the garlic.  I love garlic, but no one loves me when I eat it!!  I pureed the jalapenos with the green chilis and pureed one can of the beans.  I used 2 cans of navy beans and one great northern.  I didn't add any cheese and it is delicious, and healthier.  Maybe the next time I make it I will rinse the beans to lessen the sodium.  It's excellent as is, but I don't need the salt.  Going for a 2nd bowl.... and it's not even 9am!

This was very good.  I made as directed except I added a little chili powder and left out the cayenne since it was hot enough for me without it.  I also used a fourth can of white beans, which I pureed to thicken the soup. I also added some instant potato flakes to further thicken it to make it more of a chili-like consistency.  Thanks. I will definitely make this again.

We loved it, but did make a few changes.  I omitted the jalapeños.  I sautéed the chicken with the onion and let everything simmer for about an hour. I took another reviewers advice and puréed one of the cans of beans to thicken it up.  Also, I drained the beans before adding them and there is plenty of liquid.  I threw in some green and yellow squash, too.  Very tasty and easy!  I will make this again!

This was delicious.  Twenty minutes before this is done, I added a cup of white rice to the pot and cooked for 20 minutes.  This added the thickness I needed in the chili.

Made exactly as outlined above except omitted the jalapeños.  I also didn't have any cayenne pepper so I substituted chili powder instead.  Delicious!

Made as is, you need to kick up the proportions on the spices, or it can come out a little bland.

I've been making this chili since I came across the recipe several yrs ago. I don't usually measure, just eyeball it. It's one of my favorite recipes. I add more spices in, depending on my mood. Everyone who's tried it loves it. I add the cheese on each bowl instead of stiring it in, plus add cut up green onion, sometimes bacon and always have sour cream...served with old-fashioned cornbread.

Very good.  Pretty spicy, but not overwhelming.  I use 1 less can of beans, and there's still PLENTY of beans in there.  I also add a can of corn with peppers and black beans, both for flavor and color.  I don't add the cheese when cooking, just throw some on top with some sour cream and tortilla chips.  I make up a batch on the weekend and have lunch set for the week.

I made this today for a football party. I doubled the recipe (for a large crowd). I did make a few changes: I used 2 rotisserie chickens. I used the skin and bones from the chicken to make my own broth.  Added bay leaf, celery and onion to the broth and brought to a boil.  When I thought it was ready, I set it aside until i was ready for it.  I pureed 2 cans of great white northern beans with a whole jalapeno, seeds and all.  I then strained the broth and mixed it in my slow cooker with the bean puree, added the chicken, 3 cans white kidney beans (drained), and the onion garlic and spice mixture.  The color is beautiful and smells incredible!  And, if I must say so myself, it tastes pretty good!!!

This is a great base. I made a few changes. I like thicker chili so I added a can of retried beans. It thickens it up without changing the flavor. On a whim I added a can of cheese soup. Wow! That added the right creaminess and yummy taste. I didn't add any additional cheese, but instead sprinkled a little on top. Husband had three helpings, kids and myself had two. This is a keeper.

Great recipe! I took the advice of others here and there. I used three different white beans and a can of corn - I drained every can. I subbed one can of broth for a cream of chicken soup. I skipped the cayenne and used that amount of chili powder instead, which I think helped cut down on the spiciness that a lot of people complained of. Lastly, I mixed in a cup of sour cream when I put in the cheese. Then I topped with extra sour cream and cheddar. It was phenomenal!!

We LOVE this it!!!! Best EVER. Used fresh chilli peppers but cut the amount in half. Used the blender to chop onions, garlic and peppers. Pureed a third of the beans. fresh Oregano. Poured some heavy cream in it and added some cinnamon to tie the flavors together. Cooked on low heat for a couple of hours.

Made my own chicken broth using two large bone-in chicken breasts, whole carrot, whole onion, 3 celery stalks, a handfull of fresh parsley, salt, pepper, and enough water to cover.  Simmered on stove top for 1 to 1.5 hours. Strained liquid, reserving enough broth for the chili.  Chopped chicken and reserved for recipe.  Omitted canned jalapenos, but sauteed a whole fresh jalapeno, seeded, with the garlic and onions.  Finished the soup as directed, using half the amount of red pepper. Served with chopped cilantro, scallions, and Mexican sour cream sides.  Also served the cheese on the side...didn't stir it in.  Delish!

I've tried many different white chicken chili recipes - -and this is, by far, the easiest and the tastiest! It is hot and spicy and I add more jalepenos than called for - -so be careful if you're not a fan of hotness. Love it!!

This is a super easy and very tasty recipe.  I used poached shredded chicken and made the recipe as stated, with the exception of sprinkling the cheese on top upon serving rather than mixing it in.  As other users have recommended, I might try pureering one can of beans to thicken the chili a bit next time. Overall, the chili was flavorful and you can't beat how easy it was to put together.  We served it with sour cream and tortillas.

I think it was excellent as is!   There are several twists that  could be done like adding corn instead of that 3rd can of beans.  3 cans makes is a bean overdose.  I personally like it with a cup of heavy cream.

Left out the jalapeno and cayenne because the kids don't like spicy. In it's place I added 1 tsp. fennel seed, 1 tsp. chili powder, and 1/4 tsp red pepper flakes. I used two cans of beans and about 2 cups of frozen corn.

I'm not a big fan or really spicy so I didn't use jalapenos and added an extra can of mild chilies. Also used only 1/2 tsp of red pepper. I thickened the chili by adding a can of cream of chicken soup and a can of corn. Wonderful on a chilly fall night!

This chili is fantastic and spicy! I usually just buy a whole rotisserie chicken from Ralph's and then just shred the meat and toss it in. It is super quick and easy to make and has gotten rave reviews from all who tried it. I highly recommend serving it with "Grandmother's buttermilk cornbread" from this site which is very sweet and buttery which is a nice counterpart to the spiciness

Very good! I used all chiles instead of jalapenos as I didn't want to make it too spicy for my guests. Topped with the cheese rather than mixing it in, and also served with fresh cilantro, tortilla chips, and sour cream.

I took out the jalepenos and substituted cayenne pepper for chili powder since we are a little heat shy. Tasted very yummy. I would do this one again.

Great recipe!  I put all ingredients with 1 lb. of sknls/bnls chicken  (uncooked) in the slow cooker on low for 5 hours; took chicken out shredded and put back in for an hour but less time would be fine. I also blended one can of beans to make it thicker and added black beans as others did!  Turned out great.  My picky nephew even ate it! Thanks!

Really good!  I used chicken leg quarters, which I cooked in the slow cooker with about 1/2 cup of water.  Then used the juice in the slow cooker as my chicken broth.  I also used extra green chilis instead of jalepenos because I was making this for my whole family, includng children.  All of us, even the kids, ages 2, 5 & 7, ate this & liked it.  I also cut back on the spices, using less cumin & cayenne.  We added the cheese to our individual bowls, along with sour cream & crushed tortilla chips.

Average meal.  I would have thought with so many spices it would have knocked my socks off.  I followed it to a t with the exception of cutting the cayenne in half.  too bad for me it was just ok

Great stuff!! Highly recommend!! Tip:  season & grill your chicken for enhanced flavor. We omitted the cayenne pepper because of little kids.. and put mild green chiles (no jalapenos) and the rest of the spices and it was perfect! Thanks!

This was a fast, tasty white chicken chili - although by the recipe, its way too SPICY, even for those who love spice, like me. 
My suggestions are:

-Cut back cayenne by 1/2
-Add a little sour cream
-Add a little fresh/frozen corn.

Its very good for such a quick chili.

Great chili.  I added 1 can of beans and half the chicken and then used an immersion blender to make the chili have more of a creamy texture.  Then added the rest of the chicken and beans.  My kids love this!

This chili was right on!  I made as stated except for the can of chopped jalapeno.. couldn't find at the store, so used two cans of the chopped green ones.  Also tossed in some cilantro at the end just because I like it.  Thank you Cathy for this recipe.

I had to make adjustment on the ingredients according to what was in the pantry. I used fresh green chile peppers (seeded). Didn't have oregano so used Italian seasoning mix. No jalapeno. Had boiled ground chicken. All in all it was very good. Thank you for the recipe.

Exceptional chili! I followed the recipe to the "T" and still found it a wee bit too spicy for my asbestos mouth. I added two heaping tablespoons of sour cream with the cheese and it was exactly what it needed to bring it down to the perfect level of spicy I was looking for.

I made this in the crock pot.  Excellent flavor, but a bit runny.  I even blended up one of the cans of beans, but i still had to add a little corn starch.

I wasn't sold on this recipe the night I made it, but the next day it was fantastic! Giving the spices time to mingle really makes this chili a lot more flavorful.

This is an incredible recipe!  I made as is and then I changed it to my family's taste!  Both came out delicious.  My changes were to add a can of diced tomatoes and omit the jalapeños.  I also only put in 1 can of beans and added cooked rice into it at the end.  So Good!!

Yum, yum, yum! I love this stuff. It's just right for me, but a little too spicy for my kids, so I omit the can of jalapeno peppers, and just add the 1 can of green chile peppers- which gives it enough heat to still be good, but not too much for my kids.
I also use 2 cans of white beans and 1 can of black beans... 'cause I like 'em. :-)

We really liked this except the spice ...too much heat.  I am leaving out the cayenne next time.  The jalapeno's are enough for some kick.  I used "small" white beans not white kidney beans.  Since the recipe just says "white" beans.   I also only shredded cheese over the soup when serving versus adding to the whole pot.  Alittle sour cream doesn't hurt either  ;-)

Just made this again for the second time. It was just two of us, so I scaled it back. I used one chicken breast, no jalapeños, one can of chilies, half an onion, garlic, 1 tsp of cumin, 1/2 tsp of oregano, 1/4 tsp of cayenne, 1/4 tsp of salt, one can of white beans (drained) and a 14 oz can of reduced sodium chicken broth. Added cheese and sliced avocado on top. Delicious!

Wow! This chili a hit! I also made a few changes per the reviews. I only added 1/4 of the jalapenos and omitted the cayenne. It still had a good kick. Would probably use all the jalapenos if my family wasn’t so spicey sensitive... I also added a can of corn for another layer of texture. I brought left over’s to work and my "chef" coworker loved it! Just one more successful recipe from allrecipes.com!

Wow this recipe is fantastic. Only difference I made was that I used drained canned chicken, and cooked it for an extra 20 minutes, stirring frequently. I think the extra time gave it more of a chance to reduce liquid and thicken. While this was fairly spicy as written, I think I'll be adding more spice next time. Served with bread, this made a fantastic meal.

wow..this was so good!  I did modify the recipie slightly.  We used only 1/4 teaspoon of caynne pepper- more can always be added on top.  Also, we wanted the taste of the jalepanos but not the heat, so we took whole jalepanos, seeded them, and then diced them.  In the end, I wasn't too happy with how soupy the texture was, so I added about 1/4 cup flour/water mixture to thicken.  It was the perfect amount!  so happy with how much leftover i have!  I will definitely make this again..it is SO good!

We omitted the jalapeno peppers and cut the cayenne pepper down to 1/4 tsp.  I also mashed a can of white beans to help thicken (did the trick).  You can alter this recipe for any taste.

I really can't say enough about how good this chili is!  I followed the recipe except that I took one reviewer's advice and mashed one can of the beans to thicken the chili up a bit.  It was a tiny bit too spicy for me, and so I will cut back on the cayenne next time, but my husband thinks it's perfect!  Thanks for sharing this recipe with us.

This was spicy and delicious.  I drained/rinsed 2 of the cans of beans and mashed one.  I also only used half of the jalapenos.  A definite hit in our house!

I have made this many times and each time it turns out great.  This is in my "keepers" file.  It IS hot, so adjust to your taste.  We love it as much the next day too!  GREAT recipe!

I've been making this for a few years now and it's really easy. It's a nice change from red chili. I use fresh jalapeno and chile peppers instead of the canned varieties, and it's delicious!

I made this for my husband and he loved it!!  I omitted the cayenne pepper and jalepeno peppers, used Rotel with mild green chiles instead.  I have not tried it because of the diet I follow, but it smelled wonderfu!

Wow!  Great Chili!  Caution very spicy!!  I used on TBSP of the jalapenos, 2 cans of the mild green chilies, 2 cans of beans, 2 med onions, and mounded the cheese on each serving individually.  This is a keeper!  Oh yeah, I completely omitted the cayenne, for me (and I like spice) it would have been way to hot with the additional cayenne.

I made this recipe as it was written. I found it to be very good but HOT AS heck! It's on the spicy side and I would leave out some of the jalapeno's but if you like it hot, this is it! I served w/ cornbread. I will make this again, but I will cut down the spices.

Very nice flavor and tasty.    I had wanted to try out the “White Chili” for some time and this was a simple and easy recipe.   The only thing that I would do different is cut down the amount of red pepper.  Not because I don’t like the heat, but that the red pepper detracted from the awesome taste of the chili in my opinion.  I think ½ tsp. of cayenne will be just perfect.    Will definitely make this again!  Thanks for the recipe!

New fave!!! I make it, freeze portions, and its perfect for a quick lunch with a salad.  I blend 2 of the cans of beans... makes it creamier, and richer... if you want it more broth-y, leave them as beans. Thx for great recipe!!! Perfect for winter and fall!!!

I followed the recipe exactly and my mouth was burning for hours after.  I had to drop a tablespoon of sour cream into my bowl to mellow it out.  I would make this again and probably cut the jalapenos in half.  YUMMY!

This is a really good recipe....after I tweaked it. The recipe as is, is rip your lips off SPICY! Not for the weak or the faint of heart. I can usually withstand some pretty spicy food, this will rub your taste buds raw.  I cut the cayenne back to 1/2 a tsp, and only used about 1-2 tsp. of the canned chopped jalapenos. Even with the cut backs, it still has a pretty solid kick. The chicken I used was left over from a rotisserie chicken from the previous night, a great way to use up left overs. Also added about 1/4 half n half for extra creaminess.

Delicious!  All the kids LOVED IT!  Not a fan for spicy foods, so I left out the Cayenne and the tomatillos.  did a few already diced jalepenos, and that was good for me.  It was SO good.  Awesome recipe, totally a keeper!

One of the best chili's I've ever had (sorry mom). Using the chicken broth instead of tomato sauce gave it a much lighter consistency. With all the spices and peppers added made the end results very spicy, just the way I enjoy it. Warning: If you're not one for the really spicy foods, I would recommend cutting back on some of the Jalapeños and spices. Another tip would be just before adding the cheese at the end use a hand mixer to chop up some of the chicken and really mix those ingredients together. and like any stew or chili it only gets better the longer you let it sit. So don't worry about rushing it.

Really good. I made it without jalapenos since my family doesn't like spicy foods. Add extra green chiles as substitute.

Love the recipe. To give it a veggie boost I also add a huge bunch of fresh, chopped collard greens . Cook the collards in the broth first and then follow the recipe - might need a little more broth. Sounds wierd/tastes great...and good for you!!

Great recipe, give it a try. I have made this several times, making two small changes.  I only use the chopped green chile peppers. For the stock I simmer three bone-in chicken breasts covered with water and add a little chicken bouillion.  I strain the broth, then debone and dice the chicken.  Works every time.

UPDATE: MADE THIS AGAIN TODAY, BUT THIS TIME I PUREED AN ENTIRE CAN OF BEANS TO GIVE THIS A CHILI-LIKE CONSISTENCY (AS IS, THIS IS QUITE SOUPY). I ALSO ADDED JALAPENOS AND THE FULL AMOUNT OF CAYENNE CALLED FOR (SPOT ON!) AND COOLED MY CHILI A BIT BEFORE ADDING THE CHEESE (PERFECT!). Meh. This was just "OK." My fiance is out of town on business, so I decided to invite my folks over for dinner (and sneak in a house project for my dad to help me with lol!). Dierdre Dee's white chili I recipe is my stand-by, but I have always wanted to give Cha Cha's recipe a try to see if it's any better than hers. I must say, I am going to remain loyal to Dierdre. While I enjoyed this, I didn't as much as  Diedre's (sorry!). To be fair, I must admit I changed things up a bit. I did not use jalapenos (I used all green chiles) and decreased the cayenne to 1/2 t (to accommodate my mom's sensitive palate). I also added a 15.5 oz. can of white (shoepeg) corn simply because I wanted to use it up. My only regret was adding the cheese to my chili. Not only did my cheese NOT melt, it stuck to the bottom of my Dutch oven (and was a PAIN to clean!!!). I would have much rather reserved the cheese as garnish. Served bowlfuls garnished with crushed tortilla chips, green onion and sour cream. Bluegirl's golden sweet cornbread (another favorite of mine!), a tossed salad with avocado ranch salad dressing (Randesgirl) and caramel apple enchiladas (ReDonna) completed our meal. Thanks for sharing, Cathy! :-)

It was okay, not great.  I tried using leftover roasted chicken and I followed the recommendations to cut back on the heat.  But I was underwhelmed.  I liked it best when I added it to some lettuce, cheese, and salsa and made a taco salad.  That was delicious.  The chili on its own wasn't.

SOOOOOO yummy!  I did make a few changes to suit our tastes and healthy eating endeavor.  I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts and seasoned them with Mrs. Dash Southwest Chipotle seasoning prior to cooking in a nonstick skillet with no oil.  I also browned a pound of ground white turkey and seasoned that with the southwest chipotle seasoning.  The combination of chicken and turkey was delicious, and healthy.  I also only used 2 cans of cannelini beans as other reviewers suggested, and instead of green chiles I used a can of regular Rotel.  I also added a can of stewed tomatoes, a cup of corn, and chopped cilantro.  Finally, I omitted the cheese and put 1 Tbsp on each bowl for garnish instead.  This way, each 1 cup serving was only 138 calories with 2 grams of fat!!  My husband and I love spicy food and this was perfect for us, even with the additional Southwest Chipotle seasoning I used on the meat.  I suggest other people try using regular Rotel instead of green chiles, it'll help tone down spice while adding some flavor.  I can't wait to eat the leftovers!

Very tasty. For my tongue I didn't think too much of the spiciness of it but my 2 youngest kids both complained and didn't want to eat it. Threw some sour cream and cheese on theirs and then they thought it was okay.

This was a good recipe! I changed a couple of things. I cheated and bought a white chicken chili spice pack, but I still added the cayenne pepper. I sauteed the onion and green chilis, added the spice pack, and mixed in some chicken broth. I let that simmer a bit while I pureed one can of beans. I threw everything together in a crock pot, let it cook for about 5 hours, and topped it with cheese, sour cream, and tortilla chips. YUM!

Yummm!  Great flavor and spice!  I followed the recipe the first time i made it, but made a few changes my second go around.  As suggested by a previous reviewer I added a can of corn and added a 1/2 can of cream corn to add thickness.  I also put one can of white beans in the blender with the liquid to made it creamier without having to add cream.  I chose not to add oregano and used coriander instead of cummin and added a tsp of pepper.  I also added 1/4 cup fresh cilantro and garnished the chili with Monterey jack cheese and sliced avacado.  It was delicious!  Enjoy!

I have made this several time and I love it the way it is! You can always tame it down as I have to for other family members. Mix up the kind of beans for variety.

GREAT recipe!  I added a couple more cans of beans, yet pureed them so that it would thicken the sauce.  I also added a can of corn, and used a jalapeno and a 7 ounce can of chili's.  Spicy-ness is good with this amount of peppers.  Also, substituted the chicken broth for the water that I boiled the chicken in while cooking (probably about 32 ounces of water).  A little extra salt made this substitution a less-expensive recipe and tasty as well!  All-in-all a VERY good recipe without any modifications!    Oh, I left out the cheese and opted to allow it for use at the table if needed.  Also, sour cream is a great garnish in the bowl.  Wonderful.

This recipe is okay, but i felt like it needed some extra zing.  I don't like hot food so i omitted the jalapeno completely.  I cut the amount of oregano and cumin in half (i felt it was overpowering).  I only added about 1/4 tsp cayenne.  I added 1/2 T of chili powder.  I also pureed one can of beans to thicken it, and it was still pretty thin.  I didn't add the cheese into the chili, but wait until serving.  I would reccomend serving with a T of sour cream on top and with corn chips.  These changes made it closer to a 5 star.

This has good flavor, but it's HOT as-is.  I would give it 5 stars, but the first batch we ended up throwing out because we couldn't eat it.  The 2nd batch we omitted the jalapenos and added corn starch to thicken it up and it was MUCH better.  We also only added 2 cans of beans instead of 3 and added more chicken, as my husband likes his a little more "meaty".  Overall, great recipe with modifications.

This soup was really spicy, but was super tasty. I made the following alterations after reading others reviews and after tasting it during the cooking process:  - I only used 3/4 can of peppers - I added in 1 can of white corn - I added in 1 can of diced tomatoes to add some more vegetables and color - I added in a little more chicken broth than called for, as it was very spicy - I blended up half the beans with an immersion blender - I topped off the chili in my bowl with cheese and some Greek Yogurt.

This is delicious!!!! But when it says to use 4 oz. of jalapeno peppers, USE ONLY ONE PEPPER, OR BETTER YET, HALF A PEPPER. otherwise, your upper lip is going to start sweating. really, really good.

This was excellent, though I am hesitant to call it "chili."  It really had more of a soup consistency.  I cut back on the jalapeno peppers and pureed half of the beans (which helped to thicken it up).  I also topped it with a dollop of sour cream and some fresh cilantro.  My husband and I loved this!  I will make again, for sure.

I love this recipe! It is spicy and so tasty. The only thing I added was a can of creamed corn and some salt and pepper. I also used 2 cans of butter beans and 1 can of navy beans. Terrific! I will definitely make this again.

Super good and Super easy to make. I wanted it to be thick so after the onions cooked I added a tablespoon of flour and cooked that for a couple minutes then stirred in the chicken broth and added the other ingredients after that. I used some frozen shredded chicken with peppers and onions. I also added a teaspoon of jalapeno hot sauce in place of the jalapeno peppers. I warmed up a tortilla and placed it in the bowl, it was very good that way.

Great base recipe!  Since I don't like spicy, I did not add the jalapeno peppers nor the cayenne.  I did add 2 cans of canneloni (sp?) beans and did as others suggested - I pureed a can of navy beans and added to the mixture to thicken it up.  I could see that it was not as thick as I would have liked, so I added one tablespoon cornstarch and it was perfect.  Oh, I did had 1 tablespoon of chili powder.  Yum!

This was a very good 'soup'. I think if I had followed some of the suggestions it would have been a great chili. I'll make it again following the suggestions. Very good flavor.

Excellant recipe.  I skipped the canned Jalapeno and chopped 1/2 of a fresh one.  I too puree'd one can of beans to thicken.  Might add a 4th can next time.

I thought this was ok but too soupy for my family's taste. We prefer the Blonde Chicken Chili from this same site.  The pre-cooked chicken turned out kind of tough, too.  The seasoning was nice.

This was very good.  The spice combination is excellent.  Used only 2 ounces of jalapeno peppers which was plenty for us.  I also added a can of cream of chicken soup to thicken it up some.  Thanks  I'll make this again.

This recipe is a keeper for our family. Everyone loved it. I had some minor changes, but the integrity of the recipe remains. I used 1 1/2 lb of ground chicken thighs instead of the breasts, added some ground corriander as I had seen in other recipes as well as a just little celery and just a little green pepper. I also used just one can of green chili peppers because my son doesn't like things too spicy.

Very good.  I don't like spicy so I left out the jalapenos and chiles and added only a couple of pinches of cayenne and it was still pretty spicy.

We really like this chili. I added only 2 cans of white kidney beans, and less cayenne and it was just spicy enough! I crumbled Dorito's tortilla chips on top and sprinkled spicy Jack Cheese on top! Perfect for a cold & rainy night~

This was great!  I added a few things to suit my parents' tastes since I was cooking it for them. I added a can of corn and a can of rotelle tomatoes, and left out the jalepenos and green chiles. I used 1/8 tsp of cayenne. Taking out some of the spice but using the mild rotelle tomatoes made the perfect amount of spice for my mom who doesn't mind spicy, as long as it's not too spicy. I also used 1 can of broth and 2 cans of cream of chicken, because i liked the texture better that way. Instead of putting the cheese in the pot, I put a bowl of a Mexican mix of shredded cheese on the table. very yummy!

If I could give this recipe more than five stars I would. I think my husband would even give it 10 stars. I made this recipe exactly as instructed. The finished project is just magnificent. It is definitely a spicy dish, but light and packed with flavor. For the chicken, I used leftover rotisserie chicken from the market, cut up, and for the beans I used great northern beans. Thank you Cha Cha!

Based on other reviews I was prepared to alter the recipes as follows: cut out jalapeno peppers, double the green chile peppers, substitute 1 can of chicken broth with cream of chicken soup, and use 4 cans of beans w/ one can mashed. However, as I was making the chili I was worried about it becoming too soupy. I drained the cans of beans before adding them. After I added two cans, I thought it look like enough beans so that is all I used. I have five young children so I cut the cayenne pepper by 1/2.  The thickness came out perfect...not too soupy, and it wasn't too spicy either. Will definately make again. Thanks for a great recipe

GREAT recipe!  I doubled all spices and instead of red pepper, I added 1tsp cayenne pepper.  Garnished with sour cream and cheese, it was unbelievable!

LOVED this with a few modifications:  After reading reviews, I only used about 1/2 the jalapenos, and instead of the green chile peppers, I used Herndez salsa verde (about 1/2 cup) because I usually have it on hand.  I also only used 2 cans of beans (and fork-mashed about 1/2 of the first can).  SO SO SO good.

It was okay but I still have left overs nobody wanted to eat. I have another white chili recipe I prefer much more than this one. Thank you for the recipe.

Great!  Whole family loved it.  I reduced the jalapenos to about 1 T. (will use the rest for the super yummy popper dip that's on this site). I cut out the green chiles (because I don't like them that much), used 1 teaspoon cumin, and just dolloped some low fat sour cream on top and sprinkled with cheese.  A very low fat recipe if made that way.  Made this way I thought it was a perfect amount of spice and great with corn bread!  Thanks for the great recipe!

yummy!!! i changed a few things though - i used 1 can black beans, 1 can white beans and 1 can pureed white beans to thicken it up and used 2 1/2 cups broth. i also used 1 fresh chopped jalepeno instead of canned and didnt have any cumin on hand so i left it out. served with monterrey jack, sour cream and fresh tomatoes on top with cornbread. delicious!

Really good - but too hot (and I really like hot things).  I only put about 1/4 of a jalepeno pepper in diced and it was WAY HOT!!!  I think just doing green chilis would be the best route to go, but maybe 2 cans to give it more flavor.  I also thought it was more soup consistancy than chili consistancy, so I may cut back on the liquid next time too.  BUT THERE WILL BE A NEXT TIME!

This is the most delicious chili ever!  We like things hot so we add a 1/2 can (4oz) of diced jalepenos and 2 (4oz) cans of green chiles.  Delish!  Plus I put all of the ingredients into a slow cooker and cook on high for 4 hours.  Then, I take the chicken out and shred it with a fork, and return it to the crockpot for another 30-1 hr.  YUM!

Since all my cooking excursions come from AllRecipes.com I noted this recipes had many good reviews thus I tried it.  I only had two cans of cannellini beans thus the mixture came out slightly watery. I added 1 tablespoon of Quinoa which created a thicker texture while adding additional protein and whole grains. I also used a slow cooker for this recipe. The outcome was wonderful; a thick wholesome chili.  I do recommend this recipes too all that are curious to try it.

I didn't use the green chili peppers or jalapeno peppers either and the cayenne alone made it a bit too spicy. Should have read the other reviews! Other than that, it was DELICIOUS!!! I used fresh chicken breasts that I cooked and added as shredded chunks. I also mixed in the cheese I had and served that way.

Loved it & so did the family! I pretty much followed the recipe. Only thing different was I made my own chix stock & did not have jalapenos so I added a little x-tra cayenne. It worked!

This chili was so delicious.  I only had one can of white beans, so I used that and one can of pinto beans.  Then I pureed a can of light red kidney beans in order to thicken it up.  YummY!

Really good. More like a soup than a chili recipe. I tossed everything in a crock pot, including the chicken (4 frozen tenders) and cooked on high for 3 hours. Shredded the chicken, omitted the jalapeno's and used only half teaspoon of cayenne pepper since our kids (one and three) we're eating it too. Our boys loved it and our house smelled wonderful!

Really good! Definately cut down the peppers/cayenne. I'm a chicken so omitted the jalepanos all together and used 2 fresh chopped serrano peppers and 1/2 tsp. cayenne in a batch and a half (we wanted leftovers for work). The spiciness was good for my family, and for lunch today, it was just a TAD bit spicier than last night but still did not overpower the dish! Last night, those that wanted it spicier dashed a little more cayenne pepper in their bowl. I topped with Mexican four cheese blend shredded cheese, dollop of sour cream, and chopped green onions and served with crescent rolls. YUM!!!!!

I've tried many recipes from this site and I have to say this is my favorite and I get lots of compliments on it and requests for the recipe.  The changes I make are to use half the chicken broth (I use homemade), occasionally less jalapeno peppers and/or cayenne (depending on who's joining us and their tolerance for heat), and I add chopped celery.  This is pretty easy and quick and so very delicious!  I haven't made regular chili since discovering this recipe a few years ago.

I almost followed the recipe exactly - only changes are that I left out the green chiles (didn't have any) and used 3/4 lb. of monterey jack cheese. Next time, I might use only 1/2 lb, but I felt that 1 cup was not enough. I felt the spice level was great - the jalapenos certainly added a kick, but was not at all overpowering.  My whole adult family loved it and has already requested I make it again soon!!

I made a few changes - which made this the best white chili I've ever made. I used fresh jalapenos. I cooked my chicken breasts in the crockpot then shredded it with a fork. I also added fresh corn. My husband's work just raved about it!

Very good. I used white kidney beans and as advised by another person, I also pureed a can of the white beans to thicken the soup. I doubled recipe and used only one can of the jalapenos, it was still plenty spicy. Served with a nice wholegrain crusty bread. Perfect!

This recipe turned out amazing! The only thing I changed was I added corn and some ground chipotle chili seasoning. I will definitely be making this again!
Update 11/29/10: I made this tonight and it was just as delicious as the first time. Next time I think I will only use one can of broth as I personally like a thicker chili.

This dish was simple, delicious, and healthy to boot.  I substitued green chilis for the jalapenos and baked the chicken in the oven prior to shredding.  With every single bite, my husband exclaimed how good it was.  We both took the leftovers for lunch the next day and it was even better the second time around.  Yum!  I will definitely be making this again very soon.

This was easy to make, economical, and my whole family liked it!  I did reduce the amount of jalapeno peppers to 1 oz. and eliminated the green chilis.  It was still plenty spicy.  Also, I added a bit more garlic than what was called for, just because I love it.  I will definitely make this again.  To any of you who use prepackaged white chili mixes:  don't ever buy another one again!  This is so much better.

This is awesome. Definitely watch the amount of water, it will determine if you have a hearty or soupy chili... I like mine extra hearty, so I took someone else's advice and I always blend one can of the northern beans. MMM!! I usually half the amount of jalapenos too, out of consideration for others. =)

I have to give this 4 stars because I followed some of the reviews over the original recipe. I pureed 1 can of navy beans and 1 can of great northern beans to make a thicker base, and tossed in the other (drained but whole) can of great northern beans. I used 1 can of fat free broth and a can of low-fat cream of chicken soup. I used the whole 4 oz. of chiles but probably only about 4 jalapenos and some juice. I also cut back on the cayenne. Next time I'll use a little more, because it could have used a little more kick. I used a can of corn and tossed in a potato. I know that makes it less chili-ish, but I liked the veggies. I followed a reviewer's suggestion to use the crock pot and shredded (not too finely) the chicken about 4 hours in. We'll definitely make this one again with a little more seasoning. Thanks!

this is SOOOOOOO good - I've never made a white chili before and I wanted some (don't know why), I'm so glad I wanted some white chili.  My husband thought it would be gross and wasn't too thrilled to have it for dinner but he (and the children) happily ate at least two helpings.  I subbed mild green chiles for the jalapenos because it's better for the small kiddies, I can't wait to make this again.

I cannot get enough of this "chili".  My mom used to make this chili for us in the winter and I must admit, it makes me feel like a pro when I make it for myself now that I'm 4000+ miles away from home (even though it's nowhere near difficult to make).  There is nothing in this recipe that needs to be changed.  It is great the way it is written here, and with a few dashes of tabasco of course.  :)

Pretty hot for my taste but my boyfriend LOVED it. It's more of a soup than a 'chili'.. but great flavors. Next time I'll have to make some jalapeno corn bread to side with it.

This was great!  Next time, I will add more beans.  Because my boyfriend is less fond of spicy foods than I am, I only used half of the jalapenos and 1/4t of cayenne.  It was the perfect level of spice for him.

I have made this several times and it's my "go to" chili recipe now.  I leave out the onions because we don't like them and to make it healthier, I leave out the oil and cheese entirely.  I used 2 cups of chicken broth to thicken it up and it's perfect every time.  Last time I even left out garlic (current pregnancy aversion) and it was still awesome.

This is an outstanding recipe.  I had some cooked shredded chicken and some raw boneless breasts, so I cooked them first in the pot where I made the chili, adding some cumin, garlic powder and chili powder.  Then I took out the chicken and followed the recipe.  The modifications I made were to reduce the amount of cayenne and to add just a tiny pinch of cinnamon.  I used half of a fresh jalapeno and a can of mild chiles.  This made it spicy but not too hot.  I cooked the chili much longer than the recipe directed-probably close to an hour which made the flavors much deeper.  I also omitted the cheese, preferring to add it afterward to my individual portions.  Big yum!!!  Even my 9 year old son, who can be kind of picky, really liked it.

This is fabulous, but very spicy!  Since I love very spicy things, I make the recipe as written, but I could see how it would be too spicy for some.

Great recipe quick and easy.  I made it for a luncheon and the crock pot was licked clean when I went to clean up. I made one tiny change I pureed one can of the beans to help thicken. Thanks

Excellent!!  I used a chicken substitute (Quorn) and it turned out really well.  I also used mild green chilies so it wasn't so spicy.

Served for family friends who had never had a tastier chili! I didn't have jalapenos, and it was plenty spicy without. I also substituted a can of black beans for the white. Let it cook in crock pot all day, super easy! And delicious! Thanks for the recipe!!

This was just OK.  Nothing really wrong with it but it didn't really WOW me. I did use one finely diced fresh jalapeno instead of the canned and pureed one can of beans to thicken.  I cut down on the amount of spices used also.  It wasn't at all spicy though the leftovers may be after sitting overnight.

I didn't follow this recipe exactly, (I used ground turkey and decreased the broth to one can and the beans to 2 cans) but I thought the seasoning using oregano and cumin along with the jalapenos was very yummy.  I seasoned to my families tastes (not QUITE so spicy) and it was a very nice meal.  I will make this one again, thanks.

I've been making this recipe for my family for years. The first time I made it for my Dad, he raved about it so much, he requested my Mom copy the recipe right away! Our family loves the "spice" but we usually omit the jalapenos (or use just a few) from the recipe and add them as a topping later.

WOW! Followed the previous reviews and cut back on the spicy ingredients... Turned out FANTASTIC.  I let mine simmer for about an hour, which made the spices blend a little better than the "15 minute" recommendation.  Will make this again!

Very, very good.  This chili definitely has some heat to it.  I add some of the ingredients - cayenne pepper and jalapenos, slowly to control the heat.

I like a thicker chili so I took the advice of others and added a can of corn, drained, a can of black beans drained, 8 oz of chiles, no cayenne pepper and only 1 cup of chicken broth!  It was so good when I served it with sour cream and cheese!  My boyfriend liked it too!  Update:  I just tried to have this for leftovers and it wasn't good at all.  Maybe its bc I didn't have any sour cream left.

WOW!Great recipe for chilly winter nights!    I did make some changes, based solely on what I had on hand in the kitchen.  I added about 1/4 cup fresh chopped cilantro--this added a great flavor.  I didn't have cayenne pepper, so I used white pepper instead.  Also, I picked up a can of jalapeno peppers instead of green chiles by mistake, so I added about 1/2 of the can.  It was plenty hot enough and I LOVE spicy food!  I will try making it per the original recipe next time (when I shop for the correct ingredients)!  In the meantime, this was still a GREAT recipe and I will make it again--I highly recommend adding the fresh cilantro---tastes amazing!

Love this!  Is a huge hit everytime I make it.  VERY spicy, could cut down on the cayenne.  Always serve with sour cream & cheese... tortilla chips most excellent with it as well!

This recipe is a fall/winter staple at our house! It's usually the first thing I make when the weather starts to turn cold. I do make a few modifications, though: I use jarred jalapenos and no green chiles, I use a two cans of white beans and one can of black beans, and I serve cheese as a garnish instead of mixing it in. My husband and I prefer this recipe over traditional beef chili!

This recipie was a fantastic base to start from! I only changed a couple small things though. My husband isn't really into spicy, so I omitted the jalepenos. The green chilis and cayenne added just the right kick for us. Also, as per some previous suggestions, I blended one of the cans of beans before adding, and added the others bean water and all for a more thicker chili. It worked out great. I let each person decide how much cheese they wanted to add to their taste rather than mix it all in, and this worked out to everyone's advantage.  I love the flavor, it reminds me of a great cheen chili sauce at my favorite local mexican restuarant. I will be making this again soon, per my husband's request. So I know this was a hit!

We made it good.   I make very many moderations.   1. Used 1 can navy beans, 1 can kidney beans. Took 1/2 of each can and blended it up to thicken the chili.   2. Used 2 cans of green chilis.   3. Used one can of chicken broth (if not less)  4. Added hotsauce/lime/lemon juice mixture to make it tasty. It was very very bland before we did this.   5. Increased all spices.   6. Used only 1 shredded chicken  Topped with Cheese, and ate with our cornbread. I loved it! Very healthy!

WOW! This White Chicken Chili rocks!! We had some at a restaurant and I wanted to try it at home. It was so easy.. I didn't have but 2 cups of chicken and the only thing I changed was to use 1/2 the can of jalapenos,  and we also added some pepper jack cheese to the top. Really Good recipe!!

This is a great alternative to regular chili.  I made it with some cornbread and it was very filling.  The only changes I made was 1) add a can of corn & 2) puree 1 can of the beans.  Delicious!

Very, very, good! I did make some modifications due to the lack of having some ingredients on hand.  I only had 2 cans of beans and no cayenne, so in lieu of the cayenne I added some red pepper flakes.  Also, I did not add jalapenos because my husband can only withstand so much heat! It was very still flavorful and spicy. In order to thicken the sauce I added a bit of cornstarch! Oh, and I also added a couple tlbs of sourcream.  I was very yummy!

this is really great! i did make some changes as suggested...i pureed one can of beans for a thicker consistency and used maybe a cup or so of broth. i used a 7 oz can of green chiles, 2 oz of jalapeno, 2 stalks of celery, and 1/2 teaspoon of cayenne. this stilled turned out spicy, but not too much to handle. i didn't have fresh garlic, so i used a teaspoon of garlic powder. i really love cheese, so i added 2 cups of monterey jack. mmmmhh! i think this recipe makes a little more than 4 servings...maybe closer to 6 or 8 depending on how much you eat i guess! great recipe that can easily be modified to fit your tastes!

This is a basic recipe.  It has great flavor of its own but I add stuff here and there such as peppers or sasuage that need to be used.

I thought this recipe was fantastic, although mine wasn't very spicy - I used jarred jalepenos.  The second batch was requested the next day and I tripled the jalepenos and then it was much better.  I also let it simmer on the stovetop for about 9o minutes and it thickend up beautifully all on it's own.

Very good, we all enjoyed this one. I left out the jalapeno and shredded cheese and served those as toppings along with sour cream. Otherwise the only thing I did to thicken it up was to throw in a small can of creamed corn. TO brighten it up a bit, I added a squeeze of fresh lime juice to the pot just after turning the heat off. So satisfying with some warm cornbread on the side!

I loved this as well. I kept out most of the cheese and cut a little bit of the jalapeños and cayenne and it was still delicious.

This chili is phenomenal!!!! Did the thing where you puree one can of beans to thicken, but added a can of pickled jalepenos and a chopped up fresh jalepeno to the food processor. Made a great base with perfect consistency and flavor!!! Great recipe!! Thank you!!!

Fabulous Tasting! The only change I made was instead of using the full can of jalapenos, I just used the all the "jalapeno juice" in the can by draining it and none of the actual peppers, this gave it the pepper flavor and a bit of an edge that mellowed when we had it the next day. I used 4 cooked and shredded chicken breasts that I had seasoned with salt, pepper, poultry seasoning, bay leaf (remove after baking), 1/2 cup water and baked in baking pan covered tight with foil @ 375 for approx. 50 min.  Let cool 30 minutes prior to shredding.  Twice as good the next day!!!

This was delicious.  Don't expect it to be thick like chili, it's more of a soup, but it has a great flavor.  We did a few things differently:  We cooked everything in one pot, starting with cubing the raw chicken and sauteeing it.  We didn't have any jalapenos, so we left those out.  We used 1 tsp of ground cumin instead of 2.  With the tsp of cayenne, it was plenty spicy without the jalapenos.  We'll definitely have this again.

Wonderful Chili.. I have to confess I am a very competitive cook and strive to find the best recipe for every dish I make. This chili has wonderful flavoring and will be the only chicken chili recipe I make from now on. I did take others suggestions and did not add any jalapenos and 1/2'd the amount of cayenne pepper.

YUM!!! This is THE best!  This is my favorite recipe and the reason I'm addicted to allrecipes.com.  Everyone loves it.  I have shared it with many people and it's at the top of everyone's list!  It's super easy too!  Don't use jalapenos though, unless you like to eat fire.

Great white chili. It was a bit spicy for our taste so I'll probably use a little less ja ps next time. I also added a bit of sour cream which was great.

This was a good recipe but I can't give it 5 stars because I'm trying to recreate a white chicken chili that was made by a friend and this wasn't quite as good.  Not a bad substitute, though.  I used a bag of dried beans instead of canned.  I quick soaked them (boil for 2 minutes, let sit for an hour, drain), dumped them into a crock pot with the broth, seasonings, 2 cans of chili's, and a can of corn.  Toward the end of cooking I threw in the cooked chicken.  A pretty good version and I'll probably be making it again but I'm still hunting for the secret that made my friend's chicken chili so good.

EXCELLENT! I made this for some friends coming over and the guys just about licked the pot empty!  I tested it before adding the full can of Jalapenos -- and it definitely had a kick, but the flavor was worth the spice!!

This was a delicious, quick winter meal with great flavor for such a short cooking time.  Because I have small kids, I used just 1 tbs of the canned jalapeno and 1/4 tsp of the the cayenne, and it was still a bit too hot for them...but delicious to me!  We garnished with chopped fresh tomato and sour cream, yum!

Yum!  I made this into a slow cooker dish as well and made some small changes.  I didn't saute the onions, just put them in with the other ingredients.  I put one extra can of drained beans in and used 6 thin chicken breasts halves because it's what I had on hand.  I also hit it with a dash of chili seasoning and topped with sour cream.

This is a great recipe. Everyone raves over it every time I make it. I use two 4 oz. cans of green chiles and omit the jalopenos, and then top it with a dollop of sour cream and a few leaves of fresh cilantro. Very yummy! Today I'm going to try making it with leftover Thanksgiving turkey instead of chicken. We'll see if anyone can tell a difference!

Not bad! Added garlic salt, doubled the oregano.  I think hominy or corn would be a good addition.  Will make again.  Super easy & quick.

I made this for my Bible Study group and they loved it!! I didn't use the jalepanos, but the recipe had just enough kick without it. I'll make it again.

I make this once a month - and I always freeze a ziploc of rotisserie chicken or roasted chicken to make this so much easier. I do not added jalenpenos... hubby can't have the spice. I sometimes double this for a great family chili gathering! Always bake fresh cornbread muffins. We always put sour cream, cliantro and monterey cheese fresh grated! Thank you!!!

I've made this recipe at least 4 times now.  Its taste varies with what I have in my cupboards but it's always good!  I've learned to leave out the jalapeno's.  I usually puree 1 can of the beans to thicken it and add a can of corn.  One time I finely chopped some carrots and added them to the batch.  No one even noticed!  My vegetarian loves this without the chicken and I do too.  Thank you for this tasty recipe!

Overall it was a good recipe but TOO spicy even for my taste and I didn't add the cayenne or all of the "devil peppers" as my husband calls them. I added a can of corn to the batch which did cut some of the bite out of it. Overall I liked it but would leave out the "devil peppers" completely.

Awesome recipe! I would've preferred a little less spice . . . maybe two cans green chiles instead of using the one can of jalapenos or just decrease the amount of cayenne pepper. My husband said he would've liked it better if it was a little thicker. I had drained the beans, so maybe if I just would have used some or all of the liquid it would have thickened it up. I served with a dollop of sour cream. Oh, and instead of using cooked chicken, I just opened up two 12.5 oz cans of chunk chicken and added to soup. Very easy and flavorful.
I made this again using 2 cans diced chiles which tamed the heat down a little. Also pureed one can of beans to thicken it up. And started with 1/2 tsp cayenne and increased to taste. Much better!!!

Great recipe! I added a can of corn and a diced green pepper. Omitted the green chilis. Husband really liked it and he usually doesn't like chicken. Will make again.

My whole family LOVED this, as did I.  The only reason why I rated it a 4 was I thought there was too much liquid and was more like a soup.  So I added a little rice to soak up some of it.  Flavor was wonderful.  I did as some others suggested and only did half of the cayenne pepper and used two cans of green chilis instead of the jalapeno peppers and it certainly didn't lack anything in taste.  I have already bee asked to make it again!

This chili is delish!  I added left over corn and black beans as one reviewer suggested.  I didn't have any green chili's on hand but I adde more cayenne and some Kosher salt to taste.  Yum.

This was very, VERY good. My 4-year-old even liked it! Skipped the jalapenos (used two cans of chiles instead), and added only a dash of cayenne. Pureed one can of beans to make the broth thicker. This will definitely be part of our winter soup rotation. Thanks for the recipe!

Excellent recipe.  I love the flavor.  I cook the chicken breast with some salsa for extra flavor.  Add extra garlic.  Sometimes I stir in some cream cheese at the end for a creamier broth.

I tried this recipe after having a fabulous White Chicken Chili at a potluck.  Needless to say it did not compare, and I'm still searching. 
 
The Oregano totally doesn't match the other seasonings.  It would have been better if I'd left it out, but still not great.

I make this "exactly" as stated -- EXCEPT I had to decrease the amount of jalapeno peppers (I use 1 TBS) and the cayenne to 1/2 tsp.  While I love spicy food, it doesn't seem to love me these days.  These minor modifications have served me well as I've won over several beef-only chili fans.  One even sheepishly called for the recipe when her husband found out she liked it.  He'd been bugging her for years to try something different.  This chili comes together quickly--it's in regular rotation at our house.

Wow!  My wife and I loved this recipe.  And it ended up looking just little the picture on the site.  We baked a little cornbread to go a long with it.  It was quick and easy.  And would serve it at a party or potluck dinner.  I called it Penn State Chili because it's white chili with navy beans.  You know, Blue and White.

My husband will only eat mildly spicy food, so I used two cans of mild green chiles instead of jalapenos, and just a sprinkling of cayenne pepper.  I followed the rest of the recipe as written and it was fantastic -- we BOTH loved it.  Flavorful, but not too hot.

This recipe is sooo good!  I do NOT normally like chili, but I'm trying to learn to like it & came across this recipe.  DH loved it, too & told me to double it the next time I make it.  I served it with the Golden Sweet Cornbread from this site (submitted by Lori White)--awesome!!  **I did substitute both the canned chiles & jalapenos for 5 fresh jalapenos from my garden.

I have had a few different white chicken chili recipes and this one was by far the best! I did make some adjustments. When cooking the chicken I sprinkled garlic salt on it. I also did not put in the jalepenos in and only put in a pinch of cayenne pepper. I didn't want it too spicy due to having a 4 year old. With those adjustments, it was still very flavorful and delicious!

Good and spicy! I only used one can of beans because it was all I had and I thought it was perfect.  Three cans might be too much beans for our family. I forgot to add the cheese at the end and just added a dollop of sour cream to everyone's bowls! It was a great fall chili. thanks!

This is the best. I used rotisserie chicken and it was great.  The green chile taste really comes through.  Let it simmer a while.  Also, make some corn bread, or beer bread from this site.  Husband says AWESOME.

YEEEEHAWWW!!!!!  This sure is a spicy one!  But it's just the way i like it. But I only used one can of chilis that were fire-roasted which made it a bit smokier flavor.

Will definately make again.

Great recipe, this is the first time I made a white chili.  I took some advice of other members and added a can of black beans and corn.  I also omitted the jalapenos.  Recipe turned out great and delicious.

I used canned chicken in the soup, and that was too bland. That was my own fault though. I LOVED the broth though. Fantastic!

Perfect chicken chili - liked the heat, liked the consistancy, recently took to a party and gave out the receipe to most of the people there.  Just added corn for more texture and color.  Use it all the time for home and covered dish.

Delicious recipe. I love beans and thicker chili, so I added extra :) I also added a bit of uncooked elbow macaroni noodles. YUM!

Great base for a variety of different ingredients.  I followed the recipe except I used a can of chunk chicken breast, no jalapenos (did use jalapeno powder that I had), 2 cans of beans (drained and rinsed one) and 2 cups of stock.  Still - a great recipe all around!  I've even gotten co-workers to try it.  Definitely a keeper!

I adjusted the recipe so that I could serve to my 5 year old daughter.  I omitted the jalapeno's and and 1 can of beans.  I also did not have any jack cheese, so we did without and was more like a thick and hearty soup.  I added ditalini noodles, because it would be more appealing to my daughter.  Served with tortilla chips.

Good stuff!  Easy to add to - we added green chiles, corn - the possibilities are endless.  Cilantro is awesome with this too.

This is fantastic... I changed the types of beans mainly for "visual interest" and it was really easy to make.  The jalapeños were really powerful... Next time I may add only one of the two cans.

This was pretty good. I added a pkg of McCormick's White chicken chili seasonings. I used boneless chicken breast, seasoned and sauteed in skillet.I also added a can of whole kernel corn.

My sister made this chili for a large winter get together.  It was a big hit and the recipe was passed along.  I don't like it quite as spicy so I cut back on the peppers.

Very good, next time I would use low sodium chicken broth and find the lowest sodium northern beans. Our family likes spicy food, the heat is perfect.

Very tasty.  I cooked the chicken cubes in olive oil and garlic and pepper.  Cut waaaayyy back on the hot stuff, but still used each kind of pepper.  Used 3 different kinds of beans because I did not have the amount called for of the white beans.  Delicious!

Glad I found this one. Leftover grilled chicken was perfect. I used fresh jalepeno and green chili (I live in New Mexico) Also added 2 sliced zuchini to beef up the vegies I need, 1/2 can diced tomatoes and a handful of chopped cilantro. 2 cans of beans were fine. This is a keeper!

Excellent concept.  Loved the ease of making this, and that it's so versatile.  I also added corn and de-hottified it, so my kids would like it.  MmmmmmMMmmmMMMM  on a cold winter day...

Yum yum yum.  I lost my chicken chili recipe long ago and this one is just awesome.  I used 2 cans of green chilis rather than jalapenos and it had the perfect heat.

I cut the amount of Jalapenos in half, and it was still spicy, other than that I left everything the same. It is great for winter time!

Yummy!  I made a few changes to this recipe: I added a can of corn and only used 1/2 cans of the green and jalapeno peppers.  Cut the Cayenne pepper in half too.  I pureed one can of the white beans, like some others here suggested and only used one can of chicken broth.  The results were slightly spicy and really tasty.  Thanks for the recipe, this one's a keeper!

I rated it 4 out of 5 because 4 out of 5 people in my family ate it!  I skipped the jalapenos, cut the cayenne in half, added 1/2 tsp of chili powder and pureed 2/3 of the beans. Also used 1 1/2 cans (14 oz each) of low sodium chicken broth and salted to taste. It was very mild but very tasty. I could have handled it spicier but with 3 small kids I needed to keep the heat down.

My family loves this recipe! I've made a few minor changes. I use 1 lb of ground chicken and brown it (it seems quicker) and I use 2 fresh jalapeno's finely diced to replace the canned jalapenos and the green chiles. No other changes. Everytime I make it I get compliments.

Yum! I made a few changes that i think helped.  I only used one can of of chicken broth, three slices of a jalapeno pepper (my boyfriend is not a spicy fan, but its still spicy this way!), and one can of black beans in place of one can of white beans.  I also thickened up the chili a bit with some corn starch. It came out great!

I loved this! I can't handle too much spice, but I still want flavor, so I followed the alterations mentioned and left out the jalapenos, used 2 cans of green chiles, and pureed one can of beans. I used rotisserie chicken, topped with the cheese and some sour cream and it was wonderful!! It's perfect for this holiday weekend!

Hot, Hot, Hot! You got it...VERY good though. Will cut back on spices for the kids next time. They even like spicey things, but this was a touch too much. Very good recipe though. Will be making again. Hubby adores this!

This was a fantastic recipe!  It looked a little too spicy for our taste, so I only used about 2/3 of the jalapenos and about 1/3 tsp cayenne pepper.  I mashed up one can of beans to release some of the starchiness and thicken it up a little, and it came out great.  Even better the next day!

Very good! I left out the jalepenos so my kids would eat it. Everyone liked this even though I forgot to put in the cheese. Next time Ill be sure to include it. I love anything with cheese, so Im sure this will only be yummier!

Very good recipe.  I have made something like this before.  My kids didn't like it. I think they were afraid of the green peppers.  Usually they are not scared away by spicey foods but I think it was the color.  Anyway, taste was very good.

Very good.  Took the other raters' advice about it being too spicy, so I started on the bland side.  I added seasonings as it cooked to get it the way I liked it.  I cut the chicken broth to one can and cooked it for 35 minutes.  It came out plenty thick that way.

This recipe is so good! I followed the recipe exactly, except I mushed up some of the beans to make it a bit thicker. It was the perfect consistancy for me! And yes, it is VERY spicy!!

Flavor was very good, altho I used pepperoncini instead of the jalapenos. I felt the cumin overpowered the dish, and I didn't use nearly as much cayenne as stated. My biggest complaint was that the title of the recpe was misleading in that it was nothing like chili; it was soup. I even ran a can of beans thru the food processor to try and thicken it up. Will probably make this again, but add less broth and more beans. Thank you!

Given the many comments about how spicy-hot the recipe was as is, I skipped the canned jalapenos and peppers and replaced with a can of Rotel. As a result, I only needed one can of broth. I also added one carrot and some extra garlic. It was pretty good, and my husband liked it also, but I don’t know that I liked it well enough to make it again, at least as I did. I think it went from super spicy to borderline bland.

I had never had white chili before making this but my whole family loved this recipe...we thought it tasted kind of like tortilla soup.  Based on other reviews, I reduced the amount of water, left out the cayenne pepper, and used half the can of jalapenos.  This is a very versatile recipe and holds up well to lots of changes: I've added an extra can of black beans, canned corn, fresh green peppers, etc. and the result is always good.  We top with cheese instead of mixing it all in.

This was really good.  I wanted a bit creamier version so I substitued one cup of cream for the broth and it was great (makes a huge pot so I wasn't too worried about the extra fat content).   **Warning**   this is spicy!  My husband and I love spicy and I only used 1/2 the cayenne based on other reviews...it was almost too much.  I would cut down the jalapenos and cayenne if you don't like too much kick.  Otherwise, great meal served with warm cornbread or rolls. Thanks!

Excellent chili as written.  After reading reviews, I pureed one can of beans in my food processor to make it thicker.  That was the only change I made.

I like spicy food a lot, but this was HOT! I left everything as the recipe states, but next time, I'll leave out some of the cayenne pepper.. I think that's what makes it hot, more than the jalepenos.  Excellent flavor and consistency.  Great for winter and it only took about 1 hour to make!

I modified a little based on what I had on hand, but like any good recipe it served as a great base to spring off of.  A nice break from our traditional chili and it was a great way to use my leftover chicken.

Whew! this was spicy!!! I like spicy stuff, but even I had a coughing fit during dinner!! It was my fault though.. I couldn't find a 4oz can of jalepenos, so I bought sliced ones, and guessed on the 4oz part. I had a scale to weigh them on, but they musta been spicier than canned, plus I chopped them up myself, so I think that brought out the HOT! I wound up putting a dollop of sour cream on top, and then kinda mixed it up in my bowl to tame the taste a bit.. I put a good bit of sour cream in the rest of the chili, and added water and more chicken broth to bring it down too.. Hopefully my hubby will like it, daughter thought it was too spicy (she is 6.)  but she still liked it..

Thanks for the recipe, I will be making this again, minus so many jalepenos!!

Very tasty! I've never made white chili before, and this is definitely a keeper. Smelled very good! My only deviations were adding a little fresh cilantro, and a 7oz can of chilies because that's all I had. It wasn't too spicy at all. I found another way to make it thicker, if you have time...just let it simmer an hour or two. Even though I added all the liquids and didn't puree the beans, it ended up nice and thick! It also wasn't as spicy at that point too as it was after 30 minutes...I guess because the beans broke down more.

A really easy chili and it has a lot of flavor.  I added more cheese and a little more peppers, but all in all, it was simple, fast, and tasty!

A pretty decent chili, but nothing to blow you away.  Used way less broth, since we like a thicker chili.  Also used all jalepeno's.

Because of all the fog and rainy yuck we've been having, I spontaneously decided chili would be a good idea tonight. I cooked the recipe and then saw that it was thin  (I think it's supposed to be that way), but the hubbie likes thicker chili, so I added 2 tablespoons each of cornstarch and flour, and two extra cans of beans (we wanted a lot to freeze for lunches at work). With those changes, and salt and pepper to taste, it was a pretty good recipe! We'll be making it again this winter I'm sure!

I thought this was very good. I love spicy foods and didn't think it was too hot by any means. I used turkey instead of chicken and fresh roasted Anaheim green chilis and jalepenos because they are available where I live. The next time I make this I will probably cut down on the cumin a little bit.

LOVED IT!!  This was a great, easy and SPICY recipe!  I love spicy foods and the jalepenos really give this a great kick!  But next time, for my family's sake, I'm going to tone it down a bit and just use  the green chiles instead!  We added sour cream to this and that really made it tasty as well! I think I like this ALOT better than regular chili!!  YUM-O!!!

I had never tried White Chicken Chili until now and I was pleasantly surprised.  I did not add any jalapenos so it didn't have alot of "kick" but did have alot of flavor.  A co-worker had recently tried another white chicken chili recipe and was not impressed with it.  I took her a bowl of this recipe and she said it was much better than her recipe.  I will make this again!

This is an easy five star recipe.  The ingredients are easy to find and the soup is easy to assemble.  I did not have diced jalapeno peppers or chopped green chili peppers so I diced a green pepper to retain the green color and added a can of Rot*el tomatoes and diced jalapeno peppers.  The red of the tomatoes combined with the green pepper provides a very festive look.  Wishing to keep the white chili color, I drained the canned Rot*el.  Prepared this way, the hot intensity was absolutely perfect; spicy and tasty, but not overwhelming.  The next time I prepare this soup I will prepare it as written and compare.  One way or the other, I have no doubt that this recipe is a winner.

My son  and his friends LOVED this recipe.  Cut the jalapenos in half and the cayenne.  sprinkled the cheese on top and ate it with jalapeno and cheese corn bread.  Finished off with a pineapple with crasins bread pudding. IT was perfect after they had bveen shoveling snow and snowmobiling all day!

Wow this really does have a kick to it and I only put in half the peppers and no cayenne!  Followed the advice of others and mashed up some of the beans to make the soup a bit thicker.  Overall very good but still not quite what I was looking for.

This was awesome! My husband and I loved this chili! I substituted one can each of kidney, black and navy beans instead of the white beans plus I added one chopped green bell pepper. Warning: I halved the jalapeno and chile peppers and it was still almost too hot to eat!

As chili's go, this is one of the best.  My husband and I loved it, but my 11 year old only gave it a 3.  It was a little thin so I added about 3/4 tablespoon of flour while it was simmering.  Then I added almost 2 cups of monterey cheese.  It was a perfect consistancy.  I only used 2 cans of beans and there were still plenty to fill the chili.  Also I simmered for a half an hour and served with crackers.  You can't ask for much more out of a white chili than this.  Thanks Cha Cha.

This recipe was fabulous, more of a soup then a chili but will definately make again!  I recommend shredding the chicken breasts instead of chopping, but that's just my preference. Great recipe!

Excellent!  I did omit the cheese (so some might say I'm not reviewing the same recipe), but I felt I really didn't need the fat ... and the chili was great without.  I also omitted the cayenne (because I didn't have any) and threw in some chipolte chili powder ('bout a tablespoon).  MY chili came out VERY spicy....and good.  I also used rather large chunks of browned, boneless chicken breast.  Yum!!

I really liked the flavors of this dish, but I found it to be a bit spicy for my taste. My roommate thought it was perfect. I would suggest tweaking the amount of cayenne pepper to your taste.

This was great.  I cooked for the very first time for my whole family and everyone had 3 bowls.  I suggest easing up on the jalipinos and pulling apart the chicken instead of chopping.  I also added some more beans to thicken it up.

It is amazing how this dish looks like a creamy soup but tastes exactly like chili! If you do not like spicy ease up on the cayenne because I like spicy and this was almost too much for me. Very delicious...will make again.

This rocked!! I made a separate bowl for the kids and omitted the jalapenos for them - they loved it - even my 2 year old loved it.  Awesome recipe

I really enjoyed this dish and so did my family.  It was alittle spicy, not too spicy for our family but I thought it could be for others.  I liked that this dish was very healthy and I think that the nutritional info on is wrong.  It can't have that many calories and fat, well atleast mine didn't.  It is a great dish, I will be making this a regular meal in my home.

This recipe was a hit. I used black eyed peas with bacon instead of white beans. I didn't have any fresh garlic so I used dehydrated minced garlic along with garlic salt, pepper, and chicken bouillon granules to taste. I forgot to add the cheese, but it was still good. Was more like thick soup. The chili did not have a lingering hot taste. Don't leave anything out. Along with this chili, I served rice and crackers. I will definitely make this recipe again. Thanks!

This was very good. I agree with those who claim it is more like soup than chili. In an effort to thicken it up, I pureed one can of beans and added 1 T cornstarch. I think it contains too much broth to actually be "chili," but it's still very good. 

Because I don't like very spicy foods and I have two young kids to please, I omitted the jalapenos and used just a dash of cayenne.  I also added about 3/4 c. frozen corn.
Very tasty, excellent for a chilly night.

This was a very tasty chili. I didn't add jalapenos as I had none in the house, but it was spicy enough. It was a little runny like soup, so next time I will smash a can of beans first as others suggested. It was excellent otherwise.

I make this all the time.  I use left over chicken or turkey.  Sometimes I puree the beans to make it thicker.  I add more cheese too.  It is very spicy so I use 1/2 the 4oz can of diced jalepenos.  LOVE IT!!!!

Most excellent! I can't eat spicy foods so I left out the jalapeno peppers and added an extra can of green chili's    and extra clove of garlic, cut back the  cumin to one tsp. It was sooo yummy!

Great recipe !  I did not add the japelenos because I know for my family it would have been to SPICY.  However, the green chili's were just fine for the right amount of KICK.

I found this rendition of white chicken chili extremely bland even with the great blend of spices.  I added much more of the spices than it recommened and still felt it had little substance.  I also added a can of chili ready tomoatoes and a can of corn as suggested by another review.  Didn't help much.  Probably will not make again.

I make this chili at least twice a month during the winter. I love it! I usually add a can of corn, a few pieces of tomato, and sub one of the cans of white beans for black. YUM!

Delicious.  I couldn't believe how good this was.  I thought it would be good, but not anything special, but it was fantastic.  I would recommend not adding all the jalepenos unless you really like very hot food.  I added about 2 teaspoons full and it had plenty of spice!

Great flavor and easy to make! Gave fours stars because I had to make some adjustments to thicken it up.  I pureed an extra can of beans as well as using corn starch mixed in a little liquid.

My family loves this!  I don't add quite as many jalepenos though I keep the same amount of chilis.  I'm usually pretty liberal with the spices too, plus I like adding garlic and onion powder, and substitute chili powder for the cayenne pepper.  This is a really yummy dish and it tastes great cold the next day!

I had this recipe years ago and lost it.  I found it again on allrecipes.  Thank you.  Alteration I have made include using fresh chiles and jalapenos.  Substituting one can of white bean for rinsed black beans.

This was very good and easy. Instead of having cooked chicken on hand I just cooked it with the onions and lots of garlic and lots of spices, then put in the chicken broth and the beans.  It made it a quick meal to make. Served with cornbread instead of corn chip--we are from the south and it just seemed appropriate. Even my stepdaughter ate 2 bowls. God bless my husband he eats anything I put in front of him (he ate 2 bowls too)...luckily I haven't made anything he didn't like.

I love this recipe.  My 2 and 4 year old even eat it if I put enough crackers in it.  I follow the recipe pretty close except I add a cup or two of frozen corn and I put extra cheese in.  Also great with deep fried tortilla strips on top.

I did not like the flavor of this recipe at all.  Yesterday I was so excited to try it since it got great reviews, but it was quite disappointing.  It was not too spicy.  It just has a weird taste.  I followed this recipe exactly.:(

I couldn't seem to get this thick enough (even with crushing a can of beans and adding sour cream) but the taste was amazing! Seemed more like soup than chili.

Excellent soup/chili. I left out the jalapenos and like LadyJayPee, I added a 4th can of beans (black beans, which were delicious!) I also added a package of deluxe american cheese. I only had 2 cups of chicken so I added a can of chunked chicken breast. I didn't have cumin, but will definitely get some for next time. Great recipe!

Excellent.  My husband loved this and has asked for it again.  I did what some of the others before me have done.  I used 1 can of chicken broth and one can of cream of chicken.  I used mild green chilis and only added 2 oz. of jalepenos.  And 1/4 teaspoon of red pepper.  It was plenty hot for me but easily cooled with a little mexi cheese mix and sour cream.  My husband could have had all the jalepenos added.  I always go easy with red pepper.  Its potent stuff.  This is a keeper.  Made it for friends and they loved it!!

I love this recipe!!! This is the best chili I have ever made. I didn't change a thing. If I were to make it for my family I would cut down on the peppers and cayenne, but for me I would not change a thing. I love spicy... this is outstanding.

I love this recipe.  We now use it once a month in our Wednesday night church soup night.  It is similar to the white chicken chili you get at Ruby Tuesdays.  I just throw in the raw chicken with the soup,cook a while and shred. It takes a little longer than 15 minutes, but it is very simple and you can throw this together in minutes.  Also works in the crockpot. when you have leftovers and have already eaten it few times, you can use it another way.., it thickens in the fridge and it can be a great filling for burritos.

This is very similar to my recipe. I cook for a large family and add one more can each of the beans and stock. I haven't tried the jalapenos. I also garnish with sour cream. Very yummy! I have had many people who say they don't like White Chili, but love this version!
Thanks for posting it!

I was incouraged to cut the liquid in half and it was to much bean. I am a vegetarian and I eat a lot of beans but wow on the beans. Good flavor though.

Excellent!  Omitted the jalepenos and added an extra cup of cheese for personal preference.  Also, stuck one can of the beans in the blender to make creamier.

This chili is delicious!  Don't worry about the peppers, its not too spicy.  I used a little more cheese than called for.  I also stirred in a little sour cream and cream cheese to thicken (I know this sounds weird, but it was great!)

Loved it! I left out the jalapenos b/c my family can't handle "to spicy".

I also let it simmer about 45 minutes to thicken it up. Next time I will crush a can of the beans.

Will make again and again!

We've been making this for a couple years.  We add a dollop of sour cream in the middle of the bowl (after it's cooked).  Very good.

Ok, I won the chili cookoff at work with this recipe today.  I went ahead and added a tub of fat-free sour cream and a package each of pepper jack and monterey jack cheese to thicken it up some more before serving.  I skipped softening the onion in a skillet and just threw 1/2 an onion into the pot (otherwise it is too strong).  I also used 4 packages of pre-cooked grilled chicken strips (like what you would put on a salad).

Took other reviewers suggestions and pureed one can of the beans. Added sour cream and smidge of cream cheese. Used store bought cajun chicken already cooked. Put it in my crock pot and it was just wonderful. My boyfriend said that it tasted like a local restaurant he loves to get this from!

Very easy. I did have to Dr. it up a bit though. Was spicy because of the jalapenos  but also bland for lack of salt. I had to add powdered chicken buillion to give it more flavor. Next time I will add the sour cream as another cook suggested because it needed to be thicker. Was tasty though. I will try it again.

This chili was exactly what I was looking for.  They serve it at my favorite restaurant and wanted to duplicate the recipe and I couldn't have asked for it to be any better.  It was even better the next couple days.  I didn't change anything.  Not too spicy at all.

LOVE this recipe!!  Rave reviews from everyone I make it for!  I change it up a bit though, to make it thicker.  I use 2 4 oz. cans green chiles, and about 5 or 6 slices of a fresh jalepeno diced, then when the soup is all put together, I add a few Tbsp. each of cream cheese and sour cream!  Makes it sooo delicious!  Best recipe I have!

OH MY GOD THIS IS GOOD!!!  Following some reviewers advice I pureed one can of beans and used in extra can incidentally.  I baked the chicken and seasoned it with some McCormick chili seasoning which added to the spice but as I left out the jalepenos, mine wasn't quite as hot to begin with.  I also cut down the cayenne a smidge as well.  This is now my favorite soup.  Incredibly good - hats off to the chef!

Just did not care much for this, surprised because of the high ratings.  Perhaps because I had a hankering for white chicken chili after trying Ruby Tuesday's.  This recipe did not come close.  It was like watery bean soup with chicken and spices.  My husband enjoyed it, though.  He said "4 stars!".  I had to put plenty of sour cream & cheese and then it was maybe 3 stars.  I won't be making this again (hope hubby will forget about it so he doesn't request it, lol).

This was my first attempt at cooking and eating white chili.  It was excellent.  I do not like hot food and the heat almost killed me but once I got beyond that the taste was great.  My bf loves hot food. He said it was "mildly tangy".

I cut the cayenne pepper in half, and only put a tsp of jalapenos in, and it was still too hot!  Cut down the spice, and will be better!  Serve with Absolute Mexican Cornbread!

I made this two times and the 2nd time I made some adjustments and it was OUT OF THIS WORLD GOOD!!!

I used dark meat instead of chicken breast & used some of the water I boiled the chicken in for half of the chicken broth required and the other half store-bought. Dark meat is much more flavorful. 

As is, the recipe is HOT (too HOT even for me who loves hot foods) so cut back on the jalapenos and chillies. If yours turns out spicy, add a little milk at the end (it will not affect the flavor, just the spiciness) and add more cheese. Sour cream and plain yogurt will also help.

We enjoyed ours with crispy oven-baked garlic bread....wow so good!!!

Absolutely delicious! I had white chili once, years ago and have been looking for a recipe ever since. I took the advice of a few other reviewers and pureed one can of beans and added cornstarch to thicken it up a bit. I left out the jalepenos (I like spice, but not too much!) I also added a little salt and used a bag of "mexican" cheese mixture (cheddar, aseago, monterey). Even my VERY picky 13-year-old daughter loves it! I made cornbread to go with it for dinner. Thanks, Cathy!

Very very good and very simple.  I added about a 1/2 cup of salsa verde and served with sour cream.  It was a hit with everyone.  I also used chicken thighs - cheaper and really good with recipes such as this.

So easy to make and so full of flavor!  This one is a keeper for sure.  We'll experiment with some other peppers - we'd love to find something in the 'medium' range to replace the jalapenos.  We love spicy dishes, but this one was really close to our upper limit.

This was delicious!  I added some jalapeno's from the jar and only 1/2 teaspoon cayenne and it was spiced right for us.  Also used a little Wondra flour to thicken it up a bit.  Served this with long grain rice and it was perfect.  Can't wait to make this again--YUM!

This was sooooo good!  I  doubled the recipe, then substituted one can of green chile peppers for one of the cans of jalepenos.  I also pureed one can of beans and added the juice from one lime.  My husband and two children loved it!  I will definitely make this again!

This is excellent.  I added an additional can of great northern beans and, as suggested by others, mashed those up before adding it to the broth. The chili has a nice kick, but it's not overpowering at all.

This was a great recipe.  I had never had white chili before and decided to try it.  It turned out very good, but a little on the hot side. I'll make it more mild next time.  A keeper!

I like spicy food, but I believe their is too much Cayene in this recipe, really dominates the soup.  Besides that, I couldn't really taste anything in this recipe.

Basically followed the recipe except i added a can of Rotel instead of Chiles or jalepenos.  Also added some frozen spinach that had been thawed and squeezed dry.  After I sauteed (sp) the onions and garlic, I added everythig else and simmered for 30 min.  Just wonderful!

This was very good. I left the jalapenos out so my kids would eat it and my husband, who likes things spicier than the rest of us, just added them on top. Served it with sour cream, extra cheese, and tortilla chips. My kids enjoyed preparing their own bowls. Definately a repeater in my house.

This recipe was OK.  Next time, I will marinate the chicken before using it in the soup.  It tasted a little bland.  Also, wasn't as thick as I usually like it to be.  I will still play around with it to my liking.

Fabulous soup but WAAAAAY to much jalapenos! 4 oz is a LOT! We like spicy food but next time I'll cut the jalapenos in half. This will be a staple on our cold weather meals list.

I have been making this recipe for at least 2 years now, and EVERYONE loves it!  When I think of white chicken chili this is the only kind...nothing else compares.  It is so easy to make.  It's great for those cold winter nights. Enjoy!

I only had one can of chicken broth, so it came out thicker, but I really enjoyed it. I used half the amount of green chilis and no jalapeno pepper's and it was still spicy, but spicy good!

My whole family loved this!  Even my picky "corndogs only" kid loved it.  I served cornbread with it, which ended up going in our bowls with the chili which compliments it wonderfully! The only thing I changed was using fresh garlic and Cojack cheese, as that was what I had.  Thank you!!  This is a definate keeper!!!!

Alls I can say is WOW!!! This chili was wonderful! I only changed a few things. By reducing the beans by one can I added one 15oz can of hominy. This helped to thicken the soup without adding the cornstartch. Thanks for an addition to my  recipe collection!! Cha Cha Cha!!!

This is an AWESOME recipe. It definitely has some kick, but we loved it. The only changes I made was only 2 cans of beans and 1 can of corn, and then thickening it with cornstarch/water. It seemed too thin to be 'chili'. Then when we put it into our bowl and put extra cheese on top, a dollop of sour cream and crushed tortilla chips. I really can't say enough about how delicious it was. Will make again and again. Thanks!!

Delicious!  Didn't change a thing.  We especially liked the fact that it wasn't super dense.  It definitely has some zip. Thx for sharing your recipe.

My husband and I thought this was fabulous! It was a little spicier than I'd usually go, but it was great.  I did add a little cornstarch to thicken it.  I'll definitely make this again.  Thanks!

The chili was delicious and easy to make- full of flavor. I did not add the jalepenos and it was plenty spicy for me. I added sour cream to the soup to make it creamier and used pepper jack cheese on top. All my roommates loved it, I will definitely make this again!

This chili is great! A little hot(spicy) but excellent. The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is because it is a little watery. I take some of the beans and puree them to thicken the chili. If it needs more thickening then I will use some corn starch mixed with some of the liquid and then add it back in to the chili.

I MADE THIS RECIPE AS IT WAS WRITTEN AND MY FAMILY LIKED IT. I CHOSE IT PRIMARILY BECAUSE OF THE FIVE STARS IT RECIEVED, IF ANY THING I COULD CHANGE IN THE FUTURE WOULD BE TO REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF BEANS, IT WAS KINDA BEANIE... ANY WAYS, IT WAS OK, THE SAUCE IT CREATED WAS PRETTY GOOD.

it was a little spicy for my liking but very full of flavor, i did notice though in making the chili that you should make sure that you have sour cream for the soup as well, that makes it even creamier. we also had to thicken it up a little bit with some flour so it wasn't so watery. overall though it was very tasty.

Great recipe however I thought it was missing something.  I will take the advice of some of the other reviews and consider adding corn, cilantro, or green or red pepper the next time I make it. I think these colorful additions might make it visually pop. I would also consider reducing the chicken broth for a heartier texture.  While this was hot, it was perfect for my taste.  I will definately make this again!

I did end up using the blender on the beans as it just seemed "too beany" for my family to eat.  The consitancy was good then and it did thicken the soup.  The flavor was also ok but it is not a dish I will make again.  I am still looking for the perfect white chili.

Watch out for the heat on this one. I've actually made this twice now...once exactly like the recipe and then again with more green chilies and a lot less jalepeno! My mouth couldn't take the first version, but the milder version, as many before me have mentioned, was much more palatable! It freezes well and can be gently reheated in the slow cooker for an easy lunch or dinner.

This was a great recipe. I increased the serving size. I used 2 cans of great northern beans and 2 cans of navy beans.  I topped each bowl with  cheese and cilantro as an individual options. Also, tortilla chips with a hint of lime, was a good accompaniment. I will definitely make this again.

This was really good. easy and fast. I will definitely make it again. We added more jalapenos than it called for. Lots of heat but really good. We put sour cream in the bowls and skipped the cheese cause we didn't have it.

My only regret is that I didn't post this rave review long ago when I first started making Cha Cha's Chili!  I've made it literally dozens of times and everyone asks for your recipe...it's perfection.  Thank you for a quick, easy, delicious make ahead meal with character!  Everyone in Boston thanks you!

Excellent!  It was definitely a hit.  I'm sure to make it again.  I did leave out the jalapenos for some family members but it still had a good kick to it.

I recently went to make this recipe again, but this time, I decided to experiment.  I replaced one can of white beans with a can of black beans.  I also added a teaspoon more cumin and 3 teaspoons of curry powder.  It was fabulous!!!

This is a Very easy recipe to prepare. I followed the recipe exactly, and have no complaints. Yes, this is hot, but that is what I was looking for and it pleased the adults in the house greatly. I picked out the chicken for my bowl (vegetarian), and thought it to be good, but could have had some celery or something else in it. (The meat eaters were pleased with the added chicken.) We all topped our bowls with sour cream and some added oyster crackers. Yum Yum!

This recipe was awesome!  My family loved it,and so did my co-workers.  I didn't use the jalepenos and not quite as much of the green chiles as the recipe called for.  Also, I added 1 can creamed corn and 1 can yellow corn for a different twist.

Such an easy and tasty meal.  I made a triple batch and it served many more than 12.  

I would've liked it to be thicker, though, so I think next time I'll either not put in as much broth or add a little flour to thicken it.

I thought this was excellent and very easy to make.  I used rotisserie chicken from the store and shredded it.  I also reduced the broth by 1/2 can and used mild green chiles instead of jalapenos.  I found it was not spicy at all when I did this, so next time I will stick with the hotter peppers.  Overall it was delicious, easy and heated up great for leftovers stuffed in a warm tortilla with sour cream.  Yum!  I will definitely be adding this to my rotation.

Absolutely amazing!  The only thing I changed is using low sodium chicken broth.  It was still pretty salty, but so good!  It had just the right amount of zip to it.  I will be making this again!  Thanks for the recipe.

Wonderful flavor but very spicy!  A little too much so for my taste but my husband felt it was "perfect"!  Used 1 pound of dry small white beans that I precooked with a little minced garlic instead of canned beans.  Also makes many more than 4 servings.  Will definitely make again but probably with only 1/2 can jalapenos.  Update.  Made this for people who don't "do" spicy and totally eliminated the jalapenos and only used 1/2 tsp cayenne.  Was great with wonderful flavor.  Served with cayenne on the table so we could spice it up some.

I omitted all but a little of the cayenne pepper.  It was awesome!  I did forget to add the cheese!!  I had it at a friends and it was definitely a 5!  It must've been the cheese.  I also crushed up an extra can of beans to make it thicker.

my family loved this recipe.  only changes were, left out the jalapenos and uses 2 can green chillis.  also added about a 1/2 cup uncook rice and simmered until tender before adding the cheese.

I added some green onions and chopped cilantro to the chili at the end. I also added a little flour to help thicken it. Instead of cooked chicken, I used fresh raw chicken cubed  and cooked the cubes prior to adding the onions. Then I used some fresh yellow chilies, instead of jalapenos, with the green chilies. It gave it the flavor without so much heat. All in all this is a great recipe and I will spread the word to my friends about just how good it is. Thanks Missy in WA.

I loved this recipe! I made it exactly as the recipe was written.  I made a big pot and my husband and I ate it all week.  I will definitely be making it again.

I tweeked this recipe by not adding hot peppers and adding 2 cans of cream of chicken soup and some corn starch to thicken. My husband loved it and said it was the best chicken chili he's ever had - even went to work and told co-workers about chili! almost forgot - I also put it in my slow cooker for 6 hours - great recipe!

This is a REALLY great recipe. I will be making this again this winter for sure.  My husband and I love spicy food so I follows the recipe exact.  As another reviewer said, I wasn't sure if I was supposed to drain the beans or not so I just dumped the cans in, liquid and all. I think it made it a little thinner than I like my chili so I just mixed 2 Tbs of Wondra with a 1/4 cup milk, tempered it and added it to the chili to thicken. AWESOME! Highly recommended for spicy chili lovers who want something a little different than regular chili.

This recipe was super!  It was full of flavor and a lot of KICK!  I added the two cans of diced green chilis instead of 1 of jalapenos and 1 of green chilis and it was still HOT so beware!  I also added a can of corn white was a nice addition as well!  Enjoy!

WOW!!  When I was putting this together I wasn't so sure, but after making it I'm sold.  This is not only THE best chili I've tasted it is one of the best soups/stews I've ever had.  I went straight by the recipe with two exceptions, 1)  I used 4 fresh jalapeno peppers instead of canned ones, 2)  I was out of cumin, so I used chili powder instead.  This is an absolutely fantastic recipe and one I cannot wait to make again.

This is almost the same recipe that I've made for years.  I add a can of Ro-Tel with cilantro and lime to mine.  And I use a roasted chicken from the deli.  Adds a great flavour and it's a major time saver if you're really busy.  My entire family loves it!

Yummy!!! I have never had chicken chili....so glad I tried this. I did add a little less jalepenos and more cheese...I thought the cheese thickened it a little. I wasnt sure if you were supposed to drain and rinse the beans, so I just put the juice from the can in too! Will make again soon....

Very tasty! We loved this dish. The spices are just perfect. I made it without the cheese and cooked it for about an hour so the beans would soften more.  Will definitely be making this again and again!

I used ground turkey and it was fabulous. I think now I wouldn't have my chili any other way.  Even my Texan boyfriend liked it and he's a chili purist.  He said it was "lick the bowl good."

Mmm mmm good!  I loved every morsel of it!  I was so upset that I allowed some of the leftovers to spoil (I forgot that it was at the bottom of the fridge), but luckily I froze a little for a rainy day.  I will be making this recipe again when the temperature drops!

Fantastic! I followed the other user's advice and reduced the amount of diced jalapenos. It was still spicy enough and it was a big hit at my chili party--More flavor than other white chilis.

Great recipe, I highly recommend it for those who like spicy food.  Boiled chicken and shredded it, used 1.5 cans of chicken broth, and mashed 1 can of beans like other users suggested.  Used habanero white cheddar cheese.  Very yummy!

Wow, after many failed recipes for a white chicken chili/soup,  THIS is it :)  I read all of the reviewers comments and made some *slight* adjustments.  Since many commented that it was spicy, I tried to tone it down a few notches by 1/2 tsp of chyenne pepper, used approx 6 slices of nacho style jalepeno, diced, along w/ the  1 can of green chili peppers.  It was still very spicy/hot  but  just enuf for my taste :)   I thought the recipe was a little thin, as I think of chili as being chunky....So I  pureed one can on the beans( Great Northern), and then using my stick blender I gave the entire pot a few pulses, to thicken up the "soup". I also cooked it on a low simmer for 1 hour, again, to thicken up... I ended up w/ a hearty soup texture, which was perfect :)  I also  added a big dollop of sour cream which offset the spiciness perfectly ...

This recipe was excellent. I've made it three times in two weeks. All my family and friends say it's the best they ever had. I did omit the jalapeno peppers because it was too hot the first time I made it. Great with tortillas.

I used one can chicken stock, and 4 cans of beans-undrained- simmered all afternoon and it was just as thick and tasty as can be.  This is a keeper!

Although I had to improvise this came out great! I didnt have a can of chopped green chilies so I used a can of green chili enchilada sauce and I sauted fresh chopped chicken breast with onions and garlic before adding any other ingredients. I brought it to a hard boil about 5 minutes before simmering in order to get the beans to come apart some and thicken it up. Serving sliced pickled jalapenos on the side satisfied my fiery friends. I will make it again!

It was very good but could be too spicy for some.  The next time I make it I will puree 1/2 the beans to give the dish a less soup like consistency.  If you want to cut the calories, it was great with or without the cheese.

This was easy and delicious.  We made it for a football party and everyone loved it.  The left overs were great on some tortilla chips with cheese and sour cream!

This was awesome chili and so easy. The only change that we made was to use drained and rinsed pinto beans instead of the white beans, otherwise I wouldn't change a thing. It even impressed my husband's Dad from New Mexico, and believe me it is hard to make a spicy dish that he approves of let alone compliments me on!!!! Thanks Cha Cha

This is a fantastic recipe! My family loved it! I added a little extra jalapenos and cheese. It really is a five star recipe!

Easy recipe.  I added a can of diced tomatoes and used about half the broth.  I also used colby-jack cheese on the side instead of added in.  It wasn't totaly white anymore but it sure was good!

Pretty decent. Accidently made it with Southern style navy beans (premashed, and pork flavored). Honestly, it made it just the right consistancy between that and cutting the chicken broth in half. I wouldn't consider myself a spice fanatic, but this really wasn't terribly overpowering.

I made this tonight for dinner and it was AWESOME!  I ommitted the green chiles because I didn't have them, but it was still great!  Served it with a handful more of the cheese on top.  Great recipe, Cathy!

This was delicious.  My husband didn't even insist on adding Tobasco.  It would be lower fat without the cheese, but then it would be too watery.  I'm going to submit it for the chili cookoff at work next year!

I made this for a week-end get-away with 3 girlfriends. It was quick and easy. They all thought it was great and warmed us up after a long day of shopping.

Excellent!  I added about a teaspoon of crushed red pepper for more intensity!  Great winter soup.

This was nice and filling.  I didn't put in  all the jalapenos so my kids would eat it.  It wasn't very spicy, but had nice flavor.
