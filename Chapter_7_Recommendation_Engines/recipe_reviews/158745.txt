Excellent! I used the full-on fat and sugar ingredients because I have a full figure to maintain, but otherwise followed the directions exactly. I also took the previous reviewers' suggestion of putting the creamed squash back into the squash shells - pretty cute. This turned out a little 'soupier' than I imagined - which made me think of...soup! This recipe could easily be tweaked into a kickass sqaush soup - think I'm gonna do it! Thanks Laurie - another good one! ;)

Yummy!  I used fat-free cream cheese plus a heaping tbsp of low-fat sour cream to give it a little more richness since I eliminated the fat from the cream cheese.  I also scooped it back into the shells to bake, but ended up with only enough mixture to fill three out of the four shells generously (forgot there's some empty space where the seeds used to be!)  This would make a nice change from mashed potatoes, and if using a fat-free or lower fat version, I think it would be a healthier alternative...more fiber, vitamins, etc.  I will definitely make this again!

using orange juice during initial prebake of squash adds some citrus flavor.  Adding apples to the bakes also added some nice some flavor and substance.

Very tasty way to do acorn squash, which my kids and I just love!  I didn't use the low-fat cream cheese because I've never found it to bake/cook well, and instead of returning the squash to a baking dish, I scooped it back into the shells (I had deliberately left them 1/2" thick so they'd hold up).  Tasted and looked great!

I started out by making this recipe as directed, but when I tasted it, the tang from the cream cheese was just overwhelming, so I added a significant amount of extra brown sugar. I also used pecans instead of walnuts. Even with those changes it still wasn't a winner for our family. I won't be making this again. Sorry!

I modified the recipe replacing the cream cheese with 1/4 cup drained non-fat Greek yogurt per squash. Yum.

I felt this had an odd taste, maybe due to the splenda or nutmeg?  I would make it again with real sugar and no nutmeg, or maybe use honey instead of sugar.

Everyone loved it, great flavor. Repacked the hollowed our shells with the blended mixture for reheating and serving, great presentation.

I made the recipe as stated. It was way too sweet! Next time I would add only a tenth of the sugar. Sweeten to Taste!
