This dish was simple and delish!  I didn't have a spiralizer, so I just cut the zucchini into strips about as thick as a noodle.  I also didn't have the nuts, but I don't think this negatively affected the dish, because it was still a very flavorful meal.

I made changes. Yes I will make it again. For the parmesan cheese  I used Nutritiinal Yeast Flakes and I  used spinach zucchini pasta and did not have a spiral maker for the zucchini so sliced them very thin although for the next time I am going to spiral the zucchini and lastly I passed on the redpepper flakes. I did drizzle the olive oil and topped with pine nuts too!

We added lovely soft mung bean sprouts and made our own basil pesto with fresh basil and a bit of parsley from the garden. YUM

Very good and easy when you get the zucchini spirals pre-made. We doubled the recipe and fed 6 people including teenagers. I will definitely make this dinner again!

This one's a keeper! I've never had pasta with green beans before, but I'm always looking for new ways to incorporate different veggies into my meals and this recipe jumped out at me. It comes together easily and quickly and is perfect for busy weeknights when you want dinner on the table fast. I made this exactly as written. Don't skip the pine nuts - they really make the flavors pop and naturally compliment the pesto. No need to make any changes to this one! YUM!

This recipe was absolutely delicious! I was skeptical of the use of green beans at first, but they were the perfect complement to the pesto sauce. We did not use any pine nuts due to a nut allergy, but it was still absolutely perfect. This is best for a light dinner on a summer night!

Yum!!!!! I made this exactly as written except for I added some chili flakes to the mixture and served the rest on the side so everyone could adjust their own heat (mainly because the kiddos can't do that much heat, but I'm working on them). I absolutely loved this one! If I had a lemon I would have loved adding some fresh lemon juice to this and I'll plan on doing that next time. A total keeper here, well done!

I was skeptical about the green beans in this recipe but we loved the combination of flavors. Unfortunately my little country grocery store  did not carry pine nuts so instead of making  the  20 mile trip into the big city I used sunflower seeds instead. Not the same but they worked nicely too. This is a great recipe and one that is sure to impress your friends. Five stars all the way!

I loved the combination of flavors in this, and this made for a quick, healthy and delicious Saturday lunch! I totally forgot the drizzle of olive oil at the end, as I couldn't wait to dig in!
