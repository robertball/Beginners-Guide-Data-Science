Added some shredded carrots & chopped broccoli. Didn’t have sesame seeds or oil. Was a bit salty for my taste. Will try again with the sesame & more veggies.

Perfect for my leftover rice and turkey. I even mixed in some leftover barley. Additions I made were shredded carrot, black beans, lime juice, topped it off with cilantro and shredded cheddar cheese. A little hot sauce jazzed it up.

I love how quick and easy this dish was. Clean up was minimal because it's basically a one dish meal. Both the sesame oil and seeds gave it a nice flavour but it still needed something else to make it memorable. I found it a bit bland.

This is a perfect salad for a hot summer’s day.  I used some leftover rice white I had on hand and sliced deli turkey that I julienned.  The rice had a tendency to drop to the bottom of the bowl when tossed, so keep that in mind when serving.  We thoroughly enjoyed this light and refreshing salad.
