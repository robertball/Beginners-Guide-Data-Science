These are tasty.  They'd be better with fresh bacon bits mixed into the cheese.  They're time-consuming to make, but disappear quickly from the table.

Pretty good. The boiling unfortunately took all the spice and flavor out of the jalapenos, so I would recommend against it, or at least only boiling them for a few minutes.

Please realize that when you boil jalapenos the steam creates a cloud of, basically, pepper spray.  If you are sensitive to it, which we discovered I am, it will run out of not only the kitchen, but the rest of the house too.  I will repeat this recipe, but not that step.  Also, a cookie press with a narrow tip makes filling the peppers with the cream cheese super simple!

These are the best! I just took them to a Mexican dinner my Sunday School class had, and they were a huge hit!

After reading the reviews I chose to not boil my peppers first and I'm glad that I didn't. By not boiling them it gave them a nice crunch and they stayed such a pretty bright green.  The only other change I made is that I added real bacon bits to the cream cheese mixture and that was a huge bonus. These were really good and would be just fine without the bacon too. My only recommendation is that you not boil the peppers or at least not more than a couple of minutes.
