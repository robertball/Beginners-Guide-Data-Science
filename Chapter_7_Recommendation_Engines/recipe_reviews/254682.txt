The parsley gets lost and this falls a little short but still better than any jarred sauce I've purchased. Amp up the herbs and seasonings and you've got yourself a 5 star all the way!

Easy, had all ingredients on hand. Threw a shake of Italian seasoning in it. Used whole milk, almost 2 cups as I needed it to be a bit thinner.  Turned out great, big thumbs up from this household!

This a wonderful recipe that shows lighter doesn't necessarily mean less tasty. I did substitute garlic powder for the minced garlic and I'm not sure I needed the 2 T of flour. It kind of made it lumpy. I'm sure my timing wasn't great as to when I added it. It tasted really wonderful! Plus it was without all the extra calories.

Worked well. Fast and easy. Less expensive than most traditional versions.
