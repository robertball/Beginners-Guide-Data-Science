It was good and defiantly healthy! I added more grapes and sneaked in some vanilla extract to make it sweeter for the kids. They loved it!

Very tasty drink, and refreshing!  Make sure your fruits and veggies are cold before you start bc a room temp veggie drink isn't as enjoyable. This came out kinda pulpy and I would have preferred something smoother (could be due to my blender or the fact that I normally juice my veggies instead of blending them), but the flavor is delicious. The grapes add the perfect amount of sweetness with just a hint of lime. A very healthy way to get broccoli in your diet!

Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe! I am what you could call a smoothie enthusiast and I'm always looking for great new ideas that incorporate a higher ratio of veggies. This one is definitely a winner! Made this just as written for my husband and I, but did not need to add any water, as cucumbers add enough liquid when using my Ninja Ultima blender. My husband just couldn't get passed the tartness of the lime and/or grapes, so I ended up drinking both glasses. Very filling, refreshing, and nutritious! Make sure to add some ice though! Thanks again for this recipe! I'd definitely make it again!

I would give it a four for flavor, it was pretty good with a few more grapes. However, the consistency was auful and I blended for a long...long...time. I think either you need an industrial blender or a juicer for this. This would be an amazing juice!

The texture was atrocious! I added a banana and that improved the texture a little. Super healthy, but broccoli just doesn't belong in a blender in my opinion.

I think this would be a perfect candidate for a mint leaves. Will try sometime soon.

Don't dismiss this recipe. I will have to say overall, this is the most palatable way to get a full serving of veges! The green grapes make it so.  I will defiantly be using this as a base for future smoothies.  Don't forget the lime, I added one wedge during blending.  I suspect pineapple might be another great addition. But I'm trying to get the veges... fruit smoothies are too easy and I don't want to change the goal here, but again, it just makes it tastier overall. Good recipe!
