Made as directed except only had 5 oz. ground beef so added 5 oz. of hot Italian sausage and cooked that with some chopped onion and red pepper.  Also added about half of a chopped fresh jalapeno since we like things hot, in addition to the chopped green chiles from the can.  Would have liked it layered better---in other words mix everything but the meat, pour 1/2 into the pan, then all the meat, then the other half of the cornbread mixture. Also would have liked more jalapeno.

My family loved this! I doubled the recipe and made a minor tweak and a substitution. I used ground turkey instead of beef due to food allergies. I also used roasted Hatch chile that I had frozen from when they were in season (I used 3-4)instead of canned. We love Hatch green chile around here:) I used cheddar- jack cheese because that is what I had on hand but I added more than 4TB to the top. I used about a cup instead. 4Tb (the doubled amount) just did not look like enough.

I enjoyed this! I did modify and use ground sausage in lieu of beef and used pepper jack cheese, otherwise stayed true to the recipe. I'll make again but maybe add more cheese and sausage to help make it a bit more savory since the cornbread was somewhat sweet.

I love this recipe! I double the recipe, and I add a can 14 oz of Ranch-Style beans (drained) to the browned beef. Then I put the beef/beans in the bottom of the casserole dish. I mix everything else as the instructions say and layer that in top of the meat. Sooo yummy!

I made this for my boyfriend to take to work for a potluck.  I added chopped rotisserie chicken to it. The guys loved it so much he didn't even get any!
