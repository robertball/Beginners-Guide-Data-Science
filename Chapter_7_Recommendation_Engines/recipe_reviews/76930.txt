Superb dessert! It's a cake, custard & souffle all rolled into one. But don't expect it to look anything like  the picture. I think the pic got posted to the wrong recipe....there is no chocolate in this recipe. Although, now that I think about it, chocolate sauce would be nice on top instead of the orange marmalade sauce. Not that the orange marmalade sauce wasn't terrific, it was...just that chocolate & oranges go together so well. ;o) I cut the recipe in half & cooked it in two larger ramekins for 38 minutes, allowed them to cool a bit in the water bath, then turned them out onto antique china plates. Don't be too generous w/ the sauce...a little goes a long way. Thanks again Pam!

A very light (as in not heavy) pudding. I have no idea what instant flour is, so I used normal all-purpose flour with 1/2 tsp of baking powder. The batter is very liquidy, but not to worry, after you add the beaten egg whites, and cooks, it stiffens up nicely. The flavour is really mild. I didn't have any orange liqueur on hand and I was just trying out this recipe for a dinner we are having this sunday for some elderly people who wouldn't want anything too heavy, so I didn't make the sauce. The sauce (and I think an orange sauce, to bring out the flavour) is a must.And if you are looking for a mild flavoured, not too heavy dessert, this fits the bill. By the way, the photograph is definteily not of this pudding. There is no base and the pudding has more of soft spongy look as compared to the smooth, cheesecake texure. 
Edit : Made it for the party. Half through the cooking I found that I was out of lime juice, so I doubled the orange juice and reduced the quanity of milk by 1/4 cup (so as to keep the amount of liquid same). It turned out just fine - with more of an orange taste (earlier it was an orange - lemon citrusy taste)

I did this recipe all wrong but it turned out fine. First of all, make sure your eggs are at room temperature! I realized too late, and my whites just wouldn't turn into peaks, but I folded them in anyway. As well, instead of lemon juice I added more orange juice, and instead of "instant flour" I followed Chandycooks' advice and added 1/2 tsp baking powder to all-purpose flour. Then, since I didn't have ramekins, I baked the whole thing in a store-bought chocolate pie crust so it would end up looking at least a little like the (very misleading) picture. Mmm, chocolate + orange = delicious.

Very flavorful, but too light. I wanted something more substantial. The drizzle, however, is great. My husband thought he would like it on ice cream.

If you make the recipe true to what's listed above this is how they actually turn out. Not super hard more for the experimental Baker looking for something new. Light fluffy with a flanish consistency. Overall a recipe keeper!
