The first time I made this was for out of town visitors the end of this past July there were no left overs. I've made it twice since then. I use a whole pound of Farmer John thick sliced bacon it's just necessary as we love bacon. I mix half of it into the dish and rest in the topping. Yes Molly is right the fat/calorie police won't like it but when they come to my door I shoot 'em. The deliciousness squad on the other hand would love it.

This was super delicious! I only made a couple changes which was I used all cheddar cheese added red pepper flakes and black pepper to the sauce and instead of chopping the bacon I pulsed it in a food processor and mixed it with the panko to make "bacon breadcrumbs." Again this turned out super delicious and I would definitely make again. Thanks for sharing.

Recipe Group Selection: 10 September '11 Oh my..........this dish is delicious. The calorie/fat police are not going to like this one - but my husband and I LOVED it. I had to add 3 ounces of another shaped pasta because my penne was only a 13 oz. box. Other than that change I made as written. It was the first time I've used a shallot and panko bread crumbs. The texture is nice and creamy and loaded with flavor. Thanks rolo123 for sharing this one.

This recipe is fantastic. I took a previous rater's advice and increased the bacon to one pound and added more cheese and also some garlic powder. Also I added stirred in lightly 1/2 cup of white wine just before baking.

Amazingly delicious!:) a wonderful meal. for those that would like to try this dish and are put off by the nutrition information. there are ways to make it a bit less fattening by using lower fat substitutions. Use common sense and you can make it work. Having said that there is absolutely NOTHING wrong with enjoying this dish the way it's written. It's superb. I alter for my and my families taste and added a bit of fresh garlic and some basil (which I don't really care for - but the family does:)).

I made low fat! Use Shiratake noodles (penne) turkey bacon and greek yogurt. I am diabetic so this is now a favourite with low carbs and no pork. Bravo!

This is absolutely delicious! I made it for my husband tonight and we both loved it. Thank you so much! For those who are worried about the calorie/fat content you might try doing what I did: 1) Use milk instead of heavy cream (I used one cup of evaporated milk and the rest was regular skim milk) 2) Use turkey bacon instead of regular bacon: when it's crumbled up like this it really has the same bacon taste 3) Don't add the bacon drippings back in 4) You could also use light cheese if you want but as a cheesaholic I went for the good stuff.:)

This was pretty good. I would definitely not give it the amazing reviews that is seems to be getting though. If I make it again I would definitely cut back on the garlic. Maybe my garlic cloves were just really big but the garlic was overwhelming. I would also add the whole pound of bacon and maybe some chicken as well. I liked the idea of the bread crumbs though. That tasted good. EDIT: I am editing this review and lowering my star rating because it is HORRIBLE left over! I made it for my boyfriend the other night and we didn't eat it all. I literally threw all the leftovers away because when you reheat them they end up sitting in a huge puddle of grease! Totally inedible and DISGUSTING!! If you don't eat it all in one sitting forget about it!

For all the general unhealthiness of this dish I expected it would taste amazing (don't most unhealthy things taste delicious?) but it was BLAND! All I could taste was the heavy cream. It tasted no better than a cheap box of mac n' cheese but took a tremendous amount of work.

Made this for Thanksgiving instead of my normal mac and cheese dish and it was great!! Husband and the kids loved it. I cut down on the olive oil and did not use the bacon grease since there seemed to be enough oil already considering all the cheese used. I mixed the bacon in the cheese mixture instead of on top with the bread crumbs. This is really good. The cream for it is pretty expensive but i will make again!

I cannot believe the amount of FAT in this dish. I wasn't even aware until I looked at my plate! I was able to soak up 3 paper towels of grease from one serving. Cook Beware if you have ANY heart or fat problems!

I had high hopes for this....ingredients were all good but I was really disappointed with the results. I made it as directed but it turned out not creamy at all and somewhat dried out. I didn't overbake it sooooo won't try again.

This was so easy to make and tasted great! We had it for dinner last night and a couple of friends stopped by who tried it and loved it as well. My Boyfriend decided he wanted more before we went to bed and decided that he liked it cold best! So Although it doesn't reheat great try it cold!

I have other recipes for mac and cheese that I prefer. I would say it's just ok.... nothing special. My kids did not like the bread crumbs at all. When reheated it is so oily that it is really unappetizing. We threw away the rest of the leftovers.

This was a lot of work for a mac-n-cheese dish. Don't believe the "15 min. prep time". It took a lot longer than that to cook/saute/chop/slice/& mix everything before it even went into the oven. But it WAS very yummy. I'd definitely fix it again - but only for company or special occasions.

Delicious! We had company over and I made this grilled some chicken breasts salad and garlic bread. This dish is so amazing they couldn't stop talking about it and grilling chicken breasts are a great compliment. I made the recipe as written except I added a little more cream and I made my own bread crumbs.

I'm rating this a 4 simply because with the amount of cheese called for in this recipe I was expecting a cheesy pasta dish and it turned out pretty dry. The cheese sauce kind of clumped together rather than a nice creamy consistency.... Maybe it has something to do with bacon grease? It still tasted great though and it was very flavorful with the onions and garlic.... But what wouldn't be great with bacon and P. Crumbs!!:)

After reading through the reviews I decided I would only make half the recipe since there is just two of us. After the mistakes I made halving it and the way it turned out I don't see how there is any way to goof this up. I did fine on everything until it came to the cheese and wound up using twice as much as I needed. I didn't have any shallots on hand so used onion instead and it worked fine. The reviews were right it does not reheat well. As far as Beckiboo who gave it a poor rating saying it was way too greasy and it was like eating a bowl of lard I would suggest she take cooking lessons and learn what she's supposed to be doing. Or at least learn how to read a recipe and follow directions.

Reheating dishes made with lots of cream is challenging. I recommend one of two processes. First cook very slowly in a pan over very low heat on the stove. I add a small amount of milk or cream. The slow heat is essential to keep the fat in the cream from separating. In the microwave do not heat cream or cheese based food on high heat. Put the pasta in a microwave safe bowl with a little milk or cream and microwave at power level 5 for about 30 seconds to soften it. Continue to microwave in 30 second segments stirring between segments to make sure that the fat isn't separating. Do not over heat--overheating seems to be the biggest problem of all.

Wow! This was delicious! My husband said he could have eaten all of this dish. My kids really liked it as well (4 children ranging from a 4-year-old to a 14- year-old). This is one of those recipes that has a sophisticated feeling but is not difficult to make. Will definitely be making this again.:)
