I was looking for something to do with a little bit of leftover Tahini paste I had from making hummus when I came upon this recipe!  Yummy salad and sandwich topper.  I used 2T Tahini since that is what I had, and about 2 tsp  Good S
Seasons Italian dressing mix,  I skipped the blender, and put in a mason jar and shook it up.  Wonderful, thanks for posting.

This was delicious. I think I have a new favorite dressing. I served it over a simple cucumber and tomato salad. The tahini isn't overly strong in this dressing it's just enough to give it an interesting in a good way flavor.

I too was looking for something to do with some Tahini Paste. Simple recipe and good ingredients however I wasn't to crazy about the taste. I like sesame but I'm guessing you gotta like the Tahini Paste to love the dressing.

Made several times as written. This recipe is great as is and only gets better in a day or two. Makes a tasty dip for grilled chicken , veggies or chips also. Going to start tinkering with other flavors (roasted red pepper or sun dried tomato).
