Ok.  This is my first review and I've been hesitant to place it because who am I to say...?  Anyway, I had to comment on this one.  If I'm going to use a recipe, I like to follow it exactly.  This endeavor is difficult when the recipe reads, "1/2 lemon, juiced".  I juiced half a lemon and, against my better judgement, added the full 3 + tablespoons it yeilded.  My dressing was then so watery and SOOO tangy, making a very runny and tart egg salad.  I guess I'm still confused why a recipe would call for so much lemon when it already calls for so much (vinegar-based) mayo.  That's a lot of acid!  I ended up adding 6 MORE eggs.  In the extra time I had cooking my second batch of eggs, I ended up adding 3 tablespoons FINELY diced red bell pepper for color and crunch as well as 1 stalk FINELY diced celery stalk, 1 clove of garlic, minced and 1 large basil leaf THINLY sliced.  In the end this made a DELICIOUS, not to mention cheap, lunch on whole wheat with baby spinach.  Thanks!

I was looking for a different kind of egg salad for lunch today. It wasn't until I got most of the salad together when I realized I didn't have any green onions. I ended up dicing a stalk of celery instead. The combination of the mustards and lemon juice was a nice touch. I want to try it with the green onions next time and the watercress.

Having never used or even heard of lemon juice in egg salad, I was curious enough to give it a try, but not adventurous enough to use the full amount. I probably used half what was called for and it proved to be enough to add a certain freshness but not so much as to be obviously noticeable. I loved the addition of the green onion, and thought the dill and celery I added were nice additions for flavor and crunch. This is a good, reliable egg salad recipe, certainly open to creative touches or additions.

I'm a dad running a business, taking care of a 6 & 8 year old, cleaning, laundry, cooking - the whole gamut.

I made this almost as is - took VERY little time to make, left out the green onions for the kids, took me very little time in my busy schedule.  My 8 year old was rolling her eyes back in her head as she ate hers, and talking about how wonderful it was!

I was looking for a simple lunch sandwich with ingredients I had available and this was it. Very simple but tasty. I did add to the recipe a bit by adding chopped water chestnuts and some red cabbage to give the sandwich some more texture. Served it on toasted wheat bread with a couple pieces of lettuce. Yum.

This is wonderful, easy egg salad.  Sometimes I replace the green onions with fresh chives.  It's delicious both ways.  We'll be having it in mini cream-puffs for an upcoming tea!

I used a quarter of a lemon - juice. and 8 eggs. I did add Cayenne pepper for a kick AMAZING EGG SALAD. PEOPLE DO NOT ADD HALF A LEMON JUICE THAT WILL KILL IT.

Good egg salad.   I used vidalia onions instead, and no lemon juice because I did not have it.  Good flavor.

This was really good...a perfect lunch for a warm spring day! I added 2 baby dills, diced & about 1/2 tsp. dried dill. The lemon juice gave it a nice crisp flavor and I liked that there wasn't too much mayo. Thanks Jen!

I used less lemon juice than what the recipe called for because it would have been too tangy for me to eat.  I also found the recipe to be a bit bland so I added paprika, red pepper, diced red bell peppers, and celery in to give it some crunchy texture.

I had never thought to add lemon juice to egg salad!  What a good idea.  Aside from tasting good, you don't need as much mayo as other recipes because the lemon juice thins out the dressing.  I halved this recipe and used light mayo, 1 t Dijon (no yellow mustard), 1/4 t onion powder (used the last of the green onion last night!), 1/4 t dill, 1/4 t pepper, 1/4 t salt and 1 T lemon juice.  It tasted good but next time I'm going to cut back the lemon juice to 1/2 T for half a recipe because it overwhelmed the egg flavor some.  I will definitely make it again though and hopefully next time I will have green onions on hand.  You could also try adding a little pickle juice or brine from green olives instead of lemon juice to make the mayo go a little farther and give it a flavor boost.

This was really good. One of my daughters loves egg salad and one hates it, so I tried this on them and now the one that hates it is on her second sandwich. I made a few additions, I added one stalk of minced celery for crunch and 1/4 of a yellow onion, because I had no green. I also added some dried dill. I think that just made it come alive, it really worked well with the lemon. One suggestion is to work step number 2 backwards, start with the eggs and add the other ingredients with the lemon and mayo being last so you can do it by eye and taste, because lemons come in different sizes and some produce more juice than others. So squeeze and taste, until it is perfect for you and it will not be runny that way. Side note: Someone suggested eating it with sprouts and avocado, I thought it sounded yummy and unfortunately it took away from the taste of the salad and was bland and blech! I threw it away and made a new sandwich which was awesome. So try this with just the bread first before making additions. Thanks, Jen for getting my 4 yr old to eat egg salad!

Based on other reviews I used less lemon juice - glad I did. This turned out just right. Next time I may play with a few herbs. I used the Golden Carrot Buns recipe to go with this. That was genius on my part. ;) Woot!

I made this recipe yesterday but i made some modifications. I nixed the lemon juice (it was just to far out there for me lol) I added celery & green peppers. This was my first time making egg salad and i was shocked with how good it tasted and almost tasted as good as the egg salad my mom use to make. Great recipe Thank you!!!

I added sweet pickles and sweet paprika but this recipe was very good! I'm trying to make egg salad like a cafteria in Houston (Cleburne's) and I think if I just add capers, I might get there! Thanks for the recipe!

Well I made as written and it just seemed to be missing something. I then added some dill relish and some dill weed and some paprika, then it was much better. Great on white Italian bread with a tomato and cilantro. Summertime is sandwich time.

This was very delicious!  I loved the tang of the Lemon juice but left out the yellow mustard.  I also used a bit of spanish onion as that was all I had but easy to adjust and still yummy.

I had a lot of eggs that I wanted to use up, so I was planning to double the recipe.  However, after doubling the dressing, I still didn't have enough for 12 eggs, so I ended up tripling the dressing to get enough for 12 eggs.  I didn't have a lemon, so I used 1 tsp lemon juice, and thought that gave it just enough zing.  I also added 1 chopped celery stalk to add some crunch.  Overall it has good flavor, and I'll be making this again.

I didn't put all 6 eggs as we like it a bit saucy. My husband adds tuna to it. He loves this recipe. We'll be making this a lot for his lunches. Great recipe.

This egg salad is amazing!! I usually buy egg salad from the supermarket, but I wasn't going to go all the way to the store just for egg salad.  I had most of the ingredients in my kitchen, so I thought I'd try this one out.  I've never seen an egg salad recipe with lemon and I didn't have one in my pantry, so I didn't use it.  I added a few splashes of Tapatio for some kick and a teaspoon of pickle juice for flavor.  I love it!!!!!!!   My only regret is that I don't have enough eggs to make more :(

I'm making for the second time now.  It is very good and has received rave reviews from family.  I just substituted chives for green onions because they are in my herb garden,and added chopped celery.   Thanks!

One of the best egg salads I've ever had! Was skeptical about the lemon juice but it really does work. Ate it with a few leaves of baby arugula on thickly-sliced wheat bread. Wonderful! Looking forward to trying it with avocado. Thanks!

Excellent - just like my Mom and Grandmother made. The only change I made was to substitute dill pickle juice for lemon juice, because that's what my Grandmother always did.

Scaled this down to 1 serving, so I estimated some of the measurements (for example, I used 2 eggs, and a splash of lemon juice). I also used spicy brown mustard instead of Dijon. But the end result was delicious.

Heavenly it is indeed!  I had been craving egg salad for a long time and what's a better way to use up all of those Easter eggs???  I didn't have Dijon mustard or a lemon on hand.  I substituted spicy brown mustard for the Dijon and 1.5 T of lemon juice for the fresh lemon.  I was a little worried about the spicy brown mustard, but all turned out just fine.  It was fantastic!!  I served on toasted wheat bread with lettuce and had kettle chips and fresh fruit on the side.  Next time I will be doubling or tripling the recipe!  MMMM  MMMM MMMM

I didn't have dijion mustard so I used reg. yellow mustard and I didn't have lemon juice so I used a tsp. of white vinegar to add the tartness (which the mustard does also.)  I also added 1 tsp. dill relish well drained and 1 tsp. well drained sweet relish. Then I used chopped chives to add color, texture and wonderful taste!  I think this recipe is a great base but really needs 'punched' up! :)   I also think 1/2 lemon juiced is going to be too much liquid and make it runny as some people have stated.  If you can use fresh ground black pepper do so, it really makes it great as an ending flavor.  Enjoy. MM

A great base for egg salad but I personally prefer a little more variety in texture.  Easily fixed with a tiny bit of pickle relish and some finely chopped celery.  No lemon on hand but a splash of apple cider vinegar did the trick!

This is my new egg salad recipe!!!  I finally decided to look up a recipe because my version of dumping whatever I had in the fridge into a bowl never seemed to taste good!  The lemon juice makes this soooo good!:) I scooped it into a celery stick and ate it that way.... YUM

Nice! I really loved the freshness of the lemon juice (I used 2 tbsp. juice,). I'm funny about raw onion in salads and didn't have an green onions on hand, so I used 1 1/2 tablespoons of very finely minced sweet onion. Delicous on whole wheat bread.

Didn't change a thing about this recipe, and got rave reviews! It was nice and creamy. Sometimes egg salad can be very dry, but this was just right!  Also, I wasn't sure if I should just chop the whites, and mix the yolks with the wet ingredients (kind of how you make deviled egg filling), but was advised to chop ALL of the egg together.  Glad I did, the egg salad really came out just right.

I just want to say, I had a taste for egg and olive salad so I used this recipe and added chopped green olives (the kind that are stuffed with pimentos). I also only had about a teaspoon of lemon, used Duke's light mayo, and left out the green onions ( I didn't have any on hand)- OH MY GOD! I could eat this everyday for the rest of my life. I put it on some toasted challah bread. Wonderful.

I just made this for the first time...having never made egg salad before. I didn't have Dijon mustard on hand, so I just substituted it for more yellow mustard, and I didn't have green onions or a lemon. Instead, I just about a teaspoon of bottled lemon juice. Even with having to make these substitutions, this egg salad was incredible! I will make it again and again. To make it a bit healthier, I used olive oil mayo rather than the regular stuff.

Like other reviewers I did far less lemon juice - i added just a splash.  I added celery for crunch and a tablespoon of Miracle Whip for zip - along with the mayo, just less regular mayo.  Pretty good recipie, wish I had some watercress on hand, sounds like a yummy addition.

Having never had egg salad sandwiches before, I cannot compare this recipe to anything else, but can say that I enjoyed it.  I added maybe 1/2 tsp more of the mustard, used pickle juice instead of lemon juice since that is what we had on hand, and I don't care for onions so I omitted them.  I would definitely make this egg salad again though - again with a smidge more mustard and with the pickle juice.  Thanks for sharing!

This recipe is easy and does not need any salt to taste good.  Maybe it is because I use very little salt to begin with. I used  no salt  at all, but lots of pepper!

I modified it a bit - I don't like dijon mustard so I substituted a little over 1 tsp regular yellow mustard.  Didn't have any green onions, so left them out.  Otherwise followed the recipe.  Very, very good.  Just the right proportions.  Thanks for a yummy recipe!

This is a nice change from the regular egg salad sandwich. The mustard added a nice tang, as did the lemon juice, but I only put a little lemon juice per my taste. I also had a little dill weed and celery that I chopped up and added along with the green onion. Sprinkled with a little paprika and served as sandwiches and with potato chips. I like this recipe much better than my own!

This is the best egg salad i have ever tasted. I never normally eat egg salad but since the granparents were over i decided to make this and (of course) tried it. as soon as i tried it, i fell in love with it. GOOD JOB JEN! i rated this five stars for the thought of using lemon juice made it spectacular!

This recipe for egg salad was pretty good.  It seemed to be missing something though; maybe because I used red onion instead of green and light mayo instead of regular.  I will make again for myself as it is low in weight watchers points.

I LOVE this recipe!!  I make it all the time.  I use a splash of lemon juice and add in peppers (whatever color I happen to have in the fridge), and some dill.  So good.

I had never had egg salad before because I thought it looked icky when I was a child. Now that I've grown up (somewhat lol) I decided I would try it because my tastes have changed and I love eggs and mustard now. This was SO YUMMY! I have also been craving pickles lately so I decided to dice up some kosher dill pickles and add those to the mixture. It added just the right amount of saltiness and tanginess that I didn't even need to add any extra salt. I also didn't have any fresh lemons on hand so I just added a few squirts of lemon juice from a bottle. Highly recommend this recipe, I will never try a different one!

Made this for sandwiches for hubby for dinner tonight, and he loved it! I tasted it while I was mixing it up and thought it was really good too! Made exactly as written, except for scaling the recipe down and just using the lemon juice to taste. This was so simple, and one I would make again! Thanks for sharing. :)

Excellent recipe - I really like the hint of lemon in this.  Used my very favorite dijon mustard from Trader Joe's and used celery salt when seasoning.

This is a really good egg salad. I used all egg whites so I boiled 8 eggs. I did not care for the watercress with the egg salad, but the other proportions were fantastic!

This is a great egg salad. I needed to add a few more eggs (I hate a runny egg salad), and a touch more mustard. I also stirred in a tiny bit of relish.

I am not an egg salad eatter, however my husband simply cannot get enough of this stuff! I love egg salad because it's easy to make and you can make a huge batch early in the week and eat it for breakfast on a bagel, on crackers for a snack, or on bread for a sandwich. This is my new go-to egg salad recipe---HE LOVED IT! Only thing is next time I may not use as much Mayo, but that's just for his taste buds. Thanks for the great recipe!

UPDATE: I have a lot of egg salad recipes that I have saved in my inbox, but none fo them seemed to have peaked my interest. This is the one I came back to and that I'm craving for right now! This the only egg salad that I will make from now on. Definitely the best egg salad recipe on this site. OLD REVIEW: The lemon gives a nice refreshing zest to the egg salad, but like many others, I didn't add all the lemon called for in the recipe. I cut about a 1/4 of a lemon which gave me 1-2 tsp of juice. I found it to be plenty for my taste and the dressing wasn't so runny. I used 6 small eggs and it was the right ratio to the dressing. If you decide use the juice of half a lemon, then I recommend that you use large or extra-large eggs for an nice balance. One thing to note that is not mentioned in the recipe, is to run the boiled eggs under cold water several times and/or leaving them in a cold bath for a few minutes, to make it easier to peel (without taking any of the white egg attached to the shell). This is a yummy recipe and I would definitely make it again. The recipe as written seems enough for 2 hungry people, but I would suggest doubling it for a family (only if using small eggs like I did). Thanks for sharing your recipe, Jen!

Awesome- thanks! I did not have dijon mustard handy, so I used honey mustard salad dressing and it turned out great. I also didn't have a lemon at home so I had to leave that out. I took other peoples suggestions and added peppers and celery.

Delicious.  Only thing I changed was adding 1/4 cup chopped celery for crunch.
Edit - I keep making this again and again. You can tweak and add other veg, and once I added a bit of sweet relish. Always good!

I don't know what happened. I followed the directions to the letter, and the yolks refused to solidify with the rest of the egg. Fresh ones, too.

I don't think I've ever had egg salad before, so I don't know what it is supposed to taste like. But I'm now a convert -- this was delicious. I was cautious about adding the lemon juice after reading other reviews, but ended up using all the juice from half a lemon as called for in the recipe. I don't see what the problem is. I didn't have any green onions, but I added a little diced red pepper, which was very good. I don't think I would have liked this as much without the added crunch and flavor pop of the peppers. A little diced pickle would probably push this over the top for me. Yum.

Hubby approved.  Enjoyed the green onion, lemon and mustards. I liked the fact that there was little mayo in this recipe.  I used low fat mayo made with olive oil instead of regular mayo. Great way to use up those beautiful colored eggs!

I never looked for a recipe for egg salad! I have always done what my mom and mil did.  So when I came across this today, thought I would try it.  I was very pleased! The lemon does something unique to the flavor.  I just did a squeeze, then tasted and then added just a bit more. Did not use 1/2 of the lemon. I am glad I tasted it before adding the entire amount called for. Perhaps some would like it w/ more, but I thought it was perfect w/ just a hint. Loved the addition of the green onion, too.  Egg-cellent!!

This is awesome - I love the onions in it as well as the lemon juice.  However, cut way way back on the lemon juice, otherwise you'll end up with a very watery slop.

Really good and a step up from your normal egg salad recipe. Followed exactly except that I did add some celery and paprika (didn't use green onions, just regular ones). I will definitely make this again!

This was so delicious!  My husband is a picky eater, especially when it comes to using eggs as the main ingredient.  He gave me the biggest complement - he said it tastes like his grandmother's and hadn't tasted egg salad this good since she made it for him before she passed away years ago.  I made a double batch so that he'll have more to take for his work lunch.  A great way to use up Easter eggs... A MUST TRY!  Thanks for sharing, luckyjen7 ;)

This was just heavenly egg salad. I used miracle whip instead of mayo and 1 Tbsp of lemon juice. I will make again and again.

I made this a week ago for lunch for myself, converting to 1 serving and using 2 eggs, and since then I've made it almost everyday. The second time I made it I added some Franks Hot Sauce and it was wonderful! The best egg salad I've ever had.

This was just what i was looking for. Simple and I had everything on hand.  The lemon added a touch of brightness.  I did add a little diced celery for a bit more crunch, but the flavor was wonderful!

Seriously delicious. Don't skip the lemon juice because it really makes the salad. I wasn't a fan of egg salad based on previous experience but I can't wait to dig into this later. I didn't have dijon mustard so I gave regular. Thanks for the recipe.

Excellent I did up it to 12 servings to feed a crowd I didnt change anything and it was perfect. I served it on toast with leaf lettuce, tomato, avacado and stackers dill pickles. My mother in law asked for the recipe and my houseguest who swore he didnt eat egg salad had a couple sandwiches. I think it would be good with a little rooster sauce too. 5 stars.

Super egg salad.  I left out the green onions (although I'd love them!) for my kids.  We ate it on warm French bread with lettuce, avocado and tomato.  Side of tomato basil soup.  Great and quick dinner.  I just eye balled the lemon juice until the consistency was about right.

I used all regular yellow mustard because I am not a big fan of dijon mustard. I loved the addition of using lemon juice in this. It added such a nice, bright flavor! This recipe can easily be customized to suite anyone's taste. I made it according to the recipe, tasted it then decided to add black pepper, dill weed, celery seed and a little bit of dill relish. This is SO yummy and I will make it many times in the future since DH is such an egg salad fan. Thank you for sharing!

Nice and tangy!  We have chickens, and thus a lot of eggs, so I'm always looking for new ways to make egg salad.

This is the egg salad recipe I have been searching for.  So easy yet so delicious!  I did make a few substitutions such as Zatarain's creole mustard for the dijon and yellow mustards and light mayo instead of regular.  I also added a few tbsp of diced celery and some dried dill, as suggested by another reviewer.  The lemon juice was about 1.5 to 2 tsp.  Perfect.  It will be gobbbled up quickly.

A really great foundational recipe. The proportions are exactly on.  I used the exact amounts called for in the recipe, and it came out perfect. I got about a 1/4 cup of lemon juice from my 1/2 lemon, and I was scared it would be too much, but it was perfect! It cuts the creaminess of the mayo, and you don't really taste the lemon, but it brightens everything up.   I had to boil my eggs a little longer, but I live at high altitude, so maybe that has something to do with it. Would be amazing with green olives or capers. Great on crackers, toast, a piece of lettuce, and delicious stuffed in a  fresh tomato! I added about 3/4 tsp of salt and a 1/4 tsp of pepper and it seemed right for what I needed it to be. Just a perfect springboarding recipe as the dressing is right on. Refrigerating for an hour or two really helps it come together and mellow out too. I would definitely recommend that. Delicious!

The flavors in this recipe are great-- I love the lightness the citrus adds to the salad.  I'm not a huge fan of really creamy salads though, so I cut the mayo down to 3 T.  Per others' suggestions, I cut down the lemon juice too (I actually used lime, but it turned out great!)- about 1-1/2 T.  I added 1/4 cup finely diced green bell pepper, and 1 finely diced clove of garlic.  If you throw the garlic in the lemon juice, it takes the bite out of the garlic, which is nice.  I definitely want to try this again-- maybe I'll use the dressing on chicken, and add some curry and raisins.

Great recipe. The extra acid from the fresh lemon juice cuts nicely through the oil of the mayo and the creaminess of the eggs.  Green onions, parsley, dill are all nice additions.

Very good, easy recipe. The egg salad itself is great, but paired with avocado on wheat bread its excellent. My grocery store didn't have any decent watercress so I used arugula and it was really good.

This recipe was very good! I took the advice of others and only added about half the lemon juice, which was a good choice. Didn't have any Dijon so I used all yellow mustard and it was still yummy!

Best egg salad I've ever had, hands down. I stuck extremely close to the original recipe only adding a tiny bit of honey to yellow mustard because I didn't have Dijon.

Pretty good.  The lemon juice adds a nice tang but not necessarily what everyone might like.  For large groups I think I would decrease the lemon juice.  Also consider adding some dill.

This tastes like potato salad, sans potatoes. It is really good. I didn't use prepared mustard, just dijon, and just a few squeezes of lemon. This would be GREAT as potato salad also. DEELISHUS

This recipe surprised me. It's an adult take on a childhood favorite that's brightened up beautifully. I raved about it for days and can't wait to make it again. I had it with a Reisling and even I was surprised that wine could go well with an egg salad sandwich!

I love egg salad and this is the best egg salad I've ever had! The lemon juice (always eyeball it so you don't over-do it) adds just the right amount of tang and livens up the flavor! The green onions are a great addition. Won't make egg salad without them again! Thanks for the great recipe!

I have never had egg salad with lemon juice before today, but it will be in my egg salad from now on! The lemon juice added a nice, bright flavor to the salad. I skipped the yellow mustard and made the dijon a heaped tsp. and added celery. I was a bit skeptical about the lemon juice but added about a tbsp; I am glad I tried it. Thanks for the recipe!

This was wonderful!  I've been trying for ages to find a good egg salad recipe that doesn't include dill, and this fit the bill perfectly.  The only change I made was to add some chopped celery and to mash the eggs with a potato masher before stirring in the other ingredients.  Quick, easy, and a permanent addition to our recipe rotation.  Thanks!!!

This could possibly be the best egg salad I've ever eaten! I normally only make my egg salad the boring way with just mayo and sugar/vinegar , but I wanted to try something with a little more "oomph" and this was definately it!! I omitted the regular mustard and substituted red onions for the green onions, and added a little pinch of sugar for sweetness.  Instead of chopping up the eggs and stirring into the mayo/mustard mix, I used a potato masher to mix it all up together at once, which gives the salad a very creamy consistency.. I will be using this as my go to recipe for egg salad from now on. Thanks Jen!

My go to egg salad now! I usually add a stalk of finely chopped celery for crunch. If I don't have any green onion on hand a bit of diced sweet onion or shallot works as well.  I LOVE that the lemon juice gives you a nice moist egg salad w/out having to use gobs of mayo. I usually end up using even less than the 1/4c of mayo.  Deliious!

This was very "meh".  First of all, that cooking method for hard boiled eggs never works for me.  I even boiled the eggs for 5 minutes before removing them from the heat and the yolks were still bright yellow and yucky.  The lemon juice was weird and the overall taste was barely mediocre.

YUM!!!!! My neighborhood deli makes this awesome egg salad sandwich that I have been obsessed with for years. This is the first egg salad recipe I have made that tastes just like it! The only changes I made were omitting the lemon juice (the tang of the dijon was just right for me) and adding finely chopped celery to it. Soooooo stinkin good! Thank you Jen!

I know I'm going out on a limb, but my husband and I did not enjoy the egg salad.  We found it bland and didn't think the mustard was the best mix with the eggs.  Maybe if I had followed some of the other suggestions (e.g. dill) it would have been tastier.

Yummy, yummy in my tummy! This was very good with the dill! I love dill and have never thought to put it in my egg salad.  I prefered to add a little garlic salt (1/4 tsp) just for extra flavor.  Turned out great!

Don't add too much lemon juice!  Start with no more than 1T, then taste and add more only if you want.  
I used finely chopped red onion because we didn't have green onions.  Served on lightly toasted whole wheat bread with a tomato slice and mixed greens.

I decided to make this one afternoon and followed the recipe exactly, except I used 8 eggs. It is a great egg salad, but I thought it was a little TOO runny. It did not want to hold together and kept falling off the bread. Fabulous flavor.

THIS IS A PRETTY GOOD RECIPE....AS A RULE, I DON'T LIKE EGG SALAD, BUT FOUND MYSELF WITH SOME HB EGGS AND DIDN'T WANT TO WASTE THEM.   I ADDED 1/2 TSP OF DILL AND A PINCH OF CAYENNE.

I love egg salad, yet I don't eat it much at all. I doubled the recipe and I thought it was a bit on the sour side for me. I think if you don't like it sour, you might be able to substitute Miracle Whip for the mayonaise, or add some sweet relish or something. Great recipe otherwise.

This was really good. I went easy on the lemon juice, just added it slowly. Gave it a bit of brightness but I didn't taste the lemon. Added some diced celery, red onion and some dill. Great recipe thanks!

We loved this fresh tasting egg salad! I wanted to do a bigger batch so I doubled everything except the lemon juice, kept that at half a lemon. I did add a stalk of celery finely diced for a little crunch, perfect, I like how the lemon makes it a little 'spritzy'. For those who don't enjoy lemon, choose another recipe!

Perfect recipe for classic egg salad sandwiches.  What I did add was a bit of jalapeno and substituted some spicy honey mustard for the Dijon mustard to give the traditional recipe a little kick. I left out the lemon since I didn't have one around, but it still tasted great!

Very good egg salad.  I followed the recipe to a t.  I have now put it in the fridge to get the flavors to gel a little bit.  I love the hint of lemon in it.  My lemon was huge so I used a half of a half and it was the perfect amount probably 1.5 tablespoons total.  Thanks for sharing.

Meh... Nothing terribly special about this. I had to add seasonings to jazz it up a bit. It was a bit too eggy and a too tart for our preferences and needed something else for more texture. I added chopped celery and very finely shredded carrot for flavor, sweetness and crunch. I'll keep looking for the perfect egg salad.

This was good, we made it for 2 though and next time I would make more of the sauce to coat the eggs. Loved the lemon, loved the dijon, and green onions are awesome additions!

Just okay. I prefer more flavor and will probably try a recipe with more spices next time. I did like the green onions in it and will repeat that, especially as I don't care for celery in salads and it makes a nice alternative.

I did not follow the measurements here, just used the recipe list as a guideline of ingredients, and the egg salad was delicious.  We had sliced avocados, and sliced tomatoes with it, and served it with creme of mushroom soup.  Used mayo made of olive oil, and dijionaiise mustard, to make it a little healthier.  Delicious!

I'm only giving this three stars due to the fact that I followed the recipe exactly, and my eggs were underdone and fell to pieces when I tried to peel them. The ingredients are lovely and very tasty for a classic egg salad, but in the future I will stick to boiling the eggs the way I learned from Joy of Cooking.

This was good, but not fantastic. Even with only using a tsp. of lemon juice, I thought it was a little too runny. I did add chopped sweet red peppers, a little dill, and celery seed since I didn't have any celery to use in it. Next time I will make sure to have fresh celery on hand and maybe a few more eggs so it's not so runny.

Great tasting and simple. We have 10 chickens so we get a lot of eggs and this is an easy way to use them up. I was short on time so I just sprinkled in about 1/4 tsp. dried onion, didn't have any dijon so I added 1/4 tsp. dried mustard and used lemon juice just to taste. All three children ages 2-6 loved it.

I followed the recipe to a "T" and found that it was way to runny.  I had to increase the eggs by adding 3 more to it just to absorb more of the liquid.  I don't think putting half a lemon in there was needed for 6 eggs.  Next time I will use 2 tablespoons of the lemon juice.  Other than that it is very tasty.

this egg salad is awesome!!! I'm always hoping for egg salad that tastes as good as it looks and this one does! The lemon juice really gives it a tangy flavor and brings out the best in the eggs and onions. I had it on a slice of peasant bread with more green onions on top. Next time I'll try it with lettuce or watercress as suggested.

VERY fresh, Can't tell there is lemon in it but it gives it a nice clean taste. I always doctor anything I make and usually do not follow a recipe completely but thought I would try. LOVE the dijon and lemon. Thanks!!

SO yummy! The lemon juice really brightens the flavor. Added a little diced celery for crunch, and it was a delicious lunch!

very good!  I added a couple of capers, without the brine, that I smashed and chopped really fine.  It added these gorgeous green flecks and a great salty bite.  Instead of green onions, I grated in two small shallots and half a cube of lemon juice I had freshly squeezed and frozen.  I paired this with some pan roasted asparagus that I cut to fit a couple of slices of toasted white bread.  The creaminess of the salad complimented the earthy asparagus so perfectly!  I was tempted to have another sandwich, but held back.  Great salad!

Really good recipe.  I'm keeping it.  Used 1/2 real mayo and 1/2 Miracle Whip.  Hard boiled the eggs my regular way, rather than as recipe states.

Delicious.  Made this for my friend's baby shower.  Used a cookie cutter to make white bread into hearts and piled on the egg salad.  Everyone loved it.  My husband is also constantly requesting this recipe.  Thank you, Jen!!

I really liked this egg salad with a few minor adjustments.  Afraid that half of the juice from a normal sized lemon would be too much, I made the entire salad first and then added lemon juice slowly, tasting after each addition.  I did not end up adding anywhere near all of the juice from the lemon half.  I probably ended up using half of the suggested amount.  I didn't hardboil the eggs according to the directions, just boiled them for 10-12 minutes, they came out fine.  Then I mashed up the egg yolks and mixed with the rest of the dressing.  All in all this ended up being really good.  It's nice to have a somewhat healthier alternative to a normal egg salad.

Delicious egg salad. I think the lemon adds a wonderful taste, but makes it a little too runny. Next time I will try half lemon juice and half lemon rind to see how that works. Thanks!

I loved it.  We don't use dijon very often but I used spicy brown mustard, it turned out great and the specs of mustard really gave it some visual appeal as well.

I used all the ingredients, but added amounts to my personal taste.  It was good.  Put is on a sandwich with montery jack cheese and toasted it in the oven.  :)

Delish! I love the fresh lemon juice in this recipe. The cooking method for boiling the eggs doesn't work for me. I boil them for 8 minutes on a low boil, then stick in an ice bath while I mixed the other ingredients. Great on whole wheat bread. Will make again!

Very Good! After reading reviews from others decided to use only 1 T lemon juice which gave plenty of zip.  I didn't have any onion, but just bought fresh onion buns from our local Breadsmith's so I used them to get that onion flavor.  Yum!  Thank you for the great post!

My husband and I both felt there was too much lemon juice. He also felt the mustard was too strong. Some more mayonnaise and some Tony's Chachere seasoning fixed it for him.

I love egg salad - and after an endless amount of poultry as of late, I needed something different!!!!  This was good, and I very much liked the dijon mustard and lemon flavors that differed from my normal egg salad.  I did, like others, add in a finely chopped pickle (a spicy Zinger one for some kick) along with a stalk of celery.  I wish I had had some dill on hand...it would have been a great addition.  Many thanks - this is delicious (and the perfect way to cook a hard boiled egg - been doing it for years and it can't get any easier).

I have always made egg salad with mayonaise and apple cider vinegar, but my husband requested a recipe with mustard.  I think I might try it again but without the dijon mustard.  It was too much bite for me!

5/10 This recipe is good, but the flavors of the mustard and lemon juice do come through as well as I like. (It may depend on the size of your lemon.) I will make this again with more mustard and lemon juice.  I will also try some dill.

I liked the idea of the ingredients together, but there was a lot lacking in the flavor department on this one.  I don't think I'll make this again.

I did make a change.  I did not add dijon simply because i did not have any and I added onion only when i made my sandwich because my husband does not like onion.
Also when I made my sandwich, I put Miracle whip on the bread for that little tang I enjoy.

Flavor was good, but I agree with other reviews. Don’t use all of the lemon juice from half lemon. Very tart and soupy result. I had to eat my sandwich with a fork it was too messy to pick up.

Add paprika and pickle relish. As is comes out salty (like I like it) but needs pepper. Will try it with more mustard and hot sauce.

Delicious, and the lemon juice gives adds a nice freshness. I wanted to make this but just didn't have the green onions on hand. I added celery and dill, but I'm sure it will be that much better when I do have the green onions! Thanks for the good recipe.

This was beautiful. I was most nervous about the boiling time- I usually let my eggs spend 10 minutes or so under rapidly boiling water to make my hard-boiled eggs, so I was a bit unsure about the instructions here. This technique produces a very soft, bright yellow yolk that i'm not used to- it felt undercooked to me. But lo and behold, by the time everything got chopped up and combined, the salad tasted perfect.

I like to add a healthy pinch of paprika and a tiny amount of cayenne, but the salad is also great as is.

We loved it! I added celery, as was recommendation from others.  I think it will taste better after it stands in the refrigerator for the night.  We ate it right after making it and it was a bit warm.

I mostly followed the recipe- I just added a favorite spice of mine, toasted onion from Penzey's- my sample taste of this was great. I didn't have the green onion, so I used celery as others mentioned for crunch.

This was a big hit with our family. I never thought to mix different mustards.  I took the advice of a few other reviews and added less lemon as I wasn't completely sold on using it in the recipe. Less is always best since you can add more. Liked this so much I'm making it again tonight. Nothing fancy but very good on taste.

I loved this egg salad and it was such a hit! I didn't have any mayo so followed some other review advice and replaced with the same amount of plain hummus,, perfection!!! No one even noticed it was missing the mayo. It was the first item to go at my brunch party. I followed the instructions to cook for 12 servings but it was way too little. I would definitely recommend you increase the amount.

This is a very good recipe, been making a similar egg salad for years and it has always tasted great. This one tastes just as good, but has a fresher taste. My version I use 1/2 teaspoon Capers chopped in the food processor (strong flavor, so a little goes a long way), instead of onions, and since not always I have lemons or limes in my pantry I substitute with approx. 1-1/2 teaspoons of Cider Vinegar. If you don't have Dijon on hand, just use 1 teaspoon of Yellow Mustard. Haven't tried it in a sandwich with avocado, but will try soon.

Very solid recipe imo. Girl and I liked it quite a bit. Only thing I did different, was add less lemon juice than called for, and added about a tsp of smoked paprika.

I raise chickens so I'm always looking for good egg recipes and this was a very good one for egg salad.  Unlike some others, I thought the amount of lemon was perfect.  But, being a huge sushi fan, I replaced the Dijon mustard with wasabi (Japanese horseradish paste).  It added a nice kick and I served it on wheat bread with spinach leaves.  Delicious!

I made this for dinner to utilize our leftovers, so I had to change a few things to avoid a shopping trip.  First, I used lime instead of lemon.  I also used celery instead of green onions and Miracle Whip instead of mayonnaise.  It was delicious!  My husband said he could eat it for dinner every night for a year ;-)

I'm not a big egg salad person but this is pretty darn good. I thought half a lemon would be too much, but it wasn't overpowering - but I'd advise anyone using store bought juice to be careful as it's easy to use to much.

Excellent! I have been looking for a great egg salad recipe for a long time. The blend of flavors is fabulous. My husband who generally doesn't like anything with the word salad in it has asked me to make it again. Thanks Jen!

Good basic egg salad. I asked my guest if she liked it and she basically said, well, what's different? I didn't really have a good answer, which is why I say this is a good basic recipe.

This is a really good egg salad recipe.   I would have given it five stars but, as prepared, mine turned out a little runny--easy to correct with another egg or two.  You probably could also correct the runniness by eliminating the lemon juice but I thought that added something unique to it.  I also added a pinch of tarragon which provided another depth of flavor.  Overall, this dish was very fast to create and delicious.  Prepped everything while the eggs were cooking and it took maybe 20 minutes.

Great egg salad recipe...Didn't have onion, so I added sweet pickles instead.  That was the only change.  Will definitely make again!

This is the perfect egg salad! The only thing I did differently was to add a teaspoon of sweet pickle relish and just a squeeze of fresh lemon juice. Delicious! Can't wait to make it again.

This was absolutely sensational egg salad.  The Dijon and lemon balanced so well and kept the egg salad really light.  My only change was that I didn't have any green onions so was reduced to using 'normal' onions, but it was still delicious!  Served it on whole grain toast with some avocado - thoroughly enjoyable!

I've been craving this recipe since I saw it on Recipe of the Day. So good. I was afraid it would give it too much of a green onion taste but it turned out not to overpower the egg salad.

Sooo good!  The only thing I changed was to add a little dill and only used half of the egg yolks to save a few cals.  I love the slight tang of the lemon.  I was worried it would be lemon-y which I didn't think would taste good w/ eggs, but it isn't at all, just gives it a nice flavor.  Thank you!

This sounds delicious!  I will be making it tonight for the first time.  I will let you know.  PS  I LOVE dill, and will be adding that in as well. Thanks.  I just made it.  The mustard really makes this.  Another thing I added was chopped red onion.  Not only did it add color, but at the end, I sprinkled some over most of them, to make a nicer presentation. They were also mixed in.  Great deviled eggs!!

Good egg salad. Used mayo to taste, which, for me was 2-3 T and 2 green onions.  Ate with avocado and spinach on a whole wheat pita!

very tasty, I've made a dozen times now and I always use less mayo and majority of the time I use white onions (whatever I have on hand).

I liked this, but thought it had a little too much lemon juice and green onion.  I ended up doubling the other ingredients and adding it in so the lemon juice and green onion were less noticeable.  We liked it much better that way.

This was super-quick! I doubled the dijon and omitted the prepared mustard. Also used red onion (all I had). I agree that the lemon made the mixture more watery than the chunky, dry egg salad I'm used to, but I really, really like it. Great job, Jen.

Holy cow! I *love* this recipe. I used as-is, except that I used bottled lemon juice I had on hand (approximately 2 T). As soon as I finished making the first batch, I started a second... I knew the first one wouldn't be enough!

I grew up eating egg salad with sweet pickles and mayo (yum!), so I found this savory salad definitely different.  It was good, but we both thought it needed more wet ingredients.

Great recipe. I only used one type of mustard (Dijon) and added some dried dill. Paired with some pickles, it makes a great sandwich!

I was missing a few ingredients so I made the following substitutions: the juice of a whole (small) lime for the lemon, 1 1/2 teaspoons of Dijon mustard (no yellow), 1/8 cup red onion not green onion and a finely chopped celery stalk for some crunch. It tasted very good... maybe a little less mustard next time.

I really like this egg salad. The additon of the green onions was delicious. While my picky two-year old wouldn't even taste them, my one-year old couldn't get enough. My husband laughed because she had "onion breath" afterwards! :) He ate his fair share, as well.

I was looking for this recipe for years as I loved this egg salad sandwich at this restaurant that moved and I could never find a recipe until now.  I used 6 pickled eggs instead, substituded chopped celery for green onions and no lemon juice.  This egg salad is the BEST!!

This is awesome egg salad with 1 major change. I chop the whites but mix the yellows into the mayo/mustard combo as if I were making deviled eggs. You just can't beat it that way! YUM

This is my favorite egg salad recipe now! I always add a dash of garlic powder and sometimes a bit of relish or some chopped celery depending on my mood. A yummy and an inexpensive lunch or picnic item!

Rated 5 bc my boyfriend loves it so much. I did add some dill and pickle, and only used dijon mustard.

I actually came back in to change my review and rating.  I originally thought it was too "mustardy" but after it sat for about 12 hours, the flavors blended really nicely.  My husband thought it was the best egg salad I've ever made!  I still thought it needed a little something so I gave it 4 stars.  I leave out the scallions as well, I think the flavor of them overtakes the salad.

When I have a craving for a certain food, I make it & if it doesn't taste like I remember, what a disappointment. This was right on. Didn't have green onion so I used purple to taste. WOW!!! Will surely make again.
Thank you.

Lemon juice was too much and not needed.  Enough of the flavoring comes from the 2 types of mustard.  I added finely chopped celery and pickles to give it a little more substance.  You don't have to follow the recipe to the tee - you add as much mayo or mustard as you want and keep adding veggies until the desired consistency.  Good as a template recipe though.

I am not an egg salad fan, but this recipe made one out of me...I added some finely grated aged gouda, fresh cracked black pepper and 9 eggs...the 2nd time I made it I used 75% mayo and 25% sour cream.....it was amazing after a long field trip with the kids

this tastes delicious. i didn't have lemon juice so i didn't add it nor was i planning to. i think the lemon juice would make the egg salad taste a little acidic and sour tasting, but who am i to say that. i will make this recipe again and i am not planning on using lemon juice either. :)

I've made this twice.  The 1st time I discovered I didn't have any prepared yellow mustard so I used honey Dijon.  The taste seemed a little bland--perhaps because the honey Dijon doesn't have the same bite as yellow mustard.  The 2nd time I used yellow mustard as called for and there was a little more zip to the taste.  I'm going to keep this recipe but plan to try others.

very good.  It could use another egg, though, and some parsley or dill for extra flavor.

This was okay for me.  Nothing special.  Will probably keep looking.  Thanks for letting me try.
