I Found If You Bake On Greased Flat Cookie Sheet. That These Rolls Come Out Bigger And Better Looking. If There To Sweet Then Next Batch Omit 1/4 Cup Sugar. I Tryed With 3 Yeast Total Instead Of 2.5 And You Cant Beat The Results. Better Than Grandmas I Think

These were far too stiff.  I wondered if the recipe was incorrect.  Maybe it should have called for 
2 3/4 cup of water rather than 1 3/4?  Very dry and didn't rise well.

The rolls did not raise well, and while they tasted good, the texture was very thick and heavy.  They would probably be better with more yeast, and less flour.

I used 5 cups of flour initially and only had to add another 1/2 cup for the right consistancy.  A big hit!  They are delicious and everyone loved them.  I will use this recipe again and again.  This is a little more dense than some yeast rolls but that's what made it like G-ma's!  Mmm mmm.

I knew when I seen "lard" in the recipe it was a old recipe, so it had to be good.  My mom has been making these rolls as long as I can remember.  We have them every year at Thanksgiving.  Best rolls on the planet.

A good basic start for a yeast roll, seems to be a sweeter slightly more dense roll, but that it what I prefer.  Like another reviewer I needed a bit more fluid after the 6 1/2 cups of flour...I think I added about 1/4 cup more warm water but it did not seem to affect the recipe at all by adding at the end of mixing when I discovered a dry dough.  Rising time was closer to 60-70 minutes for doubling in size.  Baking time ended up about 35 minutes on a cookie sheet.  Easily makes 24 good size rolls.  Very happy overall and will use this recipe again, maybe trying to brush a bit of melted butter on the tops before baking.

I've never made yeast rolls before, so I read all of the reviews and followed their advice and my rolls came out DELICIOUS!  They created the best aroma in my kitchen...

I actually made them with 2 cups whole wheat flour and 3 1/2 cups white (which may be why they came out a little more dense than I was hoping, but many other reviewers said this was just a dense recipe...either way they made great dinner rolls). If you only use 5 1/2 cups of flour (which I recommend starting out with) you will have to add a little extra as you're kneading because it will be a little sticky for sure.  Turned out great and will be saving this recipe! Thanks Dotty and thank you reviewers for your insights!

Side note: I had a little extra dough than I needed so decided to try out the dough as cinnamon crescents, and they were very delicious!

I am not sure if I messed the recipe up or what.  First off, I overcooked them because it said to bake for about an hour.  I should have checked at the half hour mark.  That probably would have been long enough.  They were overdone - my fault for not checking but I think if it takes about a half hour to bake, it shouldn't say an hour on the recipe.

Even if they hadn't been overdone I don't think I would have liked them.  They were too dense and tasted more like biscuits to me.  I was really disappointed.  This was my first attempt at making yeast roll so maybe I need more practice but I am going to try another recipe.

Dough came out a bit dry, so I added a little more water to it.  Also it becomes more of a sweeter roll when baked.  I'll cut down the sugar next time.  I was happy how light and airy they baked up

Loved 'em! Cooked for only 45 minutes (temperamental oven issues) and added more sugar than called for due to sweet tooth. Leftovers made great "sandwich rolls" for turkey/cranberry sauce "sammies" :)  Did not rise as much as I had expected and were DENSE rolls.

I followed the recipe exactly as published.  I found the rolls to be tough and heavy.  I could have/should have used less flour than what was called for.  Tasted okay but nothing great.

I submitted this recipe, and after reading some of the less positive reviews, I read the directions and I see why, I NEVER add the entire amount of flour in the beginning. I start off with about  4 1/2 ( FOUR AND ONE HALF) to 5 (FIVE) cups of flour and add as needed,  six and a half cups is the MAXIMUM. Also, I have noticed cooking times, in my old oven these rolls took about one hour to cook, in my new oven the cook time is about 45 minutes. My suggestion is to start checking for doneness at about 45 minutes by looking for golden top color and thumping top of rolls, there should be a hollow sound. If you up are still unsure if they are done, towards the center of the pan pick two rolls and pull apart to look inside to be sure bread is cooked through. Another tip is if you don't have lard substitute bacon drippings, that works just as well, my daughter actually prefers them that way. When made correctly these rolls are light, fluffy and tender. I don't know if I mistakenly submitted this recipe that way or if it was changed by the editors as other submitters have suggested, either way it's wrong. It is so frustrating to put so much money and time into a recipe only to have it fail, I really hope these tips help to ensure you get the same success as I do when making these soft, flavorful rolls.

I’d never attempted rolls before but my sister who always handles the rolls was really tired from a busy day at work. These were for Easter dinner and while they were in now way as pretty as Dotty’s the taste was there for sure. The family raved about them. I will definitely make these again. I used my new Kitchenaid 600 pro and kneaded with the dough hook for 8 minutes. Love these.

I made no changes to the recipe and was severely disappointed. The recipe calls for way too much flour. I even added extra liquid to try and save it, but it was so stiff and dense.
