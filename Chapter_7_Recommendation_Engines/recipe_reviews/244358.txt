This is a fun recipe that I'll make again. I made one cone exactly as stated in the recipe. However, when I got to the bottom, I only had fruit left and no whipped topping. When I made one for my 5 year-old, I mixed the fruit and whipped topping together and then put it all in the cone. Then I dabbed on just a bit more topping before adding the sprinkles. She loved it. It makes a great after school treat. Thanks!
