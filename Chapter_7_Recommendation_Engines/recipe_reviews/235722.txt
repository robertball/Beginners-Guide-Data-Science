I made marscapone whipped cream instead of just regular whipped cream, and used mini konpeito (Japanese sugar candy) for the eyes.

I used the Reddi-wip whipped cream instead of whipping it up from heavy cream. It worked just as well, and my granddaughter helped me with the buttons and eyes. The kids loved them!

Loved it simple enough not to Sweet partially healthy. The only thing that I changed were the sprinkles for the eyes. I used candy balls and put them on with tweezers something else would probably be a better choice a little easier and quicker. Maybe the little balls of candy that look like silver?

The whipped cream started melting as I was assembling, so I gave them out to eat while I was making them. They ate them before I could make more. So they were delicious but not too pretty.

Very cute presentation. They went very fast at a dessert potluck. Had to keep them in the fridge until right before serving as the whipped cream began to get soft. Not too sweet at all. Used tweezers to stick the sprinkle eyeballs on.

Cute, but better eat them quickly.  Whipped cream doesnâ€™t stay fluffy for long and you will shortly have strawberries floating In cream.

Was going to give 3.5 stars. Easy enough to do, but make sure strawberries are sweet even to eat. Had a few sour ones. Yuk

If you don't want to fiddle with these use Cool Whip in a piping bag with a smaller type tip opening. Easier to layer precisely without that "blob" look and the two buttons on front then look 'perfectly' shaped.

Nice treat but mine looked more like red bears than miniature Santas. Although mine creation was ugly, they tasted good without getting the little ones all sugared up.

This recipe was a disaster. Mine looked like blobs.  Was very disappointed.   Strawberries were very expensive but I thought my grandkids would like these.

These are tasty (not too sweet) and easy to make. Just know that to get the cream going, mix at a high speed.
