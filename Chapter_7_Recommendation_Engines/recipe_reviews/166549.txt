What a classic! Okay, I live in Burgundy, France, the home of incredible wine and Creme de Cassis. This drink is absolutely incredible and extremely well-known and loved in this region of France. It is a very strong drink, and locals enjoy warning you about not drinking too much. Also be careful about putting too much Creme de Cassis in it or it will be too strong. In the beginning when I could not handle alcohol very well, a friend substituted the wine for water. It tasted great, though not quite as good as white wine. But was significantly less strong.

I really like this drink.  I teach French and have heard that the traditional way to prepare Kir is to take a bottle of Chablis, or other white wine, pour a glass for the person serving it, and then fill the bottle of wine back up with creme de cassis.  I haven't made it this way yet, but I think it sounds like it would be just about right!

What a lovely drink! My sister made this for me years ago when she returned from a summer in France. I never asked her how she prepared it so I was happy to see this recipe... thanks for the memories!

I think mixing this 50/50 would taste nasty to my taste buds! I add 1 to 1.5 TEASPOONS to a full glass of champayne. It's not too sweet and you can still taste the champayne. Stir well because cassis goes to the bottom. Best results when using an actual champayne glass (flute).

I love what Crème de cassis does for white wine and I have even used it with reds. Wines vary in sweetness or lack of depending on brand and type and the nice thing about adding Crème de cassis is you can do so to taste. Start with a little and adjust accordingly. Crème de cassis is a sweet, dark red syrupy liqueur made from blackcurrants. It's delicious and really does add a touch of "special sweetness" to white wine. As with most things look for a quality brand, Dijon France is known for its cassis production ... think of it like using imitation vanilla extract or 100% pure Madagascar vanilla extract.

My first encounter with this drink was in Paris.  It is a delightful treat every time I return to France.

Good drink! I don't usually like white wines, but red wines don't agree with me anymore. This is a nice compromise.

I made this with creme de Mur (blackberry). Delicious. Thank you.
