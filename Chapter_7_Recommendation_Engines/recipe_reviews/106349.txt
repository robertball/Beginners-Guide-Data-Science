YUMMY!  I used stew beef and took the advice from others and simmered it with vin & baking soda for two hours.  I also doubled the spices and threw in a bit of hot madras curray powder because I like it spicy.  Hubby LOVED it - no left overs.  Will be making again and again.  Thank you for this recipe!

this was very good and had a beautiful appearance with the greens, reds, and the yellow from the tumeric.  Adjusted the spices to taste, as written was a little on the soft side, but that is good for those that may not like things too spicy.  Used achar masala, so added green cardamom pods, and cinnamon stick.  Sauteed those w/the cloves in onions.  Added garlic near the end of the saute so it would not burn or get bitter.  Thanks for another nice Indian recipe!  I love your 'maharaja curry' also!  Served w/saffron basmati rice w/some green peas tossed in for more color and texture.  next time I will add a dollop of yogurt near the end for a little tang.  The lemon juice did not provide enough tang to the recipe.  It did not need any tart to thicken, as it was just a perfect consistency on its own.

This recipe was phenomenal.  I had all the spices on hand and used skirt steak.  Also used one full can of diced tomatoes, with green chili peppers.  The beef was tender and the aromatic spices gave just enough heat without making the dish too hot.  Served it over a natural whole grain brown rice.  Thank you so much!

Very, very good recipe.  I added extra spice and may try the other reviewers suggestion next time.  I like more heat, but the flavor blend was really nice.
I somehow managed to make the tenderloin a little chewy - not sure if this was not enough heat in browning or what, but the recipe was still very good.

Excellent.  I made it as written minus the peppers because I didn't have any.  I used 1/4 tsp red pepper flakes instead.  So, so good!  I also added some diced carrots just because I'm always trying to sneak more vegetables in our diet.  Thanks!

Tbis is a fantastic recipe. I was a little weary about adding coconut milk but it just added to the flavor of the dish. The only thing I changed was to cook the beef much longer than indicated, as it took me about an hour on med-high heat to finally make the meat tender. This is great with rice or indian roti/naan as well. All in all a great way to prepare spinach, yummmmm.

This is really good. I didn't change anything other than I used sirloin steak (leaner) and used 1/2 coconut juice and 1/2 lite coconut milk to cut down on calories and fat. I will make it again.

Warning.... my coconut milk curdled when I cooked it.... did a little reading and it seems anything with oil will do this... so maybe it was because I used regular butter instead of clarified butter?  I'm not sure, but this dish surely looks unappetizing like this.  Don't make my mistake!  :-(

I loved it! The serrano pepper was too spicy though. I am mexican and serrano is known to be a hot chile, unless you taste it you will never know. I put one whole serrano and it was too hot for my american husband and for me. So I took it out and simmered it with potatoes to soothe the hotness. Everything was great in this recipe. Thank you for sharing wonderful ideas!I doubled the tomatoes and the coconut curry too. And I loved it!!

Delicious!  I loved it.  I used 4 peppers because I like it hot.  It was just as good if not better than you might eat in an Indian restaurant.  Very easy to make.  I used Jasmine rice, which added to the flavor but did not compete with it.

a brilliant curry. I cooked it for much longer, probably about 2 hours and the meat was so full of flavour and just fell apart.  I also did not need to add the lemon juice and I completely forgot to add the spinach but that did not really matter.   I only had jalapeno peppers so used them instead. It will not blow your head off, it just has a lovely warmth to it.  It was a hit with my husband and all of my kids. Yum - thanks for the recipe.

I have made this curry twice now, once with beef and the second time with chicken.  My only change was to use frozen chopped spinach and cherry tomatoes.  There are never any leftovers.

Tenderloin is way too expensive for me to use in a dish like this.  I like mine grilled medium rare and served with a nice bearnaise sauce.  So I used cubed chuck roast and simmered it in water for 2 hours wth vinegar and baking soda as Mariam suggested, adding a couple bay leaves and some garlic just for the heck of it.  It was very tender. Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly except for throwing in a diced yellow summer squash with the tomatoes and spinach.  I tasted the dish when it was finiished and it seemed a bit dull; like it needed something.  So I added 1/2 tsp of Asian curry powder and a packet of Sazon and that did the trick I served it with a brown rice, coconut and raisin pilaf and DH said "Good stuff!"  Thanks so much for the recipe!

WOW this recipe was delicious! I could not find serano peppers in the store so I bought jamaican hot peppers. Ohh myy these were hot! Luckily I tested them whem I was chopping them. I just put one tiny pepper in. You have to be very careful what kind of peppers you use, because some are much hotter than others! I love spice, but these were burning. Even though I only had one, it was spicey enough. I used beef cubes for stew that I boiled in water with a bit of vinegar and ~1 tsp baking soda to help tenderize them. I let them simmer for 2 hours. The came out super tender. I followed the rest exactly and served rice cooked with some of the leftover coconut milk and onion. Yumm this was a amazing dish! The kids and I could not get enough. Thank you so much!

Thought this was very good.  I almost doubled the spice because I love the flavours, it was still a mild curry but really good.  Used stewing meat and simmered it for almost two hours and the meat was so good.  I forgot to include the spinach though.

This had terrific flavor - I also used a crockpot and after browning the meat (stew beef) in butter (did not use clarified) I just added everything into the pot without browning the onion first.  Cooked on low for 5 hours.  The only thing I would do differently next time is add the spinach in the last 10 minutes, rather than last hour, to retain the bright green color, but no one complained.  Also I served this with sherachi sauce on the table so everyone could get the heat they wanted.  Really good!

Great recipe! Made some small changes because I was missing some ingredients. Didn't have serrano peppers, so used 1 poblano. Added some cayenne pepper and tobasco to make up for the mild pepper. Used cut up chuck roast and simmered it a bit longer to tenderize it. Boyfriend loved it. Going to try it with chicken or lamb next time.

The spices in this is not quite enough... I had to add more of everything to make it stronger. I also added some cayenne pepper and curry powder to add some kick to this dish.

This was a really marvelous recipe.  I did use mustard greens, a bell pepper, coconut oil and juice/pulp of 1 lime in place of orig. ingred. (as that's what I had) and simmered the beef much longer (couple hrs) before adding the greens. Increased garlic to 3 T, used the whole can of coconut milk,  whole can of tomatoes  (I like the juice on the rice) and used 3.5 tsp homemade garam masala spice plus 1 tsp pepper flakes in place of original spices.  Also, served over rice with ground peanuts as well as yogurt.  I've been toying with adding some crunchy peanut butter though instead of the ground peanuts next time.

I made this and it is delicious, although on the second meal I added more spice and garam masala to give it some real kick.  I also added a little bit of tomato puree to give it a tangy sweetness.  Overall it is a delicious dish, but would perhaps better suit lamb.  I am going to do it with lamb next time and see how it comes out.

LOVED IT.  I probably doubled the spices, because we like spicy Indian food.  Sometimes my Indian cooking makes us cry (so hot) but doubling the spices made a nice heat.  I bought Rib Eye steaks and simmered them in soy sauce for 1.5hrs.  Then I removed the fat.  I also pureed all of the ingredients except the tomatoes and beef after cooking.  After adding the meat and tomatoes to the pan, I also added a can of chick peas and simmered for about 30 min.  The most amazing thing was the next day, this food tasted EXACTLY like restaurant quality.  Makes me think the buffet food is not fresh.    AWESOME!!   Thanks for the recipe.

This was so delicious! I couldn't find garam masala at our small grocery store, so I made my own mix per directions I found online. We only used one serrano pepper because it tasted so strong raw - later realized a lot of the heat gets more mild while cooking. We ate it over rice with a little Sriracha. A keeper!

I just loved this curry, but it was far too hot for my 2 sons.  The spices and flavors were simply wonderful, but be warned this is rather on the hot side.  If you don't like your curry hot it may be worth cutting down on the Serrano peppers.  I followed the recipe exactly as written.

This is a very good dish.  Our family liked it very much and I served it with Naan.  I had to buy a few of the spices at a India market and it was worth it.  We will make this again very soon.

This was great! I added a potato and substituted the serrano with ground cayenne, and diced tomatoes with tomato sauce due to what was on hand. Next time I'll try it in the slow cooker as we tend to eat pretty lean beef around here. Will definitely make again!

Well the dish is beautiful I would say but I think it lacks a strong flavor.  I'm guessing that's okay because my son is picky but I like it and its not a strong curry flavor.  I will make it again and try other things maybe a bit more of the ingredients.  I served it over jasman rice and cooked it in the crook pot.

Good flavor, meat ever so slightly tough. Substituted almond milk for coconut milk since I did not have any, added red pepper flakes and an entire teaspoon of chili powder. Will definitely make again. Love the way the spinach tasted with beef , sauce, and basmati  rice.

I loved...loved...loved it! I made a few adjustments, like using more spices than is in the recipe but all the same it turned out great, plus everyone at home was asking for more...I'm definitely making this again!

Nice flavors! I used 3 jalapeño peppers from the garden, and a dash of ground cloves instead of whole. Just a hair spicy for me, but I think DBF enjoyed it. Keeps well for several days.

Pretty good dish. I made a couple changes but the spirit was the same. I used stewing beef and rather than spinach I used yellow chard because that's what I had. I've had spinach in stew before and it cooks down so much. I like the heartiness of the chard in the mix. I also doubled the spice~personal preference. Stayed on simmer for 4 hours and the beef fell apart. Awesome. Thanks so much jane Gibraltar.

Make without Serrano peppers b/c I didn't have any - wasn't near hot enough (needed more seasoning).

Made this just as written, except I used stew beef and no peppers because I didn't have any and I was trying to make it more kid-friendly.  This was really good, although quite mild without the peppers (perfectly since the kids ate it).  When I make this again, which I certainly WILL make again, I will wait to add the spinach until I've simmered the meat to the perfect tenderness -the stew meat turned out a little chewy when only simmered for 20 mins.  Thanks for my first, homemade curry dish! It was a success!

Needs more spinach, less tomato, but is otherwise divine. I totally recommend using all fresh ingredients.

Our entire family liked this recipe..even the 3 and 1 year old! I used a flank steak b/c that's what I had, as well as using a can of diced tomatoes. We skipped the chili's too, and my husband just used some curry paste that we had to spice it up for him, so we all won out! Will definitely make again. Prepared with rice. I will try Naan next time like another user said.
