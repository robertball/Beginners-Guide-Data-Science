I modified it... I decided to try this recipe out as I liked all the ingredients, but I used chicken tenderloins and a saute pan to speed things up.  This recipe has a VERY large amount of soy sauce - really salty - for those who prefer less salt, I would recommend 1/8 c of soy sauce is more than enough.  Because the amount of liquid described was for baking, not sauteeing, I added cornstarch at the end to thicken the remaining juices into a sauce.  Also, adding mushrooms is not a bad idea.  Sounds like a lot of changes, I know, but I don't think the spirit of the recipe was changed.  Everybody liked it.

I followed the recipe exactly as I always do the first time I try any NEW recipe. I did marinate the chicken in the sauce for about an hour before I put it in the oven. The chicken just melted in your mouth and was very tasty. My husband wants this dish again and so do I!

The chicken came out great! I did, however; take the advice of another reviewer and marinated the chicken in the sauce for a while before cooking it. Still came out wonderful.

I made this with a couple modifications. I used red wine because it was all I had, I replaced vegetable oil with Canola because it is better for you, and I used low sodium soy sauce. Also I used boneless skinless chicken thighs because it was all I had. It came out SO good. My family ate all of it up and that never happens! After we took the chicken out I added some corn starch to the left over sauce to thicken it a bit and pour over the chicken and the rice we had with it. So good! Will def. make again.

Ok, I NEVER review or remark, but this dish has prompted me to do just that! I followed the directions to the letter (save substituting Olive Oil for regular vegetable). The results: exquisite. No knife needed, so tender and flavorful. What a simple, easy, and delicious recipe. Thank-you for posting!

I liked this recipe and did very little to change it.  I did use low sodium soy sauce and there was no issue with it being too salty.  My chicken was done in only one hour though and had I left it in the full time suggested it would have been like eating rubber bands so adjust your cook time accordingly!  Next time I will thicken the sauce into a gravy for serving.  I served it over egg noodles and would make this again with the above mentioned changes.

I changed a few things in this recipe by accident and I feel it turned out much better.  First, I cut the amount of soy sauce in half because that was all I had left and it was definitely still salty enough.  Half a cup would have been waaaaay too much.  Second, I added turmeric instead of ginger because I didn't have ginger.  I still really liked the flavor and not even sure what it would taste like with ginger.  The big thing to save time was cooking it on the stove instead.  First I slightly browned each side of the chicken breast in some oil in a pan that has a lid.  Only a few minutes is fine.  Then I added the sauce and covered and cooked on low for 25 minutes, turning once half way through.  Last, after removing the chicken I added some cornstarch mixed in cold water to thicken the sauce.  Never add cornstarch powder directly to hot sauce or it will clump together.  Spoon the sauce over chicken.  Still comes out tasty and moist in a quarter of the time!

Very unimpressed.  I did everything the recipe said, but it was flavorless and boring.

The chicken came out very moist!  I didn't change any of the ingredients, I just marinated for 3 hours prior to cooking.  I used what was left of the juice and made gravy.  Very tasty!

I made this as it, except I used low sodium soy sauce.  (I also used Canola oil but I honestly don't consider that a "change.")  It was pretty good, but there were a couple of issues.  Perhaps a bit too much vinegar.  Mine was also done in under an hour and I just can't see cooking it 1.5 hours, and I also don't think 165 degrees is high enough for chicken.  It's pretty liquidy in the oven as well, I suspect cause the lid's on.  (The up side of that is the chicken staying moist.)  So I did attempt to thicken that up in a pan after.  Tried this with rice and I don't think it matches very well.. oh well.  And it didn't reheat very well.

Really easy and incredibly satisfying. Tender, if you marinate it first. Lots of au jus to play with afterwards.

This recipe is so-so.  The soy sauce is the predominate flavor (so a little boring) but when served hot, the chicken isn't too dry.

Like others I used chicken thighs and sauteed on the stove. I chopped the thighs and added onions, mushrooms and broccoli. We are trying to save money so that cut down on the amount of chicken I used. Next time I may add carrots as well. The sauce is tasty. I did not add corn starch like others did. The sauce thickened up on its own as I sauteed. I will definitely use this recipe again.

I cut down on the sauce by 1/3 added more ginger, and cooked this in a skillet with julienne carrots and fresh green beans. It was a big hit served over brown rice.

WOW.  Made this for a party of about 60 people or so.  The marinade I made just as written, but I used boneless skinless chicken thighs instead of breasts.  It was a huge hit with my guests.  They cooked for way longer than an hour and half though, and I didn't turn them over at the 1-hour mark.  Hey--6 pans and 55 pieces--that was a TON!!!  Oh, upping the recipe for that much made way more marinade than I needed, so I froze what was left for future use.  GREAT recipe, thanks for sharing!
