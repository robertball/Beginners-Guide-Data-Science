The sweet popcorn was easy to make. The sugar syrup was not too hard or too soft. I made some witches'
 shoes out of black cardstock and scrapbook paper. I added the popcorn to a clear bag and tied it with a ribbon and placed in the witches' shoes.

This is a very fast and easy popped corn treat! 
Used two packs of Microwave popcorn (Kettle Corn),
1 Â½ c of M&M peanut butter treats instead of nuts.
Lots of syrup coating to go all over.
Very tasty!  Two large cookie sheets!

this is very good and a nice change from caramel corn, with many variations to suit your own taste, or in my case-what I had on hand.  I used some mini M&Ms, caramel filled M&M's, peanuts, and raisins.  Easy to make and done in no time.  very nice snack and the M&Ms give it a nice pop of color for the holidays.
