very good. my kids had three servings, a miracle around here. the only thing i can suggest is to keep an eye on the glaze as it thickens in the pan. we added some water half way and checked often when basting.

This recipe is really great! I bought a pre-cooked spiral sliced ham and just followed the cooking directions, which brought cooking time down to  1.5 hours.  I gently rinsed off most of the included glazed first, and I also sprinkled extra brown sugar on the outside.  It was very good and very visually impressive.

Delicious.  I made this for Easter dinner with a few modifications:  used ground cloves and pineapple chunks instead.  I threw it all in the crockpot- first hour on high and then about 5 hours on low.  Came out so juicy and tender.

Fantastic recipe, my whole family was ranting and raving how delicious and juicy it was.  I took note of past ratings and used a whole bottle (20 oz) of 7 up and extra pineapple syrup AND juice.  Perfect!!

Simple and does the job. I used pineapple juice (we do not buy thy syrup kind) and replaced the brown sugar with a good quantity of maple syrup, like we do in Quebec where I grew up. I also added a quarter of an onion in the pan for added flavor and covered the ham losely with foil for the first 90 minutes. Baked until meat reached 140F, basting frequently after the first 90 mins. Yummy!!

This is almost the exact recipe I use for my Easter and Christmas Ham. I decorate the ham the exact way as called for in this recipe.   I use 2 cups brown sugar Preferably dark brown, Enough of the pineapple juice to make a wet sand consistancy, I add about a 1/4 cup of yellow mustard, 1 teaspoon ground cloves, and pour over ham then pour the rest of pineapple juice in pan and seal it with foil.  I bake at 325 for 2 hours completely covered and then for about 15 minutes at 400 degrees, I baste with the juices from the bottom of pan every 5 minutes.  If you completely seal the ham in the beginning, you will never have dried up juices. This is for an 8 lb or so ham.  For a 12 lb ham, I would bake sealed for about 3 or 4 hours sealed and then the same for the last 15 minutes.  I also thicken the juices at the end with a flour and water mix.  My ham and sweet gravy has always been the talk of the dinner.  My granddaughter always requests it during the holidays.

Great, even without the soda. Just added more pineapple juice and the juice from the cherries. Turned out very good.

I think this ham is great,but I probably should have used brown sugar instead of golden yellow sugar and pineapples in syrup not the ones in juice because my glaze wasn't that good.But next time i will follow this recipe as directed and i'm sure it will be even better.

I made this for Thanksgiving this year, and everyone absolutely loved it!!  It was easy to adjust the ingredients, and my boneless ham worked just fine.  I put mine on a roast rack, and the only thing I would've changed was making more of the basting sauce since my pan juices dried up right at the end.  I loved pulling a beautiful looking ham out of my oven!!

I have made this before and making again for Christmas tomorrow.  I follow it exact HOWEVER - those who live in Michigan - instead of 7-Up, use Vernors Ginger Ale....YUM  (also a great way to reheat - simmer in the Vernors)

Delicious flavor but ... the pineapple turned black in a couple hours, and the outside rind would have two if I let it stay uncovered for 4 hours. I covered it midway through the cooking and put the pineapple/cherry's on and uncovered the last hour. SAFE.  Also ... the scores in the rind grow. Score maybe 1/8" deep, and may even reduce the heat a bit. ALL IN ALL ... GREAT RECIPE.

Just the way grandma made!  I did use a precooked ham (all the store had!) and used the time recommended for heating the ham.

Totally forgot to take a picture but it looked so nice my DD would not slice it but put the platter of ham on the table so every one could see it. My ham was a pre-cooked spiral ham so I made the recipe but wrapped the ham tightly in heavy duty aluminum foil in a pan and put it in the oven at 300 degrees for 2 hours.  The ham was so moist. Every one asked if they could take a little home to have the next day. Will definitely make my hams this way from now on.

Best ham ever!!!  I used a precooked ham butt. Not a spiral sliced because they dry out too much, but it was already pre-cooked.  I used the juice from two cans of pineapple and about 1/2 cup more sprite.  I also omitted the cherries.  12 lb ham cooked for 2.5 hours at 350.  People literally said it was the "Best Ham they had ever had" Thanks for such a simple and traditional recipe!

This is pretty much the same recipe that my family has been using for years...the only thing we really do differently is use a little more pop and save mixing the sugar with the juices until the end when the ham is done.  (so you have to figure in some extra time for basting) Then we pull the juices from the pan and then mix with the sugar, while keeping the ham covered in between basting, baste every 15 mins for about an hour or until you are ready to eat.  If you want, put it in the warm oven inbetween to keep it warm.  If you think the ham is drying out during cooking take the pan juices and baste every so often.  Also we put foil over the ham in the roaster to keep it really sealed.  Fantastic!!!!  Thanks for posting.

I submitted this recipe a while back. Today I read all the reviews. I want to add a few comments. First, don't be afraid of the cloves. I know it sounds like it's too many, but trust me, it will not overpower the taste. Personally, I can't stand the smell of them! Lol. Second, if your juice or pineapple are burning, the temperature of your oven may be off. I have NEVER had a problem with burning. Those of you who don't like this recipe, there are lots of other delicious recipes. Those of you who do like it, thank you for your comments. Thank you all for trying!  Happy Cooking!

Decent glaze. Added some nice flavor, and stuck to the ham well.  Didn't use cloves or cherries and it still turned out good.

As i recently moved to Brazil, and since im already home sick, i wanted to recreate my younger Xmas days that were filled with the pineapple ham my mother use to make. So my husband went shopping and came back with a whole green pineapple. Ok canned pineapple doesn't exist here. So when life gives you green pineapples, you curse your husband a bit and steal the ripe pineapple that was luckily at his parents house.  So i made the pineapple syrup from scratch using the peel and sugar while i refrigerated the slices.  Oh did i mention i had no lemon-lime carbo -blah blah blah.  So i squeezed about  half a lime on the syrup to substitute. Dang nothing was going to stop me from making this. So Then i poured the cool syrup on the slices and placed it back in the fridge.  Best syrup ever!  At the end the recipe worked it was a hit and cured my homesickness even if it was for a day or two.

This is my VERY first ham and this recipe was right on point!!!! I searched the site to try to get a recipe that would give me a ham that tasted close to what I grew up with as a child...and I think I've topped even my mom's ham!!! Oh my! The ham had just the right about of sweet and salty...perfect. I used a 6 lb ham and made the glaze as directed and it was just the right amout of glaze for my 6 pounder. I cooked the ham with just the cloves, pineapple slices and cherries and then added the glaze in the last hour of cooking from reading the reviews of how the glazed burned. I didn't score my ham either but it came out just as juicy! Thank you for this recipe. I think I will keep this and pass it down to my future children.

Delicious BUT I cooked a 14 lb spiral ham for about 6 1/2 hours at 325 degrees and it was definately moist. They key to a moist ham is slow cooking at a low temperature. The leftovers were just as great and I will make again!

My mom's recipe for years is similar to this minus a few ingredients.  Just place ham in crockpot, pour a 16 or 20 oz. can of pineapple rings with juice over top and sprinkle with 1/2 cup of brown sugar.  Walk away and let cook for 5-6 hours on low and wow.  Not only will your house smell like ham heaven, but it will fall off the bone and break into chunks of yummy deliciousness.  :)  Enjoy!

This was the first time I actually didn't mess up the ham for Thanksgiving!  I had a 9 pound pre-cooked spiral sliced bone-in ham and I cooked it 1.5 hours.  Perfect!

The best ham my family ever had. We used more soda after it was in the oven so it wouldn't dry out, and it came out perfectly.

Made this for our Christmas dinner and it was great!  The only thing that I did differently was I poured some of the soda and brown sugar mixture over the ham and put it in the oven and every 30 minutes, I would put more of the mixutre over the ham.  Kept everything else the same.  My husband took the sauce from the bottom of the roasting pan and made a glaze with it that tasted wonderful:)  Thanks for sharing your recipe!:)

I Loved this recipe.  I didnt do the scoring and diamond patterns that was a bit much for me, it was still good.  It was really tender and delicious i will surely make this again.

For the first time this year I dressed up my ham with this recipe, I baked it covered then uncovered the last 30 mins, basting throughout cook time. Everyone loved it, but I didn't taste any of the clove flavor like I thought I would. My ham was already cooked so it just needed to be heated (2 hrs 45 mins).

I thought this sounded great and the flavor of the ham was great, but the texture was pure mush. We have ham fairly regularly, and it's never been mushy before.

This is the first ham I've ever made and the best ham I've ever had!  My great aunt (who is very picky about meat) said she hasn't had ham this good in 16 years!!  We used an Amana bone in ham and followed the directions exactly and it was a huge success.  This is the only time I have left a review on a recipe and it is SOOOOOOO worthy of 5 stars!!!!

At age 71, I;ve cooked a lot of hams. This recipe was the best I've ever tasted! Even my neighbor (also 71) called and said this was indeed the best she's ever had. Since I couldn't do all the basting, I covered the roaster tightly with foil. Ham was so tender and juicy and the flavor fantastic!

Turned out very nice, and was absolutely beautiful as far as presentation went. I was really disappointed though that the drippings were way too salty to be used as a sauce. I don't know if the soda causes more salt to leach out of the ham than usual, or why that happened.

This was intriguing to add the 7-up, so I tried it.  Did come out moist, but too thin for a glaze, probably because I used pineapple in natural juice.  I also used ground cloves in the mixture, which turned out to be the best flavor of all.  Next time, I'd add more brown sugar,

The ham itself was good with the cloves, pineapple and cherries but the glaze was tasteless.  I think the problem is that the consistency is much too thin.  I basted frequently.  I made a special trip out to buy Sprite but I don't think it made any difference to the final product.  So if you don't have any, no worries.  I think I'll stick to my usual glaze recipe, which has a thicker consistency and really adheres to the ham.

Super easy and a great tasting ham. My family loved it and even my girls got in on helping with all the cloves and stemming the cherries.! lol (I think you could cut down on the amount of cloves though, as it does add a VERY strong taste in the skin.) I will definitely make this again!

Best ham I have ever ate! I have had trouble with the spiral hams because they always turn out dry.  This recipe was the most moist ham I have ever made! I bought a 2L bottle of soda and just measured out 12oz on a measuring cup. One note: The presentation is not as elegant as going in as the pineapple, cherries, and skin do blacken some.  I just removed any blackened fruit, before moving to a platter. The ham is delicous, so it really doesn't matter. I also just put the cloves in randomn spaces, using about 1/4-1/2 tsp. Anymore, and the ham would taste of nothing but cloves. I have made this ham about 4-5 times and it is always enjoyed.

very good recipe, only suggestion I would make is not to use as many cloves, I used around a dozen. the first time I made the recipe I followed it to a T and the clove was very overpowering so the next time I used less and it was fantastic!

Well, I didn't buy any of the cherries, but then when I went to put the pineapple slices on the ham using the toothpick in the middle, the toothpicks got burned so I ended up taking those out completely and also ended up scorching on the pineapple slices.  The ham glaze/ham was delicous, though.  I used some cloves but probably didn't need as many as called for - I would spread them out more the 2nd time around.  I would also make my "diamond" shaped knife cuts more attractive.  It was very good.

I was not impressed with this. The ham tasted dry and the glaze bubbled up and burnt in the pan. I will say that this was my first time cooking a fresh ham but I followed the directions exactly.

Used this recipe for baking my first Easter Ham and it was out of this world. I used some other reviewers suggestions and used one teaspoon ground cloves, 1.5 cups brown sugar, juice from two cans pineapple rings and skipped the soda and used 1/4 cup mustard. I decorated with rings and cherries and kept covered with foil until last 30 minutes of baking. it was so moist and flavorful. this will be my recipe for ham from now on. thank you!

Good recipe. I cooked it for the least amount of time recommended rather than the most since it was a ready-to-eat ham. I cooked in a roasting pan and let it sit with the lid on for 15 min after removing from oven. The ham was perfect....not dry at all.

I followed the recipe and the pineapple and the cherries turned brown. It takes about 4 hours for a 12 lb ham to cook and this is too long for pineapples and cherries. Follow your butcher's cooking instructions instead!

Never made ham before.  Got a bigger ham.  I used a crock pot/slow cooker, because there simply wasn't enough roon for my turkey and ham in the oven.  Cooked on high for 1 hour, and low for 4 hours.  I used 20 ounces of 7 UP.  I used 15 cloves (didn't know if they would soften up, and YES they did).  I did use a toothpick for the cherries and pineapple.  The ham meat fell off the bone!!  Next time I will not use the toothpicks.  So, I won't have to dig into the meat for the toothpicks.  Very tender, very tasty, thank U!!

I read the other reviews so I selected a small aluminum roasting pan and placed it on a cookie sheet for support.  I had no problem with the juices burning and had plenty to bast my 9 pound, bone in ham.

This recipe is staple in our house. When I buy a ham to cook up, this recipe is automatically pulled out. Easy, quick to put together, and everyone loves it. I will sometimes use some of the juice from the cherries instead of sugar, it works just as nicely.

I made a few changes to the recipe in response to other reviews.  I baked the ham without the sauce for about 2 hours (while the ham was wrapped in parchment paper and then aluminum foil).  Then I opened it up, added the pineapples, a few cherries, rest of the sauce incredients.  Closed up the parchment and foil and continued baking.  It was very moist and very juicy.  The sauce didn't really have enough time to thicken up though, but at least there was no burning problem that others experienced.  I guess if I would do it again, I would either add the sauce earlier or use less soda so it is not quite so runny.  Tasted great though!

I've found that this recipe is even better if you substitute 1 cup of mild molasses & 1 cup of granulated sugar for every 1 cup of brown sugar.

First time making ham for a group of twenty and it got really good reviews. I left out the cloves & used canned real cherries instead of maraschino. For best results, use a bone-in picnic ham.

Made this ham today for my family and they really loved it,they couldn't stop complementing on how delicious and elegant it looked. The only difference was that i used pineapple juice instead of syrup but it came out perfectly tender and juicy.

I tried this recipe last night as I was having the family over for my sons birthday.  I receive a 20# ham every year from a client and have little opportunity to use it.  I prepared everything before I left for work in the morning then had my daughter set the ham in the roaster and pour the sauce over. When I got home my ham was swimming in liquid.  I tried a small piece and it had no flavor.  I poured off all the juice, made a simple glaze with what I had in cabinet and put it back in to cook while I finished dinner.  It was completely unremarkable.  I have to believe that my experience was uncharacteristic as so many people love this recipe.  I just found it to be too much liquid and the flavor just wasn't there.

This was so easy and exsactly what I was looking for: a classic ham.  Be careful with the cloves, they are pretty powerful.

I made this for our Christmas Eve open house - I totally omitted the cloves, and used crushed pineapple, but this ham was fantastic!   Everyone raved over it. Thank you!

I was looking for this recipe to find out when to place clove and pineapple on ham. Didn't use lemon soda, just added a few drops or so of real lemon.

Good ham!  I didn't give it five stars because I think I liked the mustard and brown sugar glaze I tried last week better.  HOWEVER, this was a very delicious recipe.  Make sure you keep basting away.  I added a little more brown sugar and used diet 7 up for the soda.  I must say the presentation was beautiful.  Lots of compliments!

Now that I make my ham this way, I am always requested to make the ham for holidays.  The only advice I can give is to keep an eye on the ham and baste it every 1/2 hour.  I also use the juice from two cans of pineapple rings and I eyeball the soda.  If the sauce starts to get really thick, I just pour in a tad more soda.  My husband, who doesnt like ham, ate it for 3 days straight!!!!!

This is a great ham recipe.  I cooked a 10 lb. ham and covered it with parchment paper and then foil for the fist hour or so.  I agree with some other reviewers- double the sauce if you want to have sauce to serve with the ham.  It was very moist.

Awesome recipe! everyone loved it. didn't use the carbonated beverage as the ham + pineapple juice mixture created enough juices of its own. So good! will definitely make again.. and again :)

This was a big hit this year with my in-laws.  I didn't have cherries, but no one missed them.  The flavor of the ham was wonderful.  I used orange soda instead of lemon-lime, it gave the ham a nice pineapple/orange flavor.

Been making this same recipe since 2006.  My only suggestion is keep extra cherries and pineapple on hand for serving afterward (if you like them) because they do get pretty well cooked up by the time you serve the ham.  I also use whole cherries instead of chopped cherries.

I feel that it got a bit too dry/cooked...I used the formula and for the 10 lb ham it should have been just the right time but the outside got pretty dark even with basting. I also think I will try honey next time instead of the sprite.

Finally, a recipe that uses soda! My Nan always used Mountain Dew (2 cups) and about 1/4 of the juice in a small jar of maraschino cherries as well, so those were the only things I changed. The extra soda gives more liquid for basting.

I absolutely love this recipe. I started using this a few years ago and now I am the one that has to bring the ham everything Thanksgiving!I usually uses a boneless, pre-cooked 10 pounder though, but still makes the best ham ever!!!! :)

I made this recipe for Easter.  It was wonderful.  Loved the favor of the ham and it was beautiful with the pineapples and cherries all around.  I received so many complements on it.  It was my first time cooking a ham so I was very pleased that the recipe made it so easy.

This is my world famous ham. My family loves it and anyone else that tries it. Never use a spiral cut ham, and I use ground cloves instead. My wife loves it and neither of us ever liked ham before.

Best ham I've ever had. I cooked it for an hour and a half covered then added LOTS of extra pineapple(threw it in the glaze at the bottom when the ham couldn't hold anymore)  and cooked uncovered for another hour and a half. Turned out perfect, loved the pineapple taste. 

I've probably made this 4 or 5 times now and it's our go-to recipe for ham. We also double/triple the amount of glaze on it and baste frequently throughout the cooking process. I use ground cloves instead of whole and mix it right into the liquid.

Best way to cook a ham - keeps it moist and flavorful - baste at least every 30 minutes

This has been one of our family holiday meals since forever!.....Along the way, I've tweaked it a little....I've substituted the lemon line soda for flavored sparkling water, which has less sugar and calories, use the flavor  of your choice, I go with pineapple or mango...the added brown sugar has more than enough sugar along with the heavy syrup from the can of pineapples.....but all in all the flavor is great and the ham always comes out juicy....As Mikey says....

Tip: One 20-oz can of pineapple rings is not enough to cover even a 7-lb ham, so definitely buy more than one.

Loved this ham recipe. Didn't use the soda bit did use pineapple rings, with syrup and brown sugar. Also since we don't like cloves I didn't use them.

I made it and it was a big hit.  I actually made two (spiral sliced) hams (from Costco) at once and just doubled the recipe.  I will say that I didn't use a 1/2 cup of cloves, I think that may be a typo. I used maybe a 1-2 tablespoons at most with 2 hams.  I made a few modification but it goes to show that you can modify without a problem.   I used all the cherries and dumped the cherry juice into the glaze mix.  Instead of the brown sugar, I used the brown sugar mix the hams came with (rather than throwing brown sugar mix that came with the hams into the trash). I didn't bake it for the full time indicated on the instructions. I only baked it for 3 hours, transferred it to a crock pot (for work) and then placed it on high for 3 more hours.  I did baste it about every 20-30 minutes while in the oven.  I received compliments on the ham and one person asked me for a recipe.  Overall an easy recipe and a great success.

I make this all the time ... diff method... pour gingerale in bottom of pan... foil and cook at 375 for 2 hours... take out, take rind off and diamond score fat... make a paste of the crushed pineapple or pineapple chunks, some juice, some cornstarch,  mustard and brown sugar.  Smear on ham and put back in oven for 1/2 hr  and baste ... I use the sauce as a side.. My kids love it...

This was awesome.
5.549kg Ham Bone-In (12 pound) took 5 Hours.
It was still a little frozen even after having almost 30 hours of thaw time.  
  
Everyone loved the sauce.
Had to use two cans of Pineapple, and I just threw the juice in the mix anyway. Thickened it up with Corn Starch and Water at the end for a 'gravy' ish thing for the ham.

Cooked for the last 20-30 minutes on Broil @ 400F to give some color to the pineapple/cherry/ham. It caramelized the sauce that was inside the pineapple and made them really really good.

OMG!!!  The most delicious tender ham I have ever made!  Everyone loved it.  Followed the recipe to the tee.  Basting every half hour.   The juice at the bottom I poured into a gravy boat and skimmed the fat.  So tasty!!!  I will never buy a spiral ham again, shank is the way to go.

I made this back in 2008 and I just dug through my email to find the link to make again this year (2015) we used a pre cooked spiral ham and just cooked to what on ham but used all these ingredients and basted a few times and it was sooo good and moist! Very good recipe and easy!

I made this ham for Thanksgiving.  It was so amazing, juicy and flavorful.  It was the first ham I ever made and it was so good.  Everyone raved about my ham.  I was very proud of myself since I'm still new to cooking and I made a ham that tasted so good.  This recipe will be a repeat year after year.  I followed it exactly.  The recipe said to baste frequently so I ended up basting it every 20-30 minutes.  I didn't time it for how long I left it in the oven though, I just used a meat thermometer to make sure it was at 160 F before I took it out the oven.

This recipe was just okay for us.  I don't think that any of the ingredients did much for this ham and the cloves needed to be removed before eating.  I probably won't try again.  I'm sorry!

I have made this for Christmas and Easter and continue to love it. I am not a huge clove fan and neither is my husband, so we just make it without them and it turns out great. When you can find a recipe that your mother in law compliments you on, you know you found a winner!

My family really enjoyed this...I only had to make of couple of small modifications:  I wasn't paying attention to the label when I bought the pinapple; I got juice-pack instead of heavy-syrup-pack, so I whisked in about a tablespoon (or about a 1-second squirt) of maple syrup to the pinapple juice. I used ginger ale instead of the lemon-lime soda.  I couldn't justify opening a new can of soda when I had ginger ale in a bottle that was just starting to go flat, and would have been wasted otherwise.  Even with those two small improvisations it came out great!!

I made this today for Thanksgiving, and all I can say is YUM! My mother accidently bought a fully cooked ham, so I cut the cook time 1.5 hours at 325 degrees. I increased the soda to 20 oz and used 1 cup of brown sugar, I also did not include the cherries (not a fan) but it still looks amazing. I would baste it every 20 minutes. This will be my go-to ham recipe.

I made this ham for my boyfriend and his parents.  It was a hit.  I didn't put any soda in it but it still came out really good and I used the leftovers to make a really good potato soup the next day!
