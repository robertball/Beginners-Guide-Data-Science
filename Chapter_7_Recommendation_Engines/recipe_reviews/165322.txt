Very good and easy - I marinated the chicken for an hour or so using a bit of oil to thin it out a bit then BBQ'd it. Everyone loved it.

This recipe was sub par compared to others i have tried form the site. I don't feel like the flavors worked together well. I am however inspired to try this but substitute the horseradish for a hot spice like chill powder or cayenne pepper.

This was surprisingly sweet - not nearly as spicy as I thought it would be with the horseradish. However there was nothing terribly special about this chicken.

Horseradish overwhelmed the other flavors. Mixture is thick if you use really good orange marmalade so it doesn't pour onto the chicken. Good not great.
