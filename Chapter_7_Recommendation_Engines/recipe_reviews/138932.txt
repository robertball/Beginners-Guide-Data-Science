The things i changed in this recipe was using margarine instead of crisco, adding 1/4c milk, 1/2 tsp salt, and they turned out excellent!  Oh yeah, and liquid food gel to make them hot pink!  I made mini cupcakes, so they only needed about 15 min to bake.  Make sure to cream the sugar with the margarine very, very well, don't over mix the rest, and you will end up with a light, fluffly, and moist cupcake!

I love these cupcakes, the flavor was great and the texture as perfect. I did make a few minor changes to the recipe.  I didn't use  shortening so I substitued softened butter and I added a pinch of salt to the recipe.    I made the cupcakes tonight and I had to use a great deal of disciple to only eat 2.  Thank you for sharing this great recipe.  It is a keeper!

Recipe was yummy. You definitely will need to add the 2 tbsp of water as it comes out very thick.  Also, the recipe only made 8 cupcakes for me-normal size, but full-they came out very pretty.

Great taste and nice texture. I didn't have shortening so i used softened butter instead.  The batter was a bit dry so i added 2 tablespoons of water. I will definitely make these again.

Nice dense but still moist, and not overly sweet.  I also added 1/4 cup milk and used butter not crisco.  The tops were a smooth lightly crisp top, not the sticky tops that come with box mixes.  Easier to put the frosting on that way!  Wonderful recipe!

I liked how this recipe tasted and it baked well.  I used butter for flavor instead of shortening.  I added egg whites plus one egg.  It came out fluffy and lite without being too sweet.

A good recipe!  Yes, you do have to make some changes to add moisture to the cupcakes, but it is not that hard!  A tbsp of milk is all you need and they come out lovely and moist.  I added some extra vanilla for a bit more of a "punch," and it definitely helped!  I topped with chocolate icing and they were quite yummy!

I pre-measured all the ingredients, yet this batter was definitely not pourable as indicated. It was quite thick, more like muffin batter. I'm not a fan of vegetable shortening and normally do not use it, but I did for this recipe. I really would prefer a lighter cake with more flavor.

Followed the recipe exactly. Filled the liners half way and baked for only 12 minutes. They were crisp on the top as another reviewer stated so they do frost well. They are dense and not very sweet.

Worked really well and tasted fabulous. I never use Crisco... Instead I substituted with 1/4 cup natural apple sauce and 2 Tbs milk. I also added 1/4 tsp of salt. This made 33 mini cupcakes, which were ready in 13 minutes. This is my new run to cupcake recipe. :)

These cupcakes remind me of pound cake-which I love!  The batter is far thicker than I expected, almost like a cookie dough, but they turned out perfect--lightly browned on top.  I made one small adjustment-instead of all shortening, I used half margarine and half shortening.  I prefer the flavor that way.  I highly recommend this recipe!

Liked these cupcakes.When I pulled these from the oven, the sour cream flavor was sharp and gave the cupcakes a nice flavor, but I found the next day, the taste was mostly a plain vanilla cupcake. Also, the shortening gave the cupcakes a firmness. Another reviewer said this batter made 8 cupcakes. I made ordinary sized cupcakes and got 13 cupcakes. Overall, nice cupcake.

Very dry as-is, but promising flavor and texture; I'll be adding more liquid and watching the bake time more closely, next time. I'll most likely try baking at a higher temp for the first half, then finishing them at 350, so they get nicely domed tops.

I thought the recipe was alright. Even with a few changes to it, it still was missing something. I added a pinch of salt, a cup of milk and I used butter crisco.

They were a little dry. The frosting made it a little more moist. I will be altering this recipe next time.

They were very dense, tough, flavorless cupcakes.  Very dry and no flavor, this was even after adding extra vanilla and some almond extract. Will not make these again.

I've already started this in the bowl,but I'm going to make changes& while I am usually certain about changes being for the better,I'm not so sure about this.'Think I'd not make it now that I've read&compared to tried recipes.I'm going for 24,not 16 cupcakes,so am halving more the recipe.These amounts: 2 1/4c flour;1T bpowder;1/4 + 1/8t bsoda;ADDING 1/2t salt;SUBBING 1/2c BUTTER;INCREASING sugar to 1 1/4c;ONLY using 2 eggs (eggs'll do that. A fudgy 2 egg  brownie recipe becomes cakelike with one more egg); 2/3c mostly sour cream w remainder plain yogurt;ADDED 1/3c milk;1 1/2t vanilla.I usually don't feel guilt with changes.This one's different. I don't know why, maybe the severe changes; but not that much considering I'm just increasing, right?!Please forgive.I'll get back with results.(Crossing fingers!) Not done yet,in the oven,but more to say: Only 18 muffins w increased amount. With 15 to 20 minute bake time,submitter MUST HAVE been using a lessthan standardsize pans to get 16.Batter seems seeet enough.'Thicker than most cake batters even with adding milk.'Still crossing fingers.Out of the oven in 18.Very light in weight.Hope that doesn't mean very dry.TASTE TEST:'Tastes like a cake mix.Not a bad cake mix.Light like they are.'Not very moist,but moist enough to say not dry.'Stuck to the wrappers a little. Just okay.I give myself a cheer for decreasing to 2 eggs.'Woulda been dry with three for sure.

This is a very flexible recipe, which is key for me because I was "assisted" by my three year old and we don't have time for scientific measuring when she's involved.  

I added an entire 8 oz container of sour cream that I had frozen and then thawed in the microwave, a smidge of milk and extra teaspoon (or more probably two) of Mexican vanilla.  I did not use Crisco, but instead subbed butter as recommended by other reviews.  Also sprinkled maybe a 1/8 - 1/4 teaspoon table salt into the batter. 

This recipe yielded exactly 48 mini-cupcakes--scooped with a mini-scoop into mini-cupcake liners, with just a little bit of batter left on the beater.  The cupcakes rose nicely.  Not sure why other reviewers are "pouring" their batter into their cups.  I'd recommend  an ice cream scoop or melon baller. 

I set my oven timer for 7 minutes, then added a minute or two as needed until they were just perfectly browned.  (I baked two mini-trays at a time on the same rack). 

I don't like using Crisco, so I topped them with a pure buttercream and some Christmas Sprinkles.  They looked and tasted amazing.

Just baked this as I was feeling a bit under the weather... :( - baking is always soothing for me. Back to the review - had no sour cream and shortening so used canola oil and past sell by date yoghurt (expired sounds wrong!).
They have turned out great and seem lovely and fluffy. Am resisting the tempetation to actually taste one for fear of... you know what.
Thanks Emma!
