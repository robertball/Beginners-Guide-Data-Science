This is an enjoyable strawberry margarita.  Next time I would cut back a smidgeon on the lime juice.

I was happy to find a recipe that uses all real ingredients instead of a limeade mix like the other recipes.  I would add a little more sugar next time because I used individually quick frozen strawberries (no sugar) and they weren't that sweet.  It's an easy thing to taste and add more as needed.  I found the lime amount perfect.  Will make again.

Proportions made for a nice, refreshing cocktail. I know it's a matter of taste, but my wife and I added just a touch more sugar as it was slightly tart to our taste.

No ice - just used frozen individual strawberries I had frozen. Added a bit of simple syrup to sweeten them up.  Yummy!

I  thought this was pretty good.  I  thought the tequila was a bit strong and overpowered the strawberries,  but no one else that I shared these with thought so, so I think it's just a personal preference.   Thanks for sharing this recipe!

I would add less lime and double the amount of ice. I multiplied everything by 4 (minus the lime; x8 for the ice) and it came out perfect! Definitely using this recipe again and again!!

This is a really nice margarita recipe.  It is so much better with lime juice and not frozen limeade.  I'll be making these all summer long!!
