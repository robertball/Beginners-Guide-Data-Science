I used this brine recipe for a 4 lb. pork shoulder roast. I marinated overnight. I cooked in slow cooker and we ate it on onion rolls with some pickled peppers I canned. My family ate and ate. We all loved the bit of tangy flavor of the meat. Simple and easy.

Very good brine, will definitely make pork chops this way again although, next time I might use slightly less salt. Maybe 1/3 cup vs. 1/2 cup.

I found it easy to make and added just enough flavor to enhance the taste of my first smoked Boston butt.
