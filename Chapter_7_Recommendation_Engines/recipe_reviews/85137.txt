Just OK as listed.  I had to make some modifications. There wasn't enough cheese for my family's taste, so I had to add way more than the recipe called for, then I had to add milk to that to make it saucy.  I also sauteed the chicken in garlic and a bit of chicken broth for added flavor, eliminating the grease of the bacon, but scraping up the drippings from the pan instead so we got the bacon flavor.  Also added some fresh broccoli, per another reviewer.  Served over buttered noodles and with garlic breadsticks. I might make it again, with the changes.

This dish was wonderful! My son - who is a picky eater said it was one of the best dishes I've ever made.  I had read the reviews and decided to change the type of cheese and used Montery Jack and Pepper Jack in place of the Cheddar, a 1/4 cup each.  It melted so well - I will definitely make this again.

This was really good.  I would have given it 5 stars but I had to add more cheese in order for the chicken to be "coated".  I probably put over a cup of cheese in this.  This recipe is great for those of us watching our carbs!  We did not eat it over pasta.  It was good by itself.

Incredible!!!!  My family loved this recipe.  We put in a little more ham and bacon than called for and it made a great flavor.  We served it over pasta, yummy.  My husband suggested making a cheese sauce for it rather than melt the cheese.  We will try that next time!

Three stars at best...  This recipe was just boring.  I steamed fresh broccoli and tosed it in before I added the cheese. Without the broccoli, I think this would have been a complete bore.  A little melted cheese and some bacon grease hardly constitutes a sauce.

Your recipe comes to us from Merry Old England.  It is an old English recipe.  The first I heard of it was from the English TV show "Keeping up Appearances".  Onslow, the husband of Rose and the Brother-in-law of Hyacinth Bucket, has often asked for a plate of "Bicon Bootee".  The dish itself is a "crust-less" quiche. If you like this dish you might like to try Mini cheese, bacon and noodle quiches.  Leave it to the French to steel a humble English recipe, jazz it up, and call it "Quiche"!

This was a great recipe the kids loved it and they are hard to please. I am not a great cook. I have always done the simple things. I came on here to find something new that was easy. And this is defiantly the recipe it is easy, fast and taste great Thanks.

This was really good. It did take more cheese than was stated and I added a splash of milk. Also, after it was in the bowl for me to eat, I added some lite ranch dressing and it was delicious.

I'd say this was a 3 1/2 star recipe; I gave it 4 because it was easy, and helped me get rid of some of the things I had in the fridge.  Only change I made was to throw in some steamed broccoli before adding the cheese and since I used leftover bacon from the am, I didn't use the bacon grease. OK recipe.

Great meal.  I believe you should add scallions and garlic.  It definitely adds to the taste.  Also, if you like cheese, you'll need to add more

This one did not go over well.  Even after adding some garlic, onion and a bit of chicken broth to flavour it, the meal was very bland.  My husband and son couldn't wait to sit down to this meal but in the end asked me not to make it again any time soon.  Sorry.

My 18 yr old loved this quick easy dinner and my 8 yr old wanted her chicken before I put the cheese on.  We served it with rice and used almost twice as much chicken.  I can see this easily making its way into the dinner rotation as quick, easy and budget friendly.

Very quick and tasty. I was surprised that there are no seasonings listed in the ingredients and decided to season the chicken before frying. I'm glad I did. I didn't end up with a sauce at the end, something that didn't surprise me since there is no liquid in the recipe. I will be making some changes next time I make this so that there is a sauce. I would suggest cutting the bacon before frying rather then after. Great served with baked potatoes or au gratins.

My husband who is on the Atkins Diet loved it--did not serve over pasta.  I took the advice of others and added garlic, salt & pepper.  I didn't have bacon to fry, but instead used pre-cooked. (Added oil to pan instead of bacon drippings) I will definitely make this again

This turned out kind of dry and didn't have a lot of flavor--won't make again.
