I was tasked with bringing a potato dish to a family Christmas dinner, one that would go with ham.  After researching the many potato recipes on this site, I chose this one; the shredded pepper jack cheese caught my attention.  However, I did tone the spices down, omitting the red pepper flakes, as a few of the family cannot eat spicy foods.  But I did add crumbled bacon to the mix and substituted freshly cut green onions as a final topping.  What a hit this was!  The casserole dish was emptied, which speaks volumes by our extended family!

I make this without the roasted red peppers and use cheddar.  It's very good and a snap to make!!  Place topping with crushed potato chips.  Lots better.

Turned out great. I did use green onions instead of a regular onion. Also added Ritz crackers as the topping since itâ€™s what I had. It was well liked and will make again. Thanks!!

Delicious.. I used panko bread crumbs and accidentally added them to the batter and the top. I also instead of roasted peppers i used chipotle peppers
