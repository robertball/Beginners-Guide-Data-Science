I made this soup a little different. I have tried to mash cauliflower in the past and all I did was make a mess. So, instead I just chopped up the cauliflower really small, which took some time. I then put it in the slow cooker along with the other veggies and the broth. I also added some shredded chicken. The end result was really good.

This soup was easy to prepare. The results were a light but yet satisfying soup. I received several requests for the recipes at our staff "soup" lunch.

I made this for my older son, who had his tonsils out earlier this week. I just plugged in what I had on hand and this is one of the recipes that came up. (Thank goodness for the ingredient search!) I did add about four cloves of minced garlic that I sauteed with the celery, onion and carrot. I also used organic chicken broth. I pureed this soup in batches so it would go down easy. After pureeing the whole batch, I brought the soup up just under a slight boil and wisked in 1/4 cup of extra sharp white cheddar. My son and I loved it. NOTE: For you low-carb-eaters like me, this is very low in calories and carbs. So....eat away!

This recipe has almost no flavor.  It's pretty much just vegetables, broth, and pepper - it needs way more seasoning!  I notice that most of the reviewers who liked it added something to it, most commonly some sort of meat.  I'm not much of a meat eater, so I wound up adding spices (cayenne pepper, garlic, seasoned salt) and lots of cheese, and still my husband won't eat it without sour cream.  The recipe is salvageable, but if I want to make a cauliflower soup again, I'll look for something else.

Fabulous recipe.  I didn't change any of the ingredients but I did pur√©e about half of the soup in a blender after it was finished cooking.  It was a lovely creamy texture but still had bits and pieces of vegetables in it too.  Delicious!

Quick, easy and yummy.  I took a cue from a couple of other reviews and added some light smoked sausage - still only 90 calories per cup!

I made this recipe the other night, and it's surprisingly fragrant and tasty.    I actually didn't mash the cauliflower and I added twice as much celery and carrots as instructed.  I thought the 6 cups of chicken broth might be too salty, but it turned out great.  Oh, and I added up some chopped cooked, low-fat bacon to add extra flavor.  This is a simple reciple that is pretty satisfying.

If you like plain vegetables (cauliflower, celery, carrots) you will enjoy this. Otherwise don't make it as is.  We enjoyed it and it would also be good with sausage added. I did double the celery and carrots as suggested by another reviewer.

I love cauliflower and I really liked this soup but in my opinion it needs potatoes.  I added them into the left over soup the next day.  I sliced the carrots with a veggie slicer instead of shredding them and I think it would also be really good with some fresh parsley.

Great, easy soup. I used homemade chicken stock and added a bit of garlic. Didn't bother cooking the cauliflower separately, just threw it in the stock after sauteing the other veggies. Pureed with an immersion blender and served it with some finely grated Parmesan cheese and whole wheat yeast rolls. Perfect!

This came out great - but I did add quite a heap of curry powder to give it more interest - and I think that made it a hit in our household.  Also - parmesan cheese melted on the top is a winner!

I guess the ingredient list should have given it away, but this soup was incredibly bland! It had absolutely no flavour whatsoever. Even for picky kids, I think you can do better!

Only gave this four stars as written, but would give it five after my modifications.  Here goes: Sauteed the vegetables in coconut oil instead of olive.  Everything tastes better in coconut oil.  Chopped the cauliflower in smaller pieces so no need to mash when steamed.  Also added some cooked white rice in the soup at the end to give it a little more bulk.  Seasoned with a little ground Himalayan pink sea salt to taste.  Added grated parmesan cheese on top.  Can't wait for the leftovers!

After reading that some cooks found this bland, I added a tsp Herbs de Provence and a dash of red pepper.  Also, ran 3/4 through a blender on puree and the rest on chop.  Great!

I was really looking forward to making this soup.  I added a bay leaf, shallots and put in a homemade chicken stock.  The result was quite disappointing. No matter how I seasoned it (salt, pepper, hot sauce, parmesan cheese), it had no flavor.  I guess I don't care for mashed cauliflower in soup.  It would probably work better with a cheese or dairy base.

So yummy! Reminded me of a borscht. Needed very little pepper. Oh, I accidentally shredded two carrots instead of 3/4 c, unintentional modification!

Thank you to the person that recommended adding curry to the recipe. Cauliflower and curry, perfect. I added extra of all the veggies and had a large cauliflower. Otherwise made the recipe as directed but added in 1 1/2 tsp of a mild flavorful curry. Delicious. Also a big difference in taste if you use fresh veggies from the farmers market.

I think it is tasty with homemade chicken stock.  As with any basic soup recipe you are free to add what suits your mood, taste and adjust with what you have on hand.    Glad this recipe offers a great way to eat cauliflower.   I did use an immersion blender and cooked the chopped cauliflower in the hot soup base.

I have to agree: This basic recipe produces a forgettably bland soup in dire need of a lift from seasonings or other assistance. After all, this soup is merely mirepoix and cauliflower in broth with a twist of pepper. There are other recipes out there with more promise of a flavorful outcome.

I loved this recipe, but when I made it for my vegan sister I had to change it up a bit. I sauted garlic with the celery and insteas of chicken broth, I just used water and threw in a couple tea bags of chamomile tea, and then took them out after a few minutes of steeping. Also I omited the carrots.

What a tasty and easy soup.  I steamed the cauliflower and then used an immersion blender to puree it.  Followed the rest of the recipe and added the cauliflower at the end.  The perfect blend of smooth, chunky and delish!

I added 4 cloves garlic, one extra bullion cube and some sea salt. Tasted bland while it was cooking, but then I pureed it in batches and reheated it later in the day and it was wonderful, creamy and flavorful. I also added a little shredded cheddar cheese to each bowl

Was'nt crazy about this soup. Followed the recipe, just added more spices to bring the taste up. Still prefer a creamy cauliflower soup.

12.17.16 ~ This soup had ok flavor, but the texture made it a little 'off' for us. I liked that it wasn't a creamy, milk/cream recipe, but the texture was kind of grainy like. I will use this recipe again, as it is very low in carbs, but the next time I will run it through the blender before serving. (3.5 stars)

This was a great recipe, but I did add to it. First of all, I didn't have broth, so used 6 bouillon cubes and 6 cups water.  I doubled the carrots and celery and also added 2 more cups of chopped cauliflower. I also put in pinch of garlic powder. These measurements are not exact and what I had in fridge.  When it was almost done, I took about 4 cups out and ran through my food processor.  Then, I added a cup of fat free half and half and a cup of grated cheddar cheese.  Delicious!!  And, it did not take very long to make.  Love it!!

Once when I did not have cauliflower, I made the soup with broccoli instead. AMAZING!!!! so is the cauliflower one. I also like to shred my carrots for a nice texture. Another time when I was making it( I have made it 4 times!!!)I put in waaaaaayyy to much pepper because my hand slipped. It tasted great! the pepper gave it a nice spice. All in all, I LOVE THIS RECIPE!!!!! U SHOULD TOO!!!

I found it a bit bland, so added some salt, mixed herbs & also chopped up a turnip & cooked it together with the carrots etc. I liquidized it all except some of the mashed cauliflower which I added afterwards.   It was good, but tasted great the next day when the flavours had blended.

This is one of our favorites.  I cook the cauliflower after I add the chicken broth to the soup.  I usually used a hand blender to pur√©e it but this time a used a hand potato masher & the cauliflower was like rice......so good!

I made it into a KETO recipe:
Fry a 1/2 lb. of Italian flavor bulk sausage with the onion.  Replace one cup of chicken broth with milk or heavy cream.
Make it easier: Double the amount of carrots and celery. Chop the cauliflower in small pieces. Add everything to the onion/sausage pan and cook until done.

Great quick soup! I was craving soup after a long day and this one was perfect!  I used the riced cauliflower and just blended it, and kept vegetarian with vegetable broth.  Think the next go would be nice with some roasted garlic added to it or a couple other spices to add another element of flavor.

I broke the cauliflower in small florets to stream in a skillet, then mashed with a potato masher.  Added it to saut√©ed onion, celery, red pepper, shredded carrots. Used vegetable broth and 1/4 cup parsley.  I blended about a cup + of soup in blender then added it back. Served in wide bowls, added pepper and paprika.   It was wonderful, easy to adjust to what I had on hand.   Will prepare again!

I really liked this soup.  It's simple, easy to make and very good.  I added a little garlic but otherwise followed the recipe.  Will definitely make again.  BTW, it's also good served cold.

I'm afraid I have to agree with others that this is a very bland soup. I had to make so many changes that it was in fact, an entirely different recipe. I will not make this again.

I just made this soup and I added a heaping teaspoon of curry powder to it and that gave just the right kick.  It was a little  boring  without it.  I also grated a little nutmeg into it as well.

My granddaughter and I made this last night. As others recommended we doubled the veges, and added garlic and curry powder.  We also made baked sweet potato fries which came out mushy so I suddenly decided to add some of them to this soup.  It was a nice sweet addition.

I just do not care for this recipe it all although I'm a big fan of cauliflower.  It's not filling; there's not much flavor.  I tried adding cayenne and topped it with parmesean, but still, nothing.  I do not like the texture of the mashed cauliflower floating in the broth.  Perhaps if I would've left the chunks it may have felt more like a meal.

Wow-loved this low fat, tasty soup. Cooked cauliflower in a water/bullion mix. Smashed with a potato smasher and added a celery and garlic saute from another pan.  Added pepper, dill and kale- because I had it prepared -and cooked through for 15 minutes. Fabulous texture

I saut√©ed mushrooms with the celery, onions and carrots.  Following other reviewers I also used one and one half teaspoons of curry and a teaspoon of garlic salt.  Then I added a few shakes of dried red pepper flakes.  I used a hand blender to blend about half of the soup to make it creamy but left it quite chunky.    It turned out great.

love it as a lunch staple and it gets rid of fridge leftovers (throw in carrots, peppers, onions, whatever!).  I don't precook any of the veggies, just put in a pot on low, or slow cooker.  I have a hand blender that I use when veggies are soft, blend right in the pot for a few seconds  - leaving it somewhat chunky.  A cup of milk helps to thicken a bit.  
Have tried with small cut ham steaks as well, very tasty.

I used this recipe as a base for a delicious, lower carb soup. I wanted to kick off my week with a meal that made it easy to stay on track, and this fit the bill!  To start, I doubled the veggies as the other reviewers suggested. Then I seasoned them with salt, pepper, garlic powder and onion powder as they cooked. I also threw in a few dashes of curry powder. Then I added some broken up, homemade chicken sausage patties that I had also seasoned with a bit of curry. This made an aromatic base to add both mashed and whole cauliflower to. It's delightful and despite carrot and onion being higher in carbs than some other veggies- it's way lower than the chicken rice soup I normally make!

I loved this recipe, it had simple ingredients and I used chicken bullion cubes for the broth.  I followed the recipe and made it in my immulsifier, added ground pepper and it was very tasty.  Thank you for this easy, very nutritious  recipe.

On one hand, the recipe fulfilled what I was looking for: a fast, simple recipe I had all the ingredients for. On the other hand, if I made it as is it would be very very bland. I added garlic and a spice mix called hawayej (a Yemenite mix for soups), and it was still on the bland side. In the future, I will chop the cauliflower and boil it with the broth and vegetables, and I will put even more garlic in it.

I pureed about half of it and added crushed red pepper.  I also add soy powder to give it more protein.  Very tasty.
