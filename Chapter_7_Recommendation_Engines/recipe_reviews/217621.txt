Rub and sauce tasty....expect longer than 4 hours cook time.  Instructions call for 1 1/2 hours per pound...for this 5 lb roast cook time would be 7 1/2 hours.  Really depends on your smoker but the title is correct...low and slow.  And definitely use a meat thermometer.  Served with a little cole slaw on top makes it Memphis-style pulled pork.

We loved this recipe! We had family visiting from Texas and they also loved it! It's definately a keeper. Tangy and sweet with the perfect amount of heat. It took much longer than 4 hours to cook but it was worth the wait. The only change we made was the wood used during smoking, we prefer applewood.

A little less paprika and don't bother with bbq sauce, better to just use your favorite store bought in my opinion. Fun to make for Superbowl 2012!

The rub recipe is so good on the pork. I made it for our Superbowl party and it was a big hit. I don't own a smoker so I put it in the slow cooker for 7 hours. Yummy!

Rub is awesome, I skip the sauce.  I also let it smoke way longer than 4 hours.  Minimum 1.5 hours per pound.  I then usually put in a dutch oven covered and in the oven on 225 till morning when I rest it and pull the pork to serve.  By then it just falls apart.

The technique in this recipe is perfect, but where are reviewers coming up with this stuff about "four hours of cook time?" The recipe calls for 7 1/2 hours. And that is only an estimate. Cooking to a temp of 195 is better, although many top pitmasters say 205. Best test, in any event, is to stick a fork in end of butt. If it will easily rotate 180 degrees, it's ready. If not, cook it a little longer.
