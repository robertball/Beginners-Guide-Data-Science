I really enjoyed this dish, however a bit more moisture is recommended for the bread crumb topping. I'm not sure if it was the elevation, but I had to used two eggs beaten in order for the bread crumbs to be moist enough not to fade into sawdust in the oven. I also substituted a cheddar and monterey jack mixture for the mozzarella as I like a little bite. I also sprinkled paprika and fresh ground black pepper on top of the cheese mixture, and grated fresh romano before applying the bread crumbs for a bit more spice.

Maybe this is a great recipe if you use frozen green beans, but I think it's practically inedible! A friend of mine picked green beans from her garden so I wanted to find a good side dish recipe. The cheesy sauce is wonderful, but the beans are like leather, impossible to chew. I don't know if they got that way from being baked in the oven or if they were too ripe, not ripe enough, etc. At least the rest of it tastes good!

Yummy and easy to make. I didn't have mozzarella, so I used parmesan and used soy mozzarella.   Everyone at the potluck loved it and asked for the recipe.

I made this for a potluck and I increased the cheese to 1 1/2 cups as another review suggested. It was great while it was hot, but as it cooled the cheese solidifies (not so great). I will do again but only for home meals. Need to be served hot.

I made this a while ago and I don't really remember it. It wasn't bad, but of course, it wasn't stellar. The top part was the best b/c of the crunchy, baked topping though.

Not the best thing I've ever eaten. As other reviewers said more moisture is needed for the topping of bread crumbs. Next time I will also increase the cheese mixture. Also the flour used to thicken the cheese sauce is almost unnecessary (for me) it gave it a floury taste and I did not like it.

I originally found this recipe years ago and added it to my favourite recipes immediately upon using it. I grew up disliking green beans. One year, times were hard, economy was bad and I had just moved and was looking for work, well, I got a  food basket and low and behold there were many cans of the dreaded green bean! I needed the food though and set off to find a way to fix green beans that I could tolerate. This recipe was it! I love green beans now and fix this recipe as often as possible, it is a big hit!

I will probably use only 1 cup of breadcrumbs the next time I make it.

This wasn't spectacular, but it was an excellent change from plan old green beans.  I've only made it once and wasn't displeased.  I will definately try again and maybe season it up just a little more.

Really fabulous recipe! The only suggestion I have is to add more mozzerella (I would actually double it next time). This is a good summer OR winter dish. Thanks for the recipe!

I liked it well enough. I like the idea of the recipe and will try again using a cheddar or other cheese that is creamy when it melts so that the sauce will seep through the green beans instead of sitting on top of the beans. I found the mozzarella to be to stringy and sticky. I believe I will also replace the bread crumbs with french fried onion rings.

I did nto care for this recipe. Crumb mixture was like sand when I sprinkled over the top.  Didnâ€™t look right but I proceeded.  Top browned nicely, but once a spoon broke the surface, the sand spilled everywhere. My apologies to the submitter  if it was just me.

This one won't be saved for another time. As others have said, the topping didn't turn out as discribed by the author because it lacked moisture. I also found the dish very bland for my liking. I will move on to the host of other bean recipies.

2 cups of bread crumbs for the top was way too much. Other than that, it was good.

It was extremely dry and over powered by the bread topping.  I was not impressed at all but will try again with significant modifications!
