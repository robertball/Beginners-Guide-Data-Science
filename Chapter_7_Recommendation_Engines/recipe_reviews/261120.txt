I loved the flavor in this. I made exactly as written but I do feel the butter needed doubled to coat the entire 12 ounces of cereal. The flavor was spot on though. I ended up needing an additional 30 minutes in the oven as written so plan ahead. The flavor is great and this is worth the time to make. This recipe filled 4 sandwich size ziplocks to give you an idea how much you will get in the end.
