I think the flour measurement is wrong. Four cups was absolutely not enough. I added more than a cup but I feel like that was not enough. I think it should be closer to 6 cups of flour. Other than that the rolls are delicious! My daughter especially loves that they re purple. I don t live where I can just buy poi so I made my own in a Blendtec using taro and water.
