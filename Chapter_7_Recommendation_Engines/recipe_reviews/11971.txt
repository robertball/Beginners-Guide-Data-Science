I thought this was a delicious basic recipe. There are so many variations you can try according to your taste. I added sauteed garlic, imitation crab meat and sprinkled fresh parmesan on top. It was so good & easy. I also served it warm. I did not rinse the noodles after cooking, just mixed it all together. Great!!

Great!  I used crushed ceasar croutons  then added a little italian dressing, shrimp, tomatoes, black olives, mozzarella cheese.  The family loved it.  It was a great way to use leftover fettuccini noodles.

Very tasty.  Used garlic olive oil which gave it a great flavor. Also added some romano cheese.  This recipe takes less than 10 minutes to put togther and can be used as a great side dish--I had it with veggie pitas for lunch!

This recipe rocks.  When I first made it I didn't rinse the noodles and served it warm with parmesan.  I stuck it in the fridge afterward and ate it cold from then on.  This recipe is delicious and incredibly simple.  It's loaded with flavor and I will definitely make it again.  WHOOO!

Was a great pasta dish, though it needed some garlic and cheese to tie it all together! I also added some fresh peas which tasted delicious.

I made this for a quick dinner tonight for a change from all the turkey and ham we've had for the past week over Christmas. I used Italian flavored bread crumbs and added some fresh green and red peppers. It was great! The only thing I would recommend would be to add a tad more olive oil so the pasta won't be so dry. Nice quick dinner or side dish recipe!

Good basic recipe. I wish I would have used my Italian flavored bread crumbs instead of the regular. Next time I'll try it with those instead.

This recipe made a great lunch.  I added parmesan cheese.  I also heated up the leftovers the next day and it was good warm too.  I would decrease the oregano a lot next time since it's such a strong flavor.

It was quick and easy, but didn't do it for me. I added more seasonings and tomato's. But I guess it just wasn't for me and my husband. I rated it 2 for easy and quick.

What you see is what you get.  In my opinion it is rather tasteless.  It was edible, and others in my party liked it.  But this pasta was a bit too bland for my taste.

Made this recipe twice. I thought it was bland. Needs a lot of added spices to make it tastier. I gave it three stars because it was really easy to make with ingredients you have around the home.

This was good! I actually made it for my finicky 14m old who is hating everything right now. She loved it! I used fettucini noodles so she could grab them and added a bit of butter and parmasean for an added taste. She really liked it! The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is due to the dryness - you hate to add too much oil, but the bread crumbs really soak up that moisture. Thanks for the recipe!

I found this very bland.  I did make just as stated.  So after tasting I added some parm, garlic and little more oil.  It was just ok.  I am going to the leftovers and make a dish with the Spicy Garlic Chicken from this site.

Really good!  Especially for how easy it is!  The only change I made was that I added a little parmesan cheese and a tad more oil to compensate.  Oh, and my bread crumbs were seasoned because that is all I had, but it turned out perfect. This is perfect for a yummy meal when you don't have a lot of time.

This was very good. I added some garlic salt and pepper, as well as parsley and Parmesan. Next time, I think I will try adding tomatoes too. Great base recipe with so many variations. Thanks!

I always wonder when I read a bland. review.  Simple solution is use excellent, tasty ingredients and if you know what you're doing, your own special twist and you can't go wrong.  If that doesn't do it for you, then check your meds because something has dulled your tastebuds.

This is a great base recipe. I changed mine to personal taste and added Zesty Italian Dressing instead of olive oil, and through in some feta cheese and chopped green bell pepper. Awesome and fast dish for the summer!

I really didn't have much luck with this recipe.  The pasta didn't taste like much, and it coated my mouth rather unpleasantly.  Nobody at my house liked it either.

Amazing recipe!
   I'm new a cooking, and this was really easy to make.  It was also very good!
   One thing I added was I put in 3 teaspoons of Olvive Oil, some garlic powder, touch of wine, and pine nuts.

Nice.  I use whole-wheat pasta and also added minced garlic and parsley with a little parmesan.  Hit.

It was pretty good, but I felt like it was missing something. Next time I might try it with some red bell peppers or lemon juice.

While the pasta, without anything added in was okay, the flavor was a little bland for my taste by itself. I think that it would be much better with more things added in such as garlic, shrimp, etc.

I thought this recipe was just o.k. Maybe cause we ate it warm instead of cold. Made just as directions stated, but kinda bland.

I modified this recipe quite a bit and my family loved it!  I used fresh herbs, mint, basil & rosemary (what was in my garden) And I added one egg, romano cheese, fresh tomatoes, chicken breast, & chopped artichoke hearts.  Made for a delicious & filling meal.

I thought this was quite tasty, but I had to add some other ingredients. I would suggest the light Italian dressing in place of (or in addition to) the olive oil, and I also added diced tomatoes. I whipped this up, let it sit overnight, and my husband and I have been snacking on it all week!

I have to agree with some other reviewers that without any extra touches this was kind of bland.  I doctored it and it did get better, and I have to admit it definitely tastes better the next day, so give it plenty of time to "marinate" and add seasonings, cheese, or whatever to your tastes and you have a decent recipe.

I thought this was a pretty good recipe. Great starter recipe anyways. I of course tweaked it to my liking and it turned out fabulous. I'm actually making it for supper tonight. A recipe I'm sure i'll be using again, and again. Thanks :D

It was a good basic recipe.  I did tweak it a bit for my family as a good lunch.  Instead of oil, I used 3 TBSP of Italian salad dressing and I also sauteed 1 TBSP of garlic.  I didn't use dried spices, but fresh ones.  If I had them, I would have used flavored bread crumbs just to give it the extra umph.   But I did marinade 2 pieces of chicken and cooked and cut them into pieces for some protein. We each sprinkled a little romano/parmesean cheese on top. This made a good complete lunch and still low cal.  :)

Great quick recipe.  I added feta cheese - which was great.  I only gave it 3 out of five stars because, made so simply you're not gonna have a 5 star quizine.  Spicing it up would definitely get it there though.  I think with maybe some chicken or shrimp along with any kind of olives, it would be so much better.  Fun recipe though.  Really easy to play with.  I will definitely make this again.  I'll definitely be using my own additions though.

I'm glad that I could make a simple pasta dish with just a few items from my pantry.  I thought it was a little bit too dry, although I added two extra tablespoons of olive oil and sauteed garlic & onion.  It might have been better if I put less bread crumbs.  Nevertheless, my family like the dish!

It was asking for some grated parmesan cheese, I added 1/4 cup and more olive oil.  It was served with sautéed summer squashes, onion and garlic.  Perfect supper for a 100 degree day!

For a half a pound of cooked pasta I have always fixed this recipe with 1/4 cup olive oil, 1 smashed garlic clove, heat in a pan till the garlic starts to turn pale gold, remove the garlic and add your herbs.  Add the oil mixture to the pasta, sprinkle with the bread crumbs and mix.  If I use cheese in place of the bread then I am sure to save about a 1/3 cup of pasta water in case the pasta gets "thick" and add this to the hot pasta.

This was utterly bland.  We added some balsamic, which helped, but the bread crumbs made it hard to eat.  If I did make this again I would definitely use fresh herbs, more oil and less bread crumbs.
