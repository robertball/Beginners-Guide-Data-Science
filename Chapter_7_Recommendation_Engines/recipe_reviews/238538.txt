This was really good!  I had to make a few modifications but this Recipe is flexible and handled them just fine.  First I only had 2 HUGE chicken breast halves (for 3 people) so I sliced each of them into 3 pieces.  Then I only had Cream of Mushroom Soup, and I didn't have wine so I used Chicken Broth.  I also had Asiago Cheese, not Swiss.  But these are all very subtle changes which just goes to show you can use what you have on hand, and the dish still turned out great!  With my chicken changes I cooked this for 45 minutes.  I like that it was easy to put together and I was free to do other things while it baked in the oven.  I served it with a side of fresh corn, (the Stuffing and cream was like another side) and everyone loved this dinner!

Let me just say that I am NOT a casserole person. I usually don't make recipes that use "cream of" soups in them. I just never really cared for them ... but on a recent trip to WI, my SIL told me about a recipe that was easy to make and very good. I couldn't recall the exact recipe, but I did an ingredients search on here, and this one came up, and sounded exactly like the one she told me about, so I decided to give it a try. I'm glad I did! This was very tasty, and a perfect Fall comfort food. The only adjustment that I made was I had about a half of a pack of portobella mushrooms in the fridge that needed to be used up, so I sauteed those in 1 Tbls. of butter, and added a bit of chopped parsley, then added the soup and wine. It was a great addition to the recipe, but I'm sure the recipe would have been just as good without them. Yummy!

I gave this recipe five stars, but I wasn't pleased with how I cooked it. I think I would have had a better result if I had baked the four breasts in a dish smaller than a 9x13 and for less than 55 minutes. I used apple juice instead of white wine and I think this was fine. The family enjoyed the dish very much -

This is becoming comfort food in my house. Really no changes. I have used other cheeses - provolone, cheddar - just used what I had on hand, everybody still loves it. 

The only suggestion I have is instead of drizzling the butter on top of the stuffing mix is melt the butter add the stuffing mix to the butter and mix well. This will more evenly spread the butter over the stuffing mix and have a more even browning on top.

Mall my husband has to do is look at a casserole dish or a can of creamed anything and he gets a meat and potato attitude !!!  This looked like great way to use the chicken breasts that I had thawed. (He doesn't like skinless, boneless either... But figured I might as well get it over with all at once!  This was REALLY GOID!!  It's to easy to good!!  My man tried to fuss .. But admitted it was "actually not bad!"  For him... That is a supreme compliment to a "casserole"!!   The rest of us LOVED LOVED LOVED it!   I used   motzerella cheese and it worked great!!  This is a 4 star KEEPER!!  Isn't this just the best place to grab a dinner!!????

Really delicious! Made exactly as written and it was soooo good! Chicken was juicy and the sauce was great. We paired it with some pasta and broccoli, though I think I would've liked it with potatoes. This made for a really easy weeknight meal! Will make again!

This was delicious! Only change i made was using 3 chicken breasts instead of 4 since there was only 3 of us. With the extra room i added cubed potatoes and baked. I am already being asked when i will make it again

Yummy! This was very good and easy to make! I used 3 large chicken breasts with Swiss on top. I seasoned my chicken so I definitely suggest to season the chicken however you prefer. For the soup, I used 1 can cream of chicken with herbs, 1 can cream of mushroom, 1/2 cup chicken broth, a little red wine and apple juice. I used herb stove top stuffing and drizzled butter on top. The stuffing came out evenly browned and crunchy. There was just the right amount of cream to top on the chicken and mashed potatoes. I baked it for 45 minutes and chicken was done and juicy. My kids loved it and it will definitely be a dish I will repeat! Thanks Kristin!

This is a great recipe!  It is super easy to make as well.  I don't like to see people make changes to a great recipe and alter it to the point that it is no longer the original.  With that being said, I was not sure what to do with the leftover stuffing mix so I sprinkled all of it over the soup mixture and then melted the butter with a cup of chicken broth and poured that over the stuffing mix.  Turned out fantastic with stuffing moist, but also with a crunch on top.  Thank you for posting.  My family loves it!

I followed the recipe but had bone in chicken breasts so I cooked them about 10 extra minutes. Lots of flavor and juicy meat. Will make again!

Loved this!  Added 1/2 cup chopped onion and 2 stalks chopped celery on bottom of dish.  I used Havarti cheese, and substituted 1/2 cup apple juice for the white wine.  It turned out perfectly.

My whole family loved this. It had surprisingly very good flavor for its simplicity.  My alteration was to cut up the chicken to bite sizes (due to need to stretch it a bit!) then seasoned with salt, pepper , and poultry seasoning.  I used Baby Swiss and for stuffing, the Pepperidge Farm style that is already crumbles.  I just put pieces of butter across the top instead of melting it (VERY lazy that day).  Very good flavor.  I save easy recipes that taste good to add to a little recipe file that I plan to gift each of my kids when they leave home, and this is being added.

I did not have any white wine on hand, so I subbed a white wine vinegar based salad dressing.  I also used provolone instead of Swiss.  It was great.  I will try it will all of the called for ngredients next time.  It seems like this will work well with different substitutions.

I followed the directions to a T and it came out bangin'.  Everyone loved it , plus since it only uses 1/2 cup of wine I had nearly a full bottle to share with dinner (an added bonus.)  I'll definitely make this bod boy again.

I've had this recipe for over 30 years...it was one of the first 'dishes' I made in college.  It is still a GO TO comfort food dish for me.  I use the same ingredients as the recipe except I do salt and pepper the chicken breasts.  I also stir the stuffing mix into the melted butter, then crumble that mixture over the top.  I've cooked it with seasoned croutons instead of stuffing mix as well.  I cook mine for 45 minutes and it always comes out tasty.  Serve with rice.

I use the whole box of stuffing instead of just one cup.  I also season the chicken a bit before putting the cheese on.  I think it’s better with provolone cheese.  This is a delicious recipe!

I made this recipe and it was wonderful!! The only thing I ADDED was adobo and garlic powder to the chicken on both sides and a small, extra pour of white wine. Usually when people say "white wine" they mean Chardonnay but I felt like it called for a Sauvignon Blanc because of the taste of the Swiss cheese I used (Stop n Shop brand). I also covered the pan with aluminum foil before putting it in the oven. It doesn't say to do that but it came out amazing. Plenty of sauce and the stuffing blended with it perfectly. The perfect winter meal.

This is a fabulous dish for adults and children! I double the Swiss cheese, well actually I double the entire recipe! Just as good the next day microwaved. I cover the pepperage farm dressing with lots of butter. Must rest 15 -20 minutes before serving!

This recipe earned the 5th star because of how easy it is to throw this together.  I cooked 6 breast instead of 4 so I doubled the butter and stuffing, but there still wasn't enough stuffing. Maybe instant stuffing like StoveTop would fluff up more, but using the regular bread stuffing there wasn't enough for a family of 5 to make it a "side".

I'm a big fan of casseroles the past year. Recently diagnosed with Lupus & it's difficult to make a dinner for 6 every night especially when I'm feeling terrible. I love recipes like this cause you can alter them to your families likes and dislikes. I ajusted the recipe by adding 4 tablespoons of sour cream and used garlic onion flavored chicken stock in place of wine(none on hand) Also added used a box of instant rice (riceronni)sprayed pan added rice & flavor packet 1/2 cup stock.  Placed chicken sour cream and cream of chicken soup mix in a Gallon sized freezer bag & mixed. Placed on top of rice adding stove top & crumbled bacon. Turned out so flavorful and the rice is a nice filler. Added peas as a side vegetable which I have also added directly to the casserole to make things super easy. Cooked 45 min on 350 let rest 5-10 min after turning off the oven. My kids like chicken shredded & mixed in but I leave a few whole breast for my husband. Great recipe for a cold night & for large families.

I made this for myself and my husband and only did two pieces, rather than four.  But, it was wonderful in that way even with the extra saucy goodness.  It was delicious and my husband, who usually likes it spicy, even liked it.  I may take this recipe and tweek it for him a bit. Add some spice for him too.

I made the recipe just as directed.  I enjoyed it.  I froze the leftovers and was disappointed at the reheated result.  I'd give it four stars.

The small number of ingredients, ease of preparation, and tasty result makes the recipe at least three stars. I rarely seem to get chicken right, and if I had left this chicken in the over as long as that called for in the recipe, it would have been chewy and overcooked. My meat thermometer indicated the chicken was done after about 40 minutes (160 degrees). I pulled it out of the oven at 160 degrees and the extra five degrees to complete the cooking happened outside of the oven. The flavor is good, better than average, but we are not talking fancy here. It's just a quick and easy dinner when you have chicken to use up.

I'm pretty much a recipe follower, but can adapt when I don't have all the ingredients.  I didn't have cream of chicken soup in the house, so I made a chicken broth roux , didn't have stuffing, but I had  tuscan cheese crackers, that I crushed. For those who think it's bland,  I took it into consideration and used my black pepper/red pepper mix to season, with salt.  Otherwise I did everything the same, I may consider putting the cheese stuffed in the breast next time.  My family loved it, and agreed it goes on the repeat list.

For once, I had all ingredients on hand. Easy and delicious. Made mixed veggies and brown rice as a side because the stuffing was spread kinda thin.  I  used stovetop stuffing mix.

This is a great recipe and very quick and easy to make! I only added a dash of salt and pepper, otherwise followed the recipe as written. I had 3 pretty large boneless chicken breasts which worked out very well.  It was moist with plenty of sauce to go around.  This was awesome. I was afraid it might be too rich but it was not. My husband loved it as well. This is most definitely a keeper!  Thank you, Kristin.

I didn't have wine so used lemon juice. I'm sure the flavor was different, but still so tasty.

Very bland and the chicken was overcooked, if I made this again I would season and probably brown up the breasts first.

My family really liked this a lot.  I did one very minor change because I wanted more stuffing.      I tossed a box of stuffing mix with the half cup of butter and put on top.  Didn't crush it either.    Definitely will make again!

This is a dish my family asks for at least once a month.  It is quick and easy and tastes like you slaved over it for hours.  Keeps my husband appreciating me a little more.  lol

YUM! One of my family's favorites! At 1st I was a bit hesitant about the swiss. I'm not a big fan so I did experiment as others did but in my opinion it never seems to come out as good. The flavor of the swiss is meant to blend with the wine so just give it a shot before you change it :) Make sure you buy the crushed stuffing. I bought the cubed once & ruined it. It doesn't soak up the sauce/butter like it should. It was dry and rock hard. I do like more sauce though! I use 8oz swiss slices (most brands are 8oz packages) 2 cans cream of chicken, 1/2 cup white wine, 1 1/4 cup herb-flavored crushed stuffing mix with about 6 tbsp melted butter. We love to pour the sauce over our side of mashed potatoes :) You could play with it to your liking just don't over do the stuffing as it will dry it out.  In closing my last tip is for people like me who cook with wine but don't care for it in a glass. When I first started making this recipe I would just buy a single bottle of chardonnay without much thought.  The recipe calls for very little so the remainder of the bottle just went to waste. At one point a light bulb went off & I thought to buy a Sutter Home 4 pack (chardonnay) for close to the same price! It works out perfect! There is little waste (remember I double the sauce) & 3 more small unopened bottles for the future! :) Hope my suggestions were useful! Enjoy!

This came out tasting very odd to me. Only changes I made were exchanging cream of chicken for mushrooms and pepper jack cheese instead of Swiss. Disappointed.

Made this today and it was a big hit. Will definitely make again. I did crumble some fried bacon bits over the cheese before I added the soup mixture.
