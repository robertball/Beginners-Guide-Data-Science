This was pretty good, followed the recipe as written with all ingredients & no additional to see how it handled. This was my first attempt at this type of frosting & I wasn't super clear on how long it should take to reach different stages other than what was written which was a little vague. Ended up cooking until it was as described (thicker & bubbly) but it took longer than the 3 minutes described. Since I only have store/bakery versions to compare to, this set up a little more solidly than I would have preferred & I ended up adding a few drops of milk to make it more pliable & easy to work with. Overall, definitely would recommend giving this a shot based on the simple ingredients, ease of preparation & flavor. It is a pretty tasty frosting & the solidity may have been in part to my inexperience; thanks for sharing!

I wanted this icing to top off a chocolate bundt cake. I had slightly less than 1 full cup of pecans, & I also added a dash of vanilla...otherwise I used the quantities listed. I cooked it on medium heat for 3 mins, then lowered the heat & cooked for 2 more mins. It tastes fantastic & the texture is exactly right. I let it cool for about 5 mins before icing my cake. I would likely double the recipe for a layered cake, but there was plenty for the bundt cake. This recipe was quick, easy, & delicious! I will use it again & again. Thank you for the recipe!

Didn't make enough to cover my 9x13 inch cake so I kind of spread it thin.  Very tasty though.  Next time I'll double the recipe.  Thanks for sharing this very easy recipe.  :)

Easy and delish.  I made as recommended in recipe, except I added a little salt after tasting, which enhanced the flavor.  It's a keeper!

After following the directions given, I wasn't happy with the consistency, it was a bit more solid then what I'm familiar with. Sooo, I added a bit of whipping cream to smooth out the texture. The taste is not what I expected but it will do great as a filling for my cupcakes and brownies. I plan to mix it in my ice cream,  just to see how useful this particular recipe is.

I followed the recipe amounts exactly. It was delicious and a big hit with the family! And definitely easy. It did take longer than the directions state. It was about 5-7 minutes for me. Iâ€™m attributing the longer time to my high altitude location.

This was my first time ever making my own icing and using this recipe made it all that much better! It turned out great. I did double the recipe just in case for a 9x13 came and I am glad I did! Very easy and delicious recipe, thanks for sharing!

The frosting came out great! I increased my ingredients to match the box cake mix. I also added 1/2 cup of white sugar.

I loved it. I only made half of recipe. I made a double recipe of the simple coffee mug cake in a dish. I made it again but didn't have pecans but it was still great.

Perfect just the way it is. Once it reached a boil I continued to let it boil and stired continuously for 3-4 minutes. Let it cool to thicken then poured it on the cake. It's a delicious blend of coconut and caramel flavors!

Made this all as called for, but subbed milk for cashew milk due to a milk allergy. I read that most people found this recipe to be too thick, but with the cashew milk I think it turned out perfectly.

I had less than a cup of the coconut that the recipe calls for. The recipe took long to thicken and didn't fully come to the consistency I think it should be. It was a bit watery and slid off the sides of the bundt cake. If I'd had time, I probably would have allowed it to thicken in the fridge.  We used the extra to drizzle on the cake. I was expecting it to be sweeter, but my grandkids did enjoy it.

I made it had to cook it longer to get it to the right consistancy.  After a few mins, the frosting started sliding down the side of the cake onto the plate. The taste was good but not sure about how to frost the cake like that,.

I will try this frosting again, although next time I will decrease the brown sugar.  The brown sugar flavor overpowers all of the other ingredients.

I found myself wanting to know the temperature that I was shooting for in this recipe.  I was a little skeptical that it would turn out and I wasn't psyched about starting over with new ingredients.  I followed the recipe exactly, well, I may have let it cook just a bit more because I didn't use my timer.  But, I didn't go way over like some of the other reviewers and it turned out perfectly!  It was spreadable and yummy!  I will make this again because the hubster LOVES German Chocolate Cake and it usually takes me all day to make one with the traditional family recipe.

I cooked the frosting longer then 3 minutes.  More like 15 minutes to give a nice consistency. Perfect!!! 
May want to double the recipe to frost entire cake.
