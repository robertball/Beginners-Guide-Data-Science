I made it! But yes I tweaked the recipe a bit, I used fresh mussels instead of clams, I added a quarter cup of diced carrots with the onion and a can of diced tomatoes with the garlic... DELICIOUS!!! YAYYY  making a staple!

This is a very easy, super delicious recipe from Chef John. There was an abundance of clams and broth. A large meal for two. I made it exactly as written, but I may make a couple of revisions next time. First, I felt it lacked some “brightness,” so I’ll add a touch of vinegar or lemon to the broth. The other thing is that I may buy uncooked chorizo, then cook and drain it before adding it. Not sure about that because the smoked chorizo I bought came out nicely in the dish. This was a great dish, and easy to clean up afterwards.

AH-MAZIING and ohhh, so easy!! My local grocery store didn’t have any clams so I used mussels instead. I also added a bit of chopped celery, a touch of cilantro and Worcheshire sauce. And salt. O-M-G good!

This turned out to be outstanding. I did not have any Chorizo so I used Andouille sausage instead and it came out better than any clam dish I ever had. I added no salt to this dish.

It was delicious. I made it with mussels and will be making it many more times. Good chorizo makes everything taste better!!

This was very easy to make and highly delicious! My only suggestion would be to get a nice crusty bread to dip in the leftover broth.

Great recipe, easy to make. Followed Chef John's recipe as is. It took my little neck clams about 11 min. to cook/open. Served with grilled bread cut to 3/4" thick. Winner winner!!

Wonderful, I only had hot Italian sausage and beautiful Manila large clams.  Added a little lemon pepper and dried red peppers.  Nice balance.  Try it and put your own twist to it.  Drank more of the white wine along with it.  Cheers

Delicious way to serve fresh steamed clams.  I used large Cherry Stone clams, chorizo (without the skin) and minced garlic.  It was fabulous!  Made it again the next day for a friend, only the cherry stone clams were medium size.  I'll definitely keep this recipe in my kitchen!
