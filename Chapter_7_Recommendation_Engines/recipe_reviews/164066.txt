I was pleasantly surprised by this recipe! The ingredients sounded like they would either go together well or not at all. Overall, I ended up adding some diced red bell pepper to the top at the end, and I did not cook the green onion - without this, it wasn't the most appetizing looking dip, but was quite lovely with some color. Also, in the future, I would add a few more shrimp. This will serve 3-4 people as a generous appetizer, so even though it says 12 servings, I would count on that making enough for just a few people. Overall, with some presentation help, and making sure you don't want to serve 12 people with it - this was a nice recipe. Thanks!

Didn't have sliced black olives so used chopped...end result was "tastes like heaven, looks like hell".  Sliced olives are a definite for presentation!  To help the appearance of my creation I added a rib of celery, diced very fine and some parsley flakes.  This recipe is extremely tasty and I will make with the sliced olives next time and all the times afterwards.  Thanks for sharing a great appetizer!!!!

Very creative approach to using Shrimp.  If you are blue cheese lover this is a dream recipe...however if not, I'd cut the amount  of blue cheese in half or eliminate it.  I happen to like blue cheese a lot but even I found it to be very good "but" it does over power the shrimp.  I would make it again but probably reduce the blue cheese a little, I also added 2 tbls. of lemon when it's cooking to give it a little zip.

I made it as written and didn't/wouldn't change a thing. I didn't know that I liked blue cheese. Wonderful!

I have made this dip a few times, and I love it! It has many of my favorite ingredients - shrimp, olives, blue cheese - and I was actually quite surprised by how well they all blended together.

We called this ugly dip, but man was it good.  I was cooking bacon, so I cooked the shrimp (used medium and cut them up)in the bacon grease and added a crumbled strip to it. I didn't do the last few minutes of cooking because I took it to a party and re-heated it in the microwave and didn't want to overcook the shrimp.  Next time I will probably throw a jalepeno in for a little kick.
