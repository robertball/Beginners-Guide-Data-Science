I'm giving this four stars only because I changed it to use what I had on hand. I'd like to give it ten stars, because as I made it, it's delicious! I made the recipe by half for my small family of two, but still wound up getting 5 good sized patties out of it, plus about a half patty worth of "tester" mix. I used brown lentils because that's what I had, which took a bit longer to cook. I had some mashed sweet potato on hand, nuked the broccoli, used some precooked kale I had, and cooked the onion in a little butter (which didn't matter, cause I forgot the olive oil). I blended all the veggies and lentils into a paste with my immersion blender, and used one egg and cracker crumbs instead of the flour paste (that's the way I always make veggie patties). I didn't use the vegetable seasoning because I didn't know what it is, only salt and pepper.  I fried my tester patties in oil, but plan to bake the patties I've pre-formed for tonight's dinner, as I find any veggie patty seems to hold together better after setting up in the fridge. They came out really delicious; I am pleased to have another veggie patty option for my repertoire.Update, 2/14/17: I just made these again, except as written, with the spinach. I don't know what kind of portions people out there are eating, but I made the full recipe, which is supposed to serve four. It made TWELVE patties. Are folks eating triple patty meals?

I didn't have the required amount of spinach but I still really enjoyed them.  I, personally, should put in less pepper next time.  Mine were baked in the oven for the healthier option... definitely will cook them that way again!

It is a good recipe but I made it twice, I roughly the first time I fried the patties the second time I baked them, and they are a lot easier to manage when baking. They seemed to fal apart easily when frying. I also suggest using one egg and no flour because the concoction was more patty ready-like than pancake batter-like with two eggs and flour.

These were just ok when I made them and I made exact to the recipe. But I baked the leftovers in the oven the next day with a little more cheese on top and they came out great. Don't expect an attractive looking patty, but expect good taste and good for you!
