This is an excellent dish....just like my mother used to make, complete with the juniper berries. Very German...warm comfort food. Sometimes Mom would throw in a diced apple and as you said bratwurst or polish sausage.

9-2-2018 ~Whenever we have sauerkraut, there’s always a debate/battle in this house.  Hubs prefers it cold, straight out of the can or package, while I prefer it mellowed out, usually with a little brown sugar, onion and bacon grease.  I won this time. This recipe was right up my alley, and what I noticed about it immediately was that it seemed to call for less sugar (I used brown) than other recipes.  I also liked the additions of juniper berries, cloves and bay leaf, which gave the finished sauerkraut more complexity.  What I did differently, and I’m glad I did, was add less than half the beef broth called for. Even with that reduced amount, the sauerkraut was plenty liquid-y, and would have been swimming in liquid had I not.  I also omitted the caraway seeds – Hubs doesn’t care for them and I didn’t want to push my luck. The biggest takeaway from this for us was that Hubs loved it.  Imagine that!  I can only surmise that since it had such a small amount of sugar that the sauerkraut still had the “sour” he loves.

Very good. I added 1 Granny Smith apple sliced. I did not peel it. I  also used pork broth (homemade) instead of beef. After it was cooked in the slow cooker, I made a bed of it in my roasting pan and put a half pork loin on top. My sauerkraut lovers loved it! Will make again. Next time I might try some Polish Sausage in it.

Not sure why everyone raved about this sauerkraut.  Not too flavorful, quite wet, and a bit too much on the onion side.  It wasn't bad, but it definitely wasn't inspiring the taste buds to go for seconds.  Hopefully day two it will be better . . . .
