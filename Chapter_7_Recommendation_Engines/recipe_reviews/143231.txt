Loved the sauce!  I cooked the chicken breasts in olive oil in a skillet, then removed them.  I added a yellow onion and sauted with the garlic.  I used sundried tomatoes soaked in oil and chopped them small.  I used part milk and a can of evaporated milk to make it creamier.  Loved the ease of cooking with the fancy taste!

I made this last night for supper and it was excellent.  I used two chicken breasts for the two of us but kept the sauce amounts as per the recipe.  The only change I made was to microwave the chicken breasts rather than bake as per the instructions.  Next time I will just chop the sun dried tomatoes and add them to the sauce without prior cooking.  I will also try it without the italian seasoning and add some chili flakes.  I served this with tricolor elbow pasta.  Thanks for sharing.

Very very good. I baked the chicken, and added mushrooms and two and a half tablespoons of grated romano cheese to the sauce. If you add too many sundried tomatoes it will probably be too salty. I put it over pasta and everyone loved it!

Wow!  This recipe is delicious!  I bake the chicken slightly at 325 and then add the sauce mix, cover and return to the oven at 325 for 45 minutes.  Awesome flavor!

I thought this recipe was wonderful following some advice given by previous raters. I used 4 chicken breasts and baked them sesoned with Italian seasoning, Cavenders Greek seasoning, salt, pepper, and garlic salt. I added the onions and sun dried tomatoes in oil and sherry cooking wine to the sauce and about a half cup of parmesan cheese. Once the sauce was done, I added it to the pan the chicken was cooked in and covered with foil and baked for 20 min more, then uncovered and let sit in the still hot oven for 20 min more. I served over angel hair pasta! I also used cream of mushroom soup since I didn't have cream of chicken. I used the evaporated milk and 1% milk equally. This was yummy!

This was terrible. I followed the directions exactly as written. 1st it was thick and pasty, I tried to fix that by adding more milk but that didn't fix the flavor. I tried to fix it by adding anything I could think of but all I did was waste the money I spent on the ingredients. 
I couldn't get my husband or my kids to eat any of it. They ended up having a bowl of cereal for dinner instead. :(

This was a very nice dish and the whole family enjoyed it!  I did use marinated sun dried tomatoes, and used the oil to saute the chicken in.  That gave it extra flavor.  Will make again.

This is delicious- very flavorful and easy to make. I added a bit more seasoning, pepper and chopped red pepper. I also doubled the milk and added pecorino/parm cheese based on other reviews. I simmered it a bit long and the sauce thinned out. Would perhaps not summer as long, but it was still delicious!

This recipe is excellent...I did double the milk then I added about 2 tbsp. of half and half and served it over rice. Oh I did add a little more sun dried tomatoes too! Even my picky husband liked it!..I will be making this again.

I was amazed at how good this was.  I used the sun dried tomatoes in oil and processed them with a little of their oil.  A fabulous chicken recipe.

I added 2 Tbls. of cooking sherry to the sauce--yummy. I also took others advise and finely chopped the sun dried tomatoes instead of puree.  I made the entire recipe for only 4 chicken breasts and served over rice.

This chicken is incredible -- the sauce is very rich. We had sun-dried tomatoes soaked in oil, so just chopped 'em up and put them into the sauce. This chicken tasted wonderful with twice-baked potatoes, and it tasted even better the next day! I've been chomping at the bit to cook this again. You simply must try it.

Wow! This recipe was very flavorful, and quite easy to make. Everyone loved it. I did make a couple of changes to the recipe. I cooked the chicken in some olive oil and the seasonings on the cooktop, then put the chicken aside. In the same pan, I cooked the garlic per the recipe. I used the sundried tomatoes in a jar with oil and just chopped them up. I served with a side of pasta and a garden salad. Mmmm!  I will definitely make this dish again.

I don't like reviewing my own recipes...but adding two tablespoons of Pecorino-Romano really adds a lot of flavor to this recipe.

It was amazing how little flavor this had for how much seasoning is in it. It wasn't bad. It was NOT great. It was....okay.

I read all the reviews before attempting this recipe. I pureed the sundried tomatoes before adding them to the soup mixture.It was too pungent and the sauce too thick.

This was okay.  A bit too cream of chicken soup-tasting for my liking (maybe because I added the sun-dried tomatoes chopped instead of blending).  I might try it again using heavy cream in place of the soup and see how it turns out.  Also I didn't like the two steps to cook the chicken; next time will cook entirely on the stove top.

This recipe was very good. Even my fussy 19 yr. old like it! I pounded the chix breast before cooking to make sure it would be done and tender enought to cut with a fork. The sauce is fabulous although I don't like "browned" garlic - I just cooked it enough to be tender.  I served the chicken and sauce over fetuccini. YUM!

I used many of the tips the other reviewers had posted and this turned out amazingly!  I should have made 6 servings for the 2 of us because my boyfriend at all of the leftovers after I went to bed!  Served over brown rice with a side salad.  This is now one of my top recipes!

Great flavor!   Used dried tomatoes from our garden last fall and followed the recipe just about exactly except added some diced onions in to sauté with the garlic.   My husband compared the flavor to a vodka sauce.   Next time, might add some more liquid to sauce so it's not so thick.

Hmmm...  I was not a fan of this.  Much too thick, and just not all that good, in my opinion.  I had high hopes, but won't make it again.

This was pretty good. I didn't cook the tomatoes prior, just chopped them up and used them in the sauce. I already had some grilled chicken left over from the night before, so I just poured the sauce over the warmed chicken. Served with bow tie pasta. Next time I will add more seasoning (or at least salt). Was a little less "sun-dried tomato" tasting than I thought it would be.

So easy and tasty!  I used 2 chicken breast and used the rest of the sauce for Pasta I made (I added a picture). I diced the sun dried tomato's added some water and heated them in the microwave so I wouldn't have to boil them. It worked very well. Most of the water was absorbed into them so I didn't have to drain any of it.  I also didn't puree them. I just added them to the sauce.  I would like to try this recipe with half and half to eliminate the cream of chicken soup (but haven't done it yet). It was great, I felt like I was eating out at an Italian Restaurant! Will make again for sure.

This recipe was GREAT! I used a can of mushroom soup because I didn't have the chicken soup. I also had sun dried tomatos in a jar and did not cook them first. I put them in a food processor and then added them to the sauce. This recipe was EASY and delicious!

My picky 11 yr old loved this dish, he was the only one.  I won't be preparing this again.
