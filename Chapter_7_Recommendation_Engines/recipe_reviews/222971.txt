I am the submitter of this recipe.  It is not necessary to make a large quantity if you don't make coconut shrimp often.  Mixing these 3 ingredients to your liking makes for a great coconut shrimp dip.  I like to make ahead and freeze in 2 oz. containers so I can just pull what I need.  Thank you to all who take the time to try my recipe!  There is a recipe for "Slam dunk butterflied coconut shrimp" in my recipe box that is still a personal recipe, but I am happy to share.  Feel free to help yourself!

This truly is a slam dunk recipe. I love how simple and unbelievably easy it is to make. The fact that there is no cooking required is a huge plus when cooking in a hurry. This literally took me 2 minutes and the flavor was perfect and absolutely delicious. I used orange marmalade instead of apricot because that's what I had in my pantry but will try it with apricot next time.

I had some leftover canned pineapple chunks which I lightly pulsed in a small food processor. Also kicked it up a bit by adding about twice the recommended amount of horseradish. Easy and delicious!
