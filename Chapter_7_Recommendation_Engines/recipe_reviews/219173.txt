After browsing reviews I decided to write my own because I have been seeing a lot of comments regarding the 'doneness' of the roast. I think many people are perhaps not understanding that pot roast is pot roast. It is not roast beef, it doesn't get cooked med rare, or med, etc. It gets cooked until it is sooo cooked that it falls apart. Roast beef is cooked to one's taste as rare, med rare, med. It is then sliced & usually served with au jus. Pot roast is pot roast, roast beef is roast beef, they are two different entities, period. Also, adding cups of beef stock and red wine to cover the roast is simply boiling the meat. If that's the way one decides to cook it, one prob shouldn't even bother with a mirepoix or browning the roast, etc. That said, I LOVE the simplicity of this recipe. Delicious, tender and easy to prepare. Yum.

Excellent!  A crock pot pot roast afficiando, this was my first attempt at an actual oven baked pot roast.  I'm used to using quite a bit of liquid, so I wasn't too sure about this.  Delicious!!!!  I made a couple of minor adjustments...seasoned the meat with seasoning salt and Monterey Steak for flavor.  Added sweet potato chunks and whole "new potatoes" to the veggies. (I had a 2 lb roast so there was plenty of room).  Threw two whole cloves of garlic on top of the meat.  The veggies melted together into the most sensational "mush", it was heavenly....the meat was juicy and tender.  Definately deserves 5 stars!

This was simple and full of flavor.  I didn't need any beef stock and the meat was just melt in your mouth!  I have been looking for a good pot roast recipe for many, many years.  Thank you soo much!!  Looks like I found it!

Delicious! Super easy, stress free Sunday dinner. Everyone loved it. Followed the recipe pretty close except increased the servings to 9 (had a 5 pd roast) and used apprx 1 tsp fresh rosemary and 1 tsp fresh thyme. Also added baby new red potatoes and a few fingerlings about 1/2 hour before servings. Perfect. This will be my new go to pot roast recipe. Thanks for sharing!

So easy to make!  I wasn't good at following the recipe as i added too much rosemary.  I also couldn't figure out the meat as i am in New Zealand and we use different names but i used a cheapish meat.  I don't think i could say it has heaps of flavour but a nice easy dish.  I had it reheated the next day and i think it tasted even better!  I had the leftovers with horseraddish and gravy which was lovely.  I'm also going to make yorkshire puddings which i think will go well with this.  I will deffinetly make this again, maybe with less rosemary!  Loved being able to watch the video too, your drawings were awesome! :-)  Thanks

I added just a touch of beef broth to the bottom of the pan only because I was afraid of the vegetables burning on the bottom of the pan. I do not have a dutch oven, just a regular glass baking dish. What I did was assemble the vegetables on the bottom of the dish, laying the roast on top and then I covered the whole top of the dish with foil. After baking, I used the pan juices to make a small amount of pan gravy. This was good but I really missed the addition of garlic. When I make this again, I'll add garlic.

Made it exactly as Chef John instructed in his video 3 weeks in a row, once for family twice for company.  Presentation and taste was a big hit.  Many recipe requests.  I was almost embarrased to say how easy it was to prepare!  My kids give this one 5 1/2 Stars!

Amazing! I didn't believe you could make pot roast (which is really braising) without adding at least some liquid. This had over 30 positive ratings, though, so I tried it. It really worked. The moisture in the vegetables was enough to cook the meat perfectly without boiling it. I served it just like in the video and my husband and I loved it.  The next day I removed most of the chilled solid fat from the surface, chopped up the remaining meat, and stirred some canned tomatoes and beef broth in with the meat and softened vegetables to make a thick and satisfying soup. This is my new go-to pot roast. Thank you, Chef John!

Wow! This turned out nice and tender. I modified this a bit to use ingredients I had on hand. I used green peppers instead of celery, coriander instead of rosemary and added garlic. As the title suggests this roast was simple and turned out great!  Chef John posted this Simple Beef Pot Roast with a video and put it on horseradish mashed potatoes. I had never heard of making mashed potatoes with horseradish, but used in moderation was surprisingly yummy with the roast. I will sure make both again!

I followed this recipe exactly, except I increased the quantity of vegetables, would say I tripled it.  It is so good!  I made plain mashed potatoes though.  We loved it as a roast.  The next day, I added some gravy to the leftover vegetables, diced up the leftover beef and made a pie, like a shepherd's pie (though beef), using the leftover mashed potatoes on top.  I added some parmesan cheese into the mashed potatoes and then sprinkled some on top when it was nearly done.  And.... I did not have to use all of the meat/vegetable/gravy mixture so I saved it and with the help of canned chopped tomatoes and beef consommé (and some additional potatoes and onions) made delicious soup.  Three meals out of Chef John's fantastic simple beef pot roast recipe.  Note, I did have about a 4.5 pound beef roast.  Every permutation of it was a winner!

I followed the recipe as written and it was simple and delicious.  This cooking method tenderized the meat wonderfully, without any need for a tenderizing marinade, allowing the flavor of the meat to be fully appreciated.  The vegetables were very tasty and tender as well - no surprise I guess as they were cooked in butter.  Next time I will increase the amount of vegetables so we can enjoy more of them!

An excellent recipe for this type of roast. Those that complained that it was too well cooked.........well a pot roast is supposed to be cooked a long time.   If you want a roast of beef (e.e. standing rib or sirloin) you do not cover it and it is a completely different type of cooking. Thanks for one of the few pot roasts that turn out very tender and still do not taste as tho it was stewed.    Highly recommend this recipe and even a beginner cook will have total success if they follow his directions and not what they think.

Fantastic. Because I tripled the vegetables, I was able to sneak in a cup of diluted beef 'better-than-bouillon' added to the cooked veg's without the roast sitting in the liquid as it baked.  Beef Shoulder roast is ideal:  even big chain supermarkets' meat dept. guys will be happy to cut a perfect roast for you, even when it's on sale.  I always call ahead and explain "about 4 pounds, trimmed lean, not gross"...etc.

I have been making pot roast for MANY years yet I am still always searching for a different way to season it.  Well, I have finally found the ONLY WAY I will ever make it again. I made it EXACTLY as written and couldn't have been more pleased.  When we were through with dinner there were still vegetables and liquid in the bottom of the pot so I added a cup of water and some flour and made gravy that I used last night when I made hot roast beef sandwiches with the leftover beef.

This is INCREDIBLE! My husband loved it so much, the next time I was searching to try "something new" he said he wanted the same recipe as last time, which was this one. I did add potatoes and it was GREAT!

roast had a good flavor but was definately overcooked for my liking (non of it was rare or even medium rare, I'd say all was medium to well done). I only cooked it for 2.5 hours and the roast was 3.6 pds.  If it tried it again, I'd cook it less or maybe even at a lower temperature

I primarily used this recipe because it didnt call for onion soup mix (so tired of it) and for the cooking instructions. For the life of me I couldnt find the rosemary so I used a generic no salt seasoning blend and salted and peppered the meat and veggies separate. It gave it a nice flavor.

I was too lazy to wash the stew pot I would usually use and used an anodized aluminum 5 qt saute pan with oven safe handles. You must brown the meat or it will lack flavor. I just tossed it all in the oven after browning. DO NOT ADD A LIQUID or your meat will steam and not roast. I cooked mine for 3 hrs and the veggies did not burn at 275*.

The reason for 4 stars. If you dice the veggies it makes them inedible because they are mush and full of grease. Roasted carrots and celery are yummy. I cut the celery and carrots into 3-4" whole pieces, the onions into large quartered slices (much faster too) and added enough peeled and quartered potatoes for enough servings for the amount of people. These are also very yummy roasted. I really dont think its necessary to cook the veggies down so much before putting the roast in. I did brown them up a bit on the stove top but didnt cook them thoroughly. YOu dont want to draw all the flavor out of the carrots. They will get plenty of cook time in the oven. Because there is so much grease from the meat and  cooking the veggies you don't really end up with gravy. The roasted potatoes dont need gravy just a little butter.

I think this was delicious! I always made roasts in a slow cooker, but I got this fancy dutch oven and wanted to try it this way. I added about 3 tbsp of Worcestershire sauce when the vegetables were sauteing, and about a 1/3c of water. I cooked my 2.6lb roast for only an hour and a half in the oven and then left it in there with the heat off for about another hour, covered. This roast is juicier than ones I get from the crock pot. My boyfriend said "No offense, but I didn't realize how dry your other roasts were until I tried this one." I agreed. Very, very happy with this recipe. Will keep making.

Best pot roast I have ever made.    Tried many different recipes but this the best, roast was moist and very tender.    I added potatoes, and grated in 2 cloves of garlic.    I served half of the vegetables ( excluding the potatoes) and mashed the remaining and used them in the gravy and the gravy was very tasty.   Will use this recipe from now on.

This was the best roast I have had in a long time. So simple and I think that is why we liked it so much. We burned out on recipes adding so much the roast gets overpowered. My roast was just big enough for the 2 of us but I used the full amount of vegetables, I would add even more next time. So good! The only change I would make would be to use a bit less butter but this is a spot-on delicious pot roast! Thanks, Chef John! UPDATE: I took LeeluDallas's suggestion and chopped the left over meat, combined the leftover veggie mixture & meat with a can of diced tomatoes and beef broth for a nice hearty soup. It's also something nice to throw in the freezer for the future.

I made this for dinner tonight and it is amazing. Even my super picky 5 year old boy loved it. I had less roast and more veges and changed it up just a bit. I cut up 1 medium onion + about 1/2 of another and used most of a big bag of baby carrots. I added 5 or so whole cloves of garlic too. I did not have celery. I followed the recipe, adding the garlic in with the other veges. When it was time to season I added some dryed thyme (instead of rosemary, just didnt have it on hand) (eyeball it), sea salt, pepper, and 1/2 package of onion soup mix. I also added just a pinch of celery seed. Just a tiny pinch did the trick. (Celery seed is a strong spice so be careful). I placed the meat back in the dutch oven and put it in the oven for 30 minutes. Once some gravy had formed (and it will) I cut up 3 potatoes in large chunks with some skin still on. I cooked it until done, checking on it every 30 minutes and carefully stiring some to make sure the potatoes have a change to get down in the gravy. I added some pepper and thyme close to the end. The flavor was amazing but not overwhelming. I am sure the recipe is great as is but I like to change things up and use what i have. This will be replacing my crock pot recipe for roast. It is just as easy as the crock pot and could probably be adapted for the crock.

I have been making Pot Roast the wrong way for 35 years.  I feel like a DOPE!  OMG, this was too easy and too good to be true.  The only changes I made was I used a 2.5 pound roast (Angus Chuck Roast) and that was it.  I was reluctant to add 1 tsp of rosemary but went ahead and used it.  Boy, I can't believe how well this turned out!  I may have added 1 TBSP of water that was on the plate that I had transferred the roast onto but in the end, after checking for doneness, there was more than enough liquid and I could kick myself for having added so much liquid in the past.  The diced veggies were perfectly done.  I used Chef John's recipe and video to make his mashed potatoes (I didn't make the horseradish mashed potatoes) and felt equally stupid when I realized I've been making mashed potatoes incorrectly, too, for all these years! The roast was enough for 5 adults (3 of whom were very large and hungry men).  I will never make it any other way.  It was amazing!  Be sure to follow his instructions to season the meat thoroughly as this will add flavor and enhance the veggies, as well.  PERFECTION!!

I am not a great cook and I was looking for something that would make me look like a star cooking dinner for my boyfriend. I have made roasts a few times using various means, slow cooker, in the bakers dish w/ the little bag w/ the mix, etc., and this one by far came out the best.  I doubled the vegetables and I'm glad that I did, b/c the veggies are definitely the best part of the dish and it would really not be enough if I had not doubled it. For the carrots, I used 1 cup diced carrots and 1 cup whole baby carrots so that there were some bigger veggies you could actually sink your teeth into.  I'm normally not a fan of celery but the celery all gooeyed up in the sauce was scrumptious and gave the dish a lot of flavor.  The roast itself was tender and came out nice, but it was definitely pouring the carmelized veggies on top after it cooked that made it a winner.  One thing I would disagree about is the claim that this pot roast is "easy".  I admit that I'm not a great chef, but with all of the slicing and dicing of vegetables and the required searing before putting it in the oven, this is definitely not a quick prep/throw it together thing. I spent around 45 mins doing the prep including the veggies, the searing etc.  "Easy" pot roast is either throwing it all in the crock pot with some onion soup or putting it in the bakers dish with the plastic and the bag of premade seasoning.  This is true homemade pot roast, but given that I definitely had a feeling of accomplishment.

This was outstanding! I've always wanted try a pot roast in the oven and after this I'll never use a crockpot again! I followed the recipe exactly, like I always do. I'm baffled by some of the asinine comments and reviews. Pot roast is not roar beef or standing rib roast. It's not supposed to be rare or medium rare. It's supposed to fall apart with a fork.

Cold weather food !  It's so satisfying when something so simple  turns out perfect and tastes so good.  15 minutes of prep and you're done! Serve with mashed potatoes and make a gravy from the juices left in the pan.

A very simple recipe that creates a mouth-watering pot roast with a lovely gravy. I made this to recipe, except that I added extra carrots and onions. For those that worried about the veg burning, you shouldn't; the roast saturates them with plenty of juices.

The only hitch I had was cooking time. I am in the UK and using a gas mark oven. 135C is gas mark 1, but I found that, after the instructed three hours, the meat was still tough and wasn't breaking apart when I applied a fork. That was easily remedied by returning it to the oven for approx two more hours. (Unlike with roast beef, if a pot roast looks done but feels tough and solid (i.e., what some might think is "overcooked"), then it isn't done enough. Pot roast is a food of patience that is designed to be cooked at a low temperature over a long period of time. When it's done, it falls deliciously apart.) 

I served it with Chef John's horseradish mashed potatoes, and the flavours all worked beautifully together.

Loved it. Prepared it exactly as written and the meat fell apart and the veggies were perfect. Making it for the second time tonight because my four year old requested it a few days ago.

Very tasty & easy! I think that adding butter was a great idea since I included chunky  potatoes. Cooked a 1.5 lb roast for 2 hrs.

Cooking the roast in a mix of veggies really makes a difference and adds a sweetness, I think,  to pot roast.  It was very good, but when I tasted it to check to see if I needed to correct the seasoning, I thought something was missing.  So I sprinkled it with about 1 1/2 - 2 tablespoons of worcestershire sauce and cooked it for about a half hour more.  That did the trick and put the recipe into the 5 star category (with worcerstershire).

I've made this twice. DO NOT Salt the veggies when sauteing...makes them too salty!  This is overall very easy and the slow cooking makes for a great roast!

This was so easy to do and turned out perfectly even though I didn't have any celery in the house and it was storming out, so I didn't want to make a trip to the store just for celery. I increased the carrots (1 lb diced) and onion (about 2 cups) and threw in some celery flakes with the rosemary. I added some peeled and cut up red potatoes around the edges of the beef and cooked as directed. It was awesome but just what I would expect from Chef John. If you haven't tried his version of French Onion soup yet, do so. I'll never use any other recipe than his again. Yummy stuff!

I followed the instructions the first time I made this.  The end result was okay, but not spectacular.  The second time, I made some modifications.  Brown the roast as indicated, then saute your veggies, including the onion, scraping the brown bits off of the bottom of the pan.  When the onions are almost done, add the butter (and you don't need a full 1/4 cup, maybe 2 Tbsp), and add 2 cloves of minced garlic.  Saute until fragrant but not brown, a couple of minutes max.  Add 2 Tbsp of Italian seasoning to the veggies and stir.  It sounds like a lot, but it gives great flavor.  Add your roast back in, then pour in 4 C. beef broth and 1/2 C. red wine.  I like to make sure my roast is submerged in the liquid, so that it can soak up all the flavor.  Optional is to add a couple of potatoes cut into a large dice right before you put the roast back into the pan.  Bake as instructed.  Will your roast be medium to medium-rare?  Probably not, but it will taste good and be fall apart tender.  :)

My first attempt at an oven baked pot roast and it couldn’t have been easier. I think my wife and I were surprised more at the fact that no beef stock or water was added. The natural juices from the roast are all that’s needed! The celery, carrots and onions take the flavor from the beef and l think I might add potatoes next time. This is definitely my new “go-to” pot roast recipe. I only wish I would have found and tried this sooner. Don’t hesitate, try this one.

I make this recipe all the time. I have also used pork roast instead and cooked it the same. I also like to add more onion to the pot because I love onions! It always comes out delicious. I have found the degrees of perfection depend on how you cook the salt/peppered meat in the oil before it goes int the oven. Always delicious and a house favorite!

When I made this dish it was my first time doing a roast oven baked. the only thing I did differently was I added minced garlic to the onions, carrots and celery. The meat came out so tender it just fell apart beautifully. And the dried rosemary really added that special flavor. I'm making it again tonight but I am going to add a little more seasoning to the beef. Although the dish was absolutely delicious as was...I felt like the beef itself could have used a little more flavoring! Definitely a favorite! M

If you like root veggies,  beets and parsnips are a nice addition to the ingredient list. This dish really shouldn't be as delicious as it is for a simple as it is. Best pot roast recipe our family has ever had.

This was excellent!  I did mine in a slow cooker.  Prepared the dish exactly as outlined, except I put on top of a cut up onion in the slow cooker at 250 for about 7 hours.  It was AMAZING!  The entire family loved it.  Even my picky son!!!  Will make this a regular dish in our home!

Delicious!  This was amazing!  Just made it this evening.  Followed the recipe but doubled the veggies and butter because we wanted left overs to make in a soup tomorrow.  We still can't believe how good the diced up vegetables with their juices tasted over the potatoes.  My husband always has to have gravy but he said this was absolutely delicious.  I even stirred some horseradish into my potatoes like Chef John did.  Never did that before but we loved that too.  Thank you Chef John for an unforgettable recipe that I am anxious to serve to guests.

Add a can of beer, or a cup of dry red wine, when it goes into the oven. The biggest problem using wine, is that the rest of it seems to go into the chef...
Edit: lower and slower is even better, especially when it accommodates a work schedule: 275 or 250 will be fine, if you're at work all day.

This is one of the best recipes that Chef John has ever come  up with.  I didn't think he could cook real basic food.  We all love this meal.  I do make one change though.  I use dried Basil in place of the black pepper.

Loved this recipe super easy and delicious...I tweaked it a lil bit I used parsley instead of rosemary and potatoes instead of celery(im not a fan of celery) I also sliced the chuck roast before browning it, so I could speed up the cooking process(i get home by 5 so I didn't want to eat super late).. it was in the oven for 1 hour instead of the 2 1/2-3 hrs.. it worked perfectly for me I was eating within an hour and a 1/2 of getting home.. LOVED IT!!

Really enjoyed this recipe. I had some yams on hand that I added and it turned out great. Company thought the vegetable medley tasted like stuffing because of the rosemary. Will definitely make this again! Served with Yorkshire pudding.

My boyfriend and I have been enjoying many of Chef John's recipes. He has not failed to impress us yet! His techniques, delicious ingredients that are simple but perfectly combined, and great instruction have kept us coming back for more. This recipe rocked...just as is! We paired it with his Perfect Mashed Potatoes and our dinner tonight was amazing!! Our tummies are really happy. Keep 'em coming Chef John :)

Thank you Chef John!!   Definitely another winner here, absolutely the best pot roast I have ever made.  I have to say that I was a little skeptical being there is no broth or liquid, but I have absolute faith in all of your recipes(I have made about 30 of them so far, all have been hits with my family) so I followed recipe exactly. Soooooo gooooood :)  And I love your drawings, and of course your humor.  My husband can always tell when I make a "Chef John" recipe because he enjoys it so much.  His all time favorite is your Swedish Meatballs, in fact, I made them for his birthday!  Thank you for making me a great cook, keep up the good work :)

One of the best pot roast I ever had!  Made as written but substituted mccormick just a pinch season all as I'm not a big fan of rosemary on its own.. Will make again but will also cut back on the butter to 2T. A 1/2 of stick was too much. For everyone saying it was dry, you need to use the celery, carrots and onions; this creates the juice in which it cooks.....Thanks for a great recipe...My husband loved it!

Really Good.  Prepared pretty much per recipe and baked  2-1/2 hours.  Added 3 cloves garlic and 1/2  tsp dried thyme to vegetables.  Will double vegetables next time. Can't have too much of this delicious vegetable "mash" as a topping.  Served over horseradish mashed potatoes as a one dish meal.  Easy and as it was baking it smelled so good - all over the neighborhood :-)

The "special sauce" the broken down veggies make is ideal to pour over the mashed potatoes and watch the kiddos (and my hubby!) gobble up.  Delicious recipe that was a winner with my family.  Thanks Chef John!

This was the first time I have ever made a pot roast, this was so easy. And came out great! The only thing differently I did was to coat the roast in a little bit of flour before browning it. And I used Dill and Thyme instead of the Rosemary, because that's what I had on hand. I also added a little bit of beef broth to give the liquid some extra flavor! Will for sure be making this again!!

This is THE BEST pot roast EVER!!!! OMG!!!! So easy! I was worried it wouldnt cook right, or taste bad without any water or broth but this is the best! Makes its own sauce, its sticky and  good,  just as is! I also like to add bell pepper, and mushrooms. I increase butter and oil when I do this.

This is YUMMY!  Added more of the veggies and only used 3 Tbs of butter.  Super comfort food, easy to make without using all the pre-packages soups and onion mix.  Got everyone to the dinner table.  Will make again!

I've always have bad luck with pot roasts.....until now! This recipe was simple but amazing! Only changes were to double, maybe triple the veggies and half the butter. Thank you Chef John!

This recipe is so easy, simple and delicious!  My family loved it with mashed potatoes  and I  got the thumbs up.  Roast cooked really well, still moist and lots of juice to make gravy.  It's a keeper!

This is pretty much the one my late mom did, except, she added canned whole potatoes to beef and pork roast.  Except, I'm not sure if she added them at the same time or later.  She coated them in oil, and they would cook in the juices and get nice and brown and crispy.

This was very good and simple to prepare.  I cut out the largest chunk of fat from my chuck roast to reduce the amount of fat.  I course diced and doubled the vegetables, but left the amount of butter the same; then added a heaping tsp. of crushed garlic after sautéing the other vegetables.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe, as written.  Served it over garlic mashed potatoes.  It came out perfect!  It was tender and delicious!  Thank you, Chef John!

First off, very easy, very yummy dish. That said, the "sauce" was actually more of an au jus. If you like actual gravy with your pot roast, here's a super simple fix: Use only 2 tbsp of the butter in the veggie mix. Save the other 2 tbsp butter to make a roux at the end and use the "sauce" for your liquid. If there's not quite 1 cup of liquid, you can add beef broth (or even water in a pinch). Voila! Pot roast with a rich, tasty gravy! I also added quartered raw potatoes to pan before I put roast in oven - came out perfectly cooked. Thank you for a great recipe that I will definitely be making again!!

Updated 12/3/17.  Awesome. My family loves when I make this dish.  One small adjustment--less salt and whole baby carrots and celery cut in 2 inch chunks helps a little firmer veggie texture in the butter sauce.  I've made this meal dozens of times.  On reading  other reviews, I have "overdone" the beef only once, so I can see why some have reviewed and suggested to add broth. 
I've since learned to set the timer no longer than 2 1/2 hours and use the convection roast setting on my oven.  Thanks, Chef John!  I'm a huge fan and follower!

Well.... I followed it exactly, but the meat came out swimming in liquid!  What happened?  Anyone?  It would have made great gravy, if I wasn't trying to lose weight, I suppose... And the pot roast and veggies were great....  But I felt as though the meat BOILED!  Any thoughts?  Thanks!

I absolutely love this simple recipe. Anyone can make this even if you have no experience in the kitchen. It is scrumptious with few ingredients. All you need to do is watch his video, grab the necessary items, and give yourself enough time. My boyfriend was amazed with my culinary skills until he made it himself and then understood how I couldn't mess up such an easy task. Now he asks for pot roast almost weekly!

This was pretty good. You definitely need to have another vegetable. There was a ton of liquid left in the pot, and I should have thickened it and served it with the beef.

Exceeded expectations! Followed the directions (which I usually don't) and it came out awesome. I used a piece of meat just less than 2 lb and there were no leftovers. Will make again and wouldn't change a thing!

Made it almost exactly as written (I left out the celery because I don't care that much for it, and you can't buy ONE stalk. What would I do with the rest of it?) (^_^)  This is almost perfect EXCEPT the recipe cries out for just a bit of liquid.  The beef was tender and the vegetables were VERY flavorful!  But the veggies stuck to the pan and even though the meat was tender, I thought it would have been nice to have a little gravy or sauce with it. This recipe is *almost* perfect; will make it again but add a cup of beef broth to the mix.

This worked out extremely well for us. We put it together before leaving the house for a birthday party, and we were greeted with such a delicious aroma on returning home! The only difference was that we put about 1/2 cup water in the bottom before putting the lid on. My son-in-law absolutely loved it!

This was very tender and tasty!  I used a 3.35 lb. chuck roast, and 2 1/2 hours was almost perfect.  The meat sliced well, and it was juicy.  If you want it to fall to pieces, cook the full three hours, at least.  I liked the addition of rosemary--I used fresh sprigs  from my garden.  Thanks for the recipe, Chef!

My husband and I have made this twice now.  Absolutely the best and only way to have pot roast!  Until now I have never really loved pot roast. Chef John never disappoints!  I now love pot roast! How can such simple ingredients equal such incredible flavor!  Thanks again Chef John!  You are my favorite! Ever!!

Throw out the onion soup mix and make this pot roast exactly as written!  This is another Chef John recipe that is simple and doesn’t disappoint. The wife wanted to know what seasoning was used...she couldn’t believe it was just salt, pepper and rosemary ( and butter ??).  I like rosemary, but even if you don’t it’s subtle in this pot roast.  The vegetables do cook down significantly and are very soft.  However they are delicious. Next time I may increase the veggies and chop instead of dice. I did add peeled red potatoes for the last 90 minutes of cooking and they turned out perfect. This is your grandma’s Sunday pot roast, delicious and easy to make!

Utterly delicious. Perfection. I followed the recipe exactly, except I used a whole stick of butter (hey! I’m from Wisconsin! Whaddya expect! ). I also added fingerling potatoes. They needed about 45 minutes to cook at the end. My first pot roast ever, and it was absolutely amazing.

This is my new go to recipe for pot roast!  I omitted the rosemary (not a fan) and thinly sliced a couple cloves of garlic and added that to the veggie mix. The veggie mix was a little oily after cooking so I strained the veggies, defatted the liquid and added about a half cup of beef broth and put it all back together.......delicious!!!!

Roast certainly was NOT dry.  I was skeptical that the veggies would make enough liquid (along with the roast, of course) and it sure was fine.  I had a 3.5 lb. roast and cooked it for 3 hours.  The veggies were done to perfection, the roast still could have cooked a little longer.  Since the roast was buried under the pile of veggies, we just pulled the beef out and ate it the way it was.  Hind sight being 20/20, the next time I would just poke it with a fork ( to see if it was tender) & cook it a little longer.  The veggies still would have been ok.

Delicious! Made exactly as directed, but added potatoes. I made entire recipe in my cast iron cookware. Mine took about 4 hours. So worth it! Much better than crockpot mush!

Of all the gall of me... One small change to Sir Chef John's recipe, I deglaze the pot with just a splash of white wine and one more tbsp of butter. Left the vegetables in for just about 3 minutes on medium heat.... That's it... but, I had a clean, well, semi clean pot...

Wow!  This recipe made my usual crock-potted roast look very sad.  This was buttery and delicious. Yes, the meat was like butter.  I used only onions and garlic and also added some herbs de Provence and a bay leaf.  I will definitely make this again.

Awesome recipe . Cooked perfectly (who would eat a rare or medium "Chuck" roast) . A chuck roast it like a brisket. Cook it low and slow  until its tender.

I have been making pot roast for over 30 years and have never found a recipe that was perfect - until now. Not adding any liquid is the key. Make this as directed and you’ll never make it any other way again. I did add about one half of an envelope of dried onion soup sprinkled over the roast and threw in 2 cloves of garlic. There was about an inch of liquid in the bottom of the pan when I took it out of the oven.

Fantastic Recipe! Based on varying ovens, I will suggest to alter your cook time a bit, since all ovens are different. Mine came out juicy and delicious. I added potatoes with the roast instead of on top, and I also added chopped bell peppers which made a fantastic flavor addition. I highly recommend this recipe to anyone and everyone- whether you're just venturing into the cooking world or you are an expert!

Made this tonight and will definitely do so again.  My minor adjustments included adding:  a half-pound of mushrooms, quartered ( I cooked these before the other veggies), a good-sized garlic clove, chopped, to the vegetables as they were being sautéed, about 3/4 cup frozen pearl onions (added about half-way thru the cooking time) and 3/4 cup of beef stock.  Prior to serving, I used my immersion blender to chop the vegetables in the gravy more finely and also added 2 Tbsp of softened butter blended with 2 Tbsp of butter to thicken the sauce. An excellent dish and especially flavorful served over the horseradish mashed potatoes as suggested by Chef John.

Followed the recipe exactly, and it turned out delicious - tender, tasty, falling apart on the plate. Also very easy to make. Definitely recommend! Maybe a note - I cooked it about 3:30 hours. I also recommend cooking it in a high dish, to keep all the juice in.

This was very easy to make and was delicious.  I did add some sliced garlic cloves to the mixture and I substituted herbs de provence for the rosemary.  I also added a quarter cup of red cooking wine.

I guess I had the wrong cut of beef - I had a rump roast, but thought I had gotten a shoulder.  The meat came out tough, with an okay flavor, but not wonderful.  I did everything exactly as directed.  I don't think I will make this again.  I'll try a different recipe and will pay more attention to the cut.

This was absolutely delicious.  I made it last week and am making it again this week because it was so tasty.  I love that this recipe uses only real food ingredients ...no canned or dried soup mixes (with all the chemically processed additives) required for this recipe (like many of the other pot roast recipes)
It couldn't be any more simple and delicious.  Your family will love it!

This was just so good!  I changed the cooking time and let the whole thing cook for about 4 1/2-5 hours.  I also had fresh thyme from the garden along with fresh rosemary. The only thing I would change would be to put in less butter the next time.  My roast had a big pocket of fat  in it, so maybe if a person made a leaner roast, the butter would be perfect.  I will experiment and see how it comes out the next time.  Loved all the buttery veggies on top of my roast!

This was a pretty good recipe. I had to make adjustments as my roasts never are moist when I follow the directions. Either recipes want me to basically boil the meat with way too much liquid or they act like it's going to take way less time to cook. The latter was the case in this recipe. I ended up having to cook it for about 7 hours total just to get it tender. Not a problem but I will just brown the roast and then start the veggies next time and then just throw directly into a crockpot. I did season the meat with steak seasoning and added much more seasoning (salt, pepper, garlic powder, and onion powder). I also added garlic cloves to this as was suggested in other reviews. I also went ahead and threw in new potatoes to the pot. Next time I will jalepenos for a little extra kick. Not a bad recipe at all, I just had to adjust. The flavor was pretty good with the few changes I made. I liked the celery and carrots and onions the way they were prepared in this recipe. I will do this again in the future! And I did also really like that there was no need for extra liquid.

Delicious! I seasoned the meat with Montreal Steak before browning and doubled the carrots and celery the second time I made it. I added red potatoes for the last hour. Nothing better than the vegetables on the bottom mixed with the potatoes.

I have to say that the directions were so ez to follow.... since my mom always cooked I never had to cook for myself much but now that mom has passed away (and I did watch many times when she was in the kitchen cooking) I just wasn't sure how to make a roast. This one was very close to moms way and it was so tasty that I decided to join up and will continue to try other recipes.... some of us guys need all the help we can get when it comes to cooking!

I love this recipe, it is quick and simple. My kids and husband ask for it if they know roast is on the menu. It does not seem like there would be a lot of flavour but if you do the horseradish mashed potatoes or a dijon mustard mashed potatoes it is a perfect pairing. Delicious!

This is now my go-to pot roast recipe. Hubby said it was a home run, and he doesn't rave very often. Very easy, very tasty. Made it just as written except used baby carrots instead of diced. Yum!

I made NO changes, and I will probably never use any other recipe again. It is the most flavorful and simplest pot roast recipe I've ever used. 
Next time, though, I think I'll put some mushrooms in with the mirapoix and see what happens.
Bravo to this recipe!

This was fantastic!  I followed the recipe exactly except that my roast was smaller and I cut the cooking time (1.5 lb roast for 2 hours).  My husband does not usually like pot roast but thought this was really good.  Thanks, Chef John, I can always count on you!

I've made this a few times, using both chuck roast and English roast. Both turned out great! I did end up doubling the carrots, celery and onions. Only because I needed them to make a shepards pie with the leftovers. I paired this with horseradish mashed potatoes, which Chef John suggested. It was awesome, and added alittle zip to my shepards pie! This is a family favorite!

I made this recipe exactly as stated but I seasoned the meat with montreal steak seasoning before browning because it has coarse pepper, salt and garlic.  Tasted awesome.  My daughter said it was the best pot roast I have made so far.  I went light on the rosemary.  I used a 4 lb pot roast and roasted for 3 hours.  Fantastic!

This recipe is a keeper. In my experience, unless it's a prime rib roast every other roast recipe I've tried has come out tough and dry. This one was fork tender and deliciously flavourful. My husband was very impressed as was I. Finally, a pot roast recipe that is everything it said it would be. I followed the recipe exactly.  Don't think you need liquid to make it tender. The slow cooking on the bed of delicious chopped veggies produces it's own juice. Enjoy:)

I used a chuck roast, and the family devoured it! Lots if great flavor, and since it cooks low and slow it's an easy recipe.

Absolutely delicious! I did add a cup of diced yellow bell peppers. My husband said that I should have tripled the recipe. Next time I will use the slow cooker to save electricity (after I brown the meat). Dicing the veggies really small is the key to melding the flavors, I think. I baked a potato, mashed it with some butter and served the veggies on top with the meat on the side with some of the juices for my husband. Mine, I served over rice. Yum, yum, yum!

Was in the mood to cook this afternoon, so I tried this.  I loved my mother's pot roast, but haven't found the right combination to enjoy having it very often until today.  My husband said it was "really good", and I enjoyed it very much.  I used fresh rosemary, but otherwise, pretty much as written.  Thanks for sharing.

The recipe and picture sounds and look simple and bland, but followed the recipe exactly except doubled the onions and added a few cloves of garlic and it was the best pot roast I've ever eaten.  Be sure and don't let it cook longer than the 2 1/2 hours, I let mine stay on warm for a hour after baking until everyone could get home to eat and it was getting close to being dry, but still AMAZING!!!  The vegetables has a wonderful flavor and full of juice.  I enjoyed the potatoes, I got from another recipe on this website, but my wife's picky pallet wasn't a fan.  ONLY WAY I'VE EVER ENJOYED POTROAST

Pot roast is just one of those things I haven't been able to do well; until this recipe! My meat was bigger, about 4 1/2 lbs. After reading reviews and instructions, it seemed like the vegetables would be the "gravy" for the meat, I trippled the measurements for them and made sure to chop them small. I'm glad I did, my family used them over the meat and the mashed potatoes I made to go along with the meal. Since I was working with larger amounts, I also doubled the rosemary. I always salt & pepper to taste and use olive oil. It was delicious. Hardest part is preparing & chopping veggies, but really worth the effort. I could see a touch of garlic in here too, but great as written.

Haven't even cleared my plate and I came to talk about how good this is! We used a French Onion Spoon Roast pre-seasoned from the butcher. I added a couple chunky-cubed potatoes about an hour before the end time. My husband immediately asked if we could have this every week. Yum!

Yes this is good but there is no need to do the veges seperate. You can brown the meat and add the veges. Will taste the same. My only extra was to add 1/2 cup red wine. Tenderizes the meat even more and ooh the flavor.

Excellent!  Added small red potatoes and carrot chunks in final 45 minutes.  Also minced 3 garlic cloves into vegetables. We loved it!

I thought this was good. Followed the recipe exactly. Used a 3.8lb chuck roast. Do not need to add any liquid there will be plenty!! The sauce is very watery so if you like it thicker,(more like gravy) you will need to thicken it. I let mine cook the entire 3 hours but I think it would have been done at 2 and a half. At 3 hours it was falling apart (which is ok with me). Thanks for a nice pot roast recipe!

This is a keeper.  Made exactly as per instructions and came out oh soooo GOOD.  even my wife and mom liked it.  So much better than the last Pot Roast recipe I tried from this site.  Thanks you so much. 
I only changed three ingredients, my wife doesn't like celery or onions, so I added chopped potatoes inplace of the celery and added dried minced onions inplace of fresh onion and also added 1 bag frozen cut green beans.

This was fantastic and reminded me of Sunday dinners of long ago. Will probably use the leftover to make shepherds pie.

Wow! A recipe that I can follow to the letter and comes out perfectly! We did as another reviewer had and made soup with the leftover stock and meat. I will be making this again very soon. :)

Very simple recipe that doesn't take forever to make. I didn't use 3 1/2 pounds of meat so if I would have let it cook for the time it says it would have been overdone, but I used a meat thermometer and it turned out perfect.

Wonderfull!  I wish I had more people over to share this with.  Very simple.   I did add a dash of worchestershire sauce and I didn't have any rosemany so I put some fresh ground italian seasoning and put some slits in it and placed some garlic pieces in the meat.  Also cooked with potatoes.  Just fabulous.  That is two for two Chef John, Thanks.  I'm going to make this many times.

This was very good!  I made this as written, but used 1 T. fresh rosemary instead of the dried.  I couldn’t find a large roast, so I used two smaller ones, totaling about 3.25 lbs.  After about 2 hours and 45 minutes, this was perfectly fork tender and still very moist.  I served this over Mashed Potato Dream, also on this site.  The only change I would make next time is to either decrease the amount of meat, or increase the vegetables.  I thought that once the veggies cooked down, there really wasn’t enough for six servings of meat.

This is one of the most flavorful roasts I have ever made. It tastes amazing every time. I was a little worried about adding no water when putting in the oven but it turned out perfect! I see myself making this over my crock pot roast more often than not!

I followed the recipe exactly and was very impressed with the results- tender with lots of juices which is amazing considering you don't add any liquid. There were only two of us eating and there was little leftover. We did find it a little salty so I will use less salt the next time.

This was absolutely delicious! The texture and flavor were better than my usual crockpot roasts. I used a cake pan with foil for baking because I don’t have a Dutch oven. The veggies were super soft but not broken down so I just used my potato masher, made the best gravy like sauce! Will definitely be making this again and again.

This was the best, moist, flavorful pot roast. The carrots, onions and celery flavor the meat so good. I added garlic powder, a bit of beef stock and lemon pepper.  Then, I made gravy out of the juice. Excellent

This was decent. I tried to make it according to the recipe. The only difference was that I used fresh rosemary. I didn’t love how soft the veggies were, but my son did eat the celery, so something must have gone well! While some were happy with it, I didn’t love it and will continue searching for a pot roast recipe that I love.

This is the best pot roast I have ever made. I usually do a crock pot roast, but didn't have the time today. I looked this up and made just as written, but I used a large london broil instead of a chuck roast, and I added a can of condensed tomato soup on top before I roasted it. It makes the gravy really thick and tangy.

I Made this for the first time with Chuck Steaks.  Instead of Carrots, I used Potatoes, and My Discriminating Husband LOVED IT!  He proposed to me again after 20 years of marriage.  Have fun with this recipe.  The key to a tender roast is the pre-searing (like Lamb).  It seals in the flavor and juices in a way I have never experienced...I'm making a Chuck Roast tonight...

Love it!  And so did everyone else.  The meat is tender while the simple seasoning appeals to every person at the table.
My contribution was diced celery and it melded beautifully with whole carrots and whole Yukon gold potatoes.  The only thing that I would change is adding the carrots about halfway through.  Since I bake mine for five hours or so the veggies can soften to a nonexistence.   Still delicious and a huge success!

This is the way to make it. The only variation I make is to leave the vegetables whole, including the onion. Absolutely, no liquid is needed.

My son and family came to Sunday dinner and I made this roast.  It was quick to prepare and so much better than previous Dutch oven method.  Of course at $8+ per # that meat should be tender.  I’ll make this again.

I have made this many times and always follow the recipes as written because it is as perfect as it is simple. Serve over mash potatoes and there is always a fight over the leftovers.

This is the first time I have made this recipe. I used a 2.5 pound chuck roast on sale for $10. I got confused with a stew recipe and used flour salt and pepper to braise the roast. After that I paid very close attention to the recipe. I diced the veggies up fairly fine. I cut back on the celery because of family preferences but most likely the whole cup of celery would have produced even better flavor. For the smaller roast the 1/4 cup of butter may have been a little excessive, but the veggies were very tasty. I used a lodge cast iron Dutch oven and 275 degrees. The roast was browned , appetizing to look at, and shredded easily. The fat was easily separated from the meat. The texture and colour of the meat was excellent.

Wow! Best Pot Roast ever! I've never made pot roast without water, was skeptical, but went ahead with the recipe as is.  After removing the beef I added 1/4 cup flour to the butter and veggies, made a roux and gravy with 2 cups water added. The gravy was so rich and flavorful I could make a meal out of it alone! It was so delicious! This is definitely the only way I will make pot roast from now on. Thanks for a fabulous recipe!

My husband ABSOLUTELY loved this roast!  He likes his meat well done (but not soaking wet.) Some pot roast recipes call for lots of added liquid, so the meat turns out sopping wet, but this meat is just tender, moist and, oh, so yummy!!   I subbed 1T fresh rosemary for the 1t dried, added 2 small bay leaves and some parsnips to the pot, and also adjusted the salt, pepper and cooking time, because my roast was only 2 pounds.  I loved this because the meat was done enough for hubby and still moist enough for me!  And did I mention YUMMY

I made this according to the recipe, but without Rosemary and with the addition of Worcestershire sauce. That's just what I had on hand.  The vegetables and the sauce were delicious and the meat was fork-tender and very flavorful.  The particular cut of chuck roast that I had was something I hadn't cooked before and I'm so glad that I found this recipe to help me. I will definitely make this again.

I actually wanted to give this 4.5 stars, but I went ahead and chose 5.  I intended to make Chef John's slow cooker version of pot roast, but work duties called, and I ran out of time.  So I went with this more traditional version.  I did modify it slightly, partially out of desire to use already purchased ingredients and partially to add things I thought I would like.

First, there is an apparent shortage of celery.  My Publix was out of celery...oh, well.  I added 8 oz of baby bella sliced mushrooms, because I bought them, and I like mushrooms.  So they went into the Dutch oven.  Georgia has its Vidalia onions, and it's hard to go wrong there.  Vidalia it was.  I also dusted the roast with white flour prior to browning, thinking that would thicken the sauce a bit.  Well, the onions and mushrooms had enough moisture to counter that idea, although there was plenty of drippings to make a good gravy had I so chosen to do so.  Finally, I used equivalent measures of fresh rosemary and thyme, again because I had just purchased it and because I thought it would lend well to the flavor.

I cooked the roast as indicated in my cast iron Dutch oven.  At about the 2 hrs 15 min mark, I added the sliced mushrooms.  I didn't want them to disintegrate by overcooking them.  I then cooked for another 1 hr 15 min.

The roast was exceptionally tender, and the carrots (unpeeled) were very flavorful.  I would happily make this version again.

Easy and tastes great! I added fresh garlic as well. I deglazed the pot with just a bit of red wine to get all of the bits off of the pan. I doubled the veggie recipe. I wouldn't double the butter next time. The veggies and roast made enough liquid. I even removed some.  My 3 1/2 pound roast took about an hour or so longer to cook.  Thank you for another great recipe Chef John!

I made this last evening for my husband, and he LOVED it! It's been awhile since he's had a roast, but he couldn't stop saying how good this was. The only thing I switched out was oregano for rosemary, as I didn't have any on hand. Fairly easy to make, which is always good for my end.

Followed all the directions except I added garlic to the roast. While the roast had a decent flavor it was not tender even after three hours in the oven. We had to cut it with a sharp knife. Veggies were overcooked and greasy. No one went back for seconds. I will NOT be making this again

This recipe was easy to prepare after taking the advice of other reviewers and doing a 1 1/2" to 2" chop on the veggies instead of dicing them.  For added flavor, I used 1 1/2 large red onions, 5 garlic cloves (whole/crushed), 6 carrots, 3 Yukon Gold potatoes and a parsnip. There were so many veggies in the pot the roast was near the top of the Dutch oven.  Also, didn't have rosemary so threw in about 8-10 stems of fresh dill. It came out great.

I didn't have any celery, so I cut up 2 potatoes and used those. My meat was a 2 pound shoulder roast and I cooked it about 2 and a half hours.it came out fine, but will probably cook it another half hour next time. Husband really enjoyed it.

This was very easy and by far the best pot roast I have ever made! Delicious and tender. I didn’t have dried rosemary so I substituted Italian seasoning. Will definitely make again!!

Because the meat & veggies came out of the oven dry, I transferred the veggies into a small pan,added a can of beef broth, a little thyme, and a couple bay leaves. After simmering for about 10 minutes, I added a Tbsp of Corn Starch mixed with a little cold water to thicken  it into a yummy veggie gravy.  We  had the veggie/gravy  over noodles with the meat on the side. My husband LOVED it, and so did I!

There was a lot of liquid when it was done. Is it supposed to be covered the whole cooking time?

I loved this and so did my 2 small children.  The only change I made was adding potatoes instead of serving over mashed potatoes because my kids HATE mashed potatoes.  I would not suggest added liquid to this recipe, not sure if it was the potatoes or if my 3 lb chuck roast was too fatty, but when I pulled out my roast it was 2/3rds covered in liquid.  Still delicious, still fell apart the way you would expect.  My only change would be to cut the veggies bigger.  Mine were just a mixed up mush, still delicious but I like some chunks to my veggies.  (To be fair I like lumpy mashed potatoes too)

Delicious. The only change I made was to use a spring of fresh rosemary because that is what I had on hand. I served the pot roast over my standard mashed potatoes. I will definitely be making this again.

Delicious. Eye roast came out fork-tender. Weren’t ready to eat after 3 hours so I added a cup of beef broth and lowered temp to 200 for another hour. Cooked potatoes along with roast, which were yummy with the broth and veggies.

Turned out amazing. Added about 5 cloves of garlic to the vegetables, and didn’t have Rosemary but added some Thyme with the salt and pepper on the toast before browning. Served with Garlic smashed potatoes, and cooked carrots.

I will definitely make this again. I followed the prep part exactly.  The only thing I did differently was to sear the meat and sauté the vegetables the night before and refrigerated it overnight.  I put it in the oven the next day when I got home from work, and cooked it according to the directions.  It is so good!  My husband and I both loved it.  My husband added a little flour and water mixture to make a little more gravy and it was the perfect touch, we did not need to anything else or change anything.  Great recipe Chef John!!

You've no idea how sad it makes me to rate this recipe so low. I love pot roast and I especially love it using a chuck roast. Mine was about 2 1/2 lbs and well marbled. I followed the recipe to a T with the exception of using an enamel over cast iron casserole covered with a double layer of foil rather than a dutch oven. After 2 3/4 hrs it still felt resistant when I stuck the fork in so I let it go for another 45 min. After letting it rest it pulled apart easily but was stringy. I might have gotten a bad cut of meat. Who knows? On the plus side, the flavor was very good considering how few ingredients there were, and surprisingly there was quite a bit of pan juices. I'll try it again to see if the trouble lay in the old, tough cow that they foisted off on me this time.

I followed the recipe as directed with the addition of a small amount of thyme, my favorite herb, with the rosemary.  The meat was super tender, an issue I have had with other roast beef attempts. I had enough juice to make a very flavor filled gravy to go with the potatoes since my husband doesn't like horseradish.  The vegetables were also so tasty! I am planning on the shepherd's pie as suggested by one review with the leftovers. Will definitely make this again. Thanks Chef John!

This recipe is amazing!  I have been making pot roasts for 20 years and this is a quote from my husband "I don't know what you did different this time, but this pot roast is the best you've ever made!"  I followed the recipe exactly and the only change I made was adding extra carrots.   I served it with horseradish mashed potatoes, as suggested,  and that was also a big hit!

This was without a doubt THE best pot roast I have ever made!  So simple and SO delicious!  The only changes I made were to add 1 c. sliced mushrooms and use fresh rosemary sprigs instead of dried.  This was tender and delicious.  The only way I will do pot roast in the future.

I made this exactly as the recipe states.  There was more moisture than I expected.  It was delicious.  Would definitely make it again.  In the future,  I will probably pull out some of the drippings to make gravy for the gravy-lovers in my family.

I LOVE THIS RECIPE!!!! I make it every month at least once.  It is simple and perfect.  The only change I make is that I don’t make a mirepoix- I leave the carrots, celery and onion in large chunks.  The flavor still comes out like mirepoix but you have a chunkier side dish veggie rather than a sauce from the roasted vegetables at the end.  This is a delightful and tasty pot roast.

Simple and flavorful.  I made it exactly as directed.  I will definitely will make this again.  I’m thinking that I’ll add some sweet potatoes towards the end of the roasting for full one pot meal.

Super simple and so delicious. I didn't change a thing. I baked in a ceramic dutch oven for 3 hours. Requires no water, so don't even think of it. This is the second time I've made this recipe.

This is probably the third recipe I've tried from Chef John and it's another hit. After looking for a recipe to try making pot roast for the first time, I came across this one. I made the recipe exactly as directed. The meat was tender and flavorful. My boyfriend, who is a picky eater, said it was one of the best meals he'd ever had.  This simple and delicious recipe is going into my favorites. Thanks Chef John!

Used a rump roast and it turned out nice and tender.  Was going to use the slow cooker but ran out time and I'm glad I did.  I'll use the oven again.

This flavorful pot roast is incredibly easy and delicious. I served it over plain mashed potatoes with a side of sweet & sour cabbage.  Comfort food at its best. Next time, I want to try it without the rosemary but with a bit of balsamic vinegar.

I made a few minor changes. Used Italian seasoning because I didnt have rosemary and added a bit of red wine (maybe a 1/3 cup) just to deglaze the brown spots. I accidentally had it too high on the stove so the wine was just enough to deglaze the browning since it was starting to burn. I was using a dutch oven and I am not an experienced cook so I did the best I could. I didnt read the reviews and just winged it. I was concerned about the lack of liquid based on other recipes I came across but decided the review stars spoke for themselves so I just followed the recipe as is. Great simple recipe! Loved it! Stick to it and it will be great.

Simple, easy, and extremely delicious! What I look for in a great pot roast is very juicy and tender meat that feels like it melts or falls off with a quick tug of a fork. This recipe accomplishes that beautifully! I made minor tweaks - used Lawry’s seasoning salt with black pepper for the meat and I added some minced garlic to the vegetables since I’m a garlic fiend. I also used 1/4 cup of I Can’t Believe It’s Not Butter and it works wonderfully as a healthy substitute for butter if you want to curb the damage. It could not have come out more juicy and tender...super packed with flavor and sure to impress any guest...bravo!

My husband loves pot roast, and this one is really good. I didn't dice the veggies, I like them larger. I also added some squash as recommended by other reviewers. And I  stabbed the roast and pushed in about 10 garlic cloves because that's always yummy.

Hi, I made this last week and it was delicious. I did add fresh garlic and a tablespoon of tomato paste at the end of sautéing the veggies. for those that don"t like rosemary, the final sauce does not taste like rosemary at all. served with mashed potatoes we did add a 14 oz can of beef broth because we wanted more gravy. Or you could use beef boullion.  my husband raved about it. Have not had a roast for years and tasted very good.

I've made this a couple times with both bone in and boneless roasts. It is now my new favorite pot roast recipe. 
The chopped vegetables are amazing.
I reduced the butter by half and added some beef broth to prevent it from getting too dry.

My roaster must have a very tight lid, cuz I had a lot of liquid in the pan when made exactly as directed.  made a quick roux and stirred it into the juice and vegetables after removing the meat to a platter.  Heated it to a boil on the stove top and cooked it for two minutes for a nice gravy.  Luscious.

I have made this twice now. I added some of my steak seasoning for added flavor. This is so easy and the beef was melt in your mouth delicious. I thickened the vegetable mash into a gravy and served it up with horseradish mashed potatoes.  this has become one of my favorite meals.

Excellent, moist and flavorful.  My roast was 3 lbs but otherwise kept to the recipe exactly except added about a tablespoon of minced garlic to the cooking vegetables.  There were five at dinner and it served everyone with  leftovers for sandwiches the next day.  Totally simple and quite delicious.  Thanks Chef John!

Loved the flavor, the cooking method (got to use my heavy enameled cast iron pot) and loved the almost mushy vegetables!  Chef John, you did it again!   There were some leftovers so I am presently doing what others suggested and added some tomatoes and beef broth to  simmer as soup for tonight's dinner.   I will never again ruin another pot roast adding tons of liquid.  I will, however, double the veggies so there are a little more leftovers next time.  Best ever....don't listen to the negative reviews.  This one is excellent.

Perfect!  Followed the recipe completely since I had never made a pot roast.  My family loved it, including those that have made pot roasts and tried to tell me to do it differently.  :)

I usually make a more involved roast with red wine but didn’t have time. This was straightforward and easy to prepare.  I served it over mashed potatoes and everyone loved it.  Will definitely make again.

Okay, Wow!  Goodbye crockpot, hello Lodge Dutchoven. Thank you reviewer Marsha B. I too had 2-2 lb roasts. I cooked at 250 because my oven runs hot, also used a bit of meat tenderizer along with salt and pepper, no rosemary on meat. Tripled veges, added roasted garlic,  3Tbs Worcester and salt and pepper while sauté-ing. Added 1/2 cup water right before lid goes on. I cooked it for 1 1/2 hours turned oven off and let it stay covered in the oven for another hour.  Very tender and fall apart moist, veges are a bit greasy but totally yummy. I am glad I made another fresh side vege.   I did make a beef onion gravy that paired great with the meat and horseradish potatoes. Great meal!! Added it to the rotation. Cooked 5 Times and still amazing.

Came out very well and tender, I did double up on the carrots and celery.  To make it a complete simple meal potatoes were also added to the pot so that when it was done a complete meal was ready to go.

The only change I made was I added fresh mushrooms in the last 30 minutes.  There were no leftovers after this Sunday dinner!  The meat was so tender & the veggies were delicious.  I think the secret was in the searing.  I made it exactly like recipe said & it was fantastic!

I haven't done a lot of cooking up to this point in my life, but I am getting better at it! I bought a dutch oven today at WalMart and a 3lb chuck roast and veggies.  It turned out so amazing. My husband had two servings!  Thanks for this great, easy, recipe!

Came out delicious. I floured the outside before browning and didn't use any liquids. It made it's own nice thick gravy. It needed more seasoning and took longer than the time allowed but was delicious. Oh and I also cut slits in the meat prior to cooking and added minced garlic inside the holes. Next time I think I'll season the garlic before stuffing to see if I can get the seasoning more permeated throughout the meat.

Husband and guests and I loved it!   So much better that loads of liquid boiling the meat.    Followed recipe pretty closely, added some more of the veggies plus garlic, used fresh rosemary, and put in maybe 1/8 cup of red wine in the mirepoix for flavor.   When I do it next (and I will), would probably add some diced yukon gold potatoes for even more flavor.

Very easy recipe to follow tastes good. I used the juices of the pot roast and water to boil my potatoes I mashed. It was great. Oh yeah I cut up mushrooms and added to the veggie mix.

Just good old fashioned comfort food. Butcher had a "chuck tender steak" or what I used to know as "mock tender steak" it was just the right food for that meal. For a change I didn't change a thing. Followed exactly, so a TRUE 5 star.

Loved this recipe, altho I omitted the horseradish.  I just cant stand that stuff!  LOL  I used my Dutch Oven, and my chuck roast was a bit smaller so I cooked it less time.  Most people don't take that into consideration.  The roast was tender and perfect, the veggies were great, and of course, my famous garlic mashed potatoes.  I recommend this, so good!

Excellent simple pot roast recipe. Quick and easy to prepare. I added fresh mushrooms simply because I like mushrooms. I served with garlic mashed potatoes.

I love garlic, so I made gashes and inserted about 15 small gloves of garlic all over the roast. Everything else I kept the same.  It was amazing!

This was an easy and yummy recipe. I substituted bell peppers for the celery. Not big celery fans in our house.  Next time I will double the veggies. They  were so good we didn't have enough!

As usual when I try a new recipe, I followed the directions carefully.  The meat was tender enough but needed lots more seasoning!!  The chopped vegetables, cooking in the grease from the roast and the extra butter were pretty terrible.  If I make this again I will definitely add more seasoning and change the size of the vegetables back to my usual size.

Classic pot roast, just like Momma made! I used a 3 lb.boneless  chuck roast from the meat cutter at my local grocery store. I did add a sweet potato. Would use a tablespoon of rosemary next time. I served with smashed potatoes. Perfect, melt in your mouth beef with a delicious veggie enriched au jus.

I could never make a decent pot roast until I found this recipe.  Very simple...yet utterly delicious.  It smells so good while it is cooking.  I follow Chef John's recipe as written...except I make twice as much of the yummy mirepoix veggies.   Thanks, Chef John. I haven't found one of your recipes that isn't terrific.

I followed the recipe as is but added carrots and was very pleased.  My husband loved the meal.  I cooked per the recipe but think another 30-40 minutes would have made the meat more tender.  I will definitely  make again.

This was superb! I, like others, was skeptic about cooking time and doneness of meat but it was perfect. I used a dutch oven with a 3.5 lb. chuck roast. After 3 hours, it was cooked perfectly. Thanks Chef John for yet another outstanding recipe!!

My family loved it!! Moist & tender meat, vegetables & juices from roast made easy gravy...will definitely make this again. Used a spicy meat rub prior to browning & splashed a little red wine in the roaster when it was headed for the oven.

I have made this recipe many times and will make it again tonight. I love the flavor that the onions, celery and carrots adds. I usually double the amount as it makes an amazing topper for the mashed potatoes. Cooking without liquid was a surprise but I will never go back to my old way of cooking a pit roast in liquid.

My family has eaten chuck roast for years prepared the same way in an old roaster with inconsistent results. This method produces excellent results in same cut of meat. They raved about it and devoured it as well.

Turned out moist and fork tender, with a wonderful taste.  I used a Corningware baking dish with lid, and covered the dish with foil before placing the lid over the foil and putting it into the oven - I  always do so when not adding any liquid to a pot roast to ensure that it comes out juicy.     First cooking the veggies in the butter and then baking them beneath the meat created the most wonderful side dish.  And, it was so simple!

I really liked the rosemary, I used fresh.  It turned out very tender and had a wonderful flavor.  I put some whole red potatoes and some 2 inch chunks of carrots in during the last 1 1/2 hour of cooking and they came out perfect.

Pretty easy recipe. I'm not able to eat beef, but my husband liked it and it smelled wonderful!

I made it as described, and it was wonderfully flavorful, juicy, and tender.  Next time I will double the veggies because they were delicious also!

Very good. I did add a few more spices and since my husband had to fight traffic to get home it cooked for about 3 1/2 hours but other than that this was a solid recipe. My husband likes it better than his and his is amazing.

Since I had a slightly smaller roast than the recipe called for, I used the shorter time. I think next time I will do it for the full three hours no matter what, just to make sure that all of the connective tissue (collagen) is thoroughly melted. I had to cut a little of it away. I thought the rosemary might not work so well, but I used it. Really couldn't even detect it. Maybe I will up that a tiny bit just to see if the flavor comes through.  This one is a keeper, as Chef John's recipes so often are.

This is my go-to pot roast recipe now and our favorite for Christmas dinner or other holiday occasions.  Surprisingly easy to make and the gravy that comes of it is delicious!  Not that heavy thick stuff from a can, but lighter and more flavorful.  Roast comes out succulent and melt in your mouth.  I make Yorkshire puddings now to go with this.

This was so good.  My whole family loved it.  For my variation, I added 2c of broth to a 4 1/2 lb roast.  I could have gotten away with adding only one cup though.  I cooked it in the slow cooker  on high for 4 hours.  I also tripled the veggies, and served on top of mashed potatoes.  Yum!

Very easy and yummy, although I did alter it a bit.  I added Apple juice (just enough to cover plus a bit more, on the bottom of the roasting pan).  I left the carrots quite large....cut carrots into 1/3 to 1/2.  Didn't use celery (yuck).  I added quartered peeled potatoes.  Bit of pepper.....and that's it.  
I started the oven at 265 for an hour, then worried that it wouldn't be done in time, so turned it up to 350.

I've been busy preparing for Thanksgiving day and looking for  something easy to prepare.  Well, thank you Chef John,  this is was it.  I browned the roast, removed it and browned chunked carrots, onions and yukon potatoes, didn't even peel them, then slowed roasted in the oven.  It was outstanding.

This was excellent, especially the veggies.  My daughter, who refuses to eat carrots, actually picked them out, ate them and asked for more.  Unfortunately, my husband has since found out that he has high blood pressure, so it's not a very healthy recipe.  Otherwise I definitely would have made this again.

So simple and so good! Our pot roast came out so moist and tender. The whole dish was rather mouth watering for more. I think I like this method of  using the oven to make pot roast over the slow cooker. At the end of cooking you'll find the roast sitting in some liquid, produced from the roast. Just scoop out the veggies using a slotted spoon. You get enough of the jus from the veggies to top your slices of pot roast atop the mashers.

I put a couple of sprigs of fresh rosemary in the pot, and used my own mix of salt and herbs.  Otherwise I followed the recipe pretty closely.  The liquid, reduced and thickened with cornstarch, made a wonderful, super easy gravy.

We could not find a chuck roast big enough so my husband bought 3 that came to a total of 6.5 lbs.  We put a sprig of both rosemary and thyme on each roast.  That may have been too much thyme.  Otherwise, this was melt-in-your-mouth incredible.  I doubled the tomato paste because of the amount of meat cooked.  Served over sweet potato with gravy spooned over the top.  This is fine restaurant quality.

Yummy, I needed a way to cook this is less than crock pot time but not so quick it would be tough. This was perfect. I had a larger than normal roast and did mine for 3 hours. Wonderful. I browned it in my cast iron skillet then used put it all inside my dutch oven inside my oven.

After cooking I wrapped the meat in foil and refrigerated overnight. This makes the meat far easier to slice, especially if you like it thin. Next day  placed in gravy and heated until warm. It was delicious.

Enjoyed it so much we made it again at our next dinner party.  Our kids usually turn their noses at pot roast, but this was a hit.

I love how simple this recipe is! The piece of meat I used was much larger so I followed with a higher quantity of veggies and ingredients. It came out less perfect than I expected however because the veggies were sort of drowning in the meat fat, so not as pretty as Chef John's but very very tasty!

Wow! This pot roast was SO GOOD! Followed recipe exactly and served it over Horseradish Mashed Potatoes also from the AR site.  Sunday dinner was fabulous tonight along with some pan-fried zucchini.  Thanks Chef John! Another awesome recipe for my keeper file.

I will definitely make it again. 
I did not have dried rosemary  so I substituted with 1/2 dry thyme and 1/2 Mrs. Dash's Original Blend.  Other than that I followed the exact recipe.

This turned out delicious -and I'm a horrible cook- it is so EASY!!!

Came out perfectly.  My roast was just over three pounds and it took a little over three hours.  This is the first time I can remember cooking a roast with no braising liquid but I like this technique.

I made this last night for a few friends.  We all really enjoyed it.  I made the recipe as written except I used a lot more vegetables.  I also served it with wasabi mashed potatoes instead of horseradish.  Everyone asked for the recipe and said they'd be doing pot roast this way from now on.    I was planning on a lot of leftovers but after everyone having thirds, none! Dicing the vegetables was a bit time consuming but the result was worth it.  It made lots of delicious "gravy" and the meat just fell apart.

I loved this recipe! It melted when it was done. The only change I made was to add about 1/2 cup red wine because I just couldn't put it in the oven without wine. LOVED it and will make it again!

I've tried a few recipes for roasts in the slow cooker,  but was never very pleased with them.  Made this in the oven, just as directed, and it was beautiful.  The meat just eased off the roast with a fork, outside was well done, and the meat inside was delicious.  No more slow cooker roasts for me - this is how I will do a roast from now on.

This the best chuck pot roast I have made.  Other than not adding the rosemary I followed the directions exactly. The meat had flavor and was very tender, could cut it with a fork. The sauce is a nice touch too.  I am making this again, it is in the oven as I type.

I'd give this 10 stars if I could. The meat was so tender I hardly needed a knife to cut it. I was a bit skeptical when I saw that the recipe required no beef broth or other liquid, but there was plenty of juice at the end. This may be the best pot roast I've ever had.

My family really enjoyed this.  I liked it a lot better then crock pot pot roast.  Served over mashed potatoes instead of potatoes with the pot roast was yummy.  We should have put more horse radish in the potatoes or some on the side would have been delish!

Hands down the best pot roast I have had in years. We cooked it in a cast iron Dutch oven, doubled the rosemary and cooked a 3 1/2 lb chuck roast for three hours.  The meat was pink, juicy, and pulled apart easily with a fork. We will make this again when our daughter comes to visit in January! This is sure to me a new family favorite.

Exceptional recipe! Giving this 5 stars for ease and taste. Growing up my mom always made hers in one of those oven bags and for the last few years switched to making hers in the pressure cooker. I love the simplicity of this recipe. A few things I did differently was added chopped garlic to the vegetables and took the roast out 10 minutes earlier and let it rest on the stove covered for the last 10 minutes. The meat was not as tender as I would have liked it to be but the flavors made up for it. This paired very well with my garlic mashed potatoes as I did not have any horseradish to make with them.  Love Chef John's recipes and follow him. Thanks Chef John for yet another fantastic recipe. Will make over and over again!

Simple & tasty!  Don't change a thing and make sure to use some of the pan drippings for gravy.  Next time, I'll take about 15 minutes off of the time.  I cooked a 3lb. roast, 2 hrs. and 15 min.  Will only cook it for 2 hours.

Really good, made this exactly how the recipe was written reminds me of how my grandma used to make pot roast. Next time I think I'll up the seasoning a bit some garlic powder or something to kick up the flavor just a bit.

This was great.  I have never made pot roast without putting in broth or something, but I trusted the reviews that said it worked.  it did!  I forgot to put in the rosemary and it was still good.  i would suggest adding some salt and pepper to the vegetables.  I roasted some cauliflower in the pot around the meat and it came out great.

I was a little wary at first due to the fact that there was no liquid added, but I was pleasantly surprised that none was needed. This was delicious! Will definitely make again!

Simply amazing! I didn't have celery so I used onion, baby carrots and mushrooms. I chopped the onion and mushroom, but left the baby carrots whole. I didn't have rosemary so I used a few bay leaves instead and added garlic powder to the rub. We had it with plain mashed potatoes and pan gravy. It came out super juicy,  tender, and flavorful. This being my first post roast ever I was beyond thrilled with the results!!

This was very good and I will be adding it to my Recipe Box. We omitted the celery and added mushrooms in their place, however, I didn't add the mushrooms until it was time to bake the roast.

Excellent flavor, but it wasn't quite as melt-in-your-mouth tender as I had hoped (parts of it were, and parts weren't, so I don't know what happened).  I made the recipe exactly as written.  I will say that my husband, who doesn't usually like pot roast, did indeed like it -- although he also thought it should have fallen apart more easily.

This is a rich, savory and extremely tender pot roast!  I made it according to Chef John's recipe but added a couple tablespoons of beef Better than Boullion and it was the right thing to do.  I also used Yukon Gold potatoes with skins  on and mashed them less than smooth for a more rustic look and feel.  My family devoured it!

I love Chef John but I never thought this recipe would work.  Dry. Overcooked.  Man was I wrong!!!!!  This is absolutely the best pot roast I've ever made.  Only things I added were 4 cloves of garlic and cut up small potatoes about an hour before done.  I put the potatoes around the meat on top of the moist veggies.  Awesome, tender and moist. The juices and aroma were amazing!  Chef John, I will never doubt you again!!

Excellent as is! I was worried when it said not to add any additional liquid but it came out great anyway! Next time I will make way more veggies.

Edit: I made it again tonight and doubled the veggies. I also added 2 c. of purple sweet potatoes. So pretty and delish!

Both my husband and I really enjoyed eating this pot roast done this way.  It was truly delicious. The only thing I would change is that  it was too salty tasting for us only because we do not often use salt. I will reduce the salt next time only because of this.  Will be making this again!  Excellent recipe!

I seasoned the meat with garlic and added zucchini to the veggies, but other than that it remained the same. Good stuff.

I've made this  many times, exactly as the recipe says, and I always get a ton of compliments. Simple, flavorful, and comforting. I usually serve it with baked or mashed potatoes to soak up the juices. 
Side note: I don't cook the onions and celery down before throwing it all together and cooking with the roast. They soften plenty on their own and absorb all that wonderful flavor while cooking. But browning the roast first is a must! It's worth the extra 10-15 minutes.

This is a wonderful, easy to prepare dish. I use a mortar and pestle to grind the rosemary because I don't care for whole rosemary leaves. I use sea salt which I also grind along with freshly ground pepper. I do not change the recipe except for the preparation of the seasonings. This is great with Yorkshire pudding. Great job Chef!!

It's wonderful! I have made it twice now, both times exactly to the recipe. The first time I served with the horseradish mashed potatoes-excellent.  The second time with roasted little potatoes-also excellent. I think it has be served with potatoes so the butter gravy can be used!

Cooked roast according to directions but came out extremely dry; I did use different vegetables I had on hand and those cooked just fine.  All in all  I don't think I'll be using this recipe again.

My new favorite pot roast recipe!  I did it almost exactly as written, except I did not dice my carrots (I just used baby carrots) and added a clove of garlic.  I used a 2 1/4 lb. roast, and cooked it for about 2 hours and 15 minutes.  Next time, I will cook it a little longer, so it falls apart.  The flavor was awesome, and it smelled amazing.

This is our go-to recipe for pot roast. Made it dozens of times and it always comes out perfect!! You can use virtually any cut of beef. We use chuck roast most frequently, but we've tried "London broil" cuts - bottom/top round, even flank steak or flap meat. The secret is there's NO liquid added and the meat and veggies cook long and slowly in a low heat oven. Of course you adjust time to fit the meat cut - maybe an hour and a half for flank steak vs. 3 hours for a good sized chuck roast. No matter - it all comes out dee-lish - fall-apart tender with a savory vegetable infused gravy that's perfect over mashed potatoes. In fact, since I've reminded myself just how good this is, I'm going to make this for supper tonight!

I tried this recipe as a last resort for a roast that I forgot to put in the slow cooker.  I followed the recipe as directed and it turned out very tough.  I didn't care for the flavor, either.  Pot roast just goes in the slow cooker!

Excellent.  Tweeked a little with what I had.  Used Italian herbs in place of
rosemary.  When all was done I used my submersible blender and pureed all for gravy.  Might try adding some mushrooms next time.

Overall, I really enjoyed this recipe. I thought the amount of rosemary was a little too overpowering, so next time I'll put in half the amount. Thanks for sharing!

This was delicious!  I baked it for 2.5 hours and it was a little dry, so might take it out at 2 hours.  The carrots were so delicious, I would triple the amount next time and probably add some potatoes as well.

This recipe was delicious and quick! I added 2 tablespoons of worcestershire sauce. I also rubbed some garlic powder, Parsley flakes, and cajun seasoning on the roast after searing, and poured vegetables/butter on top of roast.

This was a very yummy recipe I made it for the first time today. I however omitted the celery(never been fond of them) and added garlic it came out great. We had it with traditional Jamaican rice and peas. Definitely a keeper. Thanks for sharing Chef John

I have made this recipe a few times but i cook it in my dutch oven. It is spicy, so i serve it with sour cream ( which helps with the spice),flour tortillas, and a side of mexican rice.

This was so good.  Very simple and DELICIOUS.  I had a 4# roast so I added more onion and celery.  I had plenty of liquid in my pan (make sure you cover it).  Served over mashed potatoes. *****

Fantastic. So easy and just perfect. Obviously the cooking time will vary based on your oven and the size of your roast...you've got to handle that part for yourself! I used the "English Prime Rib Rub" from Penzey's to season it. Was in the oven after about 20 minutes of prep and made for a terrific Sunday dinner. I served with horseradish mashed potatoes just like Chef John suggested. Also served with steamed asparagus and broccoli. This is a keeper!

I made this per the instructions the first time, but since I hate carrots I did not like the flavor they imparted to the beef even though I didn't actually eat any of the carrots. I now make this roast with just the onions. It's easier and tastes better to me. The last two times my timing of when I could put in the oven and when we could eat was 4 hours so cooked it at 250 for 4 hours and really think it is better and more tender. The one I made tonight was an ANGUS chuck roast! Holy cow! Literally! It was night and day better. I'm spoiled now. I picked it up in the mark down section and now I will forever be scouting for more. If you can afford it buy it!

This is great! I took at chance bc the store didn't have any roasts and just bought stew meat. This still worked perfectly - the meat came out tender and moist. I sprinkled it with adobo and garlic powder before browning it, and taking some tips from other reviewers, threw in some small potatoes for the last hour. My celery and onion sort of melted into a yummy sauce; if you want pieces you can bite into, maybe add a bit more than the recipe calls for. Thanks for sharing this great technique!

I'm not known for my cooking skills, but this recipe turned out great, and it was so easy. This was the first dish I made using a cast iron Dutch oven we got from my Dad. I used baby carrots and added yam and 3 Russet potatoes. I would have taken a picture, but it was half gone before I had the chance. I've started following Chef John now, because if he can make this lame cook look good...

This is a go-to recipe in our house. I have always made it into more of a stew. I follow the recipe but then I cook it in a crock pot with some home made chicken broth and a few cloves of garlic. With 1-2 hours to go I add a bag of trader joe's 10 minute barley. The barley soaks up a lot of liquid so I use quite a lot of broth.(6 cups?  I've never actually measured). I've cooked it anywhere from 4 hrs on high to 8 hours on low. I definitely recommend the latter if you have time!  It's great the first day and even better the second.

This was so easy and so delicious!  I did make an  alteration to fit my taste. I did not use celery but added potatoes instead and I also added some minced garlic on top once in the roasting pan. I cooked everything the way the recipe said too and the meat was practically falling apart, the veggies nice and soft. It was out of this world :)

I have been making this now for about three years. I have served it to many people and literally it blows them away. I served it to my mother in law and she admitted it was BETTER than her Pot Roast! Follow the recipie exactly and spoon the veggies over mashed potatoes then slice the meat and lay across, makes a beautiful presentation. I promise you will NEVER again put a pot roast in a crock pot!

I didn't have celery so I replaced it with other vegetables. However, the main concern is the flavor and consistency of the beef. I found this recipe to be the BEST. Ever.

This was everything I expected!  Very tender.  I like the vegetables on the bottom method.  I will add a few more next time.  I added garlic powder.  Served it on horseradish mashed potatoes as recommended - delicious.

Great recipe! I actually only had two hours yesterday but I still tried it for the first time. After 1 3/4 hours I took it out of the oven and added red wine and diced potatoes and brought it to a boil on the  low fire, while keeping the oven on at 275. Then i put it back to the oven, and turned the oven off ( I don't want to leave it on while I was not home), and took my daughter to her piano lesson. When I came back ( an hour and half later) I took it out, it was still hot/warm, the meat was very soft and juicy. I turned oven back on to 275 and finished up the last half hour. It turned out so good! Meat was tender, soaked in juice, onion melted, potato soft and very testy. I served it over white rice. Definitely will buy more chuck roast and store in the freezer to make it again!! It is indeed one of the easiest dish to make.

Cooked it pretty much per the recipe, I did add about 1/2 cup of good red wine.  I was puzzeled by the reviewer that wanted to cook a rare or med-rare pot roast. Who would do that?  The best part is when the meat is falling apart.

Absolutely delicious! Used onion, carrot and potato instead of celery and added some red wine before putting in the over.  Also added a tiny, little bit of red pepper flakes to give it a little zing.  By far, the most flavourful roast I have ever tasted!
