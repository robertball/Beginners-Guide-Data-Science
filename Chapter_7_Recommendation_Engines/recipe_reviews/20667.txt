Actually, this pie is wonderful. It's just missing the 4 teaspoons of tapioca, which is an absolute staple for pies with juicy fruits, as it absorbs the excess juiciness. I'd encourage the previous raters to give it another shot :)

This recipe was awful!  I baked it the full hour and the top looked great.  But when I cut the pie (2 hours after it came out of the oven) the filling was like water.  And it tasted terrible, really a shame I had great berries.  I'll never make this again and I don't reccomend it to anyone.

I thought this recipe was great, and I didn't use Tapioca. I used a pie crust that was made completely with Butter (no crisco) and I baked it in a 9"x9" square baking pan. I also used about a cup and a half of black cherries because I was short blackberries. The crumbled topping made it look more like a cobbler, and my partner said it was maybe the best dessert he's ever had. The lemon really makes for a lovely pie topping.

I agree with the previous commentor, it looked amazing but as soon as you cut it, it turned into watery mush. Maybe if you cut back on the blackberries? The only thing that saved this pie was eating it with ice cream because of all the juice.
