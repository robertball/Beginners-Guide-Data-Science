I absolutely love your recipe idea but I would like to suggest to use half the amount of buttermilk and half the amount of panko crumbs you suggest if you're only going to be using two chicken breast halves. That much marinade (you can turn the chicken half way during the marinating) and that much crust is wasteful for such a small amount of chicken because you can't reuse the rest of the excess marinade nor the panko crumbs that the raw chicken have touched as it has been contaminated.

Hey everyone - this is my recipe, But a few things seem to be changed by Allrecipes since it was published.  I do a few things differently.

1)  Do not place the full amount of bread crumbs or egg substitute out at once.  I start with small amounts and replenish as needed.  It minimizes the amount of waste.
2)  I also spray with cooking spray pretty generously.  I don't leave them swimming in it, but if you use too light of a hand, you have a higher chance of the breading falling off.
3)  You do have to REALLY spray the baking sheet to less breading sticks to it.  I am very gentle when I turn them, but you will typically lose some breading.  I don't tend to lose a lot though.
4)  When they are done cooking, I put buffalo sauce in a bowl and literally coat them in it.  This really gives them true wing flavor.  That said, it also makes them pretty spicy.  If you don't like as much heat, a dash works fine.  I then return them to the over to bake for the 5 minutes indicated.

Play with the recipe and see what works for you.  I was just happy to have a non-fried alternative that had some crunch to it.  Happy cooking!

I just made this and it got a thumbs up from my wing loving kid!  I used a tip from another recipe on the site that I saw.  I placed a cookie cooling rack on the baking sheet, sprayed the rack liberally with Pam and baked the strips directly on the rack and they were crisp on both sides and barely lost any breading.  With 5 min left in the cook time, I drizzled buffalo sauce on half of them for my family that likes it hot.  The remainder, with out the added sauce were great too.  I used 3 huge breast cut into large strips.  Definitely plenty of marinade and breading for more chicken.  This is a keeper for my recipe box!!

I tried baking chicken strips and I just don't like them that way. I have a deep fryer and prefer to use that. Anyway...I don't bother w/buttermilk - the acid in the hot sauce thickens plain ol milk. I go half n half with amounts of milk & hot sauce. I use a regular egg mixed with a bit of milk. I also season up the panko with celery salt, garlic powder, fresh grated parm and a some cayenne pepper. I do leave the chicken to marinade overnight. With my changes these rock and you can quickly toss with a buffalo wing sauce if you really want to kick things up! Easier eating vs chicken wings (although I like those too).

Made these last night for my chicken strip lover of a boyfriend. Didn't realize I had ran out of Frank's, so used Sriracha instead - a delicious alternative! 1 cup of buttermilk to 1/4 cup hot sauce marinated with 3 sliced chicken breasts produced very moist and flavorful chicken strips. 

They got a huge stamp of approval from the boyfriend, but as delicious as they were, we couldn't even finish them all. But not to worry, the boyfriend had the leftovers finished by 10am the next morning.

I did find the breading a little heavy though. I don't usually use egg when I bread meats (which is quite frequently), which is perhaps the difference?

These taste really good...they're probably worth 5 stars if done correctly, but I didn't have buttermilk or Egg Beaters so I used plain milk and eggs.  Also, I didn't pay close attention when reading the recipe and didn't dip in the panko BEFORE the egg, only after.  And I didn't add the last splash of pepper sauce.  We added to taste as we ate them.  I will definitely try making this again...the right way!

With the exception of using chicken tenders, I followed the recipe exactly.  Even though I sprayed the pan, the breading stuck and when I flipped the tenders they came up naked.  The chicken did not pick up the hot sauce flavoring at all.  Overall, this was a disappointment.

These were quite yummy. There was a lot of waste with the buffalo sauce/buttermilk mixture as a previous reviewer mentioned. I even used an extra chicken breast (3 cut into strips) and there was still tons of excess. You could probably do 5-6 chicken breasts with this amount of marinade. I didn't find them quite spicy enough, so I dipped them in a ranch/buffalo sauce mixture which worked well. Maybe next time I might try cutting the buttermilk in half and using the same amount of buffalo sauce. Overall, great recipe and I will be making it again!! Thanks for sharing, Kathy.

Pretty good.  Subbed Frank's sauce for regular cayanne and still turned out nice.  Not exactly like a deep fried version but very crunchy with the panko.  Didn't really miss the frying.  Served with Ranch dressing.

Followed directions “verbatim” and for the most part the family enjoyed the taste and texture of the chicken strips. However, I could not get the crispy texture to the coating without drying out the chicken. Also, my chicken strips got “nekid” a couple of times. Very embarrassing. I will look for alternative. To much an amateur for this receipt.

The buttermilk soak made this so tender!  We really loved this and will add it to our regular meal plan.  A healthy alternative to processed or fried chicken fingers.  Thanks for sharing.

I baked these as directed then added the extra hot sauce when I reheated on the grill for dinner. They were plenty crunchy after baking and I lost very little breading using non-stick foil.  I agree that it's more marinade than necessary so I didn't really measure, just mixed up enough to cover the chicken and marinated over night. They smelled and tasted like the hot sauce but the flavor was a little on the subtle side prior to adding the "dashes". I have never used this double dip technique so it may be my fault but a lot of panko fell off in the egg. I ended up dabbing some on and then patting on more panko rather than dipping in egg. Messy process, but they turned out very good and I will definitely try them again.

Unless your chicken breasts are turkey sized this is a huge amount of marinade/crumbs. My review is for the marinade since I didn't have  panko or the egg sub. I had 6 chicken breasts and buttermilk that needed to be used. I absolutely love this marinade and will use it often. I used a combo of seasoned bread crumbs, parm and instant potato flakes with added garlic and black pepper. I've never been a fan of the double egg dipping so I left that out and just now realized that I forgot the added hot sauce at the end. I also cooked them on a rack and I used a lot of Franks in the buttermilk and could totally taste it on the chicken. Great marinade!

These were great! I took the advice of another reviewer and cooked them on a cooling rack.  I did not flip them, they were done in 20 minutes, and very little of the breading came off when I took them off the rack. I also used far less marinade than what the recipe called for.  Will definitely make them again.

I tried this both baked and fried. They both taste great, but the fried do look more appetizing. I did reduce the buttermilk, but also added some of the marinade mixture to the eggs. And frying in coconut oil is wonderful.

Very good, but prodices more than enough marinade and coating for at least 4 chicken breasts (that's what I did, for a total of 40 good-sized strips). I did not have egg substitute so I just used regular beaten eggs. I also cooked slightly longer. If you use a decent amount of spray and a gentle hand you won't lose much breading. I also tried the marinade on quartered and butterflied breasts; I patted them with a paper towel to remove the excess marinade, dredged lightly in a flour mixture (with salt, pepper, and garlic powder; no egg necessary) and fried up to make chicken sandwiches. Quite good but would probably be even tastier if the marinade was spicier, like half buttermilk and half hot sauce.

I love this. I make chicken breast with Panko bread crumbs all the time but they don’t taste this good . I used  chicken breast and slice them. I would make sure you put the hot sauce on toward the end like the directions. Also let chicken sit in frig for a few hours. I think that really made it taste so good. I dipped chicken in ranch dressing OMG

This is a good recipe. Used Panko breadcrumbs for the coating, worked very well. Ran out of breadcrumbs near the end, so didn't do the first coating - only the second, after the egg, and it didn't turn out as well- something about the double coating really gives it a good crunch. Moist chicken! Thanks :)

Not happy with how these turned out.  I needed way more panko to do the double dip.  The bottoms were super soggy and the coating came off when I tried to turn them.  I also baked them on a rack it wasn't a good turn out.  The one saving grace was the marinade.  It was AWESOME.
