I make this often for my husband, but usually we have this as a main dish rather than a side. I do add in a few extras, though: an egg (omelet-style, cut into small strips), 1 t. of curry powder, frozen peas or shelled edamame, and red pepper flakes to taste. 
Sometimes I'll omit the egg and add drained pineapple to change it up. 
All around a great basic recipe with room for a little creativity, and the leftovers are indeed amazing.

We omitted the green onion as I'm the only one that will eat them here but otherwise followed the directions as instructed. We really enjoyed this, my husband asked me to fix it again. I'm not sure how the rice was supposed to turn out (it was more greasy/mushy than anything) but had a really good flavor. Went great with a loaded baked potato (no, we don't count calories like we should) and green beans!

I almost  used this recipe as a suggested making small changes and it worked.
My sauce was Kikkoman's Teriyaki Baste and Glaze. 
 I used a precooked  chicken from Sam's. that I picked and pulled it clean after skin was removed and set it aside.
I cooked 2 bags of boil in the bag Jassimine rice as directed and set aside.
Chopped 1 Med yellow onion into small bits and set it aside.
With the stove set on Med/High, I fried 3/4 lb of bacon  until it was just starting to brown and lifted it out and set it aside to drain reserving 1 tsp of the grease while discarding the rest . I then  chopped the bacon into smaller pieces.
Next I added the onion to the same wok  stirring until it was  soft and splashed it with teriyaki sauce to my taste. stirred in   rice, chopped bacon, 
I microwaved a med. sized bag of mixed veggies and added it to the mix. 
 I then added more teriyaki  sauce  and stirred it in a few seconds until the mixture was fully coated and hot
Removed the wok from the stove and served on plates and  added some salad Wonton salad strips to the tops of the serving for added crunch.
Quick, no seasoning except the teriyaki and easy.
This is really good for halftime.

Liked this recipe because i changed so much.  I halved the qty's for three people and followed the method and it came out great.   I thought i had bacon. I didn't. Thought i had green onion.  I didn't.  Instead i substituted chopped up kielbasa for bacon, skipped any veggie altogether and added egg white for more low fat protein.   !

I made this and about the only thing I did differently was the amount of soy sauce and I added brocolli and garlic.

This recipe is amazing!! I did change up a few things: regular white rice instead of instant, purple onion sauteed, celery and some chicken bullion. This is now my go to chicken fried rice recipe.

I went far off the reservation on this. I never heard of fried rice made with bacon. Since I don’t like bacon, it had to go   I took others recommendations added peas & portobello mushrooms. I like thins spicy so I added red peppers. I did not have chicken breast’s I used thighs. I precooked reg long grain rice. The fried rice came out moist and spicy. I am pleased with the result.

This was a hit with my family who can tend to be very picky.  We added some egg, cilantro and pineapple for more flavor.  We will definitely be making this again.

Quick and easy to make. Very tasty. I added yellow peppers and peas to it so that we would have a few veggies with it.

After multiple changes everyone loved it. I couldn’t believe they didn’t add eggs or veggies so I did and everyone loved it.

The only change I made was that I used regular long grain white rice, not minute rice. It turned out great.
