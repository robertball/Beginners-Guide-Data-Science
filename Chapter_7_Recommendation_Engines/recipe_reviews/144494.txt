I posted the recipe and I appreciate the comments - well taken! I made this again last night, and I realized that I use a heck of more spices than I enter in the original posting; i use 1Tablespoon of paprika, and 1 Tablespoon of cummin. I fried the chicken for around 4 minutes epr side to get it seared and lightly brown on all sides. I used i cup of white wine (much to my husband's complaint that I was using his good wine on the chicken) and one cup of chicken broth. The peas I add at the last minute (usually 10 minutes before removing from the stove) and if the broth is too liquid, i add 1 to 2 teaspoons of flour mixed with some water to thicken the sauce. I learned this recipe from my mother, and she learned from her mothe, and so on, so I apologize for not having ever written the recipe more accurately - now you have it!  thank you for your comments and reviews. I am giving it a 4 start for my own oversight!

This was a good recipe but there is no way the chicken will fall off the bone in 25 minutes.  I did boil the potatoes before frying them and they came out good.  I did use more broth to cover chicken and adjusted seasonings.

This was good but not spectacular.  It was hearty but a tad bland and when I added the frozen peas they ended up looking and tasting like canned peas.  Next time I would add them near the end of the cooking time.  Although I wasn't too fond of this recipe I'd like to ask for recipes for pastel de choclo, panes chilenos like amasado or marraqueta, torta de mil hojas and any other Chilean recipe that you might have.

I could eat this EVERYDAY!  It is the best recipe I have ever tried - 'Tastes straight from mom's kitchen. This is served best with a glass of red Chilean wine and good company.

Thanks for this recipe.  
I rate it right in the middle.  I am not a great cook, but not a bad one either.  That being said, I always cook a new recipe as it is written the first time I cook it.  Though, I read Patty Q's review so I did use 1 cup of white wine instead of 1/2.  The liquid was very watery, so I added 1T of corn starch and 1T of cold water, mixed it up and poured it in.  I did that 3 times.  It was still watery.  I might not have waited long enough.  I guess how thick the liquid should be is a personal preference.
The chicken was good.  It had good flavor.  Next time I might at some cayenne pepper to give it a little zip. 
The fried potatoes were outstanding after they have been sitting in the liquid for a few minutes.  Crispy yet soft.    
I am glad I tried it and I will cook this again and tweak it now to my tastes now.
Thanks

Fabulous! Like the tastiest comfort food with upscale twist. I did make adjustments based solely on what I had on hand. Tweaks: used merlot instead of white, added fingerling potatoes whole w the other vegies, rather than frying separately, boneless breast (3 lg. halves) and made extra sauce/gravy w leftover seasoned flour that breasts were dredged in before browning, extra garlic and increased broth and wine by another half. Served w small seasoned baguette toast slices, this became a bit of a stew as I just let it simmer for 90 minutes and increased the flavor to a wonderful aroma. The toasts used to dip in complimented this dish and whole effort created a one dish heavenly meal!
