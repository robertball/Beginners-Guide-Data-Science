Wow!  My husband who was getting sick of chicken on the grill absolutely loved this.  I cut the chicken into chunks for kabobs and let it mariate all day.  In addition to 1/2 c. lemon juice I used the juice of one whole lemon and lemon zest.  I also cut the rosemary down to 1/2 tablespoon and then added FRESH rosemary.  I also added some minced garlic, dijon mustard, and worcestershire. This is a definite keeper!

I cooked the chicken on my newest gadget (a George Foreman grill), and it only took 9 minutes!  I only had four hours to marinade the chicken (not overnight).  But, it turned out great.  My husband thought the chicken was moist and delicious (he even commented on how moist the leftovers were the next day).  My eleven month old daughter also gave it two thumbs up.  Thanks Barbara for this quick and tasty recipe.

Great recipe!!  Be sure to "mash" your rosemary leaves
to cause them to release their aromatics.  I use the stems to stick into the meat
and this also release flavor.

I make something very similiar to this recipe and it comes out fabulous! The key is worcestershire sauce. I would put in about 1/4 of a cup and use fresh rosemary rather than dried. Use it liberally. If you bake this rather then grill do not have marinate but I would say to cook it for 45min to an hour. Goes great with couscous!!!

This was delicious! Not kidding. I marinated it for over 24 hours and that was the key. It had a wonderful lemon flavor. I ended up broiling it though instead of grilling. Highly recommend!

I was very surprised that a recipe with such few ingredients would produce something so yummy!!  My husband, my 11 year old daughter, and 8 year old son, and myself LOVED this chicken! They asked for it again tomorrow! We cooked it on the BBQ and it was nice and moist,and full of flavour. Served it with a greek salad with creamy dressing.  Delicious!! =)

This recipe is very quick and easy!  I cut the chicken into 1 inch cubes and marinated it for at least 24 hours.  I put the cubes on skewers and cooked them on the grill.  They kabobs were superb.

Loved this chicken.  I added a tsp of dijon mustard and a clove of minced garlic to the marinade.  This was delicious.  I will make this again for sure.

So much flavor with just a few ingredients!  I did like this very much,  but could not give it five stars because, though we like lemon a lot, as written, this marinade is noiceably too lemon-ey. One of my kids asked me why his chicken tasted kind of like pie!  That being said, he did eat every bit of his dinner, and then some.  My chicken marinated for about seven hours, and like other reviewers I added more rosemary and some garlic into the mix.  I then cooked it on a foreman grill.  The result was so tender, tasty and flavorful that I couldn't believe how quick and easy this recipe was.  The next time I make this, I'll just use half the amount of lemon juice.

Sorry but I did not like this recipe at all. The chicken was way too "lemony" and the flavor was much too strong. Basically it tasted like lemon-soaked, bland chicken. I did like that I had all the ingredients on hand, but next time I'll cut the lemon juice and add another liquid in its place, along with some herbs and spices.

Marinated the chicken overnight and cooked it in the pan in olive oil--it was delicious, the lemon and rosemary in perfect balance--will absolutely be making it again.

I gave this a 3 because it was a little too lemony...my husband and I enjoyed it and we definitely want to have it again, but I'll change some things next time. This time I used 4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts and marinated them for 4 hours. I added some fresh ground black pepper and 1 clove of minced garlic to the marinade. I cooked two breasts at a time on my George Foreman grille for about 9 minutes. Next time I'll add a little more garlic and less lemon juice. The chicken turned out very tender.

I'm not a chicken lover but I have to say this was GREAT!!  I marinated the chicken breast in lime and lemon juice, added just a bit of garlic powder and onion powder.  Unfortunately, I forgot to add the rosemary which I will do next time.  Even without the rosemary, it was fantastic.  Baked it in my toaster oven and PERFECTION !!!  UPDATE:  Did it again and used a tad (and i mean a tad) of tarragon instead of rosemary.  Put everything in a zip lock bag the night before because the chicken was still frozen.  OH MY GOD.  I dont like chicken but this is a MUST!!!

Has the taste of fish more than chicken. I felt like this marinade turned chicken into a wonderful fish dish.

Easy and delicious! This chicken is excellent and so healthy, and you DO NOT need a grill! You also definitely do NOT have to marinade it that long- an hour or so is plenty because the lemon juice is very acidic and soaks into the chicken quickly. I cook this on an oiled skillet on high heat on my stove for about 5 minutes per side, and it turns out great. Very tender and flavorful, no salt needed! Serve with salad and/or rice.

Another recipes that proves one does not need a lot of ingredients to produce a lovely meal.   Do prefer to use fresh herbs plus some garlic.

This was the best chicken marinate I've ever had. The chicken was juicy and tastey. I made one small change to the recipe - I added one clove of chopped garlic to the marinate. I will definitely make this again! Thanks for sharing.

I thought this was excellent!  I only had enough lemons to get the lemon juice, so I omitted sliced lemons.  I used severl sprigs of fresh rosemary, "bruised" to release aroma and oils, and added a large clove of minced garlic to the marinade.  Marinated for 8 hours.  There's a subtle lemon flavor, but not overpowering at all, and the chicken came out so tender and moist.  This will be perfect for my lunchtime salads this week! Thanks!

This was absolutely delicious cooked on the grill even without a speck of salt!  The only changes I made was to add a couple of cloves of crushed garlic and I used fresh rosemary instead of dried.  I have to watch my sodium intake but the two guys who were with me thought they were great without salt and didn't add any even though the salt shaker was right there.  Oh yeah, it wasn't really intentional but I ended up marinating the chicken for about 48 hours before I cooked them.  Probably a half-day would have been sufficient.  I'll definitely be making this recipe again.  Thanks!

This was delicious!  Definitely let the chicken marinate as long as you can, for the flavor to really get into the chicken.

Awesome dish with very few ingredients.  Only 3 stars since the taste of lemon is over-powering.  I let it marinate about 2 hours, but that was too long.  Maybe an hour at the most.
The rosemary was straight from the garden - fresh is always better.  This dish went great with garlic mashed potatoes.

Love this.  Didn't use the lemon slices just straight lemon juice and then added a tablespoon of crushed garlic.  and Used fresh rosemary.  Huge hit with my friends.

As suggessted by other reviewers, I added garlic and dijon. The marinade is delicious! Both times I have made it I only had two hours to marinate the chicken before putting it on the grill. It still had a lot of lemon and rosemary flavor. If it marinated longer, the flavor might be too powerful.

My fiance loves this recipe!!  However I did make a few changes.  I did make it the first time with rosemary and it was a little overwhelming.  So the next time I substituted basil, and he said it was perfect.  I also chose to bake it rather than grill it!!  Thanks again.

I cut the marinade to one serving and used it over 2 chicken breasts. I didn't have real lemon on hand so I just used the juice.    I marinated for 24 hours. I broiled the chicken breasts for 10 minutes. I thought it needed some thing else than the lemon flavor, so I basted with a mix of lemon, worchester and garlic for 3 more minutes on each side. It gave it a great carmel color.  The flavor ended up being garlicy/worchester on the outside and juicy lemon on the inside. The rosemary was a good compliment to these flavors.  I would recommend trying it if you like lemon flavor as I do. It was served with mashed potatos, garlic/cheese biscuits and corn. YUM!

I guess I'm giving this 4 stars because as others have said an overnight marinade would simply be too overpowering. I only marinaded one hour, partly because I was short on time; I didn't even add the sliced lemon and though it was delicious just like this, I can't imagine marinating much longer.

I made this simple recipe as stated.  Maybe my rating shouldn't count.  I don't usually cook with lemon, or marinate with it.  If I decide to make again I will not marinate over night--maybe just a couple hours at most. The lemon was overpowering to my pallet.  If you like lemony flavored foods, you will probably enjoy this recipe.  Thanks for sharing.

I love how simple this recipe is and cooked my chicken on a Foreman grill as some others had done.  It is a bit too lemony for me but I loved the taste of the rosemary.  The only caveat with using the Foreman grill is that a good amount of the moisture in the chicken may get pressed out.

I really liked this dish! I ended up making it with white rice and a southwest veggie blend (it's what I had) and it was filling and really flavorful.  There was a lot of lemon tang though, I'm not sure if it's because of the season or what, I might add just a pinch of sugar the next time, see if that helps it any.  I will be making this one again and I'm also thinking it would be a great marinate for fish!

This recipe was pretty good, I thought it had a little too much lemon juice, but next time I'll just use more olive oil and less juice. I'll definitely make it again.

I doubled the recipe and marinated it overnight.  As usual, I over cooked the chicken on the grill and thought it would be dry, but it wasn't.  It was still very moist and tasty. Very easy to make.  Presention was also nice.  I placed the chicken on a nice serving platter w/lemon slices and fresh rosemary sprigs as garnish.  I will use this recipe often.  I'm glad I made extra because it was great to have a piece the next day for lunch.

This marinade was very simple.. just the way I like it. I added garlic and dijon, as suggested in other reviews, and some extra rosemary. I decided to blend the marinade so there weren't large pieces of rosemary. Delicious!

We marinated this overnight and enjoyed the lemon/rosemary flavour but we thought it needed something a little more.  Maybe some garlic would have helped, as we found this rather bland.

I enjoyed this dish a great deal but I agree the taste of lemon is very strong.  I only marinated it for an hour and not overnight and the taste of lemon was still very strong, so if you don't like that (which I do) then you should reduce the amount of lemon.

Wonderful. We used fresh lemons from the tree and fresh basil instead (No rosemary in this years garden.) We tumbled it for 10 minutes in the vacuum marinater. The lemon was a bit strong, but we liked it that way.

Warning-the lemon flavoring in this chicken is VERY strong. Combined with the rosemary my roomate thought it tasted like chicken marinated in pin-sol. If I made this again I would GREATLY reduce the amt of lemon.

Pretty good but wayyyyyy to much lemon for my taste!  I cut the recipie down to 1 serving, cut the amount of lemon juice in half,  added 3 extra tablespoons of olive oil, and a bunch of fresh rosemary.  I used 3 thin sliced chicken breasts, and let them marinate for about 45 mins or so.  I threw them in the oven for about 7 mins, and they where perfect!  I also added salt and pepper.

This was really good and EASY.  I put it in the marinade before my daughter's soccer practice and cooked it when we got home on the GF grill.  Even though it only marinated for 2 hours it still had a lot of flavor.  Thanks Barbara

Very light, fresh and refreshing. I made this for my roommates for our monthly dinner! The lemon we had  was a bit bitter, but tasted ok grilled. We do not have a grill, and used our stove top...it tasted just fine.

I followed the recipe exactly. This recipe is ok. I would only make it again if I had all the ingredients and was in a hurry. However, it is not anything special and feels like it's lacking something.

I liked this, but I'm not sure I got the whole effect bc I recently changed the burner on my grill.  Needless to say, the flame is much higher and food is cooking much more quickly than I expect it to!  So the chicken was a little charred.  However, it's a good recipe.  I marinated it for a while, as I defrosted the chicken in the marinade.  It's a bit much lemon for bf, I think though, so I'll have to do it separately next time.  I did add garlic and I think it could use more garlic and a few more seasonings as well.  Thanks for sharing.

So moist!  I marinated a whole chicken cut-up for 7 hours with double the marinate (I didn't add garlic as some recommended - but will add it in the future - it really does need some garlic). Four adults devoured all but a small piece I ate for lunch the next day. I WILL make this again and again - and make sure there are leftovers each time (and we don't do leftovers often!).  Thank you, Barbara!

The marinade is great.  I don't like a lot of lemon flavor (personal preference) so I use a sauce from another recipe to put over the top of this.  It is a delicious combination.  The recipe is Baked Lemon Chicken with Mushroom sauce.

This was delicious! I will definitely make it again.  Not a lemon fan but it was not over the top- just a palate pleaser.  I served it with roasted veggies and it was a smash!!!!

I did this for 8 minutes on my George Foreman grill. I loved the rosemary flavor but found the lemon taste a bit strong. It might be because I marinated for almost 24 hours. I also found that it needed salt (and I rarely add salt to any meal after it's cooked).

Marinade tastes great just need to add some salt to the chicken before you put it in the marinade.

Rating this based on the recipe as close to as-presented as possible.

I don't have a grill (I live in a tiny downtown apartment, and I have more closet space than kitchen space), so I baked this for 35m on 350F after marinating for 8h. Still came out delicious--juicy and flavorful, well-balanced. It's pretty good for folks who don't expect a strong lemon flavor in their chicken. It's quick and easy to put together during my lunch break to put in the fridge for dinner later.

For me, though, it was missing... something. I really like lemon, so I added another whole lemon to the marinade. This brought the flavor more in line with what I want: vigorous, strong lemon to better compliment the natural flavor of the meat and the rosemary. With that extra lemon (and another three hours marinating), this is a five-star recipe in my mind--but I can't rate it as-written that way.

I loved this.  I add a bit more sliced lemon to the recipe because I just love the flavor. Also, I keep it covered with foil.  My chicken were nice and moist even for left overs!

I choose this recipe because I was cooking a gluten free meal for a friend. I followed the recipe except i used fresh rosemary and left out the lemon slices because I didn't have them. The chicken was pretty moist. I did grind some salt and pepper on the chicken pieces as well. We let them marinate for 3-4 hours.

Yummy!! I always roast whole chickens with lemon, olive oil, rosemary (fresh) and it is always yummy. Never would have thought to marinade and grill.  I added more oil by accident and sprinkled garlic powder on while on my cast iron grill... can't wait to try on grill outside!

Great recipe. Easy. Chicken was very moist from the marinade. I added fresh rosemary, chopped and garlic. I added it to my recipe box. The entire family loved it.

Easy recipe and good too.  I substituted lime juice for lemon juice/lemon.  In addition I added garlic (is there life without garlic??) powder prepared it on top of the stove. I poured my boiled potatoes into the skillet afterwards and added a bit of liquid to pick up the flavor of the seasonings.  

It was good!!

I wasn't crazy about this, but I think its just a matter of personal taste. Although I love lemon, I'm not sure I like it paired with chicken. Worth trying, though.

I marinaded the chicken for only two hours and it the lemon flavour was a little much. I wouldn't reccommend 8 hours or overnight! Also the rosemary was too strong. I would only use 1 tablespoon at the most if I were to make again. But it wasn't by any means a complete disaster.

This was pretty good - except my chicken turned out a little dry and I'm not sure I liked the rosemary pieces that stuck to the chicken while it was cooking.  I think my chicken would have been better if I had reserved some marinade to baste the chicken with while cooking.

This was ok, we actually all thought it was too "rosemary".  I saved the leftovers and used it on a caesar salad, it tasted better.
