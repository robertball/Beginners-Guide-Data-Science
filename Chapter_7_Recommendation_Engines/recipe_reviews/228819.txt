Great simple recipe.  I didn't use a packet to season the turkey-  It's just as easy and a tastes a lot better to use your own spices.  I also added queso fresco b/c I felt that it was missing a little something.  I will definitely make this healthy, flavorful dinner again!

First time I used Turkey and this ended up being a hit for my daughter and I. Added the cheese and tamatoes for my daughters taste preference.

This is a good, easy meal to make (and I've made it many times), but it is also very high in sodium and doesn't give any flavor complexity and additional nutrients that would be gained through individual ingredients instead of a flavor packet.

I'm not a big fan of this recipe being an obvious plug by the seasoning/shell manufacturer.

It's really good and very fast! I also felt it was a little less flavorful than I'd like ( saw another review said the same thing) so I added cumin and chili powder ( made it have so much more flavor! .... and , my bf and I added sriracha at the end also. Now it's  PERFECT for us.
