Great recipe - and a great combination of flavors! The only thing I did differest was using fresh spinach instead of eggplant. I love the addition of the kalamata olives! This was a nice twist on regular baked ziti. It paired great with a garden salad, warm bread, and a glass of wine.

3.12.17  One comment would be to get your sausage/sauce going before you cook your pasta because IMO, ideally, you want to mix in the pasta right after you drain it.  The sausage/sauce mixture takes a while, so if the pasta sits out too long after being drained (like mine did today), it tends to dry out and flatten the tubular pasta.  Not a big deal, but that’s what I’lll do next time.  After I mixed everything together, it seemed VERY dry, so I did add in some tomato juice for fear of this drying out too much in the oven.  Used hot sausage, loved the kalamata olives (probably will add even more next time and maybe some red pepper flakes), and I may even add a small can of tomato sauce.  This recipe makes a lot, and in this house, it’s probably 7-8 servings (but we're not big eaters) when served with salad and hot  bread.  Thoroughly enjoyed, and looking forward to some yummy leftovers.

If you love Mediterranean flavors, you will love this dish.  I followed the recipe with the exception of using dried basil instead of the fresh.  I also didn’t bother with broiling the cheese at the end because my results when I use a broiler are usually disastrous.   We enjoyed this dish and thought it was very good.

This recipe is not worth saving. Way too much cheese and the proportion of pasta to "sauce" is way off, decrease the pasta to coat it all. Way too much sausage as well, but then I noticed it was provided by Johnsonville so I guess that is why.

Mixed it up the night before then baked it topped with mozzarella  and Parmesan for lunch the next day. Just delicious but takes many Ingredients and a bit of time to make.

This is dish is definitely what I would a call hearty, stick to your ribs meal. My grocery store didn’t have ground Italian sausage so I used the links and just removed the casings.  If anyone is concerned about using wine don’t worry, you can’t taste it. The wine adds another layer of flavor to this dish as did the eggplant. We will have this one again soon.

This is by far the best baked Ziti Recipe I've made!  So flavorful and delicious with leftovers as well!  I have read other reviews and honestly thought the recipe delivered exactly as written, I do wait to add the finish layer of mozzarella cheese until after I uncover the dish and put back in the oven for the last 5 minutes.  Thank for the great recipe!

Always great with Johnsonville! So easy to make and always turns out like a gourmet dish. I alter the ingredients based on what I have on hand, but using the core ingredients you can't go wrong.

This was pretty good.  I added about half of the wine it called for based on the comments by another reviewer that the wine was overpowering.  I added a pinch of dried oregano and about 3/4 teaspoon of sugar to make it not so acidic.

I tried this recipe and with the recommended amount of red wine, the sauce ended up tasting exactly like red wine. I had to dilute it with water and then when that didn't work, added in cheese to change the taste and texture. I wouldn't make this again.
