I added one more apple, 4 granny smiths and two honeycrisps. I also used tapioca instead of flour. Then I put the juices from the apples in a small pot, on medium to low heat, and slowly added heavy whipping cream until it was the consistency I wanted, about 1/2 cup. Bring to a boil for about 3 to 5 minutes then add about a 1/4 cup of caramel sauce to the apple mixture. Heat sauce until boiling. After the pie comes ot of the oven pour the sauce mixture on top of the crumble and let it cool. 
Next time I make this recipe I'm going to add carmel sauce to the apples before they go into the pie crust. 
One more thing instead of the edges of the crust laying flat I made a lip so I could have more pie filling.

My family loved this! We're going to be making it again for next Thanksgiving. 
I didn't stray from the recipe at all.

I made this for a Thanksgiving dinner and it was delicious!  The only thing I would do9 slightly different is to use a bit more of the initial crust mixture for the bottom, reserving less for the top.  I was a little short on the bottom crust and had more than enough for the top. Still-delicious!

I did not make any changes. I have made it twice and it was delicious. It is great to not have to make a crust for the pie. My family raved about it when I made it for Thanksgiving. 
I definitely give it a 5 star rating

This pie is delicious.  The only problem I had was that the pie crust stuck.  I greased the pie plate but it was very difficult to get the pieces out of the plate.

The only changes I did is added carmel dip to the top of the apples. Oh so good.
