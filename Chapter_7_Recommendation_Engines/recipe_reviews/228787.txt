Added more curry powder to the ketchup, but that's a personal taste preference.  I cooked the potatoes for close to 30 minutes to get crisp fries.  Nice, the curry ketchup really is the focal point on this recipe.

Like the reviewer before me, I also ended up roasting the sweet potatoes longer. About 35 minutes.THey looked crisp but still were not crunchy by any means. Think you have to batter them for that to work out?

As far as the dip, I did make a few changes and it was so amazing, I ran out of sweet potatoes and started looking for other things to dip in it in the fridge (settled on sweet mini peppers.. also a great pairing)! Here is what I did differently: I heated the oil, then added 1 clove of minced garlic, and 1 shallot chopped about 30 seconds after the garlic. I had made breaded tenderloin in the pan just before, so that have contributed to the flavor. After sauteeing for about 3 minutes I added a scoop (maybe 1/2 tablespoon) of red curry paste as I could not find my curry powder. I mixed it in well then spooned it all out into a bowl and added about 1/2 cup of ketchup. I then found the curry powder and added a dash or two. OMG is all I can say, it was amazing!

Interesting...I've actually never had Sweet Potato's. Granted I'm embarrassed and humbled by that. I wasn't looking for a candied type recipe...shooting more for a vegetable thing. I added a couple cloves or smashed, diced garlic to the dip without looking at the limited number of reviews. Added more Curry as well...plus a bit of Turmeric (I have no idea about what I was trying to do). I used less salt than called for on the SPF (sweet potato fries) plus used some Smoked Paprika in the sauce vs regular Paprika (don't ask me why). I just flipped them after 15 minutes...stay tuned. They smell good. I also have continued to add MORE Curry to the sauce to the possible point of too much, be sure to taste the sauce as you're going. The result is very good for my first time with Sweet Potato's. BTW, the were the most red ones of 3 varieties at the grocery store (more Vit A).

Turned out great. I modified the sauce. Hubby doesn't like curry or things too spicy, so I used 1/2 c sr cream & 1/2 c catsup and 1/2 t curry.

The star of this recipe is the ketchup. I never eat ketchup with my sweet potatoes...until now! This ketchup concoction is fabulous! I didn't have quite enough regular ketchup, so I finished out the measuring cup with jalape√±o ketchup. I think I'll do that every time! And, yes, as others have stated, you do have to cook the potatoes a little longer.

Easy Sweet Potato Fries w/ Curry Ketchup Haiku: "Make this for the dip. Sweet potatoes just okay, ketchup was the star!" I roasted my sweet potatoes (flipped over half-way thru) for closer to 35-40 min. to get some nice brown charred spots. They tasted good, nothing outstanding, and if made as directed, pulling them out at 20 min. would've been too squishy for us. The curry ketchup on the other hand was AWESOME. I want to use it on meatloaf, fries, baked potatoes, eggs, cupcakes (j/k), but seriously, very easy recipe and tasty!

Everyone in the house came to the kitchen when I started heating the curry and green onions - the aroma was amazing! As the other reviewers stated, I had to roast the sweet potatoes longer too. Overall, it was a great side recipe when you're in the mood for a little something different.  It went great with our BBQ!
