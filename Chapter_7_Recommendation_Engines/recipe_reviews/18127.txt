I served this recipe at an Australian International dinner I was hosting and everyone found it to bee to hot from the mustard.  Next time I would use less mustard or maybe try a milder variety!

I was very pleased with this low cal, low fat alternative to regular salad dressing. Yogurt is so versatile and you can pretty much make any kind of mock dressing you want. The second time I tryed it I made a "Russian" version using catsup. Really good Buttercake and thanks!

Quick and simple -- and refreshing blend of lemon and dijon flavours. Great for summer salads.

wanted more lemony taste, so I added 50% more lemon and some grated lemon peel, but everyone thought it was delicious with shrimp.

Last night I made this for dinner to put on a chicken salad for my boyfriend. To me it was okay. I am giving it 4 stars because I added greek yogurt, instead of the regular yogurt so I think it is unfair to give it a true rating. The dressing had an acid taste to it, which can be a bother to people have a light stomach.

Easy-peasy, and very delicious. I use regular, not fat free yoghurt, and it was so nice and creamy.

This was so easy and tasty, it would complement anything from a lamb dinner to a healthy caesar-ish salad.

I did not have any herbs in the fridge, but really had a craving for a hearty salad with yogurt dressing. 

I decided to give this recipe a try, and omitted the herbs. It turned out delicious! I have used this dressing in BBQ beef salad (spinach with BBQ beef) and Grilled Asparagus Salad. This dressing complemented both salads. 

It is healthy, creamy and extremely fulfilling.

Great base I could play with a little. I did add a half teaspoon each of onion/garlic powder and some fresh ground pepper. The husband and kids didn't much care for it but I thought it was pretty good. I'll make this again as a low cal dip just for me, maybe thinning it out a bit with lowfat buttermilk or fat free milk.

I only used 1/2 c of yogurt (I used Greek too.) because I was only making enough kale for 2. I did keep the lemon and mustard amounts the same to give it a bit more flavor.

It was too acidic from lemon for me. 
So I went straight to using this middle eastern recipe for yogurt sauce instead that I've been using for a while. I'd recommend looking up "pasta with yogurt sauce" on allrecipes for a really good yogurt sauce.

I added  some variations.  -- a tablespoon of honey, a clove of garlic and some fresh herbs from the garden  -- Basil and thyme.  I didn't have any parsley.  Also a touch of salt.

I found this dressing to be very tart.  I think 1 teaspoon of lemon juice would be plenty & I would probably add a little garlic & maybe 1 tablespoon of mayonnaise.  I see it has earned 4 1/2 stars, so maybe it's just my taste.

It was too acidic and bland for my taste, so I added honey and salt and pepper.  Turned out pretty good after that.

I added sweet pickle and capers and I felt there was more it needed to be totally satisfying.  It was a nice basic recipe that could easily be adapted to a person's palate.  By itself, it's a little tart for my taste.

This was a total miss for us -  the flavors totally didn't work for us (and we like all of them separately).  All we tasted was the yogurt and lemon.  After it sat for a couple of hours in the refrigerator, I tried to save it by adding more chives and parsley.  After another hour I tasted it and dumped in some dill.  Very disappointing, especially considering I bought the ingredients just for this recipe.

Yum!  I am trying not to eat a crazy amount of fat with my coleslaw and was hoping for inspiration on how to use yogurt to lighten it up.  I actually did not use the cilantro or green onions in this case but just combined some greek yogurt, mustard, and lemon juice...I just started out conservative with the lemon and mustard (didn't really measure) and made it to taste.  I also added a little mayo and salt and pepper at the end.  I guess I didn't really make the recipe exactly but the inspiration turned out great.  I just combined the dressing with shredded cabbage and carrot.
