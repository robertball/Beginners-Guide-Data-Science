These are OK for a quick lunch if needed. I've tried them several times, and I find that we like to roll out the biscuits and then bake them for about 5 minutes first, then put on the toppings and return to the oven for 10-15 minutes. Otherwise, the crust is too soft and mushy in the middle for us. We prefer using flour tortillas or pitas instead of these for individual pizzas.

This is my family's favorite quick dinner. When I make these, I like to use homemade pizza sauce and turkey pepperoni. This bends well to whatever toppings you have on hand--cut up meatloaf, taco meat, chopped veggies.......make a pizza bar and have everyone make their own speciality pizza. To make this a complete meal, I like to serve it with a veggie platter with a lowfat ranch dressing.

I made this for the kids after school snack. They loved them. I put the biscuit into a ziploc bag and flattened them out that way, it made it easier to shape them that way.

sprinkle some white cornmeal on surface that you will be rolling out the biscuit dough.  It changes the crust consistency to nice and chewy.  This is an old Pampered Chef trick with using biscuit dough. We liked the recipe very much.  Should be a 4 star one.

We really enjoyed these. The only Grands we had on hand today were the flaky ones. I didn't think it would turn out right using those but they were pretty good! Gave it a slightly sweet flavor but we didn't mind. Followed the recipe as written, only difference was I cooked the biscuits 5 minutes, pulled them out, topped them and cooked for the remaining 5 minutes. All the guys agreed to having them again!

Love pizza, but trans fats seem unavoidable with these Pilsbury products. Suggest trying same type from Trader Joes - trans fat free.

5 stars because its quick and easy and tasty!  When you are tired and don't want to deal with making your own crust, this is the way to go for sure.  I personalized it by using Lizabeth Lane Tomatillo Cilantro Pizza Sauce, chicken pieces, and roasted red peppers.  Cheese was a mix of mozzarella, provolone and parm.  When you don't want a lot of clean up or mess to deal with but need something quick, MAKE THESE!

These would work great for kids. However, for myself a good pizza, really has to have a good crust. I felt that even though I pressed these into exactly the 6" sized shape they still had a biscuit aftertaste. I even rubbed them with a little olive oil. I made 1/2 recipe and one is plenty for one person. I even tried the vegetarian version on the bottom, but unlike normally I preferred the cheese and pepperoni one more. My husband though, said they were better than the boxed frozen pizzas. He enjoyed the pepperoni and cheese ones.

8 and 9 yr old girls and 54 yr old woman and 57 yr old male in this household LOVED these pizzas. I made pepperoni for one girl and added mushrooms, black olives, turkey pepperoni for others and everyone was impressed. The girls commented they love the crust, not too hard and too squishy, in their words. For children going through the faze of teeth coming and going these are very welcome. The flavor of the crust was exceptional. Much better than the english muffin type. For the next sleep over these are a must.

I love these. and you can change toppings infinitely, but please do consider it's just as easy to make your own biscuit dough - and if you want that layered flakiness that grands has - here's what you can try, after making your biscuit dough (from mix or scratch) - roll out into a very thin square/rectangle - slice the square into 4 to 6 equal pieces. with a pastry brush, lightly brush the squares with a softened unsalted butter,(melted works too, but I think softened is best with the butter- and I've also used EVOO or sour cream and regular old on sale salted butter to brush on with pretty good result) then lay each layer atop the other until you have 4 to 6 layers.  cut into squares or rounds and lightly press out for your 6 inch mini pizza's. The amount of mini pizzas you get varies depending on the amount of dough you make. Of course, you have to watch the baking time because again, the amount of dough and how thick you make the mini pizza will effect cook time. Just Wonderful and... either way, grands or homemade dough - less expensive :) than delivery - or take out! :)

I love this recipe and have been using it for several months. We have used many different toppings: deli roast beef, green peppers and onions to name only one. Because I'm losing weight, the ability to have portion control and still have pizza is great for me. I definately recommend this receipe.

I can fully see where these would be OK for the kids, but bottom line, the crust still tastes like a biscuit, not pizza crust.  I didn't have any pizza sauce, but did have some meat sauce left from a pasta dish, so I used that as well as the turkey pepperoni in the fridge.  Yes, these were easy and fast, but I plan to stick with my other "quick & easy" mini pizzas using English muffins.   They may not really taste like pizza crust either, but they're closer in taste and do get crisp and crunchy.

This recipe was pretty good & very easy. I baked them for 15 minutes but I think they could have been left in a little longer because the biscuit dough was very soft, almost mushy in the center. We used Sausage & meatball that I had leftover for our toppings.

Super easy and the biscuits gave it a nice taste without a hard crust which my kids prefer.  I wasn't expecting a tradional pizza taste knowing I was using biscuits. Perfect as a snack or appetizer or for the late night munchies.

This is easy to make in a quick pinch or in my case to get rid of the biscuits before they go bad. Watch the time and make sure they're good and brown so the middle is cooked all the way. the edges were brown for me but the middles needed to cook a little more and we didn't realize it until we started eating them.

Perfect for kids.  Easy and fun for the little ones to help out.  We rolled the dough in plastic zip lock bags open to keep everything nice and neat.  My son is a very picky eater and he loved it.  We now make on a fairly regular basis.

I can't believe we've never made these before. The kids loved rolling them out and topping them with all their favorites. They went nuts for them. I baked at 350 for 10mins but they didn't look done in the middle Although, the bottoms were golden. So, I turned off the oven and put them back in for 3more mins. They were perfect and delicious!

This was a fast, easy and kid-friendly recipe. We cut up low-fat string cheese to use and added turkey pepperoni.

Easy, quick, versatile.  A little soft in the middle.  Ours came out salty, not sure if it was the biscuts, or the sauce.  Would make again because of the ease & versatility, nice that they're individual so that each person can choose which toppings they want.  And the kids had fun, so that's half the battle right there.

I have to say I was a little wary of using canned biscuit dough for pizza crust, however,  I was pleasantly surpised at how good this was.  I was able to put it together in minutes and it was very tasty.  The only complaint I would have is that the middle section of the pizza was a little soggy & soft.   I will make these again, but, will take the advice of some of the other reviewers and pre-bake the crust for a couple of minutes before adding the toppings.

I kept the grandgirls last night for a sleepover. They came up with the idea of having a breakfast party. So I decided to have Grands Ham and Cheese Melts, Grandwich Breakfast Sandwiches, and Grands Mini Pizzas. Grands for the Grands breakfast party was a hit! Of course, this was the girls' favorite, probably because they made them! Simple enough for a 2-yr.-old to make with a little supervision.

I generally like a crunchier crust on a pizza but these were quick and easy, and pretty tasty.  I might try brushing the crust with garlic butter next time for a little extra flavor.  Would definitely make them again.

Excellent easy lunch or appetizer for kids.  I made this two ways, one time I rolled it out and cut them with a biscuit cutter and made mini pizzas.  Was good, and easy.

Even easier, I made the biscuits and then split them and made 16 mini pizzas.  Tasted the same, was a little more substance to hold onto, and playing with toppings was of course fun.  

Nice light crust.  Will make with the kids and teens for sure.

Easy peasy. One thing different. I bake them first for about 5 min. Take them out and press down the center and form a crust with a soup spoon. Add the toppings 
(Kraft Mozzarella with Philly) and bake an additional 10-12 min

These were very good. They make for a quick lunch or a weeknight dinner. I precooked my dough for 5 minutes, then put toppings, then cooked for an additional 5 minutes. I also used the ziploc bag trick that another reviewer suggested. Super easy to flatten your dough that way! I will be making these again.

These were okay, but I guess I prefer less of a biscuit-y crust with my pizzas.  The biscuit also soaked up a lot of the sauce.  Not my favorite, but quick and easy to throw together.

This was a very quick recipe to prepare. My only problem was that the center of the crust wasn't quite done. I think next time, I will pre-cook the crust for a minute or so before adding the ingredients. Other wise, I really liked it.

If you are expecting a traditional pizza style crust, you’ll be disappointed.  However, if you are looking for a tasty, effortless lunch or snack, this is very good and I’m sure the kids will enjoy it.

I love the idea of fast individual pizzas! We don't like pepperoni in my family so we topped ours with mushroom, Italian sausage, and bacon. It was a huge success in my family and we will definitely make these again. Next time we will use corn flour on our work surface so the pizzas don't stick to the surface.

Can't believe I liked this made with easy pizza sauce III with Hungarian sweet paprika. The we added cooked Italian Sausage and (who knew) thinly slice sopreseta salami. We made this for the kids as a pizza party and adults ate all of it.
