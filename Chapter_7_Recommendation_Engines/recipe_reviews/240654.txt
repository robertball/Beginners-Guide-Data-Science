This was simple & delicious!   I  used garlic powder instead of fresh garlic, & I didn't have Adobo spice, but it was perfect without it.  I also added carrots and potatoes.  The roast made its own gravy and it wasn't greasy.  I didn't thicken the gravy, or add extra salt.  The bouillon was enough.  (I used "Better than Bouillon," which comes in a jar).   I will definitely make this again.

This was good. I used a 2.5 pound roast and it only needed 3 hours to reach a medium internal temperature. I also used a bit more adobe seasoning than requested, rubbing the whole roast before browning. It came out tender and juicy. Thank you MYBADA for your recipe

I used the McCormick Brazilian Steakhouse marinade packs (2) for my 3.5lb roast a day in advance. I followed the recipe and found that even though I had a huge roast, my crockpot slow cooker set on high for 4 hours was way too long. At about the 3 hour mark I checked up on it and it was already way overcooked. I would recommend perhaps cooking it on LOW for 3-4 hours. Other than people being disappointed with the rarity of the meat (It was all well done), the flavor was fantastic and the recipe was fun and easy to follow. I would definitely try this again, but I would adjust the cooking temp and times.

So simple, so easy, so perfection.  

For those that find themselves without beef bullion (because I didn't have any either):  I used garlic salt sprinkled over the whole roast before searing.  After I saute'd the onions I de-glazed the pan with 1 cup of water. I made sure to pour the liquid into the bottom of the slow-cooker but still pile the onions on top of the roast.

The resulting gravy/broth from the roast was like Au Jus!  It would make an amazing onion cream gravy if you want to take to the next level.  The broth is pretty salty so be careful.  The roast was seasoned perfectly.

This was delicious! Tri-tip is my favorite cut of beef for roasts and stews. I too added baby red potatoes and carrots (with roast on top) so I doubled the water and bouillon. Adobe seasoning made a nice flavorful broth. Thanks for a wonderful recipe!

Made adjustment only for cooking temp as my tri tip was only 1.90 lbs.. cooked 4 hrs on low.. used same exact ingredients.. Husband called it roast beef cotton candy... very tender. Great recipe as written.

This was my first time making tri tip in the slow cooker. I usually broil in the oven however I found my new favorite way to make it. This recipe is simple and delicious. The meat was so tender and packed with flavor. I substituted beef broth in place of the water for more flavor and it turned out great! Hubby was very happy!

I used a rump roast(close enough):It was very good. Following directions exactly for 2.5 lb roast. The meat was med well which is the way everyone here likes it. I strained some of the broth to make gravy. I sliced the beef and kept it warm in small amt of broth and onions in the slow cooker until it was time to eat.

I cooked my dish on high for two hours and then turned the crockpot down to low for the next two hours.

Easy and delicious! I've made this multiple times. I don't have adobo seasoning so I just add dashes of salt pepper oregano and turmeric (some of the spices in adobo seasoning). I also double the onions just cuz I love them so much!

Not usually a fan of trip tip roast (too hard and chewy when cooked appropriately) but this was great! Cooking it this way does mean that you're getting it well done - like a pot roast - but it was fabulous!

I had a 3.5 pound roast and cooked it on low for 6 hours and it came out Medium Well. Hope this helps others adjust for their own doneness preference.

OMG- this is sooo good!!!! Didn't have the adobo seasoning so I used Tony Chachere's Creole Seasoning and lots of granulated garlic, put the potatoes, carrots and onion under the Tri Tip, doubled the liquid to 1 cup ( I use Better than Bouillon- Beef) and cooked it on high for 3 & 1/2 hours and added mushrooms about half an hour before it was done and it was so yummy!!! The Tri Tip I bought had a lot of fat on it so I trimmed it and sliced the roast in three sections so it would cook faster and get the yummy seasoning  throughout it.  The result was like heaven- so tender and juicy!
