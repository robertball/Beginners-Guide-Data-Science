This is a wonderful recipe.  Really easy.  I do add some potatoes.  We love the bisquick crust!

The filling was yummy and this was very easy to make but I thought that the topping was lacking something.  It did look exactly like the picture! :)  I would make this again but using a pie crust instead of the bisquick. I would add another can of cream of chicken also.

This was very easy to make and great to eat. I will make it a regular for left over turkey. I will add onion, garlic and pepper to increase the mix of flavors.

I made a variation of this last night for dinner. I used fresh veggies that I steamed for a few minutes first. Added a shake of italian seasoning for extra flavor. Also, didn't have any bisquick, so used a package of pre-made biscuits and topped the potpie and baked until the biscuits were done. One additional mention is that I added a 1/2 can of milk to the mixture so it wasn't so thick, but it baked up beautifully. (Side note: I had to go somewhere before it was done in the oven, my husband and 2 year old ate 2/3 of it and then my hubby took leftovers for lunch. He didn't let me have ANY of it!)

This is a very good base recipe and my 5 star rating was after a few changes were made.  I used 12 oz bag of mixed veggies (couldn't find 9 oz package).  In addition to the cream of chicken and milk (I used 98% fat free and skim milk) I added a can of cream of muchroom (also 98% fat free) so that the filling was creamier.  Also added 1/2 cup lightly sauteed chopped onions, garlic powder, pepper and Italian seasoning.  I used a deep dish pie pan and prepared the crust recipe as is.  I have to say that it was awesome and my husband loved it!  With the additions we actually had way more than 4 servings but the leftovers were wonderful.  Also, when it was finished baking it looked just like the picture.  Will definitley make this again and again.

this is good for an easy weeknight meal. I usually add potatoes and a little milk to make it a little saucier. I also personally prefer to use refrigerated pie crust rather than bisquick.

This was actually pretty good (yes, I really was surprised).  Grandkids were coming over and knowing their favority comes in a tin patty pan, I nixed my usual mix and tried this.  They loved it.  I was stunned with the ease of topping and will definately use that again - super super easy and I thought tasted fine - - - similar to the top part of a biscuit.  I did double filling and only used frozen peas along with some diced potatoes and carrots I had par-boiled earlier.  Baked in a 9" deep dish glass pie pan @ time/temp given.  Served along with a Ceasar salad and ended up with zero leftovers.  UPDATE:  I was in a rush to make this and failed to note I was out of eggs.  Went ahead and simply mixed the baking mix with the milk (added a palmful more mix)  and crossed my fingers .... worked wonderfully.  Not as puffy as original, but still light and crispy.

My picky eaters loved this!  It was super easy.  I did make a couple of changes because it is what I had on hand.  I used a large can of chicken and used frozen peas, carrots and broccoli.  Will definitely make this again!

This was OK..not great. My husband and I both said it could be much "creamier." Perhaps because we used low-fat cream of chicken soup???
It was super easy to put together and the crust was perfect (I guess I was expecting it to be more like a bisquick impossible pie). It was just like a potpie crust - nice!
We used about 2 cups of chicken -  and a mixed vegi mix of carrots, green beans and carrots. Very yummy.

I was looking for the cooking time/temp... I make the same basic pie except I use cream of mushroom soup and 2 ready made pie crusts.

Excellent base recipe that's super easy. I just added some dried minced onion, garlic and thyme to give it some extra flavor.

This was a great way to use turkey leftovers - I used about 2 cups of turkey.  I used ready made biscuit dough instead of the Bisquik - I cut up the biscuits and mixed them with a little seasoning and spread on top of the filling.  I also used the lower sodium cream of chicken soup.

Great base recipe but didn't really care for the bisquick topping - too soft and consensus in our home is that we like a crispy crust. Will definitely make again but omit the bisquick mix. I did pour filling into a frozen pie crust (baked for about 10 minutes first) and then poured bisquick mix. It turned out beautifully! Thanks for sharing your recipe. :)

In made this recipe but I cooked a clove of garlic with the chicken.It gave it a nice flavor.The garlic wasn't as noticeable the second day, but still an easy and comforting food for the winter.

Very yummy!!! I did a few changes... sauted some garlic+onion and added to the vegetable mix. Added grated cheese to the top of the pie. Turned out delicious and so quick and easy to make :)

This was really good and easy.  I had all the ingredients needed.  My husband ate 1/2 of it in one meal it was so good!  Next time I will season it up a bit more.
