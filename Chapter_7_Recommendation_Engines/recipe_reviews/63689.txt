Preparing this recipe as written is a waste of time.  Instead, cook the cauliflower for longer, and dry it between layers of paper towels.  Add a couple of wedges of laughing cow cheese (I like the garlic and herb kind), and some reduced fat parmesan.  Add salt and black pepper and use a hand mixer to get the potato-like texture.  The key is to make it taste good while still using South Beach-friendly ingredients.

My husband and I have been on the South Beach diet for about 7 months now. This recipe has become a staple in our home, although I don't quite make it this way. I boil the cauliflower until soft, drain it really well, and then mash it with a little bit of Smart Balance buttery spread, salt, and pepper. No, it doesn't have the same texture or even the same flavor of mashed potatoes, but it's still a very good and healthy alternative. 

You can melt a little bit of 2% cheddar cheese on top, or mix in a little sour cream and green onion for some variety. I've made brown gravy and put it over this - also very good.

I can honestly say I do not crave mashed white potatoes anymore. This recipe is good enough for me.

First of all, there is NO substitute for mashed potatoes!  The people who left bad reviews need to have lower expectations! This is a great recipe for people who are trying to take positive steps toward lifestyle changes in their diets!  A great creamy consistency that goes well with the dishes that you would normally serve potatoes with. Added cream cheese, galic and onion, garnished with chives and a little dollop of low fat sourcream.  Very tasty!

WOW! Fantastic. I have been on low carb for about 3 weeks now and it's been preet easy until today. I needed comfort food and I was starving. I bought cauliflower today and was looking for something besides just steaming it and adding alot of butter spray and salt. Lets face it, cauliflower is pretty bland. Anyway, I was already cooking it when I found this recipe. I hate measuring so I did what I always do and just threw the ingredients in the food processor and hoped for the best. Awesome!!
Of course I added some stuff. Instead of butter spray, which I usually use but is one reason I am doing low carb so I can eat BUTTER and CHEESE, helloooo, anyway I am rambling. I added 2 tbl. of butter and 2 oz of sharp cheddar. Also about 1 T. finely diced onion.  YUMMY. I wish I had more!

The trick to getting the texture right is to steam the cauliflower until it is tender, then let as much of the water drain off as possible. I ran mine through my potato ricer then used the mixer after I had the seasoning where I wanted it (2 wedges of Laughing Cow light, 3 roasted garlic cloves, a bit of fat free 1/2 and 1/2)- it was perfect!

My husband and I *love* potatoes in all its glorious forms, and giving them up so we could get healthier was hard. I love RAW cauliflower, but hated it cooked, until now. My husband hates it, raw or cooked. Well I have to say, we were both pleasantly surprised. I can't say it tasted "just like" mashers, but it was surprisingly similar, and it got my Beloved to eat a vegetable! It's definitely a recipe worth tinkering with- try adding different spices/cheese/whatever for different tastes. I was hesitant to make this in the food processor, as I expected it to turn to soup if I ran it long enough to get to the "whipped" stage, but it was fine. I'll try hand mashing next time, as we like lumps, but this was really good, and even our 3 year old son liked them. Worth a shot, and don't be discouraged if they're not perfect the first time- store brand frozen cauliflower is cheap! I'll definitely make this again!

I give it a 2 because of the modifications I had to make.  Ok, people this is a SIMPLE RECIPE!  I boiled the cauliflower(a whole head) until very soft and almost transparent.  To me-that is the trick: boiling it to death. (I'm sure I kill all the nutrients out of the veg. but it tastes so comforting that I really don't care!) I also added a large chicken bullion cube to the boiling water.  After I drained it well, I put it back into the pot and added 2 slices (or more-it's up to you) of DELUXE (it's real and creamier) american cheese, put the lid back on and let the cheese melt.  Then I blended it WELL with a hand mixer.  My family has been eating this as a substitute for mashed potatoes for years now.  We love it and hope you will too!!!

I really was surprised. The texture was much lighter and the taste was a little sweeter than real mash potatoes. The second time I made this recipe I added a little shredded cheddar which made it even better.

Can't believe that this actually tastes like mashed potatoes, but it did!  Yummy!  Definitely want to serve them hot though.. a little sour cream is nice as well!

Sorry, but the title should never have 'potatoes'  in it.....my husband and I tried this for the first night of our Phase 1.....the only positive thing I can say, is that it made me completely loose my appetite! (perhaps that is the point!)

I would rather just eat steamed califlower. I'll wait to eat this until I'm in the old folks home, thank you.

honestly, without having this side-by-side with mashed potatoes, it is quite satisfying. i added a bit of italian seasoning to mine [just as i do to regular mashed potatoes]. i'd also like to mention that if you are careful not to over-steam the cauliflower, and don't over-puree it, the consistency is a bit heavier, like potatoes.

I like any dish that doesn't leave me with "emotional baggage" after eating it. Just be sure to drain it really well so it doesn't come out too thin.

These do not taste exactly like mashed potatoes, but they sure help you get through those meals that cry out for mashed spuds.  You can doctor them up the same way you would mashed potatoes, with garlic, chicken broth, cheese, or bacon.  We find that they are best when you overcook the cauliflower.

I'm rating this a 4 star based on the directions on how to prepare. My cook book said to prepare the cauliflower in a micro - place the flowerets in a micro dish, add about 4 tbls. of water - cover - cook 4 min. on high - stir - cook another 4 mins. (made about six cups - of a whole med. size cauliflower).  It turned out fine. I put that in a blender, added 1 1/2 tbls. of butter pureed (we aren't on a diet), then added the half and half to desired consistency.  Added salt and pepper to taste.  We actually liked it - it does not have a strong cauliflower taste (we like cauliflower so that would not have been bad).  One whole cauliflower pureed does not make a lot.  There were only 2 of us and I think it would have only served 4 people.  I will try this again and play around with seasonings next time - I love cauliflower in Indian resturants - I may try adding cumin or curry, etc. the next time.  Also try adding some cheese to it like the first reviewer did.  It is certainly a different dish.

I was surprised that the mouth feel is just like mashed potatoes.  Eat them while they're hot, as they cool down you can detect the taste of cauliflower.  I like cauliflower, so that doesn't bother me.

I used a blender and no half and half and Earth Balance buttery spread with salt and pepper to taste. I'm just starting South Beach and I have to say this recipe will make it super easy to stick to!

I'm in Phase 1 of the South Beach Diet and I just made this for dinner. I loved it and found it really filling and delicious... not to mention how much vegetables you get in one serving! Some tips I find useful: when steaming, steam it on a stove top steamer - it keeps the cauliflower moist and soft, which helps it mash better. Also, some low fat cheese and low fat sour cream just helped to make it all the more creamy. I added a sauteed onion for more flavor. Don't mistake me, it's not mashed potatoes, but for people on South Beach this is a fantastic alternative. 
If you're on South Beach, keep up with it. If you're willing to cook, this is a great diet. I lost 20 pounds last year!

I wouldn't serve it to company...but after being on an Atkins/Southbeach diet for a week and watching my husband dig into his loaded baked potato, I was happy to have it.  I don't care for califlower but I thought this was a tasty way to eat it.  I used a pat of butter and a dollop of sour cream to mashed it.  Then It needs some spice, so I used garlic, onion, seasoned sea salt, and red pepper. Shockingly not bad!! I will definately make it for ME again while dieting.

This is a basic recipe that is easy to play with.  Cooking it in the microwave made it quick and easy.  I added some reduced fat cream cheese, sour cream, a little butter and garlic salt.  For convenience sake, made this about an hour before dinner, covered in a baking dish and slid it into the oven for about 15 minutes before serving.  Everyone liked this one.  Update (7/11/04): We still love this recipe, but now that we are in the maintenance phase, I add a large, boiled russet to this and throw it all in the blender.  It thickens it up a bit and makes it even more authentic.

I didn't follow the recipe much with this - but it gave me the idea so it deserves credit! I got some onion, garlic and chives fried in cooking spray, a tablespoon or so of quark (fat-free soft cheese) and a couple of laughing cow extra light triangles - and whizzed it in the blender with the steamed cauliflower and some salt and pepper. It tasted pretty awesome, but I didn't know what to serve it with (I'm a vegetarian) so I put it in some small oven-proof pots, topped with pasta sauce, low-fat mozzerella and some oregano and baked them. Turned out very good!

I read every single review before making this dish last night.  I was skeptical because I was expecting watery mush.  However, I was pleasantly surprised at the consistency, it really behaved and handled like mashed potatoes.  I am not a cauliflower lover except if it is raw and I have a hard time digesting it so I eat it sparingly.  I added a good spoonful of dried garlic and herbs, about 3 TBS of grated cheddar and I topped it off with a little bit of grated parmesan and baked it for about 15 minutes at 350.  The presentation looked really good.  My husband thought it was just delicious and wants me to make it again but I thought the first bite was weird as the texture in the mouth is not even close to the same as mashed potatoes.   You must be a real lover of cauliflower to enjoy this.  I give it marks for presentation and the fact that one of us loved it but I can't highly recommend this dish.  Sorry.

I am currently on the South Beach Diet. I tried this recipe and it was okay. Then I tried adding cream cheese and added a lil sprinkle of Mrs. Dash. The results?  WOW!! (For all you Phase one folks, the Cream cheese was an idea from the Atkins book).

This is a great alternative for mashed potatoes.  I agree with previous reviewers who said that there is no substitute for mashed potatoes!  However, if you're trying to make healthier, lighter choices this is a great recipe that tastes good.  Don't go into it with the expectation of making something that is exactly like mashed potatoes.  Try them with an open mind and no preconceived ideas about what they should taste like and you will probably like this dish.

I LOVE mashed potatoes and LOVED this recipe.  At times I forgot I was eating cauliflower.  I added a little more fat free half & half and used a pat of lite margarine vs the spray and it was wonderful.  I also steamed vs boiled and used a hand mixer to whip them up.  This definitely gave me the comfort food I'd been craving on Phase I and helped move me to the 2nd week.  This is a winner !!!

I found the first time I made it, it was a litlle bland. But then I added Mrs. Dash New Garlic "Salt Substitute" and it was outstanding. My family prefers it over mashed potatoes anytime. 

Be careful not to steam the cauliflour too long otherwise you will lose too much texture and it will look like pablum instead of Mashed potatoes!

Instead of the fatty add-ins, I add a very small, steamed red potato to the food processor before I puree the cauliflower. It gives it the thickness and flavor of real mashed potatoes without having to add any processed ingredients. I use Mann's 12 oz. bag of cauliflower with 2 oz. of potatoes, or 1 1 lb. bag of frozen cauliflower with 4 oz. of potatoes. Yum!

Very different side item. We added a teaspoon of garlic salt, creole seasoning, and parsley. The kids even ate it without complaints.

I think it's the artificial butter stuff that turns me off.  Would probably be better without that and just adding spices.

I couldn't believe how well this turned out.  I had it with the London Broil.  Nothing will take the place of mashed potatoes and gravy, but this is a neat alternative  I make it with real half and half now since it calls for such a small amount.

Honestly, this is a good stuff!! I sauteed some onions and garlic together in olive oil and dumped it into the mash. I didn't have half and half so I put in a wedge of laughing cow light cheese! Its delish! Granted the texture and the taste isn't like real mash, this comes close to a fine replacement!

I like to saute up some mushrooms, garlic and onions to mix into these--it really makes the recipe fantastic! Also try throwing in a tablespoon or two of gorgonzola or parmasean.

It's really amazing how good this recipe is.  I was very pleasantly surprised to find that pured cauliflower can actually substitute for mashed potatoes.  Of course, it's not quite the same, but for someone on a low carb diet, this is very satisfying.  I followed the recipe exactly (I steamed the cauliflower), but next time I'm going to try adding garlic and Laughing Cow cheese.  Very tasty.

These are great! I'm on a super strict (low-carb, well, low everything) diet so I omitted the butter and half-and-half and added fresh garlic. I wasn't sure how good they'd be with just mixing steamed cauliflower and seasonings but it was very satisfactory! A+ nature for one great substitute!

I made it like others suggested with bacon bits and whatever I would normally put in my mashed potatoes and still thought this wasnt great.  it had a grainy texture.  Won't be making this again.  I'd rather eat it plain and uncooked or dipped.

Looks like a "love-hate" recipe and put is in the hate category. Four of us on the South Beach diet in our household and we're liking most of what we try, but we can't find anything good to say about this menu. Texture is all wrong, flavor is off-putting. Try the spicy roasted cauliflower instead.  So much better!

This is a great alternative to mashed potatoes.  I did boil the Cauliflour in chicken broth and I also added a little parmesean cheese.  My husband LOVED them and so did I.  This is definately a keeper.

My daughter and I really liked these. I felt that it was a comfort food like mashed potatoes. I gave it three stars because I did make changes and my husband and sons didn't like it. I added some cheese and garlic powder and omitted the half & half.

I made this when I had nieces and nephews over.  They loved these special "potatoes."  They would have never eaten them if they knew the "potatoes" were really cauliflower!  Even my husband, who doesn't like cauliflower, said that he would eat this anytime.

They had the right texture, but they were a little bland.  I will try to make them again, but I think that I might add some garlic.  Also -plan on making more than you think that you will need.  If one head of cauliflower usually feeds your family, GET MORE...boy does they shrink when you mash 'em.

I don't like cauliflower, but I really liked this.  I couldn't find the fat-free half and half at my store, so I just used low fat milk.  It didn't taste exactly like mashed potatoes, but it was very good and a nice addition to a phase 1 meal.

If you like vegetables, this is really good.  I don't like plain cauliflower, but when you puree it and at the flavoring, this is excellent! This is WW friendly too - which makes it even better.  If you are expecting this to taste like potatoes, you won't get there.  Because it is healthy, I like it better than real potatoes.

My husband and I are on the South Beach Diet, so we made this exactly as the recipe directs. We loved it! The taste and consistency are so close to mashed potatoes that it definitely satisfies the craving. As another rater pointed out: if it cools, you can detect a cauliflower flavor. We like cauliflower too, so that was not a problem. We'll definitely make this again.

If you like cauliflower, I guess these would be ok.  However, they did not taste anything like mashed potatoes to me.  My husband and I ate them, but quickly washed them down with a drink.  Will not make these again.

Wow, I just made these but totally tweaked the recipe based on reviews, and I have to say it is amazing the way I made it!  I took one head of cauliflower, boiled it for about 20 minutes, drained it, and put it back in the pot.  I added 1/2 a block of fat free cream cheese and about 3 cloves of roasted garlic.  Mashed it up, then put it in the blender on the "puree" setting.  Then I added 1.5 T of smart balance butter spread, salt, and pepper.  It is DELICIOUS, and I'll definitely be making it again!

I made this out of a recommendation from my friend. It took me about 2 weeks to get around to it and I wish I didn't wait so long. I think it's delicious and a great low calorie side dish.

I first discovered this recipe in the South Beach diet book a couple years ago.  No, its not "exactly" like mashed potatoes, but its a delicious alternative.  Low in cals and carbs, and infinite ways to "tweak" this.  My 3 yr old even likes these.  My suggestion when using frozen, place in a covered microwave safe bowl, nuke for about 7-8 min.  Dont add any water, it makes a little bit of juice from the ice.  Then you can either mash with a tater masher or puree.  I like to add a little liquid margarine, and calorie countdown 2% milk.  This doesn't add many cals or carbs and gives a great consistency.

Not so good. I couldn't get the texture smoothed out, even when I cooked the cauliflower extra long.

I added 1/4 c. of reduced-fat cream cheese, scallions, bacon bits and reduced-fat cheddar cheese. Yummy.  Although, if you are not a fan of mashed potatoes, like my husband, then you're not going to enjoy this regardless of the delicious additions.

This was very good!  You can also add different spices to make it match your different meals.  I've used garlic, cajun spice, and more to flavor it.

For what it is (diet food- oh, wait, food forlife), this is really good.  Not quite the same as the original, but really good.  My favorite substitute on South Beach, is actually Spaghetti Squash for Spaghettin Noodles with whatever sauce you want.... This is a close second.

If I could rate this 0 stars I would. It turned out semi liquidy and the blandness of the cauliflower seemed to over power everything I put in it. I managed to eat my serving, but my husband gagged and tossed his out. We won't be making this again. There is no good substitute for good old mashed potatoes!

Mine didn't turn out too well.  It was kind of gritty.  Although, maybe if I cooked the califlour a little longer it would be better.

Just what I needed about 5 days into Phase 1.  I was craving something "carby" and it definitely tricked my brain into thinking it was potatoes.  My kids asked suspiciously "What kind of mashed potatoes are these?" a few times, but they still ate it all.  Very good!

I read the reviews and still didn't know what to expect, so tried this.  I like cauliflower, but this was simply a bland mushy version of it.  I even added Mrs. Dash.  I'll stick to the steamed version with light butter spray.

This recipe is really a very good idea. Fat-free half and half, however, is sweet and a mashed potato substitute ought to be savory. I just omit the half and half because cauliflower is less starchy and therefore thinner than potatoes so it doesn't really need thinning. It is fun to play with flavors and add garlic, herbs, or a little cheese to this dish, and it really does fill the potato void for me.

This was good. At the very least it's a more interesting way to eat cauliflower. I played with it a little and added a touch of fat free cream cheese and fresh garlic. Highly recommend having a food processor b/c using a mixer or blender takes a little while to achieve the smoother consistency. Overall a pretty good side to a steak or chicken breast.

I absolutley love mashed potatoes.  When I made this as written, I wanted to cry.  I thought they must be joking if they think this is supposed to replace the real thing!  But as others have said if you doctor up the seasonings, add some fat free cream cheese or sour cream, whatever...they do end up being really good! I have also found that making sure you let them really puree in the food processor makes them creamier too!  Just experiment!!

I do not like cauliflower, but I LOVED this recipe. Who would've thought?  Instead of fat-free half and half, I added less than one teaspoon of powdered Cremora. Rather than the cooking spray, I used Olivio (olive oil spread) and a little bit of Garlic powder, along with the salt and pepper. Absolutely amazing!

Yuck. I could barely choke these down. They have this weird sweet taste that in my opinion, is just WRONG. I would much rather eat the califlower steamed.

I am on a diet and it's not a low carb diet but rather smart carb, however, because I love cauliflower I decided to make this for lunch today. The dish looks like mashed spuds but tastes just like cauliflower. I skipped the butter spray and added a bit of parm on top and then broiled. I loved it!

It was pretty bland. The butter taste was super strong, it was like I was eating liquid butter. I ate it but I don't think I will be making this again. If I did, I would add a lot more seasonings to it.

I LOVE mashed potatoes so I tried this recipe. The SB Diet Cookbook says to place the cauliflower in a steamer basket in a large saucepan with 1/2 cup water, bring to boil over high heat, then reduce to medium, cover and cook for 4 minutes or until crisp-tender.  The first time made this, I followed these instructions and it came out like mashed potatoes but it needed more flavor.  The next time I oversteamed it so it came out mushy but I added a little roasted garlic and used Benecol margarine instead of butter spray.  It tasted a little better and disguised the cauliflower taste a little more.   I'll keeping making this until I get the right taste.

We all really liked these! I didn't have the butter spray so I just added a little "no trans-fat" spread. Also, I used a little no fat mily instead of the half and half. The first time I made this, they were REALLY runny. Next time I only added a pinch of milk and made sure to drain the cauliflower REALLY well!

(even my 2 year old ate this!)

This is a great recipe.  I added a little grated parmesan to the recipe and didn't tell my husband it wasn't mashed potatoes and he had no idea!  For a one dish meal, I've used them for Shepherd's Pie, with ground beef and veggies, a little cheddar sprinkled on top and it was totally yummy and still a great South Beach dish.

These are awful.  Trying to pass cauliflower off as a potato does not work.  With the amount of "fake" butter and salt you put in these, you might as well be eating real potatoes.

Okay, this is not going to be 100% like mashed potatoes but it's pretty darn close!  I guess the secret here is to dress it up with different seasonings and ingredients in order to mask the cauliflower flavor.  I tried mine with crisp fried bacon bits (and yes, a couple of drops of bacon fat in the mixture).  Only a strip of bacon will do magic.  Definitely the best thing in phase 1 so far !

I love this recipe.  It does take time to get just right - but once you do, it's great.  I took from my Mom the idea to put the mashed cauliflower in a casserole dish, cover the top with bread crumbs, and just bake enough to warm and crisp them.  Yummy!!

I used a whole head of cauliflower and steamed it till really mushy.  Added one ounce of butter spray and mashed with potatoe masher.  I like it lumpy not creamy.  Put a serving on my plate and stuck a piece of Lite Laughing Cow Cheese in it and mashed and mixed it in.  Delicious!

I don't have a food processor, so I couldn't get these as creamy as I would have liked, but the taste is VERY GOOD!  I will certainly use this recipe again!

Great! Just like Potat's, but keep an eye on how much milk you throw into the blender, cause our first attempt was really runny.

This recipe was okay.  I added minced garlic & fresh basil.  I mashed it with a potato masher because I don't like  my mashed potatoes that are too finely mashed.   This recipe was a little watery.....I did added grated Reggiano Parmesan cheese.  .... Definitely needed...

Made exactly as written, this recipe is gross.  My husband and children did not like it, and I was told to never try this again!  I'm sure with a few tweaks, and some "unhealty" add ins it wouldn't be too bad, but this was not a favorite at our house.

At first I wasn't sure what I was going to say about this dish, but after eating it, surprisingly, I liked it.  I added a sprinkle of garlic powder, and never confused it w/mashed potatoes-you're definitely  eating cauliflower! Give it a try, it's really pretty good!

Tasted similar to mashed potatoes for the first couple of bites. I'm not a big fan of cauliflower. I just could not get past the cauliflower texture and taste. It is a good recipe if you like cauliflower.

Surprisingly this is quite good.  I am a big fan of potatoes and I can deal with this.  I added a little more pepper than they suggested and sometimes I put a little garlic.

Okay....Cannot understand how all these people gave this such a high rating?  This is a horrible recipe.  If you want a good recipe for "make-believe" mashed potatoes, opt for celery root.  If you've never had it before, forget what it looks like when you buy it.  It is a wonderful addition to any gourmet meal.

As the recipe is written, I'd give it 4 stars, but tonight I used my turkey bacon allowance, cooked it, chopped it and added it to the cauliflower.  It was delicious!  My 4 yr old even asked for seconds.

I really liked this.  I put a little low-fat cheese over the top and it was quite a treat.  I also wasn't expecting it to taste like potatoes and love cauliflower.  I would have it again even if not on this diet!

This was okay. Nothing great, but maybe it depends on how much you are craving real mashed potatoes.  We prefer cauliflower the regular way.

If you don't like cauliflower, this is not the dish for you.  The consistency was a little gooey, which was strange.  They weren't horrible, but I don't think I'll be making them again.  I lik regular mashed potatoes far too much.

Ok, but not the best. I didn't like the smell of the cauliflower cooking, but once I added the butter, salt and pepper, it really helped. I ended up eating it all because I was hungry, but I probably won't be making this again. I think I will stick with raw veggies!

For someone doing the South Beach Diet who is REALLY missing potatoes this really hit the spot!  Unbelieveably like potoatoes.  I will admit I cheated a tad and put in a glob of that smart spread that the South Beach diet recommends rather than the butter spray.  But I did use the fat-free half and half.  They were YUMMY!  Will definitely be making them again.  Soon!
