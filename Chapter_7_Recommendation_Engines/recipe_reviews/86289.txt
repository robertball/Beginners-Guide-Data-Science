I used organic honey, super-chunk peanut butter and reduced-fat cream cheese. The kids thought this was GREAT. We had a "dippable" breakfast here--waffle sticks, apple slices, banana chunks and peach slices. They ate almost all of it.

I'm trying new recipes now to get ready for the upcoming holiday season and I think we'll be fitting this into the entertaining rotation.  We had this with graham crackers but apples would be fantastic!  Very easy and something a little different.

Very good- I took this to a party and served with apple slices, there was none left! Tasty but not overly sweet like some caramel dips. Did increase cinnamon to 1 tsp. as really like cinnamon.

Wonderful! Love the taste and texture. Sweet, creamy and the cinnamon gives it a nice twist.  I couldn't wait 24 hours, though! :)  Good stuff!

YUMMY!!  I did not add the cream cheese since I am allergic to dairy.  It was EXCELLENT!!  I dipped apple slices into it and...wow!  I think I have a new favorite sweet snack!  I was looking for something else to take to a Christmas get-together and now I found it!  Thank you so much for sharing this recipe!  Oh...and I couldn't wait the 24 hours....I barely waited 24 minutes!

This was good but it was too sweet for me I think maybe the peanut butter should be the more prominent taste

I thought this was too sweet for our tastes even with the cream cheese. And when I used less honey, it didn't set up thin and was sort of weird. But I'm positive this is perfect for most people. I'm going to keep playing with it as I think it has potential.

Delicious! I added a full block of cream cheese and a full teaspoon of cinnamon. Also great with celery sticks and pretzel sticks. Thanks!

This is really good!  However, I did make one change per other reviewers saying it was too sweet...  I only used 1/2 cup of honey and kept everything else the same.  Still plenty sweet, but good.  I put this on some homemade honey oat bread that I made :)
