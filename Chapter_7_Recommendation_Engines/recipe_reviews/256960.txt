I double the recipe to make a dozen, and occasionally have to add an extra egg if my eggs are a bit small. I also overlap two wonton wrappers in each cup to make them a bit bigger. Sometimes I also add a bit of chopped apple too!

I made this recipe for my family brunch and everyone loved it. I made it without sausage because I didnâ€™t have any but it turned out great anyway. I will keep this as a favourite.

Made as written and these were awesome! Even the cinnamon! The one thing I didn't care for was how brown the tops got. It made them a little hard (and sharp) to eat but these were still awesome!
