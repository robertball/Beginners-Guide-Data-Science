Me and my brother were bored. So we sighned up for this website. They were so easy to make. He had so much fun. I want to open a backery when I'm older and this is one I'll add to my list. They are just like everyone said. Plus this is the first recipe I tried first starting this website.

One of my favorite dessert recipes. I like to cook this in a pie plate and once it cools, I cut it into wedges and top it with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. This is also good with peanut butter chips.

AMAZING!!! I used 2 round cake pans so I could do half with white chocolate chips and half plain. Both ways are awesome! Tastes like a big peanut butter cookie....only better!

These are amazing. 

I did a few things differently out of convenience... I used 1/4 cup (generous 1/4 cup) canola oil and 1/4 cup butter rather than a 1/2 cup butter. I also used dark brown sugar rather than light, because that's all I had (I also used a bit less assuming that dark brown sugar may have a stronger taste?). I also used natural fresh peanut butter because it was cheaper! It is a also more moist and thin than regular creamy peanut butter. I also cooked the bars in a round glass pan becuase it didn't look like they would fill up a 9 x 13 very easily. I cooked them for 18 mintues to keep them on the softer side.

They were soooo good. I will definitely make this again! It was also so fast because you throw everything in one bowl and just mix it.

These were great. I made them without chocolate chips because I didn't have any on hand. They would have been even better with them. Instead a added a Peanut butter glaze from this site which worked out well. I love how cake like they were. I have made some before that end up being really dense, but these were very fluffy and moist. I will make these again and add the choc chips for sure.

These were a huge hit with my family.  As they were baking in the oven, the wonderful smell caused them to come into the kitchen to ask what I was making. 
I followed the recipe exactly and they turned out great.  I would only suggest a change to the instructions of the recipe.  As with any cookie or bar recipe, I would suggest creaming the butter, peanut butter and sugar first.  Then mix in the egg and vanilla.  Mix in the dry ingredients, then finally stir in the chocolate chips.  
SO easy and so delicious!

A one bowl recipe, very fast and easy to make & SO TASTY. So this recipe replaces my other peanut butter bar recipe and is now is my "Go-To" recipe for these bars.  HELPFUL HINTS:  When the recipe says to "fold chocolate chips into the batter" = STIR them in with a stiff spoon.  And, to "pour batter into prepared dish" = SPREAD the dough in the pan because the "batter" is more like cookie dough, not like cake batter.  And, I actually baked them for only 15 minutes.  Soft & Yummy! Thank you :)

I made these peanut butter bars last night for a coffee morning today. They were (notice I said were -- they went like hotcakes!)delicious and I received many compliments.  The recipe is so easy to make -- I just put the measured ingredients into a bowl all at once and then mixed (with my hand mixer) until they were well blended. (I was a little surprised that it called for a whole Tablespoon of vanilla, but since no reviewers commented about that, I used the called-for amount. It tasted fine, so the measurement must have been correct.) I also added about a cup of dark chocolate chips. Spread it in a 9x13" pan and baked (375F) for 20 mins.  The bars were golden on top, a little darker (but not dark) around the edges and when I cut them into squares, they were moist and held together. Yummy! They could not have been better.  Thank you for sharing your recipe.

The flavor of this was really good. I was concerned at first, because the dough had the consistency of cookies, but it came out good. I'm only giving it 3 stars, though, because after following the directions to a "T", and baking at the suggested amount, it was still doughy. After being in the oven for still another ten minutes, they were more firmer, though the bars that were in the middle still were a bit doughy and fell-apart. Other than that, a pretty good recipe, thanks! I think next time I'll make them in a bigger pan, making them thinner and possibly a little crispier.

These are quite tasty. At first I thought I'd gone wrong with the ingredients, because the directions say to pour the batter into the baking dish; When I see the word "pour" I think "liquid", and the batter is much too thick to pour! In spite of the thickness, it spreads easily and the bars turned out lighter and fluffier than I thought they would. I was expecting something more dense and chewy. The only changes I made was decreasing the sugar by almost 1/2c and baking for only 18 min. I think they turned out plenty sweet enough, especially using the chocolate chips, but could have used  a couple of minutes less of bake time.

Just as the title says, these are super easy to throw together, using ingredients that are probably found in most pantries at any given time.I used the food processor, creaming the wet ingredients until smooth, then pulsed in the dry ingredients, just to incorporate. Into the oven in 5 minutes flat! I baked them for 19 minutes total, and they were wonderfully chewy. Since I didn't have enough chocolate chips, I melted the few ounces I had, put it in a ziplock bag, snipping off a corner, and squeezing out squiggles over the top. Nice presentation, and enough chocolate that each bar had a touch, and no mess. Simple to make, homey, delicious goodness.

Great! Moist! Thick & chewy! Loved these! However, I did as others suggested put them in an 8x8 square glass pan and only baked them for 18 minutes to insure a moist bar.  They were lightly browned around the edges when I removed them from the oven. I also do not use refined sugar so I used sucanat and reduced the amount to 1 cup. My only complaint was that they were still too sweet even after reducing the sugar, so next time I will use only 3/4 c. sugar and hope that will perfect an already great cookie bar! Contrary to other reviews I did not find these at all cake-like.

Very good, everyone in the family likes them! I made it without the optional chocolate chips because some in the family can't sleep if they have chocolate too late, and it's still excellent.

I made these gluten free by replacing the flour with Bob's Red Mill *(ll purpose flour) and added 1 tsp of xanthan gum. They were absolutely delicious. My kids loved them. Thanks for sharing.

This was an easy, last minute recipe for a sweet craving. I followed the recipe as is- but I did follow another reviewers advice to cream together the sugar, peanut butter and butter before mixing in the dry ingredients which I think is a good rule to follow in general for cookie/bar recipes. This was a sweet and salty treat that was well received by others. The consistency straight out of the oven is a little disconcerting because it does look bread-like and will crumble if you attempt to serve it while warm. It sets as it cools to a denser, moist bar so I do recommend letting it cool before serving. It's texture is straight between a cake, cookie, and brownie and satisfies! I will make this again. :)

I made 2 triple batches in sheet cake pans at the homeless shelter today. I altered the method since it left a little to be desired. I creamed the peanut butter and butter together, added the sugar, eggs, vanilla, milk and baking soda, beat again, folded in the flour. I omitted the chocolate chips since we didn't have any, I also needed to add more milk as it was too dry. In the sheet cake pan it baked at 325 for 40 minutes, it started to burn at 375. I topped with boiled chocolate frosting. Enjoyed by the guests at the homeless shelter.

Wow! So easy! I used natural crunchy peanut butter and instead of butter I used equal parts apple sauce (cuts down the fat and calories dramatically). They turned out fabulous! Im so surprised by how fluffy and cake like they turned out, especially when the raw batter seemed so dense. They are perfect! I cut them into smaller squares and with the simple change of using applesauce instead of butter they came out to 2 ww points a piece! Mmm mmm good!

I have two very serious peanut butter/chocolate lovers in my house and this recipe got thumbs up from both!  I added a cup of semi-sweet chips before baking and then pushed mini peanut butter cups into the bars just out of the oven and WOW!  This one is a keeper.  Living the good life includes these bars!

Excellent and easy to make!  Used dark chocolate chunks (I didn't have chips) and came out delicious!  I used convection oven on 350 and was perfectly done in 15 minutes.

I followed the one review to put this in two 9" round cake pans, and made two giant cookies, basically.  With ice cream over it, everyone raved!

Delicious.  We didn't change anything in the recipe.  We will make it again.  Next time I might make them in mini muffin tin for a single serving bites.

Super recipe for when you need a lot of "great" cookies with minimal time and effort. Very easy to double the recipe, I can make 2 or 4 batches fast. At gatherings, people come up to me to say how much they love the cookie bars! Bars are clean and easy to handle too.

These were just okay.  Thought they were kind of greasy and could hardly taste the peanut butter.  Followed the recipe exactly.  Thank you for sharing your recipe.

I did not have chocolate chips.  I love that it did not have any added sugar.  It was quick, easy and delicious.  Definitely making this again.

This is a delicious recipe, however next time I will cut down the brown sugar by 1/2 a cup. I still give it 5 stars, because some of my family and co-workers liked it even with all the sweetness of the brown sugar.

These were easy and tasty. I baked for 20 minutes and the toothpick inserted in several places came out clean, but after cooling the consistency was like partially baked cookie dough. Which isn't necessarily bad, just something to know.

While these are delicious they are very crumbly and did not cook through.  I followed the recipe exactly but the difference may be that I used natural peanut butter.  I took them out after 22 minutes (checked at 20) and the toothpick was clean.  However, when I cut into them they were a strange combination of crumbly and under cooked.

These were quick and easy but the amount of vanilla gave them an off taste to me.  I think 1 tsp. would be better than a tablespoon.  At any rate, they didn't have enough peanut butter flavor and weren't quite sweet enough.  My search continues for the perfect peanut butter bar recipe.

This is a quick and easy recipe. I followed it exactly, but I baked the bars in the 12x12 baking pan that came with my toaster oven. The bars were crispy around the edges and soft in the middle. They are perfect with a glass of milk.

We really enjoyed this recipe, however I had to bake mine for 15 minutes longer and they still did not seem ready. I think it may be due to the fact that I used a glass baking dish. I am trying a metal one now to see if it bakes faster.

Yummy.  This was easy.  The bars came out more like cake than cookie.  I used less sugar as the reviews stated and I use 1/2 applesauce for the butter.

This is very easy to make and my friends and family really liked them. I thought they were slightly greasy. I’ll dabble with this recipe a few times to see if I can get them less greasy before I give up on it. Thank you for the recipe.

I think these are pretty good. I made 1/2 a batch followed the recipe ,  no substitutions  except used round pie plate as one review suggested. I also used parchment paper instead of greasing. to me they're kind of like a big soft cookie or reminds me of blonde brownies. the real test will be the grandkids LOL!

These were so yummy, it is best paired with a glass of milk. I didn't put as much salt as the recipe called for, I only put in 1/4 tsp and they turned out amazing. My family really enjoyed them! Will definitely make them again!!

These were very very sweet.  I made them with white chocolate chips.  Consistency  was moist and crumbly rather than chewy which I would have preferred  Don't give them to children before bed!

Absolutely outstanding! The peanut butter flavor isn't over-powering and the consistency is just perfect. Even without adding the butter, these came out great. For a twist, I added caramels (homemade) to a batch and dropped dollops of the dough around them and, voila, instant disappearing cookies. Maybe next time I will add mini marshmallows to the mix. Thanks for the great recipe!

EASY FAST SUTTLE. I really like these . I didn't at first, I thought they were plain. However, they have a spot on the Christmas square platter. They aren't really sweet. Also good with a cup of coffee.  Well worth a remake. I followed recipe but did cook 
an extra 10 minutes at least, and I think it needs it. I used parchment paper to bake and pizza cutter to slice when still just slightly warm.

I loved the ease of first dumping everything into the bowl of my stand mixer, then combining it.  My only caution:  I used the Allrecipes conversion to metric to weigh my ingredients (go into "servings"  and select 'metric')and the dough was way too wet to spread in the pan.  I had to flour my hands and likely added an extra quarter cup.  (this is because measuring flour by the cup varies widely from cook to cook).  I also baked this for 7 minutes less than directed.  Tastes yummy and cut easily while still hot on the pan (then set on rack to cool)

I didn't have enough smooth PB (I know, right?!) but the crunchy added great texture, too! Personal note: if making in Irish pie dish, cook twice as long.

I found that mixing the ingredients was an exercise in futility. The dough was too dry. The chocolate chips didn't want to mix in with the rest of the dough. I didn't want to add anything to the recipe since this was the first time I made it; but next time I would add additional moisture (milk, applesauce, water) to make the mixing easier. Once we pressed it into the pan and baked it, the taste was great, but some of the cookie would not hold together and crumbled. I will try again the next time our Granddaughter visits and make some changes to the recipe.

This is a scrumptious recipe, extremely easy to make and most ingredients are always on hand.  I made a couple, small changes:  I added 1/2 cup chopped, lightly salted dry roasted peanuts, reduced the amount of chocolate chips from 6 oz. to 3 oz. and reduced the brown sugar by 2 Tablespoons.  The "batter" is not what I'd call batter, but rather, an extremely thick dough that must be pressed into the pan to come together.  I made this on Feb. 16, 2016.  After cooling  I cut the bars into squares, then into triangles, placing each triangle in a large, white cupcake liner and served them on a plate lined with a paper doily.  A disappearing act.

This went over well when I made it for guests.  They liked that it was not too sweet.  I preferred it more after it had cooled instead of warm.

These taste really good but were a little more crumbly than I would've liked. Probably an extra egg would solve that. Super easy to make so will make again but will add the extra egg.

Deserves 5 stars.

This is a keeper .  My husband thinks he doesn't like peanut butter.  However, I have started making things with it in them and he raves about  the cookies/bars etc that I have made.  This is a case in point - he LOVED these.  Thanks for sharing the recipe Melinda.  I followed the recipe as submitted.

Made exactly as recipe calls for and they're amazing! I actually baked in a 9x9 pan though to make them the depth of a brownie (seemed like too little batter for a 9x13).

We loved these bars. I did however only use 1 teaspoon of vanilla instead of 1 tablespoon. I will definitely be making these again for my peanut butter loving husband.

I just made these right now and my goodness they are delicious ! Wow that is all I have to say, my brothers really loved them and so did I. Just make sure to have softened butter, I also baked these in a 8 inch square pan and added white chocolate chips to mine, but I'm sure they will taste great w/o chocolate chips. They are a little crispy on the outside yet soft and moist in the inside. Yum these are a must make again here you can sure taste that Peanut Butter. ;)Oh and make sure to keep an eye they get done really fast, or maybe its my oven ! He he

Awesome!  This is basically a big, super easy peanut butter cookie.  Perfection.  This is going to be my new go-to recipe.  I think next time I'll make it on a round pizza pan so it's even more like one big cookie!

Truly simply.  Hosting once a month parties and need quick and easy bar recipes.  I added 1 cup roasted salted peanuts (that I toasted in the oven) and 1 cup dark chocolate chips.  I think the 1 cup peanuts might have been a bit much.  Next time I'd do 1/2 a cup or 3/4 cup, but 1 cup chocolate chips was right on the money.  Moist and delicious!
