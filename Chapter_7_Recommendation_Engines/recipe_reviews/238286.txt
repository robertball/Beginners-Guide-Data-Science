While this recipe is tasty, the resulting cookies never firm up. After refrigerating them overnight, they were still unable to hold shape.

Love this recipe!  Worked out perfect for my little Easter treat! Easter Egg Nests!!  They were ready in less than 25 minutes.

These are delicious.  I've made them twice and the first batch set well in the freezer.  Second batch is sticky even after freezing.  Will try upping the coconut or oatmeal next batch and reducing the sugar.

Yum! My almost 3 year old and I decided to make these today and he got to pour and stir the ingredients. We added a handful of chocolate chips at the end when we were stirring everything together. They melted in nicely. The macaroons look delicious. 
Definitely making these again.

Made according to directions.  Did not set up and were not very flavorful. Will not make again.

wonderful piece of nostalgia!  I used real butter, and  about 1/2c more  coconut just because we all love coconut and as  result was able to cut back the sugar by 1/2c.  They turned out perfect and set up well.  so glad to have this recipe back, thanks

Delicious! My grandmother used to make these all the time while I was growing up, I've spent years trying to find a copycat recipe since she never had it written down! This will be my go to recipe from now on! Thank you.

Thank you for posting this! I remember making these in the kitchen with my mom when I was young. I make these every Christmas and everyone loves them. I add more coconut and sometimes a tablespoon more coco powder.

I added an extra 1/2 cup of oats and cut the sugar down to 1 cup.  They set up great and taste delicious!

Great recipe, delicious. Not too runny, formed up into a soft, formed cookie in about half an hour.

Delicious and easy.  They didn't last the night in my house.
