Divine!  Sublime!!  LOVED this soup!!!  No changes needed though perhaps a suggestion?  Use 6 cups of beef broth versus 5 and add only as much tortellini as you plan on eating at each serving.  The soup literally sopes up the broth, so if you have leftovers (which are even BETTER the next day) you have no broth as the tortellini has absorbed it!   Thanks to Mary P - my hat's off to you!!!!

WOW! Delicious! Everyone LOVED this soup and went back for seconds. I served it with the foccacia bread recipe from this site, YUM! Only thing I changed was used broth instead of water and added 1 cup of spinach.  To make it more practical I just used 3 cans beef broth which is a little over 5 cups.  2 medium sized carrots equals 1 cup and 1 medium sized zucchini equals 1.5 cups.  I used petite cut diced canned tomatoes, drained - about a can and a half was perfect! DO NOT add any salt to this soup - I used low-sodium broth and it was a tad too salty for me.  Thank you for this great recipe!

This is one of the best soups I have ever made!  Quick tip-to peel your tomatoes slice a criss-cross on the top of the tomato and drop it into boiling water for just a few seconds, drain them and put them immediately in an ice bath.  The skins will come right off, and then you can cut them in half and squeeze the seeds out.  This is a must make!

This soup is absolutely amazing! The first time I made it I used canned tomatoes instead of fresh and sweet Italian sausage... The second time I used hot sausage and took the time to peel/seed fresh tomatoes...it was worth it! The second soup was much better! I found the canned tomatoes to overpower the broth... and the hot sausage added a great kick! I want to make it over and over... serve with crusty bread and the rest of the bottle of wine ;)

ABSOLUTELY FABULOUS!! SERVE WITH CRUSTY BREAD AND BUTTER. CAN USE DRIED HERBS. DON'T ADD MORE SALT OR PEPPER AS IT IS SPICEY AS IS FOR MOST FOLKS.
I THICKENED IT A LITTLE WITH A TB. OF CORNSTARCH, BECAUSE WE LIKE OUR BROTH A LITTLE THICKER. ALSO USED 16 OZ. OF FROZEN TORTELLINI.

This is WONDERFUL. I have made this soup several times and it has turned out great every time. I have used both canned tomatos as well as seeding and peeling them myself. I don't think I noticed a distinct difference. Saves time to just used canned. This soup has great flavor - and is very filling. I have used it as the main course with some crusty bread!

I used 4 links of spicy italian sausage, used 2 cups of chicken broth for some of the beef becasue I had some in the fridge, omitted the water, used a shiraz for the wine & increased it a bit, used dry basil, used frozen squash slices for the zuchinni, added some frozen sugar snap peas (cut in half), used parmesan-filled tortellini & added additional liquids because I made some additions to the recipe. (talk about a run-on sentence...I can feel all you English teachers wincing! LOL) This made a huge pot so I pulled enough out to feed hubby & I & then added the tortellini to our portions. (I didn't want the tortellini to get sogged out if frozen in soup)...freezing the rest before the peas & squash were fully cooked. It should be good as new when thawed. Served it w/ some parmesan breadsticks, a glass of shiraz & a salad....thanks Mary P!

I thought this was just ok,  but Hubs particularly liked this as it is indicative of the rich, tomato-based, boldly flavored soups he's so fond of.  I loosely followed the recipe, but used fresh herbs and my own tomato sauce from my garden rather than the fresh tomatoes and canned tomato sauce. This is the sort of good old-fashioned soup that begs to be tinkered with, using whatever you have on hand so everything gets used and nothing goes to waste. So many vegetables would work with this and a a can of cannellini or ceci (garbanzo) beans would be nice too.  This is a little more "robust" than I personally tend to like, but after one spoonful just to taste (we're actually having this tomorrow) Hubs said, "Oh ye-aah.  This is just the way I like it."

Update: 6/11
I used wine (as the recipe calls for) for the first time. HUGE difference. The flavor is much more rounded. Don't pass on the vino!!
Family favorite! The only difference is I cook the tortellini seperately and once I serve it into bowls I pour the soup over the noodles. Then the noodles don"t sop up the broth or get mushy. I always cook a double batch and freeze some. Although my family fights over who gets the leftovers so sometimes it doesn't make it to the freezer. :).

Really liked this recipe.  I was afraid to add the wine because I don't cook with it usually but it would not have been as good without it.  My whole family loved. Thanks

One of my new favorite soups!  Even though I used diced canned tomatoes and dried herbs, I thought this soup was rich tasting.  I mixed mild and hot sausage together to add a little more heat to the broth.   I used a cheap red wine, and I don't think it made any difference in flavor.  I also subbed 1 can tomato soup for the sauce because that's what I had.  I used green beans instead of zucchini to save a trip to the store. Quick to put together and good enough for guests!  Add some crusty French or Italian bread, and you've got a delicious meal for a cold nights' dinner.  Thanks, Mary!

This was a good soup but it's not on my "favorites" list. I made this with hot italian sausage since that's what hubby likes. Mine turned out a little on the salty side, but I ran out of beef broth and had to add a little chicken stock...so that may have been why.  I didn't have the fresh tomatoes so I used canned (which I like) and used a 6 oz can of tomato paste since I was out of tomato sauce. My husband enjoyed this and asked me to hold on to the left-overs for him.  I like all of the ingredients that went into this soup, so I'm not sure why I didn't enjoy it more.  I've been eyeing this recipe for a long time..so I'm glad I gave it a shot.  Thanks Mary.

Hands down the best soup I've ever made!  Every time someone new tries it, they want the recipe.  I have used canned tomatoes instead of fresh and no one has been able to tell the difference.  It's my favorite allrecipes recipe!

Delicious Recipe! I threw everything plus some fresh mushrooms in a slowcooker for a couple or hours to really blend the flavors and put in the tortellini at the end. I also used 2 cans of diced Italian tomatoes. I couldn't imagine messing with the fresh tomatoes when the canned tasted just fine. I topped it wish some grated parm and fresh basil and served it with some ciabatta bread and it was DELICIOUS!!! It tasted so good I couldn't believe how easy it was!

Wonderful soup and a great way to get your veggies. I use Hot Italian sausage, 3 cans of beef broth, skip the wine and add 1 cup water. Also saute the onions and garlic in olive oil instead of the sausage grease. I don't use fresh basil or parsley, just the dehydrated flakes from the seasoning aisle. Have made with up to 19oz of cheese tortellini or half that if I want to save some. The tortellini instructions are sketchy, just cook them till they float. This soup is great! Served w/some Tuscan bread & dipping sauce (oil and herbs). It's also very filling. Thanks for a great recipe!

Delicious Soup! Everyone really enjoyed it! I doubled the recipe and used 2 tablespoons of minced garlic. I used roma tomatoes about 10 of them. I used both zucchini and yelloq sqaush. The basil leaves really add a lot of flavor to this soup. I recommend saving a few leaves till right before service because it will really emphasize the flavor more.

If I could give this 10 stars I would!  This soup is so good!  I am not usually a sausage fan, but I really enjoyed it in the soup.  I served it for a causal dinner party with rosemary bread and some salad and it got rave reviews.  I can't wait to make this again.  The only thing I changed was that there was'nt any zucchni at the grocery so I used red, yellow and green peppers and some spinach.  The color it added was great.  I also put some fresh basil on top to serve as I felt it lost flavor as it cooked in the soup.

This is so good it'll make ya' slap your granny!  WOW!!  I didn't have everything it called for to make this.  All I can say is, if it's this good without all the ingredients, it's gonna be a humdinger with them!  I didn't have any zucchini nor did I have any tortellini.  I used rotini pasta instead.  I don't like changing stuff the first time I make a recipe - otherwise what's the point in rating the recipe?  Don't think there's a thing about it that I will change once I get the tortellini and the zucchini.  Thanks Mary P!

Absolutely delicious just as written.  The first one to test it was my 3-yr-old grandson and he devoured it! I'm on my second bowl as we speak. I know this is going to be a regular addition to my menu.  Thank you so much for a great soup recipe.

Absolutely amazing! My boyfriend and I will be going to a family "soup-off" this morning and are bringing this soup. I'm so excited to wow the rest of my family members. We had it last night and I wish I made more!! 

We added spinach instead of zucchini and had spicy sausage instead of sweet (just personal preference). It made the house smell delicious and made our roommates quite jealous when I only let them have a spoonful. I'm very excited to keep playing with this recipe for years.

I left out the tomatoes and onion and added in a yellow pepper. I deglazed my pan with white wine and used a different pasta. (Had to work with what I had). Great soup! Would make again.

I decided to try something different for dinner last night and chose this recipe.  It was delicious!  My husband and I couldn't get enough.  The only thing I didn't have was zucchini (hubby was grateful. HA!)and the recipe was still fantastic.  The fresh herbs stand out and the addition of a little cheese is perfect.  I used 2 cheese tortellini pasta.  I will definitely be adding this to my dinner rotation.  Can't wait to have the leftovers for lunch. Thank you Mary P for a wonderful recipe.

Great soup recipe. Although I made several modifications. Instead of fresh basil I used 3 tablesppons of store-bought pesto. Instead if tortellini I used raviolini, plus I added a 5 oz bag of baby spinach and increased the garlic to 6 cloves.

This was super fantastic. Mine was a little salty but that was my own fault. My family cans fresh tomatoes every year so I used that. I forgot about the salt content combined with everything else. HOWEVER, had I not made that little mistake it would have been perfection. A great recipe. Loved it, loved it, and loved it some more. And to Josie, Review posted October 2003, who gave it three stars and changed some of the most important ingriedents.... you didn't like it because you screwed up the recipe.

This soup was very tasty.  I followed it very closely except I used spinach instead of zucchini, boxed tortellini instead of fresh, and dried herbs instead of fresh.  The flavors came together very well.  My only (minor) complaint is that there didn't seem to be much liquid left after the tortellini soaked it all up.  It may be worthwhile to use more of the liquid ingredients.

I'm just cooking this now and it smells really amazing.  The only other thing I added is a bit of fennel seed that I crushed up.  I've been putting that in a lot of Italian sauces lately.  It's probably already in the sausage but it gives it a nice aroma.  I wish I had put it in while sauteeing the sausage but I added it to the broth with everything else.  Update:  EVERYONE I've ever fed this to has LOVED it, including a good friend who is a professionally trained chef and wanted the recipe!

This was perfect. Made a double batch and served the neighborhood. Followed the recipe almost exactly, with the exception of using canned tomatoes rather than fresh. Delish!

FANTASTIC go-to recipe. Do not skip the fresh grated parmesan for garnish. Also, don't add the fresh basil until the end with the garnish.

This is always a hit in my house. I used canned diced tomatoes (drained) instead of chopping fresh tomatoes. Only add as much totellini as you will eat in one day. It gets soggy if left in the soup over night.

The best soup ever. My family love it and requests it all the time. I've been making this for a year. The only change I made was that my mother didn't like beef broth so we used chicken and I haven't made it with beef again. I honestly think this soup is amazing and it is very nice to have it every so often(a little to much work for me to make more often) I highly recommend trying this. It's very easy to change things that you don't like, like I did with the broth, and it still makes an amazing soup.

I made this soup for a dinner party the other night and the entire group raved about it. My husband, who normally considers soup as no more than a side, told me that this is the best meal I have ever made. I did add an extra 1/2 cup of broth and 1/2 cup of water to the soup as I prefer a little more broth.

Great recipe.  I have made it a few times.  No changes necessary at all.  However... once I had a green and red pepper in my fridge that was getting a little past its prime (I HATE wasting food) so I chopped them up... added it to the soup.  Again... excellent.  Thanks for sharing.

Oh my, this was sooo tasty.  And the other reviewers are right, it makes your entire house smell like an authentic Italian restaurant.  The only thing I did not care for was the tortellini. It's probably my fault cuz I bought frozen ones but I think next time I'll just use elbow or bow-tie, not cheese stuffed tortellini.  Otherwise this is a gourmet tasting meal.  Thanks!  **Updated review - made with a half-pound or so of elbow macaroni instead of tortellini - WOW!! Restaurant quality at home! 5+ stars now!**

SO YUMMERS!  Everyone loved it. I used canned tomatoes and it was still awesome. Also used 3 fresh italian sausages from my deli...so great. Will make again and again. Good tip on making pasta separate and then adding to each bowl. Makes leftovers better/easier :)

I added a 14.5oz can of diced tomatoes, used frozen tortellini, simmered for 30 minutes, put the soup in the fridge overnight and reheated the next day.  It was awesome.

There aren't enough stars to rate this soup. I use chunks of carrots and celery, lots of garlic and green onion. To avoid the fat issue I brown and drain Hot Italian sausage and then I use lots of paper towels and squeeze the fat out of the meat. I also use a slow cooker for 10-12 hours and add the tortellin 20 minutes before serving.

This is now my families favorite! The small amount of wine really adds a rich flavor to this hearty soup. I didn't have zuchinni but substituted fresh mushrooms. I also used two cans of stewed tomatoes in place of the fresh tomatoes. 

This is an easy recipe that freinds will beg for the recipe!

Wow. I read through this recipe a half a dozen times making sure I added all the ingredients correctly, and I did. To my dismay, this recipe was not good at all. I'm really surprised it got so many great reviews...what am I missing?

Delicious!  I used homemade beef broth and I did not have ANY tomatoes in my house (shocker!) so I used a can of diced tomatoes.  I also chose to use fresh oregano but use dried parsley cause we didn't have the fresh.  Very hearty and good soup!

4.5 star rating from my family of five.  I rounded up because one of the kids gave it a four just because she didn't like the sausage.  It was a very flavorful soup and a nice change during the week.  The fresh basil really took this to a new level.  I followed the recipe exactly.

Great recipe, very tasty!  I made this pretty much by the original recipe, but with the following changes;  Tomatoes aren't good this time of year so I used 2 cans of organic diced tomatoes.  The shopper in our family brought back frozen meat tortellini instead of fresh, so we used those and they turned out great.  The only other thing I did was after removing the casings from the sweet Italian sausage I cut them into bite size pieces and browned them in a saute pan.  I then took them out piece by piece and put them into a paper towel lined bowl to absorb the excess fat.  This worked really well and I didn't need to skim any fat off the soup because there wasn't any!  I served this with sourdough rolls and the crowd went wild!  Great recipe, and I thank the original poster.

Tasty soup. One suggestion...it's hard to "skim the fat off the top" as stated in the recipe.

Absolutely delicious.  I used a can of diced tomatoes instead of two wholefresh ones, and it is the best.  Thanks for sharing this.

This was so good!  Very tasty soup, and it gets better if you cook it for a long time; makes great leftovers, too.  I used part canned tomatoes, since I didn't have enough fresh, and I used homemade beef stock (which makes it even better).  I definitely recommend!

My family thought this was a fabulous soup. Very tasty and healthy ingredients overall. I always make the recipes exactly as they read the first time. I was very happy with it, but next time I will just try some plain shaped pasta because we really aren't into the cheese filled tortellini. Other than this future change, it was very delicious. Will be making it again!

I could only find Hot Italian sausage, and the recipe was still great!  The non-spicy lovers in my house weren't huge fans, but for those of us who liked the extra spicy kick, it was perfect!

Delish! I made a few minor changes though.. I used chicken broth vs beef, left out the wine (only because I did not have any on hand at the time!), and chopped my carrots vs slicing them.  I added additional fresh chopped basil too, and a touch of salt and pepper.  :)

This is a wonderful soup!!! I have been making it for years. I also have modified it many a times. The broth is very versatile and can easily be made with beef and also accepts surplus veggies from the garden. I have also used canned diced tomatoes in place of the fresh ones. The original recipe I have calls for a chopped green bell pepper, too.

I made this yesterday when the heat index in MD was 124 degrees.  Not normally the weather you would be thinking  about soup but I had an abundance of zucchini and tomatoes from my garden. 
 I didn't have red wine so I just added a full cup of water.  My husband loved it served with a garden salad with homemade blue cheese dressing and garlic bread.  Will make again!

This soup dish is a keeper, my family loves it.  Very flavorable, and hearty. For the sausage I use Bob Evans italian, I fry the onion w/the sausage, you don't have grease to drain, what is left behind is enough to add more flavor to the soup, then add the rest of the ingredients.  I serve mine w/a good bread...YUM

I made this in the slow cooker so that I could come home to it tonight.  OMG, it was wonderful.  The kitchen smelled great, and the soup was delicious.  I used a goat cheese and sun-dried tomato ravioli in lieu of tortellini.  The thing I like about this is that you can play around with different tortellini flavors and different sausage flavors.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This was restaurant-quality.  I followed the recipe exactly as written and we loved it.  In the future I might try with fresh spinach and/or cannellini beans, NOT that it needs and sprucing-up.

Very good.  I used turkey sausage to make it healthier.  I found that not much sausage was needed to infuse the flavor throughout the soup.

This soup was amazing! Instead of the tomatoes I used 1 can of petite diced I did not use tomato sauce instead I added 1 small can of V-8 juice (I use V-8 in most of my soups). I will definetly be making this soup again.

So great! The only change I made was the use of canned, diced tomatoes that were seasoned with basil, garlic and oregano as opposed to fresh tomatoes. The end result was delicious. An A+ recipe!

Absolutely wonderful. Everyone loved it. Pretty easy to make too! I questioned how well the carrots would fit in the flavor scheme but followed the recipe and they worked really well and were nice and soft. Threw some spinach in in the last few minutes too. Definitely making again!

Brought this to a pot luck dinner...EVERYONE loved it.  I had to omit the tortellini...too expensive for me, but I used rigatoni pasta, which went over quite well.  I also accidentally grabbed a package of hald spicy, half sweet sausage....that went over well too!  Hubby demands we make this one again for lunches!

This soup was great. It was a hit even with my sceptical husband. I followed the recipe  pretty much but used Italian chicken sausage and Garlic chicken sausage because that is what I had on hand. I also used  fat free Chicken broth. Great recipe and will make again.

HOLY COW! This was the best soup I have EVER made! Made it at home and again for a family get together and EVERYONE gobbled it up! So amazing! I did use can tomatoes with basil instead of fresh tomatoes.  I didn't drain them so I omitted the water. AWESOME recipe and now one of my favorite!!!

great! i made some changes based on what i had, but i think it would be delicious exactly as written as well. i omitted the water and used extra broth and wine instead for more flavor, and i used two cans of tomato sauce instead of one and the four tomatoes. i also left out the carrots and zucchini (i didn't have any), added about 2 tbsp of heavy cream for a slightly more substantial broth, and added about 1/2 c parmesan cheese while it was cooking. for a more substantial soup, double the tortellini but only add an extra 1/2 of the amount of everything else in the recipe.

After making this multiple times, I really do feel that what makes this soup is the type of wine used.  I tried different kinds, but it truly comes down to the old adage "Cook with wine you would normally drink".  My last attempt I used a Merlot I prefer, and it was by far the best batch I had tried.  I love this soup!  Thank you for sharing the recipe!

This recipe was terrific! Both my husband and I loved it and the leftovers were gone in a day or two. I am not a big sausage fan, but this is definately a keeper. I look forward to making it again! ...Only gave it 4 stars for kid friendly, because we dont have any childern to test it out on ;)

Absolutely delicious.  Our new favorite soup.  I used canned diced tomatoes instead of fresh ones and scallions instead of onions.  Try garlic and cheese sausage or turkey sausage. Yummmmmmmm....

This soup was amazing, as other reviewers suggested I cooked the tortellini separate. I was using a brand of tortellini I had never tried before (because I usually buy the frozen kind and the recipe said not to) which I did not really care for. When I had some leftovers the next day I threw in some white rice I had on hand instead of the funky tasting tortellini and it was fantastic! I will definitely make again, using rice because it is much cheaper and better than I can imagine tortellini (even some that I really liked) tasting -- I will also be dubbing this "Italian Gumbo".

Awesome recipe, thank you!
Small changes to adapt to what was on hand:
I used a large can of whole tomatoes and cut into small pieces instead of fresh tomatoes. I used liquid from the can instead of water, and I used 1/2 tsp of dried basil instead of fresh, and added dried parsley at the same time too. I added extra carrots and zucchini too. Awesome recipe!! Quickly a family favorite!

WOW!  This was by far the best soup I ever tasted!  I am eating bites inbetween typing this review...  I made it almost exact except that I did use a large can of diced petite cut tomatoes, and I added a whole container of beef broth (think it was almost 6 cups).  I made the soup last night for tonight's dinner and took others advice by waiting to add the tortellini in as needed.  Fabulous, thanks so much for this recipe it will be made again for sure and soon!

This was delicious, simple and fairly inexpensive.  The only change I made was I didn't add onions because the hubby hates them.  I used canned whole, peeled tomatoes instead of fresh because the fresh ones didn't look too good.  I used 1 box plus 1 can of beef broth (equal to about 6 cups).  DELICIOUS!!  This will definitely become part of my winter dinner rotation.  My hubby, who usually isn't fond of soups, had two bowls and kept asking me "what's in this?".  Yay!

amazing!  easy, and delish.  Just be sure to skim the fat off adding zucchini and parsley like the originial recipe calls for, or it is a bit too greasy.  I made this recipe EXACTLY as it is written and it was great!!!!

Wow is one word to sum up  the delicious-ness of this soup! Like other reviewers next time I will add at LEAST one more cup of broth, even 2 more 2 cups with another 1/4 cup of wine (i really love to cook with the wine literally called "red") the wine really brings out a bolder flavor. I also used fresh oregano instead of dried (i snipped leaves off of 2 twigs) I also added butternut squash, And i also used more broth instead of water and no additional salt needed. Everything else was the same.  But raves ALL around, my baby girl couldn't stop saying mmmmmm ! (neither could anyone else)

Used most of the listed ingredients, subbing others for what I did not have on hand.  What a great basic recipe for us!  Did not use the red wine and made my beef broth from scratch.  Definitely worth making many times and ingredients can be adjusted for what is on hand.

I always make this the night before and let it sit in the refrigerator over night.  Then, I put it in the crock pot all day. The spices are perfect this way.  I serve it with cheese croutons instead of bread.  They soak in the broth and add some great flavor!

use low sodium beef stock, almost double the wine and a large can of stewed tomatoes works just as well as the fresh.

Oh my gosh this is delicious and I did not have the red wine or "fresh basil' I used my dried basil. I added more tortellini only because I like a heartier soup but a wonderful recipe. YUM! Don't waste you time at Olive garden this has more Italian flavor than their soups.

EXCELLENT! Worth the effort. I followed other reviews and did not use canned tomatoes (even though that would've been easier) - I'm sure that did make a big difference in the flavor. Be careful on the broth - next time I'll use low sodium. We like salt and it was almost too salty with regular beef broth - glad I didn't add additional salt. This will be a repeat soup/meal at our house. Try it - you won't be sorry.

I like thicker soups, so was glad to find this one with tomato sauce. Instead of the tomatoes, I used two 14.5 oz cans of petite diced tomatoes.  Next time I will omit the water & just not drain the tomatoes.  I used a whole 19 oz bag of frozen tortellini.  My husband was skeptical when he saw just soup for dinner, but then admitted it was extremely good.  Served garlic bread with it.

Oh my goodness! So amazing! My boyfriend asks for this so often. I've made it for my friends and family a few times and everyone loves it. I boil the tortellini separately and add it to the bowls before I add the soup. This way when there are leftovers the tortellini doesn't absorb all of the sauce. Also, I usually use chicken broth instead of beef. Thank you for a great recipe!

Great Flavor!  I read many reviews before I attempted to make this for the first time.  I figured from the reviews that I couldn't go wrong.  I followed the recipe very closely with just a couple changes.  First, I used half fresh tomatos, and half diced from a can.  I also used 3 cups of beef broth and 2 of chicken broth to make it less beefy.  I couldn't find sweet sausage, so I used half mild and half hot sausage (being married to a mexican, a little kick always helps:).  The last thing I did different is use 3 cheese tortellini, because we love cheese!  This really is a tasty soup, Like button:)

I used a box of bowtie pasta instead of tortellini because I felt the cheese didn't add to the flavors. I also added a bag of premade frozen meatballs (in addition to the sausage) that really made this an over the top hit with my family. This recipe was very easy to make a quadruple batch of so I have some in my freezer for the upcoming busy fall nights!

My family and I thought this was lacking something and too salty.  We didn't have fresh basil or parsley, so I used dried. Despite that, I think the real problem was using beef broth and the fat from the sausage, despite my cooking and draining it well.  Maybe with a leaner turkey sausage and either chicken broth or a combo of beef broth and tomato juice would be more to our liking.

This was the first soup I've made in a long time and it was great.  Though the original recipe doesn't call for it, I saw a container of baby portobello slices while shopping and thought I'd add it, I highly recommend it if you like mushrooms!  I put them in early when I was browning the sausage (mild italian, couldn't find sweet) then set both aside to add back later.  I used Rolling Stones 40 Licks Merlot from Wines that rock (I really like their wines and they add nice flavors when cooking).  I wasn't able to find tortellini but the bowtie I used worked fine.  I definitely liked this soup and everyone else did to, even a family friend who's 4 which was unexpected.  I'd like to make this again and add cannellini beans, but it's perfect as it is.

This was very good.  Made it as stated.  I also added about 3/4 cup frozen peas when adding the zucchini. My whole family liked it.

fantastic! Family loved it.  used canned tomatoes instead of fresh since they are out of season and expensive.  also used little more sweet italian sausage than called for.  wouldn't change anything else.  Definately a redo!

This soup is so colorful and so good. I used reduced sodium beef broth and no-salt canned tomatoes; I would recommend using as many reduced sodium ingredients as possible in this recipe as it definitely leans to the salty side.  My zucchini was too old, so I used 1/2 cup of frozen spinach in its place which worked well.  Since others remarked that the tortellini absorbed a lot of the soup liquid, I just kept them separate and added them into the bowl as I served the soup.  Next time, I would add more basil & oregano.

This was better than I imagined, even after reading rave reviews. Definately add 1 or 2 more cups beef broth! Use fresh tomatoes...it is worth it! I just cut an X into each tomato and dropped them whole into my boiling broth. Took them out after a few minutes and the peel slipped right off. No need to seed them. I used large romas. Fresh basil is also a must! I used red cooking wine and DO NOT ADD SALT before tasting!

Really good - I used hot Italian sausage but will probably use sweet next time.  Another option is to use pre-diced tomatoes out of a can to expedite the recipe.

Awesome, zesty soup.  I finished my batch by pouring the soup into individual casseroles, topping each dish with mozarella, and broiling it until it was slightly browned and gooey.  YUM!  THanks for the great recipe!

So great!  I used Italian sausage with Basil, 1 can of italian style dice tomatoes in place of seeded and chopped tomatoes, also added italian seasoning.  It was a little too salty for us, so next time I will cut the broth in half and replace the other half with water and will also use low sodium.

Great soup recipe!  I used a combination of beef broth, beef consumme and a little chicken broth.  Mostly the beef broth.  Taste is excellent, easy and quick.  I will make this again, Thanks!!!

WOW! this recipe is probably the best soup recipe I've made yet! It's a nice recipe to have simmering all day. Keep the rest of the bottle of wine handy to sip while you're cooking...and make sure you have plenty of crispy bread and cheese to go with it!

This soup was delicious!  Every year we have soup for my mother-in-laws birthday.  This was the last soup to arrive, but the first one to go.  I used one can of diced tomato instead of fresh ones and it turned out fine and cut out some of the work.  A favorite for sure!

Excellent recipe.  Ignore the nay-sayers.  This dish has everything and is very good.  We added it to our regular menu and the guests are eating it up. The SHREDDED (not grated) parmesan cheese on the final product (which is not listed but in the video) is a must and the crusty bread just makes it better. 5 thumbs up!  Freezes well too. Use sweet Italian sausage.  Not Hot or Spicy.

YUM! Didn't change anything. I actually didn't peel the tomatoes, just seeded them and it was fine. I used Merlot wine. This was SO good. I agree with the reviewer who said to add 6 cups of broth instead of 5 as the tortellini soaked up much of the yummy broth. Definitely serve with crusty bread!! Will make again.

Ohhh yeah, even the kids like it. This is a winter staple for us since last year. The only thing I do different is simmer just a tad more. I tend to like my soups a little more thick.

This is the best soup I've ever made.  Husband and friends went crazy over it!!  I did not have fresh tomatoes on hand so I used the flavored and diced canned (3 different kinds).  The only thing I was sorry about is that I should of made more!

Loved it!  Even hubby loved it and he's not a soup guy.  Followed other reviewers suggestions and used 6 cups of broth - 4 beef (low sodium) and 2 chicken. It definitely needs the extra liquid.  Used two cans of undrained diced tomatoes instead of fresh, purely for convenience's sake (omitted the extra water but next time probably won't).  Otherwise followed the recipe as is and served with crunchy bread and a bit of parmesan cheese.  Already ladled out hubby's lunch for tomorrow and looking forward to mine too as there's loads left!

this soup is out of this world. I did leave out the zucchini,as the boys don't care for them and added
fresh green beans instead. The next time I make this, I'm going to add even more veggies.

WOW!!  What a great recipe!  Tasted like something you would get at a restaurant!   I too used diced tomatoes.. 2 cans. And used 2 cans of beef broth and half a can full of chicken broth as that was all i had.  I chopped up my zucchini.  I also hand full of baby spinach right at the end.  I used all dried herbs bc I don't have any fresh.  Fantastic!  Will make again!!

DELICIOUS!!!!

Spectacular Recipe!  I took others advise and increased the broth to 8 cups and cooked the pasta before adding it to the soup.  I also substituted canned chopped tomatoes for the fresh tomatoes and I added a little fresh spinach. Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly as written and its perfect! I have made it TWICE in a month and its gone before I know it.  Thanks so much for sharing this recipe!

Wonderful wintertime or holiday soup! I add 1 box + 1 can beef broth and whole pkg of tortellini. Pairs well with Jamie's cranberry spinach salad, and crust bread!

Made this the night before a carry-in at work. Excellent! I used 2 cans of petite diced tomatoes. I was worried about the salt content and quantity of broth, based on other reviews.  I used one 32 oz carton of Kitchen Basic NO SALT beef broth and 8 oz of another carton regular salted beef broth. I ended up adding the remaining 24oz, because it really did absorb quite a bit of liquid overnight. Between the two cartons, did not feel it was too salty at all. Yummy.

I used turkey sausage to save about 1/2 the fat and it was still delish and even my grumpy husband (due to work) admitted that he really liked it!  I thought peeling and seeding the tomatoes was a total pain so I will be using canned next time.  Flavor is really perfect, no additional seasoning necessary!

My whole family LOVED this!!  Although it was a bit labor instensive, we will definitely make this again.  How often do you here "This is the best meal you've ever made."  My husband had 4 helpings until he felt like exploding.  I used canned tomatoes instead and it made it a bit easier to prepare.

Delicious! Added 6 cups of broth as another reviewer recommended; however, it seemed to overpower the soup so next time I will stick with 5 as the recipe is written. Great combination of flavors, this is a more filling soup and is great served with bread and/or salad.

I get to continue the 5 star ratings!  Very good!  I used petite diced tomatoes (one can, use more next time), high quality beef broth.  I had to used dried basil but I really enjoyed it.  Next time we will be trying a spicy sausage!

Tasty & very good fresh. I felt that the soup lost some of it's "oomph" & flavor when refrigerated overnight though - so in my mind it's a "serve fresh" soup.  If I make again I will try to crumble the sausage more. Tortellini are a nice touch.  Wine is an important ingredient.

Another 5 star rating here!  I've always made a more traditional minestrone soup but I think I like this even better!  I questioned using beef broth instead of chicken but went with it since I always like to try (and review) recipes as written.  I'm glad I did - it made the soup rich and hearty.  I did have to make a couple minor changes simply because I was making this from what I had on hand... I didn't have tomato sauce so I used a big tablespoonful of tomato paste (had one open I needed to use); I also didn't have zucchini so I used some peeled diced delicata squash that I had; I also threw in some chopped fresh kale and spinach to add some greens.  Otherwise as-written.  Fantastic and the family loved it.  Will definitely make again (and again and again!).  Thanks!

This is a fantasic hearty soup!! It sort of reminded me of a minestrone soup. I doubled the recipe to make sure I had enough for a family get-together. Made a few changes...I used fresh made hot italian sausage, in lieu of all beef broth I used 1/3 beef broth, 1/3 my homemade saltfree chicken stock, and 1/3 my homemade saltfree tomato juice (obviously I watch the salt intake!), omitted the zuchinni, added 1 c. pipette pasta, added 1 can pinto beans & 1 can of red beans (rinsed both before adding). Don't be afraid to add more water, broth, or tomato juice because the pasta definitely uses it up. I think the next time I make this I will add some chopped swiss chard or some of those flat italian green beans cut in 1" pieces. I served it with a crusty italian bread. This soup was definitely a hit! Easy to make and easy to tweek!

Yum! I skipped the zucchini because I didn't have any on hand and I subbed cilantro for parsley because I am madly in love with cilantro (and therefore, so is my garden). I also used a whole diced onion, which was closer to 2 cups. (Big thank you to the reviewer Nikki who translated cups into quantities of veggies!) Everybody raved except my 9-year-old, so I think when I make this again it'll be on a grown-ups night, and I'll use hot Italian sausage and some maybe some black or red pepper. I accidentally put in one can of beef broth plus a carton of low-sodium chicken broth. I know it doesn't make a huge difference, but I was irritated with myself (I literally just grabbed the wrong carton from the pantry!), so I "noticed." Again, everybody raved, and I see other reviewers used chicken broth on purpose (not just because they were on the phone with their mother and not paying attention...), but I will definitely use beef next time because I think that little extra richness and saltiness would have made it EVEN better! Thanks for the recipe!

This was delicious and hearty.  My only change I made was that I added more beef stock (and some chicken stock) to make it more soup-like.  I also used Turkey Italian sausage to make it more healthy.

Delicious!  I followed the recipe as much as my pantry would allow...used two hot links and three sweet as other reviewers have suggested.  Didn't have fresh tomatoes so used diced canned.  Don't care for tortellini so left it out.  Added frozen spinach and carrots (since they were frozen, omitted the water).   Delicious!!! This one is definitely a keeper!

This soup is 10 STARS for flavor for sure! I used homemade beef stock with 1/2 qt. home canned tomatoes with the juice in place of the 4 lg. tomatoes (what I had on hand) and I did not add water or red wine. I added substancially more carrots, a 16 oz. bag of tortellini and 1 1/2 lb. sausage. I had frozen basil in the freezer in ice cube trays from my garden so I threw in one large cube of basil instead of 1/2 Tbps. fresh. This soup was outstanding! And both my sons and my husband said that it was their favorite soup ever! I will be making this often. It was also VERY EASY to through together.

Loved this! My husband (who is slightly picky) said this was one of the best soups I have made.

I used canned, diced tomatoes & dried spices and it tasted great. I went for the Italian Sausage because my husband likes a little spice....and he loved that! 

Definitely going to make this again in the future!

This was the first time I ever attempted to make a soup. I'm a young cook and wanted to try this out since its starting to get cooler out. I'm so happy I did. This was beyond my expectations! My husband had 3 bowls!!! I thought about not using the red wine, but i'm glad I made the extra trip out to the store for it. Definitely changed the soup completely for the best. Thank you Mary P for this amazing recipe!!!

I made this exactly as per the recipe - only thing different is that I did not have the fresh herbs I had to used dried.

It tastes wonderful!  This is the best soup I have made yet

Yummy! My dinner club of 27 years loved it and they all wanted the recipe.  Love all the extra ideas too.  I made it the night before and skimmed off the fat when I reheated it. Added the tortellini 10 minutes before serving.  Thanks.

I made this soup for the third time last night, and as always it was amazing!  I used two cans of diced tomatoes (undrained, as I didn't have any tomato sauce) and added a box of chopped frozen spinach with the tortellini.  Leftovers are even better...thank you so much for this recipe Mary P!!!

The only slight change I made was using dried basil and tortellini because fresh ingredients are not available at my grocery.  The soup was fantastic!! One of the best I have ever made, and I am somewhat of a soup addict.  I also loved that your recipe was very accurate; the cooking times and measurements are very realistic.

Yum!  I've made this soup several times and have not been disappointed.  I use hot Italian sausage for more of a "kick" and also "rainbow" tortellini to add some color.  Canned diced tomatoes work well too if you don't feel like peeling, seeding and chopping.

Soup was tasty, opted to leave out zucchini and didn't have a dry red wine. Used four cloves of garlic, 16oz of tortellini, 1.5lbs of sausage. Used mild and spicy sausage, which made the soup spicy, perfect on a cold day--sweaty on a warm day. Next time, I'll try with sweet sausage. Instead of using fresh tomatoes, used a large 28oz can of crushed tomatoes, just didn't have time to prep the fresh ones. Though I'd love to try it some day. Added equal part beef broth instead of the wine since I didn't have it. Next time I'll also add more stock, maybe one or two more cups, the tortellini absorbs a good amount. Served with very delicious Garlic Bread.

Used steam bag of corn/beans, frozen cheese tortelini, 2 sausage links. Used can of chopped tomatoes, but needs more spice. Maybe curry?

Excellent dish! I didn't have any of the fresh herbs on hand, but compensated by just adding more of the dried stuff. I also didn't have any fresh tomatoes "they're pretty expensive right now", so i just used some canned ones instead.  Great soup for a cold night--serve with some crusty bread and enjoy!

I made this soup as is the first time and it was fantastic!  However I prefer even a heartier soup so the second time I made it I made it a little differently based on that and what I had on hand.  I used turkey kielbasa in place of sausage. I chopped 4 carrots, 3 stalks of celery and two onions.  I didnt have any zucchini so kept that out.  I used 1 can of petite diced tomatoes instead of fresh.  Used a splash more wine (cabernet sauvignon) than called for and then I also added some thyme, cayenne pepper and 2 bay leaves to the pot.  OMG!!! the depth of flavors and the richness of the broth!  Oh and I also used a 16oz package of frozen tortellini that I thawed and added!  Will be making this again and again!

One of my favorite soup recipes.  I generally make it in the winter and use canned tomatoes since tomatoes aren't as good in the winter.  I top the soup with parmesan cheese.  Yum!

I made this recently for my mother and grandmother(who are excellent cooks--talk about pressure!).  It really was excellent.  I was so proud(and relieved!).  I didn't even use fresh basil or parsley or garlic!  I used dried for the basil and parsley, and jarred minced garlic, because that is what I had on hand.  I also simply used canned tomatoes. (Sorry...I have three small kids...I have to cut corners where I can!) It may taste better following the recipe exactly; but, we didn't miss a thing!  It was delicious!  Oh....I also used ground Italian sausage(Johnsonville, I think), instead of links.  That way I didn't have to touch the meat to remove casings!  I don't think you can wrong.  I'm gonna make it tonight!

I made this for dinner last night, but my family didn't enjoy it.  The broth is a beautiful color and there is a lot of flavor - but that flavor is all sausage.  The taste of the sausage permeated and overwelmed every other flavor in the soup.  We like italian sausage, but this was too much for us.  I could see how this would be a good recipe for those who LOVE the taste of italian sausage.  For us it was too much.

This soup was a great way to use up things I had in the kitchen. I made a few changes based on what I had on hand- I omitted the zucchini and added chopped green peppers and celery. I did not have fresh herbs so I used Italian Seasoning. I used fresh tortellini that had been frozen. Also, I browned the sausage in a pan and cooked the onions, garlic and peppers for a few minutes. Then I put everything in the slow cooker and cooked it on high for about 3 hours. Will make again!

VERY good!  I used hot Italian sausage, 1 can of petite diced tomatoes instead of 4 fresh, about 8 oz frozen spinach instead of zucchini, and 1/2 tsp dried basil instead of 1/2 T fresh.  This is extremely easy to make and so very tasty!  (Plus, you get to drink the rest of the wine.)

This was a fantastic recipe. Due to lack of availability here, I ended up using dry tortellini with spinach and there was no loss overall - per an earleir suggestion, spinach was a nice addition. While I wouldnt not typically think to use a sweet italian sausage, it was a great compliment to the flavors - I recommend NOT cutting corners here, even if you like spice like I do. My only concern was that it definitely got hearty and thick with the tortellini added, If you like more broth, it might be advisable to add an extra 2 cups of broth as well as the water.

Really good soup! I wasn't especially fond of all those lumps of pasta floating around so will try to find some smaller tortellinis next time around. Definitely gained flavor after a night in the fridge..plus the tortellinis got softer and weren't such a mouthful! Thanks to the great cooks on thequalitycook.com for recommending this to me! And thanks for posting the recipe!

I made this soup over the weekend.  Followed the recipe exactly except that I didn't have any parsley so substituted frozen spinach.  I found it very good although I think it was a bit too salty so I may use lower sodium beef broth next time.  I also think it could have used a bit more tortellini as we really liked that part of it.  I had a bit of trouble peeling the tomatoes as they were out of season.  I wonder if you could substitute canned tomatoes?

Followed advice of others and used low sodium broth,and half spicy/half regular sausage. Also, my kids don't like zucchini, so I used frozen itallian green beans instead, and hand-crushed canned whole tomatoes easily replaced fresh. I also used more basil than called for while simmering soup and reserved a little extra to snip onto soup in bowls to refresh the flavor. Someone commented about it not freezing well. The key to freezing any soup with tortellini is to make extra soup and reserve soup broth with all the veggies, etc.  freeze as is without the tortellini added, and when you're ready to enjoy the soup again, simply thaw and bring to boil adding tortellini for the last 10 mins of prep.

This was really good!  I used 1 and 1/2 pounds of spicy sausage (the smallest package that I could find) and doubled the tortellini.  This recipe has earned a regular spot on my homemade soup rotation!

Fantastic recipe.  I too used hot italian sausage. I cut the sausage into small chunks, browned in pan, drained off the fat, then ground up using a potato masher.  I used Campbell's Beef Broth and did not find this too salty at all. 
The second time I made this, I used green beans instead of zuchinni and macaroni instead of tortellini and we liked this version even better.  This is now a family favourite.

This is really good.  I used 2 cans of diced tomatoes with garlic in place of the fresh tomatoes -- just because I was in a hurry.  The soup turned out great.  Next time I'll try and use fresh ones, but I'm really tempted not to because I can't imagine it being any better.  I also used 16 oz of tortellini because I love it.  Try this recipe, it's great:)

I am making this recipe as I write this review. I am tasting it while I make it to see if it needs any more spices but it tastes wonderful just like it is. I'm not even at the stage of adding the zucchini or tortellini yet. This is an awesome recipe and deserves more than 5 stars!

Absolutely perfect.  My husband said it is the best soup I have ever made.  I did add extra cup of water.  This would only serve 8 if small eaters.   Better to say serves 4 with seconds allowed. Lol

Pretty good. Received a 4 overall rating as voting was split with a 3*, 4* & 5*. There were a few tweaks but these have been covered repeatedly in the nearly 1,000 reviews. We will probably make this again but in no rush to do so.

This soup is awesome! It's easy to make and has become one of my family's favorites. I put the soup in a large zipper bag and attach a smaller zipper bag with tortellini and freeze for fast dinners. Just take out of freezer in the morning and let thaw in fridge, then put on stove to heat, adding tortellini for the last 10 minutes. Easy and delicious!

It's time to rate this recipe. I have made it numerous times to always rave reviews. It it perhaps the best soup I've ever had, for sure the best I've ever made. The deep, complex flavors are astounding. I like to finish with a little cream, but it's not needed, just an extra special touch.

This was honestly one of the best soups I've ever tried! It was so delicious, no too thick, very flavorful. I didn't even need to stand over the oven all day, I just left it to cook! I did use less garlic though, less tortellini, a few more Italian spices and more vegetables mixed in. But I'm sure it's delicious just the way it is!

Delicious.  It was okay the first night, but the second night...wow.  Awesome.  It definitely helps to let the flavors marry overnight in the fridge.

The only substitutions I made were out of necessity.  I used muir glen fire-roasted tomatoes instead of fresh.  I also used dry basil instead of fresh basil. I'm pretty sure if I had used fresh the recipe would have been even more awesome, but it still tasted good with the dry herbs.

Incredible! Loved this! Can't wait to make it again. Used Jimmie Dean's Sage Sausage and it had a abite to it- just enough spice for me. This is one I'll make again and again and it was easy.

PERFECTO!
I cooked and diced Italian Sausage first, then added 1 cup chopped onion, 5 cloves pressed garlic (WE LOVE GARLIC), sauteed in the pan altogether. Then I added 5 cups beef broth, 1/2 cup water 1/2 cup red wine, 4 large tomatoes - peeled and chopped, DID NOT seed tomatoes, 1 Italian canned diced tomatoes, 1 cup shredded carrots with Cheese Grater, 1 teaspoon dried basil, 1/2 teaspoon dried oregano, pinch of pepper flakes, 1 (8 ounce) can tomato sauce, OMITTED. After simmering for 30 minutes, I added 1 1/2 cups cubed zucchini, and served with cooked tortellini pasta, sprinkled chopped fresh parsley and Parmesan Cheese.
Thank you!

Love it!  I tried it once with cheese tortellini and once with meat tortellini.  My kids like it better with the meat tortellini.  I also tried it once with some sweet sausage and some spicy sausage mixed.  I loved it, but my kids thought it was a little too spicy so now I just stick with sweet sausage.  I use a little less diced tomatoes because one of my kids don't like tomatoes, but no other tweaks for this recipe - it's great as is!

I substituted Sweet Italian Turkey sausage and used 6 Cups of beef broth instead of the water and wine. I also used 2 cans of diced tomatoes with basil, garlic, and oregano (drained) instead of chopping tomatoes myself. Everyone loved it!!

Awesome recipe, thank you so much for sharing!  Took a while to prepare, mainly because I have never peeled and seeded tomatoes, but so worth it.  Only made 2 minor changes-  omitted zucchini as dh doesn't like it, and I used hot Italian sausage.  A comforting soup on a snowy winter night.

One of our favorite soups this winter. I didn't change a thing, except I didn't have any red wine, so I just substituted with more water. Excellent!!

I love soup and was excited to try this but was a little nervous that it would have the flavor of a beef vegetable soup.  It didn't.  It was delicious.  I did add 1/4 cup of different color green peppers because I had them and needed to use them up.

Loved it. no edits, changes or improvements needed. {did notice as others mentioned that the leftover soup seems to get absorbed into the pasta so it became more like a stew the day after that you could eat with a fork... } We could eat this every day.

I just made this for our work snack day that had a soup theme.  And it was a huge hit!!  The flavor is that of something you would get in a fancy italian resturaunt!!  I also used petite diced tomatoes and don't skimp on the wine, it makes this soup wonderful!!

This soup tasted amazing! Added a little extra tortellini and sausage and used hot italian sausage. It gave it an extra kick. It sure has the 'Italian' feel.

AMAZING!!! Nothing needs changed. My husband hates when I cook soup, cause he's not really a soup eater, but he ate more of this then anyone else. My new favorite & I've been telling everyone I know about it.
Thanks for such a great recipe!!

Really great recipe. I subbed vegetarian "sausage" and spinach for the carrots with great results. Everyone at the dinner party had seconds and some had thirds. Some expressed a desire for the carrots to balance the spiciness. Others liked it just how it was made. Fabulous recipe.

This was wonderful! I used Johnsonville Hot Italian Sausage and I didn't have tortellini so I used Penne.  Everyone loved it. Definately had a little kick to it because of the sausage but it was very yummy.

its an excellent recipe. I adjusted to my own preference.  and you know what people that get angry that we adjust its a recipe.  I did use more garlic I used 3 cloves when i sauted my onions and garlic in olive oil... I used the jimmy dean hot breakfast sausage roll because target didnt have the italian sausage and it turned out great.  I added 3 bay leaves for the first 30 minutes italian seasoning...wasnt going to pay 3 dollars for fresh basil so i used dried basil and the italian seasoning... I also added cut up mushrooms with the zucchini at the end i used 1 fresh tomato and  1 can tomatoes for the first 30 minutes with a hint of poultry seasoning.  overall i think the recipe is great! will make again.  also seperated my tortellini from my soup so it wouldnt soak up all the juices the next day.  Love leftovers.  my spouse ate 2 bowls of it and i did too. next time i  might add more vegies...  but seasoning is always a must.

This is by far the best recipe I have found on this site! It is perfect as is! I did cheat on the tomatoes with canned diced ones since I had them on hand.

Mmmm Mmmm good. I had a lot of leftovers so I brought them to work and shared with my co-workers. Everyone loved it. I'm also not a big leftover person and I ate this soup for lunch three days in a row.

Fantastic!  This was one of the best soups I have made.  I used turkey sausage to cut down on the fat, beef broth in place of water, and a can of petite diced tomatoes (drained) and two medium tomatoes, as it is all I had on hand.  I also used dried herbs instead of fresh and the flavor was still great. I knew we would have leftovers, as it's just the two of us, so I put the soup we would eat that night into a smaller pot and then added the tortellini and a handful of spinach and simmered for about 10 minutes so the pasta wouldn't soak up all the broth sitting in the fridge.  Now when we reheat it, we can do the same and still have a good amount of broth.

I add spinach at the end and wilt it into the broth, and add about a cup of diced bell pepper. I also use chicken sausage to cut down on fat. This soup ROCKS...you have to make it!

OH MY Goodness this is the best soup I have ever made! Husband loved it! All of the ingredients complimented each other in the best ways! YUM! I used canned tomatoes as others and added a bay leaf, celery and spinach. Otherwise, as written was perfect! Thank you so much for sharing!

Made this with the last of our garden tomatoes and because I had a partially used can of tomato paste in the fridge, I used this and a little extra water instead of the canned tomato sauce
It is a delicious. hearty soup.

This recipe was AMAZING! I was very surprised that even my very picky 6 and 2 year old liked it. 
I myself did modify it a little bit  like; I did use turkey sausage (i do not eat pork) and i left out the carrot and zucchini but added fresh baby leaf spinach and i used canned tomatoes. It was very very good.!!! Next time i will add the zucchini into it and i know it will turn out just as great. Thank you!!

This is my favorite from the many recipes i've tried from the All Recipes website over the years.  I gave the recipe to both my Mm and sister.  It is real crowd pleaser. I make a big batch and we spoon it over the tortellini noodles. We happily eat this soup with salad and garlic bread from Friday until Sunday and are always sorry to finish finish it off.  I use hot Italian Sausage, sliced thin sometimes add ground beef and whatever veggies are on hand.  I would consider the zucchini absolutely essential.  Broth has great flavor!  yum!

Wonderfully delicious soup. My husband is not a fan of soups with veggies in them but he adored this soup. It was a hearty, filling soup that produced enough leftovers for lunches for the remainder of the week. I made the recipe pretty much as is except I only had 2 cans of beef broth so I used one full can of water. I also did not have any red wine so I omitted that. I used canned tomatoes and dried basil. I made homemade croutons with french baguette and topped the soup with those and an Italian blend cheese. Thank you for sharing this amazing recipe!

This soup is AWESOME! I make it all the time for my family. we like lots of veggies so we usually double that and i use 1 1/2 cups of the red wine and eliminate the water and a little bit more broth. Gives it great flavor and it totally deserves 5 stars.

This recipe was great!  The only changes I made were to use spicy ground sausage as my family likes a little zing.  I added 2 cups fresh spinach when it came time to add the zucchini.  I also doubled the fresh parsley and basil as well.  This is one I will make over and over!

I've made this several times and it is always delicious!  I know nothing about "casings removed" sausage, so I've always used polish sausage.  I've even made changes as my pantry requires and it still comes out great.  I often use a 28oz can of diced tomatoes, somewhat drained, because fresh tomatoes are expensive :(  I've made it without wine if I happen to drink all my wine, and it still turns out great.  Today I threw in a half jar of left-over salsa I've been wanting to get rid of.  Still great!  You really can't mess up this recipe!

This was superb.  I took several shortcuts, like using dried herbs and two cans (14.5 oz each) of diced tomatoes, and it was still outstanding.  It tastes just as good the next day.  I will definitely make this again.

This soup is great!  I made it as written and it was very tasty.  I agree with others that the wine really adds another level of flavor to the soup (and i hate red wine).  My boyfriend, who never requests things, asked me to make this again this week.

This was very easy and super yummy!  I had to make a couple of edits so that the kids would eat it:  I omitted the zucchini and whole tomatoes since they are not favorites of the 10 and under crowd.  I used a 14 oz can of tomato sauce instead of the 8 oz to accommodate for the missing tomatoes.  I also added dark red kidney beans since I took out the zucchini and instead of tortellini (I didn't have any on hand) I used cavatappi (corkscrew).  For a slightly healthier spin, I used turkey Italian sausage.  Will definitely make again--perfect for a cold winter day!  Thank you!

This recipe got 2 thumbs up from my husband.  Definitely a great soup.  Do not omit the wine in nmy opinio0n- it adds so much depth of flavor.  Such a great soup.  I made it exactly as is but used a bag of frozen tortellini.

This recipe is incredible. One of the best soups I have had at home or in a restaurant. I did change a few things for my family's taste. I used a whole onion which was about a cup and a half. I also used about 6 cloves of garlic and for the tomato, I used two cans of diced tomato with basil, oregano and parsley. I also used the three cheese stuffed tortellini and it was incredible. A must try!

This is a great recipe and very flexible.  If you stick with the basic ingredients, you'll have a great soup.  Don't have any wine - add more broth.  Don't like zucchini - omit or add something else.  Lots of green beans on hand - throw 'em in.   Personally, I used sweet sausage and canned tomatoes.  My husband isn't fond of zucchini, so I added it whole, removed it when cooked through, pureed it in the food processor and added it back to the broth.   I served a spinach salad and garlic bread and both complimented the soup especially well.  Dinner was delish!

This soup is amazing. I used ground up Italian sausage instead. The flavours all blend together for a taste that will bring out the Italian in everyone. Next time I eat this Ill listen to some great Italian folk music, aka the Mario bothers soundtrack

Very good. The tortellini puts this soup over the top! I thought I would have to season the finished soup...but it wasn't necessary. Update: After making this soup numerous times, I have to admit that it is our favorite soup out of many favorites. Make this soup!!!!

I made this for a friend who had just had a baby, she said they were licking their bowls it was so rockin' awesome!  I loved it and as soon as the temperatures start cooling off I will be making this, I am going to attepmt to make my own tortellini next time though, soup is expensive to make!  Definately a meal in itself!

so i tasted it right after i put everything in the pot and was confused at why i didn't feel as if this was a 5 star recipe. by the time the hour rolled along, i was in love! i'm always looking for hearty soups to win my boyfriend over (who is convinced he hates soup). men, i tell ya! i was reluctant to use the wine, since i don't cook with it, but i am very pleased. one thing i did wrong was put the zucchini in too early, but oh well! still tastes wonderful!

I made this soup awhile back and forgot I had not rated it yet.  This was really very tasty.  The only changes I made to this recipe were - I used canned tomatoes vs. whole tomatoes and I used green beans instead of zucchini because some kids were eating this soup and they do not like zucchini.  Will make again.....

This recipe is just plain delish! I used hot italian sausage and cheese tortillini....honestly, I wouldn't change a thing....had a nice kick but not to hot....took a french loaf of bread, rubbed olive oil on top and sprinkled with basil, oregano and thyme as well as a dash of garlic salt then baked....Oh, boy was that delish!

Oh so so very good and easy.  Leftovers didn't last long...too bad - I can't wait to make it again!   I plan on making this with fresh from the garden ingredients this summer - fresh basil, zucchini, onion and carrots...yum!

****DO NOT LEAVE OUT THE WINE*** Terrific. My husband, who hates sausage, loved this. I used the frozen cheese filled tortellini but next time I'll try plain.

MMMM!!  Really good and easy!  I used 4c chopped kale instead of the zuc, since my husband doesn't like squash.  And added a can of undrained garbanzo beans, eliminated the water.  Wasn't sure about the wine, but it made a nice difference!  Half a bag of the tiny dry ravioli from Trader Joe's was perfect for the filled pasta.

This has become one of my favorite soups.  I've made it twice now - once with the tortellini and once with mini ravioli and they both turned out superbly.  Great recipe.

I  made this 3 times using crushed canned tomatoes and fresh herbs.  Twice it was a 5 star and once it was a two star recipe.  The difference was the Italian Sausage.  Don't underestimate the need for good sausage.   I also doubled the sausage in this recipe because my family likes a hearty soup.  I was told the 5 star side of this recipe was the best soup my guests had ever eaten.  A definite crowd pleaser.

The broth of this soup is very tasty and smooth.  The goodies (sausage, tortellini, carrots, zucchini, etc) were nicely appointed and each was complimented well by the broth.

One of the best recipes from this site-my family loves it-even the picky 10 year old who hates soup loves this-zucchini and all.  I add the zucchini a little later in the cooking process as we like it a bit firmer.  Would love to find some low fat italian sausage for this as it is really greasy.  Have made with both dry and refrigerated tortellini pasta and both are good.  Great with fresh baked artesian crusty bread!!

One of the best dishes I've ever gotten from here.  I really was a hit with my family after making this.  I did use Hot instead of Sweet Italian Sausage and it was very well received!  I will make this again and again.

Yummy!  All 4 of my kids enjoyed it.  Good, hearty soul food.  I think I'll try to lighten the calories though with Turkey Sausage next time.  It did need more water than called for.

So delicious!  I made this recipe for a large soup potluck (50+ people) and got several compliments on it.  It was one of the first to be eaten and of course I was pretty happy to overhear a stranger saying "Did you get any of that tortellini soup???  It was AMAZING!"  I didn't change much about the recipe - just added extra broth and water in place of the wine.  I also didn't have any fresh basil so I added a spoonful of homemade pesto, which worked great. Definitely a crowd-pleaser - thanks for sharing this recipe!

made a believer out of me! i basically  can not stand soup nor consider it food :/ BUT i could not get enough of this one! served it to about 10 people and they were going crazy for more... if any recipe is a true keeper this is it! one thing i cant stress enough is make sure all vegies are very thin sliced so they melt in your mouth ;) thanks alot for this beauty!

This soup is unbelievable!  Would be wonderful on an autumn day.  I added about a 1/4 pound more sausage than the recipe called for and it was great!!  Will definitely make again!

My hubby and brother devoured this soup....loved it!! I used hot Italian turkey sausage, added some fresh baby spinach, a can of drained/rinsed white beans, cooked the tortellini seperate and added some to each bowl before adding the rest of the soup. Will make again! Thanks for a fantastic recipe!

My family likes hot sausage with this soup; a little too spicy for me. Fresh tortellini is a must.

My whole family loved this recipe.  I used chicken sausage instead of Italian as that was what I had on hand.  I also added about 1/4 cup of heavy cream before serving.  It added a bit of creaminess that was wonderful!

AWESOME! AWESOME! AWESOME!  This is one of my favorite things to eat.  A must try. Of course I added more garlic (garlic lover).  I also use canned diced tomatoes (in winter) usually of the seasoned variety. Whatever I have on hand works. If I could give it 6 stars I definately would. LOVE this soup. Thanks for the recipe.

This soup was perfect!  Kind of thought it would be "too Italian" but I grew more and more impressed with every spoon-full. Nikki's suggestions (from a review) were also helpful.  Thanks Mary P. for this wonderful soup!

I haven't even gotten the tortellini or zucchini in yet and it is so good. My boys can't wait to dig in. This will be one recipe I make many times this winter and all year in fact. No doubt about it...A KEEPER!  Thanks.

This was delicious. I threw in some leftover green beans instead of zucchini, used an extra half cup of broth instead of wine, and used five roma tomatoes (peeled and chopped, but not seeded)instead of the "4 large tomatoes). Left this on a very low simmer for about 90 minutes before adding the tortellini and the flavors were blended perfectly.

I'm sorry but I thought this soup was mediocre. I followed it exactly except for ommitting the tomatoes (don't like them), adding 1 C Italian green beans & using dry herbs. The tortellini was squishy & over cooked even though I added it when directed. If you are going to be spending a lot of time cooking an Italian soup, I recommend Zuppa Toscana, from this site (use beef boulion though). Sorry.

This was an excellent recipe. I altered it by adding more zucchini & carrots than called for because I wanted more "substance".  My kids asked for seconds which tells me it's a keeper!

Very good.  Used Sweet Italian Turkey sausage, subbed can of diced tomatoes for fresh ones, and subbed Ital. green beans for zucchini since no one else in my family likes zucchini.  Loved the flavor, and the fact it uses fresh herbs in it.  It IS a brothy soup, so if you prefer thick soups, you may want to cut back on the liquid.

Yummy! I used 3 can's of beef broth(14.5 oz),  1.5 can's petite diced tomotos.   Used dry herbs and cut the amounts in half.  Also, used bulk spicy Italian sausage.  REALLY YUMMY!  Next time I am going to put Italian green beans in like another reviewer mentioned.

I made this soup and froze half of it.  It is still awesome after being frozen.
I am thinking about trying this recipe with spicy turkey italian sausage to cut down on the calories.

THIS IS THE MOST AMAZING SOUP!! I have made this several times now and I could eat it everyday!My very picky "doesn't like anything" husband loves it, too. Best the day it's made because the tortellini gets soggy upon reheating. I use cheese tortellini. This one is a definite keeper!

I omitted the tomato because none of us like hot pieces of tomato. I doubled the tomato sauce and added 8 ounces of frozen, chopped spinach at the same time as the tortellini.  I included the sausage but I didn't actually eat the pieces in my bowl, yet it was still satisfying. Served with a loaf of garlic bread, it was an excellent and simple meal.

Sausage soup with funky pasta, that's what my hubby calls it.  This recipe is sooo good.  Even my 19 m month old ATE. IT. UP. - carrots, tomatoes, zucchini, onions and all, even drinking up the soup by taking the bowl to her mouth or with a straw. I actually used a pound of sweet and a pound of hot sausage (I meant to take out a pound and freeze it for later), but it turned out fine.  I used 2 cans of stewed tomatoes instead of chopped tomatoes and 1 can of fire-roasted tomatoes, forgot to add the sauce and a pound of tortellini.  I always cook the tortellini on its own and mix it in after - I found the starch adds too much gunk to the soup. I always forget the tomato sauce but think that it would add a nice bit of body to the soup.  I like to use something heavy like cabernet sauvignon (buy those 4 packs of little bottles if you don't drink red wines - perfect for cooking). Serve with some shredded parmesean cheese and a hunk of ciabatta bread - This soup is delicious!!

This is my first time making this soup, and I'm not even half way through cooking it. I haven't even added all the ingredients but I just tried a sip of it to see what it tastes like and WOW!!!!!! I can't wait until it's fully finished. I know that this is going to become a family favorite!! As soon as I'm done typing this out I'm going to email the recipe to my sister. I did make a few substitutions though...mild Italian sausage instead of sweet (which I'm going to hunt down for next time) and de-alcoholized wine instead of the regular kind. THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU  Mary P for this recipe!!!

THANK-YOU MARY P!!!!! THIS WAS THE BEST TOMATO-BASED SOUP WE'VE EVER HAD. I FELT LIKE I WAS IN MY GRAM'S KITCHEN.ONLY CHANGES WERE MORE FRESH BASIL [GROWN ON WINDOWSILL],FRESH GARLIC,& DIDN'T HAVE FRESH TOMATOES SO I USED A LG. CAN OF DICED TOMATOES IN JUICE & SKIPPED THE TOMATO SAUCE. I ALSO USED THE "FRESH" CHEESE TORTELLINI FROM THE DAIRY CASE. I REALLY DON'T LIKE TO CHANGE RECIPES BUT I THINK MY SUBSTITUTIONS WERE PRETTY CLOSE TO THE ORIGINAL ITEMS. WE HAD GARLIC BREAD & TIRAMISU FOR DESSERT-------AHHHHHHH, I'M IN NAPLES!

A lotta french bread, a lotta Merlot, a lotta Parmesan makes this dish VERY HAPPY. Forget Adkins, it was worth the extra five pounds.

We LOVED this soup...even my teenage son said it was a keeper. I made some changes. Instead of canned tomatoes, I used canned tomato sauce. I didn't put any zuccini in it either. During the last 8 minutes or so, I added frozen cheese tortilli vs the fresh tortilli. The leftovers didn't last past the next day.

Yummy!  This was delicious, fast and super easy to make!  I was in a hurry to make dinner, so I browned the sausage, onion and used garlic powder all together.  Then I just added all the ingredients in the pan. Added the broth, tomato sauce and carrots, no wine or diced tomatoes.  I didn't used zucchini, I used frozen caulliflower and spinach instead.  Used dry basil and fresh cilantro.  Threw in premade tortelli (the ones in the packages) in the soup and let it all boil for about 30 minutes.  Didn't need any cheese or toppings, it was great as it.  Thank you!

We loved this soup! Other than subbing chopped celery & green bell peppers for the zuchini, using canned tomatoes instead of fresh, and using a LITTLE less dried basil - didn't change a thing. Family thought this was terrific! It really warmed us up on this cool, rainy day and not only do I recommend, but I will surely make this again! Thanks Mary!

This is a fabulous soup!  I used 1/2 hot sausage and 1/2 sweet as that's what I had on hand and I think it was terrific.  Easy, restaurant quality soup.  I highly recommend this recipe.

Yum!!  I did make some changes and was thrilled with the results.  My version: 2 links of hot italian turkey sausage (casings removed, crumbled), 1/2 package of diced pepperoni, 1 med onion, 3 cloves of garlic, 6 cups chicken broth, omitted the water, 1/2 cup red wine, 1 can (14.5 oz) diced tomatoes (Italian flavored with basil, garlic, oregeno), carrots (baby carrots cut in half), 1/2 tbl freeze dried basil (great taste, much better than normal dried basil), 1/2 tsp Italian seasoning, 8 oz tomato sauce, 2 cups zucchini, 10 oz Rosetto cheese tortellini (frozen), generous dash of dried parsley, generous dash of red pepper flakes.  I added the carrots with the zucchini(last 30 min., so carrots would not get overcooked).  Last 10 min I turned the heat to low and added the tortellini.

Next time I think I will add 1 cup of wine, the 1/2 cup was very subtle.

Wonderful soup. Quick and you don't have to wait until the next day for the flavours to meld..you can eat it right away..very full bodied taste. I've made it several times, I like it best with spicy sausage, brown rice, lots of veges and different beans/legumes in it. Thank you!!

The soup flavor itself was great, but I added portabella-stuffed tortollini, and didn't like it. Next time will add plain rotini or homemade egg noodle. Flavor was so well-rounded, though! NOT a hit with young children, though.

This is a great soup.  If you love tortellini and sausage that is.  Its warm and is a meal in and of itself with some crusty bread.  Mine came out a little salty, and I think it was the beef broth I used. Next time I will use a low sodium brand.  I think this would be good with a little more tomatoe flavor as well.  The tortellini suck up a lot of the broth when its left to sit, so I had to add water the next day when I was having the left overs.

This recipe is definately worthy of all the WOW reviews it has received.  My husband, who is 100% Italian and grew up on the east coast, swears this soup is one of the best he has ever had "restaurant-quality" was how he put it. My little one was not crazy about the veggies, but he was more than happy to eat the meat and soak up all of the delicious broth with his bread.  I will be making a lot of this over the winter.  Thank you, thank you, thank you, Mary!

So very delicious! Made this to take to friends who were recovering from surgery and got texts almost immediately after I left about  the "amazing soup" with "so much good flavor".  Couldn't agree more. I had to use canned (petite diced) tomatoes because there aren't good tomatoes here this time of year, and I used half sweet and half hot Italian sausage just because of preference, but otherwise followed this SUPERB recipe.  So,SO, good! Thank you very much,  Mary.

We love this soup but since the tortellini always seems to suck up the broth, I would suggest using at least 6-8 cups of broth. I usually use a big can of crushed or diced tomatoes with basil rather than chop tomatoes.  Highly suggested!

I have been making this one for two years and never rated it. Made this at work for co-workers, next door neighbors tried it, made it again the next day then their clients tried it and made it again the following week.
Change nothing!! Great for parties, potlucks or even showing off your cooking skills.

I had to add tomato paste (about 8 ozs) as some others said and also some Better than Bouillon beef au jus starter (which I think is better than their plain beef flavor) to make this soup taste richer and more flavorful. I also added a package of fresh baby spinach. If I make it again I'll replace some of the beef broth with a can of beef consommé for richer flavor. I am boiling the tortellini separate and will add it to the soup to avoid it sucking up all the liquid. I used all fresh ingredients at the end of the summer (fresh organic heirloom tomatoes, fresh basil & parsley from my own herb garden, fresh organic zucchini and so forth). I was hoping it would have a better flavor all on its own per the reviews but it certainly needed some sprucing up --  hence the three star rating. Served with crusty, cheesy garlic bread.

Absolutely delicious!  I didn't even add the tortellini. I added orzo and it was I assume lighter, but GREAT!  My husband loved it and I actually got him to eat all the fresh vegetables that were unit!  So, it rates as a definite comfort food!

We really enjoyed this recipe. I followed the recipe exactly except I used frozen tortellini and threw in a bit of salt to suit my taste. I mixed red and yellow tomatoes because that is what I had from my garden.

Made this for a soup potluck. It was the first one gone, and the recipe was asked for many times. It was really good, kids loved it too! Can't go wrong the Italian sausage, it must be my favorite ingredient to cook with.

I have to agree with all of the other 5 star raters!  This soup is amazing.  It made the house smell wonderful, my husband said it was the best soup he'd ever tasted!

This is a most awesome recipe!  I followed the recipe exactly.  My kids loved it, older AND younger, and the general consensus was a feeling that we just ordered from a restaurant!  Super duper. I wasn't sure the red wine flavor would appeal to the younger kids, but they liked it and the pasta was "cheesey", which is always a plus in my house.

Delicious recipe.  The first time that I made it, I accidentally added the zucchini with the rest of the vegetables, but it still turned out amazing.  The zucchini lost its consistency, but it added to the richness of the soup.  There have been times when I have been traveling and unable to find the Italian sausage and so have substituted rich, smokey sausage instead and it was still amazing.

I varied the recipe slightly based on what I had on hand.  Because fresh tomatoes are generally horrible this time of year, I substituted a 14.5 oz. can of diced tomatoes; substituted half a diced fennel bulb for one of the zucchini; used a rich chicken stock instead of the beef broth; dried tortellini for fresh; and substituted dried Italian seasoning for the basil and oregano.  Finally, I sauteed the sausage starting in a cold dry pan simultaneously with the onions and garlic (a Chef John trick, BTW)and added the wine first, allowing it to evaporate before adding the broth.  All in all, excellent!

This gets a 5 for taste and a 3 for preparation directions.  And hour to cook, really?  I had mine ready in 30 minutes from start to finish, only boiling/simmering the carrots and pasta.  I also used one tomato, 4 would have been overkill.  Skipped the wine and zucchini to appeal to my daughter.  And lastly, I used mostly reduced sodium broth with a bit of regular, I think next time I will use completely reduced sodium.

This recipe is absolutely AMAZING! I have made it several times as is and every time it is a winner in this household! I have also made it with variations such as using fresh sausage instead of sweet Italian, fresh spinach instead of basil which is amazing as well. This recipe is a winner in my home as well as every variation I've come up with along the way. Thank you so much Mary!

Very good soup. I didn't have any zucchini or fresh basil so I had to use dried basil and I substituted spinach for the zucchini. I also added in a couple of chopped celery stalks. Next time I want to make it as written because fresh basil, zucchini and tomatoes are always an awesome combo. I'm sure it will be even better. I did as some others suggested and cooked the tortellini separately, put them in the bowls and ladled the soup over them. Will definitely be making this again.

Extremely flavorful!  Don't agree with prep time, however, especially considering I had another person helping me. Thankfully it was worth the wait!!! Might dice instead of slice zucchini next time. Kinda fell off the soup spoon.

To add nutrition, we add a couple of cans of beans--great northern and kidney.  We also add fresh spinach right before we eat it.  My husband loves the pasta, but I find it gets soggy...so only add what you are going to eat right away. I make it in the crock pot and it makes the entire house smell amazing!  I make enough for us to eat it for lunch all week and it keeps wonderfully---if you don't add the pasta.

The best soup I've ever made. I think the success of the soup depends on the sausage you use. If you use a spicy sausage, it will be extremely spicy after it simmers for 70 minutes. If you use a bland sausage, the result will be bland. If you're not familiar with the sausage you are using, microwave a small portion and taste it so you can make adjustments. Excellent recipe. Thank you Mary!

Loved this soup. I stuck to the recipe and it was great. Comments should be limited to people who stick to the recipe. Why give a rating when: 
use hot italian sausage instead of sweet
using chicken stock instead of beef broth 
Canned vs. fresh tomatoes 
6 oz can of tomato paste vs tomato sauce
If you want to give comments to the creator of this recipe stick to the ingredients

FABULOUS! Ok I'm the type of cook that doesn't really measure and I have a hard time following the recipe EXACTLY, its just one of those things, thats why I usually don't rate anything.  Well I made meatballs from 93% ground beef mixed with sweet italian sausage and browned them. Then I  sauteed the garlic, onion, carrots and some celery together, then added the sliced yellow and green zucchini and added italian seasoning and little sea salt, sprinkled a little corn starch on everything (so it would be a bit thinker) and mixed in 2 cans diced tomatoes. By accident  I used canned tomatoes with diced with green chilis but I LIKE the little spice it gave.  XTRA wine and a can of tomato sauce. YUMMY!!!!!! PLEASE Don't get me wrong... I am not saying this is better than the original recipe, I just like what happened in my kitchen as I started to cook. and wanted to share. ITS A KEEPER!!!!!!

This soup is so very good. As a matter of fact I am eating it as I write the review. Made this for a girl's get together this past Sunday, and they all loved it and asked for the recipe. The only thing I changed was using can tomatoes for the fresh. This is a keeper for sure.

This was great! I'm only giving 4 stars because I modified it just a tad. Following other reviewers' comments, I used 1 can stewed tomatoes instead of fresh peeled tomatoes (who has time for that?), and I used all dried herbs, which I reduced to about 1/4 tsp. I look forward to making this again!

What is not to love about this soup? It is hearty & robust and it is perfect during the cooler months. The depth of flavor is outstanding. I agree with another reviewer in that this recipe is pretty similar to a Rachael Ray recipe; nonetheless, it still is marvelous. I, too, substituted a can of diced tomatoes for the fresh tomatoes in this recipe. I also purchased frozen tortellini and cooked it off separately and served some soup over a few (4-6) tortellini pieces....perfect. This is an excellent recipe. You will not be disappointed.

I brought this in for our office "Soup Day" when it was my turn, and everyone loved it.  I cook the tortellini separately and brought it in, since I made it the night before and didn't want it to be mushy.   It was a huge hit.  I used hot Italian turkey sausage.

This was absolutely amazing!  Such a great change from regular vegetable soup and "cream" based soups.  I made the recipe mostly according to the directions with the exception of fresh tomatoes.  Since it is the beginning of fall, good fresh tomatoes are non-existent, so I used canned tomatoes.  I also did not add the tortellini to the soup, but made it separately and combined it when I got ready to eat.  Husband loved it and said it is definitely a keeper.

Delicious!  I didn't have any wine so I substituted 2 tbsp balsamic vinegar instead, but otherwise I followed the recipe exactly.  My husband and toddler loved it, too; we'll be eating this frequently!  I loved how fresh it tasted!

Very nice. My only note is that I NEVER, ever, ever cook rice, noodles or pasta in any soup I make. I cook them separately, then after I drain them, I add a little of the broth to the rice, noodles or pasta in their pan (to keep them from sticking) and then I serve them separately. I do the same with spaghetti sauce. The starches change the broths and make them impossible to store leftovers because they will continue to absorb the liquid. Also, it gives the diners more of choice. I actually learned this lesson with stew: I made a pot for dinner and a 2nd for the freezer. When I went to defrost it all I had left was meat - it had absorbed ALL the broth!

YUMMIE! Loved this soup as did my family. When I went to buy the ingredients the tomatoes didn't look very good so I did buy canned and they worked fine.  Would have preferred to use fresh.  Like Crystal I did add extra broth as well, just as needed.  The only negative I find in making this wonderful soup is the skimming. It's just tedious. I was considering browning my sausage gently then removing it and letting it boil in a separate pot so that I don't need to skim......any suggestions are welcomed.  I added a photo, I am now convinced I need white dishes!!  BTW, I did garnish with parmesan and basil.

This is one of our favorite soups.  It is very hearty and warms you up on a cold winter's day!  We like to grate fresh parmesan cheese as a topping for this soup.

Grilled extra sausage for a meal recently and froze it. Stumbled upon this recipe and used that grilled sausage, sliced up, for this recipe. Made the soup making a snap! Stored the tortellini separately as suggested. My gang loved this soup with warmed Italian bread.

This soup was delicious!  I was taking a chance by making it because my husband doesn't normally like Italian sausage, and I have a picky toddler.  But all of us love it!  I made a few substitutions because I was missing the exact ingredients: I used 1 28oz can of diced tomatoes with the juice and a can of Campbell's tomato soup, instead of the fresh tomatoes and tomato sauce; I didn't have any carrots or zucchini but I put in green pepper; I didn't have any wine.
It was delicious the way I made it. I'm sure it would be good the original way too, but I can't say for sure which is why I only gave it 4 stars.  My version is a 5 star for me!

WOW...only thing I did was add more liquid for more later and of course due to the tortellini soaks up some of the liquid.  I LOVE this and will make it time after time

very good. I added spinach towards the end and subbed chopped up leftover steak for sausage. I also subbed the rest of a jar of spaghetti sauce for the tomato sauce and chopped tomato. Worked great. A very nice spring soup to help clean out the fridge.

This soup is amazing.  I added some baby spinach, and little hot pepper flakes, and those were the only changes I made.  Thanks for the tomato tip of dropping in boiling water, etc., that worked well.  Also, the tip on using only the amount of tortellini at each serving, I will save the rest and add when I have some next.  It won't last long, it's so yummy!  My Italian parents would approve heartily.

I have been making this soup for years and it's an all time favorite! I use chicken Italian sausage (cut fat, and not so salty) and seasoned canned tomatoes are just as yummy. Served with shredded parm cheese on top and some fresh bread, it's a great meal.  Everyone asks for the recipe!!

This truly is a great recipe as is. The second time I replaced two of the tomatoes with a can of mild rotel tomatoes, added a great kick.

i used 1 lb jiimmy dean zesty hot italian sausage, 1 cup chopped white onion, FOUR cloves minced garlic, 6 beef bouillon cubes dissolved in 6 cups boiling water (will use 7 next time) 1 cup water, 3/4 c Merlot wine, 1.5 BIG cans diced italian seasoned tomatoes (perfect amt and you could not taste any diff between those and fresh) 1 1/4 cup of the pre sliced carrots you buy in a bag with the crinkle indentations in them, A FULL TBL fresh chopped basil, 1/2 teaspoon oregano, a few pinches of my mixed italian herb spice, 1 1/2 cups sliced "half moon" zucchini, (perfect amt) 8 oz fresh 3 cheese tortellini, and 3 TBL fresh parsley. Besides my few minor adjustments I followed the recipe EXACTLY and it literally could be served at Olive Garden. Fantastic, a lot like OG's Minestrone but with pasta and spicy sausage. Cant wait to make again. PS doooont put any salt in this soup if you use the bouillon cubes (I used lite sodium and without that it would have been too salty) and esp if you use the canned tomatoes :]

This was so good! The only labor intensive part was peeling and cutting the tomatoes. Make sure you have a nice piece of toasted french bread to soap up the juice!

Wonderful, wonderful and oh so delish.  I did add more broth and wine to get more of the great sauce.  This was a hit in my family the first time I made it.  Thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe.

I LOVE this soup and have been making it for about 20 years now.  Every where I've taken it and everyone who's tasted it has raved about it.  I make a few minor changes that you might like too.  I use corn instead of carrots; chicken broth instead of beef - the flavor of the beef broth is too strong for me.  I don't like wine in cooking (or at all) so I sub extra chicken broth for the wine) and I don't peel the tomatoes, just seed and dice.  I serve it with a little grated cheddar cheese over the top and garlic bread on the side.   Garlic bread - roast a head of garlic with a tablespoon of olive oil, sprinkle a little seasoning, bake for 45 min.  Squeeze into 1 stick of butter (Smart Balance - gotta cut back somewhere!  LOL!) and add a little fresh finely chopped garlic and spread on french bread, then sprinkle with a tiny bit of garlic powder and a teeny tiny bit of salt and maybe a little paprika and bake @ 350 until golden and crusty.

I made this for dinner last night and my husband and I both LOVED it! It had amazing flavor and was nice and filling for a soup. Love, Love, Love it and it will definately be something made over and over again for years to come. Next time I will probably double the recipe so we have more leftovers. (I left the zucchini out since my husband and I don't really like it and might add an extra cup of broth next time.)

Ive made this twice so far.  The first time I followed the recipe exactly, and the second time i substituted italian chicken sausage for the sausage and low sodium fat free beef broth and it was DELICIOUS both times!!  I will definitely keep this recipe for future use, but will go with the healthier version since there was no difference in taste. A perfect, hearty, restaurant quality soup...thanks for sharing this recipe!

Very Good!  I did change a couple of things. I used hot sausage, more garlic and wine, and for a time saver used frozen Italian veggies.  Only added the tortellini we would eat, froze the left over soup for the next chilly day. Husband thought it was really good.

So yummy and hearty!  I would make a few very minor modifications next time, but otherwise followed it to the T.  1) Use 2 cans (4 cups) beef broth, as I ended up w/ too much broth 2) Increased amount of veggies (used 3-4 carrots, 2 zucchini) and doubled the garlic 3) As suggested by many reviewers, I cooked only as much tortellini as I would eat in that sitting, so it wouldn't soak up all the broth

HEAVENLY!!!!   Words just can't quite express how yummy it was!  Changes:  I used sweet TURKEY sausage instead of Pork...cuts down the fat, more flavor.  I tripled the basil and added more veggies.  Skipped the water/wine and just added more broth.  When reading the recipe and thought for sure it would be bland because it didn't call for salt or pepper. It seriously does not need it!  The sausage and broth give enough flavor/salt on their own.  Fantastic soup!!

This was a great and easy soup!  I used 1 onion, 4 cloves garlic, 3 carrots, 1 whole zucchini, and used six cups beef broth and no water.  I kept the tortellini separate and everyone just added it to their individual bowl right before we ate.  Served with Italian bread and a fresh salad.  Will be making again!

This was my first time making this type of soup so I didn't know what to expect.  I followed the recipe, except I used spicy italian sausage (that's what I had on hand), and cooked the sausage in the oven.  The soup was amazing, and tasted even better the next day.  My family enjoyed it as well.  This recipe is a keeper!

I absolutely love this soup.  It's the perfect companion to a blustery fall day!  I used Red, yellow, and green onions, and much like other reviewers, added no salt and less stock so it's not too salty.  I also used hot Italian sausage.  I dislike zucchini, so it was omitted from the recipe, and I added celery instead.  I've tried it with fresh and canned tomatoes, and there is little to no difference in the taste, but the canned tomatoes save so much time!  I highly recommend this soup>>> :)

I made this with breakfast sausage because I had a whole bunch of it in the freezer and was tired of making spaghetti sauce or gravy with it.  It was actually really good!  The only modification I would make next time is to use stock and tomato sauce with little to no sodium.  I'm not a huge fan of salt and the sausage provided enough of it on its own.  It tasted even better on the 2nd and 3rd day!  A yummy, healthy, and cheap recipe!

Absolutely Delicious!  Made it today for our first Football Sunday of the season!  Made Italian Subs with it, perfect combo!  The only change I made was to use hot Italian turkey sausage.

Not a huge sausage fan, however I loved this soup. The whole time it was cooking the house smelled wonderful. I did leave out the red wine because I just don't keep it on hand and it was still wonderful.

This is absolutely wonderful. I lived on this recipe all winter and cannot wait to make it again this fall. Perhaps I am a novice cook and should have known better but using Roma tomatoes I had on hand instead of larger slicing ones ruined a batch of this soup for me:( Amazing with artisan bread! This is favorite dish for me hands down.

I made this for my boyfriend and I.  He is a soup freak, and absolutely loved it!  The leftovers were even better because the noodles soak up the broth.    Fresh basil really helps, and I also added a tbsp of cornstarch to it to thicken it a bit.    My boyfriend keeps asking when I'll make this again!

This soup was great! I made it with two different kinds of sausage, but other than that, I made no adjustments because they weren't needed! It's just me and my husband, so I had plenty of soup left over, but enjoyed eating it for lunch the next couple days... I actually started craving it, and can't wait to make it again! I suggest spooning out the fat the rises to the top, this really saves in the calorie department!

EXCEPTIONAL soup! Wonderful, wonderful recipe! Thanks, Mary, for sharing this full flavored soup. It is simple and easy to make, which, combined with the results deserves 5 stars. Served it for dinner along with Loaded Baked Potato Soup, Fabulous Fargozas (a herb, cheese and garlic muffin, which I have submitted the recipe but don't know when it will be posted on the site) and hot french bread for dipping. Every one ohed and ahhed over the meal. Both soups were the stars and no one could say which they loved more. I did make one small alteration, I used fresh spinach leaves in place of the zucchini. Oh, and I had accidentally started to add meat tortellini. When I realized this mistake I added cheese tortellini, so there was about 1/2 and 1/2. Either flavor is great and both together is even better. This soup is very versatile, but the base ingredients are a must, as they are what provide the depth of flavor to this soup.

THE BEST SOUP EVER!!!  If you ever want to impress someone coming over for lunch/dinner (who understands that soup is a meal) this is the perfect recipe.  We sprinkled parmesan on top &  had it with rosemary & olive oil artisan bread from our local grocery store with EVOO & seasonings to dip the bread in & we could not get enough. Very filling too.

My husband made this a couple of nights ago and it was probably one of the best soups I've ever eaten.  I've read that it is better the second day but I wouldn't know . . . my husband ate all the leftovers before I got home from work.  This recipe is definitely a keeper.

Mmm! I used whole wheat cheese ravioli instead. I didn't have the can of tomato sauce but will be making sure I have it for the next time. I think that would have just been the cherry on top! I used one can of chicken broth, beef broth, and french onion. I think the french onion really added extra flavor to it. I also just used canned tomatoes and a Italian mixture spice.

This soup was an absolute hit! I took advantage of the "allrecipes" calculator and made it for an organization I belong to for 65 people.  This soup is so tasty and fresh!  I added sliced mushrooms for an extra helping of vegetables. I couldn't find fresh basil so I had to use dried.  I highly recommend this hearty soup.

One of our all-time favorite soups!  This is one that gets raves every time I serve it.  I use the wine to deglaze the pan before adding the broth and other ingredients.  I almost always use canned diced tomatoes instead of fresh just because I have them on hand.

Made a couple of adjustments, since I used what I had on hand.  Used 1 can diced tomatoes, dried basil, frozen green beans in place of zucchini and frozen cheese ravioli, that I cooked according to package and added right before serving.  Cooked for 30 min as recipe stated, added parsley, green beans and cooked until crisp, tender...about 10 minutes.  This soup was excellent!  Will definitely make again and try the ingredients the recipe calls for.  :-)

This was AWESOME!!  I made this for my in-laws and the entire topic of conversation at the table was how good this soup is!  I did make some adjustments based on personal tastes.  I used spicy Italian sausage instead of sweet and it really gave the soup a nice, subtle kick.  I don't like onions, my husband doesn't like zucchini, and my father-in-law doesn't like carrots.  SO.  I just put the tomatoes, two cups of frozen corn, and two cups of frozen green beans.  It was great!  I can't thank you enough for this recipe.  :-)

This soup was absolutely delicious.  My family gobbled it down.  The only changes I made were:  I did not skin the tomatoes and nobody including myself noticed while we were eating it.  I used an entire 20 ounce package of tortellini.  The whole family appreciated this because we all got plenty of tortellini.  I am already planning on making this again.

This soup is out of this world! I used my crock pot. The night before I sauteed onion and garlic; cooked a pound of hot italian sausage; diced 3 medium carrots; used the last of my garden tomatoes plus one can of diced tomatoes; and 2 medium zucchinis. I put the onions/garlic, carrots, tomatoes and half of the sausage in a bowl. I put the zucchini in a zip top bag and the other half of the cooked sausage in its own bag and put everything in the fridge til morning. I set out the needed spices, red wine and beef stock on the counter, so early the next morning I threw the meat/veggies I had in the bowl in the crock pot (minus the zucchini at this point). I used all beef stock, no water. I upped the spices called for to my liking, and added about 3 Tbs of tomato paste because I needed to use it up. Cooked on low. After about 4 hrs, I put in the zucchini. I let it go another 3 hrs or so, tossed in the fresh pasta (I used mini cheese ravioli). Half hr later, the soup was done. Using half the amount of hot sausage was perfect. It was plenty spicy. You can always add more of the sausage if it's not spicy enough but you can't take it out if it ends up too spicy. Positively magnificent. Make this a regular in your rotation! It was served with whole grain garlic bread and green salad.

No complaints at all.  Out of necessity I first made it with chicken stock and white wine and it was great.  Soooo good with both chicken and beef stock (with white and red wine respectively).

I've made this severl times now. It is one of the best tortellini soups I've had. I am now getting ready to make it again. This time I am going to use whole wheat tortellini for more fiber to make a soup that keeps you full longer. I have used frozen and dried tortellini both have turned out great. I use turkey sausage and leave out the onion because my husband is allergic to these. As a result the soup is lower in fat. Thank you for a great recipe.

Really robust flavor; add red wine to anything and its good. Didn't have oregano or fresh basil, but it didn't seem to make a difference. Used beef ravioli. My boyfriend enjoyed it, but he said it's really a winter soup, and I served it during summer. Get over it

YUM YUM YUM!!! This is sooo good! I suggest using the FRESH chopped tomatoes instead of canned. What a huge difference! Also, I used spinach tortellinis and it was so colorful and delicious! To save time, instead of using sausage in their casings, use ground italian sausage. I added chopped kale with the zucchini for added color and nutrition. I absolutely recommend this dish!!!

Wonderful! We love this soup - made it again last night for about the 10th time.  Have taken the advice of others and used all broth and added a little garlic - other than that followed exactly and you just can't get any better!  Thanks for a great recipe.

Very good!  Even my kids, after initially whining about the zucchini, said they loved it!  I made a few substitutions.  I substituted 1/2 a can of crushed tomatoes for the 4 large tomatoes (because my children hate chunky tomatoes) and I used spicy italian sausage.  And I added some crushed red pepper, because we like things spicy.  I also made the tortellini separate.  I hate it when pasta is in soup and gets huge and soft.  And I never took out the sausage, I just added the ingredients in the order that the recipe said.

Like most people, I prepared this dish for company. Instead of zucchini, I followed some previous commenters and put in spinach and mushrooms. It was a big hit!!! So I will be making it again tonight for me and my husband as we didnt get to have much of it the first time :)

I made this tonight, and it was really good on a freezing night.  The only changes I made were omitting the wine, and using canned diced tomatoes.  It was a wonderfully flavorful soup, and we all loved it.

I made this in the crock pot. Browned the sausage first and then put everything in the crock pot. I cooked the tortellini just before serving and stirred it in. It was awesome. Next time I will try it will hot sausage.

The wine gives this soup a very fresh and bright taste.  I've used wine in a lot of soups and sauces after tasting it in this soup.

this soup is great. we made a few changes: used celery instead of zucchini, used chicken sausage, added spinach, used veggie broth, and increased amount of tomato sauce. We also added some red pepper and thyme. Hearty winter soup.

Excellent soup!  Great change from the norm.  My family loves soup and I make a different soup one to two times a week during the winter.  I have made this soup and froze the left overs in single serve containers,  It freezes well.  I have also substituted spinach for the zuchini and it is equally good.  My boys even eat it and they are not vegetable eaters.

Very, very tasty.  Making this was a big deal, in that the central smoke alarm at my apartment is very sensitive.  Suffice it to say an engine company showed up after I browned the Italian sausage.  The firefighters didn't taste it but did opine that it smelled delicious.  

The emergency response was not the fault of this recipe- just my smoke detectors.  But I just had to share that.

Anyway, very nice.  Made a double batch for frozen leftovers.  

Served with some crusty bread.  Delicious.

As I'm writing this, I have a pot of this soup simmering on the stove. My second one in 2 days. My family just loved this Sausage Soup and as soon as they finished the 1st pot I made they requested,no wait, begged me to make a 2nd. They had it for dinner, the lunch the next day and wanted it again for dinner tonight. This is a great low cost and very filling soup, and it tasted GREAT! I added everything it called for.  The only change I made is that I used Hot Italian Turkey sausage because we like lots of flavor.I added 2 packages of Tortellini because my son asked me to put in "lots of tortellini please". We all enjoyed this wonderful, flavorful soup and I can tell it will be a favorite in our house. Oh, and the best part is after you open a bottle of red wine to add to the soup, you get to drink the rest! :-)  Thanks for sharing!

Tasty soup.  I made the soup in the slow cooker after browning the sausage, cooked tortellini separately and added just before serving.  It was a little greasy, though, since I forgot to skim the fat after cooking (though I did drain the sausage on a paper towel before adding it to the other ingredients).

This is the best soup! Was a hit with everyone that got to taste it. I did add extra broth because I added extra tortellini's. I did add kidney beans also and some frozen spinach. It was like a minestrone with tortellini's. Next time will use white wine instead of red I don't like the way it smells when it cooks. It was very very good. Will make again

Lately when I try a 4 1/2-5 star recipe I've been incredibly disappointed.  Sometimes I think a few people will give it a 5 star rating just to get the ball rolling and others follow suit.  It simply makes no sense and I'm completely baffled as to why some of these recipes get 5 star ratings.  THIS is NOT one of those recipes.  This recipe DESERVES a 5 STAR rating.  It's incredibly easy and delicious.  I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of using canned tomatoes, and omitting the zucchini.  I did slice the carrots thinly as recommended and I’ve found that I prefer carrots sliced thinly in soup rather than thickly sliced.  It adds a nice texture to the soup.  You could pretty much add any vegetables you wanted to this soup.  Just play with it and add what you like.  Great recipe!

Soooooo good! I have made similar dishes several times before. I had sweet turkey sausage on hand and added crushed red pepper flakes since I like spicy. I used fresh three cheese tortellini and four fresh tomatoes- skinned and deseeded them as other veiwers suggested. I didn't have a zucchini on hand so I used spinach instead. Since it simmered for so long the broth evaporated a lot, so I added another cup or so of water before I added the tortellini. It wasn't too salty for us, maybe because of the low soduim broth and fresh tomatoes. Served with a salad and toasted garlic bread (from this site). So full and satisfied!

This is the (only) reason that I actually eat zucchini. I'm not a fan of tomatoes, so I use a lg. can of crushed tomatoes. I use Yellow tail Cabernet for the wine and Bertolli's fresh tortellini.  This is one of the few recipes that you don't have to doctor-up.  It really is perfect just the way it is.  Be sure to served with a shredded Italian cheese, crusty Italian bread, and the rest of the cabernet.  It is one of the few soups that I find to be a meal in itself.

I made this for my husband who loves soups. I ommitted the carrots due his lack of liking them. His initial comments were that it was pretty salty and could use more basil. He did say that it was better the second and third day. Still, he didn't rave like he usually does about other soups that I have made. I probably won't make this again.

My family loved this! I only changed it by adding 1 cup of water and simmering it for about an hour. I think next time I will add 1/2 lb sausage more. ( I made the sausage into balls) Loved it!

This recipe was very good. For the red wine, I used a Cabernet Sauvignon. It gave the soup a very rich flavor. The only modification I made was creating mini sausage meatballs.

This is without a doubt one of the BEST soup recipes I've ever made.  I used hot italian sausage as we like the additional kick.  Added a couple good handfuls of fresh spinich shortly before serving.  It was filling, and full of flavors.

This soup is oh sooooo good! It is a keeper. I made home made pizza, italian bread, and oil, and a good bottle of wine. And dinner was a hit. Family went back for seconds. Very nice for a cold snowy evening with friends. Used canned tomatos instead. And a tablespoon of sugar, to reduce the acid from the tomatos. Great!

I love this soup.  I have made this soup several times within the past 2 months because it is so good.  This soup is a meal!  It is not an appetizer style soup.  I would not change a thing wit it except maybe spice it up with hotter spices if the  sausage is not hot enough.

This Soup was awesome, whole family enjoyed and that alone was hard to accomplish. I used lean suasage with produced very little dripping have to use some virgin olive oil worked great. The hint on peeling tomato's was a great great help, only thing a few seconds was about a minute and a half. Will definetly make again..

This was really great!  My mom even asked for the recipe.  I used 1 cup of Merlot instead of half and no water.  I also used a large can of diced and crushed tomatoes instead of whole.  My guests did go back for seconds and my hubby said I could make it again (which of course is always a BIG bonus)!

Very, very tasty and rich.  We've made it twice already.  Both times, I used canned diced tomatoes,and half hot, half sweet sausage.  Once, I used dried basil instead of fresh.  Came out delicious both ways.  My only complaint is that upon reheating, the tortellini became mushy.

I love this soup SOOOO much.  Don't even read the recipe anymore I've made it so often.  I actually make it first thing in the morning (brown sausage, then veggies on the stove), dump everything (except tortellini) in the slow cooker on low.  Simmers all day. When we're ready to eat I cook the tortellini separately and then throw it in with some fresh basil leaves and/or spinach.  Yummy yummy.  I've only ever used canned tomatoes -- easier. Probably takes 15-20 minutes of effort.  Crusty bread and a salad and voila!!  Whole house smells incredible.  Sometimes I add extra fennel to up that italian sausage taste.

This was very good. I only made some minor adjustments to the recipe. I used canned tomatoes and did not add the tomato sauce. Used dried herbs. Additional garlic as well. Overall a pretty decent soup. I think next time I will mash an addtional can of the canellini and use as part of the base to thicken it a bit.

We really loved this.  In the future, I would just use canned tomatoes rather than fresh tomatoes, which took too much extra time to peel and chop.  I also added a can of cannelini/white beans.  Yum!  Great served with warm bread.

I'd give this 10 stars, if I could!  We LOVED this!  The only deviations from the recipe were 1) no need to drain the sausage and set aside b/c there was not enough grease to worry about, so I just tossed the onions and (extra) garlic in toward the end of browning the sausage 2) deglazed the pan with the beef broth and proceeded, which cut the cook time down by almost half and 3) didn't have zucchini or tortellini, so left the zucchini out and subbed frozen 4-cheese ravioli from Costco.  Let the ravs simmer for 5 minutes and served with freshly grated parm.  I also sliced up sourdough french bread, buttered and sprinkled with Brady Street Cheese Sprinkle from Penzey's... and stuck under the broiler.  It was SOOOOOO good... will make this one often!  Thanks, Mary!

I work a lot of hours but wanted to try this.  I changed a few things to make it faster and easier for a busy schedule.  First I used specialty italian sausage. I live in an italian neighborhood and homemade sausage is available. I also used 1 package of frozen italian vegetables which has everything in it.  I browned the meat, set aside, sauted onions, fresh mushrooms and green pepper until tender.  Then added 2 cans chicken broth.  From there 2 cans diced tomatoes which are seasoned with roasted garlic and onion, the frozen veggies, can of northern beans.  I used bulk italian seasoning, about 2T and garlic minced about 1T. I then added the meat and let it simmer.  After about 1/2 hour I brought to full boil and added frozen cheese tortellini; boiled 5 min.  Turned off the burner, covered it and let it sit while I prepared the crusty italian bread....DELICIOUS!!  You can pick and choose how to make this with the basic recipe here.  I will definately make again and again.

This was so easy ans simple.  I did not have very much fat from my sausage so I added the onions and garlic while i cooked it.  I also did not do any thing as far as simming the fat and so on.  I am more of an eyeball cook so i added more Tortellini and my hubby loved that he had some for every bite.  I made a nice salad on the side and garlic bread.  (secret for a better garlic bread! spread with butter and then add some garlic powder then add some mayo on top and top with fresh Parmesan, Romano, and Asiago cheese and toast in the oven!) Give the bread a huge flavor you will  love!  Thanks for this recipe will use again and won't change a thing .

Delicious Soup! I followed the recipe except I used 2 cans diced tomatoes rather than fresh. Also, I added some fresh spinach leaves about 15 minutes before soup was ready. Great flavor! This will go in my archives for the future.

I have made this soup many times and I love it! It has really wonderful flavor.
I always add less sausage and more veggies. You can use 2 cans of diced tomatoes if you don't have any fresh. Excellent!

Pretty simple & very good. I used 2 cans of diced tomatoes & added a bag of fresh baby spinach at the same time as the zucchini. I think this recipe would be equally good with your favorite pasta instead of tortellini.

Well, my husband loved this!  I, on the other hand, did not care for it at all.  My kids said, "five stars, mom".  So, there ya go.

This is my family's favorite soup. I realized it was better reheated the next day after the flavored blended, so now I slow cook it! MMMMM Good.

I agree with almost everyone. Best soup I ever had. My husband thinks soup is for girls, yet he ate this for 3 nights in a row and gorged on it.  Do not leave out the red wine, it doesn't taste the same. I used frozen spinach instead of zuchinni and it made the soup so beautiful. My greek friend who is a chef commented on how wonderful the soup was. Thanks again for sharing!

This was my first attempt at making soup and I sure picked an excellent recipe!  Suemck really turned me onto this recipe and I am glad she did because it was one of the best soups I have ever had.  I followed the recipe exactly and didn't change a thing nor do I think I ever will because it was perfect!  The prep work was a bit time consuming but I tackled the task in the morning to cut down on the time in the kitchen before dinner.  I was afraid that there wasn't going to be enough broth because I kept dipping into it while it was simmering.  This recipe is perfect for a weeknight meal or for entertaining.  A definite winner.  Thank you for sharing this family keeper!

I've tried a couple of different versions of this type of soup, and this one is the winner!  I used chicken/prociutto tortellini and a little more liquid than what was called for.  Using a food processor to chop and slice all of the ingredients makes this extremely easy, also!  Thanks for the recipe, Mary!

This soup isn't just good, it's OUTRAGEOUS! My family absolutely raves about it. Only changes: used canned italian-spiced tomatoes, baby carrots, low sodium beef broth, and 1/2 spicy, 1/2 sweet sausage, but the recipe is probably lovely just as is.

This soup is terrific.  I followed the main recipe, using tomatoes, basil, and parsley from my garden.  I added cut fresh green beans and a can of cannelini beans...mmm yummy.    I always make a double batch, it goes so fast in my house.

Excellent recipe!  Like others, I used spinach instead of zucchini. (because I love spinach).  I also used a large can of crushed tomato's rather than fresh.To reheat the leftovers, I added a bit of water. It is just as good the next day. Thanks, its a keeper :0)

Ridiculous how good this is!  I omitted the zuccini because I'm not a big fan, but otherwise I stayed pretty true to the recipe.  I used a combonation of frozen regular tortallini and fresh pesto tortillini.  The forzen held up much better--especially the next day.  Next time, I'll just use the frozen--but maybe frozen pesto tortallini!

I wish I could give this 10 stars!
This was absolutely wonderful...I did make a few changes to the original recipe but I just *have* to do that to everything I cook!  I added extra carrots and I added a handful of fresh spinach because I ahd some in the house.  I too used the canned diced tomatoes which worked fine.  I had no beef broth in the house so I used chicken broth and the soup was still good.  I wish I had more leftovers...there is only one small bowl left and I have hid it in the back of the fridge because I don't want to share it!!!  DELICIOUS!

We really, really liked this recipe and my husband is NOT a soup person.  It's very hearty so it's all I served for dinner with some bread and it was great!  I used canned, crushed tomatoes instead of fresh (1 lg can) and extra zucchini and no carrots.  I tried to make it at first without the red wine like several people suggested but then I ended up adding it because it seemed like it needed a little flavor kick.  The red wine really added something to the soup.  Yum.  I will definitely make this again.

Made this with hot Italian Sausage and used hot tomato sauce to spice things up. I used DiGiorno Three Cheese Tortellini in the tri-colored shells.  Also used a couple extra cloves of garlic but other than that basically kept the recipe as is and it was delicious.  Served with some garlic crostini and lots of fresh parmesan on the top.  Served the shiraz I used in the soup with the meal.  It was a big hit.  I think I'll use mushrooms next time but that will be the only change.

I absolutely love this recipe. When I'm hungry for Italian, this dish is the first that comes to mind. I used cheese-filled tortillini. Oh, my, what a delight! Thank you, Mary P. You're the best! I'm going to try turkey sausage next time and see how it works. Maybe make Lee Fogle's Italian Style Sausage with turkey and see how that works.

This is the best soup I have ever tryed. Very easy to make, and ohhhhhh so yummy! The only thing I changed was the tortelloni. By adding 2 pkgs of chicken & prosciutto (ham) stuffed tortellini for even more added flavor. (not like it needs the help though, and you can find them ready made by Buitoni)Its hearty and comforting, perfect for company as well. Not to mention the smell of this recipe wafting thru the house is to die for! MY FAMILY REALLY LOVES THIS ONE!!!!!!!!

This is a great recipe. I did alter it a little though. I only had 4 cups of beef broth, so I threw in a can of chicken broth. Also, I spinkled in some hot pepper spice and used a can of diced tomatoes w/ basil and garlic instead of cutting up fresh tomatoes. I left out the parsley as I didnt have any. I used italian seasoning in place of the fresh basil and oregano. It was wonderful!

I made this soup on a Sunday afternoon and it was a huge hit.  It is an easy recipe that was fun to customize.  I more than doubled the amount of tortellini which soaked up a lot of the broth leaving the consistency more like a stew than soup, but it was still delicious and very filling.  I will definitely make this soup again!

Made this for the firs time the other night and I have to say it was a big hit with me and my wife..  I subsituted the whole tomatoes skinned, diced and seeded for whole canned tomatoes with the seeds for the ease of use..  I'm sure I wouldn't have been able to tell the difference..

This soup was excellent!  It was nice and hearty.  I will definantly be making this one again.  The only change I will probably make is to use a can or two of low sodium chicken broth to cut out some of the salt.

This soup makes a hearty, tasty meal.  I followed the recipe exactly and found this to have an excellent combination of flavors.  I love the taste of fresh parsley in soups!  The entire family rated this 5 stars!

This soup was absolutely delicious! I added petite chopped canned tomatoes instead of fresh tomatoes and it worked out perfectly. I will definitely make this one again!

I made this for a Baptist Sunday School party and I left out the wine and the sausage and it was still great!  I also used a can of chopped tomatoes instead of the 4 fresh ones.

This was awesome!! The only thing I changed was that I bought a large can of roasted diced tomatoes and added that instead of the real thing. It was so good one of my guests requested a doggie container to take home!

This is a REALLY, REALLY good soup (one of the best from this site). I had to use smoked sausage that I sliced, then I cut the red wine to 1/4 cup, and used 4 cans of beef broth, 2 (15 oz.) cans of diced tomatoes, 2 carrots, 1/2 tsp. of dried basil, and 2 zucchini, 16 oz. cheese tortellini, and I left everything else as the recipe called for. My family gave this one a big thumbs up!

Delicious!  I used about 34 lb. sweet sausage and 34 lb. hot sausage.  I also put in 16 oz. of tortellini instead of the 8 oz. the recipe calls for by mistake.  It turned out wonderfully.  I will surely be making this again and again.  VERY good and VERY filling.

Great recipe. Very filling and hearty meal. Used mild sausage and added extra diced tomatoes. Could use a bit more broth or water because the tortellini absorbs a lot of the moisture. Make sure you top with shredded parmesan. Went well with French bread and California Zinfandel (Cosentino Cigar Zin and Rancho Zabacho Dancing Bulls).

This soup was really good. Lots of flavor. I didn't have fresh basil, so I used dried basil. My husband and kids thought it was delicious. They want me to make it again. We had it with fresh baked focaccia bread.

I made this without the zucchini and it was great!  Instead of dried or fresh tortellini, I added a 16 oz. package of frozen cheese tortellini.  Also made a different variation of this recipe by replacing the zucchini and tortellini with cannelini beans, dark kidney beans, and ditatlini pasta.  Tasted just like pasta fagioli!

This is hands down, the best recipe I have ever gotten from Allrecipes...and I've gotten a lot that I love!
I substituted spicy Italian sausage for the sweet sausage, and it tasted wonderful..
My family loved this...This will become a mainstay in my recipe box.

We LOVED this soup. I used hot sausage rather than mild because that is our preference. I also added spinach. An awesome recipe. This soup would be just as good without the tortellini , a good Italian veggie soup.

We have an open house every Christmas Eve.  We never know if we will have 12 guests drop by or 30!  I wanted to change  up the chili that I usually make and decided upon the Italian Sausage Tortellini Soup and everyone LOVED it.  I  did use both sweet and hot italian sausage and it was just the right amount  of heat.  I did serve with red pepper flakes on the side for those of us who like the heat:)  I will definitely make this again!

I almost didn't use whole, fresh tomatoes and I'm glad I took the time to seed them.  All of the flavors and textures play well with one another. It freezes well as a quick heat and go meal for one or two. This recipe is my new favorite!!

Made this tonight and it's delicious. I changed it up a bit as follows:
1. Only had white wine so splashed some of that in
2. Used 2 boxes of Beef Broth (didn't have any use for a partial box of left over broth
3. No fresh basil - used dried
4. Added about half cup of chopped celery because I like it!
5. Didn't add water
6. Tossed in a large handful of baby spinach because I had it in the fridge

Cooked the tortellini separately and added to the bowl of soup so the leftovers won't get soggy.
Topped with fresh shredded Parmessan
Served with a big loaf of hot crusty Italian 7 grain bread (we don't slice it , we just rip it) and lots of soft sweet butter.
SO good!
This one is a keeper!

This is seriously the best Meal-in-a-Soup around! (outside of Chili)   I serve this to my very hungry family, from parents, siblings, in-laws, and kids...little kids and everyone LOVES it!  I never have left overs.  For me, it's the ease that make it worth the rave too.  Quick and delicious.  I cook the pasta separate so I can add just as I serve it.  The base freezes nicely too.  I served this a a New Years party to 30 strangers and they wouldn't leave the kitchen and fought over the last ladle.  I say it's a winner!

Great recipe.  I'm sure fresh tortellini is best, but I always have some frozen and it works great as well.

This recipe is amazing! I make it often, and it never gets old. I used a 28 oz can of diced tomatoes which I drained and rinsed. It wasn't overly tomato-y. I also used dried basil, about 1/2 tsp. Everyone loves it.

Very very good soup!  I followed the directions and incorporated a few things suggested by other reviewers.  Instead of 4 tomatoes, I used a 28 oz can of petite cut tomatoes, drained.  I used the prescribed 8 oz can of tomato sauce, and added 3 oz of tomato paste (it was leftover).  Instead of water, I used beef broth, bringing the beef broth to 5 1/2 cups.  Note:  I bought a 32 oz package of unsalted beef stock which gave me 4 cups.  Since I needed more, I used part of a can of beef broth.  I'm not sure if there's a difference between stock and broth?  Overall the taste was very good, though a little strong.  The vegetables cooked very nicely and had a nice texture after cooking for the prescribed time.  Next time, I will not substitute the water, and will use all low sodium broth and tomatoes.  I also cooked the tortellini separately.  When I served the soup, I put the tortellini at the bottom of the bowls, covered them with the hot soup, and sprinkled parmesan cheese over the top.  Delicious!!

This soup was good. I just naturally prefer creamier soups, but this is perfect for a thinner broth tomato based soup.

What a great soup.  I replaces the whole fresh tomatoes with two large cans of peeled plum tomatoes which I crushed by hand when putting them in the pot.  I also added the tomato liquid to the soup. I also sprinkled ground fennel on the sausage as I browned it.

Really good soup. Cook and keep the tortallini separate and add to the soup per bowl as your ready to eat.  Otherwise the tortallini gets mushy.

This was very good. My husband really liked it and my daughter ate it as well. Seems pretty healthy too. A great comfort soup on a cold day. I used four sausage links, which was enough, and one can of petite diced tomatoes (drained) instead of four large tomatoes.

This soup is WONDERFUL. I added fresh kale in the last 30 minutes of cooking. I made with the fresh cheese filled tortillini once and the next time I only had elbow macaroni and it was still awesome.

So good!  I didn't bother to peel or seed the tomatoes.  I just diced them up and threw them in the pot and it was delicious!  I also used hot italian sausage because we like some heat.  I will definitely make this again!

Turned out great. Boyfriend loved it and it wasn't difficult or too time consuming. Boyfriend doesn't like zucchini so next time I will replace the zucchini with celery. It didn't need to simmer for an hour. Next time I will try throwing everything into the pot at the beginning and let it simmer.

Love this soup...made it exactly as written.  Can't wait to try it with a spicier sausage and will add some black beans.  The subtle taste of the wine is just right.

I always add some olive oil sauteed mushrooms in as well, adds a nice texture/flavor to this already incredible soup!

I'm making this for the 2nd time in 2 weeks upon family request.  Such an easy and healthy recipe.  I added any extra veggies that I had in the refridge.  Great way to use up anything that is getting too ripe.

Excellent recipe; everything was absolutely delicious. I ended up using spicy Italian sausages, which gave the dish a great kick. I would recommend using a nice merlot red wine for the ultimate depth of taste. Yum!

This recipe was absolutely delicious that I am keeping it in my own recipe book.  I have made it twice.  The first time I followed the recipe exactly, and then made it again this past week and doctored it.  Both are delicious, but I prefer the changes I have made to it, which are the following:

- I prefer to use mild sausage or hot sausage
- 1 large yellow onion, chopped
- 8 cloves garlic, pressed
- 5 cups beef broth
- 2 cups chicken broth
(I changed the amount of additional liquid because in the original recipe with all the additional goodies in the pot, there wasn't enough liquid to balance out the soup. I also use chicken broth to stabilize the "beef" flavor, so it's not overpowering the dish)
- 1/2 cup red wine 
- 1 (14.5 oz) can of diced tomatoes
- 1-2 whole carrots, chopped 
- 1-(8 oz) can tomato sauce 
- 1 whole sliced zucchini 
- Italian seasoning to taste
- 1 Tblsp of brown sugar (I added this in to counter the acidic flavor of the wine, tomatoes, and the tomato sauce.  You can adjust it to your liking)
- 1 chicken bouillon cube
- 6 oz, Ronzoni Garden Delight Trio Italiano pasta blend (It's roughly about half the box)

I sauté my onions and garlic first, and then add the sausage to brown.  I don't drain the sausage before I add all the rest of the ingredients, I just skim the fat during cooking time.  The chicken bouillon, brown sugar, and Italian seasoning are all added during the second step of the recipe.

Thanks, Mary P., for providing such a yummy treat!

My husband and I love this recipe!!! I have made it as is and it it perfect. I have changed it a couple times only because I didn't have tortellini or tomato sauce. I used bow tie pasta and I can tomato paste and upped the water  to 1 cup. I just made it again for dinner tonight. Almost done. Thank you for this recipe!

Amazing soup. I used a 15oz can of stewed tomatoes and it also turned out great. Plus I dished out amount needed for dinner and then added tortellini to meal. This allowed me to save the extra and not have the tortellini go soggy. Even without the tortellini it is sooooooo good! Dried spices also work great if you don't have fresh.

Fantastic!! Even my 12 and 7 year old loved it. I made no changes except I just used 6 cups broth and no water. Used 1 med zucchini and 2 carrots (I think I could added 1 more of each, plus some spinach at the end), only added the tortellini I was using that night, and served with toasted garlic bread. Can't wait to eat it the 2nd day! Will make again!

This was awesome!! Pretty much made it as is...doubled the garlic, used hot sausage and elbow pasta instead. I agree with other people that the pasta can absorb all of the broth so be careful with how much you add...

I made this in my crock pot with a few modifications.  I cheated on the sausage by using the kind used for pizza topping.  I buy it from the warehouse store deli/canteen.  It works well for homemade pizza and calzones so I usually keep some in the freezer and because the nuggets are flash frozen I can take out only what I need.  As for the rest I followed the list pretty closely and tossed the pasta in about 20 minutes before serving.  I made it for the guys at work and the loved it.  They're always asking when I'm going to make my "pizza soup" again. A little fresh parmesan cheese and a crusty Italian loaf and it's absolute heaven!

We add more carrots, zucchini and pasta. We also cook the pasta separate so it doesn't soak up the juice.

I had no idea of what to cook, and then I run into this wonderful recipe!  My charming husband rushed out to the local store and purchased the fresh ingredients that were needed.  This soup really hit the spot for my picky eaters, and my husband who loves most thing that I cook.  This recipe is worth repeating.

This is such a delicious soup! The wine gives it a deep, rich flavor. I used hot Italian sausage and a 12 oz. package of Barilla cheese and spinach tortellini and served it with warm crusty bread. Definitely a soup to make for company!

The perfect soup for a wintry day!  I made a "quick" version of this for lunch today and it came out wonderfully, so delicious!  I just browned the sausage until almost done and added the onion and garlic to it and finished, spooned the grease from the bottom of the pot, added all of the other ingredients (I used a 14 oz can fire roasted tomatoes & increased broth to 6 cups), and simmered for just 15 minutes or so.  Added the tortellini (fresh) and in another 5 minutes, done! This is a keeper.  Thank you for sharing your recipe with AR.

Fantastic!  The whole family loved it.  It's definitely worth doing all by scratch.  However, it did take me longer than the 20 min. prep time that the recipe stated--probably twice that much time.

This was a great recipe!  

I used 6 small-medium links of mild Italian turkey sausage (next time I will use spicy Italian sausage).  I used all dried seasonings and canned diced tomatoes.  I used 3 cans of beef broth (6 cups) low sodium and thought this was the perfect amount of salt (might be too salty for some- that's how I prefer it).  I didn't add water or wine and could not tell the difference.  I also omitted the zucchini and added spinach towards the end.  Great way to get veggies in and stay full!

Yum! We loved this soup. I doubled the garlic and used one can of drained plain petite diced tomatoes instead of the fresh (I didn't have them), but other than that followed exactly and it was awesome! Rich flavor and hearty. Served with baked garlic bread for dipping, and chopped salad. It was a great! Defintitely with make again :)

My family gives this recipe a double thumbs up! Delicious with some of the changes that others mentioned.  I used 4 cans of beef broth, a cup of water and a 1/2 cup red wine because I too wanted extra broth.  I used fresh baby spinach instead of zucchini. I also used 1 can of diced tomatoes and 1 can of stewed tomatoes instead of fresh tomatoes. Topped with grated Parmesan cheese before serving and served with hot, fresh from the oven loaf of bread. I will definitely Mae this one again.

OMG! This soup is amazing. The flavor in this soup was so rich and hearty. This is perfect for fall and winter but I will make it year round for sure. This recipe will be used oftern. I followed the instructions except for the tomatoes. I used a large can of whole pear toms in juice (did not use the juice). The tomatoes at the store were not looking good. It is a must try!!!!

OMG!! This was fabulous.  My husband is a meat and potatoes guy and was not crazy about the idea of having soup for dinner.  BUT, he loved it and wants to have it again regularly.  I used Italian turkey sausage and added a few frozen turkey meatballs, deleted the squash and added some fresh corn cut off the cob.  It was spectacular.  I am going to serve it for a ladies party that I am having next week instead of a boring chicken casserole.  This is the ultimate comfort food. Thanks for sharing.  I served it with garlic bread and fresh greens salad.  FORGOT to mention that I used no salt canned tomatoes and low sodium beef broth and it was seasoned just right.  Not too salty.

This is awesome, very flavorful.  I used 20 oz Italian sausage, only because that's how it was packed.  I also make the soup (without pasta) the day before I want to serve it.  It really improves with a day's rest.  Then I add the pasta right before I serve.  The pasta will sop up all the broth if left in for a long time.  I also tried it once with just plain penne pasta, not tortellini.  Very good, but WAY better with tortellini!

Made this tonight & we all loved it!! Made a few small changes but I don't think it need any! Added 1 1/2 lbs of Italian Romano venison sausage, used green beans in place of zucchini (personal preference) and used 2 cans of petite diced tomatoes with the juice in place of fresh tomatoes. Served with hot crusty Italian bread... oh so YUMMMMMMM! :)

This is a great soup - one of our favorites. I streamline it a bit by using ground Italian sausage and shredded carrots. I also add a can of white beans. Make sure you use a good red wine for the broth.

Yum! Yum! Yum! Great recipe. I am making more broth so that I can easily complete the soup for future dinners. I have a lot of extra red wine to use up and don't drink it! (Migraines unfortunately!) I had a soup night party and served this along with two others, it was a huge hit! A couple of things I will adjust next time, I won't cook the tortellini in the soup but will likely do it in water and beef broth so it still has the flavor it would have cooked in the soup. I will keep the two separate and put them together for each bowl. When the tortellini sits in the soup it starts to swell and soften, absorbing too much broth over time, it was also hard to divvy out the sausage with the big tortellini getting in the way. Not great for leftovers or when you have a soup pot on the stove for seconds (and thirds). I also added extra veg because that is what I always do and may add even more variety next time. I added green beans and a yellow squash but plan to add some chard and maybe some mushrooms). I used fresh tomatoes as the recipe calls for, tomato paste and water instead of canned sauce (better flavor) a big spoonful of sun-dried tomatoes from a jar I keep in the fridge and some additional herbs - bay leaf and rosemary. I didn't have wine so asked my sis to pick up a bottle on her way over. The soup was pretty bland without it and I was shocked at how much richer and more complex it was from this small addition. My suggestion, don't leave the wine out!

Fantastic soup!  Went exactly by the recipe except for:  I substituted turkey sausage for less fat and raw spinach for the zucchini b/c I just prefer that instead. The fresh basil gives it such a rich amazing flavor.  I also made 2 batches: one bath with gluten free rice pasta rigatoni and one batch with 3 cheese tortellini.  Both were spectacular!  This is a keeper!

Eternally grateful for this recipe!!  Only changes I made were to brown the sausage in a separate pan so it can be drained of fat in a colander and rinsed with hot water and drained again, thus eliminating need to skim fat off. Then I use 1-2 Tbsp. of EVOO to saute onions and garlic.  The second change was to use the half cup of red wine to deglaze the pan, then adding the broth, water, tomato sauce, carrots, sausage and proceeding with recipe. Reheats wonderfully.

Great soup.  I used beef broth in place of the water and used hot Italian sausage.  Other wise everything was the same.  Great suggestion from another reviewer on boiling the  tomatoes.  I did that and the skin just peeled right off. I will definitely make this again.
Update:  I started adding a bag of spinach at the end and I'm really glad I did.

This soup was absolutely delicious!  This recipe is a keeper.  I loved the sweet Italian sausage in it.  I might even add more next time-a pound and a half.

This recipe is great. Everyone loves it. It did taste like something was missing. I added some crushed red pepper and the soup came to life. I also used ground Italian sausage and made little meat balls. Simply delish

This one is an OMG. I was worried that my son wouldn't care for it, as he's not a big soup fan. Duh, one spoon full  did him in. My family couldn't eat it fast enough. One of the things I love about this site is the reviewer comments on how you can vary a recipe to suit your own tastes. And I am one of those people who does, often, alter a recipe for family tastes. First off, I am sure the original recipe is excellent, as I only just shifted it a bit. We hate zucchini; I swapped out peas. I used a pound of tortellini, cooked separately, instead of 8 ounces. I used chicken sausage, so I needed a teaspoon or so of olive oil so it didn't burn (no need to skim fat; the stuff is so lean). Only used 3/4 pound; that was plenty. But because it is, I cooked the onion and garlic with the sausage. I did use canned diced tomatoes; instead of draining, I used the liquid instead of the water and wine (sorry, wine gives me a migraine). I did use a bit of cornstarch to thicken it a bit. I cut the parsley to 1 tablespoon. I added several drops of hot sauce to give it a bit of zing (we're from the Buffalo NY area--we love a bit of zing). Oh, forgot, used chicken broth because I didn't have enough beef broth. I figure it doesn't much matter which you use, as others have noted. I served it with garlic bread. Just amazing. Thanks for the total inspiration!!!!!

By far, my favorite soup to make.  My only changes are that I use canned tomatoes instead of fresh, a different type of pasta and I double the recipe (everyone asks for some).  Perfect for freezing.

Great! I had to make this in a slow cooker because my stove wasn't working.  I think it would taste better if I could have cooked the onions and sausage the same in the recipe, but this soup is a new staple in my home.

Used Chicken sausage and fresh spinach and fresh mushrooms since I didn't have a zucchini on hand.  Used vegetable broth instead of beef.  Added one small can of diced tomatoes in place of the fresh ones and omitted the tomato sauce to have a more 'broth' consistency.  Also added fresh garlic and skipped the red wine, just added a little water instead.  Soup was very tasty served with some grated pecorino cheese.  Easy and quick to make and very hearty meal!

This is a great recipe!I took it to potluck and no leftovers.  
I didn't have the fresh ingredients, but it still turned out.
Used can of diced tomatoes undrained, and used potatoes instead of 
zucchini.  So basically same recipe!

Amazing soup. Only change/suggestion I have is to increase (double if possible) the liquid used. The pasta soaks up the broth so quickly/much.

Made this recipie with Potato Bread, and the two complemented each other well.

Amazing recipe. Even my husband who doesnt like soup loved this recipe. I used fresh basil leaves instead of dried by accident and it still turned out great. I definitely suggest adding the tortellini as you plan to eat the soup because it sops up the broth and becomes mushy as leftovers. Regardless, it is still amazing!

I rarely rate or review but feel I must give back as I've used this recipe so many times! It is truely delicious and very easy. I use canned tomatoes most often as I'm too lazy to peel fresh but I don't think it takes away anything. Highly recommend! My kids love it.

Fabulous.  I made it for Christmas many years ago and since have been able to serve nothing in its place.  My Christmas crowd of 30 people expect this soup as the highlight of their meal.  It freezes well and so I make 4 times the recipe Christmas morning, send people home with it and freeze the leftovers for a hearty meal.  Add the tortellini only to what you expect to consume.  Make fresh tortellini for any leftovers.  I use Severoli meat tortellini as the meat adds flavor.  In the summer I freeze the vegetables straight from the garden....  Peppers and zucchini and add them to the soup straight from the freezer.  I use diced canned  tomatoes that are already seeded.  It takes a long time to peel and seed enough for 4 batches.  I have never had a better soup.

Lord have mercy but this is good!  Took a crock pot full of it (to keep it warm), some garlic bread, a salad and cherry crunch dessert to a local business as a "thank you" gesture.  Brought back an empty pot for sure!!!

Lovely full-bodied broth, with an excellent flavor. I made exactly as written and the only differences were I used dried basil and oregano, because they were not in season in my garden, and I used fresh parsley, which grows all year around. I used hot Italian sausage and did as another cook suggested, and sauteed the onions and sausage together. I did use 6 cloves of garlic, since we like garlic. I like this soup and it reminds me a lot, in flavor, of Rachel Ray's veggie stoup, which I make repeatedly. I cooked the tortellini separately and added them in five minutes before serving, topped with a generous grating of Parmesan cheese. Wonderful soup, just like most cooks said, and I hope everyone gives it a try.

GREAT soup recipe!  I used turkey sausage, and it turned out awesome.  Didn't use the zucchini.  You can add any pasta to the soup, not just tortellini.  I think I didn't like the taste/consistency of tortellini in the soup as leftovers.  Better off without it.

What a wonderful tasting soup!! A meal in itself... just add garlic bread on the side!! My daughter made this soup... she doesn't like carrots so she left the carrots out. And instead of using oregano, she substituted thyme; we didn't have fresh basil in the house so she used dried crushed basil. All the flavors came together beautifully!!

fantastic as the recipie is written...watch the salt though, use low sodium beef broth (unless you make your own stock) and don't add any additional salt at all. quick tip...use about 1 cup of water, 1 tablespoon of fresh basil packed, and eyeball the 1/2 cup of wine, I like a little more...plus , love the tip on the tortellini, add as much as you need for each serving.... well done Mary P.

This soup turned out wonderful. I did add more broth and used spicy turkey sausage.(less fat) I used a cab red wine. It didn't mention what kind of tortellini, I bought homemade cheese filled tortellinis, which I thought finished the soup off superbly! Everyone had seconds, wish I had enough to freeze, it was that good! Cold night here in Missouri, so soup was the perfect meal. Thank you for this recipe!

Absolutely incredible!!!!  I made this for a New Years eve party and everyone raved about it.  The only thing i did different was to cut the garlic amount in half (not a huge favorite of alot of garlic) and I added 2 cans of Cannellini Beans - drained and rinsed.  I also grated the zucchini.  Everyone was asking for the recipe.  A definite to make again.  Even my husband that doesnt like tomato in things had 3 servings - i used the petite diced tomatoes.  GREAT RECIPE!!!

I really enjoyed eating every bite of this recipe.  I didn't use fresh tomatoes because of time, instead I used canned diced tomatoes (1 cup) and I added stuffed sweet italian sausage tortillini.  I will make this again!!

THIS IS OFF THE HOOK AWESOME!!   I will start by saying i tend to love italian food and i love my italian sausage, so i figured this just made sense.  WOW was it awesome.  I made 3 minor changes that i think were for the better.  First i used chicken stock and not beef, second i completely forgot to pick up zucchini so that was missing ( wont make that mistake again) and third i used a can of local diced tomatoes.    Buttered up some italian bread on the side to soak up the remaining juices and you wont want to stop eating!!  SOOOOO GOOD!!!

As always, I followed the directions exactly when preparing it the first time and it was AWESOME! It lasted hubby and I two nights possibly three except the tortellini got a little soggy.  This is a really good hearty dinner soup with a side of fresh crusty bread that I am adding to my regular rotation. Thanks for posting it.

I really liked this soup. I'm usually not a big soup fan but my husband so i decided to give it a try. I did get a little lazy because i didn't peel and properly seed the tomatoes, and i forgot to but basil but i think it still came out really good.

Excellent! I added chopped celery with the onion and carrot, threw in some fresh spinach,  had to use (2) 28 oz cans tomatoes with garlic, topped with parmesan cheese before serving. Mama Mia!!MMMwwwaaaa!Get some of those soft potato rolls to go with it. Don't skip the red wine, it gives the soup its body. You can even add a little more than called for, just be sure to taste as you add. I also used the dry cheese tortellini because I think it holds up better.

This soup was amazing. I doubled the recipe and my family ate all of it. I love that it has vegetables in it. I think the wine makes the sauce give it the extra flavor that makes it hard to stop eating. Serve with warm, fresh bread out of the oven. Yum!!

This has become one of my new favorite soups. I usually use dried tortellini, and add extra water or broth to compensate. I also like an extra garlic clove or two.

This was outstanding. I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of: using 6 cups of beef broth (1 quart size box plus one can-I didn't want leftover!) and using 1 can petite diced tomatoes (to save time and we don't like big chunks of tomato). I would make both changes again because we thought the soup was fantastic. Reheated leftovers for lunch and it might even be better the next day. A keeper.

Just finished dinner of this soup on the first day of fall.  Delicious!  Added spinach as a previous reviewer suggested and used cheese tortellini because I had it on hand.  My husband gives this soup 5 stars and said he would be happy to eat it anytime.

SO Yummy! I used spicy venison Italian sausage & canned diced tomatoes. Also I realized I didn't have tomato sauce so I added an equal amount of crushed tomatoes - turned out great. On the second day, the tortellini had soaked up a lot of the liquid, so I added a little more beef broth before reheating and no one was the wiser. This is a keeper!

I'm not a fan of the tortellini because it soaks up too much of the soup and I used tortellini that had a cheese filling that I didn't like. The rest of the recipe was amazing! I used canned tomatoes, and next time will use fresh tomatoes.

The entire family loves this soup. I use part spicy sausage and part sweet and I do use canned tomatoes and add more water/broth than what it calls for and a smidge more tortellini but other than that I make it just as written and my kids and husband gobble it up every time!

Great flavor! You must use fresh basil leaves - it makes all the difference. I increased the tomatoe sauce since I like a thinner broth. Plan to make this again very soon!

This is WONDERFUL!  I took the advice about the quick way to peel tomatoes and not only did it work but it was fun to do.  I definitely recommend six cups of beef broth.  I only had 5 so I subbed in a can of Campbells French onion and thought it actually came out perfect.  This is going to be a frequent flyer in my house.

This is a great recipe - I used mild italian sausage (loose, not in the casings), but there was hardly any grease by the time I browned.  So I used about a teaspoon or so of bacon grease I had reserved.  Since I couldn't find fresh basil, I used 1 teaspoon dry, and it still turned out great.  I'll definately use this recipe again.  Amazing!!!

You must try this soup - it is quite different and the italian sausage gives it a bit of a kick.  The only changes I made were to use canned tomatoes and dried basil.  Very good recipe.

I used hot sausages and low sodium beef broth with  fresh french beans cut up in place of zucchini. Let it sit over night without the pasta then the next day add the pasta.  Use fresh grated parmesan cheese! My daughter gave it a 5 out of 5. I truly bet whatever pasta you wanted to use would be great.

delicious, hearty, healthy soup!  subbed tortellini for some leftover raviolis.  garnished with freshly grated parm cheese and fresh parsley.  only downside to the recipe is the waiting of the simmering, but this meal is worth it!

I really liked this soup a lot, but when I had a small bowl, thought it needed something so I add a bunch of broccoli rabe (rappini, all I had) and it made a big difference.  Will totally make again.  Thanks for the recipe!

This has to be the best soup I have ever made!! I have already made it twice in one week! My husband hates soup...doesn't consider it a meal, but I thought I would give this one a try...pretty sure he had two bowls! We love it, I will be making this quite often! Thanks for the recipe.

Holy cow. My husband cant stop raving over it. He wants me to make it once a week! I added spinach, used 3 cans low sodium beef broth, although could of used 4 and omitted the water. I peeled the tomatoes by criss crossing the top, a quick boil, then ice bath.

I left out the red wine and added spinach and celery.  I also used hot sausage and threw in a little hot sauce.  It was absolutely delicious! This is a great meal for a cold day.

I made this for supper last night and my husband loved it!  I substituted with what I had -- dried cheese tortellini for fresh and spinach instead of zucchini -- but it was still delicious.  I did cook the tortellini separately and then combined it with the soup in the soup bowls so the tortellini wouldn't absorb all the soup broth as it cooked.  (I stored the leftovers separately, too.)  We had the soup with hot bread and fresh fruit -- it was a nice hearty soup for a cold night.

This is fantastic!!! I did sub dried basil and canned tomatoes. Also, added a few mushrooms which I sauteed with the onions and garlic. I used 6 cups beef broth and omitted the water. Absolutely delicious! Can't wait to make this again. Served with crusty bread.

Best soup I've ever made - bursting with flavor. We were hiding it from each other in the fridge just to savor the last of it for ourselves!

I made this soup for "the Parents dinner" so it was kind of risky to to make a new recipe for my parents and my boyfriends, but it was amazing!  Everyone stopped talking and ate every bite- you can't really beat that.   The edits I made were:  -I used canned tomatoes, 2 cans of italian seasoning diced  and omitted the fresh tomatoes and tomato sauce -Add an extra 1/2 cup red wine -Replaced the 5 cups beef stock with : 3 cups Veggie Broth, and 2 cups beef stock  -Added 1/2 of a green pepper too  This was a super easy recipe, and set the stage for an amazing meal.

Fantastic!  My recommendation was to change the sweet sausage to the hot italian sausage and double it!  My family loved this dish.  Will make it again and again!

loved this recipe. the only thing I did wrong was to use the bigger sized tortellini. there just wasn't enough to go around. next time I will use the smallest I can find and probably the italian sausage ones instead of the cheese filled ones. thanks for the yummy recipe.

Good flavor with the sausage and tortellini - but thought the base could use something "more"...was a little bland and I added more herbs then called for!! Neighbors LOVED it - but hubby and I thought just ok!

The broth was a bit thin, but it was extremely tasty with some roasted red pepper and freshly ground black pepper. NOTE: you only need a bit more than one plastic package of beef stock, 5 cups sounds like a lot, but it really isn't very much.  getting 1 pack and a small can of beef broth is more than adequate for this recipe  I got chicken tortellini because they were out of cheese, but I don't reccomend that flavor.   I omitted the zucchini and tomato sauce, used dried basil, used a can of diced tomatoes instead of four fresh tomatoes, and omitted the wine, and used Johnsonville sweet Italian sausages.   It worked very well!

This was FABULOUS!! So very flavorful and with a beautiful presentation.  This will be my new go-to-recipe for having guests over. Serve it with a warm, crusty bread and be sure to use a quality red wine. It makes a difference.

I thought this soup was outstanding.  I have have made it twice now in 2 weeks and am about to make it again.  I didn't have fresh basil so I used 1/2 a teaspoon of dried basil.  Same for the parsley (3 teaspoons).  I also used the hot italian sausage.  Excelllent soup - thanks Mary P.

Very good- made vegetarian with soy sausage and veg broth and still quite tasty.  Only criticism is gigantic portion (too much for family of 6! and did not taste better with reheat) and and not enough broth/stuff ratio for our tastes.

Great!!!!  I froze this soup without the pasta.  When I defrosted it I cooked the pasta seperatly and added it to the bowls then poured the soup on top.......perfect! (no more mushy pasta).  I also made my own beef broth......it really makes a big difference.

This was sooo good!  I made it today and everyone agreed that it was something you might find at Olive Garden. Did'n change anything other than to use a can of crushed tomatos as I didn't have fresh.  Definitely will make again.

Wonderful! I made it as is and my husband loved it. After his first bowl, I added 1 1/2 tsp. of red pepper flakes to add more spice. He liked this adjustment better since he loves spicy food.

This soup was excellent! I used hot Italian sausage instead of sweet just to kick it up a bit. I also used plain pasta instead of tortellini. I cooked and stored the pasta separate from the soup so it wouldn't absorb too much of the liquid. Delicious soup! Super easy!

AMAZING recipe.  This is our favorite on this site!!  This has been our fall football staple for 2 years now.  It's 5 stars exactly as it is...no changes necessary.    Some things we've learned:  It tastes better with fresh tomatoes verses canned.  To peel your tomatoes, drop them in boiling water for a minute.  The skins will peel right off.  We find it easier to buy ground sweet italian sausage from the meat counter, since it saves a step.  Parmesan at the end is a must! :)  ENJOY!

I have been making this soup with this recipe for at least a year now.  It is absolutely fantastic!!  I've made it with chicken stock and beef and either way it is great!!  I have also substituted canned diced tomatoes as some other reviewers have and it works out just fine.  Always appreciated in our house.  My 11 and 13 y/o request it!!  Thanks to you, Mary P. for this recipe!

Made it just as the recipe states. It was excellent the first time around. However the leftovers had an overwhelming cheese tortellini flavor. The next time I make it , I'll cook the tortellini seperately and add as needed to each bowl of soup. Definitely worth trying.

Husband and I LOVE this recipe and it is in my monthly rotation. I sometimes will add/change a few things like mushrooms or turkey meatballs in place of the sausage to the mix, but this soup is great just as it is written. Definitely a keeper!

Crazy good. I used hot sausage instead of sweet, and used a big can of petite diced tomatoes, drained. YUM.

this recipe was so good!! it has really good bones, and though i did make many modifications, it was only because i wanted it, not because it was needed. i used a roll of medium hot sausage, because it was on sale. to compensate, i added italian seasonings while browning along with a teaspoon of fennel, because i think that fennel complements the flavor of sausage. i also added cayenne pepper for kick, and allspice, because it complements the flavor of the tomatoes. i used crushed tomatoes instead of fresh because they were also on sale and for convenience. i sauteed leeks along with the onions and garlic, and i used 6 oz. of wine instead of just 4 oz. i used about an extra cup of beef broth, and omitted the water. i substituted quartered baby portabellas and spinach for the zucchini, and i started to forego the tomato sauce, but decided to add it. i am so glad i did because it gave the broth a really silky texture. i added frozen tortellini (also on sale) the last 5 minutes, then i let it sit for ten minutes before eating. finally, i topped it with parmesean cheese (on sale, of course). amazing!! this soup was so awesome, i ate almost 3 bowls with crusty bread and butter! mmmmm! fabulous recipe, and it is hearty without sending you into a food coma! the best part is the recipe made plenty and cost about 13 bucks to make! i freezed the rest and will be making this again.... kudos, mary p.!!

This was great....especially because I have a family that doesn't like vegetables very much.  They all ate it down and asked for leftover for lunch the next day.  The only thing I did different was use bow tie pasta instead of tortelini.  Great dinner for chilly fall nights!

Made this last night and everyone loved it. Followed the recipe except for using canned diced tomatoes and omitting the carrots. Using the fresh herbs is worth the extra time. I'm already looking forward to eating the leftovers for lunch!

I LOVED IT! I only gave it four stars because 2 of 3 kids didn't like it, but I'm already planning of ways to present it differently (like maybe adding some rice, celery, etc.). I made it as is, and my husband, daughter, and I loved it. Thanks for this great recipe!

I soaked up as much drippings as I could with a paper towel before adding the beef broth, etc. because it is much quicker than skimming the top.  We thought this was pretty good as written but just needed something more for our taste.  I ended up adding a good amount of Italian seasoning, a bit of fennel seed, and a can of Rotel tomatoes.  The green chili in the Rotel was a nice addition.  As I stated a pretty good recipe as written, we just prefer stronger flavor.

It was ok, followed to the t and just had an odd flavor, so then i added little hotsauce and a few other spices and it was a little better, but original recipe was just an unusual taste. If you decided to make i would use sausage links and fry in pan w/ skins sliced and then add to soup. I personally would not make this again. My mom who could not wait for it to be finished because it smelled so good took turn with my husband giggling and trying to be polite.

SO so good.  Should add tortelini at the VERY end as well as the fresh herbs (fresh is best).  Also used 1 -14 oz. can of fire roasted tomatoes.

Delicious! Best soup I've EVER made. Was like eating in a rustic Italian restaurant.. Seriously, I can't say enough of this recipe.. so comforting. I made as written, but used roma tomatoes and left the skin on. I used sweet Italian sausage, and a good Merlot oooh  and a huge loaf of french bread, even my children ate 2 bowls each.. A FANTASTIC way to impress anyone. My only issue is cutting down on the grease from the sausage.. you should spoon as much off as you can.

VERY good, really easy, and a big hit for dinner parties... i haven't tried this yet, but thinking i will just get a bag of frozen italian veggies and add to this next time.  i used canned peeled diced tomatoes and it was fantastic.  i'll probably add mushrooms next time too.

This soup is really great I've cooked it many times and my boyfriend loves it because it is so hearty! I deviate a little bit, I use turkey sausage instead of italian sausage and I use bow tie pasta instead of tortellini! I also add two red potatoes and in an effort to reduce preparation time I use a 14oz can of diced tomatoes instead of chopping up four individual tomatoes. It always turns out great!

My husband and I have made this several times and it comes out perfect every time.    For convenience's sake, I used canned whole tomatoes instead of fresh.  Also, when I doubled the receipe, I used half vegetable broth and half beef broth and it turned out great!

Delicious!  I've made this 4 times in as many weeks (some to share with neighbors)... To simplify preparation, I used undrained petite cut diced tomatoes (28 oz) instead of dicing my own. I used  6 oz. can of tomato paste, all dry herbs, and omitted the red wine as it's not a staple in my home. My picky 2-year-old will eat it, too.  Bonus!

FABulous!! I followed the recipe pretty closely, but left out the onions and swapped diced chicken boiled in the beef broth for the sausage (personal preference). I added a bit more wine and was generous with the seasoning. Tomatoes aren't in season right now, so I used 2 cans of diced tomatoes. Also, after letting the soup simmer down for awhile, since I used 16oz of tortellini and it took the liquid level down some, I added a bit more broth. Leftovers, are so very yummy also! Served with warm crusty bread.

This was excellent.  I made it for an italian dinner party and everyone loved it and wanted the recipe.  I used fresh tomatoes because other reviews said this was a must...don't know if it's true or not.  I used fresh sausage tortellini and think it could've been left out as it didn't add anything special other than eye appeal.  Maybe cheese tortellini would've been better, but I'd leave it out to save on cost. **Update, I make this all the time and find adding tortellini a waste of tortellini.  The soup is too good without it.  Use the tortellini as a side dish.

This was excellent! I'll be making this again. I substituted Ground Turkey with Italian Seasonings (Jennie-O) for the sausage and a 2 cans of diced tomatos with garlic for the fresh tomato.

Well...this is a very resilient recipe.  I used 2 cups of chicken broth, 1 cup of vegetable broth, and 2 cubes of beef bouillone dissolved in 2 cups hot water (I refused to go to the grocery store).  Then, I didn't have Tomato Sauce, so I used the fresh tomatoes plus added 1/2 can of petite diced partially drained.  I had some left over artichoke hearts and fresh mushrooms.  I didn't have Italian sausage, but I had Conecuh Hot Sausage...I left the casings on (too hard with this type to remove)...sauteed them in bite size pieces....drained them and threw them in the slowcooker, then sauteed the onions garlic and mushrooms and threw them in...then added all the rest that I had plus my extra stuff on low for about 7 hours.  I added BowTie pasta cooked al dente' about an hour before serving...and my daughter, hubby, and myself were raving!  Great recipe..very versitile.

Very very good soup. Fairly simple to make, but be aware that if you double this recipe it makes A LOT of soup. only the 4 star rating because you go through a lot of pans and it's not the easiest.

Absolutely delicious.  I used Italian hot sausage and a can of diced tomatoes in lieu of roma tomatoes.  I had spinach/ricotta tortellini for the pasta (cooked separately and added to soup at the end).  Was going to serve with rolls but decided the soup was filling enough.  I was right!

This is just amazing!! For sure in my top three for best soups I have ever eaten. The best part of this recipe is it is soooo easy. I followed the recipe exactly and I honestly would not change a thing about it. Everyone loved it, even my picky two year old. I can't wait to use this on dinner guests and just wow them.

This soup was really good.  I did make a few changes.  First I used 1/2 pound more sausage.  I also substituted 2 - 14.5oz cans diced tomatoes for the 4 fresh tomatoes.  One can was plain and one can was seasoned with oregano and basil.  I also increased the dried oregano to 1 teaspoon and added 1/2 t onion powder.

Excellent soup!  This was my first time making soup and boy was I pleased!  I used canned tomato because it was easier.  I also used dried herbs because that's what I had.  I also added some canned corn and green beans. Tasted great!  Very very hearty.  You could easily add more broth, if you had a large enough pot to do so.  Thanks for sharing!!

This recipe is a great "let's use what's on hand" pleaser.  I used a combination of low-sodium beef broth, as well as a tablespoon of mushroom stock base.  In addition, you can add whatever vegetables you have on hand.  I added fresh green beans, chopped banana peppers, some chopped cauliflower, and a package of frozen chopped spinach, in addition to spinach-cheese tortellini.

Once the tortellini is added, you'll probably have to add additional water, broth, wine to compensate for the absorption of the liquids.  

Using fresh tomatoes reduces some of the salt complaints.  I used a mixture of tomatoes from the garden, including the yellow variety.

This soup freezes well for an easy meal when you're too tired, lazy, or busy to cook.

WOW this really is the best. Mine didn’t come out very soupy at all, maybe because I used a 20oz package of fresh tortellini, mmmm but it was great. I also used 2 cans diced tomatoes; Italian seasoning instead because I was out of everything else….I used fresh baby spinach as well and no zucchini but next time I’ll pick up a zucchini because I love those.

My hubby is not a great veggie eater but he ate everything in his bowl, I am so pleased with this recipe. I will make this again soon for my relatives.

It was well worth the time it took to make this.  Well flavored and hearty.  My only problem was how thick it got, but I added another cup of Beef broth to thin it out a bit and it was great.  My wife hated waiting for it, but loved the taste.

This recipe was good, but I'd like to have a little more flavor. Next time, I'd add more Italian seasoning or seasoned tomatoes, or a tortellini with more seasoning or herbs. Spicy Italian sausage might do the trick too.

This is a yummy, hearty soup. I altered it a bit and it turned out great. I don't eat beef, so I used Italian chicken sausage and chicken broth. Also, instead of zucchini I used spinich. And I added some pepper. Next time I might add more garlic and some oregano. With some crusty bread this soup makes a whole meal.

This was the first time I made a soup - unbelievably good.  I am sure I will make this many more times in the months to come.

I didn't have a dutch oven, so I just used a large pot, and everything came out wonderfully.

-- 

Updated.  This has become "Dad's Soup".  I have made it a number of times and every time it has come out well.  I usually use a Marsala wine, which I have found to be perfect.  I have also done this with fresh and off-the-shelf tortellini (both with cheese or Italian sausage) and it has been good with either.  Additionally, I normally cook this for much longer (it is probably ready after the 1 hour, but I like this to be an all day affair, so I tend to cook for 2-4 hours).

The best thing about this is that the next day, I still have the taste in my head -- it's great.  I am going to teach my daughter's girl scout troop (Seniors) how to make this for their project where they are helping the homeless.  I am sure it will be a hit with the girls and with the homeless.

good and more "brothy" and hearty than I expected it to be. I used sundried tomato & basil chicken sausage from Trader Joe's and there was NO fat to speak of and the flavor was great!

Very hearty soup. Used mild italian sausage and rolled them up meatball style. Also I added most of a rib of celery and used low sodium broth. Served with italian bread. Will make this again, but maybe with a bit more broth and water.

Fantastic recipe perfect for a blustery day. I used fresh garlic sausage and a bag of baby spinach otherwise I wouldnt change a thing. Even my soup hating(I know insane) hubby loved it.Make a big batch you'll need it!

I tried this recipe last night and it was a huge hit!  The only change I made was I used two cans of diced tomatoes instead of fresh and a tablespoon of minced garlic.  I didn't have fresh herbs on hand so I used dry.  This soup is going to be a new staple in our house.  Try it- you will not be disappointed.

I'd give this one 10 stars if I could.  This is not a recipe I would normally prepare, I really was making it for a guest.  I think I could have eaten the entire pot.  I used 3 cheese tortellini and I added about 5 ounces of fresh spinach.  Next time I will add more spinach.

Followed the recipe exactly and it was good.  I wish it were a bit more savory though... maybe more garlic next time.  Served w/crusty bread.  Enough for two nights.  Will definately make again :)

I've been making a similar version of this for years and its always a favorite. I use a can of hunts diced tomatoes instead of raw,1 green pepper chopped,  2 cups of Mr.t's bloody mary mix and half cup of parmesan cheese. I also top each bowl with fresh grated parmesan cheese. Great for a group, never have left-overs unless I triple it!!!

Delicious!  I used half turkey/half pork sweet Italian sausage, 2 cans of diced tomatoes but otherwise followed the recipe as written.  The flavor was wonderful.  If you are concerned about salt, you could use low sodium broth.  This soup would also be good with spinach instead of zucchini, and just about any shape pasta.  Thanks so much for sharing!

I would give the TEN stars if I could!!  So good, better than a rest.  I took others advice and did diced can tomatoes but then remade it with fresh today, still a great taste.  A great base to add any veggies you want.  I added fresh parm at the end and it was FAB!!!

This is excellent!  What a great winter soup that is flavorful, colorful and yummy!  I did use 6 c. of beef broth and omitted the water.  I used 2 cans of diced tomatoes with the juice.  I didn't have tomato sauce but it was good without it.  I also added more chopped basil on top of the parmesan when I served it.  This is a keeper!

The kids willingly ate this without any complaints and even asked for seconds.  I used a quart of tomatoes that I canned this past summer instead of diced, other than that I followed the recipe exactly.   What sets this recipe apart is that the vinegar gives the soup a very subtle tangy flavor.

This was a great, easy meal to prepare!  I did pretty much everything according to the recipe with the exception of I used dry tortellini and added them during the last 30 minutes.  I also didn't have red wine, but had some burgandy cooking wine so I used that.  I also used some spinach and feta chicken sausages that I already had and they came out great.  I will definetely make this one again!!!

I am yet another lover of this recipe. Made it vegetarian with 2 vegan italian sausages and veggie broth and also used some olive oil to saute onions, garlic, and sausage. My picky, minimalist, meat eating boyfriend liked it too.

This soup is great after the holidays when your sick of ham and turkey.
It is my familys all time favorite, even my picky teenages and 10 year old love it. I do used canned diced tomatoes just to ease the prep time. Thanks!

This recipe has so much flavor, especially if you use Hot Italian Sausage. Whenever I make it, I send a few servings to friends, and they always want the recipe. Be sure to use all fresh ingredients, not canned or dried - that's the key.

My husband and I found this soup very good.  I made a few changes, due to not having everything I needed here at home.  I replaced the tomatoes with 1 can of stewed tomatoes, added a little fresh sliced cabbage instead of zucchini.
The one thing I would definitely change is I would make the beef broth, half the sodium.  We do like salt, and think the recipe was very good, but a little salty.
We will be making it again!

This is a good recipe - nice way to use up fresh vegetables laying around. I added some cannellini beans as well - kinda turned this into a nice minestrone with more depth of flavor.

This was the first recipe I tried off of this website...and I've been addicted ever since (to both the soup and the website!)  I've probably made this soup over twenty times in the last few years.  I leave out the zucchini (I'm allergic) and sometimes add spinach.  Excellent recipe.

This is definitely a keeper. We didn't have any zucchini handy, so we made it with some spinach and it turned out very well. I'm sure it would be very similar in taste if you prepare it exactly as described.

OK recipe. I used turkey sausage and maybe that is why It was not as good as the other reviews. I also used canned italian spiced tomatos and dried herbs.

I was true to this recipe, except for adding the wine, because I didn't have any on hand. My fiance went back for seconds and thirds and there's still enough left to feed us for another night. We both loved it, so this one will be saved for sure!

Excellent!  I added a can of great northern beans right at the end of cooking.  I also used a can of petite diced tomatoes instead of fresh tomatoes.  It tasted so good with crusty bread!  Leftovers were great!

I loved the flavour of this soup, but I wasn't struck on the tortellini.  Next time I'll try it with potatoes or macaroni.  Overall, a great recipe.

This is the best soup I've made in a long time.  I didn't even alter the recipes except for using tinned tomatoes in place of fresh ones.  Next time I think I'll add a can of white beans, but it's wonderful as-is.

My entire family loved this!  The only mistake I made...and I'm not going to dock a rating for my error...I used too much sausage by incorrectly reading the recipe.  Flavors were outstanding and if I hadn't fouled up I know it wouldn't have been greasy but divine.  Can't wait to make it again....correctly!

This was a very good soup on a cold autumn night; first time I've gotten warm today while eating it!  I scaled the recipe in half for two of us, and we ended up with a little bit leftover. I skipped the water and used all beef broth (low-sodium, which I recommend especially if you do use canned tomatoes which, like nearly any commercially processed food, also contain salt).  I didn't peel/seed fresh tomatoes (threw in one whole fresh roma because it was there!), but went with several other reviewers and did toss in a can of diced tomatoes (Muir Glen fire-roasted organic); skipped the tomato sauce altogether. Used Italian chianti wine. Cut carrots into matchsticks and added at the end with zucchini and the tortellini so they would be a bit more crunchy.  Served with a garnish of homemade pesto and a sprinkle of shredded parmesan cheese in each bowl, and freshly baked Mama D's Italian bread.  Thanks for sharing your recipe, Mary P!

This was my first attempt at making soup. This soup was amazing! Thanks to Nikki's suggestions with using 2 carrots, 1 1/2 cans of diced tomatoes, and using one medium zucchini, prepration was pretty quick. I used Owen's Italian sausage and I did not have any red wine on hand, so I used marsala wine instead. It was DELICOUS! My husband kept going back for more. I served it with Earthgrains french bread and it made a tasty, complete meal, perfect for a cold winter day. Thanks for the recipe, my husband is already requesting it again soon!

This is a great hearty meal!  We used only spicy sausage and I would at least cut that in half next time and use 1/2 lb spicy and 1/2 lb mild sausage so it's not so hot.  Makes the whole house smell delicious while cooking - perfect for these chilly fall days!

I followed this recipe almost exactly (except that I thought I had tortellini at home, but realized later that it was ravioli.  I used it anyway!)  It was good, but makes a lot of soup and is not very appetizing to look at for left overs.  I would make it again, but scale the recipe so that there were not leftovers.

This was really good and simple. I used no water, all beef broth, really big can.(Cheap) I also used one large can of progresso fire roasted diced tomatoes with the juice. So i didnt use the tomato sauce. I didnt use fresh basil, but I will next time. It was still delish. No red wine either, wouldn't know what to buy.I used frozen tortellini. I cooked them before adding to the soup. So I guess it was more than the 8 oz. It was still wonderful.Thanks

I love this soup!!! I make it every year as soon as the weather gets cooler.  I really enjoy it with crisp garlic bread on the side. Since my father is a recovering alcoholic, I make i without the wine, and it's still perfect.   Thanks for the perfect recipe Mary P!

I had to change this recipe to suit what I had on hand.  So here's how it looked.
I fried up the sausage (I used mild.)  Removed it and added the onions and garlic (I used 4 cloves).  I didn't find I had any fat with the sausage so I added some of my own.  I used 5 cups of water with 6 packets of oxo.  Skipped adding extra liquid in place of the wine and also did not add that extra half cup of water.  For the tomatoes I used a 28 ounce can of diced tomatoes that I didn't drain.  I also added a large can of tomato sauce, probably more like 12 to 16 ounces.  I didn't have fresh basil so I used dried.  I skipped the zucchini.  I also skipped the fresh parsley.
I added a little italian seasoning and some hot pepper flakes to make up for the missing heat I would have had by using a hot sausage.
The soup tastes terrific.  Maybe one day I'll get to make it with all of the ingredients listed.  I'm sure it would be wonderful!

Totally awesome soup! My step-son made it (he's 14) and it turned out wonderfully. There was quite a bit of prep but it was well worth it. Adding garlic bread to this was a nice touch as we all dipped our bread into the very tasty broth. YUMMY!!~

wow. this is some amazing soup.  caveat: i'm not a good recipe follower.  i followed this recipe nearly to the letter, thought, which indicates that it was well-written and not complicated in any way.  the flavors popped, complimenting each other.  this is not a soup for the timid, but i intend to make it many times.

Oooooohhhhh, baby--was this delicious!  I have 5 of the pickiest kids in the universe, and it passed the test.  I made only two modifications to the recipe:  I used a 14.5 oz. can of diced tomatoes, as suggested by earlier reviewers, and I also added just a dash of salt after tasting the simmering soup.  Definitely will be adding this to my personal recipe collection!

I needed a nice soup to go with an Italian themed dinner for guests. This soup is unbeleivable, I have gotten nothing but raves on it. The first time I made it I used fresh basil, the second time I used dry. They were both great, but the one using dry tasted a bit more like "pizza" than the fresh. Be sure to let the sausage brown nicely, it adds a lot of great flavor. This is going in my archives for good!

I just love to make this excellent soup, Everyone including my father-in-law, who is a professional cook in Hungary has wanted this recipe. I would give it TEN stars. I have also made it with hot Italian sausage patties if you like more zip.The fresh basil make a difference.But I have used dried. This is a keeper for years to come.

This was a GREAT soup!  It was so easy to make and soooooo hearty.  I used canned diced tomatos drained instead of fresh ones.  Make this with some warm soft dinner rolls and you will be very full!  This is def. a keeper!

This soup was terrific!  My husband thought it was the best soup he has ever tasted.  The only thing I did differently was cook the soup the night before leaving the tortellini out and heated it up in the crock pot the next day.  I cooked the tortellini seperatly and added it to the soup before serving.  Worked perfectly.  I didn't really care for the soup the following day after the tortellini had been added mainly because they had swollen to about twice their size.  It was the look of it rather than the taste.

Not bad, but not great. The soup is not very soupy -- add more broth or water if you like more liquid. It was also salty. Some tinkering will make this really good.

Rainy autumn day here today & we enjoyed this for dinner tonight. I basically followed the recipe but used spicy Italian sausage rather than sweet, dried basil rather than fresh, and canned tomatoes, carrots & zucchini. Also added lots of extra garlic because we love it. Garnished with freshly grated Parmesan, along with a few Parmesan shavings. I did simmer all day in slow cooker (after browning sausage), except for adding tortellini last few minutes. Wonderful flavorful soup----my husband especially enjoyed.....early in the meal said it's a 'keeper'. :)

This happened to be the first time I've made this soup or any soup for that matter, and it absolutely got MANY rave reviews. It was made for a church function so I change the serving portions to 25, I was on the verge of blushing from so many compliments. I did take the advise of others and used half hot and half sweet sausage, which I think really gives this soup the hearty flavor. And yes the tortellini does soak up much of the stock and it was referred to as stew by many. I've had to give the recipe out to many and my husband has even requested it again.

What a wonderful restuarant quality soup. If using tortellini disturbs you, try fettuccini. I took the advice of some others and substituted fresh green beans for the zucchini, as well. This was an excellent recipe.....Thanks

This recipe is amazing!! I omitted the zucchini because I didn't have any.  I also added a little extra garlic and tortellini to make it extra hearty.  FYI, I used whole peeled tomatoes from a can and they were delish.  I wouldn't spend the time to do this myself with fresh tomatoes.  This one's a keeper!

I followed this recipe to the "T" and I don't see what all the great reviews are about. My kids, ages 10 and 14 didn't like it at all, and asked me not to make it anymore. I ended up giving the whole pot to my sister and her family. I don't know if she liked it though. I don't like to give negative reviews, but this is my honest opintion.

This soup is FANTASTIC!!!!  We made it tonight, I did not add any water to it and also added about 1/2 cup of uncooked orzo with the tortellini. No carrots though.   I used dry herbs and a can of diced tomatoes as well and it tasted REALLY great!!!  We will try and always have some of this in the freezer from now on.  Thanks!!!

Bellisimo!!!(sp?) For my vegetarian comrades- here is what I did. I used the Morningstar sausage patties, cooked them up and then chopped in food processor. I used a 28 oz can of whole tomatoes,also chopped them in the food processor. Then added a 16 oz can of tomato soup (I had no tomato sauce).The only other changes was a tad more wine and I know I added more spice than what the recipe called for. Also added some Essence. Served with warm crusty french bread!!! Will make again and again! Thank you!

Oh my, this is so delicious. What a wonderful flavor! The fresh vegetables and sweet sausage makes this soup one of my favorites. I wouldn't alter the ingredients, and I believe the key ingredient is using sweet italian sausage, as opposed to hot or mild sausage. You won't be disappointed.

wonderful tasting soup!  I was lazy and added a can of diced tomatoes instead of the 4 fresh tomatoes.  Served with warm bread.  This would be great on a cold winter night instead of a nice spring day like when I made it! :-)

My whole family enjoyed this soup. Not many changes, the broth is excellent and I only used a 1/4 cup of wine. Kids would have liked more tortellini. Skipped the zucchini(personal pref.) but over all very tasty.

Very, very good. It was a bit salty tasting with the broth and all of the sodium but overall was very tasty. I'll definitely make this again...and again. The crusty bread and grated cheese was a must!! And the wine!

This soup is Mmm Mmm GOOD. The flavor is delicious.  One of the best soups I've ever tasted.  When I had this I was not too keen on the tortellini at first.  The next day all the flavors had a chance to coagulate and tasted great.  I still may omit the tortellini and add rice or noodles and green beans.  My family and I ooed and awed as we dipped garlic bread in the soup.

This soup was the best. It was very hearty and had a wonderful flavor. I will make it again.  I will probably try the canned diced tomatoes next time, just because the fresh tomatoes were expensive and took some preparation.

This recipe is definitely a keeper!! I substituted diced tomatoes and italian style tomato sauce for half the beef broth, it seemed to be thicker.I also used half sweet and half mild sausage. Plus I added extra zucchini and carrots. Next time I think I'll make a double batch(I passed it around family members and they loved it!), and I think I will add green beans. Thanks Mary!!

Fantastic! Excellent! I suggest all sausage lovers make it.  I kicked it up with a spicey italian sausage.

Now that fall is rolling around again, this will be the first soup I make.  The only change I make to this recipe is hot italian sausage instead of sweet and I also use canned tomatoes.  My whole family loves this soup.  Thanks so much for sharing.

We aren't a huge "soup" family, but tonight, we will be adding this soup to our winter meal plan rotation! So delicious! After cooking for an hour, I didn't have a lot of liquid left, so I might add another cup of broth next time. But other than that, no changes!  YUM!!!!

Delicious! We didn’t have beef broth so we used vegetable broth instead, and we used sweet potatoes instead of carrots. Very flavorful and will definitely make this again!

Yummy, one of the best soups I've ever made. Made a few adjustments,  didn't have wine, beef broth,  or tomato sauce. Used some chicken broth, vegetable broth, tomato paste and water. Added a dash or Worcestershire sauce and red peppers. Delicious.

I've made this many times after I was stationed in NJ and learned some IT cooking techniques.  This is a good recipe to start with.  Add a few minced cloves of garlic with the onion.  And don't skimp on the veggies.  Zuccini is great, but any long squash will do, in addition to wilted spring spinach added in.   I use chicken broth for a lighter taste to bring out the flavors and use Hot Italian Sausage to bring a bit of POW to the mix. 
Cheers

Made it as described.  I did not peel my tomatoes and did not notice anything.  This soup is delicious and will definitely be made again and again.  I plan on putting a bit more beef stock in before putting leftovers in the fridge as I suspect the tortellini will suck it up.

Outstanding! I followed as described but added a can of Garbanzo beans and a package of fresh sliced mushrooms. I intend to freeze some, so I poured the soup over the tortellini and let it sit to cook the tortellini (these tortellini cook in 3 minutes). This is a great winter meal!

Wow. Rock solid recipe that probably can handle several variations (I added a few.. didn’t have another) In my 2 decades of using allrecipes this might have produced the best result. What else do you have for us Mary?

I did make several changes.  I had no fresh tomatoes so I used 2-14.5 oz cans diced tomatoes.  I used 1 t. dry basil, 1 t. dry oregano, 2 t. dry parsley.  I used a 4 oz. package of fresh spinach instead of the zucchini, adding it just a couple of minutes before serving.  Did not use any wine.  And I used 24 oz of tortellini.  Lots of changes, I know, but we loved it!  I've even made it once with chicken broth instead of beef and it's just as good!

Very tasty but definitely needed a lot more broth. I added at least 3 extra cups of broth (I used low sodium chicken because I find it to be a better flavor) but I didn’t have any extra sauce so the flavor balance was a bit off, but still delicious. I used chicken and herb tortellini and it played really well with the other flavors. I’ll definitely make again.

Substitute 3- 28 oz cans of whole peeled tomatoes for the tomatoes. Double recipe, eat all tortellini, and add fresh tortellini for leftovers. Tortellini doesn’t keep well.

I used a cheese grater for the onion, garlic and zucchini. I didn't have red wine, so I substituted it for red wine vinegar. 

people said it was salty so I made sure to use low sodium broth. I added a tsp of brown sugar for the acidity in the tomatoes, tsp of red pepper flakes to keep it flavorful, and a tablespoon of cream because I like creamy soups. 

very flavorful! my mother said it tasted like a restaurant and everyone else in my family finished their plates.

This soup is incredible. Substituted zucchini for fresh spinach. Used dry basil and dry oregano and was totally fine. Also, used one can of petite diced tomatoes Instead of fresh?. My family absolutely loved the soup and it will become part of our regular routine.?

Used sweet sausage and browned in a pan because I don’t have a Dutch oven. Didn’t add tomato sauce, so added an extra 1/2 cup wine! My fiancé thought it needed something extra so he topped with hot sauce and said it tasted great.

Was delicious!  Only change I made was to cook tortellini in water then added to soup so it would not soak too much of the broth.  Added no salt, was salty enough with sausage and broth. You will not be disappointed if you make this.

Delicious! I used 1/2 sweet and 1/2 hot sausage! Everyone loved it and went back for seconds!

Will definitely make again.  I did cheat by using canned petite diced tomatoes which is probably why my soup looked more like a red sauce than the featured picture.  I also added 2 cups fresh chopped baby spinach to get extra serving of vegetables.

Very good soup... I had to make some pantry substitutions, I didn’t have tomatoes but I used a can of crushed tomatoes instead of tomatoes and sauce.  Increased beef broth and tortellini and threw in some leftover spinach.  Kids loved it, even the picky one

All I can say is EXCELLENT!!!!!  It's the best Italian soup I have ever tried, and I absolutely loved it!  My husband can be hard to please with soups, but he couldn't say enough good things about it.  I can't wait to make it again in the near future.

This is absolutely the best soup.  I make it about 3 times a month.  I omit the wine and add more broth.

Great soup!  I agree with one other person--I would add another cup or two of beef broth so it has more "soup".  Delicious!

I made this recipe exactly as written, and I served it with a variety of breads and cesar salad. My entire family loved it! It was hearty enough to please the meat-loving  men at the table too. I liked the balance of ingredients, seemed like the perfect proportions. We will definitely make this again!

I’ve made this several times and the family loves it.  Instead of using actual tomatoes, I used a large and small can of diced tomatoes.   I also used garlic powder instead of fresh garlic.

I made this for my grandson twice now (at his request!)! He is 23 & a picky eater. He said he “went ham on it” I followed the directions completely. I forgot to tell him to add Parmesan cheese though, so that was without! I will add this to the family recipe collection & have shared with my friends also!

This is a good hearty soup! We made the following changes with great success. Organic chicken Italian sausage (Trader Joe's), stock: 1/2 beef and 1/2 half vegetable, slightly more of all the vegetables and spinach a few minutes before taking it off the stove.

I thought this soup was going to be fantastic with the 5 stars, but for me, it was a 2 star and I had to add other things to make it better, so 3 stars is being generous. My spouse did not like it at all and asked me not to make it again. I ended up adding sugar, red pepper, jalapeno, bay leaf, and that made it edible.

My husband LOVES this soup!!! He requests it over any other. I follow the basic recipe but use some hot sausage in addition to the sweet add double the garlic and fresh basil. I add a bit more wine as well. I use fresh tortellini and instead of adding it at the end, I cook it separately and put it in the bottom of the bowl and then add the soup. Delicious!!!

this has quickly become a staple in my household! there's so many intriguing flavors in it and it all comes together beautifully I made it today on a quick Sunday and just threw it together so I used can tomatoes and I thought it was absolutely wonderful. based on previous review Merlot is the style of wine that I used and I might use a different one in the future but there's really no sense in messing with something that is this good.

Wow wow wow!  What excellent soup!  
I followed the recipe closely...but I used dried herbs and canned tomatoes.  If I had farm-to-table tomatoes I would use those but in the winter when tomatoes taste like nothing I use canned.  I would buy fresh basil for this but they were out at the store.  Definitely use more broth then it calls for, at least 6 cups. I would have liked more brother overall.  There wasn't enough broth even keeping the noodles out.  And like others have stated, it's on the salty side.  Next time I will increase the water to 2 cups so I have more broth and less salt taste.  My husband who hates Italian sausage and zucchini loved it!!!

I made some slight changes- skipped adding water, and did 4 cups of beef broth instead of 5, since it comes in a 1 quart container.  With less liquid I only simmered everything for about 35-40 minutes.  I only had sweet sausage so I made it "hot" by adding paprika and red pepper flakes.  The frozen tortellini I bought said boil for 3-4 minutes, so I did that instead of the recommended 10.  One package of tortellini (slightly over a pound) seemed like a better amount instead of only 8oz worth.

With the tweaks, it was absolutely delicious.  I was apprehensive about a tomato-based soup, since I hate tomato soup, but it came out great.  Hearty without being too rich like chowder is.

This was a hit tonight for dinner! I made a few changes, not because it wasn't fine the way it was but because I didn't have some of the specific ingredients on hand. I used dried herbs, petite diced tomatoes (2 cans with liquid) and frozen tortellini. I added mushrooms because we love them and other than having to buy sausage and zucchini at the store, I had everything else in my kitchen.  I did wait to add the zucchini until I put in the pasta because my husband is not a fan of mushy veggies. He and both kids had 2 helpings!

I made this soup as stated  (added extra beef broth and tortellini) and my family loved it! They have already asked me to make it again. I used cheese tortellini and it was delicious! Talk about comfort food when the weather is a little chilly.

Loved the flavor of the soup, but the cheese tortellini were a bit too overpowering.  I'll make this again, but go lighter on the tortellini

It was delicious  although I did change some stuff around in amounts. I used 29 oz can of tomato sauce (could or put another can in) , 2 frozen bags of cheese tortelloni, 4 tablespoons of garlic, minced dry onions as well as 1 whole onion, italian seasoning, and 3 tomatoes.

I have already made it twice in two weeks. Besides the zucchini, I also add fresh asparagus and spicy rapini ravioli from wegmans. the second batch I had to add more beef stock and wine (of course).

I made 2 changes that I would recommend trying sometime for a different take on the already-delicious original: instead of fresh tomatoes I used 2 drained cans of stewed tomatoes, and instead of tortellini I used a cup of uncooked ditalini. This changed it into a more soupy soup compared to the original recipe, but it was still delicious! Thanks for sharing this recipe!

I have been making this soup for years. My family loves it, and so do I. My kids don't even complain about the zucchini in it! 

I mostly follow the recipe, but there are a couple of things I do differently. First, I use my homemade bulk Italian sausage. I sometimes adjust the veggies a bit depending on what I have. I've never used fresh basil, but I really should sometime. I also use twice as much of the tortellini than what is called for.

This was awesome! I did not add water and I used oregano and parsley from the spice rack (not fresh).  I also added spinach as a personal preference. I am glad I took the time to take the skin off the tomatoes. The tomatoes blend in with the broth and it is delicious! Thank you for this! It is now added to my favorites and I will be making it many more times!!

Great the way it is everyone loved it. I might try red onions instead of regular and maybe celery.  I also might try different sausage types just to change it up.

I got this recipe from a recent AllRecipes magazine. Excellent! 

I omitted the carrots and added chopped mushrooms instead! I also used a full cup of Cabernet Sauvignon instead of 1/2 cup wine 1/2 cup water. 

My husband cannot stop talking about this soup. Win in my book!

This is a great soup.  I am not a fan of carrots so I left them out. I used hot Italian sausage because I like a little kick and this soup did not disappoint.

Gotta agree. Great flavor. I did the soup in a slow cooker because I'm lazy lol! Flavor is still amazing. This is very much worth it, and we will be making this again and again! Thank you for the recipe

This was very easy and very tasty. The zucchini doesn’t add much but isn’t bad. I used a can of crushed tomato in place of the chopped tomato and tomato sauce because my family has a thing about tomatoes. Would definitely make again.

Used hot italian sausage, threw in a celery and green pepper I had on hand, dry italian seasoning as I didn't have the basil.  Used 15oz can of tomato sauce, and added a little "better than bullion" for extra flavor.  Cooked the tortellini separate as per previous reviewers.  Was delicious, will make again.  I think variations to this recipe suit it just fine.

Perfect, but instead of peeling tomatoes blanch with boiled water and the skin comes off easily.

Easy recipe! Unfortunately I only had hot spicy chicken sausage, therefore I used white wine instead of red wine...it was fantastic! Cooked in pressure cooker for 10 minutes and put the noodles in each bowl instead of in the pot. Hubby loved it so much that he said to give it 5 stars and asked me to make another pot tonight. He finished the last batch yesterday. This time I will cook it for 8 mins so that the zucchini will be a little firmer.

This came out great with one mistake.  I used Hot Basillio-Buda Sausage accidentally.  No regrets.  I will try sweet sausage next so the family can have some too.

Very delicious soup!   I made for company and everyone had second helpings.    I added another cup of broth.

Hubs worked overtime tonight so I let the veggies stew. When he got home I added the pasta. I was certain that I had bought tortellini but was surprised that I had gotten Beef Ravioli, LOL  It was fine, just a little meaty.

Such a perfectly delicious meal!  I follow the recipe to a T and it's perfect.  However, you can add (and I usually do) a plug of frozen spinach or kale to up the nutritional value.

This is excellent!! The first time I did not change a thing and my whole family loved it. The second time I used the lazy version with canned tomatoes and no one really noticed a difference. Usually I can’t make soup constitute a meal according to my family, but I served this with bread and everyone was satisfied for dinner. Then we all went for it for leftovers. A definite keeper! Double batch next time. Thank you!

great recipe.. I did not have red wine at the time, but you may think about substituting Sherry (I used Red Wine Vinegar)  in If you don't have the wine..    I also made this dish for some friends and they loved it!

This is a very delicious soup! The only changes I made were to use canned tomatoes and dried basil and parsley (to save time and money) and I added green beans, because a similar recipe I made in the past included them. We rarely drink alcohol but the soup would not be the nearly as good without it- it is worth buying! I used an Italian merlot.

This is the second time I have made this soup recipe and we both love it! My husband is a little picky and he really liked this also. I added extra garlic to the recipe just because that's my preference. I made homemade ciabatta bread to use with it and it made the perfect meal. Thanks for posting this recipe!

I thought this was a great recipe! I used chicken broth and canned tomatoes because I didnt have beef broth or fresh tomatoes. Don't think either sub makes a big difference though. Great weeknight winter supper that I will make again.

Wow, better than I thought it would be!  I basically followed the recipe.  I used vegetable stock instead of beef broth, added some salt and pepper.  I didn't drain the sausage just went onto the next step in the recipe. The flavor was outstanding with so little spice, I did use fresh herbs and tomatoes.  It is  true what a previous writer said about the tortellini but I didn't mind.

I have been making this EXACT recipe for years. I stumbled on this by accident and find it extremely offensive that this lady named Mary P would take credit for it. It is listed as Italian Tortellini Soup in my Pillsbury paperback cookbook. The ingredient list and instructions are word for word from the cookbook! Great job Mary P and Allrecipes . By the way it is a fantastic soup! Enjoy

Very good.   Easy to modify.   I used a 16 oz can of tomato sauce, almost a cup of red wine, a mix of beef and chicken broth.   Just stuff I had on hand.   Great with hot bread and cheese.

My husband told me how delicious it was every other bite he took! Next time I will try to skim off more of the fat- it was a little oily for me, but overall the flavor was great and it was delicious! I made it as written except I used 2 cans diced tomatoes drained, and dried herbs and onion for lack of fresh ones. It's a keeper!

Family loved this recipe! I used canned petite-diced tomatoes to save time, and only cooked for a total of 45 minutes, adding everything but the tortellinis until the last 10 minutes, like the recipe says. I also left out the wine because I was out, unfortunately. But it tasted wonderful. I imagine it would taste even better with wine!

Very tasty recipe! I used hot turkey sausage (1/2lb) mixed with 1/2 lb 85/15 ground beef. I seasoned the meat with fennel, oregano, garlic powder, and red pepper flakes. I let  the meat  set overnight. I blanched the tomatoes, so they were easy to peel. I used fresh herbs versus dry in the soup. I also added thyme and bay leaf. As far as vegetables, I added one red bell pepper for color.  I used 6 cups of broth and a 1/2 cup water so the pasta wouldn’t absorb all the broth. It was a hit at my luncheon and some guest even ask for a second serving.

Used Italian turkey sausage  & 3 cups chicken broth & 1 cup beef broth (only because husband is sensitive to beef). FANTASTIC RECIPE. Makes plenty for leftovers. A real keeper.

This soup is outstanding....I left out the zucchini as it would have made the soup too much, and I would cut the wine to 1/4 of cup....just enough to add flavor, and not dominate the taste.

I was looking for something new and different to try and this recipe did not let me down. I added some chopped celery for a extra vegetable and used baby carrots cut in half in place of full size ones. My entire family loved it. I will definitely make this again.

Delicious! I made a few slight changes: turkey Italian sausage, bumped up the amount of spices, used dried basil and added red pepper flakes for a little heat. I also cooked tortellini separately and then added them to the soup bowls once we were ready to eat. That made leftovers more enjoyable since they didn't soak up all the wonderful broth.

Great soup recipe. I modified it a bit and used 6 cups of beef broth and a 28 oz can of crushed tomatoes instead of the 8 oz can of tomato sauce. I also used dried basil instead of fresh. Otherwise, this is a hearty, flavorful recipe that everyone in my house loved.

Simple and delicious. All natural flavors come together to make this an authentic Italian experience. Good idea to only add the tortellini you will eat in the serving - otherwise your pasta absorbs much of the liquid.

I altered a bit only because I wanted to used ingredients I had on hand. Added parsnips and celery. 1 cup of white wine, 5 cups chicken broth, 1/4 cup amino acids.

Delicious!  Great flavor, I think next time I'll add a little bit more italian sausage, just my own preference. Otherwise it was great! Husband scarfed it down, even had seconds.

Love it, delicious. Have made it many times. I use half sweet and half spicy Italian sausage for some heat. Careful with the tortellini, it’ll soak up the soup overtime.

I've made this recipe many times.  My husband and I love it! The only changes that I've made is to deglaze the pot with the red wine  after sautéing  the onions and garlic.  Also , I like to add a couple of handfuls of spinach at the end as someone else suggested.

Great Recipe! I kept everything basically the same with most substitutes of what I had on hand. Worked out awesome and the whole family loved it, 11month old-6 years old ate it, too. (Here were my subs: kielbasa sausage vs Italian, chicken bouillon vs beef broth, two cans diced tomatoes vs tomatoes, no zucchini, same herbs basically, added chives, ravioli vs tortellini, frozen mixed veggies vs sliced carrots)... That was a ton of subs but it was what I had on hand and the recipe fit!

Fabulous soup!  As suggested by others, I used 6 cups of beef broth, added a bag of fresh spinach, and only added enough tortellini that we ate for the specific dinner as it does absorb the broth a bit.  This is a keeper, especially for a cold winter night.  All you need is some garlic bread and wine.

Well liked.  Just a few alteration/additions:
cook tortillini separate,
just use 2 cans undrained tomatoes instead of 4 tomatoes and 1/2 c water,
add 1 c spinach and 1 can garbanzo beans last 10 min of cooking,
add frozen corn halfway through first 30 min simmer,
garnish with fresh parm ,
serve with grilled french bread (butter each side, cook, sprinkle with parm and cover skillet to melt it)

This was a hit! I had 3 cans of organic diced tomato’s, and no zucchini. But I doubled the recipe. 1 lb sweet sausage 1 lb mild Italian sausage. We also added some canned mushrooms, again because we had them on hand. But it will be a regular addition to our menu!!

Amazing soup!!!! Hands down my favorite soup ever! Didn’t change a thing the first time making it but since we are trying to be healthier, we’ve traded the sausage out with light life veggie sausage, and we still enjoy it with that change. Try it, it doesn’t disappoint on a cold day.

I used broccoli instead of zucchini.  Used 6 cups broth instead of 5 since I don’t like soup too thick.  

Great flavor!!!! 

Placed tomatoes in boiling water for 2-3 minutes.  Skin peels right off.

The prep process is a bit long but sooo worth it. I added Kale instead of carrots and mushrooms with some lemon juice to break up the flavor and add more density to it. I used Merlot but I am sure any red wine will do the job!

This is a delicious  soup recipe! I did a few things differently than what the recipe calls for though.   I used a good quality canned plum tomatoes instead of  fresh tomatoes.  Also for a lighter version I used Italian chicken sausage.  I love mushrooms so I  added 1/2 dozen sliced shiitake mushrooms  to the soup.  I cooked the tortellini's in the soup however  I took the advice of a previous rating that said they will absorb too much of the broth if you leave them in the soup.  So once they were finished cooking I took them out  of the soup  to add later at meal time.

I made it and my family really enjoyed it. I left out the red wine and garlic. I find the Italian sausage I use already has garlic and find that I don't need to add more but of course this is just to satisfy certain members of my family. I have made it twice this fall and plan to make it again. It is well worth the effort.

Amazing! Deliciously hearty, but light enough for you to dip some toasted bread in there and call it a meal. This recipe has made it into my list of favourites, and will definitely continue making it for my family in the future. If you can't find sweet sausage, then mild Italian sausage will do just fine and still tasted phenomenal.

Make it as directed or substitute turkey sausage for a little healthier result.  Either way this soup is a family favorite!

I have been making variations of this soup for many years and it was a staple in my home. I grew up in an Italian-American community and this soup went the rounds among family and friends. It brings back memories of a time now lost. Pass this on to a friend or neighbor.

Really enjoyed this soup. I forgot to drain the fat so it rated a bit oily so will remember to remove for day 2 and next time. The only difference made we made was not adding the water to dilute the base. It was flavorful and this is going in our rotation.

So I made this soup but instead of tortellini I used mini cheese stuffed ravioli and all I can say is wow. I didn’t even have to worry about the leftovers getting soggy because there were none!!!! I seriously could not stop eating it. Thinking about trying it in the crockpot and wondering if anyone has?

I will definitely make it again.  I used a can of low sodium diced tomatoes in place of fresh and towards the end I added a couple handfuls of trimmed and washed baby spinach.  It's a hit in our family.  Have given some to a friend to help recovery after surgery and her husband illoved

Though I changed this recipe up based on what I had, it was a great starting point.  Used about 8 cups chicken broth instead of beef and no water; used ground Italian sausage; did not use tomato sauce or wine; used 1 can diced tomatoes and 1 whole yellow squash; used all dried spices including Italian blend; used at least 6 cloves of garlic; added about 1/2 tsp red pepper flakes to the veggies while sauteing (note that I saute the carrots and squash with the onions and garlic along with the sausage and some extra evoo); a couple of dashes of liquid aminos to the broth (a staple in my kitchen); added a couple of handfuls of fresh arugula, the entire container of fresh tortellini, and s&p to taste.  It was completely consumed by all (including the picky 8-year old!)  Definitely a keeper and many thanks for the inspiration!

Delicious! This was perfect for a cold winter's night. I must admit that I made a few changes - added some additional veggies (celery and green bell pepper sautéed with the onion), 1/2 t red chili flakes, and 1/2 t rosemary. I served it with garlic bread and a nice glass of red wine.

Skipped the diced tomatoes and zucchini and instead used orange bell pepper and spinach. Also lightened the recipe with chicken sausage since it’s what I had. Tired out fantastic!

primary mod to have no cheese.  substitute bow tie pasta for tortellini.
used chicken vs beef broth.
used canned fire roasted tomatoes vs peeled seeded and chopped.

will definitely make again!

Excellent soup!  My husband and 11 yr old twins gave this rave reviews!  Oh I made this in the InstantPot and it was perfect!!  Only change made was the addition of  spinach. Manual 3 minutes and NPR for 10, then add spinach. This recipe makes a ton and next time  I’ll share some with our neighbors. Thanks!

This was absolutely delicious! I had a package of cheese tortellini and was looking for a creative way to use it in the best way to be a single meal with protein, veggies, etc. This hit the nail on the head and was a big hit with the family. It was packed with flavor. We loved it!

Delicious! My husband usually turns his nose up at soup for dinner and commented after consuming two bowls, two hours later about how the great meal was!!! Used dried herbs, a large can of fire roasted diced tomatoes and 16 oz of tortellini as my only changes. Did I say it was delicious?Thank you Mary P!

Great flavor! My husband kept raving about it. The only change we made was putting drained diced canned tomatoes in there instead of fresh.

This was delicious. My soup hating husband asked for seconds. 
It does feel like it takes forever to cook, but definitely worth it. 
Also, I did as others had suggested and used a can of diced tomatoes in place of the fresh ones.

The only change was adding   extra wine and crushed  tomatoes. I also sprinkled Parmesan Romano cheese when serving. It's a wonderfully delicious soup to make on a cold winter day served with garlic bread.   At first my husband said he wouldn't like it, but after one spoonful really loved it and wants me to make it again.

We really love this soup!  The sauage and tortellini combo is yummy!  I didn’t make any changes to the recipe, as I like to make the original recipe first and then make changes if need be the second time around.  This soup is in my rotation every two weeks!

This turned out delicious.  My whole family liked it, some even eating two bowls.  My husband doesn’t like spinach, and my daughter doesn’t like tomatoes, but they both loved it.  The only thing I did different cause I found it easier, is I broiled the sausage till it cooked and browned, then I cut it up in slices and added it when called for. Will definitely make again!

I made it just as written and it was delicious!!!!  But THEN, I added a little bit of heavy cream and OMG it took things to the next level!!!!!  For those who aren’t wine drinkers like me, I used a cheap Cabernet Sauvignon and it worked just fine.  Adding to the recipe book!

GREAT soup! My dad well doesn't care for souls loved it as well as two guy friends I shared it with. I made a couple mild substitutions based off of what I read.Used 2 green zucchini and 1 yellow zucchini. Used 16 ounces of frozen tortellini. Put in extra basil and used rosemary in soup along with other herbs.Use an extra cup/cup and a half of beef broth (6.5 cups total.) It helped so there was still liquid after the tortellini absorbs a lot of the broth. Also use a half pound of mild sausage and half pound of hot sausage.For tomatoes, I put in 2 cans of drained cubed petite tomatoes. Would possibly add some spinach for a little extra something.

This recipe is fantastic right after you make it, but it is even better as leftovers!  I used frozen tortellini, canned (drained) tomatoes, and sherry wine (instead of red) because that's what I had and it turned out excellent.

I know some people recommended making the tortellini separate as you eat the soup, but I do not recommend this at all!  The tortellini does soak up a lot of the broth, but it is SOOO yummy that way!  I think that's why it tastes better the next day, because all the flavor has soaked into the tortellini!  So leave it in!

GREAT recipe! So yummy! I followed the cooking instructions directly but I did make some changes to the ingredients (based on what I had and what I had read in other reviews) But I think it turned out really well! Sub. 1.5 lbs. mild Italian sausage), 6 cups of beef broth, one cup frozen chopped spinach to replace zucchini, no water, a bigger package of frozen cheese tortellini, 1.5 cans of diced tomatoes (DONT drain!) instead of fresh tomatoes. I read that the soup can become more of a stew because the tortellini soaks up the juice so I tried to add a bit more liquid to see if I could truly make it a “soup”. It still turned out to be more of a thick stew instead of a soup but we didn’t care; it smelled delicious while we were cooking it and it tasted AMAZING! Tasted just as good for leftovers the next day :)

This is my favorite soup! I make this every few weeks at least. I add 4-5 cups of spinach with the zucchini, and use 6 cups of broth AND the 1/2 cup of water and wine. My whole family loves this.

This is a great hearty soup to make especially on a winter cold day or any dayI have made this soup about a dozen times in the past year and everyone has loved it. Besides the carrots and zucchini, I added sliced Baby Bellas to the soup the at the same time the wine, broth, basil, oregano, etc. were added at the being.  I also increased the red wine and extra serving amount every time I make this soup.  Great Recipe!!!

I followed the ingredients of the recipe but I have a chopper for the veggies so no thin slicing anything. I did add pepper about 1 1/2 tsp. Awesome recipe and I will definitely be making it again.

We enjoyed this soup! I will make it again. I made this soup following the recipe. This is what I did to make it my own. I added more beef broth to equal 7 cups. I added beef marrow bones for extra flavor. I used canned tomatoes because that's all I had. I used dried cheese tortellini that I cooked separately according to the package directions. The result was delicious!

My wife and I absolutely love this soup.  The first time I made it we only had hot Italian sausage - burning lips hot - but we couldn't get enough of it.  The second time I used mild Italian sausage with the same great taste.  The best soup I have had in a long time.

Big hit! Next time I'll try with canned tomotoes instead because peeling and seeding fresh just isn't my thing. I'm a lazy cook, admittedly. Very yummy!!!

I have made this several times with no alterations and each time it was a hit. I have never had so many ask me for the recipe.   It does make a lot though.  I suppose it  would be 8 servings if that is the only  dish being served.

Made this recipe according to the directions. The ratings from my husband (a version of the soup nazi from the Seinfeld shows) were: very tasty, substantial, and make this for our kids when they are home for Christmas. We are looking forward to the leftovers tomorrow because many have said the soup is better the next day.

My husband loved this recipe and I did too! I put spicy Italian sausage and it came out delicious and was not spicy at all. I also added some celery because my husband loves his veggies. I served it with toasted garlic bread!

I have made the soup quite often and both my husband and I love it. I switch up the sausage and use sweet, mild and hot. Sometimes just one of those or sometimes 2 or all three. I do use canned tomatoes usually the fire roasted diced. And I use reduced-sodium beef broth so it's not too salty.

I made several changes only because I didn’t have everything that the recipe called for, and this recipe still was awesome.  Can’t wait to get the items and make this as written.

This is a great soup and very different from any I have ever made before.  I was a little hesitant to try it only because I usually do not care for tomato based soups, but this one is wonderful!  My store was out of zucchin so I added a handful of fresh spinach with the tortellini instead and the only other change was I used dried basil because again, did not have fresh.  Next time I will make sure I have both, but this soup is super yummy and there will definitely be a next time.  It does make a lot for 2 people and when I did was add the pasta into it so it would be flavored, but then when I was putting it away I took the tortellini out of the soup and stored them separately and then always added some back into each bowl before re-heating in the microwave.  We had a nice dinner and quite a few lunches.  Re-warms in the microwave beautifully.  Just a great, great soup and I will be making this often!  Thanks!

I have since made it several times with the zucchini and fresh basil and have also cut the recipe in 1/2 and its a really favorite of ours!  Thanks again!

Best soup ever! i have made it many times following the exact recipe, it is amazing! I do keep the tortellini out of the soup and serve it into the individual bowls to prevent them from expanding and opening. Delicious!

I made it exactly as described but used dried basil in a lesser quantity as I did not have fresh.  It was very good.  Little tip:  if you let sausage come to room temperature before cooking it will crumble much easier.

This soup was delicious. My husband and I are not fond of oregano so I will either reduce the amount or leave it out altogether when I make it again. My husband is Italian and he had a full second helping so I am very pleased with the results. I served the soup with a warm baguettini (half-size baguette).

Delicious. Thick and hearty soup. Used one can fire roasted tomatoes instead of fresh and substituted half bottle of dark stout beer instead of red wire. Great flavor and stew like consistency.

I made this as written using unsalted beef broth and then adding salt to taste. It was very good and I'll definetly make it again. I would however recommend adding more beef broth or some water.

This was very good and filling.  I used 2 cans of  diced tomatoes, drained instead of fresh tomatoes.  I also added 1 portabella mushroom sliced, and a small yellow squash along with the zucchini.  We like veggies, so I also added more carrots.  I will definitely make this again!

This Italian sausage soup is scrumptious!!!  However I did make some changes. I omitted 1/2 cup water and the red wine and 4 large tomatoes.  In place of these, I added 2 cans (15 oz each) of Italian. Stewed tomatoes. Worked just as well. I also omitted the zucchini and used a handful of frozen peas instead?? Yum!!!!

Delicious ,hearty, full of vegetables soup. Used fresh  San Marzano tomatoes  ,along with zucchini, onions,carrots ,swiss chard from the garden.
Beef broth and tomato sauce are key. lots of fresh herbs,oregano,parsley,thyme,italian seasonings. 
Tortellini pasta pillow were beef. I will try cheese next.
Rich,yummy,filling soup. Will make for my friend this weekend using  Italian turkey sausage. Great for Thanksgiving weekend.

Very good!!! I used spicy sausage and petite diced tomatoes as per previous reviews; no other changes. Made for an easy meal served with French baguette. Will definitely make it again!

The only change I made was to add two tomatoes and one can of petite diced tomatoes instead of the four tomatoes, and I left out the water..  it was terrific.   Very hearty. The perfect dinner for a cool autumn night!

We have made this a few times. Made it last night for a family/friend gathering. It's delicious and the soup pot was dry by the end of the night. I used one whole onion cause I like onion. Also used bulk Italian sausage in a package instead of links that you have to remove the casings from. That was a lot easier.

This was nice although to be honest, I liked it much better the next day! I used fresh herbs and a can of Rotel which gave it a kick. First day when we had it for dinner with fresh baked biscuits, I thought, meh, it was ok. BUT, each day it got better and better! Gave some to my neighbor, she added sour cream and LOVED it! So YES, I would make it again. Tip though, definitely don't add too many tortellini- you can always add more later and when you make it for the first time, just undercook the pasta and shut stove off and let it finish. Hope this helps?

Super delicious!  I used canned tomatoes &  I didn't have any fresh herbs so I used dried. Didn't add any extra water. So many people said it was better the next day that I made it the night before while I was cooking dinner, and it was very delicious the next night!  I didn't add the pasta until we were going to be eating it, and per other suggestions only put in as much pasta as we would actually eat for that meal. A+

I stuck to the recipe. I did not have fresh tomatoes so I used whole canned plum tomatoes and it turned out great! This will stay in my dinner time round up.

I make this soup every year for my coworkers. It reminds me of the time I lived in Verona, Italy.  The flavors send me to the scuola primaria where I worked.

The recipe looks good as is, however I wanted a rich stock/ broth base. To create that,  I browned marrow bones and added onion, celery and carrots and T. Tomato paste. . Added box stock. Cooked it for a couple hours and then strained into pot before I began.  I also added carrot and celery and bell pepper to the soup. Again, not necessary but added nutritional value.

Amazing! It turned out even better than I thought! 

This was my first time making it, so I followed the recipe exactly (except I used hot Italian sausage since that's all they had.. and we like spicy) so I could give an accurate review. It was delicious, but took far longer than indicated. I am going to cheat next time and use canned diced tomatoes and see if there's a significant difference.

I followed the advice of many other reviewers. I made the tortellini separately as needed. It tasted great, so unless you're going to eat it all in one meal I would recommend doing the same. The pasta will absorb the liquid while stored in the fridge otherwise.

This is an excellent soup!  I wanted to make more so I doubled the recipe.  I used canned peeled tomatoes (Nina brand) and cut them up and I used two cans crashed tomatoes and two cans of tomato sauce.  It's a must to use the fresh basil!  I also added a little brown sugar to cut the acidity of the tomatoes.

I am on the second batch in three days.  Teenage boys and husband loved it!  We don't eat zucchini so I substituted fresh baby spinach.  Perfect.  I used the only red wine I had around, a Chilean "red wine".  I don't think it matters which wine you use.  Also, I used fresh oregano and fresh thyme and no parsley. I highly recommend you add diced celery to the onion and garlic sauce.   I'm convinced you can tweak this recipe however you like.  Enjoy!

This soup is delicious, and it makes your house smell wonderful while it cooks.  I highly recommend it.  It's become a go to recipe in our family.  It has great flavor, and is a meal of itself.  It's hearty but yet not heavy.

Hands down the best soup I've ever had!  I read the reviews and used "no salt added" broth and tomato sauce. I didn't have parmesan cheese so I used a pizza blend on top of each bowl and loved it!

I made this for the first time last night, and everyone LOVED it. I made the following changes:  doubled the garlic; used half of a small yellow onion; one leek; used one teaspoon of dried oregano; one teaspoon of red pepper flakes for a kick; one dried bay leaf; mild Italian sausage; tortellini with sweet Italian sausage; and two 14.5 oz cans of fire roasted tomatoes (strained), in lieu of the four whole fresh tomatoes. I added the fresh basil during the last ten minutes of cooking (when I added the tortellini). Finally, I just added a pinch of kosher salt during the last 20 minutes. It was fabulous!

I used hot Italian sausage and instead of tomato sauce I added leftover marinara.There wasn't a great deal of grease from the sausage I used so I didn't drain it-nothing to drain.I also added fresh chopped spinach to it at the same time as I added the parsley.I used canned petite diced tomatoes and didn't drain them because the marinara was thick.The results were heavenly. I think this is the best soup I've ever had--and I'm a real soup fan.

Delicious! I used hot Italian turkey sausage and hot rotel tomatoes instead of fresh tomatoes, it was spicy but awesome.

This turned out fantastic!  Made it exactly like the recipe calls for, with one exception.  I cooked the tortellini separate because I only wanted to cook as much as we would eat, as the soup is very plentiful and I knew we would have leftovers.  I used a relatively inexpensive bottle of 'Red Table Wine' which actually wasn't terrible on its own.  you could make this without wine, however, I think it really rounded out the flavor profile of the broth.   I also used low sodium broth and didn't add any salt to the soup.  It was plenty flavorful without any additional salt.   Even my picky 13 year old son gobbled this up, and he doesn't even like zucchini.   I will be making this again.  Thanks!

Loved the recipe, I actually subbed out the sweet sausage for hot and it kicked it up a notch...also using pre-cooked tortellini is a huge advantage.  Loved the leftovers too...

I made this for the first time this week. It was delicious. The only think I did differently was use a 28 oz can of chopped tomatoes instead of fresh and 8 oz of small bow tie noodles instead of tortellini.

This recipe was sooooo yummy!  I made it for my ladie's Bunco group.  I had planned on doubling the recipe but I actually doubled all the ingredients and did 2.5x for the beef broth/tomato sauce/wine.  I used a low sodium beef broth and eliminated the water.  I used Roma tomatoes and put an "x" on top of them, threw them in a pot of hot water for about a minute, then easily peeled them and scooped out the seeds.  I used some fresh cheese tortellini that I got from Costco.  I let the soup cook about 5 hours before adding the zucchini and parsley.  I added the pasta about 20 min before serving.  I topped the soup with some fresh shaved parmesan and served with some garlic bread.  It was a huge hit!!  I think the key is- using a good quality beef broth or stock and a good quality tortellini + fresh tomatoes- it makes a huge difference.

I've made this twice, both times a complete and happy success. I did add more veggies than called for, and also double the tomato sauce. The first time I added cabbage and corn.  The second time just more zucchini and carrots. There were no leftovers.

Fabulous, the whole family loved it.  I made the sausage into balls using a wooden spoon and they held their shape.  I only used two tomatoes and think I will use diced tomatoes next time.  I add some garlic powder midway for more flavour but it was amazing!!

Very good.. I did use chicken stock (unsalted) vs the beef broth I used diced canned tomatoes Italian style. I used the pesto instead of the basil and Italian seasoning instead of the oregano because that is what I had and I used 3 cheese tortellini (burtoli) VERY Good..will make again..after cooking together remove the pasta from the soup and store in the fridge separately..or you won't have any liquid left the next day I also used yellow squash instead of zucchini and added a can of white beans

I had to omit a few things since I didn't have them on hand..  I made without sausages, zucchini.  I used the meat filled totellini and that actually worked as sausages in a way.  Added some chopped celery and accidentally used crashed tomatoes instead of tomato sauce.  Used a can of diced tomato with garlic and onion instead of fresh tomatoes.  With all these substitutions, the soup tasted great!  I can't wait to try the ORIGINAL recipe!

My new favorite soup! I used a FRESH 4 cheese tortellini (in the refrigerated section). Made the recipe exactly as dictated. Perfect! If using fresh tortellini, don't add until you take the soup off the heat.

I absolutely love this soup.  I've made it so many times since it is so satisfying.
Some changes and suggestions:
1.  Use plum tomatoes so you don't have to peal or seed.
2.  I usually leave the zucchini out and double the carrots
3.  To make this low fat and reduce the oil to skim (to nothing!), I use hot Italian turkey sausage.  Reduces the calories and taste is identical
4.  Add more broth (I usually go with 6 cups)
5.  Add the tortellini only to what you are serving/reheating.  They will bloat if they are stored in the soup.

Instead of Plain Sausage I used Hot Sausage. The Tortellini iIhad to use Frozen I used with meat, I feel the fresh Tortellini would of made it that much better. A good loaf of Italian Bread, would of pushed this out of site. Great

I already had mini meatballs made,  so instead of starting by cooking sausage I just used leftover bacon fat to sauté the onions and garlic, and added red pepper. . The flavour of the broth is so deep, our guests loved it and I will definitely make it again!

I made this soup in large quantity for our Church's Old Fashioned Christmas....I used rolls of breakfast sausage, didn't have wine so used more broth, and used canned tomatoes instead of  fresh....It was a hit and gone in a flash!  will definitely make again!

Absolutely wonderful soup!!  Very close to the one made by our favorite steakhouse.  I used a can of diced tomatoes as that was what I had and no tortellini because I didn't have any. Other than that followed the directions.  This soup was fantastic.  Served with some focaccia I made from Allrecipes.  Thank you for submitting this recipe.

It was delicious. I made it with a very rich beef broth and cooked the tortellini separately so that the soup didn't become mushy. To serve, folks put the amount of tortellini they wanted in the bottom of a  bowl and then topped it of with the soup.

I don't like to rate recipes I've changed, but this recipe is "tweakable".  I didn't have fresh tomatoes, so I used a can of diced tomatoes (then omitted the sauce).  I used all beef broth (no wine on hand) and used 6 cups.  Instead of zucchini (because I knew my kids wouldn't eat it), I added a cup of chopped spinach.  I put in 16 ozs dried tortellini which then required an additional cup or so of broth or water.  Really good soup!

Really good but the broth got soaked up after sitting in the fridge overnight and turned into more of a pasta dish. Still really really good and not sure if I would change it next time around despite that!

I have made this many times.  At first, I made it as written, which is 5 stars.  Now, I have realized that it really can be a simple, fast weeknight meal.  1) Use a 25-32 ounce jar of your favorite pasta sauce instead of the tomatoes.  2) No need for the two 30-minute simmering.  Just simmer uncovered until the carrots are tender, then add the tortellini.  I often leave out the zucchini if I don't have it.

This was a definitely a hit with my wife and I.  Some notes to consider:
Use a high quality tortellini.  I used store brand 1x and it did not turn out nearly as good.
Leftovers get mushy (tortellini & zucchini mainly) pretty quickly.  Best eaten fresh, ok next day.
Red wine vinegar works if you don't have red wine available.

This smells awesome while cooking and tastes even better!  Just swapped out veggie rotini for the tortellini and used chicken sausage to cut down the fat to help keep it diet friendly.  I always use fresh herbs and home grown/nearby farm produce when available.  Family and friends love it too!

Delicious soup! Only changes I made was I used V8 in place of tomato sauce and added some fresh bell peppers from my garden. Good recipe to use up your veggie overload from your garden.

MOTO BENE!!!

I used all the vegies my garden and my homemade sweet Italian sausage and it was a great soup.
The sausage has little fat so I used olive oil to sauté the onion and garlic.
I will make this for my grandchildren

This soup is so delicious! The flavors are off the chart and it is healthy meal for the whole family. I have made this 2 weekends in a row because it is so good. I followed the recipe exactly. Don't skip the parmesan cheese on top, it really makes the whole meal.

I've made several times now.  Delicious.  When possible, I add the tortellini with each serving so leftovers are not stored with the tortellini in the soup, as other reviewers have suggested.  I use hot Italian sausage.  The flavor is deep and rich.

This is my favorite soup.  I've made it many many times.  I always add more beef broth than the recipe calls for.  You can also add as many veggies as you want to this soup.  Just play around with it and add your favorites.  You'll love it and you won't be disappointed.  5 well earned stars!

This was amazing! I modified based on time and ingredients, and cooked in a crock pot. I used leftover frozen onions and green beans and diced jalapeños, can mushrooms, fresh sliced carrots, some minced garlic, two jugs beef broth, can tomato sauce, large can crushed tomatoes, tablespoon each dried basil and oregano. Added lots of salt and pepper. I seared mild Italian sausage links and tossed in crock pot. Took 5 minutes the night before. Cooked on low while at work next day. Took out sausages, sliced up and back in crock pot with frozen cheese tortellini. Cooked another hour or so. Served with mozzarella cheese! This was fabulous!!

Great new way to use my favorite Italian sausage!  I did change it a bit by using both sweet and hot sausage, so it added a bit of spice to the soup.  Also, since my husband does not like zucchini, I substituted some fresh baby spinach.  Loved it!  Served with a nice Italian salad- this will definitely be added to our monthly menu.

Excellent soup.  The red wine add complexity to the flavor that is amazing. also, I didn't have parsley last time, so i added celery, leqves and all, as well as 1/2 cup lentils as my husband loves those... and mushrooms, because, why not? We've made it several times now. you can also top it with parmesean

I had a taste for some soup with a tomato base and something other than beef or chicken as the protein, not too heavy and flavorful. This soup hit all of the boxes! I froze some of it and it was still awesome. My husband and kids loved it. I can't wait to make it again. I paired it with a salad and rustic bread and it was perfect!

I made a vegetarian version of this soup. I used vegetarian broth and a tofu sausage that crumbles nicely. It was a big hit at our weekly family get together. Served with rustic multigrain bread and fresh farm butter, it made a satisfying meal in a bowl. It's a keeper!

I saved a little time by chopping the carrots fairly fine in the blender and instead of simmering for the first 3o minutes, I just cooked for about 10 minutes, skimmed the fat, and then added the zucchini then simmered another 30 minutes.

This ran in Allrecipes magazine, and it's hearty and perfect for a cold night, AND it's a good way to work in your veggies :-) I portioned out the base into serving sizes and froze, then added the tortellini when I was reheating.

This was AWESOME! My husband who isn't overly fond of leftovers was more than willing to have this again the next day.  I didn't have all of the ingredients listed when I made this, but it didn't matter, it was perfect; didn't have any tortellini, so I cooked some noodles on the side to add into our bowls (appreciated someone's review that the tortellini absorbed soup), but we both really liked it without any pasta. so tasty, this one will be a staple!  Thank you!

This was actually good, but I need to perfect it more next time. I used more beef broth in lieu of the pasta soaking up too much, added a whole can of water, little more than 1/2 cup red wine, one can of tomato sauce, one 28 oz roasted tomatoes, one can vegetable broth, 2 cans of low salt corn, celery, green pepper, and a lot of onion. I seasoned with garlic powder, italian seasoning, red pepper flakes, and oregano. I added sausage and cheese stuffed tortellini toward the end, and added 4 cheese fat free Italian cheese on top. Turned out a little too "tomatoey" for my taste. Garlic toast was great as a side. Next time I will add more meat and vegetables and not so much tomatoes.

One of my all time favorite soup recipes. I feed this to my bestest of friends and they are thrilled. I usually make it as written, but do at times make it without sausage, adding fennel seed and oregano to make up for the seasonings left out with the sausage.

Family enjoyed this soup.  Didn't have any zucchini so we used frozen spinach.  Tasted great.  I would have added an additional cup of beef broth as the soup thickens a bit when the tortellini is added.  This one is a keeper.

Wow, this soup is AMAZING. I followed every step. Although, I  did not have fresh tomatoes so I used 2 cans of diced tomatoes. It tasted just fine. I added a couple more seasonings myself, smoked paprika ( I love that on everything) Ital seasonings.. I had some Artisan Bread to dip in my juice! I recommend and will definitely be making this again! =]

I really liked this and it makes a hearty meal.  I added a little more broth and a 12 oz bag of frozen tortellini and canned petite diced tomatoes rather than fresh and it worked out great.  A little bland so a little read pepper flakes would not hurt.

I made this exactly as the recipe called. I thought it was really good and would have given it another 1/2 star if I knew how! Lol, next time I may add a little cream or 1/2&1/2 to reduce the acidity a bit. Still a winner though.

Delicious soup!! I used hot sausage to spice it up and 6 cups of beef broth based on some of the reviews. I saved extra broth from the carton and added it to the leftover soup to thin it out a little bit the next day. We also like spinach so I added about 5oz fresh spinach (stems removed) along with the tortellini. Will definitely make this soup again!!

Made exactly according to recipe - and it was excellent!  Used fresh tortellini stuffed with cheese.  Sprinkled with fresh Parmesan just before serving with a side of crusty garlic baguette.  Hubby doesn't usually like soup and I don't usually like Italian-style soups but this was great!  Filling and satisfying meal.

I'm not a soup person but I tried this anyway and it was sooo yummy! I used spicy sausage (Jimmy dean) and added a can of diced tomatoes because I only had a few small fresh ones. Makes me love soup and my 6 year old are it too!

I've made this several times. It's one of my favorites. I've used caned tomatoes instead of fresh. That works just as good. I like tomatoes a lot, so I double the tomato sauce. I've also used several different kinds of pasta. Last night I used farfalle. I cook the pasta separately and add it at serving time. That way it doesn't get so mushy.

Made this according to the original ingredients and it's very tasty. Not sure if I like the tortellini so much. Next time will probably use a noodle like penne or rotini, but will definitely be making again!

Yes, I made changes to the recipe. I used diced tomatoes with no salt added and spinach. My family loved the soup. I will be making this again and again. I did not add any salt only  ground pepper. I did use frozen tortellini.

I made this soup and it is full flavoured. I used a small can of tomato paste instead of the pasta sauce and added more wine!   I used cherry tomatoes I had on hand. I think I would purée them next time before adding to soup. Overall, a great success.

This is probably a great recipe. I do make this soup without a recipe though. I brown sausage meat and food process it- remove it to a bowl, saute onion and garlic and add wine and cook a little. I use Lipton onion soup mix and heat it but add extra water. If I use a large amount of sausage I sometimes use extra onion soup mix. I simmer the cooked ground  sausage onion and garlic. Later add chopped can tomatoes with juice and cook it some more. I later add plenty of spinach and cook to ready. If I do not have fresh shinach I use chopped frozen, defrosted spinach drained.   I have also made rice to add to individual bowls and top with thin slices of mozzarella cheese. I am adding in some corn this time also. I did make up my recipe myself and am glad to find one similar to mine. If I make a large pot and want to freeze some I do it before the spinach, rice and cheese.

My husband gave this recipe rave reviews. I followed the recipe as is, except after browning sausage, I put everything into the crockpot and let it cook on high for 4 hours. I through in the pasta in the last 10 minutes and it was perfect.

Very good recipe and easy to modify. I used canned tomatoes (diced or crushed approx 28 ounces) and kept the rest the same. Served it over the tortellini instead of mixing the pasta in with the soup. So yummy!

My rating pertains to the soup made as directed. It is good however, we found that for our personal tastes, making it again with some additional garlic and dried Italian herbs made it more delicious. That little bump in taste made it perfect for us.

Everyone loves it... Thank you so much for sharing the recipe!

So delicious! I served this for my book club last night and everyone loved it.  Because it's December, canned diced tomatoes and basil from a squeeze tube were good substitutes for fresh. Really good with warm sour dough bread and butter.

good soup. Used white wine (that's what i had on hand). Skipped the pasta. used a can of chick peas instead. Added escarole. A little extra garlic. Changes made due to what i had on hand and personal preferences. Very good soup.

Delicious recipe. Fun to make, smells awesome as its cooking. Family loved it, will surely make this again. The soup is very hearty, served it as a main dish with some bread on the side. Mmmmmm. Great for a cold day or when you just want good soup.

My husband really loved this.  I definitely like it, but I made it with hot Italian sausage (which I use in my spaghetti sauce) and it was too hot for me.   Otherwise, it's a great recipe for a chilly night.  i only used 4 cups of beef broth and doubled the wine and water.  Served it with warm whole-wheat bread.  I'll try it with 1/2 lb hot and 1/2 lb regular sausage next time.

I have made this soup for large amounts of people.  Served with a side salad and fresh Italian bread it becomes a awesome meal on a cold winters day. 
I usually follow the recipe, and always use fresh organic ingredients.  I also always buy my sausage fresh from the butcher.   
Depending on who I am feeding it to I will vary it from sweet or mild sausage.  Never hot otherwise it just over powers the other ingredients.  
Thank you so much!

Absouletly amazing soup. The only change id make is next time use half the tortellini as i found it was too much and took away from the yummy broth.

This soup has great flavor, I was hesitant about the wine but it was good. I went with a lighter flavored wine and used a pino noir. I also added squash and used cheese stuffed tortellini. It was a huge hit. Next time I will use spicy sausage instead of mild, the flavor was diluted out a little.

Was wonderful! I probably added more oregano and basil. Also added some chili flakes (only a little) for some extra spice. I also simmered the first part almost an hour and then let it cool a bit to draw more of the flavors out. Other than that followed the recipe and it was very popular in this house.

Made this soup. Was delicious. I made the tortellini in a separate pot. As I don't like my noodles getting mushy the next day. Other than that I made it to recipe.

The only thing I did different was adding spinach. It's my daughter's favorite soup. So every time she visits from the Pacific Northwest I have to make it for her. We love this soup so much I double the recipe so we can feast on it while she's here in Maryland.

This is our family's favorite soup for a crowd (or the freezer!) with a few minor changes:  I increase amounts of Italian sausage to 1.5 lbs, double the amount of fresh garlic to 4 cloves, substitute a large can of quality crushed tomatoes, add 4 - 6 handfuls of fresh washed baby spinach (stemmed), a chopped bell pepper, 1/2 cup fresh chopped basil and fresh chopped Italian flat leaf parsley.  This soup is best if made early in the morning, simmered for 1 hour and rested all day to blend flavours.  Reheat and add tortellini last 20 minutes. Top each serving with additional fresh herbs and fresh grated or sliced parmesan.  Crusty  sourdough is our usual bread, but I like another reviewer's suggestion to try the foccacia bread recipe from this site and will try it with this soup tomorrow!

Super easy and AWESOME. Only thing I did differently was added spinach and green pepper, used canned diced tomatoes rather than fresh, and kept the tortellini separate and added to individual servings. I would add more stars if I could, will be making this again soon.

I have made this soup several times and it is always a hit.  I use hot Italian sausage to give it more spice.  I only use a 28  ounce can of diced tomatoes instead of fresh tomatoes and tomato sauce, and I skip the red wine.

I used mild Italian sausage because I picked up the wrong kind.  It was still delicious.  Also, I didn't use fresh parsley, just dry.  Flavor of the soup was amazing, definitely making over and over again!

It has become a family favorite and one of my signature dishes. I altered the recur slightly to make it my "own" and add in some fresh herbs and thicken it with roux to make it a stew instead of a soup.

One of my new favorites! I've made it twice and made a couple of changes each time based on what I had on hand. Delicious both times. Thank you for sharing the recipe.

I tweaked this soup a bit to use what I had on hand. I only used ½ a pound of sausage because I had sausage filled tortellini. I had to use dried basil and parsley, and I substituted peas for the zucchini. Otherwise made as directed and this was great. Very simple and hearty. Wonderful for chilly Fall days.

This recipe is so good!!! My family loved it!! The only thing I changed is that I used canned diced tomatoes, dried herbs, and added more tortellini (prob about 12 oz). I cooked the tortellini seperately as advised by other reviewers. I will definitely be making this again!!!

My family asks for this everytime I say "lets make soup!"  Hearty and very tasty.  Perfect just as the recipe states.
My son brought a big batch to work one day and all the co-workers raved!

Yummy!!  I love making soups because you can always play around and alter the ingredients to your taste or to what you have on hand.  I followed this recipe, except I used a can of whole San Marzano tomatoes (then I crushed them), omitted the tomato sauce, used 32 oz of beef broth and 1 cup of wine, and I used Italian dried herbs instead of fresh basil and oregano.  I used hot chicken sausage to save on some calories.  Overall a very hearty soup that even my husband liked!

This was to DIE for. The only changes I made was...I used a large can of crushed tomatoes, added fresh baby spinach, a green pepper, and bullion instead of broth. Used a Merlot wine. I also doubled the amount of tortellini.

This soup is definitely on my favorites list! It has such a wonderful full flavor! I am looking forward to making it when the weather turns cold! The only thing I did different was use diced canned tomatoes as I did not have fresh, but still fantastic!! Thank you for sharing!!

I've been making this recipe for many years.  Original recipe in little booklet published by Pillsbury in 1985!  I've also substituted chicken or turkey sausage (mix reg & spicy), white wine, and chicken broth instead of reg sausage, red wine, and beef broth.  Love it both ways ... always double recipe and freeze.

Used andouille sausage instead of Italian sausage.  Added a package of frozen mixed veges, a can of tomato paste, a can of diced tomatoes and a two tablespoons packed with fresh parsley. Eliminated the can of tomato sauce and the wine.  It's a five star in my family!

Momma Mia this was delicious. I followed the directions except used fresh tomatoes from my garden. I seeded but did not peel them. You could use an extra cup of broth with no problem. This is an excellent recipe. Thanks for sharing.

This soup as made the list of one of my FAVORITE soups!! it's absolutely delicious, hearty, filling, easy, and quick to make. I did add a few extra veggies.,and served it with a rustic garlic crusted Italian  bread. I used Marsala cooking wine because that's what I had available. I also added 1 chopped celery stalk, 1/2 of green Bell pepper cut into big chuncks, 1 package of fresh baby spinach, can of diced Italian tomatoes and 1 small fresh tomato, I also used tomato paste instead of the sauce for a more thicker broth. Deliciousyo!!

Love this soup/ I made it whole 30 friendly by remitting the red wine, using " zoodles" instead of tortellini (zucchini noodles put through a spiralizer) and made my own Italian sausage

Delicious and a big hit with visitors. I made two small changes, I added a teaspoon of crushed reds to make it spicy and I used two cups of broth from previous night's pot roast plus 3 cups of water, instead of standard beef broth. I have also tried it with lean ground turkey instead of pork and it works just as well with much lower calories!

Surprised it was so wonderful.  I'm not a fan of Zuppa Toscana but my wife loves it so I thought I'd give this a try!  Very, very good.

This recipe was quite delicious.  I used a mix of hot and mild sausage to give the dish a little more heat and I also added some kale in order to make it a little more nutritious.  It was a huge hit with my husband and I so I will be making again in the near future.

Excellent soup, easy my whole family and friends love it.  I add fresh spinach if I have it.  I use noodles instead of tortellini.

I made this soup as is the first time and it was excellent! I used what I had on hand this time. Ground turkey in place of the sausage, one whole onion, 4 minced cloves of garlic, 6 cups of beef broth (no water, and I didn't have any wine) I used three small carrots, 3 dried bay leaves, italian seasoning, ground pepper, a bit of leftover tomato sauce, a large can of diced tomatoes, and a can of low sodium tomato soup. Oh, and some parsley, more than the 3 tbsp. I'm going to simmer it on low all day in my crock pot, and add tortellini towards the end. Thanks for a great recipe!

I loved this recipe. Perfectly balanced Italian soup. I couldn't find tortellini in Australia so I changed it out with ditali. It was so tasty I ate it for breakfast the next morning!

Wow, truly the best soup I have ever made. Did not have to tweak the recipe at all - except that I put in "a little too much" of everything...!  We'll be enjoying this all week.

Made this for our church soup supper and it was a hit!! I got many compliments and requests for the recipe. The only change I made was to use mild Italian sausage instead of sweet Italian sausage.

I used loose sweet sausage and did not have an issue with this being too salty.  I also added the tortellini as I needed.  I great change from the "regular" soup flavors.

Hb really liked this. Followed it pretty much to a t- used a whole small onion, 3 medium carrots, closer to 2 cups zucchini, pesto tortellini instead of regular, a little more than 1/4 cup each Basil and parsley and a tbsp of red wine vinegar bc I had no wine.

A very hearty soup. Personally it was too much for me as far as thickness and intense sausage flavor. However this is restaurant quality. I used rotel tomatoes.

Very good thick soup/stew recipe.  I substituted low salt vegetable broth and 28oz can low salt organic tomatoes and it was not salty at all.  If you want it more soup like, I suggest adding more broth/water.  I added it to my recipe box because this is a keeper.

This was awesome, especially the next day! I used 2 cans of Italian diced tomatoes, 1 T of tomato paste, a can of drained great northern beans, more garlic and basil, chili pepper flakes and bell peppers.

I'm in the process of sending this to a friend!  Good Job!!!

We loved the soup but it needed salt and pepper.  I used canned diced tomatoes with garlic, basil and oregano in them since it is winter and the fresh tomatoes leave a lot to be desired.  I also used dried basil and parsley.  Added to my list of favorites!  Can't wait to have for lunch today.

Awesome.. Did not have tomato sauce, so i used spaghetti sauce from a jar I had opened two nights ago. I would do the same.  Neither had whole tomatos  so I used organic diced which was just fine.  I also did not  use the tortellini but an Italian small pasta.  Frozen mixed veggies worked great. Fresh bread and a great meal.

Amazing!  This was the second time I made soup and it turned out great.  Perfect for a main meal.  The flavours are wonderful and it's packed with vegetables.  I modified slightly, using fresh Roma tomatoes and used yellow and green zucchini.  My soup used in salt and it didn't need it.  A great soup to make  for a novice like myself.  Enjoy!

I am making this soup for the second time - so good!  I'm using canned diced tomatoes instead of fresh, and a cup of 4-cheese spaghetti sauce instead of tomato sauce.  OMG!  This is so good.  Also using mild Italian sausage instead of sweet - maybe they are the same but here it's sold as mild.  This is definitely a keeper in our house.  - Sue

quadrupled the recipe and served it at a church social.  Many compliments! The pot was empty.  I will be making this again.  Be careful with the pasta though, as it acts like a sponge and absorbs all the broth.  I used mini bow-tie (mini farfalle) pasta instead of tortellinii to save $. Next time, I will bring the cooked pasta lightly tossed with olive oil and add it to the soup right before serving.  Wondrful soup!

Very good recipe - easy to make and very flavorful.  Not a 5-star recipe but a solid 4.  The only change we made was by substituting the water for additional beef broth.

I made this last night and it is sooo good - used half Italian sausage and half Italian chicken sausage - used fresh tomatoes that I had frozen this summer - will definitely be making again this winter! (Two days later, we had leftovers and I had some leftover cooked red potatoes so I cut them into fourths and put in the soup - yum!)

Family favorite. We make it at least once a month, and I usually use some chicken breast along with sausage -- absolutely delicious!  Thank you!

This was so good!  I really wasn't expecting a lot from it because I rarely cook tortellini and I used canned peeled tomatoes. (Since they're not in season I didn't worry about sacrificing the fresh for canned.  I also didn't add the zucchini.)  I purchased ground sausage instead of having to remove the casings, I used dried herbs for the fresh...  Anything to make this easier.  Like I said, I wasn't expecting a lot.  But Wow!  What a surprise.  Everyone loved it and went back for seconds.  Definitely a do over.  I served it with Italian bread.  I may consider adding spinach next time but that's just a thought.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

**UPDATE:  I added almost an entire bag of spinach.  Yum!!! Definitely a keeper.**

This was excellent!  I used spicy sausage instead of sweet sausage, but think either would work well.  I also added some mushrooms and leeks that I had and wanted to use up.  I did blanche roma tomatoes to get the skin off.

I used a little bit more than a pound of sausage, and if I did it again, I might use even more. So if you have more than a pound on hand, don't be afraid to use it all. Also, I personally prefer chopped baby carrots to sliced carrots in soup (more meaty carrot pieces). Other than that, this recipe is perfect.

A day or two after cooking this, you'll notice a lot of built up oil and fat from the sausage. This can be easily skimmed off because it builds at the top. Skimming the fat while the pot is cooking can be very difficult, but it is very easy later and really helps keep the soup smooth. The soup has plenty of flavor without it, so don't worry.

I came across this recipe today looking for something different on a cold rainy day and it is great. I made the recipe as written and all I can say is wow.
It is a very hearty soup. The only thing I did add was frozen chopped spinach and had a nice loaf of sun dried tomato bread to dip in in.

Really delicious!  My husband enjoyed it too!  I substituted a can of diced tomatoes instead of whole tomatoes (that's what I had in my pantry).  I didn't have fresh parsley or basil, so I omitted the parsley and used dried basil instead. It still turned out really good!  After reading a few reviews, I used more beef broth than what was called for, as I didn't want the tortellini to soak up all of the broth, especially if you have leftovers. The wine gives the soup an extra depth of flavor and richness! Top it off with fresh grated parmesan cheese before serving!!

Absolutely delicious!!! I'm giving 5 stars because the only two changes I made were small and per my family's tastes: smoked sausage instead of Italian and omitting the red wine.  I'm glad I doubled the recipe! Served with caprese salad and crusty bread for a wonderful, light meal! My only recommendation would be to adjust salt and pepper seasoning at the end because different sausages may be saltier than others.

This soup was absolutely delicious!! I used 3 cheese tortellini in it when I made it and also only used 3 tomatoes because I had purchased some quite large beef steak tomatoes. Prep was quite a bit of work for me, but I'm new to the cooking game.  I would definitely make this recipe again! Incredibly yummy! Next time I might use a broth with less sodium though.

Wow, this was really fantastic!  I only used  32 oz of Kitchen Basics brand Beef Stock.  I should have added another 2 cups because my soup seemed kind of chunky.  It needed more broth. I used fresh tomatoes, as the recipe called for.  I started it really early (around 2:30 pm).  Just let it simmer until dinner time.  The broth was to die for.  Reminded me of the sauce in Beef Bourginion. My advice, use a really good brand of beed broth/stock and do not leave the wine out.  It will not be the same.  It's such a dark and rich broth.  I will most definitely make this again.  You could also make this with kale instead of zucchini.  I might even like that better.  I removed the casing from the sausage and then cut it in little bite sized pieces.

Excellent and quick and easy to make. I've made this several times. I add my onions to the sausage when the sausage is about 1/2 way cooked. I use a can of fire roasted tomatoes instead of fresh, and used low sodium beef broth (4 cups cause that's what I had) I used fresh oregano and skipped the basil since I didn't have any. And add water as needed, about 1 1/2 cups. I also added a handful of spinach. This is a versatile recipe, but I really think you need the beef not the chicken broth/ stock. Thanks for this awesome meal!

We really liked this recipe-definetly a keeper.  I used canned diced tomatoes and frozen tortelli for convenience and it was still terrific!

This was wonderful. I had Italian Sausage in the fridge and wasn't sure what to do with it. Rainy day and a few ingredients and this was SO good. Excellent recipe. Easy to follow.

Soup was okay but didn't have enough flavor in my opinion so I had to adjust seasonings. Used can tomatoes instead. Liked all the vegetables.

Wow! This soup was really delicious and easy. Made it "as is" except to cook the tortellini separately so that the next day's serving wouldn't have soggy pasta. I just put the tortellini in the bowls, then poured the soup over it. Served with Parmesan as suggested. My hubby gave it a definite "thumbs up".

Great recipe.  I added a can of kidney beans and left everything else exactly the same.  Served it up with garlic bread and it made a fantastic meal with some left for lunch tomorrow!

I made this per the recipe except I did use canned tomatoes and dried basil. For the tortellini I used the bonnet kind stuffed with roasted garlic, it was awesome.  Sent a batch to a sick neighbor and also to my parents.  They called to see if I had anymore.  By the way I doubled the recipe to have enough to go around.  Easy to fix and a keeper for sure.

Absolutely delicious! I used tri colored tortellini, put the tomatoes in the food processor and also used diced tomatoes and a little tomato paste. this made enough to have it two nights. My hubby loved it!

Amazing!!! And yes, Crystal S from review below is right. Only add the tortellini you plan on eating at each serving... other then that no changes needed. It was a success at my house, planning on making it again soon...

This soup was the perfect solution for a cold winter day!  Absolutely delicious. No changes except used canned tomatoes. Made tortellini separate and added per serving. Didn't really think it added to the soup so tried without tortellini and found it delightful. The soup is full bodied enough that pasta is not necessary.  I decided to leave out the carbs. Loved the aroma and flavor of all the fresh herbs!

I have made this twice in my crockpot.  It is very very good.  I use canned tomatoes instead of fresh.  As other reviews have suggested, I added the pasta about 15-20 minutes before serving.  I added some fresh spinach last time I made it to use up what I had on hand.  Great recipe to serve on chilly days.  Add a piece of garlic bread and you are set.

Great recipe.  It is really worth it to use fresh tomatoes instead of canned.  This recipe takes awhile, but it is worth it.  I usually save it for a Sunday since during the week it is hard to have enough time to come home and prepare it after work.

Very good.  I made some subs because of that I had on hand.  I think it would be better if you stuck to the main recipe which is why I gave it five start.  It really is excellent.

I didn't have fresh basil (hard to find in January, so I used dried basil and parsley.  Fresh herbs are ALWAYS better if you can get them!

I added and extra cup of broth because of some of the other reviews which I think was a good choice.

I didn't have zucchini so I just had the carrots and fresh tomato.  I would NOT used canned tomato in this recipe personally. But this was still good because there was a lot more broth and the flavor of the red wine and broth is DIVINE!

I used pesto tortellini. My husband LOVED that, but I think I would have liked cheese better. Though with the fresh basil pesto might go pretty well~

Overall, fantastic recipe.  Definitely a keeper!

I made this yesterday and it turned out super. I un-cased the sausage and put it into a mixing bowl. I used a stiff spatula to knead it for a couple of minutes. Somehow this makes is snappy. I made two 1/2 lb. 6 inch patties and seared them in an untreated skillet. Went back to the soup and had to add a little olive oil to sauté the onions and garlic. When I got to the point that I wanted to add the sausage the patties had cooled a little. I stacked them one on top of the other and cut them into bite sized pieces. I was amazed that they stayed together in spite of being rare inside. I added them to the soup and followed the directions. When the soup was done the bite sized pieces cooked up nicely in the simmering broth. I though it added a nice visual effect to the soup and I also like the snap when you bite into the pieces. Thanks Mary P for a great recipe and to the folks from Cook's Illustrated for bringing this method of treating pork sausage to my attention. Bon Appetite!

This was easy to make and turned out awesome! I only had a cheap red and took a chance using it, but it was fine and my husband loved the soup. I didn't have the tortellini, and used bow ties instead, but it was fine. Very nice flavor and great for a cold winter night.

Great recipe. I did not have fresh herbs so used dry and don't think I used enough,  I also used turkey sausage, half  hot and half sweet to cut calories and fat.  Next time I will used organic canned tomatoes and perhaps sub some other veggie other than squash, maybe kale since I have it growing in wine barrels in the back yard.  Smells delightful when cooking.

This recipe was so wonderful!!!  Made a few small changes - instead of wine since I can not have any I used cranberry/apple juice and there was no difference.  To save time I also used diced tomatoes and minced garlic from a jar. Otherwise everything else stayed the same.  When I have more time I will use everything fresh and see if there is a difference in the taste.  My husband loved this and it has been added into our recipe rotation.

OMG! This is great my first time making a homemade soup and what a way to start. My only down fall is I should have cut the recipe in half made a lot more than I expected. I did use roma tomatoes because this is not tomatoe season and the roma's looked a better nice and red. I used the technique one of the reviews gave for easy peeling. Thanks.  A keeper.

OMG!!! This soup is amazing!  I am stopping mid-bite to write my review.  The only changes I made were that I used spinach instead of zucchini, because hubby doesn't like zucchini.  I didn't have red wine, so I didn't use it, subbed water.  That's it, and it was/is AWESOME!

This recipe was Crazy Good!  My family has gone GF so I used  1 cup quinoa, replaced the basil with 1/2c. Pesto. I get my Italian sausage from a local butcher.  Yum! The butcher asked me for the recipe and it is now displayed at his store.

Another addition to our family favorites!  I used turkey sausage vs pork and per another reviewer a can and a half of diced tomatoes drained instead of fresh tomatoes. Served with focaccia bread and it really was a perfect meal.   Thanks Mary P!

Have to admit that I didn't follow it to a T (or is it tee?)...anyway, so I used what I had on hand.  One cup of chx broth in the fridge so I threw that in...and I had no beef broth so I used a cube of bouillon and a little pod of stock which I put into boiling water to make the beef broth needed.  I didn't have zucchini but wound up throwing in celery and red pepper.  I didn't have tortellini either but used anelli pasta instead. On top of that, I had no fresh herbs so I used dried.  Regardless, since I'd never made it before, I didn't know the difference and this tasted fantastic.  I put fresh grated parmigiano-reggiano on top with fresh parsley (I did have that)...and both my husband and I loved it.  I will gladly make again and again.

I used spicy sausage instead and it was amazing. Instead of tortellini, I had mini stuffed squash ravioli.
 My husband was hopping around waiting for it after taking a sip of the soup.
Baked a loaf of french bread and topped it with italian seasonings and salt. Amazing easy soup!!!

This soup is WONDERFUL! it's also very easy to make. I agree with Crystal about the tortellini. I put in all of mine and have to add more broth. Beside that, the recipe is perfect as it is

Very good, but, please don't thicken it with cornstarch!  Use some stale Italian bread,  Just delicious.  I also added kale.  Very much like a traditional Ribolitto.  Yummy!!

I added garbanzo beans and used chicken broth instead of beef. (To me, beef broth can be too strong in taste) And I don't like wine in my soup, so I skipped that too. I also used 1 1/2 tsp. of Italian seasoning in place of the Oregano. This is a very versatile and easy soup to make.

Just made this last night and WOW! Amazing!  We did change it up though- we used chicken Italian sausage and added diced green pepper and chopped celery (removed zucchini). We also used canned low sodium diced tomatos. I sauteed the vegies seperate from the sausage and added the spices to the vegies first - adds more flavor! Then I added to vegies to the meat and went on with the receipe from there. I did add more seasoning as it cooked and threw in a little onion powder & garlic powder toward the end. Also used cheese tortelini.

This is the best soup I have ever made.  I only modified it by adding a couple of handfuls of fresh baby spinach at the end of the cooking time as I am trying to get more veggies in my diet.  Otherwise, I pretty much made it as the recipe states and it is FABULOUS!!!

I've made this soup several times and loved this soup. I've only made couple of changes. I omitted the water and added more beef broth and red wine. I replaced tortellini with red skin potatoes, added spinach and added rio-tel tomato. It gave the soup a nice kick.

I love this soup and so does my husband. I made it to take to my parents' house on Christmas Eve (we always do soup, sandwiches, finger foods, and dessert) and everyone raved! The only thing I do differently is leave out the tortellini. I add small,tube pasta instead and serve the soup with grated mozzarella cheese on top.

Wonderful and filling. I followed the recipe with the exception of adding spinach and baby lima beans. I also gave a guick rince over the cooked sausage to drain some of the fat and salt. This recipes great, it'll be added 
to my favorites!

Had to substitute one thing: My daughter doesn't like chunks of tomato in anything, so I didn't add the tomatoes, but instead of the can of tomato sauce, I added 2 cans of tomato paste and 2 cups of water. I also chopped up 1-1/2 cups of kale and added it to the onions as they sauteed. I was concerned about the 1/2 cup of wine, because when I put it in the soup looked pink, but it cooked down. OMG - (with my replacements) this recipe is awesome.

A perfect hearty soup for a cold fall/winter night! Beyond the usual prep time, this is fairly easy to throw together.  It's also simple enough to sub ingredients or use up what you have on hand. I used 6-7 cups of water and added a combo of Better Than Bouillion beef and chicken bases. Used Johnsonville 1/2 pork 1/2 chicken sausage, shaped into tiny meatballs, which is FANTASTIC in flavor and also because there isn't any grease to drain or skim. Doubled up on basil since oregano isn't a family favorite, and also seasoned the broth with onion and garlic powders as well as a good dose of black pepper. Used a good quality garnacha wine and used slightly more than 1/2 cup. Used 1 can of fire roasted tomatoes as well as a roughly-chopped roma tomato, and even added in a handful of grape tomatoes that I wanted to use up. No zucchini on hand, so I tossed in some fresh spinach, a 20oz package of a 3-cheese tortellini, and simmered to perfection.  Leftovers tonight were also great...just added some hot water to reheat.  I like to add crushed roasted garlic bagel crisps to my bowl, but garlic bread is a superb side,  as well as a great way to sop up the deliciousness!

This is the best soup I have ever made ever. When I made it I forgot to add the wine, I'm going to make it again this weekend and I bet it will be a 6 star with the wine. Thanks for a fabulous recipe.

Whole family, even picky kids, loved this soup. It was easy to make and made the kitchen smell wonderful.  I used 1/2 spicy and 1/2 mild Italian ground sausage.  Slice the carrots and zucchini really thin.  Also used petite diced tomatos as suggested.  Was terrific.

I used a 1 lb of bulk sausage, squash instead of zucchini and fresh raviolette. I kept everything else the same and it was excellent my family loved it. I will be making this again and again.

This was really tasted, but I made several changes.  I omitted the water, increased the wine to 1 1/2 cups, and increased the beef broth to 6 cups.  I also added 2 cups of spinach the last 10 mins of cooking.  In addition to all the hebs listed in the recipe I used onion powder, garlic powder, Worcester sauce, and some creole seasoning while the soup was simmering, it was just a little too bland for me.  As another reviewer suggested, I made a cornstarch slurry to thicken up the broth a bit and boiled the tortellini separately and added them before serving.  Overall this was a great recipe that I will make again.

Excellent soup.  My niece made it for supper one evening when I was visiting.  She also served it with mozzarella cheese, as well as Parmesan cheese.  It is delicious!

DE-LISH-OUS!!!  Absolutely one of the best soups ever!! Whole family thought it was great.  Gets better on the 2nd day.  I definitely would take out the tortellini and store seperately if there are any left overs.

This soup is absolutely fabulous! It is so easy to make and always comes out delicious. If you don't have beef broth, then bullion works just as well. Also canned diced tomatoes easily substitute the fresh ones. This might be my favorite soup ever and it never fails to please company immensely!

Fabulous! I followed the recipe exactly as written and it was a full-proof dish with many layers of flavor- not too salty, you can taste the fresh tomatoes and the carrots and zucchini had a nice texture. The wine gave the dish a real depth of flavor and the tortellini rounded out the dish with the perfect amount of starch that absorbed the other flavors in the broth. This is a must try recipe, you will surely be happy.

Simply superb!!!!  I did not have fresh basil on hand, so just used my dried Italian seasoning.  I also picked up cilantro instead of parsley and it was delish.  I used frozen tortellini and put the whole 16 oz package in the pot.   I highly recommend this soup as a hearty winter meal.  I made some pretzels (Fleischmann's new box mix) and the combo was great.  Even my 11 year old who never eats soup was raving about how good it was.

This is a really good and easy soup. I didn't have beef broth so I used chicken broth and added some beef bouillon and I like more garlic so I always add more.. I used fresh oregano. other than that everything was the same. It turned out delicious. Thanks loved it.

The prep time is a little off but the recipe is very good. I added a little heat (red pepper flakes). A bay leaf and I used spinach tortellini. I am recommend it to a friend.

Made it last night and two hungry guys and myself devoured it! And I had forgotten to put in the tortellini which actually made it lighter. Next time though, I won't forget the tortellini! Very good and easy recipe.

This was delicious. I had some beef broth I'd made and was looking for a new recipe to use it in. I used leek instead of onion, because my husband doesn't like the texture of cooked onions. I also had to use fresh oregano instead of dry because it was all I had on hand. I will probably try this with a different flavor of tortellini in the future, maybe something with garlic or basil in it, as the soup itself was fantastic but the plain cheese tortellini was a little bland for our taste.

This is delicious! I've never had tortellini like this and I wanted to try something new. You can easily adjust this recipe. I made a really big batch and have eaten on it for a few days now. I uses a 20 oz pack of tortellini and a 13 oz turkey sausage. I added mushrooms and red peppers and skipped the wine and carrots. Turned out great!

I actually did not have wine, so I just used more broth. It was delicious. I am not sure where the 20 min prep time came from though. It took at least double that and I had just come from the store & over half my ingredients were out. It took 5 min just to gather the rest, then with all the chopping it took at least 40 min.

This is a great soup. My husband & I love it. I use dried italian herb instead of the thyme. I used a 16oz can of diced tomatos & fresh tortellini. So good. Have made this about 4 times & I have yet to be disappointed.

Used chicken sausage (mild Italian) and chicken broth instead of beef broth.  Also substituted two cans of diced tomatoes.  Really good and low in calories as well.  I will use a spicy sausage next time and that will push it to five stars!

I made this for a friend recovering from surgery.  It was the perfect fit, filling without being too heavy.  I enjoyed sampling her soup & later making a batch for myself!

This is really, really good!  Worth every positive review it got!  Canned tomatoes are fine!  Used both beef and chicken broth and the wine is a must!  I wouldn't change much.... It truly is fantastic!  Oh...and quick and easy!  You won't be disappointed!

This soup is absolutely awesome....I couldn't believe it...I actually made it a couple of days ago and then didn't have it until today.  Its full of flavor and one of the best soups I have made....I made it with canned tomatoes...4 cans...diced... and I doubled the sausage meat.  The only wine I had on hand was a bottle of merlot so used that.  It was delicious.  Let it sit in the fridge for a day and skimmed off the fat....Now sending to all my friends...thanks for the recipe....its definitely a 5 star..

This soup is very hearty and very delicious.  It was easy to prepare and it was also appealing to the eyes.  My children loved it!  My husband enjoyed it too, although, he felt it was a bit too salty.  I will definitely make this often.

Yum! Yum!  Didn't have everything, so used chicken broth instead of beef and white wine instead of red, and canned diced tomatoes. I make a lot of soups, this was declared the best ever!  I used chicken rosemary tortellini, don't use more than the 8 oz called for or it soaks up all the broth, which is just yummy!

Absolutely WONDERFUL!!! My home smelled like heaven!  I did alter the recipe just a tad to use what I had on hand.  Instead of the fresh tomatoes, I used two large cans of diced tomatoes (strained to remove excess liquid) & substituted  frozen green beans for the zucchini. I tossed in the frozen green beans in step "2" of the recipe, which worked well because they were still firm at the end of the cooking time.  My Husband loved it and said "we'll be making this again!"  Thanks so much to Mary P. for sharing such a wonderful, beautiful dish! Candee

I make this a lot... usually use canned diced tomatoes, and add celery and some fresh green and yellow beans. It's good without the sausage, too. I skip the cheese topping. One of my fav. soups!

I changed the recipe slightly to suit my picky kids. I used a can of petite diced tomatoes (drained) and added onion flakes instead of onion. My whole family loved it! Very tasty soup, definitely will make this again.

This was fantasic! The other reviews were so helpful!  I used turkey sausage, 6 cups of low sodium beef broth (a box and a can), 2 cans of diced tomatoes (drained a little bit), and instead of the carrots and zucchini, I threw in frozen peas and carrots for the last 30 minutes.  I also left out the onion and used dried basil.  The flavor was so good and the salt level was perfect.  I'll be making this many times again!

Great!  Don't be afraid to experiment a bit.  Frozen zucchini works great. I'd recommend that you season to taste and don't be afraid to add salt and more garlic.

Delicious! Made per the recipe first, but had to amend a few things for my taste. More broth, more herbs, more veggies, more tortellini! Loved it.

I've had this recipe for YEARS.   Its my favorite winter meal.  A friend took the recipe but said she uses whatever vegetable she has on had.  I also have made it without the tortellini.  I also use half sweet italian sausage and half hot italian sausage,  gives the soup just a bit of a bite.

My husband went crazy over this. We used double tortellini, dried herbs and spicy sausage but I would like to try the sweet. I think it would have been a nice contrast to the salty soup. This will be a must have for my husband in the future.

I had doubts that the soup would develop enough flavor in the allotted cooking time, but I was wrong.  It was very yummy, and I can see myself making this again.  hubby didn't like it, but that's his personal taste.  Next time I will decrease the diced tomatoes for him.

One of my favorite recipes from allrecipes .com-the only change I made is I used 2 cans of Del Monte stewed tomatoes (italianstyle-with basil, garlic and oregsno)-chopped- because I don't think the fresh tomatoes at the market have much taste-and I used dried herbs instead of fresh-cause I didn't have them-Have continued makinmg it this way since and have given out the recipe to everyone who's tasted it cause they demanded it!!!

This is amazing! My family loves this and I love that it doesn't take forever to make. I do add a cup more broth and about 3/4 of a 1 lb. bag of carrots. Great recipe.

My husband and I loved this..So filling and good. We enjoyed garlic bread and a glass of wine with it. I didn't bother peeling and seeding the tomatoes instead I chopped up cherry tomatoes and added them and it worked out fine.I also used dried spices instead of fresh.I felt like I was in Italy eating this.

Yum! Used sweet Italian style chicken sausage, so virtually no fat. Sautéed the onions and garlic in olive oil. Used pesto-stuffed tortellini for an awesome flavor. Hearty winter time soup, although I forgot to cover during the last half hour of simmering and lost much of the liquid. Next time I'll either add more broth or remember to cover it!

Just made this for first time, and while I am not a great cook by any means, this was easy and fantastic  tasting. Used canned diced tomatoes since that was all I had, but followed other ingredients exactly as called for and served with crusty bread, olive oil for dipping and a nice red wine.  Highly recommend this recipe.

This soup is a family favorite!  Just a couple tweaks - I use sweet Italian turkey sausage, saute ½ pound of sliced mushrooms with the onion and garlic, double the noodles, and omit the zucchini.  As my kids say, "Yum-tastic!"

Made this tonight and it was fantastic.  Next time I'll skip the zucchini - family wasn't too thrilled about that part!
I used 2 cans petite diced tomatoes (drained) instead of cutting them myself.  I also added a bit more red wine- almost a full cup.  I removed the casings from the sausage by making a vertical slit down the middle of the sausage and then just stripped the casing from the sausage.  I only had 4 cups beef broth so I used a cup of chicken broth in addition to the 4 cups beef broth.  I didn't have parsley on hand so that step got skipped.  It was full of flavor and enough to freeze for a 2nd meal later on with some fresh baked french bread from the bakery.

I used homemade beef broth, can of Italian stewed tomatoes,  and skipped the wine.  This turned out to very tasty with some fresh garlic bread hot from the oven.  I took some for lunch the next day and then we finished it for dinner.  Leftover soup is always better the next day.  Thanks for posting !

This is now a family favorite. We all love it. Sometimes I use tomatoes I have frozen from my garden, or homemade tomato sauce. I always use the tortellini from Costco,and Jimmy Dean Sausage. Easy and delicious.

Really liked how different this was from the majority of soups that I make. I would probably add less than 1 lb of sausage next time b/c it was a bit much but otherwise it was lovely! Enjoyed with some warm crusty italian bread.

Oh my gosh, we love this soup! I used the 1 pound role of Jimmy Dean sausage.  I omitted the zucchini and added a cup of chopped (FRESH not frozen) spinach.  The spinach gave it good color and even my children (who dislike spinach,) loved this soup!  I also did what others suggested and added a can of diced tomatos (with the juice)instead of the whole, fresh ones.  We didnt have tortellini in, so I added shell noodles. Any pasta noodles will do fine with this soup. This is definitely a keeper recipe.  So easy to make!

my favorite soup recipe of all time. usually my husband complains that my soups are bland...and he would be right. not so with this soup it was so good.  i did have to change the soup a little. i didn't have fresh tomatoes on hand so i used canned diced tomatoes and added tomato paste instead of sauce. i also used up a bag of frozen veggies that had been hanging around the freezer instead of the zucchini. but it all worked out. we will be eating this again and again!

this is a fantastic soup. the only change i made was to use a different pasta instead of tortellini. also next time i will cook the pasta separately and the add to the broth. cooking in the broth absorbs to much of it.

Recipe is great as written, I think after having tried it with sweet sausage - i'll go with the spicy next time. It might also be nice to have a little more zucchini but that is a personal preference. I didnt have fresh tortellini so I cooked mine separately then added to the soup afterwards.

This is really good, I made as is but doubled the recipe, used 1/2 regular italian sausage and 1/2 spicy ones, I used plain shells instead of tortellinni because I wanted to freeze it but it's nevertheless delicious... Oups, not true I made as is... I just reread the recipe and realize I used canned diced tomatoes with herbs & spices... turned out great anyway :)

This soup was amazing.  The broth was the best part - it was thick and meaty and rich without being too overpowering.  I added potatoes to the soup as well.  I will definitely make this again, it was a hit with everyone.

Thank you for the amazing recipe! I was looking for something different to do with my Spicy Turkey Sausages and this was it. I subbed beef broth & red wine for chicken broth and white wine and kept everything else exactly the same.

Changes I made: no water, 1 Cup merlot, 14oz can diced tomatoes, dried basil, 14oz can tomato sauce, no zucchini.  Added: 2 stalks of celery, 1/2 head of cabbage, 15oz can of cannelini beans.  Definitely a keeper.

Didn't add wine, but replaced with 1/2 cup water - and it was still delicious. Turned out very thick and chunky - more like a stew. But so flavourful!!

This is my favorite soup!  I've been making it regularly for about a year since I found this recipe.  Nothing needs to be changed, but I often use a large can of diced tomatoes in place of fresh.

This recipe was recommended to me from my neices husband in another state and I couldn't wait to try it. It's great. I like to take this soup to friends who aren't feeling well, after trying this soup they feel much better.

OH MY LORDY MERCY!!!! This was so fricken good!!!!  My 7 year old son even kept coming back for more.  I did use HOT Italian sausage cus our family likes it a little on the spicy side.  I also put a couple of huge handfuls of fresh spinach in there when I added the frozen cheese tortellini.  If you don’t like spicy spicy, don’t use HOT Italian sausage because it is spicy.  Adding spinach adds a nice touch and sneaks even more good for you veggies into the meal.  I will tell you that my Italian hubby absolutely loved this meal!!!  He normally complains that soup does not fill him up but this one he got full and really enjoyed!  Thanks Mary P for the amazing recipe!

We tried this recipe last weekend and LOVED it! We did elect to use chicken broth instead, and also took another user's recommendation and used a squash medly rather than zucchini. We almost made it again this weekend! Dee-lish!

Absolutely fabulous, but unless you have a sous chef, plan on considerably more prep time than 20 minutes.

Mary P, every time I make this soup it "rocks the house"!  My family loves this. I I love it because it is easy.  I have taken this to work and it looks like I spent far more time on it than I did.  Thanks for the share on this one!

I made this without the sausage for more of a vegetarian meal(not vegan...cheese tortellini) and it was AMAZING! I'm sure the sausage adds a lot, but having never had it with the sausage, I thought it was delicious!

So good my son, the picky eater, gobbled up an entire bowl and ask for seconds! I used canned peeled, diced tomatoes. Instead of water I just added more beef broth. Followed everything else to a T! Served it with crusty bread. Will definately make this one again.

UPDATE: MY HUBS HAS A TERRIBLE HEAD COLD. WHEN ASKED WHAT HE WANTED FOR DINNER, GE SAID HE HAD A TASTE FOR TORTELLINI OF ALL THINGS LOL! I IMMEDIATELY THOUGHT OF THIS SOUP. THIS TIME, I FOLLOWED THE RECIPE VERY CLOSELY ( I EVEN USED FRESH TOMATOES - WHICH I DON'T THINK MADE THAT MUCH DIFFERENCE, IMHO) BUT INSTEAD OF SWEET SAUSAGE , I USED THE HOT KIND . OUR SOUP WAS FANTASTIC (EVEN BETTER THAN LAST TIME. NOTE: BE SURE TO COOK YOUR PASTA SEPARATELY THO... IT WILL SOAK UP ALMOST ALL THE BROTH OTHERWISE. :) Yum! VERY good!!! This is delicious, complex and well-seasoned. It requires little modification, but as with any new recipe I try, I couldn't resist making a few minor changes. :) I pretty much followed Mary's directions to the letter except for subbing 1 1/2 (14.5 oz.) cans of organic petite diced tomatoes for fresh ones (I didn't have time to boil/peel/seed/dice/etc.), Italian seasoning for oregano (I couldn't find the bottle of oregano I just bought - argh!) and dried tri-colored cheese tortellini for the refrigerated variety. Other than these three changes, I followed Mary's directions exactly. I only needed two medium-sized carrots and one medium zucchini as Nikki suggested (right on!). Garnished bowlfuls with shredded Parm and some fresh chopped basil (a definite must) and served with warm ciabatta rolls and the rest of the cabernet sauvignon I used in the soup. :-) Thanks for sharing, Mary!

Very, very good soup!  I omitted the red wine, only because I didn't have any on hand and used canned tomatoes.  Next time, will definitely use fresh.  Delicious anyway!!

I didn't personally eat this.  I made it for my parents to give my mom a day off from cooking.  My dad loved it.  I accidentally used the hot sausage though so it was extremely spicy.  If you like spicy then I'd suggest that sausage to kick it up a notch!  I also added in a can of cannellini beans.  Heard it was great from my parents...will have to try it myself!

I just finished two bowls of this soup right after making it, it's the tastiest most flavorful soup I've made in a long time. I didn't have any tomato paste, and substituted tomato pasta sauce, a little extra, and it turned out just as well. I also added a little white wine as I was simmering the garlic and onions to deglaze the brown bits from browning the sausage. A hit with my husband as well. Well done!

This soup was delicious!  I added more beef broth and a little seasoning salt.  Also, one package of italian sausage didn't seem like it was enough so I cooked and added piece of hot ground pork sausage I had on hand, as well as some ground beef.  I also added a little more red wine.  My husband and I ate this for like three days.  That's how much we liked it.

Excellent recipe. I've made a few times and change the recipe slightly based on what I have available. I especially like adding baby spinach at the end with the pasta. I use reduced sodium stock and add a little more stock, water and wine than in the recipe. I use mild sausage to accomodate everyone, but would be even better with hot sausage.

This recipe is outstanding. I omitted the zucchini because my boyfriend doesn't like it. I added some red kidney beans though. It was incredible!

Outstanding flavor!  The only thing I did different was to use hot italian sausage, instead of the sweet to give a little and just enough kick.  Whole family loved it!

I made this soup almost to the recipe.  I used canned tomatoes instead of fresh and ommitted the basil (I did not have any) and added a chopped fresh carrot.  We at it for dinner all week and loved it.  Also, I used chicken broth instead of beef.  Really good recipe!!

This soup is the reason people say I am a good cook.  I add a smidge more red wine and use the whole bunch of basil.  If I am to serve it for dinner, I make it early in the day so that the flavors meld.  ABSOLUTELY DIVINE.

This soup was absolutely delicious. I ended up doubling the broth and wine and adding mushrooms and twice the tortellini. I used fresh tomatoes but it was a hassle to boil and peel them, so next time I will use canned tomatoes since the fresh tomatoes mostly disintegrated into the broth anyway. Made this for my parents and my mother was raving and couldn't wait to make it herself! Will definitely make it again.

Used 1 can petite diced tomatoes instead of fresh. Used canned carrots (added them with 10 minutes left). I really liked the broth flavor, but I thought the Italian sausage overpowered especially with the Italian herbs being added. I will probably use hot or regular roll sausage next time. Husband liked it!

I made this last night - very good.  And even better second day!  I did make a few adjustments just based on personal preferences.  To supplement the vegetables I added celery and also spinach (frozen, at the very end).  I also added a can of great northern white beans as I like white beans and sausage together.  I also used canned diced tomatoes instead of the fresh.  All in all a hearty and tasty soup - and very easy to make!

AMAZING SOUP!  My husband is italian so our Christmas Eve tradition with his family is a big Spaghetti dinner.  I made this to add to the dinner and it was a big hit.  I would not change a thing in this recipe.

I made this for my husband who loves soups. I ommitted the carrots due his lack of liking them. His initial comments were that it was pretty salty and could use more basil. He did say that it was better the second and third day. Still, he didn't rave like he usually does about other soups that I have made. I probably won't make this again.

Followed the recipe but added extra broth which had to be chicken because that's what I had in the freezer. Salty and more of an adult flavor than for kids.  Good winter food!

My husband and I loved this, so when my mom needed a main dish for a church dinner for 18 adults, I made her a batch.  She loved it, and so did the church group.  It was "just different enough" to still be a crowd-pleaser.

The only changes I made were for convenience.  I used a can of peeled/diced tomatoes, substituted jar spaghetti sauce for a can since I had it on hand, and used bulk Italian sausage instead of removing the casings.  Still tasted great!

This was amazing!  I took one reviewer's advice and didn't take the easy way out by using canned tomatoes.  The tomato flavor would have been too overpowering.  I did everything as written, except that I used hot Italian sausage instead of sweet.  I normally don't like to tweak a recipe before reviewing it, but I think it would have been just as great with sweet sausage to those who love it.  I will make this again and again!

I make this all the time...mostly for entertaining. So easy and everyone loves it. I usually end up adding more water - at least 1.5 cups...sometimes more. I use frozen cheese tortellini because I always have it on hand. I also will use canned tomatoes if I don't have any fresh ones. Very flexible soup!

This soup was simply delicious.  My husband and co-workers were begging me for more.  I immediately split it up into 7 servings and after eating each serving, I wanted MORE, but the bowl was empty.  Due to dietary reasons I substituted turkey sausuage and also drained 75% of the fat it created but otherwise I followed the recipe as written.  I agree with many other reviews and next time I'll use more broth/stock.

I followed the recipe exactly regarding ingredients. I did however cook slightly different. I tossed everything in the crockpot that morning minus sausage and tortellini. When I got home that night I added the tortellini then cooked and added the sausage during the last 30 minutes of cooking. Great recipe and easy to make.

I made quite a few minor changes to this recipe. I had some precooked ground sausage already in my freezer, so I just used that and sauteed my veggies in extra virgin olive oil. I added in 1/2 tsp. dried basil in step 2 and did not add in the fresh basil until the very end, right before I served the soup. I also substituted a 15 oz can of crushed tomatoes for the fresh tomatoes. I omitted the can of tomato sauce. Everyone in the family absolutely loved it!

This soup was delicious. I used two pounds of sausage, one sweet and one hot. I think next time I will use more diced tomatoes because I was a little short on broth, possibly because of the extra sausage. Also, this soup has an unbelieveable aroma when it was simmering. My family asked me what I was making because it smelled so good when they came home.

This was delicious!  I used canned tomatoes instead of fresh and added two extra cups of beef broth.  Instead of cheese tortellini I used chicken and procuitto tortellini and it was the perfect mix.  My husband and I drank the rest of the red wine used in the recipe with dinner.  Finally, I shredded some monterey jack cheese on top...that made it even better!

Great soup. Mine came out a little on the thick side so I added some more broth. Other than that it was really good. We all loved it.

Great basic recipe and then season to taste. I followed the recipe exactly, except doubled the garlic (I love garlic). I tried to buy low sodium everything because canned broths are always high in sodium. I doubled the veggies, since I am trying to cut down on meat. I recommend doubling the oregano and adding more fresh herbs.

I liked this soup a lot. Unfortunately, I ruined it.  My beef granules got stuck and when I tapped them on the edge of the pan, about 1/2 c. came out.  It dissolved before I could remove most of it, so my soup was way too salty.  However, the flavor was good and I liked it other than the salt factor.  I'll try it again right in a while ... after we've recovered from the sodium overdose.

This is great.  I used sweet sausage and added a pinch of cayenne pepper to the pot.  I have made it with plain diced petite tomatoes and with 1.5 cans of stewed tomatoes. I use kitchen shears to cut the tomatoes while in the can.  The stewed tomatoes gives it a better flavor.  If you are using canned tomatoes,  try stewed once.  I also use bow tie pasta.

this was a great starter but I used the suggestions people made and changed the soup to better suit my tastes. I added hot sauce because my husband I love things spicy and this made for a great meal! Very filling.

Very tasty soup, hearty and warm. Goes good with bread and butter. I wasn't a fan of how long it took to make, even with the helpful tomato peeling tips from other reviewers. Next time I might try fresh tortellini; I wussed out and got pre-packaged and for some reason the stuff on the inside tasted gross. But that's not the recipe's fault.

I cooked this delicious soup tonight and the family loved it. My lovely wife urgently filled a bowl to take to work for lunch tomorrow. The kids liked it, too. No problem with it being too salty like some users reported. It was perfect! The only thing I changed was to add some sqash - other than that, I followed the recipe. I'll absolutely make this again. Thanks!

Great flavor and easy to make. I didn't have any tortellini so I used another type of pasta. I do think it would be better with small tortellini. I also didn't have any fresh tomatoes so I used 2 cans of dices tomatoes and all fresh herbs. I think the beef brooth and the wine brings out the great flavor. Very filling!

Very good soup, but the prep time is definitely not 20 minutes! I blanched the tomatoes in boiling water until the skins start to peel off a little bit and then throw them in ice water. I used three cheese tortellini.

Wonderful!!! I used hot sausage- really gave this soup good flavor. I used canned diced tomatoes instead of fresh, sans zuch.  Instead added fresh spinach with bow-tie pasta instead of rav.
YUM YUM.

This soup is a family favorite.  Whipped up a triple batch to feed a group of Boy Scouts working on an Eagle Scout project and there wasn't a single drop left.  Served with hard French bread.  Yum, yum, yum!!

My Aunt in California made this soup for my father & I when we visited.  You cannot go wrong with this recipe!  It was fantastic as our Christmas Eve dinner.  Use some sourdough bread for dipping and you have a meal to remember.  I didn't (and wouldn't) change a thing. A definite keeper - and healthy too!

Amazing!!  Followed directions almost exactly with the following modifications: no wine, 3 cans of beef broth, 1 1/2 cans of drained petite diced tomatoes, no parsley, no basil, and sliced carrots from the salad bar at the grocery store.  Couldn't have been better!  Would have added the spices, but didn't have any.  This was so easy and tasted amazing.

I served this on New Years Eve and everyone raved over it!  I used canned diced tomatoes instead of fresh tomatoes as another reviewer suggested.  This soup is wonderful!!  One suggestion - for storing left overs, pull the tortellini out of the soup and store in a separate container so that it will not absorb all of the liquid.  Then reheat with soup - worked great!!!  Thanks for the recipe.  I'll make it again and again.

The best Italian soup of any kind I have had ever!  I used mild Italian sausage as opposed to sweet and added mushrooms.  It was perfect. This one is defiantly a keeper.

Had this for Christmas Eve with friends and they loved it!  Used canned tomatoes, but otherwise followed the recipe.  Will need to add some more liquid to the leftovers as the tortellini soaked up the broth, but that will only make it better.  Will use again next month at a "soup party".

This was delicious!  And EASY! Tastes even better the next day.  I used 6 c. beef broth, no water, used 2 cans of italian diced tomatoes (not drained) and used more carrots cause I didn't have zucchini.  I used regular pasta shells cause I didn't have tortellini and boiled them separatly and added to each bowl of soup.  Can't wait to try it with the tortellini though!  So good- has similar flavor to the minestrone soup at Olive Garden.  Definelty on the list of winter soups for a cold day!

this is a great, easy recipe.  I've made it exact and with changes... it is so flexible.  Last night, I made it with elk sausage and olive oil, canned tomatoes and veggie broth and all the other ingredients the same ~ it was the best yet!  I let it sit overnight and served it today for a ladies lunch with crusty bread.  Everyone raved.  Thanks for a great soup!

Decent recipe with some good flavors, although it took FOREVER to make!

I would recommend ditching the dutch-oven technique and pan frying the sausage--this will substantially cut your time. Also, try to find a lean sausage because, even though I was able to drain/skim the fat a little, I was still left with a slightly unappetizing, greasy spoon.

Awesome soup!  Especially with very fresh tortellini.  I added extra beef broth (2-3 more cups by the end).  Used mixture of sweet and spicy Italian sausage.  Wonderful flavor!

This is the most amazing and versatile soup. During the winter I make it almost weekly. In fact, my husband invited my in-laws over last minute and rather than making a whole new meal, we had the soup (since it was already made) and they loved it. A few adaptions I have made are this: I use Isernio's Italian Chicken Sausage and I actually like it better. I also changed the cheese tortellini for dried pesto tortellini (Trader Joes) and I increased the liquid to about 7.5 cups of beef broth. With these adaptions it is about 150 calories a serving.

Wow!!!  This soup was WONDERFUL!!!  We will definately make this again, and again!  I made a few changes based on the previous reviews.  2 big containers of chicken broth and water (didn't feel like opening a bottle of wine for just a little bit) I added a can of cannellini beans and blended them in when I added the broth.  Then I added 2 cans of petite diced tomatoes.  I also added a couple of handfuls of spinach when I put the tortellini in.  I don't like my veggies mushy in soup, so I cooked the initial 30 minutes and added the spinach, zucchini and tortellini together at the end.

Yum! I made it vegetarian by substituting in vegetable broth and Chipotle Tofurke sausages.  I also added
1 jalapeno pepper seeded and diced.

This recipe is very good.  I made a couple of changes, since I had little time for cooking it midweek.  First, I used the dry in-the-bag type of tortellini noodles, and cooked them in the soup COVERED for about 11/12 minutes at the very end.  This cooked them just right and saved some money.  I really didn't like the hassle of peeling and chopping tomatoes, since I think they would've tasted just as good from a can.  Next time I'll do this and hopefully save even more time.  The soup itself tasted wonderful--my children even ate all of the veggies in it because the stock was so flavorful.  Excellent fall/winter soup!

Soup came out wonderful!  I used whole wheat tortellini to make a bit healthier and it still came out a very satisfying and hearty soup!

Fabulous! I usually prefer a light chicken-based soup, but it was chilly and I felt like I wanted a heartier soup. This was easy and totally fit the bill and wasn't too heavy.

This soup was wonderful!  Even my kids (that hate vegetables) liked it.  We made a couple of changes:  14.5 ounces of diced tomatoes instead of 4 fresh tomatoes, increased the tomato sauce to 14.5 ounces, and increased to 12 ounces of tortellini.  It made enough for two full dinners for our family of four.

Very tasty but came out a tad salty (will look for low- or no-salt bullion next time; I used packets this time that didn't say anything re salt content). Wasn't crazy about the tortellini; it was kinda chewy even though it was bought fresh from the refrig. section at the store. I'll try regular pasta (e.g., elbows) next time. Used turkey sausage and that worked out great. Zucchini kinda got squishy - more a texture than a flavor - and that was fine. Could use more carrots! Do try this recipe and plan on tweaking! Great on a cold day!

Just wonderful! So tasty. I made a few changes with it. I used about 7 or so cups of broth seeing the pasta really sucks it up. Didnt add the wine seeing I didnt have any handy. I also used 2 15oz cans of diced tomatoes drained and used dries herbs instead. It still came out great. Even better the next day!

Awesome soup, a definate make for the fall/winter months.  I could not find sweet italian pork but purchased sweet italian chicken links in the casing and that is what i will use next time around.  I also might add a bit of celery next time. The entire family loved it.

Made this soup last night. I really like it and will definitly make again. The only things that I changed was I used basil flakes 1/2 teaspoon and Italian mild bratwurst. Wal-mart was out of fresh basil and sweet italian brats. Thanks for such a good recipe.

This is an excellent soup! I did modify it a bit to watch fat and calories: I used two links spicy turkey sausage; sauteed the garlic, onion, carrot and added some celery; used two cans diced tomatoes in juice instead of fresh; and finally, I added a few handfuls of baby spinach instead of zucchini. It was fantastic - almost my favorite soup recipe (second only to Stephanie G's Creamy Chicken and Wild Rice recipe).

This was good, but not great so only gave 4 stars. I went by the recipe only subbed diced canned tomatoes for fresh. Maybe that is the difference, but it lacked a punch of flavor. Great with garlic bread.

Delicious.  Added (3) cups Kale, (1/2) cup mushrooms, and several (6-8) large sliced olives.  Changed the following instead of (5) cups beef broth I went (2 1/2 cups) chicken broth and (2 1/2 cups) half beef broth.

Excellent recipe. I took it to a potluck at work and didn't have any left over. I did not include the red wine.  Added a few mushrooms & a bell pepper that were on hand. Will make again.

This was a great soup.  My husband who sounded a little disappointed when I said we were having soup for dinner had two big bowls and said it was the best soup he's ever had!

The only changes I made were instead of fresh tomatoes and a can of sauce, I used a large can of crushed tomatoes just because my son doesn't like tomato pieces in anything.

Thanks for a great recipe.  I will be using it again.

This was an excellent stew, I followed the recipe exactly (except I used a large can of diced tomatoes instead of fresh). As others said definitely do not add salt to this soup, i think the salt content is why some water is included in the recipe. It's not too salty, but it would be if salt was added. My hubby and I loved this, it is so so so so good! Try it!

I used mild italian sausage and added a little sugar (I don't know, is there a difference?). I only used half the tomatoes (I had gigantic tomatoes...) Omitted the carrots b/c I forgot and added a little thyme/rosemary. I didn't quite get enough oil from the sausage so I used a little olive oil to cook the onions/garlic. This dish was delicious! Paired with crusty bread and parmesan, great for winter! Definitely a keeper. Thanks!

SO DELICIOUS!  Made for the 1st time for a friend who just had twins.  I had more than enough for her family and mine:)  Did make some minor changes.  8 cups of beef broth, instead of 5; 2 14.5oz cans of diced tomatoes, instead of 4 lg tomatoes; used dried herbs, instead of fresh; 10oz of frozen spinach, instead of zucchini.  OH MY GOODNESS was it so good!  Thank you for a great recipe!

Wow!  Was this ever a hit.  It was declared (by my MOTHER) 'the best homemade soup ever.'  I used canned tomatoes, and frozen tortellini, and served it with grated parmesan cheese on top, with, of course, fresh baked bread from the bakery.  Even my kids loved this!

Absolutely awesome!!! My husband, myself, and our 4-year old loved this soup! It is simple to make. I doubled the batch and it lasted us about one week, thanks to my husband bringing it to work for lunch almost everyday until it was gone. I recommend this to everyone looking for a tasty, hearty, delicious soup. I served it with a crusty french bread which I picked up hot and fresh from a local grocery store.

Fantastic recipe. My mom swears it cured her cold. I only had 1/2 pound Italian sausage, so I added some chicken breast to make 1 lb of meat. I used garlic and spinach tortellini, very yummy! Thanks for a wonderful recipe, I will be making this often!

This is a very very good recipe.  I tried to freeze the leftovers, which I wouldn't recommend, because the pasta tasted funny, but that just could of been the pasta that I used.  I added white beans and kidney beans which added lots of flavor and texture, I  used hamburger instead of sausage, and I added a splash of balsamic vinegar right before serving.  Sounds weird, but tasted excellent! I will make this again :)

Great soup.  I have made two changes.  I use chicken broth instead of beef broth.  (It is what I keep in the house.)  I also used 1 package of thawed spinach instead of the zucchini.  
It is a crowd pleaser!

Yum, yum, yum. We thought this was so good. Served with Garlic Breadsticks using Jay's Pizza Crust and Garlic Butter also from this site. I sent some leftovers to my parents, and they thought it was incredible as well. One of our favorite soups now!

I'm not much of a fan of sausage, so I knew I wasn't going to go ape over this one. The broth, however, was very good - a nice combination of flavors. I forgot to get zucchini (oh well, I don't care for them much anyway) and I accidentally bought Thai basil which, as I discovered, is quite different to regular basil. It worked well though. This is good recipe. Husband especially enjoyed it. Thanks!

I haven't made this recipe myself, yet, but one of the girls at work brought it in and it was awesome!!  I was skeptical to try it at first, but what a wonderful combination of flavors!!!  She skipped the wine as she didn't have any on hand and just added more broth.  I can't wait to make this for my family!!

I made this soup at a dinner party, where everyone had to bring an Italian dish, and it was a great success - everybody loved it...especially me!!!  The best soup, truly that I have EVER made!

Hint: do remove the casings from the sausage, and I mixed both hot and not spicy italian sausage for this soup.  YUMMMMY!

We rate this more of 4.5 stars.  Even with some adjustments for lack of ingredients. (poor planning on my part)
I didn't have quite a pound of sausage, and I used chicken sausage at that.  My garlic was all dried out, so I had to used dry minced.  In place of the chopped tomatoes, I used a small can of V-8.  I also used a can of sliced carrots and didn't have any zucchini.  All that being said, this was still a very good soup.  My DH loved it.  I will make this again for sure.  Thanks for the post Mary.

This is ABSOLUTELY the best soup!
 I am a full-blooded Italian and I have had many versions of sausage soup. 
This recipe is very easy to make, very hearty also.  I did substitute a large can of diced, stewed tomatoes for the fresh one.
This is definitely a keeper!  I plan to make it again and again.

This was awesome. We left out the zucchini since my wife doesn't care for it, and it was great. I think next time I'll add a little more broth.

A-mazing!  Can I say it again… AMAZING!  This was a really great soup, but you should try it for yourself.  I did sub some things…  Bullion for broth, Italian seasoning for the basil & oregano.  I also used canned tomatoes and added a tbl 6 pepper seasoning to spice it up a bit.  I served it with a Caesar Salad, but also think that crusty bread would go great with this dish.   I also think this would be a great dish for kids (if no additional spicy peppers are added.

This soup has always gotten rave reviews, everytime I serve it. It is a great tailgating menu item. My football friends loved it! I also use canned diced tomatoes.

I made this soup tonight and all I can say is WOW. What a nice and different soup. I didn't have fresh tomatoes on hand so I used canned ones and it was just fine. This reminds me of a soup you would find in a fancy Italian restaurant. Thanx!

Absolutely delicious.  Got rave reviews from the entire family.  I used hot sausage instead of the sweet because we like it a little spicy.  Also, I substituted canned chopped tomatoes for fresh.  I tried the fresh one time, and it's a lot of work, and in my opinion, not worth the extra effort.

I thought this was great, but the hubby thought it was only so so.  The only thing I would change, would be to add about an extra cup of beef broth.  It came out very thick and more stew like.  Good flavor.

This is such an easy soup to make and a great meal served with crusty bread and a tossed salad on a cold night.

Wow!  Tastes like something from a restaurant!  Unique flavor, something fancy to serve to guests.  :o)  Had to make some substitutions, used dry herbs instead of fresh, used half a can of tomato paste instead of tomato sauce, and used a can of chopped tomatoes instead of fresh.  And the recipe still turned out great!  Made garlic bread sticks and it was a complete meal.  :o)  Even got my husband to eat zucchini which I never thought possible.

Very good! My bf gave it an 8 out of 10. I used a different sausage; next time I will try a mild or hot. The soup needed a little kick. I omitted the wine, used fresh spinach instead of the zucchini and used dried herbs. I added more herbs than the recipe requested. Overall a VERY GOOD soup! Loved the cheese tortellini in it! I served it with a fresh salad and italian bread!  yum!

oh yum, was this good!!  I added an extra cup of broth, doubled the tortellini, used spinach instead of zucchini (the zucchini didn't look very good at the store), and used turkey italian sausage rather than the regular stuff (had a guest who didn't eat red meat).  An absolute keeper, my husband even said it was the best italian soup he's ever had!  Will make again for SURE!

This recipe is one of the best I've ever used on this web site.  My husband and my 6'8"  16 year old lineman son abolutely loved it .... and it takes something to both fill them up and impress them.  It is definitely on the recipe rotation!

This was wonderful!!  I doubled it, to accomodate a large gathering, and not one bite was left!  I was short on the beef broth, so I added some vegetable broth, but that was the only subsitution.   I can't wait to make this again!

I would've given it ten stars but five is the highest rating on this site.  Absolutely delicious!  I skipped the zuchini and added frozen green beans instead.  Also, I followed advice from another viewer and added 1T cornstarch to thicken the broth a little.  I skipped the tomatoes and added 1 can of diced tomatoes instead.  Very yummy.  Will make again.

My husband (not normally a soup eater) gave this one RAVE reviews.  It's a wonderful soup - just make sure you allow plenty of time for the veggie-chopping!

This is a wonderful, flavorful, hearty soup. I not only received raves over this but requests for the recipe as well. The one change I made was the chopped fresh tomatoes, I used canned chopped Italian tomatoes and a little extra fresh basil, a definite yum!

My family doesn't like chunky tomatoes, so I puree this soup in the food processor.  It's great.  We also use Hot Sausage for a little added heat.
