It's simple to make and you can flavor it almost any way you want. I found that adding the vanilla with some cinnamon and sugar is delicious! Making my own creamer is already saving me money and makes it easy to control my sugar and calorie counts.

If you're looking for a coffee mate or international delight, this is not it. Not even close really. I was hoping the sweetened milk would be enough to sweeten it to be similar to my fav brand but, no. So, I added some sugar hoping to rescue it and it's just like I'm drinking coffee with cream and sugar, except I spent more time preparing it. Maybe some torani syrup would give it a better taste?

This is a good recipe and can be tweaked according to personal taste. I made with 1 Tablespoon vanilla and 2 Tablespoon sugar. Seems thinner or less creamy than store bought and I believe it is because commercial brands have various oils added. Even though this recipe isn't really healthy, it beats drinking oil.

This was wonderful! I altered the measurements to be 14 oz sweetened Condensed Milk AND 14 oz heavy whipping cream to make it 50:50. It was wonderful!

Nice in a pinch even if all you have is 2% milk. The condensed milk makes it smooth and sweet.

I made this for the first time exactly as the recipe called and for my taste buds, it's perfect.  Next time I'll try mixing in flavors.   I like knowing what's in my food.

I won't make this again. The sweetened condensed milk does nothing for it and it doesn't taste like my favorite store bought versions at all. I had to add extra sugar and extra vanilla and it still only tasted like half and half.
