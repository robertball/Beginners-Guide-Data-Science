Great recipe... Tips: I did it severall times and had problems to create the many bubbles I saw in India... Solved by adding a 1/2 teaspoon of baking soda and putting a lid on the pan... Do this and bubles will pop out everywhere and the bread will melt in your mouth...

Absolutely better than the Naan served in my favorite local Indian restaurant.  A couple of comments to clarify the recipe instructions, however:  "Proofing" the yeast means that you must add about 1 Tblsp. of sugar to the warm water and yeast, then allow to double in volume prior to adding any further ingredients (I might not have known that had I not stumbled upon proofing instructions on the package).  Also, I found that it took a considerable amount of time for this dough to rise, so keep that in mind when you are planning for this to accompany a meal.  High heat was way too extreme a cooking temperature.  I burned the first few and ended up keeping the heat on medium-low.  This recipe had a wonderful flavor, and you could truly eat them alone with nothing more than a little butter.  Tasty!

I have mostly forgotten was naan tastes like, but this was relatively similar.  As I live in an off-campus apartment, I didn't have access to a real grill, so I tried the following:  1.  Cooking it on an open George Foreman Grill  2.  Cooking it on it closed.  3.  Cooking on a grill pan in the oven.  4.  Grilling it in a toaster oven.  The opened George Foreman was best.  And another tip:  Don't knead in the minced garlic.  Add it to the hot melted butter and let it soak in for 10 minutes or so.  Then apply the butter- it is delicious, and you don't have chunks of pungent garlic in some bits and not others.  I halved the recipe.

This was fantastic ! I made it in my bread machine on dough cycle,using only 3 1/2 cups of all purpose flour as recommended by others, then removed it, made the balls and let rise about 1/2 hour. The SECRET to getting them to bubble is - when pinching the balls, pinch half in each hand, put the two halves together and then make the ball. Let rise, roll out and fry in butter. One more thing. I made these on a Monday and I had five balls left over so I put the raw dough in the fridge in a zip lock bag and four days later, just floured a board and rolled them out without even letting them come to room temoerature and they were just as good as the first time !Served them with lamb curry the first time and pea soup the second. I imagine that freezing them and letting them thaw would have the same results since there is so much frozen dough in the stores these days.Mine were perfect ! Thank you for the recipe. I have tried to make naan before with another recipe and it turned out heavy and blah. Thanks again - my husband just raved.

Greate Naan recipe!  My mom (she's Indian) and I have tried making so many different Naan recipes, and this one turned out the best.  The trick to having it bubble up and not be tough and chewy is to  roll it as thin as possible.  Then when cooking it on the grill only cook it until the grill marks get dark brown, do not let the whole Naan brown.  Aside from the grill marks, the rest of the Naan should still be white in color. It's the closest you'll get to the Naan they serve in the Indian restaurants.  Thanks so much for posting this Mic!

This recipe makes a delicious fry bread. Some reviewers were disappointed in how long it took to rise. You must PROOF your yeast, by adding 1T of sugar to the yeast and warm water. Let sit for 9-12 minutes, then proceed with the remainder of the recipe. My clothes dryer happened to be going at the same time, so I just stuck my bowl on top for warmth. The dough came out absolutely fantastic. I did half the recipe as stated, and since I had small children visiting, I did half as cinnamon-sugar fry bread.Simply roll the bread in a mixture of cinnamon-sugar when its just out of the oven. The kids loved it. Medium low heat was best to avoid burn marks.

Very good, as stated before by others this is similar in quality to good indian restaurants.
I used my baking stone and set the my oven to 600 degrees rather than use the grill. The baking stone helped to give it the tandoori oven taste. The cooking time was considerably less though, taking about two minutes total, at most. I tried both regular butter and ghee (clarified butter) and found the ghee imparted more of the restaurant taste. Omitted the garlic.

Really great recipe!! I loved the taste of this bread because it's so close to what's served in some of my favorite Indian restaurants. I omitted the garlic. Instead of grilling, I cooked the naan in a large saute pan after I brushed both sides with melted butter. Make sure you don't add too much flour when you're kneading, or the dough will be stiff. Add just enough flour to have the dough just barely clean the sides of your mixing bowl. If you're having problems with the dough not rising (maybe it's not warm enough in your house), try putting it in a warm oven (200F) with the door open and covered with a damp towel.

This is fantastic bread -- it really is as good as I've had in most restaurants. The main course was almost forgotten, as the naan stole the show. I'll definitely be making these again -- tomorrow, in fact, due to popular demand. I made a few very slight changes to the recipe, substituting 3.5% fat yogurt for the milk and using a skillet instead of a grill. I also basted them with ghee instead of butter, and upped the garlic just a smidge, since I love it. Delicious!

I wanted to address the poor ratings.  I've tried several varieties of naan, and I have found this recipe to be the test, even better than the recipes on the Indian recipe guides.  I wanted the stress the importance of the flour.  I tried making the Naan a couple of a weeks ago with all-purpose flour, and the naan turned out too chewy, hard, and tasted like an over-boiled garlic pancake.    I would suggest to use only white flour- this may be a disappointment to those that want a more healthy option.  If you want the healthy option, skip the ghee.  I just made another batch of naan, and it turned out perfect.  The difference?  I used flour that was marked as "Bread Flour".  The way the flour is treated really makes a difference, folks.  Another tip: the ghee really makes the naan, taste, well, like Naan!  Ghee is not JUST melted butter and garlic, its prepared in a very different way.  I suggest anyone that wants an authentic naan at home to go to an Indian store and buy some ghee, and the flour you use makes a difference.  I noticed one commentator talked about not being able to roll-out the dough well enough, this, again, is a sign of not letting the dough rise enough and the dough not being well-oiled, and the flour that was used will influence it as well.  Hope that helps!!

terrific! use it to make cheese bread or pizzas on the grill!       i'm adding to my review...i had to reprint this recently, and while i was waiting for the printer i read some of the recent reviews. so, i added the 1/2 tsp. baking soda which did give the bread a nice bubbly texture. i used yogurt instead of the milk--gave it a nice tang. i also replaced 1 1/2 cups of the white flour with wheat (to get in some whole grain!) hard to believe that one of my favorite recipes could be improved on, but it was! thanks for the suggestions.  also, i sometimes replace the water with beer-gives it a nice yeasty flavor...

This was an amazing recipe.  I come from an East Indian background, and was looking for something that tastes authentic - I found it here!  I took the advice of previous reviewers and used only 3 1/2 cups of flour.  The naan came out fluffy, soft and very light.  They were perfect.  The only thing I'll change is the amount of sugar - or salt.  I found them just a bit sweeter than I'd like.  I should mention, though, that I did proof the yeast (added sugar to the water-yeast mixture) which may be the reason I had extra sweetness in my naan.  I used my oven on broil (high heat).  When the naan hardened up a bit (just about 45 seconds to a minute) and before it started to turn brown, I flipped sides and let it fluff up.  I then flipped it again and let the first side brown as well.  The total baking time is something like 4 minutes.  This recipe was amazing.  I'll be making this my permanent go-to naan recipe.  Anyone looking for an authentic tasting naan, this is it!

This does not take like naan at all.  It tastes more like a sweet bread.  The recipe is easy but needs some adjustments to make it taste more like naan.  I tried cooking the dough many ways; on the grill pan, the toaster, etc.  This is the best way I found to cook the dough - I took the slotted tray out of my toaster and put it on top of the burner on the stove.  Then I turned the burner on low and placed the dough on the tray.  This allows more air so bubbles can form on the dough, making it more fluffy.

This recipe was delicious!  A bit time consuming, but totally worth it.  I substituted plain yogurt for milk (i ended up needing about twice what the recipe called for) and let it rise in a warm oven (I turned on the oven while I was making the dough, then turned it off and put the dough in to rise).  I used the 1/2 t. of baking soda and the naan came out perfectly bubbly.  The best method I found for cooking was simply an ungreased, uncovered nonstick pan over medium heat.  I put the finished naan on aluminum foil, brushed it with garlic butter, wrapped it up and put it in the oven on warm.  When the next naan is finished, pull the packet out of the oven, stack the naan on top of the previous one, et cetera.

This recipe was simple to follow, and yielded good results after reading some of the other reviewer's tips. 

You definitely need less than the four and a half cups of flour called for; more like three to three and a half. I substituted one cup of whole wheat for one cup of the white flour to add some fiber.

I recommend either proofing the yeast with a little white sugar in the hot water or at least letting it sit until it gets really good and foamy. Otherwise the first rise takes forever. DO NOT put the dough in a 200 degree oven with the door open as one reviewer recommended! Not only is this dangerous but it's far too hot and will start to bake the dough. I learned this the hard way. You can put the dough in a covered bowl on top of the oven, or set it in the oven with a bowl of hot water under it. 

Make sure you flatten the dough balls out really thinly, as they will bubble and rise quite well. I cooked mine in a medium-heat dry skillet and they did just fine. You don't really need as much butter as the recipe calls for if you're using a skillet. 

Very savory, chewy, and delicious. I will definitely make these over and over again! Next time I'll try substituting yoghurt for the milk.

I added 2 teaspoons sugar to the water and yeast.  I like mine really garlicky, so I added 1 tablespoon of fresh mined garlic. I didn't have bread flour so I used all-purpose flour and added 1/2 teaspoon of baking powder.  I found 4 cups of flour was plenty.  I also found the dough to be a little bland so I added 1 tablespoon of salt instead of the 2 teaspoons it called for.  I made my dough balls about the size of 1 1/2 golf balls.  I also discovered that I needed to roll them with a rolling pin to the thickness of a thick tortilla.  They puffed up nicely with little brown spots and bubbles.  I found that the longer the rolled out dough sits before grilling, the more bubbles puff up.

This naan is easy to make and very delicious (I served it with the coconut tofu keema recipe from this site). I used plain yogurt instead of milk, as my Indian friend suggested. 

I proofed the yeast by following the instructions on the packet rather than what's written in this recipe. A good idea is to let the dough rise in an oven that has a bowl of hot water in it. This provides a warm, draft-free place for the dough to rise properly.

The naan is delicious. I've already had requests to make it again!

This was great with a beef curry I made. I had tons and tons of leftover dough though, so I formed small balls, froze it and now pull one out when I need pizza dough. Make a great crust and SO easy.

Easy to make and very authentic in taste.  Both times I've made it, I've found that pressed garlic cannot be incorporated into the dough because the juice doesn't mix in easily.  I would use minced (NOT pressed) garlic or use garlic butter during cooking to get the garlic taste.

Excellent recipe. I used the dough cycle on my bread machine to mix, substituting yogurt for the milk and bread machine yeast for the active dry in equal proportions. After reading other reviews, it seemed that 3 1/2 cups of flour was too sticky, but 4 was too dry. I used 3 3/4 cups of bread flour, and it came out perfect!

To simulate a tandoori oven in my apartment, I put my pizza stone in the oven and heated it at 500 degrees F for 30 minutes while the dough balls rose. To bake, I rolled out three or four balls at a time, wet my hands, and flipped them onto the pizza stone. They broiled for NO MORE THAN 2 minutes while I rolled the next batch. Excellent texture, and some of them even puffed up.

They freeze great, and I take them to work with prepackaged curries. Makes a cheap, healthy, delicious lunch!

my father is Pakistani, and we used to eat a lot of naan bread at home, but we bought it at the local East Indian restaurant.  Unless you have a "tandoor", or clay oven at home, it's not going to be restaurant quality.  Having said that, this is a close second!  I don't roll out the balls of dough, but rather use my fingers to stretch them in to a large tear drop shape, that way the texture before grilling is thick, and uneven.  This way, after grilling, you get an almost authentic bread.  Also, I added 1tsp of baking soda to the flour mixture to get bubbles on the surface.  Thanks for sharing!

The first few times I made this recipe, I cut the sugar down to 2 Tblsps since I found the dough too sweet. At that time I was cooking it in my cast iron skillet like I would tortillas.

One day we decided to cook it on the grill. I forgot to reduce the sugar and guess what? It wasn't too sweet if cooked properly. I guess the sugar must burn off on the grill. Also, the Naan was much puffier and tasted better cooked on the grill. It also left the kitchen less messy! Heh.

This is a great recipe and I use it allll the time.

Fantastic! This was my first attempt and I wanted it to be authentic for my son-in-law as he's traveled to India. I left out the garlic and he said that he missed that--I'll add that next time. Do NOT use more that 3 1/2 cups flour. I substituted plain yogurt for the milk. What made it authentic was the baking. I heated my oven to 475 and placed my baking stone 2 racks from the top. I wet my hands as I dropped the Naan on the stone--it sizzled, bubbled, and baked in 3 minutes. I'll never make dinner rolls again! I served it with Tabouli, and Mulligatawany Soup I. Fantastic and healthy!

Very tasty- I modified because I am a fidgety cook. I'm sure the recipe is great as is, but here's what I did anyways: Made it in the bread machine (manufacturers order- everything else, then the flour, then the yeast). Because we have a jar of yeast instead of packets, I added what amounted to 3 teaspoons instead of the 2 1/2 that are in a packet. Also, cut the flour back to 4 cups instead of 4 1/2. Also drizzled in some olive oil (about 2 tablespoons) because I was nervous about the little fat in the initial dough. Also used powdered garlic instead of mincing because I was feeling lazy. Set on the dough cycle and forgot, literally. It rose quite a bit in the machine after it was done (I forgot it for about 30 minutes), which is good because it did not rise that much in the initial stages of prep. Took out, formed into balls. Deeply regret not greasing the pan I put them on or the tops before I lay the towel down, but it wasn't that big a deal. Left them for another 30-40 minutes. Cooked in a regular nonstick pan over medium heat- 2 minutes on one side, 1 on the other, with extra garlic powder sprinkled over it. Will definitely do the same recipe again and soon!

Great naan, makes it even simpler if you have a bread machine. Just add everything and set it on the dough setting, when its done break up and continue from there. Make sure to make alot as it will go very fast.

OH this was so-o-o-o good my whole family loved it and have already asked me to make it again. I did not add garlic to the dough but added garlic salt to the melted butter and brushed on while grilling.

Another rave review is probably not required, but I just have to !!! Use This Recipe !!!
I have made naans this way plenty of times since finding this recipe and the only thing I've change since is to use garlic powder and dried cilantro or parsley in the dough. Do use real melted butter - the taste is ..... yummmmmm

If you're watching your cholesterol, this can be made without the egg.  Also, if you want a more authentic naan, replace the milk with two or three healthy tablespoons of yogurt.  I also sauteed garlic in olive oil and then kneaded that garlic into the dough at the second rise.  I then used the olive oil that was infused with garlic to brush the naan with on the grill.  Delicious!  Thank you so much for a terrific recipe.

Great recipe! The family loved it!  It took a little less flour and worked great in my Kitchen Aid mixer with the dough hook. So easy to make...a definite keeper!

Made this for supper with my usual curried dal and brown rice. This is so much better than the store-bought kind (which is good) and not hard to make at all.   I used King Arthur white whole wheat flour instead of bread flour. I doubt there was a difference.

This was a lot of fun to make!  Granted it took a while, but I fed a large group with it.  I found that if I stretched the dough after rolling it out it gave it a great texture!

I did create a slight variation when making this once because a friend of mine loves cheese naan. All the cheese naan recipes I could find called for an indian cheese that was similar to cottage cheese and adding plain old cottage cheese to the dough just didn't sound appealing. 

Thesefore instead of kneading in garlic, I kneaded in parmasan cheese and I melted parmasan in butter before brushing the naan.  Ok, not traditional at ALL, but delicious.  I served it with marinara sauce for dipping and it got rave reviews.  People fought over them!

Okay.  I made these for the umpteenth time tonight to go with my version of keema and raita BUT for the first time, I actually cooked them on the grill.  OMG, not only were they better than cooking them in a skillet on the stove, my smoke alarm did not go off, thereby calling my family to dinner.  So, unless it is 2 degrees below 0 with a windchill of minus 40, that will be the only way I will cook them from now on.  Maybe even then.  Just saying.  Thanks for this recipe.

This is the only time I use my Foreman grill... throw the flattened rounds on for a few minutes. Both sides get evenly golden brown with the slightly crispier "grilled" parts but the insides retain their chewy fluffiness. Fantastic!

Wow I was just so impressed with this very easy to follow recipe.  I decided to make the dough in my bread maker.  I dissolved the yeast in the warm water first, added this to the bread maker, and followed by the milk and egg.  I then proceeded to add the dry ingredients and four large teaspoons of garlic.  I then followed the recipe as stated, cooked on the electric riddle, but brushed lightly with olive oil instead of butter.  They came out so well, tasted delicious too.  My family was delighted!!

I'm new to Naan - and I just love it!! We will probably use it anytime bread is called for now - like with soup - eggs - spaghetti - lasagna - dips....  I made two batches - one - the yeast (I had a jar that I had opened about 5 months ago - refrigerated and was dated 2013) did not foam very good - the other batch I made with an envelope - so I guess with no air getting to it - stayed fresher. The envelope raised the very best  (needless to say I won't be buying jars anymore since I obviously don't use enough) but I wanted to fry both and see the outcome.  Even though I rolled them both VERY thin - though the pkg. yeast batch was harder to roll because it had so much elasticity - they both came out tasting yummy - just a different texture. Naturally one was thicker than the other. I don't make bread very often anymore - but I think this will be my new love!!  I used fresh garlic in melted butter to lather over the tops - by the way - I had to use way more butter - maybe I over did it - but it was worth it.  Also used between 3 & 4 cups flour - also used yougert in the second batch - though I really couldn't taste a difference there.
LOVE the recipe and will use it many times to come!!  ALSO - I froze what we didn't use - warmed it up at 350 for about 1-2 minutes - I felt it tasted fresh - its so nice to have it right there waiting for you!!  Thanks so much for the recipe and all the helpful comments!!

Amazing! Also let yeast proof.  I used whole wheat pastry flour so it didn't taste like restaurant Naan but was so delicious that I will never use white flour. Made tons so we made sandwiches with it. Also cooked them on non-stick frying pan to eliminate the extra fat. Turned out perfect!

This turned out great... the second time.  Here is my suggestion and hopefully it helps someone else not waste an entire batch of dough the first time around.  First, proof your yeast with the water AND sugar, then add the rest of the ingredients.  Secondly, only add 3 cups of flour.  I've found my breads to come out so much better when I knead by hand, so do that.  And while you're kneading, have that last cup and a half of flour ready to flour your surface with while kneading.  I ended up using almost the full amount of flour called for that way, but when I added it all at the beginning, it made a very stiff and difficult to work with dough.  Instead of grilling it, I put some EVOO in my cast iron sillet and cooked them over medium high heat for a few minutes.  When the bottom browns up, flip.  This bread is absolutely delicious, and I easily ate one alone without my homemade hummus!  Thanks for the recipe!

Holy cow these were so delicious! I didn't change a thing except to not add garlic and not brush with butter. The bread bubbled and looked and tasted genuine. We cooked ours on our charcoal BBQ and we ate more bread than dinner lol! The dough is very easy to use - the trick is to roll is as thin as you can. It kept well in the fridge to cook more the next day. Makes delicious sandwiches if you add some feta and whole basil leaves, then roll.

SO GOOD!!! Be careful not to add too much flour. The first time I made this, I added the full 4 1/2 cups and it came out a little tough with no bubbles-- still very tasty though. This last time I used just under 3 1/2 cups of flour. The results were fantastic-- soft with lots of bubbles. I could easily eat the entire batch myself!

I gave this recipe four stars because it's not as delicious as an Indian restaurant, but still pretty good!  The only change I made to the recipe was to omit the egg (both of my kids are allergic) and then used slightly less flour.  I also added the garlic to the melted butter instead of kneading it into the dough.  To try to make these similar to using a tandoori oven, I put a baking stone in my oven at 400 degrees.  The first one I rolled out way too thin - from reading the reviews I figured the thinner the better.  Wrong - it ended up like a cracker!  Tasty, but thin and crunchy.  After that, I left them about 1/4" thick and it worked much better!  They puffed up and were cooked and yummy after about 1.5 to 2 minutes per side.  Next time I'll make them bigger, though - the golf-ball sized chunks of dough made pieces that were only about 4" in diameter.

These turned out just like Tandoori Naan from the Indian Restaurant.  I used my kitchenaid mixer to knead the dough. I cooked them in the George Foreman grill and in the oven on a rack. I prefered the oven ones better.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Really Really good, my family loves them, unfortunately when I make them with curry the kids (husband included) fill up on the naans and aren't hungry for the curry!! These are also an excellent pizza crust, just make two or three big naans, grill, add toppings and putinto the oven until cheese is melted. Much better then any of the pizza dough recipes I've found!

Good without the garlic too. The trick is making it as thin as possible. You also have to turn it a few times. After you put it on the skillet, you wait until the first bubble starts on the bottom. Wait a minute for it to get as big as it's going to get and flip it! I use tongs, not a spatula as that can deflate the bubble. Same with the other side...wait for the bubble to form and flip it again. You definitely need to watch them as you make it. The initial time to make the dough takes a while. Is it time consuming? Yes. Worth it? Totally. It makes so much, I just refrigerate the dough and make 5 or 6 every day at breakfast and we eat it throughout the day.

This was absolutely delicious, and easy to make.  My only advice is to roll out the pieces as thin as possible.  On my first batch, I left them too thick and found that the inside was still slightly gummy by the time the outside was done (they brown VERY quickly on the hot grill).  In my later batches, I was rolling them out very thin and they turned out perfectly.

After burning the first two using my broiler I tried the George Forman Grill.  It Works!!! The bubbles are smaller and in rows but it is delicious and takes about 1½ minutes only. Thanks for sharing this recipe.

I used self-rising flour so I significantly reduced the salt. I also "proofed" the yeast. Because I used all the amount of flour listed in the recipe, I had to add a little more water and milk.

I don't have a grill and using the oven would have taken too long for the amount of Naan dough I ended up with (4 1/2 cups makes way more than 14 pieces!!!), so I fried them in a pan of vegetable oil until golden and then lightly sprinkled them with salt. DELICIOUS.

Everyone loved the Naan. The children came back for seconds, possibly thirds, and kept reminding me to make sure their Mom got the recipe. My husband ate 5 of them, on top of the basmati rice and chicken curry, which is a new record for him! There were no left overs.

I will definitely make this again! Super easy, even for someone who doesn't bake and has no idea what they're doing (that's me)!

First attempt at making naan!  My husband adores it, and I thought I would surprise him.  

I used my big electric skillet, as I didn't have a grill pan.  That worked just fine, and I even had browned bubble spots.  (Roll them out as thin as they will go to get the bubbles).  Next time, I will try using my pasta machine to get them super thin.  

Thought the dough was too sweet, so I will definately cut down on the sugar.  I will probably use 2 TBS, and I will use that in the proofing of the yeast.  I won't use any additional sugar at all.  My husband kept saying, "It is like a pancake and my moms rolls".  (He is addicted to his mom's rolls, so although it doesn't sound like it, that is a compliment.)  I think the pancake part came from the sugar, so by reducing the sugar, I may take care of that.

I froze 1/2 of the dough after I rolled it into balls.  So, I get to have it again soon!

I don't have a grill, so I made these under the broiler in my oven, on low.  It worked really well.  I love how quick they are to make- I'm already planning my next menu with naan!

These are awesome! I made mine on my George Foreman grill 2 at a time. Brushed one side with butter, laid that side down on the grill, then buttered the other side and cooked at 425 for 4 minutes, with the grill closed, which gave nice grill marks on both sides. I turned them over at 2 minutes to help even the browning. Came out light, fluffy, and buttery. Will be making these again!

This recipe is easy and tasty.  I make a large batch and freeze what we don't eat the first night.  The naan is great reheated (from frozen) at about 400 degree for a couple of minutes.  It also makes for great quick mini-pizza crusts.

This was great!!!  I did it in my bread machine on the 'dough cycle', rolled into balls and let rise under a towel 30 minutes.  As per some suggestions I added 1/2 tsp of baking soda to help the dough bubble when cooking; substituted the milk for greek yogurt and reduced the flour to 3.5 cups for using the bread machine.  Then rolled into oblong shapes (see my pictures).  We grilled it on LOW direct heat on the BBQ (propane).  I did start them on indirect heat for my sample but it not bubble at all and dried out.  I probably did about 3 mintues per side and sprinked with seasalt as they came off the grill.  Kept them warm in a large foil pouch (vented) while the chicken finished.  We wound up handing some over the fence to curious neighbors because it smelled like heaven!!  A new family favorite!

This was my first time making naan.  I followed the recipe, but did not use the optional garlic.  I also ended up cooking them in a cast iron grill pan at a very high heat rather than on a grill.  They were sooooo good and went perfectly with the Indian chicken dish I prepared!  Thanks for the recipe!

We loved this bread. I made it last night and have been requested to make it again tonight. I think my family could make a complete meal from this. Be sure to let the dough rise for easier rolling out. Mine turned out a bit thinner than a lot of the pictures, but thicker than pita. I will have to take a picture this time. :) Here are a few tips from my experience. Be sure to proof the yeast with sugar as some have suggested. I did not use the amount of flour in the recipe. For a double recipe I used about 7 1/2 cups of flour so I would guess 3 1/2 to 3 3/4 cups would work for a single recipe. Note that the recipe says to add enough flour for a soft dough. Using ghee (clarified butter) will help it not to burn so easily, but I didn't find it necessary so I did not go to the bother of clarifying the butter. I made fewer pieces (8) to cut down on the rolling time. After rolling out I brushed one side lightly with melted butter and put it buttered side down on a griddle (350°F). I buttered the other side and flipped it after 2 minutes, cooking 2 minutes more. They turned out great using a griddle rather than a grill. Several said they left out the garlic, but I would never do that... ;-) My family thought it was even better than their favorite Indian restaurant. Thank you, Mic. It was a huge hit at our house.  I will also be trying it with my home ground wheat. I think it will be fabulous. :) Photo uploaded! :)

This is a GREAT recipe.  The garlic gives it just the right flavor.  I made this on a pizza stone.  Oven to 400 degrees, just laid the dough on and flipped it in about 6 minutes.  Only takes about 4 minutes on the other side.

I thought the dough was a little stiff with 4.5 cups of flour (weight measures would be more accurate, but oh well).  Next time I make this, I'll start with 4 cups flour and add more as I think necessary. 

Fantastic recipe.  Went over great with my dinner guests.

I have had this in my recipe box for like 6 months, but I have been too intimidated to try it.  This was not only the best naan I have ever eaten, but probably the best bread I've ever made. I have found with all the bread recipes I have used, there is not enough salt, so i used 2 and 1/2 tsp of salt.  I didnt have any milk, so I used the same measure of heavy cream and they were perfect!  I made these in the pan (*medium heat) rather than on the grill, and added chopped cilantro to the butter I basted with.  When I make these again, I will probably add garlic to my basting butter as well.  The only downside to these naan's were that I could only eat 2 because I was so full from my dinner.  If I had the time, I would rave about these all night; they were that good.  Amazing recipe, I wish I could give it 10 stars.

Very, very good. I made on the dough cycle of my breadmaker I reduced the flour to 3.5 cups but kept all the other ingredients at the correct amounts. it's cold in Scotland right now so I popped it in my oven on the defrost setting for the second rising - perfect after 30 minutes and easy to roll. The tip about making the balls in two pieces really worked for the bubbles. Thanks to everyone for all the great tips

This Naan has great flavor. I followed the recipe for garlic naan exactly, except I couldn't use the grill. Instead, I preheated my pizza stone in a 600 degree oven and used that as the cooking surface.  The naan was done in 2-3 minutes.

The best naan I have eaten since I moved to the West coast. I put four cups of flour in at once and luckily decided to mix it before adding the last half cup of flour, and even then there was too much flour - the dough came out tough and chewy. It was still quite tasty though. Next time it will be even better, once I reduce the flour to 3 1/2 cups as many comments have suggested.

WOW...I am addicted and impressed I made this!  Grilling in VT in January not an option, so I sauted in butter in a pan.  I did proof as someone else suggested and used garlic powder instead of chopped garlic.

Wow.  I am impressed, I MADE NAAN!!!!  I have never tried it from scratch before, never really tried any bread from scratch...and I did it!  This was a great recipe!  I followed another reviewers suggestion and left out the garlic and instead basted the bread w/ garlic infused butter. While this was tasty, next time I'll probably add the garlic to the douugh- there just wasn't enough garlic flavor for me!  I used a cast iron skillet on the stove top to make them- worked great.  Just watch your heat.  I kept mine on med/med low and they turned out great...med/med high and I was scortching them!  Thanks for the recipe, I might try other breads now!

Varied baking method.  Cranked oven up to 500 degrees, lightly buttered top and bottom, placed on baking sheet for 2 minutes on each side and end result was awesome.  Next time I'll try using a baking stone as recommended on another site...

hmmm...either I've had the best naan in the world at my favorite Indian restuarant so nothing else can compare....or this recipe stinks.  (Or, heaven forbid, I'm a horrid cook??)  I'm going to try again and report the results back another day

this recipe is great . although i could not add more than 3 cups of flour. i also baked  it in the oven on a baking stone. preheated oven 500 for 30 minutes then broil. one minute in the oven and you get fresh baked naan. I wish that the fresh taste would last more than a day.

WOW! That's what comes to mind with this recipe!  It was amazing.  I did put a tsp of sugar in the water with the yeast and let it foam in a warm place.  I added some garlic powder with the flour just because I didn't want to add the garlic later, thought I could save a step and some mess.  I used my double burner skillet instead of the grill and it was awesome!  I think it's easier this way if you're worried about burning the bread, you can watch it like you're cooking pancakes.  I was worried that they would be gooey in parts, but they weren't.  I divided the recipe into eight balls and just flattened them into crude looking ovals. It seemed more authentic and was just faster.  I liked that there were thick parts and thin cracker like areas.  I sprayed my pan with Pam and then threw them on.  I brushed the first raw side with melted butter and then brushed them again after flipping.  My husband has stated that I should make these all the time, not just with Indian foods.

This was really good! I have made it on the grill and now I have made it in a frying pan.  The frying pan was actually easier, though it took longer because I just did one piece at a time.  Any big frying pan will do; just use medium-medium high heat and a teeny bit of olive oil or spray and it turns out delicious!!!

I have been trying to find a naan recipe for 4 years since I met my husband who is from India. I have tried at least five different recipes and they all fell short of the REAL thing. This naan was exactly like I had in India. Great recipe! Anyone who hasnt tried it is missing out.

This was a truly wonderful recipe. The only changes I made were to follow a few suggestions from others. I cut out some of the sugar and mixed the minced garlic with the butter to be used to brush on the naan while it's cooking. After the second rising, I divided the golf ball sized dough balls into two parts, flattened, and stacked one ball on top of the other, and then rolled the dough out from there. 
The Naan was bubbly and puffy all over. It looked and tasted just like, if not better than, the naan I've had at various indian restaurants. This recipe is a definite keeper, but one I'll have to hide from myself. This stuff is beyond addicting! Awesome recipe, Mic. Thanks again.

I made this recipe the other night and served it with Indian dahl.  My family had never had naan before, and were rather questioning it at first.  One bite and we were hooked!  A very yummy flat bread.  I did not have enough white flour, so I used half whole wheat and half white flour.  Will make it again and again!

I made this tonight and it was really good!  I made it on the stove, in a nonstick pan over med high heat. I tinkered with this a little to make it vegetarian (egg substitute and butter flavored spray, rather than melted butter). I also used whole wheat pastry flour. It turned out great,sweet, chewy, very yummy!

I was very impressed with how yummy this recipe is & how simple it is to make! Never made any kind of bread before but this a great intro! I meant to fold in cilantro to the dough as well as garlic, but forgot so added it to the oil I was brushing on when cooking which I think added a little extra flavour zing. Definitely a great home cooked naan!

This recipe tasted great but needed tweaking to make it work. First I did not even come close to needing 4.5 cups of flour I barely used even 3 for the dough also as I tend to use the bread for mini pizzas or sandwiches the golf ball size was way too tiny and did mine more like tennis to base ball size which made a much more useful size for something other than finger food bread. I used no butter only oil. I tried the grilling method but found it very hazardous and difficult to really shape the bread. So instead I took a pizza stone and put it in my oven which I heated to 400 then I removed the stone spread a thin layer of oil on it and shaped the dough balls on it and baked it about 3-4 minutes for each side. Came out a bit lighter in color but tasted great. It took less time as I could cook more at one time than the stovetop grill method. Next time I think I will grab a plastic mat covered in plastic and try shaping the dough on that first then baking them. this made close to 11 pieces even with less flour and larger pieces.

Such an amazing recipe.  We use less water and add some plain yogurt to the recipe as well as some garm masala.  It tastes divine!

This was really good.  Be careful with the flour - start with 3 1/2 cups then add more as you think necessary.  We just dumped in the 4 1/2 cups on the first batch and the dough was hard as a brick and barely rose.

I couldn't get it bubbly, even though I tried all the suggestions. It was hard the first time, but the second time it was just DENSE.

This was quite delicious! I made it on an open George Foreman, and it puffed up nicely. I wish it was bubblier, so I might use the suggestion of adding some baking soda to the dough.

Edit: I tried to make this into cheese-filled paneer using mozaarella in one and cheddar in the other. While they tasted good, it was very messy and not my *best* plan. I rolled out the dough into four sheets and made two different ones... I think I'll try a different method next time.

Yummy!  I substituted plain yogurt for the milk (it seemed to me that's an essential recipe for naan), and put in 2C whole wheat flour and 1 1/2 C white flour (total of 3 1/2 C instead of 4 1/2).  I also did mine in the breadmaker on "dough" setting, but accidentally put the 1/4 C butter into the dough--but it turned out delicious!  Cooked on a George Foreman grill...best when rolled very, very thin & grilled for a while on one side (without butter on that side--can probably only do this w/ the Foreman Grill), and brushed a butter/garlic mixture onto the top side while it was grilling...then flipped & grilled on buttered side just enough to get a little crispy.

it was very easy to make, I like that the dough is not sticky so I did`t need to roll them on a floured surface . I used my indoor electric grill and I used AP flour the only change I made is I used more water and 1/2 tsp baking soda ( recommended by another reviewer).
UPDATE: I had the best results by using AP flour + 1TBS wheat gluten , but this time I did't use milk i used plain yougrt instead (about 5 or 6 TBS )and more warter (abot 2 TBS)and 6 TBS sugar.

I can't imagine a lot of recipes being better than this one.  These are PERFECT.  Just like the restaurant and maybe even a better.  The garlic flavor takes the Naan to another level and I could eat this flat bread with so many different sauces or toppings.  It does stand alone as well.  All I have in the apartment to eat it with is some peach salsa, but I'm tempted to just slab some more butter on it!  First rate!

this naan is so good!  better than the naan I have had in indian restaurants.  I would love to see what this recipe tastes like cooked in a traditional oven.  I use an electric skillet to cook these so I can put my lid on.. with the extra circulating heat I can get some nice sized bubbles to appear that remind me of traditional naan. I have also tried different things to coat my skillet from olive oil to butter; so far butter wins!

After several failed attempts at naan, I was really excited about this recipe.  I was really good, but I think next time I'll use just a little less sugar.  I used a cast iron skillet and started by preheating it in the oven at 500 degrees, but the bread turned black before it was cooked through.  They came out much better when the skillet was at a medium heat with just a little bit of oil on it.  After a while, I started brushing butter onto the dough before putting it on the grill, and I think this was better.

I absolutely loved this!  Needing a bread to accompany my Indian style dinner one night, I searched for a Naan recipe.  I chose this one for its simplicity and ease.  I cannot say enough about this fantastic bread! I don’t have the ability to have an outdoor grill, so into a hot oven they went!  I baked them at 450 on foil for about 5 minutes and they came out wonderful!  I had some foil and butter ready, so as soon as one batch came out of the oven, I buttered them and wrapped them in the foil.  By the time I was done I had a nice stack of hot, buttery naan that was just unbelievable!

Incredible! I was doubtful it would turn out, but we enjoy Indian food so much that I decided to give it a try. I followed another poster's suggestion to use the breadmaker on the dough setting up to the point where you roll the dough into uniformly sized balls and let them rise again. Worked perfectly. I surprise absolutely everyone when I tell them I made naan.....on the grill!!

Yummy! This was my first attempt at using yeast, and I have a few suggestions for beginners- use fast-rising yeast! It took me a long time for my yeast to double in size (although someone finally suggested to put it in a luke-warm oven, which sped it up). I don't have a barbecue, but did them on an indoor grill and they turned out great! Very easy to freeze the dough so I can have naan whenever I like- which is often!!

Loved it! Comes out perfect every time! I made a few variations of my own, I proofed the yeast with 2 teaspoons raw sugar just to be safe, added 3 tbsp Greek yogurt, 2 tbsp coconut milk and 2 tbsp olive oil. Swapped out 2 tbsp raw sugar and 2 tbsp dark brown sugar for the 1/4 cup white sugar and also I only start off with about 4 cups of flour and add more as I knead when neccesary, and it turns out delicious! The Greek yogurt gives it that extra "oomph" Definitely a keeper! The family requests it every time we have Indian, it goes great with chicken curry and our friends can't believe we make this at home. Delicious delicious naan bread!

We like to bake these in the oven @ 425F. Just heat a sheetpan upside-down on the middle rack, then place 1 or 2 pieces of rolled out dough at a time on the pan, flipping after a minute (or less!)- 30 seconds more and they're perfect! Thanks for the great recipe!

This is the best naan recipe I have ever used. My husband is from India so I am always trying to cook recipes to take him back home. When he tasted this he said that it reminded him of home so thank you very much for this recipe. I plan on using this recipe continuously. I wish I could give it more than 5 stars.

So good and so easy! This makes way more than 6 servings. Brushed with melted butter with salt and granulated garlic added to it for extra flavor. I'd add extra minced garlic to the dough next time too. 

The extra bread we just grilled up without the brushed butter and put in the freezer for future meals.

This is the best naan, I'd even dare to say better than restaurants.  If you're cooking in a frying pan, cook on medium heat.  High heat will burn. I also buttered only after cooked, not on the raw dough. I found my butter burned otherwise.

I love this recipe.  I had leftover dough balls and froze them.  A month later I thawed them out, rolled them out and grilled them.  They turned out the same or even better than when I first made them. Excellent.

Excellent!  I added dried onion to the Naan, because I like the flavor instead of garlic.  I did not need all the flour recommended.  I proofed in my oven first and then did as the recipe dictated.  I upped the butter a little and did outside on my grill as it was already hot from making Shish Kebobs.   Taste just like my friend makes from Nepal.  I like mine with a little homemade greek yogurt sauce.  YUMMY!

Soft and delicious fresh, but tough and chewy leftovers.  Cooked mine on a baking stone at 500 F just until the bubbles turned brown.  Roasted the garlic in the oven before chopping and kneading into the dough.

Amazing!  Instead of grilling mine, I just cooked it a minute or two on each side in a skillet.

Really good - the kids love them, the husband loves them, I love them.  I personally find them a little sweet for my taste, if I was cooking for myself I would decrease the sugar or honey.

Delicious recipe!! My husband LOVED the flavor of this bread. We dipped it in butter chicken...yum! Only needed about 3 1/2-4 cups flour for the recipe.

I'm just getting around to a review after 2 years of loving this recipe. When I make it using a skillet, I use the medium-low setting, which makes that perfect window a little easier to time.

This was awesome.  I think I used around 3 1/2 - 4 cups of flour total.  And let the yeast proof for 10 minutes with a bit of sugar before adding the rest of the ingredients.  It came together beautifully and rose very well.  It also made a TON, far more than my husband and I could eat, so I froze some of the dough and will try thawing and making it again soon.  We don't have a grill, so I pan fried mine in a large skillet over medium high heat.  It turned out a little chewier and more moist than the naan we get at our local Indian restaurant, which is drier and crispier, but this was still excellent.  If we had a grill, I think I might be able to get the texture closer to what we get at the restaurant.

I usually make Naan with yogurt, but I didn't have any in the fridge, so I searched and found this yogurt free naan recipe, and though it took more time (because of the risings), the product was great!  I brushed the newly cooked naan with melted butter (ghee), as I usually do with the yogurt naan recipe, and yum!  I do use a cast iron pan stove top, works great! Will use this again when I am yogurt-less!  Oh, and I did not use all the flour at first, I had a pretty good dough with about half to one cup flour left, which I used during rolling the dough.  Hope this helps!

thumbs up! I just made a batch of fantastic naan bread! One suggestion: I used a dry skillet instead of the grill and the cooking time decreases dramatically! I burned the first piece of bread and then I only left it for max 1 minute! I could not believe it could cook so quickly but I've just tried a bit and it's PERFECT! Yummy! Thanks for a great recipe!

I really liked this recipe, instead of brushing with regular butter I brushed with garlic butter and that made them extra good. I did find the bread was a bit too sweet for my taste so the next time I will reduce the sugar to a tablespoon.

These were amazing!  I used a stovetop grill, and they turned out really well.  This works well to make falafel wraps.  "Sean's Falafel and Cucumber Sauce" goes great with these.  I added about 1/4 tsp. of baking powder and followed the rest of the recipe as is.  Thanks for the great naan!

Very good, tho' not exactly like restaurant naan as touted, but close enough until I find a better recipe. I will definitely make it again, tho' I'll let the thinly-rolled breads rise 10 mins. before grilling, which the recipe inferred one doesn't need to. I grilled this on med.-hot. IMPORTANT: eat while warm, bec. it became rubbery when cold; that may've been from the thinly-rolled bread not rising (for a 3rd time), or as reviewer MONDEEP (on 1st pg.) says, perhaps I need to roll it even thinner.

Great naan! I used the basic recipe, adding a little more yogurt, less water and a pinch of baking soda, preparing the dough with a kitchenaid mixer, with 1/2 a cup of flour less than the recipe asked, to make a more flexible dough. Instead of a grill I've just used a non-stick frying pan. Roll a very thin (1/8in) sheet of dough and put on top of the pan... wait for big bubbles to form and turn it. After some tweaking on temperature of the pan and on the grilling method the results will be fantastic. I also saved the dough in a ziplock bag for using in the next day, with gains in flavor. Just wait a little for the dough to warm up before making the naan in this case.

I used this excellent bread as pizza shells for personal pizzas- So good!  instead of butter I brushed with olive oil, chopped garlic and basil.
grilled them, cooled them and topped them.  Thru them in the oven until cheese was melted!  SO YUMMY!

Oh WOW! This turned out so much better than the Naan at my favorite Indian Restaurant! I mixed everything in my KitchenAid Mixer. I proofed my yeast by heating the water to 115 degrees and adding 1 tsp of the sugar to the water. I obmitted 1 tsp of the salt in the dough because I added garlic salt to my butter to brush on the outside. I also heated my oven to 200 degrees and then turned it off before putting the dough in there to rise. It turned out so good - Thanks for the awesome recipe!

This recipe is fantastic!  My husband couldn't believe how delicious it turned out.  My son is dairy free and I used rice milk and Smart Balance light as substitutes for milk and butter.  I've made it several times, both with or without the garlic. I like to make it without because it is good with honey for dessert.  Also, I did follow earlier posted advice and add some baking soda to the recipe to get more pillowy, bubbly bread.

Made this at school and used it as our 'taco' shells. Absolutely delicious!!! Dough turned out beautiful, we rolled the dough into little rounds and then flattened them. Brushed with oil, sprinkled them with kosher salt and then grilled them. Turned out spectacular!!! This is now thee only recipe I use for flat breads. I've even made BBQ pizza with this dough. Brush with oil, grill one side and when you flip it put your toppings on and cook until cheese melts!! So good!!!

Very good.  Going to try some of the suggested modifications to see if I can bump this up to a 5 star.

I started this in my breadmaker, which turned out great.  Just add the ingredients in the standard order:  wets,  dry, flour, yeast, and you'll be good to go!

I made this in my bread machine - it is very thick dough and gave my machine quite a time so I wouldn't recommend that.  The garlic turned blue when I cooked it, which I found very odd.  The taste and texture of the final product were fantastic!

I 've been searching for a great, doable naan recipe. Fresh, warm naan was worth the time waiting for the dough to rise. I proofed the yeast in warm sugar water and added yogurt to the dough mix instead of milk. It adds a mild sour taste I was after. I'd cut back on the sugar. But that's just personal preference. I've made naan in the oven and (as suggested) on an open electric grill. I much prefer the convenience, quickness, and the results of using the electric grill. Addictive. Perfect accompaniment to my favorite homemade Indian dishes. Thank you much.

These are great.  We use 1c whole wheat flour just to make them a little more healthy.  Instead of rolling into balls for second rise, roll out the dough flat then do second rise to get the yummy bubbles in the bread.

Great recipe. Naan tends to get tough and stale pretty quickly after making it because there is no fat in it, so if you want it to stay soft a little longer after making it add a little bit of butter or oil.

Its easy to make this bread in a bread machine, just use the dough cycle, and it will have it's first rise in there.  I added the garlic before it finished kneading. This made for only 1 rise after forming the balls. WONDERFUL!

Just like the Naan you get in the Restaurant! I thought I botched this recipe because the dough didn't rise quite like I'd expected. Either I was very wrong or this recipe is very forgiving. We decided to freeze half of the rolls for another time. Another time came two days later:)

Delicious, easy to make and pretty to look at. It is a little sweet as other reviewers have noted and it gets chewy and tough kind of quickly, so it should be served and eaten immediately.

This recipe was the best one I've used for naan.  My south indian friend even approved!  I have made it at least a dozen times in the past two months.  I omit the egg and the butter though, and allow the dough to rise for at least an hour and a half.  If we are not grilling, I use the broiler on the oven and they still come out amazing. A true favorite recipe!

Well, I give this a 4 because my husband loved the taste. It didn't turn out anything like the restaurant Naan we had just last week. The taste was wonderful, and I might give it another shot. If I make it again, I will scale the recipe down to maybe 1/4 or 1/8 - I have tonnes leftover from last night!! Good taste, but not what I was looking for.

Ok, so here's what I did: I used a)whole wheat flour and b)LESS sugar than listed, even after scaling down the recipe. I think that those of you who are having trouble rolling the dough out should try adding only 2 tablespoons of sugar--in my case I only added 1 since I halved the recipe. Not only did the dough come out perfect the taste was also exceptional. A little time consuming but worth it. And as 1 person said--terribly addicting :)

As one indian and one wanna-be indian lost in Singapore for several months we were craving some good ol fashioned naan.  This (almost) did just the trick!! We had to improvise using a hot toaster oven (grimy though it was from years of student use). We also skipped much of the rising times, assuming it was so hot and humid in singapore that such things were of little importance.  Turned out GREAT, except we didn't have any butter to spread on top...someone threw ours away from the communal residence fridge.  Grr.  

Didn't have an egg, so we stole someone else's...would it have worked without one? I guess we'll never know...

In the future, would definitely reduce the sugar, and probably try to find a working oven/grill.  Thanks for the recipe!

We love this recipe! It is soooooo good. You have to try it on the grill, as indicated. I thought it would make this horrible mess, but it worked perfectly (definitely oil your grill first). It takes about 20 minutes to grill all the bread up. We normally eat it with Indian dishes with lots of gravy to sop up but it is equally good with jelly globbed on and eaten as a pastry-esque type thing.

This was delicious and well worth the effort.  I will not buy store-bought again!  I made a few slight changes:  1.  Halved the recipe and it made 8 "balls". (I froze 4)  2. Used 2 cups of bread flour for a half recipe.  3. I added 1/4 tsp. baking soda per other reviews so it bubbles when cooking.  4. I added 1 Tbls. sugar (part of the total sugar amount, not additional) to the yeast and warm water then added the rest of sugar with the other ingredients.  5. I proofed in oven on "proof" setting (100 degrees)and it took 1 hour.  6. I rolled out each ball very thinly on a lightly floured counter.  (not sure how you'd roll them out at grill side!?)  I used a totally different cooking method which I read in one review and I think this is the KEY to perfect naan.  Heat iron skillet to high.  Lightly oil pan with paper towel.  Once hot, reduce heat to medium. Wet both hands and pick up rolled out dough piece and flip from hand to hand to wet it.  Place dough in pan, cover with lid and cook for 30-60 seconds - no butter.  Flip when it gets a little puffy and cook another 20-30 seconds.  Remove, brush with melted butter (I added minced garlic to butter) and sprinkle on some sea salt.  Wrap in tea towel and keep warm until all naan is cooked.  (make sure to oil pan between each piece and when flipping)  I also saw this cooking method on the Food Network site by Aarti who is Indian.

I have never had Naan before, but everyone loved this!  I didn't use minced garlic, but added granulated garlic.  My family devoured it.  Had None left!  Served it with the slow cooker Butter Chicken recipe from this site and the Aloo Gobi and Basmati Rice (also from this site).  My Indian themed meal was a huge success!

I have never made naan and had a craving for it, so I searched recipes until I found one that I had all the ingredients all ready at hand.  I had intentions of only making half and in my absent mindedness, that only made it as far as 1/2 a packet of yeast. I still used a full cup of water along with everything else. I ended up only using around 3 cups of flour +- for kneading/rolling and I only used 2 tablespoons of almond milk. Only because that was the only milk product I had.   I also added a teaspoon of baking soda.  After an hour of letting it rise, I kneaded in 1/2 teaspoon of minced garlic and a sprinkle of garlic powder and did 2-3 different pinches of dough to combine them into their individual balls like someone had suggested to make them bubbly.   After 30 minutes, I partially clarified butter and added minced garlic to it.   I fried them in a sauté pan with a little vegetable oil as well because butter has such a low burn temp. They were just like pancakes, when you start to see bubbles, flip them.  I took a picture, but I have no idea where they show up on here, this is my first time, but it's the one with the 2 pieces on a purple bowl with some super quick, frozen vegetables, 2 tomatoes and spicy red curry paste, dish. I love this recipe. Mine are slightly chewy, a little airy and the perfect density to hold up to saucy dishes and no silverware.

I love this version of this recipe with less flour (4 1/2 cups must be a typo). I have done this recipe several times now in my bread machine and it is soooo easy and so good. I don't use packets of yeast in my bread machine. Therefore, I use 2 t. of bread machine yeast. 3 1/3 - 3 1/2 cups of bread flour. For the bread machine I prepare the dry mixture first (flour, salt and mix together) for the wet mixture I use HOT water and mix in the sugar, and add the milk. Then pour the wet into bread machine first, add dry mixture on top, make a well in the center and add the yeast. I start the machine (dough setting) and once things are mixing together a bit, I add the beaten egg to the center, close the lid and let the machine do the rest of the mixing and rising. When done, I turn the dough out onto flour and cut into 12 equal pieces. Roll out into 7-8" rounds like tortillas (no need to pinch into two balls). I place the first 4 on a platter separate each layer until all rolled out. Cover with another layer of parchment and a towel. Let rise for 30 min. Start grill, cook each side for 1-2 minutes. They will bubble and get some grill marks, flip. Done! They are quick, easy. Your hands-on time will be measuring (10 min) and rolling (15-20 min). The rest is passive time.

Great naan, even though I cheated.  I used the exact recipe, but threw everything  in my bread machine on manual.  When it had gone through the second kneading cycle, I took the dough and continued as directed.  When it was ready to cook I pulled the dough into rectangles and cooked them in my cast iron skillet on the stove. The bread came out looking and tasting exactly like the Naan served at my local Indian restaurant  Any recipe that's so forgiving and tasty deserves 5 stars.

UPDATED 1/1/2014: This recipe has replaced our other naan recipe in our Family Favorites cookbook! I use an additional 1 tsp yeast (3-1/4 tsp yeast total), yogurt in place of the milk, add 1/2 tsp baking soda, and use 4 cups flour- all in the bread machine.  Let yeast, water, and sugar proof about 10 minutes before adding remaining ingredients.  We roll out and let rise for at least 10 minutes before cooking.  We love the flavor, the texture with the changes we made, and the ease of preparing such a large quantity.  With these changes, increasing to 5 stars! Thanks Mic for posting, and other reviewers for sharing your tips!
ORIGINAL:  I tried this after realizing I didn't have yogurt to use in our usual naan recipe.  I mixed it in the bread machine, using buttermilk, 4 cups flour, and adding 1/2 tsp baking soda.  We didn't use the garlic this time, but it sounds great.  I cooked them in an iron skillet.  The first naan I cooked was more pancake-like and tough.  I rolled all the other pieces out and let them rest before cooking, and they had a better texture.  In future, I will roll them all out for the final rise before cooking.
My family said they liked this texture much better than our usual recipe- it's thinner and less bread-y.  We'll definitely be making this our go-to naan recipe from now on.  The bread machine does most of the work, it makes a nice quantity, and it tasted good.  I will be tweaking it to try to get a more tender texture, and will update later.

Wonderful recipe. Made the dough in my bread maker. Substituted yogurt for milk and only used 4 cups of flour.   I cooked them on my cast iron skillet and they were delicious!

Delicious. We used the suggestions from some other reviews to add 1/2 tsp of baking soda to the dough. We cooked ours on the stovetop on a grill pan. Medium-high heat worked best to get some bubbles going, but be prepared for the butter to get pretty smoky with the heat that high. We refrigerated a number of the dough balls for two days and they still worked perfectly to roll out and cook up, so that would be a great place to stop for make-ahead prep if having company or if you want to be able to cook them up fast on a weeknight.

Giving full score because it deserves it - but I do make changes. Someone said to add 1/2 ts baking soda - works great to make bubbles. Also, substitute natural yoghurt for milk if you happen to have some. Since I'm cooking for only two, I need to save the dough in the fridge so I don't knead the garlic into the dough. Instead, I add the garlic and chopped coriander to the butter. I roll the loaves as thin as I possibly can, place them on a greased baking tray, spread some butter mix on top and whack them on top shelf in the oven under the grill of about 2-3 mins. This works for both thinner and thicker styles of naan. They look MARVELLOUS, all yellowy, bubbly and weird. But BEWARE - do not be silly and use a paper sheet as this will catch on fire under the grill. But, as my darling boyfriend told me, 'ANY idiot should understand THAT much'... *blushing*... The house still stands, and the naan was fab! Check out the pick posted today. Xx

This is seriously the best bread you will ever eat!  I use my Kitchen Aid mixer so I don't have to knead the dough and add the garlic before the first rising so I don't have to knead it later.  Lazy, I know but it works!  Fabulous on the grill and it also freezes well.  I thaw out what I need and reheat on my panini grill in the kitchen.  Only add as much flour as you need so it pulls away from the mixing bowl - I didn't use all that was called for in the recipe.  I also added half the sugar because otherwise it's too sweet.  Absolutely foolproof recipe!

this recipe was delicious! i used regular all purpose flour and sifted it as i added it to the yeast mix. also, i only used 3.5 cups flour and added 1 tbsp sugar to the yeast and warm water before adding the rest of the ingredients. instead of kneading the garlic into the dough i added it to the melted butter. i also cooked it in a regular fry pan over medium heat instead of a grill, then kept the cooked naan warm in the oven. delicious!!

Very tasty. It made a lot of bread so it can definitely be halfed if you don't want lots. I found 4 cups of flour was more than enough. I used a frying pan and low heat.

close to our favorite east indian restaurant, but would be so much better if I had a tandoori!  Brush with some garlic butter and be sure to roll out thin so that it bubbles.  Cook on a cast iron pan is the best way or a griddle not a grill!

This is a great recipe. I made it in my bread machine but "proofed" the yeast first as directed in the original recipe. The original recipe calls for you to add in the flour as needed. I found that 3 and 1/2 cups of flour does the trick in the bread machine. I cooked it on my grill as directed and it turned out great.

I love this recipe, except I bake my Naan on stone ware in an oven. Also I add in some zatar seasoning into the dough before I bake which gives this already great tasting bread a great zingy taste.

excellent recipe. I left out the garlic because  I didn't feel like it, and since I don't own a grill I used a non stick pan on top of the stove - they were very easy to make, and super yummie. will definitely be making these again.

Delicious!  As others said, I added a bit of sugar to the yeast and water and also a 1/2 tsp baking soda to the recipe.  I used a non-stick, grill-style pan on the stove top.  Only needed a minute and a half at medium heat per side.  Great recipe!!

I used my pizza stone heated to 500, and then turned to broiler, to cook the naan.  I was able to cook two at at time for 1 1/2 mins. and brushed them with butter when I pulled them out.  I have made this recipe MANY times, and this is the easiest way to cook them.  GREAT RECIPE!!!  I do not order take out anymore!

Easy recipe.  I will make this again.  Next time I think I will add more garlic.  Notes: heat the water to 112 degrees, add sugar and yeast.  Allow to sit for about 10 minutes.  Add 1.25 cups of flour.  Stir until incorporated.  Add the remaining cup to mixture.  When the remaining cup is added won't incorporate easily.  Pour dough and flour onto countertop.  Knead flour into dough.  After needing for 7 minutes, rub dough with oil and allow to rise.  Turn on over at 200.  Cover bowl with dough and place bowl on one of the back burners.  Dough should double in about 1 hour.  Follow the recipe from here.

All I had in my pantry was all-purpose flour, but this naan still came out wonderful, light, and fluffy.  I got 10 big naan from this.  I made sure to proof my yeast with sugar and I used warm milk.  I also rolled out my dough thin.  I can't wait to see how this will come out with bread flour!

Best naan recipe I've found.  Better than all the Indian restaurants I've been to, too.  These are denser than most and support scoops of food without breaking. I cook these on a cast iron skillet with grill lines (since I don't have a tandoori). I coat on some butter and the minced garlic onto the naan while it is cooking and sprinkle chopped cilantro on top to serve.  Absolute perfection!

Phenomenally good!  I made the dough early this morning and let it rise until about 45 minutes prior to lunch.  Punched it down and added the garlic, formed thirteen balls and let them rise a second time.  Meanwhile I whipped  together a burger recipe.  Lit the grill and cooked the whole lot.  Wow!  I love this bread!  Mrs. and I are on a diet in which together we have lost 130 pounds since January.  This bread won't help matters!  Excellent!  Hoping it keeps well in the freezer.

These were delicious and so easy to make. Like other reviewers I proofed the yeast with some sugar, though I did not find the rising time unusually long (if you are having this problem it may be that a) you are using yeast that is too old or b) you are using traditional vs instant yeast). The Naan is better once it has cooled and sat for awhile; it gets that delightful chewy texture and the flavour from the garlic (should you choose to use it) has time to develop and permeate the bread. I do find that the Naan is missing a certain 'tang' that authentic Indian bread usually has- I may try to use some Ghee (clarified butter)  or yogurt instead of milk in my next batch.

Love this recipe! I made it as written, besides using my indoor electric grill. It's like a little George Foreman. I've made it twice now, with Coconut Curry Beef, and it's been perfect both times.

I've made this several times now and the kids devour it.  It's pretty good for souvlaki or gyro-style sandwich wraps as well.  I just use my larger, well-seasoned cast iron skillet without adding any oil, etc.  It works just fine in the dry skillet.  (I'm not sure you'd get the same bubbling and browning effects with a non-stick skillet, though.)

This is an excellent recipe producing naan breads of restaurant quality.  My tips are as follows:
1.  Don't add all 4 1/2 cups of flour at the beginning; start with 3 and add more to get the right, soft consistency.
2.  Sprinkle with a few onion seeds after rolling and before cooking, and brush with melted ghee to give a more authentic taste.  Press the onion seeds into the dough to stop them falling off!
3.  To cook these breads I use a pizza stone in the oven heated to its maximum temperature.  This is effectively the self-clean program (or broil), raising the temperature above 700 degrees Fahrenheit.  As an original Indian tandoor oven reaches around 800 degrees Fahrenheit it gives that lovely crisp tandoor-tasting bread base while giving you the speckled brown finish.
4.  For a sweet filling, try a Peshwari mixture.  Mix together a can of Almond Paste with a handful of raisins, a handful of shredded coconut (the moist kind not the dry flakes) and a couple of handfuls of ground almonds together.  Take a hand-sized ball of dough, make a well in the middle and add some of the mixture.  Seal in the mixture with dough, pad the dough ball out on the worktop and roll out to form a normal naan shape but being careful not to roll too thin to keep the mixture inside.  Practice makes perfect here!  Sprinkle with onion seeds as normal and bake as normal.  You will not get the same look as a regular, plain naan but you will know when it is done by the color and appearance.
Good luck!

I should have read the reviews that compared these with flattened, sweet dinner rolls.  They aren't bad, but they are not authentic and do not taste like naan.  Will not make again.

delicious and easy.  we rolled the first ones out and they didn't have many bubbles...the second batch i froze after punching down and rolling into balls (flash freeze on baking sheet so they don't stick together, then you can throw them into a ziploc bag).  a few days later i put a couple of dough balls in the fridge to defrost, then let sit out on the counter to rise before dinner.  we just lightly floured our hands and pulled the dough to stretch it, then cooked it on a lightly oiled hot skillet.  it had tons of bubbles and was more tender and like the naan i've had in restaurants.  i wouldn't roll it out again, it was faster to stretch it by hand and the texture was better.  so good we are making it again tonight!

This was insanely good. I made it with some minor additions: 1/4tsp of baking soda as recommended by mjmcilmoyl and 3.5 cups of all purpose as recommended by Tisa A. I added the chopped garlic into the bread right before rolling it out and it was amazing. I also cooked it on a closed George Foreman grill, turning it 45 degrees once, so I got some wonderful crosshatching on the bread. What an awesome idea to use the Foreman! Hats off to whoever discovered this. I brushed it with melted butter and topped it with sesame seeds. This was really, really good. DH polished off three along with the curried lentils I made.

Served this for company and everyone loved it.  I had never made any type of bread with yeast before so I was a little nervous about this.  I read the reviews and "proofed" the yeast/warm water with a tablespoon of sugar in the first step of this recipe.  I didn't have a grill so I tried cooking these several ways.  I found a closed George Foreman grill worked the best.  I didn't add garlic to the dough but instead put it in the butter mixture that you brush on during cooking.  So tasty and slightly sweet to cut the heat in a curry or other indian dish.

It was delicious!!!! I could have eaten the whole thing. I didn't let is rise for quite as long because I was in a hurry and it turned out just fine. I also didn't knead in the garlic, I mixed it with melted butter and brushed it on at the very end. It was AMAZING!

Wow! Followed recipe except used all-purpose flour, &proofed yeast with 1Tbs sugar & warm water before adding other ingredients. Only needed about 4 cups flour, and omitted minced garlic (though it would have been good if I had it on hand). Needed to use oven to help the dough rise. Cooked on electric griddle heated to 375 deg. Taste was spot on and especially good fresh! Next time I might try adding the 1/2 tsp baking soda to create the bubbles as advised below. Froze some of the extra dough for later use. Thanks for the recipe!

My husband could not get enough of this!  I was surprised by the texture of the dough - very elastic and easy to work with.  Instead of grilling, I fried these up on my range.  I served with Yia Yia's Tzatziki sauce and there are no leftovers!

This is wonderful! I'm just getting these out of the oven and am eating them with hummus. I baked them on the second to last shelf in the oven around 500 degrees for about 7-8 minutes. Before baking I covered them in butter and sprinkled wheat germ over them. I learned from an Iranian friend to do it this way and he makes the best naan

Tastes just like the restaurant, but don't use nearly as much flour. 3.5 cups should probably be enough, just add it slow to see.

I'm no naan expert but we liked this. Made this again and decided to try some yogurt in the recipe.  I ended up using the whole 6 oz container of plain, non-fat Greek yogurt and skipped the milk.  Did have to add a bit more flour.  Really good, will make this variation all the time.

This turned out AWESOME! My friend, who is from India, asked me for the recipe!!  I used the griddle on high (as opposed to the grill) and it worked just great. Waited for it to bubble, then flipped it. Made a melted butter/garlic powder mixture to spread on bread before flipping. Yummy! I highly recommend this recipe!

Delicious!  The key to making it the perfect consistency without a tandoor is to cook full heat on a cast iron skillet with some baking soda sprinkled on the outside.

This is the BEST naan bread ever! I used my nonstick pan with raised grill ridges, and I had some beautiful naan bread. Everyone said they tasted really good, and that they looked like something I'd bought. My brother ate three of them! Thanks, will be using this recipe again.  I found I didn't need the oil-it didn't stick to the pan, and when I used oil it made the naan too heavy and greasy. Note: Shake excess flour off the naan breads before grilling-or else you'll have a lot of smoke in the kitchen!

Absolutely the best recipe! I am of Norwegian ancestry, so I just took out my lefse griddle and it worked perfectly! When using the griddle, I found that rolling the dough out very thin worked the best. My three kids were practically burning their little fingers because they could hardly wait for me to take it off the griddle! They LOVED it! Will make this time and again!

Very yummy and easy! You will need to spread the dough out as thin as you can and it will turn out nice and fluffy. I also added about a 1/2 tsp of baking soda. That gave me all those nice bubbles you see in the store bought ones. I will defiantly be making these again!

Really Good Naan.... I substitute one cup of the bread flour with Whole Wheat flour and it had a nice nutty flavor.  Still had good texture and rise.  Warning: be careful trying to butter this while on the grill - the smoke from any dripped burning butter makes a nasty, waxy flavor on the bread.  I wait until its cooked both sides and butter it off the heat with no problem.  This makes a big batch, so I get to the point of rolling it into balls, then freeze what I'm not using today.  Later I defrost at room temp the frozen dough balls, let them rise, then continue as before.  From frozen it is "almost" as good as fresh.  Enjoy!

Mmmm Mmmmmm, this is delicious!!! You wont be disappointed with this naan. I experimented and also having watched the chefs in indian restaurants, when rolling the dough out fold over and over on top of each other, gets those layers in the dough and bubbles better. I also made the dough in the breadmaker and it still came out great....

This is fantastic!  I used the optional minced garlic, and wow!!  It had to rise for about 90 minutes to double in size, so make sure you take that into consideration when making.  We'll definately be having this again and again!

Awesome recipe, the best!  My family of 5 absolutely devour these when I make them, which I am doing again tonight to serve with butter chicken.  I have to at least double the recipe because although my family loves butter chicken they like these even more and they become the main dish rather than an accompaniment.

This was SO GOOD!!!  I proofed the yeast and used all-purpose flour, and 2 1/4 tsp yeast instead of a packet.  I made the naan on our indoor grill and they were fantastic!  Between 6 people, the full batch very quickly disappeared

wow. so amazing and fun to make. it was raining, so i didn't grill. i simply oiled (lightly) a skillet and turned it on med high. about 2 minutes a side. perfect! didnt knead in the garlic. after i made them all, i pre-heated the oven to 300 and buttered them all in a stack and put minced garlic on half. heated in oven for 15 minutes. fabulous. and sprinkled with parsley.

This tasted great!  I made it to go with the chicken tikka masala recipe here on all recipes.  I followed the recipe exactly.  My husband had me cook them on a pizza stone in the oven which gave it a nice consistency and flavor.  They were gone within minutes and my brother-in -law said that it was the best naan he had ever had.  Definitely a keeper.

This naan is easy and delicious.  I mixed and proofed it in my bread machine.  I portion the dough into balls at this point and freeze them. Takes 10 minutes to thaw. Use them for falafel sandwiches. Add rosemary and garlic to the dough to make foccaccia.  My husband wants to try wrapping the dough around cooked hotdogs/bratwurst and then grill like "pigs in blankets".  I also use it for Calzones.  Sub sugar and cinnamon for garlic and make fruit hand-pies.

This is like he says the best naan tasted outside a restaurant, perhaps even better then a restaurant. Everyone loves it and can reheat the next day by sprinkling with a little water, wrapping in foil and putting in oven for a few minutes.   I think its best if after rolling you brush one side with the melted butter, then put that face down to cook. While its browning, brush the upward uncooked side with the butter and when ready flip over.

I was so impressed with this naan!  It was my first attempt at making any kind of kneaded-dough bread, so I was a little intimidated, especially when the dough was so sticky that I had trouble getting it off my hands (this wasn't a problem after the 1 hour rise time).  I think perhaps my problem was that I used "as much flour as needed" as the instructions specify, instead of sticking to the 4 1/2 cups called for in the ingredients list; because I was having trouble getting all the flour absorbed into the dough, I just stopped at about 3 1/2 cups.  Still, it came out great, looked just like the picture, and tasted as good as any naan I've ever had.  Cooking bread on a grill was also just plain fun!

It's really cold outside so I cooked my naan in a grill pan on the stove.  It was wonderful - chewy, moist and flavorful.  I followed the recipe exactly except to add the garlic along with all the other ingredients before the first rise.  Next time I will add another garlicky layer by brushing the naan with melted butter with minced garlic in it.  This recipe is a winner!

Wonderful!!  A hint of sweetness is perfectly paired with most spicy dishes.  Everyone raved about these.  They are also very light and soft.  We ate these with Chicken Tikka Marsala and they were perfect!!

Excellent!  This was so good!  I didn't want to bother with my charcoal grill so I did as one reviewer suggested and cooked them on an open George Foreman grill.  I did half garlic and half plain.  Both were delicious!  I will make this again and again.  Regarding the rising issue that some have:  I make yeast breads all the time, so I know how to proof the yeast, yet I also had an issue with this rising in an hour.  I always use the slightly warm oven technique so I know it was warm enough.  I could tell that it did rise a little, but not anywhere near how big my breads do normally.  Instead of waiting longer to see if it rose more, I just continued on with the recipe.  It turned out wonderfully.  So no worries if it doesn't rise completely to double!  (Though if it has no rise at all, then I would probably redo it.)

Delicious!  Tastes as good as any Indian restaurant.  Make sure to proof the yeast first.  Try adding other ingredients instead of garlic like the restaurants do.  Such as mint naan, sesame seed, etc.

This is a great recipe, and here's a helpful hint for storing your unused naan in the freezer.  We make a whole batch, cook it up in a grill pan, then freeze it.  It is not 100% as good as fresh, but if you are a family of two, it is a great way to have 95% as good as fresh naan for a few weeks.

The best. I cannot believe how easy and amazing this is! I followed the recipe but omitted the garlic and instead cooked ghee together with garlic and drizzled on top.  Also, I lightly oiled my pan and heated to medium high.  I put in the naan and immediately covered with a lid for about a minute and it got bubbly and perfect.  Flipped it and then did the same - they were better than anything I have had in an Indian restaurant!

We love these. I have cooked them two ways. The first time following the directions exactly. The second time I preheated my oven to 500 degrees and put a few at a time on cooling racks and put the whole thing on the top rack of my oven. It took about 3-4 minutes per batch to bake this way. You are looking for the bread to puff and then you know they are done.  When they came out of the oven I brushed with them with butter. Both ways were fabulous. I will definitely be making these again soon!!

Awesome. I made it in my bread maker, combined all the ingredients (just 3 1/2 cups bread flour like another user suggested) and everything cooked up wonderful.  I used a cast iron griddle and they bubbled up beautifully.  The parts of the bread that were really thin ended up a bit chewy so next time I'll let them be a little thicker in the middle.  Awesome naan, I'll never buy it in the store again.

Wow! These are really excellent. My family LOVED them. I served them with some spicy curries and some cucumber raita and it was a hit. This bread is very easy to make and they cook up very easy. Just a funny side note, I got partway through the recipe and noticed I didn't have any eggs, so I tried making it without the egg. They turned out great anyway....soft, chewy and delicious! So, if you don't have egg or are allergic and still want to make this recipe, it works! I added garlic to the dough and then added garlic to some melted butter and brushed them with the buttery garlic. Just amazing! Thanks for this easy and incredibly tasting recipe!

outstanding. Took a couple hours to rise, rather than the 1 hour suggested by the recipe.  We grilled the naan in a hot, well-oiled non-stick grill pan - came out perfectly.

plan for twice the time for rising. And yes, don't forget to add the sugar to the yeast and water (~1 TBLSPN?). My leftover dough sat in  a bowl in the ove (turned off) covered with a moist towel all night by mistake. Whoops! There was finally dough that had risen. Who knew. I fried it up and it was delic! Better than the day before b/c i never got the first batch to rise. Im sure this is not the way to do things, but either way it was delicious.

After reading the reviews, I added 1/2 ts of baking soda. I also cooked them on a nonstick skillet with a lid. These were wonderful. The only change I will make next time is decrease the sugar to about a tablespoon. Now I have a great bread to go with my curries. Thanks

This was the best Naan I have ever tasted. The only thing I changed was I used a little extra garlic and I sprinkled some curry over the dough before kneading in the garlic.  My husband and I both loved it and so did my six year old daughter.  She said it was the best bread she's ever tasted. My husband said, "You could start your own business with this stuff."

Love this recipe! It has take a few tries for my boyfriend and I to master it but wow, they really are great. Last night I added 1/2 teaspoon of baking powder as suggested by some reviewers and it made them even better! As many others have said, the thinner you get them, the more authentic the texture. For the light chewyness that you find with restaurant Naan, I found it best to barely let them brown at all. Just let them get slighly brown on one side and only just bubble up on the other side. Also used the Garlic Butter recipe and brushed on one side after flipping...AMAZING! 

Thank you for this!

I've misplaced my naan recipe so tried this one. My other one was so much better. This was too heavy and tasteless despite my doubling the garlic.

Time consuming but well worth it! Not really comparable to naan at restaurants I like, but good in itself. Used george foreman to grill. Used the Indian Chicken I recipe as dip - added my own alterations of curry powder. Freezing the extra dough - hopefully it will be as good next time around!

Great recipe with consistent results. I reduce the sugar by 2 Tbsps since the first batch seemed a little sweet. The naan freezes well so I make a double batch and freeze some for later.

YUM! I just made these and they are SOOOO good! The only change for me was to omit the garlic, and I am without a grill right now, so I baked them at 500*F on a pizza stone for about 3-4 minues each. They are perfect!! Thanks!

These were nothing like traditional Indian naan bread. Even though it didn't taste like the naan at the Indian restaurant, it was really good.  I didn't have a grill, so I used a frying pan, which worked just fine.  The thinner you roll it, the crispier it will be.  The recipe made 18 pretty big pieces, so I will make half next time.  Also, this is NOT a quick and easy recipe, so plan accordingly.

I let my bread maker do all the work so this Naan bread was easy to make.  It makes A LOT (I got about 16 medium sized Naan) so I will probably half the recipe next time...Will definately make this every time we have Indian food.

This is very good!  Thanks for the recipe.  I screwed it up a bit.  Didn't read it correctly and put the garlic and the melted butter in the dough all at the same time.  Turned out just fine, although I don't think I'll put the butter in the dough again, as it adds a lot of extra calories!  Bf didn't seem to think there was enough garlic; told me liked the garlic naan better.  Had to tell him there was garlic in it!  More next time, I suppose!

Wow. Now I've never been to an Indian restaurant, so I can't speak to the authenticity of this recipe -- but it sure does make some tasty, tasty bread. Even my ultra super picky kids love it. YUM.

Since I'm pretty cautious about new recipes I made a half-batch, which made 8 rounds that are about 6" in diameter. I added 1/4 teaspoon of baking powder, and sauteed the garlic in oil as other reviews had suggested, instead of kneading it into the dough. 

This is absolutely a keeper.

Really wonderful chewy texture~Instead of adding the minced garlic to the dough, I sauteed some in olive oil and brushed that on the bread as I baked it! It is also fabulous cut into wedges served with hummus!  Thanks!!

Great recipe, one top tip: Instead of grilling the Naan, try turning a quality/ heavy based gridle or frying pan upside down on the hob, spray with a little oil. heat up to a high heat and cook the naan on for 2 - 3 mins each side. The tinner they are the more they bubble they come out. Very Authentic!Lovely!

It was a very forgiving recipe! I didn't have time to proof everything nice and slow, so I proofed everything on top of the oven.  I doubled the recipe, used about 1T of dried garlic, used yogurt instead of milk and portioned each ball around 2oz.  I will suggest one thing, the water portion to yeast is alot. When you are blooming the yeast and want to see it bubble/frothy use a smaller portion of water to bloom the yeast and then add it back with the other liquid ingredients.

This is SO good, and even though it's "indian flatbread" it goes great with a variety of meals!! Also despite the recipe calling for it to be cooked on a grill ( which is traditional, and i think adds to the flavor) it can so easily be made on a grill pan or i like to use and egg pan; makes the perfect size and shape! Sugesstion: alot of other reveiwers said that the recipe called for too much flour, first time i made this i cut it down to 3 cups,that was not enough flour, the dough came out really wet, 3 and half cup seems to work perfect!

Oh, I love naan! I found that the sizes didn't work out - if I used the recommended size balls, I wound up with very small pieces of naan. I wound up flattening baseball-sized balls and those turned into nice sized naan. Definitely puffed up deliciously. I buttered each side with olive oil mixed with crushed garlic, which made them super delicious. Used an open George Foreman Grill and that worked spectacularly.

This is so easy, and makes really cheap meals like Lentil and Chickpea curry seem so much luxurious.  I always serve my curries with a selection of chutneys and mint yoghurt sauce.

These were so fun to make!  I don't have a grill, so I just used a dry skillet on high heat and it worked very well. I know the taste is probably better using a grill but you make do!  I rolled as thin as I could and they still puffed up a lot, even getting bubbly.  I could cook 3 at a time on the skillet.  I used half white whole wheat flour in these, and brushed them with butter when they were done cooking.  This recipe was really easy to make- I thought all the rolling/cooking would be difficult but it really wasn't.  It was fun, and very satisfying.  ;)  I'm wanting to try it with a grill.

The naan was delicious!  We weren't able to get the bubbles to come up on the bread like we like, but cooking it in a skillet seemed to be best.  (We tried a countertop style panini grill first, but it didn't allow the bread to rise enough.)  Next time we will try the gas grill for cooking.  Mix some ghee with garlic and brush it on after the bread is cooked.  Garnish with parsley.  We pureed a can of chickpeas with salt, pepper, a little fresh lemon juice, and a tbsp of olive oil.  This makes a healthy and yummy spread for the bread.

This was delicious! Based on other reviews, I added the garlic to the butter you brush on the tops. I don't have a grill so I used a non-stick skillet and that worked fine.

Despite my few mix ups, this recipe turned out great! For me that is an indicator of a great recipe!!! I missed the cue to "proof" the yeast, so my dough didn't rise fully, and I didn't roll them out as thin as they should have been. They ended up being a bit thicker and chewier bread, but even still, very delicious! I added the garlic to the butter and brushed it on instead of kneading it in, and added a bit of sea salt. I also found medium low heat was best

My new fav recipe! I love it!! Thanks for posting this. 
a couple things: 
1. Don't grill it, use a electric skillet instead
2. add baking powder (1/2 tsp)
3. mix garlic powder in with the dough on the 2nd kneed
4. you only need to place on the skillet for a min or two, dont worry about it not being done in the middle, it will be!

This was a big hit at my middle eastern party.  I used whole wheat flour and cooked them on my ovens highest heat right on the grates. they didn't stay flat that way because some drooped over the grates, but they still cooked well and tasted great. I would still recommend cooking that way if you don't have a grill handy. After brushing with butter and wrapping in foil they stayed warm and yummy for a long time. Everyone said it was their favorite thing, guess i should have found a better curry recipe!  Thanks for this will make again.

This recipe really surprised me despite all the good reviews I was skeptical for some reason. Well I was very wrong. This was sooo delicious.  I couldn't even believe how good they turned out. I took it to an Indian dinner party and no one believed I made them. I followed renatob suggestions by adding 1/2t soda and I cooked them in a skillet on medium heat with a lid. 2 minutes on the first side and 1 minute in the flip side. AMAZING. I am making this recipe again today. Thanks for a wonderful recipe.

AMAZING! I never thought in a million yrs I'd be making naan and that it would turn out soo good. This is an excellent recipe and it is delicious. I added the garlic to the hot butter and brushed the naan with it. Next time I will add sesame seeds on the top when cooking!

I have never tried making naan before. I stumbled into this recipe and decided to try it out. I prepared it without the garlic. It was an absolute delight!
The dough did not rise to double in 1 hour, but I carried on with it with a good level of skeptiscism. I rolled the naans out and put it inder the grill to make nice fluffy naans. My 3 year old daughter absolutely loved it. I think this recipe is greaat. Reccommended!

These were totally yummy, in fact I've just eaten 6 in one go! I didn't bother with adding the yeast to the warm water first, just added it to the rest of the dry ingredients and it worked just fine.

Delicious! One of my first experiences making a yeast bread, and it came out great. Unlike some other people who tried this recipe, I think I ended up using all 4 1/2 cups of flour, possibly even more. I'm not sure what causes this difference. I also let it rise longer than stated (almost 2 hrs for the first rise - I fell asleep!), but the house was cold anyway, so it was probably better that I did that. I "grilled" the naan in a non-stick skillet on the stove over med-high heat. I also left out the garlic because I was feeling lazy, and now I'm kicking myself! After tasting the naan, I KNOW it would've been fantastic with garlic. The only downside is that this easily makes enough for a family of 4-6 and I live by myself. It should be eaten as soon as possible, because it doesn't keep very well.

This was so good, I love Indian but have always been dissapointed with homemade naan. This was awesome, I made it on the George Foreman grill since it was cold outside.  It takes a bit of time but will make the meal.

This recipe was great!! I used my breadmaker to mix and proof the dough. I added 3 tablespoons of yogurt as well. Definitely in my recipe book.

Wow this was delicious!  I had this and Chicken Marakesh as my first attempt at making (and eating!) Indian food.  A little time consuming with the rolling, and I had to turn the grill down to medium to prevent burning, but this was delicious!

This was every bit as good as restaurant Naan.  I used a cast iron grill pan on my stove and it turrned out great.  It is time consuming though.  As I was preparing it I wondered if it would be worth it....It sure was!!

this bread was so good. I used all prpose flour and instead of brushing it with butter i brushed it with olive oil. I also added the garlic in with the first mixing of the dough while it was kneading in my kitchen aid. I used the broiler in the oven to cook them. They turned out so delicious. I served the naan with chicken souvlaki kabobs, ceasar salad and tzikiki to dip it in. I will definatly be making this recipe again!!

I followed the recipe to the letter, and it came out perfectly.  My kids totally loved it.  The bread was soft, puffed perfectly, and was delicious with chicken curry, vegetable curry, and cholay.  Thanks for putting this one out here!

Pretty good - not like resturant Naan of course (if its not cooked in a tandoor you will never get that taste) - was too sweet for my liking but the family enjoyed.  I didnt put the garlic in the dough - I brushed the breads with melted butter & garlic.

I like this recipe and the naan turned out very well. I placed my pizza stone on my charcoal grill and preheated the grill really hot. Since naan is usually made in a tandoor (indian clay oven) I thought this would more accurately reproduce the cooking conditions. In a tandoor, the dough is stuck onto the side of the oven and it is done when it peels itself off. I flipped the naan when the thin parts started to look dark brown. It turned out fantastic, crispy at the thin areas, chewy at the thicker places.

Very good recipe! I added less sugar and a little bit more garlic (personal preference). Definitely use a grill or a griddle or they wont bubble.

This is really good Naan!  I think the secret is rolling it out as thin as you can.  It's got a delicious flavor.  I used a heavy flat griddle that sits on top of my stove burner.  I let it get good and hot, brushed it with melted butter, and the Naan cooked up nicely.  It developed the bubbles and everything!

I will definitely make this again and again!  Everyone in my family loved it.  My 5 year old daughter wanted to eat it, and nothing else, for dinner.

Naan is not available at my grocery store so I decided to try to make it.  This didn't taste like naan at all...more like mediocre dinner rolls that had been flattened.  Definitely not worth the work.  I would have been better off buying a package of pitas.

Sorry, I too am wondering why there are so many good ratings/reviews for this recipe. The dough was hard (and I used only 3 1/2 cups of flour as suggested. Also, the dough was WAY to salty. Very dissapointing! : (

My local Indian restaurant told me that naan cannot be made successfully without a special oven but this one comes very close to theirs!  It could be habit forming! I didn't grill it in the below freezing temps here but baked them on baking stones at 425 F. for 5-7 minutes.

This is awesome, the best recipe for naan I've ever tried.  It really has to be eaten right away, though... I'm never able to save it for later, it doesn't seem to keep well.

Man oh man!  I've been looking for a naan recipe that works for YEARS - we eat Indian food about 2-3 times a week.  My husband LOVED it and I've been e-mailing it all over the world.  Yum!

Pretty good!  I halved the sugar, based on some of the other reviews.  Cooked them on a dry stainless steel skillet over medium heat.  Took some experimentation to find the right cooking time, but they came out pretty good, regardless.  Also omitted the garlic and the melted butter.

Dissappointing.  Read all the reviews and really had high hopes.  I grilled mine; it looked great, bubbled nicely, the texture was great.  Tasted bad.  Too sweet!  Did NOT taste like restaurant naan. I'll try it again with less sugar.  Good start.

I made these to go with steak and salad in place of the usual garlic bread.  They were easy to make and turned out great. I cooked them in a well-seasoned iron skillet and was pleased with the rise and color. In fact, we were eating them as fast as I could cook them!  Very yummy.

Let me start with:  I'd never tasted naan before, and I'd never made bread before, so this comes from a total newbie to this kind of baking!  I used fresh, quick-rising yeast, which made it confusing to follow the instructions on the package (don't dissolve in water) and the recipe (DO dissolve in water).  So I just mixed all the ingredients at once, with no proofing.  I waited about 45 minutes for the dough to rise each time, but it never did quite double in size, and that was sitting on a hot furnace vent!  So I don't know if I did all this correctly, but the final result was pretty tasty.  I cooked each piece over medium heat for about one minute per side, which seemed to be plenty of time.  It's a lot of work, but I'll probably do it again next time we have Indian food.  My only real problem was with freezing it, as mentioned in other reviews -- maybe it's me, but my dough balls came out pretty rough after freezing, and the bread was a little too chewy.

This is an amazingly delicious recipe! I substited soy milk for regular because I am lacose-intolerant, and it turned out beautifully, without that grey soy coloring.  I also grilled the naan with olive-oil instead of butter- incredible!  This is a recipe I will use regulary.

for some reason I could not get this to work, I don't think my grill gets hot enough.  They just turned hard and didn't brown.  After the first few didn't work I rolled the rest and baked it as a regular loaf of bread; it turned out delicious so I guess it's a good recipe if you manage to cook it properly

So good! They tasted very authentic and so nice! The dough did make a lot, so if you are just cooking for two people, you might need to half the measurements - that said, we are going to put ours in the freezer for next time! The only amendment I made was to reduce the sugar to just one tablespoon - the measurements included seemed to be more sugar than necessary, and as it was, it was just perfect! Highly recommend!

Simple and quick.  I did not do a second rise.  Just used fingers to press out thin.  Brushed with garlic butter and fried in a non-stick skillet, brushing other side with butter as well.  Served with stuffed bell peppers.

Made this twice now and it's been a hit! We rolled it super thin and it comes out almost crisp on the edges... Was still delicious but will try rolling it thicker next time to make it more like the pic.

Amazing recipe. Fresh, puffy, the garlic is a must for the great taste we had...Better than restaurants that's for sure!

Naan is awesome!  This recipe worked well.  Used KitchenAid mixer - sticky dough, but workable with extra flour.  A lot of work, but worth every second.  Family and friends raved for days!  Adding to my repertoire:)

Amazing... So proof the yeast in warm water and sugar for 10 minutes, I put metal bowl from my 
Kitchenaid in a warm oven with a damp dish cloth over it.  Used about 3.5 cups of the flour and the other ingredients with the dough hook, then a few minutes of kneading by hand to make a nice smooth, soft dough.  Back into the warm oven, in a well oiled bowl, covered with a damp dish cloth for an hour. Punch it down, cut it, and shape and form like you would for buns, into large golf ball buns, cover with damp dish towel.  Let rise in warm top oven, while bottom oven with baking stone is preheating to 500 degrees, for 30 minutes. Roll double size balls as thin as possible, one or two at a time, wet hands, and place on hot stone for about 1 or two minutes per side.....

My son loves flatbread warmed with Greek spices and feta cheese served warm.  He was begging me to make some and I didn't have any naan from the store so I decided to try to make my own.  I'm glad I did.  My family loved them!!!!  I proofed the yeast, cut down the amount of sugar, used sour cream (no plain yogurt at home), and made them on the baking stone in my oven.  Will definitely be making these again ... Today in fact ??

These are amazing - not to mention addicting!  I have never made Naan before, but this is a "keeper" to quote my husband.  I took the advice of others, and to bring about more bubbles, I grabbed small amounts of dough (4-5 pieces at a time) to make each golf ball sized roll.  I had bubbles aplenty without the baking soda.  Did I mention how easy these are?  Granted, I did use my bread machine and didn't have to worry about how my yeast was going to work.  Just follow the bread machine instructions for the dough setting.  YUM!

I am new to yeast recipes, but I made a late night trip to pick up a jar of it just so I could make this.  I had some flatbread when I was deployed to Iraq, and it was so good I bought a huge stack before I left the restaurant.  I made this exaclty as written but omitted the garlic, and ended up eating them right out of the pan (a cast iron grill pan on medium-low heat) and really had to force myself to stop eating more and save some for the rest of the family.  I'll be making this again often.

Totally amazing.  I made this in my bread machine on the dough cycle and waited for it to rise and punch down, then I just unplugged the machine and removed the dough ball before tearing it into the golf-ball sized pieces.  Best naan I have ever had, hands down! I recommend rolling them all out before grilling, as they cook up very quickly.

I made this in my bread maker and it was great. Finally a naan close to what my favorite Indian restaurant makes. I didn't have any milk so I substituted 1 and a 1/2 TB of sour cream and thinned it with the same amount of water. I also reduced the amount of flour to 3 and 1/2 cups and used all purpose flour. Also added 1/2 tsp of baking soda. Put it in my bread maker on dough setting. I put the ingredients in as follows. First was the water, sour cream mixture,egg,flour and baking soda,reduced sugar to 1/8 cup, salt and the pkg of yeast. After the cycle was completed on the machine, made 14 balls and let rise for 30 minutes. Roll balls into a oval shape and cooked in on medium heat of an cast iron skillet till crispy. Enjoy!

Made as described except used about 1/2 tsp garlic powder and used 4 cups of flour in the dough - with remaining 1/2 cup for rolling. Delicious!

Made this tonight with some chicken vindaloo. I made it on a grill pan as it was raining outside. Didn't matter. This bread was phenomenal. It was hard not to eat it as it came off the pan.

My only regret is that I cannot eat these every day.  They're that good.  Now, they're not hugely easy to make, but they're also not difficult.  It's more the timing than the actual difficulty that makes this a drawn-out affair.  But it's worth it.  I split the batch into three--plain, garlic, and mint.  All delicious, with garlic being my favorite.  I cooked these over medium-high heat in pans (one regular frying pan, one cast iron) on the stove, and did not use the brushed-on butter.  They burned a little (maybe I'll try lowering the heat next time), but were incredible still.  They were charming and delicious and filling.

These were very tasty! I did add a teaspoon of baking powder and reduced the sugar to 1 heaping tablespoon.  Cooked them on a dry cast iron skillet, used only about 3 1/2 cups flour and ghee instead of melted butter.

I thought this was really good. We didn't know what bread flour was so we just did AP flour and whole wheat flour. It was fine anyway.

Excellent...with caveats. I had to make a couple of compromises that may have actually improved the overall result. Firstly, I ran out of bread flour at three cups so I had to sub a cup and a half of AP. Also my yeast was a little sluggish to start, so I added about one tbs of the sugar while blooming the yeast. I also allowed two hours for the initial rise in my microwave oven - off, of course - with a cup of boiled water beside the bowl to keep the temperature up. My resultant Naans were, in my opinion, perfect consistency. The AP probably helped them not be quite so rubbery. Still elastic, mind you, but they didn't snap back and slap you in the face! The trick to cooking them is thin, thin, thin. I started with tangerine/lime sized balls, let them swell to small orange size and rolled them out to about 10" - 11" diameter near...ish circles. I got ten out of this recipe. Slap them on a very hot grill after very lightly spraying each side. I used Parkay for a slight buttery taste. With them that thin, they'll bubble up and be done in about 60-90 seconds on each side. You want the grill marks dark brown but the bread still white. You can tell when to turn them as they'll stiffen enough to turn them with tongs.
Being a limey ex-pat and my favorite all time food being English style Indian kebabs, these naans were about as close to what my memory serves. Next time, I'm going to try cooking them in my homemade Tandoor!

Really good, but a little lengthy to make.  There were really chewy when reheated, but I kind of like a little fight from my food when I'm not eating meat!  I just piled on the leftovers & that helped to soften them a bit.  I'll probably experiment with keeping the raw dough in the fridge & cooking them off later in the week as needed.

Excellent Naan bread! I made this in my bread machine reducing the amount of bread flour to 
3 1/2 cups as others have suggested. I dissolved the yeast in the warm water as instructed and let sit for 10 minutes. I then added the additional wet ingredients to the yeast/water mixture and poured into bread machine pan. I poured the dry ingredients on top and set the machine to dough cycle. After the dough cycle was complete I made into balls and let rise until doubled in size. Someone posted to roll out as thin as possible so the bread would bubble and cook properly but I would not do that again. The ones that were a bit thicker were much nicer in texture and more tender. I cooked the Naan on my griddle rather than the grill (it was raining outside) and they turned out fabulous. The recipe made 21 pieces which I laid flat on cookie sheets and put in the freezer for about an hour. Removed and stacked in freezer bags (pre-freezing prevents them from sticking together) and returned to the freezer. They freeze and thaw out beautifully. The taste and texture is the same out of the freezer and thawed, as it was fresh off the griddle. Great recipe!

I don't think I've ever had naan, so I have nothing to compare it to. I know the family liked it, and that's what is important, but... I thought it tasted like pizza crust. Not that pizza crust is bad, just not what I was imagining. I'm sure I'll make it again, but maybe try the baking soda?

Great recipe. I will use this from now on...no more frozen naan for us! I wish I had this recipe a long time ago. I followed others advice and put a tbsp of sugar in with the yeast. Dough rose perfectly, no problems at all.

I love this recipe, I found it easy to follow the recipe and the Naan tastes even better than shop bought. I'll be using this recipe often and the good thing was I froze the leftover dough and used it for another batch later that week and it turned out great.

I made this bread last night for my husband & I, if it tells you anything it's almost gone today! I added 1/2 tsp of baking powder. I tried cooking it on the stove and didn't like the results. So I cooked it at 500 f. in the oven and it bubbled up beautifully and made wonderful little naans, MUCH better than on the stove. I will definitely be making these again.

Great naan... we also added the baking soda per the suggestion of another reviewer to achieve a bubblier bread.

Excellent as is! Don't roll it out too thin, just use your fingers, and definitely use butter. I tried olive oil for the first few and didn't like it as much.

It was time consuming (getting the bread to rise) but other than that...the recipe was very simple and VERY TASTY results. I will definitely make this again.

I made the Coconut Curry Chicken from this site and needed to have something alongside so I made this. I put all the ingredients including an extra 1/2 tsp of baking soda in my Panasonic bread maker. It came out SO well. I kneaded it with a little flour when it was ready and shaped them into little balls. I let the balls rise for about 10 minutes then flattened them out and pan fried them in butter. It did resemble a pancake kind of taste but they were so good and my fiance wanted to take some to work right after we ate lol. Mine did not bubble but either way they were very good.

Very good. I only used 3 cups of all purpose flour (plus 1/2 cup for the kneading surface) but we live in a dry climate. Cooking on the BBQ went well but it took longer than 2-3 minutes a side, after cooking I put in our oven warming drawer on med-high for about 20 minutes ... Dough was a little sweeter than I would have liked, and after it cooled it was quite hard ... not good for leftovers, but it was good fresh.

This turned out very well.  I made a double recipe for a small get together and found I had to much so I froze the dough in small balls and put them in a plastic bag when they were hard. Now when I want some naan for dinner I pull a couple out, put them in a air tight container and set them on the counter for the day.  They are ready to grill in the evening and come out looking great!

I made this as written. I found it too sweet, so next time I will reduce the sugar. It seemed too dry with the amount of flour, but came out okay. I will probably reduce the flour a little next time, just to see. And, I will probably experiment with the baking soda suggestions, to see how that works.

Really delicious and easy to make. I followed recipe and it cooks easily on the grill and in a regular oven on a pizza stone. Next time maybe less sugar due to personal taste.I gave it four because there is a particular indian restaurant in my area that serves the most outstanding naan.

This turned out to be an amazing soft naan! I added a little bit of plain yogurt and olive oil after the yeast had been proofed, and the result was a wonderful soft bread. Thanks!

My wife loves Naan but living in Minnesota it's no easy feat to find good Naan in a restaurant. This Naan recipe was full of flavor and went deliciously with the curry I made as well. My wife was very pleased and surprised to see one of her favorite dishes when she got home from work!

This is the very best naan I have ever made. Everyone that has tried it raves about it. My husband said it is better than the naan at the Indian restaurant that we go to. The only change I made is cooking it on a cooking stone at 550 degrees. It cooks to a golden brown without any burning as seen in the naan we get at the restaurant.

I used the converter and made a recipe for 28 servings. I used whey that I had leftover from making cheese in place of the water. I also used a 60/40 mixture of 60% fresh ground hard white wheat berries to 40% King Arthur bread flour. I mixed the dough up in a Bosch mixer and then let it rise til doubled in a seaperate bowl. I scaled my dough at 8 oz (I wanted very large naan breads) and it yielded 8-8oz dough balls. I did not use a grill though. Rather I pre-heated my over to 500F along with a large baking stone. I cooked each naan for about 3 minutes under the broiler. The rack was in the middle of the oven btw. The bread was beaultiful and absolutely perfect!!!! I will definitely be using this again and may in the future do a complete whole grain version with fresh milled hard white wheat berries.

This is a fantastic recipe.  As with others' suggestions, I added 1/4 tsp. baking soda and rolled the bread out very thin.  I was too lazy to fire up the grill at -40 degrees (Canada), so I pan fried in a non stick pan .  Lightly brushed both sides of the naan with ghee butter .  Turned out fantastic!  Thanks for the recipe.  I will never buy store bought naan again!

Wonderful!  I had extra dough (in golf ball form) that I threw in the fridge covered with cling wrap, and grilled them for breakfast the next day.  Best ham, egg and cheese EVER!  (I used my cast iron ribbed griddle)  The risings both took substantially longer to really do their thing, so be aware it is easier to give yourself more time and throw the dough in the fridge to stop rising than it is to try to speed it up.  Not so fun when dinner is on the table, but the naan is stil rising.  Thanks for sharing this recipe...I have made it twice in the last week!  SO good!

BEST NAAN EVER!! We were shocked how good this homemade naan tasted!! an absolute must try!!!

I couldn't get hold of ghee so i made with butter. I kneaded garlic into the dough, fried in a pan with butter and garlic powder. it came out beautifully!!

Super easy and delicious.  I used regular all-purpose flour and while I couldn't tell the difference, others who eat naan on a more regular basis might want to stick w/ bread flour to avoid disappointment.  I cooked the naan in the oven at 500 degrees and it worked well, but the heat from the oven while basting the bread in butter burned my hands pretty bad.  Oven mitts as opposed to potholders would fix this.

Great recipe and will probably turn out better with a little practice. I fried them on a nonstick frying pan since we don't have our grill going and they came out very well. I used 1 cup of whole wheat flour and it added just a touch of flavor and whole grain. I wish I'd remembered to put in the garlic and to brush it all with butter...but even so, they were yummy and a great addition to our Indian dinner. (My 6 year old loved dipping it in the spinach dal-- his first time for both and he thought it was great!)

Thank you, thank you, THANK YOU!!  Second time I've made it to eat with my pumpkin curry I'm most recently addicted to.  I just can NOT eat curry without Naan!!  I also found it took much more than an hour to double in size each time I made it, but I wasn't in a rush, so it worked out fine.  My babysitter stumbled upon some of this in the fridge, ate it, and thought I had bought it at an Indian restaurant! I can't thank you enough for this recipe!!  :)

This stuff is incredible. It's hard to believe that such simple ingredients can create something that tastes like this. This was my first experience with naan, so I don't know how this compares to others, but I do know my family kept going back for seconds and thirds even after we were stuffed!

We adore this recipe!  Everyone in the family -- including the baby, who can barely eat solid food -- loves this naan.  This recipe makes enough for 2 full meals' worth of bread, but we usually snack on it so much between meals that we end up with nothing remaining by the time the next meal rolls around!  We like to eat it with homemade baba ghannouj, with dals and curries, and spread with peanut butter.

Huge hit with dinner tonight!  As previous comments suggested I added 1 Tbsp sugar to the water/yeast mixture.  I used 3 1/2 to 4 cups of self-rising flour and did not add the 2 tsp salt.  I will, without a doubt, make these again!

Great Recipe! made it many times as a substitute to the dry pitas you get at the store for use with Gyros or dipping in freshly made humus.

As I lacked for a grill, I cooked the naan in a pan on the stove. I just put little bit of olive oil in the pan to start and the butter keep things well in order throughout. On medium heat, I found that they cooked perfectly fluffy at 90 seconds on each side. I have been making pitas at home for some time, but I will have to add this to my library.

I've made this several times now.  Since trying out the original recipe, I've made some changes and think it's even better.  The changes I've made are:  I used buttermilk and garlic powder (1 tsp) instead of their listed counterparts.  As well, I added a tablespoon of wheat gluten to improve texture.  I've also tried replacing 1/2 tsp of the salt with baking soda.  With or without the baking soda works equally well; I still got the bubble effect.  Lastly, I fried the thinly rolled out dough on a non-stick fry pan (medium to med-low heat) for only about one minute per side until the bread no longer felt like dough when pressed with my finger.  I can get 16 servings from the recipe.  My whole family enjoys this bread, and it's way cheaper to make than to buy it at the store, let alone the restaurant!

My girls (who are naan experts at the age of 9) gave this recipe a thumbs up!  I baked mine in the oven until they puffed, and then put it in a pan with some butter to warm and serve.  I even pan warmed them 1 or 2 days later.  They still loved it.  I did cut back on the sugar since I added some in the proofing.

Awesome Recipe!  My 11 year old son and I made this today and we love it.  We learned that if we rool it super thin then stretch it again before adding to the pan, it gets the bubbles and same texture as the naan we love from our favorite Indian restaurant.

We let our bread machine do all the work as far as kneading went - and will definitely make this again!

Delicious!  Only 1 minor change.  I could tell after the first one that it would be too greasy if I buttered each one.  So I ended up buttering the pan about every 3rd one.  The result was perfect, bubbly, chewy naan.

I love it. Great recipe.
I added a teaspoon of very hot curry powder to the flour and it tastes terrific. My son says he likes it better than the store & restaurant bread.
Great recipe, thank you for posting it.

I screwed a lot of things up in this recipe and they still turned out great.  I needed more bread flour than the recipe called for (the dough was just too sticky to work with until I reached about 5 cups - who knows what I did wrong there).  I also added more flour during the kneading process.  My dough didn't rise after the hour, so I put it in the oven, turned the oven on at the lowest setting for a few minutes, turned it off, and let it rise for another hour.  It doubled in size like it was supposed to.  The second rising went fine (also in the oven - I think my place is just too cold).  I had an impossible time rolling the balls out - due to an interruption, I had them sitting out for about 30 minutes after the second rising before I could cook them so they dried out some.  I ended up using my hands, pizza crust style, to form them into thin tortilla-like rounds.  They still snapped back into place a bit and made the rounds thicker than I wanted, but ultimately that didn't seem to matter at all (they were still thinner than the picture showing at the top of this recipe).  It was pouring rain by the time I needed to start the grill, so I cooked them in a buttered skillet, about 30 seconds on each side or until the points touching the pan were brown.  I mixed some garlic in some butter (I hadn't used garlic in the recipe) and drizzled it on them.  They were delicious and looked great!

Absolutely delicious- far better than the store bought ones. I do a fair amount of baking, but have never attempted naan before, but it's safe to say this recipe is now a keeper- it was so easy and turned out so well. I chose to omit the garlic, although I may try this in future. I was also a bit leery of cooking it on our gas grill, but it came out perfectly. Highly recommend this recipe!

While this recipe doesn't come out like the naan at any Indian restaurant I've ever been to, it's a decent flatbread.  The recipe as shown makes a LOT of loaves.

Wow, amazing! Tasted like store bought if not better! The only change I made to the recipe was added 1/2 tsp baking soda & 1 tsp garlic powder to the dry ingredients. After I rolled out my naan breads I waited for them to rise for a second time, but they didn't! ( so i was a little skeptical if they would turn out at this point ) I fried them anyway in a pan with the lid on and they bubbled and rose beautifully! Yields about 7-8 Naan breads, we had tons left over for dinner the next night!

This was really good. I ended up getting 21 pieces of bread out of it about 4" in diameter each. I decided to leave out the optional garlic so I could make more things out of the flat bread. I didn't have a grill available so I made them on the stove on a non stick pan sprayed with olive oil. I heated the burner to 4 to cook the bread and it worked great for nice browning. It did take twice as long on both rises than suggested, though, but my home was also a little cool. I found that unlike tortillas that need to be stretched very thin these are the opposite. They puff up a little more when a tad thick in spots. I plan to use these for open faced sandwiches as they are too small to really fold or flat bread pizzas. Thank you!

Loved it!  Made the dough in my bread machine, using 4 cups bread flour.  We all thought the bread was very good;  good texture and good flavor.  My 2 yr old loved to help roll it out, which is good because I'm always looking to involve him in my cooking.  I mixed garlic powder in the melted butter that I brushed on during grilling.

Great. Great. Great. I substituted fresh garlic with powdered, since I was out. Worked great! I may try to freeze them and see if they handle being reheated.

these are delicious. I use honey instead of sugar, which I think makes a big difference in taste and the dough texture. Also, I cook mine on my really large electric griddle, turned all the way up and left to get hot for a while before use. The secret to getting the bubbles seems to be having a cooking surface that is extremely hot and brushing it with butter right away. These cook extremely fast and my family looooves them!

Absolutely fantastic.  The key to that wonderful bubbly Naan is to roll the dough super thin!  I didn't mess around with some of the tricks from other reviewers, just made sure my dough was super thin and they puffed up all over!  I prepared them on an indoor grilling pan and kept them warm in the oven (still tasted good but straight from the grill pan was the best).  Froze half the dough, thawed overnight, and prepared today.  This batch wasn't great, but still quite good. Perhaps something is lost by freezing.  Can't thank you enough for the recipe. Definitely a keeper!!!

The most delicious naan bread ever!  I added 1/4 tsp of baking soda to the dough, which made it bubble really nice. I cooked it on an open George Foreman grill and it turned out perfect!

First time I ever saw this type bread was yesterday at the store.  I was looking for a good flat bread for chicken sammies but I was not into paying $2.50 for 1 piece of bread.  So off to my trusty Allrecipes and I found this recipe.  This bread was so simple and easy to make.    I made sure to proof my yeast (mixing yeast with 1t. sugar and adding the water) allowing it to sit for 10 minutes.  3.5 cups of flour was perfect.  I also used my Foreman grill (set to 425 degrees) as it is winter here and I did not feel like freezing outside.  Divided dough into 6 balls, after second rise I  rolled them out into rectangles and grilled for about 4-5 min per side with the Foreman top open.    Just to try them we brushed with a little butter and garlic and they just melted in your mouth!  So after our tasting I need to make another batch to have enough for dinner. This is a keeper of a recipe!  Thanks for sharing it!

Excellent flavor, but mine came out a bit chewy.  This is the first time i've tried to make this sort of bread, so it was probably more a flaw in my technique than the recipe itself.  I was also hoping for more air bubbles, so i'll be using the advice of other reviewers and add in some baking soda next time.  I'll definitely try this again though -- the flavor is spot on, I just need to work on the texture.  Thanks so much for sharing Mic :)

Made this last night.  It was FANTASTIC!!  Between 3 people, we ate so many pieces with homemade Chicken Tikka Masala.  The recipe makes about 2 dozen and we only have 2 left.  The only thing I was concerned about was the yeast didn't look frothy enough.  Only had a couple bubbles after 15 min.  But it worked anyway, so I will make this again tomorrow for a party.

Fantastic recipe! I was able to simply follow along, and produce delicious bread.  I have passed along this recipe to others who enjoy naan, just like I do.   Thank you!

07.03.2011 Second time making Naan w/recipe. I tried it this time on a grill (vs. skillet), and I must add that once you start grilling it, you need to keep your eyes on them or they will char a bit. I managed to scorch 2, but they were still delicious. On average, my batches have produced 20-24 pieces of bread. It doesn't last long in my house.

Overall it tasted good, but was not the texture of traditional naan.  Mine turned out more like pita bread than naan.

This is the best naan I've eaten. We recently made it for a family get together, and everyone loved it. The minced garlic adds just the right  flavor; I highly recommend including it.

This recipe was absolutely amazing. I deviated from the recipe and mistakenly added the butter into the dough mix, but it turned out well. I also used the dough to make stuffed naan. I washed and boiled a couple potatoes and mashed them up, then added some garlic, pepper, diced green onion, garam masala, and shredded cheddar cheese. I highly HIGHLY recommend trying this. It was definitely better than the naan I had last week at a local Indian place.

I double this recipe and freeze the finished bread every month since I started making this myself. We love to use the bread to make homemade pizzas with. It's perfect for the pizza crust and each child in my house has alot of fun making their own pizza.

Great recipe. Family loved it.  Modified by using egg-replacer (Ener-G) instead of egg and it worked great.  Would be a 5 star if it was lighter and flakier like it is in the restaurants. Will make again.

Very good naan!!!   The only change I made to the recipe was using 1/2 whole wheat flour--mainly because I didn't have enough regular flour.   I'll definitely be making this again.  Thanks for sharing, Mic

Be  patient and follow the directions, really give the dough time to rise, I doubled the rising time, it worked perfectly without baking soda added. It tasted just like Naan I have eaten in restaurants. Even my picky eater loved them.

Delicious!!! But if you don't feel like grilling your naan, you can kick your oven up a high as it will go, slap your thin naan dough onto a cookie sheet and cook for one min or so on each side until brown bubbles arise on your mostly white naan. Make sure this is done on the bottom rack. Take out and brush a little butter on. Enjoy!

These are better than what you get out to eat! They are so easy to make. The only thing I did different was use olive oil instead of butter and I used a large frying pan instead of grilling. They came out bubbly and good!!! Thanks for the recipe, it's a keeper!

My family stood at the stove and ate these as they came off the griddle! They now want to know when I plan to make more... I can't blame them - these taste SO GOOD!   I pretty much followed the recipe as written with only the following slight modifications:  I don't have a grill so cooked them in a very lightly-oiled frying pan.   When shaping the balls into circles, I used a rolling pin and rolled the dough very thin.   Instead of kneading fresh garlic into the dough I sprinkled some garlic powder into the melted butter.  This recipe is definitely a "keeper." Thanks, Mic, for submitting it! My family thanks you!

I made this because it got so many good ratings. It was great! I made the dough in the bread machine, then rolled them out in balls and continued with the instructions. After I flattened the balls, I fried them in butter and they were great; no left overs!

Make it, you'll love it! Who knew it could be so easy? It must be the butter and the grill that gives Naan that distinctive flavor. I does not need a lot of butter, just a few dabs. I had leftover dough so the next day I used it to make grilled pizza.

Amazing! This is going to become a staple in my household. The only thing to remember is to put some sugar (I used 1 tsp.) in with the dissolved yeast. Otherwise it doesn't activate as well.

When i used this recipe with my masala, my husband looked up with HUGE eyes and said, "Babe. This is EXACTLY like what i eat in Afghanistan!" We've tried multiple recipes to duplicate the Naan the villagers would make the soldiers. He said this by FAR was something he'd consider exactly the same. Thank for a great dinner additive. I've used this recipe SO many times!!!

Sorry, I didn't much care for this recipe...and I love Naan bread.  I've made Naan bread before and this is the first time I used an egg to make the dough. While the bread ddn't turn out bad, I think the addition of the egg gave the bread more of a cake-like consistency.  I will try without the egg next time.

These were SO good! Hubby absolutely loved them, and they were excellent on their own and with Tikka Masala. I didn't have a grill, so I sort of fried them in a ridged frying pan over medium low heat. Doing it this way was a little time consuming as I could only cook one at a time. I followed suggestions of others and brushed on the melted butter with garlic mixed in instead of kneading the garlic into the dough, but other than that followed the recipe. I had never made Naan before, and this did not disappoint!

Absolutely delicious naan! However, the garlic didn't seem the 'suit' it. I love garlic naan, but the flavour of the dough really didn't work with garlic. I would suggest not putting garlic on this particular naan recipe.

Not overly difficult to make, and tasted AWESOME! Almost like a garlic-y homemade pretzel. Had it with curry and loved it. My husband said it tasted like an Indian version of "the best garlic bread ever."

Absolutely delicious.  Garlic was in no way overpowering; it really added a nice touch.  Cooked it on my outside gas grill.  Cooks so fast that you really can't walk away.  Fabulous.

Great tasting Naan! Good recipe!  I needed to let the dough rest longer, they were a bit chewy.  We still ate and enjoyed them.  I will definitely be trying this one again!

Guess what my dinner guest said? That this naan was better than the Indian restaurant naan we had a week ago.     I made a slight change. I made pesto naan instead. I melted butter and stirred in pesto. There was more pesto than butter. As the bread finished cooking, I spooned the pesto mixture all over the bread. It was awesome with chicken coconut curry over rice with steamed broccoli, carrots, and cabbage.

Pretty good, just make sure you have the time to make it. If not on the grill, you can cook in a frying pan for a few minutes on each side.

Great recipe! I omitted the garlic due to kids’ taste preferences, and these were a hit!! I froze half of them and am hoping they will taste as delicious upon reheating!

I was so happy to find this recipe.  It really is just like the Naan you'll find in an Indian restaurant.  I read a lot of the reviews and I'll agree the recipe is a little off, because you do need to proof your yeast by adding sugar before you continue with the other steps.  I used the flat pancake griddle on my gas stove rather than a grill, and achieved a very similar result.  I would suspect that if you didn't have a grill, a skillet would work just fine.  Keep the heat down to a medium high heat (not too hot).  The bread bubbled just fine with the recipe as is, just make sure you roll out your Naan as thin as possible.  Next time, I might add a little baking soda just to see if it adds more bubbles, but honestly, I don't think it's necessary.    GREAT Recipe Find.  Have fun with this one, it will become a staple for you.

YUMM.  Great homemade taste, near to authentic! Use a preheated baking stone (heated it in a 475 degree oven for 20 minutes, with a little oil spread on.)  As soon as each piece bubbled up and was lightly browned I removed it, put it in a kitchen towel then put it in a covered pyrex bowl to maintain softness until we were ready to eat.  Don't over cook, it will toughen up the bread.

So easy and delicious.  I saved the garlic until after cooking then made up garlic butter.  It made heaps, so I froze the left overs and just reheated later.  Still tasted delicious.  Have recommended to many others.

Great naan. Better than I've had in some restaurants, and not very difficult (other than the time spent waiting for rises). It's fairly straightforward and can be cooked in a heavy skillet with just a hint of oil. Please note that the naan it makes are pretty small (but oh so good) and you can flatten the dough balls by hand, saving time over rolling them out.

Very tasty and surprisingly easy!  I'll definitely stick with the optional garlic as the flavor was quite nice.  I used my George Foreman grill, experimenting with it open and closed.  To me, there wasn't a noticeable difference in taste either way, but closed is, of course, slightly faster.

I made this tonight and it was so awesome!  I was discouraged because I only had RapidRise yeast, but I just followed the instructions on the jar for how to use it in a traditional recipe and it turned out great.  They took less flour, and I actually halved the recipe.  I cooked mine in a cast iron skillet and they were so authentic tasting.  We ate way too many!  Thanks for posting!

This is a good basic recipe.  My only suggestion would be to add a bit more garlic but I'm a garlic lover!  Next time I'll experiment with more flavors.

This is the best naan I've ever had.  Start about two hours before you're serving dinner so that it can rise sufficiently or it won't be ready.  Also, my kids and I had fun flattening it with our hands just prior to tossing on the grill- we didn't bother rolling it out.  I think my entire family would be perfectly happy if I served this and nothing more for dinner.  It really is that good.

This recipe was a dream- the hardest part was waiting for the dough to rise! I found that I personally preferred rolling the dough thin before dropping it in the pan- but any way you do it, this one's a keeper!

Fantastic homemade mini-naans!  I made these on my George Foreman indoor grill for just a few minutes.  Since the original recipe makes so many, I froze many of them.  I lightly browned over half of the mini-naans, cooled, individually wrapped in plastic wrap, then placed in a large freezer bag.  When you're ready to enjoy again, just toss on the grill for a few minutes until hot.  Taste nearly as good as fresh, and can be a great addition to a weeknight curry. Thank you for this recipe!

best naan ever... I make it just as the recipe states except it only ever take 3.5 cups of bread flour to get my dough soft.  sometimes I sub 1 cup whole wheat flour to healthify it.  I have never managed to mess it up and everyone loves it.. it even rates better than restaurant naan with my friends!

It tastes ok but the texture of mine was terrible.  Really hard.  The writer must live in a much different climate than I live in.  The dough was much much too dry I had to add almost half a cup of water ti get the dough into a kneadable ball.  I will keep looking for a naan recipe, this was not it for my dry geographical area.

I have never made naan before, but served an Indian dinner last week for a few friends and was looking for naan. I found this recipe on allrecipes.com, and thought it was a winner.  It was fast, easy and absolutely perfect. I will make it again and again -- and it's not just for Indian food anymore! I'm serving it with steak tomorrow night. Great recipe and I have printed it and shared it with many others!  Thanks!

We loved this recipe, though the first rising took an extra hour.  We grilled them.  It was definitely worth the effort!

I cooked it in a frying pan, about a minute on each side until partially browned.  It was the perfect texture and went great with a curry I made.  I also added some cracked pepper to the mixture at the very beginning.  Easy, tasty recipe.  I will make it again.

This recipe produced some really good naan.  I didn't have a grill available, so I made 8 pieces (instead of 14) and baked them in an oven at 425F for 13 minutes.  They came out great!

One of my new favorites! Used garlic salt instead of salt and cooked them on the stovetop griddle I use for pancakes perfect, turn oven on to 200 and then turned it off kept them warm till we were ready to eat. Made with Chicken Tikka Masala and yellow saffron rice, perfect combination! Thanks Mic

awesome.  my husband wanted naan and i was doubtful i could find a good and easy recipe...yet, here it is!  i have made this twice, and both times, it turned out great.  instead of cooking on the grill, i just fry it on the stove.  i also love these with cinnamon and sugar, and some cream cheese for dip :)

I was skeptical about this recipe, because it just didn't sound right. The naan were good, but my husband and I both decided it tasted and had the consistency of pizza bread rather than any authentic naan we have had. Great taste, easy to make, but not what I would call authentic. I'll be trying another recipe which includes ghee and yogurt next time.

Never would've thought I could make naan at home.  This recipe was great, although a little hard to make the first time around.  The dough was very sticky and hard to manage, but it was easier as I tried more times and the taste is right on!  I haven't been able to make it look pretty yet- it kind of looks like grilled chicken.  I guess I need more practice!  It goes great w/ the Chicken Tikka Masala from this site (omitting the salt.)  Yum!

Great recipe.  To get the real naan bread taste, you need to add about 1/4 tsp of crushed kalonji.  With that addition, this is perfect.

This turned out great on the Baking plate of my GF G5 grill!! It made five nice pieces. The flavor was pretty bland but hey, it's a blank slate for whatever I feel like adding...coriander, fresh rings of onion, cumin, tandoori paste, garam masala...whatever. Great recipe, THANKS!!

Family loved this!!!  Oddly enough, the yeast never bloomed,  I think I was basically making glue patties and throwing them on the grill... Yet they turned out!  I'll keep trying this recipe, It totally makes the Indian experience.

I moved to a place that is 150 miles to the closest Indian restaurant and thus I had to learn how to make some of my favorite dishes myself.  This naan is time consuming but worth it.  Take another reviewers advice about how to proof the yeast.  Also, I use my stand mixer to knead the dough and it turns out great every time.  Finally, I add a bunch more garlic than it calls for.

This is a great flat bread recipe that reminds me of the naan from an Afghan resturant in Fremont. I found, as other reviewers mentioned, that 3 1/2 cups of flour is enough. I threw everything into the bread machine, except butter, and set it on dough cycle instead of making it by hand. To cook, I used my non-stick wok and just dry-cooked the flatened dough over medium heat. Thanks for this delicious naan!

WOW!!!!  I followed the amounts in the recipe, but used my bread maker for the dough-- I had to add some extra water, but I believe it is because we live in the desert and there is NO moisture in the air.  I grilled, brushed with butter-- AMAZING.  Great chewy texture, wonderfully tasty.  I am so impressed.

Mine didn't come out like they do in resturants, but they were good enough to remake. I made more than we could eat for our Indian dinner so I froze the rest and later in the week I made little pizzas out of them with left over pasta sause and my husband loved them both ways.

I followed the recipe but used only 4 cups of flour. Didn't want to fire up the grill(11pm) nor use a skillet, so I turned my gas stove burner on low and cooked it over the open fire,turning 1/4 turns until brown on one side then cooked the other side. Had it with Indian Curry...Excellent!

Fun to make.   The Naan surprisingly didn't take too long to rise.   We had the day to cook, and is perfect for a rainy day.   We cooked the Naan on the stove.   It worked out perfectly!  Yum!

I used 2 cups white flour and 2 cups wheat, added 1 tsp baking soda (for puffiness), and 1 tsp extra sugar to help the yeast proof.  Also, I used warm (115 F) milk, water, and eggs at room temp to help activate the yeast.  The recipe was very bland and did not puff well at all.  Next time I will add more yeast and more garlic and allow the naan to rise before cooking.  I found them to be better after I had frozen and them rewarmed it in a 400 degree oven for 1 minute.

This was pretty awesome as is. We cooked it several ways, on the foreman on medium with lid open and closed(didn't work well), on the foreman lid open/closed on high, all the pieces came out chewy and tough. Our favorite method was in a skillet with a light bit of ghee (just is clarified butter that you can make or buy for authentic flavor) over medium high heat. We discovered that we enjoyed the naan in a pan. It came out softer and more brown with the traditional flavor. Dash with salt and you're good to go! Very wonderful.

I have made this recipe several times.  It is easy and delicious.  I do not cook it on a grill, I make it in my broiler.  The most important part I have found is that you really have to stand there and watch the dough.  I set a timer for two minutes and depending on the heat coming out of the oven even that is too long sometimes.  As I said, all in all it's easy, you just realy have to watch the dough.

This recipe is great. I used my electric skillet and it worked really well. It was a bit of work to get it rolled thin enough but well worth it. I added 1 tsp of baking soda & doubled the size of the dough balls. I roasted a whole bulb of garlic and added that to the dough instead of raw garlic. I also pressed some golden raisins and finely chopped walnuts into a few pieces and that was very good too. I will make this recipe again and again.

I've been making a buttered chicken w/ rice lately, and needed some bread to go w/ it. This recipe was AMAZING. I cut the flour down to 4 cups, and it was perfect. My parents came over (and they'd never had indian before) and LOVED it!!! Thanks!

Delicious naan recipe.  I proofed the yeast before adding the other ingredients.  I also added crushed garlic to the butter before grilling the naan.  As other reviewers suggested, next time I'll add some baking soda to the dough to give the naan the bubbles I'm used to.

Excellent! Roll out thin - the thinner the better. I used half the amount of sugar as suggested. Excellent!

This Naan is fantastic!  I used garlic powder instead of the minced garlic and threw everything into the bread machine on the dough cycle.  Tried it this way on the weekend and now I can make Naan during the busy weeknights using this method.  Very, very tasty.  Kids loved it and my husband asks me to make it at least once a week! A keeper!

I decided to make this recipe as I was craving naan bread and didn't fancy phoning my local to deliver me just one naan bread!

I found the naan far too salty and heavy and it tasted more like pitta bread than naan. 

Not the best naan ever as the review says but I suppose it was passable. I think naan bread may just be something best left to the experts at my local Indian restaurant!

This bread is great, I make it all the time for my husband and myself and we never get fed up.  I add a little baking soda to create bubbles and instead of milk I use greek yogurt.  Delicious!

A few tips: Leave the garlic out. It makes no sense. Use a pizza stone in a 425 oven, turning once for browning on both sides, and drizzle the butter on after the bread is finished.

Also, if you have a tortilla press, use it! Save yourself the trouble of rolling the dough. 

This bread isn't exactly authentic.  As my husband's Indian co-worker says, if it has any flavor, you're not doing it right!  This is very good bread, though.  I've made it several times using both my pizza stone and my Foreman grill.  Use a stone if you have one.  You get a better texture this way.  This recipe has become  my go-to for naan, even though it's not remotely what I expected the first time I  made it.

I made these for dinner tonight and we loved them.  I made them a little smaller, got 23, and only 2 were left at the end of dinner.  I will definitely make these again.

This is a fabulous recipe.  I would give it 10 stars if I could.  I did, however, make a couple of changes.  I used 1 tablespoon of honey to proof the yeast, 1 teaspoon of baking soda and substituted 1 cup of flour for whole wheat flour.  I also used regular unbleached flour instead of bread flour.  Using an electric skillet it still turned out great.  Many thanks to mic and family!

This recipe for Naan bread works beautifully in a commercial kitchen setting. I am the pastry chef for a catering company and we now routinely use this recipe when a menu calls for flatbread.

I add 2 tablespoons minced garlic and the melted butter to the dough mix and then just before browning I butter the dough on both sides. Use this as a tortilla with chicken taco meat and it is awesome. The Family loves it and the Missionaries request it.

Very good - I cooked on my GF Grill with lid DOWN.  Worked great!  I will make again, but when Grumpy isn't home - to go with whatever other Indian food I may want to try!

Although I have never eaten naan in my life I really appreciated what came out of my grill. They tasted just like pita bread. I served them with souvlaki and tzatziki, quite a typical Greek dish, and were better and less greasy than the ones sold around my country. I kept some in a plastic bag and even the next day after micro waving them for a few seconds, they were soft and tender.

This review will be really biased because I live in a city where in a matter of minutes I can visit "Little India" and have authentic Indian/Pakistani food.  This food isn't americanized "curry" or butter chicken either.  The naan they serve in these restaurants is out of this world: piping fresh from a stone oven, thin with giant crater bubbles, and slathered in ghee (clarified butter).  I saw this recipe a while back and wanted to try it when I have some time, as I haven't made bread since I was at least 15.  This naan was alright.  I tried the grill first (I have a non-george one), and it didn't work properly.  I switched to the cast iron pan and that worked better.  The dough bubbled slightly because I followed the advice of another reviewer and added baking soda.  I found this to be too dense and was somewhat like pita bread, not like the naan in my favourite authentic restaurants. My inexperience in bread-making could have accounted for this though.   That said, it was a decent bread as a meal accompaniment.  For the people who aren't that experienced with naan, they'll most likely enjoy this recipe.  I may make this one again when I have some time.

A lot of work but well worth it. I used a nonstick skillet but think I'll try cast iron next time. Easier than standing out in winter weather at the grill. I also tried the baking soda tip but think I'll leave it out next time. The bubble effect was minimal. Still a tasty recipe.

This bread came out fabulous. When I rolled it into the balls I put a teaspoon of garlic in the center so it dispersed when I flattened it out.  I used an stovetop cast iron griddle grill and the bread DID bubble up properly and came out great!

Great naan recipe.  I cooked them on my baking stone, which kept them from getting too crispy, which was what happened when I grilled them.

Really delicious!  The consistency was perfect, light and fluffy and bubbly.  It did take a little longer than stated to rise, about 1.5 hours.  I also added the garlic powder as recommended from other reviews.  I don't have a grill so I cooked it in a pan greased very sparingly.  It came out perfectly.  Thanks for the recipe.

This was so simple to do! Thanks so much!  I also added a 1/2 tsp of baking soda to make certain I got the bubbles, that worked out perfectly. Also I wish I would have added more garlic, might have to add some garlic powder as another reviewer suggested. Lastly, I only used half of the recipe and got 12 medium sized pieces that would be plenty for my husband and me. I froze the rest for next time I make Indian. Thanks again!

ALMOST as good as the naan at my favorite Indian restaurant. I don't have much experience working with yeast and kneading and such so it was an adventure. I let the dough rise for an hour and a half the first time, and about 45 minutes the second time. I don't have a grill so I used a skillet.The first one I made wasn't rolled thin enough and wasn't bubbly. The rest I rolled as thin as I could and they were perfect. I taste tested the first ten and wasn't hungry for the curry I made! This recipe makes LOTS of dough so I only used about a 1/3 of it and froze the rest. I am going to use it as pizza dough as the others have suggested.

My parents and I sometimes eat out for Indian food like Naan but this recipe came out so good, I make it instead. We all LOVE it. The yeast was a little tricky but once you figure it out...it is SO sweet.

I used whole wheat flour and did not brush with butter to make it a little healthier. I loved it and so did my husband. I try making it a little thinner than your initial urge to place it on the flat grill. I think it turn out less gooey and a little more crunchy. I also spayed it with PAM spray to substitute the butter. Great recipe to use with other Indian dishes.

Warning: too much yeast can result in air pockets, and some not so fluffy naan bread. I have had naan before in Indian restaurants, and tried to recreate it from this recipe at home. Very delicious bread, sure, but mine ended up being flat and slightly gooey. Shall give this another attempt, though.

I love naan! This recipe is great but time consuming. I substituted 4 cups of all-purpose flour for the bread flour since that's all I had in the house. The naan came out thicker than the ones I get at the Indian restaurant but it was still very good. You just have to roll the dough out in a thinner circle if you like it crispier but if you like it chewy then roll it out regularly. Definitely try this recipe!

I made this exactly as stated except didn't brush the finished product with butter.  It was raining outside today so I cooked them on the flat panels of my waffle maker.  They were yummy.

Fantastic! I was worried since I hadn't ever made a yeast bread before, but this turned out lovely. I served it with a lamb Chalau recipe also from this site. I did not use butter, but instead used non-stick spray and a George Foreman grill. During the last kneading, I added a few sprigs of Italian Parsley to each doughball. Baked in, that added flavor, color, and garnish in one step! This is a great recipe to build on and create: peshwari naan, Kashmiri naan,  qeema naan, and/or aloo naan. Thank you for this great recipe! I froze the extra dough for a week, added some rosemary and baked in a small loaf for dipping in olive oil. Excellent!

I do not have a grill so I used my frying pan. I have to say that they didn't turn out like the "typical" naan but they were still so delicious that my husband and I ate almost the entire recipe in 1 day. Perhaps I'll get a grill and make them like they were suppossed to be made.

Just like the restaurants! Very good. I reccomend making them if your going to make an Indian dish. It just makes everything right. I have kind of a funny story that goes along with this. When I was making this, I asked my boyfriend to help, because I was making the Indian Chicken curry on this website, and I thought I could trust him to atleast roll out the dough. Well, I told him to flour the counter first before he rolled them out, so he did so. And he made a couple and we were trying them, and they tasted really sweet. I was like hmm this is really unusual, but really good. Turns out he floured the counter with powdered sugar! I was dying laughing! I guess it was my fault for even letting him help. haha. So anyways, we made half the batch with powdered sugar and half the bath with flour, but they still turned out great. Very good recipe!

This recipe was really great. I fried the bread in a skillet because I didn't have a grill or Forman grill and most of them still puffed up great. The taste was awesome. I also put the garlic into the melted butter that I brushed onto the naan while cooking instead of in the dough. Thanks!

have made this recipe twice and haven't been able to use 4.5 cups flour--more like slightly less than 4.  1st time was with tikka masala and 2nd with gyros.  2nd time around was much better--fluffier and softer (i think that the yeast was fresher and more time was allowed for the rise--even forgot the milk 2nd time).  no leftovers.  used the grill and had excellent results.  we like ours about pita thickness.  found that dividing into 8/9 produced better results than 12.  definately a regular part of the menu. will use more garlic next time and try doing the 1st rise in the breadmaker.

This naan was soooo good! I thought it tasted alot better than what you get in a restaurant. It was soo soft and chewy, not crunchy and hard like some restaurants.
I used all purpose flour instead of bread flour, and it tasted excellent. I will keep making this!!

Not exactly like the bread in an Indian restaurant but I don't have a tandoori oven either!  Very good for homemade and very tasty.  I used all-purpose flour instead of bread flour and cream instead of milk.  Yummy!

I'm giving stars based on how much I liked it rather than how close it was to restaurant taste since this is the first time I've ever had naan, and I have nothing to compare it to.  The only variation I did was to omit the chopped garlic and instead put a sprinkle of garlic powder in the butter to baste the bread with.  We served it with Chicken Jalfrezi from this site.  My husband thought it was too dry on its own, but enjoyed it as a sauce-soaker-upper.  I pulled mine apart (think pita) and put the meat and sauce inside...very enjoyable, and my son had a blast helping me make it.

Very good. I didn't know if I should grill this on my gas BBQ grill or in an iron skillet on the stovetop. So I did the iron skillet and it turned out great... on med heat. The one thing that was a little much was the garlic. I think next time I'll use about half as much and maybe saute it in oil before mixing with the dough.

I've made this recipe twice; once in an oven, once on the grill and it was fantastic both ways.  My friends loved it and after giving a small piece to my dog, he wouldn't stop begging for more (he's very picky about bread, too).  I found it was really good when dipped in melted butter.

I've done this both on my stove-top cast iron griddle, and on the grill - different textures from the 2, but both are extremely good.

I have never tried a recipe remotely like this.  I used about 1/2 AP flour and 1/2 whole wheat flour, as that is all that I had on hand.  It still turned out great.  I grilled it outside on a gas grill.  I got great grill marks and it was the next best thing to having a tandoor.  Thanks for the recipe.

This tasted nothing like naan.  It didn't matter how thin they got, it wasn't naan; it tasted more like a sweet dinner roll.  It was good, and it all got eaten, but since it isn't actually naan, I won't be making it again.  Thanks anyway.

Yep, gotta agree it's a great recipe.... oh, but isn't making bread by hand hard work these days!  So I tossed it all in the bread maker and picked up the recipe at the 2nd rise.  Highly recommended, and can easily be started while still at work!

Awesome naan. I cook it on our foreman grill (didn't have anything else for a time). For those of us using bottled yeast 1 package equals 2 1/4 teaspoons. The garlic is a great addition and doesn't overpower the naan.

Delicious!  I only used 3.5 C. of flour and it came out wonderful.  I lightly greased a skillet with olive oil to cook mine, over med-high heat, about a min. each side.  I believe the trick to it not coming out like pita, (as someone mentioned) is to roll it out paper thin before cooking.  I will definitely make this again!

This was great! My boyfriend and I loved it...and we are BIG naan fans!!

I live in Japan, so I don't have access to a grill (other than my BBQ and it was too cold to light that up!) so I cooked them in a frypan with some spray oil. It worked just fine and only took about a minute each side. 

We had too much dough for the two of us to eat in one sitting so I split it in two, mixed in some black olives, cheese and parmesan then baked a nice loaf of bread while the curry was cooking!

Bubbled up without any problem and were quite tasty, but it was impossible for me to roll the dough thin enough.  Instead of looking like restaurant naan, they looked like thick pancakes.  My guests and I came to the conclusion that it's impossible for the home cook to duplicate restaurant naan since the western kitchen isn't equipped with a tandoor.  Oh well, at least this naan has good flavor.

I made this twice just to make sure i didn't mess up and make something good by mistake.  First time with Garlic, second time without. Couldn't tell the difference.  It just sounded so wrong to BBQ it, but it was realy very easy. Only burnt a couple pieces.  Cooks much faster than I expected, but that could have been my fault.  It tasted great.

Delicious!!! This was just like the naan at an indian restaurant. We made it on the grill along with some tandoori chicken, and served it with raita on the side. We all loved it -- will definitely make it again!

We grilled this on an oventop griddle (the side with ridges) and it turned out beautifully!  It's especially good with the chicken tiki masala.

GREAT! I made it in a stainless skillet over gas heat (careful - it burns quick!) and once I got the hang of it the bread was delicious! Just for fun, I tried a few pieces on the Foreman, but it didn't taste right.

These were pretty good.  I will make again with half the sugar and then brush with garlic butter.

This recipe turned out great in the end, but it took me a while to figure out that laying the dough on the lower grill -- the hotter one -- made the dough puff up and create the air bubbles that makes naan so good. I love that this recipe works on the BBQ. I served it with kebabs and my guests loved it too!

OUTSTANDING!!!  I love Indian food, and eat it quite often, and this is truly a great recipe.

I made this last night and added twice the garlic, and he won't quit eating it!!  Looks like this is now a weekly staple to be made in the house (along with the various types of beans I make).  Next week, I'm going to add fresh spinach to this when it is cooking for a spinach naan sandwich!!

Thanks for sharing this yummy recipe.

I tried out making naans with my eleven year old today. Overall the naans turned out fine but what I am used to. True naans have nice layers. However, we tried out variations by adding chopped garlic and onions to it. The naans turned fairly well from taste point of view.

Best naan ever! I didn’t have bread flour so I used white flour and I have no regrets! So if you don’t have bread flour, trust me it will still turn out. Made it on a grill pan. Cook over medium-high heat and you’ll have no problem getting the bubbles to form. I should also  say I made the dough pretty thin before cooking (just used my hands to pat down the dough until it was translucent), which helps creates the bubbles that everyone craves.

Maybe over the summer I’ll try making it on the grill, but for now I’m in love!

I love this recipe!  I usually make it when I'm having a grilling dinner party.  Then I freeze the little balls of dough and take them out a few of a time, microvwave defrost and make them when I grill for 1 or 2.

This recipe is awesome! I've made this for a couple people now, and they've all asked me for the recipe. These freeze very well too! I usually make a batch and freeze some. You just have to pull a couple out and throw them in the oven for a few minutes to warm. Yum!

Delicious!  I have never had Naan before, and made this for a themed get together.  It was definitely a hit.  I used pastry flour and needed the full 4 1/2 cups.  I cooked them in a frying pan on the stove and they cooked nicely.  Simply to make, and my kids asked that I make them again - to eat with jam :)

Loved this recipe! It doesn't quite taste like the naan I have in Indian restaurants, but it's delicious!! I didn't allow enough time for the dough to rise at all, (maybe 10 minutes) and they still turned out delicious! Husband said I needed to keep this recipe and make them every night!

Great naan recipe. It was a lot of work, but that was expected. This was my first time making Naan and it turned out perfect! I did not have any problem with the dough rising, like some reviewers, but I did put it on top of my refrigerator to rise. It's winter so my heater was on in the house and it was definitely warm up there. I used my grill pan on the stove and it worked great. I did need to use about a full stick of butter, though, to get through all of the naan.

While my husband missed the oven baked-ness of the bread and gave it a three star I absolutely loved it. I don't know how I've gone so long without it :) And two out of three of the pickiest kids ever ate it! That right there makes it a keeper in my book. I used instant yeast so I didn't have to proof and I didn't have a problem with it rising. I used garlic powder rather than minced simply because I didn't have any minced on hand but it was still fabulous. Great job! And Thanks!

Incredibly good!  I've made this recipe a few times and have gotten better results using 3 TBS plain yogurt instead of milk.  It makes excellent naan either way.  My 9 yr old son asked me to just make naan for dinner (nothing else).  The recipe as is makes a lot.  Any leftovers freeze well.

I have been sitting on this recipe forever because I was intimidated by the thought of grilling bread dough. Finally today I tried it on the stovetop, and boy is it ever delicious. I only had 2 cups of bread flour so the rest was all purpose, and I don't think I used the full amount called for. I heated up my cast iron 'pancake pan' really hot and then turned it down to medium low to 'grill' all the naan. For the garlic, instead of kneading it into the dough I melted the butter in a pan and heated up the garlic in it for a bit and it turned out well; subtle garlic flavor with no chunks. I made a huge pile of naan and DBF ate about half, this recipe was a hit!

This recipe is so easy and so delicious. Whenever I make it for guests they seem quite impressed to have fresh bread with dinner. (I don't tell them how easy it is.) I mix all the dry ingredients first, including the yeast. And then I add the egg, garlic, and the warmed milk and water. Turns out great!!

I have made  this recipe many times. I don't need quite as much flour as the recipe calls for and I add 1 1/2 tsps of garlic powder with the flour instead of minced garlic. The naan freezes beautifully. I put cooled naan in ziploc bags and only take out what I need. It thaws nicely in their toaster oven or microwave or on the counter. Great to have with a bowl of soup. Delicious.

First naan recipe that tastes like it came from a restaurant. I was lazy and put the ingredients in the bread machine. Still came out great. I would recommend making the dough very thin and brushing it with ghee (clarified butter) to make it taste even more authentic.

I don't think I'd ever eaten naan before making it for a themed dinner party.  Guests that had eaten naan before said it was VERY good.  I liked it but I wouldn't say that I am qualified to say whether it was REALLY good or not.

I've made this recipe several times, and the only problem I have is that I can hardly keep from eating the whole batch at once! I make these on my grill pan on the stove, and find the trick is to roll/stretch the dough out as thin as possible to get lots of soft yummy bubbles. This bread is excellent with a good hummus or tzaziki dip.

This was my first time making naan.  I used my bread machine using 3 1/2 cups flour and I did not proof the yeast.  Dough turned out perfect.  I fired up the outside grill and grilled the first naan but with the hot Texas temperature in August I just couldn't fathom grilling a dozen of these so I shut it down and grilled them inside on a Lodge cast iron grill skillet.  They turned out great with lovely grill marks.  Couldn't tell the difference from the one grilled outside and the ones grilled inside.

This was my first attempt at homemade naan and it received thumbs up all around.  You'll need time for the dough to rise, but otherwise it is a relatively quick and easy bread - and yummy!  I cooked it on my stovetop grill skillet.

I would give this recipe 100 stars if I could. Best bread that has ever graced my lips (I'm a carb lover, so trust me, I have had a lot of bread! LOL)  Didn't change a thing except I used garlic powder instead of fresh garlic. My family made comments for days afterwards and has requested it many times since.  Delish!

I've made this a few times and changed it up, so I know how I like it now- but it was a great starting point. Decreased sugar to just a teaspoon, use plain yogurt instead of milk, no egg, no butter, less flour (add as you go) and then brush with olive oil and sea salt before grilling. Perfect!

This turned out better than I thought it would. My dough looked like it wasn't going to come together because it was so hard and dry. I had to add some more water to the mixture. Next time I would try not adding as much flour. I also added a half teaspoon of baking powder because I like the bubbles in naan that form when you cook it. I didn't add the garlic to the dough but rather to the melted butter. I also sprinkled it with fresh chopped rosemary. My husband and I loved this. I only made a few for dinner and I have the rest in my freezer for future use. Even though this turned out great, I'm giving this 4 stars because as written, my dough wouldn't have come together.

*Update: just FYI that this dough freezes great! I froze half of the dough in small dough balls and when I was ready to use them I defrosted them on the counter and rolled them out like normal. I also seasoned them any way I wanted and they turn out so good every time!

This was my first attempt at making naan and I'm quite pleased! I followed other reviewers' suggestions and only used about 3 1/2 cups of flour. Made sure to "activate" the yeast by adding 1/2 tsp of sugar to the water and yeast mixture, which worked like a charm (I followed the yeast packet directions and only mixed the yeast with 1/4 cup water to activate, and then added the rest of the required water when mixing all the ingredients together). 

I think the next time I make this, I'll cut down the 1/4 cup sugar to 1 Tbsp - it just seemed far too sweet for naan.

I opted not to knead the garlic into the dough, but rather put it in the butter when I melted it and brushed it on as I cooked the naan. 

I don't have a grill or grill pan, so used my trusty cast iron pan and it did the job! I cooked up half the batch and then had to take a break (WHO CAN NOT GIVE IN TO A BIG PILE OF NAAN STARING AT YOU?), but probably shouldn't have. I think the second half ended up being a bit more tough due to the delay in cooking.

I have made this twice now and I love it. I add garlic powder to the dough in addition to the minced garlic and garlic salt to the butter (I like a lot of garlic). I grill them on a flat cast iron pan & they get all these wonderful bubbles that brown. The house smells amazing & I usually eat two or three while they are cooking (quality assurance!). I cut my dough into 16 servings, as I like my slices to be bigger. Wonderful!

I loved the way the naan turned out! I didn't have any problem with the dough rising. I added a tablespoon of sugar to the yeast/warm water and put the dough in a warm place which probably helped.  My first batch didn't turn out as well as the later ones because I didn't roll the dough thin enough.  Once I adjusted that the later batches turned out great.  You can cook this over the stove as well on medium heat.

So delicious! A little time consuming, but worth it. I suppose I wouldn't mind the time it takes if I didn't have a toddler running around. Cooking it on the grill gives it an incredible flavor!

YUM! These were salty, yummy heaven! A few technical errors (I was making these with two over-eager eight year old kids), but all in all a great recipe. Tips: I added 1/2 a teaspoon of baking soda and tried to coax the kids into rolling them as thinly as possible (They failed to do so half the time.) We cooked them in a typical pan, and every time we cooked one I put a dab of butter and put the rolled dough over it. (The more butter, the saltier and bubblier they'll be!) The first time I set the dough in a bowl and covered it, it didn't rise. My problem: Too cool of an environment and I had forgot to transfer it to a plastic bowl! But after (punching and flipping then) putting the dough in a medium sized plastic bowl and covering, it rose within an hour. Also, the second time they rise, try to cook them ASAP. I left mine for a half hour too long, and they got semi-tough on the top. I assume that's why they didn't thin so nicely.
All in all, great recipe and will be used again in the near future! My fam loves them with hummus!

Perfect, easy naan for a curry dinner.  I followed other advice and covered the pan while each piece cooked.  I used a grill pan and needed more than 30 mins start to finish - - kept them warm in the oven until ready to serve.  Much easier than I expected and the whole family gobbled them up.

Great recipe, although next time i'll add just a bit more sugar.  It took longer to rise, but I didn't prep the yeast with sugar. Will do that the next time. I cooked it on medium in a pan an will do the same the next time. Thank you!

O. M. G. !!  After trying these, I don't think we like regular home-made bread or rolls anymore!  This recipe is the bomb!  I included the optional garlic.  No changes needed at all.  Recipe, including instructions, is very easy to follow.  6/22/15 update: I made the dough in my bread maker this time, and it came out great (husband said the best yet)!  Added the water, milk, and un-beaten egg to the bread maker first, then the flour (used bread flour) and the rest of the ingredients, except for the garlic and butter. I did have to add a couple extra tablespoons of water to soften the dough because the bread maker was working too hard during mixing. I kneaded the garlic in by hand, on a corn-flour dusted breadboard, after the dough cycle was complete, then formed the balls and followed the remaining steps exactly as described in the recipe.  11/7/2018 update: Made a gluten free version by increasing the yeast to 2.5 Tbs, substituting Pamela’s bread mix for the flour and plain yogurt for the milk.  It was a bit stickier than with wheat flour,  and not as elastic, so it actually rolls out more easily and does not tend to shrink back after rolling like “real” naan does. I floured the breadboard generously with the bread mix while rolling to firm up the dough and prevent sticking, and was able to bake on the grill just like the real naan. It didn’t puff up like the real stuff, but it was still some of the tastiest, chewiest gluten free bread I’ve had. Would make great pizza crust

This is the most amazing naan bread I have tried. I do follow the suggestions and add a total of 3 teaspoons of yeast and 1 teaspoon of baking soda. It always comes out light and fluffy. As per other suggestions, start with 3.5 cups of flour....4.5 always comes out tough...

Made so much, and also I need to figure out how to not smoke up the house when I'm making these. I might try them on the electric countertop grill next time.

I just made this recipe and it is excellent. I only used about 4 cups of all purpose flour. Instead of adding the garlic to the dough, I added garlic powder to the melted butter and brushed the bread with the melted garlic butter.  It was perfect!! I will definitely stick with this recipe.

Used ghee instead of regular butter and used a couple of spoonfuls of garlic paste in place of minced garlic. I fried it on the stove and it tasted amazing.

Excellent recipe.  I have not tried this in a grill, but have opted to use the wood fired oven I built after heating it to 900 degrees or so.  They cook pretty quickly at that temp.  I even took a video of cooking two:(http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfszsfQBlDE


  I added some finely minced onion which enhances the sweetness, and on the second try I substituted homemade kefir for the milk and water.  Adding kefir (or you could do some percentage of yogurt) I think gives it a more authentic taste, which is to say, more like I've had in good Indian restaurants.  

Bottom line is, if you don't add some kind of tangy dairy, I think you'll get naan that is very vanilla and just plain sweet tasting.  Of course, without cooking it at the proper temps, you'll have difficulty creating the chewiness and bubbling that people love about authentic naan.

Very, very good recipe.  I had to omit the egg and I used 1 tablespoon melted butter to replace it for the moisture.  I didn't have bread flour so I used all-purpose flour but decreased the amount to 3 1/2 cups.  I also added 1/2 teaspoon baking soda. 

I hand flattened the dough rather than rolling and cooked in a cast-iron skillet over medium heat.  I covered the pan while they cooked for 3 minutes on the first side.  I then brushed with melted butter with a dash of garlic salt added, flipped them over and then continued to cook for an additional 2 minutes.  

They were delicious!

This is a nice treat and other than the time involved is fairly simple.  If I could I would avoid the sugar, ut it is absolutely necessary for the raising of the dough.  I put 2 cups of water in a glass container into the microwave and heat it for 2 minutes. Leave the water in the oven, turn the microwave off and put the bread inside to "proof".  It stays warm just long enough to do the trick

So good! Make sure your grill pan is nice and hot. Also, last time I made this I ran out of steam before the second rising, so, decided to cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until the following night. I lRemoved from fridge, let it rest for 15 minutes, rolled it out, and grilled it up....just as good as grilling same day. Useful for prepping day before.

Wow! This is delicious. I used my bread machine on the dough setting (1.5 hrs) and used 3.5 cups of bread flour. I still proofed the yeast before putting the ingredients in the machine. This made the PERFECT dough. I grilled the flattened dough on a grill pan with olive oil and brushed each side with melted butter mixed w/garlic powder. Make sure to keep an eye on the dough when grilling -- it goes quick! 

Thank you so much for this recipe, it's much better than store bought.

My daughter made this for her co-op history class.  We tried very hard not to eat it all fresh off the griddle!  She opted to leave out the garlic as she wasn't sure about her classmates.  However, as a lover of garlic I think it's inclusion would put it over the top.  We did sprinkle kosher salt on the cooked and buttered side which enhanced it nicely. My son has been begging for more, so we will redo with garlic.  Definite keeper!

WAAAAAY too much flour. I'd recommend reducing the flour by at least a cup, if not more. The dough should be very sticky. I'd also reduce the sugar by a little bit. I wouldn't use this recipe again.

Loved this recipe. Only change I made was in how I cooked it.  I didn't grill it.  Instead I preheated the oven to 500 degrees and warmed up some sheet pans.  Oil the pans and add dough while they're hot, and then bake for 5 minutes or so.  Some ovens may vary.  They were very good.

Very good! I halved this for my family of four.... otherwise we would eat until it's gone. Also, this is very easy, though if you are making these with dinner, be sure that you have a helper or that the rest of the food is in the cooking stage, because making naan does require you to stand at the stove and roll, grill, butter and repeat. So good though!

I'm not going to vouch for how authentic this is, but it sure tastes good. It is a little on the sweet side, and I think next time I make it I'll probably cut the sugar by 2 T or so (especially if you're going to add garlic or something), but this stuff practically didn't make it to the table - we ate it coming off the grill pan. My 1 1/2 year old daughter now knows how to say "Naan."

This was very good and easy, and cooked up great in my cast-iron skillet.

Love it! Used instant dry yeast, and threw all the ingredients into my Kitchenaid bowl to knead for 5 minutes (proofing not necessary). Rather than adding garlic to the dough, I grated 2 cloves of garlic into 1/4 cup melted butter. I rolled out the dough and brushed each side with garlic butter before grilling (roll out, brush a side, grill that side and brush the raw side before flipping). Great flavor, perfect texture, little bubbles in each piece. If you're not getting bubbles, don't work your dough too hard - one good roll out from the center in either direction is enough, and the dough should still retain enough gas to create bubbles.

Incredible recipe!  I made the recipe with fast action yeast instead of active dry, but I used it exactly as described in the recipe.  Also, I cooked it on the back of a black enamel broiler pan under the oven broiler on the highest setting.  It was as good or better than the naan I get at the restaurant.  It even had the desirable small bubbles.

I tried this recipe when I first moved to TZ and didn't have an oven.  I was missing bread.  We then opened a restaurant here geared at expats and this naan was a cornerstone of the menu.  We served it with dips and with soups.  It is delicious and it's very difficult to mess up.  We let it rise for the recommended hour and then roll it into balls and place on a cookie sheet.  We  cover leftovers with plastic and keep in the refrigerator for 2-3 days.  A yummy variation is to add 1 tsp of cumin rather than the garlic.  A fun thing for young kids is to use cookie cutters and make naan bread in the shapes of animals and such!

Great recipe.. the bubbles are created by extreme heat and dough rolled out to about 7cm thick. The grill works best.

So I used all the same ingredients with a bread machine and came out good! After the bread machine dough cycle was done, I separated them into individual balls and left them to rise.  They rose a little bit, but not too much--but still ended up baking and tasting fine.  I made mine on a george foreman grill, worked better than on a pan on the stove.  I made some regular ones, and also cinnamon sugar ones.  I personally preferred the cinnamon sugar ones.  For those--I put the rolled dough on the grill, put melted butter, then a mixture of cinnamon sugar sprinkled on top and closed the GF grill.  After a couple mins I flipped it, and did the same by adding the butter and cinammon sugar; I closed the GF grill, waited a couple minutes, and done.  Tasted kinda like a cinammon sugar flat yummy pretzel.

I have made this twice and each time it has been a breeze with great results!  I do on an indoor grill pan (sprayed with pan) and they did get nice bubbles.  It's just my husband and I so there are lots in the freezer for future meals.  I meant to try a combo of wheat/all purpose flour both times because I really like roti, maybe next time I'll remember!

This recipe is wonderful! I make it pretty much every week because we go through it so quickly. I make the dough in my bread machine and as suggested by another user, I cut the flour down to 3 1/2 cups. I also only add 1 1/2 tsp of salt. I highly recommend this recipe!

This turned out great!  I may try some of the suggestions from other reviewers (like the baking soda suggestion) but as is, it was easy to make and even easier to eat.  My only mistake was rolling the first couple of breads a little thin and you do need to adjust the heat as you go.

Love it! Don't roll it out to thin, or you will have naan crackers! Also watch for flare-ups from the butter hitting the coals, but it is definitely worth the time spent. Makes a very large batch!

Delicious thank you!! I thought this would be hard but it was really easy! Followed directions exactly, then after step 2 I put the dough balls in the fridge, and grilled the following day on a skillet with some olive oil and baking soda, while brushing with butter. Turned out excellent, went perfectly with the Indian Chicken Curry (Murgh Kari) recipe from this site :)

SOOO SOOO GOOD! Not exactly like the restaurants, but soooo delicious everyone was eating it on its own! Used the bread machine on 'dough' setting which made it really easy. Found that rolling it out as thin as possible made it crispy and so we preferred it a little on the thicker side. Skillet works well, but the grill gave it an awesome smokey texture. With the 3.5 cups of flours suggested by others, the dough was too sticky to roll out. I will be going with 4-4.5 cups next time! Doubled the garlic and did not need to use any of the 'bubbling' tricks.

Turned out great! I did add the 1/2 tsp baking soda as recommended by another reviewer and I used a grill pan on a gas stove and used minimum heat. Very yummy and the entire family loved it. Thanks for sharing!

I decided to make this instead of going to the store to buy pita bread since I had all the ingredients at home. This was so good & easy to make. I served it along w/chicken kabobs, basmati rice, greek salad & tzatziki sauce...my family LOVE IT! Thank you, Mic.

OK, I really liked this.  First of all, it was just plain fun to throw dough on the grill.  As a freshly minted vegan guy who loves his outdoor cooking I was excited to find this naan recipe.  It never occured to me that I could make naan without the tandori oven.

IMPORTANT:  In step 1, the directions omit adding sugar to the water to proof the yeast. If you're not familiar with breadmaking, look up how to proof yeast before attempting this recipe.

I used freshly ground whole wheat with added gluten.  I also used corn starch + water in place of the egg and soy milk.  I know, it sounds like I made a different recipe.  The Naan was denser than it would have been otherwise, but still fairly fluffy (the added gluten helped, I think) and really tasty.

I served it topped with freshly made hummus, diced tomato, and grilled summer squash. It was a filliing and healthy meal.  I was quite pleased with myself. :-)  ...and I got to slap dough on the grill like I knew what I was doing.

Great naan recipe.  I also still need to play around with it a little more to get more of the signature bubbles.  I recommend the rolling the dough very thing.  Also, I've found that adding a little thyme to the recipe adds a very nice taste.

I had never made Naan before, but I often make my own breads this recipe is awesome the Naan turned out just like the picture, the only thing I had to do differently was use an electric skillet as I did not have the grill skillet that they used in the video was so delicious I made it with Jamie Olivers Chicken Skewers/Amazing Satay Sauce Yummy!

After reading the reviews I swapped the milk for plain whole milk yogurt and put the garlic in with the melted butter instead of kneading into the dough.  They turned out fantastic.  Thanks for this recipe.

I cooked this on my baking stone in the oven so that it would be more similar to naan cooked on a tandoori.  It was great!  I recommend using a garlic press rather than mincing the garlic so that it is more evenly distributed and you won't get any small chunks of uncooked garlic in your bread.  I also let the dough rise in my oven on the lowest heat covered with a damp towel and the door open, and it only took about 30 minutes to rise.  It's a good option if you're short on time.

Fantastic - my family went nuts! I followed DakotaBear1's advice and used my breadmaker and reduced flour to 3 1/2 c.  Also, I made smaller balls and just rolled 2 together.  Fried in preheated cast iron pan.  Looked exactly like what I had in the restaurant last week, but tasted even better.  Best naan we've ever had - thanks for submitting!

This recipe gets 3 stars...for now. Most naan recipes I've looked at online call for baking soda. I made this one ONLY because I was clean out of baking soda. The bread tasted fairly good, but it did not bubble and rise like traditional naan, and instead cooked into something that resembled a very dense pancake. 

My husband has served in Afghanistan and ate a lot of traditional flat bread while there, and basically said that this recipe hardly even resembled naan. I'm going to experiment with it a bit and see if adding baking soda helps with the textural problems. As is, it's still a fairly good, edible flat bread and I can think of a million uses for it, but it's no Indian naan.

LOVE THIS.  Would give 5 stars, but the sugar should be more like 3 Tbs. The first time I made this it tasted like Hawaiian sweet bread - which I love, but isn't quite what goes with the Butter Chickpea Curry.   Anyway...delicious, just reduce sugar for a real naan bread taste.

This recipe was good, naan came out good but next time I will follow the suggestion of others here, using 3 1/2 cups of flour and baking soda. i guess 4 1/2 cups was a little too much. i used ghee which gave good flavour to naans.

Started the dough using the sponge method and then divided into 15 balls to rise.  I think my dough was a little dry, so they came out rather thick.  I cooked them over medium-high heat in a large fry pan and they came out lovely.  I will omit the garlic next time as it scorched during the cooking.  I think they needed more salt, but the texture was perfect.

We made naan to go with our chicken tikka masala this evening.  We only had all purpose flour and used brummel and brown instead of butter in the recipe.  We baked ours on our George Foreman grill. This recipe is not only a keeper for Indian food nights, but we are also brainstorming what else we can make this recipe for.  AMAZING.

Was so excited to make this, followed the recipe and reviewers comments exactly - not sure what happened!  The yeast never bubbled and the dough never rose - we ended up a dense, flat pancake that looked terrible but tasted okay!  I'm not defeated, I will try this again!  I seem to not have luck with yeast ... *sigh*

My family thought this was wonderful.  I made it in my bread maker using the dough setting.  I used 3 1/2c. flour per some of the recommendations.  That was a mistake for me.  Before the second rising, I hand-kneaded the last cup of flour into the mix b/c it was so soupy.  This recipe is VERY forgiving, as the final product turned out great!

Wowzers...this was good!  We made it as frybread - in a pan with a little olive oil - it puffed and turned golden in just a couple minutes.  Will make again often, and will also try making on the grill as directed.

This Naan if made exactly as it is written is restaurant quality!  I baked it on my BBQ with some wood chips to give it some smokey flavour.  So great.  My 5 year old daughter loved it and my husband used it instead of his fork to eat his butter chicken. I will make this every time I make curry.

Simple, easy, and makes a large number. Great for taking out to the park for dipping in hummus or most anything else. The garlic adds a nice bit of flavor, though I can certainly see many other additions to this are possible.

I like is a bit sweeter so I used 1/3 cup sugar.  I also added the sugar to the warm water and yeast. This recipe is wonderful!! I have made it 3x in 2 weeks.  My family fought over it.

Would've been five stars, but cooking on grill was a bit tricky to make the dough lie flat... quite a process actually. Delicious though, a big hit! Will make again but when I cook it on the grill will try doing it in bigger pieces instead of the small pancake size servings of naan. Seems it would be easier to make bigger and then tear as you eat it. Loved it though, especially with the garlic, but would recommend using more than suggested, or mixing garlic with the melted butter and then brushing that mixture on. So excited to find a recipe to make naan at home!

This was so good!!!  We all loved it.  I didn't change a thing and it was so easy.  I mixed it up in my kitchen aid and then let it raise.  Even rolling them out didn't take anything.  I will be making again.  I think this will be really good with chili.

I took a chance today on trying this to take to a picnic along with Hummus III from this site, and I'm so glad I did.  I was nervous it wouldn't work out and time was tight so it was something from the store if it didn't, but happily I didn't have to go to the store.  I will say the rising time is definitely longer than 1 hr initially (and yes I did proof the yeast) unless you help it along a little.  I turned my oven on for about 30 seconds and then off and put it in there helping it along somewhere warmer than room temp.  Rolling out the dough and grilling was surprisingly quick.  I opted to stir some garlic into my butter instead of putting in the dough, and cooked on low-med heat on the grill, about 2 minutes per side.  Loved the bread, just sweet enough and super yummy with the Hummus.

I'm sure I messed up a bit.  Was only able to add about 4 cups of flour.  I let it rise all afternoon because I started early.  I don't have a grill, so used a skilled.  Wasn't as light and fluffy as the real thing, no air pockets, but was still good.  I only cooked half and put the rest covered in the fridge.  Will cook them tomorow with my leftovers.  Hopefully my next attempt will be better.

This naan takes forever to make but if you want authentic Indian bread with your curry or tikka masala I highly recommend this recipe, however I always omit the garlic.

SO Delicious!  I made this quickly last night on a whim to serve with a chickpea tikka masala. I usually buy naan at the grocery store, but didn't this time. Since it was just for the two of us, I halved the recipe.  I used fresh garlic from my own garden and it was fabulous.  I cooked the naan on a George Foreman style Swedish grill and it was perfect.  I didn't really "pull" the dough as much in the first couple of pieces, but by #3, it was chewy, crispy goodness. It was so much better than the store bought variety.  It tasted like and was the consistency of what is served in authentic Indian restaurants.  We had it for dinner and again with lunch today and can't wait to make it again!

Good with the garlic, or plain!  I ended up halving the recipe but adding a full egg, and then skipping the butter at the end to balance out the liquids and solids.  Also, used half whole wheat flour.

So soft and yummy.  Added the 1/2 tsp baking soda recommended by others.  Rose beautifully.  Hubby cooked on grill just until grill marks were nice and dark but bread was still white.  To some I added garlic paste to the dough balls.  Just put a dallop of garlic paste in some of the portioned dough balls.  Flatten out thin.  Not see thru thin but like tortilla thin.  Hubby and I ate half by ourselves.  Haven't been home to see how they are the next day but can't wait for dinner.

This was great! I had never made naan before. I was surprised by how easy it was. I decided to cook the naan on a hot pan on the stove rather than the grill. I also omitted the garlic from the dough but instead let it soak in with the butter as someone suggested. It turned out great! I will definitely make again.

Very good! I followed the recipe to a T in my bread machine. I cooked them in a large well seasoned cast iron skillet- no oil worked best for me. These are soft (be careful not to overcook) and delicious. We eat them any time of day. Breakfast, snack, with supper- they are just that good. New staple in the house. (if you brush lightly with butter and then sprinkle with salt fresh from the pan they taste like soft pretzels- oh yum!)

Quite honestly, I think this is a really good pizza dough. We did like this, but just not as good as we like-it was good just not a traditional tasting naan. I will make this again, since it is the best I've found. Plus, now I have a new pizza dough recipe. This is very versatile and can be seasoned according to one's preferences. I took the suggestion of one and added sugar to my yeast and warm water in order to proof. Let this rise in a slightly warmed oven. I grilled this on my George Foreman. Also, I used AP flour as I did not have bread flour. This is a good basic dough.

This is my first attempt at making flatbread and I just won't bother looking any further for a recipe.  This recipe turned out perfectly!  I used the suggestion of chopped garlic and it was wonderful - so buttery and garlicky!  I usually buy Naan bread to serve as the base for individual pizzas - but I'm not going to bother spending a dime at the grocery store for the packaged variety . Do yourselves a favour and give this a try!  I wish I could give it 10 stars!

LOVE This recipe. The best we have ever had. Since we live in the windy state of Texas we can't grill it but we throw it in a nonstick pan. It works out great. Don't add any oil though. Messes it up. We like to add a little garlic spread to it when we flip it. The best Naan recipe we have found

This was my first try at making naan and my husband says it was good.  We followed the recipe and used our grill.  We did put crushed garlic into the ghee when we brushed the naan.  It really makes a nice difference.  We both noticed it was a little sweet with 1/4 c. of sugar.  Next time I'll leave it at the 1 Tbsp. of sugar for proofing.  You don't need baking powder to achieve the little bubbles.  We used the grill on high and rolled the dough fairly thin.  If you have thick dough, the bubbles won't show as much.  We'll use this again.  Thanks, Mic.

Wow just got done making this naan and it is really good. The changes from the instructions that I made were that I used just 1/4 cup of the water with the yeast and 1 tsp of sugar and proofed it and then followed the rest of the recipe adding the remaining water with the other ingredients. I will be using this as a flatbread for my taco dinner tonight. I will also use less sugar next time cause the naan tastes a little sweet. Overall this recipe is a keeper!

I followed the recipe word for word... perfect! Next time I will experiment with a little more garlic, or raisins, sesame seeds etc. This is a non fail recipe. My guests last night voted it the highlight of the meal. Thanks Mic!

So good!  If you want to have more bubbles, I find it helps to roll out a few circles, and then let them "rest" even just for a minute or two. I find that this makes more bubbles.  Also, when I used high heat, they burned :(

Best best best! I couldn't stop eating these  things. If you are staying away from carbs, avoid this like the plague. If a carb doesn't scare you, I recommend highly. Flour was way too much though, I added 3-1/4 and it was plenty. Almost as good as any Indian Restaurant I have been to.

We had trouble with this, they came out like little hard loaves.  Not fluffy at all.  But they tasted good so we are willing to give this another try.

I absolutely loved making this recipe. I was a bit worried that it wouldn't turn out right - we don't have bread flour readily available. I read through the comments and noticed the bit about the half teaspoon of baking soda getting the bubbles to come up. Upon getting everything put together and all the dough rolled out, it cooked perfectly! I will be having these with the garlic black bean chicken I made and will definitely be making these again!

The yeast packet I had was .31  ounces, besides that followed recipe exactly. It was delicious and perfect. Bubbles starting popping up as soon as they hit the grill. I was afraid that I had rolled them out too thin but they grew a lot when cooking as well. We're making this every time we're grilling now. Thanks!

I thought this naan was outstanding. I followed the recipe, and had to play around a bit with the grilling before it started turning out the way I expected. I learned I should roll the dough very, very thin. Medium-high heat was enough. I also stopped buttering anything until it was done. In the dry pan, it bubbled and puffed up beautifully. Adding the butter afterward helped the flavor of our dinner, but it seemed to hinder the bubbling if I added it during cooking. I will definitely be making this again!

The only problem with this recipe was that it's very hard to stop eating them. We followed the recipe exactly, including the minced garlic. When mixing in the garlic (from jarred minced garlic), I thought that 2 teaspoons was too much. It's not. After they are cooked, it's perfect. We cooked them on a grill thing placed over our gas range and it worked great.

Super easy (but time consuming). I accidentally "proofed" the yeast as another reviewer discussed (I had to go to the store to buy milk after I already added the sugar), and it came out perfect.

This was so good, followed a few others advanced and made it on the dough cycle on bread machine with 3.5 cups of flour and also cooked on George Foreman Grill. Delish. I served it with the Shrimp Curry recipe found on this site

Great recipe - I forgot the egg as I'm not used to using it in bread recipes, but it still turned out REALLY good.  We used a hot frypan with a coating of butter and once cooked we stacked the breads with a dab of butter and a smear of minced garlic between (not diet friendly but fine as a treat).

I live in Germany for the time being, and I used type 405 flour, which has about 9% protein.  The texture was fantastic!!  I added some toasted cumin and coriander seeds, ground after toasting.  This took a considerable amount of time to rise, I would say almost 2 hours...probably due to the cold kitchen...either way it was delicious and I am proud of it..so thanks for sharing the recipe!!

I made a veganized version of this recipe.  I think this recipe is really good and hard to screw up, but I did modify it per other reviewers.  I used 2.5 c bread flour, 1 c whole wheat flour, and replaced the milk with soy milk and used EnerG egg replacer for the egg.  I also added 1/2 tsp of baking soda to make it bubble.  It was delicious.  Like an elephant ear (minus the sugar and cinammon).  My son kept wanting more.

This recipe was AWESOME.  The only changes I made were to add garlic powder to the melted butter instead of putting minced garlic in the dough, and I didn't heat my griddle as hot.  If you want them big enough to use as "wraps", roll the dough balls bigger than golf balls...

Yum. Used 3.5 cups all purpose flour. melted the garlic in the butter with some veg. oil using the microwave. Then used a cast iron skillet to cook them up, brushed them with the garlic butter during flipping.

This recipe was so easy and fun.  I was just excited to actually be making naan by hand!  Next time I make this I will add some additional spices such as green onion, thyme, rosemary, or sage.

This naan is great! I made it exactly as the recipe said, except that I cooked it on the stove top in a cast iron pan, as I don't have access to a grill. I will definitely be making this again. Thanks for the recipe!

We have tried so many naan recipes and loved this one!  We actually were in a huge hurry and couldn't even let it rest and it was still delicious!  My kids even ate it and asked when I was going to make it again!  Great recipe...I didn't put all the sugar in since I thought it would be too sweet.

I made this a few nights ago for an impromptu Indian themed dinner. Let me tell you this recipe makes some great naan. I followed the proofing directions on the package of yeast that I used and had great success. I added about 1/2 teaspoons of baking soda(recommended by another reviewer) for extra bubbles, and I did not use all the butter that was called for in the recipe. I cooked my naan on my electric griddle(at 375)which I lightly greased and seasoned with fennel and cardamon seeds. Fantastic recipe over all, it allowed me to make tons of fluffy, yummy naan at a fraction of the cost compared to the local Indian eateries in the area.

I have a big family, so to save time, I simply dump the entire dough onto a floured surface, roll very thin, and use my pizza cutter to form rectangles.....instead of circles. It works FABULOUS!!!

I also added cilantro to the (garlic) butter to brush on. Made this in my tiny kitchen in my Japanese apartment - to RAVE reviews! Looked up the recipe to make for my parents this week. Oishi!!! (delicious in Japanese)

Just like authentic Naan. My BF is a picky Indian food critic. We like authentic, not americanized ethnic foods. Try this with Sag Panner. SO good!

I still am leery of making anything that requires yeast - I just haven't got the knack for proofing and kneading yet.  I wasn't really happy with how the dough rose, but in the end it worked out fine!  I used a little garlic powder instead of fresh, and sprinkled the naan with a little onion powder before grilling.  Came out great!

Delicious!  I used half wheat flour, but followed the recipe aside from that.  Very easy and great with curry.

This recipe is really good. I was tired of picking through the limited selection of Naan bread at my local supermarket, set out to find a recipe to make on my own and this was perfect! I added goat cheese (couldn't find paneer in the market) by rolling out the balls, placing it in the center, then pressing the dough around the cheese before cooking it to mimic the cheesy naan bread we get at the restaurant, and it was perfect. My boyfriend is in love with naan and curry and you should have seen the look on his face after he tasted this bread with the chicken tikka masala that I made him! It was a look of pure ecstasy and satisfaction brought on by food!!

I've never had naan before but I made it for a World Vision house party potluck that had the theme of food around the world to go with a Dominican stew that I made.  I used fast-acting/bread machine yeast so I wouldn't have to proof it (you just add it at the same time as the other ingredients at once) and made it on an electric griddle.  It was definitely easy to make and tasted good.  It was sweeter than I expected (though not sweet per se).  I think next time I'd make it with a little more salt and a little less sugar, but I guess it wouldn't be authenic. :)  Thanks for the recipe. :)

Great! The only changes I made were proofing the yeast and omitting the garlic. I cooked the naan on an indoor countertop grill and it turned out perfectly. We got 16 rounds out of this recipe.

Wonderful and versatile. It hints of something from one's childhood that cannot be placed exactly. Slightly sweet, but still works well with savoury dishes. Use for sandwiches or stand alone.

I have a naan recipe that I have been using for years, and it is ok - but nothing close to the light fluffy bread you get at indian restaurants, so I decided to try this one.  I replaced the milk with kefir and used mostly fresh milled flour - so it was a whole wheat naan.  I LOVED these.  And I loved cooking them on the grill.  I have both cooked naan in the oven and pan fried it (West Indian version - roti) but this was by far the best way to cook it - and the easiest.  I froze some of the dough after the first rising and will use it later.

Perfect! My whole family loved this! I also added some dried minced onion when I added the garlic and I added crushed garlic to my butter that I brushed on. It was amazing! This recipe, minus the garlic and onion, would make a great healthy substitute for fried scones for a dessert!

This is really good!!!  I cooked it over my gas flame on my gas stove using my grill griddle that has holes in it.  Temperature was way over 600 degrees with it so close to the flame.  It cooked beautifully!

I had my doubts as I was kneading this dough. Not wanting to purchase bread flour, I removed 4 tbsps of AP and added the same of Vital Wheat Gluten. The dough was incredibly tough to knead and it took three hours for it to rise even a little.   Before cooking, I heated a cast iron pan in the oven to get it nice and hot. I rolled out my balls of dough (they did soften a bit as they sat), which made close to 20 huge pieces. I carefully placed them in the dry pan for no more than 1 min. each side. They bubbled and darkened perfectly! As they were removed, I brushed them with a little butter and garlic.  The end result is great. They're the perfect combination of chewy and soft (the gluten really made these work). I wrapped up the leftovers in foil and brought them to work today. They're even better reheated in the microwave for 30 seconds.

YUUUMMMMMM!!!!!!!!! I followed the recipe exactly. I have made it twice in the past 2 weeks and will be making every time I make my new favorite dish on this site, Chicken Jalfrezi. I'm new to Indian cuisine, but this recipe and the Jalfrezi recipe have got me wanting to try more! Thanks Mic for posting this!

The texture of this Naan was absolutely perfect. I used 3 cloves of roasted garlic instead of raw and it was very subtle. Also, used light brown sugar because I didn't have any white sugar in the house and it was ok.

Excellent Naan bread!!! I could not fully use all of the flour and I could only make 12 not 14 breads. Not sure how to get them really big like in the restaurants but the taste was excellent, even reheated. I loved the garlic in them. Next time I will use fresh garlic...

Love this recipe.  You don't need to be exact with measurements and it still turns out.  I like to cook them in a dry cast iron pan.  I rarely brush them with butter and they are still delicious.

I was surprised that it came out so good!  I do not bake at all but I followed the directions (including how to activate the yeast first).  I had to set the bowl outside in the sun for it to rise a little quicker.  Direct medium heat on the BBQ and they came out great!

This was my first time eating Naan bread.  I followed one reviewer and mixed the minced garlic with butter and brushed it on the bread while grilling.  My family LOVED it.  It turned out better than I could have expected, and it was fairly easy to prepare as well.

Wow, so wonderful. So many ways to use this. We've used this for red lentil curry, mini pizza, open face crunchy peanut butter sandwhich, etc. Notes: next time, use bread machine/4 cups flour; for all-purpose, use 3.5 cups

I really didn't care for this recipe at all.  I found it quite bland, and had hoped for a more traditional taste.  he Naan I have had in the past was a wonderful, warm tastey treat.  This was not it.

The recipe is fantastic. It turned out even better than at my favorite Indian restaurant. Just be certain to only add the flour a little at a time. I only needed about 3 1/2 cups. I also didn't knead the garlic into the dough. I just put it in the melted butter and let it sit for awhile, then brushed it on. And for desert, I just brushed plain butter onto the naan, then sprinkled it with cinnamon and sugar right after I pulled it out of the oven.  I don't have a grill, so I made it in the oven. I put a caste aluminum pan in the oven preheated it to 400 degrees, then followed all the cooking times according the recipe. I also didn't need to grease the pan at all. Enjoy!

I feel like I discovered America!  Made this recipe and the yield was more than I expected.  Three days later I had the idea to try PIZZA!  Well, let me tell you  .  .  .  a covering of tomato sauce, a sprinkling of Italian seasonings, a cover of pepperoni all topped with mozzarela, popped in the toaster oven at max, waited for the cheese to bubble up and  .  .  .  BRAVO!  Better than ANY pizza I have EVER tasted anywhere!!!

I made these for an Indian dinner party that I had this weekend.  I made them a day ahead and the night of the dinner I heated them up a bit in the oven.  I followed the recipe exactly as written although I did not use garlic.  Also, I cooked them on the Barbeque!!! They turned out picture perfect...they bubbled up and browned perfectly.  They are much better than any Naan bread you will find in grocery store.  Will definitely make again and again...would be great for bbq with souvlaki kabobs!!

Made this bread tonight to go with my Barbados Style Curry Chicken.  It's the first time I ever made Naan.  A-M-A-Z-I-N-G!  Used the George Foreman grill - sans butter and garlic.  Truly delicious.  Chewing the first one as I type this.  DH is going to marry me all over again! LOL

Wonderful recipe ! To cut calories I do not brush with butter. They are still Awesome. I make a large batch hoping to have some for later and no matter how many I make they seem to disappear. I serve them with soup, hummus, steak dinner, you name it! I even get rave reviews from people who aren't inclined to eat Indian food. You can substitute these for any pita recipe too. For anyone on WW, if you do not use butter and other wise make as directed (14 servings) they are only 2 points each!!!

love this recipe. only thing I did differently was to add 1  Tbsp sugar to yeast mixture, as suggested by other reviewers. Cooked them on Foreman grill and they were fantastic!! Dipped it in Tzatziki sauce and served with Greek salad.

I wanted to make this for a party of 40 people this week, so I was determined to make it work. I had to make it EIGHT TIMES over the past couple weeks before I finally got the results everyone has been raving about. The trick for me was not to roll them too thin and *especially* to cook them in the oven at 400 degrees for no more than 2.5 minutes each side. I brushed one side with basil pesto and the other with olive oil and I couldn't be happier. OH SNAP.

I made these to go with a Indian dinner buffet I had made for dinner one night. By the time I got to the table to sit down and eat the naan was almost gone. I did not add the butter and garlic. I just grilled it and place on a plate.

This naan is exceptional! It is even great broiled in the oven until golden brown if a grill is not accessible.

This recipe was absolutely wonderful!  I used a rolling pin to roll the dough out as flat as possible to get the consistency I wanted and I cooked them in a grill pan on the stovetop.  I got rave reviews for them!

Delicious!  Mine turned out very thin, as opposed to some of the pictures of this recipe--but they bubbled up just fine, and tasted great, so I guess I did it right!  Made LOTS--like 24 naans!  Oh, and DO use as little flour as you can, as one reviewer suggested.  After all the mixing, kneading, and rolling out, I still had about 1/2 cup flour left from the original 4 and 1/2 cups the recipe called for.

This turned out delicious. I don't think it's quite as puffy as traditional naan, but for my first time making it, it was great with tandoori chicken & basmati rice.     i think for me that the biggest issue was that the dough was very difficult to work with. i used at least 5c of flour (which was ap, not bread). it was very very sticky and it stuck to everything. kneading by hand was impossible. i used my stand mixer for about 8min and got a very nice dough, but again, it was so sticky that my hands were covered by the time I rolled it over to coat with oil.     otherwise, i would easily make this again. great taste and very fast to cook up.

First time I ever tried to do naan and the resullt brought me compliments galore! easy and quick, solved what used to be a mistery for me (in indian restaurants I always wondered about how could they possibly do it?). The garlic powder bit makes the difference but I'll try with grated cheese also as a lot of indian places have cheese naan! ty for this recipe

Excellent - the garlic is wonderful. In a pinch (and it was snowing) we used our cast iron skillet on low heat, preheated. I, too ended up rolling these pretty thick to keep them nice and puffy and tender (my first one was too tortilla-like). I'm thinking grilling would make them puff up more without burning? Excited to try this on the grill!!! My husband asked if we could just keep these on hand all the time. THEY'RE GOOD.  Oh, and when they dry out a bit after a couple days - cut into triangles and toast to crispy chips for hummus or roasted garlic and goat cheese - OVER the top delicious!!!   THANKS FOR THE RECIPE!!!

Very good. Fried it in a cast iron pan because it was winter, and still excellent.  Nice texture, and good with the garlic.  The dough was very easy to roll out. Tried it again, grilled on the barbie.  Left out the garlic - Amazing!  This will be a treat all BBQ season! Had it with Tandoori chicken and corn on the cob - yumm!

This was incredible. It was winter when I made these, so grilled inside on my cast iron griddle pan. It smoked up the house, but well worth the effort. Would probably work best on outdoor grill, and puff up a little better as well. Yum!!!

Very good! We have made the naan a few times now. We have found that leaving it a bit thicker makes it seem a little more hardy. We grilled ours on our BBQ which provided a nice flavor.

I tried this recipe just as it states but had to throw out the 1st. batch of dough. The second try was much better, althougth I am not sure what the problem was in the first place.  I cut 1.5 cups of the flour out, added 1 more tbs. of milk and more salt.  I also included 1 tsp. of baking powder.  When mixing the yeast.  I added 1/4 of the sugar and the rest I added to the dry mix.  I did okay rolling out the dough but find it much easier to use a tortilla press.  I also allowed the dough to rise longer.  As for pans, I used a cast iron pan but didn't like to irony taste, my third batch tasted better to me using a coated cast iron pan.  These went very well with my lamb gyro sandwiches.

Great summertime treat hot off the grill. Serve with honey butter for a sweet delight. These are a labor of love but worth it. Neighbors request this every year at BBQ's.

Mmmmmmmm!   I made my first attempt at Indian food last night and made this to go with tikki masala.  I left out the garlic in the dough and mixed it with the melted butter.  I used the George Foreman grill and it worked out fabulously!

This was awesome! Very time consuming, but totally worth it. I used this with Sean's Falafel recipe and it was fantastic. Since the falafel had a garlic sauce already I just left the garlic out of the bread. I thought the taste and texture of this was much closer to Greek pita bread than Indian Naan bread, but that is okay because it was excellent either way. TIP: If you want to use these as Pita or wraps, make sure you make the balls of dough bigger than a golf ball- other wise it comes out much too small to wrap anything up in. Thanks for the awesome recipe!

Tasted great but was more like pita bread than naan bread.  I used all whole wheat flour and cooked in the oven (preheated to 450 degrees for 30 minutes, then turned on the broil and baked directly on the grill 4" from the top of the oven for 3-4 min per side.  I froze some and they still tasted great defrosted & reheated under the broil for a few minutes.

Oh my gosh this was good. We love to eat Indian food and I really didn't think that making these naan would come close to the resteraunt variety. I need to practice a little bit with the timing on the grill but these were goooood.

This recipe is my absolute FAVORITE! We make it all the time! I have it down by memory. We like to put olive oil in the bowl and then olive oil down when we cook it. Then brush it with butter and it tastes SO YUMMY! We always use garlic as well. We even tried putting pizza sauce and cheese and it tasted delicious! Thank you soo much for this wonderful recipe! I have shared it with everyone and it is a big hit with everyone that tries it!

Perfect recipe!  Labor-intensive (as any bread is) but worth making extras. I used a griddle pan and it worked perfectly.  To heat up the next day, just put in a lightly oiled frying pan at a med heat.  Served with Butter Chickpea Curry from this site and it was great!

Best Naan ever.  After rolling into ball, put into oven at lowest setting after covering with the door open for about 15 minutes.  Used about 4 cups bread flour and got really nice bubbling and puffing on the grill.

This is the best Naan bread I have ever had. I decreased the amount of sugar to 2 tbsp. because my family does not favor sweet bread. Absolutely scrumptious!

FANTASTIC! it took the 3 hours to make but they were at hit! I took 1/4 C.olive oil and 1/4 C.melted smart balance butter(its much healthier than regular butter) with about a tsp of oregano and basted that on each side of the Naan. Everyone loved them.

This is probably the best naan I have ever had and the easiest experience making bread of any kind.  I had to put it away so I didn't eat it all myself.  It was so good...

Very good. We made the naan to go with the vegetable curry dish from this site and it was super yummy. I went half on this recipe. There was plenty for my husband and I and for lunch the next day. Thanks!

This is an amazing Naan recipe.  We double and triple it and freeze them to enjoy when we want.  Try it!  Add the garlic and you will be impressed even more.

I followed the instructions exactly and came out with 1) a TON of naan that I had to split and freeze, and 2) the best bread I have ever made. This was worth the effort. I'm eating leftover naan I'd cooked and put in the fridge 2 days later, and it's still melty in the mouth, not chewy at all like other bread. Next time I will sautee some onions and steam peas and put 2 naan together for grilled stuffed naan. Had that once at a restaurant and loved it. GREAT RECIPE!!!

Great flavor, but kind of tough. Perhaps it was the humidity levels that day, or I might have over worked the dough? I'm not sure what, exactly, went wrong but it was definitely tasty enough to try again.

Mmmm. My Indian husband tasted one and said that the flavor was spot on. I thought these were even better than what I've had in restaurants, and they were easy. I had no issues with the dough rising, but I primed the yeast (add a tbsp of sugar to the warm water and yeast and wait for it to get foamy).

I made this naan last night.  It was a bit tough.  I will try to make it again and add a bit of baking soda and reduce the amount of flour.  I'm near sea level so perhaps that was the reason for the problem.

I've searched for a naan recipe for years, have literally tried over a dozen variations.  This is it!  Texture, appearance & taste rivaled the best Indian restaurant version.  Just me so I halved the recipe and went a little lighter on the flour.  Roll out time, I dusted the board/roller generously.  I think the lighter dough increased the rise.  I've made this 3 times in as many days with slight measurement variations because I'm sloppy with that and there was no problem.  I'm in a dry, high altitude area BTW.  I'm glad to quit the search for the perfect naan.

I would have to have the most fussiest 7 year old on the face of this beautiful planet of ours and he absolutely looovvved this naan. I am over the moon. I made mine using my bread maker as I loathe using my fingers with dough. I needed to add more water and didn't read the instructions properly so added the 55g of butter with the rest of the ingredients and it is buuuuuuutttiful. Thank you so much. This recipe will be passed on to so many people down here in Australia. Kindest regards, Rita.

Absolutely delicious! Thank you very much for this recipe. I used other user’s suggestions: crushed garlic into the butter instead of kneading it into the dough, rolled dough really thin and kept grill closed while cooking. It came out perfect with many bubbles. I will try George Forman grill in the winter, for now regular grill worked fine. I had to play a little finding the best position/temperature on my grill. Otherwise, it was amazing.

I modified it by adding plain yogurt and adding baking soda as past reviewers stated. I couldn't get mine to rise that well, but it still turned out decent. I would definitely recommend pan frying instead of baking. Baking leaves it too coarse with little flavor. I didn't have a grill to use so the pan served me well.

I've made this recipe several times. It's excellent. Labor intensive, but well worth the work. My husband had never heard of naan. I've now got him hooked on naan and my homemade hummus. The only thing I change is to melt the garlic into the butter rather than folding it into the dough. I have only cooked them on a cast iron skillet. I can't wait to try it on a grill sometime.

Simple tasty recipe. Explore variations of seasoning if you like. I enjoy a splash of onion powder and a pinch of cayenne in the dough.  Chopped cilantro or parsley can be added too. I use yogurt instead of milk because I like that tang. Double up on the recipe and store extra dough in the fridge for the next day! Nothing else will do for the family once they have tasted this bread though. I use a tortilla press to flatten the dough before cooking, works well and goes much faster than rolling it out, also you don't dry it out with all the extra four needed for rolling.

The flavor of this is excellent but 4.5 cups of flour is way too much.  My dough was extremely dry and did not rise much even after 4 hours.  I think my house is too cold as well.  Will try rising in an oven with a bowl of warm water next time and using much less flour.

I do not like to knead bread so I used my bread machine and just used the dough cycle; i also added the garlic in the bread machine.  Then I do not like the grill so I used a panni machine.  I could have eaten the enire batch; it made great pizzas for my toddlers.

Soooo good! I really didn't make any changes except I added 1 TBS of sugar for the first rising period because other reviewers said to "proof" the yeast. I didn't kneed in garlic, but instead when I was grilling, I added garlic powder to the butter and just spread it on there. I'm not sure why there were so many reviews regarding the "secret" to making it bubble, because ours came out very bubbly. To get it flat, you sort of just "shake" it out to get it to stretch and then just pull out the areas that are still thick. Absolutely delicious and so easy to make! Also-- definitely do it on the grill and make sure to not over cook it on each side.

I had never attempted naan before, but this recipe made it easy.  I think I added a little too much flour which made the dough a little rubbery, but they ended up coming out great.  I used extra garlic as suggested and grilled them as the recipe called for and they turned out well.

Best homemade naan recipe I've tried yet (and I've tried a lot of them from online sources).  The only substitution I made was to use re-constituted powdered skim milk instead of regular milk - worked like a charm!  My dough didn't rise all that much during the first rising, so I was a bit nervous, but by the end of the second rising, I got a soft, smooth, beautifully pliable dough that stretched perfectly without making holes, and puffed up wonderfully in the pan!  Absolutely delicious!!! ^_^

Made this flatbread with an Indian Chicken Curry recipe.  Cooked on the Forman Grill as another Reviewer mentioned, and it worked brilliantly.  A slightly sweet, fantastic consistency bread.  (I was in a hurry and wasn't able to let it rise as much as it said, so I rose for 30 minutes, punched it down, and cooked it straight away similar to other flat bread recipes.)

Wow!!!  My husband and I made this tonight and we are stuffing ourselves.  We followed the recipe to a "T".  In our experience, rolling the dough as thin as possible was the secret to creating those wonderful bubbles on the bread.

This made a terrific flatbread; but to call it "Naan" is stretching it a bit.  I ended up only using 3 1/2 cups of flour and it was enough.  I would make this again (minus the garlic), but to serve with the Serbian Cevapcici recipe (minus the pork) from this site.  Now THATS a good combination!!  Thanks for sharing the recipe!

It was easy enough.  I used a grill pan on the stove top at medium high heat (setting of 8)  Served the naan with Tikka Masala.

I read all of the reviews before making the naan and made it as follows... 1 Tbs yeast (I have a jar not a packet) and 1 Tbs sugar together in the water.  Put the minced garlic in directly with the other wet ingredients, taking out the work of kneading garlic into risen dough!!  I cooked the bread on a skillet at medium-high heat, buttering each side.  The resulting naan was delicious!

I agree with the other few people on this recipe. Its not naan, more like a sweet flatbread pancake. It wasn't bad, just not naan. I made some chutney to go with it and it just didn't do the job. Too much sugar and flour were called for in my opinion.

My family really loves this recipe!  We have used it in several different dinners as a side, part of the main course, or as a snack.  Our favorite by far is our own Naan bread pizza.  While on the grill and finishing the bread off, just add some sauce, and all the toppings of your favorite pizza.

Excellent recipe.  I omitted the oil and made the dough and let it rise in a bread machine, I did need to add a small amount of additional water.  I've made this with and without garlic....definitely prefer it with garlic.  I've also tried using spray butter instead of real butter, just to make it a little easier/lighter.  There is a taste difference and I'll take the extra fat/calories and use real butter in the future.

First time making it, was fairly successful. I don't think I rolled it out thin enough because the pieces were rather small and it was a thicker bread than I've eaten at my local Indian restaurants. Try, try again I will--it was really great otherwise.

This is simple for even someone (like me!) who never makes dough recipes for fear of messing up :) When proofing, add a spoonful of sugar to activate the yeast. 
Also, I brushed the sides with a mixture of melted margarine and garlic powder while cooking. I made it on the stovetop and it bubbled up perfectly and cooked evenly. Thanks for the recipe!

My spouse thinks this is fantastic! I made it without the garlic because I wanted to taste what the basic recipe was like. I think I'll leave out the brushing with butter if I make them again, it seems to make them burn too fast and adds grease. I also found (like many of the other reviewers) that cooking them on the skillet worked best on a medium-low heat rather than high because they burn so very fast. I made this recipe because I was making curry, and it was the one that didn't call for yogurt (I don't have any). Maybe I'll try it with yogurt instead of milk next time and see if it tastes a bit more "authentic," as this seemed a little more like plain old flatbread to me that what I think of as naan. It was still tasty, though!

Great recipe!  I also added 1 teaspoon of kalonji (onion seed) at same time as adding garlic.

Made recipe based on 7 servings (which makes about 7 medium naan)... more than half was eaten in one meal by the two of us.  I would suggest making the full recipe (serves 14) if making for 4-6 people.

This was great. I made a few changes: instead of adding chopped garlic I added a scant tablespoon (or less?) of garlic powder to the flour before mixing. I also used soy milk instead of milk. I made the dough in my bread machine, then made the balls and let them raise again. I pan fried them, since I don't have a grill. I had some dough that I didn't have time to cook, so I layerd it with parchment paper and froze it in a container. I made them last night and they were just as good as the first batch I made. Thanks for this recipe! (I served the Naan with chicken, peppers and onions sauteed with a little garlic and olive oil, it wasn't Indian, but it was good!)

Delicious!  I grilled them outside while the chicken tikka masala was grilling at the same time.  The timing worked out great and the naan was superb.  (I substituted yogurt for the milk as one reviewer suggested.  Great idea!)

I have been searching for a fantastic Naan recipe for years.  My search is over as this one meets theory and application.  I took the advice of other reviews i.e., added 1/2 t. of baking soda and grilled in a searing/grill pan on stovetop.  For "stretchiness" without being tough - I added 1 teaspoon of xanthum gum - big difference!  Bob's Red Mill offers a natural healthy xanthum gum.  If you really love Naan as our family and friends do - I guarantee, this recipe is sure to please.

I thought this tasted pretty much like pizza dough.  It still worked okay with the korma that I prepared, but overall, it just didn't taste like naan and I wasn't too impressed.

Wife loves it and much less expensive than store bought Naan. We use it to dip in homemade Daal. I use my bread machine and follow the directons except I put hte Egg ( I do not pre Beat) and butter( I do not melt it) with the liquids. Nice and rich.

THANK YOU!!!

This was a great naan bread. Nice and chewy and just a little hint of garlic.  I made them just as it states only instead of using  a grill, I fried them in some butter in a frying pan. They were nice and bubbly and just perfect. Lovely.

My fiance and I are HUGE Indian cuisine fans and this recipe has become one of our trademarks. We love making Naan together on rainy days!!  We make it as it (except we use a buttered up skillet instead of a grill).  Highly recommend this bread to make a truly authentic yummy meal that even my country-livin' meat and potatoes lovin' relatives loved!!

These were OK. Mine looked more like a tortilla than naan though; nothing like the picture. TIP: if you cook them on your stovetop in a frying pan, do NOT set the burner on high, as the directions instruct you to do. That will burn the naan badly!! But overall, the recipe was pretty good. I won't be buying as much of the store-bought stuff in the future. 4 stars. Thanks for posting the recipe.

Delicious! I kneaded in a little garlic, but used the rest in the melted butter that I brushed on top. The dough came out a little tough, probably because I added a bit too much flour.

Love this recipe! I put minced garlic in with the butter before I melt it, then let it stand for at least 10 minutes before I start cooking the naan.

My husband and kids went crazy for this deliciouse bread. I served it right off the bbq to accompany a saucy Tikka Masala (from this site) and I was praised all through dinner.  Thanks, Mic, for the easy recipe and making me look so talented.

This is not exactly authentic naan, but it does make a yummy flatbread that accompanies Indian food well.  You definitely should try it with the garlic (it's delicious that way), just saute the garlic first before adding it to the dough for improved flavor.  Also after I brush the cooked naan with butter I lightly sprinkle on some kosher salt, it seems to compliment the garlic.

Very good.  We love naan bread but it is hit and miss when we can find it at our grocery.  I tried adding the baking soda as per another suggestion and it did create some nice bubbles, but I found it made the bread a little too thick for our liking no matter how thin I rolled it out.  Might try it without next time to see if it was that or just me!  Still didn't last very long!

AMAZING! To make wonderful garlic naan, double the amount of fresh, chopped garlic (4 tsp.) and mix it in with the wet ingredients and first two cups of flour. This way, the garlic is evenly distributed. Also, I only used 1 1/4 tbs. salt.

Delish!!!!
I used another suggestion about using garlic butter instead of adding the garlic into the dough and I'm glad I did!!
I served this with Butter Chicken over rice.
Rolled nice & thin and I used my electric griddle instead. Turned out perfect!

Worked well on my stove top grill pan.  Make sure to roll it out thin for the best results.  It will puff up like at the restaurant if it's thin enough.

Great recipe - I had to broil them in the oven because all my pots & pans were being used...and used quick rise yeast because I was out of traditional - still turned out fantastic, thanks!  (next time I'll obey the recipe!)

I am currently living in a dorm room in South Korea with two gas burners as my only means of cooking.  Since I cannot buy naan, I was looking for a way to make it and stumbled upon this recipe.  It's incredibly simple and I was successfully able to make it.  I used a frying pan at medium heat and a little oil in a non-stick pan.  Instead of rolling out dough I used my hands instead.  I did add the tablespoon sugar to the yeast mixture at the beginning and a teaspoon of baking soda so that my naan had bubbles when I cooked it.

I could only give the recipe 3 stars because it called for WAY too much flour. If someone had never made bread before, they would never get this recipe to work. As another user said, much LESS flour. Definately 3 cups.

Easy and really good.  Tastes very authentic, from someone who's eaten naan in India.  We didn't need baking soda for the nice bubbles - the key is to get it uniformly thin before grilling.  We used a grill pan on the stove top (since it's Jan. in MN) and it worked great.  Looking forward to trying it with a baking stone on the charcoal grill come warmer weather.

I made the dough in my bread machine.  I used my Foreman grill to cook the bread, brushing with butter during the process.  It's best to roll each piece as you go.  What a wonderful recipe!

These were very good.  I didn't put any garlic in mine but next time I will.  It's very tasty.  Yes, it did take longer to rise than 1 hr.  UPDATE:  I made these with garlic and BOOOOOOY, what a difference.  We cannot stop eating them.  I have to double the recipe next time.  Thank you for a great recipe.

This is truly the best naan i have ever made!  It lives up to all the amazing reviews.  I made it tonight with our favorite mulligatwany recipe and i could not get enough.  it took just over 1.5 hours for the dough to rise the first time.  i was going to add the baking soda as suggested but forgot.  however, i still got plenty of bubbles.  and i halved the recipe for the two of us.  
PERFECT!!!

Wonderful.  So good and chewy. I did cook it on a gas grill on high and it was easier than i thought it would be. skimped out on the last rise(only 10 min) because I was in a hurry to eat.  Still was fabulous.  We enjoyed the Garlic flavor but I would like to try this recipe without it so we could have the leftovers with jam for breakfast.

This stuff is so good it's ridiculous.  I've made it at my co-op and at home several times and they all think I'm some kind of god when I make it.  It scales up very well.  I've had several people tell me it's better than what they get at Indian restaurants.  

I would advise people to not put in the garlic (and I'm a garlic nut)- it doesn't add much to the flavor and if you have extra in the morning, garlic-free naan tastes really wonderful with maple syrup.

Good recipe but, I am looking for a naan bread recipe that contains baking powder and vinegar like the naan bread that i buy from the grocery store. Naan is pricey at the store, 4 naans for $3.99 Cdn. I figured that this can be duplicated at home for far less $.
Happy to see more than one naan recipe on this site.

The bread tasted excellent but it was a little too thick.  This was my first time making bread so maybe I missed a step or two.

Excellent taste, texture.  My family gobbled them up, incl. the kids who are usually very finicky.  I did grill them and brushed them with garlic butter.  To me that almost gave them a garlic bread taste which isn't what I wanted.  Next time I will either add garlic in the dough, or not at all.

This produced wonderful naan, in spite of the fact that I had to make alterations to suit what I had on hand. I used four cups of all-purpose flour instead of bread flour, and used quick-rise yeast instead of the regular (this eliminated the second rise). The naan still puffed up beautifully in the oven. (I baked the naan at 450 degrees for about 4 minutes on each side, per directions.) I also added chopped Italian parsley in with the minced fresh garlic. Thanks for sharing--this is truly a treat my whole family enjoyed. We'll make this one again and again!

mmmm...MUST keep the garlic in (even add more) if you are a garlic fiend like me.  Didn't have milk..I substituted rice milk and it didn't seem to make a big difference.  Cooked these on my electric griddle at 350 degrees F and they turned out great!  Ate half of them before I even made the rest of dinner.  oops.

I used these as a pita for a pita rollup recipe. I think I added too much flour or something, as they ended up being very hard to roll out thinnly. So I cooked them thick! Mixed some Cavender's Greek Seasoning into the melted butter that I brushed on them wile cooking them. I cooked them on medium heat in a frying pan (right side up) and they turned out fine. Just very dense as I mentioned. But these had a great flavor to them, and I actually knida liked how heavy they were. Great recipe in my opinion! Much better than the store-bought Naan I've tried.

Very good flavor.  I cooked it on a griddle but high heat was way too high - medium was better.  The directions do not state this but you need to roll it quite thin in order to achieve the naan-like shape/size I'm familiar with from Indian restaurants.  I'll definitely keep trying this one!

This was very easy to make.  I make tortillas a lot and it wasn't much more difficult.  Mine didn't rise much, but the naans were still fluffy and delicious.  I cooked them on my electric griddle and sprinked salt on them and my kids thought they tasted like soft pretzels and want me to make them with cinnamon instead of garlic next time!  I am glad they liked them since my picky family didn't care for the curry and tandoori chicken that I also made- they filled up on these- will definitely make again.

Wow...these were wonderful..and easy!  I can't wait for my mother in law to come from India so I can make them for her!  
There's around 18in of snow by our grill right now, so I took others suggestions and used our George Foreman grill...they came out great!

Overall very good.  I added the garlic to the melted butter and brushed on the bread.  Everyone loved them, including the kids who asked for them again soon.  They reminded me of Navajo frybread that I served with jelly.  I would recommend making the golf ball sized dough balls a bit larger and then cutting the cooked bread with a pizza wheel into triangles, (Like they do at the Indian restaurant).  Mine didn't get as puffy as the photo.

Delicious!  I made it on the George Forman grill (open) and it turned out perfectly.  I set the grill at med/high and cooked 2 1/2 to 3 minutes per side.  Totally exceeded my expectations!

I have to echo the same opinions expressed by previous reviewers; these are delicious.  I halved the recipe using one small egg and it made fourteen pieces about 5 inches in diameter.  I made these in a grill pan on the stove over medium-high heat.  The only problem was that the butter created a good bit of smoke, so I’ll use ghee next time I cook it indoors as it has a much higher burning point than plain butter.  I can’t speak for authenticity since I haven’t had naan in several years, but this recipe was perfect with the curry I made.

this was really good, I'd say better than most naans I've tasted. I added some garlic in the butter to give it a little more flavor.

This is very similar to naan have had in Japan, but doesn't replicate my FAVORITE naan, so I will continue searching for that ultimate naan. My older brother commented 'this would make really good pizza crust.' And you know what? ... I think he's right.

Not exactly what I thought it would be, but still a really good bread. It felt like it was missing something. Not sure what, but something. I enjoyed grilling the bread, rather than baking it. It was a new thing for me. I served it with a Trader Joe's indian dish with Tzatziki I from this site (yeah, I know... Greek with Indian? The Tzatziki served as a cooling agent with the spicy indian grub).

This was really easy to make and delicious, but I do wish it was flatter so that we could wrap some food into it.  Next time I will try to use bigger pieces that are pretty thin.

I used half bread flour and half whole wheat.  I cooked it in the toaster oven and it came out delicious!  It's a great substitute for pita bread.

The bread is sooooo good and soft. This is just like what you can find in Indian restaurants but without the taste of their special tandoor(clay) oven. Make sure you don't dump all the flour at once. When the dough already become soft, you should stop. I only used 4 cups of flour,using my KitchenAid mixer. I guess it depends on the humidity while you are kneading it. The recipe is surely a keeper!

This is perfect! Instead of melted butter, I used oil to lightly brush the naan before grilling it and it came out great. Thanks for sharing!

I thought it was a good bread, but not really naan. Also, it was a little bit too sweet. I will use less sugar next time. I will also reduce the heat.

This was delicious.  My sister told me about it.  She cooks hers in a skillet, rather than a grill.  I grilled mine and it turned out awesome.  The next morning I wrapped it loosely in foil, heated it in a 350 degree oven for 10 minutes and took it to work.  Everyone loved it for breakfast!

My husband LOVED this bread. I halved the recipe so I could make it in my bread maker using the "dough" setting. We didn't include the garlic.  My husband cooked it on the BBQ grill and it puffed up nicely (we tried it with whole wheat bread flour the first time and it didn't puff up so nicely).  My husband LOVED the combination of this bread served with "Sharon's Scrumptious Souvlaki" (with a few variations to the recipe) from this site.

This was great!  I followed the recipe exactly.  I felt like it probably needed all the sugar to raise properly and I didn't think it was too sweet.  The garlic was really good in it too.  I baked on foil brushed with butter in a 450 degree oven for 4-6min and it turned out wonderful.

Fabulous!  This was easy to make and got rave reviews from both my husband and my 2-year-old.  I made these in our grill pan, as we don't have a bbq grill, and they came out just fine in the grill pan.  I did brush them with the melted butter, but found that they cooked without sticking to my grill pan, so I'll be able to omit the butter and make this recipe  for my in-laws, who are on a low-fat diet.

I halved the sugar and made this on a pizza stone at 400, as recommended previously here. My boyfriend loved the naan, everyone was happy with the results. Will definitely make again.

Very very good flavor. Made a LOT though--I think next time I'll halve the recipe. I used a cast iron grill/griddle pan--grill side up on my stove and it worked great. I also used spray vegetable oil to grease the pan and the backside of the naan before flipping. Even my 2 year old came begging for more!

Excellent recipe. Easy and very delicous, my pakistani friends mother was looking for a long time time for a perfect naan recipe...she thinks this is the best she found ever. Used a pancake griddle to make the bread, otherwise all as in the recipe. Thanks Mic!

I thought this was a delicious and easy recipe.  Rolling out the Naan takes time, but the thinner it is the better it gets.  It's a bit sweet for a dinner bread, so I think maybe next time I make it I will cut down on the sugar in the recipe.

I was able to try a number of suggestions here just from the volume of dough this recipe makes.  Someone had suggested putting a little baking soda on the pan and covering it to make the bread bubble.  While it did bubble, it had a bitter aftertaste, even with just a little baking soda.  I also tried it on the grill and in the frying pan.  On the grill it worked okay, but in the frying pan it worked out the best on medium heat, it even bubbled some and came out very chewy and nice.  I think adding the garlic is a must.  Very nice recipe...my favorite part of Indian cuisine.

I have made this 2X's.  The first time, it was tasty, but not quite right.  Second time, my dough didn't rise and I couldn't grill them so I had to use my cast iron griddle and they came out PERFECT, go figure.  I think the secret is buttering a griddle and not grilling them.  The second time, I also split the dough in half.  Added the garlic to one half and a ground almond/raisin paste that I made to the other.  The almond raisin Naan dissapeared first.  Will be making this often.

These are really great.  I don't think they're exact replicas of the naan I've had at restaurants, but that's about the tandoor and not the recipe, necessarily.  We enjoyed these tonight with gobi masala curry and we'll eat them tomorrow with lamb souvlaki.  Easy to make and very good. Thanks very much, Mic!

The heaviness in this recipe due to the use of bread flour, which has a high gluten content. I used all purpose flour instead and there was no bready taste. This recipe is Naan. However, it makes a lot more than it says. I rolled it as thin as I could then cooked it on a pan that was lightly sprayed with olive oil. Perfect!!!!

Whether this is authentic naan or not, the recipe is fabulous.  Every time I make it for company there are plenty of raves and everyone wants the recipe.  The garlic is soo good.  Use a very hot griddle and be patient with rising the dough, you will be rewarded.

This was disappointing. I grilled the naan on the Foreman grill as one reviewer suggested, and it turned out too much like pita bread. It wasn't flaky at all.

Little bit too sweet as written.  Also, NOTE:  If you wish to cook stovetop (as I did), griddle / fry pan should be warmed as for pancakes (about midway on my gas stovetop control knob).  Only takes about 45-50 seconds per side to cook if thin enough (press bubbles down).  Sadly enough, they do not reheat well, so perhaps this would be good for a party or large dinner gathering.  Thanks for sharing!

This was so so good! I used a little less sugar and I only needed 3 1/2 cups of all purpose flour. It was worth the time. Thanks.

It was very good, but certainly not like real Indian Naan.  It was really good, we all liked it BUT it wasn't naan.  And I'll make it again.

I like to bake bread, so I didn't think the prep time was any big deal. We cooked it on the grill and it turned out great. I was pretty proud until someone commented that it tasted a lot like biscuits. And it did. I think next time I will cut the amount of sugar to get a more bread like than biscuit taste. Don't be afraid of using the grill to cook, it really works.

This took work. This took TIME! It was 114 degrees outside when we grilled the bread....It was worth it ALL! This is great bread. We are going to make a huge batch and freeze it. I put in twice the garlic it calls for.

MMMMMMMMMmmmmm...This is my first time making naan and it was a success.  Did I mention delicious?.  I made it with and without the garlic and they are both good.  My boyfriend loved me for it.  Next week I'm planning on making it for my guests.

My mom and I tried this last night and thought it was great!  I was worried about the whole grilling bread thing but it worked out amazingly well.  I've also had a couple today (ok, I've eaten 4 of them) and they're terrific.  I omitted the garlic so I could try them with marmalade--delish!  Also, I used about half chappati flour and half AP flour.

This was a whole lot of fun to make. I didnt have a package of yeast (I make a lot of breads so I just used a tablespoon of active yeast from my jar) It tasted great and was a wonderful compliment to our meal.

Excellent recipe!!! Soft and slightly sweet bread that was great as a side dish to chicken curry. Like others commented, it stole the show over the main dish! I did not try adding the garlic, preferred the simple taste to contrast with the spicy curry. Also did not add butter when grilling...no need for it in my opinion. I used a frying pan with Pam to grill them for about 2 minutes per side on medium/low head. This worked great. Will make this again! Maybe I'll try the grill when it's not 5 below zero!

An amazing, versatile dish. The best bread I have ever made, and trust me I made a few.....It was easy to make (save that I needed only 4 cups of flower instead of 4 and a half stated in the recipe, for soft, pliable dough that doesn't stick). Maybe it was up to the kind of flour. I will never make Indian again without this naan, though I am aware that it will steel the show every time....Thanks Mic, this is a definite keeper.

I love cooking Indian food, but have never found a recipe that I liked for "tandoori bread."  I was skeptical but this lives up to its claim, it is the best naan bread outside of an Indian restaraunt.  Great find!

Since I first used this recipe, I've tried to make other kinds of breads several times, but by the time the dough has risen, I've resorted to making naan again, because it's so easy and so very tasty.

Use a good outdoor grill, and really get that thing smoking hot. Roll the dough out really thin. the nann will be thin, bubbly, and soft in the middle and crackly at the edges.

Definitely don't use all 4.5 cups of flour the recipe calls for. I used extra garlic, ghee for pan grilling, and sauteed the garlic a little beforehand to help infuse garlic flavor on the outside of the naan as well. Yummy!

I didn't have a yeast packet, so I used 2 1/4 tsp of active dry jarred yeast. And I've learned from other recipes to have warm water around 105-110° to not kill the yeast. I added a dash of the sugar to just the yeast and water, and let it foam for 5-10 minutes. Then I mixed in the ingredients in a stand mixer with the dough hook attachment.  Be careful not to let the salt and yeast come in direct contact. Put it in after some flour.

Winner, winner!!  Followed the recipe but used some garlic powder instead of fresh.  One child ate it with scrambled eggs, another with soup, and we had the rest with our dinner of beef stew. Next time, I will make a double batch so we have enough leftovers for flatbread personal pizzas.

I make this recipe using a pizza stone and oven set to 475 as opposed to a grill, and it turns out great. I bake on each side for 1-2 minutes, and do 3-4 at a time. Thanks so much for sharing this recipe! It's a massive hit with the Lentil Soup with Lemon.

Great recipe! I’ve made it multiple times and every one who tries it immediately loves it. However, I did make a few alterations. For example, the recipe calls for 4 and 1/2 cups of flour, and it tells you to use enough to make a soft dough. For me, this has been about 3 and 1/2 cups every time. I also increased the rising time for the second rise, going from 30 to 45 minutes. Next, the recipe has you use melted butter and a grill to cook the bread. As I have been making this in winter, I don’t have access to a grill so I have been using a cast iron skillet, and it works great. But, if I use butter I think it will burn, so I have been using olive instead and it works just as well. Once again, great recipe.

This came out great! I was so happy to find a recipe for Naan that didn't require me to have Yogurt in the house. This is something I likely will always have the ingredients for - and can "whip up" on a weekend. I grilled them up in my cast iron pan, and delicious!

I liked this Naan because it was easy to make and add garlic to. The taste was okay. The texture was good. The rise was pretty good. I'm not the best at baking bread but possibly the taste could be more rich like Naan.

Added 1/2 tsp baking soda to make it rise further. I like the naan made with yogurt more than the one with yeast.

This was really good! I didn’t get it to bubble much, but I’ll try baking soda next time. I got a few bubbles when I rolled them out very thin.

This recipe is incredible, I use it for both naan and pizza dough. If you don't have a grill baking on a pizza stone or on the stove top works just fine.

Best naan recipe ever. Followed the suggested small changes. Added a tablespoon of sugar to water and yeast for proofing and a less than the 1/4 cup of sugar to the rest of the mix. Used the suggested 3.5 cups of flour and added three cloves of crushed garlic before the second rise. Cooked on medium high heat on my pizza stone and used melted butter. A definite 10!

Great recipe. You can cook these on an electric griddle on 375, easier than a grill.  Also, I cut the dough into portions and then rolled them out with a rolling pin. They quadruple in thickness when they cook, so roll them as thin as you can get them!

Excellent recipe! I made some just as described on my pancake griddle. For the rest, I mixed in some pesto with the butter to brush on while cooking. Both were delicious!

Great recipe.  Super easy.  I use Naan  bread to make pizzas.  My local grocery store quit carry it for some unknown reason, so I made some and it was delicious.  I'll never buy it again.

I made this for the first time, and it came out great! I didn't use much sugar at all, but that's just my preference.I also put the garlic in the butter instead of kneading it in.  I would just say that the thinner you roll them out, the better they are!

I added a small amount of baking soda and it came out perfectly.  I used half the dough for naan and used the remaining dough for a pizza crust.

This recipe worked quite well for me, but was a little sweeter than I like. I will make it again, but reduce the sugar by a third to start, and go from there. I measured the flour and sugar out, and then took a tablespoon of each to prove my yeast so as not to add any additional sugar or flour beyond the recipe. I also found 3 1/2 cups flour (plus flour to kneed) to be sufficient (thanks to other reviewers for this tip!), and rather than kneeding garlic into the dough, I added it to the melted butter that I brushed the grilling naan with, making sure some of the actual garlic ended up on the bread, not just the flavored butter. 

The other thing I did a little differently was I used my instant pot (on the low yogurt setting) as a proving drawer to speed up my first rise, as our house tends to be too cold for a countertop rise. It only needed about 35 minutes to double in size rather than the hour stated in the recipe. Over all, the naan was a big hit, and I will make it again with the only modification being to reduce the sugar a bit.

Made as directed, love it!  I will try the baking soda next time.  I only put garlic into half of  the recipe based on other reviews that did omitted the garlic, but it is great with it and I will put it into the entire recipe the next time.  I cooked on a cast iron griddle on low heat, on high it was burning quickly.  Thanks for the recipe!

I followed the person who added yogurt instead of milk, used 3 and a little bit more cups of King Arthur bread flour-they were Amazing!!!
My husband and son couldn’t eat them fast enough.

Family loved them. Even though you are suppose to use oil/butter to coat them i found out that they still cook up nicely without it so i cooked them on a frying pan ( as i don't have a grill ) without any oil on them and they turned out delicious.

I added bit of Baking Soda like another reviewer said.  Make sure to leave enough time to rise. Also mix in at least a tablespoon of sugar with the initial yeast and water to foam.  If it doesnt foam stop there and likely you should get new yeast.  I would put the garlic into the butter while rising to flavor it and use to brush them at the end.  Much better than mixing butter into the dough.  These were very goodl Made me 20 small naan.  2 - 3 would fit in my cast iron grill.

Delicious on my first try! Tastes just like the naan from our favorite local Indian Restaurant. I recommend making sure you roll the dough thinner than you would think. It expands when it cooks.

By far, the best naan recipe. I've been searching and used many but this one is a keeper. I like that I can just use my stove's grill. If you have ghee, use it instead of butter.

We use this for falafels, hummus, and navajo tacos. We cook them on an electric grill instead of a frying pan, so we don't need to use oil to cook them. Also , I never add as much sugar or salt as the recipe calls for.

Absolutely phenomenal taste! Overall not too difficult to make just a little time consuming, but yields a good amount so you could easily make on a weekend and have for throughout week.

I used whole wheat flour and it turned out great.  You only need about 3 cups during the proofing and another 1/2 cup or so when you're kneading it.  Otherwise, it becomes dense

Absolutey delicious!  I did the first mix using my KitchenAid for 6 minutes.  Started with 3 cups of flour and added 1/2C at a time to end up at 4C total for a slightly tacky dough. Also had to leave the first rise go for 90 minutes to get not quite double size. My family loved them!

this was a game changer! I only used about 3 cups of bread flour and  cooked it on a hot bbq, basted with melted garlic butter, fantastic! I might start baking more...

I made this twice. The first time I used 4 1/2 cups of flour but it was too much. The second time I used 3 1/2 cups, as other reviewers indicated, and it worked great. Our grill died so I cooked the first few in a cast iron skillet and the naan looked liked pancakes. We have a gas stove so I cooked more naan over the open flame and it bubbled just like what you see in the restaurant. I used our pizza screen to hold the naan while it cooked over the open flame.

Best recipient I’ve found so far! My tips would be to start at a low temp, my first batch were a little crispy, and to make sure you keep the dough thin when frying.
Edit: After making a few more batches I would also say use less sugar. Not much, but the amount directed makes it slightly sweeter.

Turned out perfectly! So fluffy and delicious. No need for butter, just oil - but I'm sure the butter would have made it even more tasty!

This is very good Naan. I followed the recipe using Bread Flour. Made it in my bread maker so the first rise was completed there. The dough looked kind of dry to start but came together in the end. It is a dense dough. After making the small balls and the second rise I rolled the dough out quite thin and then cooked on the BBQ which allowed me to do 5-6 at a time. They bubbled up perfectly and everyone loved them. This is a keeper.

Easy and simple! I was so impressed with this recipe I ended up making a second batch, although the first batch made a LOT! I made the bread on an electric griddle and it turned out just fine. I ended up using a brush to oil it down first and it worked like a charm!

I am unfamiliar with Indian food but my son requested lamb curry tonight so to Allrecipes I came.  I made lamb curry and this naan.  He said this was "not flat enough" but tasted like naan should so we declared it to be a success.

I used black pepper and onion powder in place of the garlic (forget to pick some up so improvised). It worked really well but used  a bit too much onion powder...

With that said, if anyone else is interested in using onion powder, try 1/2 tsp onion powder and about 1 tsp pepper. 1:1 is a bit too much... Live and learn.

Also, for anyone using a gas stove, medium-low heat for about 30 seconds was perfect for me. Any higher/longer would have burned.

Almond/cashew milk can be substituted no problem for dairy milk and the sugar can be reduced or omitted completely depending on your tastes. I used 1/8 cup of Stevia and it turned out fine.

Overall, fantastic recipe that allows for plenty of customization for different tastes and dietary requirements. Thanks so much for sharing it, Mic!

This recipe was great. My husband as actually very pleased and we both know I'm not a very good cook/baker. It took a little while longer than anticipated even having read the reviews to make sure to allot time for rising. I followed the receipt but used 3 1/2 cups all purpose flour and let it knead in my Kitchen Aid for 6 minutes however I think I probably should have cut that down to 3-4. The naan ended up being a little tough. I melted the butter and let the garlic sit in the butter as someone else had recommended however it lost some of the potency that way so I think next time I would knead it in. Cook on medium on my gas burning stove with a cast iron skillet. Over all turned out pretty good. I think I would try ghee next time instead of real butter. I had some extra balls so I put them in the freezer. We'll see how those turn out! Thanks for the recipe!

Nice recipe.  I didn't get air bubbles, so it was a little denser that true naan, but that was okay.  Great taste.  I used a cast iron pan to cook it.  It want great with Chicken Curry & jasmine rice!

I really liked it.  Family loves it.  I followed what another reviewer said and instead of adding the garlic to dough, I sauteed it in butter and fried the dough with that brushed on.  I just added a bit too much for my taste.  Also, not sure the 2nd rise worked as well as it should've, due to a mistake of mine.  I'm wanting to try this again and again though.  Nice taste.  Love the quick fry method of making these  (just a min each side)- I can see trying this in various shapes with various cooking methods.

Really Yummy!  I used AP flour because I don't like to keep bread flour on hand but used 3.75 cups.  Next time maybe a little less sugar?  It was yummy though, a bit donut-y!

Spot on naan, just like when I was a little girl!  I don't have a tandoori oven, but the local Indian restaurant owner here has been giving me ideas for building my own.  I know it will taste even better then.  I used my castiron pan for these for now.

I followed the directions to a "t", and it didn't turn out at all.  No matter how long I kneaded, I couldn't get a smooth dough.  I left it to rise for an hour.  Added 1/2 hour because it just wasn't rising.  Went to knock the air out and the dough was like leather.  Based on this experience, I would not recommend this recipe.

Instead of yeast next time I'm just going to use 1/2 tsp of baking powder, I didn't care for the yeasty flavor. I'll also be doubling or tripling the garlic.

I love naan, so I made this to go with some butter chicken. The result was tasty, but chewy, so next time I'll make sure to use the bread flour and see if that helps. Even chewy, I can't stop eating them, but I guess you can never go wrong slathering bread with garlic butter, right?

My kids love this naan more than any other bread I make. It has a bit of a sweetness to it that plays well with spices in traditional Indian dishes. I grilled mine in a cast iron pan on my gas stove and they turned out beautifully. I didn't use any butter because I like it better without. Great recipe to play around with!

I was surprised at how well these turned out, they also freeze really well and taste just as good when cooked a few weeks later.

This is the first time I have made Naan and it turned out great! I did follow some of the suggestions listed in the reviews. I added a tsp of baking soda and used plain yogurt instead of milk. My son-in- law is from India and he loved it!

I will definitely make this again! It was very delicious! I only made minor adjustments which I normally do not do when I review a recipe. One was to add sugar to the yeast. When I mixed the water with just the yeast, it didn't froth or bubble, so I threw it out and started over. The second time I added a pinch of sugar and it worked perfectly so I began the rest of the process. I only added 1/8th of a cup if sugar because I am super sensitive to sweets, and cooked it in a pan on the stove because I do not currently own a grill. Overall, the recipe is great! My family loved it, and I will definitely be making it again!

I made this last night and took suggestion from a reviewer about adding a 1/2 tsp of baking soda to get more bubbles. This worked out and I recommend this. However a note about flour for the Canadian bakers. Canadian flour is heavier so when making this the ratios seemed weird to me, 1 cup plus 3 T of milk did not seem like it would hydrate 4.5 cups of flour. I added in 1/2 cup portions and only ended up needing 3.5 cups.

Amazing flavor! Can’t wait to make again. I did have to reduce the temp slightly, but I also used a cast-iron skillet, since I made these in the winter.

FINALLY got this right! I only used 2 Tbl sugar during the proofing stage. no more than that. Also, high heat is ridiculous, has to be like cooking anything else on a griddle, a little higher than medium. Frying with butter is problematic, it spits a lot. I used oil, but that makes the naan brittle. Next time I'll try butter on a lower heat. But this batch with lower amounts of sugar was for sure the best.

Loved these! I had a hard time getting the dough to rise but still turned out in the end. Also, I did not incorporate the garlic into the dough. Instead, I crushed the garlic and added it to a few tablespoons of melted butter and brushed the mixture on top as I cooked them.  Will make again

Turned out great!  My hubby doesn’t eat white flour so I made them with whole wheat flour.   He LOVED them!  The first time I made them, I grilled them and that was a disaster!  I fried them in a pan this time and they turned out wonderful!

Excellent and best naan recipe I’ve used. Definitely followed the comments about less flour. Instead of rolling them out, I stretched them gently like a pizza dough and lay it on my pan. Low medium was definitely enough. It came out pillowy and great tasting! Keeper for sure! Thank you!

I've been looking for a good naan recipe that tastes similar to what you can get at Indian restaurants, and this one is very close! I left out the sugar because I didn't want it to taste at all sweet, and I cooked them in a frying pan because I don't have a grill, but it turned out great. My whole family loved it. This will definitely become a staple when I make Indian food.

Great recipe! I omitted the garlic because I forgot to put it in, but it was delicious nonetheless! I didn't have a grill, so I just cooked it on a pan on the stove. I ended up turning the heat down to medium since the first one I did didn't seem fully cooked.

Came out great, but be sure to budget a couple of hours to making these!
This made about 30 pieces of naan for me (given the golf ball sizing guideline)
I also only incorporated 4 cups at first and then the rest during the kneading process. Even so, it might have been a bit much, as it didn't quite double in size during the initial rise.

Delicious! I used only 4 cups of bread flour. After an hour I divided the dough into 16 balls and froze 8. I used an open George Foreman grill to bake the naan. Rolled each ball out and brushed both sides with olive oil before baking. It took about 2-3 minutes on each side for the Naan to be done.

Not sure what I did wrong but mine didn't blister up like I expected.  I followed another poster's advice and added baking soda but no bubbles formed.  Flavor was good though.

Very easy to make, tasted great even on my first try. Recommend to start cooking at medium/low instead of high heat to avoid quick burning. Added cheese too, made it taste even better. Be generous on the butter.

I made it exactly as stated, however, I believe there was too much flour as the dough was incredibly hard to knead. Next time, I will use less flour and I will do them on the grill (bbq) and I think they will be perfecto! They were still delicious served with my chicken curry but I know I can do better next time!

Followed this recipe almost exactly. I used 4 cups flour and then just added the rest while I was kneading.  First time making naan and it's so good!  My only change would be to make the dough balls bigger if you plan on using the bread for wraps.

I have been making this for years, and it is perfect and foolproof..i use an indoor grill and brush either butter or flavored oil over them as they come off the grill...but they only need about 1 min with my grill on high...perfect accompaniment to indian food

Followed one reviewers suggestion to add the garlic to the hot butter and let it sit for 10 min rather then knead it into the dough

This recipe is AMAZING. I have little experience cooking bread or Indian cuisine of any kind, and this turned out perfectly. The hot bread melts right in your mouth. A few tips from my experience: 
Add a little sugar to your yeast and warm water right away, this will give you the "frothiness" the instructions talk about and will help the dough rise more during the first proofing......
Mix minced garlic in with your melted butter and let it sit for a minute before you start grilling, this gives great flavor without having big pieces of garlic in the dough.....
A George Foreman grill works just fine if you don't have a grillpan, brush it with olive oil first.

I've been making this regularly  since I first printed it out in 2001. It's probably the best thing I make.
Some advice: "bread' flour is not necessary--regular unbleached white does fine. And yes as one reader points out--do be sure to put a little of the sugar in the warm water when proofing. Don't bother with the garlic. Serve with a little kosher salt.
You can minimize the kneading by adding flour a cup at a time, stirring until each cup is incorporated.
I find it takes about three hours from the minute I start assembling ingredients to when the last naan comes off the grill.

I dissolved the sugar in the warm water before adding the yeast.  I did not knead the garlic into the dough. I brushed on garlic and butter when grilled. I used a George Forman grill. Perfect.

My only suggestion is this:  if you prefer a stronger garlic flavor, omit the minced garlic, and instead add garlic powder directly to the butter before grilling the bread.

Once the griddle as hot I had to turn it to medium to prevent burning. Used Olive oil instead of butter. Open the window or the house will fill with smoke. Yummy naan!

This is da best!! We have made butter chicken for the first time and I was looking for a naan recipe that was going to be also for the first time. We have found this recipe and wanted to give it a try. It is absolutely as delicious as restaurants. I only used 4 cups of bread flour also used 2 1/4 tspn bread machine instant yeast instead of active dry yeast. My hubby and I ate 3 each plain naans before our dinner is ready lol soo good

Turned out great. I was honestly skeptical, but they are really good. I added 1/2 tsp baking soda and covered when cooking as suggested. I cooked mine on a cast iron skillet which held the heat well. Thanks for the recipe! It's a keeper.

Used the optional garlic.  My daughter and wife thought it might be better with additional  garlic powder in the butter. I'll try that next time.  I used my gas grill to cook the naan.  1 burner on high and the other on medium.  Cooked over the medium.  Worked out to 1 1/2 minutes per side cooking time.  Longer generated burned results.

This turned out great!  Followed instructions as written.  My only additions were using ghee instead of butter.  I made half regular Naan and the other half tossed in sugar and cinnamon.  This will be a go-to Naan when having Persian food at our house.

I make this recipe everytime I serve Tikka Masala. We love it, and the leftovers are always eaten within a couple of days! I make my on the griddle so I can make several at one time! I get a lot of bubbles!!

This recipe was fun to make and easy too. Followed the recipe to the tee and the taste and texture were amazing. Can’t believe that I made authentic tasting naan! I also can’t believe that I ate most of the batch over the course of a few days. I think my husband only had two. Served naan with Indian tandoori chicken recipe from this site but tastes great just on its own!!!

Wonderful Naan bread!  I had a dinner at my home and everyone loved the Naan. I had none left at the end of the evening. I did take one persons suggestion in changing it and added the garlic to the butter rather than mixing it into the bread

We’ve searched high and low for a good naan recipe and we were about ready to give up when we found this one.  It’s incredible!  We substitute margarine for the butter, and I’m sure we use more than ¼ cup, because I fry each piece of naan in about a tablespoon of margarine.  It comes out a bit greasy, but it’s sooooo good.  The garlic makes this, so I would not consider it optional unless you are allergic or just hate garlic.

DELICIOUS!  I added the 1/2 tsp baking soda cooked in grill pan on stove top with lid as suggested by other reviewer.  Definitely get that dough INCREDIBLY thin before cooking.  Very, very good.

Absolutely incredible!!! My husband couldn't stop eating it. As with any bread recipe, add flour little by little so as not to make the dough too stiff. I also included a 1/2 tsp of baking soda, thanks to another reviewer's tip, and had no problems getting bubbles to pop up while cooking the Naan. I didn't have a grill so I used a frying pan instead which worked great! And instead of incorporating garlic into the dough, I followed another's recommendation to mix it in with the butter brushed on top while cooking. Mmm.

I paired this Naan with a tasty Indian Chicken Curry. The Naan definitely helped to balance out and tone down the hotness of the curry.  Would definitely recommend!

Dough wasn't rising well but it still turned out amazing.
I added garlic salt and Italian seasonings to the outside with the butter while frying.

I followed others suggestions and used my bread machine w/ 3.5 cups of flour. I didn't need to add any extra ingredients, like other reviews, to get the naan to get bubbly and rise! I did activate my yeast before sticking it in the bread machine. Instead of a grill, I used my oven on broil and put the naan on  my pizza stone and flipped them with a pair of tongs. They turned out great!

I did it exactly as the recipe said and I'm sooo disappointed...
Try medium heat low heat and these came up like thick tortillas or like  Salvadorean pupusas...   Tried thinning them up, buter, no butter..... but nothing came close to...
They did bubble up on one side though,  but nothing compared to what I have had in a restaurante.  
Flavor was great though.

Fluke accident or amazing recipe? I  messed up so many times making this recipe, I was sure it would come out wrong. Even with many mistakes made, it came out AMAZING. DI'd the mistakes actually make it better or is this recipe actually foolproof? I'm gonna try again and find out. FYI here are my mistakes: I forgot to add the egg, and didn't beat it, just kneaded it into the dough as I stated mixing the dry & wet ingredients together, the dough felt like a super dense ball and i did not knead it until smooth. I also didn't leave it to rise more than 45 minutes. I mixed in a little pressed garlic and omg wow, incredibly delicious bread!

I made this recipe today, it was the first time I ever made naan, and it was amazing. I cooked it in a very hot oven on a baking stone and then transferred to the oven rack to brown. It had many big bubbles, was crisp on the outside and tender & elastic on the inside.  It is very important to allow the yeast to bloom with  water and sugar first and to use high gluten content flour for best results. I used King Arthur's bread flour.  This was better than restaurant naan bread. Thanks for posting this recipe. We love it.

This recipe is so easy and yummy as written.  I grill it on my electric crepe pan slightly less than full out (7 out of 8).  They cook quickly and get the char you see at the restaurant.  The only other thing I do slightly differently is to par cook the garlic when I melt the butter.  Putting both in a glass measuring cup and cooking 1 1/2 minutes on high in the microwave takes out the raw garlic taste and flavors the butter too.  Then I remove the garlic - most of it floats - with a  spoon and add it to the dough and knead it in.

I made mine with zero sugar and it turned out good.   But it didn't rise as much as I wanted it to. I also followed @renatob's suggestion of adding baking soda. I don't have a grill so I just used a pan. Next time I want to make it more fully. But I have zero complaints about the recipe itself. :D

I proofed the yeast using a teaspoon of the required quarter cup. Before starting, I preheated the oven to 200 degrees then shut it off before I started mixing the dough then put the dough in the oven to rest then again for the second rising.

this recipe is a keeper!!  have made it 3 times now - recipe makes 12-16 naans depending on size of your rolled dough.  freezes well & pop in toaster to reheat!  made without garlic (husband not a big fan) & sprinkled kosher salt on top as they were grilling ~ try it, you'll like it!

I made this yesterday and it was soooo delicious. My husband and my best friend we're going nuts over it. Very easy recipe to do. I even replace the milk with almond milk and it still came out all right. I refrigerated half of the dough and I'm planning to do the rest tonight.  One thing I will do different next time, is to add the garlic to the butter instead of the dough. I think it that will  help highlight the garlic because done as indicated I hardly taste of the garlic.  Enjoy!

I substituted the milk for plain yogurt, and added baking soda as someone else suggested. I made it in a skillet on the stove top, covering the naan with a lid so the bubbles can form. It was good but not traditional. The second time I made this I did everything the same with one exception....I forgot the egg! It came out perfectly! Fluffy, chewy and buttery like the naans at out fav Indian restaurant! Delicious!!!

Far and away the best naan I've ever eaten - and I think of myself as an Indian restaurant junkie. I made sure to use bread flour, which seems to have made all the difference.  Next time, I will double the amount of garlic and/or add sauteed onions to it.  It was spectacular!  Thank you to the person who first posted this great recipes.

Love love love this receptive! Be sure to follow the instructions on adding the garlic and butter, it took a mediocre bread recipe and knocked it out of the park!! Almost as good as at the Indian restaurant in town.??

Great texture, very chewy. But I wish I followed other reviewers suggestions by adding some baking soda and less sugar. Additionally, yogurt should've been used instead of milk... my Indian mother was shocked I didn't add it! Besides that, it was a great first attempt and I'm quite happy

Tried this for the first time, and did some experimenting with my Weber gas grill.  All turned out great!  First cooked some on the grates. They had nice grill marks and texture.  Then I removed a grate, put a naan pan on the heat distribution panels, much closer to the heat source.  These turned out even better.  Then tried to roll them out thinner, using the grate and the pan.  They were good, but lost the texture of a true naan, so don't roll them too big.

Milk not needed, all it does is prevent the many dairy intolerant people from eating this.
Way too much sugar.  Makes it inedible.

Good recipe (halve the amount of sugar and use it while proofing) but different cooking method.  Divide dough into 2 oz pieces.  During second rise, preheat well-seasoned cast iron skillet in hot oven -- just so it's evenly heated when you move it to the stove top.   Roll out each portion of dough into a disc, place on sheet pan and keep covered with a towel.  They'll continue to rise a bit, which makes a much lighter naan.  Place a dough disc on hot DRY skillet over med-low heat until it puffs up nicely all over.  (It happens pretty quickly!)  Flip and cook until the bubbles just start to char.   If desired, brush cooked naan with garlic butter.  Freezes well.  Makes 16.  Don't skimp on the salt.

No changes to ingredients. But we did cook on a stovetop griddle pan. We turned frequently alternating angels to avoid burned grill marks. YUM!

I love this recipe. I used a pan on my stove and I've found that my regular old frying pan (as opposed to the nonstick ones I have) makes it AMAZING - I get the bubbles and it turns out better than the stuff I get at local restaurants. The nonstick pans make it flat. I don't know why. I also use a coat of butter on the pan before laying it down and it roll it very thin. Then a quick coat of butter when I take it off the pan. So good

SO good. Added more garlic because we love it. Not exactly like naan at a good restaurant, but close enough and MUCH better than anything we've had delivered.

The naan turned out pretty good. I have never made it before. My daughter loves it. 
But I did forget to put in the egg and I cut down on the sugar and salt.

I modified this a bit to my liking, but you can try too:

Cut down sugar by half.
Added 6 table spoons of extra virgin olive oil.
Replace milk with greek yogurt. (less important than the others above)
Grill it on the gas stove. It turned out like a hollow bread when I put in an oven.

Like other reviewers, I made the mix in the bread machine and cut the flour down to 3.5 cups. When I pulled it out, I punched it down and then let it rest for five minutes. Then, I made little balls, wrapped them in plastic, and refrigerated them overnight for a party the next day. Wow! They grew like gremlins in the refrigerator overnight, and when I opened the door they had populated the space. Hilarious side effect! Anyway, the next day, I rolled them out, dredged them in butter infused with fresh chopped garlic, and fried them on high heat until brown on each side. I served them with a vegetarian curry at a party, and they were a hit! I will definitely make this recipe again. (BTW - I also took the advice to make two small balls and mush them into one to create space between layers in the final product, and it worked well.)

OMG!!  This naan was amazing.  put 1 Tablespoon of sugar in the proofing mixture.  I did put in the 1/2 tsp of baking soda. and halved the sugar.  Had made rice but we barely touched it for the naan.  Will be making this over and over,

Great recipe! I did cook it a little differently to make it bubble up..
Let it rise twice, rolled it out and stacked them on top of each other while cooking. I put a piece in a dry, non-stick pain with a lid, cooked it on medium-high heat until the bottom was brown and bubbles were forming on the top. Flipped, covered and cooked for another minute. Brushed with ghee and sprinkled with garlic salt. Serve. 
Deeeelish!

Excellent bread!  It tasted like  the naan I've bought from the grocery store, which is all I can really compare it to.  I used half the amount of sugar, and instead of rolling out the bread, I pressed it out with my fingers. Per another user's suggestion, I added the garlic to the melted butter instead of kneading it into the dough.  I used my electric griddle and somewhere between 300-350F seemed to be the perfect temp.

Used this recipe for 4th year in a row for our Ski Club "The Naan Event". Loved by all. Used more garlic than called for, but everyone liked the garlic. Made 70 slices of naan. Takes a bit longer to rise than indicated, but using bread flour might shorten the time with more gluten. Also used ghee brushed on when cooking.

Turns out that one of our new members works at All Recipes. She was pleased to see where we got the recipe.

We failed a bit at making this. I'm sure the recipe when prepared right is great, but it was kind of hard to follow and since we didn't have a grill, we had to use an oven. Yeah, that didn't go well. The end result was kinda bland, but it tasted nice with garlic butter. We'll probably make it again to try and get it right.

This was amazing. I usually include  my suggestions and adjustments in reviews, but I have nothing to add to this recipe except to not leave out the garlic. It adds a great flavor. I will recommend this to any friends who want a good naan recipe.

I just made this today and it turned out wonderful!! Now i have never baked anything that requires yeast before so i had a lot of trouble at first proofing the yeast until i read the package which said to add sugar, i did use a bit less water and less flour which made the dough somewhat thicker but it still feels light and fluffy. I added some garlic paste to the butter instead of needing it into the dough, i honestly like my naan plain but this way jt was not an overwhelming garlic taste. I don't have a pin so i was spreading out the dough outwards with my hands, the first piece came out really thick though, i hadn't anticipated the dough rising so much while cooking. I started spreading them really think and they came out perfect afterwards.

So good! I brushed garlic on during the frying process and it worked really well. Especially if you push the garlic pieces into the dough with a spoon before placing on the pan. I fried these on a cast iron pan. The first few were a little burnt but the rest were great!

I have never had naan bread before, so I have nothing to compare it to, but it was soooo good.  My family was eating right off the griddle.  It is great for paninis.

Excellent recipe!  This dough is very, very easy to work with and came out perfectly.  We added a whole bunch of fresh cilantro and FRESH garlic.  If you don't have a grill or grill pan, you can also do this in a hot cast iron (or other pan).  It cooks quickly, so do it on high, about 90 seconds on the first side and 60 seconds on the second.

This also freezes beautifully, so after it was completely cooled, we froze in zip locks in packs of two.  But it was so good that the stash didn't last a week!

We are now going to make a double recipe at least monthly and keep a supply in the freezer for wraps and hummus.

Brilliant recipe. Have been looking for a great recipe for naan for a very long time. 

As one of the previous reviewers said, the secret really is in getting it as thin as you can - I found that a combination of rolling out and stretching with my hands until parts of it were papery thin was the best way to get the results I wanted. 

As for the cooking, I preheated my oven to 450F with a pizza stone on the top shelf, and then switched to hi-broil. I was trying to simulate a tandoor oven! It seemed to work pretty well, and I think I've finally found a recipe I can work with! 

I always add onion seeds to my naan; I'm originally from the UK, and this is pretty much the standard - gives a nice savoury flavour - (those are the black specks in the photo I submitted). 

I did find the flavour was slightly lacking - possibly a lack of salt, or maybe that I just wasn't eating it with melted butter infused with garlic, that made it feel like something was missing - probably the latter, hence the 5 stars for amazing texture and results! :)

This is a wonderful recipe! I followed most of the instructions. The only changes I made were that I used 4 cups of bread flour instead of 4.5 cups, and I cooked the bread 2 minutes on each side. I really enjoyed this! I will definitely make it again!

Getting the grill really hot was key to getting the dough to bubble up. The dough itself was pretty plain. I need to try some different flours and spices to get the right flavor. Good easy starting out point.

I made these and even though they yeast didn't froth up (which seems to be a common problem for a lot of people after asking google the question!) the dough did rise, not double in size but they rose more once into individual balls. 
They were easy to flatten out and again although they didn't puff out while cooking they still tasted great. 
I didn't add the garlic to  the dough, I just spread with garlic butter during the cooking on both sides. They were a hit on the night and I will definitely make these again and learn before then how to get the yeast frothing properly!! 
So hopefully they can be even better.

I made it as written but used my Stand Mixer to knead it and it was wonderful. Time consuming but really easy. It makes A LOT! We will be using the leftovers for sandwiches or personal pizza crusts.

Amazing recipe!! It was a huge hit in my house. Bread cake me out bubbly and perfect. I did let it proof a bit longer  than suggested and cooked in on a cast iron skillet. Not sure if either played a big role in making the bread more authentic but this has become a staple in our house either way :)

I have made this recipe many times and it always turns out perfectly.  I usually throw everything in my bread maker on the dough cycle and let it rise there.  A quick roll with a rolling pin and in a nonstick pan to quickly cook.  Super easy and yummy.

Made a half recipe of this and it turned out well! I made some modifications - followed the yeast proofing instructions on the packet, used water in place of milk, omitted the garlic, set riding dough in front of heater, cooked in a sautée pan - and the final product still turned out great. I also decided to use the remaining half of egg to brush the naan before putting it on the stove; gave it a nice brown and shine. The only things I'd do differently: I'd try brushing with garlic and butter, and keep more flour handy (as the dough was a little stickier than expected). Yum!

This recipe is amazing! I added 2 Tsp. Baking soda to the mixture, as another person suggested, and 4 cups of flour is plenty, so I wouldn't suggest more than that. Also, I put minced garlic in with the butter, instead of kneading it in. It's much easier. Everyone LOVED them. They are so good even by themselves. I even left the dough to rise 6 hours so I could get some sleep, then split them into balls in the morning and cooked them. It worked just the same!

I changed it a little bit.  I used half spelt, half wheat, both organic flours.  I did not turn them, neither put butter in both sides, only one side.  They came out fantastic!!!  Everyone loved them! Thanks a lot!!

Great naan!   My sons thought we ought to turn the dough into donuts.  So I made them a little thicker and grilled them.  Once I flip them I put butter on and then cinnamon and sugar.  So now I have a recipe for grilled donuts as well as great naan!

I made this for the first time yesterday, and my family loved it. However, I did make some changes. I substituted the bread flour with gluten free bread flour, and only used about half as much, because the flour made it thicker. My only complaint is it had a slight aftertaste of yeast. Otherwise, great recipe.

This was pretty great naan! And so easy! I added some garlic powder to the dough instead of minced garlic to avoid chunks and it worked, added a lovely hint of garlic. Next time I'll add baking soda as per suggestions, to get it more bubbly. Shame it takes quite long to make, otherwise I'd do it more often!

I am gluten free and I love this recipe. I use about a cup less flour (gf doughs are normally quite a bit stickier than the norm) and only let it rise once.  Super yummy bread that few people even know if gf!

Easy and delicious.  I used a cast iron grill pan resulting in an incredibly smokey kitchen -- and that was with all the windows open! .  Also, on the first few I took the thin rolling recommendations too much to heart.  Made for some pretty crispy breads.  Much better when I rolled them out fairly thin.  Will probably make again if I can figure out how not to smoke out the house :-)

I made this to go with my chicken curry. It did not rise, which was not the fault of the recipe, but I wasn't sure why it didn't. Probably the yeast was dysfunctional??  I cooked it anyway and it was fine, though not puffy. We enjoyed it nonetheless.

I really enjoyed this naan recipe. It's the most authentic tasting that I've found. The only substitution I made was to use the same quantity of plain Greek yogurt instead of milk and the flavor was perfect.

Great recipe!  My husband says this is as close to the naan he had when living in Pakistan as he's ever had in the US.  I use the dough cycle on my bread machine.  I make it on our George Foreman grill, lid open as someone else suggested.  Dough keeps in the fridge well for a few days and freezes well too.  Tip: try with ghee instead of plain melted butter!

So...mixed bag here. To me, this recipe isn't your traditional naan. It tasted more like Italian bread sticks. So if that's what you're wanting, by all means, cook away! They're great for that. 

But for naan, they tasted too yeast-y. Also, if you're going to make these as naan, make sure you get them REALLY thin before you put them on the grill. Probably wouldn't make again as naan...but not bad if you're looking for a pizza crust or bread sticks.

First let me say I have never had Naan before I made it. I'm only rating it a 4 because it seemed a little tough. I'm not sure if it is supposed to be or if I did something wrong. Even with that, we have enjoyed it.

Great tasting recipe! Only change I made was to add 1 tsp of the sugar to yeast and water to help activate. Left over naan bread is great brushed with garlic butter and heated under broiler! Yum!

My dough was so thick! I added another 3T of water before letting it rise to help. I still found it too thick when I tried to roll it out. Next time I will slowly add the flour to get it to a better consistency. Also I did not add the garlic but didn't miss it at all!

Great recipe!  Unfortunately I forgot the garlic, so it was a bit on the bland side.  I'm looking forward to making it again!  My 4 year old granddaughter tore off the dough and flattened it out while I put the it on the BBQ grill. The next time we BBQ'd she informed me that we should have made the bread again!  We will for sure.  Thanks for the recipe.

I really liked this recipe. Doesn't quite taste like it does in restaurants but that will come with practice. A few things I noticed were keeping the temperature on high was too much and burned my first one, I kept mine on medium and they turned out fine. Also make sure to stretch the dough very thin before grilling them, they puff up a lot. Other than that they go great with butter chicken and can be eaten alone!

What a great recipe. I rushed it (skipped rising times, and only cooked 1 minute per side in an iron skillet on the range), and it still tasted great.

I used half whole wheat flour, half bread flour. Subbed Greek yogurt for the milk. Cut in half and it was plenty for my family of 4. I used two cloves of garlic but next time will add more, and maybe a T. Olive oil as mine turned out a little dry (maybe in part from the whole wheat). Also I think I rolled mine out a little too thin. Would prefer a little more doughiness on the inside. Not bad for my first time though!

Used 2T sugar, 3 2/3 cups flour and added 1/2 tsp baking soda as recommended by other reader. Substituted homemade kefir for milk.Cooked in outdoor grill but would lower temp to 375-400F next time. Lots great bubbles and taste was amazing. Will add more garlic next time.

This was excellent!   Used all purpose flour in place of bread flour because that is what I could find.  Also used about 3 1/2 cups of flour - just enough to make dough pull away from bowl.  High grill temperature worked best.  Very yum!

Without a doubt the best flatbread recipe I have ever tried.  Unfortunately I tried to make it with the 4 1/2 cups of flour but that is a little too much.  It takes closer to 4 cups of flour and keep the other half for rolling out your bread in.

I don't know if this is what naan is supposed to taste like, but this was delicious. I used a cast iron skillet because I didn't want to use the grill. Instead of adding garlic to the bread, I added a little garlic powder to the butter.  It was so good!

Awesome recipe, the best flavour of any Naan breads. The salt is necessary for the correct flavour but I only add half the sugar, which I add to the yeast as well. I allow my dough to rise in the oven which had been on low for a few minutes then turned off prior to popping the dough in. I find this speeds up the rising time.I make sure my cast iron grill is brushed with butter prior to each one being made If you are as big a Naan bread fan as my family is, the best TIP of all to get those fabulous bubbles is to roll the dough out very thin, very thin about 1/16" thin. It will puff up when cooked to the perfect thickness. Try it you will be surprised!! Any thicker and you won't get the bubbles. It will cook quickly this thin so watch carefully.

I was concerned about the seemingly large amount of sugar, but it came out tasting great. The dough was incredibly easy to work with.

These came out really good, I think next time I'll use a little less sugar and they will be great. I made them on a panini press (open) and they were so good everyone was eating them as fast as I could make them.

I usually make bread to please my husband's tastes, which is a couple of times a week. This time I chose something I wanted and now he asks for it. This bread is easy, and delicious. It goes with all types of foods and main dishes. It stores nicely in a zip lock bag, and reheats well too. It can be seasoned not only with the cilantro leaves but sprinkled with just about any desires spice blend you love. This is my new substitute for the standard homemade tortillas I've made for years. The extra time for a yeast based dough is worth it.

I sautéed the garlic with a little onion, and it turned out so tasty! The first few were a little chewy because I made them too thick, but the last few were very thin and a little crispy, perfect! I also halved the sugar, it seemed like a little much. I can't say I'm a naan expert, but this recipe was very close to what my favorite restaurant does with theirs, I will absolutely be making this one again.

This was so easy to make & my family went CRAZY for it! I did make a few changes to the directions. I let my Kitchen Aid mixed knead it for me, I kneaded for about 6 minutes on low. I then followed all the directions as stated. I made a pizza from the uncooked dough & it was incredible!! This is my new go to flatbread from now on. I am thinking of all the things I can make with it. I do know it freezes good, because when I have bought it in the store sometimes its still slightly frozen. I made 2 batches of dough so, I'm going to do layers of parchment between the layers and freeze some of them.

Great recipe! I didn't bother letting the dough rise much, being short on time. My bread still bubbled up nicely. To keep the air in, I did not roll them... I tossed them like pizza dough.  I undercooked them slightly to ensure that they were moist, and I did add the extra 1/2 tsp. baking soda that another reviewer suggested, just in case. I went a little light on the flour to keep them tender. I also raised them in a 100 degree oven. I added the garlic, but its taste was extremely subtle. I wouldn't have guessed it was there, but it added that little bite that it needed. I don't have a grill.. made them in the frying pan with a tiny bit of canola oil. I think the grill would have dried them. After cooking wrapped them together for warmth and moisture. The result was light, tender, moist, full of flavor, melted in our mouths.. Family argued over the last piece!!

I followed the recipe to the t, but the naan came out tasting like a pretzel, with the texture of a pretzel. Not naan. I don't know...

I used wildflower honey instead of white sugar. I also cooked it on some type of grill pan I had in the house. I also added additional garlic to the butter at the end. What I came up with didn't really taste like what I usually think of as naan, but it was a delicious and sweet, garlicky flat bread that was great even on its own.

This is nothing like the store bought naan. This is perfectly delicious and is like the coarse grain bread served at a Mongolian BBQ we went to. I'm sure this will be a big hit with the family.

Fantastic, fantastic, fantastic! I've made it repeatedly since finding the recipe years ago. My only tip is don't do the flour by exact measure do it by dough consistency. I add the final cup of flour a bit at a time and stop once the dough pulls clean away from the sides ( I use a kitchenaide stand mixer with dough hook). I freeze the dough and use I for all types of recipes, pizza, pigs in a blanket, even pretzels. Awesome stuff. My family begs for flat bread or pigs in a blanket for every holiday! Make it, you'll love it!

We love this recipe! Every time we end up with beautiful, fresh, and delicious naan! We have stored the little golf balls in the fridge for a few days and they are still great. The bubbles you get are from rolling the dough very thin before cooking.

This bread is amazing!  The secret is to proof the yeast first with a little sugar added to the yeast and warm water mixture. I cook them using our large George Forman Grill - works great every time!

I have made this naan more times that I can count. I love taking it camping (great egg sandwiches) and backpacking. It doesn't break down and in the woods it taste so amazing with just a simple meat on it.

Delicious!  Made it without garlic and it was great with butter chicken.  It was much closer to the naan I've had at Indian restaurants than the kind you can get in local grocery stores (those are much drier and heavily floured, these were glossy and super soft).  Might be sweeter than restaurant style, but my family liked it that way.  It provided a good balance to the spicy dinner.  I imagine it wouldn't be hard to reduce the sweetness if others don't like it.

I didn't stretch out each dough pieces enough so they came out a little too thick. But no matter, they taste like yummy pretzel snacks.

My family loved eating this Naan dipped in Cucumber Raita from food.com (I couldn't find a dipping sauce in allrecipes). I didn't make any changes but cooked with a George Foreman grill, turned out great.

I followed some previous advice and used 3 cups of flour and then 1/2 a cup to knead it. I added a dash of baking soda. I got good results although I cooked it in an iron skillet rather than over an open fire. The hardest part was getting the thickness correct. I learned that I really had to roll it pretty thin to get the thickness I desired. The addition of the baking soda made it nice and bubbly.  Next time I'll go to the trouble of lighting the grill. It will be worth it.

Naan is one of our favorite things, and I'm always on the lookout for easy ways to make it. This is NOT the easiest way, but so far, it's the best. I followed the advice of several other reviewers and used about a cup less flour, and 6 T plain Greek yogurt in place of the milk. I skipped the garlic entirely, and used butter in the grilling pan-a cast iron skillet-instead of brushing it on. This version didn't "poof" as much as as some others I've tried, but it had a lovely, soft texture and a really good flavor; some have said that it's too sweet, but mine wasn't sweet at all, maybe because I didn't use any extra sugar to proof the yeast.

I've made this recipe twice now and each time it has turned out Really well! Everyone that has had it likes it a lot. I did a few things different than the recipe though, like added a bit of sugar to the yeast water and I also added more minced garlic to the dough than suggested. So good! I'm getting hungry just thinking about it!

It was a very good flat bread but it didn't really tasted like naan. I guess we really need a tandoori oven for making that possible, otherwise it is just normal white bread flattened, although delicious.

Use the grill!

Super easy to make.  I use my panini press, opened flat, to grill the bread and it is great.  I love how light and fluffy these are.  I doubled the recipe and use far less sugar.  But we like our bread.

Very good recipe. We enjoyed it. I added my garlic at the first stage because I wasn't paying attention. It still turned out great. Lots of reviews say you don't need all the flour, but I used it all. My dough would have been way too wet without it. I wonder if temperature and altitude affect this? It's a very warm day in a very warm house here. We grilled them. I rolled some too thick, probably, but they were all fluffy and fully cooked. We served with salad. I will make it again, but add more spices to the dough.

Great authentic taste! I didn't see the notes about using less flour until I started and noticed the dough was really dry. I added more water (about 1/3 c), and it was fine. This was my first time making naan, and although I made the dough by hand, I WILL USE MY MIXER next time to make the dough. Using a mixer to make the dough will take a lot of the work out of it. Other than that, it was pretty simple. I don't have a grill, so I did mine on the stove top in a non-stick skillet on medium-high heat. I didn't use any kind of cooking spray. I just plopped the rolled out dough into the hot pan. I noticed the thinner I rolled it, the more it puffed up. If you like your naan to "pocket", make it thinner. If you like it more "flatbread like", roll it thicker. I didn't have any ghee, so I used melted butter. It worked well, but the ghee will work better for next time. It was a fun, tasty project, and I will make it again!

Time consuming but the kids love to help make it.  I add way more garlic and sugar to give it more flavor.  The kids like it in their lunches the next day too.

Well all be ... an amazing easy recipe. I mixed ingredients by hand and then through it in the bread maker on dough setting.  After the second proof and thinly rolling out I sprayed those puppies with pam and on the BBQ they went. I had my garlic butter and brush and brushed each side ... wow 5 stars for sure I was already asked for the recipe ! Thank you so much

This recipe is great - I tried it without the yeast, with cake flour and added a little baking powder. Used these as a side dish to lentil curry and it was absolutely delicious and super easy to make!

Mine didn't need all of the flour it called for - I used maybe 3.5 c - but these were delicious. I cooked mine up in a grill pan on the stove and transferred them to a low oven to keep warm while I made the next batches. I'll keep this recipe on hand.

Tried this today and I was very pleased. Easy, soft, flavourful naan for a fraction of the price of store-bought. I definitely recommend this recipe for anyone who's a fan of Indian food. Also, add the garlic! It's so worth it.

Great recipe. Here is how I cooked it:
1. Heat iron skillet to max. Make sure you have a lid ready.
2. Lightly oil the pan.
3. Roll out your dough
4. Dip your hands in a container of water
5. Flip the rolled out dough from hand to had to wet it
6. Place the wetted dough in pan, cover with lid, and cook for about 60 seconds - no butter.
7. Flip the bread when you see it getting puffy. 
8. Cook for about 30 to 60 seconds more.
9. Remove from pan and apply butter as needed (optional).
If the bread burns before 60 seconds reduce heat. If it doesn't brown within 60 seconds increase heat. Using this method will produce COMPLETELY different results.

Delicious! Made in bread machine and reduced flour to 4 c.  Used garlic but will  omit next time.  Used a baking stone in my oven at 550 degrees and baked for 1 minute for side. So worth the time and effort!Thanks for shareing!!!

Using tips from others, I added a teaspoon of sugar to the yeast and water.   I used about 2/3 of the sugar. I also cooked the naan on the outdoor grill on a pizza stone. My family loved it. Served it with a Red curry Thai dish that I love.  2nd time I made this I used the recipe for pizza dough. The best was with parsley pesto, sun dried tomatoes, goat cheese, arugula salad, and a bit of mozzarella to top it off. Also made this on the grill.

Just made it as written, with the exception of cooking it in a pan instead of the grill. Looks and smells amazing!

I used 1/2 the sugar, folded some cooled  sautéed  red onion and crushed garlic into the dough, and seasoned then with salt and garlic while grilling. They cooked faster than stated, but I made them pretty thin.

This was really good. I did the dough in the bread machine. I proofed the yeast first and mixed everything together except the flour, put it in the machine, and then put the flour in the machine. The dough dries out quickly though so take it out of the machine promptly. Roll out the pieces super, super thin. Then I cooked them on the george forman brushing them with garlic butter. Don't cook them too long because you want the bread soft not crunchy.

This was so easy and taste great. I used my mixer to kneed the dough.It will keep well, but definitely better hot off the grill, which I used inside on my cooktop grill.

The first time I tried this recipe it didn't rise but it still tasted so good that I decided to try again. It turned out that I didn't let the yeast proof for long enough. The second time they came out great.

This is delicious!  I used garlic powder in the dough and some fresh garlic in the butter for basting.  We all couldn't get enough of it.  I didn't have time for the second rise, but it was still great.  This is a great tool for summer grilling!

These were interesting - I've never had Naan bread before so I've really nothing to base it off of.  Mine turned out like a cross between pita bread and flour tortillas (grin) - but they were too thin to split like pita and too thick to fold around food and eat comfortably - so we just ripped and tore our way through them.  In any event, they were a great change of pace and I'll definitely make again.

This is my first time making naan. My boyfriend who is a cook is the one who always makes it. I looked up this recipe and told him " I am making the naan not you! Don't touch it at all!" Lol. Well he let me do it all and it came out fantastic! I am so happy right now!!!

I just made this and it's fabulous. I made exactly per the directions.  There was a bit of a learning curve on grilling them. I smoked my house out when I cooked them on my griddle on high heat, so I ended up cooking them on medium. I also brushed them with butter after they were cooked to cut down on the smoke. Other than that, they got two thumbs up from my whole family!

Amazing!  We usually just by naan at the store but this was way better and you get more bang for you buck!  It does take some extra time, but so worth it! I followed the recipe word for word and had no issues. It was helpful to have one person roll the dough and another person do the grilling. We will be making our own naan from now on. Thank you!

This is a fantastic naan recipe!  I use an oven stone rather than a grill and it turns out fantastic every time! Thanks for sharing!

These were easy and very good. But, I thought they turned out a little greasy. Not sure if it was from the melted butter or the spray. I used. I tried different seasonings and we liked the paprika/ cayenne the best. I will make them again.

I made this dough in my bread machine, then cooked it on my grill. The bread is good but a little sweet for my taste, I will cut the sugar back the next time I make it.

This naan was hard to make and eat. The dough wouldn't roll out. It hardened soon after I made it and it was so hard it was inedible.

I have a question about this bread. Can a dough hook on a mixer be used on this bread. I have arthritis and have issues with mixing things by hand.

recipe is great as it stands....to get the bubbles, dont use a grill instead use a large cast iron skillet. oil generously with olive oil or grape seed oil. once you have rolled out a few, let them reast for 3-5mins then place them on the hot skillet, use tongs to flip. bubbles should appear quickly.

We made this recipe via the grill method and served with a Cobb Salad.  It was a perfect accompaniment.  We didn't cook all of the dough so day 2 I tried heating the oven to 500 degrees with a pizza stone on the bottom rack for 30 mins.  Cooking the dough this way developed more of a pita pocket for egg salad.  Both methods were tasty.  I will definitely make again.

Absolutely AMAZING!!!  I made 20 pieces of bread and had to beg my family to leave me 2 pieces...even my 1 year old was chowing down on it! I'm making another batch today with cinnamon/sugar instead of garlic.

Great! I let the yeast go for about 2-3 hours and it helped really sink in the garlic flavor.  Super easy as a side dish.

Great naan!!! I make it slightly different by not adding garlic into dough, but making a garlic butter and brushing it on right after they come off the grill and before it goes on also. Thanks for the great recipe!!

This was fabulous and incredibly easy. We don't have any Indian restaurants in my area, but when the International Festival comes, I always like to get the Naan from the vendors. This time when they came, my whole family agreed that this recipe tastes better than the one at the fair!

This turned out perfect on the grill and looked so nice but it was way too much for just two of us.  I kept the remaining dough in the fridge for several days (actually, I forgot about it), covered with Seran Wrap.  I then baked it as a loaf in the oven at 350.  I was sorry that I didn't check the time, I'm thinking about a half hour.  Just check when it sounds "hollow" when you tap on the center.

Made these with my husband and he enjoyed them so much, said they were so soft. I didn't use but 3.5 cups of flour though and I opted to work garlic paste into them. Used my panini grill. Will make again.

Wonderful and versatile!  We've eaten it plain or with hummus; we've used it as pizza crust and sandwiches!  I like to add minced, fresh rosemary to the dough but you could add just about anything to amp up the flavor.  Delicious.

So good and so easy to make.  I didn't want to go out in the cold so I sprayed a frying pan with a little oil and cooked them on the stovetop.  The flavor and texture were both restaurant quality, my daughter already asked me to make another batch tomorrow!

Really simple that even my 9 year had no problems making it.  You may have to let it rise for more than an hour.  I added garlic powder instead of garlic and it was delish-garlic flavor in every bite

I have been making this for a while and always loved it, but had a happy accident to share. I got distracted and mixed in minced garlic in step one. The recipe still worked and the garlic flavor really stood out.

It was very good EXCEPT the barbecuing...I guess my barbecue is hotter than average because 1/3 of my breads burned or were really crusty.  I did turn it down to low half way through the batch and the others turned out better, but they were still rather tough.  I think I will make again and try them in the oven or on a pan stovetop.

Roast your Garlic!!!

Great recipe. I like it and made a couple of tweaks to it.

I used 3 tablespoons of sour cream instead of the milk, which gave it a slightly tart note. 

And roasted a head of garlic as I was making the dough. The roasted garlic is really nice and simply takes away the sharpness of the garlic. Chopped it up and kneaded it in easily because of its soft texture.

This will be great for dinner tonight!

Love this recipe!  Very easy to make and tastes great.  I found that I didn't need the full 4 1/2 cups of flour, so be sure not to add it all at once.  Grilled the dough perfectly on an indoor electric grill.  The family loved it!  Definitely making again :)

I made this and while time consuming, it tastes delicious!  I followed the recipe pretty closely, however I only had 2 cups of bread flour, so I substituted all purpose for the other 2.5 cups.  I also took other's advice and added a tsp of baking soda to see if it would help with the bubbles.  It may have, but it didn't bubble much at all.  I did cook this in a non-stick skillet on my stove...perhaps next time I'll try the George Foreman grill.  Definitely tasty with raita or tzatziki!  (Oh and I used my bread machine to make the dough and let it rise the second time by the fireplace.

Mine didn't rise properly so it was a bit dense.  It was most likely caused by dead yeast though...

Kind of a pain to make, but worth it. These were very good. However this makes a large batch, more than we wanted to eat for one meal, and they aren't so great reheated.

I had been hunting for a good flat bread recipe when I stumbled across this one. I will admit to never having had Indian food before so I have nothing to base this by but this, my picky 4 yr old son and pickier husband ate them as fast as I could make them!

This bread was amazing! I made it just as directed, and folded in about a tablespoon of dried minced garlic, and it was just excellent. I paired this with Spiced Coconut Lentil Soup, and my two year old, four year old, AND my husband all loved it. I will definitely be making this again.

I love this and it is one bread that is so much cheaper for me to make than to buy.

We love to add minced garlic to this. 

Additional uses for this bread include mini pizzas and garlic bread.

This made great naan!  I used my breadmaker for the dough...putting warm water & yeast in the bottom, then the sugar, milk, egg, flour & salt on top.  I had no trouble getting the nice little bubbles..but found I got more when I pressed them by hand rather than using a rolling pin...you do have to make sure to press them pretty thin.  I fried in coconut oil instead of butter...mmmmm.... My family loves it with the butter chicken recipe on here, too!

A delicious recipe.  The dough was smooth and lovely to work with.  I cooked them over a medium heat in a cast iron pan.  Next time I will follow another reviewers suggestion to mix the garlic into the melted butter for a more uniform garlic flavor, but other than that I wouldn't change a thing.  We wrapped Shish Tawook (made from this recipe:  http://allrecipes.com/recipe/shish-tawook-grilled-chicken/detail.aspx?event8=1&prop24=SR_Title&e11=shish+kabob&e8=Quick+Search&event10=1&e7=Home+Page ) in this bread and devoured it.  I can't wait to try this on the grill.

Good recipe, but with a few adjustments it could be even better. First, when you dissolve the yeast, add the sugar in at the same time. It gives the yeast something to "eat", and tends to give it a bit of a boost.Also, if you want to go a little more classic Indian, use ghee(clarified butter)in place of regular butter. Ghee is simply butter without the milk solids. To make it, melt the butter down on low heat(without stirring), and then scrape the white milk solids off the top.

OMG my wife is Japanese and she wanted me to suprise her with something delicious. This blew her taste buds and she wouldn't  shut up saying how much better this nan tasted than in the actual restaurants!
THIS is 20 stars for me!! 
Garlic paste works just as well, Instead of mixing it into the dough, i just spread it on the uncooked side of the nan, then flip it over to cook. 
Butter is optional, as it already tastes great without it. Tonight I will try adding cheese. 
Thank you for a 20 star easy recipe! I just made the dough now, daaaang this should be renamed as 
the Naan from heaven.

The recipe was good, but I was a bit disappointed to learn that the prep time actually took an hour and 30 minutes instead of the posted 30 minutes.  I couldn't eat with my curried lentil soup because of the time difference (it was ready an hour after we ate) so if you're like me and plan your meals by the amount of prep time remember you need an extra hour.

This recipe is a hit! I always have requests to make this naan recipe! It's even better on a grill that is NOT scraped clean. The flavors from the previous meat cooked on the grill adds to the taste of the naan

I also recommend doing this recipe in a bread machine on the dough setting. This recipe is also great as a pizza crust! I even let my bread machine continue the bread cycle, and it made a delicious loaf of bread! 

This is an outstanding recipe!!!

Husband says, "More than adequate, but not great." A bit too sweet for our liking. I would definitely lessen the sugar to about 1/8 a cup. Grilling the bread is a nice touch, however! I would grill it until slightly crispy around the edges, it's very soft (which some people may like), but we prefer it a bit stronger to hold Indian food scooped up in it.

My family loves this recipe! I use whole wheat for half my flour and add whey from plain yogurt rather than milk, then cook on my stove on a nonstick grill pan. There's only three of us so I under-cook most of them so they're just slightly browned, cool on a rack and freeze them in zipper bags. They reheat easily on a grill pan or lg skillet.

Some had bubbles and some did not.  We still enjoyed the bread.  Next time I'll let it rise more.

Perfect! I also used it for a pizza base and my hubby said it was the best pizza he's ever had.

I substituted the bread flour with White Wings Plain Gluten Free flour and it turned out great!  I've been missing my Naan - this one is definitely going to turn into a favorite!

I've use this naan recipe many times and the bread always disappears quickly.  Even our Indian friend gave it compliments.  I may have to start doing double batches just to keep up with demand.   This bread is great with meats such as kafta and kabobs or dips like hummus and tzatziki.

Great recipe. I was worried cooking it on the grill wouldn't cook it all the way through, but it certainly did. Extra kneading made up for using AP flour instead of bread, and keeping it in a very warm place for activating the yeast and during the rising made for a very unique puff on the grill.

This is a fantastic recipe. I halved the recipe, cooked them on a small electric grill and even froze the left overs. They were just a good warmed as they were fresh. Makes awesome Gyros also. Thank you for this wonderful recipe.

Very good. A little time consuming but not difficult. I used a lightly oiled cast iron skillet rather than a grill and it worked great. Very tasty.

So, I will be honestly, this was the first time I have ever used yeast in anything.  I was a bit intimidated but my craving of naan and being too pregnant to drive the 2-3 hours it would take me to get it kind of made me do it.  Well, it worked wonderfully, I didn't have a grill pan and was too chicken to brave the scary outdoor grill with bread so I decided to through it in hot skillet as directed instead of the grill pan.  It worked well and we ate it all!  Plus I didn't have to drive to satisfy my craving!  And I got over my fear of yeast too!  Soft, warm, melting in your mouth this was amazing naan!

I think this was good.  I too did not get the bubbles even though I did add the baking soda as suggested by others,  I also tried splitting my final dough in half and kneading in my seperate hands before pating together.  I will make some changes with my next batch as I thought it was very dry and too sweet.  Otherwise a great recipe.

While the naan tasted really good, this recipe didn't give me the bubbles I was looking for. I might tweak it a bit in the future.

Made this last night, best Naan recipe I've come across yet! It was soft and not dry and chewy like a lot of recipes come out. I dissolved the yeast in the warm water and a tablespoon of sugar, then chucked it all in the breadmaker on dough cycle for 1.5 hours. Worked great! I kneaded in some garlic, and the brushed BOTH sides with butter and heaps more garlic (we looove garlic). Also, roll out the balls of dough as THIN as you can. Great recipe, thanks for sharing it!

This did not work well for me at all. The finished product wasn't naan. The flavor and texture were both slightly wrong for it to be naan. It was a very humid day, though, so I will chalk it up to that. I will try one more time when it isn't so humid.

I didn't have a grill per se. BUT I did have a George Foreman grill. I used that to grill the naan. I generously buttered both sides of the grill and put the lid down on the naan and left it for about 2 to 2:25 minutes. They came out perfect and will definitely do this recipe again.

Good. Makes lots but good for later too.  When its time to cook extra person comes in handy.  They cook fast and you need someone flattening next one.

Great recipe. It didn't quite taste authentic, to remedy this I substituted plain yogurt in place of the milk, and added 1 tbsp. Also you have to roll this out super super thin and you'll get those nice bubbly spots, and I have used a preheated cookie sheet that I heated to 450, and I've also cooked them in an iron skillet on the stovetop (not fried).

I was quite impressed when I made these - they were lighter inside than they looked. I forgot to add the baking soda, but I will next time and see how they improve.  
I used 3 1/2 cups of flour and it was more than enough for 4.  I also used the dough cycle on the bread maker for the first rising.  
Good recipe!

Great recipe!!! I made them without garlic. It makes alot of bread so i made half of them sweet by adding a sprinkle of cinn and sugar to them when i rolled them out and after cooking. There were a few people who say it crumbled. It seems that way at first but keep kneading, it will smooth out and come together nicely.

This was absolutely delicious.  We will make this again.  We are all sensitive to garlic so left that out, and we also cooked it on a griddle as opposed to a grill.  New family favorite.  Thanks!!

The dough just went from crumbly to too hard to knead. If i ever do make this again I'll use a lot less flour for the same amount of liquid.

Ive made this twice already and it has come out perfect. I didn't have bread flour so I used regular flour with buttermilk instead of regular milk. Thanks for posting this!

Mixed it in the bread maker and added garlic at the end.  I did substitute honey for the sugar but I have a ready supply.  No need to look elsewhere this is the Naan you will be happy with.

I only needed 3 cups of flour to make a good bread dough. Other than that I followed the recipe.
My family loved them. I look forward to making naan regularly.

I never thought I could make naan at home, it was so easy! I took others' advice and rolled the dough very thin before frying and the texture was perfect! I, too, found that the dough rose very slowly but it didn't impact the texture as it puffed right up while grilling.

Success!  I have tried naan before without joy.  This was great!  Not only that, but I'm in the Colorado mountains 7000' and I didn't change a thing except rising times, temp & number of risings.  This is one for the repertoire.  Thanks so much!

This was really good! I made it with chicken papadoris from this site (a coconut curry recipe). I followed other's advice and made it very thin which made it too crispy when it cooled off.  I treated it sort of like pizza dough when I cooked it. I put a griddle in the bottom of a very hot oven and cooked it on that instead of the grill.  It made 16 good sized pieces. We were very pleased and I will definitely make this again!

This recipe, instead of making a soft dough, makes an incredibly firm dough. For a soft dough with an enriched dough recipe like this one, start with about a cup and a half of water.

my first attempt because the dough was so firm, I couldn't even knead in enough water to soften it up. Even assuming that my flour was dry, this recipe still seems way out of whack.

Great bread.... I am glad I gave it a try... it was really nice because I didn't have to eat up the oven in the summer to make it... it did taste great though... next time I will try adding some garlic to the butter for more of a garlic flavor... but it is a good bread...

Fantastic bread! Made my first about 2 months ago and now its a staple around our house. Easy, quick (about 15 mins real time) and everyone at our house loves it. I had to double the recipe to keep up with demand, because I was making it every other day.

Amazing! I couldn't believe how great these were. Much better than store-bought naan, especially when fresh off the pan (I used a non-stick skillet instead of a grill and they still came out phenomenal). I made half the batch garlic and the other half non-garlic and both were wonderful!  Tasty and somewhat chewy- perfect!!!!

Soooo good!  This turned out almost exactly like the Naan you get in Indian restaurants.  It was awesome, soft, and heavenly.  My 2 & 3 year old children loved it as well.  I didn't feel like heating up the grill & I don't have a gas stove like many make Naan on.  So, I heated up a non-stick skillet to medium heat & sprayed it with Pam & cooked my Naan on it till it got puffy & was lightly browned on the bottom.  Then, I flipped it & did the other side.  I brushed melted butter on both sides during cooking.  I was hesitant to try it this way because who has heard of Naan cooked on a non-stick skillet?  However, it turned out quite lovely.  It was soft, buttery, & just lovely.  Oh, & I did add about a tablespoon of vegtable oil to the dough when kneading it because it was really dense before hand.  The oil loosended it up a little- perfect!

This recipe was amazing. I followed everything that the recipe said to do I just added some more garlic. Also used an outside gas grill to cook and it turned out perfectly. Very soft on the inside and yummy and crispy on the outside. Perfect recipe.

This was a huge win--and it came out great using my bread maker to make the dough.  There were two things missing from the recipe as it is:
1.  This does not serve 14.  This makes 25 pieces of naan, some of them oversized.  If you're serving for three or two, I suggest cutting the recipe down.  
2.  How flat should they be rolled?  We tried a few different ways and came to the conclusion that over-flattening them causes them to come out too crispy.  Still tasty, just more of a cracker texture.
I served this with Aloo Phujia over rice and had a great Indian dinner night.

This bread is absolutely amazing! It was so easy to make too! We served it with shish kebobs and hummus. At the end of the meal my daughter turned to me and said "Mom, I don't care if we ever eat another bread ever again, but please don't stop making this!!!" I see a lot of Naan in our family's future! Thanks so much for sharing this recipe!

Made several times.  I add quite a bit more garlic as I can't have too much.  I use a cast iron skillet as opposed to the grill.  Excellent results and they freeze perfectly. Thanks for sharing!

This turned out great!
I used almond milk, and about a teaspoon of granulated garlic since I didn't have any fresh garlic to mince. 
My only problem was the dough ended up pretty sticky - I was able to work in about 3 1/4 cups of flour before I couldn't work anymore flour into it. 

When I was rolling out the dough balls I needed to add more flour to prevent the dough from sticking to me/the rolling pin/the waxed paper I was using.

Using a charcoal grill for this was a little hard, at first the dough was bubbling up great but the later pieces we threw on didn't bubble up as much which I think was because the charcoal wasn't as hot anymore. But it tasted great, we had it with fresh homemade tzatziki dip.

We make this every time we make indian food and my kids and the hubbs devour it! We cook it on our indoor grill pan on our gas stove and it makes the coolest markings on it. My husband says it's better than the naan we get @ the restaurant. We make this with an altered version of Indian butter chicken from this site. Indian food night is our favorite night.

Really happy with how this turned out.  I didn't have bread flower, so just used all purpose.   Based on a tip from another reviewer, I added 1/2 tsp of baking soda, but still didn't bubble they way I've seen it in restaurants & at trader joe's. Still, very good flavor and texture.

Wonderful. The second time I used a tiny bit less flour, and it worked better for me. I'm not sure, but I think I upped the yeast by maybe 50%. Really delicious. And easy.

This turned out FANTASTIC!  I made a cucumber yogurt sauce, hummus and grilled some chicken and it all went great together!  This is one I will make again and again.

Not nearly as good as I thought it would be. Our favorite restaurant is in Harrisburg PA and has the BEST Naan bread ever done in a clay oven. This recipe didn't work well for me.

Not bad when you first make it and it is hot off the grill.  This naan is a little bit dense.  THe next day the Naan  seemed a bit more stale than I thought it would even sealed correctly.

This recipe didn't taste the way I had hoped. I was hoping for a Naan like the one I buy regularly. Despite not being quite what I wanted, it is a really great recipe. I've made it several times now, and my boyfriend is hooked on this. Like other reviewers, I didn't need as much flour as it calls for. This bread, more than some others I've made, seems sensitive to cold. Once I kicked the heat up 10 degrees in the house (to 75 degrees), it came out great! It turned out even better when I used a warm tray for the second rising. I will continue to make this. Thanks for sharing it!

Absolutely delicious!  I've never made these before and they came out perfect!  Just like the restaurants!    As others have mentioned, I used powdered garlic in the melted butter and grilled these on my George Forman grill.  Wonderful recipe!  Thank you!

Really good and way easier then I expected.  I decreased the flour as was suggested in previous reviews.  I cooked it on a grill pan and had no problem with bubbles forming.  
It was great.  I loved it and so did my hubby and daughter

I found this recipe to be simple and delicious! Everyone in our family loved it - there is nothing like hot, fresh naan.

Another reviewer mentioned cooking on an open indoor grill, which is what I did today (my gas grill is buried under a foot of snow). It came out just great. 

I used quick-acting yeast which cut the rising times down and I would use that again.

Used this recipe to go along side my first attempt at Saag. The bread was perfect. The saag I might have to work on. I used only 4 cups of flour before kneading on a floured surface.

This is excellent! I followed the advice of another reviewer by melting butter with the garlic.  Delicious! The guests for dinner had both lived in Pakistan and India and raved about it! Whew.  Excellent, simple, and fun recipe!

Excellent recipe.  I have made this several times, once on the grill, once in the oven, and my favorite- in a buttered skillet.  To get the dough really flat, press it down with the bottom of a cup, wait a few minutes, then repeat again and again until it is flat enough for you.  I used this as a crust for BBQ chicken pizza and it is wonderful!  I always proof the yeast first by adding the warm water and sugar to the yeast at once, I am not sure why the steps don't add the sugar in the first step.  GREAT RECIPE!

Delicious and very easy to make!
I had a little problem with getting it just as soft as I want, but then again, I don't have the right kind of grill for making naan. The flavor was delicious!

These are so good.  I used all-purpose flour, turned out just fine.  Instead of kneading in garlic, I put it in the melted butter.  It was almost too garlicky that way, but sooo good

First try at Naan and it was GREAT!  Easy to make.  We baked some on the grill and some on a stone on the oven.  Both were delicious.  The first one on the grill was a little black.  Indirect heat was better, and the grilled ones were the best.  Delicious first Indian meal with Palak Paneer and Mulligatawny Soup.

This recipe has potential, but it hasn't quite hit the mark for me as yet.  I used the bread maker (highly recommend) but added 4 c flour - 3.5 c would have been better to achieve soft dough.  Also, I found the dough too sweet for my liking (next time will reduce sugar by 50%).  Rising stages worked fine.  Used my wooden tortilla press to shape the individual naan, starting with an oval of dough.  Worked great - pressed between pieces of parchment.  As others have suggested, need to watch heat on BBQ - I have 3 elements so kept one high, one medium and one off, jugging the naan as needed.  This was an easy recipe and I will try again with a few modifications.

Yum! Recipe was great and super easy. I just cooked them on a (dry) frying pan over high heat. When I make them again I will up the garlic and either up the salt or butter them with salted butter. I like things salty though.

Didn't have the egg on hand so just added a little bit more water. Turned out great! I think I quadrupled the amount of garlic used, but then again I REALLY like garlic. Makes loads so I will freeze the rest for another meal.

Easy to make. Family loved 'em. Roll them very thin (2-3mm) or leave them fat (5-10mm), either way they are soft and tasty. This is what our home-cooked Indian meals were missing.

Superb nann!  I'll admit I was skeptical that this recipe would approximate the naan at our favorite gourmet Indian restaurant, despite the glowing reviews.  I did not use the optional garlic, and I would say this recipe is indistinguishable from the naan at The Gopuram. I cut back on the salt, but I believe it needs the full amount called for.  I will not be looking for another naan recipe.  This is exactly what I was hoping for.

I made it vegan using soy milk, enrgy egg replacer, and earth balance margarine.  Sprinkled garlic salt on when done frying.  Very tasty and easy to make.  Went great with homemade hummus, cucumber dipping sauce, and kalamata olives.  (not a big fan of pita bread, so I use naan with that kind of stuff...yum)

reallyy really good - we had it with an Indian chicken soup and even my boyfriend loved it and he usually does not like bread as a side :) I use one cup whole wheat flour (just to try and make it a little more healthy) - but i didn´t use the whole 4 1/2 cups of flour. I did add a little carbin.soda like someone suggested - and I made the ball from two pinches as well and rolled them into one ball like someone else suggested as well. I agree that the pan only needs to be med low - no way does it need to be very hot !! I put some garlic and koriander into the butter to brush the sides and it came out perfect - THANK YOU MIC :D

Great Recipe. I also used this recipe with whole wheat flour and the outcome was great! The dough can be made in advance- and then frozen. I take it out 3 hrs before I start making the naans and it rises again and the naans come out just as well. Have also used the whole wheat dough as a pizza base to make thin crust pizzas. This recipe is so good, I will never eat store bought naans again!

We love this recipe.  It's a little bit time consuming but otherwise very easy.  We've made it several times so far and it has come out great every time.  My only complaint is that it's so good it's hard not to eat way too much!

these were wonderful fresh from the oven with melted butter, cinnamon, and sugar....a healthy alternative to my family's fave, indian fried bread. I added only a pinch of salt to accomidate my Dad's low sodium diet, and they still turned out yummy!

This recipe is excellent, I've halved the recipe several times an I have even used egg replacer and it comes out perfect every time.  I do think that making the entire recipe takes a good amount of time to cook in one fry pan, but it is definitely worth it. I rinsed out the fry pan several times in between frying a couple of breads to keep the pan from skoking.  I also didn't use butter to brush the tops of the bread afterwards because I thought it didn't need it.

This was fairly easy and had a great flavor.  I recommend adding a bit of sugar to the warm water when you are dissolving the yeast as it helps with rising the dough a bit quicker. I also added some baking soda to help make it a little more bubbly but not really sure if it helps too much as I didn't see a huge change as I normally do when adding baking soda to recipes.  I baked half the recipe in a cast iron skillet and it turned out phenomenal: had that grill, charred flavor that is typical of naan. The other half I baked in the oven for 10 minutes at 375 and it resulted in a product EXACTLY like pita: pocket and all!  The only thing I noticed is that it didn't have a big garlic flavor so I will definitely be making garlic butter to spread over during the cooking process.  All in all, a keeper recipe!

Super recipe for naan!  I have to double the recipe when I make it because everyone loves it so much.  My toddler and seven year old love these naan.  I sometimes substitute half whole wheat flour for the bread flour.  I cook them with a lid on them in a cast iron frying pan.  They come out great with nice bubbles.

This a a fantastic recipe. It was too cold to grill, so I used a griddle.  I used half AP flour and half bread flour and added a 1/4tsp baking soda. I will be making this again.

My daughter sent me this recipe to make for her.  I have made it several times in the last few weeks because my family can't get enough of the bread.  I did put the ingredients into the breadmaker, under the dough setting and let it do the kneading and rising.  Took it out and followed the rest of the directions.  How easy was that!  Great recipe, thanks for sharing.

I used one cup whole wheat flour and the rest white flour.  All the hard work was done by the dough cycle on my bread machine.  Then, I just broke off balls, rolled it out with my rolling pin, and cooked it in my big frying pan over the stove.  Incredible! I dipped the first cooked one in olive oil while I was standing at the stove cooking the rest....I didn't think I'd be able to stop eating it!

This was the first time that I ever had or made Naan. I have to say that it was AMAZING!!! I would eat this Naan every day of the week, but I'd gain 50 pounds! I would recommend adding the garlic, it really brought the Naan to the next level.

I used this recipe tonight and they turned out wonderful. My back was killing me because it is a lot of work kneading and rolling etc but it was worth it. It says prep time 30 but you have to let it rise for a total of 1 1/2 hours so really its take a lot longer to prep and finish. But it is awesome.

Loved it! I made the dough in the bread machine with 3.5 cups flour. It was a little sticky and I might add more flour next time but the final product was awesome. I cooked it on the stove top in a frying pan on medium-high heat. My family loved it!

I loved it and my family did too. I did not put in the garlic but next time I will. I got 16 out of my batch. I put the sugar in with the yeast to help activate it. Also, cook one side, flip them add cheese to it. It makes a great treat too! Will make again for sure.

I tried this for the first time today and was halfway pleased with the way it came out.  Followed some of the reviewer's suggestions - some worked others didn't.  I forgot to add the baking powder as one suggested, but found I didn't need if for bubbles - the trick of pinching off a few separate balls and then rolling them together produced plenty of bubbles.  The adding garlic butter after did not work well for me.  I also used the stone baking method and the garlic and butter burned this way.  By the way, needed much more butter for these, next time I'll at least double the recipe recommendation.  Also, didn't like them so thin - the Naan breads I've had have always been thicker and more bread like - these had a sort of motzah feel to them, so next time I'll make them thicker.  I did like the flavor however, so I gave them 3 stars for now.  I think this is one of those recipes with a learning curve, so I'll probably re-rate them after attempting again - surely they were good enough for another shot at it. Thanks for posting.

All in all, this was a very easy recipe to make.  As for the grilling, it took me a minute to figure out the heat and whatnot...the first few burned, but after that they were great!  Tastes like it's straight from an Indian restaurant!

GLORIOUS!!!  Well worth the effort.  Served w/ homemade "Extra Easy Hummus".  Mixed the garlic and butter together for the spread.  Turned toaster oven to highest setting on bake, baked on greased pan (w/ holes). Made 16 pieces, approx. 5 inches across.

This recipe is excellent. My husband and I love Indian food and this certainly will be a recipe that will be a great accompaniment. It turned out as good as any we have tasted in an Indian restaurant.

I tried a naan recipe from a cookbook and that was a slight failure. This recipe was a lot better! I know I probably didn't do it exactly as said, plus I made them on the stovetop.. next time I will try it by grilling :)

I have made plenty a naan recipes - but this one is the BEST.  So easy and can almost bake every one in a single batch on the grill.  We are all addicted.  But I must add that you do need a very nice curry dish to scoop on your naan.  Thank you for sharing this great recipe.

PERFECT!! This was so good. I used the garlic option and actually grilled on my BBQ. I rolled it out a little thicker than you would find in a traditional Indian restaurant because I was using an outside BBQ. My husband and children loved it.

This was fantastic!  Served with Chicken Tikka Masala and basmati rice.  My yeast didn't seem to activate very well (no frothing) and the ball didn't really double in an hour, but the bread was fantastic.  We  brush one side with butter and put that side down on the grill first, then butter the other side so the butter sides both got "cooked."  As directed in the recipe, we found it a little greasy.  I did NOT knead any garlic in and thought it was more flavorful than at our local Indian restaurant.

Great recipe!  Thank you to the person who submitted and to those who added tips in prior reviews.  I added the garlic to the butter rather than in the dough, and used a George Forman grill (lid closed, but turning after about 3 minutes).  The whole family loved it!

I have to agree -- this Naan is great -- made it a few weeks ago and now have a request to make it again!  I was wondering about powdered garlic -- I too am lazy -- glad to hear it worked out.  First time around I used the minced and it was a little too labor intensive for me :)  The grill is the key though -- I've made Naan before in the oven but nothing compares to this.  Please try and enjoy!

Turned out beautifully. I used my foreman grill. Unfortunately that meant that it took me like 2.5 hours. I didn't use the garlic, but I wouldn't be against it. I paired it with some Curried Coconut Chicken and Jasmine Rice, it was great!

I tried naan the first time last week, at a local restaurant and asked the owner (I know her from around town) if she had a tandoor which she didn't, she said she deep fried the breads, and found they were actually more moist and puffier than trying to bake them in the oven or on the stove top, and less dry than traditional tandoor baked breads. As she is a native from India. So there you have it, right from the cooks mouth!

Yum yum yum... wish I had the time everyday to make these tasty tidbits. BF gobbled them up as fast as they came off the grill. I used a large inside grill on my gas stove and they puffed up nicely.

This was really too thick for an authentic naan. The flavor wasn't too bad and it froze well, but I doubt I'll make it again.

Unfortunately, I don't own a pizza stone so I used a griddle (350 degrees).  So long as you roll them out very thin (VERY THIN), you can get the naan to appear naan-ish.  My first attempt gave us thick, kind of chewy in the center flat bread that wasn't horrible, but not completely appealing.  We made the entire batch of dough but only used a third of it.  I wrapped the remainder in wax paper and then stored it a plastic ziplock bag in the fridge.  Then, I completely forgot about it for over a week!  My man/kitchen-wizard discovered it and tried one suggestion to use the dough for pizza and it worked!  Then, a few nights later, we made more naan (this time he rolled it out very thin).  We found that the bread tastes better when you coat the griddle in butter first, cook on one side for about a minute, then flip.  So yummy!

This bread tastes delicious! The only thing I changed was omitting half of the salt. And I'm glad I did. The one thing that will keep me from making this frequently is the time it took to cook it. We don't have a grill so I just used a pan to cook them. Each one took 3 minutes or so, but I had to stand there the whole time and then put the next one in. Too time consuming, but very delicious! Thankful it makes a fair amount, I just threw the left overs in the fridge and put it in the toaster oven when I wanted to eat some more. I will cook this when I make butter chicken. Thank you for a DELICIOUS recipe though!

I used half whole wheat flour thinking that I'd be a little health conscious...bad idea. I think my deviation made the bread a bit too heavy. Although, my husband and our friends (we had curry/ korma night) still really loved it!   I'm convinced staying on the recipe is the best bet.

Great recipe! Totally a keeper! I read a bunch of reviews and based on them I proofed the yeast first (added a tbl of sugar to the yeast and water), I didn't add the garlic to the dough but to the butter (I liked this suggestion a lot), I rolled the dough very thinly, and since I didn't have a grill I used an open George Foreman. It turned out great! The George Foreman was a pretty good substitute for a grill, even giving the bread the grill marks. I didn't have any problem with the dough, and I even put in half whole wheat flour to make it a little healthier. I paired this with Wendy's Indian Butter Chicken from this site and what a meal! I would recommend both recipes and they go great together :)

My kids loved, loved, loved this bread!  It was actually really easy.  I ended up making it on a stove top griddle & it worked out just fine.  I did use bread flour, as the recipe calls for--not AP, as I do in some bread recipes.

I really liked this nana recipe I`ve never made nana before so I wanted it to turn out really great! and It did this dough CAN be frozen t after you make the dough and when your not ready to use it. when you are just unthaw.   I added the garlic and it was tasty.  I also used olive oil because that`s the only oil I use to cook with. But I have one critique:  Roll the dough  out thinly BEFORE you cook it if you don`t it will not rise and it WILL BE RAW ON THE INSIDE NO MATTER HOW BROWN IT LOOKS OUTSIDE!!!!   AND COOKING IT IN A SKILLET MAKES FOR FASTER COOKING ESPECIALLY WHEN YOUR MAKING THIS FOR DINNER OR WHEN YOUR HUNGRY.

Delicious! My family loved it.  Only rating 4 stars, however, because I did alter it as suggested by others, by cutting back to 3 1/2 cups flour, and omitting the garlic. I made the dough in my bread machine and cooked it on an electric grill. Definitely a keeper!

Pretty good. I proofed the yeast as others suggested and did not add the garlic.  There seems to be a little something missing from this recipe that makes it fall short of naan from indian restaurants.

I followed the recipe exactly and the naan turned out soft and delicious - very similar to the naan I have had at Indian restaurants.   I cooked the known in a saute pan and put them in the oven on warm to keep them hot until they were all finished.  No troubles with the dough rising or getting the bubbles!

this is the best tasting naan ever now i tried cooking it 3 ways in the oven, in a fry pan, then on the grill at my local tavern... The grill was by far the best they looked just like the photo. My girls melted cheese and dipped them in pizza sauce and loved them that way I like them with butter but plain is just as good... Why if its naan a flat bread do we use yeast? can anyone enlighten me...

This recipe was really easy and delicious! The first time I made it I even altered it a bit. I added half whole wheat white flour and flax seed. I also made the loaves bigger, making about 8 or 10. I used them as the wrap for falafel's. It came out absolutely wonderful! This will be my go to Naan recipe. Very tender and easy.

WOW!    I made it this morning. It is terrific. I put the ingredients in the bread machine for about 15 minutes. Then followed the rest of the recipe. I baked the naans in a greased cast iron skillet at 425 for about 4 minutes on each side & it came out perfect. Is great for any kind of dip or spread. Makes a great breakfast side too.

Our family likes the naan. I used quick yeast and put all ingredients (except butter & garlic (omitted)and put extra 1/2 C water in, it's dry in our location) into KitchenAid; knead for 10 to 15 mins until the dough is smooth and 'stretchy'. I made 18 naan. Roll them thin (7-8 in. diameter). Since I buttered both sides of the dough, no extra oil needed in the pan. Heat non-stick pan medium to low and the dough bubbled nicely (1-2 mins.).

The ingredients are very simple, but the taste is great!  I loved it.  It did take a lot of time making the dough, and I didn't have a grill so I had to use my skillet.  I noticed that the flatter I could get the dough the better they turned out.  My husband was very impressed.  This is definitely going to go down as one of my favorites!  Loved it.

In terms of taste and texture, this naan is pretty much just like something I would get at my favourite Indian restaurant, although it's a bit more dense. I was amazed at how simple it was to make, though it was time-consuming. However, I will have to tweak with it a bit to give it the appearance of authentic naan. I don't have a grill so I tried laying some directly on the grill of the oven and I put a few in the skillet. I don't think I rolled these out flat enough (I don't have a rolling pin) so the ones in the oven were extremely puffy. The ones from the skillet were flatter but weren't as pretty. I think that I will try rolling these out flatter and then baking them on the grill like a pizza.

This was so good, tasted just like the naan we had at our local indian restaurant.  It was relatively easy to make as well.  I did have to let it rise for longer the first time, about 1 1/2 hours.  I grilled it on my cast iron grill pan on the stove, and omitted the garlic from the butter- just a preference at the time.  It was great, and my daughter thinks I should make it for every meal!

WoW! I'm so pleasently surprised at the ease, flavor and versatility of this recipe. I made this to eat with lamb kabobs, tzatziki sauce, lettuce and tomatoes. My son is eating the naan by itself and said he wants to try it with eggs, bacon and cheese! This bread would probably go with anything. I made half of the recipe and infused the butter with the garlic rather than adding it to the dough. Love it. Love it. Love it!!

Only change I made was to add a bit of baking soda and it turned out great! I stored the dough balls in the fridge for a couple of days and would quickly roll out and cook a naan on a pan on the stove whenever I felt like it.

This bread is simple and delicious. I give it a 4 rather than a 5 because I've never eaten naan before so I have nothing to compare it to.

I substituted yogurt for the milk and cooked the naan on a preheated (500 degrees F.)kiln shelf (my version of a pizza stone, thicker)in the oven. Fabulous, puffed up well!

This was wonderful! Not as airy as the naan in Indian restaurants I've been to. It was more dense, but very delicious.  My roommates gobbled it up!

Decided to go without the garlic, but loved the results.  Not quite like what we eat in restaurants, but the best recipe I've come across.  My kids were still asking for more after it was all gone.

I chose this naan recipe because I had all the ingredients on hand.  I used regular All Purpose flour instead of bread flour, and they turned out fine.  I cut the recipe in half and prepared the dough in my bread machine. I used a stove-top cast-iron "grill," and made them without garlic and added it to the butter while on the grill. The bread was tender and delicious.  My son loved it, and it went well with the Hummus III recipe and fresh veggies. Thanks, Mic!

I made this recipe because I went to the store looking for some and they were all out. I had just made hummus this morning and chips weren't gonna cut it. It did take a while to rise and I got a nap it so it was cool. I made these on the griddle. I wouldn't recommend rolling them thin, but shaping them by hand like you would do pizza dough. These things were sooooo good. Definitely a keeper. I might start using this as my pizza dough.

Great Recipe. Have made many different naan recipes, and this is by far the best. Time to build a tandoori oven!  A few tips: (1) I used special white flour, which is similar to bread or pizza flour.   (2) I kept the dough moist, because the flour absorbs a lot of water during the rising phase.   (3) I cooked mine over charcoal. I had a charcoal BBQ and hook up a small fan to get it burning really hot. I placed a cast iron grill over it, turned the fan off, put the naan on and then put a large lid over the top. It was the best I could do to simulate a tandoor. Anyway - they cooked in 60 seconds and tasted fantastic - complete with lots of bubbles and a great texture.  Luke

Alright, so I just recently got an allrecipes account, but I have been making this recipe for over a year. THIS IS GREAT. I always leave out the garlic, but other than that, I follow it exactly and get GREAT results. Everyone always raves about it! On the stovetop or the grill, this is a truly tasty treat that goes with any meal. It's not much like the usual naan, like the kind you get in restaurants, but these puppies are good. :)

Wonderful. Had this for Indian night and this helped deal with the spicy food. I followed the original recipe but I cooked it in a skillet and I noticed that some of mine had problems rising at first. I solved this by first adding butter for a nice taste then adding the butter side to the skillet, letting it cook slightly, just enough time to butter the other side, then flip it over.  I flip it over a couple of times to help it along, however, burning it actually gave it some really good flavor. Oil helps as well. Next time I'm adding more garlic into the dough because I'm a fan of garlic.

I didn't use the grill to cook the naan. I did like the recipe and will make it again. I did add 1 tsp sugar to the yeast before adding the additional ingredients. I would make the balls bigger next time. The pieces of naan ended up being the size of a small pancake.

not sure what happened w/ mine but it turned out more like a flatbread b/c of the density. when i tried it thin seemed too crispy...flavor wise was good, i like the "garlicy" flavor. i will give it another try to make sure it wasnt me. :(

I've never made naan before. I live in Central America and so I wasn't sure I'd be able to find already made naan at the store for our Indian themed party. I decided to try my hand at it with this recipe. It was a huge success!  most of the pieces I ended up with were about the size of the palm of my hand. All the naan I've seen in my favorite Indian restaurants back home was twice that size so if I made this again I would either combine two of the balls before frying or make them twice as big from the start. Also, I don't have a grill so I just fried them on med-high heat in a covered skillet. Watch them closely! I burned a couple... Enjoy! The naan was delicious!

I make this naan all of the time. It is definitely a go to bread in my family. You can add all sorts of spices to it. My personal favorite is sprinkling about 2 tsp of curry into the mixture to make a curry naan. The garlic powder is really great to, but I add about 1 tsp more than the recipe calls for.

I am making this for the second time this week- this time for company.  My whole family loved these.  I also added 1 tbs of the sugar to the yeast mixture and as soon as I did the mixture started to bloom- so I know it needed it!  They took longer to cook than I expected, but they were worth it.

Excellent -- Had to use my griddle at highest heat rather than a grill pan, but it worked well -- bubbled like it should.  Leftovers made great individual pizzas.

these were fantastic, though best eaten within a few minutes of cooking, as they became a little chewy later. I did them under the broiler for about 2 mins on each side. Also added black onion seeds (aka nigella) instead of the garlic

This bread was amazing.  Easy to make and just impressive!  It is the best bread I've tasted outside of an Indian restaurant.  I was paying $2.79 at a local grocery store for TWO pieces of Naan bread and this recipe yielded at least 15 good sized pieces and they tasted better.  Don't worry if they look floppy on your grill.  Make sure you spray your grill w/nonstick spray, arrange the dough, and you just watch them rise.  It's that simple.

YUM! This is a great Naan recipe!  I overlooked that it takes 1 1/2 hours of sitting though and so we had to have it WAY after we were done eating.  My fault for not reading it through all the way!  But this is great Naan.  It didn't get the bubbles that you usually see in restaurants - but that didn't stop it from being totally delicious!

For my first time this came out excellent!!  I always preheat my oven to 200 then turn it off and place the dough with a damp towel over it with the door open to help it rise faster.  Then I tried the suggestions of reviewers and pinched the dough to help it bubble, but forgot to cover while cooking.  The size of the balls is a bit small for my preference and the temp of the stove was a bit high, other than that great recipe!  I added 3 cloves minced garlic to the dough and 2 cloves to the butter.  I keep the dough refrigerated and enjoy them for a few nights!!  Fabulous!!

Perfect every time, and it even freezes well.  I have cut out some steps by mixing the dough in a bread maker first and it still produces an excellent bread.

Having last made bread in grade school that would be better used as a door stop, I was amazed that this bread turned out okay.  I made it too thin at first but by the last few pieces I had it sorted out and it was great.  The pieces aren't golf ball sized, more like baseball sized before you roll them out.  I didn't make substitutions, did the proofing with the 1 T of sugar, but used 1 T of yeast instead of a 1 pkg.

Excellent recipe! I made this for a soup and bread event at school to serve about 30 people and it was a hit with curry. Relatively easy bread to make, but pretty involved time-wise. We fried the dough instead of grilling it and it came out fantastic. Tastes great by itself or with soup

Delicious! I made this for a girls night with an Indian menu. It's snowing out and I didn't want to grill out, so I cooked it on an electric griddle and it came out great. I would definitely recommend using the garlic. It had a very good flavor and soft but slightly chewy texture. We served this with coconut curry chicken, hummus and veggies, and an Indian coconut rice pudding kind of thing. Not difficult to make either, but a bit time consuming.

Turned out a little less light and fluffy than I expected, although this may be due to us not having a grill or stone.

I just made this on my stove and think that it's just ok.  Though it's nice and soft, it does not taste like naan that I'm used to eating.  I think that the buttering on both sides is a bit excessive (tastes like so much butter) and I think next time I'm just going spray the pan with butter flavored cooking spray and leave it like that.  I'm also going to try adding the baking soda to see if I can get some bubbles next time since that mgiht change it.  I'm going to make some Chicken Tikka Masala tomorrow and eat it with that so hopefully it will taste better that way.  It is very easy to make and so much cheaper than buying the naan in the store.

This turned out great, served this with indian chicken.  Do not grill this on 'high' on outdoor propane gas grill.  I charred several.  Instead use medium heat.  I guess high heat for those who grill it on stovetop.

This recipe makes the most beautiful dough that is a dream to work with.    It tastes great plain and with butter, cinnamon, and sugar.    This will be my go-to recipe from now on....thanks Mic!

This is so easy to make, I don't think I will ever buy store bought naan again. I only used half of the dough so I froze the rest to use at a later date. Grilled them on a stove top grill and omitted the garlic.

Delicious!  I used a pizza stone (oven - 500 degrees) and olive oil instead of butter.

On my first try I managed to make a better naan than any local restaurant using this recipe. Definitely 5 star material.  Like others have mentioned, I only needed approximately 3 1/2 cups of flour.

Very easy to make and we have so much fun with it. We make this every time we have curry and we experiment with adding things like roasted garlic, peas, and so on...

This recipe is great. The only thing I did differently was that I rolled the dough out really thin like they do in my favorite restaurant. Another time I substituted wheat flour and it turned out just as good.

Pretty good!  Tastes great when you add crushed garlic.  I also made about half of them plain - they make for great breakfast "toast" with either honey or jam!

Excellent recipe.  It was a hit with my family.  My neighbor from Pakistan suggested making it a little thicker to keep it soft for the next day.  A friend tried Naan recipes before.  When I shared this one she was so excited and her family loved it, too.

Thanks for the great recipe!! Everyone loved it, and I've had alot of requests for the recipe. Used a countertop grill to cook and it worked really well- nice grill marks on the outside, and soft and chewy on the inside.

Absolutely fantastic!   I've made this recipe numerous times both for indian food (usually makhani :) ), and even for use in gyro-style sandwiches.  It always looks like too much, but I promise, it is never enough.  My picky little brother will eat all of it if we don't watch him.

I used self rising flour and didn't add salt or baking soda and got a perfect amount of bubbling. I also cooked on a dry skillet w/a lid and only cooked for about 30-45 secs. on each side.  We also left off the butter and dipped them in curried lentil soup (store bought), Very yummy!

The flavor of this naan was great, although I couldn't get it to bubble and puff up as much as I wanted to, even after adding 1/2 tsp of baking soda as was suggested. I found that adding a little olive oil to the pan (I don't have a griddle or anything) before cooking each piece of naan helped it to brown nicely and really brought out the flavor (I also brushed each side with butter as the recipe called for). Despite my lack of experience cooking naan, it turned out delicious and I can't wait to try it again!

I've never made Naan bread before in my life and I'm so glad my sister-in-law suggested this recipe because it is the most delicious tasting bread. I loved the texture and the butter on top just added to it. Instead of saying icing on the cake, we'll now say it's butter on the naan!

I didn't roll it out. I pulled it into circular shapes and then baked in a 500 degree oven. Very good. Definitely a keeper!

SO GOOD! Serve right away -hot. You can use a fast rising yeast to cut back on time. Watch the grill- they cook quickly. The garlic is to die for- must try this bread.

I didn't give it 5 stars just because I think it's a little difficult to make- It was hard to get the dough rolled out thin enough then into the skillet, then trying to get it to brown without burning. I had the stove down to low/med. Forgot to add the baking soda but the lid trick did help in creating bubbles on one side. My girls loved it and it went great with the Fragrant Chicken Curry II. Maybe practice will make perfect?!

This is a FANTASTIC and EASY to make recipe that EVERYONE loved!!  It was my first ever time in making Naan, and I can't wait to make it again!!  The kids just went nuts over it, and I agree that even if there were nothing to go with it, it would have sufficed in and of itself as an entire meal!!

WOW!!is all I have to say. Easy to make. I used 4 cups of flour, the naan still turned out light and fluffy. My husband cooked them on our barbecue, and lightly buttered each side. This gave the naan those great grill marks. Cook time on the barbecue was less than a minute on each side. Thank you for this recipe, FABULOUS!!!

This is an outstanding recipe. I substituted yogurt for the milk and add just a touch more water to keep the dough from getting too stiff. It is wonderful!

I have never had naan before and I was preparing an Indian meal so I decided to try this recipe. It was delicious and it tasted quite familiar to me although at first I couldn't figure out what it was. Then I remembered - it tasted very similar to the soft pretzel's from the chain Auntie Ann's. So I decided to use this naan dough recipe for pretzel dough instead from now on. After the the 2nd rising, I rolled out the balls of dough into ropes and shaped them into pretzels. I then dipped them in melted butter and sprinkled on some coarse salt, baked at 425 for about 15 minutes. Yummy! Try it!

Great recipe, haven't ever made bread let alone naan.   They turned out great.  Made with butter chicken.  I used my goerge forman grill, only complaint with that is that it took forever grilling one at a time.  Will be much easier for those using regular grill.

one of my favorite recipes on the site. Delicious! I easily made this veganize for a potluck by using soymilk and flaxseed egg replacer(1tablespoon ground flaxseed + 3 tablespoons water per egg). I'll make this again and again.

This recipe is absolutely wonderful! If you like naan you should definitely try this recipe. It's even better some of the Indian restaurant I've tried. Recommended!

Delicious! I love to make bread and this one is a keeper. My husband loved it and he's not a big bread lover like me.  I didn't change anything but used the sugar called for in the recipe to proof the yeast and added the garlic when I was mixing all the ingredients instead of kneading it in.  Thank you for the great recipe!

Dhelicious!  The only thing I did differently was to add dry spices to the flour before mixing everything.  Helped keep things mixed evenly.  Tried garlic and a garlic-basil-sundried tomato mix.
Thanks.

Hands down exceptional! I didn't change a thing, but took the option and added 1 teaspoon garlic...perfect. Used an electric grill to make it and it came out better than expected with the little bubbles in the bread. My husband asked if it was hard to make because "I'll definitely want you to make it a lot more often." He used to be the chef in the family, but looks like the tables have turned.

Great and simple recipe! I halved it, and added the garlic to the melted butter, as recommended, and sprinkled with cilantro near the end. I used a grill pan on the stove. The golf ball size is a bit small, and I still only got 6 naan out of my half recipe.

This Naan went great with the chicken tikka masala (also from allrecipes). We loved it. The consistancy wasnt quite right for our tastes. We sauted the garlic in butter and added cilantro and it came out beautifully!

I like the "bubbles" in my Naan bread.  Had relatives over and they liked this naan better than store bought variety.Great with a curry or maligawtany soup.

My family loves trying new things, and I made this to go along with a meal we were having for dinner. It was absolutely amazing. 

The only alterations I made were adding two sprigs of fresh, chopped rosemary in addition to the garlic, and instead of grilling it, I cooked it on the stove in a pan. I brushed each side with olive oil and cooked it that way. 

This is a great recipe and will definitely be making it again.

I've been experimenting with chapati, rotis and now naan...wow was this recipe awesome!  Last week I purchased some for my curry dinner, and it was good.  This beats the store - bought, hands down!  Yummy.  I have to admit, the flour was a bit much, so I added more water a little at a time till I had a good dough.  Let it rise, made the little balls, andlet them rise.  I rolled it very thin, and sprayed a bit of oil in the frypan, they do cook pretty quickly, and bubble up nicely!  Thanks for posting this recipe!

Very easy. I don't have a conventional grill, but I used a George Foreman Grill. It worked great and was very easy!  I think next time I will add a little more garlic for some extra flavor.

I've never had naan other than what I made with this recipe, so I can't say how close it is to the real stuff. However I can say that this recipe is just delicious!! Definitely better with the garlic. And I don't have a grill, so I've cooked it in the oven, and also done it stovetop in a skillet (w/ just a little butter brushed over, until brown on both sides). Nice sweet bread, I could just eat this for the rest of my life and be happy!!!

This bread is great to have at table for dipping or just eating it on its own.  I already made some that I plan to take to the office tomorrow with my tikka masala.  I would however recommend using garlic powder over minced garlic, however, and upping the amount of milk.  I put in about 1/3 of a cup before the dough stopped sticking to the side of the bread mixer; you'll have to eyeball it and judge when to stop.

This turned out wonderfully for my family! I only had naan once before, but it is a favourite of my boyfriend's and he quite misses it (he's from England and ate it a lot before!) and loves this recipe as well.

Wonderful tasting!  With only a Charcoal grille and early darkness this time of year, I did it all in the dark and it wasnt easy to not burn it.  I would try to roll out the dough inside, but it would retract a lot making it hard to cook all the way through due to thickness.  Im not too experienced with dough, but does anyone know what makes it so rubbery and retract?

So good! Everyone in the house loved the naan. They were excellent leftover. I made some with the garlic and some without. We ate the plain ones with jelly the next day. Thanks for a wonderful recipe!

Excellent naan recipe.  I ate naan all the time while I was in India and am thrilled to find a recipe that is so close to that same taste. If I had a tandoori oven it would be perfect!

This was fantastic.  I don't have a grill so I did them in a frying pan, thus a little oiler than I would have liked, but SO delicious and the texture was perfect.  Just enough garlic too.  I followed the recipe exactly.

I LOVE this recipe! Very forgiving! I got hooked on aparticular Indian dish years ago, and always had trouble finding Naan in the stores. No more looking! I use a good, heavyweight pan to "fry" these in, and it works very well. Thank you for the awesome recipe!

Although the naan didn't come out as I had hoped (kinda dense, no bubbles), myself and the guests loved it. I added the 1/2 tsp. as suggested by others, but it still didn't seem to affect density. The taste was great, I left out the garlic and we've been using the naan with jams. I also used an electric griddle and they came out great.

Turned out great! I should have spread out the garlic before trying to knead it in though, oops! I brushed the naan with oil that had chopped cilantro, garlic powder, and a little salt and cooked outside on the grill. I cant wait to eat the leftovers!

Very good base recipe, however, I thought it was a little too much flour for that much liquid. I would just use 4 cups instead of 4 and half. Other than that, very good flavor.

Hmmm, I love naan and eat indian cuisine all the time, but my attempt at this resulted in flat bread with no lovely air pockets.  Don't know what went wrong  I proofed the yeast and allowed it to double in volume before even beginning this recipe... oh well.  It was still tasty, just didn't look anything remotely like naan.

Fantastic!  I saved the garlic to brush on top while cooking (fried over medium-low heat), and sprinkled the top with cilantro as well.  The garlic-cilantro combination tasted JUST like the naan from my favorite restaurant!

Very good!  I did add a half tsp of baking soda as someone else suggested, and I'm glad I did--that way I had a little insurance that these would bubble up even if I didn't give them enough time to fully rise.  They were quick to make but still had the flavor of a yeast bread.  I experiemented with cooking methods, and frying in a skillet pan with olive oil WAY beat out the open George Foreman method.  Awesome!

I am so pleased with myself because I made Naan. I divided the dough and used garlic in one half and left the other plain, we all preferred the garlic ones. I cooked it in a frying pan on low heat. My daughter said it was as good as the naan she had in an Indian restaurant. Thankyou so much.

I thought this recipe was easy and tasted great.  I love the light garlic flavor and the butteryness of the bread.  I cooked it in a skillet for a couple minutes on each side and it worked great.

This was really great.  I used the fast acting yeast because I didn't start early enough to wait for all of the rising.  The naan came out just like what we've eaten at Indian restaurants, it was really good.  The recipe was really easy too, my husband cooked the naan in an electic skillet at 375 and it was very good.  This will become a regular part of our menu.

Mmmmmm...loved this recipe. I've been doing something similar to this for years...but this recipe is the best. I followed it exactly, only cooked in on low heat. As to adding the minced garlic, it's a must! It really adds so much flavor to the naan. Thanks for a great recipe!

I've never had naan before, so I really have no reference point, but, I'm here to tell you... this was DELICIOUS!!  I cooked it on my Webber kettle and served it with grilled tandoori chicken breast strips and raita... what a delight!  I made a full recipe for just the two of us, so had several left over.  Tried one the next day and it was still good... but by the third day, it was pretty stale.  I didn't try putting the leftovers in the freezer, may do that next time... and there WILL be a next time!  Thanks, Mic!

This is the best I have ever tried, but the only change that my Hubby made was
that while grilling the nan he suggested
that I should use Gas Or electris stove and use a Alluminum Frying Pan
instead of Non-Stick version, roll out
the dough pat evenly with your hands into a oblong shape just putting Nan into the pan spread few drops of milk on
top side of the rolled dough evenly spreading allover the naan( make sure
the heat is set to medium heat) place the naan with milk side down over the
pan as naan starts to bubble with few brown spots take the pan from the and
now as naan is firmly stuck to the pan
Flip around the pan and cook the uncooked side that the top side of the 
Naan as bottom isalready cooked on the first stage, finish off with garlic butter before serving.

This bread is fantastic!  I made it just as written even though I thought the sugar may be too much for the garlic, but it wasn't sweet and the garlic wasn't over-powering.  We will be making this a lot!  Thanks so much!

This was a good recipe, I was very worried at first, but this recipe is near fool proof. I made the naan in an iron skillet on the stove top, it still worked good. I think my only problem was that I was making them kind of thick, I'll make them thinner next time.

Update: Made a second time, and thinner this time. Texture is better. In the future I would use less sugar and more garlic, maybe even some garlic powder too.

amazing, amazing, amazing. I just got a bread machine and cant wait to try mixing the dough with it instead of by hand... it's a little tiresome by hand.  This takes a while but SO worth the wait.

Very good.  I had read another reviewer comment on not realizing how thin you had to make the dough before placing on the grill, but I did not appreciate this fact either.  Good flavor, but mine turned out about twice as thick as the Naan I get at Indian restaurants.

I have made this recipe many times for my husband and kids; this weekend I made it for a group of 40 for a birthday party.   I tripled the recipe and ended up with about 120 pieces!  Every single person raved about this bread and many asked for the recipe, saying it was the best naan they had ever tasted.  Every piece was eaten and everyone was scrounging around for more.   Great recipe!!

I won't give it less because I am likely doing something wrong. They are not turning out thick like Naan should be. Also, for a GRILL are you just using a frying pan on top of an oven or what?

This was great for a day when you have the time to make fresh naan.  I halved the recipe and wound up with 14 golf ball sized wads of dough.  Next time I will leave out the garlic.  As much as I love garlic, I would prefer my naan to be plain alongside my other tasty Indian dishes.

I made this for my class project on India.  Everyone loved them and begged me to make more!  It was the dead of winter when I used the grill outside, but it was totally worth it.

This naan came out great!  I made a full recipe, divided it into eight big piece, and grilled on a cuisinart griller. Next time I think I'll divide it into six pieces and roll the balls a little thicker. A couple things I would have changed... I thought the naan was way too buttery - after the first two naan that I did, I quit spreading butter on it (although it did taste good, I just like it better with not so much butter). Also, by suggestions from others who tried the recipe, i rolled the naan pretty thin - it was too thin for me. But I like my naan chewy and thick, so I guess it depends on your preference. Mine bubbled a little, but not so much. I also want to try it in a skillet. But the end result still tasted great with some chicken tikki masala and basmati rice!

I tried this recipe to go with some Indian food I was making for dinner. I don't have a grill pan and the broiler was not available to use.
The dough rose fine and all but the finished product was so thick! I rolled the piece out very thin and they still became thick and big(long) but it was good.  I didn't use the garlic in the recipe and forgot the butter.  Everything turned out great and the family loved them.

I would give this 10 stars if I could.  It was the hit of my Indian Feast. This was a great recipe.  Very easy to cook and a great compliment to the spicy foods associated with Indian cooking. I served it with Spicy Chicken Curry, Vegetable Biryani, Cilantro Chutney, and Spicy Indian Dahl.  It made a great meal for guests who enjoy Indian food.

I made this today for my family, and they loved it! I don't have a grill, so I just used a skillet over the stove, and it turned out fine.  Next time, though, I'm going to add a lot more garlic.

Very easy and yummy... I filled them with mashed peas and potatoes and it was deliscious.  I would say watch them closely if you have your grill set at high.  It only took 2 min. per side (if that) for me.

We have a delicious Himalayan buffet restuarant in town. They cringe when they see my boys coming because they consume about a dozen pieces of naan between the two! My 14 year old declared this was even better- and he ate 5 pieces of it! I grilled it inside on my George Foreman indoor/outdoor grill. YUM. I froze a little dough to see how that works. Would be nice to make larges batches all at once and freeze some for the future.

This was great.  I made it in an iron skillet and it was a bit tough, but the taste was great.  Next time, I'll make more balls so that I can roll it out thinner (more tortilla like).  I made it with the Butter Chickpea Curry and it was a huge hit.  Thanks so much!

This recipe made a lovely, easy to handle dough. It had a great flavor with the amount of salt.  They were also very soft and cooked nicely. I don't have  a grill, so I baked them at the highest temperature and quickly turned them to cook each side.  I will make these again. Thanks!

This naan turned out really well! It was definitely on par with what I've eaten in restaurants. I doubled both of the rise times, but that was for reasons of scheduling more than anything else. (My girlfriend was coming home later than I expected.) I can't wait to make this again!

These were fabulous! We omitted the garlic and just brushed it on with the melted butter. I lef the garlic out of some altogether and my son put butter and honey on it. Very versatile, definitely not just for Indian food! Thanks so much!

Never had naan before so I can't vouch for the authenticity of this recipe but I can say that it was good. I thought I hadn't rolled them out thin enough but they looked just like the ones in the picture. I modified the recipe down to 4 servings & I added extra garlic.

I am always skeptical when trying any recipe that involves yeast. But these turned out fine!  Makes alot!  Next time I will half the recipe and try cooking them on the stove.  They cook really quick. I burnt a few! (good thing it makes so much!) Also, they are better warm...so eat them right away.

This Naan was delicious and surprisingly easy to make.  I'm not very experienced with bread making but was very impressed with how this turned out.  I went light on the flour (as advised by other reviewers) and it came out soft and airy.  We didn't eat all of it yesterday, so I saved the rest of the dough in the fridge and we ate it tonight.  Yesterday I grilled it on our indoor grill (DeLonghi), and tonight I did it on a frypan.  It tasted less sweet tonight but was even more airy than yesterday (I'm guessing the yeast consumed the sugar and created more gas).  Oh, and I found it helpful to butter the dough ball before stretching.  This allowed me to get the dough nice and thin before grilling.  Thanks for sharing this fabulous recipe!

These were simply fabulous. Although it may not be traditionnal, I thought it was easier to add the garlic to the butter. This way you can skip on the garlic for the guests who don't like garlic. I was afraid the garlic would burn, but the cooking time is so fast it was no problem. With my gas grill, I had to reduce the temperature to medium to prevent the bread from burning.

I don't know why, but they seemed to fluffy to be naan. Try melting cheese on top- it's really good!

This was excellent.  I made half with garlic, half without, and sauteed it in butter and oil on the stove because I don't have a grill.  For those who couldn't get it thin enough they may have added too much flour, mine took only about 3 1/4 cups.

Update (11/29/09): I made this following everything on the recipe exactly. I grilled the naan on a cast iron grill on the stove, it was awesome! I served these with some satay chicken and grilled veggies! These could easily be a soft taco shell or flour tortilla substitute!
----------------------------------------------------
Pretty darn good. Didn't taste like our local Indian restaurant's naan, but certainly comparable. I cooked these on our foreman grill. Rather than kneading the garlic into the dough, I sateed the garlic into the melted butter and used the garlic infused butter on the grilled naan. Very tasty. We served this with Aminah A.'s Chickpea Curry...but this could really go with any meal...as a dinner roll replacement.

Great recipe!  I have never eaten naan before, so I didn't even know what it was supposed to taste like, but this recipe was so good!  Like other reviewers, I used my george foreman grill, but next time I will definately try the barbeque grill instead.  They came out pretty good on the G.F. grill, but just took SO LONG to cook! (maybe it was my grill, it's kinda old and beat up)  I was still grilling the bread one at a time, and the rest of my family was done eating!  At least on the barbeque grill, you are able to cook more than one at a time.  This recipe was great, I will be making this again for sure!

Great recipe.  I tried grilling it on a rack above the gas stove, straight on the oven rack and set at a high broil, and in the george forman.  Get the oven hot enough and that's the perfect way to do it in the middle of the winter or when you don't want to deal with a grill, though I imagine that would taste good too.  Puffed up perfectly!

This was fantasic!  I have made twice now, one with garlic and one without.  I like the one without as you can brush on garlic butter or as my son did, cinnamon and sugar.  For people that said it did not bubble, you do have to roll it very thin.  I then cooked in a large heavy pan using olive oil before cooking each one.  I refrigerated left over uncooked ones and they bubbled up even better.  Thank you so much for this fantastic bread!!

The naans were very tasty.  You may want to let the dough sit for longer in order to rise properly.

Very tasty bread. Who doesn't like warm bread of any type? It's not quite like the naan in restaurants, but it's good and the kids love it. I rolled them out a thin as possible, but they still seem too thick for naan. It's a keeper recipe anyway.

My family loved this bread!  We made this bread with traditional Indian food.  I also used this bread with chicken gyros.  Both times they were great!  The first time I made this bread, it didn't rise fast enough to use with dinner.  So I made the dough into the balls, covered them and refrigerated them overnight.   The next night, I just rolled them out and cooked them on the grill.  Will definitely make this over and over again!

I didn't grill this because it was raining.  I used a griddle instead.  I made this to take to book club because we had just finished reading the kite runner which takes place in Afghanistan and they ate naan.  I'm not very familiar with Indian food but my friends all liked it served with honey.  My husband thought it tasted like a tortilla.  Seemed very close to the naan I ate in a restaraunt not too many days after.  I think Indian food in general is just not my favorite.

This is a tasty bread but it has more of a pita texture than naan. The naan at my local Indian restaurant is a lot fluffier and soft.  This is more dense and chewy it seems.  I halved the sugar as others mentioned because even after doing so I found it a bit sweet I also didn't add the garlic but made garlic butter to brush over it. Overall it was good and does the trick in a pinch!

I'd never eaten naan before, I was skeptical when I saw how it looked after it was cooked.  But when I tasted it, it was actually very good!  I will make it again.

What a wonderful side dish to any indian recipe. This naan tastes as good as the authentic naan in my local indian restaurant. Perfect with a little garlic spread or cucumber sauce.

This was delicious bread. I had a little trouble rolling out the naan and consequently the pieces were small--however it tasted very similar to naan from a restaurant. I cooked the bread in a heavy fry pan coated with butter at a med-hi heat. They needed only about a min per side and puffed up nicely!! I will be making these again and again...

Didn't really taste like naan to me.  Don't know what I did wrong.  It wasn't bad, just wasn't naan.  More like a bread pancake.  Good for dipping in hummus, but, don't know what else I'd use it for.

I didn't add the garlic.  Since previous reviewers indicated that the naan is best fresh, I made half the dough into a loaf of bread.  Both were very good!  Thanks for sharing the recipe Mic.

My sister-in-law made this recipe for dinner one night to go with an Indian dish. My husband and I came over after the meal and finished up the rest of her "leftover" Naan bread. This is fabulous! We couldn't stop eating it!

just can't replicate restaurant naan!  it was extremely high-effort for a dough that didn't rise as stated and was very hard to roll thin enough for naan. thus, it didn't grill through too well and ended up tasting doughy.
