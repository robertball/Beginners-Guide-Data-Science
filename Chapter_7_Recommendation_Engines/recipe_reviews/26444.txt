This recipe is YUMMY!!!!  I made it on a Friday, but then my husband walked in with a pizza for supper.  So we had the pizza instead.  (I did sample the soup and it was good but a little thin and needed some additional spices.  I added some thyme and garlic powder  - much better.)  Anyways, I put the soup away to eat the next day.  On Saturday when I took it out, it was way thicker and was REALLY GOOD.  Everybody loved it.  There was one serving left over which I had for breakfast on Sunday, and I must say that Sunday was the best day for it yet.  The tate and texture were outstanding. 
One thing I might do differently next time would be to use round steak cubes rather than chuck so the meat would be more tender.  This was no fault of the recipe, I just like softer beef in my soups.  I will definitely be making this again.

Just wonderful!  I did add a bit of red wine,fresh thyme, bay leaf, minced garlic, and carrots to the beef broth.  I also browned the beef before I put everything into the crockpot.  Thank You!

Great Thick soup that was easy to prepare. Various vegies can be added to taste(carrots,celery,etc) and additional broth or reduced barley for a thinner soup. Garlic and thyme are great additions.

This recipe is so incredibly easy - my family loved it.  It's very healthy, and that's a big plus.  I added carrots and celery at the beginning, and also sliced fresh mushrooms the last hour.  Next time, I will add more barley, maybe even double it.  The taste was rather bland, so I too will add garlic, or Italian seasonings, or maybe a bay leaf or two.  Parmesan cheese really improved the taste, even without the other seasonings.  Definitely a recipe that I'm going to make many more times.

I cooked my barley according to package directions, rinsed with water and added it to the soup an hour before serving. Cooking and rinsing takes the starch out and it won't over thicken soup.Added a chopped carrot and mushrooms and total 8 cups water.
Would make again quick and easy!

Great recipe!  I love the way it thickens up and the beef is so tender.  I did add celery, carrots, onions, and garlic.  Also added a bit of red wine.  Very good and filling.

I was looking for a good beef and barley recipe and this just didn't suit me. The barley soaked up all the flavor from the tomatoes, I don't care for tomatoes but put them in anyway. It really didn't have any other flavor to me at all, the barley didn't soak up the beef flavor. Going to omit the tomatoes next time and add in some spices instead.

This is just what I was looking for.  A beef barley soup that is self-thickening and has a wonderful hearty taste that kids and adults love.  All you need is a salad and crusty french bread.  Yum!

Delicious!  I added extra onion, and stirred in some fresh spinach right before serving to increase the vegetables, and it was great.

This was amazingly easy to make, and a great recipe.  I added a couple cloves of garlic and some fresh time to give it a little extra kick.  I am new to slow-ccoker cooking, and this really opened my eyes as to how easy it can make your meals.

Loved this!  I made changes out of necessity but I'm sure the recipe is perfect as written.  It's a great jumping off point.  I had a 1 lb hunk of leftover rare roast beef (eye of round) from yesterday's dinner so I cubed that.  Then I realized I left my crock pot at a friend's so I had to make it on the stove. I finely diced and sauteed a small onion in a lil olive oil, added a tsp of garlic, then added water, bouillon, tomato sauce, beef, a bay leaf and a tiny bit of Italian seasoning (the roast I cut up was already heavily seasoned on the outside).  I used about an extra 2 cups of water and lil extra bouillon. I then partially covered and let it simmer for a couple hours and reduce a bit. Then added the barley, covered and let simmer on low for about another hour.  This is exactly what I wanted: rich, beefy, tomatoey and the barley has swelled and already started to thicken the broth.  B/c everyone says it gets better,I'm really looking forward to trying it tomorrow and the next day, b/c it's already pretty delish now.

Was actually completely surprised how wonderful this was! I did add a few veggies just out of personal preference (celery, carrots & garlic along with a little thyme).  It was very good, my mother loved it and she is quite picky about things with barley.  I used beef stew meat because that is what I had on hand and it was delicious and because it was cooked in the slow cooker it was fall apart tender.  Thanks for the recipe, I will definately make this again!

Comfort food at its finest.  You can jazz this up any way you like.  I used beef broth and not the beef boullion because that is way too much sodium for me.   I floured the beef and browned it in olive oil, then deglazed the pan with beef broth and scraped up all the fond to enrich the flavor.   As you can tell by the picture, I like it thick so I added extra barley.  I can see me making this on cold wintery nights.  This is a keeper.  Additional note:  I've made this several times and this recipe is also good with sausage.  I browned the sausage before adding it with the other ingredients.

I've made this several times already and kept meaning to leave a review. This is my husbands favorite soup and a big hit with my young boys as well. I usually double everything except the beef (I use ground beef) and that way I have tons of leftovers. The other reviewers are correct in that this does just get better with each day. I also add some carrots, celery and Italian Seasoning. It's a wonderful soup for a cold winter's day!

This recipe was incredibly delicious. 

Two recommendations:

Use 2 lbs. beef stew meat as opposed to beef chuck that you have to cube yourself.    It is incredibly difficult to cut raw meat, especially when it is a thick cut.   If there is fat swirled in the meat itself, this makes it even more difficult.    I simply used beef stew meat that was already pre-cut in the package, and this didn't take away from the wonderful flavor of the soup at all.

   
Brown the meat before putting it in the Crock Pot.

Great hardy soup so good I'm making it again after only a week only this time I'm using a crock pot instead of a stew pot. When I originally made this I substituted the 5 cups of water and 4 cubes of beef bouillon with  6 cups of Swanson's Beef Broth and 4 cups of water. (I always make double batches). This time I used 2 6 cup cans of Swanson's Beef Broth and no water. I also read some of the reviews and added garlic powder, Tyme, 2 Bay leaves and 1/4 cup of  red wine. Will sprinkle with Parmasian cheese on top and serve with fresh oven baked white bread (not breadmaker) and freshly baked homemade pumpkin pie for desert

Very good.  Used a little over 2 pounds of cubed stew meat and beef broth in lieu of water and bouillon.  As per other suggestions, added carrots, celery and a bay leaf.  Floured and browed the meat first and sprinkled with paprika and garlic powder.  Added extra broth the next day.  Will def make again.

I rarely give things a bad review but this wasn't good. If I ever made this again I'd have to do some changes - omit the tomato sauce, brown the beef chunks, use beef broth and include some seasonings. It didn't cook in 5 hours either - it took 8. The only reason I didn't give it one star is that I was able to mix it with a vegetable beef soup I'd made previously and that made it edible. Sorry : (

As is this is not bad at all. Though, I didn't have tomato sauce, so I subbed in a can of diced Italian style tomatoes. After tasting,  I just felt it needed a little more added to it to make it a perfect, complete meal. So - I added frozen mixed vegetables, a glug of red wine and some more seasonings to the crock pot.  What happened was a complete meal with plenty of flavor.  This was an excellent base to make my own version of beef barley soup.  Thank you!

This was so good.  I added potatoes, carrots, celery, parsley, concentrated beef stock and omitted the tomato sauce.  The kids loved it.  I loved it.  I WILL make this again.  It did thicken up quite a bit so today with the leftovers I will just add more broth.  Excellent starter recipe.

This is a great basic soup recipe that you can alter to suit your tastes. For example, I used beef broth instead of bouillon and water. I added garlic, carrots, celery, and a can of petite diced tomatoes (drained), as well as a splash of red wine. I also browned the meat (after dredging in flour, S&P) and veggies first before placing in the crock pot. Then deglazed the pan with some of the broth and added that to the crock pot. Tossed in some fresh rosemary from my garden. These extra steps resulted in a hearty soup with lots of Italian flavor!

I thought it was way better the next day or even the day after making it.  I seasoned and seared the meat before putting it into the crock-pot.  I seasoned the broth with a bay leaf, oregano and garlic powder.  I also kept the onion whole so that I didn't have little peices of onion but still had the flavor.  
I like thick beef barley soup.  That's why I believe it tasted better when the barley had time to soak up the broth.  I would recommend making it a day or two before you are going to eat it for a thicker, more flavorful soup.

Yum! This was surprisingly good!!! My hubs is a BIG fan of barley soup. I'm not. While I am indifferent to barley, I do not care for it enough to go out of my way to eat it on a regular basis. Because this called for a handful of basic ingredients (of which most I had available), was relatively cheap to prepare and offered a no-fuss dinner solution, I decided to give barley another shot. While I was not completely thrilled with the end result, with a little tweaking, I think this can be a HUGE success. My only criticism is that 5 hours is not NEARLY enough time to cook a cheap, tough cut of meat to "melt in your mouth" tenderness. At MINIMUM, I suggest 8 hours. As an added bonus, it's MUCH easier to remove fat from fork tender meat (I don't know about you, but I'm not a fan of fatty chunks of meat in my soup!). You can sub a leaner cut of meat, but keep in mind that you will lose some flavor when you do so (fat IS flavor). NOTES: 1) Be SURE to s&p your soup VERY well (this recipe calls for no spice whatsoever, but a GENEROUS dose of basic seasoning goes a LONG way) and 2) Garnishing with Parm is a MUST! It makes ALL the difference and is WELL worth a trip to the grocery store to pick some up. :) Crusty French bread is all you need to complete your meal. Thanks for sharing, RUSTEE! You've totally changed my opinion about a soup I would have otherwise never considered. :-)

This soup is definately easy and it tastes good...BUT if I were to make this again, I would add more spices like garlic, bay leaf, etc...needed a little spicing up and I will also next time add sliced celery and or carrots....I think I'm going to continue my search for Beef Barley Soup.

This was excellent, with some modifications.  I subbed 1/2 cup red wine for some of the water, added peas, mushrooms and garlic.  We loved it!

Based on other reviews, I added garlic, carrots and diced potatoes. Although in general it was very good and the meat was VERY tender, the flavor was still a little bland. I would make again, but probably add 1 tsp of Italian Seasoning to perk up the flavor a little.

My family enjoyed this soup recipe! We enjoyed it even better having it a few days later for dinner. I also added the two cloves of garlic and thyme, which added a nice flavor.

Excellent recipe. I added carrots and celery.  Super easy and super tasty.
Just made this recipe again tonight. I forgot how easy and good it is.  I added a whole bag of baby carrots without cutting them and they came out tender. I also added minced garlic. Salt and pepper to taste.

Made this yesterday.  It is one of the best beef barley soups I have ever had.  I was afraid the 2 lbs of meat was too much but it was perfect.  A small salad and dinner is complete!  If you have never made soup from scratch this one is a good place to start.

An excellent and super EASY soup.  Being Italian I will say it does remind me of my grandmother's version. I used canned Beef broth instead of buillion to alleviate any saltiness and omitted the water. I also threw in a crushed clove of garlic. This is a very satisfying meal on a cold winter night. I am so happy it is so easy too.

This recipe is a keeper.  Great flavor.  Freezes beautifully.  Just than and reheat in microwave (small portions) or slow cooker (large portions).  Use this recipe for freezer meals for elderly parents.  Added a splash of leftover wine, chopped celery and carrots, Italitan seasoning and gralic poweder.

Made this yesterday and yum, oh yum, but something was missing.  I shook the meat in seasoned flour & browned it in a little butter and a little olive oil. Dropped it in the crock pot with a chopped onion, some celery, garlic & carrots, beef stock, petite diced tomatoes, fennel and thyme and added baby bellas at the end.  None of us could quite put a finger on what was missing, but something definitely was.  Will be making this again and trying different variations of spices.

I dredged the meat in flour and browned it in evoo (extra virgin olive oil) before putting it in the crockpot.  This makes stew instead of soup!  You can also add veggies into the crockpot to make it more of a complete meal.  Use a nice fresh loaf of italian bread to mop up the sauce.  This way you can avoid the embarassment of licking the bowl!  Excellent dish; thanks for the recipe!

I gave this 4 stars simply because of all the adjustments I made based on the other reviews. I browned the meat first, then added red wine, sliced carrots, celery and thyme. Halfway through I added the barley and quartered mushrooms. It was very tasty and much better than the first time I made it when I just followed the recipe as given.

I made this specifically for my husband who is a beef barley soup fan.  The only changes I made were to add the barley during the last two hours of cooking so that the soup didn't get too thick.  I also added a couple cloves of garlic while it was cooking.  My husband said that this recipe is definitely a keeper - he had 3 bowls in one sitting!  Thanks for such a great recipe!

Fantastic "soup that eats like a meal" if ever there was one. I recommend adding a coup of red wine to add depth to the already wonderful flavor. Crusty bread a must on the side!

I added a can of green beans for the last hour.  Next time I will also add sliced carrots at the beginning.  This was a very enjoyable winter dinner or side dish.

This soup was a hit with my family.  I increased the beef broth the next day to make more broth and also to make more soup to eat.  My 11 yr old son had 4 bowls and was looking for more.  Easy to make and tasted great.

Very good and the meat is very tender if you let it cook the full 5 hours. But the photo shows carrots and celery, while the recipe does not. I added both, along with some snow peas, and it was a very good and warm stew-like soup. Will definitely make again!

Good basic recipe.  Easy and tasty, though I suspect it would be quite bland as-is.  I added vegetables and herbs to taste.  It did get really thick - next time I will use the suggestion of cooking and rinsing the barley, or at least add more broth.  Will make it again!

Very filling and tasty, and the whole family loved it!  I did add carrots, celery and a garlic clove at the beginning, plus increased the water to 7 cups with one extra bouillon cube.  Perfect dinner on a rainy day, served up with warm crusty bread right out of the oven.  :)

This was only okay. I know it has received a lot of positive reviews, but we found it pretty bland as written. Perhaps if you added a bunch of additional spices, but that is not what the recipe calls for. So as written, I can only give it 3 stars.

IF I COULD I WOULD GIVE IT A 10.  IT WAS DELICIOUS.  I DID CHANGE ONE THING THOUGH AND THAT WAS ONLY BECAUSE  DIDN'T HAVE
ANY TOMATO SAUCE.  I USED ABOUT 4 TABLESPOONS OF TOMATO PASTE AND ADDED A BIT EXTRA WATER.

Although this was easy to make - we did not care for it. It was too bland. Even followed some others suggestions (wine, thyme etc...) but just wasn't wild about the result.

This was a great soup and I also made some changes.  I browned the meat with a small amount of flour in olive oil and added the  leftover flour into the pot.  Also I added 1 cup of chopped carrots and one celery stalk, chopped.  I used canned tomatoes but would try the tomato sauce next time and would try different seasoning like bouquet garni.  Lastly I would use 1 cup of barley because I love barley.  I have been trying for years to find a beef barley soup that was like one my sister used to make and this is it.  The soup was better the next day.

V.G. with delicious rich broth. I cut the marbled meat into very small dice and sealed in hot oil before deglazing pan and adding to crock pot. I also added teaspoon of vinegar  to give added piquancy, and as added meat tenderizer. I used a good Bouillon base with a good beef, and lower sodium content, my choice - 'Better Than Bouillon', beef base. I cooked on high setting for one hour then simmered on low for  four. I added a little thyme, and two Bay  leaves that I removed towards the end of cooking,  before I added the vegetables.  I   cooked diced vegetables such as celery and carrots, etc., ( and added to cooker for last half hour of cooking to blend flavors. Even better the following day. I freeze in single portions, so made double batch.

I think the wrong picture is on this recipe, does not look anything like beef barley soup on the front page.  Recipe really good.

I modified this recipe by adding more tomato and vegetables,as well as paprika and a pinch of spicy blend Northwoods Fire from Penzeys. So good with the "French Bread Rolls to Die For".  Enjoyed by all.

I'm not getting why anyone would downgrade this recipe for being simple - the best recipes usually are!! Simple, basic - just plain GOOD.

I made it with lamb and it turned out really well.  I also used some of the others' suggestions and added a clove of chopped fresh garlic, a couple of bay leaves, and a cup of sliced mushrooms about 1 hour before it was done.  Even with these additions, it was a bit bland.  I eventually had to eat it with hot sauce to really bring out the flavor.

I love this soup! Added carrots & garlic. Browned meat, onion, garlic together & increased water/bouillon by 2-3 cups for additional broth. Easy & delicious!

I tried it and didn't like it much.  It wasn't very flavorful.  Too salvage it, I added a bag of frozen veggies.  I won't make this again.

THis was very good but plain.  I added a bag of frozen gumbo veggies (okra, corn, peppers, etc) and about 1/2 bag of frozen peas & carrots.  MUCH better!!  Good stuff, needs a lot of seasoning...  I will make again though!

Great recipe...I loved it!  I followed the others advise and added carrots (diced very small) and garlic.  I think this soup even tastes better after it has set in the fridge overnight.

Good, not great.  After it cooked for awhile I thought the taste could use some help.  I added some sugar because it seemed acidic.  I also add a seasoning bag of pickling spices.  I think this can really help beef based soups.  It was very simple.  Next time I'll add some veggies too.

Easy and delicious.  After reading the previous reviews, I decided to add some frozen Italian-cut green beans, frozen sliced carrots and fresh sliced mushrooms.  There was plenty of liquid and it made a hearty, satisfying soup.  A definite keeper!

This was excellent...I modified the recipe by adding 3/4 cup of red wine, some mushrooms and carrots.  I would next time add a bit more beef stock and some water.

I would suggest using 5 cups of beef stock instead of water and bullion cubes, less salt and more flavor.

So good, so simple.  Makes the house smell wonderful.  I too tweaked the recipe with wine, fresh bay leaf and thyme and baby carrots.  I warmed up a nice crusty loaf of bread and had it on a very cold night.  It was perfect.  Definitely try this out.

This is a good base recipe for beef barley soup.  I added veggies and some extra italian spices as suggested and it turned out very good!  I also decided to use beef broth instead of water and bouillon and I browned the beef cubes before cooking for extra flavor.  Before adding the spices it tasted very beefy but still great with just salt and pepper.

You know, I liked it. This was my first time making beef barely soup and while I didn't follow the recipe to a T, I did use it as a "base" recipe. I used ground beef instead of chuck roast because I had some that needed to be used up, tomato sauce, added 3 carrots, 3 celery stalks, some seasoning salt, garlic powder, pepper, and italian seasonings, I did everything in the crock pot, browned the ground beef in a skillet with some chopped onion and then added that to  the crock pot, I didn't have any beef broth so I used the 5 cups water and beef buillon next time I"m going to do broth. I also added a splash of white wine.

However, it turned out great! With the added seasonings and such, it really makes a nice hearty soup. :) I can't wait for the leftovers. I ate mine with crusty bread and a small salad.

Very tasty. A little too thick to be called soup, so next time I will do as another person suggested. Cook the barley separately and add when soup is almost done. Otherwise it was very good and easy to make. I also added carrots as they are my favorite veggie.

Mmmm!  Perfect soup on a cold rainy night.  I didn't use my crockpot since I was home all day ... just simmered on the stove for about 5 hours.  I did add the carrots and celery as others suggested, and used low sodium beef broth.  While this calls for pearl barley, which I'm guessing takes longer to cook, my grocery never has anything but quick barley, which calls for cooking less than 30 minutes, so I waited and put that in an hour before serving, just so it didn't get mushy.

This is a great, thick beef barley soup. I usually add a 1/2 bag of frozen spinach and sometimes a splash of red wine and thyme.  As we are trying to limit the amount of red meat we eat, I tried this using chicken (or vegetable) stock (no bouillon) and cooked chicken or turkey (use dry, white wine for this version).   It's healthy, hearty and great tasting!

Only used 4 cups of water, large tin of diced tomatoes instead of tomato sauce. I added four chopped carrots and two sticks of celery, 2 bay leaves, garlic and Italian seasoning. It needed to cook longer than 5 hours to get texture right, closer to 8. Very nice. I think a bit of tomato paste would have been nice, but I forgot. Also might have been nice to add some peas at the end.

I bought "stew meat" (whatever type of beef that is) and it worked perfectly.  I also added chopped spinach towards the end of the the cooking time. I've made it twice in the last month thinking I was going to freeze some for later, but we just loved it so much that there wasn't any to freeze!  Thank you for sharing this recipe!

Pretty good, just like beef stew except made with barley. I made this on a day we were hit with a snow storn so it worked out well. Just beware, it makes a ton.

I substituted the salt laden buillion with salt-free buillion. The flavor was alittlle bland but it saved over 4000 mg of sodium. I also added fresh sliced mushrooms and sliced baby carrots. Over all it was delicious!

This is a nice change from our usual standard soups.  Nice and hearty just have to watch out for the barley sticking to the bottom of the pot.  Very tastey

My husband wants me to make this all the time. He loved having the roast in the soup. I used a combination of beef stock and beef broth, instead of the bouillon.

I made this soup last night. The first thing I did was dredge the meat in flour and brown. I also sprinkled it with some garlic, salt, pepper seasoning.  Then I added everything to the crock pot.  Instead of tomato sauce I used my own canned tomatoes, some chunky carrots and celery and a handful of frozen peas. Set the crock pot on high, not low and cooked it for 5 hours.  This was the best barley soup we have ever had!!

This was excellent. We added diced carrots and celery, as well as some worcestershire sauce and we did leave it in the slow cooker longer than indicated but it was sooo good. We'll have this again soon.

excellent crock pot recipe.  Took about 5 mins to throw together and leave it, only to return after work/school to a fulfilling meal. A definite repeat recipe.

Yummy!  I made a few changes though: used 7-bone roast, beef stock instead of bouillon, 1 small can diced tomatoes and peppers, 1/2 can tomato paste instead of tomato sauce, added celery and carrots, and cooked on the stove instead of slow cooker.  Turned out GREAT!!  Even better the next day!

Great recipe ! I had the beef cut up smaller than usual by the butcher.  And I substituted beef broth for bouillon.  We prefer it this way.  Very flavorful.

With a few additions, this was great--really tasty and filling.

Because other reviewers said the soup lacked some flavor, I used a whole onion and added 2 cans of stewed tomatoes. I also added a package of fresh spinach a few minutes before serving, along with a generous amount of freshly grated pepper. I topped each serving with parmesan cheese.

The only barley I could find in my supermarket was quick-cooking barley. I wasn't sure how that would work, so I added it after the beef, onion and stock had cooked for about 2 hours. It came out great. I used a whole box (around 10 ounces?) of the quick cooking barley, and the soup was really thick and flavorful.

I loved this recipe as a base for your own creation.  I only had one pound of Angus beef so I added two medium peeled potatoes and it was great.  If you really like barley like I do this recipe uses quite a bit.  You could add any vegatables you have on hand and your favourite spices, this is a fun and basic recipe to play with.  I was short on time so cooked on low for 3 hours then high for the last hour and it was perfect.  So for a recipe with so few ingredients with such versitility I give it 4 stars.

This was delicious!  I had my doubts because it was so easy to make, but it was really good!  The parmasean cheese adds great flavor.  It took longer than 5 hours on low, I had it on low for 7 hours.

This was very good.  My cook time on low turned into 7 hours.  It was very flavorful for such few ingrediants.  I didn't think it had enough barley-will use more next time.

doubled the barley and added some carrots and mushrooms and green peppers(added the peppers in the last hour)and some minced garlic, italian seasoning, garlic powder, It made it more of a stew rather than soup which is what I was aiming for.

Just an ok meal at best. Looking at the ingredients I wondered what made it Italian. The family found this overall to have a good texture and it was filling. Everyone asked me to find a new recipe. However this recipe works if you add the trademark seasonings (oregano, parsley, thyme etc).  This also helps tone down the canned tomato taste.

This is pretty much the best soup I've ever had and it's extraordinarily easy to make.  I added perhaps a bit too much salt and an extra bouillon cube by mistake, so be warned, but the addition of a good amount of red ground pepper flakes really made it quite something. I added a wee bit of extra barley.

Why are you reading this instead of making this soup?  With a pretty low unit cost, good nutritional value, and great taste it's pretty much perfect.

Need about 8 cups of water or 4 cups beef broth and 4 cups water, and at least 3 carrots chopped to 1/4 inch dice.  Also a couple teaspoons of worcestershire sauce is amenable!  Also would add a cup of celery, chopped, or a 1/2 teaspoon celery salt.

So good and so easy!  The only changes I made (as many others commented on) was to add carrots & celery & 1tbsp Italian seasoning. It was really good, we all liked it. It was the perfect choice of recipe to set up early, watch an afternoon football game without worrying about supper, then serve when ready. We'll have this again.

My picky family loved this.  I fried the meat before I put it in the slow cooker and then used some of the water to clean the frying pan.  It gave it a nice flavour.

This was awesome!  I made the recipe exactly as stated except I used low sodium beef broth in place of water and bouillon.  I wasn't sure about the tomato sauce but added it and you really couldn't taste tomato, just good flavor.  Thanks!

This was absolutely fabulous. I tweeked it a little bit by adding celery and carrots. I also added a little more tomato sauce, Italian seasoning, black pepper and salt. We loved this soup.

So easy to prepare.  Great comfort food!!  The beef fell apart and the flavors combined for a very hearty soup.  Serve it with a warm loaf of bread and you have a delicious meal.

This recipe is a great base, but in following other reviews added finely diced carrot, red wine, grated zucchini, garlic and a big red onion (for a sweeter flavour) this was a big hit.

Beef barley soup is one of my all time favorites and this one was simple and delicious.  I will definitely be making this one again.  I couldn’t wait to dive into it when I came home from work, the house smelled wonderful!  Thanks for sharing the recipe with us.

Absolutely delicious!  Very tasty as is - I don't understand the underseasoned hulabaloo.  That being said this could be more substantial if you up the vegetable ante.

I had a dinner party and this was a hit! A number of people asked for the recipe. I added 1/2 teaspoon of spicy Mrs. Dash to it and it was supurb. It was easy and even my kids enjoyed it. The leftover were highly sought after the next day.

Great quick and easy recipe.  I usually use stewed or diced tomatoes instead of the sauce and about 1/2 hr before it will be done I add some frozen mixed vegetables.

This was wonderful.  I used a 15 ounce can of tomatoe sauce because that's all I had and didn't want to waste it.  I also added a few cloves of chopped garlic.  Otherwise didn't change a thing and it was delicious.  Definitely a keeper.  THANKS MOM!!!

This was a great soup for a cold winter night.  I browned the beef before adding it to the crockpot, and added 1/2 teaspoon of garlic powder (equivalent to 4 cloves).  I might try adding some veggies next time, but it was simple to make and really, really tasty.  I served it to my in-laws with a green salad and some crusty bread - it was a huge hit!

I have no idea how a previous reviewer could possibly add more barley... our soup turned out more like a grain side dish.  Too much barley, not enough liquid.  Needs more vegetables, something! (update:  I defrosted leftovers, added a couple cans of low sodium beef broth, chopped onions, celery and carrots, and it was better)

Best beef stew ever! This is the only way I will make beef stew again. Easy, affordable,  great compliments. Ordinary I do not change recipes trying first time, however I did have some carrots that needed to be used , so I put them in as well.
Throwing away all my other recipes for beef stew. This is the only one I need.

I made this 062019. I used a quart of beef bone broth with one cup water plus  the bouillon cubes.  I was afraid it would be salty but it was not.  I did add pepper but NO salt.  I used chuck roast which was a bear to cut up removing as many large gristle and fat areas as possible.  (Grand daughter is fussy!)  I did use the slow cooker which made the meat tender as can be.  First I braised the meat and onions (this slow cooker has this function) then I cooked it on high for 2-3 hrs.  It was done and creamy as could be.  Salt and pepper can be added at the table and I figured the bouillon had salt in it.  It was tasty, filling and well received!  I did forget to offer the cheese but served with salad and small croissants. I'll make it again for sure.  PS I did toss in baby carrots (we are a veggie family); it added color and bit of taste.  Maybe try a touch of garlic next time. (I just noticed the chunks of tomato in the photo with the recipe... I used sauce only as recipe calls for and it was good)

This is a really great recipe! 
It is delicious and very easy to make! 
Why eat canned soup when you can make this delicious and easy soup!!!
I used a 1/2 can of tomato paste instead( they are very small cans)  I rather not have or see  chunks of tomato in the soup.
I also used beef with a bone in it and I also put a  beef roast in it as well.

I used low sodium Beef broth instead of the bullion and water. I also added a few generous dashes of Worcester sauce.  I added carrots, celery and baby bella mushrooms.  I browned the beef in garlic, salt, pepper and some olive oil before putting it into the slow cooker.  Thickened up nicely and tastes GREAT!!!

I, as others, used this as a start. I did use beef broth instead of bouillon,  added thyme  and omitted the tomato. I added a bag of Fiesta vegetables and made it in the slow cooker and it was very good. Can't wait until tomorrow and see if everyone is right about it being better on day two.

Absolutely Delicious!!  I doubled the batch so simmered on the stove.  The only substitute was using store bought beef stock.

Very very good. I added red wine as someone suggested and some balsamic vinegar and I think it really made the soup. I also stirred in some kale for the last 30 minutes or so. Added barley gradually. I cooked on low for 10 hours because I started with nearly frozen meat.

No changes other than I might have put in a bit too much barley.  It was thick like stew and oh so yummie.  Would definitely make again.  Served with warm tea biscuits.  Real comfort food.

I made this dish according to the directions and it turned out delicious ....was a hit with the whole family .  However I found that the measurement  called for  in regards to the barley was a little too much. If you prefer a thin based soup I would recommend half that amount.  Other wise  3/4 cup is  fine for a thicker broth.   Definitely recommend this recipe  and will be making it again !

So easy and tasty! I added a bit more barley, and next time I will try it with more veggies. Also, beef stew meat will make it even easier, as it is pre-cut. Will definitely make this again.

This soup is very tasty after you add carrots, celery and a small can of tomatoes. Yes, it has a thin broth but if you were to add more barley I am sure that would make it get thicker. This recipe is in my favorites.

Me beef cubes were frozen, so I added an hour to cooking.  Wrong !  The "soup was very thick", but delicious according to my tastebuds, although my girlfriend did tell me not to make it again for her alone.  All in all, very tasty.

Like so many others, I made some changes to suit my tastes. I used a 28oz can of crushed tomatoes w/basil and a 6oz can of tomato paste, then I used 1-1/2 T. beef base and 1 t. chicken base. Therefore I didn't add any extra salt. I my local market had a deal on top round so I used that in place of the chuck steak. I also added 1 t. granulated garlic and used dried 1/2 C. dried onion flakes.  Because I used dried product, I used 6 C. water instead of the 5 called for. So basically I didn't make this dish, but something similar. Very good!!

I did what it called for but I also added two cut up tomatoes. It was soooooo YUMMY, I will  defiantly make it again. I made it in my pressure cooker ,we couldn't wait to try it. I browned the meat first , then through everything in that it  called for plus the tomatoes. and it took thirty minutes. Try it you will love it!!

This was very good. The only negative thing is that it was a tad salty. Next time I will use low sodium bouillon cubes.

We added a can of Campbell's beef consomme and a cup of frozen peas and carrots.  The wife used sirloin tip steak meat and OMG, after 5 hrs in the crock pot it was fabulous.  A fresh loaf of crusty french bread, fresh butter and this soup was a meal.  It was even better the second day.  Please do yourself a favor and try this recipe, it will become a favorite.

i used low-sodium chicken broth and low sodium tomato juice, added some diced carrots, celery, tomatoes and it was perfect.   i browned the meat before i put it in the crockpot so there woud be less fat.  It was ready when we got home from work, exactly the time we are too tired and too lazy to make anything for dinner.  The meat was very tender and very tasty.  we plan on having it again.

Will make again as it is truly easy and very tasty but will go easier on the barley next time and add a few vegetables like carrots and green beans. Following the recipes made it  too thick in my mind (and I like thick soups).

Excellent soup.  I added heaping tsp. thyme, 1/2 tsp. garlic powder and used 3/4 cup quinoa instead of barley.....only because that's what I had on hand.  The quinoa thickened the soup up nicley.  Also, I floured, salt/pepper the chuck roast pieces and browned in the cast iron skillet before putting in the slower cooker.

While this is a nice soup recipe it could use a few additional ingredients. Garlic, a little red wine,  beef stock instead of water. I used homemade. Added a little prosciutto thinly sliced and a few spicy meatballs.

I forgot to note, I wanted my soup a bit less thick, to soak into the bread I made, so I added an extra cup of water. I also browned beef stew meat before adding into the pot, following the suggestions of others. Yum!

This was an extremely bland and boring soup, I used beef stock, instead of water and bullion . Added cooked barley at end....used carrots, celery, parsnip, onions and garlic. Also added can of  chopped tomatoes with basil.

Surprisingly good.  Husband really liked it.  Recipe needs a little bit of "tweaking", though.  I added quite a bit of fresh ground pepper and sea salt, as well as a tsp. or two of dried thyme and some sliced carrots.  What a difference!  You cannot beat the ease of making this dish and it was even better the next day.

Very tasty,and EASY! As others have said, great base recipe.I made it the first time as written, then on the second go round, put in celery, carrots, Italian spice, garlic, left everything else the same. It was super good, and cooked perfectly in five hours.

Made this recipe but used homemade chicken broth instead of boullion cubes and added cabbage, carrots, basil and garlic. I cooked the barley and added it  during the last half hour...couldn't be better.

This is delicious and hearty as written and very versatile in terms of what can be added to it, such as fresh mushrooms or mixed vegetables. Fast and easy too. It's a favorite of ours and one I often take to gatherings where it is always complimented.

This recipe is the bomb, i change it a little by doubling the tomato sauce, doing this gives it a nice rich color and taste but does not change flavor. I also added a diced garlic and twice as much barley.  I cooked it on a pressure cooker and it all came down to a rich, meaty, flavorful meal that you will love.
Tip:
For the meat get beef neck meat i simply asked for it this way (1 lb) and be sure they make small cubes with this meat, why? well the consistency will be better by having chunks of beef and small pieces it will make a great meal.

This was amazing. Was so simple to make. Be sure to get nice big cubes of meat from the grocery store. I cooked it 7 hours instead of 5. I think next time I am going to add mushrooms maybe.

Loved the concept and ease of this recipe (beef was nice and tender and the barley just right), but although it was tasty enough as written, it seemed more like a base to me. Next time I will add carrots and celery for a heartier, healthier meal. I will also be sure to measure the bouillon more carefully. I used powder instead of cubes and my "rounded teaspoons" were a bit too rounded making mine too salty. All in all a good recipe definitely on the right track.

I followed some suggestions from other reviewers and added thyme and garlic. I also put in a stalk of celery and a large carrot, both diced. I thought that the broth was the perfect thickness, and it was very tasty!

Great, easy recipe!  Added red wine, celery, carrots and garlic.  It was a thick and hearty soup that I made for the very first time.  My finicky husband loved it.  Easy, delicous comfort food!

This is a staple in our house!  I don't put in the onions, as the kids would not do well with that.  But, all kids, ages 8,4, &2 LOVE this soup!

Great, my wife doesn't like soups or stews and she ate a bit. My tough 9 year old ate it up. Will make again.

I thought it was a little bland and had way too much barley.  However, it just needs a little extra seasoning.

What a great soup!  It's very easy and quick to make.  My whole family loved it.  I used a cup of "Homemade Tomato Sauce II", which I had on hand.

This recipe is absolutely delicious as is.  The next time I will triple it, however so there will be plenty in the freezer for leftovers.  Thanks Elaine for a real keeper.  I will be making this often.

I ended up having to add much more liquid than the recipe called for so that it would look like a soup. Next time I will use low sodium beef broth as it was a bit salty but good everall. My family will be requesting this again.
