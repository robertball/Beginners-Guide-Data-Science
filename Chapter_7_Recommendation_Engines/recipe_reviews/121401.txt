made these for the first time ever. will certainly make again. i made fresh breadcrumbs from 2 slice of texas toast style whole wheat bread. i used 2 huge cloves of garlic. and i added a bit of garlic powder to the sauce. i cut back on some of the vinegar as other reviewers suggested. i used a quarter of a cup. i only had a store brand canned pineapple and it wasn't as sweet as the name brand. next time i'll try the name brand. and i couldn't help but wonder why chicken broth and not beef broth is called for. i'll try beef broth as well next time. i also used half green and half red pepper. i like the sweetness of the red pepper. we all loved this dish and it's a definite keeper! thanks joyce penney:)

I came to all recipes wanting a sweet-and-sour meatball recipe and this is the only one to pop up and I was nervous since it had no rating and I'm really glad I tried it. It was awesome and very simple to make. I followed the recipe step by step. I will definitely be making this again in the future.

This turned out delicious! I didn't use the whole can of pineapple chunks; the taste was still outstanding. In addition to cooking the meatballs in an oiled pan, I also baked them for extra crunchiness. Served with spiced rice, this recipe will go in my books!

I made a TRIPLE batch of this yummy dish.  Some items were simply tripled. But, I reduced the vinager instead of putting 1 1/2 cups, I just put 1 cup in it.  Then I increased the chicken broth to not 3 but 4 cups.  I also increased the pinapple juice to not 1 1/2 cups but 2 cups.  and the last adjustment I made was I had 3 large green peppers and one large red pepper.
it was fantastic.  I was serving 20 people, and some are very picky about sweet & sour, not liking the strong vinager taste.  This pleased them all and even the most picky had second helpings.

OPPS, I forgot to mention, I didn't use this recipe for the meatballs,  instead I used a meatloaf recipe, it has italian sausage, and that also uses dry hot wheat cereal and not bread crumbs.  the wheat cereal soaks in much more moisture, making the meatballs far yummier.  one thing for sure, after trying many different meatloaf meatball recipes, i'm only making them with the wheat cereal from now on.

Absolutely fantastic!
When I told my husband what I was making, he gave me an "okaaaay" kind of look, and could tell he was kind of nervous about it. 
As I was making it, he kept commenting on how great it smelled. And obviously it tasted even better, because in a matter of minutes it was all gone. I hadn't realized I'd be feeding my nephews and niece when I started making it, otherwise I would have made more.
I used italian bread crumbs, since that's what I had and it was great.
I use organic coconut oil a lot, so next time, I think I'm going to try it with that.
This is wonderful, I can't wait to make it again :)

This is a good recipe!  Even my picky 8 year old devoured all the pineapple and meatballs.  I think next time I will use a little less apple cider vinegar though, it was a bit much for me. Overall, a great recipe and makes enough for leftovers the next day! :)

Sorry to be in the minority here, but my family just did not like these meatballs.  The only thing I changed was to add a dash of catsup and soy sauce to the actual meatball for added flavor, and I cut back on the sugar, pineapple juice and cider vinegar just because I was nervous about that part.   Just too sweet and vinegary for a main dish.

Devoured by both Husband and daughter. Did do as suggest in other reviewers and halved the amount of vinegar. Did use fresh pineapple instead of canned.

Awesome, I made it just like the recipe says.  Next time however I think I will reduce the Vinegar just a little.  Also I usually make it with brown sugar but I couldn't remember the amount to use in place of the regular sugar.  Next time I will just experiment.

This was great. Just like my grandma used to make and I couldn't find her recipe anywheres. I did double the amount of sauce since it goes so great with the rice. Next time I wouldn't make quite so much sauce. I also added some chopped green onions to the meatball mix and I used my electric frying pan to make this. Really great recipe!!

Awesome! I love this recipe! Just some tweaks, I made my own meatballs from a different recipe and added less sugar too. The pineapple juice already made it sweet.

Delicious!  All 3 kids loved it and barely said a word all through dinner.  I did use beef broth because that is what I had on hand and reduced the vinegar to 1/4 cup as suggested.  I think that is the perfect amount.  Sadly, I did not have any green pepper but I was the only one who missed it.  It did seem that the meat/bread crumb mixture was rather dry compared to other meatball recipes but this is probably why the meatballs browned so well.  This will go into our regular rotation.

Easy to make and a real treat for dinner.  Had to tweak the recipe a bit, as I did not have all of the ingredients, but it still turned out well!

I didn't really care for this. It was fine, just not yummy. My hard to please husband and 2 boys (ages 3 and 5) really liked it however. Easy to make!

WOW!!  We just got done eating this for dinner and it was fantastic!  My husband and two year old loved it as well.  So easy to make!  I did add a few items...I added some dry bread crumbs to the meat and mixed red bell pepper and onions wirh the green pepper.  You've gotta try this one!
