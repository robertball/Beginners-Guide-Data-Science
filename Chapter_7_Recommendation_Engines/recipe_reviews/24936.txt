Thanks for a wonderful recipe.  I have made it twice for work.  
This last time people could not stop raving about how good it was.  It was so
easy to mix up and pop in the oven, it practically makes itself.  Great use of the
overstock of raisins I had.  I ran out of applesauce, so I ran some apple pie
filling through the blender and it worked just as well.

This bread was great. It was quick and easy. I was concered that the bread would turn out crumbly because of other reviews. I planed on using two eggs, but forgot and only used one. I am glad I forgot. The bread did not need it. It was not crumbly at all. I did increase the cinnamon to 1 tsp. I also used brown sugar instead of white sugar.

Got several compliments with this bread, tho I changed it a little.  Used Craisins (sweetened, dried cranberries) in place of raisins.  Only had sweetened applesauce on hand, so cut the sugar a bit, though the final product could have used the extra sugar, in my opinion.  Good bread; very dense and a little crumbly.

A great bread in a short time. A slice of this hearty bread and some yogurt makes a quick, healthy breakfast. I do believe I'm addicted to this bread.

After all the great reviews, I thought I would give this a try. Sadly, it was dry as another described even tough I pulled it from te oven early. I should have paid closer attention to the fat replacement using applesauce. It definitely needed s ome more fat content to add moisture without gumminess. Will not make again though the potential is there with some changes.

I increased the cinnamon to 1 tsp and added another egg to bind the ingredients so the bread wouldn't crumble, and it held together very nicely.  Just the right amount of sugar as I'm not fond of very sweet things.  Thanks for the very nice recipe.

This was good, and definitely easy.  It came in handy when some relatives dropped by with little notice and I needed something for them to eat for breakfast.  I agree with other reviewers that it didn't hold together well and was rather crumbly.  I left out the nuts and added extra raisins.  I drizzled a thin cream cheese frosting/glaze over it for a little extra sweetness.  If I make this again I will probably put a streusel topping on it to make it more like a coffee cake.

This bread was great! My boyfriend took it to work with him and everyone loved it. They all said it was awesome! I even made it with fat free butter, but I don't think they knew that.

I made this recipe a few days ago and wanted to say that my husband really liked it, especially since it had raisins in it. Personally I would have liked it to be a little sweeter but that's just me. Also I have an electric oven and I had to baked it 10 minutes longer. All in all, very tasty!

I should read reviews before I made this bread. My oven bakes really good, but after 45 minutes in the oven, dough was still raw. I had to put it back in for another 15 minutes. And that's when it became dry. I also added sprinkle of salt.

I made it yesterday.  I changed the walnuts to 3/4 cup chopped pecans, used 1/3 sugar and 1/3 brown sugar, increased recipe to  1 tsp cinnamon and added 1/4 tsp nutmeg. I loved all of the flavors, but it's still a bit dense for me.  Kept it to one egg, but maybe cut back to 3/4 cup applesauce and 1/4 cup vegetable oil to make it a little lighter.

Easy and delicious! First time I made it I had to bake it for about 20 extra mins. Second time, I used 3/4 cup of applesauce and only had to bake an extra 12 mins. Both ways came out great!

easy to make, if a little dry for some tastes, just spread a little whipped cream cheese and really yummy - also tried using dried cranberries and just as delish!

Great bread! I love the texture & taste. I sliced & put together the little cream cheese filled sandwiches for a church luncheon made with this bread & I didn't have enough.  It wanted to crumble a little but with the cream cheese as glue it solved that.  Thanks for the great recipe.

great tasting, except it was slightly crumbly and didn't hold together as well as I'd like.  I changed the recipe:  for sugar I used half white and half brown, I added less walnuts and more raisins, and I threw it all in the bread machine on the 'cake bread' setting.
