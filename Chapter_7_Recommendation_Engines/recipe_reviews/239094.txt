This is a really good smoothie and i liked it a lot, though i think i could've made it sweeter. I might make it again but i do want to make a lot of other things on Allrecipes so maybe not, but you know what they say "you gotta catch em' all" or in this case, cook it all. thanks for the recipe, bye.

I made a half recipe and it made 2 full 12 oz. glasses; so a half recipe really serves 2. I used what I had on hand so the recipe was slightly changed--1 c. of milk, 2 fresh peaches quartered, a whole frozen banana cut into chunks, about 3 oz. of vanilla yogurt, and added 1 tsp. of honey; skipped the chocolate sauce.  Tasty, but I think will make slightly sweeter next time.  Might try with chocolate also.

Used cashew milk, a full 6-oz container of strawberry yogurt (instead of 3-1/2 oz), and just skipped the optional chocolate sauce.  I added a little crushed ice, since I like my smoothies with a thicker texture, but that's just a personal preference.  Nice breakfast smoothie, not too sweet, and a good way to start the day!
