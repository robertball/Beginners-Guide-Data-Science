I shouldn't rate this so high since I changed the recipe up so much but since it was the basis I think it deserves 5 stars.  Most of my changes came from other reviews: liberal with the amount of pumpkin; reduce eggs to only 3; reduce sugar to under 1 cup; use spice cake mix; blend cake mix, nuts & melted butter all together in crumb mixture and then crumble over pumpkin mix; cover with foil for 45 min. then remove foil for last 20-25.
Phew! That's a lot of changes! But totally worth it. I'm already looking forward to sneaking some for breakfast.

This is very good and a quick recipe.  My family really liked this one.  I did use a white cake mix when I was out of the yellow and it worked just as good. I have frozen part of it before and when it was thawed we both thought the flavor was even better than when first made. Personally it seems to have a better taste at room temp. or from the fridge.

This absolutely is a favorite dessert of our family. I use my own homemade pumpkin pie spice, add a pinch of salt instead of a whole teaspoon and butter instead of margerine. Excellent as is but over the top yummy with whipped topping or french vanilla ice cream. This dosen't last any longer than past dessert at family gatherings--two days if I've made it for the four of us.

Wonderful recipe! I have made it with homemade butternut squash puree as well as sweetpotato puree as well and both could easily be passed off as pumpkin! I upped the quantity of puree (no matter what I used) to two cans (30 oz. total) and bumped the sugar down to 1 c. Rather than top with the whipped topping, I thouroughly coated the top with about 2 c. finely chopped pecans (my grampa grows pecans so I have endless access to them). Another favorite recipe that I will be making again and again...

A whole 18.25 oz. of cake mix was much too much. I reccomend using less. Also, it is important to note that the recipe says to drizzle butter on top, but it never notes that the entire surface needs to be covered in order for there not to be dry mix left on top. So make sure that after drizzling, you spread the butter completely over the surface or else you'll have some very chalky, dry pieces. Even though I encountered these issues, the cake tasted great. The recipe just needs a few tweeks...

Sorry but I'll have to be in the minority here and rate it low.  I made it to the T and baked for 1 hr. exactly.  There are so many eggs in this that the pumpkin part had the texture of pumpkin scrambled eggs and was a bit watery.  Not smooth and creamy at all and would NOT be a good substitute for a good pumpkin pie.  The cake topping was dry and too thick.  I say 2/3 a box would have been fine.  And this cake was tooth aching sweet.  1 cup sugar would've been plenty, especially since the cake mix is already too sweet.  1 hr. gave me a very brown cake topping, on the verge of dark brown at the corners.  I'd say reduce this to 3 eggs at most, use 2/3 of cake mix and reduce the sugar!  But for me, I will not be making this again.  Definitely had 'from the box' taste.

This was great. Only used 3/4c of sugar and it was plenty sweet for our taste, only half the box of cake mix and I really think anymore would have been way too much, and about 1/3c of butter instead of 1c once it was cooked the butter had spread over the surface so there weren't any dry cake mix spots that some other reviewers have noted. Thanks for a new fall treat.

I remember making this recipe way back when this site was Thanksgivingrecipe.com but I never had a chance to evaluate until now. It’s an easy recipe with delicious and rich results! For the pumpkin puree, I used one whole 30 ounce can, more than 2 cups. I patted down a whole 18.25 oz. box of yellow cake mix over the top of the pumpkin mixture. I used all butter instead of margarine thou I didn’t think that there was enough to cover the pecans and cake mix.  I just loved the sweet smell of pecans, pumpkin and butter filling up my house- oh my goodness! I noticed in 55 minutes baking time that the edges were turning dark brown so I covered the entire cake with foil and let it finish baking. The cake was done in one hour and 15 minutes. I let cool it for a while before putting it in the fridge to set. I made a whipped topping, “Whipped Cream,” also from this site, and dolloped it on the cake. The pumpkin filling was very good, moist, spiced just right and tasty. The crumb topping (pecans and cake mix) had a nice crunch and was buttery and sweet. I do think that it was a bit too heavy on the butter, sugar and cake mix for my tastes. Next time I may just cut back on the amount of cake mix, butter and sugar. However, this was a huge hit with my family; and hubs and his coworkers devoured it-happily wiping it out in mere minutes. All I heard was, "Mmm..MMmm." Considering that I had to give this a 5 stars- turned out good for a “cake mix”.

This recipe is super easy and is a good, quick fall dessert. I am basing my star rating on whether I would serve this on Thanksgiving or not. I too think the recipe calls for too much cake mix. I found mounds of dusty cake mix after it came out of the oven. So that someone wouldnt take a bite and choke themselves, I solved the problem by melting Kraft caramel squares and drizziling on top. Overall, the cake was a hit for Sunday dinner. I would make it again for small family dinners but not for my big Thanksgiving "to impress" dessert. One last note: I felt it was best at room temp or cold.

I discovered this recipe a few years back. I didn't have time to make traditional pumpkin pies the first Thanksgiving after my Mom passed away.  I made this for our family dinner and felt guilty that I didn't make Mom's pies for my Dad.  To my delight my snooty Dad loved it and we have it for every Thanksgiving now.

I've made this quite a few years now and it's delicious and requested by a few of my relatives.  I actually add crumb topping on top of the cake(from a crumbcake recipe I have) and call it Pumpkin Crumb Crunch Cake.

Made this recipe just as it is written. Was a big hit with everyone. I was testing it out before Thanksgiving to be sure we liked it before we served it to everyone. Needless to say, I will be making one to take with us on Thanksgiving.

It was easy to make and pretty good taste but not for everyone. I loved the bottom part but the top part was a little much. Probably wouldn't make again with so many other pumpkin recipes out there

This cake was a challenge for me because I am new to baking but the results were good. I pretty much followed the recipe except that I forgot to drizzle the melted butter. I did this at the end and baked it for an extra 5 minutes or so. The texture was a little funky for a cake but all the flavor was there. I will bake this cake again with a few minor changes but all in all a very good recipe.

There are a number of variations of this recipe on this website.  This one is FIVE stars!!  So easy to whip up.  I made this for Hubs to take to his fishing club and share with the guys and one of them even asked for the recipe!  The only negative I found with this recipe is the baking time.  I’d say 45-50 minutes max!  I baked mine for about 55 minutes, which was too long and the edges of the cake were a bit hard.  Regardless the fishing guys polished off the whole thing!

This was wonderful!!  I made it for a Bible study and everyone that tried it liked it.   Some even said that it is better than pumpkin pie.   It's good leftover, cold and hot.  The only thing I did differently was I only used half the butter it called for.  It still turned out great!

Great recipe. As per other reviews I reduced the number of eggs to 3, made my own pumpkin spice mix with cinnamon, ginger, fresh nutmeg and cloves and used a large 30 oz. can of pumpkin.  

I also toasted the pecans before I combined them with the cake mix and butter and added some light brown sugar. Next time I may even reduce the amount of butter. Too much makes it more like batter and not a crumble topping.  
Top the cool whip with salted Carmel sauce, serve the cake cold (holds together better) and you have a keeper for sure!!

A Thanksgiving hit!  Only changes I made was not using all the cake mix (probably used 2/3) and using real butter.

This is our favorite dessert not only for Thanksgiving, but "just beacuase it's fall!" My husband has me make this for his birthday cake every November. It is so easy to make and it gives just a little extra to a plain, old pumpkin pie. LOVE, LOVE, LOVE!

This is wonderful.  I didn't have any pumpkin pie spice so I used cinnamon, cloves, and ginger.  I let it sit for a couple of hours but it still fell apart when I tried to serve it, we all still at it though!!  But once I put it in the fridge it set up just like pumpkin pie texture.  I will definately be making this more often.  Just beware, this is very addictive.  Make it when there are a bunch of people to help you eat it.  :)

Fabulous and easy!  I used fresh pumpkin puree...used another reviewer's (VickiW) recipe for spices and it was so good!  Warm or cold, this was eaten so quickly!  If you want something different from the traditional pumpkin pie, try this!

This "cake"/pie, is delicious! More like a pumpkin crunch souffle would be the better description of this dish. Travels well, and delicious served with whipped cream, either hot or cold!

This is an awesome dessert, which I was introduced to this month at our card club.  I made it for my son and I two days later and he loved it!  I used 3 egss and the equivalent of 4 teaspoons of pumpkin pie spice.  This recipe is so easy and tastes so good with Cool Whip.  I imagine that it would be extraordinary with vanilla ice cream!  My new favorite dessert.

So easy - had the hubby make it while I tended to another task.  Made it the night before and brought to the Thanksgiving dinner.  Everyone absolutely LOVED it! Wish I made two!  
Making another one for a friendsgiving party tomorrow! Too good not to enjoy again!  This will become a tradition going Forward!

Everyone loves this dessert! And it's even better next day with vanilla ice cream on top. Only change I make is I only use half a cake mix since we all found the original recipe too sweet. Much better that way. Yummy pumpkin flavor really comes through.

This is one of my son's favorite desserts.  It is so easy to put together and tastes wonderful.  I make half the pan with the pecans and the other half without the pecans.  I keep cans of pumpkin on-hand to make this treat throughout the year.

This is delicious!!! I did stir the cake mix into the pumpkin mixture a bit to moisten it up, then poured the melted butter on top. Will be making this again!

this cake is amazing. the crunch is great and the flavor of the cake makes it taste like a pumpkin upside down cake mixed with a pecan pie. I only gave it 4 stars because if you want more of a pumpkin pie consistency you will want to refrigerate it for a couple hours. all in all great cake i just think it tastes so much better cold.

Awesome!  And so easy to make.  A coworker asked for the recipe and said "It is absolutely wonderful; like a pecan pie sitting on top of a pumpkin pie."  What a great way to describe this yummy treat!

Tasted great, looked wonderful.  Family loved it, but the pumpkin base was a little too soft for me.  I did have to bake it for 1 hr 20 mins. But everyone else thought it was great! Thank you.

Awesome!!  Moist, crunchy, seasoned perfectly! Wonder how a carrot or a spice cake mix would taste.  I may try that next. Also wonder how it would turn out as cupcakes.  Oh my, I have a lot of baking to do!!!

I made this for a team meeting at work and for a night with the girls and it got rave reviews.  Many requests for the recipe.  It is super easy.  I added just a little more cinnamon and also added some ginger.  I like a little more spice with my pumpkin.  Thanks for the recipe.

An absolute HIT with my youth group...and my parents!  Mom, whose loathe against anything containing a cake mix, is a convert!  And Dad, who's a pecan-a-holic, requested this 'cheater' recipe instead of the traditional punkin pie last Thanksgiving.  What a feather in my cap!  =)  Thanks, Nora!!

This is well worth the 2 sticks of butter!!! I was a little worried when I was making this that the pumpkin would be too runny, but it turned out perfect!! This will be a great Thanksgiving desert...

This is the best new dessert recipe I've found in many years. It must be served warm to be appreciated, with a whipped topping. The blend of pecans and pumpkin is decadent.
Servings says 6, however I think 15 is a lot closer to the truth. This would change the calorie content to around 400.

This was very very good!  I even lost my internet connection and ended up making it incorrectly and it STILL came out wonderful! (I put the melted margerine in with the pumpkin filling instead of drizzling it on top) The result was very much like a pumpkin cobbler.  I don't recommend doing it the way I did, as I think the top of it will come out much more crunchy with the margerine drizzled. A very nice pumpkin pie taste in a non-traditional presentation.  This is a must try for the holidays.
