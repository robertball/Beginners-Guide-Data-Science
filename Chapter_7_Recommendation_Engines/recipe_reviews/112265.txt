This was a great vegetable dish. Thanks for sharing the recipe.  I made this dish for Christmas dinner. I prepared it up to but not including the baking of it, froze it and thawed it Christmas eve. I popped it into the oven for an hour when the turkey was finished and resting prior to carving. It was light and tasty. The whole family, all 15 of us, enjoyed it, even the one year old! It will be featured in our family recipe collection and I will certainly make it again.

This can excite a non=turnip eater to possibly enjoy them!  I used spelt flour instead of all purpose flour, and half the amount of honey instead of sugar, with just cinnamon sprinkled on top.  Great both hot or cold!  Thanks for the recipe!

This was just ok for me. I didn't care for the cinnamon topping and even with the addition of the eggs, the casserole was not firm enough for me.

This is a great use of turnip !  As I usually do, I added  an apple,onion & garlic ( sateed in butter .)

It added a depth to the dish that turned out great !

I really like this; my grandma would make something like this but it wasn't a sweet version. So I used this as a base. Instead of adding sugar I added dill and a pinch of cinnamon. I also did not make a topping to it. It turned out a nice savory version of this

The only difference I made in this recipe is that I left the sugar out of the topping, though I did sprinkle the casserole with cinnamon. My family all had different opinions about the level of sweetness. My kids thought it was just right, I thought it could be slightly less sweet, and my husband thought it should be more sweet.   I will make it again, though I may play around with the amount of sugar.  It's nice to get another Finnish recipe to add to my collection, as I am of Finnish descent. Thanks for sharing!

This dish was excellent. Just the right amount of sugar enhanced this dish. I was worried that it would be too sweet, but it was the perfect amount. Glad to find another dish that incorporates turnips, a very underrated vegetable.

This is a really good recipe. I did not have any turnips, but I had parsnips so I used that instead. Only other change was to reduce the amount of sugar on top to 1 Tbsp.

Great added extra carrot and topped with sugar cinnamon. Made day before and partially cooked then

Made again with gluten free flour and oats and used cocanur oil instead of butter to make vegan. Topped with cinnamon

Easy to make and so delicious. We will have this one again and again. I did cut back on the sugar by a few tablespoons and no cinnamon.

Doesn't look like much but when I serve it people can't get enough of it.  A big winner in our house and a great way to use turnips. Quick, easy and delicious.

I was skeptical of anything called Turnip Casserole, but I tried this for a Scandinavian cuisine night, and it was a big hit with kids and adults alike! I followed the recipe exactly, and it tasted not so much like carrots or turnips, but a bit like pumpkin pie, and a bit like breakfast pudding/bread pudding, because of the slight eggy taste. I would do a little less cinnamon & sugar on top. I will keep this to make again!

This was a little funky for us. Couldn't help but feel like I was eating very scrambled eggs with carrots. The texture was a little off-putting. I feel bad but not my favourite recipe. Sorry.
