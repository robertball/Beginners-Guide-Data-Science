Oh yeah! I love these and they're really easy to make at home. I decided to bake them instead of fry them so they didn't taste just like Hooters but they were still great and much better for you. I followed the instructions exact except I baked on a rack set over a jelly roll pan at 350 for 45 minutes. Then I turned the oven to 375 and sprayed the wings with Pam and let them bake 5 more minutes so they got crispy. Excellent and you'll never miss the deep fried taste!

This is a great way to fix those restaurant style wings. I've been making them like this for years. The secret I picked up from buying the expensive Hooter's Brand wing breading and wing sauce in the grocery is this; Don't skip the step to refrigerate the wings for 60-90 minutes. After this rest the spiced flour on the wings becomes sticky. Now they are ready to fry. This IS the secret to great breaded wings like this! Spices in the flour can be varied to taste. Also to simplify I use about 2/3 butter to 1/3 Frank's Hot Sauce for sauce. Melted in the microwave it tastes like a million bucks! The expensive Hooter's wing sauce also taught me that for the hotter sauce use a greater proportion of sauce to butter. The mild Hooter's sauce uses a larger proportion of butter to sauce.

Just when I thought it could'nt get any better. I cooked these last night and followed directions as stated, with one exception I only kept them in the fridge for maybe 40mins before frying, I truly believe this step is what makes them so crispy and the seasoning was right on spot. Next time I will leave in the fridge for 90mins as stated. The sauce was great!!!. I have cooked the Buffalo Chicken Wings I from this site in the past, and not to take away from that recipe it is good. This recipe is the one I will use from now on for my hot wings. UPDATE!!! THIS IS ANOTHER RECIPE THAT I CAN NOT STOP MAKING, I NOW ALSO ADD ONION POWDER, GARLIC POWDER AND SEASON SALT TO MY FLOUR MIXTURE, I NEVER SKIP THE FRIDGE STEP, IF YOU DO, JUST TRY IT THE RECIPE WAY I'M SURE YOU WILL SEE THE DIFFERENCE, I NEVER BUY HOT WINGS OUT ANY MORE!!!!!. THIS IS AN UPDATE ON MY UPDATE!!! I WAS LOOKING FOR SOMETHING TO COOK TONIGHT AND WHILE READING REVIEWS THIS CAME UP AGAIN, JUST SEEING THIS RECIPE MAKE ME CRAVE IT MORE, OH WELL GUESS IT'S HOT WINGS AGAIN TONIGHT, THIS IS TRULY HOW GOOD THIS RECIPE IS.

As a guy born and raised in Buffalo let me tell you that this recipe's name needs to be changed.  This is NOT a 'Buffalo style" chicken wing.  We do not bread our wings for a starter.  Being territorial of our wings, let me just say that you should only use FRANKS RED HOT SAUCE and the ratio to the butter should be 1 stick to every 12 oz.  Also the oil should be around 400 degrees.  One thing that will keep your wings crispy is to not over-saturate them with sauce.  Let them set and 'drip dry' for several minutes so the sauce can stick to the chicken instead of sliding off the oil then put them in a large bowl.  Using a ladle give em one scoop full and then toss, coating evenly and adding small amounts of sauce to cover completely.  You should not have a pool in the bottom when you're done.

Excellent recipe.  I made these over the weekend;the only hot sauce I had was Tabasco.  We loved the wings and we love spicy foods, but these were just too hot and the sauce was very thin and watery.  I made some more last night for just my husband and me using Texas Pete and it was perfect.  They had the perfect amount of heat.  I also followed the directions except for frying.  I baked then in the oven for about 30 mins. at 350.  I lightly sprinkled them with flour then sprayed cooking spray on them and they had a great crust coming out of the oven.  Definetly recommend!!!

oh my these were sooo good! I pretty much followed the recipe but I never measure spices, just a dash here and there etc.. I wasn't sure if I needed to still put them in the fridge since I was baking them, but I did. I put them on baking sheets sprinkled with alittle more flour and sprayed with pam. I baked @400 for 40 min turning once then I put some BBQ sauce on some and the hot sauce on the others and baked @300 for 15min... they were great! I was surprised that they were crispy too!
Thank you!

These are the best wings I ever made, my family went crazy over them!
I didn't even try the sauce mixture, we used our favorite bbq sauce,for half of them and I made a garlic butter sauce for the other half. I will try the hot sauce recipe next time I make these.
The breading is terrific, you have to try this recipe!

These wings are excellent!!  I moved to WA state from Ohio and could not find hot enough wings to satisfy my taste.  The only changes I made was to add a bit more spices to the coating and more hot sauce to the sauce.  Since I like my buffalo wings a bit dryer, I put wings onto a cookie sheet after frying and poured sauce over them, baked at 350 for 15 mins., turning.. they turned out fantastic!!!  Thank you for sharing!

These were a big hit at out 'finger food' dinner. My family loved them just as much reheated the next day.  Rather than frying, I sprayed the floured wings with a fat free oil spray and baked them for 30 - 45 minutes in a 350 degee oven. I basted thm with the sauce as they cooked and turned them once.  I'll make this again for sure!

There are 6 members in my family. We are all wing lovers. We have wings at least once a week. We have tried several methods of cooking them. Grilling was our favorite until I found this recipe!! WOW-Toooo good to be true. Thanks Kelly

I did these two ways simultaneously, and they were great both ways.

First, it cannot be overstated how important it is to let these rest in the refrigerate after tossing in seasoned flavor.  This provides the wings with the light, crunchy, spicy crunch that they need.  Also, it is easiest to cook them if you get rid of the wing tips, but this is optional.

After they rested, I fried one batch of the wings as indicated in the recipe (in peanut oil).  I also baked another batch at 350 for 45 minutes and then at 375 for 10 minutes (after spraying with cooking spray, as suggested).  They still weren't quite brown enough, so I broiled them for about 3 minutes.  Perfect.

The result?  Both batches were just amazing and would be a hit anywhere.  The fried wings tasted marginally better, but the difference was really only noticeable in side-to-side comparison.  This will be my go-to recipe for wings, especially for covered-dish affairs and parties.

I'm an experiened Buffalo chicken wing maker and live in Rochester, NY, which only matters because Rochester NY makes better wings than Buffalo by a long shot.. Original Buffalo wings were great back in 1984 but a recipe as simple as that needs some tweaking. Buffalo still makes wings the simple way, which is a shame because recipes like this are much better. What really makes a Buffalo Wing a Buffalo Wing is the combination of the wings, celery and blue cheese dipping sauce. As simple as this recipe for blue cheese dipping sauce might look, it tastes like  the best. Add 1/2c sour cream, 1/2c real mayonaisse, 2/3c crumbled blue cheese (don't use Gorgonzola...it's too weak), 1/4 tsp garlic powder and 1/4 tsp onion powder to a mixing bowl and mix it with a spoon or fork. Let it rest at least 6 hours but overnight is best. Stir before using.

OMG, I made these 2 nights ago and I'm already jonesing for them again!  I put a little bit of canola oil in the bottom of the baking sheet and baked mine at 400 for 35-40 minutes, turning them once, and they came out crispy and yummy.  I like to eat my wings naked and dip them in the sauce so that they stay crispy.  I used Frank's RedHot sauce.  No need to stink up your house frying these up.  They came out awesome baked!

It took me a few times to get the sause just right. I used 2 parts Franks Red Hot /1 part butter with a little crushed garlic. Also doubled the cay and paprika in batter. These are asked for so often that I had to start making 6-10 lb batches in one shot and freezing in serving size baggies. Lay them out on a cookie sheet so they aren't touching and flash freeze them individually (so they don't stick together later), when frozen, bundle in serving size baggies or in one big container.  Freezing seperately makes it easy to pull out just what you need without them sticking together. works great for quick snacks or appetizers for unexpected guests. To reheat - bake frozen wings for a few minutes to warm and then pop in the broiler to crispen a bit. Thanks for the recipe!

Fantastic!  Simply follow the directions and you have some good eats here!  I added a tsp of Emeril's Essence to the flour.  In order to serve these hot at the big game party at a friends house, I "flash fried" them in oil to crisp them up and once we arrived I baked them at 350 for 12 minutes.  Toss with the sauce and we serve them piping hot.  Many compliments were issued.  Definitely a keeper!

Excellent!  This is one of my husband's favourite dishes.   I bake these wings and use the following directions: 1.  Line cookie sheet with foil 2.  Use wire racks - spray lightly with cooking spray to prevent the wings from sticking. 3.  Put wings in single layer on wire rack.  Spray lightly with cooking spray (this helps crisp the wings) 4.  Cook @ 400 degrees F for 40 minutes, turn 1/2 way through (spray again lightly).   They turn out every single time!  Love them!

Yum yum yum! I made these with chicken strips instead of wings... absolutely delicious! I however, did make a few changes though. First I dipped the strips into a bowl of beaten eggs, then dipped into the flour mixture... refrigerated for about 1/2 an hour, then dipped them in the flour again. This made a nice thick and crispy batter that doesn't flake or peel off while frying. Oh so good! We really enjoyed these!

BAKE THESE!!! Following another reviewers comments, I baked at 400 degrees on a wire rack, 20 min on each side. The sauce wasn't thin to me (just normal wing consistency). I used a hot sauce mixture that was half (1/8 cup) Tabasco and half (1/8 cup) Siracha hot sauce. That's all I had in the house, and it was DELICIOUS. (They tasted just like restaurant hot wings, even with the thai inspired hot sauce). I can't imagine frying them, they were crispy and greasy (in a good wing sort of way) as it was. If anything, I think you can cut the butter in the sauce a bit. Perfect with the game!

A Buffalonian, born and raised. At the Anchor Bar in Buffalo, New York, the wings are fried to a golden crisp, the sauce is Anchor Bar Original, but here Franks Red Hot Sauce and only butter are the favorite. once the wings are fried, they are placed in a bowl and the sauce is added, and mixed together, by preference I like them saucy. True Buffalo Wings are served with Celery and Carrot sticks with Blue Cheese Dressing, for dipping. This recipe is a great variation,  but not totally authentic. 5 Stars

I have to agree these were really good, with and without the hot sauce. I put the garlic in the flour mix. Letting it set in the flour works very well. I made 20 1/2 with hot sauce, 1/2 just plain, they ate them all. Great recipe will definatly make again.

I made this one night at my boyfriends house and everyone loved these wings!  I served them with celery sticks and Marie's Blue Cheese Dressing.  Absolutely wonderful!  I was forced to make them for his entire family the following weekend.  Who needs "TGI Fridays" or "Hooters" for wings when you have this receipe!!!!  (The fried chicken wings are also really good without the hot sauce, for those who can't handle the heat!)

I have been craving buffalo chicken for the longest time, but I don't like wings. So I used chicken tenders instead.  I added some onion and garlic powder to the flour and left the chicken in the flour mixture for several hours. I tripled the sauce (FRANK'S) and added a splash of vinegar. I poured it into a large baking dish and after I fried the chicken, I drained it on paper towels and laid them in the sauce.  They were absolutely delicious.  Thanks Kelly.

I was very disappointed with this recipe.  I made it for my boyfriend who loves buffalo wings but was also disappointed with this attempt at restaurant-style buffalo wings.  One serious problem was the sauce....it tasted like butter!  The flour mixture was also bland and far from spicy.  I added extra cayenne pepper but that didn't seem to help.  I added extra hot sauce and Tabasco sauce to the hot sauce, as recommended by other reviewers, but that didn't aid the sauce.  I'm still looking for a decent buffalo wing sauce to use, as I will not use this sauce again.  As for the chicken, I'll use the flour mixture but I'll add extra seasonings.

Perfect.  Hub wanted not so messy buffalo wings, and this was just perfect for him.  I'm not a big fan of chicken on the bone, and I even loved them!  I baked them as others suggested and that worked out just fine.  Thanks much for the great recipe Kelly!

Great, but you want to make it hotter!!  We suggest adding 1 tablespoon of tobasco sauce, a half table spoon more cayenne pepper and 2 tablespoons of cajun spice.

Excellent wings!!  I added extra hot sauce and some cayenne pepper as they seemed pretty mild to me with the amount included.

Definitely worth a try!  These wings were yummy, yummy, with blue cheese or ranch dressing!  My boys and husband ate them up, although too hot for youngest boy who is four.  (That's ok, he can have hot dog night when I make these again, which I will!)  Thanks Kelly for sharing this recipe!

You can really change things around with this recipe, I added 1/2 of cup honey in the sause on low heat and depending on what kind of sauce you use I get a low mild but add my own hot sauce. I also add  differnt spices to the flour when it comes time to coat the wings.

Best wings ever! I'm from NY and went to college upstate where buffalo wings were invented. This recipe is great..very authentic. i didn't even bother with the flour because i like my wings dry and crispy with plenty of sauce. the flour coating just gets a bit too heavy for me and was never used in ny. i fried my wings in canola oil and kept them warm in the oven at 250 while i fried the rest in batches. trick is to fry in small batches so wings have room to move. a crowded pot means wings will take longer to cook, the oil temp will drop and you'll get greasy results. i doubled the sauce and it was more than enough for about 15 wings. toss them with the sauce in a large bowl, don't stir and serve immediately. i love my wings with blue cheese dressing and celery. slice the celery in stalks and store it in cold ice water in fridge while preparing wings. the crunchy ice cold celery cuts the kick of the hot sauce perfectly! great recipe, you won't be disappointed!

The wings are great if you follow the recipe BUT if you want to make them 'OFF THE HOOK' then add a packet of dry ranch mix and a 1 tbsp. of Goya Adobo spice to the flour mixture...WOW!!

I followed the recipe exactly except for the frying and using wings :) I had 2 chicken drumsticks so I used those instead and the recipe was delicious! I also didn't have enough oil, so I baked them instead.   I baked them for 48mins on the wire rack at 400. I sprayed the chicken with PAM so they wouldn't stick to the wire rack. I also placed a cookie sheet underneath the chicken so all drippings would land there and not the bottom of the oven.   I used El Tapatio hot sauce. I would definitely make this recipe again! You can use any part of the chicken with this recipe, and it'll still be delicious. I guess it depends on what hot sauce you use, but El Tapatio hot sauce I used wasn't TOO hot; it was just right. Perfect! It was enough to taste the spicyness. It was really good :) I'm definitely making this again!

These hot wings are great! I omitted the caynenne pepper and garlic from the recipe. I increased the hot sauce to compensate for that. Instead of using the sauce for dipping, I brushed it over them and poored anything remaining on them. I then baked them for 20 minutes on 250 degrees. I would recommend trying these. For extra spicyness, I think that you could add extra hotsauce on them either before or after baking.

This is the closest thing to hooters that you can make at home, and the chicken comes out delicious.  I use a ratio of 75% hot sauce and 25% butter because I like spicy.  Take the chicken out of the fridge and let it reach room temperature before you dredge it in the flour.  Also, leave the flour coated chicken in the fridge for at least 2 hours before frying.  If you want spicy sauceless wings, dip the chicken into the hot sauce before dredging, then coat them in the flour, refrigerate, and fry.  They come out really tasty this way, and aren't so messy.  Obviously you can also dip them in the hot sauce, dredge them, fry them, and then dip them in the sauce again if you really want a kick.  Awesome submission, thanks.

How could 1,600 hundred people be wrong?? The wings rock! The only change I did to push a garlic thru a garlic press over the wings with a sprinkle of salt, mixed them, and let them sit 10 minutes before adding the flour and proceeding with the recipe as stated.  I did add some garlic salt and onion powder to the flour, let them sit for the 90 minutes, although I was curious for this step cuz this was my first try at making wings. They came out crunchy and perfect. Maybe next time I will add about 1/4 cup more flour, to make more coating. I'll be making these a lot! Thanks!

Love this recipe! Have made is several times. Never had great success baking the wings. They are OK but not as good as the fried ones. My wife sprinkles Parmesan cheese on hers as they come out of the fry pan. Use margarine instead of butter in the sauce for better taste. Letting them sit in the fridge is MOST IMPORTANT! 
Seriously, I could eat these three times a week.

Good Wings!  I used Frank's Hot Sauce - poured over the wings and kept hot even in the oven until they all were ready.  I definitely ate too many they were so good.

These wings turned out great! instead of frying I baked them for 40 mins turning them once and then applied the sauce baking for 15 more mins at 300 as suggested by another reviewer. for my sauce I used Louisiana hot sauce and light CountryCrock butter. My family is constantly requesting these. Wow is all I can say! I will not be buying hot wings anymore.

Wonderful recipe!

I too baked them at 375 for 45 minutes on a heavily oiled baking pan, turning once. I than mixed with the sauce, put them in a casserole baking dish and baked for another 20 minutes. So good!
I also used drums instead of wings (didn't have any on hand) and although they can't really be buffalo wings, they were perfectly good and there was more meat to enjoy!

The only thing that went wrong for me was my hot sauce was a bit too garlic. Next time I'll try franks or some other less garlicy type.

Thanks for sharing!

This is an excellent recipe!  Everyone enjoyed these-I've made these 2 times so far and I knew when making the 2nd time that it needed more tangy wing sauce so I doubled the sauce recipe so that the wings were smothered in the sauce.  I suggest a little bit more cayenne to give it a kick..  Thanks for the recipe

Not a Buffalo Wing at all. Born and raised in Buffalo, I laugh at peoples interpretation of a Buffalo wing.  The only ingredients you need besides chicken is butter and Franks Hot Sauce.  Deep fry your chicken wings and in a separate bowl add butter and hot sauce.  Depending on how hot like it add more or less butter.  That is it, the "secret" to the Buffalo wing.

I have been making wings for the past 35 years and other then the ones that I have had in restraunts in Buffalo, these are the best. Great combination of flavours, everyone one was very happy. Don't forget the blue cheese and cellery sticks! Thanks Kelly

These were excellent. The only thing I changed was I added Garlic and Onion Powder to the flour mix.  As all others have stated it's important to refrigerate these and not skip this option.

What I love about these is you can customize the sauce coasting to your taste. The first time I used Franks Honey BBQ Hot sauce (for a milder taste) and the second time I used Franks Hot Wings Hot Sauce (for a Hot taste). Both were excellent. Now I'm having fun coming up with different sauces  for these. 

This recipe went right into my saved Recipe Box and I will make them over and over again. Thank you for an great recipe!

The only reason why I didn't rate this recipe 5 stars was because after preparing it as it was written, I found it to be bland. Tasting like chicken with hot sauce. So when I made it the second time around I I seasoned my chicken first with seasoning salt, black pepper, garlic powder and accent, then added the flour and let it sit in the fridge. This made a world of difference in the taste.

"Very Delicious!"  I made these wings about a week ago and I marinated them in the flour and seasoning for one hour, 90 minutes the kids would have eaten me instead of the wings.  I fried the wings in our fry daddy and they came out very crispy even once the sauce was put on them.  My husband and the kids loved them.  "Awesome" is all I can say.  We are having them again tomorrow as long as Hurricane Earl doesn't take out our power!

UPDATE to earlier review:
I have made this recipe at least a dozen times now and I have a few tips to make the best wing recipe even better.
1.Paper towel dry the wings 1st, then season the wings w/salt & pepper b4 dredging.
2. Put the flour mix in a bowl and dredge the wings one at a time. this insures all the wings are covered completely. 
3. Use Crisco.....lol
4. Wings should be really cold b4 frying in 375 degree Crisco.
5. Let the wings rest 4 a few minutes b4 saucing. 

The only problem I have w/this recipe is, I no longer can eat wings out, nobody's wings are as good as mine......lol

Happy Eats :)



What can I say that hasn't been said already.
Followed this recipe as written, EXCELLENT!
I tripled the recipe, Everyone that ate them had nothing but complements. They wanted more!
Served with celery, carrots and ranch dressing.

Yumm!  I followed another users' suggestion and used a wire rack over a cookie sheet, and baked the wings at 400 degrees for 45 minutes, then sprayed them with vegetable oil on both sides and baked for ten more minutes.  On half of the wings I put barbecue sauce for the last ten minutes as well, and they were even better than the plain!

BAKE THESE FOR A HEALTHIER VERSION- Still delicious! My husband had no idea they were baked and ate more then I thought was physically possible.  Heres what I did: Added a little bit of red pepper flakes to flour mixture.  Coated wings and refrigerated for 90 minutes.  I used a glass baking dish because I didn't have a drip pan (worked fine).  375 F oven- baked 10 min side A, then sprayed side A with olive oil to crisp up and baked 10 more min.  Then I flipped to side B and repeated (40min total), then I flipped again and added buffalo sauce mixture and baked 10 minutes and flipped and repeated.  Total cook time 60 minutes and they were cooked all the way through.  I used Louisiana hot sauce and used minced garlic instead of garlic powder.  Next time I will try Franks based on other reviews just to try something new.  Will definitely make again!Yummy!!

this is an excellent recipe.  Thanks Kelly. I always knew wings were horrible for me, but knowing the sauce is basically butter just piles the guilt right on top of the fried wings.   I had two minor and easily adjusted issues with this recipe.  10-15 minutes is way too long at 375.  I pulled them out at about 7 minutes and the crust was over cooked while the chicken was cooked through and hot inside.  Second, these were not too tasty without the sauce.  Any time I coat with flour, I always compensate for the lack of flavor by adding additional salt.     The sauce recipe was excellent but obviously relies heavily on the hot sauce used.   quick, easy, and good..

Excellent!!! So good, I know longer crave Buffalo chicken wings from my fave restaurant!!! I served it with garlic mashed potatoes and celery sticks on the side. Instead of setting the chicken and then sprinkling the flour mixture. I individually coated each piece of chicken and then put them on a tray, and sprinkled the leftover flour over the already coated chicken. After refridgerating the chicken and before frying, I shook the tray to give the chicken a 3rd coat, which made it extremely crispy!

My 4 grown up kids love chicken wings and either do them in the turkey fryer for a football game or buy them in a frozen box.  I decided to try this recipe but in the oven and they were amazing.  I increased the spices, rolled in flour mix and let sit for 90 minutes in fridge.  Sprayed with Pam, put in 400 oven and flipped after about 30 minutes.  They were amazing on their own but rocked when we dipped them in one of my homemade sauces,  honey/garlic, buffalo and barbque.    My daughter loved them and grandson gave them his finger licking approval. What I like is that when I have company I will be able to prepare the sauces ahead, have the wings floured and ready for the oven.....no stress entertaining.  I may try baking them, put in individual sauces, then reheat for about 10 minutes before serving????  Anyway, I won't be deep frying them anymore, tasted better in oven. Thanks

These were awesome!  I baked them instead of frying...but baked them a long time...meat practically fell off the bone, the skin/coating was nice & crunchy...sauce was excellent.  Will definitely do these again.

I skipped the part of putting them in the fridge after coating them with the flour mixure because I didn't have time and they turned out great. I used Frank’s hot sauce (original) and followed the rest of the recipe exact.  Next time I will allow time for them to sit - I am looking forward to tasting the difference.

I made them as directed minus the homemade sauce.  As it was Super Bowl Sunday and I'd already made tons of other things I didn't want to hassel with that part.  

The breading was a perfect touch and I really think keeping the wings in the fridge for 90 minutes worked wonders on helping the chicken hold the breading.  

I made a ton of these and boy did they go fast!

I deep fried them in my big pot filled with regular vegetable oil.  

After frying I let them sit on a plate with paper towels to let the remaining oil drip off.  

Then I used the Louisana Wing Sauce (2 bottles), stirred in a whole stick of unsalted butter (to cut some of the heat, but believe me they were still tons of spicy goodness) to coat the wings.

The breading soaked up some of the sauce and the chicken was tender down to the bone!

I gave away the recipe to four people.

All in all, minus the 30 minutes of frying (remember I had 4 lbs of wings), this is a wonderful recipe.

Can't wait for an excuse to make them again!

Terrific!  Followed recipe exactly - did some buffalo wings and then also did some fried wings dipped in low sodium soy sauce rather than the buffalo.  Both were delicious.  The breading is perfect without being too much!

Very awesome! Try adding honey to your sauce.  It cuts the heat a bit and adds flavor.

Great recipe. The recipe also doesn't state what type of hot sauce or frying oil to use.....I used Franks Red Hot sauce and Planters Peanut Oil.

im a vegetarian…so of course i don't know what it tastes like but i made them for a friend and my husband one night and my friend who is very picky with food said that they were the best wings he had ever tasted…. sooo i think they are great :)    one thing i did add was adobo seasoning… my grandmother puts it on everything… so i decided to mix it with the flower… i put ¼ teaspoon… so i think it made a difference…

I have a foolproof way to fry.  I have a big Le Creuset dutch oven.  I melt 3 sticks of Crisco.  Put 4 wings at a time and put the COVER on.  The cover creates an oven inside and it fries the skin crispy while the steam is cooking the inside meat.  5 minutes on each side - but of course look for the nice brown color.  I also make regular fried chicken this way with self rising flour - works every time - Enjoy!

I'm not crazy about hot things so I didn't use as much hot sauce, thus it inevitably lost some of its flavor. Great texture.

These are amazing!  I have been making them for more than a year now, and my husband still prefers these to any we've had in restaurants since then.  Very easy and tasty.  I use Tapatio for the hot sauce.  I made them for a Super Bowl party recently and everyone loved them!

No changes need to be made to make a basic hot wing. Because we like our hot wings hotter, I did marinate overnight in some mind-numbing hot sauce and then added lots of cayenne to the flour mixture. Overall, this is far tastier and easier than the Hooter's Mix I've bought in the past. Also, DO NOT SKIP THE 90 MINUTES OF RESTING--it is necessary!

Awesome!  Definately a wing cook-off winner.    PS I add a dash of pure New Mexico red chili powder to the breading mix for a bit deeper flavor!

This is a GREAT recipe. Believe me, I have tried hundreds of variations and different recipes for hot wings. You can also take frozen chicken tenders, any brand or kind and dip them in just this sauce when you don't have a lot of time. it is also amaaazing.

Favorite wing recipe! I put the garlic powder in the flour and sprinkle the wings directly with pepper. I use margarine with the hot sauce and add a couple drops of tabasco - one of few recipes where I replace butter with margarine.  I use a pastry brush to apply the sauce so the wings stay super crispy. The 60-90 minutes of rest time is critical.

These are great!  After frying them crisp (but not completely cooked) I drained them on paper towels then transferred them to a slow cooker.  I poured the sauce on, tossed them to coat, and cooked on low about three hours before a party.  They were tender and juicy, with a terrific flavor.

These were very good.  My husband doesn't like anything hot so I cut the cayenne to just a smidgen and I didn't toss the wings in the hot sauce.  I only had time to leave in the frig for an hour but they still turned out.  My husband says for me to make all my chicken like this.  I will be using this recipe more often.  The sauce was delicious.  I used Franks mildest sauce and put them on mine.  Can't wait to serve these to my sons.

These turned out great! The refrigeration step made all the difference to making the batter turn out correctly- like what you see at restaurants.  Thanks so much for sharing!!

This recipe is really good...Thank you!  Had great reviews from Superbowl party guests last night! Followed each step, exception for the butter (used less than what is called for); they turned out perfect and similar to certain restaurants.  Will try baking them next time and see how they turn out.

So I switched the spices up a bit and just doubled up on cayenne and skipped the paprika in the flour mixture.  I did two separate batches one, with the flour mixture and one naked (marinated in sauce and fried with no flour).

I personally preferred the "naked" ones.  The flour mixture just isn't flavorful enough for me and really doesn't do much justice to the wings IMO.  Overall it didn't make the wings themselves very tasty, another poster mentioned this (that the majority of flavor comes from the sauce).  I had to add salt to the ones that I did with flour after I pulled them out of the fryer.

I also didn't add the sauce until they were ready to serve as I thought it would make them soggy as well.  I used peanut oil to fry and I would recommend it if you have it.  It always makes the chicken nice and crispy and seals in the juices.  I also did small batches to ensure the grease stayed hot and the chicken wouldn't be oily.  

I was disappointed as a recipe that hold a solid 5 stars I really thought would knock my socks off, but it didn't.  Oh and if you want you can cheat and just buy the "hooters wing sauce" they sell in the jar at the grocery.  It takes the hassle out of making the sauce and it very good.

If I made these again, this is how I would do it:  skip the whole flour mixture as it really adds nothing to the wings themselves, marinate the chicken in the "wing sauce" for 24 hours prior and fry as is then add extra sauce upon serving.

I actually followed this recipe almost to the tee, but with seitan in lieu of chicken.  If you use good quality seitan with this recipe, you'll have perfect veggie buffalo wings in no time!

I made these twice using cubed breast meat instead of wings and drumsticks.  The first time was great, but for some reason the second time around the oil separated out of the buffalo sauce.  I am not sure what I did differently, so I would like to keep experimenting to see how I can correct this problem.

Best breaded wings I ever had. Used sour dough bread mix instead of flour just to use it up and I added a tsp of sour cream to the hot sauce mix to take out the bite. Probably wouldn't add salt next time because hot sauce is already very salty, but again, very very good.

This is by far the best buffalo chicken wing recipe I have ever used...buffalo chicken wings are my favorite food btw!!!  The idea to have them sit in the flour mixture for a couple hours is what makes these sooo great.  They are the perfect thing to eat every Sunday with football, which my family does!!!

In the words of my fiancee "these are soooo good!".    First time making chicken wings, and these were super easy.  The hardest part was cutting apart the chicken wings because the ones I bought weren't cut up, but I got my fiancee to do those.  We made 36 wings, and just doubled the recipe.  I am making these again next weekend and will add more hot sauce to make one mild (this version) and one hot.  Also used a Fry Daddy fryer, and only had to cook for 5 minutes.  But then I put the wings in a pan in the oven on warm while the next batch was cooking.

Wings turned out great, but I didn't think they were spicy enough. That is offcourse personal taste. Another thing is that the wings became somewhat soggy when I coated them in the butter/hot sauce. Other than that it was a success!

This is the BEST wing recipe I've ever had!!  I used the sauce on baked turkey legs (minus the skin, baked until the outer meat was a little crispy) and it was absolutely amazing!  I used Franks Hot Sauce, and added 1/4 cup habanero hot sauce for an extra kick.  Very very good!

These are great!!! I use boneless breasts and cut them up for "boneless wings". Then I soak them in egg & milk mixed. Then I can skip the fridge. I added a little more hot sauce and cayenne pepper. These are the best! Also if you are looking for a little change add garlic salt to taste and about a t-spoon of white vinegar to the sauce.

I did something a little different.  Instead of using wings, I used boneless chicken strips.  They came out excellent.  Just like Chili's or Ruby Tuesday's boneless chicken wings.

I did half of my wings according to the recipe, and then just baked the other half of the wings. I liked the baked wings much better than fried! The sauce was very good. Will make again, but I will prefer to bake my wings.

the secret ingredient has always been a shot (capful ) of apple cider vinegar to give the fully-appreciated bite to the spicy taste... and... always use FRANK'S hot sauce ... because that's really how its done right !!!

My rating is for the sauce ONLY since I made some changes to the methodology.  First off, I used chicken tenders, second I baked them.  This is the second time I've tried to bake a deep-fry recipe and this is the second time it's failed miserably!  I read several other reviews, all of which stated the end result was great, so I don't know how I messed up.  I ended up with a hard crust (not the same as crunchy!) that didn't soak up the sauce at all.  It was pretty gross, to be honest, and the exact problem I had the last time I tried to bake breaded shrimp.  Anyway, from now on I'm just going to suck it up and deep fry when the recipe says to deep fry.  If it's only once in a while it's ok, and there really is no other substitute for that crispy golden crust.  The sauce was very good, btw.

Perfect recipe. This is going to be my goto recipe from now on. Crispy on the outside, done on the inside.

This was ordinary fried chicken.  Good, but not Buffalo Chicken Wings.  Sorry didn't get the rave reviews - the sauce was too buttery (and we measured everything).

Sorry folks, but this recipe is misnamed.

Buffalo wings were created in the kitchen of the Anchor Bar in Buffalo, NY. They are baked already sauced, not fried with a gooey mess added later.

These are very good chicken wings. I used the Louisiana Hot Sauce.  This turned out to make a mild to medium spice for the wings.

these are really good. I had made these for years. I do one little extra step that I feel makes them over the top.
 After frying them and adding the sauce, I throw them on a foil line cookie sheet and bake for 10 min on 375. This makes the sauce soak into the breaded wings.

Great tasting.  As with all cooking, you have to be able to "feel" it out.  Frying them for 10-15 minutes seemed long, and if you;re like me, keeping the oil at 375 is difficult.  I just eye-balled it.  When they got a darkish brown I took them out.  Should take at least 5 minutes though.  If its quicker than that, your oil is too hot and the inside of the chicken wont cook.  Be sure to refrigerate and taste the sauce before you douse!  Good stuff!

YES!!!!!!!Update: I followed the recipe exactly doubling all ingredients for 5 lbs wings, then I baked them in (2) 13x9 foil lined pans sprayed with pam for 45 minutes at 375, then added the sauce which I doubled. They came out excellent and easier clean up!

Best wings I ever made and I have tried lots of recipes.  I actually baked them as amydoll  suggested and brushed on the sauce at the end, turning off the oven and leaving them for 5 minutes per side before turning and brushing once again.  Very yummy.  Thank you for sharing this lovely recipe.

These were OK. Both my husband and I liked them well enough, but we're going to keep searching for a buffalo chicken wing recipe that blows us out of the water.

Excellent, crisp and delicious.  I added all my flour ingredients in a large ziploc bag, then I added the chicken wings, 1/2 at a time and shook the bag.  All the wings were then evenly coated.  I did put then in the fridge for 90 min as specified.  After my wings were fried, I placed them on a rack to keep them crisp.  Then I shook 1/2 of them in the hot sauce w/butter, the other 1/2 I put in a pot and poured VH Honey Garlic Sauce on them.   YUMMY

These wings couldn't have turned out better! I doubled the recipe (to make 2 lbs of wings) but followed the recipe exactly the first time.  They turned out great! The second time I added more hot sauce and a touch more cayenne pepper and they were perfect!

Perfect 10! The absolute key is the refridgeration.  DO NOT skip this step. The flour mixture is so versatile, but I stuck to the recipe other than adding a touch of garlic powder.  My sauce I doubled since I made more than 10 and did a higher ratio of sauce to butter because we wanted SPICY!  Used Frank's Red Hot Buffalo Sauce.  Thank you so much for this recipe! I have a very happy husband right now!

Wow!!  these are amazing!!! and that's coming from quite the hot wing critic might i add.  I followed the recipe practically to a T with only a few minor exceptions-->  1.) I ended up leaving my wings in the fridge overnight after coating in flour mixture (instead of the 60-90 min), & i then made sure that all wings were coated in flour mixture the next day since some seemed to have absorbed the breading...i just shuffled and turned them around in the bowl a bit to get fully coated again in the remaining flour.   2.) I also added a BIT of honey to my sauce which i highly recommend.   3.) Lastly I lifted them out of the oil once or twice during frying then re-submerged because i read that helps add to the crispiness.[I also may have cut my fry time down slightly too...i just cut into them before saucing to make sure they were done.)   AMAZING!!  they were seriously some of the best hot wings ever!!!  i was honestly quite impressed that I had made such incredible wings myself and just as impressed with how easy it was to do it!  I highly recommend this recipe.  My wings were beautifully crispy on the outside with just the right amount of breading to give a nice, crunchy texture but definitely not over-breaded (I don't like heavily breaded wings, so i am extremely picky in this department.) They had a hot, juicy inside and wonderfully spicy but not too spicy lovely saucy-sauce.  :)  (I used Louisiana hot sauce in my sauce.)  I confess: I licked my dish.  :O|    they're goood ;O)

This recipe is awesome!  Tastes like Hooter's wings.  I skipped the refrigeration part and drizzled them with olive oil and then baked them instead of frying.  Added the sauce and they were a huge hit!  This recipe is my new favorite.

I could have sworn these were Hooters! Just a few tips...marinate your wings in buttermilk (this should be a rule for moist meat)kick up the cayenne to 1/2 tsp. in flour, and get yourself some FRANKS BUFFALO SAUCE...1/2 cup to 1/2 cup butter melted..toss your wings when they're frying...and your in heaven!

This is the first time I have ever tried making homemade wings. These are AWESOME!! Better than any wings I've ever tasted! I used Franks original hot sauce and measured equal parts butter to Franks for the sauce....excellent! I also just used a deeper skillet and used canola oil just enough to cover a little over half of the chicken, and cooked for about 2 min additional to what recipe calls for. Everyone loved them! They were gone in a flash!

Wow! These are great! We love the Tyson’s Any-tizers Buffalo Style Hot Wings, but its summer and I didn’t want to turn on the oven to make them so I decided to try out this recipe. I bought a 1-1/2 lb pkg of chicken party wing sections and used my 12” cast iron skillet with a lid to fry these babies up. So crispy! I’m glad I read the reviews because I wouldn’t have known what kind of hot sauce to use. I found a bottle of Crystal’s Louisiana Hot Sauce is the cupboard, so that’s what I used. I also used unsalted butter because we don’t like things too salty. I’m going on the hunt for Frank’s Hot Wing sauce because everybody raves about that one. This was so easy to make! I’m going to use this method of breading for regular fried chicken from now on.

Absolutely awesome. I had to make some substitutes though but it worked. I used self raising flour instead of all purpose, because that's what I had in the house. I used Tobasco as the hot sauce, and it already had a hint of garlic flavor. But since I love garlic, I still used some minced garlic when I made the sauce by frying them up a bit before adding the butter and hot sauce. And it is absolutely essential to refrigerate the seasoned floured wings if you want them crispy. I actually put the wings in the freezer for 30minutes, then rolled the wings through the flour mixture again before putting them back in the freezer for 30 minutes before frying them up. The result - wonderfully crispy wings!! Thanks for an awesome, yet simple, recipe.

This is one recipe where the age old adage of "Keep It Simple Stupid" rings true. We used a pack of wings from the grocery store that contained sixteen "full" wings. I made half using this recipe exactly the way the recipe stated, and made the other half using another more teriyaki style recipe and required them to be cooked on the grill instead. This recipe far outshined the other. I have been on an epic search for wings worthy enough of a spot on our Sunday Fun Day table during the fall and I have beyond the shadow of a doubt found a suitor. ARE YOU READY FOR SOME FOOTBALL?! oh yeah the lockout :(

These were fantastic.  I hate, hate, hate soggy wings and chilling them in the fridge and cooling on a wire rack is the trick to yummy crunchy wings.  I used Frank's Hot Sauce and kicked them up a bit with Garlic Pepper in the flour mix and sauce.  Delicious!

Excellent!  Baked in oven at 350 for 45 min. & then turned up oven to 375, sprayed wings with butter non-stick spray & cooked for 5 min. more!  So good!

Made these last night and loved them!  After the flour and fridge step I put them on a cookie sheet and sprayed with cooking spray, baking for 45 minutes at 350.  Used 1/3 c wing sauce mixed with 1/3 cup melted butter to brush over wings and bake an extra 15 minutes.  Awesome!

I made these for girls night in.  Superb! 
For those people wanting to lower the heat, add some plain yogurt to the hot sauce.  This also thickens the sauce too. 
Thank you so much for the recipe!

For those of you that want a quick alternative - I used this sauce on (Walmart brand) frozen breaded chicken tender fritters that I deep fried, and although using fresh chicken and following the original recipe is tastier - these came out fantastic!! The sauce is sooo easy and tastes perfect.  Not too spicy and not too bland!  Thanks for the recipe!!

Yowza.  So yummy.  Good baked, great fried.  Make sure you get good wing sauce and ranch.  I'm not sure how 10 wings are supposed to equal 5 servings - as a main course for dinner I would say 8-10 per person.  This one's going in the main recipe rotation!

I made this exactly the way you said and let me tell you that it was a big hit. The first time I made it for my husband to take to a football party and everyone loved it. My second time was for my husband and 15 co-workers and they were going crazy with the wings. They loved it so much that they want me to make them again. Excellent recipe will make repeatedly. Thank you for this wonderful recipe.

Followed ingredients exactly, but sprayed them with PAM and baked for 40 min at 350 degrees. Put sauce on them and baked an additional 5 min. Hubby said they are 5 stars. I don't eat heat so he was the judge.

This recipe is exceptional & I enjoy playing with the hotness of the sauce. I am a very inexperienced cook with many embarrassing kitchen stories - I'm getting better over time though. My husband raves about these wings and now has bragging rights for something that I've made for him :-) Thank you so much for this!

Review and rating is for the wings only.    These were the best wings I've ever attempted.  They came out perfectly per the directions.   Only change was the addition of some garlic and onion powder to the flour mixture.   I will definitely be making these again.

fantastic. I followed the recipe to the letter and could not be happier - these were the best wings I've ever made.  I also did some full-sized drumsticks and thighs with the same breading and they were awesome too.

I went to the Reading Terminal Market and bought fresh chicken (never frozen) and just cannot stop smiling at how well everything went over. Great recipe - don't change a thing. Thanks. Gonzo

This recipe is the best I've ever had! I buy the wings at Sam's Club by bulk and love to do for get-togethers, parties or when just chillin on the weekends. So EASY, yet so delicious.... you can't stop at just one!

Feh, I had this recipe for the longest time and finally made them the other night and they were the best wings I ever made.  Then I came back to this site to review them and accidentally reviewed the wrong recipe XD

Okay now that I have the RIGHT one, thank you so much for this.  These are absolutely amazing.  As I said, best wings I ever made.  I used regular chicken wings with the bones in them.  I refrigerated the wings overnight as well.  I think that helps a lot.  I can't wait to make these again.

This seems to be an excellent recipe.  The only thing is that I didn't let them sit in the refrigerator for the 60 minutes like it said to and they still fried up nicely and delicious.

perfect and exactly like the restaurant. I used 1/2 fat reduced margarine with the hot sauce to cut down a little bit of calories and still excellent!

These were OK.  I decreased the hot sauce by half so my one year old grandson could eat them but, they were still very hot.  I cannot imagine if I had used all that was called for.  I also thought the flavor was just OK.  I have definitely had, and made, better.  I will not make again.

These are pretty good. I made a few tweaks to the sauce I added 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper, 1/4 tsp garlic. I added about 1 tsp of white vinegar. I added just a little corn starch to the mixture to thicken it up. As some of the reviewers mentioned the sauce is very thin. The corn starch kept the wings from absorbing or dropping all of the sauce.

This was delicious but I did not like it as much with chicken wings, instead I used it to make buffalo shrimp which was a much bigger hit at the party

Amazing! Amazing! Amazing! These were to die for wings! So tasty and crispy and perfect level of hotness. I normally like medium spicy wings and this was probably about that. Really enjoyed them and cannot wait to have them again! YUMMMY!

Tried to make these....I understand the theory behind the recipe.  I did the breading and left it in for way over the 90 minutes. Decided to bake them and they came out just okay.  Next time, I'll try to fry, even though I don't like the extra calories.

This was easy!  I don't eat hot food but my hubby does and he really liked them.  I doubled the spices in the flour mix and used regular chicken breast cut into strips.  I let them sit in the fridge as recommended and then fried them up in the fry daddy.  I put mine in an air tight rubbermaid container and poured the sauce over them and shook them up.  When the sauce settled I shook them again, after a couple shakes all the sauce stuck to the chicken really well. The only complaint I had was: please be careful and don't inhale the sauce while it's cooking, it will choke you!  It's really easy to breath it in while it's steaming on the stove.

Really good, I'd never had buffalo chicken before.  I did shallow fry it rather than deep fry, and I left it for the whole 90 minutes in the fridge.  The 3 stars are because there just wasn't enough spice in the coating, I had to add a lot more.  I think there may have been too much flour for it.  Also with the hot sauce I added more spice and a bit of lemon.  I think I just didn't love it, I couldn't eat all of what I had on my plate, after the first handful I had enough.  Maybe I just don't understand American tastes yet lol

Excellent!  We made these for a football game and they didn't disappoint.  We had lots and lots of compliments.  We prefer crispier chicken tossed in the sauce.  The longer we cooked the chicken in the oil -- until turning a deep golden-brown color -- the crispier they got and maintained the crispiness even after tossing them in the sauce.  The crispiness and the sauce were the two things we were complimented on the most.

These were very good.  I used boneless breast chunks and put them in the oven at 350 for 25 minutes, turned the oven up to 450 and let them crisp on each side for 5 minutes. Then coverved them in sauce at cooked at 350 for 10.  They were juicy and the sauce was perfect (I used franks)  I think the the refridgerating after breading was a big part of it. I can imagine these would be awesome with real wings and fried.  Thanks!

I decided to bake the wings for a healthier version and they were pretty good. I suppose to make them great I should have fried. I will definitely make again in the future although I will let the wings sit in the buffalo mixture for a while. Great recipe to build off of!

These are the best chicken wings ever! I baked these, rather than fry, to make it a little healthier. 350F for 45 minutes, flipped, sprayed with canola oil spray and increased the temperature to 375F for an additional 10 minutes. I used a hot sauce my sister brought back from a trip in Florida; it wasn't exactly as hot as I'd liked but we'll be using Frank's Red Hot from now on! They weren't too crispy, so next time I will either broil near the end or lightly fry then bake next time. Authentically, these ought to be served with carrot and celery sticks along with blue cheese dip but we had a salad instead.

These are very good but next time I will increase  the spices in the flour.  I used 4 lbs. of wings so I doubled the flour mixture but I had a lot left over so next time I won't double.   I also made up two separate batches of the hot sauce mixture to compare "Franks" Buffalo style sauce to "Texas Pete."  (We liked Frank's better because it's a bit more "vinegery").   I refrigerated the flour-coated wings for only one hour but next time, I will extend the time to at least two hours.  (Still had a lot of flour on them.) Following the advice of others, I then baked the wings at 375 degrees for 25 minutes, turned them, sprayed with Pam, then baked another 25 minutes.  Once they looked a little crisp, I spooned each of the hot sauce mixtures over the wings and then broiled them on top oven rack at 500 degees for 3-4 minutes until very crispy.   Once removed from oven, I spooned more sauce on top and served.  Very good!   Will make again to tweak to our preferences.  BTW,  for those who do not like hot anything, you will be pleased with these.   If  you like a little heat,  decrease butter amount ratio or increase cayenne in flour mixture.  Very good recipe!

I wasn't going to even try them, but my boyfriend loved them! Loved the sauce too. I have used legs instead of wings for easier eating, and they are good either way. I also tried it with boneless skinless breast strips, but DBF said it was a little dry.

My kids love this recipe...especially with a little spicier hot sauce!!!  They brag to their friends and I have to make this dish now at every sleepover.  It's convenient finger food and so delicious.  I highly, highly recommend this.  And there's less mess when you add the flour mixture straight into the bag of chicken wings I get in my grocer's freezer section.  Shake it to coat the wings and drop them directly into the oil.  Then, throw the bag away!  It doesn't get any easier with clean-up.

I loved this recipe, it was just right.  My husband thought it was a bit mild, but still great.  I kept some of the chiken wings out of the sause for my 5 year old and he said it was the best chicken ever!

Could not get any better then this!  I have made these wings 7 or 8 times and have a batch in the fridge awaiting the deep fryer.  I can not bring myself to buy boxed wings any longer. These are too good not to make.  If you are on the fence?  Take the leap and try them you will not be disappointed!

This was very good I cooked mine like yours except I used olive oil and when they were done in the deep fryer I used paper towels to get the extra grease off them. I used Franks buffalo sauce instead of hot sauce and mixed the sauce in the wings together in the bowl then I covered and put in the refrigerator for the night. Next evening I put them on a baking sheet and baked at 350. My husband loved them and they were a huge hit at our party. Now we have a wing night every month and I take them to his unit they all love them.

Loved the coating so much that we sometimes just use that for fried chicken.  And the recipe for the hot sauce is great!!  Two thumbs up!

Love this although I didn't have wings, so I used 1/2-inch cut chicken breast meat. The breading and the flavor are fantastic. Don't skip the refrigeration step, it sets the breading on the chicken for a nice crispy touch. 

Since my chicken was boneless, I prepared a Buffalo Chicken Salad on individual plates, covering each plate with Romaine and Arugula, then added the buffalo chicken strips, and I topped it off with crisp-fried flour tortilla strips, crisp bacon and homemade bleu cheese dressing. the dressing counters just a bit of the heat from the buffalo sauce. A complete meal in one. Thank you for this recipe.

Excellent recipe.  I didn't have any cayenne pepper on hand so I omitted that.  I also baked my wings as another user suggested at 350 for 45 minutes.  They weren't crunchy until they were broiled for another 5 to 10 minutes.  I will make these again.

I love this recipe, use it all the time, I let the wings soak in either an egg and water batter or buttermilk before coating with flour.  I never add cayenne, my wing sauce if hot enough.

Made this as a side to go with pizza night after watching a UFC fight with friends and family...RAVE reviews all night about how it was the best! I prefer letting it sit for about an hour like other reviewers mentioned, but I have made them w/o waiting that long. YUM-O...crispy chicken coated with Franks Red Hot Wings (no need for the butter mix). **to drool for** 
TIP--When I'm pinched for time, after coating with the seasoned flour I just sprinkle water and keep tossing until it looks sticky...=P Works great w/o the wait! 
I wonder if this freezes well after coating? Just so it makes for a really quick snack, you know take it out of the freezer and pop in the deep fryer?! Hmmm. I'll have to test that one out!

Not as crispy as I had hoped but the sauce was awesome! Had about 20 people say how delicious it was at a party last night. Also I wish the sauce was a little thicker. But overall super yummy!

I love dennys buffalo wings and these totally tasted just like them. I was very impressed on how comparible they were to the resteraunts. They were also so simple and easy to make. My family of 5 loved them! I doubled the recipe since I had a big bag of frozen wings which i thawed out a couple days first. My husband to them to work the next day. Great recipe I recommend it to everyone.

I didn't bread the wings. I used extra hot sauce and cooked them in the oven at 350 for 45 minutes. I then put them in for 5 more minutes at 375 and sprayed the wings with Pam

These were sooo good. I also didn't measure anything but the flour, butter and hot sauce. 
I have a little at home deep fryer and let me tell you I could have been at hooters... they were awesome, but with less breading than hooters. Crispy on the outside, moist on the inside. A TIP: You don't have to refrigerate them all that time. My husband knew he wanted wings, and threw a frozen bag of raw wings in the fridge to mostly thaw over about 24 hours. When I wanted to cook'em, I just took them out, soaked them in some room temp water to completely thaw'em which took like 5 mins in the H2O, then put them in just a little water and put like 2 cups of ice over'em. When the flour mixture is ready n the oil is hot, just drain and dry'em... toss'em in the flour and drop'em in the oil. The temp difference is what causes them to fry up nice and crispy. 
The coating isn't as thick as the picture looks. If you've ever used flour or starch to deepfry, you know what you're getting. The skin is nice and krispy, I fried at 375 F* for about 13 minutes in my deep fryer. BAM! Done, delicious, and amazing!!

We made this recipe tonight and it was fantastic!  We used chicken breasts cut in half and then cubed, and instead of 1/4 C butter and hot sauce, we used 1/2 C of each with 1/2 t garlic powder and 1/2 t black pepper.  Excellent!  We will never buy wings again.

This recipe is the best I have ever found. It calls for Hot sauce, I used LOUISIANA BUFFALO WING SAUCE. I will never try any other recipe when it comes to buffalo hot wings. AMAZING! I even warmed up the leftover for lunch the next day and they were just as good as the first time!

These were excellent! The crispiness of the coating was great and they were extremely tasty. The flour coating will allow one to tweak the spices in a million directions by adding whatever you want to the flour itself. Highly recommend these!!!

These were awesome!!  I did make some changes though.  Hubby likes boneless so I used chicken breast instead of wings.  Also, I didn't have any cayenne pepper so I used a black and red pepper mix.  It was so good.  Definitely a keeper.  Kids loved it too.  Thanks for submitting this recipe.

I made these for my husband for the Super Bowl, and he went nuts over them! I used chicken tenders instead of wings because he prefers boneless wings. I followed the recipe exactly using Frank's buffalo sauce for the hot sauce. I'm normally not a big fan of buffalo wings, but I even enjoyed these! My husband could not get enough, and he told me that he wants to have them again soon!

These were fabulous - every bit as good as a bar & grill. I just recently received a deep fryer as a gift and have since been trying different things with it. My husband suggested I do some hot wings for the Super Bowl, and man, this recipe knocked it out of the park. Easy to put together, just enough heat - just awesome! Thank you for a great recipe!

Made these for superbowl and they were great.  I have never made chicken wings before.  I have an electric fryer and they came out very crispy and even in the sauce they stayed crispy.  Next time I will try to bake them and see what happens per another review.  This is a keeper.  Thank you Kelly.

Made as written with the exception of the hot sauce, I only used 1/8 of a cup.  We aren't fans of screaming hot wings, but this amount of heat was just right for us.  Fantastic recipe - thanks Kelly, for sharing.

These were the best homemade buffalo wings I've had, definitely restaurant quality. The frying was a pain and took forever, but everything else was quite simple.

OMG! These are sooooo good! I usually just fry my wings right away after flouring but this time I let them set in the fridge and that MADE all the difference! So good and crunchy! The sauce was great too but it seperates really easily. I made these last night and right now I have another batch in the fridge waiting to go in the fryer for tonight. LOVE these :D

I really like making these. They are very simple to make and I love the way they turn out. I have also done this with chicken tenders that I cut in half, more sauce to chicken ratio that way. I usually make this a couple times a month.

These are the best!  I have tried to save calories by baking wings, but they're just not as good as these which are deep-fried. This is my go-to recipe.

Wow what a simple and tasty recipe. I made a couple of changes. Less butter and more cayenne pepper (doubled). I modified and made 2 other variations with a hot and "old bay" style. Hot and regular were great. Old bay... not quit right. I used a salted old bay rub (don't do it tooooo salty).

These were delicious.  I have absolutely no complaints.  These were just as good as any wing I could have gotten anywhere.  If the recipe is followed completely, they are just stupendous.  I can't say enough good things about them.  I can't wait to have them again, yet of course this is something you can't have too often.

I substituted fresh garlic for real....the only change I made and it was so yummy. Great recipe. I do think the picture is a bit misleading because my skin didn't even resemble that....and I am a very experienced cook, hwaving worked in many many many kitchens.  So don't fret if you think you're having 'flour issues'. You're not. ;-)   It has a great flavor and I will definitely make it again.

Fantastic recipe! I ended up baking the wings for about an hour instead of frying and they turned out great! Just as good as any restaurant and much cheaper! My husband loved them!

My family said these were the best wings they ever tasted.  I think the key is letting flour mixture sit on wings for at least 1 hour and have hot oil.

All I have to say is..WOW! Delicious! I can't stop making these. I made about 20 wings and boneless tenders for a few friends and everyone raved about them~ They all want the recipe! The first time I skipped the fridge step but the second time I tried it and let me just say, the refrigeration step really is KEY to crispy restaurant style wings. This one's a keeper! We will never go out for wings again, these are better! UPDATE: I saved left-overs in a sealed container and re-heated by baking @ 350 for about 5-10 minutes. They turned out to be just as delicious as the day before- I did need to mix another batch of sauce up though but that part is easy!

Made these this evening and my family went insane!  My daughter took one bite and said, "make sure you keep this recipe forever!"  Even my picky-eater son loved them.  I shook them a few at at time in a zip loc bag with the sauce, but other than that made them exactly as stated.  60 minutes in the fridge and they come out crispy and gorgeous!  Now we're planning to have friends over for wing night!  :)

Very yummy! Great for a football game! I used chicken tenders (breasts pounded out and cut into strips). I added a little onion and garlic powder and seasoning salt to the flour mixutre too. And i shallow fried (browned them) in a skillet rather than deep frying to save on some calories/oil. We made them into buffalo chicken sandwiches. On a hamburger bun with mayo, blue cheese, onion and lettuce. They were a huge hit. We'll do these again for sure - and next time with a little more hot sauce for more kick.

YUM! My husband was so excited to have home made wings that tasted just as good (if not better than) Restaurant-Style wings.  We added a few Jalapenos to the sauce for extra heat!

I've been making this recipe for several years now and it never fails. To save time, I bread the chicken the day before, and layer them in a pan between sheets of saran wrap.

Delicious!  I made the recipe exactly as stated, the only thing I might do differently next time is add some garlic powder to the flour mix for a little more flavor.  My BF loved these and already wants me to make them again.

Wow~  My husband said these were the best chicken wings I have ever made!  I left in the fridge with seasoned flour on them for about 2 hours.  I did not fry them, but rather used a previous reader's suggestion and cooked at 400 degrees for 45 minutes and then put under broiler for 4 minutes. YUM!!! I used a Budweiser Wings Sauce, not quite hot enough for us so I added crushed red pepper. Definitely a kepper recipe and no need to fry....turned out nice and crispy without the deep fryting. Highly recommend.....

WOW, AWESOME!  My husband and I made these the other night and were very pleased!  My husband wasn't quite sure what to think of the flour, but he is one who doesn't like any breading on his wings.  I believe that that is what did the trick to make the wings stay crispy.  We lightly floured them, and put them in the fridge for the 90-min., deep fried them until just about done, then put them in a 350 degree oven for about 20-minutes while our other goodies were getting done.  We simmered the sauce for about an hour total - perfectly WARM, not too hot (we used Red's).  When we were ready to eat, we just drizzled the sauce to coat completely, but not drown them.  They stayed perfectly crispy while we were eating. Thanks for the recipe, this is the ONLY way we will make them from now on, and that will be probably 1-2 times a week now that it is summer out!

I used this recipe last night & it was so good that my boyfriend wants me to make it again tonight! Like a few other reviewers I substituted Chicken tenders and baked instead of fried. The sauce was out of this world good. Will definitely be used many more times.

I followed the recipe EXACTLY as it was written. These wings required a lot of paper towel. I don't think I will make them again.

I made these chicken wings for our superbowl party.  Everyone LOVED them. My husband said they were the best wings he had ever tasted.  I put them back in the over for 10 minutes, after I poured over the butter hot wing sauce, they got crispier and even tastier.

THIS IS IT!!!!!!!! Thank you for this recipe and the flour/refrigerator tip!  I even made some "sweet bbq" wings with the basics of this recipe (used no hot sauce, but made a sauce of soy, honey, brown sugar, and bbq sauce) UPDATE: I bake mine for 30-45 min on 350

These wings are great! Now a staple at our football parties, at the firehouse, really any get-together!  I keep a 10 pound bag of wings from the club-discount store in the freezer -- no problem to throw some on whenever I feel like being the hit of a party.  I use Bob's Blue Cheese from this website as dip.  Awesome!

I just made these for my son who is a wing fanatic. Absolutely great!
I used 1/2 tsp. Lawry's seasoned salt in place of the cayenne , paprika and salt.
Also, I made the flour mixture the night before in a ziploc, put the chicken wings in, shook to coat and left in fridge for 12 hours occasionally turning to recoat the wings.Nice and crispy when deep-fried.
Sauce recipe was great. Not overly spicy.
Can't wait for my husband to try these.

Really great sauce! (I used Franks Red Hot Chicken Wing Sauce and then added the reccomended spices) I decided not to deep fry the wings though. Instead, I made a mixture of flour, garlic powder, and salt. I coated the wings in that, and then baked them on a cookie sheet in the oven for about 30 mins, and finished them off by broiling them for a bout 5 mins just to crisp them up. I think that they are probably lower in fat this way (I can always hope! :) and still just as yummy!

Yum, yum!  The flour coating and deep-frying definitely kicks this recipe onto another level!  Tastes just like my favorite wings at Hooters!  I love how it's crispy and tender.  This is a SURE WINNER at parties and get-togethers...everyone always asks for more and is pretty easy to make too.  Goodness, this recipe is just delicious.  There is nothing that I would change about this recipe.

This recipe ROCKS !  We made three different sauces Nuclear HOT (with Habenero Sauce) Regular Hot (with Franks Red Hot) and a BBQ Style (with Sweet Baby Jane's) Turned out Fabulous -I will never eat wings out again. 
Thanks for the recipe !

Oh no! I did not need to know how GOOD these were! So much better than the restaurant even. Perfectly crispy and sinful. I like spice so I will add more Frank's hot sauce next time. These were perfect for my friends who like it mild. I did refrigerate them for over an hour like everyone said. I also let them sit on a paper towel for a second before I rolled them in the sauce. I noticed they were even crispier than the ones I put in the sauce straight from the fryer. Although, those were pretty crispy too. I saw some reviews said they baked the wings after they fried them and covered them in sauce. I like my wings drier and crispier, and trust me, that is not necessary. I followed the recipe and they came out like perfection! Fyi, use Frank's Hot Sauce. I think you can find it most everywhere nowadays. It makes a difference. I've tried baking wings before, they were good. But frying them, wow, SO much better.

I'm from western NY, and worked at a few well established wing joints while in college. This recipe is way better than average, yet still no quite right. We used corn flour to go gluten free, really like the heartier texture. I use both garlic and onion powder, and white and black pepper. At 375-380, assuming your temp is stable (which it likely isn't if you use the 1" deep in a fry pan method) using a basket in a deep 6 qt. pot and a full gallon of peanut oil, the wings should float to the surface and begin to pull away from the bone in 7-8 minutes. This yields perfectly cooked wings that are super crisp on the outside, yet juicy and fall off the bone cooked inside. Buffalo Wings should not be 'floating' in a bowl of sauce, toss wings with sauce in large closed container, remove with tongs and leave excess sauce for the next batch. True Buffalo style is always served with Chunky Blue Cheese dressing, raw carrot, and celery. Cheers.

Soooo GOOD! I did make slight changes - Instead of all-purpose flour, I used whole wheat flour and you couldn't tell! I also baked them. I had pretty large wings, so it took about 50 minutes. Once they were in the oven (300 degrees Fahrenheit), I turned them after 20 minutes of baking. Then turned them again after another 20 minutes but sprayed them with Pam this time. Then, I baked them another 5 minutes on 400 degrees Fahrenheit, took them out of the oven, turned them, sprayed with Pam, and then baked that side for 5 minutes as well. Very crispy and delicious!

We used Frank's Buffalo Wing Hot Sauce (along with the butter, pepper and garlic powder) for the sauce.  Tasted delicious.  Very good recipe, but we don't fry much and it took a while to do (and to clean up the oily mess).  If you have a small fryer machine it might be easier.  But the recipe is delicious.

I made this exactly as directed and it had a WONDERFUL flavor. My only qualm is that they are so fatty that I could only eat two before I became very queasy. I felt pretty gross rest of the night and normally I'm a wing lover. My husband didn't have any problems ;) Next time I will be finding a recipe that calls for baking.

We use this recipe all the time but it was a little salty so we started using unsalted butter in the sauce and it is AMAZING! So delicious!

I usually don't like hot wings but I make them for my family. These wings were so great I even loved them. Very crispy and tasty. You can adjust the spices in the flour which I like. I dipped all my wings in the sauce but next time I'm going to experiment with other sauces and maybe some lemon pepper. This recipe has taken the place of my old recipe.

I made these today to try them out before servings them for Super Bowl tomorrow. I never used a deep fryer either so I went out and bought one just to make these. 

Wow! These turned out perfect! Very crispy, very tasty and everybody loved them. I'll have no problems serving these tomorrow. Thanks for an awesome recipe.

Maybe it was because I used big chicken legs ( it was all I had on hand) and because I baked these following another reveiwer's directions, but these didn't taste like wings from a restraurant at all. Not even the sauce. I might try this again using small wings and frying them next time. But these were a waste of hot sauce.

This is still excellent and others I have shared it with always agree. I deep fry mine in a covered,  stove top wok. Make sure you take the time to let them chill as described. I make a large advance flour mix and store it in a jar in the fridge. When I am ready, a few tea spoons in a sandwich bag with tumbling does the trick. I make a single serving (five wings) and so I cut the sauce volume by 1/2. I pour the sauce over in a wide open bowl and tumble for even coverage. Remove them and set aside to rest and dry. Then throw my rice in the bowl and toss that to use up the remaining sauce. mmmm!

A regular at our house. So easy to make especially for my husband. We love using drummettes and wings. For the sauce, we mix it with red wine vinegar and use louisiana wing sauce to the butter.

De-licious!!  I added a bit of chili powder to the flour mixture, and I only deep fried them for 6 minutes, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  They turned out perfectly and my husband says they were amongst the best he'd ever tasted!  Thank you for posting!

I used Franks Red Hot sauce for these wings and added a bit of extra cayenne as well. Loved the flavour.. will try other types of hot sauce next time. Instead of frying these, i baked them in the oven until nice and crisp..however, the `crisp`coating wasn`t so crisp after adding the sauce to it. So next time i will follow the same steps and then bake in the oven for a few minutes to crisp them back up.

These were great.!! Due to my own negligance unfortunatly I didnt have much oil on hand to fry . After they sat in the fridge for an hour I placed them on an oiled baking sheet and brushed each one with oil with a pastry brush and baked for about 50 minutes at 400  Then I tossed them with the butter and red hot kids loved them a keeper Thank you

Wow! I didn't have chicken wings so I cut up some chicken to make chicken tenders and amazing! I fried them as per the recipe and followed everything else exactly. I left them in the fridge for about 90 minutes. I only made this for my husband and I but I will definitely be making this for our next poker night with our friends.

This was a great recipe! Very flavorful and not too spicy. I left the chicken in the fridge for 3 hours to chill (only because I had to run out and do errands) and it worked out great. Looking forward to making this for a group of people during this football season.

These did NOT work out for me. The sauce was a mixture of an oily/chunky mess, and there certainly wasn't enough to coat the wings. I won't be trying this again, but thanks Kelly.

This is very close to how I make my wings. Only change I do is to double everything but the butter and add two tbsp. of homemade ranch dressing. Perfect amount of spices and not too buttery. I don't fry mine, I bake the wings for 20 minutes until a little crispy turning halfway through, then I toss it with the sauce. I then bake it again for another 12-15 minutes or until crispy. It cuts down on the oilyness. Try it with the ranch.....you'll love it. NOTE: Depending on the size of your wings, you might need to add more or less to soak up some of that sauce. I've found that Costco's wings are a bit bigger than others I've used.

This was the best Buffalo wing recipe I've ever tried. There is absolutely no reason to fry these. I marinated them for 3 hours, then baked them in a pan coated with canola oil at 400 degrees for 1 hour flipping them half way through. They were extremely crunchy and absolutely delicious. UNBELIEVABLE!!!

Instead of deep frying, I used the oven @ 400 degrees, heated a heavy cookie sheet pan, then added about three table spoons of peanut oil, then the wings. baked for 25 - 30 mins, turning them over half way through so they were crispy on both sides. Wings turned out great

Not that this recipe needs any more praise but how could I not?  It is to die for if you like Buffalo Chicken wings.  I marinated mine for about 30 minutes in Louisiana Wing sauce and then added the flour mixture.  I doubled the recipe and since I don't have a deep fryer at the moment I used my electric skillet and it worked just fine.  The sauce turned out great too.  I served it with both the sauce (which I had doubled the recipe) as well as ranch sauce.

I made these wings for the second time for our family get together at xmas and once again a huge hit.I bake the wings at 400 until golden brown and then flip and cook until the other side is golden brown.Tastes just as good if not better than deep frying. Then toss in the hot sauce mixture.I leave a few out of the sauce for those that dont like hot sauce.

Love 'em! My boyfriend said these were the best wings he has ever had (without frying them). I rolled them in flour and spices and let them sit in fridge for 2 hours. I then sprayed a jelly roll pan and sprayed the wings. I baked them at 400 degrees for 45 minutes, turning once. I then broiled them on high for about 5-7 minutes to crisp them up. Tossed with sauce and they were perfect.

Amazing!!!  My family thinks these taste just like the ones at Applebees.  I doubled the recipe, but used 1/3 cup of butter instead of 1/2.  In place of deep frying, I omitted the flour and baked them at 425 degrees for 45 minutes.  I also used Frank's Red Hot sauce.  Delicious!

These were fantastic!  My husband is a very picky about his buffalo wings, and these were wonderful!!  Most definitely use Frank's Hot Sauce, it makes all the difference!

Another great thing, I made them exactly as listed.  My husband likes them hotter, so he just added more Hot Sauce directly to his.  My kids don't like the heat, so I pulled theirs out before adding the hot sauce / butter mixture, and we were all as happy as clams!!!

Thanks so much for sharing this wonderful recipe!

We made these 'boneless' with bite-sized chicken breast nuggets, and they were a huge hit at our party! Make plenty, they'll go fast!

This was a HUGE HIT for our first Non-Traditional Christmas Eve Dinner.  I made the recipe just as given with the exception of using precut boneless chichen breast to speed up the preparation, grilled, then shredding them.  Everyone loved it and just for fun I put a few sauces to go with it, Raspberry, Bluecheese, and Ranch.  Everyone wanted to take the leftovers home with them and I was left with some dirty dishes and a Big SMILE ! If you CAN save any they are great cut up and served in a salad the next day. I'll do this one again and again!

Ok, well Husband is enthusiastically scoffing these down as I type... I'm no fan of wings but he is, and he says they are defintely 5 stars! I followed others' advice and baked them for about 45mins @ 350f (turning and basting halfway through), then turned the heat up to 400f for 10mins, basting halfway through. Awesome recipe! Thanks so much, Kelly!

Excellent!  I was really surprised because I am not a huge fan of buffalo wings.  I did everything as directed except for adding more garlic to the sauce.  Next time I may add more hot sauce to the sauce because we like things spicy.  Also I didn't have the 60 - 90 minutes needed to refrigerate the wings, so I just put them in the freezer for a while.  I didn't understand why no hot sauce brand was specified, so I just used Texas Pete because it's our favorite.  This recipe is definitely a keeper!

Second review.  i think this should just plain be outlawed. Know how some folks stash chocolate and sweets? i wanted to keep a stash of these! i think we have had these almost once a week all year since i first tried this recipe. Hubby continues to say wings are to much effort for the resultant bite or two of meat, but shamelessly begs for these. It's one of the few ways He likes chicken.  Don't try this as a heart healthy way of cooking- and never ever let anyone start eating till the cook gets dibs- they will be all gone.

These wings are very good and are definitely restaurant-quality! They have a nice kick but are not what I would consider hot; they're more tangy. My only suggestion for improvement is to season the wings with salt before dredging in flour mixture.

My family loves this dish! Kelly is right, the sauce is the secret. Oh, soooo good! I've done this 3 times already. After each time my son always ask when I will make it again. This is from a boy who would rather eat school lunch than my cooking! Should give you an idea how easy and yummy this recipe is!

Married to a Buffalo native, I was a bit skeptical that anything could compare to the "original" Buffalo wings.  These turned out to be a great at-home alternative for wing night!!!  I followed the recipe exactly and we opted to cook them in a turkey deep fryer, we use outside.  I prefer this to indoor frying as there is no "fried food" smell lingering in the house, and it's quicker & less messy. They are great wings and we have served them at parties here many times.  I usually play with recipes and put my own spin on things, but this is a keeper just as it is!

I thought this was going to turn out amazing after reading all the reviews. I baked it vs frying and did everything according. Now im wishing I had just used a shake in bake instead of wasting all that chicken.

OMG, so good!  My husband LOVED them!  Another day, I also did them with chicken breasts, to be like boneless buffalo wings & they were also delicious!  I did not fry them.  I used a big cookie sheet lined with foil & used my wire cookie rack and placed the wings/breasts on there in the oven.  Will always make wings this way now.  THANK YOU!

Great crispy coating but it needed more spices.  I added 1/4 tsp. garlic powder and black pepper, increased the cayenne pepper.

Awesome! Made for hubby and he sad "these are off the hook".. That means wonderful.  I did marinate in EEVO, paprika, garlic powder and pepper for an hour prior to following the recipe. Fried in Crsco shortening. Wings were crispy outside and juicy inside!

We made these for Superbowl Sunday...they were fantastic and really easy.  I rinsed the wings with lemon and let it soak for about five minutes before coating with flour to help tenderize the meat.  Followed the recipe to a T.   Yum!

Being born and raised in Buffalo,32 years now,It's a pet peeve of mine when people call chicken wings Buffalo style,there's only one way we make them here in Buffalo that we would consider a true "buffalo" wing style and in my years of being in the military traveling around the world, I have NEVER seen a true recipe anywhere that is true to its form,please stop calling them Buffalo wings if you don't know how to truly make them right,I don't care what a chain restaurant calls them because its not correct,you want a true style get them from a local place in Buffalo

I'm so happy. This recipe was awesome. I eat healthy all the time so I went ahead and fried these wings. I made two batches, spicy for me with Franks Red Hot Sauce and Plain for my sensitive hubby. He did eat two of mine though. This was so easy. Isn't it funny to get so excited about such a simple recipe. Love it.

These are SO good! I followed the recipe for the most part except I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts cut up. The only thing I would change is I would make more of the sauce mixture...the messier, the better! :) Fabulous recipe, though! Definitely a keeper for my wing lovin family!

My husband and I made these wings for lunch today and we were very impressed. I can honestly say this will be a recipe we continue to use over and over again. We didn't have cayenne pepper, so we didn't use that, and it still came out perfect. We used Bufalo hot sauce (in the Mexican food section) because unfortunately Franks isn't available here, and the sauce came out great. Even my kids liked it (sans sauce), which says a lot. Thank you for posting the recipe!

These are great and I would not change a thing. I could not believe how the sauce soaked into the wings and yet they were still crispy.  I was skeptical about putting the sauce on them because I prefer a dry rub over a wet sauce but after lightly tossing the wings in the sauce right after frying them the sauce soaked in and had the consistency more of a dry rub.  YUM, Thanks for the great recipe.

Even though we are not huge wing fans, decided to try this anyway. Unfortunately, we are still not wing fans.

Couldn't believe how easy it was to make wings that taste just like the famous restaurant chain's. You can play around with the sauce to make all different flavors - one I just tried that came out good was 1/4 cup melted butter with a tsp or 2 of garlic powder, toss with the cooked wings and then add 1/4 cup parmesan cheese, tossing again

Really good and easy.  The ingredients for sauce does only make enough for about 10-12 wings, so I had to double it.  The cooking time for frying the wings was way off.  Mine only needed to be in the grease for about 5 minutes.  Very good.

Fantastic, I used paprika, garlic powder, salt, pepper, & morrocan seasoning in the flour.  I used nando's peri peri hot sauce as we have a limited selection in Australia.  Really delish and crunchy.

WOW! These are AWESOME! They taste just like Applebees! The only thing I did different was use boneless chicken breasts cut into strips. My fiance loves boneless wings, so I bought a six pack of boneless, skinless breasts and used those instead. They still turned out just fine. I fried the chilled strips on the stove top in light olive oil instead of deep frying them and sprayed Pam on them while they were cooking. They turned out crispy and delicious! Thank you for this recipe! LOVE IT!

Better than chillis. I'm not an experienced cook and it still came out great. By the way margarine worked better than butter for me.

Delicious even without the sauce.  i would make the sauce separately or else the chicken will lose its crisp.  you can also try making this recipe with different sauces.

I have made this several, several times and every time it is a huge success. I use Frank's Hot Sauce and I am very free with the seasonings as my family loves hot foods. They love it and there are never any left overs.

I used this recipe almost exactly to make vegan Buffalo tofu. Cut extra firm tofu into one inch cubes and soak them in vegetable broth. Make the Buffalo sauce by substituting vegan margarine. Make the breading the same way then coat the pieces. I pan fried them and they came out great! I served them with spinach, celery, and vegan blue cheese dressing on a tomato Basil wrap. So good!

Very easy to make and works great without battering. (Trying to cut calories wherever I can) They were a major hit for my backyard BBQ and everyone thought I purchased them from the specialty wing shop.  I sometimes add a few freshly chopped cloves of garlic and chopped hot pepper to the sauce for an extra kick. Works really well!

The breading on these wings are AMAZING. The sauce came out perfectly as well. I threw in a dash of Lawry's seasoning salt and seasoning pepper into the sauce as well. I used Tony Roma's wing sauce for the hot sauce. My boyfriend is a major wing aficionado-- and a big critic! But he absolutely loved these, and just about finished them! I also baked for about 45 minutes instead of deep frying. I followed other reviewers' suggestions to add a bit more flour and spray with cooking spray. The baking results were TOO GOOD for me to every try deep frying them. YUM! Never buy wings again!

I am not much of a wings type of person but my husband is and he LOVED them. In fact he ate them all up in about 3 minutes.  I baked instead of fried as others suggested.  I coated them in the flour mixture and sprayed them with Pam.  I adjusted the amount of hot sauce to suit our taste buds (slowly adding hot sauce to the butter and tasting it until it was perfect).  Then I spooned it over the wings.  With the remaining butter/hot sauce mixture I mixed in with ranch dressing for a ridiculously yummy dipping sauce (not too healthy for you though).  Definitely as good as restaurant style quality.   Thanks for the recipe!

My husband and I don't use the deep fryer...ever...but we decided to break it out and try these highly rated wings just for fun.  We were blown away by the taste--better than any wings we've had at a restaurant.  We will be making these again...and again...and again!

Love this and it's super simple!  We don't eat a lot of meat in our house and I don't eat any, but I've made this using fish, such as tilapia, haddock as well as shrimp.  The only thing that I would recommend is to be careful to not let the butter separate when making the sauce.  It looks so much better.

Absolutely delicious..if sauce too spicy try a couple of tbs honey to soften taste. Definitely deep fry.

This recipe produces some amazing hot wings! The only real change I made was in how I cooked the wings. I'm not a fan of the smell that deep frying makes (or the fact that it tends to linger for DAYS), so I used this technique to ensure the skin got just as crispy, with the meat just as tender and moist: If you've seen Good Eats, Alton Brown does a show on wings, where he explains how to "oven fry" the wings. The night before, you take a 6 to 8 qt pot, and one steamer basket per 10 wings (I usually make about 40 at a time... They go fast, so I have 4 steamer baskets). Stack the baskets one on top of the other, and arrange your wings, 10 on each teir. Add 1 inch of water to the pot over high heat, bring to a boil, then add the wings, and steam them for 10 minutes. Remove the wings and pat them COMPLETELY dry. Lay the wings out on a cooling rack set in a half sheet pan lined with paper towels and place in the refrigerator overnight. The next night, dip each of the wings in buttermilk to dampen them slightly, and follow the recipe, baking at 425 for about 20 mins on each side, or until your wings are cooked through and are a beautiful crispy golden brown. Enjoy! :)

Almost exactly how we used to cook them in Buffalo.  The trick to keeping them crispy is to let the wings sit in the basket above the hot oil for a couple of minutes before placing in the sauce.  The heat draws the oil out of the wings better than paper towels.  Put them in the sauce until covered, then remove imediately.

I finally made this and it did turn out really great. Tasted restaurant quality. Added extra cayenne pepper to flour mixture & Frank's Red Hot to sauce (we like it spicier). Good recipe, next time will add more flour to wings so the batter is a little thicker. Don't leave out the refridgerator step, makes the flour sticky and is essential for a crispy finish. I served these with homemade blue cheese dip & carrot/celery sticks. With a few adjustments, is a great recipe. Will make again.

I baked my wings at higher temp to get crispy (can't remember exact temp but probably around 375 or 400 degrees) instead of deep frying them and they were outstanding!  Making again for the Superbowl this coming weekend.

What oh what did I do wrong.  I baked these wings exactly according to other rave reviews.  I started with frozen wings and perhaps that was my first mistake.  In the end these wings were slimy and greasy and awful.  The batter never crisped up even after spraying with cooking oil.  I was sad.

I just got back from Florida and I learned a new wing trick.  I went to this sports bar and they had the best wings ever.  They were not quite as messy, and were a lot more flavorful.  I asked the waitress why, and she said that they grill the wings after they fry and sauce them.  I tried this with these and they were even better than the ones I tried down there.  Just two minutes on each side after you put the sauce on them.

This recipe is a staple for us.  We love to serrve it for parties and football.
To make it a bit health:
boneless chicken breasts cut into cubes
place into mixture of flour, salt, pepper, paprika, garlic powder and pepper.
Place chicken in a colander and a bowl below,pour mixture over the chicken, cover and shake.
Bake the coated chicken in a sprayed cooking pan for twenty minutes.  After coat the chicken with the sauce and return to the oven for 15 minutes.

Some say flour shouldn't touch the wings, but it did enhance the crispiness of the skin.Delicious sauce, just the right amount of kick!

These were awesome! I used boneless skinless chicken breast cut into bite-sized pieces but other than that followed the recipe. It was fabulous! For less heat but still great flavor I used Texas Pete's Buffalo Wing Sauce. If we're having Buffalo Wings - it's gonna be with this recipe from now on!

Hubby rated these 4 1/2, but he rarely gives a five if ever. Myself and the kids rated it 5*. I used extra mild sweet chilli sauce with honey so the kids could eat it. I also lined a tray and placed the fried wings on top and spooned over the sauce, baking in the oven for 15 minutes on high heat. Delicious and tangy. Great recipe and worth trying.

These wings were just o.k.  Nothing special.  The sauce was just o.k.  My husband who is a HUGE wing lover wasn't that impressed.  We'll leave these for the pubs to make.

Best recipe for wings.  My husband loves these!  I used the suggestions of the other reviews and dip them in egg and the flour mixture first and put in the refrigerator for about an hour.  Then I do the process again. I follow the rest of the directions as stated.  Very tasty

I always read the reviews first to see what changes I should make to a recipe before doing it in hopes to making the best recipe possible.
For this recipe I breaded the wings in flour and spices and baked at 400 for 45 minutes. For the sauce I used less butter about 1/4 cup and added my favorite buffalo wings hot sauce, cayenne, chilli peppers, red pepper, black pepper, garlic powder, and 2 cloves of crushed garlic. I premade the sauce during the day and put it in the fridge to make it a tad thicker which worked. After the wings were cooked I dipped them in the sauce and baked for another 15 minutes at 250 and then brushed some more sauce on them putting them in the oven under the broiler to crisp them some more, but watch it, they will burn fast!
My husband liked the recipe, he didn't rave about it, but said it was good and told me to make them again sometime.  I liked them too but found they were missing something in the spice department, I could've made them hotter, but there was definatly some spice that was missing and can't figure what it is.  I found them quite easy to make. I made them with my homemade pizza turnovers and ceasar salad and called it a junk food night.

This recipe is great. I thought it would be bland since the wings are not marinated, but as long as you have a lot of sauce on them, it really doesn't need marinating. The sauce was fantastic, but I added a little more of the hot sauce to make it hotter (Frank's). The crispiness was perfect. I really didn't expect them to come out so good.

We had these tonight for dinner and they were very good!  I toned down the spiciness a bit (only used a dash of cayenne, as opposed to the 1/4 tsp) because I have young kids, but they still had a little zip to them.  My picky 5 year old LOVED them!  I found that the sauce didn't stick to the wings very well and was pretty runny, but I am pretty sure that was human error on my part and nothing having to do with the recipe.  These weren't quite what I expected, but overall were really good.  I will be making them again!

I really liked these.  They came out crunchy and the sauce is just right.  Next time I would make more sauce though because theres just enough to evenly coat each chicken wing, and I like mine saucy!

Very good.. all depends on sauce so shop wisely.  I didn't have a deep fryer, used a skillet for cooking so it took about twice as long, but the chicken was perfect.

One of my favorite recipies from this site. The whole family is crazy over these. When I ask what's for dinner? all I hear is "hot wings". Thanks for the recipie I'm the Wing Queen in this house. I make half the sauce the way the recipie calls- for my husband and oldest son and then the other half I make with more butter and half the hot sauce and it tones it down a little for the rest of us. I even leave some plain so good and crispy!

I used to cook for a bar and this was the recipe I used!  These are AWESOME!  Or as some of my customers said "Off the chain"  I had people that came in for 25 cent day and bought us out!  One lady purchased 96 wing portions!  I have fried them at the bar and baked some at home and transported them and then let them simmer in the sauce, both ways are fantastic.  The baked ones fell off the bones and the meat was really saturated with the great sauce and it had fewer calories even with all that butter that's in the sauce.  These are without a doubt the best wings I have ever had.  Thanks for sharing.

I seasoned the wings with black pepper, garlic powder, paprika, cayenne pepper, seasoning salt and a pinch of salt. I sprayed the wings with cooking spray. Then I baked the wings @ 400 for 2 hours. It was great with or without the hot sauce mixture. I have more baking in the oven right now!!

Great Wings!! Will definitely be using this recipe again.  In addition to the recipe I added a small amount of rice vinegar to the buffalo sauce to make the wings somewhat medium in intensity.

I knew this recipe was a winner when my brother took a bite and asked me which brand of wing sauce I bought and for a half hour my family spoke about how it tasted like I ordered them from our nearby pub!  I justed added a tablespoon of distilled vinegar and followed the recipe. Thanks Kelly! A Must try recipe for super bowl....

These are our ALL TIME FAVORITE wings! These are by far the best of the best! We add a lot more cayenne, but then again we are hard core wing fans. These are every bit as good as what you would buy out! Do NOT skip the coating and then refrigeration process. We have a GE fryer that accomodates about 8 or 9 wings and once the temperature is at 375 or 380 they take about 7 minutes to fry up. To coat with marinade after frying we put the wings in a tupperware container with some of the sauce and shake away; this seems to give a very good coating. This recipe is a keeper. I really appreciate you being so unselfish to post and share this recipe here.

Well, it's been many years since my  last review of this recipe and many more since my first review. My son now is now a combat engineer in the Forces. Still, when he comes home we all have a wing night. All his original friends still come over and now new ones too. Last weekend there were 14 guests, over 200 wings went down...this sure is becoming a tradition! I have made a change tho. Not to the recipe... but to how I serve them. Being a wing addict [along with a slight addiction to all good food in general] I love my wings CRISP--soggy wings suck!. Now, I think I have attained the crispiest. --After following the recipe to a tee I serve the wings hot out of the frier in a heated bowl[s]..no cover on. I put the heated hot sauce, in as many small  bowls as needed to serve the guests.[no double dipping!] They can take a few wings at a time & spoon the sauce on, as much as they like. Eat then repeat. The wings don't get a chance to get soggy !! All I can say is that this has been my recipe for wings for at least 6-7 years and now they are CRISPY! Again, many thanks Kelly. PS I do cut back on the butter and add a bit of dry minced oinion [bulk store] to the sauce when it's served. Be adventurous and add a little powdered fennel to the sauce when cooking it!! { I guess I did change the recipe a bit lol}

Been making these for a while. They were a hit at a Superbowl party.  I throw the wings/flour combo in a ziplock, shake it up and stick it in the fridge. Don't omit the fridge step. I normally use less butter than listed, and I use different proportions of Frank's Red Hot sauce, butter, garlic powder and cayenne depending on the heat level requested.  Milder = more butter no cayenne. Hotter is less butter, more cayenne.

I made these for my boyfriend and his friends on SuperBowl Sunday.  I think I made around 75 wings, and by the time I was done with the last batch and had cleaned up a little bit, ALL of them were gone.  I think they saved me one...  I love to cook and I am constantly trying out new things on my boyfriend, but this is the ONLY thing he has asked for again.  And again. And again.  Aaaand again.

This is a good wing recipe although I found the flour coating to be a bit thicker than I liked. I made the following adaptations: baked at 450 for 15 min., then turned over for another 5 or so; dipped the chicken in milk before drenching in flour to produce the "stickiness" other authored mentioned instead of leaving it in the fridge for an hour, I also put in one packet of McCorrmick wing packet with my flour to add to the seasonings, and reduced the butter to 1/8 cup. Overall great taste, and fairly healthy if cooked in the oven with the butter reduced. Yumm!

Everyone in our family loves these!!! You can also do boneless wing version using chicken breast cut into cubes or strips. The key is the flour has to sit on the wings for at least an hour in the refridgerator. They are super!!! Thank you!

for the firs time making buffalo wings- this was a great start! i am not at all unhappy with how these turned out. i'll attempt them again, because cooking them any longer than stated will make them tough (oops... i am new at the deep fryer!). only reason this is a 4/5 for me- the butter to hot sauce ratio was off. i only used 1/8 cup butter and that was PLENTY! any more, and butter would have overpowered the hot sauce and made it more greasy/taste funny. 
not sure why so many reviews kept saying the wings didn't have enough flavor spice-wise... most of the flavor comes from the sauce, and how can you taste any other spices if you've added the full amount of butter & hot sauce?! i also disagree with everyone who is complaining with how these 'aren't the real thing'... obviously, the only way you are going to get the restaurant wings is to go to the actual restaurant and buy them!! if you don't feel like doing that, then keep trying and adjusting this or different recipes until you find something similar and close enough. sorry- but you aren't going to get what the restaurant's tastes like unless you've worked there and know the exact recipe and process... don't complain because what you made didn't match! this recipe was a really good one and i personally find homemade better than what you'd get anywhere else- you can adjust and make it your own to your own taste preferences! thanks for the share! this is a keeper. :)

I absolutely love this recipe!! I love wings and they can get expensive so Im so glad I found this recipe. Ive tried baking and frying and they both turned out great, but the frying option gives the wings a crispy finish. I also add 2 tbsp of ranch to the hot sauce and butter mix, mmmmm!! Also, Franks is by far the best hot sauce!! I have not ordered wings since i've started making these and I probably wont need to. Another option I've tried was boneless. I bought chicken tenderloins and made it the same way, however the fried boneless were the best. My children also love this recipe, but for them I just dont pour on the hot sauce. They eat theirs plan or dip it in ranch.

I will first say that I live near Buffalo, NY so I know what a Buffalo Chicken Wing should taste like.  We never flour them prior to frying, baking is out of the question, and Franks Hot Sauce is a must.  While these were good, they are NOT Buffalo Chicken Wings.

I made this for my boyfriend who is crazy over buffalo wings and hence is picky about it. So I'm so proud that HE LOVES THIS! I followed the recipe and all went well. The only change was a lot more of all spices as both of us love them ultra spicy. I also added cayenne pepper sauce and Tabasco. Yum!

Oh, I'm not sure if it made any difference. But I squeeze my wings dry using kitchen tower before coating them with flour mix. They turned out to be really, really crispy outside and still juicy inside!

I was disappointed with these wings.  I did bake them and realize they would be best fried but the coating was nothing special.  For those of you who bake them I did it at 400 for 60 minutes; I took them out at 45 but still pink; my wings were fat.  The sauce, nothing special either.  I would use  Hot Wings sauce by Franks, it's zippier and no butter.  I was using this more for the wings than the sauce.  I think like another rater that Shake and Bake would have worked just as well.

To the flour mixture i added 1/4 tsp garlic powder, 1/4 tsp onion powder, and 1/4 tsp black pepper. 
I cooked them in the oven under the broiler for 15 to 20 min turning half way and basted them with butter. Then i made a sweet and sour bbq sauce. They were so good I'm making them again today.

These are the best wings ever. Whenever I make them they come out fantastic! The key to these wings is the refrigeration. It's a must, and if you can do it at least an hour but the hour and a half makes them even better. I've fried these wings without putting them in the fridge and they didn't have the lasting cripiness that I've noticed since I've started refrigerating the wings prior to frying. Me and my entire family love these wings.

These were so good! I love that the recipe didn't call for eggs either...only because I didn't have any leftover from Easter. I fried them in my mini fry daddy for about 8-9 min. and I was worried that they were going to be overcooked, but once I tossed them into the sauce (I used a bottle instead of the sauce recipe) they were perfect.

Extremely delicious.  Added about 1 tbsp of Chili powder and a tsp of thyme to the flour mixture.  Other than that, didn't change a thing.
Also made a delicious dill dip for them.  They really are restaurant quality.  A keeper for sure.

Finally a rave review from my picky husband.  He just told me he would never have to go anywhere to eat wings again.  These were very, very good!!!  I am not a huge wing fan but even I thought they were good.  And the equal parts hot sauce and butter really make a sauce that anyone can eat.  A little heat, not too much.  Overall an excellent recipe.  This one's going in the permanent file!

Like many others, I preferred baking the wings - at 375 for 20 minutes, then turned it over and continued for another 15 minutes. It could have been baked a bit longer to make it crispier, but it was great anyways! Used stir-fry sauce, not hot sauce as that's what I had. Still turned out wonderful! The whole family loved it!

I thought this recipe was very bland. I even attempted to make a second batch and doctor it up and found I would rather stick with the packets in the store.

These are awesome!! I have made them in the oven & in my deep fryer. Both ways are good, but deep fried is better!! I use more butter to hot sauce ratio to turn down spice. I also melt the butter/hot sauce mixture in the microwave. Whole family LOVES these!

Delicious!  I refridgerated them for 4 hours and fried them in peanut oil.  Wait to add the sauce until right before serving so that they stay crispy.  After a while they will lose their crispiness, but still taste delicious.  They got rave reviews.  I will definitely be making these again.

Wonderful! I do believe that the only way to make these is to use Texas Pete hot sauce. It just doesn't take the same without it!! made this probably 20 times, and plan to keep making it. I have also made this using boneless chicken breasts.

I make these all the time during football season and they are by far a crowd favorite!  I read some other reviews and bake them for 45 minutes at 350, then I broil them for a few minutes so they get nice and crispy.  Serve with celery and blue cheese dressing!  I'll never buy wings at a restaurant again.

These were by far the best and easiest wings I have ever made.  I have never fried wings before, I usually bake them, so I wasn't sure how my frying skills were but this was so easy.  I added a little more flavor to the flour mixture- garlic powder, onion powder, pepper and salt. I refridgerated them for about 2hrs fried them up  in a deep frying pan until golden brown and drained them on a paper towel.  Tossed with hot sauce, a done! Even the kids loved them(4 and 6yrs). I made a home made blue cheese dip to go with it. This was literally the easiest from scratch meal I have ever made! Thanks for recipes will definately be making this again!

These were incredible especially for my first time making hot wings. I added pepper, garlic and onion powder to the flour mixture. I refrigerated for 2 hours. I fried in my deep fryer till crisp, then drained on paper towels.  I used Srirahcha hot sauce in the butter mix and topped the wings with the sauce and then gently mixed with a spoon to get them evenly coated. My hubby and friends said they were the best wings they had ever had!

These were really good. I've made them twice, and two things stand out to me now. 1. DO NOT skip the 60-90 minutes rest in the fridge. This is what gives the wings their crispiness. 2. The hot sauce makes the difference. I like Texas Pete for a standard buffalo wing hot sauce. I have used a lemon pepper sauce, a Thai ginger sauce, and a cilantro lime sauce. All good, but something about that Texas Pete can't be beat! Also, make sure your oil is hot enough before you start to cook. If it's too cool, you'll lose some of the crisp when you cook up  the wings. Good recipe that has been added to my "Sports weekend cookbook".

I also chose to bake them but I used a little canola oil on the bottom of the dish because I didn't have pam to spray on. I wasn't sure how much oil to use but I used enough to lightly cover the bottom. I could've used less since there was actually enough oil for 2 batches. They were so good!!!

Great recipe.   I had no wings so I used drumsticks and chicken thighs and it came out fantastic.   I didn't have time to let them sit for more than 10 mins in the fridge with the flour mixture (football game going on), but it didn't seem to make a differenece and they came out great.  I will make these again.!

These are fabulous. Hubby loved. The only change I made was to sprinkle some garlic powder and season salt directly on the chicken before adding the flour. So good they make you never want to buy hot wings out again!!!

These were probably the best hot wings I've had, restaurants included. The only changes I made was that I added butter to the [franks] hot sauce and some dried parsley and cilantro flakes to the flour mix. These are delicious!! Crispy on the outside and flaky on the inside. Highly recommended!!  Also, I wouldn't recommend baking these, they just don't taste as good.  I'd know because I baked (then broiled) half the batch and fried the other half.  Fried was WAYYYYYY better.

This was a great recipe! I actually used chicken drumsticks because that was all I had, but they turned out delicious nonetheless! I decided to be a little bit healthier and baked them instead of frying. I used a suggestion from someone else to spray the chicken with Pam the last 5 minutes of cooking to get the crispy texture. It was really great! I didn't have cayenne pepper, so I just used more paprika, and I also added garlic powder to the flour mixture in addition to adding it to the sauce. The dipping sauce was excellent. My boyfriend was very impressed...next time I will just have to make more, as we both scarfed them down rather quickly!

Excellent recipe!!!  I added a touch of Johnnys Seasoning in the flour  dredge but basically stuck to the recipe.  No need to bake as the coating seals the chicken and adds minimal grease absorption.  Will make again and again!  Best wings I have ever made.  Thanks for the wonderful wings!!

Perfect recipe.  I used canola oil and vegetable oil and noticed no difference.  I like them extra extra crispy so just when you think they are done, leave them in another 2 minutes.  I can tell because parts of the wings will be a very dark brown.  Take them out of the oil briefly put on a paper towel then throw them in a bowl with the sauce.  As for the sauce, after I heated it on the stove, I put it in the fridge for 10 minutes to thicken it.

I've never make chicken wings before- always gone out for them. I just got a fryer so I thought I'd give it a try. These were really good. I'd definately make them again!

Excelente, we enjoyed these very much, served with ranch dressing, I think I might put a little honey in the sauce the next time I make them, a little sweet/hot might be nice, but this recipe as is, will be a keeper. I did the fry in a Le Cruset dutch oven with lid on very crispy, just terrific.Thanks for sharing.

Amazingly good! I added 1/4 cup of flour and doubled the cayenne and paprika to add more zing to it. Used sweet chili sauce with the hot sauce to tone down the hotness but it was still real HOT!!! my husband loved it!

Oh my goodnesss!!!  I can't even order hot wigs at restaurants bacause they can't match how great these are!  I get requests for these wings for every football party!  I will say that these do not save well...but you won't have to worry about that, since they'll be long gone!

Fabulous!  My husband LOVES this.  I also followed another reviewers suggestion and use more hot sauce for hotter wings and more butter for milder wings.  These have become a staple at our football parties!

I did a boneless wing version of this and since i dont have a deep fryer, i did these in a frying pan on the stove.  I didnt change the recipe at all and they were really good.  My boyfriend said if hed have known we could make them at home, we would have saved tons on eating them out!

Wonderful! Usually I don't like hot wings that much but these were the perfect amount of spice. I used cookies hot sauce and we ran out so fast that I had to make a second batch. I agree with everyone about putting them in the fridge for an hour. It is worth the wait!

very good but next time I think I will up the spice & cut back on the butter because it had quite a luscious mouthfeel that I wish was a bit cleaner.

Making this recipe for dinner tonight and just figured out that I had never reviewed it.  I have made this recipe many times and my family loves these wings.  Make sure you follow the recipe to coat the wings and put in fridge for 90 minutes.  It makes the wings so crispy and yummy!!  Thanks for sharing!!

i just made these vegan and they were awesome!  i froze a package of extra firm tofu for 72 hours to give it a meatier texture, then defrosted it in the fridge, took it out of the container, drained it, squeezed out the water, and placed it between plates with paper towels until it had most of the moisture out.   then i followed this recipe to a t, switching out the butter for vegan margarine. these are AMAZING.

Man, these were awesome!  I used drumsticks instead of wings because they have more meat on them.  I tripled the amounts given to make 28 pieces, deep fried in big pots of oil as I don't have a deep fryer, cooked for appx. 18-20 minutes.  Worked just fine.  Tripling the sauce amounts didn't quite cover all the drumsticks, but almost.  Came out so good the guys were sucking on the bones after eating them!  A bit of work, but sooooo worth it.  Thanks!

Great!  I followed the recipe exactly this time.  I wonder if there is any way to "hold" them for a party so they maintain crispiness?

These are good but would not give a 5 star. Breading on the chicken is good for the boneless wings but did not like on bone in wings at all. I am a wing lover a very surprised that it has 5 stars, went back to my original recipe for bone in wings, but I do use this for boneless wings.

My husband said for me to tell you "he gained six lbs. that day."  LOL  He really enjoyed them and couldn't stop talking about the "coating" that was on them.  Followed the recipe but added a bit of onion and garlic to the flour mixture.  Next time I will make a few with little bit more salt in the flour (without sauce) for the kids.  Very good!

Awesome recipe!  I knew I would not deep fry the wings...so did some serious reading of the reviews on how to bake them.  Did a practice run earlier in Super Bowl week using boneless breast which turned out delicious.....so on to the wings!  I bought fresh drumettes in the meat section of the supermarket, let them come to room temperature, used the exact amounts of flour, etc. in the recipe, let them sit in the refrigerator for 2 hours, covered a baking pan with parchment paper, baked at 400 degrees, uncovered, for 20 minutes, turned them over, and baked for 20 minutes more. Used Frank's hot sauce, etc.  and a litle less butter than was called for....very, very easy and my husband was quite impressed!

These are delicious.  When my huge family has get togethers I make these.  I make at least one 3# bag so I just triple the recipe.  After I fry all of the wings I put them in a baking pan and then I pour the sauce over them.  I then put then put them in the oven at about 300 degrees and leave them in there for about a half hour.  They can stay in even longer if you like.  The meat is so tender and the sauce so yummy.  People rave about them.

amazing!  I make these nearly every weekend for football/baseball/basketball.  I'm from Boston - we love our sports! :)  I make exactly as written except I bake them as buffalo bites.  I ue a bit of Pam, coat them in the sauce and then bake at 425 for 5 min each side.  Then I broil them about 2.5 min each side - holy cow - the best I have ever had!  Thank you!  Go Pats!

I am sorry to say that after fixing these tonight, I did not care for them at all! The flavor was good, but they were so soggy... I don't think I am going to bread them the next time I make them, if I ever make them again. We are wing lovers in this household, but these were more like Hooter's nasty wings!

Instead of deep frying I baked them.  Rolled them around in the flour mixture then sprayed with Pam and baked for 45 min.  Took them out of the oven tossed with the sauce...Yummo. They are delicious!

This was a Winning recipe on TX/OU game day!!  Lots of flavor and lots of compliments on these.  My first attempt at any Buffalo style wings/drums.  I did use the drums because I wanted more meat.  Baked instead of frying to cut out the extra fat and calories.  I did coat the chicken drums with buttermilk first and sifted with the flour mixture  for a lighter crust. As many have suggested, I did let them sit 60 mins. in the fridge before putting them in the oven-I think this was the key to the finished texture.  They crisped up nice in the oven and then I coated with the sauce and let them crisp up again in the oven for a few minutes.  Also repeated the sauce and let them crisp up one more time.  Absolutely perfect texture and taste. Used less butter and more Franks Hot Sauce.  Easy to make and fun to share!

Sauce is spot on but forget the flour and the high calorie deep frying - bake wings at 350 degrees turning once until good and crisp on both sides (little over an hour if from frozen state) sprinkle with a little salt, garlic powder and pepper, then cover with the wing sauce.  Just as good and way less fat.

This recipe was GREATNESS!  I have to admit that the sauce was a little thin and messy, but I think it's because all I had was a cheap off brand hot sauce, so I'm going to try to remember to get a better brand the next time I make them.  Also, the meat was a little greasier than I like but that was due to the fact that I deep fried them so I'm going to try to bake them next time instead.  Either way, the process is 100% perfect, they breaded efficiently and their presentation is that of the kind you get at a restaurant. ***FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO LIKE THE GARLIC PARMESAN FLAVORED WINGS*** -bread them with flour, garlic powder and a little salt and the sauce is simply butter, garlic powder, black pepper and about 3 tbs of powdered Parmesan cheese.  THEY ARE TO DIE FOR!!  Enjoy.

These are great wings, I did bake them instead of frying however.  The secret really is in letting them sit for at least an hour after you flour them.  I will make these again and again.

Authentic buffalo wing flavor; cooked two batches: one fried and one baked. Same sauce, side-by-side taste test and the baked won hands-down. They got crispy when sprayed with oil, baked at 375 for about 40-45 minutes, turning occasionally and dipped in sauce twice during the last half of cooking. Very good!

It's crazy how much I have taken from this site and have never given back, just sad actually. So yes, with this recipe, having over 1000 reviews, I am sure everything I am about to add has already been mentioned, But wings with a cold brew, well, they are my favorite nights..  A) Step 1 and step 2 are completely reversed. I don't know why you would want hot oil and hot sauce that only has to be warmed enough to melt butter to sit on the stove for at least 1.5 hours while you have wings sitting in the fridge.   B) I have made this recipe exactly about half a dozen times, altering it many times over. And it is really in the hot sauce you use. Good thing is, even in southern Spain, at, ahem, carrefour (sorry), I can find a good Louisiana hot sauce. Would I use straight out Tabasco, well no I wouldn't, I know for sure - as I haven't tried.  C) Which leads me to adding ingredients not mentioned, that would change the recipe, so I wont, I will on the other hand address method. You will end up with more of either the flower mixture which is good if you are looking for really breaded restaurant wings, or more hot sauce, which is less likely. If you find yourself with quite a bit of breading mixture - after 45-60 minutes in the fridge - if you take out the wings and look at them, they will still have dried flower in some spots, but moisture will seep through in others and will be sticky- at this point I double dip the wings in the left-over flower mixture and let stand in the fridge f

My superbowl guests thought these were good. They said the sauce wasn't hot enough so next time I will add more hot sauce and maybe a little less butter. I made the mistake and mixed the first batch in the sauce while the second batch were still cooking which made the breading soggy so wait until they are all done frying and then dip them in the sauce.

I have never made Buffalo Chicken Wings so I was hoping I picked the right recipes and I did!  These turned out great!  Very tasty!  If you like your Buffalo Chicken Wings spicy, I would suggest adding a little more Cayenne pepper.  I accidentally put the 1/2 cup flour that it asked for and then put 1/2 teaspoon of paprika and cayenne pepper until I looked at recipe again and realized it should have been 1/4 teaspoon of paprika and cayenne pepper.  I didn't want to risk the wings being too spicy to eat so I just added another 1/2 cup flour.  Turns out, maybe the 1/2 teaspoon might not have been too much depending on your taste buds.  So I mixed all of the ingredients to coat the wings in and one by one dropped each of the wings into the flour mixture until fully coated and then placed in a separate dish and put in refrigerator. (The recipe makes it seem that you should heat up fryer first and then make sauce which I didn't do until it was time to cook up the wings in step 2. I followed step 2 first and then went back to step 1) Waited the 90 minutes, then put the hot sauce, butter, dash of pepper & garlic (although I will use a little more of each next time) in the sauce pan.  I used the deep fryer as the recipe asked for and set at 375.  Once hot, I started by putting only 5 of the chicken wings in about 2-3 inches of oil.  I cooked for 10 minutes and took out and laid on a plate that had a paper towel on it to catch any grease and then dropped each individually into the hot

Tried it the first time as is! WOW great! My husband and I have experiemented with different flavors, much like our local buffalo wing eatery, GREAT results each time. The secret is following the recipe and refrigerating the wings. Crispy every time! Love this recipe! Thanks for submitting it!

I noticed the instructions are not in the right order. It tells you to heat the oil in the first step. Then in the second step you are to refrigerate your wings for an hour?? What about the oil? Someone needs to fix that!

Excellent - I put the flour coating on very light and they were just crispy enough.  Can't wait to experiment with different sauces on these, although this sauce was excellent.  Thanks.

I will never rate a recipe under 5 stars because I know it takes guts to post a personal recipe; however, I just wanted to share advice form another chef I know.
When adding sauce to wings, place to wings in a paper shopping bag and then add the sauce and shake to evenly coat. This will evenly coat the wings and remove additional grease.

This was so easy. I've always been intimidated by chicken wings at home. But from now on, I'll make my own.

I used whole wheat flour so the breading wasn't thick at all, but it was still great. 

I didn't deep fry them either. Baked at 400 for 30 minutes on a wire rack placed on a cookie sheet. I had the oven fan on just in case, because the fat dripped down from the wire rack on to the sheet and smoked just a TAD. Not bad at all though.

Afterwards I tossed them with Texas Pete/butter mix and another batch in just regular BBQ sauce (Sweet Baby Ray's - so good).

I have been looking for a recipe for great wings, and I have found it!!!  Use Frank's sauce , add more garlic powder and spices to your flour mixture and cook to crisp while in the oil (I used a mix of olive and veg.).  Do NOT skip the refrigeration step and make sure to drain the oil off of your wings or they'll be too greasy for the hot sauce to stick...
can't wait to make them with some boneless tenders!

Bake instead of deep frying, 350 for 45 minutes, then spray with Pam, turn up oven to 375 and bake for 10 more minutes.

Just tried these tonight, as I had bought wings at Costco the other day.  I didn't measure the dry ingredients, just kind of wing'd it (Sorry had to...lol) due to the fact that the size of the package of wings was obviously big!  I did add the garlic powder to the flour, not the sauce, and waited about 90 mins before frying them. These were awesome, as per my 6 yr old, and my husband, who got called to work, and called on his way in, that we better save him some more!  I kind of screwed up the sauce, by adding more butter than Frank's Red Hot sauce.  Too salty as per my husband.  However, I did use a (no-name--loblaws brand) dry rib garlic sauce that I found in the grocery store, that was thicker than the VH sauces, that was amazing!!  Tasted like honey garlic, but without the sweetness. Now the downside was my fryer, only held about 8 wings, but it only took about 15 mins to do each batch...however, it about 7 batches or more to do them all. Will definitely make them again!!!

Very good. One thing with the instructions - #1 and #2 should probably be reversed. You don't want to pre-heat the oil for 90 mins. Besides that, the recipe was easy to follow and tasted delicious.

Amazing recipe!  I was born and raised in Western New York, so I know Buffalo wings. I live in Boston now and these are better than anything I've been able to find here. I did two things differently:   used Frank's Buffalo Wing sauce, for simplicity and easier clean-up. It eliminates the need to make your own sauce by mixing Frank's Red Hot, butter, garlic, etc. It provides nice flavor, but isn't too spicy. Also, I baked the wings AFTER frying them. Fry for 10-12 minutes, then sauce the wings, and finally bake at 350 for 15 minutes. This is the way the bar I worked at in Buffalo did them. It helps the wings soak up the sauce, making them a little crispy again even after you've put the sauce on. It also helps get all the wings to the same temp if you don't have a fryer big enough to cook all the wings at once.

My husband and I made these for his annual Super Bowl party.  They were a big hit.  We doubled the recipe and did half with the cayenne pepper and the other half without for the kids.

These went over so well at a party this weekend.  Tripled the recipe.  Only change: would use 1/3 less butter in the sauce next time and only used drumettes since that's all I could find. We usually don't eat this type of food so was a real treat!  Even tho I sprayed with oil olive they did stick to the foil underneath a bit so I won't use foil next time. I baked them for almost an hour. Very crispy and everyone said they were  better than Hooters!  I'll take that!

These were great! I used boneless skinless breast cut in 1 inch strips, fried about 8 minutes....delish! For the hot sauce used Emrill's Wing Sauce. Will make again!

Very tasty, although I'm not sure I prefer breaded vs. non-breaded wings.  I think I will try non-breaded next time to see what suits our tastes best.  For those who like breading and know they want it, this IS a great breading technique.  We popped the wings in the oven (350) for about 15 mins after tossing with sauce, just to set the sauce a bit since it was very runny on the wings.  I think that actually gave it a little better flavor, too.  Since we had the deep fryer going, we went all out and had onion rings as well (just an fyi...easiest and best recipe for batter is simply half flour/half beer plus salt to taste, and you can thin to suit your tastes for more/less coating).  I think I gained a couple pounds just watching this meal come together...but boy did we ever enjoy it!  Thank you so much for a wonderful recipe! :)

This was a good recipe.  Better than the wings we get here in Vermont but not as good as the real ones that my husband grew up on in New York.  I buy a big package of chicken wings in the meat department and then we cut them up.  We throw away the wing tips (or keep to make broth) and cut at the other joint.  For a variation on the sauce, try equal parts butter, barbecue sauce and hot sauce.  It is a bit milder and just as tasty!

Sorry but too buttery and messy. Didn't like the breading on it as it turned into a oil/flour blob.I think I will stick to the way I make them which is  using a whole bottle of cayenne pepper sauce (or more if not using water). I add half of that bottle in water mixed with 2 TBLS of flour or cornstarch and it add it to the sauce. Add a little garlic powder, black pepper and only one Tablespoon of butter. Heat the mixture until thickened. Pour over baked or plain fried wings and put them in the oven until the sauce dries a little over them.

I don't like spicy foods, but my hubby said these were AWESOME! I sprinkled cayenne on the wings before battering by mistake and he loved them!! Tasted just like they were out of a restaurant!

Most of this recipe is correct. However having been born and raised in Buffalo, I can tell you that the original recipe does not contain flour or any other coating.

First reviewed Feb/07:  Soooo tasty!  I created chicken fingers, not wings.  I will definately make them again. They aren't as spicy as I thought they'd be.  Next time I will try baking them like some of the other posters recommended. reviewed again Aug 09:  I have been making these a lot, and I use 2 big chicken breasts and for the sauce I use Buffalo chicken hot sauce, the butter, and a couple drops of red-hot stuff. Still the *best*.

These were really good.  We used the boneless tenders as others had and fried them.  I think that next time I will egg dredge and double dip in the flour mix.  We used Franks Original Red Hot which was great but I don't think that I got the correct ratio of butter to sauce.  I started with less and added more to taste which seemed to work well.  I would recommend THOROUGHLY coating the wings in the sauce for a good "Full" flavor effect.  I made 4 dozen and they were gone within 20 minutes!!

REALLY GOOD! My boyfriend made these for the superbowl and they were a huge hit. We used drumsticks insted of wings for easier eating and more meat, we also used Frank's hot sauce (not buffalo sauce) and we think it turned out really well. We also baked them, using the methods that some of the other raters recommended. Next time though, in order to make it a little healthier and crispier, we plan on using boneless, skinless chicken breast-cutting them into strips and baking them and then serving the sauce with them instead of soaking them in it.

I've made these 2 times, and they are very good.  I tried taking them to my in-laws by putting them in the crock pot after I had prepared them.  I won't do the crock pot again, they were much better served immediately.

These are the best wings I have ever had!Made 50 for my New years party and had none left over! I only had 6 people over and all of them said you have to rate this a five. Thanks for such a good recipe. The only thing that I did different was to fry them in peanut oil. I will make this at all my gettogethers from now on. And that is every weekend!

THEY WHERE GREAT! They are VERY EASY to make. We ues FRANKS HOT sauce. They smell hotter then what they are. The breading on the wing are not that spicy but does have a flavor, the sause is great. I would give it a 5 out of 10 for hotness. We love wings in are family we go to wing restaurant places all the time. I will make this recipe many time. Go great with both ranch and blue cheese dressing

AWESOME! My husband even loved them and he is serious about his wings!! They will be  a regular meal at our house!  The only thing I did different was I made a lemon pepper seaoning for the kids, using butter, lemon pepper, more black pepper, and garlic salt.  That way the whole family could enjoy!! and we did, Thanks for the Recipe!!

Terrific - followed the recipe exactly and they came out perfectly.  To make it easier to prepare I put the flour ingredients in a ziploc bag and just shook the chicken to coat them and put the bag in the frig for 90 min.  I also prepared the sauce in a glass container and microwaved it for 1 1/2 minutes.  Thanks submitter - this is a keeper.  I served it with Blue Cheese Dip II from this site.  Great Dip!

I believe the instructions were too generic.  "Hot Sauce" is not specific at all - even to the type of peppers used.  The difference of 10 minutes vs. 15 minutes can be an enormous difference in 375 degree oil.

Man...these are so delicious. I am in love. (And I'm picky about even restaurant wings.)I used Frank's and tasted the sauce; delicious, but it was a bit too acidically hot for a heartburn sufferer like me.  So I added just a teeny bit of brown sugar and some thick chicken & rib barbecue sauce to cut the acidity. I fried these up on the stovetop. ( I made one just to test the recipe, dipped it in the sauce, took a bite and burned my tongue greedily chomping on the rest.) It was quick and they are so crispy. A real man-pleaser. 
I'd say these are tpack as much punch as medium restaurant wings. 
I used breast strips. I hesitated to do that because to me most boneless wings taste like a chicken nugget swimming in slimy bbq sauce. These taste like WINGS. If you even remotely like wings, try this recipe!

My husband loves this recipe! I used boneless chicken breasts and sliced them into strips rather than using wings. The strips were great on a toasted bun with some blue cheese, tomato and lettuce.

I have tried many recipes from Allrecipes without offering any comments. However, after trying this recipe I had to offer my compliments to Kelly for sharing this recipe. My husband asked me to please find a different recipe than the one I had been using. I had to agree with him, my wings were not the best. Now we can enjoy wings just like our local take-out, only better and cheaper!

I'm not a big fan of wings, so I substituted chicken breasts, followed the preparation instructions, and then baked them at 400F. They came out moist, tender, and spicy. YUM!! I will try making the wing version for our Super Bowl party!

I have been trying to cook chicken wings for years and have tried numerous recipes, they always turn out horrible.  I tried this recipe today and I was completely shocked. They turned out absolutely amazing.  Best home made chicken wings I have had in my life.   Follow this to the tee and you will be extremely impressed. Dont skip the 90 minutes in the fridge. Unbelievable!!  Thank you so much. This is certainly a keeper..

I loved this recipe!  I baked my chicken wings instead of frying just for a healthier version and they turned out better than fried, in my opinion.  Cooked them at 400 degress for 40 minutes, turning about half way and then coated them with the sauce, turned the oven down to 300 degrees and baked for an additional 15 minutes.  I will be making again regularly!!

Ok, we all know this isn't authentic buffalo wings. The Buffalo in the title just means the hot sauce it is tossed in. that's how the rest of the world sees it. I changed the recipe up just a little bit. I increased the portions to 15 because I ended up with 28 pieces of chicken. I also added pepper and garlic powder and onion powder to the breading mixture. I haven't actually finished this recipe yet cuz it's currently resting in the refrigerator in the flour mixture. I'm going to spray a couple of cookie sheets with Pam, put one layer on each of the chicken and spray the top of them before they go in the oven for 20 minutes at 400. Then I'm going to flip them and cook for an additional 20 minutes Per other reviews. I think I'm just going to put hot sauce on the side because we don't like soggy wings. **UPDATE** I did not care for this recipe. it turned out to be very dry I had to add oil to the pans so they would oven to fry. and they still tasted like you were biting into flour! The hot sauce was discussing it had chunks of butter solidified on top of it when it cool down I guess I'll keep looking for a recipe then. Even my husband didn't like them and he eats everything!

Loved these! First attempt at homemade wings last week and was a success! Making these again tonight. Followed recipe but baked them at 375 F for 35 mins turning them half way through cooking time and spraying with cooking oil. They came out crispy and delicious. I think the 90 mins dredged in flour in the refrigerator is a key step. My boyfriend likes them a little spicier than I do so we just drizzled as much sauce as we wanted on our individual servings. Mmm!

I saw this in the All Recipes magazine and was intrigued. I have never been happy with wings that were not fried, but because of the fat, I decided to give this a shot. I bought a three pound bag of wing portions and adjusted ingredients accordingly. I did all the prep in the morning and left these in the refrigerator (coated) all day. I then baked them for 45 minutes @350, 10 minutes @375, turning several times (as another reviewer suggested. I broiled them for an additional 3 minutes. Results.....fantastic. My husband loved these and never guessed I did not actually "fry" them. Chicken fell off of the bone. This is my go-to recipe for buffalo wings from now on. Thanks, Kelly, for sharing this one.

I have tried this recipe & LOVED it.  I did not make the buffalo sauce as we like our wings "dry".  I do add more spices to the flour mixture & plan to make this tomorrow night & will add some Jerk spice to the flour mixture & see how that turns out.  I also use the flour mixture on my regular chicken & putting it in the fridge for at least 90 minutes is the key to crispy wings & chicken.

We just did these for the second time tonight and let me tell you, these things put that H restaurant's wings to shame.  Wow!  We had to spice up the Tex Pete sauce with a little Blaire's Death until we got it right (oh yeah, we like it HOT)!  These wings are da bomb!  Out...

I fried them, and they were delicious.  If you don't want to bother with a deep fryer, just get a fondue pot.  You will not regret owning one.

These are very good if you like mild buffalo wings.  If you prefer a little on the hotter side, you will need to either add more hot sauce or less butter.  I like my wings extra crunchy, so after deep frying, I baked at 400 degrees for 5 mins on each side.  I then add more hot sauce to make them spicier.

GREAT RECIPE! I saved this recipe into my favorites, and will def. make again. It was a big hit with my boyfriend who is very picky about his wings. I didnt use the sauce recipe, just the batter/frying directions. You have to refridgerate the wings after coating with the batter. Other recipes didnt have this step, and the wings never came out right. Also, I used McCormicks buffalo wing sauce marinade. Cant wait to try different sauces with these delicious wings! ENJOY!

Tonight I'm making these wings for the 4th time in a row.  My picky daughter eats them UP without sauce and insisted on these for her birthday dinner.  Thank you so much for this recipe!

Made for my husband and he raved, raved, raved over them.  I did fry a few, but baked the rest and he said they were all fabulous.  I used Frank's Hot Sauce.

I followed the reviews that showed how to bake these.  What a hit they are!  Like so many others, I baked these with one coating of the sauce for about half an hour, then used the rest of the sauce for the final half hour.  To make cleanup easy, I baked them on a rack over a foil-lined baking pan.  Very yummy!

These wings are killer. Made many times. Just gets better. Don't understand neg reviews, Bland.. No Way!! No need to add changes. The recipe is right on. I would recommend double or triple the recipe. These wings will disappear fast.

I was nervous trying these because I haven't had the best of luck deep frying chicken. I was thrilled with the results! My daughter was just as delighted with them and has already asked me to give her the recipe. I didn't use the sauce because we aren't usually keen on hot sauce. We just dipped the wings in some plum sauce. I think I'd like to try a honey garlic sauce next time. Really excellent! So pleased with the results. Thank you!

These were very good. I didn't change a thing in the recipe.  I think the key here is to let them sit with the flour coating so that it sticks to the wings.  A definite "make again".

So good! We put a little less Franks Red Hot in because we don't do spicy, but they weren't at all. Next time we'll use all of it, and maybe more. Baked them at 375 for an hour then broiled them for 2 minutes to make them crispier. Will definitely make again!

I made these for super bowl this evening.  But I did it a bit different.  I mixed about 1/3 cuo EVOO with 1/2 teas garlic powder and 1/2 teas paprika and 1/4 pepper then tossed the chicken in it.  Then I poured the flour mix in and coated and refridgerated.  These came out very crunchy and juicey.  Tasted great with and without sauce!  I'll probably make these again cause the hubby likes hot wings but I made BBQ too :)

These were amazing!!!  I didn't have cayenne pepper so I substituted with Chipotle Chili Pepper and Ancho Chile Pepper.  I used Frank's for the sauce and added some Tobasco as well.

My 14 yo son said they were better than Buffalo's Wild Wings AND Hooter's.

They were very good. I recommend waiting until the last minute to put the sauce on. I would also brush it on. I tossed it and put them in oven while I was frying french fries. By the time I put them on the table the batter was no longer crunchy.

I made another batch and just brushed the sauce on at last minute and they were perfect.

BTW, I also refrigerated 1 hour and thought that helped to keep the batter on while I was deep frying in peanut oil. 

Very good!

My husband and I are huge wing fans. He likes his hot and I love BBQ. The only adjustment I would make to these is to double the hot sauce to the mixed sauce. Wings turned out amazing! (:

Buffalo wings are my husband's absolute favorite food. In fact, he's kind of a "buffalo wing snob". I made these for him tonight and he just couldn't stop eating them! He said they were "better than any restaurant's wings" and that I had just earned myself the "coolest wife on the planet award". Thanks so much for this recipe!

I made these for my son and his friends, they were a bit hit.  My son said the next day at school his friends talked about how good they were.  My son even asked me to make them for his school  pot luck.  This recipe is going to save me lots of money, now we can make these at home instead of spending money at the expensive resturants.

This was a great recipe.  Only thing I'd change, or recommend, is that you use pastry or cake flour instead which provides a smoother textured chicken than the harder flours meant for denser bread that are in all-purpose and bread flour.

This recipe was easy and on point. The first time I did it, I didn't read through properly and mixed the hot sauce and the butter off the heat. That didn't work out well. Make sure that the butter is completely melted before you mix the hot sauce and toss the wings. Try it!

Excellent recipe I have made these 3 times now and each time perfect! I add 1/4 cup of cornstarch to the flour for extra cripiness and garlic powder.  Hint you can reuse the oil after frying these store in container in refrigerator until next use.

My husband absolutely loved these wings. On a side note make sure you cut the wings apart. I had already dipped them in the flour when I noticed. The recipe is spot on.

Who knew?  My husband thought I bought these!!  My version.....used "Big Spring Mill, Inc." seasoned flour from VA.  Baked the wings at 375 for 25 minutes on a "cooking stone", sprayed with Pam.  Ranch dressing with Gorgonzola Cheese for a dipper.  Texas Pete was the hot sauce I used, everything else was the same.......cannot wait to share this food.  Thank you, to all who gave out tweak information.  Love it.

These were great!   I baked the wings for 40 minutes turning half way through and finished them up on the grill.   I used a suggestion from a previous review and sprayed the wings with oil before baking and half way through.   Great recipe!

These turned out great! Very crispy and lots of flavor. Baked them in the oven at 400 degrees for 40 minutes, then put them on the grill for another 5 minutes or so. We added the sauce after we took them off the grill. Will make again.

Great!!!! I will make more sauce next time. I baked them @ 350 for 45 minutes and tossed them in the sauce and they were fantastic. We moved 1000 miles away from my favorite wing place and this will serve me fine between visits home. Thank you for sharing.

My husband says these were the best wings he has ever eaten... and as he said "I've eaten alot of wings over the years."  This recipe was very simple and not time consuming at all, I also made boneless ones for myself.  Excellent recipe, thanks .

These are amazing!! I never thought I was much of a hot wing person until my hubby made these... and now I'm hooked! They're also really good using thin cut boneless chicken breast (which I personally prefer, though my hubby likes the wings). Hope to try baking them some day as well

I cook a lot, but I tend to stay away from breaded recipes because I've always had trouble getting the breading to "stick".  Putting them in the fridge for 90 minutes did the trick for sure!  And wow!!!  I can't believe how good these turned out!  And gave me confidence to try other recipes that require coating...  Thank you!!!

Wings were okay. If I would have used a better hot sauce like Franks and used fresh wings instead of frozen maybe they would have been alot better. Adding the flour is great because it adds crunch to your wings. I fried some wings and baked some as well. The baked ones were just as  crunchy as the fried ones.

REALY AN EASY RECEIPE..I redipped the wings in flour after sitting in the refrig for 90 minutes, before frying. After frying I drained the wings, than tossed in the dip.  I made 3 times the dip and after tossing the wings, I had enough for addtitional dipping.  I used the extra dip to put on the next days hamburgers and it was fantastic.

These were fantastic! As the title states, they as good and better than the restaurants. They had a crisp skin, spicy flavor, and were messy and delicious to eat, just as they should be. The wife loved them and has requested these again. I will make these many times and will not try another recipe as this one has achieved perfection.

WOW! This is a great recipe, thanks for sharing.   I followed the instructions, and like other users agree that the 60-90 minute period in the refrigerator is big reason these come out so awesome.   One recommendation, if you have an outdoor grill with a side burner, do the deep frying there. This way your house wont smell of used oil!  I have made this a couple times now, and always do about 60 wing pieces, I never put more than 10 pieces into the oil at a time.

This is a great recipe for not only chicken wings, but also for many other kinds of battered meats/fish. Letting the wings (meat/fish) sit in flour for 90 minutes ensures the flour sticks to the meat/fish and fries up nicely. While I put most in hot sauce after deep frying, the "plain" ones were great also. I am sure adding BBQ sauce would work great also. I am anxious to try this battering technique on other items like catfish or country fried steak.

Amazing!  Add about 4-5 drops of Blue food coloring to the liquid portion, it turns green and the wings look like they are covered in mold.  Great for Halloween parties!  The best tasting most disgusting looking wings you will ever eat!

Wow! These are good. They taste even better than what you can get at a restaurant. I've brought them to church functions, served them at family gatherings, made them for friends and my husband and they disappear like mad, everyone LOVES them! They're requested often. I use Frank's buffalo sauce and heat it with the butter, so good! They come out fantastic in the deep fryer but they still come out really well when just cooked in a pan with about a half an inch of oil. Sometimes I add about a half teaspoon of dried chipotle pepper to the flour mixture for extra hot wings.

Very good wings, I prefer my chicken more seasoned and so next time I will add more paprika, garlic powder etc to the flour. I will also try baking next time to cut down the fat content, but this was enjoyed by all.

YUMMY!!!  To those of you trying this....please do NOT be afraid to add spices of your liking to the flour mixture before disting the wings! I.E. extra garlic powder, italian or dry ranch seasoning mix, etc. Also to the sauce mixture, I added lots of minced garlic, and ranch powder mix, parsley and some apple cider vinegar to it for the tang since I halfed the amount of Frank's hot sauce. You can't go wrong here if you follow the directions to a T (with the exception being OBVIOUSLY step #1 is actually step #2). Thanks for sharing this recipe!! AWESOME!!! Definitely adjust to your liking, but don't change the dusting with flour step! This recipe is a KEEPER!

LOVED these wings!  Followed everything on the recipe except I baked and broiled the last 10 minute.  The flour was light (don't like breaded wings), and it was so good you'd never know it wasn't fried.  Next time I'll put more cayenne pepper. Definitely a keeper!

The first time I made these I accidentally added the garlic powder and black pepper to the flour mixture. AMAZING! I've made them that way since. Be sure to let the coated wings sit for at least an hour, until they're good and sticky. Worth every minute, and keeps the coating on the wings while frying and doesn't cause it to burn before the chicken is cooked.

Made these last night.  The flavour was amazing.  I followed the advise of some and put them in the oven to sit while making more.  DON'T DO THIS!!!!  They were so nice and crispy and wonderful when they are first done, but then you stick them in the oven and they get softer.  Still very very yummy....but I do suggest not doing the oven thingy.

These were delicious!  I lived in Buffalo for 8 years in the early 70's and have never been able to make them like we had back there.  But coating them with the flour mixture was the trick!  Messy but very, very good!!!

OMG so delicious!!! I also baked instead of deep fried mine as per suggestions below. I baked them on a rack over a jelly pan at 375 for 20 mins flipped them baked for another 10, sprayed both sides with Pam, baked another 10, finally dipped and covered in the sauce and baked a another 10 or so for a total of 50 minutes. Super duper delicious!!! Crispy, tasty, and the right amount of spice. I served with coleslaw to tone down the spice.

step #1 should be step #2, and visa versa, but other wise a great way to make terrific wings, although true Buffalo wings are not coated.

This is now my favorite snack!  I had a lot of chicken breasts, so I cut them up into bite size pieces and then coated and fried.  This is a much "cleaner" way to eat these!  I served these over the holidays and they were the first to go.  Although I might have eaten most of them!!

These were GREAT! My whole family loved them! I followed the recipe, but baked the chicken in the oven instead. Before putting it in the oven I sprayed it with a light coating of melted butter and that made it crispy!

My husband was super happy with me tonight! I took the suggestion of others and I used 1/4 cup of Franks Hot Sauce and 1/4 cup of butter for the sauce. Also added a dash of garlic powder.  Everything else I followed exactly. Couldn't be happier with this recipe. Thanks so much!

I had never made wings before today. I decided to try this recipe for a graduation party I was hosting. They were a huge success!! Based on previous experience cooking regular fried chicken, I patted all of the pieces dry before coating them with the flour mixture. I used Texas Pete Buffalo Wing Sauce with the melted butter. Seriously, the wing connoisseurs at the party said these were the best wings they had ever had. Thanks for sharing this recipe!

AMAZING!!! So good I had to write a review after all these years of using Allrecipes..I have tried several wing recipes with no luck getting the breading to stay on;these were perfect!! I followed the recipe exactly and fried them in my mini fryer;husband was wanting more and said they were "award winning"!! Refrigerating the wings was the detail Id been missing.(for the full hour)I fried in batches, making sure not to put too many in the fryer at a time, leaving the others in the fridge as they cooked.I believe these were better than any Ive had at Buffalo Wild Wings, Hooters or Wing Stop. Adding butter will make them less spicy, or reduce butter to "kick it up a notch" as Emeril says. For the kids you could even serve with just the breading, or substitute any sauce to vary it up a bit. Crispy and delicious for this wing lovin family,only recipe I will ever use again...Thanks Kelly!!!

My dear husband is a wing man and I was nervous trying these without the ready made stuff in the store from the chain restaurant.  In my opinion, this recipe was easier, cheaper and faster than even that homemade version. To my delight my husband loved them.  He raved and raved and could not believe how good they were.  He liked them better than Hooters and a favorite local pub.  He has already started thinking of when he can have me cook them and looks forward to trying them as leftovers cold.  What he liked most about them was the extra seasoning.  I used seasoning salt, garlic powder,and onion powder to lightly season the chicken before flouring. The other thing he loved was that they were not too wet. I took one reviewers tip and placed them under the broiler after dipping in the sauce to make them crispier and to dry up the sauce somewhat.  It worked like a charm. My 4 yr old even raved about how much he loved the plain fried wing. I will forever refridgerate my fried meat before frying.  The crunch could be heard across the table.  BTW, my hubby gave the wings a 12 on a scale of 1-10.

The tip about refrigerating the wings after battering was the best.  I am going to do this with all my fried chicken from now on.  My husband raved about these! I will be making again.

5+ stars!!! This recipe is what I have been looking for for years, in the past all of my wings have seemed fatty, deep frying them is the key it gives them that crunch you find in the restaurant and the sauce it to die for! Thanks

I cannot express how much I love this recipe! Through trial and error, I've altered it quite a bit, but it is all the more better for it. I use Louisiana hot sauce for one and boneless skinless chicken breasts that I cut into chunks. I bake them at 350 for about 15-25 minutes. DELICIOUS!!

I've even now started cutting it into strips and making wraps out of it, adding lettuce, tomato, and homemade ranch dressing on a tortilla. Absolutely fabulous.

have to say these are better than pub wings. I made them for my husbands birthday party and they were awesome . there were no leftovers thats how good they were. I made 3 different flavours. Hot, bbq and honey garlic. yummmy. I personally liked the buffalo style wings but my hun, not so much on the hot. he`s more of a bbq person thats  why i made 3 kinds. will make these again and again.thank u.

These were really good!  I made 8 lbs of wings for New Years Eve, and everybody loved them!  I cut back on the cayenne pepper because I was afraid they may be too spicy, but next time I will put what the recipe calls for because they could have used a little more spice. I may also try adding a little more hot sauce and a little less butter to spice them up some.  Thanks for the recipe!
Also, as one person stated, someone needs to change the recipe entry because it states to heat the oil and then to put the wings in the refrigerator for 1 to 1 1/2 hours.  A little mixed up I'd say!!

How delicious are these wings!! Yum! The only recommendation I have is making the sauce right before you add them to the wings. I made the sauce ahead of time and the hot sauce and butter completely separated and I had to remake the sauce altogether.

These are the most delicous buffalo wings I have ever tasted.  I made it with some really hot mexican sauce (since the brand was not specified in this recipe).  It was really hot, but sooo delicous everybody kept eating it (with perspiration on their upper lips and all!)!  This is a must for parties.  Thank you for sharing!

Yummy!  Reminds me of Boneless Buffalo Wings from Chili's.  I used boneless chicken breasts cut into medium size pieces and served with celery sticks and blue cheese dressing for dipping.  After frying, I brushed the chicken pieces with Frank's WIng Sauce and baked for about 15 min., turning halfway.  Perfect!

Ok, y'all.  I gave them five stars because of the batter you cook them in.  I love buffalo wings, so I thought the whole thing was great, but my family doesn't do spicy.  I have used the recipe minus the sauce for Sunday fried chicken.

I followed some advice from others...I made sure I refrigerated before cooking, used Franks hot sauce and baked instead of fried.  Loved the wings, thanks.

Very good, solid recipe. Do not skip the step of chilling these before frying, makes all the difference in the world.

I baked my thawed wings on 400 degrees for 25 minutes. They came out too doughy. Next time I'll have to follow the recipe and directions and use Hooter's Wing Sauce rather than Tabasco. ***UPDATE*** I deep fried my drumbsticks this time and they came out too hard. Am I starting to sound like the Princess and the Pea? Anyways, I'll have to figure out a happy medium between the 2 textures. Next time I'll try frying them in the stove top.

We love this recipe dipped in a little blue cheese dressing on Sunday afternoons when the football game is on.  Make no mistake about it though, you have to use Frank's Lousiana hot sauce...Don't try tabasco!  There is nothing better!

I chose to use skinless, boneless chicken breasts. I also fried the chicken in peanut oil. I thought the recipe was great and easy too.

This recipe is similar to my own. The only thing I was not getting was the right coating. I found this now my wings are complete. Putting the wings in the fridge is the key!!! I made them for work and they loved them. These are now the official super bowl wings! Tip: Add a little worcestershire sauce to the butter and use Red Hot gives a nice kick!

Sensational.  I have made these a few times now and they are always enjoyed. I do adjust the hot sauce to our taste. Popping them in the fridge is the key to this recipe.

Excellent!!  Restaurant quality wings and I didn't even fry them. Took another reviewer's advice and baked them at 400 for about 45-50 min. then broiled them for about 5. Used Frank's Red Hot sauce and they were awesome. Nice and crispy and without all of the fat and the hassle of frying.

These were awesome! I sprayed pam on a cookie sheet and baked them at 350 for an hour then 375 for about 10 minutes, as another user suggested. They came out beautifully crispy without the fat of deep frying. I also cranked up the spices and used seasoning salt as well as those listed in the recipe. I only put the sauce on half of them since they were so delicious even without sauce. As other users noted, it is important to let them sit in the fridge in the seasoned flour for the suggested time. Definitely will keep this as a favorite.

Definitely 5 stars!!!  I added onion powder and garlic powder to the flour mixture and kept the floured wings in the refrigerator for about 3 hours (convenience only).  I don’t like to deep fry so I baked the wings according to another reviewer (45 minutes at 350F, Pam spray, 5 Minutes @ 375F).  I made the sauce using 1/ 4 cup Frank’s original and 1/ 4 cup of butter.  I served with celery and ranch dressing and a garden salad.  I like things spicy so next time I will use a hotter sauce than Frank’s original.  I also like using the grill so next time I will grill the chicken wings.  I do think that deep frying would provide the best ‘wing’ flavor.  Also, I am not sure about the recipe serving five as 8 full chicken wings will weigh about 2 to 2-1/2 pounds and serve two medium sized adults including a side salad and one other side dish.

being a cook as a profession i used this recipe at the university that i work at. the students loved them and when you make nearly 100 pounds of wings you can only imagine the comments that were made. they loved them and asked that i continue to use this recipe.


being said i also make them for my family.
i take this recipe to every family get together. i started with the smallest amt of chicken now i am up to making about 15 pounds of wings. we love them. they are soooooooo good. i will never make another recipe for buffalo wings.

These were the best buffalo style wings I have ever eaten. My husband said they were even better than the restaurants. The only thing I did differently was to use fresh garlic instead of the  powder. This receipe is going into my favorites box and will be used often. Awesome!!!!!

These wings are fabulous!  The only thing I did different was, to prepare ahead I floured the chicken wings in baggies the night before and left them in the baggies overnight.  NOTE:  There was not enough sauce to cover the wings, and so the sauce receipe was essentially doubled in order to cover the wings for the warming drawer.  But it worked well to make ahead in the morning for a large party in the early afternoon.  Everyone loved the wings!  It had just the right amount of "heat."

I have tried many recipes on this site and this is by far the best. They do have the true Hooters wings taste which we crave. I have never deep fried anything before and was successful at this (and proud!). I added a bit more garlic powder but other than that followed the directions to a T, frying for 12 minutes and draining the wings on paper towels. Def. don't need to make the sauce until the wings are frying. This recipe is quick and easy and you won't believe the taste. Must use Franks hot sauce! I am going to buy the Franks bottle with a higher heat and add a little of that for dh who likes 'em TMI! Thanks for this recipe thats so easy, tasty, and a $$ saver!

5/09/2007 - Last night was the first time I have ever attempted to make hot wings. My boyfriend orders them from pizzeria's a few times out of the week. It get's very costly and sometimes they are disgusting. I knew I could do better. So, I started searching for a good recipe. THANK YOU! THANK YOU! THANK YOU! My boyfriend absolutely loved them! He said they were better than any we have had lately. (Maybe he is partial.) Anyway, I will make these and save lots of money! Wonderful recipe!  Anyone searching...Look no further!

The BEST wings ever.  I used to order delivered wings once a week and now I just make my own, they are better and cheaper.  You  can use the wing recipe and add whatever flavor sauce you like if you don't want the spicy buffalo sauce.  We used Honey Mustard and BBQ sauce, it was AWESOME! THANKS for sharing.

Baked instead of fried, which made the floured coating a bit soggy.  Next time will leave the flour off and marinate in the sauce so it does not run all over the pan.  Good taste, medium spicy. Enjoyed and shared with others.

I used chicken breast meat, Frank's hot sauce, and baked as many reviewers did, but we're in the minority on this one; just wasn't for us.  Didn't care for that paprika flavor which seemed to stand out. Thanks for sharing your recipe, Kelly!

These were really good.  I fried them up and then let everyone put on what they wanted.  Some used ranch, some used the recipe, some used BBQ, and a LOT of people ate them plain.  Thanks!

I made these for the Superbowl and they were a HUGE hit.  I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts cut into strips and deep-fried for about 8-9 minutes, transferred to sauce, tossed them around and then set them on a rack to drip a minute before serving to the masses.  Absolutely, perfectly delicious...even for the buffalo wing connoisseur!

I had to double this recipe for our Super Bowl party...My husband loved these...they were too hot for the rest of us. I usually am satisfied with ordering "medium" at Hooters and Buffalo Wild Wings...too hot for me. I will make for hubby again...but for the rest of us, I will tone it down next time.

These wings were soooo awesome!! I have been looking for great wings recipe and this is it. I will definatly be adding this one to my recipe box. I would be tempted to add different flavors(BBQ, honey garlic ect.) instead of using the hot sauce. I refridgerated the sause after i cooked it and it thickened up so nicely. Everyone sould try these. They are so easy to make!!

This is the first time I have rated a recipe on this site, but this was just what I was looking for!  Easy to prepare and so good and crunchy.  I omitted the cayenne pepper as my husband doesn't like hot things, but will try to sneak it in the next time!

What a hit, so good.  I made them as listed but I also made up more chicken wings with the coating and made them into teriyaki wings.  The wings with the coating are right on and I will be using that part of the recipe a lot.

Made these for hubby....who LOVES his wings.  I actually used chicken breast tenders instead (all I had on hand) and it was delicious.  Didn't change a thing.  Hubby asked me to print out and keep on hand to make again (major points for that).  Thanks for the post.

Wow - this was a hit!  Everyone loved these wings.  The only thing I did different was bake them in the oven instead of frying.  This one is a keeper.

Very very good.  Basic and simple...although I add a bit more hot sauce to kick it up a few more notches.  Otherwise, a great recipe that you can tailor to your tastebuds.

I didn’t deep fry these.  I only flash fried them then baked. I cut down on the better and used Franks Red Hot Sauce. AMAZING.  I won't buy fatty wings from pizza joints anymore when they are this easy to make yourself.  Even better, you are capable of lightening them up by baking and reducing the amount of butter without sacrificing the taste and experience of buffalo wings. 

A keeper recipe and repeat!

This recipe was really good, however we would probably not add salt to this. The Hot sauce as plenty of salt. Thanks for a good recipe.

It's true the longer you leave them int he skillet, the hotter they get!! Loved the recipe, was quick and easy to put together, although adding the butter to the hot sauce made them way to rich. I think I would omit the butter or cut in half next time! :)

I made these wings for my husband and he gave them a 5 star.  He thought the sauce was delicious - a perfect heat.  The chicken was nice and crispy on the outside, juicy on the inside.  This is the newest recipe to be added to his favourites list.  Thanks for sharing.  :)

I think this is one of those recipes where chnage is not always good, I should have followed it to the T. I baked mine, not wanting to pull out my deep fryer. Not nearly as good as I was hoping. Also the sauce seemed to break a bit, perhaps I had too a heat. Next time I won't modify.

I will NEVER make Buffalo wings any other way again!!  I hate frying, but these came out perfectly crispy and just absolutely wonderful!!  I will definitely make these again.  To spice them up even more (can only do so much with Louisiana hot sauce) I added a few drops of Double Hot Habanero sauce to the regular hot sauce mix and boy what a kick!!  Try it if you find your hot wings just aren't hot enough!!

These were fantastic! I had to add an extra step because my hubby likes his wings falling off the bone. After I deep fried them, I baked them in the oven for an additional 15 minutes at 350. This recipe is definitely a keeper!

Great recipe, even modified. I don't care for anything hot or spicy so I left out the cayenne pepper and hot sauce and added onion powder. 

I didn't understand why you would make the garlic/butter sauce first, then let it sit for an hour+ while the wings "marinated." SO, I made the sauce while the wings themselves were cooking. I also only let the sauce sit on the wings for about 5 minutes before I removed the wings from the leftover sauce (otherwise, to me, it seems that the chicken would either be soggy or solidified sauce would surround the leftover chicken.) All in all, extremely tasty.

These wings were sooo good!!!  I wouldn't change a thing!!  They were super easy to make and quick, too (if you don't count the time refrigerating)!!  I baked half and deep fried half (just to see the difference).  Both ways were delicious (but frying was quicker)!!!  My boyfriend said this is the best thing I make so far!!  And I liked them better than some restaurants!!  Will definitely make these again!!

Great recipe!  I made this for holiday guests, and everyone loved it.  In fact, they left me 1 wing!  I'll be making it again for New Year's Eve.  I made the recipe as written, except that after coating the wings with the sauce, I put them in a 250-degree oven for about an hour to keep them hot until everyone arrived.  They were awesome that way, and it made serving time much easier on me.

Excellent! The first time I made them we loved them, especially my husband who is a Buffalo wings fanatic (he's picky about how they turn out, if we go to a restaraunt and he doesn't like their wings he won't go back!) When I made these the second time I added a Tbs. of Ketchup to thicken the sauce a little, a splash of vinegar and a splash of vodka for a little extra zip. Delicious! I think with the couple extra ingredients I added they turned out more like our favorite restarunts' wings.

After trying many local bars and restaurants to find the ultimate wings, my husband suggested that I try making them myself.  So I made a double batch for my family for a Super Bowl snack.  They were fantastic!  Better than any we've had from restaurants. The coating was just right and the sauce was the perfect consistency. I served them with chunky blue cheese dressing and celery sticks.  Unfortunately, I was unable to find Frank's hot sauce...I used Crystal hot sauce, which was fine for my tastes, but my husband thought they could have been spicier...but he still enjoyed them).  Next time, I will kick it up a bit and hopefully make him sweat!  I can't wait to make them again!

These are awesome. I was looking for a jumping point recipe to start off cooking hot "wings" with and this was perfect.  The sauce mixture is the perfect heat w/ a little bite, but not too much to mask the chicken!

I use tenderloins or sliced breast to make fingers.  No fussing w/ bones and bigger pieces to savor! Yum.  I also added random items from the spice cabinet to the flour mix and halfed the flour and replaced with half Washingtons seafood mix.  Also added just a touch of apple-cider vinegar to the butter/hot sauce mixture.

This is a fantastic recipe as is, but it's also a perfect one to experiment with as well!! Either way you're sure to enjoy!

These wings are fantastic! I got a deep fryer for Christmas and we eat these wings more than we should. I add 2 tsp. seasoning salt and a dash of worcestershire to the sauce.

These were a hit! I didn't use cayenne pepper or paprika. I doubled the recipe, used a whole bottle of hot sacue and i sprayed baking sheets with pam before I baked them. Then tossed them with the sauce. They were a huge hit. Everyone loved them! This is my new recipe for wings!!

These wings were really good as far as taste goes- don't know about Hooters, but similar to a variety at my favorite...Quaker Steak & Lube (Sharon, PA).  I did have a problem with the wings getting "gooey" one the sauce was added, hence the 4 stars- next time I'll just fry the wings without the flour coating.

These were delicious.  I made these for New Year's Eve along with the Buffalo Chicken Wings recipe from this site.  My husband liked these and he doesn't usually like battered chicken wings.  I skipped the 60 to 90 min. refrigeration.  They still came out delicious.  Next time I might try it to see what the difference is.  I will make these again.  Great recipe!

I love Buffalo wings. I've had them from many different places and I've made them at home several times with a few different recipes and none of them were all that great. These spicy beauties were without question the best I have found to make at home. As a matter of fact now that I have found this recipe, I may not ever get them from any place else again. There is a resturaunt that I got to that wins the "Best Of Philly" award for Buffalo wings year after year, and these wings are  just as good as what they serve. Excellent recipe.

Excellent recipe! They really are like the ones in the restaurant. It was the first time I've made wings. Your hot sauce will really determine how good your wings are. The more butter the less kick they will have.

These were fabulous. A little too spicy for me but not the husband. I deep fried then dipped in sauce until coated and baked just a little to "set" the sauce. Even good w/o sauce.

My husband and son just LOVED these.  I made 4 lbs of chicken wings, and those two ate all but 5 wings!!!  Having said that, I don't really care for that flavor.  I will look at different recipes the next time I make chicken wings.

After 15 years I've finally found the dominant wing recipe.  I like my wings HOT so I used about 2 teaspoons of cayenne in the flour mix and about another tsp in the sauce...With the exception of Hooters these are the best wings I've eaten!!!!!

These are the only wings that I will make now, they are just like Hooters and we love them!  I do my own sauce (much spicier) but use the rest of this recipe...it is yummy!  I also suggest cutting only the tips off of the wings and leaving the drummy and other part attached.  We like them like that better, and you won't end up with all the drummies eaten up and the other ones left over!  Hooters keeps them whole.

Edible, but just OK.  Made the both ways...fried half in oil and baked other half in oven.  400 degrees 45 minutes - flipped half way.  No one in my house was impressed.  Oh well.

If you are looking for the standard in bar wings, this recipe is spot on.
But if you are a Buffalo Wing enthusiasts like myself you will want more flavor to really drown in the experience.
Add another teaspoon of Cayenne pepper, teaspoon of crushed red pepper, and 1/2 fresh(not pickled)diced jalapeño to the sauce. 
You're welcome.:)

Perfect!!!!!!  I used Archie Moore Buffalo Sauce but the wings themselves were perfect!  Light & Crispy!!!  Fried in deep fryer for 13 minutes per batch using fresh wings (not frozen).

These were great and very easy. We used Frank's Red Hot kickin BBQ and threw them on the grill for 15 minutes after they were cooked and had been tossed in the sauce to add a little more crisp. Will definitely make again!

I have tried this recipe both ways, frying and baking the wings using the method described by the other reviewers.  While I think that the wings have more crunch with the frying method, they are excellent (and healthier) baked.  The difference is actually quite negligible, though.   Fried, these wings are every bit as good as the wings I get at the restaurant or pub.  Baked, they are also very nice.  When I make them again, I will likely bake them as I don't have to buy oil, they are healthier, and there is less clean up.   Thank you to the person who submitted it and to the reviewers who shared the baking method.  This recipe is a keeper!

We LOVED these!  Thanks for sharing the recipe, Kelly!  My 15 year-old son made these and they turned out perfect and he was very proud of the results.  He has declared that he will make these every New Years.  He followed your recipe exactly.  We took half the wings and coated with the sauce, as written in the recipe.  For the other half, my daughter and I made a sweeter sauce for our own tastes.  Definitely a keeper recipe!

I tried it last night, awesome. I added some semolina to the flour and a lil bit of chilli powder. Very crispy better then restaurant wings!!! Also I steamed wings for 5 mins before with some lemon juice and crushed ginger and garlic and salt. Then cooled them under cold water and trimmed of excess skin. I them coated and refrigerated. Amazing!!! Enjoy

These are a great replica of restaurant wings!  I followed the recipe as stated except I increased  the amount of garlic powder, and used Franks hot sauce (I think Franks has such great flavor).   My adult children went wild!

Excellent recipe! My husband loved it, and he is not a fan of anything spicy. I left the sauce on the side for him because he usually won't touch it, but he devoured almost the whole bowl of sauce too! I'll be making these again for sure! Thanks!!!

My husband loved these! I used our deep fryer and a skillet and the deep fryer was much faster. I tripled the recipe as I had 25 wings. They had a nice crisp and the sauce is yummy with the melted butter. Easy once you do it once and get the hang of it!

I didn't have good luck with this recipe.  I tried baking like many reviews said and it seems like I baked them for hours.  THe flavoring was really good though.  I think next time I will try with boneless chicken breasts and cut them into pieces and fry.

These were very good.  I baked instead of fried and think I will add more hot sauce next time. Thanks for sharing this recipe and thanks to all those who posted reviews..they were very helpful.

I made these for my husband's birthday/poker night. The boys LOVED them. Best served straight from the fryer, but still good cold with a side salad the next day. A wonderful recipe - thanks!

These turned out great!  My wife who can't stand wings was fighting me trying to eat them!  I added a little chili powder and tabasco to give some of them a little more heat.

Excellent.  I cut back the hot sauce by 1/2 as I have teenagers who aren't crazy for spicy food.  It was perfect.  Next time I'll back them to cut back on the fat and calories.

This time I used Frank's Wing Sauce and added some hot sauce. Next time, I'll use regular Franks. I baked a batch and fried a batch-- I found only slighty differences and will bake them from now on. I also will seperate the wings at the joints before I do anything instead of seperating them after cooking.

Delicious. I baked mine in the oven (400) but pan fried them in butter and olive oil first so the skin was crispy. It help to keep the wings moist too!

We changed up the recipe and used Sweet Baby Ray's Hickory and Brown Sugar barbecue sauce in place of the hot sauce. They were absolutely phenomenal! I would make these again in a heartbeat!

I have never associated Buffalo style wings with Buffalo, NY. To me, it means hot and spicy. It has become a common name for hot wings.  I think people can call them whatever they want. Its like me making New York style pizza in my kitchen but I don't live in New York. Anyhow, this recipe is definitely a keeper in my recipe book.

The wings were crunchy but once I added the sauce it became way to greasy.  When we added the store bought sauce it was great.

Best wings I've ever made.  They were crispy, tasty and full of flavor.  I cheated a little on the sauce and just did butter and Franks Red Hot Buff sauce.  I put sauce on the side as a dip for those who don't like spice because the wings alone were delicious!!

This was a great recipe. We used chicken breast cut small, it's what we had on hand. And it worked great. Great flavor and a good crunch. We will defiantly use this again.

After much research I settled on this recipe for my first attempt at making chicken wings at home. Total score! I followed the recipe exactly (minus the sauce) and the wings came out crispy and delicious. Instead of the buffalo sauce I tossed them in a Guy Fieri "Wok Sauce" and it was delish! I also left some "unsauced", found them a bit bland and next time I will up the spices in the flour so "unsauced" wings have a bit more flavor to them :-) This recipe is definitely a keeper and I will be making them again soon!

I was disappointed.  I followed the recipe, although I did bake them (350 for 40 minutes, then 400 for 5 minutes, then broiled for 2 minutes) rather than deep fry them.  I do not like wings too spicy, but these were flavorless.

These were great and a big hit at our football party. I've made them quite a few times with various wing sauces. I fry them in a cast iron pan with canola oil since I don't have a deep fryer.

The reason for 4 stars is I like a hotter sauce...not enough heat. And next time I won't add the sauce to all of the wings in one shot but rather serve wings and pour sauce over wings as you go...2 soggy if left to sit for a few minutes.

I made 10 pounds of wings. I didnt have cayenne, so I used some chili powder and some smoked paprika. I didnt make the sauce for it. I used hickory brown sugar bbq on some, and some I left plain for dipping.

Best - wings - EVER!  These were a treat, a total splurge and worth every calorie.  Not something we make often or a lot of so it was nice to have something so good!  This one is goin' in the keeper file!

I liked the recipe, but made some revisions:
Added Zesta Saltine Crackers to the breading, and soaked the chicken drum legs in 1% milk for 30 minutes, did not have buttermilk or half & half.
Added my own spices, but really liked the way the breading adhered to the chicken.  Also used Olive Oil for the frying.

I would give this 10 stars if I could!!  I used a deep cast iron skillet instead of my deep fryer simply because it was quicker.  We had our 2 sons and son-in-law here today for football.  With 4 grown men, I decided to quadruple everything.  THAT was not smart because I needed at least 20 more wings!  They loved them and so did my daughter and I.  I took another reviewer's advice and after frying, paper-toweling, tossing in a tupperware lidded bowl with the hot sauce, I put them on a pan and into the oven at 350 for about 8 minutes.  Buffalo wings that are not super-messy!  It's a dream come true!!  Thanks for such a fantastic recipe.  We will have these every weekend between now and the Super Bowl, at my husand and children's request.

These are really good. I like to deep fry mine, coat with sauce, then put them in the oven for a few minutes to get crispy as thats how we like them. Great stuff.

Everyone Loved this chicken. Very crispy and good. I made it as stated except I did not have cayenne pepper so I used chili powder, also I added a bit of sugar to the sauce and I used less hot sauce becasue My kids cant do spicy. I was concerned at first because the sauce was not at all creamy or well blended. The hot sauce made a paste at the bottom of a LOT of butter but, when cooled a bit it tasted good so I put it on and It was fine. The butter didn't make the chicken soggy, it was still crisp and good. I will defiantly do this again and My husband will be making sure of that. Thank you for this great addition to our family's meal.

I made these for my wing loving fiance, and he loved them! He likes his wings on the BBQ, so of course I had to make them on the BBQ. I was trying to figure out a way to make this deep fry recipe work on the BBQ while still having that same crisp I've read about from other reviews. So what I did was made the hot sauce part, let the wings sit in the hot sauce for an hour, then I mixed up the dry ingredients(double the amount suggested) put half on the bottom of a glass bowl and half on top of the wings, and let them sit in the fridge for a little over an hour. I got the BBQ going, and then put them on. I made the mistake of turning them too soon and some of the breading came off, and some got stuck to the BBQ during flipping them. LET THEM GET CRISPY ON BOTH SIDES BEFORE FLIPPING. I made another batch of hot sauce so I could rub it on them during cooking, which turned out good. He loved them and they were hot enough for him, and I will be making these again(I won't spend the money at a restaurant again) but I will let them crisp before rubbing on the hot sauce.

I thought this a very good recipe, but it is not at all hot as written. I followed the recipe exactly. Next time I will 'heat' it up a bit.  But it was still very tasty as is.

the best best best wings even BETTER than restaurant kinds, you will not regret trying this. just make sure you let them babies sit in the flour coating for an hour or more for the crispy-ness.

Love em!  Every time I order wings at a restaurant, I think to myself "I bet I could make these just as good for half the price!"  After trying this recipe, it turns out I can!

These were just like you buy in resturants but we did make some chances... we backed them in the oven instead of frying them and they still turned out crisp and wonderful. Next time I'll tone down the spice a little but overall these were great.

I used this recipe today for my wings. It came out fabulous!! I didn't add the flour since I basically wanted the wings to be glazed, still fabulous.

Or bake @ 350 for 30-45 minutes, sprayed with PAM. Baste with sauce and bake a bit longer. My son says "best wings I've ever had at home." Definite keeper!

My husband considers himself a "wing connoisseur", and this recipe BLEW HIS MIND!!!!  He wants me to make them all of the time now!  We use Franks hot wing sauce, and I usually double the recipe.  I taught him how to make them last week, so now he can take over the reigns.  They are crispy, and delicious!  I don't like wing sauce, so I dunk mine in bbq sauce...but they are great!

Yumarooneee!!!!!!!!!!!  Storing the chicken wings in the refrigerator for 60 to 90 min. definately is a must for making these super crispy.  Also the making sure the oil is hot enough and cooking them for the lenghth of time the recipe calls for gives them its success.

I grew up in Niagara falls Canada. As a teenage we used to go to Buffalo for the best chicken wings in the world! These taste just like the good old days back in buffalo. Excellent!

Turned out wonderfully, and was even easier than I thought. I fried the wings in a wok, with only enough oil to cover half of a wing.

Used Cholula brand hot sauce.  Breaded, baked at 400 for 40 min, turning once.  Browned beautifully!  Then I tossed the wings in the sauce and baked them another 5-10 minutes.  They're gorgeous and taste wonderful!!  Thanks, Kelly!

im making these tonight, AGAIN! dont skimp on leaving them in the fridge the entire time..its the key to a crispy outer shell. i like my wings HOT and the sauce recipe falls short of what i like. i use franks extra hot sauce and add a drop or two of daves insanity sauce. i've tried perfecting my wings for many years but never quite got the results i was looking for until i tried it this way. you cant go wrong with this recipe. this is even better than marinating your wings in buttermilk imo. 5 stars.

this was fantastic! i used chicken breasts cut up because we wanted boneless wings. i doubled the sauce and added 3 tbl white vinegar, 1 tbl worchestire, and 1/4 tsp garlic powder and baked them in the oven with the sauce and they were sooooo delicious! definitely a keeper recipe!

OMGosh - This recipe is superb! I have never been a "wing" person until lately. I have been on a quest to find the best tasting wings around...alittle crunchy, just the right amount of heat -- and these are it. I followed the recipe and they are wonderful. On part of the wings I mixed ranch dip (1 pkg fat free ranch/16 oz light sour cream in with the sauce (about 1/4 cup ranch to 1/2 cup sauce) before doing the shake with the chicken. Absolutely amazing! This has to be one of the best recipes I've tried to date on this site!  Thank you All Recipes for a great find!

These were great. We skipped the refrigeration step and baked ours on a cookie sheet lined with parchment paper.  We baked at 375 for 20 minutes (because we had some artichoke dip in the oven at the same time), than cranked up the heat to 450 and baked for another 30 minutes, turning them about half way through.  No need to add any spray oild because the grease that the chicken releases itself is enough to crisp them up a bit.  We used 2/3 butter, 1/3 cup Frank's sauce as suggested by another review and they were great!  Will make these again.

These were EXCELLENT! I decided to bake half and fry half. The ones we fried were MUCH better. If you do bake them, make sure you grease your pan a lot. I baked them on a cookie sheet for 45 minutes, flipping once and the skin stuck to the sheet like crazy! I used Ken's hot sauce marinade and butter on the baked batch, and butter and Franks on the other (fried batch) The sauce was perfect, add more or less depending on what you like. I will definitely be using this again and again. Just in time for football too!!

These were terrific! I tripled the recipe (for 30 wings, approx 4lb bag frozen) for a community  picnic in the park. They were an absolute hit! EVERYONE loved them, from the smallest kid to the oldest gramma! They were gone quicker than I expected!   They weren't too hot (which I liked). However, others do prefer a spicier wing so I may try to do some variations next time with the seasonings on half of them to give them some heat.  The other "problem/issue" I had was, once they were all done frying and coated (I did them in batches due to the size of my pan) the few first ones became a little soggy, I'm not sure why, but I may try to put them on a rack in the oven while the rest cook just so they aren't sitting with the liquid hot sauce cooling for so long.  Great Great recipe! I can't wait to make them again... and I'm not a big wing fan!! ...well until now!!

I add 1 more cup of franks hot sauce, and a dash of onion powder.  Makes it a little more spicy so it's perfect.

I have made these a few times now and everyone LOVES these. I tried as written and I have tried it with the breading then eggs wash and breading again. I like it the best with breading it twice (no egg wash) I bread it once put in the fridge for about 3-4 hours and bread again and the re fridge for another 3-4 hours. These are just 100% awesome. I tried the sauce today with 1/3 butter and 2/3 Franks buffalo hot wing sauce. It's all good. When I am making these for a crowd, I deep fry them the day before for 6-7 minutes @ 375. The next day I put them in the oven @ 375 for 10-12 minutes. Thanks for the recipe.

My family loved these.  I also put mine on the grill instead of deep frying.  I put foil over my rack and poked holes in it with a fork and sprayed it with Pam.  Since I made them for a large group I was able to make a larger quantity at one time.  I made them three different ways.  I made some with the hot sauce recipe, put KC Masterpiece BBQ sauce on some and let some plain.  That way everyone was happy.  They also liked the variety.  I will absolutely make these again.

I used thighs & drumsticks but cut the thighs into two sections, leaving a bone in each piece.  I loved how meaty they were this way!  The sauce had amazing flavor and the chicken was perfectly crispy & juicy with a 90min rest.  I used 3/4's cup butter because I'm a whimp with the spice. I just fried it like reg. fried chicken in a hot pan, 1/4" to 1/2" of oil.  This uses way less oil than a deep fryer and gets a nice crisp on the chicken.  Thanks for the recipe, it's requested often in our house!  **Here's an easy, mild bleu cheese dressing** 1/2 c. mayo, 1/2 c. sour cream, 2 green onions sliced, 2-3 tbsp fresh lemon juice, fresh ground black pepper, 1/4 c. bleu cheese crumbled.  **UPDATE** I always soak the raw chicken pieces in buttermilk ( or milk plus vinegar to sour) plus a little salt and hot sauce in the milk.  Adds another layer of moist, tasty wonderfulness!

I baked 25 wings on a wire rack for 60 minutes. They looked like they'd been fried I couldn't believe it. The refrigeration is key and worth the extra prep time. Spray the rack really well or they will stick and turn the wings once during baking. I put 1/2 in the sauce and left 1/2 plain. Impressive!

These were good but I had one problem.  When I cooked them I sprayed the Pam on them, like suggested, and my oven started to smoke like it was on fire!  So, if you decide to bake them completely REMOVE them from the oven, spray, then put back in.  The only other suggestion I have is shaking off the excess flour with a strainer before you put them in the oven.  This helps with even baking.  If not you'll end up with flour still on some wings.

Excellent! I put the flour mixture in a ziploc bag and then added the wings. Left the wings in the fridge for a few hours. Then I baked them on silicone baking sheets, so they wouldn't stick at 375 for 50mins turning once. The best.

These are DELISH!!  I use Frank's Red Hot Buffalo for the hot sauce.  I add more than a dash of garlic powder.  Just thinking about that sauce makes my mouth water.

Holy cow if there is such a thing.  I love trying new recipes but this buffalo chicken wing recipe is the absolute BEST!  I was absolutely amazed that the process of dipping it in the flour mixture and then refrigerating for 2 hours produced a super battered chicken wing, nice and crispy.  I finally know now that that's probably how they also make orange chicken... Same process, dipping in flour mixture, refrigerating and then deep frying, topping the finished product with the orange sauce.  I'll try the orange chicken next time and I'm sure it'll be a winner also.  I'm not kidding, you guys have got to try this recipe.  I doubled the recipe and did 22 fresh chicken wings and they were all gone on Superbowl Sunday.  A definite keeper!

I made chicken wings with the tips and chicken legs.  They were fabulous!  I actually liked them with no sauce just as much as with the sauce, so I made half with and half without.  Great recipe, I'll definately make them again!

I've been using this recipe for years.  If I'm not mistaken, this is from Todd Wilbur's "Top Secret Restaurant Recipes."  Not a bad cookbook if you're a fan of the corporate chain-restaurants.  I tend to either fry the wings a little longer (12-13 min) or char them on the grill or a superheated cast-ron skillet to add to the crispiness.  Thanks for sharing.

These are great and they definitely taste just like those served in a famous restaurant in our area. Don't suggest double battering the chicken though, it just doesn't taste the same. Follow the recipe!

I would rate these a 10 if I could these were awesome!!! I doubled the recipe and I used Frank's sauce like others stated. IT IS AMAZING! I couldn't stop eating them and any leftovers were eaten  by my husband before I got a chance to put them up.  If you are looking for a hot wing recipe this is it. Next time I will try chicken strips and make it spicier to see how they turn out but this is defiletely a keeper!!

These were awesome! I used chicken breast tenderloins instead of wing sections and it worked wonderful.  We made buffalo chicken wraps with them.  One word of advice...use Frank's hot sauce, it's by far the best we've tried.

A quick tip for a GREAT sauce if you don't have all the ingredients. Soften  butter (to room temp) and mix about half butter with half "Louisiana" hot sauce (Louisiana works the absolute best) in a bowl. Stir butter and hot sauce together and toss onto hot wings. It's great, cheap, and tastes just like most buffalo sauces out there. A very close version of Hooters' sauce.

I know this recipe has many reviews already but they are DELICIOUS! I can't order wings out anymore because they do not compare to these. I followed the recipe exactly and they were GREAT! Chilling is crucial. It made all the difference in the world.

Ok.  Husband liked.  I didn't.  Not sure about the breading.  Something was off about the sauce too.  Not my favorite but I gave four stars because DH liked it so much.

I'm a vegetarian, so I did not try these myself; but my boyfriend and his friends could not get enough! I got tons of rave reviews, including "These are the BEST chicken wings I've ever had!"
I used a buffalo style hot sauce in addition to the butter and spices. The sauce on it's own tasted wonderful, so I know it helped add flavor to the wings.

Just like in the chain restaurants. Made this a little bit different that recipe called for. Used chickent tenders. Baked at 450 until cooked through. Mixed one egg with about 1 tablespoon of flour. Dipped chicken in mixture and quick-fried it in oil on stove-top. Removed when golden. Mixed in sauce. Delish!

I have followed the directions exactly when I made this recipe before, and let them sit in the frig for and hour or longer. They came out perfect!  But, tonight I really wanted to make this recipe at the last minute, but didn't have time to let them sit in the frig, so I coated them as directed, and then deep fried them just after I floured them.  They still came out awesome! If time allows, always try to let sit in the frig for the recommended time, but if you are in a hurry, they are still worth making without letting them sit in the frig.  By the way, I did this batch with chicken cutlets and came out just as good as the "wings" I have made in the past.  
Thanks for sharing this recipe!

Very good! I agree with the other reviews that letting the wings rest after coating them is the key. Don't skip this step! Thanks for a great recipe!

This recipe was really yummy. They tasted just like Buffalo Wild Wings' Spicy Garlic buffalo wings after using Franks Hot Sauce. I would recommend to anyone who truly enjoys buffalo wings!

WOW!  I use the bagged, frozen wings (thawed & drained well).  The flour will coat up to 15-20 wings, actually.  These bake up well using Reynolds Non-stick foil and baking according to the bag (mine says 375' for 35-45 min).  Since I bake mine, I slather some sauce on part of the way through; flip the wings, then add remainder of sauce.  These get RAVE reviews from DIE-HARD WING LOVERS!

Made these last week and had to go get more wings.  My husband and kids raved about them. Don't skip chilling the wings once they're dusted.  Makes the difference absolutely! Deep fried they came out crispy and I used a bottled sauce I had bought at the grocery store. I think it was called Anchor Bar, very spicy and good. Just put the cooked wings in a large plastic tub w/lid, poured the sauce over top and shook until they were evenly coated. Perfect! ENJOY :)

These were super tasty. I substitued I Can't Beleive it's not Butter Light for the regular butter and used Frank's Buffalo Wing Sauce. We also only cooked drumsticks since that's what my hubby and I prefer. I did find by doing that we have to cook them longer to get them crispy though. We cooked them about 20-23 minutes in the deep fryer and they came out great.

bored with the munchies one day, so I decided to give these a shot.  These had turned out excellent, so I brought them to my wife for her lunch at work.  I must say that these were a big hit, seeing as though my wife said she only had one whereas the others were eaten by all her co-workers.  These taste just as good as some of the more popular restaurant chain's, if not better.

Best buffalo wings recipe ever! PERIOD! I followed the recipe exactly except that I used the oven to cook wings. I believe the secret to this great recipe is keeping wings in the fridge for 1-2 hrs as other reviewers mentioned, and it's a step you should NEVER skip! As for the buffalo sauce, I adjusted butter-hot sauce ratio as I tasted, and it turned out great! Definitely will make this dish again and again! Wonderful!! Thanks!!

AWESOME! I used seasoned salt instead of regular to add even more flavor. I have made it with regular flour and gluten free flour and it comes out exactly the same, for those of you who have friends with gluten allergies

Awesome, Awesome, Awesome!  I let them sit in the flour mixture for 2 hours, baked them at 400 degrees for 40 minutes (turning them once) and broiled them for 4 more minutes (turning once) after brushing a coating of the hot sauce on them...

Just like at the bar!  I do like a little more pepper, but it would be great either way.  IDEA:  I used boneless brest strips  instead of wings and followed the recipe.  When done, put them in a tortilla shell with lettuce, blue cheese dressing, shredded cheddar cheese, onions and tomato - makes an awesome wrap!

This recipe is great! You need to try it with the exact instructions. I made 20 wings (10 fried, 10 baked in the over). The baked ones were not crispy enough after the sauce is coated, but the fried ones tastes amazing!

I purchased a professional deep fryer I make these wings so much! I like adding a little more cayenne and onion powder but they are so crunchy!! I made them for a party I catered, fried them up about 2 hrs before party,put them in a roaster and they were hot in 15 mins. I don't add sauce. I keep it in a small crockpot on the side. If you're holding the wings for a period of time I do recommend. Keeps your wings crunchy! Plus you can make differnt sauces!

THIS WAS A SUPERBOWL HIT! I had a superbowl party and served this as finger foods. I followed the recipe exactly except for the fact that I left the floured chicken in the fridge all day. It came out the perfect golden color. It tasted like something I would order from a restaurant. I made it with pollyo string cheese mozzarella sticks and pizza. DEFINITELY DELISH! GO GIANTS!!

These were very popular at my party! Letting the wings sit is the key for sure. Very easy preparation. I just didn't care for the amount of time spent by the fryer, so next time I will bake them. Great flavor and crunch! This is a great recipe and I definitely recommend it to everyone who loves wings!

These were absolutely delicious!  They were so crispy.  I divided the hot sauce mixture in half and in one portion I added some teriyaki glaze sauce and brown sugar.  It tasted delicious and gave us variety.  I will definitely make these again and again.

Really good. We used freezer bags and poured our topping in each one(wing sauce, parmasean cheese, salt & pepper, BBQ sauce, & honey mustard, etc...) and shook just before serving. Everyone had their own variety of wings on their plate. The recipe was perfect!

Delicious! I don't like wings so I made this with chicken nugget sized pieces of chicken breast meat but followed everything else almost exactly (used less butter in the sauce). They turned out great! My very difficult to please husband couldn't get enough. He now wants me to make these every Sunday during football season.

OMG!!!  These were awesome!  As so many users suggested, I used the Frank's brand hot sauce. I purchased the XTRA HOT version, as we love our spices! I used half Frank's and half butter to make the sauce. These were better than Hooters according to my brother and boyfriend. Definitely a keeper!!! Oh, and for those of you who, like myself, don't have a very big deep fryer, fry the first batch, coat in the sauce, and put on a lined cookie sheet in a 200 degree oven to keep warm.  This will also help the wings to soak up the sauce....MMMMMMMMMM GOOD!!! Thanks for the recipe!!

I followed the recipe to the letter. They were the best chicken wings I have ever had. I did redip them in the flour right before frying and used Franks hot sauce. My family loved them. I also cooked some cajun rice and made a salad to go with them for  dinner.

Thanks! Letting the wings sit until they get sticky is really the secret to crunchy wings!

I used chicken breast strips and they came out perfect! I serve with Bill's Blue Cheese Dressing on this site and get constant raves and requests for this combination.

Easy and delish. Hubby swore the deep fryer was missing, so we baked them. Healthier and great. I did spread bbq sauce over some, as suggested, for the kids.

I use boneless chicken breast cut into strips instead of using wings. We don't like a super hot sauce, so I used Crystal sauce. The flavor was just so awesome!! Since finding this recipe, I've made it 3 times; twice for my family and once for my Hubby to take to work for his shift (9 guys). Everyone raved about how good it is! I think I would rate this recipe a 10 if I could!!

I've never made Buffalo Chicken before. My boyfriend only likes breast meat, so I used chicken breast rather than wings. I used Tabasco sauce, and really liked it. To make the fried chicken though, I did it the way I usually do fried chicken- coat with seasoned flour, then egg-milk mixture, and then back in the flour miwture again. I liked it better that way. I will be making this recipe again. ***I just wanted to update my review. I love the tabasco sauce flavor but it is so hot!! So I decideed to use half bbq sauce and half tabasco sauce. My boyfriend loved it and wanted more the next day, but I realized I had used up all the bbq sauce. So I mixed ketsup and brown sugar and a squirt of mustard. I combined it with the butter nd some garlic powder. I am telling you IT WAS THE BEST CHICKEN I EVER MADE!!! I wil make it this way from now on! And my boyfriend could not get enough! ;)

I made these wings for my family and got rave reviews, but since it had a five-star rating, I am not surprised.  What I WAS surprised about is that I baked the wings (as suggested by another reviewer) instead of deep frying them and they were just like the ones you get at restaurants.  My question is this...Why would anyone fry them if they come out so well baked?  Less mess and less fat!

Much better tasting than Hooter's wings and not as greasy. I tried them both fried & baked and husband and I both liked the fried ones better.  We really liked the sauce (Used Frank's after all the great reviews) and compared it to Hooter's Mild wings.  The breading was very light but crispy (They even were crispy the next day as leftovers!). I mixed the flour mixture in a large plastic bag and added the chicken wings and shook it up to coat them completely.  To make the sauce I just melted the butter in the microwave and added the hot sauce & seasonings.  Just heated it up again in the microwave before serving.  We are already planning to make up 6 dozen for our next football party!

We just made these today and they were great.  We bought whole wings from the store and cut the tips off the wings, and then cut them into halves like they are when you eat them at a restaurant.  I followed the rest of the instructions to the T, except in addition to the sauce they suggested I found another sauce on the an internet blog that I thought was even tastier than this sauce.

These are excellent.  I didn't use the wings because I don't like chicken on the bone.  I used chicken breasts pieces.  Yummy!

These were so good, but I cheated a little bit.  I used Franks Buffalo wing sauce instead of making it myself. I used boneless chicken tenderloins cut in half and then followed the recipe for spices and frying.  I still can't believe how good they turned out and am so excited to make them again this weekend.  They are a nice option for those that like chicken wings but don't like the skin or chewing the meat off the bones.

Change this up quite a bit to use what I had on hand.  Instead of chicken wings, I used chicken thighs cut in strip.  And instead of frying, I put them on a foil-lined pan sprayed with cooking spray and sprayed the top of the chicken as well. I baked at 450 turning once for 30 mins.

Excellent hot wing recipe!!  The combination of flour and the resting time in the refrigerator makes these wings super crispy when you fry them. Yum!

The sauce can be made at any time - the original Franks hot sauce has just enough spicy to make the wings tasty, but not so spicy that you will sweat.

The basic flouring recipe/technique is a winner and one I'll use to cook up our other favorite wing recipe with an Asian style sauce.

Thank you for the great easy wing recipe!  My husband is still raving about them :D

Made these for a block party this weekend.  They were AWESOME!  Sprayed them with cooking spray and baked them in the oven @ 400 for about an hour.  The guys were all snooping thru my fridge looking for more around midnight!

these went over well and i was told they were "really good" (i'm a vegetarian and so must rely on the report of others :))but there were plenty of left-overs.... the one suggestion i got was "more sauce", which became obvious as i cooked. i might make these again for another party, but not for my family.

Yummy.  I threw the wings in a ziploc w/ flour, seasoned salt, etc and let sit in fridge while at work.  Fried them up in deep fryer when I got home and microwaved the butter/Franks red hot.  Delicious!

I made these for my daughters birthday party this weekend.  10 lbs went in under an hour.  I didn't even get to try one.  My husband and family said they were even better than any restaurant.  I ran out of flour so I used just enough to coat them lightly.  I followed the rest of the recipe to the letter.  I served these up with blue cheese.  My mom has now requested these for our Christmas buffet.  Thanks so much for the recipe.

I used this sauce for the AR recipe Buffalo Chicken rolls since I didn't have wings on hand. I doubled the hot sauce (Frank's) and marinated for about 45 minutes but next time I'll marinate it even longer. For those who want a milder taste, I think that the recommended 1/4 c. would be fine. Can't wait to try it with wings. Thanks Kelly!

We make wings all the time, but never seasoned them before frying. In this case, I took the advice from my QualityCook friend C.C. and baked the wings instead of frying. Not one person at our party could believe that they weren't fried and all loved the extra added flavor from the wonderful seasonings. Thanks Kelly!

Made these for superbowl.  Tasted the sauce and it was pretty bland, even though i used "Frank's Buffalo Wing Hotsauce"  I added a tiny bit of honey, brown sugar, ketchup and vinegar.  This gave a little sweetness but still had kick.  Sauce aside, the wings turned out really well, nice and crispy. My husband is very picky about wings, he'll only eat them from his favourite restaurant and "not from home", he devoured them though along with our 10 year old son. This could be a new fav around here:)

These wings are to die for! I also used Frank's hot sauce and the flavor is fantastic! My husband loved them so much I'm making them again tomorrow and doubling the recipe for Super Bowl. Awesome, Awesome, Awesome! Thanks for the recipe.

Tasty recipe.  Sauce could use a little more kick though.  Next time will try using more hot sauce.

Wow.  Is what everyone said when they tasted these wings.  I used my outdoor cooker and these babies turned out great.  I chose to add just a little more hot sauce but other than that it was easy to make and tasts great!!!!!!

These wings were soooooo good!  I made them exactly like the recipe called for and they were awesome.  Very crispy and flavorful!  I made the sauce like it said and I also made my own...1 bottle of Cattlemans Honey Golden and 1 cup of Frank's Red Hot.  The wings were great with both sauces.  This recipe is definitely a keeper!

This recipe was utterly fantastic! I made chicken strips instead of wings because that is what I had, and my husband and I loved them! My dad thinks he makes the best wings, but I can't wait to prove to him that I know an even better recipe. Thanks so much!

I've made this two times. The first time I made them boneless and baked them. I thought they tasted a lot like chicken tenders vs. boneless buffalo wings. This time I made regular wings and deep fried them. They were better. I had problems though with the breading falling off during the process. I think they are really good although I've had other kinds that I think are better. I don't recommned putting the wings into a ziplock during the flouring- I think it coats better if you do it in the glass dish as recommended. I will make these again.

I made a separate batch of sauces for the adults (according to recipe) and kids (half the hot sauce).  I used my deep fryer, and these came out amazing. I used Frank's Red Hot Cayenne Pepper sauce.

This is very close to the recipe that I use. The only thing that is different is that you need to add at least a 1/4 - 1/2 cup of wheat flour in order to keep the coating fluffy and not dence.

This is the best recipe for hot wings I have tried so far. To save time, I buy bottled hot wings sauce and stir them with that right before serving.  My family loves them!!!!

The only change I make is to fry them a little longer to make them more crispy. I like to fry them for about 20 minutes. 

For big football parties I will fry up 5 dozen wings the night before and refrigerate without sauce. Then on game day I just sauce them up and throw them on a grill to heat up. This also sears the sauce into the wing a little which adds more flavor.

We are huge wing fans. I baked the wings without the breading at 350 for 45 minutes. I added the paprika, cayenne, and salt to the sauce. They turned out wonderfully and easy to make. We will be saving lots by eating these at home instead of going out.

Great Recipe!  I cut up chicken breast and made buffalo strips.  Fried them up in a cast iron pan with vegetable oil.  I also mixed a little BBQ sauce into the hot sauce recipe.  Will definitly be making these again.  Great with home-made french fries too!  THANKS!

I've made these wings a number of times varying the degrees of heat and every time they are a hit!  I've baked them instead of fried them a couple of times and they're just as good either way.

I usually let them marinate for a few hours in the fridge in a large ziploc bag that I turn over a few times.  The marinating is an important step.

Very easy to customize to your own liking.  Thanks Kelly for a great recipe...It's a keeper!

this was great! and i don't even like buffalo wings from restaurants etc.  everyone else liked them as well. 
i tried it on both chicken wings and chicken breast and both turned out wonderful.  i have made this 3 times now.  i used franks red hot (regular and a bit of xtrahot to get it more spicy). i think the resutls depend  on what kind of hot sauce you use so pick one you like.
i love this dish, it is one of my favorites from this site.  soooo good.

My husband and I love the chicken. It was crispy and juicy. However, we thought it was too buttery so we added more hot sauce.

Never having made buffalo wings before, I made sure to read all the reviews before I set out on this new adventure.  I followed a lot of the advice given:  I used chicken breasts cut into strips the size of wings, made sure to coat the strips AND marinate for 90 min, doubled the sauce, and fried the "wings" in olive oil (just enough to coat the bottom of the pan).  The result was GREAT!  My husband asked for a little more spice next time, but the "wings'" apparent mildness didn't stop him from all but licking his plate clean.  Next time I will add more cayenne to the flour mixture and perhaps experiment with a hotter hot sauce.  I can't wait to take these to parties!

This was not a bad recipe.  Instead of wings, I cut several bonelss chicken breasts into chuncks.  I thought that the sauce could have used some more spice to it which surprised me since I am not fond of overly spicy foods. Also, when I went to fry the pieces, the coating didn't turn out like I expected.  I think next time, I will skip the flour coating all together or possibly use an egg/flour coating or maybe even  breadcrumbs.  I will also add some extra garlic and red pepper to the sauce.

I just want to let everyone know that these were the best wings I have every made.  My family would eat them as I would add them to the dinner plate- then my husband would bring home more chicken begging me to make some more for lunch the next day!  Thank you for the easy to follow and best chicken wings we have ever had!

This recipe was extremely tasty.  Although my husband did not think they were hot enough he still liked them.  The kids ate them up and wanted more.  Thanks for sharing!!

I used boneless breast strips because I like boneless buffalo wings much better than traditional ones.  I think because of this change to the recipe, the cooking time was too long.  They came out tough.  Also, next time I cook them, I will use a different brand of hot sauce (I used Red Hot).  The sauce didn't taste like the restaurant's does.  Maybe next time I'll use good old Tabasco.

Fabulous!  Fantastic!  We absolutely loved them!  Hubby says better than our favorite place for wings (Wild Wing Cafe in Charleston SC)!  Used Justin Wilson's hot sauce!  YUMMMMMM!  Thanks Kelly for an awesome recipe.

Made the sauce and just one chicken breast cut into strips, wanted to see if I could serve this too my family.  No way.  Too darn hot.  LOL.  Tasted great to me, but no way the rest of the family would eat it.  I even cut the hot sauce in half.  Woo Hoo, mouth is still on fire.  Don't know how some of you added more hot sauce or red pepper.  Will make again, but only for myself and only when I feel like fire in my mouth.

WOW!!!!!  My husband considers himself a wings expert, and he loves these!!!  We're still working to perfect the sauce, though.  A quarter cup of Tabasco makes it VERY hot.  We also tried Frank's and Crystal's.  Both worked well, but seemed too mild in comparison.

This recipe is wonderful.  I like my chicken seasoned all the way through.  So I seasoned my chicken like normal using unseasoned meat tenderizer, accent, seasoning salt and black pepper.  I let it sit for 45 min. Then I added the flour mixture without the salt.  Then I placed it in the refridgerator for 60 min.  I was afraid to use cayenne pepper...I used crushed red pepper instead in the flour mixture.  I also used white pepper in the sauce.  I made a double of the sauce because I used boneless skinless thighs instead of wings.  Awesome.  I will use less butter the next time and use cayenne pepper to make it spicer.  But it was perfect for the kids using crushed red pepper.  Not too spicy using crushed red pepper.  My husband just loved it.  They are ready for the next time.  This is a keeper. This is the third recipe I have used and this is the only one that came out perfect.   Thank you!

Mighty good!  I ran out of hot sauce, used up all the tabasco that I had left and mixed in catsup to make 1/4 cup-- added a bit of salt too.  Mighty hot but mighty good!  Thanks for the recipe.

Awesome!  I made 3 lbs. of wings, and my hubby ate all but a couple of wings.  I have also found that just deep frying the wings naked - without flour, then draining on a rack and placing in a serving bowl with Texas Pete Wing Sauce is just as good (hotter which is what we love!) and much quicker.  So good with chunky blue cheese dressing and celery.  Thanks Kelly for a great tasting recipe!

I have made these twice in the past two weeks and each time...they came out wonderful. Even my son that does not like anything on the bone...ate them and even asked for more. The first time I made them....I used Texas Pete Buffalo Wing sauce on them and the second time...which was the other night...I used the copy cat recipe for the jack daniels sauce that is served in fridays on them and they were so, so yummy and there was not one left! I definitely recommend trying it with the jack sauce. It is alot of work but so well worth the taste. Thank you for the best wing recipe yet and actually...I do not think that I will even bother looking for another one. This is truly a keeper  :)

Just wondering why so many reviewers on here Baked their wings? I thought deep frying is obviously the best tasting method. Plus the wings will be a lot crispier.

I LOVED this. Anyone who wants to be a wing snob, just sit down. These were delicious and crispy. My only changes were 1/2 cup of flour & 1/2 cup of corn starch with seasonings for the flour mix. Deep fried for 15 minutes, and they were crispy even when sauced. I made my own sauce since more people in my house like a BBQ sauce. The secret really is the chilling in the fridge and letting the flour and the chicken become friends. Basically the secret I've discovered in all chicken frying.

These are SO Crispy and Juicy! I add a little more cayenne to the dry coating mixture, and more black pepper and let sit in fridge for 60 minutes. I deep fry mine about 12 minutes and they are SO good!! I also use a mixture of Louisiana Hot Sauce and Tapatio with the melted butter to dip and drain. Wonderful!!

I did 50+ wings tonight so I did the recipe x5.  Next time I would only use 1/4 cup of butter for the same amount of wings because we found them way to rich.  I also added 2 tablespoons of pepper because we love pepper.  We also omitted the flour because we avoid adding fat to more fat.  All the spices were excellent!  I just added all of them after frying the wings in Extra Virgin Olive Oil.  Definitely a must try.  I'd give this recipe a 5 out of 5 with my changes though.

I made these for my brother, a very picky eater, and he (and I) loved them! One step I added was to kind of marinate the chicken in some ranch seasoning mix, red pepper flakes, and hot sauce...just enough to coat the wings a bit. I let the marinade sit on the wings for a full day in the refrigerator or freezer before coating the wings at all. Then, I prepared as normal. This gave the chicken itself amazing flavor throughout, just the right amount of kick once you get past the spicy breading.

We really liked these wings and I wish I had followed the recipe! I was afraid wings would be too hot,so I cut the hot sauce half--big mistake--next time I will make per recipe. Thanks for easy hot wings *****

I made these last night the way the recipe said to make them. They were good for my first try. I will be tweaking these another night. I love the fact that I paid 5 bucks for 60 wings at the store and can dress them how I want. I will never buy these from a restaurant again.

Great recipe! As with all recipes, I will be adjusting the seasonings to my taste a little. I was so happy that the skin got nice and crispy and it wasn't time consuming. Easy!

Made these tonight to go with our dinner and they were tasty, especially the sauce. The flour mixture was a bit bland but it is a good base for all kinds of toppings on the finished product. A nice crunch when biting into a piece and the meat was moist and tasty. Next time will try baking them as other reviewers suggest.

Tried it today. Followed every direction but for the sauce I used bottled sweet baby rays wing sauce & glaze in buffalo style sauce and added butter to that. It was amazing. I do believe you need to follow the refrigeration step for it to be this amazing! I did it for 60mins, could to help myself to wait 90. Lol :)

Easier than I expected and absolutely wonderful.  Followed directions exactly, however, next time I will use a bit more butter and a little less hot sauce.  Just my personal preference.  Thank you for sharing this.

We like these even though I baked them instead of frying.  Frying would definitely taste better, I'm sure.  All in all, they came out very good and I'll be making them often.  Thanks.

Made these tonight for the football game.  My family LOVED them.  I like other reviewers baked rather than fried (I was too lazy to clean the fryer) and they were PERFECT!  I doubled the batch and used both hot and bbq sauces.  This recipe is a keeper.  Will be making it again, and again and again....

Absolutely delicious. I don't think I'll ever be going back to a bar for some wings after discovering this recipe. As long as you follow the recipe the chicken will come out golden, crispy and tender. The sauce is everything you would expect from a Buffalo wing.

Pretty close to Hooters...my only gripe would be, if you're not going to use the buffalo sauce then the flour mixture needs more seasoning...other than that they were good...will make these again...thanks

The first time I made these, they were a hit with my husband! They taste sooooo good! Since then I have made them a few more times and they keep being a hit in my house. I make them as is, I don't make any changes to the recipe other than using more hot sauce (my husband loves spicy foods.) I made these for my sister and her boyfriend and they raved about them, they said these were the best wings they've ever had! Ha! Her boyfriend even got "food coma." Lol

This recipe will have your wings tasting just like the restaurant.  I season my wings with creole season, onion powder, & garlic powder ( I am from New Orleans & we like our season).  I fried the wings and made the buffalo sauce as the recipe stated & O my they are good!  My family loves this recipe!

Hands down, THE best wing recipe out there...

Only problem was my "fry baby" could only fry 5 or so wings at a time, so it took me and hour to get thru the frying process for 20 wings....time for a bigger fryer for me:)

Served it to a "wing freak" and they loved em....

I used boneless chicken thighs and used a deep fryer - other than that I followed the recipe exactly. My husband can't stop raving about how good this is. There is a perfect balance in the "heat" of the sauce and the chicken. Thank you! This will be one of my new football day menu items!

Extremely good. If you use a deep fryer it only takes 10 minutes with 375 degree heat. You can use any sauce you desire to enhance the wings, if you even need anything at all.

Wow! I followed the recipe for all ingredients.  I coated them in the flour mixture, let them sit for a few minutes and coated a second time.  Sprayed with Pam and baked for 45 minutes.  Put some sauce on them and baked for 5 more minutes.  They were so good, I can't wait to make them when I can let them sit first.  Could not tell they were baked at all.  I made 24 total for 3 of us and the pan was empty within 20 minutes.

Great recipe - BUT - save excess flour and re-coat the wings a second time after the 90 minute period just before frying.  I also allow the floured wings to sit about 3 to 4 hours before re-coating and then frying.  GREAT WINGS and the only way I make them now.

Had a gluten free house guest challenge me to make crispy hot wings. Mission Accomplished! Only thing I changed was the flour to gluten free all purpose and I use normal sized wings and legs. We ended up leaving the floured chicken in the fridge overnight and they were fine for dinner the next night. Kept the temp the same and fried them 7 or so minutes each side. Great without the sauce too and just salted for your nonspicy people.

Won't make again.  I deep fried them nice and crispy but the coating was bland and the wings didn't shrink much, they were bulky and not juicy.  I will stick to my usual method which is to bake the wings from frozen for about 1 hour.  They are much more tender, flavorful, and crispy this way without adding any flour.  I usually use Franks and butter for sauce but it is a bit on the greasy side.  The only bottled sauce I tried that I like is Heritage Farms so I'll use that if I don't want all that butter.

A rose by any other name!! Crispy without being breaded.  I used Louisiana Wing Sauce (Franks is more vinegar-y to me) with the butter and they are just the right heat for a pot luck.  I just put hotter sauce on the side for the sadists, like me.  :) Call 'em whatever you want, Buffalo, these are really really good.  I did a trial run for Superbowl tomorrow and the OM has eaten almost half already.

We love this recipe, and I found the video so helpful!  The only thing I do differently, is double the hot sauce in the sauce part of the recipe...we like them spicy and it cuts down on the butter.

Just made this recipe tonight for my family of seven (50 wings - so I had to adjust the recipe accordingly), they were the BEST!!! The only changes I made was to add 3 crushed cloves of garlic to the pan with a couple Tablespoons of butter to saute it before adding the remaining butter and Frank's Red Hot. Also, due to making so many and only being able to fry small batches at a time in my fryer, I baked them in the oven at 375 for 30 minutes, then I fried each batch for only 5 minutes. They came out absolutely perfect!!! Thank you!!

My wings turned out perfect thanks to this recipe. I used the whole chicken wings instead of the wingettes but they were still great. I used Frank's hot sauce and I tell you what, these were better than any wing i've tried in a restarant. I will be using this recipe for as long as I cook!

I would have given it more stars if I were able. My family is a very picky wing eater...so I wasnt sure about making them myself at home. I tried this recipe because of all the wonderful ratings. Delicious! I made sure to leave them in the fridge a full 90 minutes since I read that helped with the crispiness. Am I glad I did! I have a pretty decent Krups deep fryer.....so it only took 8 minutes to fully cook. Other than that...I followed directions exactly. You will not be disappointed.

These came out pretty good. I really liked how the chicken came out crispy. I did put it in the refrigerator for 90 minutes. I just have to say I'll have to experiment with the sauce ratio. Will definitely recommend and make again. Thanks!

pretty good, but a lot of butter. Next time I am going to cut back on the butter or substitute it. You can change the heat and flavor depending on what hot sauce you use.

My wife said that these are probably the best wings she's eaten.  The only thing I would suggest is doubling the sauce.

I followed this recipe just as it is written.  It was fantastic.  One of my daughters doesn't like hot sauce so she ate the wings plain and the rest of the family loved the wings with our homemade hotsauce mixed with the rest of the ingredients.  We will be making this all the time.  The only thing I would mention is to make sure to pat your chicken dry before you put the floor mixture.  I forgot to do that.  I wouldn't change anything!

Have made these pretty much at least once a week every week since i found this recipe a year or whatever ago.  I give out this recipe and share it every chance I get.  I have probably 50 pictures of these wings on my facebook page.  

However, I sub out the two pepper spices listed for habanero and red savinas.  I have made this recipe so many times i usually just eyeball the ingredients until the batter color is right because we like our wings very spicy.  We have tried this batter recipe (various sauces) with paprika, crushed red pepper, cayenne, habanero, and red savinas.

We have gotten to where we prefer the batter to be spicier and then put on much less sauce and the wings are on the drier side, so we put a little more ground habanero and red savinas in than we used to and then we omit some hot sauce and butter.  

Frank's hot sauce is pretty mild, so we don't use it.  We have made these with all the red Tabasco sauces, Frank's red and wing, Grace's, Louisiana, three different kinds of Barbecue sauce, garlic butter, Cholula's, Tapatio, and another specialty kind from a local market here in the area.  These are very versatile wings and can be made to suit anybody.  

For frying, we thaw the wings, batter, let them sit in fridge for 90 minutes, preheat fryer 60 minutes through the 90 minutes, and cook them at 375 for 20 to 30 minutes, pretty straightforward.  I have uploaded probably seven to ten pictures of my wings in various forms.

I have never had Hooters wings - but these taste like restaurant style buffalo wings. I made exactly to recipe and it came out very good - even second day (actually think it was a little better the 2nd day since the sauce soaked in)! Easy and will make again.  One suggestion would be to make a little more sauce in case you like more sauce. oh and don't forget the ranch or bleu cheese dip!

I made these following Amydoll's baking instructions exactly. I also added some garlic powder, onion powder and season salt to the flour as someone else mentioned. These were a huge hit with my guys and we will have them again and again.

We had these last night and decided to go healthy and bake, as one reviewer did. But, to get the real taste next time, I think I prefer less batter and frying. Anyway, they were very good. I thought they would be hot [in seasoning, which I avoid], but the butter and hot sauce was delicious.

Very good and relatively easy. I didn't have paprika so I used garlic powder with the cayene pepper but I'll have to increase those amounts because we didn't taste the seasoning at all. Very crunchy, though!

Great recipe, I've made these many times. Not a big fan of wings, not enough meat on them,  so I thinly slice up chicken thighs. Thanks for the recipe.

Tried them baked and fried - DEFINITELY worth the effort to deep-fry them.  MUCH better that way. This is my third weekend in a row to make them - and my kids are starting to bring their friends home for them!  I don;t have a deep fryer, so I used the candy thermometer in a regular pot method.  Make sure you have a REALLY nice thermometer.  And watch out!  The temperature really dips between batches. I may have to bite the bullet and invest in a deep fryer. We put them out and then have bowls of different sauces for all the different palates.  I prefer THIS sauce, although I decrease the butter by half to up the intensity.

Great recipe - I was unable to find "drummettes" in the store, so I used the frozen Party Style Wings.  Although small, they were big on taste.  As per another reviewers comments, if you like hotter wings, lower the amount of butter and increase the amount of hot sauce.  I used 1/3 butter and 2/3 sauce and it was still not hot enough some!  I fried them in a bit of oil until just brown and then baked at 350 for 20 min, basting each time I turned them, which was once or twice.  Definetly try this recipe for great wings done at home!

We followed this recipe exactly and they are great!  For temp consistency, we fried them in our electric wok and they turned out perfectly cooked and golden and crispy.  Rather than tossing the wings in the sauce, we left it on the side and dipped the wings in it to match each of our tastes.

After trying these we never eat store-bought wings ever again. These are simply amazing! 

Just one note, I use the Franks hot sauce, not buffalo wing sauce, it's sooo much better. Enjoy!

This recipes is fantastic! If you like your wings a little milder (as my boyfriend does), omit the cayenne pepper and add a little extra butter and some cola to the sauce. It will help tone down the spice a bit without effecting the flavor. As far as measurements go - when I'm toning down the sauce a bit I usually add about 1/8 of a cup extra butter and I don't measure the cola, I would say approximately 1/8 of a cup. It's best to do it by taste.

I followed the recipe exactly, except I baked them for about 50 minutes. I coated the pan with pam, put the floured wings on that pan, refridgerated them for 90 min.  Baked at 375 for 15 min, then 350 for 20 min. Coated wings w Pam (both sides), flipped them over, and baked at 400 for about 15 min. They were delicious and crispy. Will be making these again. YUM

These were great. We skipped the cayenne because we weren't sure if it would make them too hot for our guests. I will use it next time. I like some heat in my wings. We did bake them at 375 for 45 minutes.

Doesn't get any easier or better than this! You just soon make a double batch to start....these don't stick around for long.

Franks Red Hot Sauce... Mmmm. To coat the wings, I just threw everything in a tupperware, closed it, and shook. Its alot faster. For my sauce, I didnt have enough butter, but it was still good. Lets just say its healthier... Best served while still crispy, and freshly coated in the buffalo sauce!

This is an amazing recipe and it tastes just like I got them at a restaurant. I didn't have any Chicken Wings, so I instead used Chicken Breast cut into thin strips and chunks. They turned out absolutely delicious. I followed the recipe almost exactly, only changing one thing. I double battered the Chicken by first battering them, putting them in another bowl and wetting with some water(Milk would work excellent as well). Then just stick them back in the batter and you'll have some nice, thick battered Chicken. Just like the restaurants make.

These are TRULY fantastic! They don't have to be so complicated, though, or take so long.   I dip them in flour with cajun seasoning and let them sit while I'm frying the previous batch for about 12 minutes.  When they come out, we dip them in a mixture of half melted butter and half Frank's Red Hot. They're truly incredible!  I don't know anyone who would drink Zinfandel with them, either. (See the drink recommendation.) They should be served with your favorite cold beer.

These are so good. I use chicken breast tenders and coat with a little salt and garlic powder first.

I often leave mine in the fridge for longer than called for depending on whats going on.  I asked in Hooters one day, and they said they flour theirs in the morning and based on demand they may stay in there till the afternoon. I have found that cooking time is a lot shorter with the wings available to me, usually takes around ten minutes. I also skipped the watery hot sauce for Batch #218 Louisiana Style Hot Sauce by Original Juan, but dont put in as much as they have excellent taste and enough heat to spare. If you need hotter they will have it, and the flavor is awesome.

These wings came out perfectly --so much better than pre-seasoned frozen ones.  I didn't have the Bob's Hot Sauce others were talking about, so just used what I had on hand --Part Lousiana and part Canjun hot sauces.  The wings were still frozen when I floured them, so just let them unthaw with the flour coating for about an hour. Don't see how this recipe could be any better.

Never made wings before and everyone thought these were great.  I BAKED  them instead of frying them and they came out really crisp and  people thought they were fried.  Must refrigerate and spray with oil while cooking.  Definitly  a do again.

Wow! These are wonderful. Followed recipe exactly. We did try this recipe on drumsticks and didn't care for it as much. Was good but small pieces of chicken are much better. Thanks for the recipe.

OUTSTANDING!  This review is coming from a woman who has lived in Buffalo ( the chicken wing capital of the country) for most of her life.   These ROCKED!  Our family has had our share of many different versions of  chicken wings that dare to call themselves "Buffalo Chicken WIngs"  But this was the 2nd time I attempted to make them.  My first attempt was horrible (Different recipe).  THis recipe is OUTSTANDING!  My teen son was sooooo happy when I made them for New Years Eve  because they were fantastic!  SO happy they came out great.  Followed the recipe to a T. and now we can have wings without spending all that extra $$ by ordering out.   !  HURRAY!

Yummy!!! For some reason I always thought that wings would be hard to make. These were so easy and taste just like, if not better, then those in the restaurant! Realized at the last minute that I did not have any cayenne pepper so I did leave that out. Without it these still had that great buffalo flavor just not the 'kick' some may be looking for. Even my 6 yr old loved these and ate half a dozen. Will be making again for sure!!!

Wow. What a good recipe. Taste like restaurant style wings. I mixed hot sauce with ketchup to coat the wings. It was a big hit.

Excellent, spicy and fresh chicken wings. So easy to do. I do understand that these may not be authentic, but for the vast majority of the U.S. these are what is considered 'buffalo chicken wings'. I made it with fresh Maytag blue cheese dressing, celery and hot dogs with mustard. Unbelievable.

I followed the recipe exactly as written.  The wings were nice and crispy (deep fried them for 11 minutes), the sauce had just the right amount of heat, and they were very easy to make.  I'll definitely make these again!

These wings were amazing! Just as good or better than what you get in most restaurants! The only change I made was coating the wings in egg before rolling them in flour and adding extra cayenne pepper for more spice! Excellent recipe.

This is the most requested dish I make from my family - which includes two teenaged boys - and their friends. I make them as directed. A few hints: Refrigerating the battered wings is crucial. Don't pack them too tight. I batter each wing separately, it doesn't take much longer and makes such you get a good coating. Fry the full 15 minutes - it makes a difference. Be sure to turn if you're frying in a pan that doesn't completely cover the wings. Don't overcrowd the wings in the fryer. I use Frank's hot sauce - it's awesome - and I use equal parts sauce and butter. Some reviewer recommend baking. Yes, that would be healthier, but sometimes you just have to live a little.

I made the sauce as directed, but sliced up a few chicken breasts and sauteed them with olive oil and some of the extra spices used to make the sauce. Half the household doesn't care for spicy food so I had the sauce separate as a dip for grilled buffalo chicken wraps. Those of us who like spicy food loved the flavor of the sauce. I'll have to double the recipe next time.

I make chicken nuggets using this recipe.  Tenderloins cut into bite size pieces, coat with milk, shake in flour mixture, fry or bake, then coat with sauce.  A family favorite, football night classic.

First time I've actually tried to make my own chicken wings.  Amazing. A made a bowl of them and they were all gone within five minutes! Only thing I would say is that the sauce was quite thin but I guess I can work on that.

These were great!  The only thing I changed was that I baked them for awhile first before deep frying them, and I only did that because that was how a bar I worked for years ago used to do it!  I was hoping it made it a little less fattening too--but I don't think so!

Followed the recipe as written. Used Franks Red Hot. PERFECT wings! I also made the Japanese Chicken Wings from this site and they were very good too, a good contrast to the buffalo wings and my husband couldn't decide which ones he liked best :o)
My son doesn't like hot wings so he either eats them before I add the sauce to them or he has lemon-pepper wings which are nothing but them tossed in lemon-pepper seasoning right after frying, skipping the hot sauce/butter "bath". They are excellent that way too, better than the ones at "our" pub.

I have to say I have tried many recipes for buffalo wings and this   is the best one so far!!! My husband approved with thumbs up considering he used to fry these in his home town. Easy to follow directions and simple on- hand ingredients make this recipe one to pass on to my friends and family. I did not change a thing and we enjoyed them very much! Thank you for sharing.

Yes the refrigerator part is the most important part, it keeps batter on chicken and makes it crispy! And you don't have to leave it on the entire 90 minutes. I left on for like 30. One other thing I did was, after we fried them, I basted them with the dipping sauce and let sit and soak in. DELICIOUS! And this recipe is so simple!

My god this is good. The breading is great, refrigerating the chicken in the flour is a great technique that I will have to consider for chicken fried steak in the future. The only thing I changed was I added a little apple sauce to the buffalo/butter sauce. I find that adding apple sauce to anything (steak marinade, buffalo wings, etc) makes it ever so slightly better. My boyfriend loved it and so did my two friends who spend most of their time searching for delicious wings in Chicago.

This wing is HOT!!! I have been looking for hot wings like this for a very long time, tried a couple of others but couldn't just get it right. Goes very well with a good ol' blu cheese dip...

This was the BEST! Finally I've found a way to satisfy my wing craving without looking for babysitters for a trip to the local pub. YUM! We tried these both deep fried and baked, and both were delicious. I actually think I preferred the baked though! The skin was crunchier, which to me is a bonus!  --[tip to those without a deep fryer- I put a glass casserole dish in the oven, half full with oil and heated to 375. I then put the wings in to fry. Be cautious when opening the oven- I originally put in too much oil and it started to burn on the bottom when spilled, causing my eyes to water. Open door with face turned away!].-- I also used the leftover wing sauce as dipping sauce- I just added more Franks to spice it up a bit more and DELICIOUS!!

The sauce was great! We used a deep fryer for the first time to cook the chicken wings, which we got frozen at the store. Apparently that batch of chicken was on steroids because they were the largest wings we have seen! Needless to say they took more room up in the deep fryer, so we had to cook them in batches. We combined them in a bowl with the sauce as they came out hot and fresh. Unfortunately, this caused the coating to get a little soggy. We kept the leftovers and the next day at a family dinner, we made another batch of sauce and broiled them in the oven for about 10 minutes. This crisped them up just fine and they were delicious! We also added a little cayenne pepper to the sauce on the 2nd day to give it a little extra kick! Great recipe!

Absolutely Delicious!  I sprayed the wings with cooking spray, then baked on a rack(so the oil drains) over a cookie sheet @ 350 for 35 minutes, then turned the heat to 400 degrees for 10 minutes to crisp them up.  We like it hot so I just tossed it with extra cayenne pepper, Franks Red Hot and enjoyed; I even used crushed Pork Rinds instead of the flour mixture to make this low carb.  PERFECT and satisfying!  Thanks for the baking suggestion!

This was a great recipe! I loved the batter, and soaking it in the fridge is a must! I did use my own sauce, though, but that was just personal preference. :)

I baked these, per other reviews, at 400 degrees for 40 min. since I needed to make large quantities. I then served them at a graduation party to a group of avid buffalo wing fans. They had seconds, thirds and fourths and asked to take some home. I even served a batch with Big Al's K.C. Bar-B-Q Sauce and they went quickly too. Awesome!

Great recipe! I made this for dinner one night and it tasted superb, so I decided to bring it to a birthday potluck. The entire tray (about 1 1/2 recipes) was GONE in less than 20 minutes, as was the blue cheese dip that I served it with. I guess that it's just that good! Perfect recipe, no alterations - a 5 star in my book!

i use similar recipe but add 1/4 pint of vinegar to butter and hot sauce and then reduce and thicken with cornflour.the real secret to crispness is to put wings on a rack in fridge overnight, this draws all moisture from skin and is what they do in most restaurants.

Delish!  I did have to change it a bit because of the tastes of some of my guests, I leftout the cayenne pepper which killed me to do but I didn't want to make seperate batches. I made these the night before, fried them till light brown and then the next day I threw them in the oven to heat up, they were perfect!   Thanks for the recipe!

My only regret is that I don't have a bigger deep fryer.  I didn't wait the hour after coating the wings & they still turned out awesome.

Very good recipe.  I don't like wings, so I sliced up some boneless chicken breasts and they came out just fine.  Also, I didn't pour the sauce over them, I put the sauce in a bowl and dipped the breast pieces in it.  Much better and not as messy!

This is a recipe I have made forever! The only thing I change is that I use self-rising flour! It really gives it a little extra crunch. Definately don't skip on the refrigeration!! I also change up the sauce ratio depending on how HOT our guests like them. Also, tasting the sauce it may seem hot but it will lose some of it's spice when tossed with the wings. FYI- this is actually a Hooter's wing recipe :)

All I have to say is OMG these are soooooo good!!!! Even without the sauce my 6 yo son ate 8 of these wings and he is a picky eater. If he eats it you know you have a fantastic recipe! Tried this recipe about  101 ways, and breading and putting in the fridge is the key. Thank you so much for the awesome recipe!!!!! **UPDATE* Used this same technique for fried chicken tonight and it was sooooo good!! Gonna try it on chicken nuggets this week. Thanks again for the wonderful recipe.

Excellent Wings! To change it up a bit as I like hot and garlic added a tsp of minced garlic and a tsp grated parmesean to the sauce. Used Franks Buffalo Style hot sauce. This is HOT but tastes great.  Thank you for the recipe!

There really isn't anything that I can say that hasn't been said already.  This is a spot-on recipe.  Not one single change needed!  I made a quadruple batch of the recipe and cooked them in 2 batches in the Turkey fryer.  After the first batch was done, I spread them on a cookie sheet and put then in the oven at 200 degrees to keep warm until the second batch was done.  I used Frank's Red Hot sauce with the seasonings and butter.  OMG...they were amazing!!  This will become a go-to party recipe in my house!

Great tasting wings! I used the frank buffalo sauce b/c that was all I had, but I'll try a different kind next time just to experiment a bit. I used flour with half and no flour with the rest. I prefer no flour just b/c they come out crispier but both were still very good!

I made these for a super bowl party and they were a huge hit. I used the raw pre-cut chicken tenders and coated them with the flour mixture the day before. I also made the hot sauce-butter the day before and reheated it in the microwave before coating the fried chicken. That worked fine, but the mix did seperate a bit and required lengthy re-stirring. In retrospect, it probably would have been easier to make that portion while frying the chicken. Also, I'm not sure how hot the oil in my fryer was (it was borrowed so I'd never used it before) but the first batch, which I cooked for 10 minutes before checking, were overcooked. I shortened the subsequent batches to only five minutes and that was much better. I've also made this quick and simple (though not healthy) sauce several times since that party and it's always been delicious, even on a buffalo chicken pizza once.

This recipe was GREAT ! My husband and I have been big fans of Buffalo Wings for a long time, but never could pull it off at home. THIS RECIPE CHANGED ALL THAT ! The chicken stayed nice and crispy, I think due to the flour mixture. I would recommend letting it sit for the full 90 minutes. I used the classic "Franks" Buffalo sauce recipe. On a scale of 1 - 10, this was an 11 :)

Perfect recipe! I tripled the recipe and fried them in three batches.  I don't have a deep fryer so I just fried them on the stove and used a candy/oil thermometer to check the temp.  I also covered half of them in the hot sauce (using Texas Pete) as directed, and the other half in barbecue sauce for my kids. To make the barbecue sauce I just substituted bottled sauce for the hot sauce in the butter mixture. I agree with other reviewers that the key is to refrigerate the wings for the full time to get a good coating. I will be making these again and again!

These turned out well for us. It is true that it tastes like restaurant wings! We baked them versus frying them, and they were still great.

I made it the way the recipe says (really great!) and then I made it a different way too.  I pulled the skin off the wings and sprinkled cayenne pepper and pam over the wings.  Then I baked them until they were done (it took a while, maybe 45 minutes at 350?).  Then I brushed on the sauce.  My husband prefers the baked method.  Either way great recipe!

great recipe, my boyfriend said they were the best he'd ever had. the directions need some tweaking, however. i don't think you want the oil heating on the stove for the 60-90 minutes the wings are sitting in the fridge!

This really are just like restaurant wings, even better! These are my favorite to make. I do cut the butter a little, but I just have to deep fry them. Letting them sit in the fridge with the flour mixture makes a big difference. I skipped that step once because I was pressed for time. They we still very good, just not as crispy.

I couldn't believe how great these came out.  I took a chance I did the baked version first and I promise you, if you love wings but don't love the calories go for this version.  You will not be disappointed. Just make sure you wait the 90 minutes (at least) in the fridge.  I baked mine in my small B&D convection oven using the rectangular pan & insertable grill rack so the fat from the skin would drip off of them even.  I only baked them for 35 minutes on 400 degrees (flipping once in between)using the CONVECTION setting so they would be evenly browned.  I took the advice of another reveiwer and used less butter in the sauce, making it spicier & less fattening.  I'm in heaven now :)

These are the best!  I made one batch as stated, but the next one I mixed the butter with teriyaki sauce and minced garlic.  Grandkids thought I was the best cook ever when they tasted these great wings.

If you are wondering if you should still make these if you don't have a fryer- I would say no. The sauce is awesome- on any chicken- however this recipe only really tastes 5 star good when they are fried. The breading just doesn't turn out right in the oven. I'm thinking of buying a fryer JUST because of this recipe- because with a fryer they are so amazing. I won't buy hot wings out ever again!!

Made it for a church function and some people didn't even get to try them because they were gone so quickly. I baked them to make the sauce stick a little better.

I got rave reviews last night at our Superbowl party for these wings.  The only alterations I made were to increase the garlic powder and then I baked them for half and hour and then threw them in the fryer real quick to crisp up.

These wings were the "bomb!" My teenage son and his friends gobbled them up and asked for more. I added a little bit of honey to the sauce. Definitley sit them in the fridge for the 90 minutes!

I was so excited to try these and after reading the reviews, decided to try baking them, spraying with PAM, etc.  I must have done something wrong (obviously) because they ended up a flour-y mess with no crisp.  Fried them a few minutes and am sure had I followed the recipe exactly and just fried them - they'd be great!

Made this for New Year's Eve party! They were wonderful! I actually prepped the wings the night before too, so all we had to do was fry them that day! We made made 4lbs (and a table full of food) and only had 7 people (3 were kids), all but a few were gone.  We did make about 1/4 with sweet smokey bbq sauce for the kids. These were good too!

Excellent. This was my first time making wings from scratch, so it was slow going. I realized quickly that the frozen wings had to be thawed... if I had thought of this earlier, it would have taken much less time. I was in a hurry though. At any rate, I did what the recipe said and they came out great. Only change was that I left the wings to sit in the refrigerator overnight prior to frying, since it took so long to thaw them (low oven heat).

These are awesome! I took the advice of another reviewer and just use frank's hot sauce with some butter melt it in a sauce pan and then toss the wings in the sauce when they're finished frying, oh and I used a deep fryer for 10 mins @ 375

Love this recipe. In the UK they don't know what a good hot wing is. We bake them instead of frying and never have leftovers.

To Die For! Better than any restaurant's wings. I followed the recipe exactly, but tripled everything. I heated up the leftovers in the oven in a glass dish at 350 degrees for 20-25 minutes and they turned out just as great as the first time! Thanks for the recipe. I think I might try these with a BBQ sauce some time.

Very good alternative to fried chicken wings.  I still prefer the fried version, but this was a great option.  The tip on spraying them with Pam five minutes before they are done was a great idea.

I made this last week and everyone loved it! The chicken was very tender and the spice was just right. I baked them, drained the excess grease from the pan, put the sauce on the wings, then broiled them for 5 - 10 minutes on each side. Perfect! Thanks for sharing.

Made for the first time tonight.  No alterations.  A local restaurant in the area has $.35 wing night that you must wait in line for.  These were every bit as good and much cheaper.  My family flipped over them!!!  Thanks will make again without alterations.

This is the best "Hot Wings" recipe!! I made the chicken wings and the next time I made it with chicken tenders. I coated, refrigerated and coated again. GREAT!! Delicious with blue cheese dressing.

These are really really good. I baked mine in the oven in a glass baking dish. Next time I will spray the dish with cooking spray because they did stick. I doubled the amount of cayenne because I like it hot! I cooked a whole big bag of drummies and they were all eaten that night!

After reading some of the reviews I made some adjustments. I coated the wings really well with the flour mix and used a bottled wing sauce (hot chix) which I added smart balance and more hot sauce to.

These wings are nothing short of fantastic!  After finding this recipe just 2 weeks ago, we've made them several times now - my husband and I are addicted!  The key is allowing them to sit in the refrigerator, however, this last time I left them in there for about 1/2hr instead of longer and they still came out perfect.  After deep frying I put them into a plastic container with the wing sauce, put the lid on and gently shook it until the wings were coated - this is such an easy method and helps to coat all the wings evenly.  I have made these wings using Lousiania hot sauce as well as a honey-garlic version... all I can say is yum... yum...  will definitely make again and again... thanks for the recipe!!

This was good, I didnt have a deep fryer so I did it in a wok. I felt that there should have been a more cripy texture so I put them in in the oven after I fried them and they turned out a little crispier.

While living in Japan, the American food I miss the most is wings.  You'll find me at TGIFridays Yokohama every few weeks just to have wings.  I have made this in Japan and in the US many times and it's been a long learning process to get it right. I carefully coat each one,lay them out in a glass dish layer by by layer, and sprinkle flour between each layer.  This will require about 50% more coating mix than the recipe lists.  It's very important that each wing is fully and not haphazardly coated.  When loading into the fry basket, I also stir the wing arond in the coating just to ensure full coverage.  After leaving them in the fridge for at least 3 hours, the method of preparation is key.  I have made them in a cast iron pan, in a small deep fryer and in a turkey fryer.  Getting the oil hot enough to cook the wings in about 10 min. time is critical.  Otherwise, they'll absorb too much oil and the coating become too greasy/soggy.  It's difficult for me to control the temp in a cast iron pan, so if I use a small deep fryer, I do them a few at a time so as not to lower the oil temperature too much and cause too much oil absorption by the wings.  The turkey fryer stays hot and I can fry many at a time and yields picture perfect wings!!  I use Frank's Buffalo Wing sauce, but if preparing your own from this recipe, I prefer to add about 1/4 as much red wine vinegar as butter.  If you like Hooter's sauce, then you'll want the vinegar.

This recipe was awsome! I had the name brand batter for the wings. Then I read to find out, I need their sauce also. After trying this recipe I will not buy the "name brand again". These were by far the best hot wings I have had, and I have ate a lot of hot wings. I have also tried several recipes.

This recipe is requested every Sunday for football usually I have to make two batches.  This only change I make is I bake the wings by the instructions on the back of the bag or 350 for 45 mins.  This is a great recipe, feel free to mix it up, I prefer Franks Hot Sauce but sometimes I change it up and use Chipotle Tibasco.

We love this! I cut up chicken breasts instead of using wings to make boneless buffalo style wings. This recipe is actually better than any we have had at a restaurant. For my younger children I stir their chicken in a barbecue and butter mixture.

I used some extremely hot sauce named " reaper" not a whole 1/4 cup but enough to make them have fire in them. excellent with a good bleu cheese to help tame the fire.

These were excellent, but I did make some changes just for the sake of saving time. I coated the wings in the flour and only let them sit for 20 minutes because of a time crunch, then I deep fried them for only 5 minutes, then I stuck them onto a cookie sheet and baked them because I prefer my wings baked. I baked them at 375 for about 40 minutes until they were done, coated them in sauce, and the turned the broiler on and stuck them in for about 5 minutes to give them added crunch. They were excellent and next time I will try sticking more closely to the recipe, but I will definitely make again!

I changed this recipe to make it veggie friendly. I mixed up the sauce (YUM, so good) and instead of chicken I used Morningstar Farms Chick'n Patties (4) cut into strips. I baked them until crispy, according to package directions, and then tossed them in the sauce. Served with celery and bleu cheese dressing.  Very tasty!

Ok, but I agree, not quite a buffalo wing. Franks Buffalo Wing Sauce was what I got, as they didn't have Franks Louisiana Hot Sauce at the store. Louisiana seems to be the key, not Franks, because I had no-name President's Choice Louisiana Hot Sauce in the fridge, and that had the right smell and taste. Will use that for all the wings next time.

Update: 5 stars if you use Louisiana Hot Sauce regular Frank's red hot. This recipe is awesome.

DH loved these. I cooked them in an airgrill rather than deep fried, but he never comlpained. Did as recipe suggested. Only added a few chili flakes to the hot sauce itself. Cooked them in the flour and added flour before cooking as well as a few sprays of oil. Cooked until 3/4 done...then coated in the sauce.....( leaving some to remain) and cooked them for a further 15 minutes. And poured the remaining sauce over chicken when it was done just before serving.

We love this recipe!  I was out of cayenne which is a sin in this house so I substituted Chipotle Chili Pepper seasoning.  I think I will add 1/2 teaspoon of the Chipotle next time because I like the smokie flavor it added.

These were good but would add more Franks sauce than butter.  Like on reviewer said 2/3 Franks and 1/3 butter.  Family still just likes plain ol salted and deepfried wings.

I made these wings and can I say they were amazing! My whole family loved them. These were supposed to be on the side of a lot of other BBQ food, but they were the hit of the day. There are about 20 people there and they ALL loved them. Five stars all they way. Thanks a lot for the recipe.

Wings came out tasty and cooked perfectly. Juicy and crispy... Needs to be hotter. I am not a big fan of too spicy but these could definately have used a bit more of a kick. Easy enough to fix. Over all good job.

WOW! These were so good! I added some extra garlic powder and onion powder to the flour mixture, and less cayenne pepper, and per amydoll's review baked on a rack over a jelly roll pan and the came out crispy and delicious. I crave these all the time now! I've also used chicken tenders cut in half with good results, I just had to remember to take them out of the oven earlier as they cook faster.

Really good chicken wings.  I made these the other night and the only change I made was to increase the butter and hot sauce to 1/3 cup because I made more than 10 wings (about 24 split chicken wings).  I also added about 2 Tbsp of honey to the sauce to give it a bit of sweetness; this was great because it cut through the heat really well.  I also did not add the cayenne pepper to the flour mixture and added seasoning salt instead.  I will definitely make these chicken wings again!

I almost had to beat everybody off of these things so I could have a couple (kidding!). Absolutely wonderful buffalo wings. Only problem was that my fryer is smaller, so had to make them in smaller batches. Will DEFINITELY make over and over again! A new, unbeatable favorite for my picky 11 yr old  :) Thanks for a great recipe!

These are great! My husband and I loved them. The only complaint was from my husbad who complained that the sauce was too thin. He is a tough critic...I had no proble with the sauce. We used Franks buffalo wing sauce. Next time I may add some cayenne to the sauce because I prefer really hot wings.

I made this for my family and they loved it!! Personally,  I think it's great. The type of hot sauce used is quite important. The hot sauce i used had a different taste, causing that odd taste to emerge in the wings. The next time i'll use conventional tobasco sauce and see what happens. Also, try doing the sauce just before you serve. If you make it to early, the sauce thickens a bit and mixing it with the wings could be difficult. Overall, excellent recipe! Thanx!

This is my first review..these wings are so good that I created an account just to write this review (I've been visiting this website for recipes for the past 4 years..that's how good they are) My husband loves the wings too.  I took the advice of one reviewer and deep fried the wings, poured the sauce over before baking them in the oven for 15 mins (350 degrees).  Will definitely make these again.

These fried up nicely. I breaded the night before the superbowl and let them sit in the fridge and then fried them up about 18 hrs later and they looked perfect. They were all gone very quckly and I had tripled the recipe and also had separated the wings in to drummetes as well.

Love these!!! I made these to enjoy with the Superbowl game and they were soooo good!!  I was surprised how easy they really were.  I used the chicken drummettes (instead of wings) and added a little more butter to the sauce and they were delicious, but next time I'll spice it up a little more (my husband prefers them on the hotter side!)  The only other thing I did add was I sprinkled the wings with "Chicken Seasoning" to add alittle more flavor to the chicken before adding them to the flour mixture to which I also added 1/4 tsp. Seasoning salt. I  put the flour mixture in a plastic bag and shook the chicken lightly in the bag; this coats the chicken more evenly and makes less mess than the bowl- then put the bag with the coated chicken in the refrigerator for about 80 minutes). Otherwise, I followed the directions and the flavor was fantastic. Thanks for a great recipe.

Yummy! Not the fastest thing to prepare but well worth the wait! I fried some and baked some. I liked the fried ones more, but the baked ones were good, too- and less clean up.

Now I see why it has gotten five out of five stars from over 500 reviewers. These wings were...dare I say AWESOME! I didn't understand why you had to refrigerate the wings for 60-90 min, until I took them out the fridge and fried them. They get all nice and gummy and form this extra crispy crust when fried. The sauce was neither too hot nor too spicy. I did use unsalted butter and omitted the salt that the recipe called for, but couldn't tell that it was missing due to the sodium of the hot sauce. Again, these were AWESOME, and definitely a  make again in my house!

THIS IS IT!!!!! I've tried lots of buffalo wing recipes, but this is it!! The best, the absolute best by far! A HUGE HIT and I will be making these again and again and again..Thanks for this recipe. I will add I refrigerated the wings for 2 hours before frying, otherwise I followed the recipe exactly and used Frank's hot sauce.

I baked them and used Franks' brand hot wing sauce as suggested by other reviews. The way it crisped up in the oven was amazing! I bought 25 wings and mini drumsticks (smart chicken brand) for just six dollars, so these are economical and delicious! bye,bye pizza hut wings!!

Just like the ones in the restaurant. I think next time I will add a little more heat. We like spicy at my house.

I tried these out tonight as a trial run for the super bowl party we are having and they are perfect - my husband wants to tweak the sauce (he likes them super HOT) I am just a plain old buffalo wing person and I found them to be perfect - our kids love wings but we will tweak a batch for them too (they are only 2 and 4 and like barbaque). Thanks so much for a great CX wing!!!

Oh my goodness!!! So good! My husband said we never had to buy wings again. I  made the sauce a little different. I did a spicy honey barbeque sauce because that is our favorite. Everything is the same except I only did an 1/8 cup of hot sauce and an added an 1/8 cup of barbeque sauce and about 2 tbs of honey. If that's your favorite flavor you have got to try this.

Wonderful wings. This is my new wing recipe from now on. I made 5lbs in the turkey fryer and served them during a football game with bleu cheese dressing, ranch dressing and celery sticks.  Yummm!

Thanks for the recipe!!! My family absolutely enjoyed it! I made some minor changes...I seasoned the chicken prior to covering the chicken in the seasoned flour.  I also added some honey to the sauce.  I served it with French fries and a green salad. My Husband told me this recipe has to be put into my dinner rotation.

This is an excellent recipe!  Everytime I make these they are gone in 30 min.  The sauce is good if it is followed correctly but I make it a little milder for my family's taste. Thanks for the great recipe!

I tried this recipe for the first time and it was the BEST ! The only thing I added was the buffalo wing sauce to the hot sauce mixture and it came out really tasty. Good Stuff, this will be the recipe i'll be using from now on.

The sauce was not quite right on these...it could have been my own fault because I used tabasco instead of hot sauce, though, so I gave it one extra star than I normally would. I will say that the wings fried up nice and crispy, and in my second batch I tossed the fried wings with some bbq sauce and they were awesome!

My husband and I are buffalo-wing fanatics. I've been making these wings for years now and they are far better than any wings we've ever had at any restaurant or wing joint.

We've been sharing this recipe with everyone.  We made it with baked wings (to cut down on fat) and found it was excellent.  When we were frying a turkey, we decided to try frying the wings.  To our deep surprise, we found we like the baked wings better.  Baking seems to carmelize the flour or something.  It was a definite surprise.  Still this is a keeper that will be used often.

Crispy and delicious! I found the sauce to be way too hot for my taste, so I added Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce until the heat was bearable for me!  Couldn't have been better.

YUMMY!! These were wonderful and super easy. I followed the recipe exactly except I made "buffalo bites" instead of wings. I cut up chicken breasts into chunks and fried those. They were great. My 9 yr old daughter fell in love with them. In fact, she ate twice what i ate! I used "FRANKS RED HOT" sauce which was great but next time i will use less butter so its a bit more spicy. I have a feeling i will be making these at least once a week :) Thank you for a great recipe!

This was great, although I did make a few changes. I seasoned the flour with 1/2 tbsp each of garlic powder, onion salt and Garlic salt (I know it sounds like a lot, but it made the wings taste fantastic even without the sauce)I also added about 1 tsp of cider vinegar to the sauce.

I made these exactly as the recipe calls for and my very picky husband like them. I don't eat meat so I can't say for myself. I didn't think he would like them to much because he usually doesn't like breading on his wings, but it's so light I thought I'd give it a try.  He thought they were great - and if he didn't he would tell me.  He doesn't hold back for anything:)

My husband flipped his wig for these wings. We usually buy a particular name brand of wings and according to him these were better!  I didn't deepfry them. I spryed them with bacel spray and baked them @ 425 for 25 mins. Way less fat and just as tasty.

The first day i made this for my boyfriend he ended up trying to eat my wings too. Now i have to like triple the recipe cause we just love it. one thing i tryed different was after the 90 mins in the frige were it gets sticky. i coated the wings with Shake'n Bake extra crispy  than fried them. if you love an extra crisp try this, it was the best.

I started using this recipe over 4 years ago. I can't tell you how many people I have had beg me for the recipe.  It is always the #1 request for potlucks, parties, any type of get together. I have never tried baking them, but I might do that next time. If you are looking for a buffalo wing recipe, this is it!!!!!!!!!! Oh, and be sure to only use Franks Hot sauce in this recipe, otherwise it doesn't come out as good.

Wow...Great tasting wings! Like other reviewers, I decided to cut the chicken wings in half and discard the tips.  I made one slight mistake by adding the black pepper and garlic powder to the flour mixture.  I don't think it made a difference.  I love these wings because they stay crispy even after they are coated with the sauce. Other recipes I have tried get soggy once the wings have been coated. I guess it really comes down to personal preference. I didn't have Frank's hot sauce, so I used Louisiana hot sauce from New Orleans.  Yum-O in the words of Rachel Ray. This recipe is a definite keeper!  Thanks, Kelly

These were very good- not too hot, but had just the right amount of spice.  I will use boneless chix breast next time- then I wont have to try to eat them off the bone, and my family can scarf them faster!

I live in Upstate New York and have had the Original Anchor Bar Buffalo Chicken wings.  I have one word for this receipe... EXCELLENT!  I have made this recipe numerous times.  I plan this week to grill the wings first instead of deep frying them.  The flour might cause the wings to stick to the grill surface but will give it a try..... or maybe not and just sprinkle the other seasonings on the wings.

This recipe is great if you're looking for buffalo wings "hence the title".  I was actually looking for a hot wings recipe.  Not a wings fan, I didn't know the difference.   I followed the recipe exactly using Frank's Buffalo wing sauce.  It is not spicy.  I guess you have to try other sauces to get the spicy taste.  My husband enjoyed it which I was aiming for.

These wings were good. I followed the recipe exactly and used Tabasco as my hot sauce, since that's all I've seen here (in Spain). I thought they were sort of a pain to make (the frying, I mean--I usually bake my wings) and found them a little hot for my taste, but my son, who is a connoisseur of buffalo wings, said he thought they were good. I'd give this recipe four and a half stars.

My brother loved the recipe so much that he entered it into a wing contest among his fighter wing, he's an Air Force pilot, and he won, unanimously. We had to put the fryer in storage because we were making them too frequently and gained weight! Thanks for the recipe!

These were wonderful...like the ones that you get at a resturant...I have made others that were good but not really like the orginal ones...easy and the sauce is just right..not so hot that you can't enjoy the wings but still have a kick!!

Great recipe!!!  My boyfriend absolutely loves Hooter's wings, and we wanted to try and find a recipe that was similar.  This one hit the spot!!!  He was so impressed, and thought they were so good that we've made them twice in the past week.  The only thing I tweeked the second time around was I added a little more hot sauce.  We will definitely be making these time and time again!!!  Thanks :)

I love it - very simple to make :)  My husband doesn't like wings, so I made it with chicken breast pieces.  I used corn starch instead of flour for a little different texture.  I will definitely make it again - thanks for sharing :)

Such a great recipe!  Thank you so much!  I made this for my family for the holiday, and they were gone in minutes!  As other members have suggested, I highly recommend using Frank's Red Hot (in original flavor), and also, I left the wings in the fridge for more than 90 minutes (more like a few hours) and they were absolutely delicious!  I will definitely be making these on a regular basis. :)

I made these wings tonight and they were to die for. I am horrible at frying and I cannot believe how beautiful these came out. So nice and crispy. They were better than a restaurant. They were a little too spicy so next time I will add more butter to the hotsauce. So very delicious and I followed the recipe exactly. No need to deviate from the original recipe.

Just tried these tonight - Even my hyper-critical 13 yr old RAVED! I made a small batch as I was unsure of the outcome (have tried other recipes that flopped) and what a mistake. To make up for it, I promised to make more this weekend. I agree w/ other reviewers - it's a must to refrigerate after the flour mixture - makes 'em crisp and keeps the flavor in every bite. Thanks so much for a super recipe!

Kelly Girl.....You've outdone yourself!  What a fantastic and simple recipie. The whole family enjoyed it immensely.  The "secret" is the 90 mins in the fridge. I actually left mine longer.  DO NOT SKIP THIS STEP...IT'S CRUCIAL. It'll be worth every minute that you waited. Trust me!  Thanks so much.

Wow!  I took these to a pot luck BBQ, we made them at our house and then transported them hot, they were a huge sucess.  We ended up cooking them twice because I worried about not cooking them for long enough.  The grease didn't need to be changed during the middle which I was afraid it would.  I mixed up the stuff and then left it all in the fridge over night, we cooked them and then some got the hot sauce and some were plain.  Everyone loved it.  I made it using "Rooster Sauce" for the hot sauce, I used 1/2 serving since it's soo spicy.  I highly recommend this for someone who doesn't mind deep frying and wants food that everyone will enjoy.

Very good recipe. I added a bit of extra hot sauce because the butter taste was too heavy for me. Will be using again.

These were great!  I didn't do the sauce just because we don't like our wings really hot and I wasn't sure how hot it was going to be, so I just bought some Sweet Baby Ray's and mixed the wings in that - Delicious!

This is the first recipe I used from this site, and is still the best. I love to play around with recipes and add my own special touches to them, but there definately is no need here. I even use the batter recipe to fry larger pieces of chicken or boneless skinless chicken breast pieces, it's so simple and perfect. The first time I made them, I made a large batch and brought it to a party, nobody would believe that I made them at home, they all seriously thought I brought take out, wich is a great compliment to the recipe, the only down side is that they were all gone before I could get any.

I guess I'm not saying anything that hasn't already been said... these are delicious, if you cut down on the butter and season up the flour. I added Black pepper, seasoning salt, a bit of Emeril's and a touch of brown sugar. Also doubled the garlic. Was out of Frank's hot sauce, so had to use Tapatio. Hot, hot, HOT! Served with Ranch and celery sticks to cool down the flavor of the hotness a bit. I fried mine, but next time I'll try baking them, just to see the difference.
Thanks so much, Kelly.

As good as, if not better, than what you get at the restaurant. I had pre-breaded chicken so I didn't need to mak emy own breading, so I just added a dash of cayenne pepper and paprika to the auce mix. FABULOUS.

YUM!!!  i'm giving it 4-stars ONLY because we actually did not use the sauce in this recipe.  We had a bottle of our favorite wing sauce we had wanted to use.  but the breading was perfect.  we cooked about 5 pieces at a time and found 10 minutes to be the perfect time for 5...coming out light golden and crisp!  Very good.

This is a great recipe and definitely a keeper!  I made these wings for a Christmas party this weekend and they were gone in a flash.  I agree the key to this recipe is putting the coated wings in the fridge for 60-90 minutes.  My husband has already asked me to make these again, just for him.

I didn't follow this whole recipe but rather put the paprika and cayenne pepper into my hot sauce mixture and just poured it over chicken tenders that were baked. To my suprise, it turned out great! I used a super spicy La Preferida hot sauce.

i don't have a deep fryer, and i think they would be better done in one.  the sauce wasn't as hot as i would have liked.  the next time i think i'll reduce the butter and increase the hot sauce, and/or try a different brand of hot sauce.

AMAZING.  Used grace brand jamacian hot sauce, and substituted chili powder for cayenne pepper.  Came out just amazing--flavourful and very nice and hot.  Can't say anything else but AMAZING.

Made these for a football game and they were great.  Not too spicy for my 13 year old but they did have a little kick.

I really liked the sauce, but the 'breading' didn't really stay on and would have liked the wings with a more crispier breading.

I make these a lot, and they are fantastic.  Like the previous poster, I use a 2:1 Frank's to butter ratio.  I also like to keep the frying time on the short side (10 min) and toss the finished wings in the oven for 10 minutes get the sauce to stick and penetrate well.

This will be the ONLY way I make wings from now on. I used to just fry them with no coating on them and then put the sauce on, but this coating stuff really makes a difference. Hubby is on a diet and he "ONLY" ate 9 of them....just couldn't help himself.  Seriously, they were great! LOL

Ab fab recipe!  Try "double-bunking" the wings - once into egg wash then into the flour then repeat.  Makes the coating much thicker.  I made about 25 wings for my husband who said he would only manage "a couple". 15 minutes the later he was wiping the plate clean!!

Finally, we found the perfect wing sauce recipe. My husband has tried a few times to perfect a sauce but no can do, until we found this recipe. I didn't use wings this time, I used chicken tenders, which I deep fried and put them in the sauce. My son kept asking for more and with football season around the corner, this recipe will be a frequent user. Thanks Kelly!! UPDATE, made wings tonight and baked them @ 375 1hr (drums & wingettes) on racks with jelly roll pans underneath lined with foil. Easy, easy clean up. The guys wanted them hot and twenty four wings didn't last long. No more frying for me, take the chance and bake them!!

The was a great recipe!!!!!. I used it today and my boyfriend couldn't stop eating. I followed the recipe as stated but for the chicken I added Lawry's Seasoning Salt, and tinsy bit more garlic, also for the hot sauce I used TExas Pete and Crystals. I didn't put flour in the fridge like it said( because of lack of time), but it seemed to turn out just fine.

These wings were wonderful.  A friend of mine emailed this recipe to me.  Having never made wings before, I'm glad I had her to instruct me on clipping the tips off and cutting the wings!!  These are a keeper!

Wow!  I am a huge wing fan, and these are great.  My wife won't eat chicken off of the bone, so we use boneless breasts cut into bite sized pieces for our wings.  Serve it up with blue cheese dressing for me and ranch for her, I may never leave the house again!

I followed the recipe exactly for prepping the wings (I used drummettes) and they came out just the way I wanted them - crispy on the outside, juicy on the inside.  I used Frank's Red Hot Buffalow Wing sauce instead of making the sauce according to the recipe.  I also used Sweet Baby Ray's Honey BBQ sauce on half the batch and they were awesome.

Never ever eat out for wings again - this recips is the best!!! We're completely addicted to it in our house, I can't believe how good it is. Instead of using wings we make chicken strips instead. Next time we're going to BBQ the chicken so that it's a little bit healthier. To make it spicier I simmer a hot pepper with the seeds until ready to serve.

This was such an awesome recipe! This was the first time I made buffalo chicken without using the store-bought sauce, and these came out way better!  My boyfriend and I, being from New Orleans, like much spicier things, so I doubled the amount of everything hot that I put in, and it came out perfect and very spicy.  Thanks so much!

I was weary about making these since I'm sort of a baby when it comes to spicy foods, and due to the fact I've never made chicken wings, BUT these were great and so easy and not too hot! I took them to a Superbowl party and they were devoured. My boyfriend even tried to take credit for making them (he fried the second half of the batch while I got ready, but that's it) since we were getting so many compliments on them.

Wow!!  This recipe is excellent!  I made it for the Chiefs football game this past Sunday and everyone loved them.  I served them up with the traditional blue cheese dressing (Ken's steakhouse brand).   YUM!  I will definitely be making them again very soon.  Thank you for sharing this delicious treat!

These was my first time trying to make one of my all-time favorite dishes, wings. I made them for Sunday Night Football, and everyone, including me, went crazy for them! Since we love tons of spice in our food, I put in a little more of the pepper than called for, but it overall tasted great! Thanks for the recipe, will definatly make again and again.

We served these at a Halloween party.  GREAT!  I used chicken tenders and cut each tender into three pieces.  I breaded and refrigerated as directed.  They fried beautifully.  We tossed half of them with the hot sauce mix and then made a bbq sauce/butter mix similarly.  Served with ranch and blue cheese and didn't have a single one left.  Thanks SO much - will be perfect for holidays and super bowl parties.

For a great tasting Fried Chicken Dish, I've used Step (2)on other chicken parts such as drumsticks & thighs & its PERFECT.. sometimes, I leave it overnight for extra flavour!

"In a small bowl mix together the flour, paprika, cayenne pepper and salt. Place chicken wings in a large nonporous glass dish or bowl and sprinkle flour mixture over them until they are evenly coated. Cover dish or bowl and refrigerate for 60 to 90 minutes."

I made these as tenders instead of wings and only had to fry them for about 7 minutes. My husband and I thought they were excellent!  I'll definitely be making this again.

Mmmm good!  Made this recipe using chicken legs and cooking it on the grill.
First I boiled the chicken legs in water for about 15 mins to cook them through, then I dried them off with paper towels and put the dry ingred. on them.  After an hour in the fridge, I put them on the grill until they were done and put the hot sauce on them in a bowl.
Great flavor!  Will make again.

Excellent sauce!!  My husband knows his wings, and he said this sauce was dead on.  So easy to make too!  I only used the sauce from this recipe, brushing it on cooked bs breasts for buffalo chicken sandwiches.  He wants to try making the whole recipe next!

This was a hit....it was gone in minutes.  My husband, who doesn't really care for chicken, ate majority of the wings and wanted more.  The only changes I made was I tripled the recipe and added a little more hot sauce and some vinegar (for that extra kick).  I also marinated the chicken overnight (which seem to give the meat a lot more flavor).  I would definitely make this again.

I have tried this recipe twice and the first time, the wings were way to soggy and not quite as hot as we like them. Here are my suggestions...Completely omit the flour mixture. Use more hot sauce ( I prefer Franks) and less butter. Place the wings in the oil and deep fry for 25 minutes. Remove them from the oil and place on a plate covered with paper towels. Then coat them in the hot sauce mixture. The wings came out crispy and spicy (but not uncomfortably spicy).

I made this with boneless chicken breast cut into strips and it was great.  Didn't have cayenne so I used Morton's Hot Salt as the substitute for salt and cayenne.

This was a hit at the party we took it to last night!  
I sliced boneless chicken for 2/3 of the batch, leaving 1/3 of the batch as wings to appease the traditionalists.  Next time I will incorporate garlic powder into the flour mixture, as well as more spice.
I will never bake chicken wings again!

I thought the wings we had been making were great, but if they were a five these are a 10!!!!  I upped the spices and hot sauce a little bit & added 1/2 tsp. of vinegar to the sauce.  Patted the wings dry before flouring and then refrigerated for an hour.  Even after they sat for a while they were still crunchy, which is a good thing!

The sauce in this recipe is excellent.  However, the recipe for the chicken I changed.  I mix 1/4 cup red wine vingar with 1 tsp sugar, 4 1/2 tbl Real Lemon Juice, 1/2 tsp basil.  Used a pastry brush to apply to the chicken then seasoned with McCorm. Chicken.  Bake on 425 for about 45 minutes.  Excellent with the sauce from the recipe.

These wings are awesome!  I used Texas Pete hot sauce and it was a little too hot for our taste so I added about two tablespoons of honey while the sauce was still in the pot and that worked out great.  Kept the kick but toned down some of the fire.  Thanks for the recipe!!

These were the best homemade wings! The best part was that they really did taste like wings from a restaurant. I used the Frank's hot sauce as suggested and loved it. They were a little spicy but not too hot for kids. Next time I will try adding a little less butter to some of the sauce to see if I can make it hotter.

I thought these wings were excellent!! I used extra virgin olive oil and just enough to coat the bottom of the frying pan and it worked great!  I also used wings and also chicken strips mixed and both were fantastic.  A little ranch dressing on the side and I was having a perfect meal!  I will make again! Thanks!

MmMmm.. I've cooked chicken wings in many ways but this one turned out to be one of the best. My husband was munching on them even before it was mixed with the sauce. I had to chase him out of the kitchen! `LoL` And if it's that GOOD before it is even complete then for me..this recipe is surely a keeper!

the texture was great but the flavour was off.   Tasted too much like butter.   I will definately make again, but with less butter next time
edit: made again.  used a quarter cup of butter and a full cup of franks red hot  for 25 wings and it was perfect

These are hands down the best wings I've ever had. This is my go to wing recipe, they stay crispy even after coated in the buffalo sauce. The key is the 90 minute refrigeration after you coat in the flour mixture. You can't skip or rush that part although I have done it for 60 minutes with good results.

Instead of using garlic powder salt and pepper separately I use 1/2 tsp of a mix I make. I use 1/2 tsp in the flour mix and another 1/2 tsp in the sauce. I also add 1/8 cup ketchup to sauce mixture. Family loves it, even me and I'm super picky when it comes any type of hot sauce! Delicious!

I have made it a quest to find the best hot wings in the Atlanta area.  Over the past year I have been looking for a hot wing recipe out there.  I have tried several but this one was the best by far.  I have made them twice and my guests were not disappointed.  For me I like them cooked at exactly 11 min and leave the coated wings in the fridge for 90 minutes.  If you do that you will get some GREAT crispy wings.  Also I prefer Texas Pete hot sauce over Tabasco.  Texas Pete is thicker and hangs on the wings better.  To keep grease in check I always remove the chicken from the frying oil and place them on a napkin to drain for a couple of minutes before putting them in the hot sauce mixture.  Then I only leave the wings in the hot sauce mixture for a couple of minutes then remove them  and put them on a plate and serve.  One little secret that I will give you that takes the hot sauce up a notch but don't tell.  Add about 1/4 cup (to taste) of Sriracha Sauce to the hot sauce mixture.  Good luck

Buffalo Wings are not breaded!!!!  These are breaded hot wings.  Correct portion is 3 parts Frank's, to one part butter, with a touch of garlic.    Drain well before coating.  Don't drown the wings, you are only coating them.  And please, don't use Hooter's as your guide.

I took the advice of another reviewer and did these in the oven for 50 min @ 350 on a wire rack on a rimmed baking sheet, took them out and sprayed them with olive oil cooking spray.  The spray actually crisped the skin as it was applied.  Back in the oven for 10 minutes @ 375.  I took them out, brushed on the buffalo sauce and back in the oven for 5 minutes.  They were great!  Maybe not as crunchy as if they were fried, but they were crispy.

Awesome Recipe! I added a little more garlic (couldn't help myself). Make a huge batch usually 2 or 3 times a year...never any leftovers.

I am a bit of a wuss so I'll admit I didn't make this recipe for the intent of making them buffalo style wings. But rather I use this recipe for the method of getting super juicy, super flavorful, super crispy wings!!! So that is to say, I follow the exact recipe up until the Buffalo sauce Just because I can't handle heat and just eat it with a milder sauce instead. I believe the key to this recipe is definitely letting the wings sit and dry out in the fridge with the flour dredge on them!! It really does make a world of difference! I've made them up in the morning and let them sit all day and they're just super crispy and juicy and flavorful! I will never use another method ever again!! Definitely worth a try!!!

This is a simple yet effective buffalo style wing recipe, I use the word simple with a good measure of complement. It proved tasty and not awfully hot, with good flavour, and nice texture. Baking at 390 for 45-50 min. also provides a healthier alternative. Would recommend it and will make it again I'm sure.

To the flour mixture i added 1/4 tsp garlic powder, 1/4 tsp onion powder, and 1/4 tsp black pepper. I cooked them in the oven under the broiler for 15 to 20 min turning half way and basted them with butter. I made a sweet and sour bbq sauce (I don't do hot at all). These wings are so good.

It was yummy… my kids loved it! It was easy and just what I was looking for. The only thing I did differently was use to fry them till they were almost ready then cover them in the sauce and bake them on a cookie sheet till they were done. This helped set the sauce on them… which I basted them with a few times during baking.

Excellent!
The time in the refrigerator makes the difference.
Crispy, juicy.  
I love Frank's RedHot Original
I won't buy buffalo wings again.

These were amazing! My husband and I arent huge spicy fans so I did 1/2 hot sauce and 1/2 Liquid Smoke BBQ sauce. I did bake them at 350 for 45min instead of fry. After baked for 45min, I coated each wing with melted butter to crisp them up! They were amazing! Best wings Ive ever had!

Out of this world. Followed recipe (hard for me to do) and we loved them. Made them for Super Bowl and tonight making them but with strips of chicken breast. Thanks for the recipe. Have a feeling the breasts won't be as good as the wings. Super simple too!

I don't care if these are "authentic" buffalo wings or not. They're delicious. I never made them before from scratch and these were so easy and soooo good. I deep fried them this time but will try the oven next time. LOVED THEM!

This recipe deserves all five stars! These were the best "Homemade" wings I have ever had even though I was a little short on the sauce. I followed other reviewers advice and kept them in the fridge the whole 90 minutes. I do recommend rolling each one in the "batter" individually to get a nice through even coating, at first I tried sprinkling it over top like the recipe says but you don't get the entire wing coated. The only change I made was to use minced garlic vs the powder. This one is a keeper.

It may very well be a good recipe, however,true Buffalo wings do not have a breading or a coating...the Buffalo part is all about the sauce!!! Give me a crispy wing with a great Buffalo sauce made with Frank's Red Hot and make it a hearty wing,none of these tiny things!!!! Let me make you some real wings!!!

Flipping Awesamazing ! Hubby and his family don't usually go for hot sauces but this is perfect for them. They love when I make these. I also buy a creamy salad dressing for them to dip their wings in and take the edge off.

I have used this receipe for a while now and LOVE it! I've tried others but this is the best hands down. The only thing I change is adding a little more heat to the sauce by adding chilli and cayenne powder.

Oh my goodness...... YuMMo! I am addicted. I'm not usually a big fan of Buffalo Wings but these are delicious. I use more butter and less hot sauce than the recipe recommends as I do not want it too spicy. The first three times I made them, I baked the wings in the oven and they were delicious but I'm afraid frying them made them even more yum and crispy. I have made this recipe enough now that I don't need the recipe. Do yourself a favor and try this recipe.

11/14: very good, make again but spicier this time.  add more cayenne, and more hot sauce.  this time i halved the hot sauce and butter mixture to 1/8 cup each because that's all the franks hot sauce i had.  the amount was fine though, i brushed it on.  maybe if i poured it on like they said it would have bee better.

Made the wings as directed, they came out nice and crispy.  For the sauce I used 1/3 cup franks redhot, 1/3 cup vinegar,  1/4 cup butter, 1/4 cub brown sugar and 3 tbsp molasses, and a bit of cornstarch mixed with cold water to thicken the sauce a bit.  The molasses and sugar cut the hot of the pepper sauce a bit, but leave enough zing to make the saice finger lickin good!

Wonderful! I'm from Memphis so I know what good food should taste like. deep fry them in some peanut oil and be sure to let the flour sit on the chicken for atleast an hour. Otherwise the flour won't stick :)

2000+ reviews and 5 stars?  Must be a reason.  So let me tell you the reason.  It's that I never thought I could make fried wings this good.  Lordie.  I put about 1 inch of oil in a 14 inch cast iron skillet and used a heavy, high quality, metal spatter cover for this recipe...next time I might use the dutch oven. I bought 3 dozen wings already so I can freeze em and eventually make a bunch of these wings again--i didn't know the pack i used had only 6 wings. So anyway, these came out fantastic.  Yes the secret seems to be letting them rest and getting the coating a bit gummy before you fry them. After frying, I let them rest on my metal broiler rack/oven sheet combo from my toaster oven. I didn't use the sauce in the recipe, I just slapped on what we had out of the bottle...Frank's, Sweet Baby Ray's, and Tropical Pepper co. habanero/mango/coconut sauce.  They were not the least bit oily or greasy.  Fried doesn't have to equal bad, but badly fried food, now that is in fact, bad.  I'd love to make these regularly.

I made these last night. I actually doubled the recipe because I made over 40 wings.  Followed the directions exactly, making sure to refrigerate the wings.  I believe this is the secret for that perfect "crunch".  I will defiantly make these again. Thanks

I followed the recipe except for frying. I coated the wings in the flour mixture and laid them on baking sheets in the fridge for an hour. "Oven fried" them until they were crispy. I was so surprised It came out so crispy doing it this way and will forever do it this way. Even after tossing them in sauce, they stayed crispy.

These aren't "authentic" Buffalo wings. Nonetheless, they are fabulous! Made these last year for the Super Bowl, and will be making them again this year. I made them exactly as the recipe states, to a T. The only thing I will change from here forward is cut back on the butter in the sauce. I would make the sauce-to-butter ratio 1/2 cup hot sauce to 1/3 cup butter. Use Frank's Red Hot for the sauce and you'll have the perfect wings.

Great recipe base for some yummy chicken wings.  I used half flour & half panko crumbs.  Added Adobo seasoning, and onion powder for the coating and follow the recipe as shown.  I used the sauce for dipping because the coating was so good it didn't need it really.  Oh my--what finger licking deliciousness!! Thank you Kelly for sharing.  Too bad I didn't share but maybe next time.

These wings came out perfect and I made several batches over two days leading up to the Superbowl for hungry teenagers.  I purchased high quality bare wings at the butcher and followed the recipe exactly. After taking out from the refrigerator after the 90 minutes, I tossed them around in the flour to recoat. I fried them for 12 minutes in oil at 375 degrees.  Then placed them in a deep dish and tossed with the sauce that was still very warm. 
Also, some that I made the day before, I reheated in the oven for a half hour at 350 degrees and they were great.

Wonderful hot wings! I made them with Mexican hot sauce, which was all I had, and added a bit of brown sugar for that "sweet and spicy" effect. Perfect! I left them in the refrigerator the full 90 minutes and they were so crispy even after adding the sauce. I did not soak them in the sauce, just drizzled enough to coat, and put the remaining sauce in a side serving dish for whom ever wanted more. Also, I did not have wings so I used drumsticks and they were still awesome. You really can't improve on perfect. This one is going in my recipe box for sure.

I love this recipe! Everyone I've made it for has loved it and wants to know how I make it. I use red hot sauce and I use less butter then it calls for. I also like spicy food so I double the cayenne pepper. But other then that, I think this recipe is perfect :)

I just made these tonight and they are deeee-lish!!! I get so tired of hearing about so-called authentic buffalo wings. Authentic isn't necessarily the best. I've prepared and eaten wings just about every way imaginable and these are by far the best wings I've ever had. If you want them hotter just kick the sauce up a notch and you're good to go! I think the key to any good wing is the quality of the wing itself. Has to be plump and meaty. Great, simple recipe!! It's my new go-to. -Arnie1

The butter/hot sauce ratio is way off and the floured wings didn't work.

Didn't have time to let it sit in the fridge.  I am sure that's why I am only giving it 4 stars... it could have been much better if only I would have had the time to make it according to the directions.  The flavor was really good but the flour didn't have time to stick to the chicken properly.  I will try this again and just mix it all in a large bag and make sure to let them go to the fridge first, next time.

very good as written. Wishing I would have put a little more seasoning in the flour mixture. I think next time I will do 2 parts hot sauce to 1 part butter. Not quite hot enough. Used Franks hot sauce. I may try baking it next time too.

Breading is bland and the ratio of butter to hot sauce is way off. It's like a heart attack waiting to happen, it was that greasy! There was no flavor to these wings at all. I tried them both fried and baked. I followed recipe exactly and they were terrible. I even used Frank's RedHot sauce as suggested. Don't bother with these, spend your money wisely and go to a restaurant and buy wings!

Followed recipe and added the vinegar as suggested by others.  Made two batches one with the vinegar and one without and it doesn't make a huge difference but would have to say I like it better with.  Also, fried 2nd batch about 5 mins longer to make them extra crispy which we loved.

A nice sauce alternative uses no butter....use franks red hot, grape jelly to make it stick (no joke, cheap grape jelly!)and tabasco to adjust the heat.

As written, this recipe is awesome.  Although I do not care for hot wing sauce, I just used my favorite BBQ sauce instead.  I have tried both frying them and baking.  Obviously, frying is going to give a crispier texture that you expect from wings.  Baking them works, but is not even close.  I tried the whole spraying them with cooking spray, putting them on a rack up off the baking sheet, and they were just, meh.  If you're contemplating frying vs. baking, follow the recipe, and fry them!

*Disclaimer:  I used my own sauce (honey mustard dressing and teriyaki) so my review is based solely on the method of cooking the wings.  They were fantastic!  Crispy and delicious and JUST like a local place here where they have the best wings.  These tasted just as good and they were so easy to make!  I will always make my wings like this from now on.  Thank you!

Excellent chicken wing recipe.  The key is putting lots of sauce on the wings because they do soak up the sauce.  I would definitely make these again and I would use other sauces and flavours such as salt & pepper, barbeque, etc.

Turned out great.  The sauce had just the right kick to it - I doubled the recipe.  I used wingettes.  Next time I will try with chicken breast strips.  I also used a deep fryer.

Awesome!!!! I dont like spicy food so I used a store bought honey garlic sauce instead. These came out crispy, soft and juicy. They didnt make it to the table, we just stood around in the kitchen and ate them.

So easy and really good! You could probably try other flavor creations too. Next time, I will do what another suggested and let the wings sit for a bit before tossing into the mixture.

Freaking delicious! I did tweak the recipe a bit. I used Franks Buffalo Hot sauce on the wings and threw them in the oven for a bit to bake them and let the sauce bake in. I also did some BBQ wings as well. Thanks so much for this recipe! I love being able to adjust these amazing recipes into my own. This one is a keeper in my book.

I made these wings in an infrared convection oven (60 minutes at 375 degrees F.) and they were sublime. I sprayed them with cooking spray, and then drizzled the barest amount of canola oil over them to get that crunchy goodness. I turned them over half way during cooking time. Wonderful recipe, thank you!

Baked and breadcrumbs.  I done this recipe but I baked and breadcrumbs.  Cooked in the oven at 200c for 30 mins.  Used chicken breast fillets also.  Worked out amazing.  Sprayed the chicken with sunflower oil.  So actually much healthier as very little oil was used.  Will deffo make again.

We loved this recipe!  My husband isn't too fond of "buffalo" style wings, so we improvised a little to give these more of a honey-barbecue flavor.  I added about 2 TBS of honey and 1/4 cup of brown sugar.  These were great!  We will definitely make these again and again!  We love the sauce!

amazing. I used crystal hot sauce and smoked paprika, I didn't add the cayenne because thats what the hot sauce is made out of. I let the wings sit on paper towels to absorb excess grease, this allows them to absorb the sauce better and not get soggy.

My husband loves these wings and doesn't want me to buy store brand or restaurant wings again.  I add a little bit more cayenne and garlic powder to the flour mixture and after refrigerating and before they go into the oven or fryer I coat them again in the leftover flour.  This makes them SO crispy.  My nieces and nephews (7-13) loved these too (with Ranch).  It's a great copy cat recipe!

made this for the first time for Super Bowl Sunday, they were an instant hit! It is essential that you let these refridgerate for a long time, if not the flour will slide off the wings when deep frying. I used chicken tenders for the kids and bone-in wings for the adults, both worked perfectly!

I have made this wing recipe several times and our family loves it!  I have a hard time getting wings from anyplace now because I think these are better!  Refrigerating the wings is crucial to the POW flavor.  Thanks for sharing this with us.

Made them for the Superbowl! Everyone loved them and couldn't stop raving about them. I also baked them at 375 for 45 minutes and sprayed with cooking spray the last five minutes.

YUMMY! These turned out perfectly. We had them for our superbowl party and they were a hit. The sauce as written is quite mild. If you want a spicier wing just add more hot sauce! A+ recipe!

I made them exactly as the recipe said.  I make chicken wings all of the time in various ways but I have to say, My 17 year old and I thought these were the best wings we have ever eaten.  Nice and crunchy and very taste.  This will be my main recipe for wings from now on.

Excellent!  I used smoked paprika in the breading, which gave a great flavor.  I also used about a 4:1 ratio of Frank's Red Hot to butter, since I like my wings hot!  They were perfectly spicy!  I baked them ~55 min at 375, turning halfway through.  Since I had breaded them while they were still frozen, they didn't crisp up, but they still tasted great.

Best wings I have ever had!  I stuck to the recipe EXACTLY, and rested them in the fridge for 1 hour (hard to do as I was anxious and hungry), and used Franks Red Hot and butter of equal amounts.  After tossing in the hot sauce, the wings remained crispy with perfect heat.  I will never buy wings for home again.

These really are delcious. Just like wings from a restaurant. Now If I'm really craving them I can just make them at home. I've made them twice now. The first time I just made wings, and the second time I cut Chicken tenders and cut them into peices, so they were like little chicken bites, and delicious. The first time I made a little to many, so I froze them, and today I'm going to put them in the oven and see how they come out. Great Recipie!

These were by far the best I've had!  I made a double batch, flouring them in a plastic baggie for 80 minutes.  Then sprayed with oil, baked at 375 for 25 minutes, flip chicken and pans, bake another 25 minutes, then drizzle with some hot sauce and broil for 3 minutes.  Turned out moist on inside, crunchy on outside.  Tossed with sauce.  Regretfully they went straight hot from oven and covered in sauce into a tupperware for the car ride to superbowl party so they got a little mushy from the steam.  But still the best!!  So many great compliments.  Thanks a bunch for the recipe!!  WHO DAT SAY DEY GONNA BEAT DEM SAINTS!

Oh My GOD!!!! This was excellent!!! It was GREAT! Terrific recipe. I followed it exactly, except I didnt put paprika in the flour mix because I didnt have any. I kept them in the fridge for about 70-80 minutes and then fried them. There is so many possibilities on how to eat them. You can try many sauces with the wings. You can even eat it without any sauce. It tasted great sauceless. Thats a rare thing for me.  Thank you for a great recipe. This will be my wings recipe from now on!

Don't hate this review. But I followed this procedure with boca burgers instead of chicken wings and baked it. All at home liked it.

only complaint is that frank's hot sauce wasn't hot enough for my liking. will definitely try a few drops of dave's insanity sauce or something like it the next time. my bf kept saying how good these wings were the day after!

Made this tonight for dinner and it was DEEELISH! Followed it to the T. Fridge for 90 min. and all. Used Franks Hot sauce for wing sauce mixture. Left some wings "naked" to see how they taste and was please by the flavor too. Might add a bit more sal but I like salt w/ chicken. This will be a Super Bowl selection at our party!

This is a great recipe. I have tried several different wing recipes. Baked, panfried and deep fried. Deep fried is where it is at for wings. Frank's Hot Sauce is our favorite. Made this a dozen times or more and each time it is a hit.

Wow!! These taste fantastic. First time I made wings and they made the guys speechless. They kept saying how good it was. :) Score! I didnt have time to fridge for an hour because the guys were watching a game and HUNGRY! I put them in the freezer for 10 minutes and I'm sure this wasn't better than the 60-90 minutes but the batter stayed on and they were crispy. I will try baking them to make them a TAD healthier. I dbled the recipe for 20+ wings and used extra hot sauce because we like it spicy. I will make these for parties from now on just for the compliments I'll get.

OK, this is the one.  I have deleted all other recipes for buffalo wings.  Hubby has not stopped raving about them since New Years eve.  Thanks so much.  I followed the recipe did not change a thing except for putting flour mixture in a plastic bag and adding the wings to coat.  Great recipe.

I'd give this one 6 stars if I could.  Thanks so much for the suggestion of baking them.  I added a bit extra cayenne pepper to the flour, along with some onion powder and garlic powder for more flavour.  When they were finished baking I thought they looked like they weren't crispy enough so I broiled them for a couple of minutes -and that made all the difference.  They came out beyond my expectations and none of us missed the deep-frying at all!  Next time, when they're finished baking, I'm going to put them on the George Foreman grill for a couple of minutes to see if they grill up nicely.

Giving this 4 stars because there was a little too much breading for us.  Next time I will cut back on the flour.  But the sauce was delicious!  I used Franks Original Hot Sauce.

Too spicy. I used tabasco sauce, because this recipe doesn't tell you what kind of hotsause to use.  but other than that they did taste last resturant wings..... I tried it again with franks buffalo hot sauce.....did not melt with butter, just dip the chicken in the hot sauce one by one.... much better, now i can go from 2 stars to 5 stars.

I am not a fan of chicken wings, but I enjoyed everything from the coating to the sauce! The key is allowing the wings to rest with the flour on them for a minimum of an hour. I took the wings out of the fridge about 15 minutes prior to frying so the wings would not bring down the temperature of the oil too much. These are the perfect snack to serve during football season! I will definitely make these again!

FANTASTIC! I usually make mine similar to this except I've never used flour. I will use flour from now on- it made a delicious crispy coating on the wings and we loved it! I made half buffalo style and half parmesan butter garlic. This will be the way I make wings from here on out! Thanks for posting. :)

Made recipe to the T, unlike some other reviewers. Awesome! I used drums and wings. Not too much breading but just enough for a good crunch. So so easy to make too. You can even cut out the flour step and fry the wings right up. Great!

OMG!!! These are the best hot wings I've ever made. I really tried the wings because griller3 had commented three times on this recipe. And you were right. They came out crispy the way I like them and the sauce wasn't so hot that you couldn't enjoy them and it wasn't so mild that you would think that you were eating plain wings. Because of this recipe wings are now a staple in my home. The Bates family give this recipe ********** (10)stars. Thanks Kelly.

Yumm-o!! These were so good. We followed the recipe as it reads. We did fry them and they turned out perfect, not greasy at all.Having the wings rest in the fridge is important! When we made the sauce we cut back on the butter(we actually used margarine)and used more hot sauce(Franks Red Hot)also added a couple of big shots of Tabasco b/c we like em a little hotter, and  what can I say these were right on! We will be making this our new and only HOT WINGS recipe. Also, we like variety so we made teriyaki wings and these were good too. I don't care what kind of sauce you use this is how wings should be. Thanks for sharing!!! PS. I have never eaten the wings at this restaurant and now I don't have too!

Best home cooked chicken wings I have tried. Baking in the oven made them nice and crispy, will make again.

I'm not the hugest dark meat fan, so I used chicken tenderloins instead.  Cooking time did reduce significantly but all the better!  I can understand why people love this recipe!  I did spice it up a little more, my husband loves to sweat while eating his hot wings (oh boy) LoL.

I'd probably be much fatter if I had found this recipe earlier - these wings are soo easy to make and taste perfect.  Just follow these instructions and you'll have the perfect meal to go along with Sunday Night Football!

I love this recipe!!  We like really hot wings so we cut the ratio of butter to hot sauce 1 to 4.  I use Frank's Hot Sauce.  Also, I use the Chicken  Fried Chicken recipe on AllRecipes submitted by CASSJW for the breading.  It stays on the chicken the best.  After reading over reviews, I do the flour, egg, then breading technique for coating the chicken.

DEEE-licious!  My family loves these and now my husband vows that we'll never go out for wings again.  Great recipe, but now I'm doomed to making endless batches of them over and over and over rather than taking the "easy" way out....but worth it! :)

Excellent recipe, which I doubled! I will probably use less butter next time- hubby could actually smell the butter on the finished product...but he was not complaining about the taste. He ate 14 of them! Obviously we will be having again soon. Delectable!

AMAZING!  I too baked these wings, and doubled the sauce.  I put the wings in the fridge for the hour recommended, and they were yummy!!  (Not sure if this is needed if you aren't frying them though.) Before baking, I sprayed with cooking spray..not sure if it was needed, but they turned out well.

The key to this recipe is dredging the wings and letting them refrigerate. Do not skip this step. It makes a great fried wing - coat them in whatever!! I guarantee they will turn out perfect! These are always a crowd pleaser - and way cheaper than ordering them for game day!!!

I trippled the ingredients and this was perfect! The wings were so crunchy and it wasn't too spicy at all. I will definetely make them again. Leaving theminthe fridge was the trick.

My husband's favorite food is wings and I thought I'd try these instead of spending a fortune going out all the time. I was worried he would be disappointed, being such a wing connoisseur, but he loved them! I have made them 3 times so far and they're great each time. Very crispy and flavorful.

My husband says he'll never eat wings out ever again. Hands down, the best wings we've ever had. I can't count how many times I've made these wings for company with homemade pizza. friends who don't normally eat wings, can't stop eating them.

I have always received compliments from these wings.  I follow the recipe exactly, and using my wok, deep fry them in peanut oil.  I then put them in a covered pot with Thai Sweet and Spicy Sauce, shake, then serve.

Goodness these were soooo good and they did in fact taste just like they're from a restaurant, but they are so bad for you.  My advice for those that are hesitant to make these because of the frying is to bake them or grill them instead.  They're good either way with the base of this recipe.  No changes needed; this recipe was good as is.  This is a great party pleaser, but my husband and I shared them between the two of us with onion rings and celery with ranch dressing.  So good!

My family loves this recipe! I use skinless, boneless chicken breast meat instead. I also serve the sauce separate so my kids can enjoy their homemade chicken fingers! This is our Sunday football fav!

baked at 375 degrees for 20min on each side. poured on 1/2 the sauce for 5min each side. not sure if the butter is necessary since after i was done baking, all the melted butter collected on one side of the pan. i think next time i'll try to play around and omit it all together or just use olive oil. def tailor to your own taste. my hot sauce was too spicy for MIL to eat and i ended up adding some honey to cut down on the heat. overall a great recipe for buffalo wings!

Yep.  This one's definetly a keeper.  I followed the directions as listed, BUT (you know there's gotta be a but....) I added some brown sugar to the butter, hot sauce mix.  So yum, spicy with a sweet undertone.  These things rocked!

I don't particularly like spicy food, but I made these for my husband who rated them as a five.  I lightly boiled the chicken first.  Will make again and perhaps bake as others have suggested.

I do the flour-coating thing in a zip-lock bag -- much easier.   And I absolutely LOVE SPICY SPICY SPICY!  But it's too much work, and to messy trying to get an ounce of meat off a wing.  Use drumsticks instead.  It's much more rewarding.  My fryer only cooks four at a time, so I put the finished ones in my 200 degree oven (which crisps it up nicely, I might add) until the rest of the drumsticks are done.  Thank you for the recipe.  I'll never order chicken wings at my local bar again.  Now I can make them better.

Okay, this is my first review ever on this website, have used recipes from here times before, but this was the first one I would say I HAD to write a review.  I am a chicken wing fanatic, I never made them homemade before, but have eaten from every restaurant imaginable.  I can say without a doubt these are the best tasting wings I have ever had.  I made them last night in honor of March Madness to just snack on.  I purchased pre-made wings & drumettes, so the pre-made ones could be ready when my husband got home, and let the recipe wingetts set in the flour in the fridge, and he preferred the recipe ones over the pre-made ones.  My 6 & 7 year old boys couldn't get enough, even took some outside to their friends.  The store brought ones, just sat there lonely.  I had to eat those, since these were all gone.  My husband just called and said I have to make more tonight.  Didn't change the recipe at all, followed recipe to a T, and came out perfect!

I thought these were kinda boring. I was thinking they would be more like TGIF or Chilis but they tasted like hooters. I also prefer my wings grilled rather than fried.

We are only a 1 1/2 drive from Buffalo NY. But these wings are better then any we have gone out for. I made these and took them to a block party last year, and everyone was raving about them and asking for the recipe. It is a bit of prep work, but well worth it. I do make a change for the sauce though.I don't use hot sauce, but buy a bottle of "Original Anchor Bar Buffalo Wing Sauce". Heartburn but sooooo goooood! LOL!

I tweaked this recipe a little bit. I fried my chicken wings without the flour and when they were done, I tossed them in the sauce. It turned out good but next time I will not use as much butter for the sauce because it took away from the "heat" that we love.

I have made this twice now and everyone loves it.  I used a combo of chicken wings and chicken breast strips and baked it like other reviewers suggested.  The only modifications that I made was add garlic powder and black pepper to the flour mixture and used an entire bottle of buffalo hot sauce to one stick of butter and threw in a few dashes of tobasco sauce.  I also let my chicken sit a lot longer than the recipe says.  I got up early and coated the chicken and left it in the fridge for several hours it seemed to make the coating stick really well and made them very crispy in the oven.  Thanks for the recipe, this was a big hit at our super bowl party.

I had never made buffalo wings before and spent a lot of time reading others reviews on here before I made these!  They were AWESOME! Tasted totally like Chili's or any other place like that. I did let them sit for a couple hours with the flour coating on them before I made them. I was torn about frying vs. baking but I decided to go ahead and use canola oil and fry them. At first, I didn't have the oil hot enough but quickly realized this and they did end up taking an hour but was worth it.  The only thing I would say is the sauce is more "buttery" and it's not flaming hot like some people like. I would use less butter and then more hot sauce. I used Franks Hot Buffalo Wing flavored.  I really didn't think they would turn out so good but our guests said they taste exactly like you would eat in a restaurant so I suppose that is why they are called "Restaurant-Style" wings!

I made these for a Super Bowl party and they were gone in minutes. Everyone loved them. I used Texas Pete's hot sauce with melted butter and the flavor was wonderful. I baked the wings instead of frying and I thought they were just as good or better than any we could've gotten from a restaurant. This recipe is a keeper!

I had to really cut down on the cayenne pepper due to the fact we had children with sensitive palates who were going to be eating it. However, I thought this was pretty bland otherwise. It had no other flavor and I even added garlic to the breading. The dipping sauce is what makes this recipe. Without it, it is just plain old bland fried chicken. It's not great but, it's not bad either.

These didn't taste like any restaurant I have have ever had, but they are VERY good! My husband asked me to make them again for the Super Bowl instead of ordering them out. That was an awesome request!

I Loved this recipe! It was great! I used boneless skinless chicken instead, because i didn't have any wings. I cut then up into bite sized sqares, and i put them in the refrigerator over night(because it was late). I took them out in the early afternoon and finished them. My husband and I LOVED them! WOW great recipe! Thanks!

This recipe is amazing.  I make this everytime we have parties.  We also  bring this to potlucks and it is always the first thing to go.  I add more cajun seasoning because we like the spice.  I recommend making this.  Everyone always asks for the recipe, but I never tell my secret (I got it off the internet)!!

Great recipie. Since the measurement of the butter and hotsauce were the same, I decided to taste before adding it to the chicken.  I found it to have been too spicy for my taste, so I took off half the mixture and added ketchup and some onions and bell peppers.  That was delicious.  Will certainly try it out for company this time.  Thanks

This is a fabulous recipe.  Best wings I've had anywhere . . . . I love the way you can play with the sauce - Chipotle Tobasco - Szechuan - Frank's - yumm! One secret - I add a bit of Mott's Caesar Seasoned salt to the flour - it gives it a nice tang.  It's very important to let them sit in the fridge with the flour - don't try to cut the time short.

great recipe- I made them vegetarian by using "Cedar Lake- MGM quik chick" (soy chicken) and breaded it like the recipe said.  The meat-eaters in my family loved them.

I've made 2 batches of these.  The first batch I baked in the oven, and used Franks Red Hot Buffalo wing sauce, and the next batch I fried and used half Franks red hot buffalo wing sauce, and half regular franks red hot sauce.  Both were big hits.  Even my 10 year old daughter enjoyed them.  The only suggestion I got was from my husband who wanted them hotter.  But others thought they were perfect.  I will make these again.

These are great!  I made them for New Years and everyone loved them.  One of my friends said they were the best wings she had ever had.  I decided to bake mine, as some others did.  I prepared them the same and just put them on a baking sheet with some oil to coat the bottom of the pan.  The key with baking them is not to turn them or adjust them at all while baking.  The breading will come off unless they are completely done.

I'm not a big fan of wings.  I accidently purchased a frozen bag of wings rather than breasts so I searched for a recipe to use them.  I found this one and served them to a small group at a Christmas gathering.  We didn't have any left and we received many great compliments.  I may use this recipe again for a football party ap.

Delicious recipe. It is rare that a restaurant will sell buffalo wings in Australia and when they do it is never the same as that in the USA, these are great, they bring back many memories of dining in the USA :-)

We have nowhere nearby to grab wings from.  I was desperate, and made these based on the reviews.  They were delicious!  Normally, I don't fry things but I really think that's what made them SO good and crispy.  I will try to bake them next time, but they just won't have that crunch.  Very yummy!

I tried these last night for a party. Everybody loved them. Followed the recipe exactly. My husband loved them. My son has already had the leftovers for breakfast. He said they are better than "the popular restaurant" wings. Thank you for the recipe.

This recipe is the best chicken wing recipe I have ever used. Didn't change anything seasoning wise. I always let my chicken wings set in a equal parts solution of cider vinegar and water prior to flouring. I then place them in a big plastic bag to ensure that the flour mixture will coat each individual wing. Must be in fridge for 90 min prior to cooking for best results. I use shortening when cooking these because they did not come out as good with regular vegetable oil. Yummmm....

I used the suggestion of a reviewer to use Pam rather than the fryer to make these crispy.  They were good!  I don't think that so much butter is needed so I'll lessen that next time.  I'll look to these the next time I want to eat wings!

Woo Doggy!!!  These are fantastic!  You best have a cold beer to chase these down with.  Made recipe exactly as stated.  350 degree heat at 10 minutes was perfect.

These are awsome. My family and I will never go out for wings again. They're so simple to make. I agree with everyone else putting these in the fridge is what makes these wings stand out from the rest. Tonight I'm trying them boneless style!!!

What can I say that hasnt already been said. I make these wings 3 or 4 times a month, they're simply amazing. I also add other seasonings to my Flour mixture. like lawreys seasoning pepper and there seasoning salt.  VERY VERY important you must refridgerate your wings for at least 1 1/2 - 2 hours. if you want them to come out nice and crispy.  And Baking them dont do them justice. Indulge in there deep fried goodness.

These were absolutely delicious, just as good if not better than what you get in a restaurant! the boyfriend agrees. We make these all of the time. I follow them exactly, sometimes adding extra cayenne to the sauce for a little extra kick. Everyone tells me they are the best buffalo wings they've ever had!

This recipe turned out good! I used all the dry ingredients per recipe but did not have time to let it sit for 60 mins, but it still turned out very good. (I par-nuked the wings so they did not need to sit so long in the oil to be done. 5-6 mins) MMMMMMMM!

Fantastic! I will do my wings this way from now on - only next time I will use a different hot sauce...I used Tabasco Habanero sauce, way too spicy for me! I just dipped them in lot of blue cheese!

These were soooo good!! They tasted just like the resturant! I served them for a party & everyone loved them! They were nice & spicy too! The recipe I always used didn't have a breading on them & also used bbq sauce in with the hot sauce which makes them not so spicy! I'm big on spicy stuff so this was awesome!!

This is was an interesting dip! I took this to my family gathering. The first bite I took, I wasn't sure if I like it. Then I took another, and another then it became somewhat addicting. Even my bother in law said the same thing. He said "it's really spicy but it's addicting". My husband said he wasn't sure if he liked it, but he kept coming back for more. The only thing I didn't like about this dip is the hot sauce has that tabasco flavor.. very vinger-y. Maybe if I change hot sauce, I might like it better.

This recipe may seem like a lot of work, but it's actually really easy so don't be intimidated! 
I used a ziplock bag instead of a bowl because it is much easier to get them coated evenly. 
Remember to use a good hot sauce, i find tobasco too chili, I prefer a milder hot sauce...I salted my hot sauce mixture too to give it more taste
YOU WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED WITH THIS GREAT RECIPE!

These were absolutely delicious! I couldn't stop eating them! I doubled the recipe and added two tablespoons of zesty honey mustard to the sauce. These go great with a couple cold beers.

I was really expecting something out of this world as per the hundreds of five star reviews, but we were pretty disappointed as these were just 'nice' but not spectacular. It amounts to fried chicken with a spicy sauce, but it did not taste like the famous ones at all. I followed the recipe exactly so I'm not sure why this is so, except that perhaps using the ''Frank's Hot Sauce'' makes all the difference in the world, in which case it should be listed in the original recipe. As two other reviewers noted, however, this recipe is *not* what buffalo wings are, so the name is misleading. They were pretty good but not worthy of five stars, sorry.

We live in WNY and know Buffalo style chicken wings.  Although this is not exactly the same as you would get from a restaurant around here, it is the closest we have ever achieved making them at home!  After making the sauce, we let it settle and 'clarified' the butter.  This allowed the sauce to be a little thicker.  Coating the wings with flour helps them to be crispier.  We will use the recipe again.  THANK YOU!

Made these using skinless, boneless, chicken breasts. Cut them into 'chicken fingers'. The flour mix was great..did add garlic powder and more cayenne. I no longer own a deep fryer so did fry them in my wok using canola oil , about 4 min a side. They came out crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. I used 1 cup of my favorite new HOT SAUCE..'Valentina' made in Mexico and it is Hotttt! and has a great flavour as well. I think this will be my new wingless 'Hot Wings' recipe from now on. Less fat - more flavour. Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe is definitely a hit- I used it on in a buffalo chicken wrap sandwich that my bf loved! However I made one change to the recipe- my mother has the "original" buffalo wing recipe (clipped from a 1980 magazine & saved) which recommends adding a small amount of white vinegar to the hot sauce/butter mix. For this recipe, I used about a tsp. It adds a little extra zing to the hot sauce mix.

It's name says it all.
The only change I made to the recipe was using 1/8 olive oil, and 1/8 butter.
I also recomend if you like spicy food, you might want to double the peppers.

This sounds alot like the way I have made wings for years..the only difference I make is that I add a little corn syrup or pancake syrup to break up the hot sauce a little..for hot I use 2 parts Franks hot sauce to butter, medium 1/2 hot sauce and 1/2 butter, mild, 1/2 part hot sauce to 1 part butter. I melt the butter with fresh garlic only until the butter it is barely melted. I then take it off the heat and whisk in the hot sauce so it gets thick. You may also use Frank's Wing Sauce in a pinch...

I love this recipe! My boyfriend, who could live off chicken wings, said they were the best he'd had all year. Even told me they tasted better than Hooters! I agree that the secret is to refrigerate the seasoned wings for at least 1 hour before frying. Thanks so much for my new favorite recipe ;o)

I made these last night and they were yummy.  Probably the best ever.  I used 1/2 a cup of Franks Red Hot and 1/4 cup of butter.  I dipped them in the sauce when they were still steaming and served them immeadiately.

Whoa!!! I've gotten lots of recipes off Allrecipes.com, but this is, by far, the bestest!! And easy!! I didn't change anything in the recipe except I started with 1/2 the recommended hot sauce for fear it would be too hot. Ended up adding more to the sauce. The full dose is probably perfect - tangy, but not burn-your-tongue-off offensive. Oh, and my "dash" of garlic is probably bigger than most! This was so good, I felt I had to write a review - which I've never done.

My family LOVED these.  My husband said that they were better than a famous restaurant's wings.  It is a lot of work to make enough wings to feed a family, but well worth it.

So easy to make!!!  I made these for my husband and friends for Superbowl and, they loved it.  I also made a batch using honey garlic wing sauce.  Once the wings were finished frying I just tossed them in some honey garlic wing sauce and let them sit, it was nice and sticky!!!!

These were great!!  I will now compare all restaurant buffalo chicken wings to this recipe.  I used Frank's buffalo style hot sauce instead of the regular one, but followed the recipe exactly with everything else and they were such a hit with the family!!  Will definitely make them again and again!

Made these the other night and blew my fiance out of her seat with how good these turned out. This will be a mainstay in our house as it's better than the best wings (which are pretty darn good) in our area.

Well I don't actually eat foods that are spicy like this, however the rest of my family loved it!!! Including my two children who are some extrememly picky eaters.  I did however add just a bit of honey to the sauce, oh and I used Tabasco for the hot sauce. Everyone loved it and I will surely make it again.

I have made these several times - my boyfriend loves them and asks for them constantly.  We both like hotter wings, so we tend to double all the seasonings and use a sauce ratio of 1 part butter to 2 parts hot sauce.

This sauce was really wonderful -- spicy, tangy, and simple to make.  My husband and I loved it!  I used chicken breast cut into wing size strips.  My only comment is that I don't have a fryer so I fried the chicken a skillet which made most of the coating come off.  Any one have ideas on how to remedy that?

Taste better than hot wings from the pizza place! Hubby loved them. Be sure to buy the wingettes. Instead of using just regular hotsauce in the recipe, I used Franks wing sauce. ADD ONION POWDER, GARLIC POWDER AND SEASON SALT TO MY FLOUR MIXTURE,

Since I don't have a fryer I baked then broiled these wings and they still came out great! Can't wait to get a good fryer so I can try these again.

I made these for a few people coming over for a SuperBowl party.  I kept to the recipe exactly.  Not only were there none left, but I didn't even get to taste one because everyone ate them and were then yelling for more.  I was out of wings at that point and know now that these must be made again very soon.  Absolutely delcious!

Nothing can be said about this recipe except WOW!!! I first made this for a Christmas party, and our entire family loved it. Now we have to have it at least once a week. I change nothing and followed others advice and did not skip the process of letting the coating sit for 1 to 1 and half hours. This is what makes this so different and would not be the same if you skip this step.

this was great!!!  I made it for superbowl.  you can make any amount of wing sauce you like.  Frying seems to be best way of cooking, I tried baking the wings, but stopped mid-way cause the coating was sticking to the dish.

My husband, who is a huge hot wing fan, absolutely loved this recipe.  Instead of chicken wings, I used boneless chicken breasts, cut into "wing-sized pieces".  This made the eating process much less messy. :)  I also added extra hot sauce to the butter/hot sauce mixture to make the wings extra hot.  My husband says that they taste just like the ones at the restaurant.

These were awesome!!  Made exactly as it said and my husband and son were totally impressed.  Both said they were better than what we buy at the local restaurants.  Can't wait to try these with Honey BBQ sauce for my other son who doesn't like the heat! Thanks for a fabulous recipe!

My husband and I made these for the Superbowl. We actually barbequed the chicken, which made the chicken a little crispy. They were great, I really recommend them this way.

We are done searching for the perfect wing recipe! We have always purchased Hooters wing breading and it has become more difficult to find. Followed recipe to a tee and they were the best wings we have ever made. Adjust seasonings to your taste, we will be adding more, the next time. Refrigeration of the wings is crucial. Thanks for sharing this recipe!

I made these for a super bowl party. I did bake in the oven instead of frying and they were okay. I kept reading the reviews thinking it was going to be off the hook, but maybe i needed to fry them up.

You really need to fry the wings.  I tried the baking method that another reviewer wrote about.  Chicken just won't get crispy enough w/o frying.  The sauce is great!  Used "Frank's Red Hot".

Delicious!!  We baked them on a gridden rack over a baking pan, 20 min per side @ 450 deg.  Used Frank's Wing Sauce for most of them.  Others thought the sauce too vinegar-y, but I thought it tasted just like wings at restaurants.  For the kids, we left the cayenne out of the flour and used a sweet honey sauce.  We'll definitely be making these again.

Perfect!  We can finally say good-bye to expensive wings from other places and make them at home with the same great taste!  I do one thing differently, which is baking them instead of frying them.  Absolutely delicious!  Thanks for the recipe!

Wow!  This was GOOD. I will not be going out for wings any more. Made 2 cahanges to the sauce: Added 2 tbsp hotsauce. Added 1 tsp white vinegar. So good.  The coating on the wings was great, and will be a good base for other sauces.

Awesome! I use this recipe all the time! We are huge wing fans and I was looking for some way to make them a little healthier. These are really great baked. I took a suggestion from this site and spray the wings with a little pam and turn up the heat for the last few minutes of baking. A huge hit everytime! I usually leave out the spice and use a honey mustard dipping sauce (from this site) for the kids. They love it!

ABSOLUTELY THE BEST BUFFALO WING RECIPE! Letting then sit in the flour for 1-2 hours helps them get a nice crispy coating when frying. Try not to skip this step! And the sauce is spot on, but if you like a little extra kick like i do, just increase the ratio of hot sauce to butter. I also make these with chicken breast tenders. AWESOME RECIPE! thanks!!

These were delicious!  They rival any restaurant's.  I made them two days in a row.  Peanut oil is an excellent frying oil, there is less smoke and odor.

These are wonderful. Will definitely make again. I added a little less butter though in the sauce-my perference. They were crisp and flavorful with the sauce tossed on them and wonderful to serve up with sauce on the side for my kids.

Followed the recipe exactly and turned out great!  Will certainly experiment with this  a bit.

I personally like my wings hot, and these came out on the mild side.  Taste was spot on though, and very easy.

These were really good.  Thank you for the recipe.  If you want it a little hotter put in more red hot and less butter.... vice versa for milder wings.

If you like heat and flavor - these wings are for you. Made 30 of these last night and they were a hit. Next time I may just leave the sauce in a bowl on the side for everyone to put on themselves. I had someone who loves things spicy say they were too spicy - but good. Go figure - these were delicious.

The chicken was excellent, however we didn't care for the sauce. We had a bottle of Sweet Baby Ray's Honey BBQ sauce and decided to coat them with that and back the sauce in after frying. DELICIOUS!  the chicken gets 5 stars, the sauce gets 1 star

I was a little skeptical about making these since my fiancee and I LOVE wings and WOW was I surprised! They are absolutely delicious, so good I've starting passing out the recipe to family and friends! It is a very good idea to leave these in the fridge for as long as the recipe calls and I love using Frank's Red Hot with this recipe as well- makes the sauce YUMMY! Enjoy these as much as my family and I do!

These turned out great...can't wait to do them again.  Followed the recipe and tweaked the seasonings a bit due to spiceyness.

I use breasts cut into similar size and add a splash of vinegar in the hot sauce mixture.  Very good!

The absolute best wings I've ever made and the best wings I've ever had. Only wings that may have come close, I had at the Magic Parlor in N.Y, and that was 28 or more years ago. Great recipe! ;)

instead of letting the strips marinate in the coating for a long time, next time i'm gonna try dipping the strips in egg, then coating, and again. this is what they do at KFC and i'm hoping that this version will be crispier. i'll also bake this batch b/c i no longer have a deep-fryer to use. the srtips were very good and i can't wait to modify the recipe.

Delish! For a native Texan when you say Hot sauce I immediately think Picante. I did realize that's not what you meant & used Frank's Hot Sauce. Not a fan of Paprika so I subbed Garlic. Great! Thanks.

These turned out fantastic and the refridgeration step made all the difference.  However, I was scared to make my own hot sauce so I mixed store bought buffalo and barbeque sauce together and used that instead.  BTW: I also used this method for boneless wings as well with delicious results.

Fantastic! I did not have enought time to let it sit for 9o min. in the refrigerator, but since I had other things to make, it sat for 30 minutes in the fridge and it they still came out great! next time, I will prepare overnight and see if there's a difference, but they were delicious! i used a little less hot sauce, since we don't like them too spicy and we loved them.

first time making buffalo wings. this recipe uses too much butter, i had to dump the whole bottle of hot sauce in to add more flavor and color.  not as spicy as i would have liked it to be but it was a good overall recipe.

Okay, these are seriously so amazing! But then again I am a chicken wing fanatic! I dont like things too spicy so I replaced 1/2 the cayenne with more paprika. I also tried it both ways and seasoning the wings with salt/pepper/lowrys before coating with the flour mixture makes for better taste.
I sued Franks hot sauce as well. If you want even less spicy, just do more butter less hot sauce in the sauce.

Wow!  These were perfect!  I doubled the sauce because I like them swimming in it.  I am going to try chicken tenders next time because we just aren't big "meat on the bone" eaters.  Just the right amount of spice that makes it not too hot for my kids. Yum!

I don't know what I did wrong. I was so excited to try this recipe! The sauce was good, but there wasn't enough of it, the chicken wouldn't brown (the oil was plenty hot) and they just had a weird taste. I followed the recipe to a T- used corn oil to cook with...I was disapointed.

This was really good!  I did half of a batch of this kind and half of a batch of wings without breading.  The part without breading did not get eaten; I literally threw them away!  I won't tell you which recipe it was on here I used!  Without that extra coating, it doesn't taste right!

This sure was a family hit!  My husband and kids (9 and 6) didn't so much like the sause, it was a bit too hot for them, but the kids dipped their chicken in ranch and my husband dipped his in BBQ and we LOVED it!!!

Mmmmm...delicious! Very easy to make too. I was worried it would be too spicy (for my kids) but it was perfect! I cut the wing tips off and cut the wings in half to make them look more like the traditional buffalo wings and served with ranch dressing and celery sticks. My 9 yr old is already begging me to make them again!

These are the best chicken wings I've had. I've been to the Buffalo Wing restaurant and I think these are even better. I cut down the butter a little bit in the sauce to save a few calories. Even better the next day!

Wow! These were fantastic! Better than the restaurant type. My husband bought chicken wings a few weeks ago and asked me to make him some so I found this recipe and made them. He really liked them and he wants me to make them again. This is a great recipe!!! Lots of kick to them. Thanks!

Awesome!  I've been looking for this recipe.  I don't think the wing sauce was that great, but it will be very easy to add some of this and that to adjust the flavor to my taste.

These are the ones!!! My family loves them and we will never get them in a resturaunt again- these are just so much better. Hubby likes them hot so he adds extra hot sauce at the table- kids love them just the way they are.

My brothers devoured these wings. I made some exactly to the recipe. I also made some where I substituted the hot sauce with BBQ sauce for some in my family that do not like hot foods. Both ways were a tremendous hit.

For myself and a few pepper lovers I added 1 T. of "Mad Dog 'Inferno'".... WOW!!! lovely smoking ears!!!!

This is a great recipe!  It has a little heat but isn't overly hot--just perfect for our family.  If you like a real spicy chicken wing, add more hot sauce.  We modified it a little so that we could make buffalo chicken sandwiches.  I cut the chicken into approx 1-1 1/2 inch slices (which only require 6-8 minutes in the deep frier at 375).  My husband raved over it so many times, I will be making this again soon.

These were great! However, I used Tobasco sauce and this came out VERY spicy! Next time, I'll use something a bit milder.

For a lighter version, we boiled our large wings, brushed with sauce and baked until lightly brown. The sauce was great. They were a hit at our party.

Excellent! We didn't use wings for the recipe, but cut up chicken breasts instead and had strips. It was delicious and had a lot of punch packed into such small pieces!

WoW!!! Delicious, came out PERFECT! We live in an area where you can't get the wings we are used to in upstate NY. These taste just like the wings we love. Skip ordering out for wings,, make these instead!

I made this for a Superbowl party.  The sauce tasted good, but it was just swimming in grease.  After the wings sat a  few minutes, the sauce completely solidified.

These wings are fabulous. This is the best wing recipe I've ever tried.  I made a few changes to make the wings very hot.  The flour/pepper combination is great, but I added a bit more cayenne pepper. I also used about a cup of Frank's hot sauce, 4 tablespoons of butter, and a splash of white vinegar.  Finally, I baked the wings in a 300 degree oven for about five minutes to dry them out.

This was a wonderful recipe for wings.  We enjoyed it as is, however, I can see so much versatility for the coating and the sauce (add or change ingredients to taste).  Thanks for the great recipe.  It is a new favorite in our house.

I made this as one of the appetizers I served on Christmas Eve Dinner.  Everyone really enjoyed them! My family and I aren't into real "spicy food", so I played it safe and used Red Devil Hot Sauce (because it has a nice subtle spicy taste to it).  Will definitely do again!

I even made a bunch of wings without the hot sauce for those who just wanted fried chicken wings (however, for this batch, I did add 1 tspn of Adobo seasoning to give it an extra kick).  Was a hit!

I would suggest doubling the amount of hot sauce. The butter drowns out the flavor. I would also suggest putting the wings in the saucepan while the sauce is hot and letting it soak for a while. It taste much better like that - especially if you like your wing sauce! Have fun cooking.

These wings were awesome!  Nice and crispy and not overpoweringly spicy.  I used Franks Hot Sauce and it was delicious.  If you like really hot, some substitutions or additions would probably have to be made...but I made them as the recipe directed and they were perfect for our tastes!  Thanks a bunch Kelly.  You've given us our new "stay-at-home" football gameday appetizer.

These were awesome!!!!  So crispy and tasty and EASY!! I used Frank's Red Hot ready made sauce for Buffalo Wings which made it even easier.  This is definetly a keeper.  My son and his friends usually order take out buffalo wings when they get together at our house on the weekends ($5 for an order of 8 pieces!!) I made 20 wings (40 pieces) for about $5.  Now that's a deal and tasty too!!

I made this for a family get together and everyone LOVED them.  I dont enjoy spicey food myself but they went fast! I used Franks Extra Hot sauce for the sauce and everyone said they were at the brink of being too hot but had a great flavour. Also, I cooked them in advance then reheated them in the microwave and they were still great!

Came out great but not enough color, like the photo. I’ll add more of the spices next time.  The fridge time is a great strategy, though.

Amazing! The key is the refrigeration of the chicken before frying, and then use sauce of choice.

This is on the menu at least once a week! Teenagers just love them and me for making them. I've switched over to thighs instead of wings just cause there's more meat.

Harden is correct about not breading the wings, but you do not have to use Franks Red hot. Ive made my own that I will put up against Franks or any other commercial sauce. Also a good tip to get them nice and crispy is to fry them for about 5 to 7 minutes and as soon as the oil temp drops a bit, pull them and allow the oil to reach 400 again and then drop them in for the last 7 minutes and you will get perfect wings that are crispy on the outside and juicy in the middle.

I followed the instructions regarding the ingredients, exactly as listed. I have made this many times using this recipe now. Depending on the amount of time I have I prepare it different. If I have enough time, I will coat the wings with the flour mixture the morning I plan on making them. At dinner time, I bake the wings (in a baking ceramic pan with a thin layer of butter on the bottom) withOUT the sauce. I set my oven for 350 degrees and after 20 minutes, I turn them over and sprinkle any extra flour mixture I have. I leave them for another 20 minutes. Then I take them out and coat them with the sauce at 375 degrees and 10 additional minutes (we like them crispier). My husband loves them!

I made this yesterday and it came out excellent! I made the recipe exactly as is to make the breading, but the sauce I used can't be classified as "Buffalo " but it was a really good spicy wing. I doubled the recipe and refrigerated the wings for almost 2 hrs and then I fried half of them and baked the other half for comparison. Fried wings are juicier, but the flavor was relatively the same. Definitely will be using this recipe for now on.

I always bake these and i can’t imagine them being better! My favourite wing recipe. I add a teaspoon of garlic powder and onion powder each to the flour mix, and for baking It helps to spray the pan. I spray the wings  with vegetable oil and bake at 350 for 30-40 min, turning once and respraying.  sauce mix is 1 part butter to 1.5 parts Frank’s buffalo wing sauce for a moderate level of spice to our tastes.

I let the wings marinate for about 35 mins in jalapeno juice before adding flour mixture then I let the wings marinate for another 25 mins (1 hour marinate) I used Frank's Red Hot Wing sauce . So delicious will make again but with a twist next time.

I’ve been making my own wings for years and I can say these are the best I’ve ever made.  I didn’t fry because I made 20 wings (40 pieces) and it would of taken longer to fry a few batches.  Placed racks on a broiler pan, sprayed chicken lightly with Pam, baked 20 minutes at 400 degrees, flipped and sprayed with Pam again and baked another 20 minutes at 400. I made my sauce using Frank’s Red Hot WINGS because the instructions said just Hot Sauce and  I thought Tabasco sauce would be watery. Since I made more than double the wings I doubled the coating mix and the sauce recipes which was the perfect amount. Next time I might fry if I don’t have a big batch to make and that will be very soon because I’m putting this into my dinner rotation.  DELICIOUS!!

Made just as written, and it was fabulous! We were able to eat until we were stuffed for less than the price of one meal at a wing restaurant! Definitely will be a part of my meal rotation, especially during football season!

The first time I made these I accidently bought Frank's Hot Wings sauce instead of Frank's hot sauce. Rather than make a trip to the store to get the correct item I used it. They turned out really well. I mentioned my error to my husband and he said not to change a thing about them. I just made them again for him and his brother. They both raved about them. I should mention that after I put the wings in the sauce I did take them out and put them in the oven for just a few minutes. Then I dipped them again. Sticky. Sweet. Spicy. Superb.

THE BEST - Better than the restaurant in my opinion!  They were delicious!  Even on the second day leftovers.  Easy to do - especially since I let my husband do it.  He had no trouble at all following the recipe and boy were they delicious!  It's a keeper!

These were really good. I used 8 large frozen wings from Sams. I put the flower mixture on them while they thawed in a bag and also in warm water for part of the time. Because of the frozen water, it turned to a paste so I have no idea if that was bad or good. It sat for about 45-50 minutes in and out of the warm water. The sauce was good and I added a little bit of coconut sugar because we like the sweet taste and that was good but I would add more next time. We used a deep fryer and fried them for about 5 minutes. The batter did stick to the basket though. It was set to 400 which I think was the highest setting. I'm excited to make these again.

REALLY good, not too spicy and easy to make.  I started with 325 and then for the last 20 minutes to 375.  Will definitely make again!

I substituted arrow root flour for 1/2 the flour.  I also cooked wings for 8 minutes, let them rest for 12, then cooked then 8 more minutes.  Makes them very crispy and wonderful!!!

Oh my God I just made this with using El Yucateco Chile Habanero hot sauce. So good but mouth is on fire in a good way. Chicken was crunchy while sauce mixture was spot on.

Fantastic. 
Easy to make. 
I have added some cornstarch to the flour mixture, so it made them crunchier. I recommend it in any way. 
Beautiful thing is that the sauce is easy, and simple, and can be modified to your taste, without any problem. 
This is a must try. Have fun.

The first time I made these wings I thought that I would get creative and I played around with changing some things to try and make it better, but in a reality, this recipe is perfect. It turns out so much better when I just follow the directions and make it. I do them in a deep fryer and the texture is great! A key to this recipe is the correct hot sauce. I only use Frank's brand of hot sauce and they turn out great!

Just used the recipe for the coating.  I did not use the sauce portion.  But in a deep fryer at 375 degrees 12 minutes worked well.

I didn't know what you meant by "hot sauce" so I used the Old Elpasso salsa I had in the fridge. It didn't taste anything like restaurant buffalo sauce.

It was really good.  The butter with the hot sauce helped it stick to the wings.   I used an air fryer and it worked great, but I wish I had cooked it a little hotter to crisp the outside more.  Also, with an air fryer, the dry flour mix needed a little moisture, so I'd probably play around with that a little.

Like Claudette I added garlic & onion powder. I also used Crystal Hot Sauce in the sauce. Because the wings I used are larger than normal I deep fried them 3min each side, drained the oil and immediately dunked them in the sauce. Keeping then in the oven while cooking the rest, kept them crispy. Hubby loved them!

Perfect chicken! I haven't made the sauce yet. I used the same seasonings in approximate proportions - I just eye balled it to my taste. I did not refrigerate. after defrosting chicken,  I soaked in buttermilk for approximately 15 minutes. Then poured buttermilk off. I left some buttermilk hanging on to chicken and I seasoned the chicken before flouring. Then I tossed the chicken together. The remaining buttermilk made it like a sauce. I dipped dripping sauced wings in flour, coated, set aside, seasoned floured wings, then tossed again and then fried at 375.

OMG I’ll never go back to the restaurant and pay so much. I did a huge family pack about 45 wings for $22 bucks. Delicious my son loved them. I tripled the recipe but next time I’ll use less butter and more hot sauce for the sauce a total success

I've used this exact recipe for many years and everyone loves it. It's become our traditional New Years dish. This year when I couldn't find it in my recipe books, I came to Allrecipes and typed in, "Restaurant Style Hot Wings" and thankfully it popped right up.

Use Texas Pete - it has the vinegar that gives real Buffalo wings their tangy without making them too hot.

First off great recipe. Things to remember, make sure you cook with peanut oil. I use seasoned flour and a sifter to get a nice light coat on. Also add a little bit of onion powder to the sauce. Never completely cover the wings in sauce as they can become soggy. Use a ladle to drizzle sauce on.

I make this regularly and it it one of our favorite dishes! The only change I make is to use chicken tenders and with that you reduce the cooking time a little.

Marinated in the dry rub in the fridge for  60 minutes.  Then poured wet ingredients over it right before putting in oven.  Baked at 350 degrees for 45 minutes (5 chicken wings).

Have to give this 5 stars just based on the method alone. I'm assuming it is the butter mixed with the hot sauce that allows this sauce to penetrate the deep fried skin unlike other recipes. For me that's a winner and makes this worthy of following. I've know for time and tried and failed to get sauce to penetrate the fried chicken. Regardless of what spices you use, this method works very well.

These hot wings are perfect prepared exactly as written! I don’t like my mouth to feel like it’s on fire after I eat hot wings and some recipes are just too hot for me. If you want to back off on the heat a little you could leave out the cayenne pepper. I served these with Ranch and Bleu Cheese for variety. Everyone was pleased!

Yes, I doubled the ingredients.  One full package of wings so the double batch worked better. I think next time I will even use more hot sauce.

First off, I'm not "from Buffalo" and have never been, but anyone rating 1 star because of a word needs to get off their high horse and actually make a recipe before rating it (because we all know you didn't actually even try the recipe).
This recipe is DELICIOUS. My husband loves wings and he says these are the best he has ever tasted! I literally make them every week and it is definitely a must to let them sit in the fridge for an hour before frying or they won't be crispy. The only thing I've changed over time is only using half the amount of butter in the sauce because we like it hot.

Not as spicy as I thought it would be.  I used boneless chicken breast sliced very thick.  I will make again and kick up the spice a little.  Good recipe.

WOW! Best wings ever! Instead of flour I used organic oats that I ground to a flour-like consistency using a coffee grinder, and I used grapeseed oil to fry. I also added some Nando's sauce to the Sriracha mixture. 5 stars! Making this for 4th of July now to celebrate from Canada :)

Wonderful! Perfect for the Actifryer. Just don't overload; about 5 to 10 wings at a time. Great way to reduce the fat.

I love this recipe. I made it as is. The only change I would make is adding 1/4 cup more of hot sauce. I like my wings spicy and these were a bit mild.

As written this recipe is very bland...the breading and the sauce both pretty terrible. I had to make major seasoning modifications to make this good.  How this recipe consistently got high ratings is a mystery to me...??

Made exactly as directed, and wow! These were fantastic!! Crispy but perfectly cooked chicken with just the right amount of spice and tang in the sauce. Would say I’d make them again soon, but still struggling with how to strain and reuse the veg oil I fried them in.

These were really good! I followed the advice of other reviewers and baked them instead of frying. I enjoy my wings a little spicier though and will probably cut down on the amount of butter next time. All in all, delicious!

I followed this recipe on Super Bowl Sunday, except I thought I COULD JUST BAKE  the wings, instead of frying them ( in the interest of being less fattening!).  They tasted oK but weren't crisp enough to be  true buffalo chicken wings.

These were really good and although the taste definitely reminded me of Hooters wings, the texture did not ... these were very moist whereas Hooters tend to be a drier texture.  All in all though, GREAT flavor and enjoyed by all.

I cooked these up for the Super Bowl and they tasted just like the ones you get at your local restaurant. Crunchy on the outside, tender and juicy inside. After coating them with the batter I let them sit in my refrigerator overnight and I used Moores brand mild hot wing sauce. Great recipe folks!

Restaurant standard!!! Very tasty!!! I didn't have garlic powder so use fresh garlic (miced and fried it using very little oil). Thank you so much for the recipe. Definitely a keeper! :)

Followed the recipe and advice from other reviews, allowed the wings 90 mins in the fridge.  Drudged in hot sauce and baked for 25 mins each side.  Then  5 mins on broil .  Wings were great, moist and tangy.  Will use this recipe again.  Thanks

Easy and delicious.  I did use the oven instead of frying the wings and teriyaki instead hot sauce, just because my husband can't eat spicy hot food.  They came out great!  Totally success!

I've made these twice now and LOVE THEM! MashaAllah! I use freshly ground whole einkorn flour instead to give it a bit of sweetness. And I double the spices for the coating.  I don't deep fry, but if I do I will use coconut oil instead of veg. oil. I bake them on 220°C and turn after 20 minutes. The last  10 minutes I put the broiler on to crisp them. Inshaallah
I always make a double batch and freeze the extra to snack on later.  Just heat them up, or even pull them out of the freezer and just let them thaw, sometimes they don't even make it to the oven. ;) My husband loves to nibble on them throughout the afternoon. MashaAllah! A great staple for any fridge!  Great main meal, Great snack!!!!! MashaAllah!
I also make my own hot sauce with fresh tomatoes and chilis. Wonderful eats!!!!!!

I love this recipe. I have made it many times and my guests always compliment these wings. Maybe they aren't the original Buffalo Wings, but in my experience, there  are always improvements to be made. I make this recipe exactly as is without any alterations.

This is not a Buffalo wing. Here in Buffalo we do not bread our wings. And we you franks hot sauce and butter and serve with blue cheese...never ranch dressing. I don't know where the creator of this recipe lives (it's definitely not Buffalo) but please change the name of this recipe to your city.

These wings were delicious and very easy to make. I baked them at 450 degrees a little over 45 minutes. My whole family loved them, even the ones that don't like too much spice. Next time I'll try them with just the flour blend( doubling the spices) Thanks for a great recipe :)

I did this in an actifryer and used whole wheat flour instead of white and it tasted just as good (excellent). No butter needed but the required oil for the actuary. I love this recipe.

These are not Buffalo, NY style.  Buffalo style wings are deep fried, "naked."  No flour.

I pulled the wings from the pan, let them dry for 3 minutes then dipped them in the hot sauce. Then broiled them for 3-5 min on high.

very very good.  I did one additional thing that I do with my honey teryaki chicken nuggets.  I leave the sauce in the sauce pan on the stove on low.  As the wings are fried, I put them in the sauce pan for a minute, then take them out, place them on a rack that's in a cookie sheet (line with foil to catch the drip) and bake them at 250 for about 5-10 minutes.  The wings absorb the flavor and kicks it up another notch.

These wings are perfection. We made then last night and every single Wing was eaten. We were a little concerned about using the flour mixture as we don't like breaded wings. I do agree that you must do the flour mixture to make them crispy and the sauce sticks to the wings. We put the flour mixture on the wings early in the morning and cooked later in the evening and they were perfect. We cook our wings using the two step fry 1st we cook the wings at 275 for 15 minutes to light golden brown. We then turn the heat to 375 to crisp the outside. We like crispy wings so we cook them for 15 minutes. These wings are just like restaurant style and we will use the method from now on.

Here's a Nother way to do this recipe. Mix all the dry ingredients except for the flower in the sauce pan when you're melting the hot sauce and butter and let that simmer for a little bit. If you buy a bag of already cooked and coated chicken wings, the non-buffalo style. Keep them up in the oven and then once the chicken is done in a large bowl put the chicken wings in with the sauce mixed together and then serve. It's really good and it's just like you get that the 99 restaurant

I've made this recipe at least a dozen times now and it's just perfect. A few days ago the was too tired to cook so I went to a very popular place for wings. What a waste.  Not only did I feel guilty for wasting my money but also calories, because the wings were horrible.  I should have known better. This recipe is so quick and easy. For me they always come out perfect. I learned my lesson the hardway. This Recipes is indeed a keeper.

I love this! So yum. Also because it was easy to make. Mine didn't turn out soggy. Changes I made: Instead of wings, I used chicken breasts; baked instead of deep frying (so I didn't use any oil); whole wheat flour instead of all-purpose; 1/2 teaspoon of paprika and cayenne instead of 1/4. Will probably make it again next week.

I have been making wings for years, but this method is by far the best.  I don't use a 1:1 ratio for the hot sauce to butter, (much less butter and a bit of vinegar), but otherwise this is the best method for crispy, tender wings.

ive tried these so many times lately and they've turned out the best using a deep fat fryer. i tweek the sauce slightly using different hot sauces as the base  (cholula is hands down my favourite ) but you cant go wrong with Franks Red Hot or Wings sauce

This will be the only way I ever make wings again!  I made the original ten count but had to immediately take more wings out to make more! I have a feeling I will be making these quite often Thanks for an excellent recipe!

I don't personally like buffalo wings, but my fiance does so I made them for him. He loved them! I used Franks Red Hot Buffalo sauce and served it with celery and ranch dressing. Will definitely make these for Party appetizers...

Update: Fiance doesn't like the greasiness of the sauce with the butter mixed in. Next time I will just use the sauce itself without the butter

These were a hit at our super bowl party last night!  And so easy!  Definitely do not skip the fridge time after breading the wings.  I know there is a lot of controversy about breading or not breading.  I like them both ways, but only light breading.  I always thought Hooters breading was too thick, not traditional. These turned out great and I will be making them again!

These could be much more delicious if you would soak the wings in a Britney solution for 24 hours before you cook them.  The sauce is delicious.  Just not salty enough for me.  Would be 5 stars if they had more salt. Sorry, I love salt!

Added garlic powder to flour mixture.  (Cut most the skin off the drummettes. )  Deep fried at 350 for 8 minutes. Absolutely delicious!!!!  Will make again.  Loved the sauce over it too.

Hardeen Is correct 100 Percent.  Buffalo wings are never breaded, and it has to be Franks and real butter.  And they should never, ever be swimming in sauce.

Instead of frying the chicken wings I baked them at 375 degrees for 1 hour (I used large split wings) Then broiled for 10 minutes on each side. They turned out awesome.

YUMMY!! I followed Anydolls variation as it cuts down on fat. I also doubled the spices putting 1/2 directly on chicken and 1/2 in flour mixture for dredging. I would double that. Also turn chicken over 1/2 through baking. Spraying with cooking oil GREAT. Since the dipping sauce is so fatty cooking chicken on a rack a draining off was a wonderful idea. Chicken crisp and good. If wings are meaty you will need to bake the 'drummets' about 10 minutes longer than the less meaty parts. Will make again soon!!

I have been making wings "naked" (not me, the wings!!  No flour or spices) for the longest time and my family and friends always loved them.  After seeing this recipe I decided to give it a try.  Followed the recipe exactly and they were amazing.  Much crispier than the traditional way (unless you fry the heck out of them) and tastier.  I will never make "naked" wings again.  In fact, I'm making them again today (my 2nd time) and I'm going to try and bake them per many suggestions in the reviews. 

This is not true to the original Buffalo Wings recipe.  I think it's better!!!

Just made these for Bedlam football party and they were devoured! Some said the best they ever had. I baked them according to AMYDOLL'S instructions but did spray with Pam before baking and doubled the seasonings. Excellent!! Will always be my Wings recipes! Thanks AMYDOLL for the baking instruction!

Best hot wings I have ever made. I had to make them 2 days in a roll for my family. I made 50 for a gathering of football we had and it wasn't enough. I had to again make them for the family at home to enjoy. Make sure to not skip the refrigerator process because that helps keep them crunchy once you fry them.

I made the wings exactly as instructed.  At the end, I tossed the wings in the sauce and placed on cookie sheet.  I put them in 350 degree oven to bake the sauce on them.  So delicious.  I also made a honey BBQ sauce with chipotle.   This was fabulous also.  I will be making these again.

I made this tonight.  I made just a few changes.  First of all, I used a clove of fresh garlic, minced, in the sauce instead of garlic powder.  Also, since I was making this for our grandsons I cut the cayenne pepper in half.  I used garlic salt in place of the garlic powder and salt in the flour coating.  Oh, and I used Bob's Red Mil 1 to 1 gluten free flour instead of regular all purpose flour as we are all gluten free.   I cooked the drum part of the wings for 15 minutes and the smaller wing end for 10.  Everyone loved these wings.

Excellent. I've made these several times and will always go back to this recipe. Like everyone says in here, make sure to refrigerate the coated wings. The longer the better the breading sticks. I've also made buffalo shrimp the same way, same recipe, just swapped the chicken w the shrimp. It's great.

GET THEM WHILE THEIR HOT!! This was very good. Not many changes, except a small suggestion of leaving the wings in the fryer for a little longer to get them extra crispy, but if doing this definitely keep an eye of them. that's all personal preference though so be mindful of what you like. Overall, I impressed everyone with quality style wings last night

Very good - I agree that this is a great, easy recipe.  We also do Low Carb so used coconut flour.  Turned out great.  I think you could do without flour and just the seasoning and it would be good.  I use the Budweiser wing sauce.

The only thing I don't like about these is how often my family wants me to make them! I add a little extra cayenne and garlic powder because my family likes them hot. We've been to plenty of restaurants and had wings, but every time I hear, "Your's are better!" Thanks for the recipe.

The first time i made them i thought these were great! However, im about to share a little secret that will ensure the crispiest and best wings youll ever have! So here it is.. first of all you want to lightly flour each wing and i mean lightly, second, you want to fry your wings low and slow like a med/low setting, do this for 15 mins. Remove wings from hot oil and let tjem drain on a rack or paper towel if you do not have a wire rack. Your wings will be cooked through at this point but not ready to eat, and here is the most important part, transfer wings to a baking sheet and pop in the freezer for a few hrs uncovered. ( very important.) Take the wings out 15 mins before yoir ready to fry them for the second time. Heat your oil to med high and fry wings for 10 more mins, flipping every few mins if you dont have a deep fryer. Then drain them amd toss the hot crispy wings in your favorite sauce! There is a science to why these are cooked this way.. whateber it is, these are the best wings ive ever had!!

Excellent, I doubled the amount of flour and all the condiments and it was barely enough if you double dip it in the egg and milk mixture.

2016. Just made this, but my husband and I are in a low carb diet, so I substituted the flour with coconut flour, and it was still so wonderful, even the kids loved it. Will definitely save this and make it again.

Made it per recipe. Doesn't need any changes at all.  As many have stated, chilling 60 - 90 minutes is the most important thing. Will keep it for my go to recipe for wings!

Excellent. It's been almost a weekly staple in our home for 5 years. Friends coming over will ask "are we having wings?" For a less messy wing, after frying,  I put them in a bowl and pour the hot sauce over them and mix to coat. Then into a 300 oven for 5 minutes. 

Harden1313 from Buffalo review has it right about the "drying" thing. That's why I coat and oven them.

I have deep fried maybe 6 times in 16 years. This was one of those times and it was worth it.  I used a small pot (maybe 20oz of veggie oil) and could only do 3-4 wingettes at a time. I fried  small batches @ 375 F for 9-10 minutes.  Cooled wingettes on a cookie rack to drain. Made Tabasco sauce per recipe, tossing wingettes  in pot in small batches. Laid out on baking sheet and put in pre-heated oven at 325 degrees for 15 additional minutes. I served these wings plus teriyaki wingettes, butter/rosemary wingettes , and plain fried for pre-4th of July. My fussiest eater can't wait for next time. The buffalo wings went first before the teriyaki. This recipe is on my summer hit parade surpassing jerk wings.

Simple and tasty!  The hot sauce and / or cayenne can be adjusted to your personal "hot" food level.  I will certainly try this again and just kick up the heat.

Great little recipe for  wing.  I've made it so many times now that I can't count.  I use chicken thighs most of the time.  A HUGE hit with the hubby and son.

We have made this many, many times with wings! Last night I used it for not only with wings but for all pieces of chicken and it just can not be beat! We do make one change though; instead of all purpose flour we use Wondra brand. It just makes the coating very thin and very crispy! Awesome!

Wonderful recipe! Still might be easier and price comparable to order out though. I baked mine as a few others have suggested, and I loved them. Will try it again fried and will definitely use this recipe again.

Made these tonight and they were great! I used Frank's buffalo wing sauce with the butter and other spices, came out perfect. We like our wings a little crispy so I left them in the deep fryer a little longer! Will make again, thanks

GREAT breaded wing recipe base, the sauce is where you can change things up, I like 8oz FRANKS to one stick butter, or bbq sauce, or garlic Parmesan, or ranch, or just plain for the kiddos.

Very good. My deep fryer cooked wings in about 8 minutes.  Very good sauce.  We like them milder so we added more butter once made to thin out the heat. Won't go wrong with this recipe.  Thank you for submitting it!  I also used the first part of this recipe and made an Asian sauce to go with some of the wings for my daughter.

I deep fried those wings for about 6 mins, then baked them in the oven. They turned out quite juicy.

Came out well, well liked by entire family.  Flour mixture seems overkill, we did 26 wings in 1.5 the amount called for 10.  Did not have ebough oil to submerge the wings, so flipped them at about 3 minutes per side.

We ate twice as many wings as we normally would have... Normally there should have been leftovers, but tonight just piles of bones! Great recipe. Also made a sweet glaze from brown sugar, soy sauce, garlic and ginger with a touch of orange juice.

This has an excellent taste, but tends to have a soggier texture. Hotter oil is needed to give the wings a more crisp finish.

Added onion and garlic powder to the dry rub. Used a deep fat fryer to control the temperature of the oil. For the hot sauce, I added a little bit of flour to thicken it up.

The proper way is using 2c whole wheat flour and 1c flour and they need to set in the fridge for at least 60 min. I've tried them both ways and will only deep fry them using peanut oil, Best flavour for sure. Same recipe as Hooters.

This recipes was excellent.  Even down to advising to cook the chicken for about 15 mins.  If your oil is the right heat, you can get it crispy, juicy and thoroughly cooked for the 15 min cooking time.  The sauce was excellent and absolutely restaurant style

I made these and they were delicious. While it was spicy I added more paprika and cayenne for a bit more heat. I also changed up the butter/hot sauce ratio as per another persons comments. I used about 110gm butter with a bottle (300ml) of Franks hot sauce. I also cut the full wings up into three pieces and only used the two main parts. I used about 1-1/12 kg of wings and there was enough sauce and flour for this. I deep fried mine, the skin was crispy and the chicken was juicy. Enjoy !!

Great basic recipe to get mild wings,  it at least 15mins fry time.  If you don't like flour crusty wings,  omit that.  Nothing like fresh fried wings!! Recommend kicking it up a notch with habanero  or serrano hot sauce addition.

Absolutely loved these! I followed the recipe precisely, till the bbq sauce. I had no hot sauce. I used ketchup, lemon juice, red wine vinegar, cayane pepper, honey and brown sugar, and butter. I heated that up and put on the side. After frying the wings, I dipped lightly into the sauce, and fried again for a minute or two. After laying fried wings on paper towel I drizzled sauce on top in a bowl. When all wings were in the bowl I mixed them up to cover all wings. HUGE hit for the super bowl !

I made this into a crockpot recipe.  I dredged chicken tenderloins (2 lbs) in flour, doubled the sauce recipe and then cooked it on low for 3 hours.  We loved it!  Served it over rice.  Huge hit with the buffalo wings lovers in the family!

I've made it several times and my family loves it!!! It is literally the only thing I bring to the table now, but I do love an extra kick of spice so I added creole and cayenne pepper seasoning to  the sauce and it came out great.

First time we've ever cooked wings at home, followed recipe exactly and they were great! ! Cooked 80 wings. ..everyone raved!  Will add more amounts of spices to flour mixture next time as they are pretty darn good without tossing in sauces too.

Recipe was great just as if I had ordered it at a restaurant. I substituted the garlic powder with diced garlic and put them in the over for 15 minutes after adding the sauce. They we don't entered they were falling off the bone!

These wings are bar none, some of the best ever! I have tried all kinds of wings recipes, and this is one of my favorites... There are wing eaters in my household that prefer their wings dry (rather than the directed wet) style, so after frying the wings for 5 minutes on each side, I placed them on a wire rack on a foil lined pan in a 400 degree oven for another 10 minutes. The wings turned out crispy, tasty, and perfect! I used Frank's, which wasn't spicy enough for my taste, so I will be making these again and experimenting with some other hot sauces! Thanks for such a great dish!

I bake them on a parchment lined baking sheet at 375 for about 30 minutes, flipping them at 15 minutes. Other than cooking method, I follow recipe as is and love them!

The family loved them. Coated them with  wing sauce and popped them under the broiler for a few minutes so they wouldn't quite as messy for them to use their ranch dipping sauce. Definitely will make again.

Loved this wing recipe! Only change was brining the wings the day before which made the chicken extra moist.  Next time I will add more spices to the flour mixture since we all like dry rub wings.  I am not a fan of fried food BUT these were pretty amazing and not greasy.

I can't emphasize enough the importance of keeping the coated chicken wings in the fridge overnight. I also added a tablespoon of vinegar in with the hot sauce.

These were awesome!  Followed the recipe as given but did not fry them 10-15 minutes (more like 5-10 minutes) in a cast iron deep skillet with canola oil.   They tasted just like we get them from the restaurant, maybe even better!

I am pretty picky about wings, these are excellent.  I have made this recipe at least five times and every time they turn out great.  I add more hot sauce than butter for a spicier wing.  I also add garlic powder seasoned salt and onion powder to the flour.  MUST TRY THIS RECIPE WILL NOT DISAPPOINT

I dont like fried food so I did as another person did

 I baked on a rack set over a jelly roll pan at 350 for 45 minutes. Then I turned the oven to 375 and sprayed the wings with Pam and let them bake 5 more minutes so they got crispy. Excellent and you'll never miss the deep fried taste!
They tasted just likr fried wing, but better!

Buff wings turned out great! I like them extra crispy, so after frying and mixing with sauce, I placed in the oven on broil for about 2 minutes each side. After crisping the wings, I made a side of sauce again, specifically for dipping. Served with fried green tomatillos, baked potato fries, carrots, celery, buff sauce and ranch dressing.

These are really good wings but I have made better at home. The best wings is Mojo's you can get online at kickenwings.com. Good prices easy to make and the best light crispy dry battered hot wing you will ever have.

These are great! I like to season my flour heavily so increase the recommended amount listed. I usually top them with either a buffalo sauce or a homemade bbq teriyaki sauce but the wings themselves are great!

Too much butter, as other's have mentioned. I add a couple of small chunks of butter and throw in some Franks, add a tiny dash of vinegar, some garlic powder, cayenne, chilli powder or Tobasco sauce, Worcestershire sauce. If taste is too buttery, add more Franks to taste. I don't add any salt or pepper. The sauce is ok! 

SOMETIMES I mix in a little Thai Sriracha sauce with the Franks and it seems to taste more like the restaurant version...I don't know...give it a try though.

This recipe turned out great. Since I had to triple the recipe, I poured the sauce over the done wings and put them in the oven with the oven turned on 350 degrees Fahrenheit. I kept doing that every time a batch got done and it was amazing. If you let the chicken sit in the oven if you have multiple batches, the wings won't get soggy. They stay crunchy! This is just a tip if you have multiple batches or if you are waiting for somebody to come home to start eating!

Amazing recipe. Followed a combination of the popular recommendation by cooks and the recipe itself. My boyfriend and I truly believe these are the best wings we have ever had. They could be a little more spicy

I had never made wings before and was a little nervous about how they would turn out...I had nothing to worry about.  These are absolutely delicious!  They were so crispy and full of flavour.  I followed a reviewer's advice and adjusted the sauce to 2/3 butter 1/3 sauce (we like ours mild).  I will be making this again and again. Thanks!

Easy, yummy and "lighter" tasting than tradition take-out wings. The recipe is not spicy at all. Great for Mild Wing Lovers.

Boyfriend loves wings so I made these.  I am not a wing eater.  That being said, I thought the sauce was spot on.  Tangy, nice flavor and spicy enough for my boyfriend and super easy.  But I was not crazy about the dredge or flouring recipe. I think it needed way more spices and salt, especially if one might eat these without the sauce.  I don't know...I really just don't like wings!! Boyfriend liked so I gave it 4 stars.

Exactly like, if not better than, restaurant wings.  We've used peanut oil, and it is fantastic.  We've also used Canola, and I don't like it quite as much.  The flavor of the buffalo sauce is spot on.  Very vinegary and tangy, not burn-your-face-off hot, though easily modified to be that way if you desire.  This recipe is perfection.

Wings were delicious.  My only change was to season the wings after drying them and before adding the flour, and adding powder garlic, onion and black pepper  to the flour.I also only placed it the fridge uncovered for half an hour.  Super crispy, will make again.  Thanks for the recipe.
Edit: 2/4/18: made them again, didn't bother drying them, just drenched in flour mixture Andrea they were super crispy. Added extra salt, cayenne to flour. Added cayenne and some habanero sauce to hot sauce.

I'm not exactly a buffalo wing connoisseur but this is a great recipe! They are very tasty and not too hot. You can adjust the heat by adding less or more hot sauce. I use Franks! I like them mild so I use a little less and substitute with BBQ sauce...just adds a little extra flavor.

Perfect!  My fryer cooked them in 8 minutes at 375.  Sauce is just right with just the right amount of zing.  I did soak the wings overnight in buttermilk, and laid on paper towels to remove the excess before coating and putting int he fridge for a couple hours.

I made this recipe, doubling the paprika and cayenne. I let them rest in the refrigerator for an hour on a rack that was set over a lasagna style pan before I fried them. I did not cover them. These wings tasted exactly like any I have had at any good restaurant/bar around here that serves wings! I highly recommend this recipe and I will definitely be making these again.

I just used this recipe tonight and my family loved it!  I slightly changed the directions and also added garlic powder on the flour mixture.  I doubled the recommended amount of flour, paprika, cayenne pepper, salt, plus garlic powder.  Instead of sprinkling, I dipped the wings on the flour mixture for full coating; did not refrigerate as recommended and proceeded to fry the wings. It was delicious!  I'm definitely using the recipe again!

The first time I made these wings, my family LOVED it. This is one of the recipes I've made over and over again. I am concerned about frying it, but after reading the reviews, they say that baking is just as good. I'll try it baked.

Great wings.  As good as the ones at my favorite wing restaurant and much cheaper (assuming you have most of the ingredients).

Awesome! This was my first time making home made wings and they were great!! Very simple, tasty, great basic wing lets you sauce them up as desired. My husband couldn't get enough of them. Only thing I did differently was I dipped them in the flour mix a second time after refrigerating them. I used a heavy skillet and they cooked about 10min and were perfect. Delicious...definitely making again! Soon!!

I Loved The Sauce!!!...If I Could Do Anything Different I Would Make More Sauce & The Chicken Itself Didn't Really Have Enough Flavor To It, Without The Sauce. But Other That That, This Was A Fun & Tasty Dish To Cook!

These wings are awesome! I made them for Super Bowl Sunday and my son's birthday party, they were at hit! Followed recipe exactly and they turned out perfect, great flavor and crunch....I used only the drumstick portion of wing and Frank's Red Hot cayenne pepper wing sauce for tossing

These wings are the perfect crispiness! I cannot taste the spices from the flour mix and I used my own dip/sauce (mayo, chilli powder, paprika, garlic, ginger and curry powder). I am sure any dip or sauce would work great with these. Only 4 rating because I did not make (taste) the sauce and the spices did not show after cooking.

I used all the ingredients in the listed quantities but baked my chicken.  It tasted great and didn't lose anything despite not frying.  Also, I've never understood why buffalo style chicken is relegated to the lowly wing.  I used drumsticks.  Way better, way more meat, way less fat.  This recipe is about as easy as it gets with a big reward!

I am a wing addict and I am veeeery picky about them too. This recipe is God send! I made these for the Super Bowl and had to call family over on Monday just so I could make more. That's how AMAZING these wings are. If you like crunchy, juicy, perfectly seasoned wings this is your recipe. BTW the last 3 wings of the humongous batch I made on Sunday sat covered in sauce for over one hour and they were still crunchy when I finally killed them.

Made them exactly as written and wouldn't change a thing other than the frying part. Made a huge mess! I'm going to try baking them next time per some other reviewer's suggestions. I must say, though, if they're not as good as the fried ones....I would totally make them again and clean it up. Yummy!

I made these for Super Bowl sunday and they came out fantastic!!! I baked half of my wings and fried the other half and have to say i liked the baked ones better , i also used Franks red hot buffalo wing sauce and also the sweet and spicy sauce and both were awesome.  Thanks for the great recipe.

Amazing recipe. I use the recipe to make boneless chicken wings. After coating the chicken with the wing sauce I put it in the oven for about 10 or so minutes at 350. I only use half of the butter since I like my wings a bit spicier. I have also used this recipe to make chicken wing burgers.

Awesome wings.  I didn't have any paprika or cayenne pepper so I used cajun seasoning.  It was wonderful.  Thanks for a great recipe.  Now I get to be the star of Super Bowl Sunday!

I haven't really tried any other wing recipe on this site because this one was so good.  No changes need, but definitely need to follow the directions when it says to put in fridge for 60-90min.  I prefer these wings over any wing restaraunt we have here.  I haven't found any that are better, well, maybe my husbands on the grill  :)  YUM! Easy to make as well!

Made as suggested except I had to speed the "rest" time as kids had hockey. Definitely a difference between the texture of the later cooked ones to the first ones cooked(least rest time). Next time I will make sure I have the time to allow the wings to sit. Really good!

I used Franks Red Hot hot sauce for half the batch and teriyaki sauce mixed with a bit of butter for the other.  Both kinds of wings were perfectly cooked, crispy, and delicious.  I will definitely be using this recipe again and again!

Excellent wings! I had never attempted making wings but saw a $2.99 bag (20 wings)when shopping and I figured why not? I searched google and found this recipe. I followed the directions as stated with two exceptions. First, I like my wings hot so I used more hot sauce than stated and I used Franks regular not the buffalo wing sauce. Second, since I live in sunny Arizona I used my gas grill. I had some left over aluminum foil pans (%0.99) and spread them out and cooked at about 450 degrees for 35 minutes and flipped them over once midway through. I highly recommend this recipe. My son and I ate for under 5 dollars. I will be making them again in 2 weeks for my super bowl party.

I had never done chicken wings before when I decided to try this recipe because of the rave reviews. I am adding my own rave review with 5 stars!
These came out better than all the take outs we've had around our home, and better than or equal to what we've had out at a restaurant. When and if the mood stikes me again (I don't often fry anything)I shall use this same reciepe just as it is. Hubby and adult son thought they were the tops too!

This recipe is absolutely perfect. My husband and I have tried many times unsuccessfully to make restaurant style wings and finally we managed to achieve success! The wings are crispy and delicious.

My husband deep fat frays them in peanut oil before dipping in the sauce, fantastic!  Everyone was raving over them, and we should have made more!

Family all loved this (3 teens, husband and myself). I bought a bag of frozen wings and just defrosted them and then followed the directions. Also just baked them at 400 like others  mentioned, (sprayed them with PAM and flipped them over 1/2 way thru cooking time). the bag I bought was huge so needed to double the sauce.

Awesome!!  I've baked in the oven and deep fried.  Both are wonderful.  Only tip I have is wait tell close to serving time to pour the sauce on.  I put the sauce on too early once and they were a bit soggy.  Still good but would've been better if I had waited. Everyone goes crazy for these wings!  Excellent recipe!  It's a keeper and I'll continue to make.  Thanks!

So easy and super yummy. I might try unsalted butter next time to control how salty the sauce was. I ended up adding some honey to sauce to cut the saltiness and it was yummy.

I doubled the recipe because I have a large family,and they lovvvveeeedddd it!!!! they loved it so much they begged me to make it again the following night and wanted it again the next day and my family usually hates to have chicken two days in a row. I even liked them, because I thought they were going to be super hot, but I used regular hot sauce so it wasnt to hot. this recipe is definately a keeper!!!

I doubled the recipe for my Superbowl party and used regular-sized wings and legs... They were huge and only three at a time would fit in the FryDaddy, but WOW these were good! The guys were impressed at my ambition to make wings from scratch, but I didn't tell them how easy this recipe was to make! I'm a beginner cook, and one you might even call a bit of an 'airhead', but I made this delicious recipe all by myself, and I'll do it again! :)

Made these for a super bowl party, and they were a huge hit. Allowing the flour mixture to get tacky was a great idea. It made the outer coating so light and crunchy when fried. They even stayed crisp after being coverd in the wing sauce. This a real keeper.

Really good, and really like real bar-style buffalo wings. We used a chipotle hot sauce which gave it bit more of a bbq tinged flavor. I felt like the flour mix could have used more spices in it. I will add more cayenne, paprika, and maybe chili powder next time I make this.

These were easy to make, the sauce was great, however, the wings seemed a bit too breaded from the flour mixture, when I mix it all again I will use less flour in the mixture and pat off..

I made this recipe today, one day after the Super Bowl because we had too many other dishes, I just didn't get to it before game time. I ended up buying drumsticks because the grocery store was all out of fresh wings.  So my floured drumsticks sat in the fridge overnight! About 20 hours to be exact before I cooked them for lunch the next day.  They turned out DELICIOUS!!! When I put them in the bag of flour mix, there was a lot of leftover flour on the bottom of the bag (I had doubled the flour mix due to the size of the drum sticks), but by the time I took them out to fry them up the next day, most of the flour had been absorbed into the chicken. These were unbelievably crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside!!!  The drumsticks worked out GREAT! Better than wings because my sons are only 5 and 6 and prefer more meat and less "weird stuff" along with the meat. For the kids I just lightly salted the fried chicken and it was amazing!! They ate a few  pieces each!  For the adults, I followed the sauce recipe except doubled it ( bigger chicken) and added about an 1/8th of a cup of habanero pepper sauce in addition to the cayenne pepper sauce.  I used Frank's hot sauce as that is what I had on hand and really like for wings.  There were nice and hot with the Habanero addition.  Thanks so much for sharing this wonderful recipe and to all of you who put in your 2 cents worth. I will definitely be making this dish again real soon!! And with actual chicken wings next time!!!

Great wings!! I cut chicken breasts into smaller chunks, then baked in the oven at 475 until crispy. My changes are the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars.

If I could give this more than 5 stars, I would! The basic coating and setup (refrigerate for 60-90 mins) is spot on. Thereafter you can cook how you wish, fry or bake; hot sauce or BBQ.  I baked mine and added BBQ on half of them and cooked 5 more minutes. As for the hot wings, I heated up Frank's wing sauce and dipped them into the saucepan and moved them right to the platter.  My guests raved over them and ate every wing!  Thanks for sharing Kelly.

All I can say is "Awesome". This recipe is great. I made these for the Superbowl today and they rocked! I followed the recipe with the only change being to use more Frank's hot sauce. However, I used a large Tupperware container and I apparently had just enough sauce to coat the inside of the container and not much on the wings. I used a basting brush to get the sauce from the container onto the wings. Luckily I was the only one eating these so it worked out OK. Next time I will just make more sauce. One thing I really liked was the crunchy coating after deep frying. These were the best chicken wings I have ever eaten.

we baked these and used the suggestions of amydoll.  I really liked them but my husband thought they were missing something.  you can definitely get away with using less butter.  could use 1/2 less at least!  they weren't very spicy- I would give them 5 stars but because of my hubby we have to go w/ 4!

This recipe lacks to identify what brand of products to use, like which hot sauce is good. I tried it and followed the directions precisely and it turned out nothing like restaurant style wings or Hooters Bentley, aka 911 hot type wings or anything remotely close to it. It tasted like plain fried chicken with hot sauce poured on top of it. Very disappointing, especially since there are so many positive reviews.

Great wings...just be careful not to over cook them or it will make them a bit tough.  I like to make buffaloe wings boneless.

These are pretty good, I think they would have been better for me if we had ate them as soon as they came out of the fryer and were tossed in the sauce.  Instead we waited until they were all cooked and then ate them, by that time they were soggy.  My 13 yr old son who LOVES hot wings didn't like these at all and wouldn't eat them.  Probably would still use this recipe again.

These were the absolute hit of my New Years Day bowl game get together. Everyone raved about them. I felt really good about the final product. I added 1/4 cup more of the hot sauce than the recipe asked for along with two dashes of cayenne. I followed the recipe to a T otherwise, and fried in vegtable oil. Stole the show!! Will make again.

These are delish but hot hot. For something different I take some of the sauce and add BBQ sauce to taste. Then we have original wings that are hot hot, and then my BBQy wings that are kind of sweet and a little hot for those that are not crazy about hot stuff - a great combination and guests love the hot and sweeter combo.

The sauce was pretty good.  I made the mistake of baking them instead of breaking out the deep fryer.   Bad idea unless you don't have a deep fryer.  Baked 7-minutes on each side and broiled for a few minutes.  The texture and taste of the coating was gross.  I will definately fry next time.

Delicious!!  Definitely let the wings sit in the fridge for atleast an hour.  I spooned some of the sauce over the wings and when they all were done poured the rest of the sauce over it all.  We like ours saucy and if you don't do this the sauce gets soaked into the breading.  (not a bad thing though lol)

This was great as it is written.The thing you should do is keep it in the refrigerator for the full 90 min.I deep fried mine in the same grease I had deep fried the turkeys and it was great.

Make sure to refrigerate for 60-90 mins and avoid leaving excess flour mixture on wings during refrigeration. Tastes just like the "restaurant." Made these for me and my girlfriend and we can't get enough.

I baked at 350 for 45 min then sprayed them with Pam, flipped them over and stuck them in again for 5 minutes at 375. They weren't as crispy as I would have liked but they were still yummy. I put BBQ sauce on a lot of them and I favored those over the spicy ones

I tried this, the chicken taste ok, but the sauce taste somewhat off. When you say "hot sauce", is it Tabasco or something else?

One word: AMAZING!!  I made the sauce to make a buffalo chicken salad and it was fantastic.  I love spicy food, the hotter the better, and this was spicy.  My hubby loved it also.  I plan to try and make the wing recipe soon.

These definitely lived up to their name. I followed the recipe exactly so they are too fattening for regular consumption, but they were great for half-time at a football game.

Too bad, the over-powering buttery taste ruined the expected spicy and tangy flavors of Buffalo Chicken wings that I enjoy. Searching for another recipe.

OMG this was easy & we loved it! I couldn't really taste the flavor on the chicken with the seasoning but I like my food with a kick :) The best part was the dipping sauce... my kids loved loved loved it & so did I which was great since they don't too much spicy food... some mac & cheese made this recipe a definite keeper & super easy! Thanks!

I love the Tyson hot wings that come in a bag and so does my mother so we really thought we were going to love these, we were so excited to make them. We followed the recipe exactly and we both agree that these are not going to become our buffalo wings from now on, we are sticking to Tyson for great tasting hot wings. A great disappointment, sad to say.

My husband and I had these for dinner tonight. I baked them rather than frying them and they were still delicious. A little softer than they would have been if fried but both of us thought they were still amazing. We'll definitely make them again.

I thought these were pretty good.  I made mine using boneless chicken breasts cut into strips, in order to add them to a salad.  I did bake them as others suggested, because I have a real problem with frying them in oil.  Not because of health reasons, but because I never seem to do them right.  Either I burn them or they are undercooked, so I try to steer clear.  They turned out a little dry in the oven, moreso than I hoped, but that's probably my fault too as opposed to that of the recipe, since others baked them without problems.  Either I cut my strips too thin or did something wrong with the baking.  I thought the sauce was fantastic.  I used Frank's, and made a little bit more than was called for because I was using a tad more chicken.  The flavor was great, they had a good crunch to them, the perfect amount of spice.  They were sloppier than I wanted for my salad, but seeing as how it's SUPPOSE to be that way, I should've expected it!  I stuck them in the fridge for about 10 minutes hoping that it would keep it from gooping on the salad, but it didn't work.  Still, great taste and a fantastic dinner!

The chicken coated with the flour mixture in the frig is a LIFESAVER. The coating is veryyyyy crispy and I just ate the chicken without the sauce..I will be using the sauce later today for the 49er game. The sauce I used Louisiana Hot Sauce, butter, garlic and extra black pepper.  I will bake them because I like my wings to be on the dryer side..

Great recipe, Kelly.  If you want to make them sweet and tangy (and not hot) just leave out the hot sauce and hot pepper in the sauce and add an equal amount of regular (like Kraft Original) BBQ sauce as butter and THOROUGHLY mix together with butter/garlic powder mixture.  But I like the original recipe so much!

I cant believe I made these at home.  They are sooo much better than any hot wing I ever had.  I adjusted the seasoning to my taste and did not have time to let the flour sit but it was still great.  Next time a might double the sauce cause it was awesome.

Made exactly as described. They were very good, although I have never had them in the restaurant, so I have nothing to compare them against. The dipping sauce was good, although obviously loaded with calories. Well, the whole dish is! Next time, I will bake the wings, I don't think the deep frying added any crispiness, and baking would be less messy.

Sauce was great but wings got mushy once I added the sauce. Will try to bake after adding the sauce next time.

The absolute best I have ever eaten. Used our home-made Hot Sauce. Surprised at the crispiness even after tossing in the sauce.

My college kid who works at BW3's (a wing place)as a cook  said these were even better than what he makes there. Nice and crispy crust. I did add more hot sauce and used Franks brand.

I tried baking them and added garlic and onion powder to the flour mixture. We used fresh wings and they were much better than the frozen wings...much juicier. Used the bake for 25 minutes, turn, bake another 25 like another poster suggested. Yum yum  and far healthier than frying

The sauce is awesome. We love wings at our house and it was perfect. HOWEVER, we like boneless wings so I tried to use cut up chicken pieces instead of the traditional wings...not good. The chicken was over cooked and chewy. That is my fault. I will forsure use this sauce again though!

We weren't crazy about the sauce the first time we made these, so I cheated after that and just used Frank's Buffalo Wing Sauce with added butter, but still used the cooking method of this recipe and it was much more tasty.

I thought this recipe was ok. I would make it again but not one of my favorites on here. I did not change anything and found it to be slightly greasy and not spicy enough for me personaly. Next time Ill just put the sauce on the side and season my chicken a bit more.

These wings were great. I never changed a thing and cooked them in a deep fryer. Next time I make them I will wait to put the sauce on until right before we eat them. I added it a little too early last time and lost some of the crispness.

The first time I made this the flour and chicken made a horridly sticky mess in the bowl so I foiled & sprayed a casserole dish, used a plastic bag to put the flour mix in and dropped the chicken strips (I used chicken breasts about 4 of them cut into strips) one at a time into to make sure they were coated and lined them up in the dish, covered it overnight and took them out to bake them (someone had suggested that, but they didn't turn out crispy...I will try to fry next time). This helped reduce the amount of clean up in the kitchen. I also kicked the spice up some by adding some crushed red pepper and a small amount of crushed habreno into the flour mix and into the sauce itself. It brought enough heat to please my dad (the buffalo wing critic) and my boyfriend. Thanks for the recipe!

I used Frank's Buffalo Sauce, so didn't need the spices besides the salt & pepper. I also baked at 400 for 1 hour (as per Frank's instructions) and it was delicious!I gave it 4 stars simply because all you need is Frank's!

I Love these buffalo wings, so delicious. I made them once before using land o lakes butter which gave them a greater flavor.I made 24 pieces with same seasoning amount, just added more sauce. Next time I will not use as much salt. I also baked them after coating them with the sauce. Thanks Ateyaa  (from youtube)& Kelly!

Let me set everyone straight- These are "restaurant style" wings, not "original". They taste exactly like chain restaurants make them. Some people love them. I'm from Buffalo and we like this kind too!

The taste of these wings were excellent, however, I found the texture wierd. I think there was too much flour for the amount of wings as they had a flour-y texture after cooking even though I used 24 wings instead of 10 with the same amount of flour mixture. I did bake them though, so that may have changed it. I'm trying them again tonight with less flour. But even with the texture, they were still the best wings I've ever had. Thank you! *Update* With less flour these rock! They are the PERFECT chicken wing!

This is a "keeper" and so easy.  I baked mine on a rack over the jellyroll pan which was recommended by another reviewer.  Worked great!  I used Frank's hot sauce, easy to find in grocery stores.  I will definitely make this recipe again.

This is the only recipe I use for wings now. I will never "order out" for wings again. In my house we cook all the wings with the seasoning recipe but then because of different prefered heat levels we make the sauce to taste adjusting the hot sauce to butter ratio. Thank you so much for this recipe.

I actually used did not bread my chicken and only used the sauce from this recipe, by my husband and I loved it!  The sauce is perfect, just the right flavor to curve the wing craving!  I brushed the sauce over some chicken hind quarters and baked them in the oven.  I then reserved the extra sauce for dipping.  Yum!

I tried this recipe as apposed to just frying the wings plain and I discovered that I like the breaded wing with a coating of honey barbecue sauce and un-breaded wings with hot sauce. The breading was perfect though.

I have made this MANY times! I only use the hot sauce & butter & garlic. We find that plenty spicy enough. I also add some sugar to help tone down some of the spice ( for my boys). Always use Louisianna hot sauce.
I dont have a fryer so I just bake the wings, get them crispy, add the sauce & bake some more.
I always serve them with frozen french fries...we like our "saucy fries"!

Oh YUM!  Loved them!  I fried them in small batches in my fry daddy, and kept the oven at 250 to keep the ones done warm.  Each batch of 8 wings took 10 minutes in the deep fryer.  When the 2nd to last batch was in the fryer, I made the sauce.  Used Franks Red Hot, although I think the next time I will use a little hotter sauce.  Breading was crunchy, and delicious.  I actually breaded the wings, and put them in the fridge for about 5 hours before frying them off.  Wonderful recipe.  Thank you!

If you don't mind eating fried food, these are really great. I was surprised at how good the simple sauce tasted, too. I didn't realize hot sauce mixed with a lot of butter could taste so good. Just not the healthiest thing. haha. I have made them a few times now, and they've turned out well each time.

Excellent. Better than most restaurants. I made a few hundred of them for a large party and everyone raved. Can't wait to make them again so I can enjoy them myself. All I got was a taste!

These are the best wings I ever had. I deep fried them in batches then put them on paper towel to absorb the grease. I then put them in the oven on the keep warm setting until all the batches were cooked. I added the sauce to them when all the batches were done and they were not greasey at all. Now all I have to do is have some self control so I'm not making them every other day!

This is a great recipe!  I just have a few recommendations for the sauce: I used crystal's hot sauce, Tabasco, and Louisiana hot sauce.  Only a small amount of Tabasco because it does pack a punch!  I added flour to the sauce to thicken it because my family prefers to dip their wings rather than toss them in the sauce

Oh my God...EXCELLENT!!! I love wings but hate going out to buy them. This recipe was awesome. Took the advice on baking cuz I hate fried stuff. And DEFINITELY don't skip the fridge step!! Sauce wasn't hot enough for me though so I'll look through the stores for somethin to spice it up.

Really good.  I made these for the Superbowl.  I popped them in the oven a few days later and they were crispier so next time I may try to put them in the oven after frying.

Restaurant quality...I don't think so.  Not bad, but not the greatest.  The sauce was way too intense for all of our tastes.  We'll go back to TGI Friday's for our wings.

These were easy to make and went super fast at my Superbowl party.  Everyone loved them, at least everyone who likes hot food.  I baked them instead of frying them to make them just a little healthier.  No one noticed they weren't fried.  They were preferred over the wings someone even brought to the party.

These were great. I used 13 whole wings which took 1 cup of hot sauce and half a cup of butter. Very good. I will definitely make these again.

Definitely a 5 star recipe!! I used this recipe to make buffalo wings for the first time ever and these were such a hit! I tried one batch without the flour coating and one batch with it. The flour coating definitely makes a difference - it makes them more crispy.  This will be my official wing recipe from now on!

Absolutely wonderful! I made these for my SuperBowl party. I should have made the whole ten pound bag I bought! I made some buffalo wings and some bbq wings. After I put the sauce on them I popped them in the oven for 5-10 min at 350. So good!!

this was too "skinny" and too "fatty" for us to like.  next time, i am going to cut boneless, skinless, chicken breasts into chunks and do the same recipe, and I think it'll be absolutely fabulous.  i bought "wings" for this recipe, and regretted it.  stick with the higher quality meats if you are used to that!

OMG these wings were out of this world...did not change one thing. I made them for the Big Game night and they were gone in a flash. Everyone wanted to know how to make them. Thanks for the recipe.

Made the breading as directed and oven baked it for 45 minutes at 350, per another reviewer's suggestions. Absolutely outstanding crispy texture. Kids and adults loved it!

Great flavor!  I used chicken tenders rather than wings and baked for low fat.  Don't skip the refrigeration!  I sprayed my non-stick skillet with Pam and very lightly browned, then put in a 350 oven for about 15 minutes.  After backing returned to the skillet and poured the sauce all over it and stirred just to heat through.  Came out perfect and served with low fat bleu cheese salad dressing.

These wings were fantastic.  My wife who is not a huge wing lover even ate a dozen or so.  The sauce isn't overly hot, but all you have to do is a few extra dashes of Tabasco and you'll be good.  Great wings, very easy and very tasty.

I've made this twice in the last week. The first time I was impatient and only put the beaded wings in the fridge for 40 minutes. After reading the other reviews, I made sure to let them set the full 90 minutes, so that they could get sticky. They were awesome both times, but they were the best when I let them set the full 90. I used Frank's Original Red Hot Sauce and doubled the amount of cayenne pepper because we like them hot. I made a much bigger batch of the breaded wings the second time so I ended up testing out another sauce of 1/4 cup Bill Johnson's Hot & Spicy Barbeque sauce with 2 tbls. honey  for 6 wings and those were really good too.

These are awesome!! I'd rather eat these than any I have had at any restaurant. They are crispy and delicious. I added a little extra garlic powder to my sauce. Also, the recipe says to use 10 wings, but we used the wingettes and drumettes. So, we were able to make 20 or more wings.

I just finished making this for my boyfriend and I. It was my 1st time and I must say, it tasted amazing. For the hot sauce I used Thai sweet chili sauce and a bit of tabasco. Then used ranch for a dipping sauce. We usually go out every once in awhile for some wings and beers, but now we can just do this at home and it tastes better. I've tried other recipes for wings, and this is by far the best one. I'm definitely going to make them again.

We loved it. I did bake them first for about 20 min @ 375 then I fried them it was easier that way, I also added the pepper to the sauce just to get it a little more spicier. But it was great and it is so easy to make a big amount. I do recommend this very much.

I'm not the biggest fan of buffalo wings, in the least. But with watching football at local bars more often this season, I got reacquainted with them. These are SOOOOO much better than most that I've tried, and I feel better eating them since I know that its not some random, pre-made manufactured sauce.

By far the very best wings. Use the chicken without the sauce for a base for other flavors...chipotle, honey-mustard, etc.

Excellent.  They do taste restaurant quality.  I like my wings "hot and honey" so I added a 1/4 c of honey to the sauce while in the sauce pan for blending.  Also, I lightly drizzled honey on the wings right before pouring the sauce over the wings in the final step.

I have made these 3 times and they have turned out perfectly each time.  Instead of using the buffalo sauce, we do lemon pepper since it's our households favorite.  Crispy and delicious just like our favorite wing place!

I too do not possess a deep fryer so as others suggested, I baked.  However, I did pan fry the wings (I actually used drummettes) for about 15 minutes in olive oil, then battered them, refrig'd for about 90 mins, then baked for 45 @ 350, and finally added the sauce.  these babies were HOT!  They don't seem like it at first but it catches you by surprise!  anyway, 4 out of 5 because its not perfect, but  good!

I failed this recipe- should have baked them without the sauce as they did not get crispy enough. If I make them again I will bake first and then put the sauce on!

Yum!  I don't have a fry-o-lator type gadget so I simply used a candy thermometer and fried a little longer than 15 mins as the oil temp decreases significantly when you first put the wings in.  My hubbie is not a huge buffalo wing fan so I made half a batch using this buffalo sauce and half using a jar of barbecue sauce.  Bon appetit!

I liked it, but the waiting was a drag.  I made my own red hot sauce which I have submitted for review.  I also used sweet (aka glutenous) rice flour (in your Chinese Food Section) which is very sticky and an gluten free option fpr those with a wheat allergy.  Over all good, but the time delay is a hassle.

These are awesome!!  I have tried many recipes, this is now the number 1 favorite!  I have also made these without having them sit in the flour mixture, due to shortness of time & they were still awesome! With a homemade blue cheese dressing....unbelievable!!

I love this recipe! It is not too hot but just right.  The only change is that I use party wings because it is faster and you can use it if you are serving a large party.  With that in mind, you will have to make more of the sauce.  The same way it is directed.  This recipe should win an award!

OK, I have made these 4 times and everyone that has had some begs me for more!  I make these and use the fast and easy chip dip.  Perfect recipe.  I used Texas Pete for the hot sauce and it was perfect!!

This had an overall good flavor. I didn't fry it in hopes to keep it somewhat healthy. I think I will fry it next time because it tasted a little floury. I also cooked more than 10 wings, I used breast cutlets instead, so next time I will use more sauce as well.

All I can say is OMG, These are so freaking good! We made them for dinner tonight, and they are the best wings we've ever had! We went and bought just the small chicken wing drummies (not enough meat for us on the dinky wings)! I followed the recipe to the letter, and everyone told me I should of made more, but I didnt have anymore hot sauce so I used BBQ sauce. Just melted some butter in with it, and did exactly the same thing, it got rave reviews in a house of picky eaters! It's going in the recipe box for sure!!!!!

I made this 3 times for my hubby. The first time wasn't hot enough so I added more hot sauce & cayenne pepper. Now it had some kick! Also, I used chicken tenderloins & I baked them on a rack covering them first in the hot sauce mixture & broil them for a few minutes to crisp them. This one is a winner!

This is the best recipe I have ever tried for hot wings.  I add more hot sauce though. The wings are even better the next day either hot or cold.

My husband orders wings whenever he can, so I finally broke down and let him buy a fryer. I'm terrified of frying food, so I helped him get the breading ready and mix the sauce up, but left the actual frying up to him He's not an experienced cook, but he still did pretty well. His only complaint was that he wanted the wings to be spicier. Hubby will probably make these again, but he'll add more seasoning to the breading and use more hot sauce.

The whole family loved these! Next time I will double the sauce. I used more chicken than the recipe suggested, so coated the extras in BBQ sauce. We all liked the Buffalo ones the best! Both were nice and crispy!

Thanks for sharing this great recipe.

I make this recipe so often. My fiancee loves it!! It really is key to let the spiced floured chicken sit in the fridge before frying. 

I usually make this boneless. I just use chicken breasts. I fliet them out a bit to thin them out and just follow the recipe as usual. However, it is nice using the traditional wings once in a while!

I made these last night and they were great. I tried baking them to be a little healthier, but there was some flour still left dry. So I deep-fried for about 2 min to crisp them up. Awesome recipe otherwise.

These were delicious!  I used Tapatio hot sauce and added a few hits of Tabasco which was the perfect heat for my husband and I.  The only bad thing about this recipe is the fat content!  I may try baking them next time to decrease the fat content and the mess.

These turned out great!  Not too spicy or tangy.  I also tried to make a slightly healthier version like one of the other reviewers.  I used bonless, skinless chicken breast, cubed and then I put about 1/4 cup of vegetable oil in a pan with some Pam spray for cooking.

WOW!  These wings were AWESOME!  Our usual wing joint has officially lost our business.  I plan on adding this to our meal schedule at least once a week!  My husband isn't huge on wings, so I plan to try them using chicken tender strips for him.  Can't wait to see how that turns out.

The best! Although I do add triple the hot sauce to make them spicy enough! I love that they are crunchy and NOT soggy. Next time I will try to bake them.

This recipe is fantastic.  My husband loves wings but hates to eat around the tiny bones.  I just cut up boneless skineless chicken breast into bite size pieces. My husband loved it...I would definetely make these again.

What can you say ? It's a pot of vegetable oil and wings deep fried in that oil. Once a year maybe...good recipe for a group; watch that the wings are not overcooked in the vat of hot oil (20 mins...give or take)

Very crispy without frying! Placed rack on baking pan and baked wings for 30 min at 400 degrees pure convection, then turned and baked additional 20 min until golden brown. I will make some changes to the sauce to make it spicier, but all in all much better than store bought and most restaurants!

Made these for the Super Bowl party and they were a hit.
I don't have a deep fryer, but I do have a non-stick large wok, so I used that instead.
Easy to prepare, will make again.

I haven't had restaurant chicken wings much, but my husband has, and he said these were Great!  I loved the way they were crispy and oh so juicy inside.  The hot sauce was just right--didn't burn my mouth at all.  I had troubles finding the wings in the store.  I finally found them in the freezer section only.

These are absolutely the best chicken wings I have ever had.  I don't even like chicken wings at restaurants.  I made these for Super Bowl party and then ended making them again the following weekend b/c they were so delicious.  Definitely let the wings set in the fridge to get sticky before cooking.  I baked @ 400 for 40 minutes, sprayed w/ cooking spray and then broiled for 5 min.  I used Texas Pete for the hot sauce.  I also made a mix of spicy bbq as another review suggested and it was delicious.  Great to have 2 wing flavors.  MAKE THESE WINGS you will not be disappointed!

These wings were absolutely yummy!  I changed the butter to 1/4 cup instead and I oven fried them. If you melt some crisco on the bottom of a pan and cook the wings at 400 degrees for about 50 minutes then I covered with the sauce.  delicious!!!

This recipe is amazing!  It looks complicated, but is really simple.  I followed Amydoll's suggestion for baking them instead of frying and I added a little chili powder to both trhe sauce and the breading, it worked beautifully!  I actually am a vegetarian so they were made for my husband and some friends and they were an instant hit!  Someone else had made wings for the party and people were coming up to me saying "I didn't want to say this in front of him, but your wings were much better than his."  I plan on using variations on the recipes for chicken thighs and drumsticks, and this is the only recipe I'll use for Buffalo Wings - which says a lot coming from a Buffalonian : )

I tried this lab with my students at school in honor of the Superbowl. Some kids really liked them and some didn't. I tried one wing. You have to understand that trying food from inexperienced cooks can be dangerous. Smile now. Anyhow, the children did a good job on them and personally I found them very tasty. We had limited time to let them sit in the fridge and also to sit in the sauce, which I think would have added to the flavor to "sit". We are doing them again this marking period.

Simply the best! We can't believe how wonderful it turned out,finger lickin good indeed! I still had some flour mixture left so instead of throwing it away, I ended up using it and floured some medium sized shrimps (with its head and shells on)and deep fried them on the same oil.Scrumptious! This'll be a keeper! Thanks!

Yes, everybody is right, these wings were delicous.  It's the first time that I've made them homemade and I was so plesantly surspised that I could make them taste so good.  We had a friend over for dinner, they were certainly no embarassment. But of course it was not me, just a terrific recipe.  All I did was follow the directions. Thanks for posting the recipe. I also used Bill's blue cheese dressing, will use it when we have friends over again on Friday and just thin it out a little with some milk.for salad.

Great wings recipe.  I also baked (350 for 40 min and 3 min on broil), since I don't own a deep fryer.  They were crispy, flavorful and perfectly cooked.

Great recipe. I made these for the Super Bowl Party and they turned out DELICIOUS. I did deviate from the recipe by seasoning my chicken with seasoned salt before coating with flour. Will definitely make these wings again!

I made these wings last night for my super bowl party and they stole the show. I used the cheap baffalo sauce. I had to use more sauce than butter to kick it up a knotch. I also used a lot more cayenne pepper in both the sauce and the wings. Exellent recipe, better than the restaurant.

This one I gave 4 stars because I didn't exactly follow it, but I think it deserved less. I didn't fry the chicken but did boneless and baked them. The sauce was ok, but nothing spectacular, which is why I gave a 4. May have been better if fried, but I wasn't feeling it.

SO GOOD! I didn't fry mine tho, I baked them in the oven. Also, I kicked up the heat with the seasonings and spices since we like our stuff hot and spicy here. I used a mixture of Crystal brand Louisiana style hot sauce & Frank's X-hot hot sauce. Big hit at superbowl!! WAY TO GO GIANTS!!
*UPDATE* I usually bake these but decided to fry them this past Superbowl. I actually prefer them baked! They came out way too greasy, fried. They have great flavor tho and everyone I know who tries them, loves them!

We tried this recipe on Friday before the Superbowl.  I made half the wings with my usual method of just frying the wings then adding sauce and half this way with the flouring.  In a side by side taste test, these wings won hands down. Both were eaten, mind you but everyone thought these were better. Nice and cripsy. I have just cut and floured 3 dozen wings to fry up in about an hour for pregame festivities.

Wow this is truly restaurant style. There is no reason to change a single thing on this recipe. I will be making 100 of these today for superbowl sunday. I did a test run on these the other night and it was a huge hit.

These are amazing. I have made them three times with the frying method. I am trying the baking method today to be a little more healthy. I like really spicy wings that make your whole head feel hot, so I added more cayenne, a little chilli powder to the flour. Also added more hot sauce and less butter to the sauce. Awesome!

This recipe was okay. I was hoping to get the same look as the picture provided by Allrecipe. I like a crispy skin on my wings and I have to figure out a way to maintain that after adding the sauce. Perhaps I should have baked it a little while longer. Overall I think that it was the wing sauce that I purchased and not so much the flavor of the seasoned flour on the chicken. Will make some changes next time.

These were very good. Not the best I have ever tasted, but still very good. They just seemed like an awful lot of work for the results you get.

I added garlic powder, onion powder, and pepper to the flour and the sauce. I definitely let the floured wings sit in the fridge for at least 90 minutes. I accidentally fried a batch for longer than 15 minutes and they were pretty brown and crispy, but so delicious! I put the sauce on at the very last minute, right before serving. Served with cut up celery and carrots with ranch, blue cheese, and honey mustard dip. My fiance and I loved it! Thanks for the great recipe!

We love these wings! My friend, who runs her own restaurant told me she uses this exact same recipe for sauce, and she is known for her great wings. Baked or fried, these are good either way. For the best wing experience, please try these with Bill's Blue Cheese Dressing from this site. Thanks for the recipe!

I bought a deep fryer at Kohls post Thanksgiving sale and needed something to test it out with.  This recipe was wonderful!  It was the first time I made "wings" and they turned out perfect!  I actually used chicken tenders and fried them for 8-10 minutes.  I served them with ranch dressing for dipping.  I'm going to try a different sauce to top them with next time since my boyfriend isn't crazy about hot sauce (although I loved the franks hot sauce mix).  Oh and I cooked the hot sauce and butter with a clove of garlic cut up since i didn't have any garlic seasoning.  It worked great! YUM

This was so good! Definetly a keeper.  I won't have to buy frozen-premade buffalo wings anymore.  Followed the direction to the T! I have to double sauce because I have more chicken wings than suggested.

Because of lack of time, I had to cook the chicken as soon as I put the flour mixture on.  Other comments said that it was the key step.  These were great!  I can't wait to follow the exact directions if it gets better than this!

These were very good.  If you like any kind of spice, this needs more spice.  I deep fried, but wish I had baked for the simple reason of clean up! And lasting odor in the house.  I could only fry about 4-5 wings at a time due to the size of my deep fryer so it was rather time consuming.  Overall, good!

I used chicken breast sliced into tenders, the flour didn't stick very well so I dipped in egg and then flour again. I used Louisiana Hot Sauce and the flavor of the hot sauce was almost too strong, so next time I'll try Franks Hot Sauce and use 2/3 cup butter to 1/3 cup hot sauce.

Great wings!  Were crispy and the flour covering held in place perfectly after I let them chill for 90 minutes.  The wings were done in 7 minutes when cooked in the deep fryer at the temp specified in the recipe so keep an eye on them.  I used Hooters hotwing sauce and it was good but next time I will try the hot sauce recommended in this recipe.  I made 5 batches of these for a party and they were a HUGE hit!  Thanks!

These were awesome. Great taste, just enough spice! I didn't refrigerate because I didn't read all the steps through until cooking time and didn't have time to be waiting for 2-3 hours, they still turned out great!

WOW!  This was fairly easy and super delicious!  It was my first attempt at making wings, and it won't be my last.  They were excellent!  The longer they 'soak' in the sauce, the better they get!

I thought these came out WAYY too spicy. I didn't even use the recommended amount of hot sauce. I used regular Tabasco--maybe I should have used a milder hot sauce?? Baking them rather than deep frying them was a great idea and the wings were delicious and super tender with alot less fat. I'll try these again with milder hot sauce and I imagine they'll be amazing.

EXCELLENT!!!! I'd planned to make these for a while before I did. I went to buy a deep fryer to make them so that I wouldn't catch the kitchen (or myself) on fire trying to fry them in a skillet! I love it! The fryer and the wings! They were SO CRISPY!!!! I will be making them again tonight. The only thing I will change is I will be adding a little bit more of the garlic powder to the sauce. I would like to try to bake them one day since meny people recommend it, but I don't have the time tonight. Frying them is SOOO FAST! Besides the hour they take to sit in the fridge, this is a mega fast appitizer/meal! Highly recommended! ENJOY!!

This recipe is awesome. So simple, so delicious! I can't get enough of these wings! Although, I did bake the chicken instead of frying (it was still pretty crispy). Soooo good! I am 5 months pregnant and have been craving wings so this is a great, easy, cost effective way to have them often! And better for me too since I can use better quality ingredients and bake it instead of frying! So delicious! Thank you so much! It's gotten rave reviews from everyone I've made it for too!

My family loves buffalo wings.  I have been looking for a recipe for years.  These taste just like in the restaurant. I will be making them often. I also used Frank's hot sauce and followed the directions to the letter - turned out perfect! Thanks so much for sharing.

These are FANTASTIC!!!  Breading them before frying makes all the difference.  I use Frank's Red Hot and a little butter to coat them.

These were perfect. Even better than the restaurant ones. My family loved them. I substituted some of the hot sauce with ketchup so they were not as hot. Will make them again. Thanks Kelly.

My husband loves hot wings and we always go to Applebees to eat them...I made these for him for Sunday football and he absolutely loved them...just like at the restaurant, just not quite as spicy!  They work best when the chicken pieces are crispy brown...otherwise they end up a little soggy.  Ours were great!

Maybe I missed the wagon somewhere, but this did not do it for me. My 12 year old loved it but than again anything that he can eat with his hands (that age aaaaaaaaa) he loves. I'll try it again in the near future and see how it is than. Sorry Kelly.

This was just exactly the recipe I was looking for. I used thighs instead of wings (costs much less) and tripled the sauce.

Made for New Years party.  A little too spicy for everyone.  Didn't make quite saucy enough for our taste.  Not sweet enough.

I used my own wing sauce, and it turned out great.  I always baked them before, but now I will follow this recipe for the coating and then fry them up.

I will definitly make this my new hot wing recipe. Everyone loved them. Even my kids, and they were pretty hot. My hubby said they made his lips tingle. It is the breading that makes these so good. I did not use the sauce here. I split the difference and got a bottle of Texas Pete's Buffalo Wing Sauce and Franks Buffalo Wing Sauce and then added about 4 Tablespoons of Franks Red Hot. You can definitly make these to your own preference. I made about 60 wings!

I have been in search of a Hot Wing recipe and this is the one!  So yummy and super easy to make 10 or 30.  I may adjust the butter to hot sauce ratio to make a little hotter.  I'd say these were mild/medium.  Franks is definitely my hot sauce of choice.

Wonderful recipe for chicken wings!  I made them just as described and everyone loved them.  They were just as good, or better, than restaurant chicken wings.  I made 35 chicken wings for $5!!

The crunchy stuff was excellent, but the sauce was horrible...maybe it is because I used Tobasco instead of Red Hot or something.
