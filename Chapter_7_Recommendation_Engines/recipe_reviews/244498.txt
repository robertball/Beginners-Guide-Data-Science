This was very quick and easy--perfect for a weeknight meal. Other ingredients would be really good in this--black olives mushrooms and green pepper would put it over the top! And extra cheese. Yum!

Easy and quick meal. My husband thought it was great I thought a little plain. I will make it again however I will be changing the cheese to a mozzarella (more pizza like) and adding either green peppers or mushrooms.

I'm going to have to agree with jrbaker above: it is too plain the way it is. I paired it with Chicken Cacciatore & used some of the sauce to dip each bite into. & it was perfect! But like th erectile is now it's just too plain. I do love the new Pronto pasta though. So simple to use.
