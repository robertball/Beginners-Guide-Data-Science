I made this sauce a day before Thanksgiving and it was delicious. On the next day when I try it was very bitter taste from the skin of an orange. I will not recommend to add the orange with the rind, but get rid of the white part from the rind and maybe it will improve the bitterness.

I think this recipe is great.  The consistency is kind of like applesauce, so after I was done I chopped 1/4 more of an apple and some pecans really small and mixed in to give it a little more bite.  Thanks for the recipe, delicious!

Very good recipe!  I do omit the apple out of personal preference.  I also make a point of cutting out the white pith from the orange.

Not often do I give five stars, but this relish is deserving.  I love how simple it is, no need to cook.  I made as stated in the recipe, but after a few pulses on my Cuisinart, I took about a cup out and pulsed the rest to make finer. Adding the coarser chopped back in give it nice texture. I made to serve with turkey, but had to give it a try on crackers and cream cheese as a snack.  Donâ€™t skip the pecans!

I would definitely not add the whole orange again and I'd add more sugar.  It was quite bitter.  However, I like the idea of not cooking it so I will give it another try at some point.
