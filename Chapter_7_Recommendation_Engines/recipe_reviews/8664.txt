This is absolutely delicious!!! I received so many compliments on my cooking by making this dish. I cut chicken breast (with bone and skin) in half and I don't measure the white pepper. I seasoned the chicken with the white pepper first and set it aside while I prepared the other ingredients. In order to peel the garlic easier, I boiled water in a sauce pan and dropped the heads of garlic into the water and let it sit for 1 minute. Then I removed the garlic and peeled it. This is a wonderful recipe!!! Excellent!!!

Totally overpowering.  No matter what the author of this recipe may say, the amount of garlic used is immense.  Unless you are a chain smoker your taste buds will be utterly devastated by this recipe.  I made it for myself to test it out and almost had to throw the thing out, the flavor was so overpowering.  Cutting the amount of garlic in half may work, however, the overall dish would be nothing special.  Don;t expect this one to be the cure-all for your left-over thigh blues.

My daughter and I both really liked this.  My husband thought the combination of spices was too weird though so I probably won't be making this one again.

Dangerous combination: Way too much salt and yet, not a lot of flavor! I'm not even sure what to recommend to make it better.

Excellent! The best recipe I have found for using chicken legs. I pulled the skin off of the legs before cooking. I also used only about 20 cloves of garlic instead of the 50. Turned out tender, flavorful and smelled great cooking. Will make it again.

The combination of spices was a little to strange for me I guess.  The amount of garlic was fine, but the cinnamon, tarragon, and wine was an unpleasant mix of flavors.  I will not make this again.

Good point-it was very tender.  However it was not really garlic-y and not very flavorful. If I were to ever make it again, I'd definately add more spices.  I served it to company, and they compared it to simple stewed chicken--what you get before you flavor it and start making the chicken and dumplings, soup or etc.

I made this recipe in a 9 x 13 pan instead of a pot.  It turned out excellent.  Your friends may complain about the state of your breath but that's a small price to pay.

This dish is edible, but I did not like it at all. For a recipe that should have so much flavor, it lacks a lot! I thought the recipe would have more of a roasted garlic taste.But mine was a bitter, pungent garlic taste. We are garlic lover's, that's why I tried the recipe. But this is not what I had hoped it would be. As far as appearance, I would not serve this to company! It took some coaching even to get my kids to try it. They said it was okay, but "Don't make this again."

Excellent!  We found the blend of flavors to be very good.  I added some lemon juice.

I'm giving this 5 stars even though I modified it. I used a whole chicken, cut up, skin removed. I mostly doubled the spices but kept the amount of oil and wine about the same. The aroma was amazing, and the flavor was perfect. My only regret was that I only had brown rice on hand--really wished I had a baguette to sop up the sauce. Also, to the reviewers saying the garlic was overpowering: why did you try a recipe that calls for 50 cloves of garlic if you're sensitive to the taste? I didn't find it overwhelming at all, but I love these kinds of French dishes in which garlic is cooked so long, it mellows to a rich, slightly sweet flavor.

Succulent and delicious! The only change I made was to use boneless skinless chicken breasts, which worked out great.
