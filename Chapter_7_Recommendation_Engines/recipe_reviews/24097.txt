FABULOUS!!! Made this for Thanksgiving yesterday, specifically for my mother-in-law, who claims to be pumpkin pie connoisseur. She said it was EXCELLENT, and that it looked like a professional bakery pie! GOOD INFO TO KNOW: Most important - MELT THE ICE CREAM IN THE MICROWAVE UNTIL IT'S *WARM*! This prevents separating. I didn't use room temp eggs (forgot). Don't add flour to thicken - it's really not needed. It will look very runny, but have faith  :o)  I cut the sugar to 1/2 cup. I didn't add vanilla, but will do so in the future. I used pumpkin pie spice instead of using separate spices, but still used cinnamon separately as well - and added a bit extra. The recipe WILL fill two 9" reg. depth pie crusts - do NOT fill to very top and they'll be fine. Filling will take a total of *1 full hour* AFTER the initial 15 minutes. BE SURE TO COVER YOUR CRUSTS WITH FOIL!!! I forgot, and they almost burned in the first 15 min. phase. Filling will "poof up" almost 2 inches above crust during baking and settle back down during cooling. Do not "STIR" pie!!! Not needed - have faith!  :o) I will definitely make this a Thanksgiving favorite!

Very good, different, and easy to make.  One suggestion: Make sure the eggs and the ice cream are at the room temperature. I even melt the ice cream in the microwave (just until it was a bit warm, not bubbling hot.  I think this may help preventing the pie from seperating into layers.  Oh, and serve a slice with the leftover vanilla ice cream.  They go really good together!

This recipe is AWESOME. It's been a HUGE hit at event I brought it to. 
One pointer: Without fail everytime I've made this pie it has seperated while baking. A trick that I found works for me is after it has finished baking (about 35 mins) take it out of the oven and stir the pie in the crust. Be carful not to brake the crust on the bottom and sides. then cover only the exposed crust with foil (So it doesn't burn) then put it back in the oven for another 20 mins. It's great with home made whip cream YUM!

I followed the directions SO carefully, but the ice cream separated out to form a white layer on the bottom, while the pumpkin layer on top was very eggy and "bubbly". Not the thick creamy pie i was hoping for.

This will be the second year that I have made this pie, I use vanilla ice cream made with splenda and I use the splenda instead of sugar, because my husband is diabetic and he can then enjoy his pie without feeling remorse. I use Mom's recipe for home made crust and it makes the BEST pumpkin pies! Word of warning, I do not use my deep pie dish because it does not want to set up as well, use a regular pie pan for this recipe and you will have no problems at all ~ enjoy!

This was the first pie I have ever made in my life! And with fresh pumpkin too. It was very easy to make even for a first time novice, and the result turned out great! I brought one to my kid's school and everybody loved it. They said they have never seen pies go so fast!
I used frozen ready-to-make pie shells from Meijer. For the ice cream I used Bryers Light French Vanilla. I used 1/2 cup of sugar instead of 3/4 cup, since i like it lighter.

This was my first year trying to make a pumpkin pie out of a fresh pumpkin, and I chose this recipe for the ice cream.  But it turned out to be the best pumpkin pie I, or my family and in-laws, had ever had!!  Thank you for making birthdays, Thanksgiving, and Christmas delicious!!!

I've made this pie for the past several years, and have already rated it.  Made it again for Thanksgiving dinner yesterday.  This pie is THE BEST pumpkin pie recipe ever.  My family and friends RAVE about it every year.  For the ice cream, I use Breyers vanilla bean.  I always use canned pumpkin.  The cooking time far exceeds the amount of time given on this recipe - AND the pie always inflates a lot higher in the oven, but settles back down once it cools.  Just wanted to mention these things in case anyone is making this recipe for the first time.  This recipe is a family treasure!

I read all reviews before making this and here's what I changed. 2 cups of vanilla ice cream, 1 tablespoon of pumpkin pie spice, 2 cups canned pumpkin and used refrigerated ready made pie crusts, decreased sugar to 1/2 cup. I also added 3oz. of cream cheese in the filling because I didn't want it TOO fluffy. I microwaved the ice cream and cream cheese together until the bowl felt warm (about 3 mins). This did make TWO 9" pies perfectly. I baked as in the recipe (15 mins, then 40 mins). I was a little worried, as I'm definitely a pumpkin pie lover, which is why I added more spices and pumpkin. It turned out amazing! Just a little sweeter than regular pumpkin pie (not too sweet!), a tad fluffier & creamier but can still taste the pumpkin and spices!! Crust turned out perfect (covered edges with foil til the last 15 mins). I didn't have separation problems or anything, completely perfect! Thanks Cindy!

The pie is good but if you want a pie with a rich pumpkin taste this isn't the recipe for you. I made this for Thanksgiving where everyone loves pumpkin pie and they were somewhat disappointed. I noted that many other veiwers said they don't like pumpkin pie but they liked this. That's because it tastes more like ice cream pie with a hint of pumpkin. Great if that's what you want, but not if you like the pumpkin flavor.

This was awesome once I made a few changes.  I doubled the recipe as we had 22 over for thanksgiving dinner (I'm Canadian so we had ours already).  I also used soy vanilla ice cream because there are a few people in my family who can't have dairy and it worked perfectly.  Lastly I used pumpkin pie spice in place of ginger and nutmeg, but I kept the cinnamon.  I made 1 test pie earlier in the week and only used 1/2tsp of pumpkin pie spice and that wasn't enough.  For the 4 pies I used 1 1/2 tsp and that was perfect.  So glad I now have a dairy free pumpkin pie recipe!

I've made many pumpkin pies and never had one fail like this one.  My husband who eats anything and LOVES pumpkin pie wouldn't touch it after 1 slice.  The icecream flavour is way to strong.  I couldn't taste the pumpkin at all.  Additionally, even after only using half of the called for amount of icecream the leftover pie turned to water by the second day although it set nicely when baking.  If you like the taste of pumpkin - don't use this recipe.

What a hit! My fam loved it so much I had to triple the recipe! (Not to mention I'm expecting a baby and the Holydays are just around the corner.  I need to be prepared!) I baked 4 fresh little pie pumpkins, removed the pulp and pureed it with the egg and spice mixture, less the ice cream, using a food processor. Used 3/4 Tbsp fresh ginger instead of ground ginger. Let that mixture sit overnight so all the flavors could marry. Warmed one full tub and one half tub of 1.5qt vanilla ice cream. Immediately mixed warm ice cream with pumpkin/spice/egg mixture that had been marinating overnight. Poured into pie shells just below the crust and baked 3 pies for one hour. Did that twice, making 6 pies, b/c I tripled the recipe. Pie filling rose 1cm during bake.
I used other reviewers suggestions by covering the crust prior to baking. (Never knew that secret, ...thanks!!) No need to uncover the crust for the last 15min of bake time, it came out perfect!  Left two out to eat and froze the remaining four for Thanksgiving and Christmas. The two pies were gone in two days between the hubs, our 2 daughters, and of course, myself!!!
The ice cream sets this recipe off. I always use fresh pumpkins, there is just no comparison to me. And I love fresh ginger. Brings a freshness to the pie that cannot be duplicated with ground. Next time I might try cinnamon ice cream, as another revier suggested.
Happy Baking!

Wonderful!  1 1/2 pts translates to 3 cups of melted ice cream (I melted it in the microwave).  Used one 15 oz can of pumpkin.  Topped with Cool Whip.

This is the most fabulous pumpkin pie!!  i add a little more cinnamon and a half teaspoon of cloves to make it a little more spicy.  Also, after it's in the oven for about 25 minutes, stirr the filling (mind the crust) Just so the ice cream doesn't separate and the top doesn't crack.  My entire family LOVES this recipe!!

I don't know what happened to the person who's pie separated, but i have used this recipe for years without fail. this is the best pie you will ever make. my family allways wants me to make it for thanksgiving. Its worth the extra time to use real pumkin if you enjoy the texture of real pumkin pie. if not canned tastes the same but a bit smoother. I have tweaked the spices to my taste (added clove and allspice) This pie is always a huge hit, and we have high standards at our house when it comes to pumpkin pie.

This pumpkin pie was way too sweet and had very little pumpkin flavor. The texture was ok but the taste was nothing like traditional pumpkin pie. I will not be making this one again.

Was a great recipe but a little too sweet for me.  Would be wonderful for people who aren't sure about pumpkin.  Fairly simple to make and goes well with a real pie crust made with lard.

Don't like Pumpkin Pie.  Made this for my family on Thanksgiving and everyone went on and on about this pie, so I tried it.  Guess what, I LOVE this pie.  Would not change anything about it.  Thank you Cindy for sharing your recipe.

I have been using this recipe for 4 years now with absolute success!! I've changed the crust over time and have come up with the perfect pie! Year One - Graham Cracker crust = pretty good Year 2 - followed recipe crust = better Year 3 & 4 - melt one stick of butter, mix with plain yellow cake mix - line bottom of casserole dish pour filling for 2 pies over the one dish = NO LEFT OVERS!!! Cover with cool whip and dust with cinnamon   yuuuummmmyyy

Like past reviewers, I too have made this pie years ago. I have made many differant pies by using all the differant flavors of Ice cream. Canned pumpkin works great and the best flavor I have found to be is Butter Pecan. I made for a contest and it won 1st place. For the chocolate nut lovers out here, Rocky Road comes fast in seconed. And for White Chocoloate lovers, Melt some down and mix it in at the end.

Wow! This recipe was fabulous. I didn't read the reviews until after I had made the pie so I didn't know about the problem with it setting - however, I actually made mine in a springform pan and had little trouble! I used the gingersnap crust from another recipe as I have an aversion to pastry and then cooked the pie for an extra 15-20 minutes. It turned out great with absolutely no setting problems - and I would have known when I released the springform pan!

Before I made this, I wanted to read all the other reviews to try to troubleshoot on the matter of not being 'done in the middle'.  I decided to use vanilla bean Hagen daz brand icecream because it is known for being very, very creamy and rich.  I also bake my pumpkins instead of steaming them....that way it helps to get more water out of the pumpkin and one is left with pure puree.  I think doing both those things was really the key for me in having a wonderfully creamy, rich pie that everyone raved over.  I did add some more pumpkin pie spice and also doubled the recipe making 2 pies.  This was truly amazing and everyone raved.  Adding fresh whipped cream on top when serving made everyone definitely NOT want to calorie count!  Thanks for the different recipe.

Terrific!  I am not a huge pumpkin pie fan - but I LOVE this recipe!  I cannot enough of it!  I don't use a Graham Cracker crust though - I use a Pillsbury Pie Crust - rubbed down with butter and sprinkled with cinnamon before I pour the pie mixure in.  Ahhh - PERFECTION!

This pie separated and tasted like cooked cream on the bottom and eggy pumpkin on the top.  We actually had to throw it away.  Sorry!

I really loved this recipe.  I have made other pumpkin pies in the past only to be disappointed in their blandness.  The ice cream adds a wonderful flavor- I brought one up to my son's school for the teachers and they loved it.  My family really gobbled it up too.

Thought it was Great.  Not too tangy pumpkin taste.  The only problem I had was it seemed to not completly set(maybe b/c of the ice cream).
It was still excellent though!!!

Ice cream seemed like a good idea but this pie wasn't sweet enough for me.  Tasted too bland...like baby food.

OMG my kids went nuts for this. It was easy and a great way to use our fresh Pumpkin. Made 2 deep dish by doubling recipe and had enough left over for a regular pie. The pies lasted less than 24 hours in my house.

This is my favorite pumpkin pie. There are some tips to follow for success.  -add 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract to the pie mixture. -warm the french vanilla ice cream (microwave) once its at room temperature -room temperature eggs (i drop them in warm water before i crack them) -hand wisk mixture until most of the vanilla froth is more pumpkin color -once the mixture is poured in foil the edges so the crust doesn't burn  My family voted that this recipe as our official  thanksgiving pie from now on.

We were all apprehensive about this recipe, but it turned out great! I do think I'll use a little less ice cream next time, just for texture. But we were quite pleased with the flavor, and did not taste the ice cream, as mentioned by other reviewers (I used Breyers French Vanilla).

I made exactly as directions allowed, this rates a 10 and was a hit at thanksgiving!!

One suggestion: use crust protector ring or cover outside edge with foil,  as sides get dark quick!

This is the first time I attempted to make a pumpkin pie. For some reason, I have a hard time with pies, even though I can bake pretty much anything else. I chose this recipe because of the ice cream in it. It was SOOO easy! I used french vanilla ice cream and omitted the ginger,(I forgot to buy it!) so I made it with cloves instead, using the amount for the ginger. I added 3 extra pinches of cinnamon, 2 extra pinches of nutmeg and 2 extra pinches of cloves, in 2 graham crusts(store bought). This was the absolute BEST pumpkin pie ever!!! I had no problem with setting and i baked it for the first 15 mins as instucted, then thirty minutes more. AWESOME!! Thanks, this is the only recipe I will ever use!

In preparation for the upcoming Thanskgiving holiday I tried this recipe out yesterday.  My family all agreed that it was better than "normal" pumpkin pie.  I agree with them.  The differences are subtle, though the end result is a "notch above".  The melted icecream gives a creamier taste and produces a filling that is slightly lighter in color and texture.  I used the entire batch of filling in one pie, instead of two as the recipe suggests, and therefore, had to bake it about 15 minutes longer.  This pie will definately be making an appearance on our Thanskgiving table.

While this is an excellent pumpkin pie recipe, it is not the best I have ever tried. It is a very easy recipe to follow, but I did make some changes. I used pumpkin pie spice rather than the combination of spices called for. I also cut the sugar down to 1/2 a cup (it would have been too sweet otherwise). I would definitely suggest using fresh pumpkins whenever possible. All in all, I did like the final result, and would likely use this recipe again.

I just made this yesterday for Thanksgiving and it was spectacular!  It's the pumpkin pie recipe I've been waiting for.  The vanilla ice cream makes a HUGE difference than using either condensed or evaporated milk.  HUGE.  Plus, I went a step further and used Hagen Das (yum!) for the extra richness.  From now on, this will be my go-to pumpkin pie recipe.

I have used this recipe for 3 years now, and even my sister (who hates pumkin pie) will eat it.  It is a great alternative to the boring condensed/evaporated milk version. I use the all original vanilla ice cream, and I am not sure if it makes a difference or not, but it is a hit in our family.

I have never heard of melted ice cream in a pie recipe especially pumpkin but this is awesome.I made this recipe one week and a traditional pumpkin pie recipe a couple weeks later and this recipe blew all the others out of the water.The melted ice cream adds a superb flavor that you will never find in your basic pumpkin pie.Excellent!!!    Thanks!!!

Great pie.  Everyone loved it and I'll be making it again soon.  Some changes I made:  warm the ice cream, 1.25 teaspoon cinnamon, 0.5 teaspoon ginger, 0.5 teaspoon nutmeg, 0.5 teaspoon allspice, 3 tablespoons scotch.  I also cooked it for more like 55 minutes

excellent flavor! The vanilla ice cream makes this pie a crowd pleaser every time. The tips I used were to melt the ice cream until it's warm to prevent separating and covering the crust with a pie shield. Came out perfectly!

Loved this recipe, not usually a pumpkin pie fan, but this was more delicate in flavor and very creamy.

The best pumpkin pie I ever had! I made it for my friends - let me tell you, it was popular. I don't remember bringing any leftover pieces home.
 Thanks a lot for wonderful recipe!

The pie turned out great! It was a big hit and everyone wanted to know why this turned out so great. I have already made two this week! I did read the reviews, and melted the ice cream and mixed it together well...baking time was very consistent with the recipe. I did not have to stir it in the middle of cooking.

I am not a pumpkin pie fan, but this didnt have a strong pumpkin pie taste. so if you want a traditional taste, dont do this recipe! but if you want something a little different, definitely try it.  i used a pumpkin spice and cinnamon for flavor, i think next time i will add more.  i also used a graham cracker crust and will DEFINITLY NOT use this again and use a regular pie crust.  i used french vanilla ice cream for it.  turned out good, just melt the ice cream all the way in the microwave!

This pie really is delicious! This was my first time making a pie, and not only was it delicious but I'm quite proud! Although I used a graham cracker crust and I think next time I will use the regular pumpkin pie crust.  I used pumpkin pie spice instead of all of the other spices (cheaper and easier) and it tastes just fantastic!! Don't forget to cover the edges of the crust with foil so it won't burn!! I hope those who read this will enjoy making this pie as much as  did!! Thanks, Cindy!!

Wonderful if you like pumpkin, but sometimes find normal pie a bit rich.  My grandpa, who doesn't like much of anything loved this!  A favorite, and will be a staple at holidays!

Too sweet for us- maybe the ice cream brand was too rich.  Not enough pumpkin flavor either- tasted more like the ice cream.  Also, I would say this is really a stretch for two pies- the pies were only about 1 inch thick- I prefer a deeper pumpkin pie.

I made two pies from this recipe last Thanksgiving. Yes, from scratch, including the crust. I brought them to a family party where there were 6 OTHER pies.  Guess who didn't have any left over?  Thank you so much for this wonderful recipe!  I will never make another pumpkin pie!

I just got interested into cooking, and this is my first pumpkin pie to make. Everybody who tried it they liked it and came back for more, specially my little children who asked me to cook for more. It's better than the ones we bought from store. Aside from using "Graham Craker Pie Crust" I followed the recipe exactly as it is with no problem. Make sure to use 3 cups (1 1/2 pints) of ice cream melted at room temperature to avoid having problem with your pie for being eggy, bubbly, or separating into layers.

This was a great pie recipe which I will surely use again.  I used real pumpkin (made a week or two earlier and then frozen) for the first time - and it was great!  The recipe says that it will make two pies - so that's what I did, but it really was only enough for one pie.  Both pies came out rather flat.  Next time will only use one shell (or double recipe).

Wonderful pie! Everyone asked for the recipe. I added a pinch more of each spice and it turned out great. I made my own pumpkin puree and I would recommend you do so too, it just tastes better.

I wanted a good and easy recipe for my Thanksgiving pumpkin pie. This was super easy using canned pumpkin and store bought graham cracker crusts. I used Edy's Homemade Vanilla ice cream, and the flavor was perfect, not too heavy on the pumpkin. This will be my holiday pie from now on.
My husband and I loved it! Actually, so did our dog--glad the recipe makes two pies, but that's another story. Note to self for future: greyhounds can reach to back of kitchen counter.

While this pumpkin pie recipe tastes wonderful, please note that it is not enough to fill two 9-inch pieshells and make two pumpkin pies. I made the recipe to its specifications, and when I poured the pumpkin pie mixture into the shells,I the noticed that each pie was only about 1/2 inch thick. Even after I baked the pies, they weren't that thick. The pie tasted delicious, but the pies were very thin. I will make this recipe again, but if I want to make two pies, I will double the recipe.

Very very tasty! We used pumpkins from our garden. And instead of the 3 separate spices, we simply used a pumpkin pie spice blend from the Cleveland West Side Market. The ice cream added a very creamy, bright flavor. Very tasty.

I used pumpkin ice cream even and wow it was great! The texture is more of a pumpkin mouse... then of the tradictional pumpkin pie.  Saw friends three days later and they told me yet again how much they liked it! :)

HELP! I made this recipe two days ago. I followed everything to a "T". When I poured the mixture into the pie shells- they only filled up half way.  I had a torte... not pumpkin pies. I did use 3 cups of ice cream- I went online to look at a pint to cup ratio.  I'm not sure what I did wrong. I took the eggs straight from the frig- they were not at room temperature. The ice cream was melted in the microwave... did any of the above hinder the recipe?  The "tortes" do taste good... but I would like to make this the correct way next time!!!!

THANK YOU for this recipe!!! I just followed all of Headmeister's additional directions and it turned out beautifully. My dad is lactose intolerant, and they make lactose-free vanilla ice cream but not lactose-free evaporated milk (so far as I know). I made this last Thanksgiving, and it was the first pumpkin pie he'd eaten in fifteen years!

I used this recipe last year and it was excellent! My only complaint was the lack of cloves. The good thing? People that don't usually like pumpkin pie liked it without the clove. But was a little mild for those that like it more spicy. This year I am going to try adding 1/4 tsp of clove to this recipe and see how it turns out. Otherwise, I absolutely loved this one. The melted vanilla ice cream adds a unique AND AWESOME taste and texture. I can't wait to try it with a little more zip with the cloves :)

Fantastic pie...  I am not a big fan of pumpkin, but this recipe is mild and creamy...  I even use a little more pumpkin than indicated.  Overall, the best I have ever had!

I've been using your pumpkin pie recipe for about 6 years now, and I NEVER have leftovers!!!  I also found out that canned pumpkin rather than homemade pumpkin puree retains many more vitamins due to the canning process versus the cooking process!  Which made your lovely recipe all the more simple and time saving!  Thank you thank you thank you for posting this recipe, it's the best!!!

I have been making this recipe for the past two years. I mentioned I wasn't making the pumpkin pies this year and I got the biggest boos. So I am happy to day Cindy's pumpkin pie will be on the baking list. Thanks for sharing such a great recipe we all do enjoy

I am giving this 4 out of 5 stars because I thought it lacked a little flavor- but everyone else loved it.  Perhaps I am just too critical of my own baking, but it was still very good.  I may try adding a little molasses next time, or using a different flavor ice cream, but overall it's a good recipe!

Absolutely amazing! I don't care for pumpkin pie, but I LOVED this one!   Taking another reviewers suggestion, I melted the ice cream in the microwave until luke warm. I only used two cups of the melted ice cream.  Also, I don't know if my measurements were off, but my two pies came out very thin. Next time I'm going to double the recipe, and make 3 pies out of it instead of 4.  I highly recommend this recipe! Went over great @ Thanksgiving and will be making it again for Christmas.

This was delicious! I used french vanilla ice cream and melted it in the microwave before mixing and it turned out great. Since I made two pies I stirred one, and left the other alone to see if it made a difference-- DO NOT STIR! If you melt the ice cream and mix it thoroughly, stirring will only mess up your pie. The one I left untouched turned out perfect, no separation at all. The slight changes I made were: 1/2 c. white sugar and 1/4 c. brown sugar, and I used 1/2 tsp. pumpkin spice (in addition to the 1 tsp cinnamon) instead of the ginger and nutmeg. I used two store bought pie shells, though next time I'll be making my own, those were too bland. Be sure to cover your pie in tinfoil and it will turn out great! Will definitely use again.

great recipe! great pie! i didn't have any ginger on hand and i used 1/2 cup of brown sugar and it came out awesome. two pies in a family of 5 and gone in 2 days- not good for our waistlines, but definitely yum to the palate. the ice cream did not separate for me, it was fine. maybe the temp of the ice cream has something to do with it, because my ice cream was completely melted and slightly warm. thanks!!

Great.  I couldn't believe you actually used melted ice cream, but I didn't have any evp. or swt. cond. milk, and this is the only recipe I could find that didn't use it.  Will make again. Creamy.

Ok, first of all I would like to say thank you for this wonderful recipe. My dad loved this pumpkin pie. One pointer though I did notice people said they were having problems with the separation of the ice cream and the pumpkin mixture. To solve this problem heat up the ice cream in the microwave until it is relativley warm but not hot. Once again I would like to thank you for this wonderful recipe. A sure hit in my family I will definatley be making this again!!!!!

I am NOT a pumpkin pie fan. That said, this recipe was fantastic! I will never, ever make a traditional pumpkin pie again. This recipe produces a light, fluffy and delicious filling that melts in your mouth. I used French vanilla ice cream and canned pumpkin. My daughter, who is a die hard pumpkin pie fan, inhaled her slice and declared it the best she's ever had. Thanks for a great recipe!

This recipe is great!  I made it for Thanksgiving.  My mother is a terrible critic of food prepared by others.  Once she tasted a piece of my slice, she had to have her own.  I microwaved the ice cream and I didn't have any issues with separation.  I used 1 pint of butter pecan and 1/2 pint of vanilla, Haagan Dazs.  Try this out and you will not be sorry!

Good flavor and everything, but the recipe came no where near two pies wortho  of filling. I ended up filling the rest of the pie crust with a chocolate cream-ish mix and swirled it to make a full pie

I made this DAIRY-FREE b/c my son has an allergy to milk, so instead of regular ice cream I used Tofutti soy ice cream, it turned out SO GREAT! Oh my gosh. I couldn't be more excited b/c now my lil peach can have Pumpkin pie for Thanksgiving & we don't have to worry about eating any and then accidently kissing or touching him and causing him to break out. My family loved it as well. What a great hit. Thanks a Billion for the recipe! I highly recommend! YUM

I followed the recipe exactly only substituting the vanilla ice cream for butter pecan. I melted my ice cream in the microwave then whisked everything together until smooth with a hand mixer. I also used store bought pie crusts. I did not have a problem with the filling separating. It tasted great! My husband and I nearly finished two pies in three days. btw, don't forget to cover your crusts after the first 15 minutes.

This is the best pumpkin pie I have ever made!  The only adjustment I made was that I didn't have ginger, so instead of 3 separate spices, I used 1/2 tsp. of pumpkin pie spice and 1/2 tsp. cinnamon.  To prevent my crust from burning, I put the foil on before sticking it in the oven and removed it about 15 minutes before it was done to give it a golden crust.  After the first time, I figured out it was easier to put foil on when it was cool instead of the last half hour of baking when it was already hot.  The only mistake I made on this recipe was cutting it in half to make only one pie!  There is only 3 people in my house and it only lasted about 12 hours.  I am baking my second one right now.

This is the only pumpkin pie recipe I have attempted.  The first time I made it I ran out of vanilla ice cream, so I used half-vanilla, half-chocolate and was very pleasantly surprised. I just made the pie again last night, and used all coffee-flavored ice cream, with excellent results. The ice cream made it very sweet, though, so next time (in about two weeks for Thanksgiving) I'll try 1/2 cup sugar instead of 3/4 cup. I love making this recipe with real (not canned) pureed pumpkin!  The leftover puree freezes well and gives me an excuse to make additional pies, soups, etc. The pie also cuts like a dream; nice, even slices, no crumbs or broken crusts.

It's good, but it's not that great.  The middle came out fine, but I really couldn't tell the difference between this pie and traditional pumpkin pie.  It's a neat idea, however, and I might try it with butter pecan ice cream.  That might be good.

I had never baked any sort of pie before and I was a little worried that the pumpkin pie wouldn't turn out but this was easy and delicious! I paired it with the Healthier Graham Cracker crust from this site and baked it in an aluminum foil pan so I had no issues with the crust burning. There were no cracks at all and the consistency was perfect! I used French vanilla ice cream and a teaspoon of pumpkin pie spice instead of separate spices but I did also add in some extra cinnamon. Everyone loved it!

As all the reviewers indicated this recipe received rave reviews as the "best ever," even from none pumpkin pie eaters.  I made a pecan toffee brickle from butter, pecans, water and sugar, cooked till brown, smeared it on a cookie sheet, broke it up after it had set, then sprinkled around the crust. I also did as one reader said, and made one pie, cooking the pie approx. ten minutes til set.  I did take a picture but am not sure how to attach to this review.

This was a very easy receipe.  I used canned pumpkin.  I also used light vanilla ice cream which I think next time I'll use full fat ice cream because the center of my pie was a bit loose even though I baked it according to directions.  I think the reduced fat ice cream might have made it a bit watery.  Other then that, a fantastic pie!

I made this recipe for Thanksgiving with a pie pumpkin I had leftover from Halloween.  Everyone loved it, and the pie was gone in no time!  I had heard horror stories about fresh pumpkin pies turning out watery, but this one came out perfect.  It was my first pumpkin pie too.  The only thing to note is that I used all the filling for just one pie (with a little extra lefover).

Very, very delicious and easy to make.  the texture turned out thinner and more custardy than I predicted, but the pies were still tasty nonetheless.  I used fresh pumpkin meat scooped out and directly pureed in a blender (didn't do those baking in the pumpkin shell steps), and it worked well.

This was the first pumpkin pie I'd ever made and I almost didn't try it because I thought the melted ice cream was weird, but the reviews were good so I gave it a whirl. A whole pie was gone in less than 24 hours! Even family members who aren't crazy about pumkin pie had second helpings. Using fresh pumpkin definitely made a difference, and the time that took was worth it.

Everyone loved this.  One person had a second piece!  I used light ice cream and half sugar/half splenda to cut calories a bit.  Still tasted great.  It has a lighter flavor than most pumpkin pies.

edible, but not a good pumpkin pie. Maybe because i'm comparing it to grandmas... but it was just too eggy and fluffy for my liking. I was really excited about the icecream idea, but it made the pie to fluffy. I had no problems with it separating like some reviewers did, and i did everything the recipe called for. Everyone ate it and said it was pretty good, but i think it was politeness because i hated it! However, i am a -huge- fan of pumpkin pie so maybe i don't like it just because it's not how i'm used to pumpkin pie. It was worth a shot, but i'm sticking with my old recipe.

This was flavourful.  I stirred the pie half way through as others suggested - but this wasn't necessary.  The pie didn't appear to be separating (I used fully melted ice cream), and stirring it really mucked it up.  This makes enough for one large pie - but not quite enough for two small pies.

This is the BEST pumpkin pie!!! I took this to a carry in dinner at church and it didn't even last five minutes. The filling is so much lighter with the ice cream... it really adds a nice flavor. I will never use another pumpkin pie recipe again. Thanks.

This was my first pumpkin pie. I have to say it's not like mom's but, I never really like hers that much.  I loved it!  I was really surprised.  Thanks, for a great recipe.

My favorite.  This recipe ran in Good Housekeeping Mag many years ago.  I call it my fluffy pumpkin pie recipe.  I make one pie with 1 1/2 cups vanilla ice cream, softened,  and 1-15 oz can pumpkin puree, 1/2 cup sugar usual brown and maple syrup and 1 tsp salt and 2 tsp pumpkin pie spice.  Another thing that works it to use Trader Joes pumpkin ice cream.  This is very sweet and spicy so I reduce sugar and pie spice.  Its not great ice cream on its own but it makes a great pie!

This will be what I use for the rest of my life; everyone LOVES it and it's easy!!  I did make a couple of alterations.  I used 2 cups of pumpkin and used close to a tablespoon of cinnamon, a pinch of ginger and cloves.  Also a little note; the type of ice-cream makes a HUGE difference.  Fluffy ice-cream makes a fluffy texture.  I tried a heavy, rich ice-cream the second time around for giggles and it made a very dense and (almost) to rich pie.  There is a direct correlation; cheap ice-cream tends to turn out better.  I also do a hand-made whipped cream to go with that everyone loves.  It is heavy whipping cream, vanilla, pinch of salt, cinnamon, and sugar. =)  Oh!  And with more pumpkin it needs a longer cook time, just a heads up.

I have made about 8-10 pies from this recipe. I add ground cloves and vanilla. Tonight, as usual, I added about 12 minutes to the cooking time. Unlike some other reviewers, I have no experience with the ingredients separating. I mix the ingredients well. By the time the mix goes into the pie crust the ice cream clumps have been broken down. It is simple to make. My guests give it good reviews.

Here's the deal, y'all. I've been making pumpkin pies for a few years now. This recipe is fabulous. It breaks away from traditions, but it's a good thing. Using ice cream is brilliant. It's your sugar and cream that you need, and much more wholesome than using processed sweetned condensed milk. I recommend using all natural vanilla bean ice cream. Breyer's works fabulously. End product comes out sweet, rich and tasty. The only thing I can recommend to add to this is to grate the zest of an organge or mandarin into the mixture before you pour it in the pie shells. The zest will liven up the mellow taste of the pumpkin- making for a tantalizing taste.

Best pumpkin pie I or my family have ever had. I warm up my ice cream in a pan on the stove. I also warm up the pumpkin puree in a pan; it helps get rid of the "canned taste". Anyone who's pie separated during baking OR needed to "stir" while it's baking has no business baking in the first place. I've made this recipe 3 times so far and never had ANY issues. Thank you for this wonderful recipe :D

This pie dish was good, but very sweet if you are using canned pumpkins mix.  This recipe should come with a clear caution - "do not replace pumpkin puree with canned pumpkin mix".   The pre-sweetened canned pumpkin plus sugar and vanilla ice cream was way too sweet.

Why buy pumpkin pie when you can make this? Such an easy pie to make and so delicious. I followed some other reviewers' recommendations: I melted the ice cream in the microwave until WARM. I used room temp eggs and I forgot to de-thaw the frozen pie crusts (took a short cut and chose not to make home-made crusts) so I put the crusts in the pre-heated oven for a couple minutes to quickly de-thaw them. Be careful they don't start baking if you do this though. :-)  I added about a teaspoon of vanilla and cut the sugar to 1/2 cup. I don't think I added enough nutmeg or maybe I just like a little more nutmeg flavor in my pumpkin pie. I will probably increase the amount of nutmeg next time. All in all, delicious. My family enjoyed it and I think this will be a new tradition for me.

I came across this pie recipe one morning when I really wanted to make a pumpkin pie but I had no sweetened condensed milk so I was looking for a recipe that didn't call for it. When I came across this recipe I also had no vanilla ice cream but I had pumpkin ice cream from Trader Joe's so I used that and just left out the spices because the pumpkin ice cream already has them in it.  And it turned out GREAT!!!! I am going to try with vanilla ice cream next time and see what is better but I would highly recommend using this recipe!

I didn't love this pie.  I was good, but I was expecting "WOW" and it just didn't deliver.  The flavor was very good, but the texture was off.  It was a bit airy, rather than custard-like...which, is how I prefer it.  Now, if I was serving this as a souffle or a mousse, then it would be great.

This recipe lacked EVERYTHING.  I used fresh pumpkin.  The only review's I got from 20+ dinner guests was that they could not taste the pumpkin, and they could not taste any seasoning.  I personally thought it tasted of nothing but egg.  I had to use regular vanilla ice cream as it had to be lactose free, so was not able to experiment that way as some had done, but that should not have made that big of a difference.   I will try this recipe again using canned pumpkin, fewer eggs, more spices and add some vanilla and brown sugar, as well as possibly some pumpkin extract if needed...   overall, I was greatly disappointed with this recipe and wonder why it gets such rave reviews. If the 2nd time doesn't turn out, this recipe will NOT be added into my holiday recipe box.

Loved this pie easy to make. I read the reviews and some of them said that the pie didn't have enough pumpkin flavor so instead of using all vanilla ice cream I used 1 pint vanilla and half a pint of pumpkin ice cream completely melted and put into a graham cracker crust. Yummy!!!!

This is an amazing recipe. It came out very well for us, but I only credit that to reading other reviewers comments. Recipe fails to include key information (like importance of having ice cream melted, and adding room temp eggs). Also, recipe lists this as making two pies. I did this the first time that I made this, and there was no where near enough filling for two. I made it again today, and just filled a slightly larger pie plate all the way full. It came out perfect!

I've been using this pumpkin pie recipe for the past 5 years and it has always been a big hit.  It's very rich but the ice cream gives it a lighter consistency than sweet condensed milk used in more traditional recipes.

SO GOOD. I used Marie Calendar's frozen pie crust, it went so perfectly with this sweet pumpkin pie. I loved it! Next time I'm trying fresh pumpkin instead of canned :)

My guests really raved about this, I thought it was jusk ok.  I did only use 1/2 cup sugar instead of 3/4, so maybe that was it.  I also used a premade crust due to time constraints, and that might also have reduced it in favor.

This is delicious, but it is more like a custard pie than a pumpkin pie. After making it and tasting this pie i compared other pie recipes, and this one calls for 1/2 the amount of pumpkin as most other pumpkin pie recipes. So it is a custard pumpkin pie. I made the recipe as is and it was delicious, just not very "pumpkiny."

Pretty awesome.  My bro-in-law loves pumpkin pie and he was not dissapointed with this at all.  The icecream in it really makes it unique without losing the traditionalism of the pie.  The only thing I did different was cut the ice cream amount by 1/2 cup, and even then it was not the firmness I like.  Next time, I'll probably cut a full cup.  I measured the ice-cream when it was completely liquid but still cool.  Will certainly use again and again!

This was the first time I made pumpkin pie and i used the fresh pumpkin. It was by far the best pumpkin pie I had ever tasted. I read some of the reviews and it seemed like a lot of people had problems with the it separating so to "plump" it up I only used about 1 pint of the ice cream instead of the 11/2 pints and then I also used more pumpkin. When the timer went off, it looked beautiful and it tasted great! Everyone loved how thick and creamy it was. Very good recipe. Will make again and again.

Great and easy recipe. We have a diabetic in the family so I used Splenda white sugar and I used "Breyers Sugar Free French Vanilla" ice cream (it may have been called "no sugar added"). This gave the pie a different texture, it was a lot softer and.... foamer?! The kids loved it and so did my man. My mother AND sister asked for the recipe which for a first time pie-baker made me quite smug. :) Enjoy

This was awesome!!! A little messy (I put the boxes of ice cream on a cookie tin and in the oven to thaw them...wow I am dumb...lol) but so worth it.  Unlike any pumpkin pie I have ever made. Really runny before it goes into the oven...I was spilling it everywhere...(probably thanks to my lake of too melted ice cream...)but it is wonderful once it is done!!!

This is my favorite pumpkin pie!  My boyfriend and I made it twice, we loved it so much.  The second time we added more pumpkin (1.5 of the smaller cans) and a little less ice cream just to make it a little more pumpkin-y.
It got rave reviews at Thanksgiving, and it was talked about for days after!

Great pumpkin pie!  I used this recipe because I didn't have any heavy cream or condensed milk, which you need for most pumpkin pie recipes.  Anyways, it turned out great, no problems at all with separating.

I made two pies for Thanksgiving and I was in competition agains my daughters pumpkin cheesecake and everyone loved it.  The only additions I made was I added another 1/4 cup of pumpkin and in addition to the spices I added some shakes of pumpkin pie spice.  I used can pumpkin and is worked just fine.

my wife and I made this for Thanksgiving and it turned out great. As many others have sugested we let the eggs and Ice Cream reach room temperature before making it, and covered the crust with foil. This is definitely a keeper.

This was my first time making pumpkin pie ever, and let me just say that this was the most delicious pumpkin pie I have ever tasted!..(and I LOVE, and have tasted MANY pumpkin pies in my day!)  I followed other reviewers' advice and melted the ice cream completely before mixing it in.  I don't mean to toot my own horn, but man, this pie was delicious and generated many complements from my family.

Awesome! I have never liked pumpkin pie but I loved this one. My whole family enjoyed it. We went through 2 of them in less than 20 minutes. Thanks so much for sharing.

Very good.  I used homemade graham cracker shell.  Make sure to mix before the pie sets because the ice cream separates.

WOW! This is my favorite pumpkin pie recipe! It is smooth and creamy not overly spiced or overpowered by the pumpkin. I like to use gram cracker pie crust and I find that Publix brand ice cream works wonders. Some of the other reviews say that the ice cream separates and I really think it has to do with the brand you use, Publix dose not separate so I would recommend it. I hope you enjoy it as much as my family and I have!

FANTASTIC! Mine didn't come out looking very appealing. It was very light in color, and looked like it was bubbling. I'm not sure what I did differently than others to amke it llok that way. But,  my boyfriend is a great guinea pig though. He tried it anyways and we found out it tasted wonderful!

This is the first time I've ever made a pumpkin pie from scratch. Making the puree was really easy.
The pie tasted wonderful. I warmed the ice cream to room temperature (as other people had suggested) and had no problems. 
I have enough puree left over to make a few pies for thanksgiving. I'm sure they'll be a hit!

Made this using the butter pecan icecream and it turned out amazing!  Next time i plan to use a sugarfree sweetener and a little more pumpkin.  I also used "pumpkin pie spice" along with the cin.  Cannot wait to make it for my family at Thanksgiving!  **10/12/09 i have made this several times in the past year and have found that it tastes best with fresh pumpkin (I bake it then make it into puree).  You will be amazed at how much better it makes an already great pie!

This was the best pumpkin pie I've ever had!  My mom was incredibly jealous that I didn't use her recipe for Thanksgiving and I'm glad I didn't because this was awesome. I took the suggestions of making sure the ice cream was completely melted and I didn't have any trouble with separation at all. I did have to bake it for much longer after tenting it, though. Great recipe.

I made this recipe last night (in preparation for Thanksgiving), and with that extra pie I've made everyone in my house eat some for breakfast.  All I have gotten were wows, and it is just as good as Marie Callender's pie.  I used a box mix for the crust (they were out of every kind of premade crust at the store, and I am not good enough with them to make my own from scratch) that was Betty Crocker, and it was good.  And because there are no pumpkins for sale in late November, I bought a can of unseasoned pumpkin and heated it a bit on the stove before mixing it in, 'cause I read somewhere that that would get rid of the "canned" taste.  I also used about 3/4 teaspoon of pumkin pie seasoning with an additional 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon.  I might add more cinnamon next time.  And I used vanilla bean Haagen Daaz ice cream, which added some lovely vanilla specks throughout the pie.  But overall, it was super easy and it turned out amazing, and I've never made pies before.  The only annoying thing was that it took me over 30 minutes to prep it, but the pie was so good that I'm willing to overlook that.  I think I'll be repeating this constantly.

We've made this pie for Thanksgiving for the past few years now. It's become a Family Tradition! We've moved to a high altitude, so I am hoping that it doesn't affect it this Thanksgiving! Best recipes ever!  It will be passed down! Thanks!

Makes a delicious, light and fluffy pumpkin pie.  People always ask me for this one.  (even the dog loves it...he stole a pie off the counter while it was still hot and ate it all but one bite)  This is a family favorite now.

I had never made a pumpkin pie  before so I  "tested" several recipes to see which one went over the best with my husband.  This one won with flying colors.  I used Coldstone Creamery Sweet Cream Ice Cream once I was comfortable with the recipe.  Also I found that the FRESH puree I made makes this taste so much better than from a can.

This is the best pumpkin pie I've ever had. I used Breyer's extra creamy vanilla, and it was perfect. Making the puree yourself from a fresh pumpkin is key; canned pumpkin puree tends to taste like the can and just doesn't give the same results.

I've been making this pie for years and just now I am getting around to reviewing it. It's fantastic. It may just be my oven but I do have to leave it in for about 5 additional minutes before reducing the temp. I get requests every year now for this pie and I have printed off this recipe for friends a lot of times.

I made this and took it to my boyfriend's sister's house for Thanksgiving and it was a hit. My only complaint was that I found that the recommended cooking time was too long, since I followed the instructions and the pie was a little bit burnt.

Fabulous pie!  I got raves!  Too make it more pumpkiny flavored, I added 1/4 teaspoon of pumpkin pie spice.  I also used just one 10 inch graham cracker crust to be a little different.  My family loved it!

I'm not a fan of the traditional pumpkin pie so I thought I'd try this recipe. I've made this pie a few times now but always had a problem with the ice cream separating. I've read some suggestions to put the pureed pumpkin in a coffee filter and let the fluids drip out over night. And VOILA! No more separating and the entire family loves it! Absolutely fantastic recipe. Thanks.

I've made this pie for Thanksgiving the past 2 years and have always gotten compliments. The ice cream really makes the pie so delicious. I wasn't a big pumpkin pie fan either but this pie is just awesome. I like making them as tartlettes.

I tried this recipe this past Canadian Thanksgiving and had rave reviews on it!!  Even people who said they didn't care for pumpkin pie ended up eating a slice- which was a good think since there were 11 people for dinner half of whom I didn't know!

WOW, I made this for Thanksgiving (Canadian).  Only my mother and I are pumpkin pie fans, but luckily this made 2 pies because everyone was gobbling it up.  I even had to give the recipe to a few people.  Thanks for the keeper!!

The texture was light and fluffy but I found it too sweet and not enough pumpkin taste. I also had to wrap the crust with foil because it was getting too brown. Otherwise, very simple recipe.

I agree that this is a good one for people who do not like Pumpkin Pie as i am one of those people.  i LOVED this recipe.  I only wish i had read further in the reviews and would have probably doubled the recipe to make the two pies.  This one came out kind of flat as two pies.  Still very delicious.  I did serve it with whipped topping as well.  Going to buy pie shells tonight to make it again!

I found this when I discovered we didn't have any evaporated milk for the more traditional pumpkin pie. My family loved this pumpkin pie, and said that it was creamier than the more traditional one we usually have and would recommend it to anyone.

This is the first time I have ever made pumpkin pie. The smell drove my husband and father so batty that I had to cut them some before it cooled/set completely.  They ate it VERY quickly and proclaimed it the "best pumpkin pie they've ever had"!  I have to agree.  This was very easy, and is VERY good.  I added a pinch more nutmeg than called for in the recipe... EXCELLENT - I will definitely make this again.
(PS I did use fresh pumpkin puree)

Excellent taste, not as strong on pumpkin flavor as some other recipes, which may be what some are looking for.  The ice cream creates an interesting bottom layer that is somewhat custard-y and richly sweet.

This recipe was so good even my husband liked it.  He is a very picky eater and hates pumpkin pie but I convinced him to try some, because I was making it with a real pumpkin, so he did and he ate almost a whole pie by himself.

this is only the second time I've felt I needed to rate and review a recipe. this was SO good (and I don't like pumpkin pie)! I only made a couple changes. I used one pint ice cream (Reed's ginger ice cream with chuncks of ginger in it! ) and bummped the ground ginger up to 1/2 tsp. Also fresh nutmeg instead of preground. This recipe fit in one deep dish pie for me. Topped off with ginger whipped cream, and this was a smash!! thanks for the recipe Cindy!

Light  creamy, but the filling did crack quite badly, although I didn't have any problems with separation.  I used fresh puree and halved the recipe using the scaling function on this site.  I added 1.5 tablespoons of flour to thicken the filling and help it set.  I did have quite a lot of filling for one pie even using half the proportions so I'm glad I had a deep dish crust.  It took 1 hour (on top of the initial 15 minutes) to cook through.  The taste and sweetness was fine; I did not reduce the sugar.  The texture is somewhat weak, it's a little hard to remove a piece of pie from the pan without it leaning or breaking off.  Overall, this pie is yummy, but I think I prefer a more traditional one.

My first time ever to make a pumpkin pie, this was so easy!  Everyone loved them!  90% of the people who tried this said it was the best they had ever had!  I did find that you don't quite get enough filling for two pies, so I made another batch and got three pies.  I also cut the sugar to 1/2 cup as other reviewers had suggested.  Thank you so much Cindy!  This is the only recipie I will use.

This is a very good pumpkin pie recipe.  I let the ice cream melt to near room temperature and I had no problems with the top splitting or the filling seperating.  I did add a 1/4 teas. more cinnamon and left the sugar at 3/4 cup instead of cutting it back to 1/2 as other's suggested.  It was just great and I will definitely make this pie again.  My husband loved it too.

My mom this year decided to let me make thanksgiving and I was looking for something a little more different. As soon as I saw the ratings for this pie and discovered that it was made with ice cream I had to try it. I used french vanilla ice cream and added 1 teaspooon more vanilla. Everyone loved it and it was gone by the next day. I will definitly make it for christmas

I don't care much for pumpkin pie and so I had just never made one.  My step-children were coming for Thanksgiving and I remembered that the LAST time they joined us for T-Day they were disappointed so I decided to give it a go and tried this recipe.  Awesome!  Everybody loved it!

This was a great pumpkin pie.  I do not think it was too sweet, but you could always use 1/4 less cup of sugar.  I would add touch more of the spices the next time I make it.  I used the Baker's Secret Pie Crust with this recipe which was great.

I loved this recipe & so did everybody else.  I did cut back on the amount of sugar to 1/2 cup & it was still plenty sweet.  Also couldn't find my ground ginger, so I used 3/4 tsp. pumpkin pie spice in place of the nutmeg, ginger & 1/2 tsp of the cinnamon.  This is a keeper!!!

My Beautiful mom and I have been making this pie for the past 18 years, and has been the hit of our table at Thanksgiving.  The ice cream makes a huge silky taste with a very well balance of spices make this the perfect recipe.  We use real pumpkin (larger pumpkins)  We didn't know then to use the small pie pumpkins, even though it calls for it in the recipe.  So we have been using the larger ones every since :)

This was a really good recipe, although I made the following adjustments:  Because the ice cream I used was already pretty sweet and I was going to serve each slice of pie with a side of ice cream, I cut down on the sugar to almost nothing. I also added around a 1/2 tsp of Allspice to the recipe. If you don't have Allspice, consider adding some ground cloves.

I am not a fan of pumpkin pie but thought I would have to make one from scratch to really have an opinion on it! This pie turned out delicious! Very moist and just the right texture and seasoning! Definitively a keeper!

I've been using Cindy's pumpkin pie recipe for years. It's by far the best pumpkin pie I've ever had. Once people have tried it, then I'm requested to make it again. Thank you Cindy for sharing this delightful recipe!

I have gotten people who swear they don't eat pumpkin pie to  eat it office parties and family gatherings it is always the star of the show. I do add a pinch more spices to my taste. 
I always use fresh pumpkin so I buy several pumpkins and make a lot of puree to last several months past the holidays.

I will more than definitely make this again! I have made this recipe for 2 or 3 years now for Thanksgiving and each year people tell me how good it is. The ice cream adds a great touch to it and it cuts back on the pumpkin flavor...this is a keeper!

Incredible recipe!!! The only problem I've encountered is there isn't enough filling when using the deep pie pans, so I just double the recipe.
I use vanilla bean ice cream and use 1/4 -1/2 cup less sugar.......I'm unsure if the ice cream is sweeter than french vanilla, but it adds a lot of sweetness.
I've, also, used a "pumpkin" squash with pumpkin pie ice cream.....this was a home run, too!!!
Definitely the absolute BEST pumpkin pie I've ever had and always being asked for the recipe!!!

This is the pumpkin pie that people will actually eat! I don't much care for pumpkin pie myself, but over a decade ago when I started hosting Thanksgiving meals, I decided that I wanted pumpkin pie to be part of the meal. The idea of the melted vanilla ice cream sounded intriguing so I tried it. What great results! I have been making these pies every year at Thanksgiving ever since. I follow the instructions precisely and the results are always excellent.

Love this! It's the only pumpkin pie I will make. I've even made it crustless. I've never had any issue with it separating, probably because I melt  the ice cream in the microwave to thick liquid consistency. Never use a room temp egg either. And I always use real pumpkin. Best recipe ever.

I have never failed in making this pie and never have left overs!  I have learned that the flavor profile and richness has EVERYTHING to do with the ice-cream!  I have had my best results with very cheap gas station type pints of ice-cream.  This is because that ice-cream has a LOT more air in it, leaving you with a rich but not heavy pie.  The higher the ice-cream quality let less air there will be, leading to a think and dense pie.  While still yummy, it's almost to rich!

This is the best pumpkin pie I've ever had -- hands down.  The melted ice cream gives the pie a smooth and decadent flavor.  I discovered this recipe over five years ago, and it is the only pumpkin pie recipe I'll ever use.  Thank you for sharing your genius with us.

I have made this pie every year for Thanksgiving for quite a few years. The only year it didn't turn out well was when I made it the night before and refrigerated it, without letting it come to room temperature first. It separated into pumpkin, egg and cream layers, which still tasted fine, but the texture was not so good at all. The pie is DELICIOUS, easy and will wow everyone, every year, I promise!

I have made this pie for the past 4 years for Thanksgiving and everyone loves them. I have also taken them into work for coworkers and they still rave about how good these pies are. I have always used fresh pumpkin and fresh whipped cream for the topping. The fresh pumpkin gives the pie a very light airy feel and taste that cannot be beat.***To cook the fresh pumpkin simply cut a pie pumpkin (you can find them in most grocery stores they are smaller than jack o lantern pumpkins and sweeter) in half and lay open side down on a baking sheet. Cook for one hour then scrape out the meat of the pumpkin and puree either in a blender or food processor. You can make this several weeks in advance and freeze.***

This went fantastically!  Per other users' suggestions, I made sure that the ice cream was totally melted by zapping it in the microwave a bit.  When I stuck my finger in, it was room temperature.  I also made sure to mix it into the pumpkin very, very thoroughly.   Finally, I went nuts with the spices and added a heck of a lot more cinnamon that was strictly necessary, as well as a bit more nutmeg.  The pie turned out VERY light and fluffy (bubbles from the ice cream, maybe?) and everyone who tasted it was very interested in the recipe.  Super easy, super tasty!  Will be making many more in the future!

I found this to be a nice mild pumpkin pie - it made great tarts too. The 30 minutes cooking time was just perfect for the tarts, but I had to leave the pie in for another 30 after that. Used whipped cream with vanilla instead of ice cream, and took the advice of other reviewers to make sure that it and the eggs were at room temperature before mixing: no separation, and a hit in my house!

I trialed this recipe for thanksgiving.  The pies were good, but lacking in flavor.  I didn't have any separation issues.  The pies did come out thin as well when baked in two 9" pie pans.

This Thanksgiving, I made my very first pie. I've always been pretty terrified of making a pie from scatch (I'm a bit of a novice in cooking), but this year I decided to bite the bullet and go for it. I am so very glad I did!

This pie came out superbly. I can't believe that it came out of my kitchen! :-) It was light, fluffy and absolutely delicious. Almost like a pumpkin mousse, if you will. 

Here are some noteworthy mentions:

1) I used a 1/4 measuring cup for the sugar, and put 3 rounded cups in the mix. Not too sweet, not too tart. Perfect!

2) I used Marie Calendar's pre-made deep shell pie shells, so instead of two pies, the batter filled one (and a half). If you use a similar crust, you may have left-over batter, but not quite enough for two pies.

3) I used about 14 ounces of Breyers Frecn Vanilla Bean Ice cream. As other viewers stated, I warmed it in the microwave and saw no seperation.

4) I used 2 tablespoons of Pumpkin Pie Spice, and it was the perfect amount.

5) Don't forget to cover your crust with aluminum foil after the first 15 minutes. While covering the crust sounds easier than it is, it's well worth it; the crust was perfect done.

If you, like me, are considering making a pie for the first time, don't hesitate to try this recipe. It came out so good, it has given me confidence to try other recipes. I may make another one and take it to work to make my co-workers think I'm the next Martha Stewart!

This is a great recipe if you are looking to impress your guests.  A few suggestions, though.  If you are going to use fresh pumpkin puree (like I did), use the smaller pie pumpkins instead.  Because of the ice cream and the natural puree, the pie comes out pale in color making it look less than appealing.  Also, double the spices and add 1/2 tsp of clove for a stronger taste.  I also split the sugar between brown and white for a more moist product.  And don't use store bought crust, its too thin for this recipe.

Excellent!  I was confused on how long to cook after the initial 15 minutes.  I was going to leave in for 1 hr as another review suggested, but I checked it at around 40 minutes (after the initial 15) and it was DONE.  Maybe a tad overdone, as it was very dark brown near the crust, but didn't affect the taste at all.  Delicious!!

This is a great recipe.  I made some modifications, of course.  I used 1/2 Greek yogurt (vanilla) and 1/2 french vanilla ice cream.  I put them in a big bowl to warm in the oven while it preheated.  Then I put all the ingredients in my Vitamix: no separation problems at all.  I added 1 t. vanilla and my own spice mix.  My only complaint is the crust, but then I made it, so I only have myself to blame!

I had to utilize fresh pumpkin I had, so I made this pie. Sorry to say, nothing about this recipe was as I expected. This pie has very good ingredients and a waste of time for the result it shows. It is not worth to waste ice cream to get this result. I didn`t like the texture, it was a little wet. The pie has a strong pumpkin flavor, it tasted like eating fresh pumpkin with spices. I wasn`t able to eat this pie. I`ve made Perfect pumpkin pie from this site with boiled puree and it was much better than this.

I should start by saying that I'm not a fan of pumpkin pie - but this was easy and it was Thanksgiving, so I tried it.  I thought it was just OK.  Everyone "liked" it, but no one raved.

I would say it was average.  I expected more being that it was made with ice cream, but not extra ordinary.  It was good.

I made this pie with great fear about the results, but didn't have any evaporated milk (or even whole milk) ... but I did have some carmel swirl ice cream. I only needed one pie, so after reading the reviews, I ended up with this: 1 15oz can pumpkin puree, 2 eggs, 1-1/2 cups melted carmel swirl ice cream, 2 tsps cinnamon, 1/2 tsp fresh ground nutmeg, 1/2 tsp ginger, 1/2 tsp Chinese 5-spice powder (didn't have any cloves, allspice or pumpkin pie spice), 1/4 cup packed brown sugar, 1 frozen pie shell.  I blind-baked the pie shell, covering edges with foil. Mixed the sugar and eggs, mixed in pumpkin, mixed in spices, added melted ice cream last. Baked at 425 for 15 minutes, then 350 for about 45 minutes longer ... until knife came out clean. Much to my surprise, it turned out absolutely terrific! Everyone raved about it. I wouldn't have done it without this recipe for inspiration. Thanks so much for saving the day!

This pie turned out really great. I was really inprecise when making it, too.  I added a little under half of a 1.75 Quart tub of vanilla ice cream. Then I proceeded to use all of the filling in one pie because my pie dish was deep. I baked it for an extra 20 minutes than the recipe called for, but when it was all said and done, it was DELICIOUS! It really must be pretty foolproof. I have nothing but compliments on it this Thanksgiving. The crust was perfectly flaky and the filling was sweet and pumpkiny without that slimy texture some pumpkin pies get.

This pie is UNBELIEVABLE and I can't believe I made it!  It was so easy. I read the reviews and followed some advice. I made sure the eggs and ice cream were at room temperature.  I used Haagan Dazs Vanilla ice cream (28 fluid ounces) and Spice Islands' Pumpkin Pie spice.  I also used 1/2 white sugar and 1/2 brown sugar, a graham cracker pie crust and 1 can of pumpkin puree.  It's soooooo good.  Enjoy!  Thanks for sharing.

So good! My son decided he would be the official pie baker. I picked the recipe that looked the most delicious and I must admit, I did good! We tried this a week ago to see if we liked it and it was perfect! He baked 8 pies tonight. He's going to make lots of people very happy!

I have made this pie 5 years in a row now.  Now it is known as "the pumpkin pie for people who don't like pumpkin pie".  Seriously, for some reason the switched ingredients of melted ice cream rather than evaporated milk has converted several of my family members who wouldn't touch pumpkin pie before.  So every year they ask me which pie is the one they like (as we always have several other types of pumpkin pie to choose from as well).  Don't get me wrong though, even the 'traditionalists' enjoy it.

I used real pumpkin & followed the directions & had no issues w/my pie being too runny.  It was very yummy, but next time it could use a tad more spices.  Other than that it was great.

Great recipe!  I used ice cream that was warm and had no problems with seperation.  I covered my pie crust with tin foil right from the start and it came out a beautiful golden brown.

Great recipe and innovative idea with the ice cream.  I've found that the bake time at 350 is considerably longer than stated.  I've used 60 minutes as a baseline.  it has come out wonderful each time I've made it.

Just read this recipe about 2 hours ago as a last min dessert.  What a great easy recipe!  I followed others tips about letting the ice cream melt almost completely without getting hot (I did put in microwave for 1 min).  I also used the graham cracker crust, YUM!  This is my first pie I had ever done and will definitely be a repeater in my home.

Pumpkin pie is my fix.  This pumpkin pie ispretty good.  I wouldn't say it is any better or worse than traditional just more poofy.  The only real difference I could tell was that while baking it poofed up while traditional stayd creamy.  But after chilled it took a more creamy texture.  Before baking it is thinner than traditional but it works out pretty well.  All in all i might try it again I might not.  The hardest thing about it was figuring out which container of ice cream was a pint.

I haven't eaten a piece of pumpkin pie since my first taste of one some 30 years ago so I was hesitant to even try a bite. After hearing my husband say 'it was perhaps the best he'd ever eaten', I had a bite. I was pleasantly surprised and found the taste to be similar to carrot cake due to the spices in the recipe. I will certainly be making this one again and again as the males in my household gave rave reviews! Many thanks.

followed the advice of the commenters and this came out perfect. i'd never made pie (let alone pumpkin pie) before and even though i did the whole thing from scratch (real pumpkin and all :P) it came out fantastic.

This is a great recipe!!!! We have two diabetics and this recipe alters nicely to help cut the sugar. If you don't like the "extra sweet " taste that I have noticed is a common complaint in some of the commentary, we made it less sweet by using no sugar added icecream and Splenda Blend, it cuts the sweet down and still leaves you with the great taste of a pumpkin pie. It cuts calories and sugar and still taste great. Mine are always gone quickly and I make at least 8 each year.

I've been asked for this recipe everywhere I've brought this pie. Thanks Cindy! Also, I make it with graham cracker crust... It's fantastic that way. I've had a little trouble filling two pie crusts, so I tend to add a little extra pumpkin and a little extra ice cream. Fantastic recipe.

I have never made a home made pumpkin pie and thought I would use this one for a "experimental" pie. It turned out great and my family absolutely loved it. The told me that I have to save this and make it like this everytime.

I forgot that to say that I recommend doubling the filling.  Seemed very skimpy as is.  You probably will have a little excess this way, but I think that's better than coming up short!

This is the only pumpkin pie recipe that I use now - the 2 most important things with this recipe are: 1. Use a good quality vanilla ice cream, I recommend Bluebell if you have it. The more artificial ingredients in the ice cream, the more it will separate. 2. Do not try to make a deep dish pie, it just isn't the same. But you can easily freeze 1/2 the batter once everything is mixed together, if you only need to make one pie at a time!  If you freeze 1/2 the batter it goes back to point 1 - don't cheap out on the ice cream, it won't freeze or defrost as well.

Even with no measuring cups and a tin of 'pumpkin pie spice', this recipe came out great. Also used soy icecream instead of regular, as I am allergic to dairy. Very easy and quick.

I live overseas in Turkey and one year all my expat friends wanted me to make a traditional Thanksgiving dinner, so I had to find recipes that used ingredients I could get.  I found this pumpkin pie recipe that uses fresh pumpkin and vanilla ice cream because there is no canned pumpkin or evaporated milk in this country and it make a fantastic pumpkin pie!  Now I have made a terrific pumpkin pie every year for my friends here in Turkey and people are always asking me how I do it.  Easy!

Amazing!  Thank you for this recipe.  I followed the instructions precisely and it turned out perfect.  I can't imagine why others had problems.  It's very simple to follow and it DOES work. It had no problem with the center being firm.  I made two pies one 8 inch and one 9 inch.  They both turned out fine.

I wish I could give this 3 1/2 stars because it doesn't quite hit the 4 star mark for me. Based on other reviews, I decided to double the batch and make 2 deep dish 9" pies (with frozen pie crusts). I bought Edy's french vanilla ice cream and canned pumpkin ( one 15 oz. can per batch= the amount of cups called for in the recipe) and added a 3/4 tsp. of extra pumpkin spice to the mix. I microwaved the ice cream until warm and left the eggs room temp. Baked according to directions, the pies did not seem cooked through, so I added 15 minutes and hoped that would do the trick. However, tonight at my party I was a bit let down with the results. Slicing the pie was difficult (it doesn't hold its shape well) and people chose other desserts over the pie because its appearance was messy. The taste was good (but I oddly couldn't even tell there was icecream in it) but less firm than desired and a little gooey. I got one compliment on it, but the two pies were mostly un-touched. I think I will try another pumpkin pie recipe next time.

I made this pie for Thanksgiving and it was sooo yummy!  I used canned pumpkin and used most of the filling for 1 9" pie.  I made 2 more pies a couple of days after Thanksgiving, I doubled the recipe and it was perfect for 2 9" (very full) pies.  No flat pie here!  YUMMMMM!!!

I followed the recipe but adjusted the sugar as suggested in some of the reviews. However, it didn't quite turn out for me. I left it in the oven about a half hour longer than directed to because it didn't seem to be cooking. When I finally took it out and tried it, the filling was tasty but it was not firm enough and the bottom of the crust didn't cook fully.  Dunno what went wrong...

This was my first homemade pie (well except for the crust). It was AWESOME!! My husband loved it! My 2 year old loved it! Can't wait to make another one for Thanksgiving. Who would have thought that ice cream in a pumpkin pie would taste so good.
YUMMY!!!

This recipe is wonderful!  Highly recommended.  The only thing is that I added a 1/8 teaspoon to the mix to add a bit more pumpkin flavor.  Loved the ice cream instead of evaporated milk idea.

I made this pumpkin pie last Thanksgiving, and I am not a big pumpkin pie fan.  I splurged and used melted Haagandaz ice cream and let me tell you that I cant wait for this Thanksgiving so that I can make (and eat) it again!  UNBELIEVABLE!  The ice cream makes all the difference!

This is my family's new favorite pumpkin pie recipe.  It is lighter in texture and has a mellower flavor than tradional pumpkin pie.

This is by far the best recipe for pumpkin pie. I made it for Thanksgiving and Christmas. I used a grahm cracker pie crust which made it even sweeter. I'm still getting rave reviews from my family members, even my in-laws!

This pumpkin pie was great, however, it does not have the old pumpkin spice that just seems to go with pumpkin pie.  I will make this pie again though.

I have made this pie every year for the past 5-6 years.  It is a big hit and the only thing I do differently is add pumpkin pie spice instead of all the individual spices.

My family and I don’t even like pumpkin pie, but we always polish the whole thing off. It does not have that “pumpkiny” taste. It is excellent to serve to a group of pumpkin pie enthusiast and not so much pumpkin pie enthusiast! I have been making this pie for the last two years. It is a hit for family dinner and also every party that I have brought to. Thanks Cindy!

My first pie recipe and it was wonderful!
I only had one slice leftover from my Thanksgiving day dinner!
I added toasted pecans to the top of one the pies.
Definitely suggest gently stirring the custard filling at least twice during cook time.  It helped set the filling nicely.
If you have guests who aren't too keen on pumpkin, this is a great pumpkin pie for them!  Not too sweet.  Not too pumpkiny.  Just delicious!

The ingredients were definitely enough for two pies.  The people that we were concerned about the most, were the one's that liked it the best.  I was asked twice for this recipe.  This one will be kept from now on as my pumpkin pie recipe.  The toughest part was melting the ice cream.  Very easy recipe.

This is a good, creamy pie. I used canned pumpkin but I think it would have been better with fresh. It wasn't quite as dense as we like but the taste was good.

This is a superb recipe. I used  fresh pumpkin. I made these for my sister birthday party and there were none left and all every one talked about where my pumpkin pies. If this recipe is followed exactly the way it is written;You will have two 9-inch delicous  pies. Thanks Cindy for the recipe

PERFECT! I won a pumpkin pie contest(thanks, Cindy!) with this delicious recipe - it was sooooo creamy! The best pumpkin pie recipe - this is the only one I'll ever use. By the way, I left out the nutmeg, just because I don't like it, but I'm sure if you like nutmeg, it would be great in it.

I found this pumpkin pie to be the best I ever had, especially since I don't really care for pumpkin pie.  I did like the taste results though but I think I may have added a little too much ice cream because my pies turned out kind of squishy.  All in all, IT was still GREAT.

This was soooo good!!  I only had enough fresh pumpkin for 1 cup, so I used 3/4 canned too. My Mom liked this so much I now am in charge of the pies for Thanksgiving! It did take longer to bake then the recipie called for. Any suggestions? Thanks Cindy!! Try Sue Case's pumpkin bread. It's the bomb too.

Excellent pie. I added A LOT of extra pumpkin and a couple of extra eggs, also added a teaspoon of vanilla and some cloves. My friend thought it was too airy and light but I thought it was just right.

My family loved this pie.  Much sweeter than the usual pumpkin pie.

This is an excellent recipe for Pumpkin Pie.  I added a bit more spice, since I tend to like my pies a little more spicy.  I added 1/2 tsp. of pumpkin pie spice, and it came out perfect.  I used fresh pumpkin, well not exactly.  I couldn't find fresh pumpkin, so I used acorn squash.  I find it comes out smoother if you process it in a food processor, and then strain it before adding to pie.  Any winter squash will work.

This pie was so smooth and creamy!  I think, however, my taste buds were really expecting more vanilla flavor and were a tiny bit disappointed.  Now that I'm excited about a pumpkin pie with a touch of vanilla flavor in it, maybe I'll add a bit of vanilla extract next time.  This was a FANTASTIC recipe and was loved by all who ate it!  THANKS!!!  I will definitely be making it again and again!

Oooh...  the softened ice cream...  pure genius!  I cooked the pies on my weber grill right after removing the turkey.  Done in about 30 minutes on the barbeque---GREAT FLAVOR!  (used fresh pumpkins)
