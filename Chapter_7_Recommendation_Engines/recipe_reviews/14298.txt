I needed 1 cup of French dressing for another recipe and didn't have any in the fridge.  I found this, tried it, and LOVED it.  I used it in my recipe and on my salad for lunch today.  I used cider vinegar and whirled it in the blender until completely smooth....I was really happy with its thick consistency.  It took about 5 minutes from start to finish and is better than ANY bottled version.

Ok, let me just say before I start, I find it irritating when people don't follow the recipe exactly and then rate that recipe based on the results of their tampered with creation.  On that note I followed this recipe to the "T" and it was o.k., a little to ketchup-y for me.  My son liked it. . . as a stand in for ketchup on the side of his steak, he is four:-)

This is awesome!!  I use homemade red wine in place of the red-wine vinegar, and you're right it is fantastic that way.  Thanks for sharing.  I will make this often.

I followed this recipe exactly...no changes whatsoever. I will have to keep looking. This dressing is okay, but WAAAAYYYY to vinegary. As in that's all I taste. I will try again with a different vinegar, but for now, this one is just "ehh"...

This recipe is really good, but I found it was very vinegar-y.  I made exactly the way it is written and used Red Wine vinegar instead of the white vinegar.  I ended up having to add about twice the amount of ketchup to offset the flavor of the vinegar though.  I will probably half the vinegar next time, but was very impressed overall!!  This was the first time I made homemade salad dressing and am in awe as to why I have been buying it all these years!!  YUM!

I'm off today, so inbetween cooking, I'm trying to catch up on my reviews. (the kids monopolize the computer) I made this dressing two weeks ago which I actually used, with a packet of onion soup mix as a marinade for chicken pieces. It was delicious! So much cheaper to make your own!

This was certainly quick and easy to make, a pretty good, but had a little too much "bar-b-que" taste for me...I'm still looking for the perfect recipe!

When I was a teenager, a local restaurant made their french dressing from scratch, and I loved it. This recipie is the closest I have found to it. Splenda is a great sugar substitute for this recipie.
Very good, and easy to make, why buy dressing?

I love this! The only thing I might try next time is to use a shallot instead of an onion to make it a little milder. This reminds me of the house dressing at Arlington Steak House in Texas!

After all the great reviews, I had to try this recipe.  Much to my surprise was nothing of what I expected.  Ii tasted like bar-b-q sauce.  I'm giving it 3 stars because I did used it as a bar-b-q sauce later and it was pretty good.

This is a wonderful replacement for the bottled stuff! I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil. I prefer to taste before adding sugar, and once I tasted it, opted to withhold the sugar entirely. I used a ketchup without the high fructose corn syrup!!

Wow!  Perfect French dressing flavor!  I've never really been a fan of storebought french dressing but I really liked this.  I made it using the white wine vinegar and am looking forward to trying it with red, balsamic, sherry, and maybe even cider vinegars.

Delicious!  I love the sweet french dressings and this is fabulous.  I used the red wine vinegar and a blended oil.  As my 2 1/2 yo might say "Tasty Tasty!"

I made this exactly as the recipe states and it was absolutely wonderful.  I'm Australian and am not familiar with this type of French dressing but my husband is American and said it takes him straight back to his childhood and could not get enough of it!  I served it over a chopped salad (another throwback to his childhood!)

WONDERFUL .. and we hate French dressing.  I made it to be able to make another recipe "Baked Apricot Chicken".  It was so successful we've made it since just to have on salads!  Thank you

WOW WOW WOW WOW!!!!!  I just made this for the chicken dish I am cooking for dinner tonight, and WOW!  The recipe calls for french dressing, and I had no bottled dressing on hand.  I will NEVER buy bottled french dressing again!!!!  We are a family of onion haters, so I did leave out the onion, but substituted with garlic.  Added a little pepper, too.  I think from the lack of onion, the vinegar is a wee bit strong, but not much.  Maybe I'll try using 1/3 cup apple cider vinegar next time.  But it is very very tasty!  Try this recipe!  You'll never go back to bottled again!

I don't eat french dressing but made this for my SO. He said it has a lot more punch than the bottled french dressing, but he really liked it, rated it 4. I did love the ease in the prep. and it cost way less to make than the bottled so it's a win win recipe:) Edit: this dressing does not keep well at all, so use it within a few days or else it congeals.

Very good!  My husband likes Catalina dressing, and other copy-cat recipes have failed to impress him.  This one gets the nod!
I used onion powder instead of fresh, and regular white vinegar because I didn't have wine vinegar.  I did cut back on the sugar too, as others suggested.

Part of me feels that I must have done something wrong (what with all the good reviews), but this was pretty straightforward ... I found it terribly vinegary and overly sweet.

At first this dressing was a little sweet for me, so I added a bit short of 1/4 cup more vinegar, and 1 tsp fresh ground black pepper.  I think this would make an excellent barbeque sauce/marinade.

I found it to be a great change with great flavour and a bit of a zing.  Last year I made a bunch of bottles of this dressing for Christmas gifts, and everyone thought it was wonderful.

I made this and let it sit in the fridge, it seperated a bit, but i whisked before serving.  It makes a square gladware full, but was well used in a taco salad and a recipe off this site called cranberry sauce chicken with onion soup, cranberry and the dressing.  both are weekly recipes.

This was yummy, and very easy to make. Just threw all the ingredients in a mini-chopper. It is sweet though, so if you are not partial to sweet dressings as my father wasn't, then you may not like this one. I loved it and so did most of my guests.

This is really good if you like russian dressing or the western french dressing. I am not really into the really dark french dressing, I like the oarnge creamy french. I wil have to admit that this is the best dark frnch that I have ever tasted. But since this is not my style I will not make this again

Seriously so easy and so good. I used regular vinegar as that is all I had. I also just used onion powder.  I added a little garlic powder. It was wonderful and I didn't even need to measure the ingredients, this seems like a no-fail recipe!

I doubled this recipe but only used 1/2 cup sugar total (1/3 of what is written in the recipe). It was still very sweet and very delicious. Fantastic recipe, just adjust the sugar to your taste.

Yum Yum, this was really good but I have to give it 4 stars because the recipes calls for too much sugar. Remember ketchup already has a lot of sugar so I  would cut it back to 1/2 cup.  I will use this recipe again.

Easy to make.  Chopped my onion finely and just used a shaker jar which worked well.  Next time will cut back on the sugar, maybe try honey.

I found this was way to sweet!  I wound up adding more ketchup, more worcestershire sauce, minced garlic and salt.  Much better after the tweaks.

It was 10 minutes before dinner and I realized I had no dressing for my salad.  I quickly found this recipe - it took no time to make and it was great!  I think it would've been even better if I'd let it sit in the fridge for a while beforehand, but I needed it ASAP.  Everyone loved the dressing and my husband said he preferred this recipe over the store-bought stuff.  A blessing in disguise that I ran out of dressing, or I probably wouldn't have found this recipe.  Thanks - I will be making this one again!!

I had run out of French dressing one night and searched for an acceptable substitute. I was leery of this recipe because of the ketchup base (the dressing should be orange, not red) but it turned out virtually identical in colour and taste to the bottled brand I buy. I used white vinegar as that's what I had on hand. I will use this from now on, thank you!

followed the recipe to a tee and found it to be not too vinegary but too sweet and had to add more vinegar. i will continue to make this with some revisions!

I made this recipe for a taco salad. I only needed a third of the amount - and this recipe did wonderfully when adjusted to just make 1 cup total. My husband also said he liked the dressing. So- this will be one I'll make again!

I made this recipe just like it said. It was not good at all. I have another recipe that is similar to this one that calls for equal amounts of ketchup and sugar. This makes it take like French dressing not just ketchup and vinegar. Try adding the sugar it is much better.

My husband challenged me to find a good French dressing after reading what's in the store-bought stuff and I looked here first.  According to him (I'm not a French dressing fan) it's better than store-bought although next time he asked me to use less sugar (I halved the recipe but it still called for a lot of sugar).  I was pleased I had everything in my pantry!  Thanks for the recipe.

Nice recipe.  I doubled everything except vinegar and sugar (used about 1 cup).  It was still a little to sweet for my taste, so I added a dash of cayenne pepper, more Worcestershire and some onion powder.  Next time I will only use 1/2 cup sugar and add if more is needed in a double batch.  Thanks.

This was great - because I love sweet red french dressing and because it was so quick and easy to put together.  The red wine vinegar gave it nice deep red color, although I really enjoy it made with cider vinegar, too.

I love this recipe - almost.  I do not like Worchestershire sauce so I add a little salt instead, and I use less sugar - about 1/2 cup - and add a little more ketchup.   And I add a few tablespoons of vegetable or canola oil to make it smoother and less airy.

Very good, make it early in the day or day before so the flavors marry up.  Now that's French Dressing.

This is a great recipe for french dressing and really hits the spot if, like me, you live in an area which doesn't sell it!  My 5* rating is based on following the recipe exactly as it is written.  It is easily adaptable to suit personal tastes and the preparation time is so minimal, it's easy to make this dressing at the last minute.

Tastes sort of like Kraft Catalina.  Scaling down to 4 servings was good for a family salad.  Served over lettuce with bacon bits.  I used 1/2 t. for what would have been 1/8 of a small onion and mixed by hand so it was easy to make with easy clean-up.  The amazing thing was that this dressing caused my 2-yr-old to eat salad.

Great! Just like Betty's Dressing that is sold in Ohio and Michigan. Can't buy it in Florida so I was happy to find it.
It's very easy to make.

I read a review of this by Amber where she recommended it with Taco Salad II instead of Catalina dressing. I recommend it, and I'll certainly be trying it with more than Taco Salad. Very effortless to make.

This is an awesome french dressing did not change anything except for the vinegar used just plain white because I did not have any white wine.This is better than most french dressings I have had when I go out to eat! Will be using this a lot!

I love this dressing. I use it for taco salad & it really complements it. I usually mince the onion & just shake it up in a jar or bottle. I also use about 1/2 c. sugar rather than the 3/4 c. in the recipe. Thanks for sharing it Maggie.

This is a good recipe.  I found that the ketchup makes a huge difference in the finished product.  Our favorite is Kroger's PS Organic.  Also, I use less sugar than the recipe calls for and onion powder rather than fresh onion.  A standard on our table!

My son really loved this. It was a tad sweet for me and also I could really taste the onion and vinegar. I used cider vinegar as I did not have white wine vinegar and also used olive oil instaed of veg. To be honest I did not give it a chance to chill. I whipped it up while supper was cooking. I'll try it again tomorrow and see, but I would prob. reduce the vinegar,onion and sugar next time.

Not sure what to make of this one... it was okay/pretty good, but something was off.  I think the onion and vinegar was a little much, and I would have liked it to be a bit creamier.  Seems great for experimenting though.  After I tried it 'as is' I added 1/2 tsp of black pepper, dry mustard, and garlic powder.  That helped a little, but I would probably try another recipe on this site if I were too make homemade French dressing again.

Good starter! Here are my changes (for 12 servings--approx 1 cup dressing):
1/3 cup ketchup
1 Tbsp sugar
slice of onion
little less than 1/4 cup red wine vinigar
1/4 cup oil
1/2 tsp paprika
fresh ground pepper

Yummo!
