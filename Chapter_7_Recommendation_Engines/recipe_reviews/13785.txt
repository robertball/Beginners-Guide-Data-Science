This is a moist and delicious bread.  I used raisins in place of the nuts.  If you are looking for a classic pumpkin bread - look no farther.  This is the one.

I agree with the above comment.I wish that I had thought to read the reviews before I made it. It is good and served gladly for my breakfast a few days. But it lacks a sort of zing. Morespice and maybe a bit more brown sugar. Like the person above said it's a good base. Gives room for personal taste to govern.

I am so frustrated!!!!  I spent a lot of money to 4xs this recipe and right now it has been in the oven for over an hour and half and it is still not done!!! This is the second batch we already had it mixed to do the second batch or I wouldn't have made it again.

What a disaster! The recipe is a nightmare!  You absolutely need to make two loaves---it will not cook in one pan.  I wish I would have read other reviews before baking this mess!

The WORST bread recipe I have ever made and I bake two or three times a week. I should have known when the dough's consistency was too runny and there was WAY too much. With all of the other great pumpkin bread recipes out there this one isn't even worth trying to salvage. Just use another recipe.

Absolutely the worst bread recipe I've ever made.  No flavor (I added spices to the recipe), didn't bake thoroughly.

I agree with some of the other reviwers that this recipe needs seasoning.  That being said this recipe is GREAT for being a blank slate.

I tried this recipe out one day when I had brown sugar, but no white sugar and really wanted pumpkin bread, and it has been the best recipe Ive come across so far. I did modify a little, adding spices (cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, allspice). This is the second time I've made it and this time I substituted chocolate chips in for the nuts and it is even better! Next time I'll do both. I also cooked it in a 9x9 pan, and had no problems with it not cooking evenly.

This recipe definitely requires the use of spices to improve it.  So I added some cinnamon, allspice and bit of fresh grated nutmeg.  In addition, I used pumpkin pie filling, instead of pureed pumpkin.

I aslo added walnuts and raisins to the mix.

I found that the recipe was too much for one loaf pan so I dumped the whole lot into a 9x13 pan and cooked for the 45 mins to great results. It was very moist and had a light, cakey consistancy. 

A decent base recipe, but requires tweaking to improve taste.

The recipe says to cook this bread for 40-50 mins, but my bread has now been in the oven for an hour, and no where near being done. I should have read the reviews before making it. It is simple enough to make, but I probably should have split it between two pans. Maybe it will still turn out okay if I leave it in longer, but it's probably gonna burn before it finishes in the middle.

I loved this recipe.  I changed the walnuts into chocolate chips (okay almost 2 cups :).  It did take almost 15 minutes extra in the oven (I'm assuming it's my altitude)  and I made sure to let it cool for 15 minutes in the pan.  Stayed moist for 3 days...until it all disappeared from my kitchen.  Was really yummy!!!

I used this recipe to make some pumpkin bread for my husband this morning. It is definately moist! I used a bit more pumpkin than called for, and less milk, added tons of nuts, and even stirred in some pumpkin pie spice. I have a convection oven, so when I thought it wasn't going to get done in time, I turned the convection fan on. It turned out fine, and even though it has been a few hours, it is still moist and delicious! This is a quick recipe that took no time to prepare, and I am certain my husband's construction crew will give it rave reviews!

I also think this is the WORST recipe I have ever made. The bread came out all swiveled and did  not rise at all, and I used very fresh, just opened baking powder. I give these to my neighbors at Christmas, and had to throw away all 12 that I made. What a waste of money and time. People should make sure they have a HIT before publishing it on this web site. I got one for Zucchini Bread and Banana Sour Cream Bread and they were delicious. Too bad and shame on you for telling us this recipe was terrific.

This was the blandest pumpkin bread I have ever tried.  I added cinnamon and raisins and nuts to the second batch and it didn't make a difference.  The reason I tried it again was because of the butter and thought it might be different, but it was heavy and thick and flavorless.
