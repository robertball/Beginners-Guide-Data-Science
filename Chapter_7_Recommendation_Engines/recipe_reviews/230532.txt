I made this 3 days ago. It was so tasty and so easy. I had about 40 pieces so I had to adjust the seasoning and vinegar. Cooked for 2 hours  The only thing I would do differently is add table salt.  We ate with and without hot sauce. Thank you for the recipe. I am not a good cook, so I appreciate when things turn out right.

Classic pigs feet recipe. I was happy to see the celery and vinegar.  Cook this, classic pigs feet recipe at your next cookout and watch them disappear. Now a favorite recipe.

It turned out perfectly for me. The only thing I did different was that I cooked it in the pressure cooker. It was so tender and flavorful.M y husband loved it. I served my pig's feet over white rice with black beans.I will post my pic soon
