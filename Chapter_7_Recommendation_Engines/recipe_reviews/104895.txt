This recipe is a genuine, 100%, must have in your recipe file!  My boyfriend was looking for a chicken recipe that featured lime flavours.  WOW - did we find it.  Absolutely fantastic served with a spinach salad featuring strawberries, mango, red onion, pecans and feta cheese.  Great summertime meal.

This was a great surprise.  I was looking for a recipe to use up fresh spinach, and this turned out to be excellent.  I served it with a side of pasta with ratatouilee, and together they made a very nice meal.  Don't skimp on the lime juice, since you want the limey sauce from the chicken to flavor the spinach.  Yum.

I think this is a great base recipe, but could really benefit from some vegetables or something integrated into it rather than over a salad. I haven't come up with something else quite yet, but I'm definitely going to try this one again.

Excellent! Could have used a little more garlic and a little less lime, but we loved the flavor anyway (and we love garlic a lot). My roommates don't like spinach, so I added French cut frozen green beans (thawed them with hot water and drained them first so they wouldn't water it down) and served it all over rice. Yum!

Very delicious! I used all fresh ingredients and it turned out very nice. I also added some sheddred cheese to top it off!

This was absolutely delicious.  The night before we were going on vacation, I had this defrosted chicken that I wasn't sure what to do with and I saw this recipe.  It was easy and delicious!!!  And I ate the leftovers on the road the next day!!!

This was pretty good. I added cucumber and tomato to the spinach. Next time I will try broiling the chicken to give it some color.

Very good taste.  Next time I plan to add cheese and toasted nuts but it was really good just as the recipe is written.

Great, easy recipe - especially for hot summer nights. Also would make a great lunch. Next time I'll have fresh lime to squeeze on top.

Great way to use my leftover chicken and baby Spinach. I loved the flavor - some feta cheese would have been a nice addition.

My family loves this recipe as is! Sometimes we'll use lettuce and add cherry tomatoes to it, but most often we leave the recipe alone. The garlic really adds to the flavor, so donâ€™t skimp out on it.

Very bland.  I checked the recipe three times after my family gave it a unanimous thumbs down.  Tasted like diet fare.
