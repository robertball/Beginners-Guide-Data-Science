This was very, very good, but I did make some changes.  I prepared the marinade exactly as written, but I marinated the chicken pieces for about 5 hours, which was perfect.  The tzatziki sauce I had to alter:  I substituted lemon juice for the vinegar and added a teaspoon of dried dill weed.  I served this as sandwiches, with pita warmed on the grill, sliced red onion and tomatoes.  Completely yummy!

This recipe was amazing!  We rarely please all three of our picky children with any recipe, but this one was loved by all.  We marinated and grilled not only chicken, but pork, salmon, zucchini and yellow squash.  Everything was absolutely yummy in every way.  The addition of the tzatziki sauce was like the icing on the cake.  We made a slight change of the addition of a touch of fresh mint in the tzatziki, and it was amazing.  I'm a person who likes to know why you do what you do in recipes sometimes.  My husband informed me that letting the tzatziki sauce chill for at least an hour after making helps the vinegar in the sauce break down the other ingredients so that they can combine.  I'm glad to know this, because I will never rush a tzatziki again.  The sauce was so simple and delicious, as was the marinate.  Thanks so much for sharing!!!!

I live in Minnesota so I will not be able to dig out my grill until May.  I decided to cook the chicken on the George Foreman grill.  It turned out wonderful.  I made a few minor changes in the Tzatziki sauce.  I used a good Greek yogurt but wanted it extra thick so I strained it through a coffee filter.  After grating the cucumber I put it in a strainer with a hefty pinch of salt and let the water come out.  I then put it on paper towels and squeezed out any remaining liquid.  Instead of vinegar I used fresh lemon juice as the acid. I added 1/2 teaspoonful of dill weed and a small amount of fresh mint.  I believe Tzatziki sauce would be good on a flip-flop.  Thanks, Bakermom.  This is a fantastic recipe.

4 stars for the marinade. Followed the marinade recipe exactly, and the chicken was good, but next time I will probably increase the lemon juice and oregano for our tastes.  We would have liked a little more intense lemon and oregano flavor, so increasing those two things and maybe adding some lemon zest along with the juice would do the trick, but as written was still very enjoyable.  Tzatziki sauce as written not so good, so only 3 stars. A little bland tasting with a strange mouth feel. So, I did take some reviewers advice and altered it slightly by using lemon juice in place of white vinegar, a pinch or two of both dried dill weed and sugar, and an extra tbsp of olive oil to give it a more creamy consistency. Lastly, after grating the cucumber, spread it on several sheets of paper towel, lightly salt and let sit for about 15 mins to allow all the moisture to be drawn out of the cucumber.  Then dry thoroughly with more paper towels before adding to tzatziki. Doing this will prevent your tzatziki sauce from becoming overly watery. I've tried making tzatziki several times and with the adjustments this was my best attempt by far.  I think the pinch of sugar to cut the bitterness of the yogurt and the additional olive oil to give it a better mouth feel were key. Thanks to the original poster of the recipe and all the other cooks out there who wrote reviews and added suggestions.  I love this site!

I put in about three cloves of garlic and like to use malt vinegar rather than white vinegar and about table spoon.  It gives it that extra kick.

This turned out amazing. Since I live in rural Japan, I don't have access to Greek yogurt so I just used plain yogurt and added some lemon juice and white pepper to it (taken from another recipe) and it tastes almost as good as actual tzatziki.

This is good.  BUT....It is imperative that you let the cucumber drain well before mixing into the yogurt.  I even squeeze it to remove even more liquid.  You will be amazed at how much there is!  It keeps the tzatziki from being so thin and also concentrates the flavor.

For my taste, I would double the lemon juice and garlic and oregano as I like really bold flavors. Also, the lemon juice helps tenderize the chicken. I also let it marinade over night so the lemon juice has time to do its job and the flavors really penetrate. For the sauce, I would add a step, after grating the seeded cucumber wrap in a paper towel and give it a good squeeze to draw out the extra moisture. If not it will leach into the yogurt making it a watery mess. I also prefer lemon juice to white vinegar but i saw where someone recommended malt vinegar, i may give that a try. And most importantly you need to add a good teaspoon of dried dill weed or mint. I prefer dill. Finally warm a pita or any middle eastern/ indian flat bread by brushing it very lightly with good olive oil and placing it on flat griddle or heavy skillet for a few seconds and servce with a big greek salad with lots of tomatos, cucumbers, black olives, feta cheese etc. and you have a summer barbeque feast sure to make you forget about hambergers and hot dogs with chips.

I've made this at least 3 times already and we love it.  I marinate the chicken all day - at least 6 hours.  In the sauce I like to add extra cloves of garlic.  Very good and super delicious!

Loved it! I Marinated the chicken overnight. The sauce was easy to make. I added veggie kebabs and couscous which only added a few minutes to the cooking time. A complete meal on a budget.

Good seasoning.  Very tender chicken.  I made it inside under the broiler on a grill pan.  I added just a little sugar to the tzaziki.  
Would make this again.

Easy and delicious. I marinated the chicken overnight. And if you make the tzatziki the day before, it tastes better.

It needs a little fine tuning but overall is quite good. Cut your chicken in long strips for ease in grilling. I actually don't cut my chicken until it is cooked & has rested. I make my sauce with half Greek yogurt & half sour cream to cut a bit of the tang. Try a peeled English cucumber; you won't have so many seeds to deal with. We go to a local Greek Festival every July and eat delicious authentic Greek food made by the members of a Greek Orthodox church. They also serve fresh baked baklava. If you ever get the chance to attend one of these Festivals it's worth your time, effort & $$.

Marinated overnight - EASY and DELICIOUS!  My husband is a very candid food critic and as far as chicken goes, he likes thighs. Period.  But, we are trying to lose weight and eat healthier.  I couldn't believe it when he said he LOVED it!!!  I think I'm still shocked.  DEFINITELY use high quality greek yogurt.  Bought a cheaper brand and threw out the first batch of sauce.  Much better with Chobani.  If Yoplait made plain greek yogurt in large tubs, I'd buy theirs.  The cheaper brand had a "powdery" texture.  Yoplait has VERY creamy texture but I can't find the plain in a large container.

Wow! I loved this chicken. Mine was very flavorful, but that being said, my plans changed and it ended up marinating a day and a half. I served with store bought tzatziki cause I was feeling lazy, so can't review the sauce. Served in naan bread with diced red onion, tomato and feta for my family to build their own sandwich. The chicken was the best part if dinner! Made Greek Orzo salad to accompany.

This is very, very close to how I make this dish.  I use a Greek spice blend rather than just oregano, and I drain my cucumber well before adding to the yogurt.  I also add a bit of fresh dill to my tzatziki.  We love these.  They are soooo good served on warm flatbread!

I made this twice and this Souvlaki is just awesome. Very easy and simple marinade but tastes fantastic. My husband and I enjoyed this recipe greatly. The only thin I moderated is that I added more garlic, oregano and lemon zest just because I like bold flavors. This recipe is a KEEPER for sure!

Good recipe.  The marinade was great, the chicken came out very flavorful but slightly dry. This may have been due to the size of the chicken pieces.  I will try larger pieces to see, next time.  Also I agree with LYNNINMA about the tzatziki sauce, to replace the vinegar and add dill. Delicious.

This was the daily recipe email, I had time to buy the ingredients and I served it that night.  Loved it!  The chicken was very tender and the sauce came out perfectly.  I didn't alter anything. Next time I will triple the chicken and marinade because there were no leftovers.  It will be perfect for company and it will be added to my rotation of meals.  I served it with a big Greek salad and some naan from Trader Joes.

The chicken turned out moist and delicious. Everybody in my family loved it. The sauce I changed a little by substituting vineger to lemon juice and added chopped mint. My 14 year old son never eats yogurt, he ate sauce with chiken and finished it with crackers. Now I know how to make teenager to eat yougurt.

This chicken was very good, it was moist and flavorful, also made the sauce with just a bit of fresh dill. We had this with Naan and a tomato, olive salad. Thanks  for this great recipe. I marinated the chicken for about 4 hrs, I would not go any longer than that.

We thought this was very good.   The only change I’d make is to marinade it overnight for additional flavor.

Works "right out of the box" as they say.  No fuss, no muss.  I made the extra effort of letting the chicken cubes sit in the marinade overnight, turned out even better.  The chicken was so tender it was nearly falling off the skewers after I'd grilled them.  Fantastic recipe. Thanks!

This is a keeper for sure!  Made it exactly as called for.  Was probably in the fridge marinating another hour or so, but that was because I made the marinade and tzatziki at the same time.  Grilled some onions and served with flatbread, shredded lettuce, diced tomatoes, lemon and hummus.  Delicious!!!   July 2017 - We continue to be delighted by this fantastic recipe and make it throughout the year!

The chicken is great, I make it frequently.  If you let it marinate for 24 hours the chicken is so tender and juicy when you take it off the grill. 
I use a slightly different recipe fort tzatiki sauce, but this one is pretty good, just be sure to drain some of the liquid out of the yogurt otherwise it is too watery; I set the yogurt in a coffee filter in a large mug in the fridge for several hours before making the sauce. It is even better if you make it the day before so the flavors really blend (I put fresh dill in mine so the combination of the dill and cucumber  really mix after a day).

This was so easy to put together, and was a big hit!  I marinated for about 3 hours, and the chicken had already started 'cooking' from the lemon juice, so I probably wouldn't go much longer than that - but it tasted fantastic.  I used a different tzatziki recipe - as another reviewer suggested, draining the cucumber is essential.  I mixed the grated cucumber with some salt, and let it sit in a bowl for 15-20 minutes.  Then I drained through a fine-mesh sieve and squeezed as much water out as I could.  I used regular yogurt, drained through a coffee filter for 30 minutes, instead of Greek yogurt (that's what I had on hand), and also added some dried dilll, though fresh dill would be even better.  Left out the vinegar and olive oil, and added some black pepper.

I served the chicken on some pitas, with the tzatziki, black olives, sliced onions and tomatoes.  Yum!

I love tzatziki sauce.  Soooo good.  I added more lemon and oregano to the marinade.  Make sure you squeeze the moisture out of the cucumber with paper towels.

I've made this recipe many times and the whole family loves it. When I'm short on time I marinate for a half hour and it's still wonderful andWe have to double the recipe on the tatziki sauce because we once we dip the souvlaki chicken pieces in it, we crave it for the next few days: on cucumber slices, on sandwiches, on burgers and more. It's a favorite that we return to again and again.

loved it. The sauce was perfect to me other than I added a TSP of dill to the sauce. I prefer the vinegar to lemon, lemon seems to over power the taste. To each their own preference. I am sooo happy I double the batch, I like to dip rice crackers in it as a snack. 
Thanks for sharing, it's fabulous.  Server with Greek salad and pita.

Not only is this recipe easy to make, it is delicious and healthy!!  It takes a little planning to let the chicken marinade and the sauce flavors come together but it is absolutely worth it!  (And I also let it marinade all day as some other reviewers mention).  Chicken is juicy and flavorful, and oh the sauce!  My boys and I were practically licking the sauce from our plates.  Thank you for a great recipe - we will use the over and over again!

Delicious! Based on other reviews, I added an extra clove of garlic to the marinade and sauce, used English cukes, and grilled the whole tenderloin on the skewer. We lived the marinade and the fresh sauce complement. Thanks

Great as it is!  So often I read reviews where people give a recipe a rating but they have also changed a bunch of stuff.  Don't waste your time on changing this.  It is wonderful as is.  Only had one hour to marinade and it was still great.  Moist, tons of flavor, and really nice with the sauce.  Going into my go-to recipe collection.

I used pork tenderloin stripped lengthwise,full milk yogurt, and a mix of lemon juice and tart orange juice in the marinade. I also added a drop of mint extract and marinated overnight in the refrigerator. I spiral wrapped the pork strips around the skewers,Sprinkled the kabobs with a pinch of coarse sea salt, wrapped the exposed wood in metal foil and broiled them in in my oven  broiler, turning once to brown evenly---The gates of heaven opened widely.

My husband and I love this stuff!  Made the recipe exactly as is, except used the oven broiler instead of the BBQ grill because we're still in the dead of winter.  The tsatsiki sauce is to die for ... Will make again to serve with pita bread.  A friend who owns a Mediterranean restaurant says the tip is to squeeze all/most of the water out of the cucumber. Before adding to the sauce.  This recipe is delicious all around!

This recipe was great! Easy, fast, and delicious. No modifications necessary. I was only able to let marinade for 45 mins or so but still tasted amazing. It's winter and freezing here so I dumped the whole bag of chicken and marinade in a frying pan. Once the chicken was cooked, I took off the liquid and turned up the heat to brown the chicken. Every time I rotated the chicken I spooned some of the sauce back in the pan. Came out juicy inside and crunchy on the inside-just perfect! Everyone had seconds.

Loved this! I followed the marinade recipe for the chicken, although I doubled it for 3lbs. of meat, and grilled it per the instructions for about 8 minutes per side. Came out moist and SO flavorful! I did not follow the tzatziki recipe as we usually use one with lemon juice and mint instead.

Ryan, Caitlyn, and I really liked this chicken.  Brianna and Matthew...no.  However, I think it will be better next time.  The skewers didn't work well and the chicken wouldn't turn so that we could get good grill marks, so Ryan ended up sliding all the chicken back off the skewers and pan fried the chicken.  It ended up more steamed/sauted than grilled.  Next time use wider strips of chicken and then try to grill.  Bet it will be much better!

This is for all intents a good and easy recipe, and there are many worthy suggestions in the Remarks from obviously qualifies kitchen mavens. But aside from looking most features of this recipe, I can add just a few notes that will hopefully find root with some of you. One item: I notice that in all the reviews, not a single mention of a Greek spice called Cavender's that is incredibly versatile and a true staple for meats, veggies of all kinds -but especially for Greek-inspired dishes such as souvlaki. Try adding at least a teaspoon to your meat as your marinate it... and even sprinkle a little on during the cooking. Also (2) I enthusiastically echo the suggestion of another contributor who suggested using thigh meat in lieu of breast meat. It's much moister and noticeably richer in flavor. Because of the way the thighs are butchered, they take just a little more creativity to set up on the skewers, but the results are gratifying.

I have made this twice and followed the directions exactly. The first time was better,the chx was def more flavorful. The only difference was the first time I used chicken tenders and I cooked them on the George Forman grill. The second time I used chx breast and used the outdoor grill. I marinated them for about the same time. The recipe is very tasty and my husband liked it very much. I put the chx in pita's with lettuce ,tom, diced cukes and the sauce. The sauce was ok, I took the advise of draining the heck out of the cucumbers. The sauce was not runny at all.I did add dill to this. My husband liked the sauce better than I did. I did not add as much vinegar but it still had that strong taste. I would probably make this again as the chx was pretty good. the sauce only so-so.

Made this last night per the recipe and found it to be excellent. The tzatziki sauce was the only thing i felt lacked something. Being french Cajun I added chile powder to give it some zip but upon reflection I think a teaspoon or 2 of dill would have been a better choice. But my fiance and I liked it alot!

Followed the recipe exactly as is and it was wonderful!  The chicken was flavorful and the tzatziki sauce was great.  Ate with flat bread, tomatoes, red onion and lettuce.  Great dinner and will make this again!

Great Marinade recipe! I have made this (marinade only) a few times now, and every time, it is just perfect. I've used both chicken breast and pork tenderloin and got rave reviews. I always make way too much, so that I will have leftovers for the next couple of days. I do usually add a little more garlic than it asks for, but that is just because I like it extremely strong.

This is really delicious, I let my chicken marinate overnight. I made changes to the sauce: After shredding the cucumber I salted it lightly and then squeezed out the extra moisture through a few coffee filters. I also used lime juice instead of the vinegar, doubled the garlic and added fresh cilantro.

This was very good. The Tzatziki was a lovely cool contrast to the chicken. I did add mint to the sauce and a pinch of taragon to the chicken marinade.

So delicious! I made this twice; earlier in the summer for my family who all loved it, and then again when some relatives visited us from abroad. It was a hit! The chicken marinade is really perfect; thank you for such a great recipe.

This marinade is so simple and easy to make yet it adds great flavor and zing to the chicken!  Perfect for summer grilling. No changes to the marinade at all. I made my own tzatziki- very similar except I do not add vinegar or oil.  I do add one tbsp. of lemon juice, though.

We enjoyed this! Great marinade. I cheated a bit and used the new Oikos brand Greek yogurt dip (Cucumber Dill) instead of making the homemade sauce and I served these on whole wheat pita. Next time I will make the Tsatziki sauce as I missed that garlic flavor in the storebought Greek dip. Thanks!

We LOVED this! I marinated the chicken for a full day before cooking, which really gave it a lot of flavor. Also, I added a bit of fresh mint from the garden to the sauce, which took it over the top...a definite keeper~YUM! Thanks for sharing. ;)

Prepared exactly as shown in this recipe and it turned out fantastic.  I served in Greek Pita Flat bread with Tzatziki sauce and chopped tomatoes, cucumbers, a little red onion, and feta cheese.  The family LOVED it!  Yum!

This recipe is definitely a keeper!  It was so delicious!  Instead of breast meat I used thighs.  I grilled some mushrooms, garlic cloves, and onion wedges and served it with a blend of quinoa, chia seeds, and wild rice.  It was so easy, and it calls for ingredients we always keep on hand.  Wonderful recipe!

Excellent! Followed marinade recipe exactly and let sit for 3 hours. So much flavor! The only thing I changed with the sauce was to use lemon vs vinegar because that's what I had. Kind if glad I did. Sauce was delicious as is, but I did add a little dill after tasting. Not because it needed it, I just put dill in everything. Made Greek potato salad as a side. Really, really great recipe. Been picking at the leftovers all day!

This recipe was a big hit! Made it with no alterations to the ingredients. I marinated it longer then suggested. The chicken was so tender and moist. Served it with Greek salad and rice. Some filled their flat bread with salad and sauce, others with just chicken and sauce. Everyone loved it!  I will definitely be making this again.

Followed the recipe and found it to be perfect Summer fare.  Next night I used the leftovers to make a salad with romaine, peppers,green onions, tomatoes and celery. Used Tzakziki for dressing.

Yummy. Even better than store bought souvlaki. Loved it. I let it sit for a day in the marinade. Tzatziki was great too.  Maybe next time I'd do a little less oregano and salt but that's personal preference. It's great!

Both the marinade for the chicken and the dipping sauce are delicious, healthy, and so easy! I was unable to grill it outside and used a George Foreman grill instead, but it was still excellent. My teenaged daughter has asked that I fix it again for next week. Next time I’ll have pitas on hand, too.

We've made it twice. Grill is not working so this time we put in air fryer. Turn out great. Preheated at 350 for about 3 minutes, cooked 15 minutes one side and 8 mins on the flip. Left it in one piece to be easier to handle.

I marinated the chicken for 8 hours and the only flavour from this recipe came from the tzatziki sauce. Recipe was followed exactly, save a longer marinating time.

I wish I could give this recipe ten stars. We eat it at least once a week. The chicken is moist, flavorful, and delicious. I've marinated it as long as nine hours (when at work) or just an hour if I'm in a hurry. Either way it comes out perfect every time. I like to serve it with rice.Trader Joe's avocado tzatziki is a great substitute if I don't have all the ingredients on hand for homemade tzatziki.Thanks so much for sharing!!!

I loved this recipe and so did my husband.  The only change I made was to add more salt, pepper and garlic.

Good, easy recipe. Marinaded overnight and made 1/2 inch chicken strips to skewer and grill. Tzatziki sauce is excellent and also easy. I also subbed lemon juice for vinegar.

It was ok, not bad, but dry. The marinade itself is dry, so if you're planning to eat it without any sauce like we did, I don't recommend it.

I made this recipe and marinated the chicken for 24 hours. These were the best Greek kabobs I have ever had and I am not the most skilled grilled. This recipe is a winner.

I love this recipe! It’s perfect for summer grilling. I made a cucumber tomato and feta salad to go with it along with some pita bread that I grilled. It was a hit with all my cousins who were visiting that day.

I make this often and it never fails me.  I love the fresh flavor.  I always have these ingredients on hand except maybe the cucumber so it's an easy last minute meal idea. I usually serve with basmati seasoned rice and store bought naan.  Yum. Or it works well for keto diets. Trade the rice and bread for a Mediterranean salad.

The chicken is Soooo very delicious.! This is a big hit with my family. One thing I would mention. Once you are finished grating the cucumber make sure to squeeze out liquid before adding to you sauce mixture. This way it won't end up loose.

I loved this dish!  i added a little marjoram to the  chicken marinade mix.  Also i didn't use skewers for the chicken, i have this grill pan i used. We  ate the chicken in pita pockets with tomatoes, onion, and cucumber slices, of course with the tzatziki  sauce.  mmmmmmmmm so good!!

Excellent and true recipe for souvlaki. Made this exactly as stated. Very flavourful and a hit with my husband. Will definitely use this as my go-to recipe for souvlaki. Thank you for a great recipe.

We love these easy chicken kabobs!  I also add a little muddled fresh mint to the marinade.  Make sure you soak your skewers if you have wood/bamboo ones.  Every grocery store carries them.  I serve it with Greek style couscous, also found on Allrecipes.  Rave reviews for this dinner which is simple to prepare and impressive enough for a dinner party.

Wow! I was blown away by the flavor of these kebabs! Only change was I used boneless skinless thighs because they're more forgiving and I was cooking for company. I always try to hedge my bets when feeding guests!

We liked this. I cut the chicken into strips, marinated then cooked it in the broiler. I served the chicken rolled up in pita bread with cucumber, red onion and tomato then slathered with tzatziki. For the tzatziki, I did as others did & grated then drained the cucumber, used lemon juice instead of vinegar and added 1/2 t. dill weed & 1/4 t. dried mint. Will make again.

I used the exact marinade recipe for boneless skinless chicken breasts.  Marinated for two hours, because we were having dinner guests and I did not want the flavor to be overwhelming.  We then grilled them over a medium heat for about 8-10 minutes per side.  The finished product was so delicious, moist, and had a very good Greek flavor.  I love Souvlaki, & I hope to make the actual kabobs next time.  Yummmm!

Absolutely delicious! Don't have a grill so I cooked the chicken on the stovetop and I added about 3/4 tsp dill to the tzatziki sauce but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. Served with a greek salad and some lemon seasoned green beans. Definitely a dish I will be making again.

I marinated for almost 24 hours and then grilled over charcoal.  I would suggest serving with warm pita, sliced tomato and sautéed onions.   I doubled the sauce because we like a lot of sauce.  To make the sauce I seeded the cucumber and pulsed in a food processor, squeezed out the water.

The marinade didn't add that much flavor to the chicken. However, the tzatzike sauce was good, and we'll make it again.

It was raining yesterday and I couldn't bbq, so I fried the meat instead. It was just as good. My family thought I ordered the food from a Greek restaurant.  Lol.  I can only imagine how good it will be on the bbq... I vacuum sealed the marinated meat and refrigerated it, so today it is in the freezer, waiting for a nice bbq day.

Very tasty but a bit dry. Lots of tzatziki sauce helped. I BBq'd it so perhaps that dried it out a bit. I will try it again though.

Really like this recipe!  It is a bit of time consuming due to the preparation of the marinade, cutting up the chicken, letting it marinate, then skewering the chicken, but well worth the effort.  The only suggestion I would make is to drain the grated cucumber as well as possible before adding to the remainder of the dip ingredients, using either a clean towel or paper towels to prevent the dip from being watery.

Probably one of the best recipes we’ve pulled down from the site. Wish I could say more but four chicken breasts were gone before I had the chance to say “how was it”? Simple, easy to make and a new menu item in the house.

I most assuredly will make this again. The only thing that was changed is that I added some onion and green pepper strings on the side. We then cut pita bread in half and made more of a gyro out of this with some extra sauce. I also cooked it on a flat iron grill instead of an open flame.

Awesome! Will amend after all have eaten and provided me with their input on the meal! The family loved the chicken in warmed pita bread. The Tzatziki sauce always goes well with Greek meals, I also grilled the veggies just enough to get it charred and still have a bit of crunch. Thank you for the meal ideas and future grill outs!

This is a great basic recipe that can be embellished based on taste. I didn’t have cucumbers and I was too lazy to go to the store, so I substituted avocado finely chopped. Also, I used a bit more garlic than the recipe for a bit more zing.

Super traditional Greek flavors and well-received by family members.  I used pork tenderloin instead of chicken, as suggested by the recipe contributor and it was fabulous!  I did substitute lemon juice for the vinegar as recommended for the sauce.  I also salted and drained the cucumbers--thanks everyone for that suggestion.  I cooked it inside on a large griddle and this worked well.  6/12/18:  made this again for company--charcoal grilled this time-- and served with a Greek Salad and Lemon Rice Pilaf.  Everyone loved it!

LOVED THIS!  I did nothing different at all!  The only thing I would do differently is allow it all to marinate longer.  I made this when I got home from work and even then it was pretty good.  Next time...marinating overnight!  :)  This was good and my biggest critic (husband) loved it!

We were tired of buying open faced souvlaki salads at restaurants for $13 @ salad. So, "all recipes" is where I came to for a 5 star recipe. We followed this Greek chicken recipe exactly and it's fabulous as is.  My friend never had  tzatziki or Greek yogurt and now just loves it!  Thank you for cutting the cost to under $5

I liked it but many of the ingredients, like the lime, were missing in the end.  It was good.  If I make it again, I won't bother with the lime.  The sauce was pretty good.  I used a fine cheese grater to grate the garlic and cucumber.  Flavors really mixed well.

This one is a keeper. I made the marinade as written but threw in a pound of chicken and a half pound of lean pork because that was what I had.  I also might have upped the garlic a bit as I put in a teaspoon of previously minced garlic rather than chopping a fresh clove... I served it on naan bread with romaine, tomatoes, onions and more cucumber slices. Like several others, I used lemon juice for the vinegar and added mint  in the tzatzaki.  Delicious!

This was good but I only needed about 5 minutes per side on the grill and I chilled my sauce for over an hour for it to set completly.

This was so good and easy to make! Made recipe exactly as written. Served in GF pita pockets along with tomato and lettuce. Will add some onion to the pitas next time. The sauce was good, but seemed to be missing something--could be because it was bit runny. Next time I'll make sure to squeeze the liquid from the cucumbers before making the sauce. Will definitely make recipe again and again!

Delicious and so easy to make. The pairing of the  sauce and the chicken is wonderful, both very tasty. My kids love food on a stick so this chicken will be made again in this household.

The Chicken was excellent and easy. The Tzaziki sauce was good but seemed like it was missing something. It wasn't bad, but it needs more flavor.

Still the best recipe for Tzatziki that I have yet to find. the flavors for the Souvlaki are right on point as well. Why bother overpaying for takeout when you can make it yourself?

My husband and I loved this recipe.  The only thing I changed was the sauce.  I went with other's suggestions and substituted lemon juice in place of vinegar and added dill.  I served it with naan bread, lettuce, tomato, and diced onions. Will definitely make again!

Amazing recipe. My entire family loved it. Made it twice this week! I had the butcher cut the chicken into cubes so there were nicely trimmed and even shapes and sizes. Highly recommend it.

Amazing!! We made it with pork and used onion, zucchini, red and yellow peppers, and mushrooms on the skewers. We used lemon juice instead of vinegar and left the peel on for the Tzatziki sauce. So good!

I grated the English cucumber (did not strain it) and mixed it with the yogurt, then worried that it would add too much liquid to the sauce.  No problem.  It was fine.  I used lemon juice instead of vinegar and added dried mint to the sauce .  Perfect!

Have made the chicken part of this many, many times and we love it!  I add a bit less oil than it calls for and eyeball the other ingredients, but it is gobbled up every time I make it and there are never any leftovers no matter how much I make!  We pair it with cut up peppers, BBQed on skewers.  Fantastic to freeze and take camping!

I have made this recipe a couple of times and my family loves it.  I made it last year as an option for a Mother's Day BBQ, for more healthy conscience people not eating ribs. All 6 pounds of the chicken were eaten right away. I went very well with a kale and quinoa  side salad that had clementines and toasted pecans mixed in it.  Now that summer is fast approaching I will be using it again. The tzadziki sauce is great. The chicken marinade is fast and easy. I do let it sit overnight for best flavor. Today, I'm trying it with legs and thighs for a change. The only thing I changed was making much larger portions.

Delicious! If you leave the marinade overnight the chicken gets better. I added a little more salt and vinegar to the tzatziki sauce as it was a bit blend.  Great for kids who love to dip!

I made the souvlaki as written and marinated for 5 hours. With the tzaziki I made the following modifications based on other reviews: subbed lemon juice for vinegar and added dill and 1 tsp sugar. Also let cucumber drain and then pat dry with paper towels before adding to other ingredients. Kept in fridge 2-3 hours before serving. It was  the best tzaziki sauce I have had.

Really good chicken recipe. I used the broiler to cook the chicken and get a little color on it. The sauce was a bit lack luster and I will use a different recipe for that next time.

Wonderful easy recipe!  I made it using chicken and pork and cooked it in a convection oven on 350 for about 15 minutes.  This is a dish I would be happy to serve to guests.
Tip:  If you use wooden skewers, rub them together as you would chop sticks to remove splinters and smooth the wood, then rub with olive oil.  The meat comes off easily!

Great recipe. But like other reviewers I ramped up the marinade ingredients for stronger flavor. Lots of dill, lots of oregano and a lot of fresh garlic. I used the juice from 2 lemons, olive oil,  plenty of salt, pepper and some red pepper flakes for spice. I also used boneless chicken thighs that I cut into about 2 inch pieces. Thighs have much better flavor in my opinion. I let it marinade about 10 hours. I made it all that morning and put it on the grill that night. I'll make this frequently.

This is grrrrrrreat!!! I followed the recipe to a T, and it was absolutely delicious! Thank you! The reason I gave this a 4, not a 5 is because there is something missing in the tzatziki sauce. I can't tell you what because I have no idea — it was very good, but there was something missing. Maybe an ingredient, or maybe it needed more of an ingredient that was already there? Either way, I'll be making the sauce and the chicken again.

I don't have a BBQ so I baked this instead of grilling.  I thought the chicken was a bit dry and not so flavourfull.  Next time I will add more lemon  juice, oregano and garlic to enhance flavour.  Not sure what I could do to make the meat more tender.

I made this chicken as stated in the recipe. I put it on pitas the first night that I made it. I was afraid the garlic would over power the chicken but it was a nice blend of flavors. With the left overs that I had, I warmed the chicken and put it on a good hoagie roll the next day with some cheese and the sauce. Also, this was very delicious!

I loved this. My chicken was marinated for 4 hours and I like garlic so I threw in a couple of extra cloves.  The chicken was delicious.  I took the advice from other reviewers and added some dill weed and substituted lemon juice for the vinegar. The only thing I would do different next time is double the tzatziki sauce as it was so delicious my family of four finished the six ounces and were scraping the bowl for more! Thanks for sharing the recipe!

I broiled the chicken bites and served with the Greek Vegetable recipe found on this site.  Tasted just like the dish I got at a local Greek restaurant.  It's relatively easy, too.

We did this the easiest way possible, and it was awesome. 2 chicken breasts, hammered flatish. We made the sauce just like it says, but added extra lemon and oregano. We marinaded it for almost 1 hour - we were hungry. We cooked it in a cast iron skillet over the stove, and topped it with tzatziki that I got from the olive bar at the grocery store. Fantastic. Easy.

I followed the recipe exactly. I agree with others that the chicken would be more flavorful if marinated a few more hours, but it was still good as is. My tzatziki sauce tasted very strongly of garlic, so it's a good thing I like garlic! For my side I roasted sliced green bell pepper, tomato and a sweet onion with some olive oil, salt, pepper, and a dash of dill. Thought about making some rice, but in the end I just served the veggies and chicken over a bed of salad greens with the sauce on the side. A delicious healthy meal. I should make more of these. Thank you for the recipe, especially the sauce.!

I made the marinade.  It is excellent just the way it is.  I also made it again with some fresh oregano… and that was wonderful too.  I cut up tomatoes and onions and marinated them in Greek salad dressing for toppings which worked out great.  For the tzatziki sauce, I confess that I bought it already made so I cannot comment on this recipe for the sauce part of it.

This was amazing.  I made a couple changes to the marinade.  I substituted a Greek seasoning (basically oregano, salt and thyme) for the salt and oregano called for.  I also added ground sumac.  I sliced the chicken and marinated it overnight using all the marinate ingredients EXCEPT the lemon.  I added the juice of two lemons about 2 hours before I cooked it.  I had to sauté the chicken because we don't have a grill.  My only change to the Tzatziki was to add a pinch of sugar.  Served in toasted pitas with onions, tomatoes and lettuce.

You can make this in the oven with great success.  Put your prepared skewers on a foil lined baking sheet.  Bake in a pre-heated 450 degree oven for 15 minutes,  flip over and bake an additional 15 minutes.  (Optional broil for 5 minutes after.)

I doubled the marinade and also added smoked paprika for some extra color and flavor. 2 hours in the fridge.

Cannot comment on the sauce as I used Traders Joe's tatziki.

So I made these with very little expectations for their taste. I was surprised by how tender they were. I marinated them for 6 hours instead of 2 and doubled the amount of marinade. I served them with homemade pita bread, this tzatziki sauce, greek salad, and rice.

Absolutely LOVE this recipe for the chicken marinade and sauce. Both very flavorful and delicious. To make this a meal, I served it with pita, sliced tomato, sautéed onions and spinach. Will definitely make again!

My husband requests this at least once a month. It tastes like something you would get at a Greek restaurant! I don't change anything in the marinade recipe, except to double it and marinate for 5-6 hours. I follow other's advice and use lemon juice instead of vinegar in the tzatziki sauce. It's really really good! My picky 5 year old loves the chicken! I serve it with some naan bread and lemon flavored Jasmine rice.

Excellent recipe. I only made the marinade portion following the recipe exactly. The only change was to replace the dried oregano (I didn't have it) with a mix of spices for grilling chicken. Will make again.

This was amazing! Added some fresh dill and a little lemon to the tzatziki - other than that, followed the directions and it turned out perfect. This was my first attempt at one of my favorite Greek dishes, I was afraid I wouldn't do it justice. But this recipe is on point!!!

I just tried this recipe and thought it was delicious. I made it exactly as specified, but let it marinate for an extra 30 minutes. It was very juicy and flavorful.

This recipe was right on the money. I like when food, that I make, ends up tasting just like it does at a restaurant. This one was perfect. The only things I added were about 1/4 tsp. each of dill weed and black pepper to the sauce. I placed it on grilled pita bread and served it with diced tomato, cucumber, red onion, and romaine lettuce. Next time I may add some feta cheese for a little extra flavor. AWESOME!!!

An excellent yet simple dish. It leaves you filling full and content without being miserable, I used chicken tenderloin and grilled on indirect heat for a longer duration before searing over the coals. It's now a family favorite that is often requested.

Oh my gosh! This was so good! I took people's pointers about doubling the lemon juice and oregano. The chicken was excellent by itself but adding the sauce was even better. Finally, we topped it with some feta and so amazing. Next time I'll be stuffing some pitas with it. Let me say this is so good, its as a good a some of the greek places I've been.

This is amazing! We make this all.the.time. Even planned a summer dinner party because of it. You must make this, you will not be disappointed. The tzatziki sauce is everything. After a couple times of just grating the cucumber right in to the sauce I took many posters suggestions and grated into paper towels which i then used to squeeze out the excess water. This extra step will make a bit of difference it seems to the water-y sauce; keeps it creamy. Well done!

The chicken in this recipe was amazing!  I don't know for sure if I was able to marinade for the full 2 hrs but it turned out great anyway.  I didn't have plain yogurt in the house and no time to run and get some so will have to try the tzaziki another day.  Can't wait to make this again!

The whole family loved this recipe! ... even picky teenagers. To cut down on the fats, I did not add oil to the marinade or the yogurt sauce. We didn't miss it a bit. I used frozen chicken breast pieces, put them in the marinade, and let them thaw and marinate in the fridge for 24 hours. Skewering and grilling took only a few minutes. We had a delicious dinner in minutes .

I didn't find the meat to be flavorful, it was good and juicy, we did grill it. The cucumber sauce (Tzatiki sauce) needed more cucumber and the tartness of the greek yogurt was still more than we cared for. I served it over romaine lettuce dressed with fresh veggies and pickled olives and peppers to give it a flavor boost.

This recipe is fantastic!   I've made it twice and added an extra garlic clove to the marinade and also the sauce.  As others suggested, I added a little fresh dill, chopped mint and 1/2 tsp. sugar to the sauce.  I served it in pita bread with the sauce, onion and tomato.  It's now one of my favorite recipes, as well as being one of the easiest.  It was just as good broiled as it was on the grill, maybe even better.

Fantastic recipe! Great flavor. The chicken skewers would be good even without the tzatziki sauce. But the sauce makes them amazing.

Fabulous recipe but to help keep the sauce thick try draining the cucumber by wringing it out in cheesecloth.  This tip was passed on to me by a Greek chef in Victoria, BC some years ago.  Thank you George.

Very good. Do let the cucumber drain well or you will have runny sauce.  Next time I think I will just do chicken "fingers" and skip the skewers.  But will be making this again!

Phenomenal. I added extra oregano, olive oil, garlic and lemon juice, and salt and pepper, to the chicken. I added lemon juice and dill to the tzatziki, as well as about triple the garlic and some sugar. We ate this in pitas with cucumber, tomato, red onion and spinach. So good, we all had seconds, and my 4 year old even wanted a second helping! Thanks, it's a keeper!

This recipe is excellent as written and after a delicious meal was consumed, it went immediately into my "must keep" folder!   Very very easy to make.   I marinated the chicken for about 4 hours and the sauce was combined and refrigerated for about the same amount of time.   The marinade has a wonderful tenderizing effect on the meat and it's very flavorful.   Be sure to really squeeze the juices out of the cucumber shreds.   WE LOVED IT!!   If you love chicken gyros, this could easily be thrown into a pita with some sliced tomato, onion and the sauce and it would be amazing!!!

Fantastic.  I made the whole thing and will be making it again this week.  The chicken by itself and eaten cold, is divine (moist and so flavorful)   I plan to use the chicken itself it as a salad topper.....I better make a double batch!!

This is super keeper!!

Came out really nice only if make adjustments as recommended by others on here. The chicken came out nice but the 2nd day was very tough. I served with grilled veggies and buttered rice. I think also sprinkle some lemon juice and little oregano on the chicken right off the grill like the Greeks do. I am a rookie in cooking and thus came out pretty tasty.

I don't know why I keep trying my hand at making anything with white meat chicken. I am not a fan of white meat chicken, Whenever I make a chicken dish , I always use dark meat. But, I tried this recipe. The marinade was great especially with the tweaks I made thanks to the other reviewers, the sauce not so much...but I'll keep trying with it. Thanks to all who reviewed and made suggestions! It helped a lot....I made chicken salad with the leftovers and the mayo helped with the dried out white meat chicken. Next time I'm sticking with lamb for this marinade.

This was fantastic!  I did it as written and it was a hit in my house.  Followed the recipe exactly.  I made brown rice with it and had a veggie.  I also had pita, tomatoes, and red onions for those that wanted it.  Is on the keeper list.

We absolutely loved this recipe.  It tastes just as good if not better than my favorite Greek restaurant.   I am a garlic lover so I added additional garlic in both the marinade and the yummy Tzatziki sauce. I served it with a simple shredded iceberg lettuce salad, Italian dressing and flat bread to dip in sauce. I doubled the recipe for the Tzatziki sauce so there was plenty to dip chicken and flat bread. It's a delicious, healthy meal!

This was GREAT! Very easy recipe and the meat was so tender after just 3 hours of marinating that it was falling apart as I was putting it on the kabob.  sauce was very good and easy.  My son age 6 and daughter age 2 ate it up and they are picky eaters! I will definitely be making this again.

We have this regularly at my house. For the sauce, however, I add 1/2 an avocado. I also squeeze lemon juice to taste (instead of the vinegar). I also add extra garlic.

My husband and I both loved the chicken. He preferred to eat it without the sauce - he said he felt like it distracted from the already great flavors. I, however, loved it with the sauce.

Made this for the first time last night and oh boy was it delicious. I have added it to my list of recipes that will be on permanent rotation in our house. I did tweak the tzaziki recipe and left out the cucumber and added some dried dill to give it a little more kick. My boyfriend hates cucumbers and is so excited that I can make him fresh souvlaki with a homemade tzaziki, cucumber free.  That just means more cucumber for me! Great recipe. Super easy. Thanks for sharing.

I did not make the chicken from this recipe, but I did make a variation of the tzatziki sauce.  Although this recipe did make a decent base for the sauce, I did change some things and it tasted pretty close to the sauce I've had in Greek restaurants.  I added about 1 tsp. of lemon juice and about 1 tsp. of fresh oregano.  I also had a dried spice blend on hand that contained shallots, onion, garlic, lemon peel, chives, and orange peel.  I added about 1/4 tsp. of this and it really gave it the boost it needed.  I personally do not like greek yogurt so I substituted the same amount of light sour cream instead and it was delicious.

We love Greek flavor profiles and this fit the bill!  I made the marinade as is, but, let it marinade overnight for extra flavor.  I served on Mediterranean pita bread with a Greek pasta salad.  I will definitely be making again.  UPDATED 7/23/17 Love this recipe!  I tried it this time only marinating it a few hours and it still was tender and had great flavor.

I used 1 pound of chicken tenders and reduced the amount of olive oil in the marinade to 3Tbsp, added an extra clove of garlic but kept the other ingredients the same. Marinated chicken for about 3 hours.  Cooked on the George Foreman and it was very moist and tender.  I only added a dash of olive oil to the tzatziki instead of the full tablespoon and squeezed out the excess liquid from the cucumber before adding to the sauce.  Served with Grilled Vegetables with Balsamic Vinegar also from this site.  Great meal!

Oh....my....goodness!  I made this tonight for the first time with relatively minor changes.  I substituted lemon for the vinegar in the tzatziki and added some dill and paprika.  I did use more lemon than the recipe called for because we love lemon at my house (my youngest considers it it's own food group!)

I marinated the chicken for about 24 hours and served it with hummus, pita bread, feta, cucumbers and tomatoes.  It was to die for!  It's going in the regular rotation.  I'm going to try making it with steak too!

This is excellent!!  The only suggestion I have is. When making the tsatsiki sauce to squeeze the water out of the cucumbers and  use a hand grater to grate the cucumber. Chicken was really yummy.  I did grill some onions to go with it.  And made grilled balsamic zucchini to go with it!!!!

This was delicious! The tzatziki was really good using the recipe but I added another garlic clove as we love garlic. I live in Argentina  and have not found Greek yogurt yet, I used firm yogurt and it was fine. The chicken was perfect, definately worth five stars or more.

Excellent recipe!! I changed nothing and couldn't think of anything that I would change here! OK yes, I'd made more next time!! The chicken was tender and delicious... the tzatziki sauce was perfect!! It'd been awhile since I'd had some and that was in a restaurant. I tasted it and I'm sure it was better than that. Since I was BBQ'ing anyway, I threw some tomatoes on (whole) and served it over white rice. Right now I'm wishing I had some leftovers of that!!

It was a great starter to a great meal. We accompanied the meal with whole wheat pita bread. Will make again.
