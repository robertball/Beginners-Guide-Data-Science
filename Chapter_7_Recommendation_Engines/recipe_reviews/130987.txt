WOW, this was delicious. Per a suggestion on the recipe exchange, I made this into a french toast recipe by making standard french toast and topping it with the pecan, cheese, and pear mixture. I was suprised how wonderful the flavors went together. Thanks so much, will make this often.

Very yummy!  It was a bit hard to taste the brie under the apples and cinnamon (which I didn't really measure, just sprinkled, so maybe I'll use a bit less next time).  You could use any type of cheese with this - a sharp cheddar would go nicely and would have a strong enough flavor to taste.  Instead of sourdough bread, I used a homemade sweet bread.  My husband loved the sandwiches (although wants it for weekend brunches instead of dinner) and my wee ones inhaled the apples.  I'll definitely be making this again!

Delish!  The combination of flavors is great and I like the sourdough bread (it's a tougher bread and it doesn't get soggy after the warm apples are placed on top).  I found broiling it melted the brie nicely. A keeper!  Thanks.

If you use sweeter apples, you can cut the sugar down to about a tablespoon, added once the apples are cooked, and adjust cinnamon to taste. While good, this creation has so many calories from sugar and butter and cheese that it's definitely a once in a while treat rather than something to serve everyday.

This is a great recipe.  I use ciabatta rolls for the bread.  I think I would make this every week if I had my way, but for the family I control myself.  I did get ahead of myself the first time and thought the apples didn't have enough moisture, so I added some apple juice.  Big mistake, it made them very runny and not easy to eat, so now I am more patient and the apple turn out perfect.  Very happy I found this recipe.

This recipe is INCREDIBLY easy and nobody who eats it can tell!  It takes all of 15-20 minutes to make, including peeling the apples.  This is the type of dish you get for $15 at a nice restaurant.  Absolutely loved it

Very yummy! I added some sliced grilled chicken breast to make it more of a meal. After I lightly toasted the sourdough bread, I added 3 slices of brie, then the chicken then the cinnamon apples/pecans and popped it in the oven for a few minutes. Kids and hubby all loved it.

Really tasty! I used a baguette and cut out the extra butter used for buttering the bottom of the bread. Messy to eat, but totally worth it.

Good, but I think I'd nix the sugar if I made these again.  I like the combo of the brie with the apples but the sugar is too much for me.  My brie melted, but it was still good. I think I'll have the apples separately,maybe over pancakes.  Thanks for the recipe!

I love this recipie. I make it as an appetizer for parties...although it is not a good one to transport cause it is best served warm and fresh. I use a whole block of brie and more slices of bread...but stick to the same amount of apples...when making it for four or more. Thanks for this awesome recipe!

Delicious! Every few bites you get a good taste of the brie, without it being overpowering.

Will definitely make again (like maybe for brunch on Sunday).  Was looking for a meatless meal during Lent and not sure how I stumbled across this recipe, but so glad I did.  I had Fugi apples on hand so used those instead of a tart apple.  Because of that, I cut the brown sugar down to a little less than half of what was called for and the cinnamon to half.  Since I also had some ciabatta bread I wanted to use up, I did not go the sourdough route.  I did not butter the bread before broiling and it came out great.  My daughter and I decided we could easily get $10/sandwich in NYC.   Highly recommend.

Made recipe without any changes.  Delicious.  This was more of a breakfast meal though and we will be having this for breakfast not dinner from now on.

I made this awhile back and forgot to review it.  What a treat these were!  And they save well for leftovers too.

Wow! Just made and ate this tonight. Was looking for something to bake while snowed in here in Upstate New York. I had the ingredients, so gave it a try.  I didn't divert from the recipe. My husband and son raved about it. Will be making this again.... snow or no snow.

Just made these for a snack to watch the game......fantastic! Honestly you can't really screw these up. For people who can't taste the Brie, add more to each slice of bread. I love Brie so I added thick slices and topped with some of the mixture. No one complained that they couldn't taste the Brie but did say they couldn't really taste the apples. I just scaled down the next time on the cheese on a couple. It's all about finding the right mix for your tasting. Thanks for sharing, it will be served at my next wine and cheese party!

DELICIOUS !  Made as appetizer on baguette, even the boys loved it.
