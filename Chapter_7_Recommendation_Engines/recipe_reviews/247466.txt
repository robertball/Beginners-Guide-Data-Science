Delicious and easy! I actually used bone-in chicken thighs and cremini mushrooms instead of porcini. It took a little bit longer to cook, but nothing major. The chicken has a great flavor and would go with just about anything (I served it with oven roasted potatoes). Easy enough for a week night dinner too! Thank you!
