8.16.19  This may not be the prettiest side dish you’ve ever put on the table, but it may be one of the tastiest.  I used Maldon® Sea Salt Flakes which were simply superb on these green beans.  Took out of the oven at 15 minutes because they were done, starting to brown and shrivel, and I was a bit concerned what another 5 minutes would do to them.  I’ve roasted a lot of veggies, but never green beans, and I certainly won’t hesitate to make this recipe again.  Thanks for a delicious, easy new recipe!
