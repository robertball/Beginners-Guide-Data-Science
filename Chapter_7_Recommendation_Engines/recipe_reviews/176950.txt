This is not a good mix of flavors.  It can't decide whether its an appetizer or dessert!  I made these for a progressive dinner (as an appetizer) and nobody ate them!

This was a creative take on an empanada.  The banana flavor is very subtle - I added a hint of cayenne pepper for an added kick.  Served with jalapeno jelly.
