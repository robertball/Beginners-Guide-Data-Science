First off I made the serving size to 4 which made the ingredients list all weird, but followed it as best I could.  I didn't have any parsley - which didn't matter.  But what I did do, was put all the seasoning into the cream before I boiled the vinegar (which didn't boil) but got really hot.  I thought I had messed it up because the eggs kind of cooked scrambled, but I whisked in the cream real quick.  It was so so good, I hate hard boiled eggs - This was a great Potato Salad I'll be making this again

I don't know why the unkind review but I think this recipe sounds wonderful and I plan to try it very soon. The sauce is basically homemade mayonnaise, which is delicious. I don't see how you could go wrong with a recipe that contains real cream, it has to be rich and creamy. Only thing I would do is add some chopped hard boiled eggs, I gotta have them in my potato salad. Also, I will make this the day before so it's icy cold.

Super good!! This does not deserve bad reviews BUT you need to realize it is for the most part a recipe for homemade mayo and if you don't like the ingredients you won't like the end result. Personally I didn't change a thing but I am a fan of homemade mayo. The sugar suggestion is good if you like a milder flavor. Also no need to boil the vinegar since it only needs to be hot enough to cook the egg. And yes it will appear scrambled for a bit. I did continue to cook mine after adding cream etc. to get the consistency I wanted as well as blending the flavors a bit more.

I am giving this 3 stars, but the potential is there to be a 5. It needs some tweaking.  First, the vinegar did not boil(i don't know if this is essential). Second, it needs salt and pepper, and i think more onion.  Lastly, needs to be creamier. Pouring this hot mixture over hot potatoes just absorbs.

The texture was awesome but the vinegar is overpowering. I was going to throw it out but decided to try adding sugar. It made a huge difference. I added about 4 Tbsp.

Amazing potato salad! I was very skeptical at some of the ingredients when I was making it, namely the vinegar and the egg. It all came together wonderfully though! I wasn't making it for any gathering, just for us to have around for side dishes. I probably should have known to cut it in half; it made a lot! Due to some of the ingredients in it, I was reluctant to keep it more than a few days.  I will definitely make this again. It would be great at a summer potluck.

Great base! I beat 3 eggs into the vinegar and then hard boiled 2 more to chop and add later.  I also added chopped celery and topped with chopped green onion. I will use this again!

Wow, I was hesitant to make this because my family has a "standard" for potato salad (grandma's recipe).  However, its still a secret and hasn't passed to my generation yet, and I wanted potato salad now.  I dare say this is better than the family recipe, and it hasn't even finished cooling yet.  I think next time I would add a bit more mustard and cayenne, since I like things with a little zing.  But this recipe is delicious and I'll definitely use it again (at all non-family functions).

OK, but definitely not great.  I think it would be a good idea to list the region of the US that each reviewer is from.  People from the west coast, generally, prefer different food types, flavors, heaviness, etc, than those of many different regions.   This recipe was quite vinegarry.  If you like it, I do think it is a regional thing.

My family loved this recipe.  I added some crumbled Turkey bacon and chopped sweet pickles.  Yummy.

It tasted ok but I think it had too much cream-or my potatoes didnt absorb enough. I added hard boiled eggs, dill pickles, more onion and left the potato skins on.  There really isnt any color--I would add celery if I had some.

I really liked this potato salad! The homemade mayo was good and a keeper for other recipes. I made  2 additions,  added hard boiled eggs to the salad and a little bit of sugar to the dressing.
