excellent!! I was looking for a basic muffin recipe, that I could add to anything I had on hand (chocolate chips, dried fruit, nuts etc). This one is perfect! The only modification I made was 2 cups of flour instead of 1 3/4. Also, I made a batch following the instructions carefully, and another batch where I mixed the 2 eggs with the sugar, butter and vanilla all together, then added the milk, then the flour. Both batches came out exactly the same- so no need to follow all those steps.. :). Muffins came out nice and fluffy, with a crispy top- just excellent! Will sure keep as a favorite! Thanks for sharing!

this is a great basic muffin recipe. i add 2 ripe bananas to give it more flavor ( plus the batter was kinda thin) probably about a 1/2 cup each of raisins, dried cranberries and walnuts and swapped the butter for strawberry applesauce to give even more flavor and make it healthier. Yum yum!

The muffins had a good taste, but the tops were soft and sticky, instead of firm and crunchy, and they didn't brown much, even though I had to extend the baking time 15 minutes.

This recipe was simple and delicious! I followed the recipe exacty except that I did not use an electric mixer at all, I just did it by hand. I also added blueberries which added a nice little flavor! I will be using this base recipe again, thanks!

I loved these! I added a teensy bit more flour to thicken the batter a bit more to my liking and also added a little ground cinnamon...but wow! I will definitely make these again :)

These muffins were quite good.  I went with 2 cups of flour bc the mix seemed too runny.  I also added a little bit of lemon zest, some chocolate chips, and some sliced almonds.  Great for breakfast, which is what I intend to do with them.  I used large muffin pans and made 8 instead of 12, cooking them for 35 min. Perfect!

These were great! I followed the recipe exactly, and didn't have any problems with the batter being thin. I think next time I'll add chocolate chips or blueberries.

The recipe came out GREAT! This was a very easy to make basic muffin and they were very moist. Next time I'll add some blueberries.  I used 2 cups of flour instead of 1-3/4.

I don't think I'd make these again.  For starters, the batter is too runny.  The texture just wasn't correct in the end, there wasn't a fine crumb, just a rubbery feel to the muffin.  I had to extend the bake time, which I don't discredit the recipe for, as all ovens are different.  However, the tops remained soft and sticky.  It just wasn't appetizing.  The flavor itself was good for a plain muffin, but there are better textured muffin recipes out there.

I made it this morning and it is pretty good:)  I followed the other reviewer's advice to increase the flour to 2 cups.  I mixed all the wet ingredients then added the dry ingredients, and it still came out good.  I divided up to two patches--added chocolate chips to one and white chocolate chips and dried cranberry to another.  Both variations turned out good, but a little too sweet to my taste.  I will cut down the sugar to 3/4cup(or more)the next time if adding chocolate chips/dried fruits.  This one is a keeper:)

Very simple to make and very good. I made them yesterday and I followed the recipe except I added a little more than 1 1/2 cups of chocolate chips. It was the perfect amount. Very easy to make I am turning 11 and I made them haha.

I just made these for my family and my picky husband loved them!!  He not only liked that fact they were homemade he liked the taste and everything.  I always wanted to make muffins and this recipe is simple and easy to make.  I made just as it is.  Whoever had problems probably did not do it right.

I'm sorry but I found these muffins to be very dry and fairly dense.  There has to be a better standard recipe out there.

Batter was way too runny. I put in 2 c. flour after reading all the reviews. It was still too runny. Had a good flavor. Was heavier than I would like. They were ok.

These muffins were okay...I increased the flour to almost two cups and added a dash of cinnamon and almost a cup of mini chocolate chips.  They were done in 25 minutes.  I doubt I'll make them again.

OMG, these are amazing!!  For such a basic no frills muffin, they are so good.  I wouldn't even want to add anything to them  :)  We even had enough batter left after filling the large muffin pan to make a whole pan of mini muffins.
YUMMY!!

Wow, loved these muffins! I did make a few changes. I use cake flour in my muffins, so I used two cups of flour and added some cinnamon for variation. Great texture, light and moist. I only had to bake for 23 min in my oven but they browned nicely. Tops were a little crunchy. Awesome recipe. Thanks so much! I have been looking for a great muffin recipe.

Easy to follow recipe that can be used as a basic muffin and still allow for tweaking to personal taste.  I've taken and cut the flour to just 1 cup and added 1 cup of wheat bran, used 1/3 cup applesauce in place of butter, added 1 tbsp. cinnamon, and substituted brown sugar in place of white to make my basic muffin.  The flavor and texture is incredible, I've added blueberries to some,  Apples to some and pecans to others.  I don't think you can go wrong with this recipe.  Try adding your favorite fruit, nut or anything and try for yourself.

I usually don't bother to write any comments, but wow, I just wanted to thank you for sharing your recipe! It came out perfectly perfect! Crispy on top and very soft, moist and fluffy inside - can't believe I was able to do this at home! (I substituted butter to Crisco shortening and white sugar to brown suger for being health conscious.)
I look forward to adding fruits, nuts and chocolate next time?

This is a very good basic muffin recipe. I did use 2 cups flour per  others suggestions. I added pitted, halved cherries. Whenever I use cherries, I substitute almond extract for vanilla. I'm looking forward to trying this recipe with other fruits and flavors. Thanks for sharing.

They were ok.  They were more like a cake than a muffin.  My 17 year old liked them.  He said they were in between a cake and a muffin.

Really quite delicious. We followed the recipe to a T for all except the baking. We baked it at 150 degrees c for five mins less and they turned into a beautiful light gold brown top with a moist inside. Absolutely amazing with some strawberry jam or any fruit jelly. I was a little worried they might end up looking like the picture which looks rather burnt but with this adjustment they came out perfectly!

Delicious! Not uber-sweet, but sweet enough to be an unfrosted cupcake.

really good! I made a lot of changes, mostly due to my being short of ingredients, but I didn't add any milk, added about 1/4 cup more butter, doubled the vanilla, used whole wheat flour, and used about 1/4 cup less sugar. They still turned out excellent!!

Absolutely fantastic recipe!! I reduced the sugar amount into half and used coconut sugar instead. The muffin tastes very delicious, the texture is very smooth and my son loves it very much!! (For his batter I added raisins, and for my batter I added walnut!)

I followed the recipe exactly (except substituted half the butter with applesauce) and I LOVED IT! Will definitely make it again. It would also make the perfect muffin for adding things too (like fruit, chocolate chips, raisins, nuts or anything really!) Or just eat it the way it is!

I tried this recipe and it was very salty! I would've preferred no salt, it was not so much of a big hit in my family.  Added berries to hopefully sweeten it a little.

I found them heavy, dens, and rather tasteless. Personal preference is a lighter fluffier muffin. I won't try these again.

Great recipe like most people I went with 2 cups of flour and 1 teaspoon of nutmeg  and as a last step add 1 cup of blueberries.
This is now a family favourite and have passed on recipe to friends.
Thank you for the recipe

This recipe proved to be perfect. I was stranded trying to figure out what to make 3 toddlers for breakfast! LOL 

I ended up putting a squeeze of strawberry topping on the tops of the uncooked muffins before I put them in the oven. The topping sank to the bottom of the muffins, and was burning hot! But delicious once they were cooled.

I used 2 cups of flour. You can add a 1/2 cup of jam to change it up. It is a great basic muffin.

This is such a perfect recipe!, muffins are so fluffy that the paper cups fall by themselves (and no, it's not this greasy sort of fluffiness from over-buttered muffins). Thank you! :)

I was looking for a good basic muffin recipe I could alter according to what I have on hand, and this one is perfect. I usually skip the oil and add in some applesauce, two mashed bananas, and a cup of whatever other fruit I have on hand (we've done strawberries, blueberries, blackberries, and peaches). I find that with all that fruit, I can cut the amount of sugar in half. They turn out moist and delicious every time.

These are a good base recipe, a little bland even after adding cinnamon, raisins, zucchini, nuts, and a banana.  It also made 12 HUGE muffins.  Next time I'll halve the recipe and make 9 muffins out of it.

These are really light and melt in your mouth! The batter is pretty runny, but if you really let the beater fluff up the mix, almost like meringue, they come out airy and just sweet enough. I used an ice cream scoop to fill the cups to have minimal deflate to the batter.  I also added blueberries to half the muffins but the batter is so light they all sank to the bottoms of the cups, which is okay I guess, but next time I may do a quick chop on the blueberries to see if they will stay suspended in the batter a bit better.  Great with coffee!
