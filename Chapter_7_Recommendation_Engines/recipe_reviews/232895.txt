Terrific product. Made in ice cream maker so only froze the cream, vanilla and condensed milk to start and when that was almost solid, added the crushed cookies and crushed candy. It was a huge hit! Had to make it again. There were many unauthorized visits to the freezer.....

Didn't have enough Peppermint candies,  so I substituted a little Real Peppermint  Extract. Perfect!

Used a cuisinart ice cream vs. Putting and freezing in a pan. Wasn't quite frozen like ice cream coming out of ice cream machine so next time will try to make ahead and put in freezer before serving. Couldn't find the cookies (my son mighta got ahold of them!?) . Added a tsp of peppermint flavouring as well: which made a very nice flavour! Will try again closer to recipe but peppermint instead of vanilla flavouring.
