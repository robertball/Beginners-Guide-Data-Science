I used cod that was about 1 1/2 inches thick.  It cooked perfectly in 30 minutes.  We added about a 1/4 cup shredded cheddar cheese in the last 5 minutes.  My husband and I both said it was delicious!  Took 5 minutes to put together.

I dredged my cod into seasoned crushed tortilla chips and baked for fifteen minutes before adding the salsa. This was pretty good, but would have been a bit too bland for me with just the salsa. Thanks.

This must be a really good fish recipe if I not only ate it, but had seconds! I don't even like fish!

This is the easiest spicy cod!  I bought a bottle of medium spicy salsa. Pour it over the fish as per instructions and presto, an easy, low-fat, low-calorie, low-carb meal!  I don't even eat salsa, but was tired of cod the same old way and thought I'd give it a try.  Wonderful!  The only thing I did different was to melt cheddar on my portion, and my husband sprinkled parmesean on his.  Thanks Sara, I'm always looking for easy, healthy, different recipes to make!

Very easy...but the recipe calls for way too much salsa.  I couldn't even taste the fish.  It just turned into mush.  Next time I'll probably use about 1/3 the amount of salsa.

What an excellent idea!  I used a medium salsa verde and it was  just a perfect balance of spicy and bland.  This will make it easier to get my family to enjoy fish.  Thanks for sharing.

This was a truely simple, yet delicious dish.  My husband and I have committed in 2010 to eat out less and eat healthier, but we don't want to sacrifice taste or enjoyment.... This recipe is just what "the doctor ordered!"  :-)  We used frozen cod, so modifed the cooking time slightly (to match the directions on the package), and it came out perfectly.  Very tasty!

Five stars for pure ease of assembly, as well as taste.  Very nice to look at, and very tasty!  Be sure to use chunky salsa (I like mine extra-spicy).

Delicious!!!  

What I did was brush a bit of margarine on the bottom of the baking dish then sprinkle a little bit of salt, pepper and garlic powder.  Placed the cod fillet on top of that, then spooned on some Medium Old El Paso salsa (just enough to cover, did not over-do it).  Baked in the oven for 25-30 minutes, depending on the thickness of the fillets and voila!  AMAZING!!!

This was fast & easy!  Used about 1 cup of salsa.  Fish had great flavor and did not dry out.  Works well with Cod, Halibut, Haddock or any thick white fish.  Will make again.  Thanks.

Love this easy recipe but use haddock (our haddock is better than cod).   Also add Jack cheese for the last 5 mins. of cooking or a Mexican shredded mix. Make this a couple of times a month and never have leftovers.    A recipe does not have to be complicated to be good.

This was soo yummy!  Easy, easy, easy.  Hub even raved about it and he mostly only likes salmon and trout!!!  Only difference I did was season the cod with salt and pepper both sides before I added the salsa.  Thank you for this great recipe!

I had taken cod out of the freezer and needed to cook it. I found this recipe and decided it was simple enough. It turned out to be a very pleasant surpise. Instead of parsley, I used fresh cilantro. So easy, and so tasty. It took 2 minutes to prep. I'll use it again.

Very easy and tasty!  I brushed the cod with melted butter and seasoned with salt and pepper and then sprinkled crushed tortilla chips on the fish before adding the salsa.  Provided a nice crunch to contrast with the salsa.  I also used lots of chopped fresh parsley on top - very good!

Usually when recipes are listed as "easy," they aren't. They're anything but. However, this is borderline idiot proof.  I made no changes or substitutions and my husband hasn't stopped talking about how good this was.  I'm only disappointed that I halved the recipe, I should have made him get more cod!  I'll be making this again.

Very easy to make and delicious.  Added some olive tampenade which gave it a fabulous taste (you can use sliced green olives also).  Will definitely make this again.

Maybe I shouldn't have used hot salsa.  Likely would enjoy better with medium.  I baked on a bed of crushed tortilla chips sprinkled with cayenne pepper.  Which didn't help the heat rating.  My husband topped his with cheese.  I served this with tri-color corn pasta.

I'm often baffled by recipes that call for parsley when cilantro is clearly a better option. This is one of those recipes. Yep, this recipe is really easy, but it's also super customizable. I used regular store-bought salsa but  added a finely diced jalapeno, the juice of a large lime, a small pinch of Chipotle pepper powder, plus the obligatory fresh cilantro. I served it over Mexican rice with a side of black beans/bacon/cilantro. Husband wolfed it down. Thanks!

I used frozen sole filets - and this was great! So easy and good. Healthy as well! It took 30 minutes and the whole dinner was ready - fish, rice, salad and all.

So easy and delicious. Cod has little flavor so even my fish-hating husband liked it. I used Walmart's Lime and Garlic Salsa which gave it a zing for him but not too hot for me. Great on brown rice. Add zucchini and onions if desired.

How could I not give this a 5 star rating?  It was so incredibly easy and definitely covered any "fishy" taste in the cod I bought.

This is absolutely superb. My first review on this website. It was worthy of that. It was the most easily tasty food i every made. Almost gourmet worthy. I made spinach and rice on the side serving. If want it perfect then add chese on top the last 5 minute if the cooking. Great Job Sal.

P.S I am from Ethiopia and just decided to post how to make different authentic Ethiopian dishes. So fast and easy too. Hope there's interest.

thanks

I used a local salsa brand, somewhat less than 2 cups, 1 lb cod fillet and put some sea salt on it.  Served over brown rice with vegetables.  This was excellent!

This was very good! Next time I'll use spicier salsa, all I had on hand was mild.

Not bad.. I managed to talk hunny into trying fish tonite (he is NOT a fish fan). Unfortunately I couldn't get Cod so had to use salmon. He ate it all and said it wasn't bad but agreed to try it again if I got Cod. I will try it again, and hope it is better.

This recipe was ok...I served it over rice and found it pretty boring. The next day I used the leftover rice, and spicy fish in tacos...DELICIOUS! wished I'd thought of it the night before. I warmed it all up along with soft flour tortillas, topped with cheddar cheese and lettuce and it was fab! I will use this easy recipe again for spicy fish tacos, YUM! Thanks for the recipe!

We had picked up Cod and were looking for a easy recipe, had all the ingredients listed but my husband and I weren't sure about salsa and cod!  Oh my gosh - we loved it!!!  Actually ran out and bought more Cod 2 days later to have it again!  We put cheese over the cod at 20 min and let it cook for the 10 more.....can't say enough about this recipe!!

This IS really easy, it's cheap, and it has a lot of flavor for so few ingredients.  I used cilantro instead of parsley, but otherwise made as written.

I used only half the amount of salsa which was more than enough. It was just okay, but better when I put shredded cheese on top like one reviewer suggested. Super easy though, so I might make it again just for that reason. Maybe next time I'll try mango lime salsa.

I wasn't sure at first at it sounded so simple.  However after trying it, I was pleasantly surprised as how good it was.  I would think this would make a good recipe for fish taco's!  Thanks for posting...I love simple and good.

I only used one cup of the salsa, and I'm sure it would have been fine with 1/2 cup.  It tasted fine, but was soupy.

So simple and so good.  Easy to control the spiceness depending on the heat in the salsa, healthy prep and good taste, what more could you want for 40 minutes from start to finish.

I don't know if I'd really call this cooking, because it is so easy. I'm giving it 5 stars because it is DELICIOUS. We only get cod in our grocery store occasionally but I make this every time I have the opportunity.

I made a variation of this last night using catfish (we already had it thawed) and was really happy with how it came out. I omitted the fresh parsley (we didn't have any) and instead seasoned both sides of the fish with Adobo, cumin, garlic powder, seasoning salt and pepper. We were using a little less than 1 lb of fish so I reduced the salsa to a little more than 1 cup. I also added a few tortilla chips around the rice like the photo. It was a very easy recipe that we will make again!

We thought it was good and very easy, I used organic salsa and served with black bean. I made one mistake I poured the whole jar of salsa over the filets and baked for 30 minutes, the cod was flakey but there was way too much salsa (my fault). I will make again with less salsa.

Super easy to make!  The hardest part was digging the three open jars of salsa out of the fridge that I combined for 2 cups!  The finished sauce was delicious over rice.  Great, quick, tasty Lent-Friday dinner.

This was alright.  I changed it up by putting lemon juice in the bottom of the dish, and adding cheese at the last 10 mins.  The flavor and the fish didn't mix well.  This is only my opinion thoough, try it for yourself.

Made this last night and was so pleasantly surprised!  I mixed Trader Joe's salsa verde with a nice red salsa since I needed to use them up.  Half way through baking, I topped it with feta cheese.  WOW!  30 minutes was perfect.  There seemed to be lots of juice but even that was delicious.  We are eating much more fish lately, and this will be made often, especially since it can be prepared with a variety of ingredients/ spices, etc..  Recipe earns five stars because the base recipe is such a brilliant idea.

I followed an earlier review and reduced the salsa to 2-4T / fillet. My fillet was still semi frozen, but into the oven it went.  I made it into a fish taco by putting it in a warmed corn tortilla with small dice cuke, shredded lettuce and Marzetti's Spinach dip. Taco del Mar with " what s on hand!"

Amended a little, added chickpeas to the fish before the salsa and sprinkled shredded parm cheese on top when plated and instead of rice I  roasted asparagus in olive oil and balsamic. Very very good

Super Bwaino!  This was a cinch and tasted great. My oven cooks slower so I need more time in the oven or higher temp, but this tasted great.

We did not care for this at all.  It just doesn't seem like salsa and cod should go together.

It was okay, nothing special.  Will probably not make it again.  I gave it 3 stars just because it was super fast and easy to make.

Delish! I used non-stick spray in the bottom of the baking pan, plus a light sprinkling of salt and dried basil leaves. The cod. was rinsed, dried, and placed in the pan. Added prepared medium salsa to cover the fish. Sprinkled the top with a light scattering of dried cilantro followed by thin slices of cheddar and a dusting of parmesan added during the last 10 minutes of baking. It was a delightfully light and savory meal without "fishy" taste or smell. I expect to make often.

This is a simple and truly good, low calorie dinner option when you're trying to incorporate more fish into your diet. I have made it three times now in four weeks. Wouldn't change a thing. Just a fast way to get dinner on your table.

Ran across this by accident. It is so quick and easy to make and delicious! We add cheese in the last few min of cook time and hot salsa. So good!

Love this recipe for its ease and simplicity.  If you're a busy person who wants a quick, easy and delicious cod recipe this is for you.  You can vary how spicy it is based on how mild or hot the salsa you use is.  This is a once every other week dinner.  Served over rice it is also filling.

It was delicious, I greased the casserole dish, sprinkled pepper, seasoning salt, garlic, and red pepper flakes on the bottom and top of fish. Added  the salsa baked for 30 minutes added the cheese the last 8 minutes.

We didn't care for this. I used much less salsa than the recipe called for - basically just enough to spoon over the fish. I can't imagine that it would be better with more. I used medium salsa which I love on chips, but which was overpowering for the fish.

Had to drain off water after baking. Found this a bit flavorless? What flavor it had was good.

I did add some seasoning that wasn't on the list. I was very disappointing though when all the seasoning that I used for the fish, had just been completely overtaken by the salsa.

I think you should use the spicy salsa you have for this....I used a southwestern one with black beans and corn.  This extra zest added to the flavor of the fish....wonderful and easy dish....easy on your hips!
