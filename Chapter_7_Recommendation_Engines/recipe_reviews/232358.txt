Very easy and decent mint chocolate chip ice cream.  I used fresh mint as we have loads of it right now, and chopped chocolate from a chocolate bar.  Hubs had two servings of this.  I liked it as well.  We were initially skeptical that this would all fit into our KA ice cream bowl, but it fit just fine and harden up to a nice ice cream.  We did not add the chocolate until about 3/4 way through the freezing process.  Thanks for the recipe!

When you don't have enough time to do an egg custard ice cream, then this is a really decent recipe that whips up in seconds and has the consistency and flavor of an ice cream that tastes labored over! I have used this recipe several times. Once exactly as written, another time with broken Oreo cookies instead of chocolate chips and most recently I used the ice cream base and instead of mint, I added lavender extract and sprinkled lavender flowers over scoops of ice cream just before serving to make a lovely lavender ice cream. All versions were formidable and enjoyed by all!

I've made a lot of mint ice cream and this is our favorite so far. Super easy and fast. I suggest shaving a few squares of some semi sweet chocoalte bar instead of using chocolate chips. That way the chocolate melts in your mouth.  Also I use green and yellow food coloring to get the perfect mint color.

easiest ice cream ever!  Made no changes to recipe and  we all decided it was best we have ever made.  Plus the ice cream stayed creamy after first day, unlike other homemade ice creams that seem to become grainy over time

It was Great everything was perfect except donâ€™t put the in chocolate chips right away! If you do it messes up the ice cream maker and makes it much harder.

Super easy recipe to make and turned out really well! I would add more mint extract next time for more minty flavor. Maybe another 1/2 tsp?

Totally awesome! It's on the Sweetside but that's what makes it good. It is very easy to make takes a little bit but it is worth it. It is my new favorite ice cream.

I made this into Vanilla ice cream too. I still used the vanilla it calls for and substituted the mint extract for Vanilla extract. It tastes delicious!!
