I wish the cook's notes had been included, but I used dried ginger and dried orange rind and brined it for about 24 hours. I roasted it at 250 degrees for about 9 hours and it was fabulous .  I later used the leftovers for  wonderful chicken enchiladas using the collagan, green chilis, onions, organic cream of chicken soup, and lots of cotija cheese.

I made this without the ginger  and paprika.  I don't care for either ingredient, but the other items sounded wonderful.  I used 12 chicken breasts instead of a whole chicken.  That being said.....

It was delicious!  There was a subtle citrus taste that may have been missed with the other ingredients.  The chicken was very moist and delicious.  Perfect for a summer meal.

This is an awesome brine. Meat is incredible juicy after just a few hours. Will not cook bird again without a brine and this is the best I have tried so far.

This brine was excellent! I halved the recipe because I was only needing enough brine for 2 cornish hens. Instead of grilling over hickory chips I smoked them in a smoker with hickory chips. I've smoked quite a few cornish but this batch was by far the most juicy and tender I've ever had. If I were not completely sold on brining a bird prior to cooking it, this recipe would have sold me.  Excellent recipe and 5 stars all the way!
