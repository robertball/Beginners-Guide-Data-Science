My husband loves beer and venison. I love pepperoncini's and can tolerate venison so this recipe sounded really interesting. After letting it cook for about 3 hours I almost threw it out because the smell was too much. I decided to put the crockpot in the garage instead so I didn't have to smell it anymore. I expected it to taste awful and was a little nervous when my husband brought it in from the garage and started to slice it. I had a frozen pizza ready to go just in case. Much to my surprise, it was very very good. The only changes I would make is definitely cooking it in the garage unless the smell of slow cooking venison is something you actually like. The other is that I would season the meat. The recipe didn't call for seasonings so I didn't but it could have used something. It was a little bland. It was very tender though. I served it on buns. I'll be making this again. Thanks for the recipe!

Very good! I made this this past weekend at our cabin - loved the "no hassle" which allows me to relax and have fun while dinner is cooking. I used only 1 can of beer and a can of beef broth, a 12oz jar of pepperoncini (w/ juices), a good spoonful of minced garlic, added a good shake of dry onion flakes, and a pinch of dried rosemary. The men (who already love venison) loved this - these made great sandwiches! The smell wasn't strong to us but then again - I did make some modifications. Thanks Ellie for the great & simple recipe!

loved this. wasn't bothered by the smell, as i learned a long time ago to soak game meats overnight in the refrigerator covered in milk. just rinse the meat the next day, and continue with your recipe.

A great recipe - so easy and very delicious! I also soaked my venison roast in milk overnight. I served it with some roasted veggies - excellent!

This recipe is awesome!  I used Heineken beer which was perfect.  If you like it spicy use some of the peppercini juice.  I seasoned it with garlic, salt, pepper, and italian seasoning and it was perfect.  Not gamey at all.  So easy!  Sure to get complements!

One word for this recipe...WOW!  This dish was not gamey or rich.  You could easily serve this without "warning" anyone that it is deer.  This will be a new staple in our house!

This recipe is deceptively simple, it has a lot of flavor.  You can alter the taste by choosing different types of beer.  We loved it with mashed potatoes.

I used wild venison and my slow cooker.  I added onion soup mix which I am glad I did.  It was pretty good, I made a yummy gravey with the liquid.  I would make this again.

I will give this 3 stars because my husband loved this recipe.  I didn't at all.  I added potatoes, carrots, and onions.  Maybe I shouldn't have because the beer taste was so overpowering even throughout the vegetables.  When I walked in the door after work, the house did not smell good at all like it normally does when I use the crockpot.  The taste was just too overpowering.  I did like the cooked pepperchini's though.  That was something I have never had before.  Thanks for the recipe.  This one just didn't do it for me at all.

Very good. I put all the ingredents in the crock pot the night before and put in refrig over night. I followed the cooking directions the next day. When I came home from work it was done. It tasted very good. Even the advid hunter in the family liked it.

For those who said it was too gamey, I agree soak it in milk and perhaps use a milk stout as your cooking liquid. Also a roast from a buck will be far tougher and gamier (if that's a word) than a doe, so it may be something to take into consideration as well before trying this recipe. I thought this was great. You can change the flavor vastly with the type of beer you use and the peppers... lucky for me my husband bagged 2 deer this year. Next time I may season the roast by doing a dry rub and brown it before placing it in the crock pot...maybe a couple onions would be nice too. Thanks ELLIEA for sharing this recipe!

This was a nice recipe, meat was very tender and the pepperoncinis provided a nice level of heat.  I seasoned the meat generously before I put it in the slow cooker.  I wouldn't rave about it though.  I've got much nicer venison recipes so I'm not sure I'll be rushing back to make this again.

Yum.  Like the PP stated, the smell during cooking is 'unusual', but the end result is delicious.  I also add a quartered onions and diced potatoes to round out the meal.

This was very good.  Took the gamey taste right out of the venison.  My husband and I loved it!

I was very disappointed with this recipe. I did not find it at all flavorful, was there a certain type of pepperoncini brand? or beer?  my boyfriend who loves venison was truly disappointed in wasting a good cut of meat for this roast :(

The venison turned out great!  I only could fit one beer to cover our roast, and I wasn't sure about the pepperoncini juices so I just pulled the peppers from the jar with a fork and let just the juice that fell out with the peppers get in the crock pot.  It actually sat in the crock pot for about 10-11 hours before we ate.  I took the meat out and it looked a little dry, but I pulled it apart and covered it in the juices.  Fed it to six people who said they couldn't tell the difference between beef.  Excellent recipe!  Will use again!
