I added 2 Tbsp lemon juice (not 3), and that suited our tastes fine.  An additional Tbsp would have been too lemon-y for us (personal taste).  This couscous is rich with flavor, the raisins and sun dried tomatoes bring a little sweetness, and the tartness of the lemon brightens it.  It was a little gummy and dry, so I did add some vegetable broth to moisten it slightly.  Very nice, would make again.

This one looks good but it’s nothing to do with “Moroccan” couscous   It’s pure ISRAELI couscous....

it's rather bland but what can you do.  I'm just learning the vegan palate.  I subbed roasted red peppers for the tomatoes and left out the butter to make it vegan

This was pretty good. There's not much to say about it. I threw in a can of chickpeas to make it a main dish.

I normally do not care for couscous. This recipe is sweet and delicious. Only difference I made was chopping up some blanched almonds since that's what I had on hand.

I've made this a couple of times. Easy and quick. I always leave out the butter.

Quick and easy to make and it was delicious!  I was out of shallots so I used extra onion.  I used regular raisins and added some chopped up dried apricots.  It was really good!  I will definitely make this again.

I have made this twice. There is nothing quick about this recipe. It takes 45 minutes to 1 hour alone to chop the ingredients. Conceptually, you could probably speed it up once you get the hang of it. It is very tasty.  I add feta cheese  at the end once cooled off to give it some flair. I am going to start playing with it more and more as I believe it is a great core recipe and well suited to adaptation.

Instead of raisins & almonds I used currant and walnuts, personal preference.  I added peppers, olives, and feta to the dish to make it a main course.  It added some extra protein and calories. Super delicious!!

My husband and I loved this! Left out raisins and shallots because we didn't have those. Also, used only 2 tablespoons of lemon juice. SO yummy!!
