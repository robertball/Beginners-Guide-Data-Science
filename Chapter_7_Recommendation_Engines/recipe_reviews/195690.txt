I didn't like it that much when i had followed the recipe, but then i added a clove of garlic to the food processor and blended it up and it made it way better!  Try it!

I skipped the pasta entirely,omitted the basil,doubled the red pepper and reduced the oil by half. It made a wonderful smoky spread for brushetta!

Made this as a pasta salad for a party just as written. Guests raved and clearly enjoyed it, since there were no leftovers!

This wasn't good at all.  I had to modify it a lot to make it worth serving.  I added more parmesan cheese, a clove of a garlic and some half and half, and then heated it until the cheese was melted and it thickened up.  Then it was good.

This is good and easy! I added some cut up sun dried tomato chicken sausage that I sauteed with about 4 cloves of garlic. Yum!

It's a great start. Needed just a little something more. Added garlic and a dash of tobasco.

I omitted the Parmesan because I can't eat it, and I added some pan fried shrimp. This was so delicious and super easy!

This was just OK for us.  It really needs a clove or two of garlic, maybe a few pepper flakes.
