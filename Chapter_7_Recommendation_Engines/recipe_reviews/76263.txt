OK, I give this three stars with a couple of reservations. I've only tried it once, but here are my comments: I detected a slight to moderate aftertaste that was more evident when the pie was hot. I recommend that you make sure your splenda mixture is very well distributed, I think this will help with the aftertaste. Also, the addition of a bit of lemon juice and/or a small amount of butter under the top crust might help. I would add 2-4 tablespoons of apple juice or water if the apples are not very juicy. If all else fails, I was able to mask the aftertaste with vanilla ice cream :)

You cant ask for a better sugar free apple pie than this! I made this for my fathers birthday since he is diabetic and he just loved it. I did make several adjustments however. Since reading alot of comments on here complaining about aftertaste I cut the splenda down to just 1/2 cup and used two types of sweeter tasting apples. Fuji's and Red Romes. Because these apples arent as tart as lets say Granny Smith apples, it wasnt necessary for so much splenda. I used more cinnamon as well, 3tsps. I didnt have nutmeg so I used 1/4 tsp of clove which goes great with apples as well. I used flour instead of cornstarch. Also the mixture does look at bit dry so I used 3 tbs of sugar free orange juice that I happened to have on hand (crystal light). This all worked so great together. You must try this pie if you cant have sugar!!! Also I only cooked this pie on 400 degrees. Hope you try this, you'll love it. Make it with the 1-2-3 pie crust here on this website. It was great as well.

This pie was VERY runny. Also, if you don't wait until it's chilled, it has a horrible aftertaste. Once chilled, it's not too bad. I had to lower the oven temp. because, baked as stated, it would have burnt. I caught it just in time to spare it. Not sure I would ever make this pie again.

I've had a gastric bypass and thanks to splenda I never feel like I can't eat like regular people! I added the splenda/spices mixture a little at a time to the apples mixing well after each addition. It came out perfect. My husband and son absolutely loved it...I will defenitely be making this again and plan on sharing this recipe with my bariatric support group meeting!

this pie was so delicious. I had never cooked with splenda before so i was a little intimidated when i smelled the splenda.... But, the pie cooked just like a normal apple pie and tasted the exact same as the applie pie i made with regular sugar. I made it for thanksgiving because my boyfriend is on the Atkins diet and can't have all the sugar of a regular applie pie. Thank you for sharing the recipe.

Wonderful sugar free recipe! I used the filling for a Dutch Apple pie. I used only 4 tsp. corn starch in the filling. Put it in a no roll pie crust, and topped it with a flour, butter and Splenda Brown Sugar crumble. No one could tell the difference.

Great pie! Easy to make and has just the right balance of flavorings. No one that ate this knew it was low sugar until I told them. I'll be making this one again and again.

I made this pie for Sunday Brunch. No one knew it was made with Splenda & all 25 guests couldn't stop raving about it. I'll make double the amount of pies next time.

This pie came out amazing.  Instead of 1 cup of splenda, I used 1/2 cup regular splenda and 1/2 cup brown sugar blend splenda.  I used 1/2 Roma and 1/2 Fuji apples, flour instead of cornstarch, added 2 tablespoons of melted butter,  and increased the cinnamon to 1 tsp.  I will make this pie again and again!

My sister was recently diagnosed as pre-diabetic, so I made this for her Labor Day party in Hendersonville, NC, where we were visiting her during the Apple Festival.  My pie looked exactly like the picture on the website, and I served it with sugar-free, Splenda sweetened vanilla yogurt.  I used Honey Crisp apples in the pie because they are grown in that area and flour instead of cornstarch.  I believe this pie would be perfect with any variety of apple.  It is definitely a "keeper."

No one can believe that this a made with Splenda instead of sugar.  The first time I baked it I thought it was a little dry so now I add 2-3 tablespoons of apple juice to the apples and toss them before adding the dry ingredients.  Thanks for a wonderful apple pie recipe.

I did this recipe twice.  First time I used Fuji apples, upped the cinnamon to 2 teaspoons, reduced the Splenda to 3/4 cup instead of 1 cup, and used spelt flour instead of corn starch.  It was great, and I was not so aware of an aftertaste, even when the pie was warm.  It was wonderful!  Second time I used Granny smith apples, a tarter apple, and it was not quite as good.  I will certainly use this recipe again, but with a sweeter apple like Fuji.

I was in need of another pie recipe for Thanksgiving this year, and because of my special sugar substitute needs this recipe fit the bill.  Not only did the pie come out great, but it was the best tasting pie amongst the 5 that were present.  Now, I hadn't tasted it warm, so I can't say about an aftertaste, but I've been using Splenda for a while now, and I know of many who find it to have an aftertaste and many like myself who don't.  I think it just depends.  I used Granny Smith apples by the way, and they worked really well.  My crust did get brown quick at that temp, but a tinfoil ring fixed it with no further browning.  Excellent recipe and a definite keeper!  Mahalo!

This Spenda apple pie was the BOMB!!  My whole family enjoyed it and no one knew that it did not have any sugar.  I did brush the top of the pie with a little milk and sprinkled a little real sugar on top to give it a nice look.  Thank you Splenda!

Wonderful recipe!  I used apples from the tree in my yard and it was delicious.  The only thing is did differently is decreased the nutmeg to 1/8tsp, just because of personal preference.  It was very easy and quick to prepare and bake but you wouldn't know it after you taste it!

This is an excellent sugar-free apple pie recipe. If you use 1/2 cup of Splenda and 1/2 cup of Splenda Brown Sugar Blend it makes it even better. I also put 3 tablespoons of Real Lemon in it, and instead of a regular pie crust topping, I used a crumb topping, mixing Splenda Brown Sugar Blend, flour, and butter. I baked it at 350 for 1 1/2 hrs., covering with a sheet of foil the last 30 minutes. (It will burn if you try to bake it at the temp. given in the recipe). There is NO aftertaste! I love Splenda, since becoming a diabetic, Splenda has opened up a whole world of great sweet things. Keep up the great recipes!

This recipe is awesome! I used about 9 McIntosh apples I purchased at Trader Joe's. My prep time took 30 min and my cook time was about 45 min.

My husband had gastric bypass surgery and isn't able to eat alot of desserts sweetened with regular sugar.  I made this for him 2 Thanksgivings ago and it is now one of our favorite desserts any time of the year.  My teenage nephew couldn't tell the difference when he helped himself to the Splenda pie thinking it was a regular pie sweetened with sugar.

This Apple Pie is excellent!  I am diabetic, my husband is not.  He loves apple pie and so do I.  The first time I made this I did not tell him it was sugar free.  He loved it!  I have made it several times  since then, and with great results each time.

My husband went nuts over this. A year ago he was diagnose as having type 2 diabetes & giving up his "treats" has been hard on him. This recipe tasted like pie he used to enjoy all the time and wasn't "bad" for him.

I was looking for a recipe that I could enjoy since I was recently diagnosed as a prediabetic. I think I liked this more than my old sugar recipe!

This recipe is absolutely fabulous! I first made it for Thanksgiving 2 years ago for my diabetic aunt. Everyone loved it so much that they request it every year. I have never altered the recipe at all. They think it is delicious the way it is.

This pie turned out beautiful.  I used Granny Smith Apples and I altered the recipe slightly.  I used about 2 tablespoons of butter in the pie because I enjoy the rich flavor it gives. I also used a scratch made crust.

My only complaint on this recipe is that there is an aftertaste; which is not uncommon when using artificial sweetner or sugar substitutes.  It isn't bad and as long as the pie is cool it isn't overpowering.

I would recommend this recipe but I wouldn't try to pass it off as a "regular" apple pie.

My family LOVES this pie.  Now I spend more time in the kitchen making this pie for holidays, birthdays, hey we want pie days.  Great taste and no one can tell it is made with SPLENDA!  I wait until they are done to tell them the look of surprise is great.  This would be the pie to use to show someone you really can't tell the difference.

This pie was not my fav.  I can not have sugar and Splenda is one of my fav artifial sweeteners, but in this recipe there was a def. after taste. 

I didn't tell other people that it was made from Splenda, and it DID get eaten, but it was not the fav, or a big hit.  I'll keep looking for low sugar alternatives.
