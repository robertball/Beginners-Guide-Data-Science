11.5.17  Lovely presentation and actually quite easy if you have a food processor.  Followed the recipe with the exception of using russet potatoes (what I had) instead of Yukon Gold, and they worked fine.  I had some concerns that the potatoes would brown too much on the bottom, so I had my heat all the way down to low.  I have used Henckels ceramic skillets for years, and this slid right out of the pan.  For my own personal taste, I may cut back just a little on the thyme, but this was very tasty and a company worthy dish.  Thanks Ann for an awesome new potato recipe!

This is a very nice and simply delicious potato dish. I was afraid that with a total of 3 layers it would take forever to cook in my cast iron pan. Long and behold the potatoes came out very tender and delicious within the time frame! I did follow the suggestion of cooking them at a low temperature. My actual touch was to put it 3 minutes under the broiler at 6 inches from it to brown the top a bit. Very good! Try to get the best Gruyère you can find.

Good enough, but I prefer a creamier dish. I hoped for a scalloped potato type dish, but this was drier.

Wonderful combination of yukon gold potatoes, gruyere and thyme.  Lovely presentation makes the extra preparation more than worth it.  Not saying I'll make it every Tuesday night, but will definitely put it in the "extra effort dinner" category.

I made two mistakes making this.  1) I used a smoked guyere cheese (NOPE - too overwhelming smokiness).  2). The lid I covered the fry pan with was made for steaming - lots of wholes in the lid - as a result the potatoes didn’t cook as completely as they should have.  Simple fixes for next time.  Overall I like the recipe and think it’ll be a 5?? With changes above.  I’ll make it per recipe next time - but I also wonder how it’d come out made in an oven.

This was delicious and very easy.  I was worried that the dish wouldn’t have enough butter to fully keep the top potatoes moist so I added more before I covered it. DON’T do this. My potatoes didn’t crisp up. It was super delicious anyway. I bought a pricey gruyere and it was worth it.

This was a super easy recipe.  I usually do Au Gratin type potatoes in the oven.  This was much quicker and easier, and the result was amazing!  The Gruyere cheese was a perfect fit.  I admit, I forgot the thyme, but the dish was still excellent.  I will definitely be making these again very soon!!!!

Nice presentation when you flip it over - nice & brown crust on the potatoes. Hubby made these & said you want to have potatoes thinly sliced & the onion. For our preference we'll try more Gruyere cheese & maybe even try adding some Smoked Gouda. They did seem a little dry but that was from probably overcooking cause the rest of the meal wasn't ready & we didn't even cook as long as recommended. Hubby forgot to use our cast iron pan as other suggested but doesn't matter so probably won't use cast iron pan.  Will also make sure we use low heat instead of med-low heat.
