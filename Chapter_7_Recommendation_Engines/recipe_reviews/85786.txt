Outrageously good. I roasted the red bell peppers as other reviews suggested and used lime juice, because I didn't have lemon. I also used fresh mint. This is the best dish I have ever made.

yummy!  i did as directed, except i put the finely chopped red bell pepper to cook in the oven w/ the mushrooms, and i didn't have pine nuts on hand, so i chopped & roasted some cashews.  while eating this, i was feeding my baby feta cheese, so as an after thought, i sprinkled it on to my salad.  it complemented it very well.  i will definitely make this again, as it was so easy!

Oh, wow. This was amazing! What is it about garlic and mushrooms that they go so perfectly together? I used basil, and the flavors blended seamlessly. The only things I did differently were to use baby bellas and keep the pine nuts raw (I prefer the flavor). And it's so easy to prepare! An absolute keeper.

A great break from the traditional salad - I loved it! Bake the bell peppers with the mushrooms and sprinkle some feta cheese at the last step. I used basil and the flavor complimented the rest of the ingredients quite well.

I really loved this. I used walnuts instead of pine nuts because thats what I had and used more  lettuce than called for because I like lettucey salad. Otherwise made as written with basil (though I'd like to try the mint some time, too!) and balsamic.  Tip for those that don't know: Boston lettuce & Bibb lettuce = butter lettuce. Thanks for the recipe!

I made this recipe twice. Because i wanted to make it for a potluck party. The first time i made it as instructed. The second time i made it, i added pinenuts, no mint, a sprinkle of basil, i dipped the mushrooms in balsmic vinegar, oregano and oil. And i used shitake mushrooms instead. For the dressing i didnt use any lemon but a squeeze of lime, pepper, white wine vinegar with balsmic vinegar and i roasted the red papers with garlic. Everyone loved it!!!!!!

I didn't have pine nuts, so I skipped them, and I used 1 tsp dried basil instead of fresh. I also roasted the red peppers with the mushrooms for extra flavor. This salad is a great "winter" salad. Fabulous color and really delicious blend of veggies.

Boy, is this good!  I used an orange pepper, because that's what I had on hand.  I also used dried basil--I had fresh mint in the fridge, but chickened out when it came to dumping it in.  Different, but oh so good!

I thought this salad was quite amazing.  I had to use mixed greens because I didn't have Boston lettuce.  Didn't toast the pine nuts because I prefer them raw.  Used an orange bell pepper because that's what I had. I used fresh lemon juice to make it extra special.  I will make this again trying fresh basil and Boston lettuce.  I am sure it will make it even better.

Unimpressed, really. I appreciate the health-factor, incredibly easy to put together... the flavors just didn't come together in any way that makes me say wow or ever have a desire to make again. I wish I could think of a way to make the recipe better (followed exactly, opting for basil in the salad and the vinegar in the dressing). Maybe sautee the mushrooms and add some sald and pepper? Would that be enough? Anyhow, just won't make again!

I wasn't crazy about this as a salad, but the mixture was perfect for a pasta sauce I used. I took the leftovers of this recipe and cooked it with onions, chicken, and some crushed red pepper. Delicious!

Like some other reviewers, I made it with basil.  I used white balsamic in the dressing. It was good but it just seemed like a lot of steps for a salad. Maybe I'm just being lazy, but it was good.

I turned this into a make-ahead salad by roasting my mushrooms along with the red peppers early in the afternoon, covered and refrigerated until dinner.  Then I added the dressing and reheated it briefly in the microwave, just to re-warm the mushrooms slightly.  I was in a bit of a rush, so rather than make the dressing for this recipe, I just used some Italian I already had in the fridge.   I used fresh basil and served this over some bright green lettuce from Hubs’ garden.  This was different and a nice change. We both enjoyed this and I'll definitely make it again!  Thank you!

Looked beautiful on the plate and fairly easy to make, but didn't have much flavor.  Would consider making again with addition of something that would give it a little more taste.
