I made this in a bundt pan and put the mixture in the center, carefully spooning the second batter over top.  I did not want to use lemon extract so I  used fresh squeezed lemon juice doubling the amount.  It was a hit.  I had also drizzled icing over it to give it some flare.

Didn't use the nuts.  Ran out of lemon extract so used half lemon and half orange extract.  Delicious!

I was just looking for a different recipe for coffee cake and stumbled on this one.  My family and extended family enjoyed it.

good but doesn't taste lemony at all.  I even doubled the lemon extract.  If you are looking for a lemon coffee cake this isn't it.  Maybe if you added some lemon zest.  It is a tasty moist cake.

Followed the recipe with the exception of using the juice from 1/2 lemon. Next time I will add more as we enjoy the lemon flavor. I baked this in a tube pan which required a longer bake time. I tested with a long wooden scewer about every 5 mins. A small part of the cake still was not done but that is the fault of my oven. This cake is moist with a little crunch from the sugar mix. Just the right balance. Much better than coffee cake from the store. Great recipe! Give it a try.

This recipe is delicious and *foolproof*. Because I'm usually making this before my first cup of coffee and the kids are "starving", I make it all in one bowl rather than mixing the dry and liquid ingredients separately and then combining them. Baking heresy, I know, but all you need to do is add the sour cream and extracts to the butter/sugar/egg blend and then add the dry ingredients (one by one), mixing well after each addition and making sure to add the flour LAST.  Unorthodox, but I've always gotten good results and there's a heckuva lot less clean-up after!   BTW, I agree with whoever said it's not extremely lemony - I just call it "sour cream coffeecake" and no one gets picky about it.  :)

Very good coffee cake. I would have preferred it a little more moist. I added juice from 1/2 of a small lemon and the zest. Next time I will add even more. I baked it in a bundt pan, I suggest if you use one to put all the topping in the middle because if you put it on the top like I did when you dump the cake out onto your serving plate the crumb topping is on the bottom. I will probably try making it in a 13x9 pan next time. Made Vanilla Glaze and put some lemon extract in it, made it runny and drizzled it over the cake. If you like lemon you will like this coffee cake.

Great coffee cake! Instead of using lemon extract I squeezed the juice of 1 lemon and added about 1 teaspoon of lemon zest to enhance the flavor. My family loved it Christmas morning. I baked it in a bunt pan so it had to cook for about 8 extra minutes. Thanks for the recipe!

A very good recipe made exactly as written but, for us, absolutely no lemon extract.  If I am supposed to use lemon in a cake then it is lemon zest.   Using pure vanilla in this cake gives excellent flavor.

A nice change of pace for coffee cake! I didn't use the lemon extract as I didn't have any. So I used about 1 1/2 tablespoons of fresh lemon juice. I also used some lemon zest in the cake batter and the icing. Very good, I'll be making this again.
