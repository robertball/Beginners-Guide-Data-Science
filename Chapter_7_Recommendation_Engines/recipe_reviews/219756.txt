This recipe is perfect if ........A). you don't know how to cook, B). your imagination has dried up, C). your camping, D). you have a really fresh (freshly caught) piece of salmon and you don't want to adulterate it with any diverting seasonings.  In my past, I have utilized all categories A to D.
I did pan fry my salmon two nights ago,  I used salt and pepper, two tablespoons unsalted butter and a splash of sesame oil to  the burning (smoking).  Served with a rice pilaf, a green salad with a vinaigrette dressing. With a cold crisp white sauvignon, it's a meal to serve a queen!

Can't get any simpler than this. It works. It's straight forward. Crunchy skin, beautifully cooked inside. If all you want is plain salmon, this is it.

This is my favourite way to cook salmon! I use rice bran oil (it tolerates higher heat than olive oil) and a little butter. Altho I sort of do it the opposite...cook skin side down for about 7 min. then turn it just to brown the top. Then you don't have to mess around taking the skin off to make "crackle".  The crackle is delish!

This is a very simple, basic recipe. I think it could be picked up a notch with maybe a little lemon juice, perhaps a pinch of onion or garlic powder? I enjoyed it more than the rest of my family did - they were diplomatic and ate theirs, but didn't want any more...

I don't like skin, and salmon is just so-so.  At least, that  I what I thought before I tried this recipe. Oh my!  Have I been converted! This recipe makes cooking salmon so simple, so quick,  and it comes out SO delicious! And the crispy skin... I'm getting hungry just thinking about it. I originally told my kids it was yucky so I could have it to myself, but one of them snuck a bite, and now we all fight over it.  We *maybe* ate salmon once a year until I discovered this recipe. Now it's a weekly staple in our home. Oh, and if you forget to thaw out your salmon... we've done that too. It can still be cooked frozen. It just doesn't come out quite as yummy.  We have also tried this recipe with lemon pepper seasoning or Garam Masala. It still comes out  delish that way too! Btw, if you've never tried Garam Masala, get some , like now. It will change your life.

This was SO easy to make and it tasted as good as any other way I've cooked salmon.  Way easier than using the ridged pan I use in the broiler.  I love the flavor that sea salt gives salmon.  I followed the recipe but did not do the salmon skin.  Next time I will.

Dust salmon with sugar before placing in pan. This will speed up the Mailliard reaction and give your salmon a nice dark crust.

Great recipe for lunch and very simple. I drizzled honey on top and juiced half a lime and a quarter of a lemon on the salmon to add some flavor. Peppers on the side. Will make again.

Loved it! So simple and so tasty. I prefer this over any kind of marinade. Only change I make is I leave the skin on when serving.

This was excellent.  Not sure 2 Tablespoons of oil is necessary but the salt made a great crust.  I cooked it 5 minutes on the salt side and 4 on the skin side and it was perfect...not overcooked or dry. Quick and easy.
Will definitely make again.
Thanks!

This is really good for any fresh fish. The trick?   Use regular light olive oil not virgin or evoo, and be patient and pay attention, the non skin side will brown nicely and release from the pan.

Excellent and easy! Best recipe I've found for cooking salmon. I didn't change a thing, but you could add more seasonings if you wanted to. I found this to be more predictable than baking.

Just made this for my husband. He doesn’t like added salt so just pepper. I also cooked it a bit less because he had a thinner piece with no skin. I made it into a sandwich with a mayonnaise recipe I found here (Valerie’s sauce), lettuce and tomato on wheat toast. He was raving!

This is my go-to method for quick salmon filets or steaks. I use butter not oil and add sliced fresh garlic to the cast iron pan while cooking. Flavour! Goes with all side dishes.

My husband loves salmon, me not so much. But I have now made it twice and he says it’s wonderful. Plus it’s so easy it doesn’t irritate me that I have to make something I don’t eat!!

Like the reviewer said, this is PERFECT to those who are new and fresh to cooking. The great aspect about this recipe is that it teaches to how to cook salmon, and only mentions the  bare ingredients  you CAN NOT go without to achieve that. Is you are like me and like some more flavor, go with this: saute onions w/ garlic in the pan before adding the salmon and then last, after the salmon is added, place some freshly cut tomatoes within the same pan. This will add a LOAD of extra flavor for a family favorite. :)
