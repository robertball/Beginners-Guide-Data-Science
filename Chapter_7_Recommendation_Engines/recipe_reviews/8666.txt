In  the interest of time and calories , I omitted the stuffing and put a whole lemon, cut in half in the chicken cavity. It was one of the best chicken recipes I have ever made.  I will certainly make it again.

This is a great way to roast a chicken. I prefer to roast some potatoes in the pan with the bird rather than use a bread stuffing inside of it (actually I'd like BOTH, but I have to cut the calories and carbs somewhere!). I usually put 2 small lemons and a bay leaf in the cavity.

I thought this recipe was delicious. I can't believe more people haven't tried it. I've made it several times and I use a bigger chicken and the family can't get enough! I even make a gravy with the drippings and it is wonderful with a hint of lemon flavor.

This is a very tasty way to fix a Lemon chicken. I omitted the stuffing as well. Instaed, I used rice. The broth made an excellent gravy to use on the rice. I will definitely try this again!

This chicken was delicious! I left out the stuffing and put 2 whole lemons cut in half in the cavity and pepperoncini peppers in it too coated it wit some olive oil and burgandy wine and marinated it over night and my wife and 2 year old daughter loved it.

I used this recipe for the family Christmas dinner and it received very positive reviews from all.
However, a suggestion would be to marinate the chicken with the herbs for an hour or two first before
stuffing and baking. Nonetheless, for a novice cook like me, it was a good and easy recipe to
tackle.

I made this for Sunday dinner with invited guests. They all raved about the different taste from roasted chicken. This is a keeper for sure. I will make my chicken this way from now on. thanks for the recipe.

I have never roasted a chicken before so I used this as a base recipe. I skinned the chicken and used what I had on hand to season it. I poured bottle lemon juice over it and rubbed it with lemon pepper and paprika. I stuffed the chicken with 8 garlic cloves. I baked for 2 hours, but after an hour I threw in baby carrots and potatoes. It was very moist and got rave reviews.

I normally don't stuff a bird because of the bacteria issue but went ahead and followed this recipe. It took an hour longer to cook than the recipe suggested. I took the stuffing out at the 2 hour mark because it was not running clear and I was worried it was too stuffed. Ok taste but probably won't make again.

The chicken tasted good... just not very lemony. I cooked it breast side down so that the breast would not dry out and it did turn out nice. The only reason I did not give it five stars is because I was really expecting a more lemon taste but the chicken did have a good flavor.

I followed the advice from marywitky to skip the stuffing and add one lemon cut in half to the cavity.  After an hour loosely covered with foil, I added 3 small potatoes, quartered, and baked uncovered for another hour.  Juicy and delicious!

This was good, and makes a great family meal. Takes a while to cook, but the prep is super easy. You can stick it in the oven and take care of some other household chores for a couple of hours. Good stuff!

this was ok.  the flavor was a little too light for us.  maybe with some lemon pepper or some garlic it would be better.

I cooked it in an oven bag and put a quartered lemon inside the chicken and the rest in the bag and it turned out really lemony. Having the lemon in bag meant it made a really nice lemon gravy

I gave it a 4 instead of a 5 because I couldn't really taste the lemon, except in the stuffing which I put around the chicken. My children loved it though, and that's really saying something.

The Lemon Stuffed Chicken was  okay to me(not the best)...I'm not sure if i added enough lemon juice because i didn't taste the lemon to much in it.I must say though it was really tender and not tough..I did substitute the wheat bread with white bread because im not much of a wheat person....

I make chicken this way all the time and love it.  I don't add the stuffing.  I use one whole lemon which I cut slits in but keep it whole.  I add fresh rosemary and thyme springs from garden and stuff the bird.  I rub skin with olive oil, pepper and paprika.  I cook at a temperature of 400 degrees for one hour, uncovered.  My family loves it!

This was really good! I did however make a few changes. I cut slits in my chicken and melted butter and poured it all over the chicken. I used lime instead of lemon and believe it or not, it was AWESOME! I also cut up potatoes and carrots and added chicken broth to the bottom of the pan. I added garlic powder and italian seasoning.

This was very easy to make and tasted great. I increased the lemon as per the reviews, and added some lemon pepper as well. In the spirit of being healthy, I omitted the stuffing and added chopped beets, potatoes, and apple. Great go to slow cook recipe!

Didn't have any stuffing mix so stuffed the chicken with rinds made to  squeeze the lemon juice.  Made the dish refreshingly lemony.  Don't think I'll even try with stuffing.

Fabulous. Everyone loved it and I had enough leftover to make a fantastic chicken pot pie too. I followed a few of the suggestions made which may or may not have made a difference but I will definitely be making this again.
