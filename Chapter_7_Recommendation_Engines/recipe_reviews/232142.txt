I  used only spelt flour.  These cookies keep their shape during baking.  Even more cinnamon flavor would make them better, I think, but they are good as the recipe stands!  They make a great breakfast cookie!

I will keep this recipe....used craisens (1 cup)rather than apples as that is what I had on hand.    I think it might have helped with the sweet factor.   Definitely liked all the healthy ingredients!

I used sugar-free applesauce and only 1/2 cup natural peanut butter.  To compensate for the lack of sugar in these two ingredients, I upped the brown sugar to 2/3 cup.  They were plenty sweet.  I served them for breakfast with smoothies, and the kids loved them!  These are going on the breakfast menu!

These were really pretty good. My kids liked them! I added a tablespoon of cinnamon instead of what it originally called for and a half cup more of brown sugar. They have a cake like consistency. There tasty! I'll make these again.

I thought these were just okay.  To me, they were not sweet enough and lacked flavor somehow and the peanut butter seemed lost.  I did love how they kept their shape.  I tried on the second batch to add more sugar and even cocoa to a few but just couldn't get it right.  I do appreciate the healthy aspect of them and might try them again without the peanut butter, add vanilla and more cinnamon and/or nutmeg.

Yes, used mashed soft apples for the applesauce, and 1/3 cup of Country Crock margarine was substituted for the 1 cup flax seed meal, and used all-purpose flour which substituted for the whole-wheat flour, also added a touch of nutmeg and honey.

My family didn't really like these cookies.  I think they are a bid bland and when my little ones see cookies they expect a tasty treat.  I was so excited to try them and then ended up with 4 dozen cookies no one wanted to eat.  The plus side is two of our horses really like them so I may keep the recipe in the box for them.  The horses give it 5 stars!
