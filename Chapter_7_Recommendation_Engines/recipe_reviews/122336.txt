This was really good stuff!  I only had diced tomatoes with green chilies on hand, so I used that.  It turned out great!  Will be making this again....

Great flavor from everyday ingredients. I changed the cooking directions a bit but the only ingredients I added was some chopped onion and black pepper. Browned ribs with salt and pepper, then sprinkled them with Italian seasoning, covered and cooked  on low for 1 hour. Removed and set aside the ribs. I then saut√©ed green pepper, onion, and garlic in the same pot. Then added the rice, tomatoes, water and sugar. Covered and let the rice cook for 20 minutes. Stirred the rice then placed the ribs in the rice and covered and cooked on low for another 30 minutes. I love that everything is done in the same pot. This recipe is now added into our dinner rotation. Thanks for posting.

Awesome recipe! I added my own flair to what is above...I cooked the ribs in my electric skillet in garlic olive oil for about 10-15 minutes turning occasionally browning on both sides. I then added Spaghetti Sauce, Diced tomatoes, RoTel, seasonings (listed below) and Worchestershire sauce. I allowed it to simmer on low in the sauce for about 20 minutes.  I then began to boil the rice in water and Tone's Beef Base from Sam's Club ($4); and seasoning blend-chopped (frozen food section, and minced garlic and my other seasonings-Goya Adobo, and Morton's Nature's Seasoning. I allowed it to boil until the rice/vegetables were very tender. I poured the rice into a glass casserole dish and then I spooned the ribs/sauce mixture over the rice. I then covered with foil and placed into 450 degree oven for about 15-30 mins. My family ENJOYED this meal! I was even better the 2nd day!

This recipe was easy, and the ingredients are things that you have in the house all the time. Nothing worse than cooking and the  ingredients are so exotic you have to go shopping first.
 My husband liked it very much. He is the one that said give it 5 stars.

I didn't really care for this. I didn't like the sugar in the dish and the rice didn't cook evenly. Really wanted to like it, though :(

It was a big hit at my house...  I didn't have any tomatoes or Italian seasoning, but I used 2 cans of pizza sauce...  It came out amazing :)  Much better than BBQ or honey garlic.  Thanks for the recipe

I added some sweet peas and cut the water with some beef stock. I think it helped.

This was ok. Had some issues with the rice cooking all the way and it took 45 minutes. Pork was moist though.

I tried this recipe one night when ribs were on sale.  I didn't want bar-b-que and so thought I would try this recipe.  It was great!  I used rotel tomatoes that I had on hand and used greek seasoning and no sugar.  I seasoned the meat with salt and put it in my crock pot with one can of water.  Yum!!! I will make again.

My goodness, how tasty!!! I almost tried some of the other suggestions/alterations but thought maybe to just give the original recipe a try first, I'm so glad I did! A very welcomed change from barbecue!!! Will definitely make this again and again!!! Thanks

my husband really liked this.  some of the rice seemed a little underdone, maybe it needed more water?
