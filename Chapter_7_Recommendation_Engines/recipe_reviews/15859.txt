These are excellent appetizers, but I soak the water chestnuts in a mix of soy sauce and brown sugar, then wrap the bacon around them and bake or broil them.  They never last long in my house.

This is much better with the sauce - its called Rumaki.  You take 1/4 c soy sauce, 2 tbsp packed brown sugar, 1/8 tsp ground ginger and 1 clove crushed garlic - mix it all together and marinate the water chestnuts (we also use chicken livers)covered, in the refridgerator for 2 hours.  Then drain the marinade and wrap the bacon around the water chestnut and chicken liver - secure with toothpick, and bake 25-30 minutes, until the bacon is crisp.  My mom used to make it all the time - they are great!  I have also had it with the "BBQ" sauce of ketchup and brown sugar - its good as well, but you really have to start out with this base marinade.

Some people enjoy a sauce made of ketchup, mustard and brown sugar for dipping.Without the sauce, this seemed not as flavorful.Thanks Robyn.

I love making these for Christmas brunch!  But one change , and its wonderful this way....Buy the huge or largest dates that you can buy.  Fill each pitted date with a water chestnut  and then wrap them with a strip of bacon and broil til just cooked !  They are GREAT!
They are gone before any thing else so make lots !! Be sure you use LARGE Dates!
Enjoy ! God bless you!

These are very tasty! I made them for St. Patty's Day and both my daughter and I liked them.
I used whole water chestnuts, next time I think I will try them with sliced water chestnuts.

This is a great recipe but I put barb-q sauce on them before cooking them in the oven. It really enhances the taste.

They were very crunch and tasty, a friend recommended a home made barbaque sauce (ketchup and brown sugar).  I did not make it, but it sounded very good.

CRISPY & CRUNCHY!  I used 1/2 pkg. of regular sliced bacon with sliced water chestnuts.  I placed 2-3 slices of chestnuts in each bacon roll.  Very tasty!  Thank you Robyn for sharing your recipe!

My mother has made these for years, and now I am making them, and even my picky kids like them.   I use a mixture of soy sauce and brown sugar poured over them, it makes a nice carmalized effect on them. I have "over cooked" them by mistake before, and they still tasted good!

We've made these for years.  Try the microwavable ready-to-serve bacon (it doesn't get as crumbly and wraps easily). For a sauce we use brown sugar, mayo and chili sauce.  These fly off the plate at all functions I've served them.

Mmmm, Bacon Waterchestnuts are delicious!  Every year for as long as I can remember we've had these as appetizers for the holidays.  Our family gobbles them up so fast!  We've switched to using turkey bacon these days and they're even tastier!  Very highly recommended (and they do not need any dipping sauce - they are perfect just the way they are!).

My mom made these for my sister and I when we were kids.  Helpful hint: you CAN heat them in the microwave if you don't have a toaster oven, but the toaster oven is best.

These are very good, especially when you use the whole water chestnuts. They don't last long on the plate.

I love this recipe and it is always a big hit but what I usually do is after I drain the water chestnuts I add enough soy sauce to the can to coat the water chestnuts.  We also like these with a hot flavor, so we layer a slice of jalopeno  that comes in a jar and then wrap with the bacon.  Addictive!!

I make these appetizers often. After they bake for about 15 minutes I pour some Chinese Duck Sauce over them and continue baking for approximately another 20 minutes. They are always the hit of the party.

I’ve been making these for over 30 years. I soak them in just soya sauce. Then I cook them in either the microwave or the oven. They’re to die for!  Everyone loves them!

My family has enjoyed these for as long as O can remember. No sauce, usually just roll the water chestnuts in brown sugar before wrapping them in bacon or tossing them in maple syrup after wrapped. Everyone always wants the recipe. Always a hit!!

I grew up on these.  Bacon has to be FULLY cooked. Also I have tried them plain once but never again - boring!  Make sure you have sauce for dipping or better yet, once they are fully cooked, add barbeque sauce and bake for another 10 to 15 minutes so the sauce gets hot.  My mom use to run a catering business and there were never any left overs when served with sauce!

Marinate chestnuts in Italian dressing first. Delicious. I have been making these for many years.
