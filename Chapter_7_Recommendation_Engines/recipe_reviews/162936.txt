Made this tonight for recipe group. Made half the recipe. It was easy and really good. Didn't know if the minced onion was fresh or dehydrated. Used real onion, minced with my box grater. An inexpensive, quick, delicious "sloppy" supper. Thanks!!

This was a great barbecue sloppy joe! I scaled this down to just 1 lb. of ground beef. I let mine simmer for about 45 min. while waiting on my husband to come home for his lunch break. This had a nice barbecue flavor. I will make these again soon. Thanks Nonie's BBQ is delicious.

Made for Recipe Group. I assumed the minced onions meant fresh, so that's what I used. The cooking time seems way too long to me, I only cooked the sauce about 5 minutes and added to the beef, then simmered until the consistency was what I wanted. This is way overboard on the sweet side for me. I didn't really get any other taste from it. I don't get the bbq taste from it at all. Thanks for the recipe.

Very tasty!  I did not have red wine vinegar, so just used white vinegar but it still was great.  I added a little of my husband's favorite spicy barbecue sauce for a little extra kick for him.

I made this for Recipe Group this week.  It was very good!  I halved the sugar and increased the onion.  I didn't simmer the additional 10 minutes at the end, because the consistency seemed just right to me.  Next time I think I'd like to add a little green pepper.  I’m glad I made this one and we’re looking forward to having the leftovers tonight!

I followed the recipe, except halved it for one pound of ground beef. The only thing I did different was to add a whole small minced onion,  much more than a tablespoon...sure didn't see the need to waste the rest of the onion. I almost forgot the water addition and after I did add it I wished I hadn't...there is no need for the water...you needed a strain it with a slotted spoon or you'd have a really soggy bun. If I make again I will omit the extra water completely, reduce the sugar a tad (although husband thought the sweetness was perfect) and certainly add some minced bell pepper or celery...I'm glad I had the extra onion. It was a nice quick easy meal to make.

Not a drop left in the pan. I loved that this recipe was homemade sloppy joe and didn't have that commercial can taste like store bought. One of my sons considers himself a sloppy joe expert and he 100% approved this recipe.

Very good flavor. Reminds me of my mother's recipe. I like the tang. I think the next time I will add green peppers for extra veggies. I didn't cook the sauce in a separate pan. After the meat browned, I drained it and then added the sauce to the meat mixture and let it simmer for 15 minutes or so. Saves a pan.

Total comfort food and a great Saturday night supper.  Brought me back to food served when I was growing up...simple good food. Made exactly as written except I subbed a medium minced onion for the 2 tsp (which I assumed was dried). I'd call this Sloppy Joe's. I may have given it 4 stars, though still loved it, but husband and son had 2 helpings and lots of yumms so I changed to a 5. It was a bit sweet but not overly so.  Served it with toasted whole wheat buns, sweet potatoe fries and a green salad. It would be equally good over rice or with egg noodles. I will make it again and may eliminate the white sugar and add another TBSP of brown or may sub some tomatoe paste in for some of the ketchup.  Thanks for the recipe!

Made these for lunch today & as part of the Recipe Group pick for 3.24.12.  These made tasty sammies!  I scaled the recipe to 6 servings for 1 lb of ground meat.  I added some diced green/red pepper to the meat I needed to use up, but otherwise made as written.  Delish!  Thanks for sharing your recipe with us!

Similar to Sloppy Joes but much, much better! I use Splenda and whole wheat buns to make it healthier.

I added a little less than 1/2 cup water because I didn't want too much sauce. I also didn't add white sugar as a personal preference where I think brown sugar tastes sweeter and using 3 tablespoons of that was really good. I also added bbq because when you read BBQ your gonna expect that taste but for me it just wasn't there. I also added Worcestershire sauce because I love it in beef, and dried minced onion and also garlic and the paprika to the meat. I think the sauce would taste better cooked into the meat because for some reason my beef just was overbearing.

Other than all that, I think it was a great base recipe for me and that I just like to cook with beef a certain way because of how my boyfriend likes things! Thank you :)

I Made these for 3/24/12 Recipe Group. Made half the recipe, and served them on homemade hamburgers buns. My daughters thought it is too sweet. I eat mine with Frank’s Hot Sauce so it tastes perfect for me. Next time I will reduce the sugar a little bit. It easy to make and will make this again.

Made this for Recipe Group...We thought this was GREAT! I scaled back the recipe just to make enough for the little guy and for us to try (we were having burgers and the little guy only likes McD's burgers, go figure, lol) and we all thought it was really good. Made as directed, except for adding more onion than called for. This was so simple...will def make this again! Thanks for sharing. :)

"Rated for the Recipe Group"/   I scaled this down to six servings, that was the only change I made.  Served them on onion rolls, I thought they were very good.  The other three tasters of these ( boys between the ages of 15 and 18 ) were not very impressed, although all of them ate the whole thing.  They said they were okay.   So have about two servings left, which I will take for lunch tomorrow.

I am not a fan of ketchup. I cringe when I see it as an ingredient in a recipe. However... this was really very good! We had a busy evening ahead of us at our grandbaby's T-ball game and I wasn't going to be home to babysit the stove. After I cooked and drained the ground beef, I tossed it into my slow cooker with the rest of the ingredients.  Two teaspoons of minced onion (dried or fresh??) didn't sound like enough so I added half of a fresh, chopped onion and half of a chopped green pepper. The flavors mingled in the slow cooker for about 4 hours while we were away. The 1/2 cup of water that some didn't like worked well without making it too soggy for the hamburger buns. We really enjoyed these after the T-ball game. Like others mentioned, it didn't remind us of BBQ. To us, it is a sloppy joe, but much better than the popular kind you find in a can.

Very good! Exactly what I was looking for!  I added minced garlic only because I love garlic!  Also after I browned the meat, I threw it in the crockpot, added the rest of the ingredients, plus a little more water and let it simmer on low for a few hours.  Made the house smell yummy! Very good, will use again and again!

Everyone really like this. I only used brown sugar and used 1/2c of it since I double the recipe. Used a spicy brown mustard and also added 1 tsp of liquid smoke which I think made this more BBQ-y in flavor. Really nice for our party and kept warm nicely in a sterno. Thanks!

Recipe Group Selection:  24, March 2012 ~ This was quick and easy to put together.  Hubby ate one sandwich and I froze the rest in individual containers for his lunches.  He said it was good, but tasted like the sloppy joes I always make.  My personal recipe is very similar to this one.  I appreciated that this weeks choice was quick and I had all the ingredients on hand.  UPDATE:  Used this as a hot dog topping for dinner - very good.

I made this for recipe group for 3/24/12. I thought these were pretty yummy. I only had 1 lb of beef, so I had to cut the recipe in half, and it made about 4 good sized sandwiches. We toasted the buns in the toaster which was a good idea. I thought it looked like a homemade sloppy joe, but it did have a slight bbq flavor to it. This will be great to make, for a quick dinner, for little ones.

This is the first time we've made a recipe for the Recipe Group. I had been craving Sloppy Joes, so the timing was perfect. We really enjoyed this. We used half ground beef and half ground turkey because that is what we had on hand. We did not add the white sugar. The leftovers are great, too! We will make this again.

This was pretty good; I generally don't like sloppy joe, but I've been searching for a recipe that was close to my Dad's - which somehow got lost after he passed - this was pretty close. I actually LIKED this very much and will make again. I am going to pass it to my sister. Now I can say I don't hate sloppy joe any more :) Thank you!!

I made this recipe for New Years, I was worried I hadn't made enough the way people kept going back for seconds and thirds...truly a delicious sloppy joe!  I tweaked the recipe per a couple other reviews, and sorta burnt the hamburger..DH likes it this way.  I had mixed up all the ingredients in a bowl and after the hamburger was done cooking, I placed it all mixed together in the slow cooker on low for the first hour and keep warm after that!  Twice as good the next day.  (Update: I am making this for my family again tonight and serving it with rice and a veggie.  I was actually craving this this morning!!)  Thanks Samantha Kristina for an awesome recipe!!

We liked this a lot, I think the vinegar adds something that my usual BBQ sauce recipes are lacking. We'll definitely make this again. I did play around with the ratios/amounts of white/brown sugar so that it tasted best to me. And I used dried onion in place of minced fresh because I'm too lazy to cut up an onion just for 2 teaspoons! Thanks for sharing your recipe :)
