I have made this 3 times in the last month, it's delicious!  I actually make it and sell it at the local farm and art market.  Here's what I have changed:  I use 3- 7.5 oz. cans of biscuits, 1 1/4 c. sugar and 1/4 c. brown sugar.  If you don't add extra sugar, you will run out of the sugar/pudding mix.  I also melt an extra 1/2 stick butter, and then what's leftover, I pour over the bread before baking.  If you are not a big fan of butterscotch, don't worry, because it does not come out overwhelming at all!

I love this recipe. I grew up with the other monkey bread recipe that doesn't have butterscotch pudding and always liked them a lot. These are even better. The only problem is that it's hard to stop eating them. THey taste like gooey, caramel cinnamon rolls.

This recipe has become a Christmas morning tradition in my house. My 4 sons really look forward to it. It is so easy and absolutely delicious. Instead of shaking, I just dip the dough pieces into the butter and then dip them into the dry mix. I personally find that easier and quicker than shaking. Delicious! Will make again and again!

Everyone loved this.  I think shaking saves time if you choose a big enough container, so I appreciated that idea. These are more gooey than other recipes I have tried, and that's why they're so good!

This was my first time making monkey bread.  This recipe was GREAT!  My family loved it.  The only thing I changed, was that I used vanilla pudding, because I didn't have any butterscotch.

This was the best Monkey Bread that I've ever had and was my first time making Monkey Bread and it turned out so pretty as the picture. Very easy to make and fun for the kids to join in on making.  The only downfall is that it smells so good baking that you don't want to wait for it to cool in the bundt pan before diving in.  This did not last long at all after it was placed on a plate.  I'm sure this will be one of my most used recipes in the future.

I have made this two times now.  The first time I only had 2 cans of the full size grands biscuits that I quartered to make the equivalent of the 3 cans of 10 ounce biscuits.  While it was good it had a problem, it took longer to bake.  So I made it again with the right kind of biscuits and it was delicious.  I actually had to hide it from my kids so they wouldn't over indulge.  Oh, one other thing, I made 2 small changes: I used real butter in place of the margarine and I poured the remaining sugar mixture over the monkey bread before baking.  A really nice way to greet the family on cold mornings.  Thanks for sharing!

This is one of the simplest monkey bread recipes and it is absolutely phenomenal! We have now added this as one of our favorite Sunday breakfasts. It's an almost "must" that you use real butter, but this one's definitely a keeper!

If I could give this a 10 I'd give it a 20! :O) THE best! You must try this! Never mind, DON'T try it! I wanna keep the recipe ALL TO MYSELF and be famous someday! (grin) It is a bit messy to prepare but the final results are TDF! You will not be disappointed. I've made them twice now, within THREE days! Once with a springform pan and 4 cans of biscuits (a scrump-diddly-licious disaster!) then I made them again using muffin tins. (a scrump-diddly-licious *masterpiece) Ok, so a muffin isn't 'quite' considered a 'masterpiece' but the TASTE most absolutley, positively made up for their less-than-perfect appearance...and the DIS-appearance of these little monkeys is like MAGIC! ;0)  A big, sticky, ooey, gooey thanks for an aMAZING recipe!...although I should probably hunt you down and throw monkey bread at you for knowing what these will eventually do to my "quickly-disappearing-since-I-found-Allrecipes" waistline! :D

I have made this 5 times in last 2 months, 2 times with biscuits and 3 with frozen bread dough. It seems that both times I use biscuits, they were a little doughy for my taste, but by NO means would I consider them a flop!  They were still tasty. The other 3 times,  I used 24 frozen dinner roll dough balls, snipping them into thirds after thawing in the refrigerator overnight. I used 2 boxes of pudding and 1 c sugar, 1/2 c. brown sugar mixture as recommended by other reviewers, layering with pecans and dumped leftover mixture and butter on top.  I let the dough rise until to top pan (1 to 1-1/2 hrs) before cooking. On Christmas Eve I made a batch the night before and just put the pan in the refrigerator. The dough did still rise and I just set the pan out on counter for about 30-45 minutes before putting into oven. Turned out perfect.  I use Crisco to grease the pan and let cook for full 30 min and had no trouble with sticking.  Can't say anything more but YUM, YUM.  Thanks for the recipe.

Use: 3-7.5 oz. cans of biscuit dough
1 1/4 c. sugar
1/4 c. brown sugar
A generous pinch of salt
Cinnamon (pretty heaping tablespoon)
Pudding
Add an extra 1/2 stick of butter
Put 1/3 of nuts in the bottom of the pan, then do a layer of coated dough, nuts, layer of dough, nuts, dough. 

Mix the leftover butter and sugar mix and spread it over the top before baking. 

Next time, try covering it loosely with foil for the first 10 minutes or so; or cover it at the end again. 

Don't wait 30 minutes to turn it out of the pan.

I know I'm in the minority, but this just tasted too artifical & fake. I'm not a wholesome granola girl either. Fairly confident that even with my limited culinary skills I didn't screw this up. 

Reminds me of being little & mum just dunking the top of the biscuits in butter & brown sugar to satisy our sweet tooth. Much easier. Guess I grew up & so did my pallet too.

Turned out really good and very much the way I remember growing up except not quite as gooey Maybe pouring a little butter over top would help that and definately make more sugar/pudding mixture.  I made 1 1/4 cup sugar and 1/4 brown sugar with the same amount of pudding mix and cinnamon and had just enough with also another 1/2 stick melted butter and barely made it.  Will definately make again :o)

This is very good, I have made it several times now and am very happy with it. I have also used Vanilla pudding when I was unable to find Butterscotch and it is still very good.

This came out nice.  I had to make more coating, glad I decided to get that second box of pudding, and I needed to use more butter .  Other than that this was real simple to make.

These turned out awesome! Some slight changes....I did as suggested and used both brown and white sugar. The sugar and butter recommended was enough for 2 cans of biscuits - not 3. For me the bread was done at 23 minutes so keep a close eye on it and don't over bake!

Very good with the refrigerated biscuit dough, but a whopping, off-the-charts TEN stars if you can afford the time to sub Colleen's Potato Crescent Rolls recipe from this site. Just mix, allow to rise, punch down and shape into the balls, dip them, throw them into the bundt pan. You can make them the night before this way, and let them rise in the fridge, covered. Or you can give them the second rise immediately and bake. The "dip" for the dough is a nice change from the more traditional, straight cinnamon-cum-sugar mix. Lovely presentation.

I made this version of monkey bread this morning, as opposed to one without the butterscotch pudding.  This recipe is THE BEST!  You can't taste the pudding and it makes the glaze creamier!  I will never make the other recipe again!

This recipe was great! Quick and easy. The only problem was that as other users have said, the powder runs out too quickly.

This has a really good taste however it didnt have the ooey gooey carmel :/.Used my own bread dough and doubled the butter and sugar combo (using a previous commenters suggestion as to sugar content) And poured extra butter and some of the extra sugar on them. Still no goo. However made a cream cheese/powdered sugar frosting that was fabulous with it for taste.

I am so frustrated with the recipe.  I have made 3 times now and I cannot get it to cook through.  The 1st time I ended up overcooking it and the outside was hard as a rock and the inside was perfect.  The next 2 times I had to tear it apart- putting the middle back in the oven to finish baking.  UGH!  Next time I am trying a 9X13 pan instaed of the tube pan.  I won't be able to invert it but at least it might cook through.  I do double the pudding the mixture but I always have some leftover.  The flavor is great- I just wish it would bake evenly!

So good! Easy too. I used a bundt pan since I think a tube pan would have leaked all over the oven. Also used two cans of 16 oz jumbo buttermilk biscuits. Accidently got low fat ones and it still worked. Had plenty of ooey gooeyness. I think the folks that ran out of the sugar mixture maybe used instant pudding. That has much less than the cook and serve. You have to use cook and serve.

I'm making this today for about the fifth time.  My kids (4 & 6) LOVE this.  For us, I prefer the Grands biscuits.  We only need 1.5 tubes.  It fills the bundt pan and does get gooey if it's not over cooked.  Sunday morning favorite in my house!!!

The butterscotch pudding really makes a difference in canned biscuits!  This is a very acceptable alternative to frozen or homemade roll dough traditional monkey bread recipe. Of course these are best eaten as soon as they are cool enough to put in your mouth, but even several hours later these tasted great.

The first time I made this, I did not have a bundt pan, so I made a small batch in a casserole dish. It turned out so delicious. It was so good, I went the next day and bought a bundt pan so I could make some for my in laws. It did not cook all the way through. The top was hard, and the pieces underneath did not cook all the way. I wound up throwing most of it out. If anyone has a secret on how to get it cooked all the way through, please let me know. I would love to make it again in a bigger batch.

I am 13 years old and when i made this is turned out so good. I only made a few changes, I made my own biscuits instead of buying the refrigerated ones (It's more work but I think it turns out better), and I also added a bit of brown sugar (Since I'm younger I like it sweeter but I don't think many adults would prefer it that way). There is only 1 reason I gave it 4 stars and that is because it didn't come out of the pan very well... LOL still great!

My two sons and budding chefs made this and we all gave it two thumbs up!
I agree there isn't enough pudding/sugar mixture for all three cans of biscuits.  We had to improvise and use some more cinnamon and sugar mixed quickly.  It was time consuming for the boys, but well within their capabilities.  Next time, we'll try it with just to cans and see how that works for us.
It smells wonderful and tastes great.
We will definitely make this again.

One warning DO NOT WAIT 30 MINUTES TO INVERT INTO A SERVING PLATE. I did that and only half of it came out. Even after I sprayed the pan, it still stuck. Invert immediately.  Also, I used 1/4 cup brown sugar and 1/2 cup white. It gave it more umph!

We have this for Christmas every year and it has been such a huge hit that most of my family, including my mom, has adopted the recipe.  It's absolutely amazing!!  I suggest hand-dipping the cut biscuits in the butter by the handfull (5-7 pieces) and then rolling them in the sugar mix.  You will use more butter and sugar, but the result is much much much yummier!  Also, make sure to spray the pan well because the bread likes to stick.  Amazing recipe!!

I added 2/3 brown sugar and would have just replaced it with the regular sugar but it was an after thought.  Next time I plan to substitute the sugar with 3/4 brown sugar.  I used kitchen scissors to cut the dough into 4ths, worked really well and was quick.  So quick and easy to make!  Taste really good too!

Absolutely delicious!  Everyone I had for dinner loved it.  The only thing I found was that the sugar mixture needs to be doubled...I ran out and unfortunately didn;t have any more butterscotch pudding so I mixed together sugar, brown sugar and cinnamon for 1/2 of it.  Next time I will def double the mixture.  Thanks!

I really didn't like the taste of the refrigerator biscuits.  The pudding and sugar mixture caused it to turn out grainy and clumpy.  It's not much harder to use frozen bread dough and make your own caramel mixture, which I will be doing from now on.  I was surprised it was so bad.

Tasty.  So very, very tasty.  We ate this with glee and gusto.  Only used 2 cans of biscuits as the stuff ran out.  Also, will turn the pan over  maybe 15 minutes into cooling next time as all the caramel ran to the top.  But....tasty.  So very, very tasty.

This was excellent. I gave it 4 stars because I, too, ran out of sugar/pudding mixture. I used the cook n'serve pudding and made the recipe exactly as stated. I ran out with 6 biscuits left to cut and add. Next time, maybe I'll use another box of pudding (or find a large box). I ended up throwing together some more sugar/cinnamon mixture (without pudding) in the end, but that part of the bread was dry and not gooey. I suppose you could stir it up a little before baking to distribute the pudding mixture more. The kids and their friends loved it, though, so I'll try it again. I found this to be better than the monkey bread you pour the melted butter/sugar over.

This was a fun Sunday morning breakfast. I only had instant butterscotch pudding so that's what I used. This was my first Monkey Bread, so I don't know what kind of difference the cook and serve pudding makes--gooeyier, perhaps? Well, these were nice and sticky and everyone loved them. I did run out of the dry mixture with a few biscuit pieces left, so next time I'm either adding more sugar or I'll go easier on that step. I also think that on my next batch I might just use one or two rolls of biscuits and, instead of using a bundt pan, use a muffin pan. Will definitely make again!

My family loves this bread.  I usually run out of the dry ingredients so I double everything.  I use vanilla pudding, walnuts, and this recipe is great with Honey Butter biscuts.

They are good. The butterscotch flavor got lost in the cinnamon. And they aren't very sticky, but still good.

Even though this was good, I was a little disappointed that it wasn't as gooey as some that I have tried and the middle pieces were kinda dry.  My kids thought it was amazing, and my 8 year old thought it was a lot of fun to help make!

This was so easy to make.  The whole family loved it, will make it a regular from now on.  The only downfall - the serving size!  Instead of 10 as suggested, it fed just 2 adults and 2 teens - Yup it's that good!!

I WISH I knew that the provided picture is covered in some sort of sauce. Mine came out delicious but definitely was not ooy-gooey due to the fact that there was no sauce in the recipe. Other than that delicious. Next time I will melt margarine and brown sugar in a pan and pour over the bread before it is cooked in order to make it gooey.

Monkey Bread is not something we are familiar with here in Canada BUT that is going to change. WOW. Talk about addictive. Delicious, scrumptious and definitely in demand since I made the first one. I will evenually try a couple of different varieties but I have a feeling this is the one we will invite to stay. Thank you Carol.

LEMON BLUEBERRY MONKEY BREAD!!! I did not have any butterscotch pudding mix but I did have lemon so I decided to give that a try. I omitted the cinnamon and in it's place added 1 tsp ground ginger, and some fresh blueberries! This was so good- I think I even like it more than original Monkey bread! Next time I would decrease the sugar to about 1/2 cup. And it looks pretty too!!

I made this recipe for a family event and they gobbled it up!  Everyone could not believe how easy it was to make when I told them about it. I will definitely make this recipe again and highly recommend it to others to try for a delicious, easy sweet treat! Like other reviewers said, make some additional pudding/sugar/cinnamon mixture for rolling. Enjoy!

Heard about monkey bread and wanted to try it, so I chose this recipe just a week ago.  I made my second batch of it last night!  I love this stuff and so easy to make, I didn't change anything!  Will be making another one tomorrow for the Super Bowl party on Sunday!

It was easy and tasty. I didn't have pecans (no problem but would like to try it with them next time). I added a dash of salt to the pudding mixture.  The bottom rolls didn't cook so it was doughy on the bottom. I left in my oven (turned off) to try and finish them.

VERY good, but I have found it is even better when you make the sticky bun dough froms scratch (like you are making cinnamon rolls). Takes a little more work and time because it uses yeast, but if you do it in your bread machine, it is well worth the extra hour!

The rating that I am giving refers to the ingrediants that I used: While I like the idea of ready-to-bake dough, I prefer to make mine from scratch if I have the time, which is what I did.  I used an 8g pack of yeast, mixed with a cup of warm water and a tsp of sugar, proofed it for 10 min, and then mixed with 3 cups of flour.  By hand, I knead the dough for 10 minutes, until smooth and elastic.  I then let it rise in an oiled bowl for an hour, covered with a tea towel.  After it has risen, I punch it down, pour out onto a floured surface, knead it for a few minutes and then let it rest again, for 10 minutes, before portioning out into little rolled balls.  I then followed the rest of the recipe (melted butter/pudding/sugar/cinnamon) and let them rise again, covered, for another 15 minutes, and baked for 30 minutes at 350. After letting it rest for half an hour (yes, a lot of waiting but so worth it), I turned them out on a platter, and there was a nice ooey, gooey caramel sauce coating them.  My husband and sons enjoyed them and I hope to make them again.  I will follow the original recipe in a pinch if needed, as I'm sure they'd be great.

My thoughts: Recipe calls for refrigerated biscuits, well if you don't buy this often let me tell you there are too many kinds out there.  I bought the Pillsbury GRANDS (grands=bigger size) 16.5 oz 2 cans was enough.  My mistake I bought them buttermilk and the monkey bread came out a bit tooo buttery (they do have plain original or homestyle biscuits).  I do have to confess I followed someone's review recomendations and increased the butter and sugar mixture but even doing that the bread was not wet and glossy like the picture, it came out looking dry, it was nice and sticky between pieces but was hoping for some more caramel sauce. Next time I will buy Original pillsbury biscuits, no butter flavor, I will also not add the butterschoth pudding mix (I think that added to the buttery flavor). Instead I might add this: cook aside on stove some brown sugar, butter and corn syrup as a syrup to add on top.  I made it on a bundt pan.  I am curious how the person on this recipe got it to be sooo glossy for the picture, maybe there is something not clear on the recipe?

This is similar to a recipe my dad made every year except we use frozen dinner rolls like Rhodes rolls and brown sugar. Then layer the pudding/sugar mix and dollops of butter with rolls. Then we let it sit in the oven to rise overnight and just turn on the oven and let it bake when we get up.

That's so funny. I chose to make this because I saw you were from McLeansboro! I grew up down there so I figured it was the same as my mom used to make. It was wonderful, thanks for sharing the recipe!

I'm giving this five stars for taste and ease of preparation. My mom used to make monkey bread but her recipe didn't call for the butterscotch pudding mix.  Changes I made:  I didn't have a bundt pan or a tube pan so I used my glass deep dish pie pan.  I only had one can of biscuits and no pecans.  I melted the putter in the pie dish and dropped the biscuit pieces in.  Sprinkled half the sugar mixture over the top, turned the pieces over and sprinkled the rest over that.  Baked for about 18 minutes.  This was great.

Not as good as the monkey bread I'm used to. The kind I've had before has more sticky glaze. I think they could've been baked a little longer too, mine were a little doughy in the middle.

I used frozen dinner rolls since that's what I had on hand.  Used 24 rolls, let it sit out overnight to thaw, and popped it in the oven the next morning.  The family loved it!

I have to make this again because I changed the recipe and it didn't turned out right, so this review is just to warn other cooks of what NOT to do.  I used all brown sugar and it was too dark and carmelized, definately use white and brown.  Also I poured the extra left over butter over the top before cooking.  It turned out to be way too much butter, some of the pieces were completely drenched in butter and tasted gross.  The only good thing I did was use 2 boxes of pudding so I had enough.  Other than that I would suggest just following the recipe.  Despite the bad changes I made the kids still devoured it!

Absolutely the best monkey bread recipe!!!  I have reviewed several others and was disapointed with the lack of favor.  This recipe with the butterscotch pudding is genius.  Who would've thought.  Wow.  My family loves it and brags to thier friends about it.
I used two cans of grands biscuits and cut them into six pieces.  Worked out great.

These were fabulous! I cut this recipe down, because it was just a few of us for breakfast. I used one tube of Grand's biscuits. (I only had the butter flavor, and they were great.) I found it easier to just dip the pieces in butter and then in the sugar mixture, but shaking would work too. I baked it in a bundt pan for about 17 minutes and they turned out perfectly. I whipped up an easy glaze (powdered sugar, milk, and vanilla) and poured it on top. Delicious! I will absolutely, positively make these again. :) Thanks for the recipe.

A few notes:  I did run out of pudding/sugar mix and butter but I was being VERY liberal dunking the biscuit pieces in the mixture and not shaking them in a container.  Also, when you put the dough in the container, make sure the dough has room to rise when you  bake it.  Otherwise, the gooey sugar will overflow your pan and set off the fire alarm.  It still tastes incredible.

This is great. The butterscotch pudding makes it nice and gooey. I have made a slightly different recipe and it was dry. I did double up on the dry ingredients and went heavy on the butter. I'm wondering how it would taste as a muffin.

I made this for my family and they DEVOURED it in less than an hour.  It was absolutely heavenly, and surely a new tradition in our family.  

I doubled the mix of sugar, pudding and cinnamin, and used candied pecans.  Plus, Instead of using all white sugar, I used 1/2 white sugar and 1/2 brown sugar.  I baked it in a stoneware fluted pan.  It came out perfect!

My mom made this recipe and it was delicious!  The only difference is she used 12 yeast rolls instead of biscuits.  You can get them frozen and just thaw them beforehand.

So very good!  I have request for it all the time since I have made it. The best recipe ever.  I have tried it using 3/4 c of brown sugar and 3/4 c. of white sugar. I also use four 10 oz cans. Its time consuming, but so yummy when I dip each quarter in the butter, instead of margerine, then put it in the bag of sugar mix.

I dont have a bundt or tube pan. I just used a shallow circular pan and cut up one tube of biscuits (with a pizza cutter - nice suggestion) and followed the rest of instructions and threw them in the pan.  I did keep the rest of the ingreadients the same.  I did heat some brown sugar and butter for extra sauce and pured that in the pan on top of the biscuits as well before baking.  This was a nice serving portion (for 5 of us).  I can't imagine how much bread you would have using 3 cans of biscuits!

DELICIOUS!  This was the first time I have made monkey bread and it was fantastic!  I took the advice of Mrs. Houston and added the extra white sugar, brown sugar and butter.  I used Grands, Home-style Biscuits and I cut each into six pieces.  They came out in perfect bite size pieces.  I took these to a football tailgate party and I was very popular!  People could not believe how yummy they were!  I plan to make this a lot more and I am already planning to make these for Christmas morning.  I am going to try making them the night before so I just have to bake them in the morning.

This came out really tasty. I follewed to recipe ALMOST exactly... I just added 1/4 c of brown sugar to the mixture. I don't have a bundt pan, so I used a pie pan instead. The only problem was that the bottom layer didn't cook! After 30 mins, it was still completely raw. Ths was an easy fix, I just rearranged the pieces of bread so the uncooked parts were exposed to heat on the top and bottom. So the cook time ended up being around 45 minutes. No big deal, it was delicious!!

I made this with my 15 year old nephew last weekend.  It was E-A-S-Y, preparation was fast and the end result was really, really good.  I used some frozen restaurant-style biscuits.  I would not use them again.  They were much too "soft" and fluffy.  Grands would be a little more dense...the texture I would most prefer.  The only thing I did differently is mix the left over butter with the syrup before we poured it over our creation.  I was simply wonderful.

wonderful and delicious - I used 1 1/4 c white sugar, and 1/4 c brown sugar, as one reviewer suggested, and poured remaining sugar and butter over bread before baking.  Love it!  Perfect for our monkey birthday party cake - everyone loved it!

My family loved it!  It was easy to make. I took the advice of a few. I used 3 packages of biscuits. I didn't slice them in quarters since it was small. I did use 2 cubes of butter putting remaining butter on top.  Much easier than another recipe I was using. I can't wait to make again!

So yummy & easy to make! It did need more time in the oven (55 min) however I used a silicone tube pan instead. I used a mixture of chopped pecans & peanuts

I just got done making this. It's great. I had to make a double batch because I have a really big bunt pan. It didn't work so well because the outside got really hard and some of the middle is still not all the way done. The hardness is from trying to cook it longer so it would all be done. I guess I will just have to get a smaller pan. Thanks for the recipe.

My Monkey Bread did not turn out at all gooey like the photo shows.  Are you supposed to dump in the left over butter and sugar/pudding mix? It doesn't say to do that in the instructions. I think if these were gooey they would be much better.

I've made this with frozen dinner rolls in the past and will probably go back to that.  The biscuits were gooey and underdone.  Also fell apart when trying to remove from pan despite heavy coating of the pan.  Ran out of butter before I ran out of biscuits.  Recipe should have an additional 30 minutes added to "Ready in".  I didn't allow enough time before wanting to serve and tried to shorten up the time cooling in the pan as I had hungry people sitting at the breakfast table.  That might be why all the topping (my favorite part) ended up left in the pan with the top layer of biscuits.  I find it tedious cutting up the biscuits--too labor-intensive for a Christmas morning breakfast.  At least the bread dough rolls can be made the night before.  My kids liked this or I would have given it only one or two stars.

this was great.  we used a jello pan and had to cook it almost double the time stated because it was very doughy on the inside.  I will spray the pan better next time because it stuck a little- it would have been very pretty if it all came out in one piece!

This turned out so great! We didn't have a bundt cake pan available, so we just did it in a casserole dish. It took a few minutes longer to bake, but tasted great and was unbelievable. The reviews from the family have been great as well... everything from it being called amazing about sixteen times by my father in law, to being referred to as, "Angel kisses" by my sister in law. If you are searching for a monkey bread recipe, THIS IS THE ONE FOR YOU! Thanks for sharing such a great recipe

This is soo awsome and sooooooooooooo easy to make.  I have made this several times and it never lasts long in my house.  The first time I made it was at Christmas for my in-laws, and I was a bit worried as I never make anything for guests without trying out the recipe first.  I kept thinking there is now way this is going to turn out.  Well it did and it's perfect every single time I make it.

Made these for the first time yesterday.  Flavor is very good, and the recipe was easy to prepare.  I baked for the required time and mine weren't quite done in the middle.  Will have to experiment, as the recipe is worth having!  Thanks

Made these for the second time, using the bundt pan as per instructions.  MUCH better results!!  Really tasty, and very attractive.  Got tired and cut the last can and a half into halves and it worked fine.  Did add 1/2 c brown sugar to the dry ingredients.  Otherwise as directed.  Will try adding raisins instead of nuts next time!  Thank for the recipes!  A+

I wish I could give this a hundred stars. I'm not kidding. My dad, my boyfriend, everyone ate it all up in one night after dinner. I kept going back into the kitchen for more. It's so simple and I couldn't believe how great it turned out from refrigerated biscuits! Will make over and over again for sure.

The kids loved helping make this yummy treat.  Only change we made was to double the pudding/sugar/cinnamon mixture.  It would have been impossible to coat all the pieces of dough (that we cut with scissors rather than tear) with the amount of mix the recipe calls for.  A new weekend fave!

I love this monkey bread!  I've used this recipe a few times and I always use loaf pans rather than a round one and put one can of biscuits in each pan...I do this so nuts can be added to one (the kids don't like the nuts) and left out of the other.  This morning I'm making just one loaf, one can of biscuits, half the sugar/pudding mixture and a loaf pan...saving the other half of the sugar mixture for next weekends breakfast!  YUM!

These are SO delicious.  I was making the overnight ones with the butterscotch pudding and they are MUCH easier.  But I like the taste of these better.  These are very messy too-but sometimes it's fun to get messy if you know what you're in for!  I used the Ziploc bag like other reviewers suggested.  It was nice to be able to throw some of the mess away!

The flavor was great!  Very similar to what I remember as a kid.  My stepdaughter thought they were excellent.  My problem was that although I did spray the pan, they still stuck.  Next time I might try adding some melted butter to the biscuits in the pan before baking.  Thanks for a very flavorful recipe.

I thought it was okay. My husband complained about the dough that was used. He'd like me to make the dough as well. Not happening!
