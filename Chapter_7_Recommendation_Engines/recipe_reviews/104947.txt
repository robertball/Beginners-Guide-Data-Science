I guess I'm one of the few who prepared this as written--with the rosemary. I used a little less than called for, but it complemented the asparagus and mushrooms well and was a nice addition. Simple, easy, delicious, and makes for a beautiul presentation on the dinner plate.

This was so easy.  I put the asparagus and mushrooms on the cookie sheet then just poured the olive oil over them and tossed them with my hands.  That way I didn't dirty up a bowl.  Then I sprinkled it with chopped, dried rosemary and regular salt and it turned out great.  Also, the asparagus really shrink up so it's okay if you have slightly more than a single layer of stalks.  Just stir them halfway through the roasting.

Great recipe! I've made this several times. White mushrooms are good, portobellos are great. I've tried this with thick asparagus and found roasting for 15 minutes is good. But I tried pencil thin ones once, and 15 minutes was too long and they got burnt and mushy.

I assumed the mushrooms were included in the roasting, after all they're combined in a bowl & drizzled w/ the oil, etc. Very good! I'd rate it PERFECT, just add a little common sense! Thanks for sharing it!

This was fabulous.  I left off the rosemary because I just can't stand it, and used some minced garlic instead.  We were so impressed with the way the tips of the asparagus got all delicious and crunchy!  I've made it twice this week (asparagus was on sale), once with the mushrooms and once without.  This is now my favorite way to cook asparagus!

I used Baby Bella mushrooms, and I enjoyed the winning combination of asparagus & mushrooms. Although I love fresh rosemary and use it frequently, I found out today I don't care for it with asparagus--seems to make it bitter. However, I believe that is a personal preference, and this recipe is a good one. I used a little more olive oil. The recipe is perfect as to the portions and the roasting time; I'll try again with a different herb. Thanks leo67!

What happens to the mushrooms?  This recipe only suggests you roast the asparagus.  Is there a typo or is she serious?

I roast asparagus all the time and it’s one of our favorites.  So I knew immediately that I would lower the oven temperature on this to 400 and cut back on the roasting time significantly - to 8 minutes.  The asparagus turned out fine, bright green and crisp tender,  as I expected it would, but the mushrooms looked a little dry in spots.  I think I’d skip roasting the mushrooms next time and just sauté them separately in a pan, then top the asparagus with them when plating.

This recipe has been a family favorite for years, my recipe has some small changes: no salt, 2 Tablespoons of olive oil to coat well, crush rosemary with a mortor and pestel and roast 500 degrees for 10 minutes. The asparagus without the mushrooms are good too.

Delicious.  Took a risk and made for a dinner party with new friends.  Everyone LOVED it, even the kids!  I crushed dried rosemary into a powder and sprinkled over before baking to reduce the stick like factor dried rosemary can sometimes have.

Fantastic. The only change I made was to use dried rosemary as I didn't have any fresh on hand. We loved it, thank you!

This was a great Idea.   I love butter taste, so I used butter instead of olive oil.  I also added garlic powder, no rosemary, and i i sprinkled parmesan cheese while it was roasting.  Delicious.

Great recipe.  Did not use the rosemary as I did not have any.  I used garlic instead.  Put the asparagus, mushrooms, garlic, oil, etc in a gallon size bag to mix up the ingredients and then poured out on my foil lined pan.  Baked at 400 for about 15-20 minutes and they were perfect.  Loved the flavor of the mushrooms and loved the easy recipe.  A keeper!  Easy recipe - easy clean up.

Wow, this was really good!  I've always roasted my asparagus in just olive oil, salt, and pepper...I never would have thought to add mushrooms or rosemary (not always a fan), but it really is delicious.  Even my husband can make this, it's so easy!  We did have to take it out of the oven a few minutes earlier than the time listed, but the asparagus we used was very skinny (which I prefer). We also used dried rosemary instead of fresh.  I think next time I'll use the fresh, and try adding garlic like some other reviewers did.  Thanks for the recipe, this will definitely be in our regular rotation.

My asparagus was really thin so I put it in the oven after the mushrooms had been in about 7 minutes. Cooked it for 7 more minutes because I like my asparagus very al dente. Also added rough chopped up garlic with the asparagus. Sprinkled with Parmesan after it cooked. I felt like my fresh rosemary took on a burnt flavor so next time I'll leave it out.

Great way to cook asparagus.  I used baby portabellas (halved) and fairly thin asparagus spears.  I reduced the heat to 400 and baked for 10 minutes (due to the skinnier spears) and it came out perfect.  Definitely worth repeating.

I think that it would make a lot more sense to mix the ingredients ON the pan instead of in a bowl, seeing as the shape of the asparagus is awkward in a bowl.

The rosemary has a very stick-like texture, which does not cook out with this recipe and is something I found unappetizing.

I used very thick asparagus, and with the temperature and time that was given, it was not fully cooked when taken out of the oven. I think that it should be specified in the recipe to use thinner asparagus.

I felt as though the taste was not as good as it could have been. Maybe adding some garlic would make it a little better, as was suggested in some of the comments.

Overall, I'd say that the general idea of the recipe has potential, but with how it was written, I think that it needs a lot of work.

I was a bit skeptical about cooking with olive oil at such a high heat, but this turned out delicious!  I think this will be my new way to cook asparagus.  I may play around with other seasonings in place of the rosemary, just for some variety, but the recipe is excellent as is.

I did not have time to roast my asparagus, since I was packing my lunch for work at the last minute.  I simply put frozen asparagus spears in a microwaveable container, sliced mushrooms on top of them,. added diced garlic, drizzled with olive oil and nuked at lunch time. It was fantastic!  I will try the roasting method when I have more time.

I use garlic instead of rosemary (I don't like the stick texture of rosemary) and it's perfect every time! I also just spray some cooking oil on the pan and the vegetables and top with the seasonings, rather than mixing it in a separate dish. I like saving myself time with the clean-up :-)

This has the BEST flavor.  I didn't add the rosemary because I didn't have any, but added some seasoning salt instead...it was excellent.  My asparagus was on the thin side so it took 10 minutes and it was perfect.

The recipe doesn't say what to do with the mushrooms so I just threw them in with the asparagus.  It was delicious; however, instead of using rosemary, I substitutd garlic salt.  Everyone loved it and it was SOOOOO simple.  I've made this several times now.

This is a perfect hot veggie side dish.  I added minced garlic.  Even my 3 and 2-yr-olds ate it.  Yum!

This was fantastic and so-o-o easy; the mushrooms and asparagus were cooked to perfection.  I used portabella mushrooms, quartered.  Based on comments from others, rather than mincing the rosemary, I just pulled sprigs off of the stem and sprinkled over so could be easily removed if not wanted. I also added a couple of dashes of garlic powder.  Also, when I removed from the oven, I sprinkled over with balsamic vinegar—excellent!  Will definitely make again –and again.

Thank you for this great base recipe.  I chose to add some white wine, homemade chicken stock and a splash of worcestershire to my olive oil and marinated the veggies for half a day before roasting.  Very good.  Added fresh thyme sprigs and a little lemon zest to the rosemary, and garlic, green beans and thick red onion slices to the veggies b/c I was very hungry.  paired with flash fried lemony rockfish, delicious.

Prepared the recipe as written.  I thought it was only ok, nothing special.  Maybe rosemary isn't my herb of choice?  I probably won't make it again.

This turned out excellent - and EASY! I left out the the Rosemary, because it didn't "go" with the rest of the meal. Also added a pinch of garlic powder.

This was wonderful!  My husband doesn't care for rosemary so I used garlic instead and sprinkled a little bit of grated parmesan over the top once it came out of the oven.  The mushrooms were carmelized and yummy.  Thanks for the great recipe!

This was wonderful!  I doubled the asparagus and olive oil, but used the mushrooms and rosemary as called for.  I think (scant) 1/2 tsp. coarse salt + 1/4 tsp. pepper are the perfect amounts.  Mine were stacked on top of each other, and that didn't matter - I stirred it once, halfway through roasting.  My asparagus were thin, so I roasted for 12 minutes - perfect!  Thanks for the recipe!

Delicious!  I didn't have fresh rosemary so I used dried rosemary.  I placed the asparagus on a baking sheet, place the quartered mushrooms on top of the asparagus and added slices of bacon cut into about 1 inch pieces.  Then I sprinkled with rosemary and basil and pepper, and drizzled with olive oil.  Fantastic!

I generally enjoy roasted vegetables but had not roasted asparagus before.  I don't think I will be again.  This recipe really was not great for me.  It ended up being salty for me and the rosemary (I did have to use dry) added nothing.  I had young small asparagus spears which seemed to just dry out and get tough.

This is the recipe I use in the summer time.  I use sea salt, as Kosher and table salt aren't good for you and sea salt is, toss with olive oil and put the asparagus directly on the grill.  They only take a few minutes and it's just delish!  The mushrooms are different, but I like those the same way. I wrap a portabello in foil with garlic, butter, and sea salt and grill about 45 minutes. Serve with the asparagus and everyone is happy.

Easy addition for our Thanksgiving meal.  I threw in some carrots to make it more pleasing to my kids.  Cooked at 400 for about 10 minutes and then turned the oven off to keep everything warm while I finished up some other dishes.  Yum!

OMG this is so good!  I used about 1/2 tsp of dried rosemary and added one clove of minced garlic out of the jar and white mushrooms.  The asparagus was small and I had it in for about 13-14 minutes and it was perfect.  So delicious I will make this again and again, may experiment with other vegetables as well.

I've made this numerous times since discovering it.  Everyone in my family likes it, though one kid skips the mushrooms.    Sometimes I saute the asparagus and mushrooms in the olive oil, since some of the meals I cook with this require the oven at a different temp.  I've enjoyed it both baked & sauteed.  I always use the fresh rosemary and think it adds to it.  Yum!

This recipe compliments  both the asparagus and the mushrooms ver nicely. 
Noting that some reviewers thought the mushrooms turned out  too dry, I waited half way through the cooking time before adding the mushrooms. 
I'm not sure that I would use dried rosemary- the two sprigs of fresh rosemary that the recipe called for added just the right hint of flavor; dried rosemary might be too overpowering-rosemary is not a shy herb.

I combined this with a second recipe for cooked asparagus and cherry tomatoes with parmesan and the combo of mushrooms, asparagus, parm, tomatoes, rosemary and olive oil was a total winner!  Even my son that hates asparagus loved it all.

I put a little to much salt on it, put that was my fault.  It was really good and had some left over and am putting it in a salad for tomorrow.  I made it to go with Garlic Salmon and a small salad.  What a meal it was!

Some read before tips:

1) To avoid the rough, branchy part of asparagus (the cut end), hold the asparagus and "snap" off the ends. Where it breaks is where the branchy part ends and the best part is left. Again, this leaves you with the best part of the asparagus without the toughness. This goes for the super thin as well as the super thick varieties.

2) Do not wash/rinse your mushrooms. Mushrooms are like little sponges and will absorb the water making it so the olive oil cannot be blended. Get moist paper towels and wipe off any debris from the mushrooms then trim off the ends.

3) Since asparagus is long and doesn't work well in round bowls, use a Ziploc bag...put the asparagus and mushrooms into the bag and pour in the EVOO with seasonings and massage to coat, then pour out onto roasting pan. As mentioned in 2), the EVOO will then be able to be absorbed by the mushrooms.

4) If you have fresh rosemary then any person who doesn't care for its texture can scrap it off. If you don't have fresh rosemary, use dried rosemary for those who like the herb. Crush it up with a pestle and mortar if you have one or finely chop. Be sure to remember the 3:1 ratio - 3 times fresh equal 1 time dried.

5) If you chose to deviate from the recipe with adding garlic powder, etc. then keep in mind your review is your alteration and not the one as written. Try it as written first, then alter to your taste.

Loved it. I used half butter and half coconut oil to replace the olive oil. Turned out great. Made it again and added some balsamic glaze to when tossing. Also used a handful of fresh basil and topped it with a tablespoon of grated Parmesan. Yum Yum

I cut back on the Rosemary and added minced garlic and Parmesan cheese. I may eliminate the Rosemary all together....not a big fan of the spice/herb.

This is a wonderful regular recipe when asparagus is in season. I tried the original recipe and everyone liked it. The third time I made this I added 3 cloves of fresh minced garlic (as it's a favorite of mine) and I got raves from the family. They asked that I prepare it this way from now on. I highly recommend this recipe.

This is my go to recipe for asparagus.  I make it monthly just cutting the olive oil to 1 teaspoon. My husband eats very few vegetables and requests this.

Wow, I used 2 teaspoons of dried rosemary, did my best to crush it up without a mortar and pestel. In a bowl, I sprinkled the crushed rosemary over the asparagus and mushrooms, added salt and crushed black pepper, mixed well with my hands, then drizzled olive oil (did this by eye until I felt enough to cover all) and then mixed again with my hands. I also used olive oil to lightly coat the baking sheet. Spread asparagus and mushrooms in a single layer and cooked for 15 minutes  at 450 degrees. DELICIOUS and all cooked perfectly. If you prefer soft vegetables, you will need to cook longer than the 15 minutes.  Great and easy recipe! Thank you so much.

I wasn't excited about this recipe because I personally find mushrooms to be vial. However, my toddler loves them and they're full of nutrients so I thought I'd try this. I loved it so much that I craved it until I made it again the next night! With this recipe, I could eat mushrooms all day! I didn't think these mushrooms had a mushroomy taste. I used baby bella mushrooms. I also added two cloves of sliced garlic just because I love garlic. The second night I made it, I added one green zucchini since I had one I needed to use. I included the rosemary, as called for in the recipe. This was a hit for my whole family. Thank you so much for a mushroom recipe that I don't have to pretend to like in front of my toddler!

i made this recipe but i didn't have mushrooms or rosemary so i used some lemon pepper instead. usually I try to rate based on the original recipe. but as I was forced to improvised I figure the recipe was simple enough it didn't make to much of a difference. this was excellent and the asparagus didn't have the stringy affect. I will be making this again and again :)

Asparagus is out of season, but I really wanted this dish. Asparagus and mushrooms pair beautifully and the rosemary is a nice addition. I love roasting vegetables of all kinds, so much flavor. Used Baby Bella (crmini) and only had dried rosemary. The directions are spot on, although I did have to roast a bit longer. This was the perfect side for salmon and wild rice. Can't wait for spring with 'real' local asparagus and fresh from the garden rosemary.

I add pieces (tenders or chunks) of cooked chicken to this and it becomes a one dish meal (mix everything together right on the pan).  Fantastic & healthy & EASY.  (5 stars even without additions) 
I use 'baby bella' mushrooms.  I also will just set the sprigs of rosemary in the pan- you get some of the favor without the tough pieces of rosemary that turn some people off (like my kids...)  I've cooked asparagus like this for years and love the addition of mushrooms & rosemary.

This is very tasty and good for you.  I had some fresh asparagus and some mushrooms that needed to be used up and this was perfect along side my pork steaks. Quick and easy, will make again!***Made again along with steaks on the grill.  This was a perfect side dish. I used baby bellas this time.

Didn't have rosemary on hand but just went with the olive oil, salt, pepper and garlic powder. Sliced mushrooms were a nice touch. Just make sure you don't overdo the salt. Very quick and easy - I just eyed the ingredients and added a little melted butter out of the oven because I don't think I put enough olive oil on it.  Excellent side dish!

This is now my favorite way to prepare asparagus.  I whipped this up very easily and I'm so glad I came across this recipe.  I didn't have fresh rosemary, so I tried what I had, dried ground rosemary, and it still was very good.  I think I used more like 2 tablespoons of olive oil, too.

Quick and easy roasted vegetable dish. I added a little garlic salt and cayenne, and the results were really good. My asparagus came out a limper than I usually like it, so I might not cook for as long next time.

Very good. The rosemary added the extra flavor.
We prefer our asparagus to be roasted longer and the only change I would make is to add the mushrooms
The last 5 to 10 minutes. Thank you for Sharing.

Delicious....I used asparagus spears that were a bit thicker...not pencil like and had no problems with them drying out at all....They were perfect with the mushrooms, I used baby bellas. Also loved the rosemary. Simple and very good....served with grilled chicken burgers...thanks!

Yummy! We didn't use the rosemary because we ended up eating this alongside curry (funny, I know, hey it's fusion cooking!) but it didn't even need the rosemary, was so tasty.

Wow! That is really all I can say! My husband says he has found his new favorite vegetable! I did use jarred mushrooms instead of fresh because that was what I had. Still was absolutely amazing!

This did not work for me.  I followed the recipe to the letter, but decided to add whole garlic cloves to the mix.  I think that I added too much olive oil by sprinkling some over everything just before putting it into the oven.  My oven is an electric/convection type, and I think it cooks must faster and hotter than average.  I didn't take that into account.  The asparagus remided me of burned bamboo shoots, but the mushrooms and garlic were WONDERFUL!  Almost set off the smoke alarms with this recipe, too.

If I just want to "whip up" some asparagus from our garden, I usually just fry them with a little olive oil and seasoning.    If I have mushrooms, I often throw them in as well.      This recipe is essentially the same as how I cook asparagus without a recipe except that this recipe calls for roasting instead of frying.   I'll fry next time.   This asparagus got too dry in less than the 15 minutes suggested for roasting.

I'm not a huge fan of Asparagus, but I might change my mind after this recipe!  I used baby portabellas and followed the reciped almost exactly.  I did add 2 chopped cloves of garlic to this because I love garlic and couldn't help myself.  This was super easy to make and I loved using all the fresh ingredients and the fragrance of the rosemary.  This would be an easy and healthy side to a countless number of meals.  Thanks so much for sharing!!!

5 stars with about 2 table spoons of lemon juice sprinkled on top of the asparagus and mushrooms before roasting. Also I roasted some yellow onion. :)))) The rosemary, lemon juice, and salt has a party in your mouth! This will be a staple side dish at our home! SO EASY!!!

I liked the asparagus with the mushrooms.  I went light with the rosemary because, altho fresh rosemary is my fav herb, I had never imagined it with asparagus.  Glad I did because I think any more would of ruined it for me. We liked this - thanks!

This was an excellent recipe.  Easy and tasty.  My asparagus was very skinny so it was a little overdone.  I should have cooked the mushrooms for awhile then added the asparagus. I will make this again.

I used this cooking method for my asparagus last night. Omitted the rosemary since it wouldn't compliment the rest of the meal, and sauteed the shrooms for a sauce instead. I foil-lined my pan, drizzled olive oil on it, then used my hands to coat the asparagus with oil (the olive oil is good for your hands too!). I'll definitely add the shrooms to this next time. Thanks for the good cooking method!

This is great! I would have preferred everything a little more toasty, though, so I think next time I might stick everything in the broiler for the last minute or so.  I cooked this for exactly 15 minutes--I've never cooked asparagus before so I didn't want to risk overcooking it. AMENDMENT: Wow, these make for awesome leftovers, cold or hot!  And the flavor soaks in better, too!!

I, like someone else suggested used 2 tsbp of olive oil, and omitted the salt.  I also did a mix of rosemary and basil and roasted them at 500 degrees for 10 min and it was perfect.

Asparagus was good, so were mushrooms, way too much rosemary for my taste though.  Will probably try again with perhaps 1/4 the amount of rosemary and see how that works.

We were invited to a dinner party, where I was supposed to bring a vegetable.  I had everything timed out perfectly so that we would arrive with a hot dish until the host called and asked if we could come 30 minutes earlier.  I ended up throwing this recipe together quickly and it was a huge hit.  I get asked to make this regularly now!  So quick, so easy and so tasty!

I've been making this every year at thanksgiving, it's easy and delicious. The only thing to be careful of is adding too much salt/spice, because the mushrooms seem to accumulate them in their little crevices. Next time I do this, I think I'll toss the asparagus first and do another light toss with the mushrooms.

This was easy and delicious.  Followed the advice of other reviewers and roasted it at 400 for 15 minutes. Chopped the asparagus into bite size pieces.  Should have made more because it was so good!

This was delicious!!! The only changes I made were using dried rosemary instead of fresh, because that's what I had, and using ground garlic pepper instead of plain. I don't think the rosemary gave it any extra flavor, but maybe it being fresh would. Regardless, I loved it. I will be making this again. Thanks!

It looked , smelled and tasted great!
Will make it again...and again!
I used a zip-lock bag big enough to hold the asparagus and the mushrooms with the olive oil. (That saved using a big bowl to mix)
So easy, so tasty!
Fresh ground pepper and sea salt was all it needed to be delicious!??

I didn’t have Rosemary on hand so, I just used minced garlic from a jar and it came out to be delicious. I loved it, but my husband wasn’t too fond of how our apt smelled after. I thought it smelled fine lol!

I made this to accompany a cedar planked salmon recipe. The rosemary was a great compliment to the cedar smoke taste.  The only change I made was to add sliced almonds - definitely will make again.

This dish turned out really good. Cooking time was not long enough. It took 25 minutes to get the asparagus to my liking. I used thin asparagus. I used dried rosemary and it was great. At the end I added about at tablespoon of balsamic vinegar and sprinkled lemon pepper only because I love it. My husband loved the dish and it was really good to me as well. I gave only 4 stars because the cooking time was off a lot . Flavor was excellent.

Simple and quick with a nice flavor. You might want to buy thicker asparagus spears so they don’t overcook.

I omitted the rosemary because I didn't have fresh on hand. Will use this cooking method again. Easier than sautéing and ends up less greasy.

I think this is one of the best things I have had in a long time.  The mushrooms were so moist, flavorful and intense, so rich.  I think the rosemary would go equally well if one were to roast just the mushrooms.

LOVED this! I used smoked sea salt instead of regular salt.  I used a Balsamic/honey thyme vinaigrette instead of just olive oil. Very light & tasty! I simply put all the veggies in a produce bag, tossed with the vinaigrette. Placed the veggies on a parchment lined baking sheet, sprinkled over the rosemary, smoked sea salt & pepper. Roasted for the time suggested! Thanks for a simple &  tasty recipe!

Perfect side dish. The only change I made was that I didn't measure the olive oil, just added some, tossed, added some more, tossed again, untill everything had a light coating. This was a perfect accompaniment to a rib eye steak. Don't skip the rosemary! It's just right.

The family loved it. I wasn't sure how much rosemary because sprigs can be different sizes ( I went easy on it). I used a little over a tablespoon of finely minced rosemary for 2 pounds of asparagus and 3/4 of a pound of mushrooms. Thats almost double the vegetables-- I was a little short on the mushrooms. Some people in our family don't like herbs very well so I wasn't sure how this would be received, but everyone liked it;  I will make it again. We love sautéed mushrooms with wine, butter, garlic, and olive oil. Since we are trying to eat  healthier, I thought I would give this a try. Three out of four liked these mushrooms as well as we like sautéed. The asparagus was done to perfection without being tough or mushy.

This is now my favorite way to cook asparagus.  I did not have rosemary so I used an Italian blend which included rosemary.  The asparagus was cooked perfectly.

Cut the rosemary in half. I love it, but it overwhelms the rest of the flavor and ingredients.  Cook 12-14 for thinner stalks of asparagus.

Like one of the posters said, you have to bake less time if the stalks are skinny.  I added garlic to mine instead of rosemary.  I think a little parmesan cheese sprinkled on top would be a great touch too.  I'll make this one again!

I don't usually like asparagus but I love mushrooms. Two opposites, for me, brought together made this recipe one of my favorite vegetable dishes. I didn't have rosemary, so I tried garlic powder instead, along with salt and pepper and of course the olive oil. Thank you so much for sharing this! It changed my view on asparagus forever.

This was amazing. I'm new to cooking and this recipe was easy to follow and loved by my partner and I. Thanks so much for it!  I added garlic because I'm a garlic lover and would suggest the same to those who like that flavor. Used fresh rosemary like it called for. So happy with the results

No hollandaise needed.  This recipe is terrific!  I roasted for only 10 minutes, and used cremini mushrooms.  The rosemary is a wonderful compliment to the asparagus.

I changed it up a little bit.  I used dried rosemary, himalayan pink sea salt, fresh ground tellicherry pepper, and avocado oil.  I found that the olive oil smoked too much and the avocado oil is made for high heat.  It came out delicious!  My family wants this on the menu weekly.

Tasty and easy to make.  I did decrease the amount of Rosemary, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.

I have cooked this before, even before I ever saw this recipe. Asparagus and fresh mushrooms are 2 of my favorite foods, along with cauliflower. This is so good. To SANDYPRO.....I think it is common sense that the mushrooms will be done when the asparagus is done. She DID say to put both on the pan. Very self explanatory.

Great starter recipe -  just be aware of the size of asparagus that you are using. I had pencil size (just slightly larger) and I did for 10 minutes - it was really nice and crunchy and it allowed the mushrooms to cook as well. 

I happened to have thyme and garlic so used those as well as the others. (Yes, I know it alters the recipe a wee bit, but its what I had) I will make this again! :)

Great recipe for a healthy additive to a busy work week dinner. I have made this over and over and every time I get rave reviews by my family. I will substitute different seasonings for the rosemary if I don't think it will go with what I am fixing. This is a tender recipe and it goes well with almost any meal you serve up and one last thing, I have substituted brussels sprouts for asparagus too, not too bad, we are big sprout eaters so it was worth a shot and it paid off.

This was so easy to prepare. I was amazed at the tenderness of the vegetables, and loved the roasted flair -- reminded me of asparagus carefully made over the grill. Used white mushrooms (as they were cheaper), and store-bought fresh asparagus. Looking forward to when the Farmer's Market opens as I will try it with fresh asparagus. Complements well as a side dish to many a main course.

My friend made this for our special dinner party last night and it was gorgeous. She used sliced medium sized portobellos and there was nothing left. She did make a lemon, onion vinaigrette to pour over which made it extra special. Even without the vinaigrette, this is a great recipe.

I had picked out this recipe as a side dish one evening. Just as I was getting ready to start dinner My girl friend called with a problem with her car. She came buy with her daughter. I told them dinner would be late unless they wanted to cook it in MY kitchen. The Daughter followed the instructions on this dish and the others for the evening and everything turned out perfect. With a little help from her mom Thanks,

For sure add the rosemary!!! I added about 1/2 tsp dried. I chopped it pretty fine before adding it.  The flavors really go great together.  My hubby said that this was his favorite was to eat asparagus and mushrooms and to make it this was for now on. You could do so much with this as far as what veggies to add or what spices to try...thanks Leo67

This was great. Didn't use the mushrooms but didn't miss them. I was a little too generous with the olive oil and had a few drips start to smoke in my oven...if you are like me--just use a casserole dish or aluminum foil turned up at the sides. Yummy! Nice herby addition.

The only thing I added was some minced garlic and a touch of salt. I used fresh rosemary but didn't use the full amount called for. These were very good.

Next time I will definitely use fresh rosemary as called for--I used dried and it got too crunchy.  My fiance and his brother were eating it, but scraping off the rosemary first insisting it was like eating pine needles!  Melodramatic...

Yum! Asparagus definitely shrink up, especially if you're using the really thin ones. Good combination w/the rosemary(I used fresh).

We loved the asparagus & mushrooms.I added onion in just for something extra.I left out the rosemary b/c our tenderloin was cooked with rosemary and I wanted the vegetables to stand out.  Great!  A great quick & easy recipe! Thanks!

I really liked the roasted mushrooms but I wasn't a big fan of the rosemary and asparagus. Thanks for the idea though - I'll definitely try it out with another herb.

I love roasted asparagus with garlic.  I chop some up and roast with it.  If you don't want it to be crunchy, add it the last seven minutes.

I actually left out the rosemary and only used salt and pepper. It was great! I even roasted them for entirely too long one time and it was still good. Great to use for a party...very easy and so good!

I left out the rosemary just because I am not a fan of it.  Was still very good.

The rosemary really adds a nice flavor. My boyfriend loved it... he had no clue it was diet food!

This was so delicious and easy to prepare. The rosemary added a wonderful flavor that gave the dish a slightly spicy aftertaste. I used baby bellas and shiitakes--delish! This was surprisingly filling (I doubled the recipe and made it as a main dish).

This was delicious...I made this the other night, along with lemon dill salmon and boiled red potatoes.
