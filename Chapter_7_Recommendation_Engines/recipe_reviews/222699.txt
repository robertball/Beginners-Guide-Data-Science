Delicious and super easy--my favorite kind of dish! I used unsweetened coconut; otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly. This has become my go-to recipe for when I'm in a hurry--I just keep a container of the chopped pecans and coconut on hand and throw it together with a simple salad for a delicious, gourmet-tasting meal.

Very easy and very tasty...much like prepared pecan-encrusted tilapia we had enjoyed earlier. We had some trouble getting the coconut to brown but will run it under the broiler for a minute or two if that happens again. We also used unsweetened coconut.

Great ingredients that, in my case, they didn't come together to stand out.  It was really just ok.

Very tasty and easy to make.  I made mine with fresh caught North Carolina Puppy Drum,  The whole family loved it and agrees that this was the best fish theyâ€™ve ever had.  I had fun catching the fish and looking up this recipe on AR shopping and for the ingredients and fixing the dish.  Yum!

Honestly, I wasn't expecting much when I made this recipe but it turned out very well!  I only had plain greek yoghurt so I added a squirt of honey and mixed it. Also, I used crushed  almonds instead of pecans (because that's what I had) and unsweetened coconut. 
It won my husbands very discerning tastebuds!  Definitely going to make again!

I actually really liked it. I was definitely skeptical at first, but I'm glad I tried it. I used unsweetened coconut and lemon instead of lime. Also, I added some red pepper flakes at the end for a little kick, which was good. The fish could definitely use some salting before you add the yogurt and such. And I made my own honey yogurt out of raw honey and low fat Greek yogurt. There isn't any breading, which I like too. Great, great recipe. My kids also loved it. Will definitely make again and again.

I've been making this dinner for my family once a week! It is one of our new favorite dishes. I don't substitute anything, just use the recipe as is and it is deliciously amazing! So happy I found this delightful dish and thank you to the creater for sharing!

I love coconut, yogurt, and pecans but the flavor of the fish was a little bland once you got through the good stuff. Maybe something simple like a little sea salt would do the trick, other wise though it was a great dish.
