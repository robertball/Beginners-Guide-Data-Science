This was a wonderful, wonderful cake.  I made it for co-worker's party, and not only was the whole thing eaten, but every single person there asked for the recipe, and even talked about it days later.  A number of the other reviewers mentioned that the mousse/whipped cream concoction was too runny.  That was really my only complaint about this recipe; the mousse was difficult to work with, especially when it came to frosting the outside of the cake.  However, after some experimentation, I found that instant pudding mix, added (dry) to the whipped cream/white chocolate works exceptionally well.  Not only does it stabilize the mousse, but it also adds flavor.  I recommend trying either the vanilla pudding mix or the white chocolate.  Also, to add an extra boost of flavor to the raspberry, try adding a few drops of orange extract.  It enhances the berry flavor quite well.  I also recommend adding sugar to taste.  I agree that the raspberry puree can be rather tart.  However, don't sweeten too much; a hint of tartness offsets the sweetness of the cake and the mousse.  Hope that helps!

I haven't tried this recipe but i used it as a reference to make my white chocolate mousse and it turned out great. First melt chocolate with some heat cream and whisk till smooth.  
   
     let cool down. if you don't it will melt the whipped cream which some who rated this recipe obviously did.  whip the cream till soft peaks form and add a stabilizer and sugar to sweeten.  whipped cream stabilizers are sold in specialty stores or online.  piping gel also stabilizes cream to a nice thick consistency.  next mix 1/4 of whipped cream into chocolate that has been cooled.  next fold in another 1/4 of cream. do slowly so as keep airy and thick.  you'll love these tips if used correctly!!!!!!!!!!!

Tastes DELICIOUS!! I would double the raspberry filling, as I did rasp. on the bottom, then mousse, then raspberry.  I also thickened up the raspberries with a little more cornstarch, so it was like a thick jam. The mousse was a little sloppy though, I think maybe if you refrigerate before you ice the rest of the cake it would go on a little smoother, esp. on the sides.  Will definitely make this again.

This is a little time consuming, but worth the effort, it turns out very light and delicious. I followed the advise of the reviewer who used instant pudding to thicken the mousse. I just whipped my cream until it was thick and sprinkled in about 2 TBS of vanilla instant pudding and it thickened immediately, so I didn't add anymore, then mixed in the white chocolate, it turned out very good, easy to frost, not runny at all. I didn't have raspberries so I used strawberries and it was very good.

I made this cake yesterday & put it in the freezer.  We're having a big, family BBQ in a few days & I wanted something I could make ahead of time.  I read other reviews & took the advice to add instant vanilla pudding to the whip cream.  I used a 4-serving pkg - make sure it's 'instant' pudding!  It firmed up the whip cream SO nicely.  I melted the white chocolate with 1/2 cup whip cream - not 1 c. as orginally written & I whipped the remaining 1-1/2 cups with the pudding).  I cooled the white choc. completely (over a bowl of ice water & gradually folded the whip cream in.  It was a perfect consistency for icing the layers & piping the remaining around the base of the cake & the top.  Also, when I made the raspberry filling - I didn't bother pureeing the rasberries first.  When you heat the berries, add sugar (2Tbsp) & the cornstarch/water - the berries break down & puree themselves.  This saves time.  All in all I found this to be an excellent recipe.  You can't go wrong with a cake mix, and the white choc. mousse tasted delicious.  The raspberry filling was of a jam consistency - I put it between layer 2 and 3 (mousse between 1 & 2 and 3 & 4).  The results looked very professional!  Can't wait to taste the final product.  P.S.  I won't add the fresh rasberries that decorate the top of the cake until I take it out of the freezer and the cake has thawed.  I encourage you to try this recipe.  Make the few changes that have been suggested by others - you won't be disappointed!

I've made this cake twice, and I found it relatively easy to make since I'm just a beginner baker. It tastes great too but I don't think that much cream is necessary because I always tend to have globs of it left over. I also strain the raspberries a little after pureeing since I prefer not having the seedy texture.

The flavors complemented each other very well, but insted of the "mousse" I simply made a white chocolate ganache to frost with.  I also drizzled each layer with a lemon syrup I made from lemon juice and confectioner's sugar.  I'll definitely use this one again!

Honestly, the idea for the cake is good, the recipe is NOT! You have to change and adjust so much, if you don't believe me, check what everyone else had to do. The recipe should be re-written with the correct amounts of cream, instant pudding, and directions.

I agree with the reviewer that wrote the recipe is a good idea, but needs to be re-written.  I added a box of instant pudding mix as so many have suggested but it was still runny.  It looked lovely until I cut a piece out, then the whole thing collapsed on the runny mousse.  It tasted wonderful though!

I made this for Easter dinner and it was a huge hit.  It was fairly easy, and very impressive looking.  Th combined flavours really complimented each other.  The only problem I had was that the White Chocolate Mousse was to soft to pipe, so I would suggest melting the chocolate with only 1/2 cup of the cream instead of a whole cup.  This is a real keeper for my family

This one received rave reviews from my family and coworkers!  I baked the cake according to the directions on the box, but subbed butter and milk for the oil and water (I always do this with boxed mixes, as it gives them a much richer and more homemade taste).  Instead of the mousse, I made a white chocolate buttercream frosting, by mixing 1 cup butter with approximately 2 cups of powdered sugar, then adding 8 ounces of melted white chocolate and beating on high for 3-4 minutes until light and fluffy.  A great springtime treat!

Made this cake for my sister's 60 th birthday party. It was a HUGE hit. I chilled the white chocolate and whipping cream mixture before adding to the whipped cream. I also added a box of white chocolate instant pudding mix to the cream. It gave the mousse a thicker texture, which was perfect for frosting and decorating the cake. Thankyou for sharing this recipe. Definately a keeper !

Great recipe! I followed the others suggestions adding vanilla pudding mix to the whipped cream and adding 1/2 cup cream (instead of a cup) to the chocolate. I also added 2 tbsp sugar to the raspberries to cut down the tartness, it was perfect. I used frozen raspberries as directed but had some fresh ones (for decorating) left over so I added them to the raspberry mixture while cooking it - they puréed on their own so I agree with the other reviewer who said blending them was unnecessary. As well I followed someone's advice and used more cornstarch to thicken it to a thin jam-like consistency. I filled the layer extra thick (see pic). The only other thing I did otherwise to tweak the recipe was make the cake more lemony. I didn't have any lemon extract or fresh lemons on hand and was limited to lemon juice; as such it took a substantial amount just to yield a minimal difference. I didn't measure the amount I used, just added to taste - it was a lot and the batter was resultantly runny so I had to add flour to correct it. In the end it turned out well though. This cake was such a big hit I'll definitely be making it again. Thanks for sharing!

Turned out ugly — I had trouble whipping the cream. Definitely my 
own fault with reading the recipe, etc. 

Tasted just fine — got rave reviews. Not the easiest cake to make, 
not a quick project.

I have made this cake a number of times. I always get GREAT reviews from everyone who tries it - even from my die-hard milk/dark chocolate lovers. The first time I tired it, as other reviewers noted, I ended up with white chocolate slop instead of mousse. The next few times, I  made sure to whip the cream to stiff peaks and not to overmix when I added the chocolate mixture and had much better results.

This was a decent recipe. Just to stress.... the recipe calls for the white choc mixture to be "luke warm".. no no... let it cool!!!!! I made the mistake of adding the whipped cream while it was too warm and it didn't fluff properly, just kinda melted it. Everyone still loved it though :)

Fabulous! The layers actually held up, even the mousse layers (I added a box of white chocolate instant pudding). When I finally arrived at the party the cake was gone and three guest actually bowed down, everybody else was begging for the recipe or telling me how wonderful the cake was! Thanks =)

Beware!  This recipe does not work as written.  Read the reviews and find that almost everyone had to change it to make it work.  I wasted a pound of chocolate and 6 cups of heavy cream.  the mousse is too runny.

This has been a huge hit every time I've made it. Instead of using the mousse, I used a regular white icing and covered it with shredded coconut. YUM!

I just made this cake and eventhough it didn't come out as good as the one i had tasted before it was pretty decent. i love knowing how to make my own frosting which i will know do on most of my cakes. next time i will let the white chocolate and the haevy cream sit a little longer to cool down as i found out when i added the whipped cream it was kind of watery but it still stuck after i put the cake in the refrigerator.

So, I usually find cake too sweet to have more than three bites, but this one was the perfect mixture of sweet and a little sour (from the raspberries/lemon). I made the lemon cake from scratch instead of from a box. The frosting/mousse (although it took me five tries to figure out what was wrong) was also the perfect amount of sweetness. With the help of my mom, we figured out to melt the white chocolate in the double broiler, then let it cool, whip egg whites on high speed until peaking, then whip about one cup of cream until stiff-like texture, then fold cream and egg whites together, then fold in chocolate. I sprinkled the cake with confectioner's sugar for a final touch. I made it for my boyfriend for our anniversary but I know everyone in his family enjoyed it because it was gone the next day! It was time consuming first time around, but definitely worth it!

This was sooo good!! I did have a little difficulty with the icing, but read another reviewer who added pudding mix to the icing.  I did that and it firmed up wonderfully! I was able to pipe the icing out and it made a beautiful cake!

This is a good cake, but the mousse/frosting needs improvement.  Next time, I will try the white chocolate pudding mix.

The mousse was not runny at all. I only added about 1/3 c of cream to the white chocolate when I melted it (in the microwave instead of stove). The consistency was perfect. The raspberry filling made plenty, so I did 2 layers of raspberry and the middle layer and frosting of the mousse. Overall, pretty good, pretty easy.

I really wish I had read the reviews on this cake before making it.  I followed the directions up until combining the cream & chocolate.  I (admit it!) messed up and put the cream in before mixing it, and tried to compensate by adding powdered sugar.  Needless to say, it ended up as a big, gloppy mess.  Now that I've thrown out the entire batch, my naked cake waiting for its frosting, I'm off to Cub Foods to buy some whip cream.  I'm just going to use regular pre-whipped cream and the raspberry mix.  I'm also going to add a little sugar to the raspberries, as one reviewer suggested.

Maybe I shouldn't rate this because I just used the mousse recipe to make a trifle with a raspberry cake. I used another raspberry sauce recipe from this site that was excellent and easy. The mousse was runny, so since I had bought a quart of heavy cream, I just whipped up the last cup and added that. After refrigeration, it was just the perfect consistency for a trifle.

Excellent Receipe. I did not add pudding mix as others suggested and my mousse frosting came out perfect.    Here's a tip:  Beat your cream in a VERY COLD metal bowl with ice cold beaters. (I freeze my bowl and beaters ahead of time). I also put the metal bowl inside a larger metal bowl filled with ice cubes, this makes your bowl and cream very cold. Beat it until it gets still peaks.   I have to admit that I did not have white chocolate so I used a half of a bag of semi sweet chocolate chips instead.  Also, I put the melted chocolate mixture into a large bowl (let it cool a bit) and folded the whipped cream into the chocolate with a wooded spoon, and with the wooded spoon very lightly mixing till it all blended.

Great recipe! Because there's so much filling, I actually did 2 layers of raspberry w/the icing in the middle layer. After reading many comments on how runny and difficult to work with the chocolate mousse is, I decided to ice the cake with a white chocolate frosting: melt 8 oz white chocolate with 1/4 c whipped cream and let cool. Beat in 1 c. butter, 1 1/4 c icing sugar. Turned out great! No mess, no fuss!

I brought this to work and got rave reviews!  I made a few changes.  I used white cake instead of lemon.  I also added about 2 Tbsp of sugar to the raspberries, and added a box of vanilla pudding to the mousse.  At first, the mousse turned out very runny and gritty, but I just used my hand mixer on high and mixed it until it became fluffy again.  I will definitely make again!

I have to say this is a bust. The white chocolate mousse is runny and won't frost the cake. I sit here with it half stuck to the sides of my cake and it looks awful. It's for my grandmothers 90th birthday and I don't know what to do. I did also try to add some vanilla instant pudding as someone recommended and it just became more "yellowed" and gross. I will never make this again. It's a good idea but in reality it is like putting yellowed soup on your cake.

This cake was fun to make but messy because the fillings of chocolate mousse and rasberry were not consistent enough. It made it hard to spread the icing on top. I had to ad suger to the rasberry and chocolate mousse, but other than that it was a success! I added a personnal touch for a birthday celebration ( as seen on the picture) and everyone loved it. I also added food coloring to the cake mix to make it fun.

The combination of lemon and raspberry is wonderful, even my boyfriend who doesn't favor either said it tasted great.  I did have a problem with the raspberry sauce.. it tasted okay, but smelled awful which made me a bit nervous so I ended up using regular raspberry preserves and it turned out great.

This was a really good recipe but I did make a couple of changes. I added two packets of lemon pudding mix to the cake, and to the filling, I did something easier than the recipe. I used a pint of cream, added a box of white chocolate pudding mix and frozen raspberries that I pureed to make small. It was divine! And so easy!

This wasn't awful or anything, but I wasn't really crazy about it. I did as another poster suggested and only used 1/2 c. cream to melt the chocolate.  Everything tasted just fine, but I didn't care for the texture of the mousse after it sat for awhile.  Probably won't make again.

Comments:
the chocolate mousse: I took the advice of others and only put 1/2 cup of cream in with the chocolate. There is way too much cream in this recipe. Mine turned gritty the instant I began folding the stuff together. The consistency was not that of mousse either. Also, while sitting in the fridge waiting for the cake to be ready, it totally separated, and I was left with a cup of cream in the bottom of the bowl. next time I would use a lot less cream.
The raspberry was fine, watch out though. It doesn't seem to thicken so you think you need more starch. But it does thicken quite a bit after. I think it needs sugar in the berries.

After tweeking this recipe the cake turned out wonderfully.  I took the reviewer's advice and melted the chocolate with only 1/2 cup of cream as well, I added gelatin to the raspberry filling in order to make it firmer.  It was a great hit for my daughter's first birthday. I will make this again.

As inspiration to make a fantastic cake, five stars. But I did make some changes, so notching it down to four.
I made a white chocolate buttercream icing instead of the whipped cream frosting, but that was just personal choice.
In terms of helpful suggestions, I would say that the raspberry puree is too good (and too expensive to make) to use it on just one layer. I followed the layering instructions -- first, buttercream, then raspberry, then buttercream again -- and realized that I still had half the puree left. I would suggest using the raspberry on two of the three layers instead. That is, first raspberry, middle buttercream, then raspberry again. Otherwise, what's the point of going to all that trouble?
Anyway, everyone loved this cake. I will make it again for sure.

I followed the suggestions made by fellow reviewer, STARKRAZI, and the results were very good. I added 2tbs of sugar to the raspberry puree since it was just too tart.  The overall effect was really good, since the raspberry puree had enough tartness to offset the white chocolate mousse.  I'd definately use this recipe for as a cake filling again.  I received many compliments.

I have not made the cake portion of this recipe but I have used the raspberry white chocolate mousse as a filling for a chocolate cake.  This is absolutely amazing.  I did some substitutions based on other reviewers.  I added 1 tsp. orange extract and a Tbls. or 2 of sugar to the raspberry puree to sweeten and I also added a box of vanilla pudding mix to the mousse as a stabilizer.  I added the raspberry mixture to the white chocolate mousse and used it for a chocolate cake filling.  It was amazing.  I received tons of compliments and the cake literally disappeared.  I have also substituted a lemon filling with the white chocolate mousse as a lemon cake filling and it is incredible.  The lemon filling is from a lemon cake recipe on this site as well.  I get requests for the lemom cake with the lemon filling all the time.  Thank you so much for this recipe.  It has been a great help in my cake making business.

Absolutely wonderful flavor. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I do agree that there is too much cream in the recipe and it is a time consumer. I did have fun making it though and it really would turn out pretty if the mousse wasn't quite so thin. Still, I refrigerated the mousse and then applied to the cake and it was still quite nice with the garnised raspberries. Made it for my sister's b-day and she and her kids raved over it. ( She is a fellow all-reciper)

Way too much cream in the melting of the chocolate. Reduce to 1/4 cup next time I make this. 
Also, the raspberries for the filling are very tart without some type of sweetener.

This cake was absolutely delicious. It's very easy to make with clear recipe instructions. I baked two nine inch cakes, cut in half and layered. The lemon cake was moist as the package promised. When I made the raspberry filling I thought it might be too tart, but in conjunction with the chocolate mousse it was perfect. I must say I find most cakes too sweet. I stacked the layers into a 10 inch spring form and poured the mousse over the cake then froze it. I agree with another commenter that the mousse turned out too wet so will add some pudding powder to thicken it. But the taste was perfect. I finished the cake with a mirror glaze, which absolutely complemented it. What a winner to take to a BBQ!!

This cake was definitely yummy! I did add some sugar to the raspberries to make them a little sweeter. Also, I think the amount of cream is too much. I believe that I should have refrigerated it longer before I frosted the cake because it slid off the cake a lot when I was icing the sides. Really awesome recipe though!

I read the reviews and thought this would be a good idea to make for a baby shower.  Boy was I wrong!!!  This mousse is very runny!  Don't know how to get it thicker.  I did add more raspberries to top so people don't look at the runniness.  Hopefully it will taste better than it looks!
