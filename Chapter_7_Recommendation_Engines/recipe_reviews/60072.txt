Tasty and very spring like. Didn't have the daisies so I didn't include. Would be pretty for a ladies luncheon.

Nice fresh, bright salad. The dressing was nice, but, honestly, I liked it better before the sour cream. It was beautiful and just crisp and light.  I didn't think the sour cream added much to it.  I used a very high quality olive oil for this, and I think that is a key.  Daisies, around here, get gobbled up before they leave the yard, so the lil yellow and white ones were out..but, I still added some live, big, colored blossoms for the character.  I also used cherry tomatoes, out of preference.

Great recipe!  I didn't have everything so I substituted:
white wine vinegar for red wine vinegar
shallots for onion
roma tomatoes for tomatoes on the vine
no Daisy blossoms

Turned out really good, and all my guests loved it.

This salad is a great change from the usual. The dressing is wonderful, loved the shallots. I didn't have any daisies but it was beautiful without them. i'll be making this a lot this summer.

This was a pretty tasty salad. Something different than our norm Ranch & crouton salads
