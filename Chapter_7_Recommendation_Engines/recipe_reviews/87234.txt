I made 1/4 pounders and used normal size English muffins.  Very good, but could have been better.  I was too conservative with the Dijon mustard, only used 4 drops of hot sauce per burger, and didnâ€™t have enough canned chile peppers.  Next time I will about double the hot sauce and follow the recipe exactly for the other ingredients, and then these will be 5 star burgers!

I used a mexican style hot sauce, added garlic powder and fried some onions. For the topping I used red chipolte peppers.  The extras' in my opinion are needed.
