For me, this wavered between 3 1/2-4 stars. I used brown rice in this recipe and did not have chicken bouillion granules so what I did was used homemade chicken broth and increased the liquid to almost a full cup. I use petite diced tomatoes and took another reviewer's suggestion and added a half teaspoon each of cumin, mexican oregano and chili powder as well as a good amount fresh minced garlic. Not bad--it definetly needed additional spice. I was surprized that it worked well with the brown rice but in a good way. I would make this again BUT I would play with the recipe a bit next time.

Good rice, was a little crunchy even after adding and extra 1/4 cup of water.  Did not use a jalapeno because I can't handle that much spice.  Otherwise was pretty good.

I was torn on how to rate this recipe.  Personally, I didn't care for this recipe.  I thought it had some "heat" from the jalapeno, but, I didn't think it had much flavor.  I think it needed some spices added like cumin or chili powder.  I did use rotel instead of just peeled tomatoes and I do think that helped.   My husband thought it was pretty good though and tasted more like rice you would get in a Mexican restaurant.  The problem I did have though was that the liquid was absorbed into the rice in the 20 minute cooking time, but, even after sitting the additional 5 minutes the rice still had a slight crunch to it.  I don't plan on making this again.

I did not have a jalapeno pepper so had to omit that.  However, instead of can of tomatoes, I used one can of Rotel tomatoes with peppers.  Unfortunately, I did not have cilantro which would make this very delicious.  Problem I see with this recipe, and why I give it 3 stars instead of 5, is that there is not enough liquid.  For 2 cups rice, you need at least 4 cups liquid.  All rice I have ever made you need 1 part rice to 2 parts liquid.

I loved this recipe! For my taste I would use less cilantro but this is by far the best Mexican rice recipe I have tried.

This dish got rave reviews from my family and we eat Mexican food at least 2-3x /week. It had a lot of flavor. My jalapeño was pretty spicy so it lent itself quite well to the dish. My family wants it as hot as possible ! But now there are toddlers eating the same food and they loved it! I did not roast the jalapeño just chopped up fine and it cooked down. I like my rice more dry than wet. This was moist but next day was just the way I like it!!
