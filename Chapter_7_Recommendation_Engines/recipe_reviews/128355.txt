This was great! I added used brown sugar instead of regular sugar, and added about 1 1/2 tsp. red pepper flakes and 2 cloves of garlic to the sauce, which I heated over low heat until the peanut butter melted. Instead of broccoli, I added shredded cabbage, shredded carrots and green onion. I also used extra chunky peanut butter, which added a nice crunch. I used pork instead of shrimp, as I already had some ready for use. Thanks so much for the post! I'll be making ths one often.

Good & easy. Sub'd balsamic vinegar for black and penne pasta for udon.  Doubled shrimp, sauce and tripled broccoli.  Using crunchy PB removes need for chopped pnuts.  Nuked sauce for a minute so ingredients would blend.  Not real happy with how the shrimp tasted.  Not over done but not real flavorful.  Doing again I would sub half sesame oil with half hot sesame oil for zip.  And I would cut back a little on the pb.  I will make this again.  Used reg. soy sauce and not salty at all. Thanks.

I really wanted this to be good, and it was! My family loves broccoli, shrimp and noodles, plus it is a one pot meal. So, I had to give it a try. Everybody loved it! I did substitute whole wheat fettucini for the whole grain aspect. The sauce is very good. The only addition I made was one teaspoon of chile garlic sauce to add some spice. I have tried many peanut sauce recipes, because I love it. This was by far the easiest and quite good. This dish was fast, easy and healthy. Definitly a keeper!

This dish was pretty good.  Next time I'll make much more sauce.  I made some modifications - added water and milk, chili powder, ginger, soy sauce, vinegar, sugar, and pb together in a small sauce pan and warmed it on low until it was a nice, creamy consistency. Poured over shrimp, pea pods, broccoli and noodles.

Your college staple has become mine ;)  It's still okay using other types of oil eg olive, but sesame is the best.  My boyfriend loves it too (but I've been more careful with my shrimps after he got freaked out finding one with legs on it, but I think it just goes to show how good it was that he kept eating it after!)

Very good!  I took a few liberties, not the least of which was using thin spaghetti (we've got a ton of that and no Japanese udon noodles in sight), using 1/2 balsamic vinegar and half cider vinegar to sub for the Chinese black vinegar, and doubling the sauce.  I had already cooked shrimped, so I chose to cook the spaghetti and broccoli together, then add to a wok that had oil, peanuts, and garlic in it.  Then I added the sauce and shrimp until everything was warmed through.  I added garlic and onion powder plus a sprinkle of dried red pepper to the sauce.  Very nice little recipe, and easy.  I'd be willing to buy the Chinese black vinegar and udon noodles to try this and make it (a little!) more authentic.  Thanks for the recipe!

Very good.  I cut the peanut butter in half and added ginger for a little zip.  Needs to have more sauce for the noodles.

Awesome.  Made a bunch of alterations to it, like doubling the recipe and using 1/2 rice vinegar, 1/2 balsamic, adding a tbs of ground ginger, 2 tbs brown sugar, 2 tbs honey, some squirts of sriracha and a box of whole wheat spaghetti.  Also made up the sauce in a pan and boiled the shrimp first in its own pot, then took them out, boiled the broccoli in the same water, removed them and finally boiled the pasta too.  Mixed everything together as soon as i drained the pasta, and it turned out fantastic!

Amazingly easy, quick, and delicious. I have peanut allergies so I actually made this with tahini and doubled the sauce. So good.

This is a great dish.  Made some changes just due to necessity - I couldn't fine udon noodles or black vinegar in my grocery store.  I used angel hair pasta and red chinese vinegar, and it turned out just great.  A big hit in my house!

My boyfriend was very skeptical about this recipe because of the name, but I promised him we could go to Taco Bell or something if he didn't like it.  We both liked it, though!  I had to use rice vinegar and whole wheat spaghetti noodles (half a pound), but didn't change anything else.  This was quite tasty and I ALWAYS have the ingredients on hand (I buy precooked, shelled, frozen baby shrimp), plus it was fast, so I'll surely make it again.  We had it with steamed edamame (soybeans).  Thanks for the good recipe!

So delicious! My modifications: normal soy sauce, balsamic vinegar instead of Chinese black vinegar, brown instead of white sugar, peanut instead of sesame oil (although will try with sesame next time), angel hair pasta (I am not a fan of thick noodles), doubled the broccoli. Was SO good. I also made one batch of the sauce (over low heat in saucepan, makes it easier to coat all pasta) and then halved the sauce ingredients to add more, the amount shown here was not enough due to the size of pasta I used. Can't wait to make this again!

I had to substitute some ingredients. Balsamic vinegar for the Chinese black vinegar, vegetable oil for the sesame oil, plain ramen noodles for the udon noodles, skipped the roasted peanuts as I'd used crunchy peanut butter, brown sugar for the regular sugar and frozen Asian-style stir-fry veggies. Makes a ton, would cut the recipe in half next time. Not bad, good for a take-out fix.

I subbed Soba noodles for Udon and they were terrific. I went to several stores looking for black vinegar with no luck. The closest I came was Japanese plum (ume) vinegar which I used and it came out very good, but it added some salt which the dish probably didn't need. I also used honey instead of white sugar. Great recipe. I love how it cuts down on dishes.

I thought this was a little bland (and that was after adding some red pepper flakes as suggested by others).  I had to use spaghetti noodles - 1/2 a box- because that was all I had. I thought that the noodles kind of took over.  Next time I would add more broccoli and shrimp, and possibly a few other vegetables.  I think I'd also try and add a little more spice and make a little more sauce.

This was so easy and quick, and the sauce is fabulous! I have tried several other variations on home-made peanut sauce, but this was the best.   I only had rice sticks on hand, not udon noodles, so I cooked them separate from everything else because they cook so quickly. Since I was tossing everything else into my wok (you can use any large pan), I added a little oil, cooked the shrimp, removed them, then sauteed onion, mushrooms, and the broccoli. I added 2 cloves of garlic. I kept the sauce was exactly as the recipe, except I used 1/2 chili oil and 1/2 sesame oil, but didnt use a whole tablespoon because I had added oil to the sautee pan. A tip for people who have a lot of soy sauce packets left over from take-out nights: one packet = approx 1 tablespoon.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

I made the mistake of reading the reviews and doubling the sauce.  BIG MISTAKE!  It turned into a pastey mess.  I did sub the Chinese black vinegar with balsalmic vinegar, but I can't imagine that causing the problem.  Next time I will try this according to the recipe and see how it turns out.

Really good recipe. I just made the peanut butter sauce and poured it over plain noodles (because I dislike shrimp and broccoli) and most everyone in my family seemed to enjoy it. One of my sisters even begged me to make her just the sauce so she could use it as a salad dressing.

Well, I'm hooked.  Seriously, the taste was incredible for how ridiculously easy this was!  I added shredded carrots, green onions, and increased the broccoli and I'd love to try this with different veggie combinations; I think most would work.  I decreased the sugar by about 1/4 and it was plenty sweet enough for me due to the sugar in the peanut butter (crunchy).  I couldn't find Chinese black vinegar so I subbed half white and half red wine vinegar.  The sauce would have gotten 4 stars, but I'm sure this would be even better as written so 5 it gets :)  Next time (and there will definitely be a next time/many next times!) I would like to add something for zip, such as ginger or cayenne pepper.  Thanks a lot for this recipe!

Loved it very much, tasted exciting and exotic, but so easy to make right out of my kitchen w/o running to store. I would make more sauce next time and I omitted the shrimp for personal preference.

This recipe was super quick and the sauce is delicious! I substituted snow peas and mushrooms for the broccoli; and just mixed everything, boiled it for 5 min, drained it, and stirred in the sauce. Awesome.

This was amazing!  I used rice noodles because that is what I had.  I also didn't have black vinegar so used vinegar instead.  Increased sauce proportions by 50%. Added 3 medium cloves of garlic and some chili paste and it was AWESOME!

I used balsamic vinegar for the chinese black and brown sugar in place of the white.  I stir-fried my shrimp in a wok, removed and then stir-fried broccoli, red onion, sliced vertically and red bell pepper, sliced vertically.  I used soba noodles in place of the udon.  Added back the shrimp and noodles into the wok and then stirred in the sauce.  I used less noodles than the recipe called for because I was worried that I didn't have enough sauce to coat everything.  I did add red pepper flakes to the sauce as we like spicy food.   It was yummy and quick to fix.  This is a repeater for us.

Excellent quick, relatively healthy meal.  Takes me more than 15 minutes, but that's probably just me.    I made it according to the recipe the first time (substituting cider vinegar for the black vinegar, which I can't find), and it was quite good.  I have also used buckwheat soba noodles (more protein) and canned chicken (cheaper) with good results.  If you're using canned chicken, be sure to add it after draining the noodles and broccoli.

I didn't have black vinegar so I used red wine. I am giving this 4 stars because I didn't care for the taste, but my guests did

This was OK.  We thought there was too much peanut butter and none enough "kick".  Probably won't try this again.

This is excellent!  Be careful not to overcook the noodles.  The noodle packaging recommended 12-14 minutes, but I kept them in for only 11 and they were still a bit over-done.

This was pretty good.  Not my favorite Asian Peanut sauce but I'd make it again.  What I liked about it was I could prepare everything in the same pot.  I boiled my noodles, pulled them out, boiled the shrimp, pulled them out and then boiled frozen Asian vegetables all in the same water.  Needed a little soy sauce on top of the noodles.  Easy clean up and extremely fast and well balanced meal to prepare.

I cooked according to directions but my noodles came out a little too overcooked. Could be because I have a gas stove.  Family all said they would make it again so I will but will cook the noodles less and add more shrimp and broccoli.  
Flavor was good.

I did the recipe as called for with the exception of using brown sugar instead of white sugar.   Came out awesome. Does have a strong peanut butter taste so if you want to lessen the taste just don’t use as much PB (I used JIF smooth)

Yum! I made this using spaghetti noodles and steam-in-the-bag broccoli.  I cooked the broccoli separately and just added it to the noodles and shrimp before stirring in the sauce.  I took Shannon's suggestion of using 1 1/2 tsp red pepper flakes and 2 cloves of garlic.  I look forward to having the leftovers tomorrow.  This recipe might actually become a college staple for me, too!

This was great. We loved it and I especially love that it is almost a one pot meal, except for the sauce. I just think it was a little sweet. Next time I'll use only 1/2 Tbs of sugar. And I did feel the need to double or triple the amount of broccoli. But even with the extra broccoli, I thought the amount of sauce was perfect. 
I served it with pot stickers on the side.

Something is missing in the flavor - maybe a little fresh ginger.  I stir-fried vegetables in the sesame oil then added the cooked noodles and sauce.  I also used a hot peanut butter (The Heat is On from Peanut Butter Company) to add some spice, which worked well.  It just needs a little more kick of flavor.

The first time we had this dish it was really thick and kind of heavy. But the taste was really good. We thought the sauce was thick because when we cooked our noodles, we didn't use enough water and the noodles made our sauce thick.

Not a bad recipe. I think that the amount of sesame oil shoiuld be cut back to about 1/2 teaspoon and maybe a little something like a little honey to sweeten it up. The udon noodles were gag me though. I think that good old linguini would work much better.

Very tasty. The noodles were a bit overcooked and mushy, will definitely cook less next time. The sauce was quite delicious.
