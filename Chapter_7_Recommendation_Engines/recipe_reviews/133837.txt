Hello from Portugal, the traditional caldo Verde, is usually made with Kale leaf, very very finely sliced, here in Portugal we usually don't use cabbage, thats why we call it "caldo verde" which mean green soup, and you get the green colour from the Kale leafa, otherwise your receipe is perfect. On the side we like to serve it with a nice slice of Portuguese corn bread.

This is an excellent soup for the chilly days of autumn!  

Here's what I did a little differently from the original recipe.  I used Polish beef sausage instead of chorizo (to make it kosher). I added 1 carrot, chopped into small pieces, plus its carrot greens, finely diced, for color.  I used 4 tsp of salt instead of 2 tsp of salt because I like it more heavily seasoned.  I used plain paprika instead of smoked paprika only because I didn't have the smoked kind.  

Thanks for a great recipe!!

This soup is absolutely fantastic! It is hearty and filling and super good!! I had to use linguica instead of chorico because that was all I could find! I'll be making this often, thanks for a great recipe!

Very easy to make.  I stuck to the recipe.  Next time I plan to incorporate chicken broth into the required liqid.  I think It might provide more depth of flavor.  I also might try added carrtos as suggested in another review.  I substituted linguisa for the chourico as I could not locate that particular sausage.  I also need to add more salt.  Not quitre enough for my personal taste.  Loved it though.  Everyone ate it up.

Cabbage is not the standard for this soup at all. It seems a good recipe, but the best substitute (what can easily be found in american grocery stores) is collard greens. Cut out the stems, rolls the leaves up tightly, finely shred them with a knife and add to the bowls, not the pot. The potatoes should be mostly mashed, not pureed and pasty looking. And when my Avo (grandma) cant get chourico or linguica sausage, she uses mild italian sausage. Its a bit strong but still good.

WOW! I made this with authentic Chourico from  Furtados in Fall River, my childhood home. I took heed and followed the recipe, except to add salt to Kosher 3 Tsp. I added 1 Tsp of ground black pepper and 1 Tbsp of red pepper flakes. I used the boat motor; easy, and left it with some chunk. I used half green cabbage and half kale. This is awesome! Thanks!

I wasn't sure this was a keeper until I tried it the next day.  Wow, so much richer.  I did use smoked sausage and fried it first and then added some butter to the soup.  Five stars for simplicity!

What a nice surprise this soup was! I only used half the amount of sausage the recipe calls for (which is what I had, and it was plenty) and I added a can of white beans. I also finished off with a squeeze of lemon to the pot. Super easy, yummy, and affordable soup – can’t beat that.

Easy to make.

TIP!  Add a handful of fresh cut oregano when you add the spices and salt. I like to cook the soup slowly in the last 5 minutes or more to get the juice out of the oregano.

OPTIONAL! Add a little classica pevide midolline from Nacional

I love cabbage soup.  I was looking for a different recipe and tried this one.  This is excellent and easy to make.  I will be making it again.  I did not have Portuguese chourico sausage and used italian sausage.  Thanks for sharing!

I thought this was an excellent way to use cabbage in a soup. Even though I didn't have chorizo, the sausage I used was a good fit, and offered an additional layer of flavor. This one goes on the roster of dishes I will remember.

Even though I didn't have quite the right ingredients, it came out very tasty! Used regular paprika, smoked Polish sausage (slightly browned in a cast iron skillet), and added carrots with the potatoes. I used about 3 tsp salt. My submersible blender work wonderfully to puree the soup. I'll definitely make this again!
