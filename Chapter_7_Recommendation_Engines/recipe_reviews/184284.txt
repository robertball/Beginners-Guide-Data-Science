Followed the recipe exactly.  It was very good. Spicy and tangy Thai inspired dish.  I didn't care for the orange flavor.  Would probably omit the zest next time.  Other than that it makes a wonderful & unique cold salad.

This smelled wonderful until the peanut butter went it. It would of been better without the peanut butter, or even cut it back quite a bit. Once the PB was mixed into the sauce it turned into a strange smelling concoction that was not well received in the finished dish.

This was tasty but a couple of changes next time. The orange flavor is a bit overwhelmong in this. I ended up adding a shot of soy sauce and that toned it down some. Also, this is NOT a dish that can be made in advance and served the next day. The cucumber will shed its water overnight and make the dish very watery and flavorless. I drained off the liquid, made up a bit more of the sauce and it was fine.. just next time I won't add the cucumbers until i am ready to eat each portion
