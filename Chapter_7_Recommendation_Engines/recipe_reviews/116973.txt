This was really good and simple.  I think the only thing I might change for next time is a little bit more cream cheese and maybe a little bit of vanilla in the cream cheese/whipped cream mix.  Oh also maybe a shortbread crust.

Delicious, great way to showcase blueberries.  I adjusted the recipe a bit - for the cream cheese portion I doubled the cream cheese to 8oz instead of 4oz, added a teaspoon of vanilla extract and used a 16oz tub of Cool Whip whipped topping instead of whipped cream (for convenience).  The blueberry topping I kept pretty much the same but added a tablespoon of lemon zest.  The pie was wonderful, creamy like a fluffy cheesecake (I'm glad I doubled the cream cheese though otherwise I think it would have been too fluffy) and the blueberry topping was a great consistency with just the right sweetness.  The lemon juice and extract brought out the blueberry flavor even more.  Definitely a keeper!

This is so good!  I do recommend doubling the whipped cream filling and adding a little vanilla.  DON'T miss the step of WHIPPING YOUR HEAVY CREAM before folding it into the cream cheese!  Don't cook the blueberry mixture too long, otherwise it will be the consistency of jello when it cools completely and looks strange when you mix it up and spread it over the pie.  You could top it off with a few fresh blueberries to make it look super nice!

WOW!  This was by far the best blueberry pie I have had.  Its like haveing the pie and whipped topping all in one slice.  This was also very easy to make but looks like it was hard.
I did add some vanilla to the cream cheese mixture

I made mini blueberry pies using a muffin tin and they turned out great. Not a single one left! Some people had thirds even. I used the Mrs. Snigg's Snickerdoodle recipe (from this site) for the crust, eliminating the last step of rolling them in sugar and cinnamon of course. I just pressed the cookie dough into a muffin tin and baked out some crusts. I also used slightly more cream cheese for the filling and since I didn't have any whipping cream used canned whipped cream for the filling. Still turned out wonderfully!

I take issue with this recipe calling for fresh OR frozen blueberries without specifying the need to increase the cornstarch accordingly if using frozen. An inexperienced cook would have a bit of a flop with this recipe as such. Otherwise, this is a simple and refreshing dessert. Perfect for a light, informal end to any meal. I chose to make a graham cracker crust over a pastry one to keep this a no bake dessert and for the sake of simplicity. Very nice!

!st attempt at Blueberry pie, it was wonderful. This is not overly sweet, esp. the cream cheese mix. I used a shortbread crust- made in food processor (took about 5 min) Crust was so good - I could eat it plain! This recipe topped it off. I wasn't sure how long to cook the blueberry filling and cooked a bit too long. Cook just until it is still a little runny or it will be stiff & gooey. Not a difficult recipe at all

Very easy to prepare and a hit at a dinner party. I made mini pies also so people could take a sample home with them. One recipe can make 6 mini pies.

Made this for Mother's Day & got tons of compliments, even from the picky eaters in the house!  I had some fresh organic raspberries that I needed to use up, so I substituted those for the blueberries and reduced the lemon juice, since the raspberries were already tart enough. Other than that, I followed the recipe as written.  It was absolutely delicious & oh so easy to make!  I plan on trying it again with blueberries.

Loved it - I was a bit nervous as I taste tested each component and thought - this is just OK - but after a few hours in the fridge and all together - FANTASTIC! And, the color and texture seems really off until the blueberry mixture comes to a boil. Then it looks (and tastes) just right! I did add vanilla to the cream cheese mixture - it seemed to need it. Great recipe!

I run my own small pie baking business and started baking & selling this pie a month or so ago.  It has quickly become very popular with my customers.  They all love it & I do too.  It is incredibly easy to make and tastes better the next day.  I cook up the blueberry filling the day before, cover it with plastic and let it cool.  The same day I mix up the cream cheese/whip cream & spread it in the baked shell, then refrigerate.  I make extra whipped cream to pipe around the edges of the finished pie (FYI: 1/2 cup unwhipped cream = 1 cup whipped).  I do not change one thing in the recipe except that I add a bit of vanilla & sugar to the whip cream for the piping on top.  Have made this using other berries too - just as delish.  A very versatile recipe, with a wonderful presentation.  Thanks Lisieux for this terrific (& easy) recipe!

I have made this pie several times in the past couple of months.  Everyone has told me that it is the best blueberry pie they have ever eaten!  It is fairly simple to make - just be sure to leave enough time to allow the blueberry and sugar mixture to cool completely before spreading it on top of the coolwhip/cream cheese mixture.

One of my favorite pies of all time! Light and refreshing, not heavy at all, even with the cream cheese. I use a 16oz bag of frozen (Wymans---they are by FAR the best tasting) blueberries. Make sure to bake the shell and prepare the berry sauce first so they have time to cool. This is perfect for warmer weather and great for the fourth of july:) Thank you so much.

I made this as tarts and they were a HIT!
Can't wait to try with other berries as well.

this pie is amazing! i'm giving it 4 stars as written, because the cream cheese layer most definitely  needs to be doubled.  as i read reviews from those who doubled just the cream cheese, i decided to double the whole layer as i imagine doubling just the cream cheese would change the flavor and consistency  of that layer.  i'm so glad i did - it was a tight squeeze but still fit in the pie shell. the blueberry layer is absolutely delicious - ever so slightly tart, but sweet and juicy and full of fresh blueberry flavor.  i think i might even borrow the method for the blueberries to make a compote to go over pancakes.  this recipe is a great change from traditional blueberry pie, and is very easy to make as well.  thanks for posting!!

Great tasting pie!!  After reading several other reviews I did modify it just a teeny bit.  Added a splash of vanilla to the cream cheese mixture, and did 2 cups of frozen blueberries and 1 cup of frozen raspberries to give it a bit of tartness.  And I'm SO glad I added those, it turned out great.  My berry mix was thick enough, didn't need to add more cornstarch like some other reviewers (maybe they didn't cook the sugar/water mixture long enough?).  Anyway, THANKS for posting this recipe, I'll add it to my favorites and make it again.

Used 8 oz reduced fat Philly, just right.  Graham Cracker crust to which I added 1t. cinnamon. Topped with more fresh berries. Used large springform which made it on the thin side, will use med next time. Next time add pecans to crust also.

Yummy.  I made the recipe exactly as written with the exception of adding a little vanilla to the cream cheese mixture.  The cream cheese mixture was light and creamy, and the blueberry topping was excellent, not overly sweet.  Delicious  – we loved it.

I'm a big pie maker and fan and this ranks up there as one of my favorite.  I did make a shortbread crust and it really complemented the pie.  Made with fresh blueberries but think I will try frozen when they are out of season and am willing to bet it I will still taste great.  I may try putting it in a springform next time just to make the cooking of the shortbread crust easier.

I must say that this is quite tasty. Not way too sweet. I personally like more crust so the lack of the lattice top of a traditional pie was a little disappointing. Next time I will make more crust and put shapes on top! I also think next time I will add just a little more cream cheese mixture for my personal prefrence. I used fresh blueberries and the end product set up very nicely and not runny. I did also add a little vanilla (1/4 tsp)to the ceam cheese mixture.

This recipe was easy enough, and tasted fine, it just wasn't super. My kids liked it, so I might make it again, but both my husband and I were a little underwhelmed. It would probably be better with a graham cracker or cookie crust.

Awesome! I took other reviewers advice and upped the cream cheese to 8oz and added 1 tsp. of vanilla. I also added a little extra corn starch since I used frozen blueberries that we had picked this summer. Glad I did, I think it would have been too runny. I made an extra batch of the cream cheese/whipped cream mixture to use on my pumpkin pie instead of regular whipped cream. Amazing.

BEST Blueberry pie recipe I have ever made. I have given this recipe to so many people. Everyone loves it .It keeps well in the fridge . Tha bottom  cream cheese layer keeps the blueberries from making the crust soggy like other blueberry pies.

It was just okay, I thought it was blueberry overkill, I would only do half the blueberries next time. My husband enjoyed it and thought it was great, but I could hardly notice the cream with the mouthful of blueberries, it was just too much for me.
If you love blueberries, you will probably enjoy the recipe as it is.

Pretty good for a "quick" pie.  Good for a summer night.  Nobody "raved", but nobody complained either and there was none left.

My mother used to make this only she would cover the shortbread crust with sliced bananas before adding the mixture to it AND the mixture has vanilla in it!

Very yummy pie!  Made just as the recipe said, and truned out darn good!  I did put a little more corn starch in with the blueberries, so it wouldn't be runny, and I didn't make the whipping cream I just bought a container of it, and used that, but other then that stuck to the recipe.  Nice and light cream cheese with the whipping cream.

Made it exactly according to the recipe (except maybe adding more blueberries, I didn't measure) and it turned out great!  Got a lot of compliments and it was delicious!  Would definitely make again.

Great recipe!  I made this with the shortbread crust from the site (amazing) and did as another suggested and saved 1/4 cup of blueberries and tossed them in at the end, not sure if that made a difference but the overall pie was amazing, thanks for sharing!

This pie was a hit.   This was the FIRST fruit pie that I have ever made and it turned out great.  Simple, yummy. My family was shocked that I made a pie for my Dad's birthday - and they all loved it.

I made this yesterday for a dinner party and it was very easy and it tasted great!  I doubled the cream cheese mixture and actually added more blueberries because I had a deep dish pie plate.  Everyone enjoyed this so I will make it again!

This is so amazingly delicious. I thought it was a little time-consuming to wait for everything to cool, and then refrigerate the pie, but in the end it was SO WORTH IT. The pie is amazing after it's been chilled. I was worried it would be too soft, but it's held together fantastically! I used a pre-made crust and it was still great. I'll definitely try it with other fruit.

I only made the filling for another recipe- and it was awesome. ^^ I do decrease the sugar a bit, and use other berries too! Also add vanilla.

Oh my gosh!!! So good! I followed other reviewers advice and added a 1/2 tsp of vanilla to the whip cream. The other things I did differently was to use a graham cracker crust, blackberries and lime juice. I only used the blackberries and lime juice because that is what I had but it was delicious! I can't wait to try blueberries! 9/11/2016 - Update: I made just the fruit filling to top a cheesecake. 1 tbl of cornstarch was plenty since I didn't need it to hold up on it's own.

This was a nice twist on pie!  I did add 1 teaspoon of vanilla, 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon and 1/4 teaspoon of cloves to the blueberry mixture because I thought it needed some ooomph.  I made the recipe again, this time with strawberries.  I sliced fresh strawberries onto the cream cheese filling, and then made the glaze with 1 cup of mashed strawberries and spread that over top of the fresh strawberries.  I did not add any vanilla or spices to the strawberry version.  Both were really tasty.

i love this pie!!!! i do think that more cream cheese filling makes it better, but that is just my preference. it's awesome either way! i also use a graham cracker crust, much better than a regular crust.

The store bought deep dish pie crust wasn't quite big enough to hold all the blueberry mixture.  It was really good though.  I might try a graham crumb mixture next time.

I have a recipe almost like this, I do use more cream cheese that has been recommended.  I use a graham cracker crust and add almond flavoring to the blueberries and at the end add more blueberries to the top.  Very yummy!

Years ago I used to make a similar recipe, but with blueberry pie filling and "Dream Whip" instead of whipping cream.  Homemade is much better!  Definitely use a shortbread/graham cracker/cookie type crust and for a little something different, slice bananas onto crust before filling with the cream cheese mixture.  Bananas, blueberries and cream cheese....YUMMY!!!

This has been my requested birthday "cake" every year since I can remember.  I never liked regular cake, and cheesecake is too dense for me.  My mom made me this "blueberry cheesecake" all the time and I love it!  We used to just used canned blueberries, which is probably the same as doing the cornstarch and cooking them up yourself.  Other than that it was exactly the same!

Yummy!  I gave this recipe 4 stars only because I changed it up a bit.  I used a graham cracker crust, mixed 8 oz cream cheese with 8 oz cool whip, and followed the berry sauce exactly.  Delicious and a fantastic summer dessert.  Note:  with the changes it filled a deep dish pie plate to the brim!

I made the mistake of changing the recipe before trying it as written-big mistake.  I used a graham cracker crust, but it's def. better with regular pie crust.  I used tapioca instead of cornstarch, but that gave it a weird consistancy.  SO:  follow the recipe (add more cream cheese if want a thicker layer because the layer is pretty thin as written) and you will have a delicious pie!!!

Maybe I did something wrong, but this just didn't turn out that great. Next time I'll try a recipe where the whole thing goes in the oven. This just fell apart on me and didn't do the blueberries justice.

Wow!  We substituted blackberries for the blueberries since we had those in the freezer and this turned out great.  It was the most sought pie at our family Christmas get-together Sunday.  We used the Miracle Baking Powder Pie Crust (6th time used and super easy every time).  The ingredients and setting up took place just as described and it was delicious.  I'm looking forward to adapting it to pineapple and then cherries for extra special treats.

Pie is awesome!  I made this pie for thanksgiving and everyone loved it.  I did add vanilla to the cream cheese mix and used 6 oz of cream cheese as recommended by other reviewers.  My crust was a pre-made store bought gluten free crust from Whole Foods Market- very good crust.  Likey will make the pie's filling with out the crust for a dessert.

I made this for a family get-together. I always check out reviews, so did make one change which was to make a shortbread cookie crust. It was a hit! This pie is fantastic.

Hi everyone - I need a little help please.  I made the crust/cream cheese part of this recipe and it came out perfect.  But, when I make the blueberry part (I've tried 2x now), it's way too watery.  I've let it boil for awhile, but then the blueberries lose their skin, I've decreased how much water I've used but that doesn't seem to help.  I've been using the Light Corn Syrup (it's all that I have access to here in Europe) - could this be the problem?  Any suggestions??  I'm at a loss as to how to make this work!

I made this twice yesterday for a potluck. It was very well received, and I constantly had to stop whatever I was doing to accept praises from the adults. I changed the recipe so much, it was arguably a different dessert! I made the crust using a sugar cookie recipe but with whole wheat flour. It was too oily, so I had to add more flour, and the baking soda/powder made the crust rise significantly. However, I felt that the whole-grain flour gave great texture. For the filling, I melted white chocolate and mixed it in with softened cream cheese - I think that really made the recipe extraordinary! Try it - all you have to do is melt the white chocolate in the microwave and then stir it in. I used the organic blueberries that I picked last week, and it turned out great. You can mix jams together for a really special flavour. All of the tastes - the sugar cookie crust, the white chocolate filling, and the blueberry topping, made this recipe a real winner!

Made this for a July 4th gathering and everyone raved. Easy to make and delicious. I used a ready-made shortbread crust which worked well, except the blueberry mixture overflowed a bit. Next time, I would either reduce the quantity of blueberries or save some of the blueberry filling for a topping, maybe for pancakes!

Delicious!  I don't like blueberry pies, but went berry picking w/my kids and needed something to make.  This was REALLY good.  Used the shortbread crust recipe someone else recommended, it was perfect with it.  :)

Great recipe! I changed it a little after reading other reviews, I didn't want to risk a soggy crust. I doubled the cream cheese and confectioner's sugar and added 1 tsp of Vanilla. I did not use the whipping cream. My family LOVED this pie, said it was a keeper. Serve with sweetened whipped cream. Will definitely make again! Thanks

Delicious! I am not a fan of blueberries normally, AND I don't like pie at all, but my husband loves both so I thought he would like this.  I made it and took it to Thanksgiving at my mom's.  Unfortunately my husband did not get to eat too much of it because I had several slices myself! I can't wait to take it to Christmas at my dad's now!  I made it exactly as written, except I doubled the filling part of the recipe because I all I had was a deep dish frozen pie crust so it needed twice as much filling to look right.  Yum!

Truly excellent. Easy to make. Fresh tasting. Not too sweet. Bursting with blueberries, and with just a little cheesecake flavor and then some salty, buttery crust. Everyone loved it.  I made it just as written.  Thank you!

I love eating this pie but I hate making it. If I follow the recipe exactly I get too much blueberry and not enough filling. I doubled the filling and cut back to 2 cups of blueberries and the pie is over flowing the 9 inch shell. In both cases I don't think I whipped the heavy cream enough because I ended up with a soupy mix. Five stars on the taste though, minus one for the ratio of the ingredients.

Perfectly yummy!  I was in Kauai with a friend of mine a few months ago and their is a pie company there that sells pies in the local grocery stores.  Their pies are Amazing!  Well, the first pie we bought was the blueberry cream cheese.  It was pure heaven.  The kind of dessert that you think of LONG after it's gone.  When I got home I dreamed of that pie for months.  Finally, I could stand it no more and began hunting for a blueberry cream cheese pie recipe that I believed might possibly be as good as that pie.  As luck would have it, I tried this recipe (because it used the fresh whipping cream instead of sweetened condensed milk-lighter).  Voila!  I did double the cc and wc filling, because the cheesy part really stood out in the dream pie.  So I recommend that too.  You may end up with a bit of leftover filling.  I chose to crush up some iced oatmeal cookies and throw them in the bottom of a large ramekin and make a mini pie (for when the main event was gone).  Enjoy!  It's light, delicious and just like the island's!

This is a keeper.   I used a prepared graham cracker crust in place of the regular crust so I wouldn't have to use the oven since it was 98 degrees when I made it.  I also used Cool Whip for the whipped cream.  And I doubled the cream cheese as others suggested.   Very good and simple to make.

This recipe was easy and excellent. I did double the cream cheese requirements, added vanilla flavoring and use cool whip. Even with my substitutions, this dessert was a great hit and will be for years to come.

This is one of my favorite desserts! I've made this multiple times and my favorite way to make it is to use half blueberries and half raspberries. The raspberries add the perfect amount of tartness, so I don't even bother to add the lemon juice. It has so much more flavor with both berries! I also double the cream cheese mixture (and add 1 tsp. vanilla to it) and cut the berry mixture to 2 cups of frozen berries, 2 Tbsp. cornstarch, 1/2 C water and 1/2 C sugar. It's one of my favorite things to serve to guests!

I followed the recipe as is and it was very good - lots of compliments!  Next time, I think I will try the lemon zest and double cream cheese suggestions.  Also, will definately use a deep dish pie crust as the layers filled a regular 9 inch store bought shell all the way to the top.

This is a good pie but for me could be better.  I think the cream cheese layer needs something, maybe lemon juice to brighten the flavors because otherwise it was extremely bland and I even added vanilla to it.  I doubled the cream cheese layer because I had a large size graham cracker crust.  The blueberry sauce recipe is a good one and I love the lemon juice in it.  Overall a good pie but with some additional flavorings to tweak the cream cheese layer could be five stars.

AMAZINGLY DELICIOUS. I took other reviewer's suggestions and doubled the cream cheese, which nicely offset the sweet-tangy berry sauce. I USED BLACKBERRIES INSTEAD OF BLUEBERRIES--and my brother and i stood and DEVOURED some of the sauce before we even put it on the pie! Also--used chocolate graham cracker crust, which added a nice touch.

Delicious and easy. I made it twice in two days. I zested the lemon into the cr cheese mixture and added a tsp of vanilla. Also added a smidge of nutmeg and cinnamon to the berry mix. I made it the first time with just frozen blueberries and the second time with frozen mixed berries. Delicious both ways. Also just used a store bought graham crust. Took to a friends house and we all loved it!

Awesome!!! I used 6 oz of cream cheese as 8 didn't spread nicely and 4 just wasn't quite enough. I also used a fieldberry mix, but it was fabulous and my dinner party was asking for the recipe almost instantly.

I made this exactly as the recipe said and it came out amazingly delicious. It was a big hit. My only note is to definitely make sure it stays refrigerated when not being eaten... we wound up getting to the pie a couple hours later than I expected and the cream cheese layer had sort of softened/melted a little, which made serving awkward. It was still delicious, even if it was less of a slice and more of a pile, though.

This is simular to a pie that my grandmother made. Just use a graham cracker crust & add a layer of banana's under the blueberrues. It was always a wonderful treat when we would go to her house and have a slice (or two).

We made this yesterday :) And there's only one slice left! I made a couple of changes though, because I didn't have all the ingredients. I used sweetened condensed milk instead of whipping cream and confectioners sugar, and I added lemon juice to both the blueberry and the cream cheese mixture. It was really good! I'll definetly make this one again.

Made this pie yesterday to raves from both my husband (super picky) and my son.  We just love this pie.  I did use 8oz. cream cheese.  That is the only change I made.  To me, this is a great refreshing dessert that is not too sweet.  I just don't care for the overly sweet anymore.  Thanks so much for submitting this recipe.  It is yummy.

This was a wonderful, quick, and easy recipe. I used a graham cracker crust. I also used this recipe to make individual deserts. I put a vanilla wafer in the bottom of custard dishes and topped that with the cream and then the blueberries. It looked great and was a big hit.

This was so fast & easy to make! I made adjustments to the cream mixture because I was missing the heavy cream and most of the cream cheese. So I added some cool whip, a tablespoon of low fat sour cream and some lemon zest. It was delicious by its self!! (It would be a great fruit dip.)   It was gone in 5 minutes of serving it.  Thank you!

If I could give this recipe 10 stars, I would.  It's so yummy.  I made it exactly as the recipe says and it turned out great.  I've come up with hundreds of variations to it too.  There's so many possibilities!  Next time I might freeze the cream cheese mixture before topping it, or mix a few fresh blueberries into the mixture for a little extra berry.

This IS a very good pie, but stick to the original amount of cream cheese because to much over powers the balance with the blueberry filling.  An earlier reviewer suggested saving some of the blueberries and tossing them in at the last minute and that was a FABULOUS suggestion.

Super good!  I made this for Christmas and used fresh raspberries (more festive) instead of blueberries.  I also used a pre-made graham craker crust.  It turned out great and was eaten up quickly!  I did add 1/2 tsp of vanilla and used 6 oz of cream cheese.  If you use 3 cups of raspberries/blueberries you will have extra filling.  I saved mine for an ice cream topper!

This pie tastes great and is super easy to make! I made two small changes: I added a 1/2 tsp vanilla to the cream cheese mixture and I used a 16 oz package of frozen blueberries. I thought the amount of the cream cheese layer and the amount of the blueberry mixture were perfect!

Good recipe.  The only things I did differently was to use already prepared dream whip instead of heavy cream and I used a full package of cream cheese (8 oz), instead of 4 oz.  I noticed the crust did get soggy the next day, but perhaps if you eat it all up, you won't have that problem :)

OMG this pie is amazing.  I made it with a shortbread crust, which was perfect.  I used 8 oz. of cream cheese and added 1/2 tps. vanilla to the cream cheese mixture.  I tried some right after making it and it was good, but after letting it sit overnight in the fridge, it became DIVINE.

After reading the reviews, I took Rollins4000's advice, used 6 oz cream cheese and tried it with a shortbread crust, the "Shortbread Crust" recipe on this site submitted by Silly Rabbit, set to 6 servings for a 9 inch pie, after reading the reviews for that recipe. It was amazing... my guests raved. I also used Cool Whip in place of the whipped cream, and still got raves. For the fruit topping, I only added 1/3 the blueberries to the water/corn starch mixture, and boiled that until it was clear. Then I added the rest of the blueberries and removed it from the heat. I think this results in a much fresher-tasting blueberry topping.

Wow, what a awesome pie! I used  fresh blueberries the roll out pie crust.It was a cinch to make. The only thing is that it took a while for the blueberries to cool to add them to the pie. I was just impatient. My husband loved it and told me this was a keeper! We can't wait to have another piece after dinner tonight. I would definately make this again, and for company too. It would definately impress. Yummy! update 2 days later...While having another piece of pie my husband said this was the best pie I ever, ever, ever made. We've been married for 16 years and I have made alot of good pies.

I made a vegan version of this pie with (commercially prepared) whipped soy cream and nondairy "cream cheese". I used fresh blueberries (that I picked myself!!) and a store-bought shortbread crumb crust. The only shortcoming was the crust...I should have made my own. The filling was much too heavy for a crumb crust and it didn't really stay together as a slice. Good thing it tasted so delicious - we didn't care how it looked!

Since I found this recipe about 3 weeks ago, I have made it 5 times and it's been completely demolished by people whenever I make it (my husband and myself included!!)  The only small change I made was to add 1/4 tsp of vanilla extract to the cream cheese mixture, and I used a store-bought shortbread crust.  It is amazing.  Fortunately, blueberries have been super cheap at my local supermarket so when it's not obsessively humid (like it is today), I whip one of these up and we either eat it ourselves or bring it and a bottle of wine over to friends houses.  Possibly one of my favorite recipes ever!!!

I'm not a huge fan of cooked blueberries (fresh w/whipped cream does it for me!), but this pie was pretty good.  The proportions were spot-on.  It didn't take long to make, and everyone seemed to like it.  I wish I had made a real crust, though.

I used about 1 Tbsp of lemon juice and otherwise followed the recipe.  It was fantastic!  My whole family loved it, and my brother and hubby fought over the last piece...which would have been my brother's 3rd piece that day, and my hubby's second!

not as good as i thought it would be after reading the reviews. the amt. of lemon juice called for in the recipe overwhelmed the blueberry flavor. i followed the advice of other reviewers and added vanilla to the cream cheese - that was a mistake. 1/4 to 1/2 tsp. of vanilla would be more than enough to enhance the flavor of the cream without overshadowing it. really a good idea though as an alternative to the same old blueberry pie.

Seriously, the best! And I am not a huge blueberry fan. I plan on making this again for the 4th of July. Note: I did increase the cream cheese to a full 8 oz. block and added a splash of whole milk because I did not have whipping cream.

Very good!  I was out of time so I bought premade sugar cookie dough and used that as the crust.  It worked very well.  Because it was so sweet, I cut the sugar in the fruit sauce to 1/2 cup.  Oh... and the store was out of blueberries so I did mostly strawberries and about 1/2 a cup of blueberries I already had. It was fantastic with strawberries as well.  I've already given out the recipe several times and the first bite was eaten less than 2 hours ago!

This was fantastic! Light and tasty, perfect summer dessert. I used 8 ounces cream cheese because we like the taste. Left out water in sauce since I used frozen blueberries. Can't wait to make with other fruits, very versatile and easy. Will try with graham cracker crust as well for no bake summer treats. I have made with graham cracker crust and prefer this over the pastry. I make this at least 1 or 2 times a month with different fruits.

This recipe was nothing short of simple and sweet!  I'm not to experienced with making pies but this recipe made me look like a pro.  The finished product is absolutely beautiful too.  I doubled the filling and added two teaspoons of vanilla for the 9inch deep dish crust.  Other than that, I followed the directions and was thrilled w/the finished product!

My boyfriend and I, being a couple of university students, have only been experimentally cooking for a short time and this was the first pie we ever made.  We used blueberries and strawberries for the filling, and it made quite a great jam as well!  It has the right amount of tartiness, with the lemon juice, and a yummy creaminess from the cream cheese!  It was just amazing!  Next time we're thinking about using only 2 2/3 cups of fruit, and then making the bottom layer slightly thicker.  RECIPE OF AWESOMENESS!  Thank you! :)

We love fresh blueberry pie which is quite different than this recipe however this one is very good.  I read reviews first and did double the amount of cream cheese, added more confectioners sugar and whipped twice as much cream.  My container of fresh blueberries was 4 cups so I used them all and added a little more lemon juice, corn starch, and sugar.  I saved out some of the whipped cream, I whipped more than 1 cup, then added a dollop per serving when served. This turned out to be delicious and loved by all.

This is a wonderful pie, but the cheese filling didn't go very far...I ended up having to make 1.5 and using that. Other than that, this pie is wonderful. Kinda like Blueberry Cheesecake, but focused on the blueberry, not cheese.

This recipe is awesome!!!! And it was so easy to make. It was a hit at Thanksgiving. Now I am making it for the potluck at my work and over the holidays for family. I used mini pastry shells that you can buy at the grocery store, otherwise I followed the recipe exactly. Thank you so much for such a delicious recipe!

Mine turned into a soup mess.  I used frozen blueberries, but tried to compensate for the extra liquid - still way runny.  I was hoping it would firm up, but it never did.  The cream cheese portion also tasted gritty after a day.

Awesome!!! I made two and just about ate one whole pie by myself the first day!!! This was really good. It was a very easy way to make a light cheese cake and the blueberry topping was wonderful. I think I will make mini cheesecakes for the holiday using this recipe trying out different fruits other than blueberries. Thanks for a winner!

This was the first pie I've ever made and this recipe was so easy to follow! I used frozen Blueberries and found that I had too much and had to throw some of that mixture out. I made it for mother's day, my entire family and mom, loved it! It was delicious. I would definitely use this recipe again!

This was so good! I made individual cheesecake portions by skipping the crust and topping a homemade almond cookie with the cream cheese mixture and then the blueberries. The blueberries I used were quite tart, so I didn't add the lemon juice. I also added some vanilla to the cream cheese mixture. I took this to a dinner party, and the guests raved about it.

This was good but not fantastic.  My guets liked it but I thought that something was missing...not sure what though.  It was easy.
