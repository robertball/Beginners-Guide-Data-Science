As written this recipe came up a little short. If you only use 1\2 cup of the chow mein noodles, they are drowning in the peanut butter/butterscotch mixture. I added a whole can of the chow mein noodles and that was much better. This recipe is very versatile, you can add anything you would like to this. I added mini marshmallows and dug around for some chocolate chips but had none :( maybe next time.

I just finished spooning these out and canâ€™t wait to try one.  Based on other reviews,  I reduced the peanut butter to 2/3 cup (I wanted a stronger butterscotch flavor) and used about 1.5 cans (5oz each) of chow mein noodles.  That made a good consistency; not too dry or soupy.  They smell amazing.

Super simple recipe!  Definitely need to, at the very least, double the chow mein noodles.  I used an entire 12 Oz bag of La Choy chow mein noodles and the mix was still soupy.  They taste amazing!!
