These cookies deserve every bit of five stars. The only tip to pass along is to be sure to chop the nuts into smallish pieces, they are much better if they kind of blend into the texture of the cookie rather than stand out. I am so happy to find this recipe. My local bakery sells these for an arm and a leg, and my husband loves, loves, loves these. He loves these cookies so much that he came home from work ate four of them and then helped me with laundry- without me even asking him to help. These cookies have special powers!

Perfect cookies. Very tasty and crispy. Though it should be noted that you must put the pieces about 2 to 2 1/2 inches away from each other, or else they will touch and bind.

This is exactly the recipe my family has passed down for generations and it can't be beat!  The only exception is that we use butter-flavored Crisco in place of the butter and shortening.  The rolls of dough can also be frozen and used to make small batches of fresh cookies for your kids after school.  This one is a keeper!

Delicious cookies! I used only butter. I guess I shaped the roll too thick. The cookies were not crisp in ten minutes, but chewy. I had to bake five times in my oven, because there were so many! The second time I baked, I made them smaller, and now they were crisp, which I like better. Cutting the cookies didn't work for me, so next time I will only cool the dough and roll SMALL balls.(because they spread a lot) Dipping the fork in milk and flatten them, works fine as long as you dip after each flattening. From now on I will only use half or a third of the recipe.
* update: 
I forgot to put the nuts in, and also forgot to dip them with milk, and they were delicious!! My daugther keeps asking for another one..and another...

Wonderful recipe to have when you need cookies quickly!  I didn't have walnuts on hand so I used pecans.  They came out delicious and my husband and toddler did not want to stop eating them!  I'm glad I divided the dough into six rolls and froze some of them.  I like making my cookies on the smaller side so 1 roll yielded 10 cookies.  Even with them smallish, I had to bake them at 10 minutes because I dipped the fork in milk each time I flattened.  The cookies were crispy along the edges and a little moist in the center...  This oatmeal cookie recipe is a keeper.

These are SO good.  I really don't like when people 'change' the original recipe, howww-ever, use whole wheat flour for half of the total amount, a teaspoon of cinnamon and scoop or roll them in one inch balls to bake.  So chewy, remind me of the olden days :)

This is THE BEST oatmeal cookie recipe!  My cookies have always been horrible, but I baked these last week and actually won a blue ribbon at our county fair with them!  My family are actually asking me to make more!  I chopped up raisins and used them instead of the nuts and they were great!

In spite of a major "goof-up" these are the best cookies I have ever made.  After I baked the first roll, and they melted into one flat cake, I realized I had left out the flour.  Senior moment. I crumbled the 2nd roll and added 1/2 the flour measurement in small amounts, kneaded it and baked the most delicious cookies.  This is a very forgiving recipe.  I did press on top of each cookies, before baking, a few larger pieces of walnut.  I think that put it a little over the top.  The crispy, flat first batch was crumbled and saved to sprinkle over puddings, cereals, etc.

These cookies are the best Oatmeal cookies I've had. But here's the deal, my daughter made this recipe but changed it up a bit. She added 1 cup dark chocolate chips, 1 cup raisons and in place of flour she substituted the flour with 1 1/2 cups almond flour. They're amazing and more healthier on this version.

These cookies are fantastic!  My husband said they were some of the best cookies he has ever had!  They had great flavor.  It will be exciting to see the reviews (and stars) for this climb away after people try this awesome recipe!  I didn't chill the dough or roll it out first, I just dished out by the teaspoon and flattened with a fork dipped in milk.  Try this one; you will be glad you did!

WOW, are these cookies good cookies or what! I made the dough,put it in the freezer a week ago and finally had the chance to make a roll. I love icebox cookies and these are tops. They baked up nice and crisp and the flavor is wonderful. I used butter Crisco for the shortening and doubled the recipe which I am so glad I did. I took 1/2 of the cookies to the new neighbors and my husband can't stop eating the rest. I will be baking another roll tomorrow and will also be making more dough to have on hand in the freezer for nice hot and crisp cookies to be proud of and to serve to company at any time. Thank you for the great recipe. It will be at the top of our family cookie recipes.

This is the recipe I've used for years, except I use 1/2 the amount of finely chopped walnuts (personal taste) and I've never heard of dipping the fork in milk to flatten...I just cook & they flatten as they bake. Definately one to double up on & store in the freezer for later use. YUM!

These were quite tasty & CRISPY. (I did flatten them to 1/4" thick using a greased spatula & baked them 12 minutes.) OK, all of you who said they came out chewy, admit you used all margarine or butter instead of shortening. The reason it makes such a big difference is that margarine & butter have some water in them, and shortening doesn't. The exception is special European-style butter which has much of the water squeezed out so it cooks more predictably. You can find it at upscale supermarkets and gourmet stores. The only change I made was to add 2/3 cup of raisins. Unlike most cookie recipes, these did not come out too sweet for me using the full amount of sugar.

I liked it. I know it's annoying when people review a recipe and then list all the edits they made, but well, if you can't beat'em, join'em!  Here's what I did:  I only used 2 cups of regular oats, because I also used 2 cups of excellent semi-sweet chocolate chips.  I also only used like maybe a 1/2 cup of walnuts, cause I was out!  I also didn't do the refridgerating part, cause I'm LAZY!  Anyhow - the result was 4 dozen cookies.  They bake up nice and big, they end up CRISPY and EXCELLENT.  I love the flavor and the texture.  A nice mix of oatmeal and chocolate.  So - that's my version!!!!!

These are gooooood. Just plain goooooood. In a good way, of course. I cut the recipe in half, and still yielded 36 cookies.. mmmMMMmmmm are these crispy. The only thing I'd change is not adding as many nuts the recipe says to add when you split the recipe and make them tiny as I did, but I won't let my mistakes make me rate this any lower! ...as is the recipe is 5 stars!

These were delicious, and I'm not even a huge oatmeal cookie fan! My boyfriend was also a fan of their crispy, almost butterscotch-y taste. The extra bit of salt really made them something special!  I did not have butter on hand, so I used mostly shortening with as much margarine as I had. Probably a 3/4 cups shortening, 1/4 cup margarine. I also subbed walnuts for dried blueberries, which were delicious. The cookies took a little longer than 10 minutes and I did not roll and chill them, just used an 1/8 cup measuring spoon as a scoop. Very good, will be making again to go through all the oats and shortening I have lying around the house!

Awesome, classic, perfect oatmeal cookies! We LOVED these cookies & ate a dozen of them right off the bat (there's only the Hubster and myself here), so I'll have to say that they're pretty tasty! Halved the recipe & got 4 dozen perfect-sized cookies. I also used pecans along with the walnuts since we didn't have enough walnuts. I hardly ever have a glass of milk voluntarily, but dipping these crispy little cookies sure did the trick! Thanks for the great recipe! :)

These are terrific! I've made 2 batches of these cookies now. I added 1/2 tsp cinnamon to the dough with the oats.  I decided to use a juice cup to get rid of the tine marks on the cookies, but don't forget to dip into the milk! I split about half of the dough into wax paper, so I had 2 logs. The first one I cook, and the second one I freeze for later. Thanks for the great recipe!

These are REALLY delicious, but I'm giving them 4 stars based on the instructions being a bit vague. "Shape into long rolls"? How long? How big should they be? How many rolls? I didn't know, so I just guessed. I guessed wrong and just made one 2 1/2' long log, so I ended up with bigger, chewier cookies. DELICIOUS, but not crispy. Next time, I would definitely divide the dough into two 2.5' logs and I imagine it'll go better. Also, be sure to place the cookies 2-3" apart or they'll stick together. But really, even messing up the size of the cookies... it doesn't matter that much. You still end up with a delicious, SUPER easy to make cookie. I used pecans instead of walnuts since it's what I had on hand, and I chopped them very finely so they blended in with the cookies instead of standing out.

These were excellent!!!!!  I added about a cup of raisins (that I ran through the blender, I don't like big pieces of raisins) and they were so good that everyone who had them asked for the recipe.  I have found the ultimate oatmeal cookie at long last!  Also I got about 4 dozen good size cookies rather than 36.

Light and chewy, with a lot of texture. I added a little cinnamon and a package of cinnamon chips and omitted the walnuts.  I made these as  drop cookies using a medium cookie scoop, flattening them slightly, and baking about 9-10 minutes at 375 degrees. Good old-fashioned cookie jar cookie.

I tried this recipe and found it very difficult to make very flat so I would get a nice crispy cookie. The first batch turned out better than the second I made cause I didn't stick the dough in the fridge. They were easier to work with the first. I made the dough into a roll and stuck in the fridge and found they were falling apart when I went to slice them and put them in the oven. I think you can use a better recipe and press the dough to make them crispy. Also, whenever I make oatmeal cookies I add cinnamon...add a good flavor and spice.

I had my doubts about an oatmeal cookie without cinnamin or nutmeg, but these came out really good.  I omitted the nuts and added currents because I don't know the recipient and didn't want any allergic reactions.  My son says they remind him of cookies he used to buy at the bakery.  Thanks for sharing.

I actually discovered almost the identical recipe one day when i forgot to add the flour to a regular oatmeal cookie recipe. Though this recipe uses flour, you can get away without it if u decrease the baking time. I also add maple syrup instead of vanilla, torbino sugar instead of the white sugar, add minced dates into the mix and sliced dates scattered liberally around the top. I've never gotten a complaint from them but watch the oven because there is a very fine line between perfect and crispy bottom! :)

Deliciously thin, crispy oatmeal goodness!  I didn't have shortening so I used all butter and they were still crispy and delicious!  I've made this recipe twice now and I'm in love with it.  I will say the cookies need to cool to become completely crisp, if you're using all butter.  I added some chocolate chips and omitted the nuts and they were fabulous.  You won't be disappointed with this yummy recipe!  By the way, I cut the recipe to only 9 servings (1/4 of the recipe) and it yielded about 14 cookies.  Perfect smaller batch size...

I have been making these for a few years now and they are always a hit! I usually switch the measurements of butter and shortening which seems to caramelize the cookies a bit more. I also use whole old fashioned oats. Never added raisins or chips as this recipe is the Bomb as it is!

These cookies are fantastic. Followed recipe exactly. The only thing I did differently was to roll dough into balls and flatten with fork. Didn't need to dip fork in milk. Baked for 14 minutes. Made about 6 dozen cookies. This recipe is a keeper. Thanks for sharingCathie.

The first thing I did was reduce the sugars to 2/3 c. each.

And the cookies turned out... 
yuuuuum. 
I loved the first crunch I felt when I bit into it, and my house was enveloped in such a beautiful aroma when the ten minutes (actually, it was more than that because I had to let the cookies cool) were up. 
The cookies were still a bit too sweet for me, but that's only because my tolerance for sugar isn't as high as others.
In the end, I was very happy to have tried this recipe. It's a keeper. :)

These were wonderful!  I followed the recipe exactly but simply refrigerated the dough for an hour or so, then just put balls of dough (about the size of a tablespoon) on the cookie sheet and pressed them down with the bottom of a glass dipped in sugar.    I sprinkled powdered sugar on the finished cookies.  They were Great!!!

just made these and they were great. the only changes i made were lessening the sugar to start, 2 cups of sugar, too much.  i used a half cup of sugar & 1/2 cup of brown.  i also used white wheat flour & since i don't use shortening i used my trusty coconut oil instead. perfect healthy substitute for shortening. also i didn't do the roll part,, i just made sure the dough was mixed & shaped it into a ball in the bowl & just let it chill for an hour or 2. i didn't have enough wax paper to roll

These are delicious cookies!!  Made them with my six yr old daughter last night and they came out beautifully perfect and oh so tasty!!  I do not like walnuts so I used chopped almonds instead and is so yummy!  I did not make a  roll and refrigerate at all.   Just mixed everything together and rolled into small balls and pressed with fork dipped in milk (my daughter had a blast doing that part!)  and baked for about 8 min and they came out awesome and picture perfect!  See picture above!!   Thanks for the great recipe Cathie.

Yummmmmmm! I skipped the shaping/chilling/cutting/smushing steps, since I'm not a fan of extra steps in cookie baking. I swapped the walnuts for chocolate chips, and just stuck the extra dough in the fridge as each batch baked. I made rounded teaspoonfuls, and got 4 dozen cookies out of the recipe. I wound up cooking each batch about 14 minutes-- crispy on the outside, a little chewy in the middle.

I love this recipe-it has been lost from my files, and I was glad to find it here.  it is a 5 star oatmeal cookie with a butterscotch taste to it.  My recipe included 1/2 cup of coconut, so I reduced the sugar in this recipe by 1/3 cup and added the coconut. AWESOME!

A big hit with everyone.  I only use 1-2 rolls at a time so I could bake fresh cookies after dinner.

these are exactly what I was looking for, plus I like the option of them being refrigerator cookies, so I made 12 froze rest and will have fresh cookies when I want them.

I did not have any shortening in the house, so used butter and they still turned out crisp. I added a 1/8 teaspoon cinnamon and a couple of handfuls of raisins, and about three tablespoons coconut. I was out of vanilla too so I only made a few so I could add the vanilla the next day. My husband said they were great even without the vanilla. This is a keeper recipe.

These cookies are just what I was hoping for. Delicious and crunchy!
I substituted the white sugar with Splenda and kept the brown sugar. They couldn’t have been better.

I may have added a few more walnuts and I added raisins.  I think this is the best all around cookie recipe out there!

Awesome cookies! Didn't have any shortening, so I just used 1 cup butter (total). I rolled out 6 logs (each about an inch in diameter) and cut them into 1/4" slices. Baked for 8 minutes. Very good and I love that I can just throw the logs in the freezer to use at will. Thank you for the wonderful (and simple!) recipe!

My grandma made these for years and they are a favorite! We keep the batter in the freezer for a few hours and bake at 400. They are always crispy, yum!

I really liked this recipe. I only substituted coconut for the nuts as I didn't have any. They turned out great. Baked for 11 min and they were perfect. This recipe is definitely a keeper.

I made this the first time at Christmas time because my oldest son doesn't like raisins in his oatmeal cookies....He and everyone else loved them.  He is coming home from college today for spring break and I thought about this recipe and pulled it up again to make.  I just finished the last batch and did some different things this time...like one batch without the nuts....couple of batches w pecans...and then I threw in some peanut butter chips and dried cranberries in the last couple of batches - with the remaining dough with pecans in it...oh I forgot to mention I doubled the recipe because it was such a hit the last time....the last batch with the dried cranberries and peanut butter chips and pecans tasted kinda like a granola bar....very tasty!

I put in a half cup of butter and a third cup of peanut oil. I pressed them down with my fingers. The raw dough was a bit crumbly. The cookies baked for 12 minutes at 350. The cookies were flat and crispy when cool. The probably would have been better with some chocolate chips added in. 

I am not sure I will make them again. If I do, I will just chill the bowl of dough and make drop cookies instead of the way the recipe suggested.

SERIOUSLY amazing cookies.  We didn't have any nuts in the house so we went straight oatmeal and everyone who's tried one has the same thing to say about them, the BEST oatmeal cookie they've ever had.  This is going in the archives.
