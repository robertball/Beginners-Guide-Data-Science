Absolutely delicious!  My husband does NOT like chili, and when I told him that we would be eating this for dinner, he was not thrilled.  However, he RAVED about this and told me to give it five stars.
I made no changes to the recipe, and even though some reviewers said it was 'bland', neither my husband or I like particularly hot dishes, so I kept the chili powder as is - it was PERFECT.  I only had one pound of meat, but it was fine.  And, I dumped the whole thing in the crock pot and cooked on low for the afternoon.  
Thank you for a fabulous recipe!

We are Minnesotan's.
I love this recipe, although it is a little bland.  I prefer a little more flavor.
To start I wanted to do this in the crock pot, so I browned the Hamburger and then the veggies in a pan.
I added the rest, plus a bit more chili  powder, a little cumin, as well as a few glugs of worschestire, and a dash or two of cinnamon. Awesome, because we like the chili a little sweet I added 2 tablespoons of sugar rather then the 1.
Good basic start to a great pot of chili.

Wonderful!
I planned ahead and browned the beef and chopped the vegetables with dinner the night before and threw it all in the crock pot the next morning (left out the cup of water).  I kept it on low all day and it turned out perfect.  You do need the 6 quart crock pot though!

Good base recipe, but I like to substitute honey for the sugar and black beans (rinsed) for the kidney beans.  A bit of hot sauce or cayenne will spice it up, and a tsp. of worchestershire and soy sauce will give it some depth of flavor.  Totally omit the water.

I was really suprized whe I read this recipe, this is allmost exactly the same chili My family has been making for years. The only thing I would recomend is draining the fat off the ground beef before adding the rest of the ingredients, I also cook my onions first in the pot that I brown the ground beef in and add them after draining the fat off.

I'm sorry this is the blandest chili I ever had. Like a golf course... I had to add and add to make it have some flavor. Sorry, for me, I will not make this again.

We loved it!  I doubled the recipe and served it to 6 hungry friends on football Sunday.  We had plenty of leftovers!  This was a very simple chili for those who like the traditional.  I added a lot of spice.  It seemed a bit tame.  I used red pepper flakes, red pepper sauce and more chili powder.  It needed that kick.

This was my recipe of choice for the Super Bowl. I used 2 cans of the diced tomatoes with onion, celery, & green pepper.(14 oz) (Same as stewed tomatoes- just pre-cut) I used my Zyliss chopper to make the celery & onion super fine- came out GREAT.(I don't like crunchy bits of celery either!) Next time I will do the green pepper that way, too! I had already chopped it by hand & thrown in the pot- it was fine this way anyway. I did saute' the veggies in a little olive oil, then added the meat. The only other thing: it was too mild- & I'm a wuss! So next time I will add more chili powder. I love the consistency of this chili.

Excellent chili - much like I make all the time except I use BROWN sugar in place of your white, maybe even a little more than a Tbls. and a touch more chili powder.  This really is a no-fail chili whether in the crock pot or stove top!

My wife is not a fan of chili. I have made this for three weeks straight!!! She can't get enough of it. I almost have it commited to memory. I now put all the ingrediants in a slow cooker, raw ground beef and all, for about 6-8 hours on low. I thought it was a little bland. So I add cheese, onions and a little tobasco upon serving. Leftovers make great toppings for chilidogs and/or burgers. Love this recipe. It is easy and can be modified to suit your taste!!!

Not your TYPICAL chili!  I added 8 oz. of fresh cliced mushrooms and a 1/2 tsp. of red pepper flakes (Why not?  It is already different).  Everyone loved it!  In fact, I made it twice in one week.  I have never made the same meal two times in a week.....It is good.

If you have to cook with a recipe (like I usually do), this chili is perfect and delicious! Good old fashioned chili, easy to make with ingredients you have on hand-doesn't need anything fancy. The flavor was perfect. Didn't have green pepper, added one whole red and one whole yellow pepper for the vitamins and I'll do this from now on! Thanks for a go-to recipe!

AWESOME!  It was my first time making chili, so I had no expectations whatsoever.  I was shocked by the taste of this - really great.  Perfectly spicy and delicious.  Even my husband, who is rarely impressed by "new" recipes, was floored by the flavors.

This chili was delicious. I made some of the changes suggested by others like adding a splash of Worcestershire, ground cumin, and a little extra chili powder. I also didn't have tomato paste on hand, so I used some left over marinara sauce. It turned out very flavorful and hearty. This will definitely be my gluten-free chili recipe of choice.

This was very much like Wendy's fast food restaurant chili. My family really liked this chili. I didn't care for it and thought it was very bland and needed a LOT more spice and I had doubled the chili powder already. Thanks.

Very good chili!  It could use a bit more flavour though - perhaps adding in some sausage to get it some extra zing.

this recipe was way too sweet. the sugar should be added later to de-tart the tomates if needed- not at the begining where it cooks through the recipe. we did this in a slow cooker and it was too thin, and needed to be transfered to the stove and thickened with cornstarch! other wise it was ok since we didnt even prebown the meat.

I love this Chili... it's a mildly spicy chili with a bit of a sweet taste as well!! I added a package of chili spices which had a chili pepper/salt/cumin mix in it for a bit more flavor. I also used 2 LB's of ground beef, added a few glugs of Worchestire sauce, used pinto beans because I loathe the kidney bean (LOL) and used brown sugar instead of white. Served with cornbread muffins and shredded cheddar cheese. A great recipe everyone enjoyed!!

I make something similar.  I use ground turkey breast and use the dried bean mix (I think it's Hodson's Mill?); also use the diced tomatoes with green chili peppers...and I like it spicy, so use about 2 tbsp each of cumin and chili powder....yummy!

Great! Just like my Michigan father made, and I had almost forgotten how to do it. Thank you. A tad bit of white sugar is important but a Tbsp might be too much. We used about 1 tsp.

I made this last night and place it over white rice.  It was fast and easy.  I did replace the water with a nice lager, added a total of 3 tbsp of chili powder and used a 28 ounce can of seasoned crushed tomatoes.  Delish!!!

This was delicious, I'd definitely make it again.  The only thing I did differently was to substitute one can of pinto beans for one can of the kidney beans because I didn't have 2 cans of kidney, and I added a tablespoon of ground cumin with the chili powder.  Even with the cumin, it still was not  too spicy, just right.  I served it with chopped fresh cilantro, grated chedder cheese, sour cream and tortilla chips that everyone could add to their bowl if they liked (I added everything to mine, yum!).

A good chili. I added the following ingredience: 1 tsp Liquid smoke, 1 tab cumin, 2 tsp oregano, and 1 tbs paprika. I felt that these ingrediences kicked up the flavor. Will use this recipe again. Good job.

This is yummy!  I made with stew meat instead of ground beef, and that was a nice change.  I also made my kidney beans from dried instead of using the canned (because I had dried on hand).  I used 1 T. brown sugar instead of white sugar, and added some cumin.

Not bad but not great.  I wish I had read other's reviews that said to leave out the water because I totally agree with that.  I made it just as the recipe says and it was far to watery for me.  Maybe I'd like it better if it wasn't so thin.  But the taste was rather mild.  I added some hot sauce and it was much better.

I loved this chili as it is. I don't like spicy chili, so it was perfect. Others can always add hot sauce to add some kick. TY for the recipe.

So tasty and easy to make!  Rather than simmer on the stove for an hour, I put it in the crock pot for six hours so I would have it for dinner that night.  Yum!

I made chili for the 1st time this week and this recipe helped me out alot. I loved it & so did my husband. I did a couple things diffrently. I used a crock pot rather than stove top. I also heard of an idea to use A1 for flavor as well as Franky's Hot Sauce. It was Fabulouse!!!!

This was a hit with the whole family.  The grownups used chipotle hot sauce with theirs, and we topped it with cheese.  I served a cheese cornbread with it.  There were no leftovers.

This was a hit at my party.  One of my guests raved that she loved it, and she claims to be a chili expert. Instead of chili powder, I used a chili seasoning packet that made it tasty, and not too spicy. Thanks for this recipe!

very good chili, I added some extra chili powder and some red pepper flakes for some extra spice.  I also used one can of chopped italian tomatoes and one can of italian tomato sauce (because that's what I had) and omitted the paste.  It tasted great

Very good!   I only had 1 lb of hamburger so I used that along with an extra Tablespoon of chili powder and a sprinkle of cumin.  Be sure to simmer for at least an hour as the chili becomes thicker the longer you cook it.  I did, however, leave out the water because I wanted it as thick as possible.

I cut this recipe in half and froze some for later.  The only thing I changed was to add a small can of Rotel diced tomatoes with green chilies and I skipped the sugar.  I think stewed tomatoes have sugar in them.
Delicious!

My family loves this chili!   I recently used it in a "chili cook-off" fund raiser for my son's school...I won a 3rd place!  I called it "simply chili", and it is just that...mild spice level, basic ingredients.  I used fresh ground chuck from the butcher, browned it first and drained well.  The chuck gives it great beefy flavor.  This recipe is a keeper!

Pretty good recipe. I liked the celery in there. We ended up putting a can of tomato sauce in it before it was a bit too chunky. Might want to add a bit more spice in it after the extra tomato sauce. Wasn't very spicy, still good though.

This was a great recipe!  My husband is picky and he said it was the best chili he has ever had.  The only thing I did different was add on 19oz can of Kidney beans and one 14oz can of pork and beans in tomato sauce, rather than adding two cans of the Kidney beans.  I also addes some red pepper flakes for some extra spiceness.

Awsome chili! Even my DH raved about it and he isn't a big chili fan. It was the perfect grade of spicyness though it was TOO spicy for the kids. But the adults loved it! I used 2 cans pinto beans and one can of chili beans b/c that is what I had on hand and it worked great. Go easy on the salt though b/c the longer it sits, the more the salt comes out. I made this ahead of time and let it sit in the fridge for 2 days before we ate it and it was very flavorful.

This is a good starter chili.  I did find it lacked some of the spiciness that we like in chili so I did adjust the spices a bit.  I added a light 1 tsp of oregano and 1/2 tsp of cumin.  Instead of the 28 oz of chopped tomatoes, I used a 15 oz can of stewed tomatoes and a can of tomatoes with green chilis.  I also used a 15oz can of kidney beans and a 15 oz can of pinto beans.  Made a tasty dish.

Very darn good. For me just a tweek or two.. 
First crushed tomatoes.  Instead of water, use tomato sauce. Use brown sugar and a tbsp. of Worcestershire sauce or less. Let it simmer on low and stir. Very important.

A good  base to flavor as you desire. I added less sugar and more chili powder. Also added some cumin and extra garlic, and a good amount of salt.

Perfect as written!!!  I used one can light red and 1 can dark red beans. Dark red held up better. 28oz diced tomatoes. Seasoned at end with a touch more sugar, a sprinkle of cumin (go light or omit this) and a sprinkle more chili powder.  Didn't add any water.  Simmered all day in cast iron pot on stove top.  Absolutely perfect chili.  *mixed in corn and cubed (pre-boiled) sweet potatoes when served. Yum!!

This IS a great base for tomato soup.  I added fresh tomatoes about 6 and a can of tomato sauce.

Loved it! Super quick! The prep probably took me a total of 20-25 minutes, and then after that you just dump it all in the same pot and let it go!

I actually won first prize in a work chili competition with my co-workers using this recipe. Kicked up the heat using two jalapenos and some cayenne pepper as well, but the original recipe is good, too!

It was awesome. The only thing I did was add extra chilli powder and garlic. Yummy.

Minnesota Golf Course Chili Haiku: "Really needed ... more. Salt, pepper, or cumin too. Longer simmer too." We liked the stewed tomatoes in this - big chunky hunks that were easy for my 8yo to fish out. Unfortunately, my husband and I had a few sample bites after an hour of simmering and declared it "so-so", which resulted in my adding more seasoning and allowing it to simmer for another few hrs. Prior to stirring in cumin, salt, pepper, oregano, doubled chili powder, and a pinch of cayenne pepper, the only difference that I'd made was using a frozen bagged medley of chopped celery, onions and bell pepper. What a time saver those things are! Upon serving, we liked this chili the way we like golf which is to say we putt-putt seldom, traditional golf never, and I'd rather hold a spatula or spoon over a golf club anyways.

We used honey instead of sugar, double the chili powder and some cumin.  Simmered all day; very mild, nice flavor.
