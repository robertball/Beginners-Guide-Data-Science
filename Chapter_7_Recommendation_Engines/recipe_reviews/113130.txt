My family liked this one but because I wasn't up on how to handle eggplant ie:salt and drain it first. It was more liquidy than it should have been.  Needed a little more instruction for the novice, good flavor tho.

This was absolutely wonderful.  I used fresh mashed potatoes (about 7 medium) and fresh diced tomatoes (5 medium) and left out the raisins.  Needed a fair bit of salt, and put in some Montreal chicken spice as well - phenom.

WE loved this.  My husband thought he liked it even better than regular Moussaka.  I only deviated from the recipe because he had bought "italian seasoned ground turkey" instead of regular.  It was just right.  I used the steam in bag mashed potatoes (12 oz) and it worked great.

I really enjoyed this recipe!  I love comfort foods; and since I cannot have dairy, this was a great one.  I used 1/2 pound of beef (it's all that I had) and an entire eggplant which covered a 9x13 pan fine.  I used instant potatoes and added some butter to the potatoes when finished.  The recipe says 1 hour 25 minutes til ready; but mine was ready much quicker.  I'd say all in all 50 minutes from prep to eating.  You could even do the meat base (minus the eggplant and mashed potatoes) in the AM or crock-pot and put it together at dinner.

Had an eggplant on hand and some ground beef, found this recipe (LOVE the "ingredients search" on this site!!) and threw it together.  Very tasty and will definitely make it again.  Made a few minor changes to make it easier:  1) A little less olive oil to fry the onions and garlic.  2) Add and brown the ground beef, but hold off on adding the spices and tomatoes.  3) DRAIN the ground beef to get the fat and extra oil out.  4)  In a separate bowl, stir in the spices (also add one teaspoon of cumin, as per a reviewer's suggestion) into the crushed tomatoes and, once the ground beef is drained, add it.
I did sprinkle a tiny bit of Greek Seasoning, along with sea salt and pepper, on the oiled eggplant before broiling on each side.  It all came together beautifully, but the leftovers the next day were even better!  Keeping this recipe, for sure.

I used left over turkey meat rather than ground turkey. At the last minute, I couldn't find where I put the raisins, so I left them out. I also couldn't resist adding cheese on top of the potato.
The family devoured this one!

Simple, tasty, and mild. I added fresh mozzarella between layers (moussaka is the Greek's equivalent of lasagna) and it was fabulous!

This is such a great one dish recipe!  My husband is raving and even my 18 month old daughter ate it!  We used Italian seasoned ground turkey and followed the recipe.  I also made garlic mashed potatoes instead of regular.  I did forget to add teh egg to the potatoes, but we didn't miss it.  Loved it!

I've never had regular moussaka so not sure how it was supposed to taste.  To me, not a sophisticated palate, it tasted alittle bland and greasy.  I used ground beef and ground venison (cause that's what I had on hand).  In the future, I'd brown the meat first, drain off the grease and then add to the onions/garlic as the recipe called for.  I added just a touch of hot sauce to give this alittle kick.  I served it over Chinese Cabbage, very hot, to wilt the cabbage and that is what made it good.  The cinnamon, clove and raisins make for an interesting flavor.  None of which overwhelmed the dish.  I liked it alot.

Absolutely superb! I only used 1 lb ground turkey (it's all I had) and the whole can of crushed tomatoes. I added 1 tsp cumin to the spices, and seasoned the eggplant with black pepper. I made homemade mashed potatoes for the topping (7 small-to-med Idaho potatoes), and seasoned those with garlic powder and black pepper. I baked everything in a 9 x 13 dish. It was perfect!

I would have given it a 5 it took less time. My husband who doesn't like eggplant liked this. I made my own mash potatoes. Cooked my meat separately & drained. Used 1 lb of meat & a container of bella mushrooms. I also added some salt. I soaked my eggplant with salt before using. It never got golden.

I browned and drained the meat before transferring it to a casserole dish to bake in the oven.  I also made my own mashed potatoes rather than instant, and added a layer of mozzarella cheese.  

This dish was a first for our household and it was enjoyed.  It has been added to the rotation.

Made exactly as described except that I used home-made mashed potatoes (Chef John's Perfect Mashed Potatoes recipe, from this website) instead of refrigerated.  I used the ground beef and dark raisins options.  DELICIOUS!  And I loved that I only had to use one cooking dish...  unfortunately, I decided to brown the potatoes under the broiler for 2 minutes after baking 20 minutes on the bottom oven rack, and I had it too close to the heating element so I burned the handle of my nice 12" Calphalon skillet....  live and learn.  (Broiling did brown the potatoes beautifully though!)

This was good and different, but it took a good 1 1/2 hours of non-stop kitchen preparation (made the mashed potatoes from scratch because I couldn't find the prepared ones and salted and drained the eggplant).  I am not sure that the result was worth it.  The kids were very suspicious of the eggplant, but that says more about me and them than the recipe.

Absolutely loved this! I followed others' advice and salted the eggplant for 30 minutes before following the remaining directions.  I used up some turkey burgers I had in the freezer the first time, and ground pork the second time. Both were delicious. I didn't have cloves, but allspice made a great substitute.  Well definitely make this again and again!

Delicious AND labor intensive. I would deduct one star overall for the time and effort required. Made this for my son who enjoys more exotic dishes.

I modified this a bunch, because I wanted to shorten cooking time. Not sure I succeeded, but it turned out well any way. I followed the directions for the onions, spices, meat, tomatoes. Instead of mashed potatoes, I diced red potatoes and fried them in a large skillet. When they were getting tender I added the eggplant, also diced, and a few chopped mushrooms. When all that was tender, I added the meat mixture, stirred it in, and let it combine for about 5 minutes. Pretty easy dish. Good flavors.

Great recipe just as listed, or you can a little cheese etc.  If you are in a hurry you can cube and cook the eggplant with the onions.

We liked this recipe. It was good but I may look through the other reviews for other tips for the next time as I didn't change too much. I didn't have any raisins so I left those out. I was unsure if we would like it with the cinnamon and clove but it had a good flavor. I did add a bit of salt and pepper to our taste. I made fresh mashed potatoes as I had some that needed used up. I will make this again!

I loved this!  I did double the spices, added a tsp of cumin, and salted the meat mixture liberally. I used lean ground turkey and didn't have a problem with it being too oily.  Using the refridgerated potatoes made it a dish I could put  together easily without dirtying up every pan in the kitchen.  It was nice to find a dish that had the comfort food feel of lasagna but without having to use noodles.  I'll definitely be making this again!

Wow, so good.  I just used the meat & sauce mixture that was extra from a lasagna, and leftover mashed potatoes.  This recipe fit my leftover situation perfectly, and we just loved it.  Thanks for sharing!

I tried this because we had potatoes, tomatoes and eggplant from the garden. It was okay, nothing special. Followed recipe as written except for making my own mashed potatoes and crushed tomatoes.

Delicious.  But, please use fresh mashed potatoes!  Simply delicious.  We used tomatoes from the garden (in a pasta sauce) and eggplant.  Simply terrific.

Very good! I loved an eggplant in it. Tasted almost like mushrooms. My 8-year old kids didn't appreciate it, though:) I did go through all the eggplant-bleeding process, that's not mentioned above.

Loved it...I made it vegetarian, by substituting 1 12oz package of Morningstar Farms meatless crumbles for 2 lbs of ground meat.  And, I sprinkled crumbled feta over the eggplant before topping with mashed potatoes.

Great recipe. I made it many times. Once with eggplant and once with zucchini. Once with mashed potatoes and once with white sauce. Next time I'll add some sliced almond. Wonderful recipe.

We had a ton of leftover sliced eggplant after buying more than was needed for an eggplant parm recipe so I looked around for a different eggplant recipe and landed here. To my surprise, my whole family liked it. Calling it "Eggplant Moussaka" makes it sound so exotic, but really if you like shepherd's pie this is just a different spin on the same thing. I was sure *not* to mention the golden raisins to anyone and they were a neat surprise. We'll make this again sometime.

We used turkey, omitted the raisins.  And an addtional can of diced tomatoes with basil, oregano and garlic.  Also baked this for about 45 minutes covered and 15 uncovered. Delicious!
