I wrote this recipe and the directions printed are not as I wrote them. Here they are: Remove and discard seasoning packet, if any, from beans. Place beans in large stockpot. Cover with water to 2 inches over beans and soak overnight. Drain the soaking water from the beans. Cover beans with fresh water and bring to boil. Reduce heat and simmer, uncovered, 30 minutes. Drain again, discarding water. Remove all visible fat from ham bone. Combine beans, ham bone, ham, onion, celery, carrots, tomatoes, V8, Worcestershire, mustard, chili powder, bay leaves, pepper, parsley, lemon juice, and vegetable stock in stockpot. Add chicken stock to cover beans. Bring to boil. Reduce heat, and simmer, stirring occasionally, for about 8 hours. Add remaining chicken stock to the pot throughout the day as needed to keep liquid level up. After about 8 hours, remove the ham bone, and add salt as needed. Continue simmering another 2 hours, or until beans are tender. Remove bay leaves before serving.

Very nice recipe and very easy.  Two changes I made.  I did not use stock, I used water and a ham hock instead of ham.  The soup was still very flavorful and had less fat and sodium using water instead of stock.  I also quick soak the beans by boiling them for 3 minutes and then soaking them in the hot water for 1 hour.

In the 16 yrs, I've been a mom & housewife I have stayed away from bean soup because I had a horrible experience as a kid with it ... let's say it wasn't one of mom's greatest recipes and sadly she made it all too often!
But this recipe ... Oh My ... DELISH! I will make bean soup again for sure. I was skeptic as to the igredients it called for and reviewed a few other recipes on this site as well, I followed this recipe to the letter adding some brown sugar as well and I followed suggestions from other users to add the baking soda. I used more ham then what the recipe called for only because of the memories of bean soup as a kid. Let's just say that my own children will have terrific memories of bean soup when they get older and will probably want this recipe from me when they get older. :O) Thanks so much for sharing this!!

If you like a more traditional ham and bean soup and just want it tastier and more homemade than the package directions, this is not the recipe you are after.  This is not traditional ham and bean soup.  It is very good, but I gave it two stars because of how far the base flavors stray from norm.  If you are going to change it this much it should be called "southwest style ham and bean" or something.  With the chili powder and significant tomato base, it taste a little more like chili than ham and bean soup.  I'm bummed I made this much soup with this flavor when I was in the mood for something more chicken/hammy flavored.  I make a big pot of chili when I'm in the mood for these flavors.

YUM YUM YUM!!!!  I forgot the lemon juice, and for the broth, I just used a combined total of 8 c. chicken broth to cook the beans in.  Cooked ham and beans in crockpot alone for the first 4 hours, then added the rest for the next 4 hours since we don't like our veggies real mushy.  It was PERFECT!!!!  We are huge soup eaters and I have some good and not so good bean soups, but this is probably the best!  I was a bit worried about all the tomatos and veg. juice turning this into a spaghetti like recipe, but it made a hearty stock with just a hint of tomato.  I think all the other seasonings added to it are the perfect mix.  This is absolutely a keeper!!!!!!!!

Oh my gosh this is the best ham and bean soup I've ever tasted. I couldn't find vegetable broth and so substituted water instead, and I used hot German mustard instead of Dijon since that's what I had on hand. This was the most flavorful bean soup I have ever had. You absolutely MUST try it.

This is defintely the BEST Bean and Ham soup recipe I have come across and a Great way to deal with Easter Ham leftovers. I followed the original recipe and then referred to the author's notes.  I also used a traditional smoked ham not even the sweet spiral so I left out the tsp. of salt.  Other than that, I followed the recipe to the letter and could not of been happier with it.  Thank you.

Wonderful soup.  YOU HAVE TO MAKE IT...if you like ham & bean soup.  One reviewer had added brown sugar as I used to do.  Totally unnecessary for our tastes.  Great balance of flavours - definately not 'kitchen sink soup'.  I understood that it made a lot but am now wishing I had made more.  I promised 1/2 to my nephew & wife...that was before I made it :)  There are many other recipes out there that take less time to make but I can't imagine any of them tasting quite so good.  My hats off to the chef.  Thanks for sharing!

Great soup, but it makes a HUGE pot. I read the previous reviews indicating that it was a big pot, but I didn't fully appreciate how big until I made this. I started in my slow cooker (that I think is pretty big) and had to move the soup to my largest stockpot because I ran out of room.  Since I ran out of room in the slow cooker I also ran out of time to cook it in the evening and had to cook it for a couple of hours in the evening, put it in the fridge and then finish cooking it the next day. It still turned out great! Definitely the best ham and bean soup I've made. Thank you for the recipe!

Very good indeed! I've been making bean soup for so many years now that it just comes naturally. I have no recipe to follow; I just "wing it" and know exactly what and how much to put in every time. But then I got to browsing this site and came across this recipe... I found it interesting for 2 reasons. First, the canned tomatoes, (I'd never added tomatoes to mine), and second, the Dijon mustard sounded intriguing as well. I've made this a few times now and let me tell you, the tomato and mustard flavors enhance this soup wonderfully. It has more "depth" or a "layering" of flavors. I've made it with Dijon, but also I used dry mustard once with great results. A friend of mine said this was the absolute best bean soup she'd ever tasted. I must agree!!!

My first bean soup - incredible.  To cut down on the fat I used my Aunt's technique....  make the ham broth by boiling the ham bone and water (fill water to just cover the bone) for 4 hours to create a yummy broth (I yielded so much liquid that I barely needed any chicken broth).  REFRIGERATE overnight, then skim the fat the next day.  Next day, reheat, remove the bone, strain all the bits.  This recipe called for 10 cups of broth so I used all my ham broth (@ 6 cups), the vegetable broth and then the chicken broth to make the 10 cups required.  Then follow the recipe and add all the ingredients as stated and cook the soup/stew for max 2.5 hours (assuming you soaked your beans overnight too).  This made enough for one meal and filled two large mason jars for the freezer :).

This is the absolute PERFECT ham and bean soup recipe.  I've made a few times and like some of my tweaks.  I use a 24 oz. bean mixture.  Gourmet grocery stores are the best place to find these.  Highly recommend using a ham bone from a honey baked ham.  I use 2-8 oz. packages of pre-cubed ham.  I also alter the liquid in the recipe in order to make this a slow cooker meal.  I only use 2 cups of veggie broth and 3 cups of chicken broth.  I cook on LOW in a large slow cooker for 8 hours, removing the ham bone after 6 hours.  This makes a hearty Sunday meal (complete with corn bread) and plenty of leftovers for the week.

Great Recipe.  Made it this weekend with a ham bone and meat we had left over from last week.  A couple of thoughts, leave out about half of your ham till the last hour or so to help the meat retain it's flavor.  I also took out about 3 ladels of the beans and put them in a blender, and then added back to add some additional body to the soup.  Also added about 2 cups of diced potatoes to the recipe.  Kids even loved it.

Truly one of the best soups I've ever had!  So flavorful and filling.  Also very inexspensive.  I made it with left overs, and I was able to freeze some for another day.  Definately a recipe to try!

I am rarely steered wrong by reviews here and, as such, I rarely write bad reviews. This is, however, one of those rare times.  I am completely disappointed in this recipe. To summarize: if you are looking for a traditional 'comfort food' type of Bean Soup, keep looking -- this is not it. 

This should be called "vegetable soup with beans and ham."  I guess I thought the chicken stock, at 7 cups, would be the star broth flavor as it should be and the other liquid ingredients would simply add to the medley -- NOT the case. By the time I added the vegetable stock, tomatoes and v8 juice, of which I used less than called for and substituted the rest with chicken stock, I only needed a couple of cups of chicken stock. This is very much a vegetable soup.  The ham flavor is non-existent and the beans, even though there are certainly more of them than any other vegetable, seem nothing more than a mere afterthought. 

Now, that all said...as a VEGETABLE SOUP it is ok and probably "good" if you like veg soup (I do not...I tolerate it.) It is flavorful with a hint of spiciness. Because of that, and that it was fairly easy to prepare, I gave it two stars instead of just one. 
 
Thank you for taking the time to post the recipe, and the flavor is ok for what it is (ie vegetable soup)...just was not what I was looking for.

ETA: the next day the soup was more like a stew.   I did place the rest in individual sized servings in the freezer for hubby - so thankfully, it won't go to waste.

Absolutely Fabulous Soup!!! Since I didnt have all the ingredients on hand  I had to make a few changes. It didn't seem to hurt the flavor because it turned out so delicious. 1. I used a Honey spiral Ham, which I think added great flavor. 2. I used stewed tomatoes instead of diced, and I didnt have vegetable broth or V8 juice so 3.I made homemade chicken broth made from Better than bullion and a can of 4. tomato sauce.  I also used 5. spicy brown mustard instead of Dijon and 6.omitted the salt.  This is a keeper for sure.  Thank you for this recipe...

We loved this soup!  My in laws gave me their leftover Easter ham/bone, and my husband asked me to find a soup recipe with beans.  Not being a bean lover, I had to seek one out and thankfully came across this winner.  I made it just as is, though I ended up having to add more chicken broth as the day went on.  And I have to say, again, as someone who is not a bean lover, my first taste sold me as well!  This really is a hearty, delicious soup.  And very easy, as long as you have plenty of time!  Thank you for sharing!

It was edible, and for that I give it one star. All we could taste was the worcestershire sauce and the mustard.  Like somebody took a perfectly good ham soup and poured vinegar into it.  No thanks. Never again. I make soup often and this is the first time it has ever ended badly.

I have made many soups and learned through experience, add carrots celery and excess ham in last 45 minutes of cooking so vegetables aren't mush and ham wil stay in nice chunks

The title doesn't lie.....this IS the best bean and ham soup anyone in my family ever ate. WOW! all the ingredients came together in a wonderful melange of flavors.  My only change was to only use 2 cups of the chicken stock. It was less soupy and more thick and hearty which is what we wanted. This is the definite "go to" recipe for ham bone usage. THANKS!

Amazing ham/bean soup recipe! It did make a HUGE pot full but every bit got eaten up in a few days!  I am making another pot as I type this and am looking so forward to dinner tonite! Thanks for sharing!  One tip:  I used more than one bag of the 15 beans and then after they were all cooked up, I took a good amount out and ran it through my blender before readding it to the soup. Makes a great thickening agent instead of flour! Mmmm 10 stars!!!

this soup has amazing flavor.  Give it a try.  I halved this recipe because of reviews mentioning the "vat" of soup.  All I had was dried pinto beans on hand, so I used those.  I brought them to boil for 5 minutes and then turned them off and soaked them overnight.  The next day, I just threw everything into the crockpot.  I have an extra large oval crockpot and the halved recipe filled it up.  I cooked it on low for 8 hours then pulled out the bone and man oh man. I don't know what I expected, but it was awesome.  Don't skimp on the worcheshire and dijon, both really add to the flavor of the broth. I use many recipes from websites, but have few keepers.  This is a keeper.

My family loved this recipe. I halved most of the ingredients (no celery) and made it on the crockpot. As someone else suggested,  I used 3 cups of low sodium chicken broth, 2 cups of vegetable broth, plus the vegetable juice. Since it filled my crock pot, it took about 10 hours. Next time I will double the ham. No salt was needed & only 1 bay leaf. 

It was all gone so next evening I used the same liquids and seasonings but used only chickpeas. I also added 4 links of chopped Spanish chorizo, 1 chopped smoked pork chop & 1-1/4 cup of spiral ham. I no longer had the ham bone and it still turned delicious! 

Thanks for sharing this recipe!

I followed the directions and didn't substitute anything, I made the recipe just as stated and I didn't like it at all.  My husband however loved it.  I would probably try and make the soup again but would probably leave out the Worcestershire sauce and the Dijon, to me those flavors just didn't belong with ham or beans.

This really is an excellent soup - the only change I made was replacing half of the stock with plain water, figuring the hambone would add plenty of flavor, and it did!  This soup is perfectly spicy - will make again the next time I have a hambone.  Be forewarned, this is a LOT of soup. Luckily I started with a 10 quart stockpot - this soup was at the 6 quart line before removing the hambone.

Believe the reviews ... I made this for family and friends and they went back for seconds, thirds, fourths! I followed the recipe except 1) didn't soak beans overnight - I boiled them until they got a little soft (about one hour) and 2) I cooked in the slow cooker instead of on stove.  Turned out delicious!

Really good.  Mine turned out really thick - which is fine.  Soaking the beans really helps.  Somewhat time consuming (I simmered mine ALL DAY!) but delicious.  Thanks for sharing.

This is the second time I am making this wonderful soup.  The first time I made it I ate four bowls before the day was over.  I do believe that it is the very best soup I've ever tasted.  And I made it myself!!!  I did not tweak the recipe.

Love, love, love this recipe! Worcestershire sauce and lemon juice really kick it up. Add pasta if the broth is too salty from the bone. This is not your usual ho-hum bean soup. I have to call it bean and veggie soup or my hubby expects the regular stuff.

* I usually just use navy or pinto beans.

Wait for it!  This soup does not taste "right" to me unitl it has been cooking about 7 hours.  After that it just gets better and better.  I like to substitute about 1/2 cup fresh parsley for the dried.  I added 2 med potatoes a couple of times and worked great.  Kids love it and never a drop goes to waste.

I tried this recipe for the first time. I don't usually serve something I haven't made before to company, but I did today. We all agreed it was very tasty, but the company just kept saying, ummm, a few minutes later, ummm. It was perfect for today because it's really cold and snowy outside. 

The only addition I made to the recipe was to add garlic. I had no vegetable broth, so I just used my own homemade chicken stock for both the vegetable and chicken stock. I DID do some things differently as far as how the ingredients were added. I though that cooking all the veggies from the beginning and for so long a time would result in mushy veggies. So, in order to flavor the beans, I sacrificed one stalk of celery and a carrot at the beginning and added the rest about 45 minutes before the end of the cooking time, which, by the way, did not take 8 hours. I think it was around 3-4 hours. I had soaked my beans for about a day and a half. We live at a high elevation and you just can't use shortcut methods up here. 

When I finished cooking the soup yesterday I have to admit that I wasn't thrilled with the taste. However, after sitting in the fridge all night, it was wonderful today! We like things spicy, but this was just the right amount of chili powder. It wasn't overwhelming. I'll definitely be making this again!

The dijon and worchestershre are brilliant.  Mine is not even done cooking and the broth is wonderful.  I only used on kind of bean though, great northern, all I had on hand.  I halved the recipe and it still made a good sized pot.

This is a great soup.  I have made it four times and the only change is that I use spicy V8 instead of regular.  It makes a ton and is great left over as well. 

I read some of the reviews that gave it 3 stars or less.  The only thing I can figure is they don't know how to follow a recipe correctly, don't like a lot of taste, or are afraid of some ingredients.  Some of the reviews are comical.  This is a great soup with a lot of flavors.  Give it a try.

Loved it! It a new spin on a traditional dish. Try it as is. I know people omitted stuff because it didn't sound good, but be brave. Today I am preparing to make the soup again.

Exceptional soup that bursts with flavor.  Most people ask for the recipe after having eaten a bowl.  This one you can't lose on.  Listen to the remarks about using low sodium ingrediants.  If you don't it will come out a bit too salty.

This soup is DELICIOUS!  Followed recipe with one slight exception.  The small packets of diced ham I thought I had in the freezer turned out to be diced bacon.  I used the bone from my spiral ham and two of the small packets of bacon.  I also turned the stove off after five hours because the beans were going to be nothing but mush if it cooked the entire ten hours.  But those two issues aside, this soup is just wonderful!  Very rich flavor.  This one is going to be typed up on a card and placed in the favorites notebook!

Great soup! I used a pressure cooker to make this because I only had a couple of hours before suppertime. First, I pressure cooked the soaked beans for 4 minutes (I did it in 2 batches due to the recommended capacity of my pressure cooker when cooking beans). Next, I added the rest of the ingredients  (except the chicken broth and salt) and pressure cooked again - this took 20-25 minutes under pressure, but you could vary it depending on how soft you like your beans and veggies. After it was done, I added an extra cup of vegetable stock to dilute it down a little bit. I only used half the onion and used spicy hot low sodium V8 - it made it nice and zippy! I never did add the chicken broth or the salt. Next time I might try omitting the diced tomatoes as well - they were very good, but I think it might help keep the focus on the beans and ham if they were left out. All in all, awesome soup and a versatile recipe! Thanks for sharing.

Out of this world, not your traditional ham and bean soup.  This is packed with flavor.  We sub canned canelli beans for pack beans and used all chick broth.  Give this a try, it will spark your taste buds

Very good!  Loved by all (quite a statement that my 9-year-old-hates-all-food-son even asked for seconds).  Made it just as written except for regular chicken broth from the pantry (vs. low sodium).  It was a bit salty so using the low sodium would help.  I did also add more beans.  (If I can sneak 'em into my family - I'll do it!)  It was good eats on an unexpectedly snowy winter day.

I am so impressed!  I followed the recipe as written and this was the best ham and bean soup I have ever had.  I added dumplings at the very end by dropping cut up bits of refridgerated biscuit dough in the boiling soup.  The kids insisted on this favorite ham and bean soup topping.  I will never use another recipe for Ham and Beans.  This is a FAVORITE!

Fantastic bean and ham soup!  Very well-balanced savory flavor.  Watch out for bones, though!  After such a long simmer everything really breaks down and we had a few small bone chunks that could have been mistaken for a large chunk of ham. I used one carton of unsalted chicken stock, one regular chicken stock, and one vegetable stock.  I didn't have vegetable juice or dijon mustard, but my ham had a spicy mustard glaze.

This soup has exceptional flavour. I took a chance on it; I tripled the recipe and took to a soup lunch to serve 30 people.  It got rave reviews. I will now make it for my own family quite often.

8 hours and the beans are gone.  Soup is good after 3 hours, then turn off or you will not have beans.

Oh my gosh!!! This soup was unbelievable, we all loved it and can't wait for more.  This is the grown-up version of Campbells Bean and Bacon soup - I was so surprised!  This is a real keeper.  The only change I made to the soup was I only used white beans, not the 15 bean mixture and it didn't need salt after it was cooked.  (Don't put the salt in before it cooks or you will have hard, crunchy carrots.)

it was really good.  I was disturbed to read that someone else (who posted in the review section here) claims to be the real author of this recipe.  I followed her directions which were very close to these.  The soup was very good.  I did not cook the beans for a half hour and just simmered it for several hours.  8 was way too long.  I will make it again.

The BEST bean soup recipe I've ever had, I followed the recipe as written except that I used a crock pot - thumbs up from all of our very picky family members!  The person who complained about the chili flavor was way off, this does not taste "southwestern" but, rather, has a more hearty flavor than a plain bean soup.  I honestly didn't taste the chili powder, it was not obvious at all.  The broth was full flavored & amazing!!!  I love the addition of the V8, it really made the soup!  I have made many bean soups over the years & this recipe is a keeper!

Certainly the best lima bean soup I have ever made.  Followed the recipe fairly closely but didn't add quite as much liquid as called for but it is truly a flavorful, hearty soup.  With a big pan of cornbread and butter it is a great meal.  Thank you for your recipe.

Didn't follow to the letter but, wow, the best bean soup I've ever had. Since I'm on a diet I omitted the cubed ham (did use the ham bone) and used chicken bullion instead of vegetable & chicken broth, so it is very healthy, full of protein, low in fat. Excellent!

This soup was really good!  My kids & husband did not look on it all too kindly, knowing it was "bean soup", but they all gave it a thumbs up.  I prepared it exactly as described, including BenevolentEmpress' additional notes in the review section & it turned out wonderfully.  This recipe made LOTS of soup, too.  I fed my family of 4 & have enough soup for 3 more dinners (which I froze)!  This will be my go to recipe when I have leftover ham & a hambone!

I made this pretty much as stated in the recipe with minor unremarkable changes. Very good soup that I will be making again. Because I knew this would be a large batch of soup, (and my ham bone was still frozen) I put the ham bone in the crock pot the night before. In the morning I removed the bone making more space for the rest of the ingredients.

Was rather skeptical since I'm not particularly a fan of beans or tomato based soup.  I was even more skeptical as I smelled it cooking but the end result is unbelievable.  The flavors come together and it is now one of my favorites!

My family truly enjoyed this soup. Lots of flavor w/ a bit of spice. Taste before you add salt, as V8, ham and broth gave it plenty of saltiness for us. I made this in about 4 hours without having soaked beans overnight. I'm not sure why you'd need the all-day cook time as written.

I LOVE BEANS, I LOVE HAM in BEANS too. BUT I did not care for this recipe. I made it the way it said. My husband and I are both HUGE soup eaters of all kinds and NOT PICKY eaters either. But I'm telling you we did not care for this recipe.  We don't like to waste food either, so we ate it. But man we did not care for this recipe.

Made this recipe today. Used the ham bone with abundant ham still on the bone. I thought 8 hours was a bit long to cook. I tested and thought the soup was done after about 5 hours. I did not want the carrots and celery to over-cook into soft mush.

Flavor profile is excellent, I would not change anything.

This brings bean and ham soup to a whole new level. The best ever! I didn't have any celery, so I used celery flakes. I also didn't have vegetable broth, so I added a little extra chicken broth and water. I used more chili powder than the recipe called for because I'm a real chili lover. Also added a bit of brown sugar. This is a great recipe to "tweak" to your definition of perfection!

This was wonderful! Great flavor and consistency. Just a few notes: 1) add a Tbsp of baking soda when boiling the beans for 30 minutes. This makes the beans more porous and reduces the cooking time by hours. 2) Combine the vegetable juice and spices the night before and store them in the fridge. Reduces work and the flavors combine better. 3) After bringing to a boil with seasonings, I transferred to a slow cooker on High. It was done in 8 hours.

I could give it more stars if this soup was not called bean and ham soup although it did in fact have both. You could also call it vegetable soup. Plus after so many hours of simmering I could not see one bean intact. But after all of the work and time invested I tried it and it was good. I would not serve it with corn bread as most do with "normal" ham and bean soup. I'm really not knocking the receipt or soup but I would put it in a different category. Maybe preface the receipt with "not your Mom's usual". P.S. I did not tweak the receipt and maybe most people don't serve corn bread with ham and bean soup. But anyway thanks BenevolentEmpress

Really flavorful ...delicious soup!  I added a little more ham , a larger can of diced tomatoes & didn't have an onion so I used onion powder...no other changes.  Can't stand mustard but used it anyway.....the flavors really compliment eachother.  I will make this again, for sure.

This is a great soup.  I cooked my ham bone in water and vegetable broth, enough so the bone was covered, adding 2 onions and a few stalks of celery and bay leaf for 2 hrs.  I strained the broth, then added the rest of the ingredients and some more chopped onion and celery and the beans.  I simmered until beans were done.  I added quite a bit of ham, so it will make a meal by itself.  The seasonings are what makes this so good.  Thank you for the best ham and bean soup EVER!

I tried to make in crock pot but there was too much. I didn't have a ham bone so I used 3 ham hocks. I used hot and spicy V8 juice and fire roasted tomatoes to give some heat. I used regular mustard and I added about 3 tablespoon Vegetable seasonings (dried spices).  I didn't put the salt in because I figured the chicken broth already made enough salt. This made a great ham and bean soup. It made a tangy broth. I simmered for about 6 hours and it was ready.  I have plenty for leftover lunches, I will make again

This wasn't BAD, but I would not make it again.  It was far more tomatoey than any bean soup I've ever had and certainly not what we were expecting.  Overall opinion:  tastes like watered-down barbeque sauce with chunks of meat and veggies.  Not worth the time or ingredients.

We are still raving about this soup!  It rivals a dish fit for a King.  I only had white beans and i loved how they 'popped out' of the soup. The seasonings were absolutely perfect.

Excellent hearty soup.  Not the traditional ham & bean soup.  I was afraid that the chili powder would be too much, but it was fine.  The various ingrediants give the broth a layer flavor.  I made this recipe exactly as listed and it turned out perfect. I makes A LOT of soup so be prepared to freeze some and give some away.  We'll definitely be making this one again the next time we have ham.

4.5 stars. I've never met the perfect bean/ham soup but this one is the best so far. Better than my old standby too, which was quite good. It's even better the next day! This one stays in my recipe box.

I didn't have ham so I used some leftover kielbasa sausage sliced and fried in olive oil.  It was phenomenal!!  It had a chili consistency and tasted like really good baked beans.  I would definitely recommend!

Great soup! I've never had bean and ham soup, but thought I'd try it instead of split pea. . . I made the recipe exactly as stated. It was delicious.

Best ham and bean soup I've ever had. I won't make it any differently then I did. I didn't have veg stock so I used chicken. All I had on hand but with the HUGE hambone I slowcooked for 6 hours with it before I removed it an added the carrots, onion, and celery it was awesome! I only cooked the veggies for about 2 hrs as we like them not so mushy. Excellent. Only the 3rd time I've ever tried ham and beans in my life and this one is the keeper. Oh! No tomatoes on hand so I added about 12 ounces of V8 spicy to the receipe.

I don't usually like bean soup, but this was fantastic!  For the ham bone, I used a 2-lb package of smoked pork hocks, then followed the recipe just as written.  Even my kids liked it!

Very Disappionted. The chili powder, worcestershire and mustard totally dominated the flavor of the ham, the tomatoes didnt help either. But I have to say my husband loved it.

This was really good until I added the mustard and Worcestershire sauce. The mustard flavor is very strong and disagreeable in a soup. It's also very salty, even though I used no salt added chicken broth.

Really loved this soup!  Delicious broth! Use a real large pot, make some fresh bread too and invite your friends over.  I thought there might be too many carrots but there were not.  I am going to make another batch and can it.  Thank you BenevolentEmpress for sharing this recipe!

WOW just as the name implied THE BEST - I was skeptical about the Dijon, Worcestershire Sauce and V-8 combo but 30 min. after this mixture got going in the crock pot the aroma was fantastic, you could even smell it outside ! I followed the recipe with the exception of the Chicken broth (3 cups) and Veggie broth (2 cups) as mentioned in one of the reviews for use with a slow cooker.  I used my left over Honey Baked ham and as there wasn't a whole lot of meat on it, I added some sliced Linguisa I had on hand.  I cooked it on high for 10 hours and didn't add the Linguisa till hour 9.  This soup was incredible I look forward to making it often. Next time I will add an additional cup of chicken broth and will keep the sausage as well as the ham.

This was a wonderful hearty soup. The flavors reminded me of my mother's lentil soup growing up. More of a vegetable base than a creamy base. I think I will try lentils instead of the bean mix next time. Definitely a keeper!!

I can't say how this compares to a traditional ham and bean soup, since I've never had one, but I'm definitely with those who say it's wonderful.  I generally make a yellow split pea soup with a ham bone, but kept  forgetting to buy the peas, so entered "ham" and "beans" on the search engine and came up with this.  I thought I had all the ingredients - I used a combination of pinto, kidney, black and navy beans, and black eyed peas - but only found  out after I started to make it that someone ate the last of the celery as a snack while we were stuffing the turkey.  However, I had already started so went with what I had.  I added 1/2 tsp celery salt about half way through, together with the garlic and ginger recommended by others, and another 1/2 tsp of celery salt when I took out the ham bone.  I used unsalted turkey broth instead of chicken (it being Christmas) and there was no salt in the veggie broth, so the salt was not an issue.  I was concerned about the ginger, but can't taste it at all - the flavours blend together beautifully.  Those who think it tastes good after 4 or 5 hours really should try waiting the full time recommended - the flavour really doesn't really develop until about hour 8, and keeps getting better from there.  Thank you for the recipe.  It's definitely a keeper.

So, I suppose I shouldn't be rating this just yet as it's currently on the stove. At any rate, I made this years back as written and was less than impressed. It tasted like straight up chili, only it wasn't chili so it was just strange. Ff a few years and I'm giving it another go because it really SEEMS like something I'd like, a lot. This time I've used all of the flavorants except for the chili powder. Left it out completely. I may sub in some hungarian paprika later but I'm not sure. I'll review again after it's all done. Oh, I also just used water instead of broth.

This had a wonderful flavor.  I made this pretty much as written, but did try a couple of the suggestions other reviewers had made.  I did add 1 tbsp baking soda to the beans when cooking them for 30 minutes.  Be aware that this caused the beans to cook down really fast and I pretty much ended up with a pot of bean puree. I couldn't drain the cooking water off as the recipe calls for because they were so thick! The overall flavor was wonderful, spices were a perfect, and the soup ended up very thick and hearty. I cooked my ham bone separately, skimmed off the fat and used that broth instead of the chicken broth.  I also eventually added a couple of cans of beans to go with my "puree", and next time I may try it again without adding the baking soda to see how that turns out.  I was able to freeze the extras up and look forward to having this frequently in future!

Very good the best I've had.  I modified the dish by using nine cups of chicken broth through out the day and 1 1/2 T. Of gumbo file as a flavor enhancement and thickening agent.  The result was more consistent with a strew.

This is the first time I have ever made soup.  Easy.  I always loved my mother-in-law's bean and ham soup but unfortunately, she did not have a recipe and passed away 2 years ago.  I tried this and it is very close to hers.  My husband thinks so too.  Thank you for sharing your recipe online.

This was BY FAR the best ham and beans I've ever had. At my 91 year old mothers insistence, I added a few slices of bacon. I had to skim some fat when it was done, but the bacon added just enough salt that I didn't need to add any extra. I'll be using this recipe from now on!

I was really pleased with how this soup turned out! I did a few things differently ( just for the sake of using what I had).  Instead of using a 14 oz can of diced tomatoes and 12 oz of vegetable juice, I just used a 28 oz can of diced tomatoes including the juice in the can. I substituted soy sauce for the Worcestershire. Finally, I used pork butt which included a bone and then a big hunk of ham ( courtesy of my boyfriend's mom:) chopping it up after it had defrosted in the soup for a couple of hours. I didn't read ahead and realize the soup had to cook for 8 hours, plus . So I ended up cooking it for about 4, putting it outside in the snow for about an hour (not my idea) to cool down, the putting it in the fridge. We pulled it out the next night, simmered it for another 3 hours or so, and then had a great meal. Next time, I'll use the crock pot. Not just for the time, but for the volume too...... My soup pot was filled to the brim and I didn't use at least half of the chicken broth because of that. Thanks for a great receipe!

A very hearty and tasty recipe, especially liked the addition of the vegetables,it added depth to the taste. My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed it; and he is not usually gun-ho on a bean soup. I did add some garlic, just because I'm a big fanatic. But also added some fresh ginger because I heard that it helps with the gas that beans usually bring on. It seems to have helped a great deal, ha ha.

AMAZING bean soup! If you actually like bland, plain, ham and bean soup...this recipe isn't for you! This has so much depth of flavor! Yum! Make sure you actually do cook it for 8 hours+, as it becomes a whole different soup when it simmers. The flavors blend beautifully, and you can actually pick out the taste the ham, bean and flavorful broth. Yum!
I am a soup lover, and this one's a keeper!

For those of you that don't know, all of the spiral ham shoppes sell nice big ham bones with lots of meat, so it is easy to make this soup even when you don't want to cook a ham! In my area, they cost about $7 - and are meaty enough to make a couple sandwiches, and this soup!

This  is a great base soup.  If you are a new cook, make it as is, and then adjust as needed on the 2nd go around.  If you need it to be more convenient (as I do) then try this...in a LARGE crockpot, mix 4 cups chicken broth, your veggie JUICE, the canned tomato + their juice, plus the Worch Sauce, mustard, S&P, and lemon juice.  Add other spices as desired. Reserve about 2 cups chopped ham, add the remainder with the bone to your broth.  You should have enough broth to cover the bone, if not, add more broth or water.  Cook on HIGH for 3- 4 hours, then reduce to low.  Add  (2) 14oz cans of Veg-All, and (3) 14oz cans of whatever beans you like. (I use Lima, chili, and Northern for a good mix of taste and color. RINSING canned foods well before using them will reduce saltiness and salt intake)  Cook on LOW for 3 to 4 hours, and it is ready to serve.  As good as fresh - maybe not, but much better than a night of fast food!  Great to do on a weekend - add a pan of cornbread and you have a great meal.

This is my new "go-to" recipe for 15 bean soup.  MUCH better than any other recipe that I've tried.  I prepared the beans as directed in Benevolent Empress's review (soak, drain, boil x 30 min, drain) then added the other ingredients and cooked on stovetop.  I stopped cooking at 2 hours since I like it with beans and veggies not completely mushy.  Would be fine to cook longer but not 10 hours in my opinion.  Great flavor.  I used an entire box of veggie stock and did not need to add more liquid.  Thanks for a great recipe! Note: did not have V8 juice but had a small tomato juice and half can tomato paste that I threw in.

I made half this recipe in my slow cooker, using the full can of diced tomatoes.  I used all chicken broth, totaling just over five cups.  A reviewer suggested adding the veggies after the first four hours so they wouldn’t get mushie.  Well, that sounded like a good idea, but it didn’t work for me.  After four hours of cooking, they were still too crunchy and even after two additional hours they weren’t done.  In hindsight, I should have put them in at the beginning.   Well, I ran out of time, so we ate this with somewhat crunchy veggies.  I froze the leftovers, but intend to simmer it further to finish cooking the veggies.  The flavor of this is good, but I thought it really needed more beans.  After all it is a bean soup!  If I make this again, I would make half the recipe again, but use the entire bag of beans rather than just half.  Note to self: I removed the ham bone after six hours.

I follwed the recipe as far as ingredients went. This soup was devoured by my family. Even the anti bean ones! I used the de-gassing suggestion from another review and was thrilled there were no "after affects" from the beans. The flavor is worthe the work...absolutly delicous! Thansk for posting.

This is very good. I did not deviate much from the original recipe, just altered the amount of spices to my own taste.  It does take some time to get it going, but once it's simmering, there's not much to do but stir and wait as your home is filled with the aroma.

Delish! Didn't have the ham hock and only used homemade vegetable stock and thyme for depth. Omitted the tomatoes and added shredded Swiss chard at the end. The soup was so creamy and soothing.

This recipe will shatter your bland bean soup memories.  FULL of flavor & not mushy.  I didn't have much ham so I substituted some smoked pork loin and Itallian sausage diced up for the ham.  I DID use a ham bone though.  Thanks for the amazing recipe!

Outstanding texture & flavor. Made my soup in a 2 day-2 step way. 1st day simmered ham bone all day covered w/ water. Placed in fridge overnight then skimmed off fat the following day. Used this in place of the vegetable broth.Used 2 1/2 lbs of 7 beans mix. Pre soaked beans in boiled water for 1 hr. drained,rinsed & drained again. Used 2 cans of stewed tomatoes,1- 15 oz can tomato sauce & 3- 12 oz cans of chicken broth,also 2 teas of chicken boullion w/ 2 add'l cups of water.. used the worcestershire & Jack Daniels Hickory smoked Mustard, plus all the stated spices and lemon juice. Used the stated vege's & added cut asparagus stalks. Left out the kosher salt..was not needed. Added in add'l ham pieces the last hour. Cooked slowly under low heat for 6 hrs. Fantastic flavor....Made enough to fill 5 containers.

This is a very straightforward and delicious recipe.  We all love it, and eat it often.  Thank you to the poster for sharing!  I put my ham bone in a "soup sock" or some cheese cloth before simmering.  I only made the mistake once of not doing so and had small bone pieces in my soup.  Still yum, though!

excellent soup. i cooked ham hocks in chicken broth til meat fell of bones. used a 4qt crockpot for the ham hocks. rest in a 7 quart crockpot. after ham hocks done i combined the 2 crockpots to a large stockpot and brought to boil. then returned to the 7 qt and 4 qt crockpots to finish cooking. the only thing i changed to this recipe was i added 2 cloves of minched garlic. the longer i cook it the better. really good the next day.

I've never made bean soup before but my husband asked me to make some with the leftover Christmas ham and bone.   I followed this recipe pretty close (except the celery b/c I was out) and I only had 4 hours to make and cook, so I took my chances.   It turned out fantastic.  My husband said this was the absolute BEST soup he's ever had.  My southern parents were skeptical since it was different then what they were used to but they were both surprised as well.  They kept commenting how wonderful this was.

I had leftover ham from Christmas.  My husband suggested bean and ham soup and this recipe had simple ingredients I had on hand.  Definitely make sure the fat is trimmed.  Only one substitution: I didn't have V8 juice so I just bloody mary mix.  Like everyone else says, it makes a big pot of soup but very good.  Great for a rainy day.

I can't even describe how good this soup is.  The mustard, chili powder, worcestershire, and lemon gives this soup a distinctive taste that leaves you wondering just what made it so good.  They all just blended in together without any one ingredient being over powering.  You will never go wrong making that his soup.  Rave reviews whenever and wherever I take it, and I don't change a thing, unless I'm out of an ingredient. Last time had to sub taco mix for chili powder, no noticeable change in taste.  I cry to think of all the ham bones that are thrown out that could have been turned into this great soup
P.S.  If you like a thicker soup, use masher or immersion blender.

Very good. I did this in a 5 qt crockpot. Basically made it as written except I didn't add Chili Powder, not a fan of it. After I added 3 cans of Vegetable broth there was no room to add the Chicken broth so that was eliminated. I let it cook on Low for about 8 hours.  I did soak the beans first over the stove but not overnight. Will make this again.

One suggstion, if you are using smoked or cured ham, do not add salt to this recipe. I made this with the ham bone and left over ham from Easter 2010. EXCELLENT!!! I will freeze some for later as I am only cooking for myself and my husband. I bet he will be taking some to work for lunch. Note: after it simmers for about 4 hours, it is easy to take out the bone and cut up the ham to add back in. Awesome recipe!

This was really great! I made a few changes. I used spicy brown mustard instead of Dijon. After I added all the ingredients, I boiled the soup for about twenty minutes and then left it to simmer for four hours--rather than ten, as we didn't have time.  It turned out SPLENDID!   I can't think of any changes I would make to the flavor.

Great recipe, great soup -- a little salty for my taste, but I didn't add any extra salt, so I guess it was the ham.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe, and used low sodium broths.  The family really enjoyed it served with fresh bread!

Wow.  One of my favorite meals of all time, and so cheap for how much it makes.  I can't believe how good it tastes.

I have never been a fan of the old ham and beans soups, but hubby requested it.  This was great! I just kept sampling it.  We have a young family, but had it polished off in a couple days-none left to freeze!

IMPORTANT, please read the original recipe writer - Benevolent Empress’s follow up "review" dated Mar. 24, 2008 for her comments about the recipe as shown not being as she wrote it.  Myself, following both her recipe and her follow up review, I made this slowly over two days on a winter weekend. I used the bones, meat and all from a picnic ham of a previous day’s diner that was kept frozen until just the right weekend. I was not sure about the use of tomato products in my bean soup; I used V-8 juice as the vegetable juice called for.   This soup is flavorful, aromatic and delicious. I froze five quarts and will look forward to every one of them. If I was to use (and will use) a previously cooked picnic ham again I would not put the lean meat trimmings in the soup pot until the last two hours or so. I had put the meat in at the beginning and it broke up more than should be.  Also, as large a batch this makes I too would use more beans. Maybe two packages... But I like beans and it is a BEAN soup. Take the time and love making this soup per the recipe as it is – “The Best”, not like your Mama's bean and ham soup, but way better.

Oh my - so good! I was snowed in today and made this with the bone from Monday night's ham. I didn't have everything the recipes called for and couldn't go out to get it because of the snow and ice, but it was wonderful to have it cooking all day and it made a fantastic, filling dinner - we both loved it!

I've made this recipe many times.....it is fantastic.  I always rate every recipe I make and NEVER make it again unless I rate something GREAT.  I use uncooked ham on the bone so lots of meat.  Make sure to make a BIG pot as it freezes great and is a big hit with everyone.

I have made several ham and bean soup recipes, but this one is the best.  My family loved it.  I did make it with water instead of stock so the sodium content was fine.

Rave reviews from a family of 6. No one complained, we all loved it. We followed the updated recipe with the exception of extra ham. We have never made this type of soup before, but you can bet we will make this one a repeat offense. This soup definately has a WOW factor.

This soup really is the best bean and ham soup I've ever had. Rich, hearty and full of taste! I couldn't find a ham bone at my grocer's and didn't feel like driving to my butcher so I used two large ham hocks and cut a large piece of black forest ham into chunks. I also used low sodium broth, juice and tomatoes. This soup is so flavorful you really don't need all that extra salt. Thanks for the recipe, and I can't wait to try it with a ham bone :)

Fantastic, I love it and also tweaked it.

1. I doubled this recipe.  I had a large ham bone and ended up with 11 pounds of ham that I had to dice.

2. I cooked my soup for 24 hours.  The first eight uncovered, the last 16 covered.  It took eight hours just to be able to bend the ham so I could cover it. :-)

3. I left the bone in about 20 hours.

4. I used a 20qt. stock pot

If you don't like this soup then you don't like ham and bean soup because it doesn't get any better than this! I followed the recipe exactly using my crock pot and it was fantastic. I didn't need extra liquid as it cooked, maybe because of using the crock pot, i don't know. Didn't need any salt as the ham was plenty salty. It makes alot but thats good. I'm a big fan of leftovers. Thank you for sharing this great soup recipe

I make 5 gallons of soup one Friday every other month for my town's "Community Kitchen" where we feed anyone who wants to come.  This past month I was looking for a bean soup recipe to use a frozen ham bone but I wanted something a little more jazzy than the typical bean and ham soup.  THis recipe was delicious and everyone who ate it loved it.  It was hearty, rich, and... JAZZY.  The dijon mustard and chili powder give it just the right kick (but it's not too spicy hot).  Instead of the bag of mixed beans, I used 5 bags of different beans.  You can do that when you're making 5 gallons of soup!!  It was wonderful.  Thanks for the recipe!

I made this soup according to the recipe, with my ham bone. we thought it tasted like a "chili wanna be". It has a tomato base and tasted like chili, except for the ham. We didn't like it.

Wow!  This is amazing.  It is a perfect blend of spices, broth and vegetable juice.  Given that, I would imagine that you could add any combination of meats and vegetables.  I threw in some wild pheasant and wild duck and it tasted just great.  I will be making this again!

I am letting this recipe simmer now.  I had to write because you should not use kosher salt with any pork / ham products.  kosher means it has been blessed by a rabbi and is considered clean in tradition with Jewish law.  Please substitute sea salt .

I have been making soup for 30 plus years and this is, by far. the best I have ever made. As others, I soaked the beans overnight. I omitted the chili powder (personal choice)--cannot understand why its not a 5 star recipe.

Really, really good! I followed the recipe pretty closely. Did not add the can of diced tomatoes for fear it would be too tomatoey. I simmered the beans alone for a half hour before adding the veggies and dry spices. I avoided adding anything that would have salt in it because I was worried about the beans not cooking. Did not add vegetable broth because I figured the veggies would make their own broth. After about 4 hours, the beans were nice and soft, so I added everything else. My ham had a glaze so I added that liquid as well. Loved the tang that comes from the chili powder and lemon juice. Healthy comfort food!

FANTASTIC!! I live in a home filled with males, whom detests any type of soup! However, I was wanting bean soup and since I do the cooking, we had bean soup. This is by far the BEST soup we have ever had!! ALL the boys / men in the house asked for seconds and no one complained with the leftovers the next day. It was actually said the soup tasted better the second day!! I did cut back on the broth to make a "less soup" effect and used Italian sausage because I didn't have any ham or ham bone. This is definitely a keeper!!

This came out SO good and there is a lot of it. To avoid some of the fat I boiled the ham bone and hock for a couple of hours, cooled the broth, skimmed the fat and strained the remaining pieces. I used that broth in place of the vegetable and chicken broths. Instead I added one large Tbsp each of low sodium vegetable and chicken base. Everything else remained the same as the recipe as posted. It does have a nice touch of heat to it. Yummmmmmm

My husband is NOT a bean soup lover, but he said he LIKED this one! College-age daughter enjoyed it, too! Didn't have time to wait for the slow cooker method. Brought beans to boil for 2 min, then soaked for 1+ hr. Then, added new water (2" above beans) and simmered beans for 2 hr, checking for tenderness. Then, kept bean cooking stock, so omitted chicken and vegetable stocks. Added the seasonings, omitting salt altogether. Included some frozen cut corn and chunks of orange and yellow mini bell peppers (on special after Christmas) along with other veggies. Snipped some fresh parsley from the garden, too :) Didn't have tomato veg. juice, so stirred in some tomato paste. My method would be lower in sodium, though not LOW sodium, as I did use our Christmas ham bone (from our freezer) and some ham chunks.

I have been making this bean soup for several years every new years day with left over Christmas ham with RAVE reviews.  I follow the recipe exactly.  There are many levels of flavor with this soup as they hit your tongue at different times.  At one time I had out of town company and the older teenage boys ate several bowls.  I look forward to making every year.  Thanks for BenevolentEmpress for sharing your delicious recipe.

I wanted to make a ham and bean soup with my left over ham and bone from Christmas.  I tried this recipe, but I used 2 cans of navy beans, rinsed and drained, since that is what I had in the pantry and cooked it in the crock pot.  You will need to use a very large crock pot, because this makes a lot of soup.  It definitely was one of the best ham and bean soup recipes I have made. Yum!

I gave this 5*'s even though I haven't made this yet but I had a question I hope someone can answer. The directions read to cook the beans for 8 hrs. & then for another 2 hrs.- can this be right? With soaking 8 hrs & cooking for 10....well that just seems excessive to me but I do want to get it right! Any feedback would be greatly appreciated!

We had this recipe last night, and it was AWESOME! And I have never been a fan of beans in anything. Can't wait for the leftovers! Did it to the recipe, and for our tastes, we would not change a thing!

This is definitely not your Grandma's bean soup...what a nice change! I couldn't stay home for the day, so I used my largest slow cooker...and I knew that everything would not fit. I cooked the beans on the stove for 2 hours, drained and put into the pot. I cut back on the carrots and the ham (my ham bone was very meaty anyhow) and the broth. I filled the pot with all of the spices, celery, onion, tomato, etc. just as listed and filled it to the top with chicken broth and let is cook on low for 10 hours. I took out the bone and added in about 2 cups of water and let it cook on high for about an hour. I used my submersible blender and whipped up some of the beans, but left it so it was still chunky and was just how we like it as far as thickness. EXCELLENT flavor!! Will definitely make this again.

I don't know what happened, but this did not turn out at all for us. The beans were mushy, and the soups was a think, soggy mess. We choked some down for dinner.  Will try a different recipe next time.

This is a great soup that can be adapted to whatever you have on hand.  It had just enough heat (from the chili powder) to make my husband happy, but it wasn't too spicy for my less-tolerant taste buds.  I only made a few changes out of necessity- we didn't have vegetable juice, but I had a small can (10 oz maybe) of diced tomatoes with onions and chilies that I used instead.  I also didn't have any vegetable broth, so I used all regular chicken broth.  Next time (yes, there will be a next time), I probably won't add the salt or I will make sure that I use low-sodium broth like the recipe states.

Very Good!!  I we had lots of spiral cut glazed ham leftover after Easter do I just used that to make this soup.  I used water instead of the veggie stock, all 7 cups of chicken stock then just kept the liquid level up by adding water as needed.  I only cooked mine for 8 hours total and that was MORE than enough.  10 hours is total over kill in my book.  flavors were great and i will definitely make this again!

Great recipe. Being from Texas, I had to experiment a bit by adding a smoked Jalapeno (finely minced)and two Tbsp of adobe sauce. Wow! Also, I tripled the amount of beans in the recipe and adjusted the veggies, spices, and stock accordingly. Served it with hot sauce and avocado slices on top because my three sons came in from Austin and are lovers of spicy food. BTW........this soup is better when refrigerated overnight and reheated and served the next day. Great basic recipe!

I made ham and bean soup, using this recipe as a base. Changed some ingredients according to what I had - used sea salt instead of kosher salt, salt-free seasoning blend instead of the individual spices here. No lemon juice, added a celery stalk & bay leaf, and 4 small golden potatoes. Added up to 8 cans of low sodium chicken broth. It was delicious, and the person I made it for was very pleased!

I usually follow recipes perfectly the first time around but I just didn't feel comfortable doing that this time around. In place of the vegetable juice and broth I used water and I only ended up needing 2 cups of chicken broth. It also did not take 8-10 hours for it to cook. At 5-5 1/2 hours the beans and veggies were tender. I'll definitely make again but I'll stick with my version. I think after 10 hours you'd have much IMO.

This was great!  I took a huge batch to work on a snowy day and everyone praised the cook and the recipe!  (Plus we didn't have to leave for lunch).  I didn't have vegetable juice so I just skipped it. But I plan on getting some small cans of V8 to keep on hand - just for the occasion.  I don't know what the lemon juice does - and I questionned the Dijon mustard - but wowwie - it was smack dabbin good!

It should be called, Veggie soup with Beans and Ham.  If you want the "Ham and Pea soup" kind of soup texture, look elsewhere.  This one is a lot like minestrone.  I incorporated a few reviewers' recommendations. (1) used slow cooker (2) cooked 1st 4 hours with just ham bone and beans (2) then added veggies and seasonings the next 4 hours (3) added ton of garlic (4) only used water, no broth (5) did NOT add salt - ham was salty enough.  (6) did NOT add V8 in fear of tasting too much like V8 juice which my kids will not touch.  After it was all done, I added condensed chicken broth ("Better than Bouillon") to taste.  When I first added all of the seasonings and tasted it, it tasted horrible; too vinegary.  I almost regretted that I tried the recipe.  Then I thought perhaps it needed to balance off with some sweetness, so I added all of the dripped over glaze from the ham and some more ham (not all).  It still tasted weird but I walked away and let it cook.  After 4 hours of cooking in the slow cooker, it was an entirely different dish!  It tasted so good! yum yum yum.  So those of you out there who thought it tasted too much like vinegar, I suggest that you add some glaze (or brown sugar/syrup) and let it cook a LOOOOOng time.  Also, for those who thought it smelled funny,  did you prep the beans?  Read BenevolentEmpress' additional notes on how to prep the beans.  It's a 'MUST DO' step!!

My husband loved this.. was very hearty. I had some 12 bean dried soup beans and a poor quality ham that I had won.. hah.. so put the ham on the smoker then diced it up. I pressure cooked the beans and then added can of tomato basil soup (instead of the tomatoes) and 1 can white shoepeg corn and no chicken stock just water. I think I would use less mustard and worcheshire sauce. The pressure cooker helped to speed up the process and make the stock thicker. Also added a few brussel sprouts and leftover lima beans.. I think you could put just abt anything in there!! I think this would be good the second day and would freeze good as well. would prob make again.

I was hesitant to try a bean soup with so many ingredients (as I've always loved ham & bean soup), but this raises the bar SO high.... Truly a fantastic Bean & Ham soup.... I add some garlic, and use Trader Joe's Apple Smoked bacon in lieu of ham...lending it a rich, smokey flavor.  (Be sure to cut of much of the fat, or you'll be skimming it at the end!). 
Scrumptious!

So great!  I ended up using a 2 ham hocks, and had to sub a little soy sauce for the worcestershire sauce, and a little celery seed for the celery.  It was absolutely luscious.  Will be happy to try again with the correct ingredients!

This soup is amazing!  There is way more flavor than most other bean and ham soups.  The chili powder combination really adds to it.  I actually made mine in two crockpots instead of on the stove.  I still boiled the beans first and I did not use a ham bone.  My boyfriend and kids are very picky eaters and they devoured it too.

This was one of the easiest recipes for soup I have ever made.  I decided to put mine in a crock pot so that it could cook all those hours while I was at work.  My kids were not too sure about it due to the way the crock pot was smelling (think it's the chemicals on the outside of the pot) but everyone agreed that it was the best soup they have ever tasted. I will definitely make it again, but I may try to limit the # of broth cans and use more water instead.

My entire family loved this soup!  It was quite different from traditional ham and beans and gets even better with time.  Didn't know what to do with the spice packet from the package of 15-bean soup, though!  Was it supposed to go in this recipe?

We thought it was a really delicious soup, we didn't think it tasted like chili as others have posted.  I made it almost exactly as written, the ingredients I matched except for the amount of chicken broth, but that is because I had to put it in a crock pot because I was not going to be home (can't leave a stove burning when your not home). So, it did not evaporate as it would have in a pot on the stove. I personally would add some a little bit of cumin just to add to the flavors and make it more of a chili flavor, just my preference. I will make again, with a little bit of adjustment to my taste.

I had a leftoer ham bone and used this recipe to make soup.  My husband loved it.  I like it.  If you like the flavor of baked beans, you will probably enjoy this recipe.  This is a salty soup so if you are waching it, you may want to substitute water for broth. Still good.  Thanks for the recipe!

I made this vegetarian with veggie broth and bacon.  Meat and non-meat eaters enjoyed. The dijon/worcestershire sauce adds a nice savory flavor.  I also used tomato sauce instead of diced. Will definitely make again.

Good hearty soup, but too much chili powder for my family. Maybe because I used the ham bone from the spiral ham, that was glazed.. it tasted too salty and too heavy on the seasonings. Next time I will reduce the chili powder by half, but I will try again :) We are going to try it over rice for lunch today.

adapted recipe for 6 qt crock pot --- simply eliminated chickent stock/broth, and one less bay leaf.  Did not add the kosher salt.  A good way to use up leftover christmas ham.  Set crock pot to low for 9 hours.

This was the best chili I have ever tasted.  I made this for my family yesterday with the leftover ham bone/ham from Thanksgiving dinner.  I had nothing but rave reviews.    I did make some changes, of course.  First of all, I bypassed the dry bean soak by using four cans of beans (kidney, chili beans, white beans and pintos.)  I then substituted the vegetable juice for a can of tomato paste.  I added a teaspoon of ground cumin.  And I didn't put carrots in it because I didn't have any.  I cooked it about six hours.  Because the beans were canned, I didn't use nearly the amount of chicken stock called for.    The recipe yielded 10 servings.  My family LOVED it.  I will definitely be making this again!

I made this after Easter with the leftover ham and ham bone, and oh my, was it delicious!! It made so much that I shared it with 3 other families. I let it cook all day on a very low simmer, and that last hour or two it magically thickened to just the perfect consistency. I can't wait to have a ham again just so I can make this soup!

So, I soaked the beans overnight and then put them on stove to cook for 30 minutes and rinse AND got on my treadmill.  Long story short, did not put enough water in and you guessed it, they burnt!!!  Oi.  So, I used five cans of assorted beans, drained and rinsed and added a can of corn.  Did the rest of the recipe the same and it is SO SO SO AMAZING!!!!  Wow! Great flavor.  Will do this with leftovers from Christmas Ham, too!

This soup was outstanding! I didn't have the 15 bean mixture, so just opened 4 cans of beans I happened to have on hand. I also didn't need to add the chicken bullion to the last two cups of water - it was salty enough. Definitely a keeper!

This soup was great, and I am not a big ham soup fan.  My favorite part was that it was a broth based soup and the addition of the vegetable juice and diced tomatoes.  All we had were canned beans, so we added them at the end so they did not get mushy.  As other reviewers suggested, we didn't add the salt; we even used low sodium broth tomatoes and it was still plenty salty (almost to much for my taste, but still good flavor).  Great way to use leftover ham and bone!

This soup was surprisingly good.    Even though I'm not a big bean fan I still enjoyed it.     I followed the recipe with one exception, I used 1/2 chicken stock and 1/2 water and this cut down on the saltiness.    Definitely worth a try if you have a leftover ham bone.

Wonderful soup.  I usually make a navy bean soup with the leftover ham, and it's pretty good.  But simple.   This has a much more complex flavor that is just delicious.   I used the navy beans instead of the 15 bean mixture - because it's what I had.  Came out great.  The larger navy beans took about 8 hours to fully soften up.  I also added the cubed ham four hours into the cooking - otherwise they tend to fall apart.

This was awesome!  Some changes I made: A sprinkle of Chili powder was enough for us, I didn't have a ham bone but the ham and vegetables made a nice stock by themselves, my bf picked up the regular V8 so I halved the salt in the recipe, and used homemade chicken broth with no salt. Also, completely forgot the worchestershire! I used 2 cups of dried navy beans and boiled them for an hour in 7 cups of water before starting the rest of the soup. I really enjoyed this!

This was delicious just as written. Haven't made many other versions but this was a good mix of flavors and made a lit of soup.

Great soup!  I don't know if it's the best out there, but it's very good.  I had a very small ham bone with little meat on it from a quarter ham, so added some Penzey's Ham Base for added flavor. Also didn't have any parsley so used chervil instead--worked fine.  I didn't need to cook it as long (would have, but hubby got into the pot after 6 hours and declared it yummy, so we stopped there. I was afraid the beans would disintegrate).  The reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is that I thought it was a little too sweet.  Won't prevent me from making it again, though.

This was very tasty the first time I had it. I froze the leftovers.  When I defrosted and reheated, I wanted to add a can of corn in with it.  By mistake, I grabbed a can of mexi-corn.  It was a perfect addition!  I will add that from the start from now on.  Thanks for sharing!

Wow, this is awesome! I made up a big pot with our Easter hambone, and froze it immediately in serving size portions - I finally thawed some out to enjoy... the flavors are really fantastic, very nice hearty soup!

Takes a while to make, however it is really tasty.  The beans hold together better than expected.  I added 2 tablespoons of minced garlic after the first tasting--we're just garlic lovers.  Great healthy fare to feed a hungry crowd.

This was better than I expected even though it had good reviews. I was worried it would be too tomato tasting but it wasn't.  The flavor was great and it did make a ton.  It was a little too spicy for my kids though so next time I will have to alter the spices so that they can enjoy it with us.

The recipe name says it all.  This is the best Bean and Ham Soup.  It was great day one, but warmed up well (seemed to get better everyday).  We made a couple of modifications to the recipe.  1) We did not have vegteable broth so we substituted a package of dry vegtable soup mix and three cups of water 2) We used a can of diced tomatoes with jalapenos as opposed to plain 3) We added about a teaspoon of ground cumin 4) Lastly we added a few dashes of hot sause

Amazingly Good! 10 Stars! I made half of this recipe. I made it as written except I didn't have veggie juice so I increased the veggie broth and the diced tomatoes. This soup doesn't need over 8 hours to cook! It was perfect after 4 hours! I served this with the "Excellent and Healthy Cornbread" recipe from this site. I will use this soup recipe from now on!

This was perfect!  We ate it on a snowy Sunday using our leftover Christmas Ham.  It smelled so heavenly we had to dig into it after it had only cooked for 6 and a half hours.  It was still delicious!

I'm not riding everyone else's coattails by giving this a 5 star rating.  It really is the best bean soup we have ever tasted.  It's rich, tangy, sweet, and savory all at once.  I made a total pig out of myself because I just couldn't stop eating it!!  Mine may have been slightly sweet because I used leftover honey-glazed sprial ham.  Still, it was awesome.

I would have liked to do it in a crock pot but it wouldn't all fit in my 4 quart model.  I had all I could do to get everything in an 8 quart stock pot.  Next time I'll have an 8 quart crock pot so I can "set it and forget it" while I'm at work.

If you have a leftover ham bone, you really need to try this recipe!

SOOOO good.  The only thing I changed was we didn't have any low sodium V8.  So we used normal V8 and did NOT add any salt as it called for in the directions.  We also served this over rice.

This is the best bean & ham soup I have ever eaten.  It was a very easy recipe to make too.  The recipe says to use broth but the post made by the person who wrote the recipe says to use stock so I used Vegetable broth and Chicken Stock.  It turned out very well.

I don't like ham but my aunt gave me the leftover ham and bone from Christmas dinner. I found this recipe, made it and everyone loved it!  I did not have vegetable juice so I used a half can of tomato paste and extra water. A very delicious soup that smells good all day long.

Delicious! I only had canned pinto and plack beans, so I washed them and and they worked just fine. I also added a large potato. I cooked the onions, carrots and celery with olive oil and a piece of bacon and then pulled the bacon out when the onions were fully cooked. I then deglazed the pot with beer. Once that was out of the way, I followed the reciped to the letter. I put leftover Christmas ham to use! Thanks for the recipe -- I will use this one again and again!

YUMMY!!  I made this soup 2 days ago as I had some ham and a bone to use from a Christmas ham.  I froze half as it makes a big batch.  
I followed the directions by the author as explained in her updated listing from March '08.  The only change I made was to use 4 cups of vegetable broth (it was a 4 cup carton and didn't want to waste) and a 4 cup carton of chicken broth.  No salt was needed.
Tonight we are snowed in and I heated it up and served it with corn bread.  My vegetable avoiding 15 year old son really liked it (a huge compliment!) and so did the rest of us.  It was so good!!
Next time I may follow the directions up until the first cooking of the beans and then try it in my crock pot as, otherwise, you need to be home all day to watch it.  This is well worth it, though, if there is a day you'll be home uninterrupted.  This will be a new must have for us.
Thanks!

Wow, turned out great!  I had my beans somewhat cooked before starting the soup, and it only took about 5 hours for my soup to be done.  I left the bone in the entire time.  Will definitely make again.  I even canned some so I can enjoy later!

I thought this was pretty good.  I followed the author's original recipe with the exception of adding chili powder (i've got really picky kids who can't stand any heat).  One kid loved it and everyone else thought it was okay.  I found the vegetable/tomato base to be stronger than I had anticipated based on other reviews and made it taste too much like vegetable soup instead of bean soup.  If you really like the taste of vegetable soup, then this would be a great recipe to try.

This is not what I was expecting of "bean soup", but it is absolutely delicious! I  following the author's notes (reviewed on March 24) and the only thing I would change would be to only use one bay leaf, if any.  The flavor came through a little too much.  I also used diced tomatoes with jalepenos and this was good.  This requires a huge pot, takes a long time, but worth the extra effort if you want a "better than ordinary" soup!!

This soup is good, but I have to agree with RobynAnn; the chili powder, Worcestershire sauce, and mustard dominated the flavor of this soup. After it simmered, I added chicken bouillon and a dash of sugar. My family liked the soup...they ate it, but I don't think they'd want me to make it again. I know they wouldn't have liked it at all without the extra bouillon and sugar. Everyone has their different tastes and this soup just isn't a family favorite for us.

This recipe truly meets the expectations of its name.  We didn't even know we love ham and bean soup but we had a ham in the freezer.  Now our children keep asking when we'll have another ham.  One is thawing in the frig now and this soup is on the menu!

This was really good. I substituted Hot and Spicy V8 for the low sodium V8 juice. We like a little more spice. I couldn't tell with the other juices that I had even put it in. Next time I might also substitute diced tomatoes with green chiles to up the spice factor.

Yummy....Simply Delicious!  We like a little "bite" to our soups, so I used Spicy V-8 juice and Hot Mexican Chili Powder.  This truly is a keeper!

Delicious! I followed the directions from the recipe creator's review and not what AllRecipes posted. Except I didn't have a ham bone so I increased the cut ham to 3 cups; used 5 different beans totaling 2.5 cups (I'll increase to 3 cups next time) and added the cut veggies much later, maybe 2 hours before the soup was done. Also keeping my 3 year old in mind, I only used 1/2 a tblspn of chili powder. There was a very subtle hint of spice so I'll use a little more next time. After our meal I was able to fill 4 ziploc freezer bags with the leftovers. Definitely a great freezable meal. Served with Best Ever Corn Muffins from this site.

My husband and I LOVE this recipe!  It makes a lot of soup so I freeze some and reheat it later.  I was out of V8 juice and used tomato sauce this time, it was really delicious!

I didn't have any stock in the house, so I used onion soup mix. I also had a bit of leftover whole wheat pasta, so I tossed it in. Yummy! Great recipe. Thanks.

This is one of the best soups I have ever had.  One time I did not have any ham, so substituted sausage instead and it was still great.

I made this exactly as the recipe stated and could not eat it.  The ham lost its flavor and the Dijon mustard gave it a tang that didn't match the anticipated taste.  I was disappointed that my family didn't care for it as it took some time to prepare and contained expensive ingredients.

Absolutely delicious! I am so glad I decided not to listen to the negative reviews.  I never made 13 bean soup with ham. We all loved this, even my 11 year old son who is a picky eater. Trust me make it. I will say that I did soak my beans overnight, rinsed & next morning cooked for 30 minutes.  Then I refrigerated because I was making next day. And I only cooked for 3 hours in Dutch oven on stove.   Fabulous

Thank you for this recipe. Was looking for something a bit different for my beans & ham bone. Use only meat from ham bone, plenty on it. Followed recipeingredients,  only used my insta pot. Cooked beans for ten in insta pot. Then 30 mins with everything. I was concerned beans would be mushy but everything was perfect. enjoying the flavors perfect, thank you again for posting

This recipe lives up to its name - it is really really good soup. I pretty well followed the recipe as written except that I had to substitute a large can of store brand pasta sauce for the tomatoes and V-8 juice, and having no dry beans, I used a can each of white kidney and Romano beans.  As I also added into the pot the liquid that accrued from baking the ham I added no salt to the soup.

Very flavorful combination of spices. I wasn't clear if the simmer process was to be with or without the lid on. I left it on and may have added too much of the chicken broth and as a result it was flavorful but perhaps too much both for the amount of stock. Based on the flavor of the soup... It's worth another shot to improve the end product.

Great soup.  I used a frozen ham I had.  I did not include the vegetable juice or vegetable stock.  I used homemade turkey stock for all of it as that is what I had on hand.  Will definitely make again

This is as close as it gets to my grandma’s bean soup.  I hate it when others go on to review a recipe and it makes it nothing like the recipe they’re reviewing! But, in this case, I say use this recipe as your base.  I don’t add chili powder. I don’t always cook it for 8 hours. I presoak my beans. And simmer it for at least 4 hours. I like to use a honey baked ham bone. Did you know they sell just the bone? I’m heavy handed with the Worcester sauce and fresh (must be fresh) lemon juice. I don’t use vegetable juice or vegetable broth - I use chicken broth instead of water.  Lots of this is done to taste. Love this recipe!

Yes.  I had made a slow-cooker spiral ham 2 days before and had a lot of drippings and juice from the ham, so I did not have to use the chicken broth.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe.  It was so delicious!  I couldn't get over it!  My husband said it was the best soup he had ever tasted and the best I ever made!  It made a large amount, so I froze half of it.  Being that we are soup lovers, this will be one that I will make often, especially in the cold, winter months!  Thank you for the recipe!

We liked this and will definitely make it again. I used all ingredients as stated but used the crockpot for most of the cooking. I did the first 30 minute boil and drain,  then simmered the ingredients for an hour before putting in the crockpot all day. I cooked it on high for 9 hours, leaving the bone in the whole time. It came out thick from not adding additional broth (left it while at work), but it was still very good.  I might try it on low next time. I would say don't add salt until you taste it. I love salt so I added it before tasting and it was really salty.

I made this soup this weekend.  It turned out great.  I love it and will definitely make it again. I followed some of the other comments. I added the cut up ham and vegetables at the 4 hour mark. I did not add all the chicken stock as it would have over flowed my pot. I used the dried mustard as I did not have any Dijon mustard, but I will get some for the next batch.  As per the BF The only con was that is was that it was not thick enough.  I will do what some others have recommended and purée some beans and stock at the 4 hour mark.  Great soup!!

Will definitely make again!  Only change was I couldn’t find the multi bean mix so I just got 3 bags of different dried beans (black, garbanzo and red) and I didn’t add the Worcestershire sauce because of a gluten allergy.    It was delicious!

I just made this recipe as I love soup and make lots of different types of soups.  This one was outstanding!  Have saved it as a favorite and plan on making it for my college kids and their friends.   Sure they will have seconds!

I would have given it five, but people that enjoyed it with me thought it was too spicy.  I am assuming that it was the chili powder because there wasn't really anything else in it to give it heat.  I have always enjoyed putting ketchup and sweet relish in my bowl of ham and bean soup, and with the addition of the tomatoes, it took care of one of those steps.  A good soup that I enjoyed.

I followed the recipe with only two changes.  Instead of cubed ham, I had leftover ham bone with quite a bit of meat on it.  I added it to the pot as instructed but when I noticed the meat falling off the bone as I was stirring, I removed it, let it cool and separated the meat and fat.  I put the bone back in and tore the remaining ham into bits, adding it back into the soup.  About the 6-hour mark, my very hungry husband asked to go ahead and eat.  I served it at the 6-hour mark and it was delicious.  I added cornbread and we had a few good meals.

I just had a bowl at the 8 hour mark.  Fantastic!  The only thing I changed was I substituted watered down salsa for the vegetable juice because I didn't have any.   Looking forward to the final 2 hours!

I've made it once and followed the recipe exactly.   I loved the seasonings and wouldn't change them at all.   However, it had way too many beans for me.   Next time, I'll use 1/2 the bag of dried beans and will add some chopped white potato.   Maybe also increase the ham to 3 cups.  But, this is a winner!

Great recipe, although I used canned cannellini beans, smoked ham (left-overs) and Honey Baked Ham (left-overs). My other tweaks: added a cup of chopped red pepper, a cup of chopped crimini mushrooms and used only vegetable and chicken stock. I used fresh campari tomatoes instead of from a can. I used 6 cloves of garlic and 3 shallots in addition to the yellow onion. Some tamari for some of the salt and a dash of cayenne and tabasco sauce.
The scallions are for garnish.

Server with Mexican style cornbread, it was  fantastic! I'll ret the 16 bean recipe some other day...

Gross! I should have known better. Chili powder, lemon juice and Worcestershire in ham soup? I thought, "What the heck, I'll give it a shot." I should have trusted my instincts. What a waste of a perfectly good ham bone and broth. First time in my life I've thrown out an entire pot of soup.

The recipe is delicious; even when a family member initially turned his nose up at it, he ended up eating 2 bowls of the portion I sent to his home, and he would have finished it all but his wife had not eaten yet.  
I made one mistaken by using the drippings from the original heating of the Honey Baked ham as part of the 3 cups of chicken broth (thinking it would had more flavor; but instead made it too, too salty). I had to drain out the liquid part of the soup. I quick soaked 3/4# of navy beans and added that to the bean soup with the quick soaking liquid. So the bean soup was savaged after my mistake.

I made it according to directions except I put 1-1/3 packages of beans into the soup recipe and cooked the other 2/3 beans separately. After the soup was done, I put the 2/3 beans into a blender and puréed them and then added to the soup.  It made the soup a little thicker.  It was delicious!  Will make this recipe again.

A wonderful mix of tasty veggies and ham.  The best ham soup I have had!  Much lighter than split pea, but very flavorful.  I used frozen turkey broth from my Christmas turkey and the hambone from Easter.  A holiday treat.

By far the best Ham and bean soup.  
I leave out tomatoes and V8, and add no salt.

 I have substituted homemade taco seasoning when out of chili powder and it was awesome.

I made this soup with some minor changes and it turned out very good. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 since I didn’t make it exactly as written. I did not use Worcestershire sauce or Dijon mustard. Just not a fan and after reading some of the reviews, thought I should leave them out. I used navy beans instead of the variety and a can of tomato sauce instead of V8. I also reduced the chili powder by half. I cooked it in the crockpot for about 8 hours. Since it was a little thin, I squished some of the beans up to thicken it a little. Very yummy! Sorry to those who don’t like when reviewers change things but I find it very helpful and hopefully someone might find my changes helpful too.

I carefully followed the directions with only two changes:  I used 8 oz of tomatoes instead of 14 and only had 4 ounces of V* on hand.  It was tasty.  Two things I didn't like: the vegetables got very soft and there weren't enough beans.  If making this again, I'll increase the beans by maybe a quarter and add the veggies in the last two hours.  Enough in this recipe to freeze, which is nice.

Turned out awesome.
Made it in a 6 qt INSTANT POT. 
Modifications as follows:
Sautee veggies first
Mix in all condiments and spices.
Add diced tomatoes and rinsed beans (don't soak)
Add 50oz can chicken stock and low sodium V8
Add ham bone, plus cubed chunks
Skip veggie stock and salt. 
Could do 50/50 on chicken/veggie stock, to reduce salt.
45 minutes manual high pressure
Natural pressure release recommended
(I had to finally manual release the pressure after 55min of waiting.)

Delicious! Made it in my instant pot so I had to scale it down.  1 lb soaked great northern beans, 2 cups leftover spiral ham, 1 can diced tomatoes, 1 tbsp dijon mustard, 1 tbsp worcestershire, couple tablespoons meyer lemon juice, pepper, 2 carrots, one onion, two stalks celery, some black pepper. Will make again!

This soup is FABULOUS!! I agree with the reviewer who stated it's not your "traditional bean and ham soup" but who cares when it tastes this good?!?  Based on the reviews that said it was a lot of soup - I halved the recipe and still managed to fill my entire crockpot. I dumped all the ingredients in a crock-pot, except the chicken broth and then used enough broth to cover them. Cooked on low for 8 hours and it turned out spectacular.  My only *small* complaint was that it ended up being a little too salty for my liking, so I'll probably cut the broth with water next time. But this is a going to be a regular winter staple in my house.  (Ps. even my 4 year old who doesn't like beans scarfed down an entire bowl! Win!!)

I made this recipe as written and my husband, who is not really a "soup person" loved it, the kids finished their bowls and my picky teenager also raved about it. I do wish we had larger chunks of ham (we had a leftover spiral ham) but other than that, I wouldn't change a thing!! Will make again for sure!

Easy and yummy.  This was great on a cold winters night.  I made it in my instant pot, manual for 5 minutes.  It came out perfect.  I did exact recipe except for two cans of beans instead of dried.

My revisions: I soaked beans overnight, rinsed and drained and then added water to cover beans.....but did not cook for 30 minutes and then discard that cooking water as the recipe states. I just added all the broths to the beans covered in water.  Used all low sodium broths. I used a left over from Christmas meaty ham bone, 2 whole carrots, 5 whole cloves of garlic, 2 whole stalks of celery and 1 large onion cut in quarters.  After 5 hours of cooking;  I fished out the large ham bone and the whole carrots, celery, and onion.  I cut off the meat that hadn’t fallen off the bone and put that back in the pot, then added the can of diced tomatoes, chopped carrots, onions, celery the last 45 minutes of cooking. The last 15 minutes of cooking added a couple handfuls of fresh baby spinach and the juice from a half of fresh lemon.  I’ve taught cooking for 22 years and I am so impressed with this recipe’s seasoning—-just fabulous!

This may be the best soup I’ve ever made. I followed the directions, except adding the salt and I also used my crockpot. I’m thinking this could be a great base for shrimp and grits.  Thank you for sharing!

One of the best soup recipes I've ever made. I added extra beans and left some extra meat and fat on the ham bone, which made for a very rich and delicious flavor. I also did the entire thing in the crock pot on low for 8 hours vs a stock pot, which worked out great. Because of the crock pot, I only needed the vegetable broth as listed, and didnt need any chicken stock to keep the moisture level up. I also didnt include any vegetable juice, and dont think it made any difference. Will definitely make again!

It was delicious!! Had to substitute a different mustard ( a sweet hot one) from what I had available. I soaked it longer than over night and did not have to cook it for 8 hours, more like 6 hrs.

I used this recipe as a basic template.  We don't eat ham or pork at all so that's a major change.  I used homemade chicken stock (from the chicken bones we accumulate in the freezer.)  Someone had given me a gift packet of many different beans for bean soup  and now that we've got chilly weather it seemed like a perfect time to make a hearty soup like this.  I added all kinds of herbs and spices and also a can of corn and another can of sauerkraut.  Then, because it was a bit sour, I added a can of pumpkin.  And towards the end, a package of frozen spinach as it was finishing.  Boy, was it delicious!!!  Super-good, hearty bean soup perfect for cold weather.  It was just the recipe I needed - minus the pork!  Thank you!

Absolutely the best ham and bean soup I remember ever having.  I followed the directions exactly as written and am gloriously happy with the results!  I think the Worcestershire sauce and Dijon mustard give this soup the extra kick and flavor that other recipes are missing.

I just made this and my hubby and I love it!!  The only thing I changed was the length of time in cooking.  It was done perfectly to our taste in 4 1/2 hours instead of the 10 it called for. I'm afraid if I'd cooked it that long it would have been mush instead of soup.

Made this as stated but used 9c chicken broth. Degas'ed the beans first and then put it all in pressure cooker minus the ham. Used "soup" button but increased time to 35 mins. Let the pressure go out naturally after. Added ham in and let it just heat up in the hot soup as ham was already cooked and I didn't want it to dry out.

This was my first time making a ham soup and this recipe was delicious! I didn't put onions in it and it doesn't need it. The  Worcester  sauce and chili power gives the soup a very nice flavor. Definitely will make it again.

Great recipe! I made half a recipe and since I used a leftover ham bone from Easter, I used the water I boiled the ham in instead of vegetable juice and broth. I also skipped the tomatoes. Got rave reviews.

This soup was excellent.  I did not use the vegetable broth as I don 't like the taste of it, but besides me my family thought it was delicious.  I usually like the basic bean soup with just the northern beans and vegetables, but this was certainly all as good or better.

I have never made soup before and I think it is awesome.  I have tasted it but have not had dinner yet. I had a huge Easter ham so I had 3 big ham bones to use. I used 4 cups of Chicken  broth and 3 cups of vegetable broth.  I used a lot of water maybe 4-5 cups and added in 2 potato's.  I was worried it would not have enough flavor. It had tons of flavor and any way of cutting out salt is great. I also added the carrots and celery after 4 hours but wished I had added them even later.  I'm anxious to hear what my boys think when I serve it in 2 hours.

So good! Modifications: no bay, no lemon juice, no celery, no veg juice, no veg broth; add 2T apple cider vinegar, add tomato can full of apple juice, add tomato can full of water; only 4 C chick broth.

My 7yr old saw colorful bag of beans while doing our Easter shopping and asked if we could get them - perfect use of leftover Easter ham yay! Even my soup-resistant husband liked it. Thank you for the recipe!!

Didn't have a ham bone but I added the ham flavoring packet that  came with the beans. I really liked it and so did my husband. He had three bowls and wanted more (but he was too full). I am going to make it again next week! Beans are really good for you, so I try to use beans at least once a week. (I love to put black beans, salsa, cheese, and sour cream on my scrambled eggs!!)

# 1 - READ ALL THE REVIEWS. THE INSTRUCTIONS ARE INCORRECT
Would give this 15 stars if I could.  Love this bean mix,, but  hate the high salt content of the  enclosed "seasoning packet".  Made this almost exactly by the recipe - added garlic - we are Italian - and used fresh cherry tomatoes instead of canned - what I had. This is so very good. It is easy, satisfying, and very very tasty. My DH and Mom both raved. Thanks for a great recipe. I was hooked when I read "toss the seasoning packet"!!

I really don't see the purpose of the cook-time.  8-10 hrs of cooking is way too much. I would say after a good 4 hrs it is done. I followed the recipe exactly for the ingredients. I really can't say it was over-seasoned. I didn't think one item was overpowering. I even added the additional ham flavoring that came with the beans, at the end of cooking. It wasn't too salty and I didn't add any additional salt. Obviously, we all have different palates for taste and flavor. The older we get, our taste buds change. Mine aren't as acute as some. So all in all, this was good.

I make my own "15" bean mixture eliminating several kinds of beans that I do not particularly care for such as chick-peas. I wanted a true ham flavored broth, so eliminated the diced tomatoes/vegetable juice/chicken broth.  I used homemade ham broth I had previously made and frozen, and added ham bullion as needed for taste. Also did not use Bay leaves, chili powder or lemon juice. I guess I shouldn't be commenting on this recipe since I changed so much, but it is what I wanted. Turned out wonderful. Will make again.

Awesome!  It's on my keeper list.   Could not find any any ham bones so used ham hocks instead.  The meat manager suggested oxtail, which I had never tasted, but added about 1.5 lbs.  it was a very nice additional taste.  I took the oxtail bones out after about 6 hrs and shredded and returned any remaining meat to  the pot. There is a lot of fat on oxtail so you should trim as much of it as you can see.

Ham and bean soup - pretty standard recipe of the  tomato inclusion variety.  Seasonings were tasting pretty interesting until against my better judgement i tossed in the 3 tablespoons of lemon juice...what's up with that?  I'm adding in pineapple chunks to compensate for that addition. We'll see if it can be salvaged.

I made this from leftover Christmas ham. I did make a couple minor changes though. I used only 1 bay leaf and used only chicken broth, no vegetable broth.   It turned out great!

I agree with another reviewer who said that it tasted like Chili.  It was chili with ham, vegetables and mustard.  I guess if you like that kind of thing it's okay.  My husband liked the soup and he loves chili.  Also, I found it to be a bit sour.  Probably won't make this again.

I used tomato juice instead of vegetable juice, as well as just black-eyed peas rather than the 15 bean mix.... turned out great! Very flavorful, just a hint of heat. I used my leftover spiral cut ham from Christmas. Cut all the meat off the bone, put in the bone, trimmed and chopped the meat and put it in.

I cooked the dried beans with the ham bone and used low sodium chicken broth instead of water. When the beans were soft I put everything except potatoes diced small into a large crockpot (8 quart). Add more chicken broth as needed or 1/2 chicken broth 1/2 water. Cook about 6 hours in crockpot and add potatoes the last 2 hours.

This soup was amazing. It is not your "typical" ham soup but it is DELICIOUS. I read through the comments and ended up using half the chili powder. SO so good. I made it on the stove and in the slow cooker. Mine came out better in the slow cooker for some reason, just a fyi.

Probably the best soup I've made. I used leftover spiral ham from Easter and some frozen Va. Country ham from Christmas. I needed to add more broth, and I used half a bottle of the 46 oz. V-8 juice. For taste I added more carrots, and next time I will probably add even more. Made so much I'm able to give some to my daughter, son, & mother! Great find!

i made it with a salt cured ham so I added no salt and still was way too salty for my taste but will make it again with a sugar cured ham this time, it should be a hit without the salt.

This was delicious soup! I made it with the leftover ham and bone from Christmas that I froze. I had Great Northern beans, lentils and split peas that I needed to use, so substituted those for the 15 bean mix. I went by the recipe pretty close, but instead of chicken stock, used the juice that was in the pan from my Christmas ham (I saved & froze that after spooning off the fat, too, knowing I was going to make some soup). I didn't use vegetable stock either, just increased the V8 juice to about 2 cups. I also added chopped fresh parsley to brighten the flavor a bit, which it did.  My family enjoyed it and my mother-in-law went back for 2nds, which she rarely does!

My go to recipe!! Everyone loves this one, served with a warm baguette loaf and its an instant hit. Leftovers go into the freezer and they are a quick treat on a cold snowy day. The mustard and tomatoes give this soup just the right favors to an old favorite. My mom is a great cook and been making ham and bean soup for years but she loved this version!!

A great flavorful soup.  I didn't pre-soak my beans, I just simply brought them to a boil and then lowered the heat and continued a slow roll boil for an additional 90 minutes.  I boiled them in chicken broth and a ham bone left over from another meal.  I also didn't add the tomato juice since I was trying to stay away from my usual  tomato based soup. I didn't have any carrots so I added a can of carrots the last 15 minutes of cooking. I can only imagine the added flavor if I had prepared the beans in the traditional long version.  A great dish that even my teenager who claims he hates bean, ate.

I agree this is more a chili taste than ham and bean soup, but is has great taste.  I used a crock pot instead of simmering over an open flame all day.  The broths did not reduce as much as I would have liked as a result. I will make this again but use the range instead of the crock pot.

Very good Ham bone and bean soup!  I cut back on seasonings and was out of vegetable juice and broth, but used water.  It was quite delicious.  It did NOT take 8-10 hours of cooking, as the recipe suggests, ESPECIALLY after soaking the beans overnight.  After just 2 hours, I was so afraid that it would turn to mush, so I turned it off and let it sit for 1/2 a day until dinner time.  Then we warmed it back up.  I served it with corn bread and it was a big hit!!

I have used this recipe for years and about the only thing I modify is to delete the chili pwd and use spicey V8 as adds an awesome taste to it , I don't add carrots. - and I usually buy a little extra black forest ham at the deli to chunk up.  Just plain yum!!!

I made an adaptation of this soup in the slow cooker, and it turned out great.
I made three main changes:  
1) 1 cup of cubed ham + 1.5 cups of ground mild Italian sausage, browned (I ate too much ham lately).  
2) instead of chicken+vegetable stock, I only used 4 cups of  full sodium chicken stock (since it doesn't boil down in the slow cooker).  
3) I also added a small can of mushrooms, but I like mushrooms.  
Overall it really had a great flavor, and was a hearty soup/stew that cooked during the day in the slow cooker.

Definitely the best I've made.  I, too, cooked the bone first so I could skim off the fat.  I added a large diced potato and some frozen corn and cut the carrots down to 3.  I'll bet it would be good with some shredded cabbage too.   I thought the seasonings were just fine, even the mustard, which I generally don't like.   I used veggie broth, due to a chicken allergy in the family.    Used the biggest pot I had - too much for my biggest crock pot.    Cooked it about 6 hours.   It froze beautifully, too.

This soup is so yummy. I bought a pack of three ham hocks and put them in the soup. I used cut up ham, too. I used chicken broth and water. Half of a small can of tomato sauce instead of veg juice. No salt, as the ham and hocks are salty.  I can never wait overnight to soak the beans, though, so this soup was all ready to eat in about 4 hours.
This one is a keeper! Thank you so much!!!

Never had this type of soup before, tastes somewhere inbetween navy beens and ham, chili,  and vegetable soup.  Loved it.  Spicy kick.  I will definately make again, but will reduce chili powder to 2 teaspoons, and probably eliminate the teaspoon of salt.  Simply fantastic.

Yes, I made some changes but basically stuck to the recipe. I used a can of kidney beans and a can of pinto beans and rinsed them first. This soup is delicious. The mustard and lemon juice gives it a flavor that is different than any other soup that I've tried. Nice and robust... tangy even. I added two cubed red potatoes and used some chopped red bell pepper. I couldn't get enough of this soup!

I stuck to the recipe and the broth of this soup is Amazing!  The only reason I gave it a four was I would next time put some of the veggies in a little later so they have some texture left or not cook as long.  Also the bean mixture I had was mixed with split peas and I think that next time I'll try with only whole beans.  I did use left over ham but it was honey cured and I think I would prefer not having the sweetness and no spiral cut next time, I'd rather have chunks.  The long time of cooking just melted most things too much together.  This takes a lot of time but with the right beans and ham this would be a 5!

Reduced the quantities to fit my pot.  Made ham stock the day before like another reviewer mentioned to be able to skim off some fat.  Did not add the vegetable juice or lemon juice, used Rotel tomatoes, half the chili powder, mustard, and Worcestershire. Used 3 cans of beans as another short cut.  Added the veggies during the last hour of simmering as other reviewers recommended. Really liked the flavors and the mix of veggies with ham and beans.  Cooked the soup about 2 1/2 hours.

My ham bone didn't have tons of meat so I added smoked Ukrainian sausage too. One hot pepper added. I used fresh parsley and one small leek. This soup is fantastic and filling. Great flavour. I found that the spilt peas took extra cooking. I cooked it the whole time but had to cook some of the soup I needed today in the crockpot on high before my guest arrived. This was in addition to the required time in the recipe.

I made this easy recipe and my husband loved it!  I did add chicken broth throughout the day, using my judgement as to how much to add each time. I cooked the soup for 8 hours only.  I cut back on the kosher salt to half suggested amount.  You may also want to cut back a little on the Dijon mustard.  I'll definitely make this again.  Lindasue

It's not your traditional bean & ham soup. It's an okay tomato-based veggie bean soup.  I wouldn't make it again.

I was skeptical because the recipe takes some planning.  I wanted to make it one day, but didn't realize the beans had to be soaked the night before.  However, the soup was absolutely delicious and everyone in my family, including my 11-year-old loved it!

This is by far the best ham and bean soup I have EVER had!!!!  All of my kids ate it, which is a small miracle in my home, but was abolutely delicious.  I followed the revised directions with the only exception, I had made my own broth.  Great way to use up any ham you may have, even the lunch meat variety.

OMG. This soup has been on the stove for 7 hours. It's done and has smelled outstanding since I put in all the ingredients to cook 7 hours ago.. I made two changes. Since my husband and I don't care for many of the beans in the 15 bean pack, I substituted Great Northern white beans and I used 2 packages. I also didn't have Dijon mustard. I had Dijonaise which mixes the Dijon mustard with a little mayo. I used it in place of the pure mustard. I added everything that was called for, Worcestershire, lemon juice, chili powder, etc. The beans and vegies are cooked and the soup is perfect, since I've added more water to thin. It is DELICIOUS. Can't wait for dinner time. Serving homemade cornbread with butter to accompany. I'll make this again. What a wonderful depth of flavors. Don't change a thing about the seasonings. It's fabulous!

Best ham and bean soup!  Used water for vegetable broth.  Wasn't sure whether to cook uncovered or covered for the 8 hours...I poured all the chicken broth in at once and partially covered and it turned out great!

This is one of the best bean and ham soups I have ever tried. I will definatly be making this again. I did however omit the vegetable juice. Was afraid it would be to much tomato flavor. But other then that its perfect.

I have never really liked traditional ham and beans. That is why, when I found myself with a ham bone, I looked for something a little different. I tried the right recipe! This is great! I used straight pinto beans instead of 15 bean soup. (I am picky about my beans.) I also used left over ham drippings (2 cups) and water(2 cups) instead of canned broth and omitted the salt. I put all but the ham  and two of the carrots (I was out of room) in my 5 quart slow cooker. I brought it to a simmer on high, then turned it to low. I added the chopped ham only for the last hour. It cooked for a total of nine hours. It came out full of flavor! Will definitely make again.

This recipe was delicious. Best bean and ham soup I have made. I did not have the chile powder so I made it without it and it was so good. I wonder though what it would have tasted like if I had added the chile powder. I may not have liked it as much.

This turned out awesome. Everyone loved it. I baked a ham a week before. Froze the drippings from that along with the ham bone. When it was time to make soup, I removed the layer of fat from the drippings and replaced 3 cups of the chicken broth with the drippings. Wow!

Made the soup last night and it was amazing!!! We could not stop eating it!  I followed the recipe to the letter except I simmered it for only about five hours, which was perfect. Didn't have a ham bone saved from our Easter ham so I bought a ham shank instead. It was delicious!

I thought this was very good. I checked out the negative comments which made me somewhat skeptical but I guess you cant please everyone. For myself and my boyfriend, we will make this again! My only comment would be would be to be thoughtful with the salt it can be easy to over-do it.

awesome. here is what i did. used spiral ham instead. no lemon juice. used powdered mustard. oh use an elite pressure cooker. cook beans in 5 cups water first on the bean setting. next add all the vegies etc then cook on soup setting. takes one hour and its yummy. you have to make sure you add worchestershire and the chili power, no need for a  bone in ham here. this was my flavor flave...

Wow! Not only did I love this soup when I made it, I froze the leftovers and they were absolutely incredible a few weeks later. Only things I changed were smaller cutting of veggies (my family doesn't like to "taste" the vegetables) and I didn't have veg juice, so I just used more veg broth. But it was great. The "special ingredients", like the mustard, lemon and veg broth, really give it great flavor. I just opened a can of $$ organic lentil soup and it was so disappointing in comparison to this lentil soup. So I'm going to get a ham hock right now to make it!

I have made this soup every year for the past several years with my leftover Christmas ham bone. It is the absolute best soup I have ever made or eaten. You do not need to change a thing on the recipe. Enjoy!

Really tasty recipe.  My recipe adjustments were using canned beans such as pinto beans and pink beans.  I did not have vegetable juice so i used tomato sauce in place.  Next time, I will lessen the amount of black pepper and/ or worchestershire sauce next time. Using Chipotle chili powder gave it a great smokey flavor.  Many compliments regarding the yummy flavor!

When your children say "Wow, this is good, can I have more?", you have a winner! Very good! I made it it the crock pot, using less broth (and I used chicken bouillon).  I added a few more navy beans and increased the veggies and it made my large crock pot FULL and my medium crock pot FULL. Cooked on low for 4 hours without the carrots and celery. I then added the carrots and celery and cooked on low for 3 more hours.  Fed 6 hungry people, with leftovers and I put 2 quarts in the freezer.
KEEPER!

This is AMAZING! I am so happy I decided to try this! I couldn't find a 15 bean package, but I did find a 20 bean one and used it instead. Bought a 3 pound ham hock, threw all the ingredients on top, covered with the liquids and let it simmer all day. Didn't need to add anymore ham as the amount of meat that came off the hock was more than enough. This is SOOO worth the time and effort - just be ready for a lot of soup as this yields a significant amount. Also, I used a 16 quart soup pot and it was more than 1/2 way full once all of the ingredients/liquids were in there - so please take note!

This is a very good recipe. A little different than the normal ham & been recipe.  I could not taste the chili power. I omitted the lemon juice as  it did not sound good to me. I will definately make it again.

I really enjoyed this soup and I'm not a soup type of person. It worked out perfect with the left over ham bone from Chriatmas. The only difference is that I put everything in the slow cooker and let it cook all day.

I made this tonight with left over Christmas ham.  The only modifications I made were 1) Used canned white and pinto beans -drained 2) did not use the tomatoes, vegetable juice or chicken broth, however the vegetable broth (4 cups) that I did use had tomatoes in it.  I let simmer 1.5 - 2 hours. Delicious!

This is an excellent recipe. I didn't use the ham bone but I did use a ham that was salt cured for a year and didn't remove the fat. With all the curing the fat really dissolves easily and gives a fantastic flavor to the soup. Next year for our holiday ham I will order the bone-in ham to be able to use the ham bone as well.

There is absolutely no substitute for  a ham bone or ham shank with meat on it for a ham and bean soup. The flavor of the bone imparts to the dish is what makes a true Ham and Bean Soup.

Fabulous.  I skipped the vegetable broth (didn't have on hand) and used chicken broth.  And instead of ham, I diced up turkey kielbasa, since the 9 year old likes it so much.  A keeper!!!

I wasn't as impressed with this soup as most of the others.  I found it to be somewhat bland;  however, I didn't try any of the tweeked versions.  It just seemed to be more work than it was worth.

This soup really has such a depth of flavor.  I was a little hesitant about the Dijon mustard and thought I had definitely made a mistake after adding it - I tasted the broth shortly after adding it and it was such an overpowering taste.  Four hours later, everything had just come together and after another couple of hours it was PERFECT!  I will never throw away a ham bone again.  Delicious!

Lots of flavor, very satisfying and relatively easy to make.  I did not have all of the broth called for, so I substituted water and a few bouillon cubes for about half of the broth.  It was delicious with a green salad and jalapeno/cheese cornbread!

Made this using kidney, pinto, black & northern beans, cause I don't like lima or peas! :) And I'm allergic to celery, so that was omitted. Other than those changes, this turned out DELICIOUS!! **Start this soup EARLY, cause it's gonna take 10+ hours to cook!! My husband put the lid on the pot for the last few hours and that really helped speed up the tenderizing & evaporation.  I know it looks like a lot of ingredients, but MAKE THIS SOUP!! It will be worth it! :)

It was very very tasty, but maybe a little too many spices for us. Nonetheless, it was an amazing ham and bean variation!

Fabulous!  I made this on Sun and have had it for lunch everyday since (this was the 5th day).    It made a huge batch so I froze some and took a container out today just so I could have it for lunch, again, today and tomorrow.  I made a large green salad and homemade bread to go with it.  My husband loved it as well.  Normally, he only eats soup once but he took it to work for two meals and commented on how great it was left over.  I didn't add the lemon juice and only needed about 4 cups of the broth.  I added some arugula and squash that I need to use up.

We made this from the ham bone left from our Christmas ham and it was outstanding! The only thing I did different was to add a pepper sauce we had on hand (Ring of Fire) in place of the chili powder, and it came out great! My entire family loved it and we will be making it again!

Awesome soup! My husband and I loved this recipe. Used honey baked ham bone leftover from Christmas. I did not change anything regarding the ingredients except adding a little more chicken and vegetable broth and did not need any additional salt. For me this soup only needed approximately 5 1/2hrs to simmer. Will definitely make this again.

I made as directed, only substituting Spicy V8 in for the regular V8.  I had to pull the ham bone out about 4 hours in - as it was falling apart.  The soup was good.  It was a little bit bland, next time I might add a dash of cayenne pepper or something to give it a little kick to match our personal tastes.  Overall, however - it was easy, made the house smell great and was tasty!  (Note:  I didn't used the full 7 cups of chicken broth the recipe called for... it would have been WAY to much).  We will definitely make again.

It is a good recipe, however... I followed the recipe but noticed after 6 hours of simmering the beans had disappeared and there was no ham viable. I reheated it the next day and added two cans of beans and will buy some ham sliced and cube it up when I heat up.\again. Perhaps I will simmer the soup and stop the cooking when the beans are fork tender and use half the ham cubed and add the remaining half before serving just to heat the ham cubes up. My husband and I loved the soup but it was more of a puree after following the cooking times.

This was awesome!  I pulled the ham bone out a bit earlier (after 6 hours) because I was afraid it would get bitter if I cooked it too long.  I also added some minced garlic (about 2 cloves) and I used spicy hot V8 for the vegetable juice.  I also finished the soup with a little heavy cream just before serving.

I've never made soup with a ham bone, but we are chewing through a spiral cut ham, so I thought I'd give it a shot.  This certainly is an all day recipe, so make it when it's cold outside and you don't have to go anywhere!  Once you have everything in the pot, it really isn't too hard or too involved, but it does take some time to get there.  I thought this was pretty salty--probably just from the ham I used, so it's a good thing I didn't put in any of the kosher salt called for at the end. I halved the recipe, and I still have plenty of leftovers even with freezing a batch of it.  I would have quartered it (it's only the two of us) but didn't think that would work with the ham bone, so I just halved it.  Definitely plan on freezing leftovers unless you have a very very large family!  thanks for the recipe--very good, easy soup for my first attempt at using a ham bone for soup!

Absolutely delicious!!!  I've always made split pea with my leftover spiral ham bone, but I thought I'd try something different.  This will be my first choice from now on.  The flavor is amazing.  Even though this is an all day soup, it is well worth it.  I too was afraid of my beans breaking down, but they held together nicely.  I cooked my soup for 6.5 hours and it was fantastic.  It started getting thick towards the end, so this is where ones opinion comes into play on time.  I felt that if I cooked the soup for the additional time, that it would become more of a stew.  EXCELLENT recipe...thank you.

Great Ham and Bean Soup.  I precooked my beans like one of the other reviewers suggested by boiling for 3 minutes then soaking for 1 hour, cooked them again for 30 minutes and drained and then put all the ingredients in a pressure cooker that I sprayed with Pam and cooked for 15 minutes. I only used 4 cups of chicken broth, but everything else was the same.  It was fabulous and fit my rushed schedule.  Thanks!

This really lives up to its name, "The BEST".  Very, very tasty.  We need to keep referring people to the cook who submitted this recipe's "real" directions on 3/24/08.  I could only cook it about 6 hours the first day.  I used a 1# bag of baby carrots and 4 tomatoes. For the 7 c. chicken broth, I used 1 1/2 T. ham base for 4 c. Added the additional 3 c. and 1 1/8 T. ham base the next day when it cooked for a few more hours. I don't think anything was lost having to do it this way in case plans to cook it all in one day change for you, too.  And the day after, it was just as good, if not better.  Thank you!

The whole family really liked this soup!  It was a little spicy for the kids but we mellowed it out for them with a little sharp cheddar cheese.  I was only able to simmer it for 6 1/2 hours, but the ham was completely fallen off the bone, veggies tender and flavors melded.  I can't wait to have the left over tomorrow to see if it's better the second day!

This soup was good.  Not your typical bean type soup but good.  At first I think my hubby was disappointed but the second day said it was good.

This truly is the best bean soup I've ever had.  Definitely don't cut back and make a smaller batch, 'cause it's so good you'll want more for later.

I doubled the recipe and tasted it right away, thinking I added far too much Dijon. After cooking the flavors blended perfectly and it is by far the best bean soup I have ever made. Surprisingly, all of the beans are well cooked which is my biggest problem with dry bean recipes. I soaked for about 16 hours and cooked for 6.5hrs.   This was very inexpensive for making 24 portions. I'll be making it many times in the future.

This is the best bean soup I have ever made! The only thing I did was to add an addition 2 cans of beans because it was hard to find the beans when I stirred it. I did that an hour or so before serving. It was a bit salty so next time I would use low sodium broths.

This was very good.  I followed the recipe exactly, but I added about 3/4 cup of corn, just to add some sweetness.  Great recipe for leftover Easter ham!

I made it with a couple of changes since I didn't have all of the ingredients but I don't beieve they changed the recipe significantly.  I used all vegetable broth and used fresh parsley, I also added more ham since we had so much left! This was wonderful. I served it once with home made wheat bread and once with corn bread (a savory recipe) and it went with eiher. I froze about a third of it and am looking forward to using it- we had a heat wave so I am waiting for cooler weather.

I tried this recipe for the first time and it was delicious. The only thing that I changed was I omitted the tomatoe juice due to the fact I was cooking it in a 6 quart crock pot and it was already filled to the brim.. As a results this came out like more of a bean stew, which was just perfect with a loaf of bread. My husband, mother and I enjoyed it and I will make this one again. I also gave a portion to a friend who called me and said it was delicious. A keeper

Very good bean soup.  Not like traditional bean soup, but good non the less.  I made the recipe exactly as written with the changes the submitter made in her review.  I just stuck the ham bone in the pot and didn't add any extra ham and it was fine- loads of meat actually.  I did have to add a lot of chicken stock to keep it thinned out (2 32oz boxes) during the cooking.  I didn't find it needed any extra seasoning after the bone came out.  The ham I used was a Kirland spiral cut with out the glaze.  This made a lot of soup and we will eat it again this week on a busy night.  Thanks for sharing- this will be my go to recipe from now on.

Didn't use the mustard and worcestershire sauce and replaced the vegetable juice with tomato and red pepper soup.  Very good, will do again.

I thought this was delicious.  It had a sweet sort of BBQ flavor, probably because my ham was a honey ham. I didn't have a 15 bean mix on had so I used a bag of navy beans, I'm sure it would be even better with the variety of beans called for.  I halved the recipe and it fit perfectly in my 5 quart crock pot.

Would've given this a 5 but I modified it too much, so that wouldn't be fair. I used 5 cans of great northern beans-replaced the carrots/celery with what I had on hand which was broccoli. I was nervous about that but the whole family loved it. Used one can of tomatoes w/green chilis- 2 cans chix broth & 1 can vegi broth-added garlic powder-cut back on the salt as I used a smoked ham. Kept everything else pretty much the same-I never follow a recipe to the T. And last but not least, I added a ton of Franks Red Hot Sauce which I believe is what made this for me. Awesome!

I followed the recipe exactly except that I omitted the mustard because I did not have any and used a 16 bean mix because that was what my store had.  I started the soup on Saturday, cooked it for about 8 hours, then put it in the fridge overnight.  On Sunday morning, I removed the ham bone and allowed the soup to simmer on low all day.  It was AWESOME!  My sister, who is a very picky eater, joined us for dinner and she loved it!  She asked for some of the leftovers so she could have it for lunch.  This recipe is definitely a keeper and I will be making anytime I have a leftover ham bone.

This is fantastic. Easily one of the best soups i've ever had. it smells SO good when it's cooking! and i've had nothing but rave reviews when i make this. please note that the original poster of this recipe "benvolentempress" posted a follow up stating that the recipe was not published exactly as she submitted it and leaves out some very key steps. i'd urge anyone trying this recipe to check out her follow up post. it's easily accessible as the first review just under the recipe.

This was really good, I made the quick version though (about 2 hours).  I brought the beans to a rapid boil and then boiled gently for about an hour.  Then drained about half the water out and replaced it with 2 cans chicken broth and 1 chicken boullion cube.  I omitted the vegetable broth, carrots, celery and decreased the chili powder.  Thanks for the recipe!

I know I'm in the minority here, but this did not turn out right at all.  I used a honey-glazed ham and bone left over from Thanksgiving, which gave the soup a disgusting sweetness that I could not get rid of, no matter how much salt I added.  Also, just an FYI for those of you trying this with crockpots--it took WAY longer.  The beans were still cooking after 10 hours when I finally went to bed.  Unfortunately, I'm going to have to throw away the soup.  Maybe it would have been better with a regular ham?

Dan loved this recipe.  Cooked with pork bones but took them out when done cooking & added chopped ham. Next time, use meat from pork bones.  Cooked the celery whole & tossed when dish was ready.  Very good flavor.  Served with Krusteaz Cornbread.

Use two packages of beans..... And Goya's beans are 16 bean mix (hey and extra bean!) and were also 16 ounce packages. 20 ounces wasn't enough.  32 would be.

Excellent! I've been making bean and ham soup for years, but wanted to try a different recipe. This recipe is truely "the best". I stuck to the recipe, except I didn't have veg. broth and used a combination of chicken broth and water. oh, and I added some barley and lentils too. The flavor and the consistency is perfect. Thank you!!

The highest star rating is well deserved for this recipe.  You may want to call this anti-depression soup! It's very low budget and sooooo good and hearty. I was true to the recipe, but tweaked it a little to use additional ingredients I had on hand, such as 1/2 jalapeno (diced & seeds removed) and 6 parsnips.  You can pretty much add any root vegetable. Also, be sure to use a very large pot. I used a two-gallon pot and had to temporarily transfer stock out of the pot until it cooked down.  This is definitely a keeper.  Bon appetit!

I love to make soup and this soup was fantastic.  I found it was a little salty, so added water insted of chicken broth throughout the day to top off the pot.  My family loved it!  thanks

I quadrupled this recipe for a soup and supper nite at our rv park for 90 people. (Also served w/Basic Chicken Soup from Allrecipes, quadrupled) It was SOUPER! A big hit with everyone!  Followed the instructions as per the author and it was fantastic...don't change a thing!

Awesome recipe! I went overboard with the chili powder and gave it a little too much kick!  I think with the veggie juice a little chili powder goes a long way!  WOW!

Simple and good.  We go easy on the pepper and add some more ham, but we and the kids love it.

This recipe is ridiculous.  Tangy, hearty and so easy to throw together.  All it takes is time, but wow, is it worth it.  I generally make a traditional ham and bean soup with the Christmas ham bone, but after making this I'll never go back!

I hate bean soup, so I didn't try it, but my fiance and father(who is the conisseur of bean soup) said this was the best bean soup they'd ever had!
