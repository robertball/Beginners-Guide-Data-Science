Some changes: Lose the lemon! Greeks don't use them. Leave the skin on to keep the breasts moist. Season with Cavender's Greek Seasoning or salt, pepper, garlic, oregano, rosemary and thyme. Don't overcook it! The chicken bouillon is loaded with MSG! I don't let it in my kitchen.

Delicious!! The chicken was so tender and moist!! I didn't have any white wine so I added H2O however next time I'll just add chicken broth.. And at the end I needed to add a little more salt but this will definately be made again!!! Thanks for sharing!!

GREEKS DO USE LEMON.  They use lots of lemon and lots of salt. Authentic kotopoulo me potates has salt oil lemon and oregano and is baked in the oven.  This version is moist but the potatoes are a little too soft.  chicken was nice and juicy.

I was very pleased at how this recipe turned out. I was a little wary reading the reviews that stated there was too strong a lemon flavor and that the chicken was dry but I went for it anyway and made the recipe as directed. The only (minor) change I made was that I had to use a chicken that was nearly 4 pounds because I could not find a 3 pound one. It was relatively difficult to get the skin off the chicken but not impossible. I cooked this on low for about 9 hours while we were at work. When I came home the chicken was incredibly tender; as I lifted it out of the cooker it fell totally apart! So I suppose presentation-wise it may not look as nice as would be ideal. The flavor of both the chicken and potatoes was neither too strong nor too light in my opinion. I don't really know that any changes are needed to this recipe except maybe some additional veggies could be thrown in if you like such as carrots. Thanks for the great recipe!

Im giving this 4 stars cuz they have the right idea but this is what I do different. I have the butcher break down the chicken for me and then season with salt and pepper and brown in a skillet in olive oil place in crockpot on top of onion and garlic slices(potatoes sliced too if using we like this over orzo or rice) deglaze pan with wine and pour on top of chicken sprinkle with oregano and top with lemon slices add 1/4 cup chicken stock and cook on low 7hrs or high 3 or 4hrs this is delish!

Greek Slow Cooker Chicken Haiku: "Chicken crockpot fail. I had such high hopes for this. But it was no good." I'll give this 2 stars b/c despite the effort of skinning the chicken (blech) coming home from work to a crockpot meal that's ready is a nice convenience. The potatoes at the bottom absorbed all the flavor and juices (a little overwhelming on the lemon) and were too soggy in my opinion. The breast-side of the chicken was inedible it was so unbelievably Saharan. It was also very visually unappealing. The lower portion of the chicken that sat in more of the broth was moist so I shredded it from the bone and am hoping to salvage it into a pita w/ feta cheese and veggies for lunch today but truth be told most of these leftovers will be getting tossed. Sorry!

I made this with only minor changes. I seasoned the chicken with Cavendar's Greek Seasoning along with the oregano. I cut out the salt and pepper seasoning as the Cavendar's already has it. I also added some good quality Greek olives. I skinned the chicken just as instructed which is much better because the flavors can reach the meat. It was moist and tender. My husband and I thought this was absolutely scrumptious! It's a keeper in my recipe box!

AWESOME! So small things I did differently: I used a 6lb roaster I got on sale (The kind with the pop-up timer)and I did NOT remove the skin and I also added carrots. Since the potatoes are sliced pretty thick I only cut my carrots into thirds. I cooked it on high set for 6 hours but the timer popped after 5. It was falling off the bone and cooked perfectly as were the potatoes and carrots! There was so much juice in the pan I decided to throw together a quick gravy melted about 2 tablespoons of butter in a saucepan and whisked in about 3 tablespoons of flour for the roux then added about a cup of the liquid a little at a time. There's just so many great flavors going on in that juice between the onion and the garlic and the lemon! My only critique is that it probably doesn't need the olive oil or maybe only half as much. The lemon flavor was there but subtle not strong or overpowering at all. I'll definitely make this one again!

This was very good! I did make a few changes. I left the skin on just because I was too lazy to pull it off. I did not have any lemon so I used a few drops of lemon juice. The meat was very tender and fell right off the bone. Will make again!

This was so good. I would probably add some more potatoes next time because they soaked up the flavors so well and made an excellent side. I actually kept the skin on and massaged kosher salt oregano and minced garlic underneath to add more flavor and it turned out being a hit at home. And to the reviewer who said Greeks don't use lemons umm I don't know which Greeks you are talking about but we use lemon ALOT!

I made 2 minor changes: I only used about 2 tbsp of oil (adding a touch more water) and we didnt bother to skin the chicken. The skin helps hold moisture in and it's easier to peel the skin off during the carving rather than when it's raw. This was EXCELLENT! The overall flavor was pretty light but not bland. There was a bit of lemon but my husband and I thought it was just right. We drizzled a little juice on the chicken before serving and I'm freezing the leftover juices for soup or rice another day. It's so good! When I got home from work the whole house smelled great and the dog was sitting by the counter just staring at the slow cooker! I felt bad that she had to smell that awesomeness all day so I gave her a tiny taste and she just went nuts she loved it! Excellent recipe for the whole family:D

I made this for supper last night using a 5lb frozen whole chicken since that was what I had on hand.I wasn't too sure how it would turn out as I had to wait an hour for it to thaw (in the cooker) before I could fill the cavity as the recipe suggested. The results were absolutely delicious!! Perfect blend of flavors. My husband and I enjoyed it. I will definitely be making this again. Thanks for the recipe.

I would really give this 3.5 stars if possible. It was easy to throw together and smelled great. It looked unappetizing (watery/greasy) when done in the pot but plated well and tasted pretty good. My mother who is very choosey with her food loved it. I thought it would have been better if the potatoes had been cooked seperately since lemon-flavored potatoes seemed odd to me. They were fine the first day but became more lemony as leftovers and were mostly thrown out. The excess sauce was good enough to throw into broth I was also making. I will make again but I'll probably just boil potatoes on the stove. The seasoning is quite good for chicken.

I wanted to like this dish but it just didn't work for me. The lemon overpowered all the other ingredients. The potatoes were soggy. The chicken was also unappealing to the eye. Sorry.

I personally haven't even tasted this yet but the meat is falling off of the bone! I have never had chicken this moist and tender. My husband said that it needed some more seasonings but this could be because we had a 5 lb chicken but used the 3 lb recipe ingredients. Will make this again for sure!

Very flavorful juicy and tender! I did like so many others recommended and used Cavenders Greek Seasoning because I keep it on hand it is the perfect all around spice combination. I added extra garlic because we love it and this was a wonderful dish! Just the right thing for my "meat & potatoes" kind of guy...Thanks reviewers for the hints!

This is very tasty! Did not remove skin but placed Greek Seasoning under skin. Used bottled lemon juice since I had no lemons. Used minced garlic not fresh also used 1 full teaspoon of chicken paste. Did not put in any potatoes. I will make this again and again!

INCREDIBLE! The chicken was very moist and flavorful! I did modify it per the previous reviews though to make it more moist. I left the skin on and seasoned with lemon pepper under and on top of the skin. I broiled the whole chicken before putting it in the pot breast down. Also I increased the measurement of the wine ( 1/2 cup) and added 1/2 cup chicken broth in leu of the bullion. I cooked it on low for 9hrs ( so nice when dinner cooks whilst you're at work!) I omitted the potatoes but that was more personal preference than anything. Husband loved it will definitely make again!

I love big bold flavours and was encouraged when I read the reviews. I used thighs and drumbsticks (not a chicken breast fan at all) added more lemon a bay leaf organic chicken broth and some thai chili for a little kick. Cooked on high for 6 hours which turned out to be perfect. However - this dish was as boring as it gets. Had to use Colmans mustard for some flavour. Not worth the time.

For the amount of work I had to put into making this dish I felt it was lacking in the flavor department. Skinning the chicken took me a lot longer than 20 minutes on its own and was very difficult. After cooking in the crock pot all day I felt it came out very bland. The chicken was well cooked though and the potatos were delicious.

I plan to make this soon but wanted to add that Greeks DO use lemon I don t know what the one reviewer was thinking but apparently he is NOT Greek. We use lemon on chicken fish greens salads and my daughter even puts it in her orzo...... we even have a soup called AVGOLEMONO which is Egg-Lemon so I do not know what the reviewer was saying. This recipe sounds perfect for the slow cooker! Thank You!

We are definitely going to try this recipe again with some tweaks from some of the reviews. I loved the flavor of the potatoes but the chicken didn't get the fullness of the flavor like I hoped. The flavor was delicious I just need it to have been absorbed more into the chicken.

Great flavor! I added capers which gave it an extra flavor without adding too much saltiness. I cooked it on the stove top instead of slow cooker. I basically followed the method of cooking I would use for cooking chicken adobo. Worked out well. 9/2017

This was easy and delicious. I did only bone-in chicken breast (which were practically frozen) and left out the veggies. I probably used less olive oil but left the other measurements the same. It was in the slow cooker for almost 9 hours on low and the meat was very tender and fell off the bone. It was great alongside a salad and broccoli for dinner and then I used the leftovers for salads throughout the week. I'll make this again.

We thought this was quite good; very flavourful just the right amount of lemon flavour. I used about half the olive oil chicken thighs instead of a whole chicken and added rosemary.

Good very good. We used chicken breasts instead of a whole bird. The breasts were pretty dry though not sure why. Maybe next time I'll sear them slightly before putting them into the slow cooker.

I thought the potatoes were very good but chicken lacked enough flavor and moist feel. The fresh lemon flavor was overpowered by some other flavor. It was okay to try this recipe but it won't stick with us. Probably a personal preference.

I used 4 large boneless chicken breasts in place of the whole chicken. I thought it was a bit too "lemoney". Next time I will only use 1/2 lemon and and be add garlic and black pepper.

Great flavors and everything in the pantry! I used bone in breasts and a dutch oven browning the meat first then simmering for a couple hours. Flavor was great thickened the sauce to use as a gravy. This tastes like Sunday dinner on a weeknight...

Chicken was tender and the potatoes were perfectly cooked but this recipe is BLAND. Had to add a lot more salt and pepper (and I almost never add salt to my food once it's on my plate) and even splashed on some Italian dressing just to give it flavor. By itself it mostly tastes like olive oil and a hint of wine... and I used MORE garlic than the recipe calls for. Won't make this dish again.

Great easy recipe ! I used chicken breast and sweet potatoes instead. And added a little extra broth / wine .

This recipe was disappointing-- not very flavorful we had to add quite a bit of salt at the table.. I used a 3 1/4 lb. chicken. And followed the recipe with only the few following changes: because other reviewers said the potatoes were too soft I made sure to cut my potatoes very thick maybe a half to 3/4 inch thick; I cut my onions into a half Inch dice I also addeda few baby carrots sliced in half lengthwise on the suggestion of other reviewers (plus I think chicken potatoes and onion is very white -- needs some color). I sprinked the veg liberally with coarse salt while I was layering them.. my grocery store only sells "large" lemons so even after I cut the lemon in half I still had to slice some off the sides so it would fit in the chick cavity I crammed those little slices in there wih the rest of the lemon... I then free-poured about a half cup of Vermouth instead of white wine (I keep vermouth in the kitchen for ooking and always substitute it for WW-- cheaper and doesn't go bad after you open the bottle). Next I used a full cup of chicken broth which I make from HerbOx and a generous drizzle of olive oil. Sprinkled with oregano and dry parsley I set my slow cooker for 6 hours on high after it shut off I put it back on high for another hour an a half.chicken was falling apart (okay by me don't care about presentation) and the veg was cooked perfectly. I need to think about what to do different next time to boost the flavor. Unlike others I didn't fin

I love Greek seasoning and had higher hopes for this dish. It was alright but I thought a little bland. I didn't have a lemon but sprinkled lemon juice inside the cavity and on the outside. I used a cup of chicken broth instead of the boullion granules. I'm also concerned about the MSG in boullion. It didn't need quite that much liquid. Maybe 1/2 cup and adding a little salt would have been good. With a little tweaking I may try it again.

Really quite bland. It's unfortunate. The best thing I can say is that the leftover chicken made for excellent chicken salad the next day! And I will mention that I followed the recipe exactly. Oh well.

I had no lemon so made this recipe without it. It was a hit! Everyone ate it including 3 kids that are picky. As a busy mom I put everything together in the morning and when everyone came home the dinner was ready! BINGO! and it was absolutely mouth watering.
