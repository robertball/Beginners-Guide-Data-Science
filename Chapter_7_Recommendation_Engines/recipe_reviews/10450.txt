Way too much flour, most of my cookie press designs would not work with such a thick dough, and I actually bruised my thumbs, trying to press these out.  I looke at my other cookie press recipies and most call for about 2 to 2 1/2 cups flour NOT 4 CUPS.  I will try these again with less flour.

Revised on 12-24-03:  I made these again today and they turned out great.  I used black cherry jello and increased the butter to 2 cups and added another egg. I kept flour the same. All the cookie press shapes turned out. I only baked for about 6 and a half minutes and they turned nice and golden brown on the bottom.

This was a GREAT recipe, I used the suggested changes from the message board. I used 2 cups margarine, 2 eggs and 4oz of jello for the cookies (boosts the flavor) & 2 oz for sprinkling. They turned out wonderful and after putting them in an airtight container have remained soft and delicious for 2 days. My kids & I can't wait to try other flavours (we used Orange)! Thanks for the recipe and the tips everyone!

I give this recipe three stars for creativity.  It is worth making, but not according to the given directions.  I took this recipe and used 3 1/4 C flour, added 1/4 C butter and added an extra egg.  They then pressed well and baked well, and had a nice mild flavor.  Don't overbake them though.  8 minutes is all you need!

I remember my Mom making these cookies when I was growing up.  I made the mistake of following some of the other reviewers suggestions and they turned out crappy.  The second time I made these I followed the recipe (I used butter instead of margarine)and they turned out perfect.  I did bake them at 400 and I took them out at 6 minutes and they were perfect doneness.

I have been making these cookies for over 40 years.  My recipe says to bake them at 375 degrees.  The time given is too long.  I try 6 minutes, and then check cookies, adding more time if necessary--usually 50 seconds to 1 minute.  The dough is too stiff using 4 cups of flour.  I use 3 1/2 cups.  The butter needs to be soft.  Plus, you cannot mix them very easily unless you use your hands.  Believe me, this works.  There is a knack to using a cookie press.  Not every cookie comes out right.  I put the ones that don't  back in bowl and continue with the next one.  You need to be patient, but it is worth it.

These cookies were awesome! I only used 3 cups of flour and changed butter to 2 cups. I put the dough in the fridge for 1 hour and rolled them to cut out shamrocks for St Patrick's Day. I used the lime flavored gelatin powder which gave it the green color. Perfect touch!

My mom used this recipe for years before I saw it here.  She always used starwberry, and I never thought that the 3 oz. did the flavor any justice.  Now that it is my turn for this recipe, I mix everything together except the gelatin.  I split the whole batch three ways and use half a package of lemon, orange, and strawberry gelatin, adding a touch of lukewarm tap water.  Before baking, I sprinkle a little gelatin on top.  They come out with a bang of fruit flavor and wonderful coloring, and there's enough for two batches!!!

I don't know if I did something wrong or what, but with the 4 cups of flour, the dough came out so hard I couldn't FORCE it thru the cookie press.  I finally gave up and rolled some into balls and used a clay cookie stamp on them.  Baked, they could have been used for skeet targets.  Are you SURE it calls for all that flour?

I read the reviews and tweeked the recipe a bit.  I used 2 sticks of crisco baking sticks instead of margarine, 3 1/4 cup of flour, 2 packages of jello. No problem with feeding it through cookie press.  If you want you can refrigerate it but not needed.  I put in fridge for a bit to do some other kind of cookies then took it out and ran a beater through it and dough was fine.  After placing cookies on pan I sprinkled some jello on top.  They are not too sweet but very easy for a beginner.  We used Island Pineapple and Apricot in the dough and sprinkled with Strawberry/Banana.  Cook for only 6 min and will be just right.

I modified this recipe a bit after reading the other reviews.  Here's what I used -  2 cups margarine (4 sticks, creamed) 3.5 Cups Flour 1 tsp baking powder 4 oz gelatin (strawberry) 1 cup white granulated sugar 1.5 tsp vanilla extract (imitation) 2 eggs A smidge of gelatin powder on top of cookies  First off let me apologize, in case perhaps I did it wrong and that's why they came out the way they did. They came out EDIBLE, good tasting.  Perhaps someone could tell me what I did wrong or if they were supposed to come out like this. I tried them at a bunch of different cooking times, but they always came out looking BAD.  I made so much today (with just one batch) and I cannot even serve them to anyone.  Therefore I give this a 2. If there is something I did wrong, please let me know. I'd love to try again.

I used 3 1/2 cups flour instead of 4 and I had to add a little water to get the dough a little easier to work with. I also used orange jello and a teaspoon of orange extract. The flavour is very good. The dough was hard to get thru the cookie press but my 4 1/2 year old son and I stuck with it and it was worth the effort.

i cut the flour back t 3.5 cups. still the dough jammed up my bon jour cookie press which is battery operated. it simply couldn't handle this stiff dough. so i rolled it and cut it w a darling holly leaf cookie cutter and dusted it w lime jello and red sugar. so cute but utterly inedible. rolling the dough made it tough. a total waste of ingredients. won't do this recipe again.

this recipe has also been in my family since before I can actually remember.  My mother made them every christmas.  I'm not sure what the other reviewers are talking about, my recipe also calls for 4 cups of flour.  I usually add about 3.5 cups and then more as needed.  If you add food coloring to intensify the color, you'll need a little more flour.  I also often add zest and some juice for citrus flavors and this needs a little more flour also.  The dough should be the consistency of stiff frosting when placing it in the cookie gun/press.  I always use baking margerine as the low fat stuff turns out awful!  One batch makes 6-8 dozen cookies.  The only problem is getting rid of them all if you make more than one flavor/color!

Edible but not good. I made these with black cherry jello mix. I burnt the first batch baking at 400 for 10 minutes. The time that ended up working was 350 for 8 minutes. There was barely any flavor, so in the end I dabbed on some cherry extract after they were baked.  I think I am going to have to dip these in chocolate to even make them worth eating.

These were wonderful!  I followed some of the suggested changes, a little more flour, gelatin and margarine.  I did not find the dough too hard to get out of my cookie press, rather the opposite, my dough was very soft.  Also, I did not feel the need to sprinkle gelatin on top, probably just my preference but I did top with a sprinkle of powdered sugar.  I can't wait to take these to work tomorrow!

We tried and tried to make this recipe work, after 4 attempts we gave up. The flavor was just off and the texture was a nightmare in the press. It's just not worth trying to work through a flawed recipe...KEEP LOOKING!

Great taste!  I had a hard time getting dough through the press, next time I may refrigerate it first. I also had to add quite a bit of water to help blend the dough, probably my error.  We used orange jello with lime jello on top... A really big hit with my 4 year old, and my husbands co-workers.  Thanks for this fun recipe!  It will be fun to try different flavors of jello!  Thanks. JuliAnn

This is the second year I've made these and I think they're so cute! I did have to change the temp and time though. Maybe it's just my oven but at 400 degrees for 12 minutes they would be beyond burnt. I dropped down to 350 for about 7-8 minutes and that worked for me. Thanks!

I have used this exact recipe for years. This year I used the changes some of you suggested, and I had a flatter more spread out cookie. I prefer the original, but my press is an electric Wilton, so it is not difficult for me to press the cookies.

We made this recipe several times.  First time too dry, so added some cream to soften it.  Then they burned, so reduced time to 8 minutes and they were ok, held shape, but still browning to fast.  We made them again, adusted the flour, still too dry, more cream.  Baked at a lower temp. (350 degrees) for about 13 minutes, cookies only spread a little.  Better results. Third attempt, 3 cups of flour, much better, but will probably adjust temp. and time next batch.  The flavor depends greatly on the flavor of jello you prefer.

These are good and make a nice extra added color to your cookie tray.  I prefer black cherry.

Will not make these cookies again.  I baked the first batch for the time stated and the bottoms of the cookies were almost black.  I adjusted the time to only 8 minutes and baked until just set but not browned.  They aren't a bad cookie, but not a real good one either.  The flavor wasn't all that great.  Not worth making again.

My twins love these cookies!! They have a great flavor.  Although I found that once the dough gets to warm it is hard to get throught the cookie press.  But to see the look on my girls faces makes it all worth while!!

I love the idea. I used 2 cups of butter and two eggs, but split the recipe in half to use two different flavors of gelatin. In each I used a whole 3 oz package. The flavor was obvious but not overpowering. The changes added worked great with my cookie press, and I'll be making this again.

This cookie not only tasted good, had a good texture, but they are fun and easy to make.  You can adjust the amount of flour to suit your tastes and you can have so many different flavors.  Black Cherry and Lime are my favorites.

This Recipe was really good,I made it with strawberry jello - the actual cookie didn't have much flavor but I sprinkled lots of jello powder on the top, that gave them a great strawberry flavor!! They also burnt easy so you have to watch them. I took them to my hubby's fire Dept..they all enjoyed them!!

This is the recipe my mother had years ago but had lost. I did have to modify it,since I wasn't sure if the recipe actually called for 4 ounces of gelatin. I use a package(3oz.) and a 1/3 of another. I found it fairly easy to use with my press. Plus since I used cherry flavor I added 1/2 tsp. of almond flavoring. It will be a holiday family traditon from now on.

found these cookies really hard when baked and difficult to squeeze out of press.

Thank you, thank you, thank you!  I lost this receipe several years ago.  After several attempts I was able to "mimic" the orginal recipe, but it never was as good as the orginal.  This makes some of the prettiest cookies. I love to make several flavors and freeze the dough so I can serve a rainbow of cookies!

Very bland, I would not use the flavored gelatin. I would use lemon juice or some other kind of concentrated flavoring.

The first time I tried this using other recommendations in the reviews, it didn't work at all.  The only change I did was use unsalted butter (it's what I had at the time) and halved the recipe so I could make another flavor.  It was perfect the 2nd time around. The time was only half in my oven.  I'll still keep the 5 star rating because the rest was fine. I will be making this again.  Thank you!

Oh, on 400, the cookies only took 6 mins to cook.

I used orange flavored Jello.  I think they may be better with lemon flavor.  They were stubborn about releasing from the cookie press, and I finally gave up and used a cookie cutter, instead.  My daughter thought the flavor of these cookies was reminiscent of Fruit Loop cereal.  I’ll give them one more try, as I like to have a variety of cookies in the holiday cookie jar, but I might try icing them instead of sprinkling them with the Jello powder.  Not bad, but not great.

I made these cookies and they had no taste at all. I don't know why? But nobody even touched them after the first bite.

I used butter and sugar-free jello. With only 3 cups of flour, it went through the press fine. I think I will divide it in two and use a different box of jello on each.

The first time I made this recipe I used orange jello. The cookies tasted good but I was unable to put them through my cookie press. I used 3.5 cups of flour because the other reviews said the extra flour messed up the dough. I don't make a ton of cookies and have never used a cookie press before now. I looked up how to use it and found out my cookie press only worked on a certain type of dough. I just rolled the dough into balls and it took about 16 minutes to cook. Not the best cookies I've ever had but still pretty good.

I made 2 batches of this recipe. one with the suggestions and one following the recipe direct. i found following the direct recipe worked better. the dough is real stiff, but it wouldn't work in the cookie press other wise. tasty cookies. I made one with strawberry banana gelatin and one with berry blue. the berry ones had a better flavor.

I followed it exactly but the dough would not have made very good press cookies. I spooned them on the pan and took them out a little doughy. Blueberry. Yum! Dipped them in syrup.

I have been making this recipe as written for many years (since I found it in a Jell-O advert).  I had trouble with burning till I got AirBake cookie sheets.  Now it works well.  One thing is to really cream the butter/margarine till it changes color.  The wreaths, heart, Christmas tree come out the best when I do it.  I use a Wear Ever Cookie Gun which I only recently discovered is now a "retro" item!
