I am not vegan but promised a friend who is that I would make these and bring her the leftovers. I found out that  vegan products are expensive! On that note, I made my own vegan parm by mixing cashews, yeast, garlic powder, and salt in a food processor. And since I had already bought the soy milk and only needed 2 tablespoons of mayo, I made my own vegan mayo as well. These turned out pretty good. I wouldn't go as far to say I liked them better than regular mashed potatoes (I missed the real butter flavor) but they were good.

I was skeptical but I had all the ingredients except bay leaves-I used dried chives instead. It was creamy and very yummy.

Next time I’m going to double or triple the recipe cause I used 4 large potatoes and it was barely enough for 3 people, but other than that this recipe is amazing! I’d cook the potatoes a little longer than it says because mine were slightly undercooked but they were very creamy and everybody in my family liked this recipe a lot.

Good but I’ve made better with soy milk. Maybe I didn’t like the bay leaf.

Great recipe! I added some olive oil to it for some extra creaminess and it really made the difference!
