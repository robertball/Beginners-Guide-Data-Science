I make a recipe just like this (same ingredients) called Calico Beans.  They are soooooo good!  My hubby would eat this every day if he could.

These were really good!  A little too sweet for my husband's tastes, but my daughter and I really enjoyed them.

Everyone Loved it! I cut down the pork and beans to 1 can and then cut back the sauce ingredients. Next time Iâ€™ll double the meat and kidney beans and leave the pork and beans at 2. Family wanted more leftovers.
