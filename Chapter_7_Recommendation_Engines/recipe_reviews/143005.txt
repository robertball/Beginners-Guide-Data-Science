What a refreshing salad!  My store didn't have green grapes, so I used red.  With the blue cheese dressing and walnuts, everyone raved about it.  Next time, I would add blue cheese chunks to give it an extra kick.

I liked these. I used red grapes and some left over toasted walnuts. I also tried pecans and pistachios. I didn't care much for the pistachios but thought the pecans were every bit as good as the walnuts. These were fun to make, fun to eat. Not a repeat for Hubs though.

Made this for a potluck and got rave reviews.  Might try adding craisins the next time around!  Definitely will make again.

We didn't care for this, especially the walnuts.

I used red grapes.  I made the mistake of pouring dressing directly into the salad instead of measuring, and I over-poured.  It was too rich like that and I didn't have enough grapes and walnuts to double the recipe, so I added some diced celery.  Turned out lovely looking and tasting!
