My husband and son LOVED this pizza!  I followed the recipe with no changes.  The "Birds EyeÂ® Recipe Ready Pizza Supreme Blend" made this so simple to prepare.  This is definitely a keeper!

We had a pizza potluck at church and I made this recipe, I did add some italian sausage. I admit I was nervous about using frozen vegetables on a pizza but it saved me a lot of time and you couldn't tell they were frozen. Very tasty.

Daughter and I loved the pizza. She is not a green pepper lover but said she might just change her mind from now on. Just the right amount of topping and no chopping. Quick, easy, tasty,,what more can you ask for!
