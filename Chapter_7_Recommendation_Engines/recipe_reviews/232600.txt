We were picnicking from a cooler, so we needed a hefty, filling side dish that could be eaten cold. This was flavorful, fresh, and super easy to make (we just bought bacon bits which made it even easier). My husband is pretty picky and he ate this happily. If you don't like that dijon mustard tang, though, steer clear because this is full of it.

I absolutely loved this! They were giving away samples of this at my local grocery store. I promptly bought all the ingredients & ran home & made it. Now I make it with pineapple tidbits ... just smaller bites, haha. I love rice & bacon but try to eat each, only once or twice a month. Spice it up if you think it needs it, but try it!
