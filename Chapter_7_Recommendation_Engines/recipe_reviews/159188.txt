This is a very very easy and delicious recipe.  The only change was that I used apple cider instead of juice and added one thinly sliced onion to the cooker.  The gravy is incredible and pairing this meat with mashed potatoes was perfect.    We had unexpected guests who also loved this dish.  I was leary because I slow cooked a venison roast before and wasnt thrilled with the result.  I will keep this recipe and use for both venison and beef.

Instead of apple juice, I added a cup of sliced apples and it was fantastic. I also added an extra tablespoon of cold water so the apples wouldn't stick to the bottom of the crock pot. Great Recipe.

Made a very interesting flavor to our meal.  Served it with potato dumplings and used the gravy over them.  It turnied out nice and tender.  I made it according to the directions that were given and think it will be used again in the future.  Thanks for sharing!

I've made this 2 times now and it is excellent! Both times the roast came out so tender and shredded with a fork. I did experiment a little the second time because I like mine a little spicy. I added a dash of crushed red peppers along with some horeseradish and it turned out good too. This is one of those kinds of recipes where if you like venison this makes it even better and if you don't like venison, well you can tolerate it. With hubby being a hunter, you can be sure I will be making this recipe time and time again. Thank you!

This is a great recipe!  I like finding new things to do with venison!  I added a little worchester sauce to the recipe.  Will definately make again sometime!  Thanks for sharing.

I used apple juice the first time I made this and found it to be too sweet; I now use about 1/2 cup natural (no sugar added) apple sauce.  I also sub teriyaki sauce for the soy, and add garlic, pepper, and sliced onions to the pot.  It turns out perfect that way!

We really liked the flavor of this recipe. I had to make an adjustment when I found we were out of soy sauce. I used a teriyaki marinade sauce instead. I also cut back the brown sugar to about a 1/4 cup. My slow cooker took about 7 hours to get it to the fork tender stage.

This is a great basic recipe.  I make one very similar with the following adaptations:  applesauce instead of apple juice, 1/4 cup apple cider vinegar, 1/2 can undiluted frozen orange-pineapple juice, 2 large crushed cloves garlic, 1 thinly sliced sweet onion.  I also add enough water to coat the roast, otherwise it dries out. Goes to show you the original is a good basic recipe, and folks should experiment to their own taste.  Thanks for posting!!

The gravy is very good.  Pineapple juice is equally as good as apple juice in the recipe.  My meat had fully cooked after three hours, so watch the time.  I needed to heat my gravy in the microwave on high for 10 minutes and whisk it in order to thicken it properly.  I will make this again.

Very good! I used a venison rump roast and added minced garlic and chopped onion. Also added about 1/4 tsp crushed red pepper. I did not strain the meat broth but left all the yummy bits of meat, garlic and onion in with it. I decided to use up 1/2 a roasted sweet red bell pepper I had so cut it into small pieces and threw it in after the roast was done and the gravy thickened. I served this over white rice. The meat was not super juicy, but it was much more tender then if I had cooked the roast in the oven. And it was just as moist as a beef rump roast I used to make Italian beef out of the week before.

very good recipe! i'm not a hunter but i do get deer meat from folks from time to time and this was the best i've had.  i had to cook the roast for alot longer than the time listed( about 12 hours on low) until the meat was very tender like i like deer to be.  all of that time did cook the "wild' flavor out of the meat but still had a distinct flavor.

not a fan of roasts or any cuts of venison besides the backstraps and tenderloins, but this was great! my husband, who is very picky, but is a hunter, loved it, as did my mom who doesn't like venison either! i even used a shoulder and neck roast, i believe. it was so tender and tasty! i used cider instead of apple juice, since that's what i had - not sure if it makes a difference.

Great recipe.... can easily be adaptable... makes a great tasting gravy/sauce.  I omitted the salt as there is more than enough salt in the soy sauce (I used sodium reduced soy and this was still sufficient enough salt).  Cooked my roast for 11 hours on low and it came out perfect... thanks for the great recipe!

BEAUTIFUL!  Everyone raved about this recipe that I prepared with venison freshly-butchered from the field (my little 13-year old neighbor's first deer!!).  It is a wonderful recipe that cooks up with ZERO gaminess and a lot of yummy flavor.  Will def use again!

I'm not a big venison fan, but since I'm married to a hunter, I need to find ways to eat it. This was very good! I always marinate/defrost my venison in coffee to remove the gamey flavor and did that for about 48 hours prior to cooking this. I made the recipe as directed adding 1 sliced Vidalia onion and 1 clove of chopped garlic. I only cooked it for about 4.5 hours but it was still over done. Next time, I would not cook it more than 3 hours. The flavor was great though and our kids didn't know it was venison at all. I will definitely make again but cook less time.

I feel the sauce is wayyy to sweet (as is).. Ive made this twice now, and made a few changes which now I feel makes its a 5 star recipe. I suggest using 3/4 cup or LESS of the brown sugar, add crushed red pepper and garlic. I sautted peppers and onions in a frying pan and then added it to the gravy when i added the cornstarch-This is a MUST! My cook time was much less, app 3.5 hours.Thank you for a great recipe

This is the first time I have ever cooked venison. I chose this recipe because I had everything I needed on hand. Definitely worth it!  I confess I did not read the instructions correctly, and so I mixed all the ingredients and poured them over the roast, potatoes, and carrots in my crockpot. However, the end result was delicious - though  sweeter than perhaps normally would be.   (I used cider instead of unsweetened apple juice also)

It was really yummy.  I have never made Venison before so I was looking for something easy, this was.  I do wonder why it asked for 1 cup of Brown Sugar?? I would make it again with a few tweeks :)

My husband and I wanted to try a new recipe, but found this is not one of our favs.  This roast was dry and sweet.  The brown sugar made a gravy impossible.  Way too sweet.  Will never make again.

I was very nervous about trying the meat after smelling it cooking all day. It wasn't very pleasant. My husband and cousin even commented on how weird it smelled. However, I am very happy with how it turned out. It was very tender and had excellent flavor. The gravy was a bit salty. I served it with mashed potatoes and a salad. This recipe is a keeper. Thanks!!

EXCELLENT recipe!! I cook a lot of elk and venison, and this is one of the best recipes I've found. The gamey flavor was completely gone, and the sauce is incredible! My only complaint is that the meat ended up a little dry, but it's almost impossible with venison roast because it's so lean. I'm going to try this with elk, and maybe even duck breast. YUM!
