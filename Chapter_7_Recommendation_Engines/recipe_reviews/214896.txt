I have been looking for a great pozole recipe for a long time, and this is it! I made a few modifications: I used 2 lbs of pork stew meat (already cut in chunks), and 1 1/2 lb pounds of espinazo (pork back bones), no pasilla on hand, so added 4 ancho and 4 guajillo, increased the garlic to 4 cloves. For the final step, I used a 32oz container of chicken broth and added 6 more cups of water because I used a 6lb can of hominy. The flavor is amazing! Don't forget to garnish with shredded cabbage, chopped onion, chopped radishes, and lime or lemon juice. I will definitely make this again.

Don't like having to put the dish in a seperate pot from the slow cooker - I just added in the hominy and let it go for half an hour on high.  Other than that, this was great!

This is a good recipe, but I would highly recommend adding Mexican oregano or regular oregano if you don't have Mexican on hand.  I had this at a friend's house last weekend and was looking for a copycat recipe and this is fairly close.  Don't be fooled by all the peppers used in this recipe.  It's not spicy at all.  


Edit:  Okay, so I had my friends over after the first time making this, so I'm changing my rating.  Based on the way I was told they make it, I made the following changes.  Use 3 guajillo and 3 ancho chiles.  Leave out the pasilla as it makes it taste more like an American chili.  Second, is toast the peppers first.  Use a tablespoon of olive oil and saute them with the onions on medium high heat until the onions are going translucent, then add the cumin seeds and garlic, then continue following the recipe.  Toasting the peppers doesn't seem like a big deal, but it makes all the difference in the world as far as bringing out the flavors.  I doubled the recipe and used 6 guajillo and 6 ancho peppers along with a 6 lb can of hominy.  Use low sodium chicken broth, garnish with cabbage, onions, cilantro, sliced radishes and hot sauce and you've got a tasty, healthy meal.

This is a wonderful pozole. The only change I made was using homemade chicken stock. Oops, I also didn't do the last step....by accident. i just threw the hominy in the crockpot and heated it that way. I did not know if the peppers were fresh or dried, but I was only able to find one of the chilis fresh and so I used dried for the two other chilis. This is terrific and I will make it again and again. Thanks so much for sharing Isabel!

This recipe was okay, but the best way to make pozole is to omit the canned hominy, and buy the fresh/frozen variety.  I find it in my frozen veggie aisle at my supermarket.  It takes a bit longer to make, but well worth the effort.

Currently making another batch of this with some minor tweaks due to food allergies (Dr. certified onion allergy (but not garlic!! Weird, but running with it)). Rating this a 4 because the tweak I made that sells it for me is a flavor addition. So changes:

*Omit onion; upped garlic to about 2-3 Tbsp rough chopped pieces (because I love garlic and to make up for the onion omit)

*Toasted (dried) peppers (per another review's suggestion) prior to toasting cumin seeds, then proceeded as normal; using ancho, guajillo, and New Mexico dried peppers because that's what our store carries

*Winning tweak: added a large pinch or two of dried Mexican oregano (per review suggestion, and dried because slow cooker), maybe up to 2 tsp (I love oregano)

The sauce is already incredible; this time around I'm using pork, beef, and chicken because that's what I happened to have enough of on hand. Excited for dinner tonight and lunch all week!

I made this and I've been told it's the best Pozole by even my most qualified friends who know good Mexican food. I prepare it slightly different then this recipe.  I use a pressure cooker.  I make the purée as the recipe calls for and place it on the side.  I cut the pork shoulder into 1 and a half inch cups and salt it liberally.  I then put the pork cuts into the pressure cooker and poor the purée over it and also add the chicken stock.  I boil it under pressure for an hour.  I add the hominy and mix and let sit for 5 minutes, it's ready to label into a bowl and serve with diced onion and cilantro to top it off.  The meet is so tender, I can cut it with a spoon and the broth is perfect.  One of my favorite things to make.

2nd time making this... I tweaked it. I doubled the garlic, used 2 chicken breasts instead of pork & did 2 guajillo, 2 pasillo ancho & 2 New Mexico chilis. My kids loved it... Oh & if you can find it Goya hominy is much softer than other brands...

I did add the dried chili and rehydrated and blended in the blender as notted. However, I added a jar of Trader Joe's Hatch Salsa and this rounded out what I consider a good Mexican pork stew. Living in LA area, believe me this dish is everywhere.   For me, I have to have to green salsa in this type of dish.  If you don't have a Trader Joes, add Herdez green salsa or whatever you can find in your area, even if all you can find is green enchilada sauce.  This really makes the layers of flavors pop.

I use this recipe a lot and it comes out amazingly each time! Just as great if you can only find 2 of the 3 peppers, or dried instead of fresh peppers (just soak overnight). I've also put in the slow cooker for half the time over high and the pork is just as tender.

Great recipe. I have made this so many times!  I also tend to do it on stove top instead of slow cooker (it requires a lot of dishes/ kitchen tools to make!)

The only thing I changed was the amount of water added to the crockpot after all the ingredients were in. I didn't want a watery soup. The flavor was AMAZING and even more so when I served it with sour cream, avocado and lime slices. My husband is an extremely picky eater and I could not keep him away from it.

I just love this and is now a regular for us!  My favorite part is to squeeze a nice amount of fresh lime over the top!  I have made with pork and boneless skinless chicken thighs, and preferred the chicken.

My modifications... 
*I didn't measure but cut it down by about 1/2 for my audience size. 
*Used the 'A' and the 'G' peppers only. 
*Used pork
*Canned white hominy but missed the snap and juiciness of corn so may swap that next time. 
*Used knorr chicken bouillon cubes instead of stock. 2 1/2 for about 4 cups of water 
*Pretty sure powdered cumin would've been fine
*Could have had more punch so next time may add some of the pepper seeds. 
Have to serve with: sliced radish, cabbage, cilantro, and onion.

I had heard tell of how good traditional pozole is and this was really good, just not quite as good as I imagined it would be. I wonder if this could be because I had to use all dried peppers, except for the fresh pasilla peppers I found. However, it was definitely  yummy enough that I would make it again. I tried it both traditionally with cabbage and lime juice, and gringo style with sour cream, cilantro, and cabbage and both were good, but I did like the flavor and contrast that both the sour cream and cilantro gave it.

Loved it! so easy and the flavor was great - even my (Mexican) mother AND kids approved! I got pork shoulder with the bone-in and kept it in while it cooked to add to the flavor. Add some cabbage, lime, and cilantro when served with corn tortillas - perfecto! I will definitely be making this again.

This was a hit on a cold & rainy night. I made a few adjustments out of necessity (added some fresh peppers from garden & chopped radish greens...also, chopped up some chipotle in adobo from a can when I didn't find enough dried peppers...I always add fresh lime juice as well) But, this is an excellent base for pozole.

Great soup! We love soups of all types and this is one of the very best. We’ve never had pozole before but we will certainly be having it again regularly. The dried chiles really make this soup, the flavor is amazing. Thanks so much for posting.

This was a good recipe and tasteful.  I did change the meat, as we do not eat pork and I used roast instead.  We had leftovers and it tasted better the next day.   I used for toppings radishes and shredded cabbage.  I will be making this again but with chicken next time.

Super easy to make and very delicious! I used green chilis because we prefer their flavor and slightly less chicken stock.

We loved it. I trimmed the big fat off of the pork but it still generated a surprising amount of fat  drains right off, though.

Winter comfort food! I have to get the hominy at Whole Foods or the Latin market.

Good basic recipe,mix or match the chilis to taste. I use pork stew meat and simmer together in a pot, doesn't take as long, and i dont care for shredded meat in soup. I also add a few chili d'arbol with the chilis for a little bite, whitch the original recipe lacks.
