Recipe submitter here!  I'm glad the reviewers so far like the popsicles :)  One little change is that I don't blend the cookies until they're fine crumbs, coarse crumbs are good.  Allrecipes changed the directions a bit when they published it.  I think it's nice to have some little hunks of cookie in the popsicles though so don't worry if your blender doesn't do the best job of completely pulverizing the cookies!

Surprizingly good--I really was taken aback. I followed the recipe exact, only using sugar free cheesecake pudding and fat free evaporated milk. This recipe was just right for what I had on hand and I was able to use my small food processor for both crushing the cookies and making strawberry puree. I used little dixie cups for these pops and once they'd gotten firm, I just stuck popsicles sticks in the little cups. This way, you could just peel down the cup "wrapper" and go to town. Great change on your usual frozen pop recipe.

These were really good! I used sugar free pudding, because that was the only cheesecake flavor I could find. I thought it was perfect :) cant wait to make again! Thanks for a great recipe!

I followed this recipe as written and using whole milk. They were pretty good, but both my daughter and I thought the cookie cheesecake part was super sweet and clashed somewhat with the strawberry part, giving the strawberries a bitter tang.  Maybe adding more sugar to the strawberries would help that, or possibly swirling the mixture thoroughly before pouring, instead of layering. I would have polled the boys on what they thought, but they were out the door like a shot with them and I never heard any complaints later! So, we'll give this recipe a solid 4 stars :)

These were amazing! They only lasted two days in the freezer before we gobbled them up. The only change I made in the recipe was to add a dash of kosher salt to the pudding and cookie crumb mixture to balance the sweetness, and I did use sugar-free pudding mix and fat-free milk. The pops are sort of reminiscent of the strawberry shortcake pops you can buy at the store, but the texture is very different and the strawberry flavor is more intense. This recipe made eight standard pops for me. Thanks so much for sharing!

These are delicious! Used the sugar free cheesecake jello b/c that's all I could find, and whole milk.  I hand crushed the cookies in a sandwich bag, the chunks were delicious when frozen.  I did not understand the other reviews saying it was too sweet; in fact, I think I should have done a quick re-blend of the strawberry mixture before filling the molds because I thought the strawberry mixture could have been a little sweeter!  Perhaps the sugar fell to the bottom of the blender.  I digress - this was awesome, a must make!

Love, love, love this recipe.  Next time I will try with vanilla pudding as my oldest daughter does not like cheesecake.  Only trouble I had (and always have) is getting them removed from the molds.  I am definitely going to try the Dixie cup idea next time.

kids loved them. I wonder if you can use yogurt instead of the pudding mix? I will try it and let you all know.

Made the pops today with the kids and they turned out great! We used vanilla instant pudding mix and added a few more strawberries to the recipe. We also used 16 vanilla wafers instead of the oreos.

I like these but next time I make them I think I will use more strawberries and less pudding in each pop.  We felt that the cheesecake pudding flavor overpowered the strawberries.  Great flavors, though, and very easy to make.  I used sugar free pudding and 2% milk.  Thanks for the recipe, The Bunny Chef!

Too much shortcake and not enough strawberry -- one berry per pop is just not enough.  Will be adjusting the other way next time.

They were really easy and good, next time I think I'll try to swirl the layers together more.

This was quite tasty. I added vanilla to the pudding mixture and some lemon juice to the strawberries, and then it was even better.

This was pretty good but not exceptional.  Of course, I did make a few changes.  I used vanilla pudding mix, and I used graham crackers instead of oreos.  Also, I got 12 pops instead of 8.  My molds must have been smaller.  Overall, it is a good and easy frozen treat.

My kids loved it!  I will layer the strawberry part with the pudding part more times when I make it again.

Wow, this stuff is good NOT frozen also!  (I ate the extra that didnt fit in the molds.)  I added a bit of coconut into the pudding mixture, and sugar free cheesecake pudding mix.  What a great way to cheat your diet :)
