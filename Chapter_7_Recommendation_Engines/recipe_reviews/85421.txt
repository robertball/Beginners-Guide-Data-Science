Very good, and if you use the pan drippings to make a gravy it makes it even more delicious.

It may be because my lemon tree makes HUGE lemons (I had over a quarter cup juice) but this was very lemony. The adults enjoyed it, the kids found it overwhelming. They added sweet teriyake sauce to balance the lemon flavor. Next time I may try and find a smaller lemon, or add some honey or something to balance the sourness.

Eh...I was not overly impressed.  This wasn't bad, by any means...it just wasn't anything special.  I'll keep looking for a quick and easy chicken recipe...I probably will not make this again.

Would have liked more sauce to pour over the chicken.  I'd never done chicken under the boiler before so this was different....but good!  Would probably add some wine and or hot sauce for depth next time.  Mushrooms would also be a good addition, if you had them.

This was a great fast meal for the family! It was so easy to prepare. Instead of chicken breast I used thighs, but it was still so good.  I did cook it a little bit longer, but perhaps because I used thighs with bone.It is now a family favorite, my husband and daughters loved it so much, it left them asking for more, thank you for the great recipie, the name truly fits it tasty chicken. Thanks

What I did was used a half of a lemon, and then added cream of mushroom soup to the mixture.  Use only about 1/4 cup of water or less for a creamy mixture.  It only had a hint of lemon and the soup made a nice sauce, it was very tasty with the soup.

This recipe is a good base. My family and I found that the lemon was overpowering. As is, it's so-so. It was suggested that it could be set to low broil at first, but forwards the end have it set to a high broil to give it a crisp.

THis was really easy to cook. I used split chicken breast, and it worked out nice.  They were so moist, and the flavor was just enough. THere is a bit of bite from the lemon, so beware if you don't like that.   I served it with brown rice and yellow squash/zuiccnie/onions and fresh  whole garlic, seasoned, then roasted, then broiled with the chicken on the lower rack.
