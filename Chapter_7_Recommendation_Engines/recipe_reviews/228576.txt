These crescents are very tasty and definitely remind me of a BLT without the L! I used the Seamless dough and got 4 good sized sandwiches. I would recommend crumbling the bacon. I made 2 using crumbles and found they folded much easier and were easier for young ones to eat. I also put cheese on 2 and those gave an even better cheesy flavor. Next time I might change around the ingredients and seasonings but on the whole, great recipe. I love the flakiness of the Pillsbury Crescents and this recipe showcases it very well.

I made these for a light, quick and easy lunch.  We really enjoyed them.  I loved the burst of flavor that the tomato gave.  I would definitely make these again.

Because I saw that some reviewers had issues keeping the ingredients inside the crescents, I crumbled the bacon and chopped the tomato into smaller bits and folded them into the mayonnaise/cheese mixture. I then divided the filling into quarters and spooned it into the middle of each crescent quarter. Not a bad quick dinner idea. It was just my kids and I and it fed the four of us but if you have a bigger crew, you're going to want to double it at least. I served this with a huge vegetable platter with lowfat ranch dip which made a lighter main dish okay.

These turned out better than expected.  I altered the directions to make it easier though: Instead of rectangles, I cut them in half again for smaller squares.  Then spread the cheese/mayo mix on, topped half of each with the bacon-which I crumbled, then the diced tomato, and then folded in half and pinched together to form little triangles.  Tasted pretty decent served with lettuce and ranch.  Hubby gave these 4 stars.

Delicious! I used mozzarella instead because that's all I had, and it was perfect! I would definitely use seamless dough, a few fell apart at the seams.

I really liked these. Great flavor. My husband wasn't thrilled about the mayo combination in them but I liked the flavor that it added.

We thought these were just OK.  I had problems keeping the specified ingredients locked into the Crescents, and they crumbled on me.  They needed a little more in the flavor area!  I did add more cheese to the top to make them cheesier.  Thanks for the idea of these.

It was just okay. I love bacon and cheese but I felt the roll overpowered the flavor of the bacon, and the cheese oozed out so much that very little cheese was left in the roll. I won't make this recipe again.

This was a quick and easy recipe that tasted good. It has bacon so it has to be good. It is like a BLT without the Lettuce. I used the crescent rolls and it probably would have been a little easier to fold up if I had used the crescent sheets. Next time I might add a little ranch dressing or jalape√±os for a variation. Thanks for a quick and easy recipe.

These were a big hit! I'm only giving it four stars because on its own, its pretty simple and doesn't have a lot of wow factor. However, as a change of pace for dinner, my family really liked them. I will be making these again as they were quick, easy and yummy.
