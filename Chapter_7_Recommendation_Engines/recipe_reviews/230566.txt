These turned out very well.  Not the same boring ham one would traditionally have.  I did add the 2 tsp of liquid smoke as the video showed.  This made the taste much better.  One more thing to not is make sure to stir or rotate the chops every night so that they coat evenly in the brine.

Very tasty!  Just had them for dinner, and they're so cute too......although it was good, I'm not too fond of mustard glaze, so I think I'll make something sweet next time to offset the salt in the ham...it wasn't overly salty, but I think it needs something sweet to perk it up.  One of the best things about them though is having no fat running through them, they're  just nice and tender and meaty.  I think these are going on my Valentines Day menu, with a raspberry brown sugar glaze, and I'll cut them into heart shapes and serve two per person...the scraps will be great for pea soup. Try this recipe, it's really quite good.

Brined for 2 1/2 days.  Dried thoroughly.  Cooked as directed.  Came out excellent.  Added liquid smoke second day as it is not mentioned in printed recipe.  I bought a whole pork loin and got 6 nice chops for recipe.  Ground the rest (including fat) and made breakfast sausage patties.   Added cherry juice to glaze and a cherry on hamlet.  Really enjoyed making this and result was an A-1 keeper!
