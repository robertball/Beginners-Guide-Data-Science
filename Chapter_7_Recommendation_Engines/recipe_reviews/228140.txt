Oh, WOW, this is FANTASTIC! I halved the recipe, using some beautiful, ripe tomatoes from my dad's garden. I'm now wishing that I made the whole recipe b/c I can't stop eating it, lol. After tasting it, my first thought was crackers w/ cream cheese and this on top...AWESOME! I also plan on trying this on hot dogs/smoked sausages and grilled chicken, which I think would be wonderful. When this first started to boil/cook, I was worried b/c the tomato skins were coming off and I thought I should've peeled them first, but once it was all done, everything was 'candied' and you couldn't even tell. Mine took less than an hour to fully thicken, so maybe just keep an eye on it while it's going so it doesn't burn. I will def be making this often...it's super easy and super good~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

So glad I gave this a whirl.  I cut back the sugar to 3/4 cup and it is still sweet.  Since my bacon wasn't that smokey, I also added a bit of liquid smoke.  As it was cooking down, I drizzled some over grilled zucchini and "Oh MY!"  I think I will add some chili powder next time just for my taste and cut back the sugar a little more so it is a little more savory.  Thanks for posting the recipe!!!

YUM YUM YUM!

After I saw this recipe this morning, I rushed to the nearest Wal-Mart (30 miles) and got my ingredients. After dinner, I whipped it up and we did the taste test. My husband and brother-in-law loved it, as did I. The smell at first was a little odd to me, as I'm pregnant, but once it started really cooking down, I found myself tasting it and loving every different stage more and more. 

I look forward to making more this sunday for my husband to take to the teacher's lounge on monday. I am sure we will get more great reviews then. Thank you for a wonderful recipe. :)

I am doing something I HATE when other people do, which is to review a recipe which I changed.  But I think my input may be valuable so here I go. 

I mostly followed the recipe except: first I doubled it, with a pound of bacon, which turned out to be fortunate because everyone loved it.  Since there are no nice fresh tomatoes to be had at this time of year, I used three 24 oz. cans of whole peeled tomatoes.  I did NOT double the sugar, only used one cup. And finally, I whirled the whole shebang briefly in the food processor because I thought it would look nicer - there remained some unappealing-looking lumps of the fatty part of the bacon, even though I cooked it very well.  

My finished product, though slightly different from the original recipe, was a huge hit - simply served on crackers. But almost everyone felt that it was maybe just a tad too sweet (even at half the sugar).  So I will definitely make it again but put less sugar (I'll try 3/4 cup with the double recipe) and I will also throw in a handful of oil cured sun-dried tomato to up the savory content.  I think then it will be insanely good.  

(One final thought, you cook this for so long that I don't think I would ever bother starting with good fresh tomatoes - I'd rather use them for something where they stay closer to their natural state. It's so much easier to use canned and still tastes great.)

Me and my oldest son were bored this evening so we decided to give this recipe a shot. I didn't have any fresh tomatoes so we used canned petite diced so we cut the recipe in half in case it didn't work with the canned variety. It did! We loved loved this its so good! We made bagel chips to eat with it very very yummy!

I happened to stumble upon this recipe recommended on the Buzz.  Perfect timing, as I had some late tomatoes in my garden to use up before the frost did them in.  I only had regular bacon, so I decided to add a bit of cumin to lend some smoky flavor.  This is amazing- absolutely delicious!  Thanks for sharing a great recipe :)

We had an a bunch of cherry tomatoes from the garden and I needed a new recipe to use them up. Found this, tried it, LOVE it! My husband and daughter were a little nervous because it's called a "jam" but thought it was delicious. Made it exactly as the recipe except reduced the bacon to 3 strips (that's what I had on hand). I would reduce the sugar a bit because of the sweeter tomatoes and would up the amount of bacon, but I will absolutely make this again. And again. Try it on toasted french bread with a smear of goat cheese topped with the jam. Yummy!

Delicious!  I was looking for something to take to a party and stumbled upon this.  it sounded so good, I made a double batch to make sure I'd have some leftover...and so glad I did because it was gone quickly at the party.  I cut the salt back just a little (although I think it would have been fine at the suggested amount) and forgot to add the optional hot sauce.  I simply served it with pieces of crusty bread and it was very yummy.  The next day, I had some on a bagel with cream cheese and it was super good.

Very delicious, I too cut the sugar down from 1C to 1/2C and its still sweet enough. Next time I will also cut the salt back from 1 &1/2t to 1t. Additionally, I might skin the tomatoes next time. I personally dislike when the skins fall off and curl up in a recipe. Very delicious, looking forward to having it on some nice toasted bread with Goat cheese!

I am writing a review to confess my errors in making this recipe.  I had only 1-1/2 lbs of tomatoes and 1/2 lb. of bacon, so I thought I'd be fine as many reviewers commented that they'd like more bacon.  

I reduced the amount of sugar to 2/3 cup and the cider vinegar to 2 Tbs, which was perfect, BUT I reduced the salt only slightly, and it is super salty :-(

It still tastes "great," I can tell I just O.D.ed on the salt... Just a thought for those who want to add bacon to the recipe, CUT DOWN ON THE SALT.

SO good!  I've made this two years in a row, both quadruple batches (2 pounds of bacon - takes quite a bit longer to reduce down this way, but it's worth it 'cause everyone wants a jar for themselves!).  It's great to use up the end of summer tomatoes.  I like to add a can of Chipotle Chilies in Adobo, all chopped up, for a touch of smoke and heat.   I also mix the finished jam 50/50 with mayonaise for a quick sandwich spread, like on steak sandwiches.  Even my ketchup/tomato hating boyfriend eats it up!

Wow! Just wow! Such delicious depth of flavor and satisfaction.  I went a little wild today at the farmers' market so needed some quick things to make with heirloom tomatoes. I made a half-recipe, reduced the sugar slightly (from the half Cup split), added about 1/2t of minced garlic and a shake or two of cayenne pepper.  Now wish I'd doubled or tripled it! If nobody minds, I think I'll just eat it straight out of the jar.

This is AMAZING! My boyfriend and I loved this! After reading all the reviews, I went ahead and made the full batch and I'm so glad I did. As other reviewers suggested, I added a little liquid smoke and a dash of cumin since my bacon didn't have a smoked flavor. Mine cooked down in a little less than an hour, but all of the ingredients caramelized beautifully and blended so well. We did the taste test on crackers with cream cheese, but I also plan on topping off a bagel with it and possibly on some eggs. This really would be good on anything! I imagine it would compliment pork very well. The only I will do differently next time is cut back on the salt, but yes, there will be a next time!

Love this recipe-have had many requests for the recipe.  I serve it with crackers and cream cheese.  My husband uses it on fish.  A great way to use up those tomatoes when you are tired of canning.

YU-MMY! I used a white onion (blanched in salt water to cut the acidity) because that's what I had on hand, and only added 3/4 c. of sugar like another reviewer suggested and it came out great. I will try using a bit less sugar next time. Good stuff :)

Rave reviews from carnivores! A true hit with guys especially! A great party favorite. It’s sure to be a welcomed addition to any gathering any time of the year. This goes as a splendid accompaniment to virtually everything. Heck! I think it would even make ice cream better!

It was good. I cut the sugar in 1/2 and it was still too sweet for my tastes. I think I am going to try it without any sugar next time or maybe just a Tablespoon of sugar and add more at the end if it needs it. I also would use a small onion or only 1/2 an onion. The recipe has a lot of potential.

This was a huge hit as part of my Charcuterie board for Thanksgiving. Served with garlic toast pieces, the family couldn't get enough. I did cut back on the sugar to 3/4 cup rather than 1 cup as others have tried and this did help balance the sweet and savory better for my tastes. Will definitely make again!

I doubled the recipe, cut the sugar in half and added bit of hickory smoked salt & cumin, plus 2 cloves of minced garlic and a finely diced jalapeño. This will be great poured over cream cheese and served with crackers or on top of baked Brie. Yum!!

We had a bumper crop of tomatoes.  First batch I made, I followed the recipe exactly.  I used applewood thick cut bacon. Tasty!  Second batch I made, I used Kirkland (Costco) regular cut hickory smoked bacon and added 2 finely chopped jalapeños. Excellent!  Thank you for a great recipe!   BTW, I didn’t peel the tomatoes but I did squeeze out some of the seeds and juice.

makes about 3 cups the way I did it.  I suspect it depends on how long you choose to reduce it.  Nice on grilled cheese or over cream cheese for an appetizer with crackers.  Update:  Amazing on toast with fried egg and on hamburger!

I used about half Romas and half "regular" tomatoes, and this is delicious!  I'll make it again and again.

Made as per recipe with the exception of the sugar. I subbed a glug of maple syrup and summered to jam consistently, about 4 hours. Great as a spread on sourdough toast. Used up a collage of small multi colored tomatoes left over from a previous recipes

when I saw all the great reviews for this I had to try it. OMG it is delicious! I used sriracha sauce for the heat and increased it to about 2-3 teaspoons. I could sit and eat it right out of the jar nevermind put it on something. Lots of great suggestions, here is mine. It would taste great on hot dogs or bratwurst!!

This was a huge hit! I doubled the recipe (except the sugar). I also added a chipotle pepper in Adobe sauce. Served with cream cheese and crackers and have also used on sandwiches. Friends are all asking me to give them jars when I make more. Thanks!

Made this today to top Provolone Cheese Burgers with. Because I wanted it more savory than sweet, I cut down on the 1 cup of sugar to 3 Tbsp. Pretty good!

I added a bit more hot sauce as it's my preference, but otherwise it was a delicious jam!

This was good.  A little bit too sweet for my taste (and I used 3/4 cup of sugar), but seemed to be an overall crowd pleaser.  I also added some cumin and all spice and I'm glad I did.  And I used a cored/seeded Hatch green chili that I minced instead of the hot sauce.  I served this atop creamy goat cheese covered crackers.

I followed the recipe.   I did add extra sugar as I thought the vinagar was a bit much.  Next time I will use less ACV.  Friends loved it!  Served it on crackers with cream cheese.

Took it to a higher level.  I julienned Bok Choy (Chinese cabbage) with leeks and carrots and tossed them with soy sauce.  Using Egg Roll wraps, I smeared the tomato & bacon jam, topped this with the veg and after rolling the wraps, deep fried the Egg Rolls.  I seved them on bed of Boston lettuce with slightly warmed Oyster sauce.  Oooh soooo good!

Yum!!!  This was easy to make and YUMMY!!!  I cut the sugar back to 3/4 cup instead of 1 cup.  It was just too sweet the first time. I am HOOKED on this recipe!

I am in love with this stuff! Have made this twice now, with excess tomatoes from mom's garden. First batch exactly as the recipes states (although doubled), 2nd batch using just half the sugar, as my tomatoes were very sweet. Love this stuff! I'm thinking of so many ways to use it - on hamburgers (great!), over cream cheese with crackers (yum!), by the spoonful (yep!). Next to try is on a cheese pannini, and add some horseradish to serve with shrimp cocktail....only negative I have is that my batches took almost 3 hours to cook down, but I was making double-batches.

This is so good, I also made half just to give it a whirl and wish I made a full batch to freeze half but it is so easy to make, I will make again for sure. It will be a staple for a "win everyone over" appetizer with wine.  I served it over toasted baguette bruschetta style with some marscapone.  So good.  Thank you for sharing!!

I had a lot of tomatoes that needed to be used and this recipe intrigued me.  I made half the recipe exactly as written.  I tasted it after it had cooled and I wasn’t sure I liked it.  But, later Hubs and I tried it on a cracker with cream cheese and we both loved it.  It definitely grew on me, so much so that I decided to make a second batch.  This time I made it without the bacon, but added three small jalapenos, minced.  That one was good also.  I love that this freezes well.
