I really enjoyed this combination - more than I expected to, actually. My only complaint with the recipe is that the cooking time seems to be off. If the chicken is first browned, then allowed to cook for the length of time suggested, I'm afraid you'll end up with rubber. I zapped my sprouts (halved) and onions with the chicken broth in the microwave to get them started, then added the browned chicken and cooked for 30 minutes at 400 degrees. This turned out very well.

I had fresh brussels sprouts and chicken to make for dinner.  Found this recipe, read reviews. Some said bland.  Not bland now, fried 4 slices chopped bacon, removed, added some olive oil and sauteed chicken sprinkled with garlic powder.Added sprouts and rest of ing. put bacon on top followed baking directions.  Turned out very good.

I used frozen sprouts, and dried rosemary, that worked just fine. The recipe in itself is quite good, but next time I think I'll try using garlic and maybe a bit of bacon as suggested by other reviewers. And fresh rosemary might even be better than the dried one. Will make again:) 
Edit: I made it a second time, but omitted the part of  frying the chicken. I let it cook in the stock whilst baking. It turned out just fine. I also added a bit of garlic, and I liked the added flavour, but then I like just about anything with garlic;) I didn't use/eat the stock, but I guess you could freeze it for making soup later etc. I will continue to try this dish with other changes maybe, it has great potential for those of us who love sprouts:)

This was just ok. The brussels sprouts were good, but the chicken was bland and dry. Probably not making again.

I made this for my girlfriend (now wife) a few times and she now frequently asks for it. I never thought I would like brussels sprouts but they are actually quite good when fixed this way. Also, the smell from the oven by itself is worth making this dish, it truly fills the house with a wonderful aroma. Thanks for posting this recipe!!

Quick and easy! Slightly bland in flavor, but I love brussel sprouts and I love an easy meal that doesn't require a lot of attention. Thanks.

I like brussels sprouts, but I really did not think the rosemary complemented them. Overall, this recipe has good intentions, but the spice mixture is just a little off. I ate it because I hate to waste food, but I will not be making this recipe again.

BORING, dried out and bland!!!  The chicken dried out, the brussel sprouts were bland and the onion was icky! And I even spiced it up by deglazing the frying pan with about 3 Tbsp red wine vinegar and 3 Tbsp maple syrup, adding the chicken back in for a minute then back to the baking dish. Then I dumped all the sauce over the top before I covered it. Without this I think it might have been a 2 star (and I really like brussel sprouts!).  Sorry, I won't be making this one again.

This was a great easy recipe and my family loved it.  I had jumbo sprouts so I boiled them first,  and I used half the onions and added some chopped garlic when browning the chicken. Instead of rosemary, I used McCormicks Parmesean Herb and sprinkled that over the chicken and sprouts.  Came out great and tasty, and I would make it again.

I've made this twice now.  The only change I used was to use garlic salt over regular salt.  We all enjoyed it, even my 3 kids.  This is great if following a lower-carb lifestyle.  I will keep and use this again :)

A very nice recipe which I customized: used less rosemary, added fresh carrot slices from the start, and some fresh tomato slices (last 5 minutes of bake). Served over pasta laced with pesto. Try it!

This is a scrumptious and easy recipe.  I used 2 Cornish Hens, split down the back and browned as per recipe.  I also crumbled on some shredded prosciutto before covering and baking.  I'd definitely make this for company!

Not Wet Anymore! My family really liked this recipe. I solved the "wet" issue by 1) steaming the sprouts, 2) not using milk, and 3) using 1 1/2 cups half n half. I used mozerella, but my kids thought swiss would taste "zippier".

I used this as a base, but did it entirely on the stove top, added garlic with the onions and sautéed the veggies with chicken off to the side of a large skillet. Then I added salsa and hominy (posole) to make it Mexican as it simmered. Delish!

more of a 3.5 than a 3star, but i found that my chicken was a little dry, even though i cooked for 20 mins less than recipe said, and the brussel sprouts were on the verge of being over cooked as well. it was tasty though, easy as well, and will probably make again but will monitor the oven more closely next time.

Made this for my family in need of a quick meal. Everyone loved it! Each item was delicious. Next time I may roast the sprouts separately or use fresh sprouts because mine were very soggy. Didn’t add the sliced lemons at the bottom of the baking dish either.

I used frozen skinless boneless chicken breasts and fresh Brussels sprouts. I didn't thaw the breasts since I knew the fresh Brussels sprouts would take more time to cook. I also used Balsamic vinegar generously. The Brussels sprouts still were not tender enough for  me so I will use frozen Brussels sprouts next time. However with not precooking the chicken breast and putting them straight in the over with rest of the ingredients they came out extremely tender after an hour of cooking. I will definitely make this again with a few changes. I will probably add fried bacon to give it more flavor next time.

Instead of the chicken broth, I used 2 cans of Campbell’s Cream of Chicken soup. I only used 2 1/2 teaspoons of rosemary. I used 2 1/2 lbs of chicken. Everything else was just like the recipe! It was very delicious!

I really liked this but I agree that browning chicken and then cooking in the oven that long doesn't sound good. So I browned the chicken and cooked it covered for 20 minutes and took it out. Then I turned up the oven to 425 and continued to cook the Brussel sprouts for 20 minutes instead of 40. They browned up nice!

I added roughly a tablespoon of balsamic vinegar — which I always think brings out the flavor of brussels sprouts.

Way too much rosemary, so it way overpowered everything.  It made everything taste exactly the same.  My husband even hated it.
