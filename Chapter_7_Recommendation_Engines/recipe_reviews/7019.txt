When I saw all of the positive reviews for these muffins, I thought I'd found a winner.  Boy was I wrong.  The muffins are very sugary tasting, bland, and lacking in chocolate flavor.  Fudgy was definitely the wrong adjective to use in the name, because there is nothing fudge-like about them.  I was expecting something more rich and flavorful.  Definitely one of the worst chocolate-chocolate chip muffins I've ever tasted.  I won't be making these again.

Contrary to the other reviewers' thoughts, I found this muffin to be very moist and fudgy.  I always cut baking time by a third or a quarter and start checking for doneness at that time.  I don't usually have toothpicks so I found a spaghetti noodle works great...if it comes back clean after being poked int he center of the muffin, it is done.  My children LOVED LOVED LOVED the muffins and they were gone that very day.

A very nice recipe. Tastes very good. But I had to cut down baking time, because they came out to dry. I also did add a little milk and a little more softened butter. So the second time (yes yes) I made them they were delicious and also moist and tasty. Thanks for the great recipe. Greetings from the Netherlands! (Excuse my bad language!)

I loved this muffin. My husband on the other hand wished it was more moist. I gave it a 5 star for the flavor, and I will work on figuring out how to make it more moist without compromising the flavor. I did omit the cinnamon, and I substitued 1/2 c. sour cream for the applesauce, as I had none on hand. I also added a dash of salt. These are way better than the box muffins I have been making to send to work with my husband. Thanks!  4/29/07 - made this muffins again, and this time used the applesauce called for instead of sour cream I had subbed before.  I also increased the margarine to 1/2 c. and added some milk (probably 1/4 c.) and they were nice and moist.  Yummy!

These muffins turned out fantastically! I did change things up a bit though. I doubled the recipe and came out with 18 muffins, not 24. I also used cinnamon applesauce and omitted the extra cinnamon, I felt that this was a good compromise. I also realized that I was out of butter, so I used olive oil spread and noticed no issues with it. I was also out of chocolate chips! So, I finely chopped up some other chocolates I had lying around and it actually added a little bit of fudginess. Since I was low on chocolate, I compensated by adding a little bit more cocoa powder. Some baking tips: I suggest using a spring-action ice cream scoop to distribute the batter into the muffin tins, it is even and a lot less messy. I also sprinkled white sugar on the tops of each muffin before baking for a slight crunch on the tops. I baked these for 24 minutes and they were perfect! Let them cool for about a minute in the tin, and if you do not want to eat them right away, cool them the rest of the way out of the tin on wire racks. What a great recipe.

One word: Brownie. That is how I would describe these, and if they were called "Brownie Muffins", they would be perfectly named. The stayed flat (like other reviewers mentioned). The taste was good, but again, very much like a brownie! I like brownies so I very much enjoyed these. My sons thought they had died and gone to heaven because they got brownies in muffin shapes for breakfast. For the applesauce, I subbed 1/4 cup oil, and because the batter was very thick, added a 1/4 cup milk. Otherwise, followed the recipe.

Woah - these are DANGEROUS.  People can't believe I made these myself.  Yum.  Anyway, here is my take as I normally try to cut back on the "bad" parts of most recipes (sugar and salt).

1) I used Milk chocolate chips in place of anything else for a slightly smoother creamy taste.  So much better I find - as do my "food fans".   When I do this, I find you can omit 1/4 of the sugar - always a bonus for me.

2) I also skipped the cinnamon and I filled the cups almost all the way - not 3/4 of the way like it says.  They don't rise very much....for me anyway.

Enjoy!

These were moist and tasty.  I didn't have choc chips so I just left them out and honestly no one missed them.  I also used whole wheat flour and 1 cup of reg sugar.  I up'ed the cocoa powder to almost a 1/2 cup and I ran out of apple sauce so with my 2nd batch I used yogurt, again very yummy!  They spread a bit too much so some weren't real pretty but still tasty!  I will make these again!

These were pretty good. Based on other reviews I did add extra cocoa (1/3 c total) and 1/4 c milk. I will make these again but next time use yogart in place of the applesause. I bake using applesauce instead of oil all the time (although this is my first attempt at using it with chocolate) and it gave these kind of an odd scent and flavor at first. Still good, I thought with the increased cocoa they were very fudgy. I also added a pinch of salt and only 1/2 c of mini choco chip (they don't sink).

I was a little short on applesauce so I made up the difference with light sour cream.  After mixing together the dry ingredients I didn't think it had enough cocoa powder so I added a litte more - about 1/8 cup.  The result was perfect.  Check them right at 22 minutes or you might overbake and dry them out.

Absolutely love them! They do tend to get dry if you don't really watch them while cooking. But if you get it right, delicious!

Waste of ingredients!  Mine sunk in the middle and were hard as rocks, plus the edges burned even cooking for only 18 minutes.

I followed the recipe expect for adding a touch more cinnamon. I found the muffins to be okay. I thought they'd be really good with the cinnamon, but once they were done, I didn't like the taste. I'd make these again, only next time I'd omit the cinnamon.

Not my favorite muffin.  The texture and moisture content were fine. I don't know if it was the applesauce or what that just wasn't right.  It wasn't chocolatey enough for me,(and I am not a chocoholic at all.) and there was an unusual tartness. Perhaps omitting the applesauce and just using oil (of course, upping the fat content in the process) and adding a little more cocoa might help. I bake for my husband's staff on the weekends he works and thought I would add a chocolate muffin to go with the others I made.  Next time I think I will just try either a brownie recipe to go all the way or maybe tweaking the "Best Ever Muffins" (a great starter recipe) and add chocolate chips.  Worth a try, but I probably won't repeat.

Amazing recipe!  I took other reviewers' suggestions and used 1/3 cup cocoa powder, 1/2 tsp of baking powder, 3/4 tsp of salt, and 1/4 tsp cinnamon.  I've also used a mix of white, milk, and semi-sweet chocolate chips to add up to one cup.  Delicious!!!  These are so incredible day after day heated up.

I can't imagine where all the negative comments are coming from... mine were not dry at all, they were moist and indeed fudgy. They didn't fall, they puffed up beautifully. And they did not stick to the paper liner whatsoever. Maybe I just got lucky? I did leave the cinnamon out, and I accidentally beat all the wet ingredients together instead of creaming the butter and sugar together first and then adding the applesauce. Just kind of dumped it all in together. They were fabulous- they got a RAVE review from my boyfriend, who always simply says things are "good".

the taste is good, if somewhat sweeter than you expect; they don't rise much and don't remain moist.
must try with some more baking powder next time...

These were absolutely delicious!  I didn't use the powdered sugar, and I used 3/4 cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips, and 3/4 cup of butterscotch chips.  They were so moisty and ooey gooey that they fell apart and couldn't get out of the pan without falling apart.  I'll definitely use papers next time.  i made these for my neighbors to thank them for helping me and both sets were praising me.  I made them three kinds of muffins each and these were by far their favorite.  This is definitely a keeper! I can't wait to make these for my husband when he gets home from deployment!

EDIT - I've made these a second time!  This time I doubled the recipe and added butterscotch chips, dark chocolate chips, and semi-sweet chips.  Absolute heaven!

I tried this recipe for my kids Valentine's Day, and they tasted awesome! My kids loved them, I added the 1/4 of milk and increased the margarine 1/2 cup also. I didnt have enough cocoa powder but it still tasted alright. I also put pink icing with a red cinnamon heart on top! Great recipe!!

These are so good! I always use "Special Dark" cocoa powder instead of normal, so I did that, and I used an egg replacer instead of egg because I'm vegan. Those were my only changes, and these muffins are amazing! They are definitely very fudgy - they're almost exactly like the fudge brownies I used to make a few years ago.

These were quite tasty!  I followed some other reviewer's advice : added 1/2 tsp. baking powder, changed to 1/3 cup cocoa (I used the "Special Dark"), added 3/4 tsp. salt, and cut the white sugar a little. I also took a pass on the cinnamon. 
  The wonderful crisp top was lost overnight which is a little bit of a bummer, but the taste doesn't fade.  If I can I will always try to bake + serve them on the same day to preserve the crispy top which sends them into totally awesome territory.

Love them! Used 1/2 c cocoa bcs out of choc chips. Had no applesauce, so used 1/8 c water and 1/8 c cream since I was also out of milk! Lol Very fudgy and didn't fall at all. Thick batter, probaby bcs of my changes. Made 10 muffins. Will make again w choc chips.

These muffins are delicious.  They are so moist and fudgy and just delicious.  I have made them twice before and today I am making them but with 3/4 c. applesauce and 1/8c. butter.  I am going to see how them come out, but they will be a bit healthier.  Enjoy these while they last, which is not long at all.

I was craving chocolate and my son and I decided to throw these together. I'm pretty good at following the recipe as written, but right off the bat I changed the baking soda to baking powder, and the margarine to oil. My muffins did not fall as others have said, and were nice and plump. I only got 18 mini muffins out of this batch, and will probably double the recipe next time.  Note that this doesn't taste like "fudgy"  brownies, but still tastes chocolately. Just enough for a morning treat without being too sweet!

I made these making some of the changes that other people had mentioned. I put in 1/2 cup of butter and about 1/4 cup of milk. These came out great. They did not sink in the middle, they were flat on top. I found them to be more like a chocolate cupcake than a brownie. Not sure what I did wrong. They were very moist and I will definately make them again.

I use spelt four instead of regular flour, due to my daughter's wheat allergy.  These are soooo good, that people are constantly asking me for the recipe! On occasion, I put a maraschino cherry in the middle of the cupcakes, and then top with cherry icing!

I had to review because I have heard good and bad from others about this recipe. I made these as MINI muffins...added 1/2 tsp baking pwd (to help rise), and about 3/4 tsp of salt...to balance out the sweetness. They turned out perfect and tasty..unlike many chocolate muffins I have tasted in the past. Must try!

Excellent.

I was suprised to read negative reviews of this muffin recipe. Mine came out perfect. Not flat and certainly not dull to the taste. Naturally, one had to make a few modifications, for example, remove the brown sugar and use large bitter chocolate buttons in combination with good quality British cocoa and salty butter.

Many of those complaints about flatness sounds like the baker is not using the right flour with the right amount of baking powder and is NOT in full control of the oven.

This recipe was a complete flop.  The muffins were concave and did not rise at all.  The taste was good and my small children still liked them.  I will try them with baking powder instead and report back!

I used this recipe to make 2 dozen mini-muffins as treats for the office.  I took out the margarine and healthy applesauce and used a stick of butter and a little milk instead.  They were a big hit with my chocolate-loving colleages.

An excellent muffin...my kids love chocolate chip muffins and these are a new favourite.  The apple sauce was a great idea and gives the muffins moisture but cuts down on fat.  I have made them twice in two days!

I am always looking for low fat recipes to try and/or adapt.  I tried to make this recipe even lower in fat by using just 1 1/2 tablespoons margarine (even though it recommends not to use for baking, I used "I can't believe it's not butter LIGHT"), and added two extra tablespoons of applesauce.  I also added just a half cup of chocolate chips, and used milk chocolate instead of semi-sweet.  I also didn't add the cinnamon or powdered sugar, and it still came out really tasty...A really good recipe!

This recipe was a surprize to my family! I had some applesauce that I wanted to use up so I tried this recipe. My family loved it! Even my hubby, who I use as a guide for the kid friendly rating loved it. He usually says no fat, no flavour. Not this time!

Nice recipe, I recommend a few changes:
- I used the recommended amount of cocoa, though it could definitely use more as some reviewers suggested (try 1/3 cup instead of 1/4)
- To make these rise with nice big tops, do 3 things: 1) When you add the wet ingredients to the dry, do not stir/mix.  Instead, use a whisk until the ingredients are just barely wet.  You want a lumpy dough.  2) fill up the muffin tray all the way to the top, even slightly over the top.  3) bake at 400 for 5 minutes, then 350 for 22 more.  With the tray filled to the brim, they come out perfectly moist after this amount of time (if you opt for less filling reduce the cooking time like others have mentioned).  These 3 steps result in those nice 'bakery style' tops.  This recipe yielded me 6 nice big muffins with this technique rather than 12 smaller ones,
- I would half the cinnamon - I could definitely taste it in the finished product, a little too much..

They came out alright.  Sweet and certainly edible.  They had an awful lot of chocolate chips for how much batter there is.  It made exactly 12 muffins for me.  They were short but fully cooked.  I cooked them for 22-23 minutes and rotated the pan once halfway through.  It just didn't satisfy my craving for a chocolate chip muffin.  It tasted like a "healthy" brownie.

I had trouble with these muffins not rising too. However, I did modify the recipe so that is probably why. They taste amazing, so all in all it was worth it. My changes were adding 1/4 cup buttermilk, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and I also added one round teaspoon of instant espresso to enhance the chocolate flavor. I followed another reviewers advice and added a little more cocoa, so I probably used 1/3 cup. These changes produced a wonderfully moist chocolaty muffin, just didn't rise well- will be trying the recipe again!

The measurements only produced 8 cupcakes for me, I found them to be a little dry, and it didn't have quite that fudgy choclotaty flavor I was looking fo.  Over all, the they still turned out yummy.

I wouldn't call the fudgy.  They were a little on the dry side, but considering the ingredients, I think that they are perfect for satisfying a chocolate craving without a lot of guilt.  My kids called them chocolate cupcakes with chocolate chips in them and gobbled them up.  I do really like the addition of the cinnamon in them.  Will probably make these again considering how much my kids liked them.  I would rather serve them these that other higher fat ones.

I used homemade organic applesauce, butter instead of margerine, a 1/2 cup of Splenda and omitted the brown sugar completely, two egg whites, a full teaspoon of vanilla and whole wheat flour. I didn't add the cinnamon only because my applesauce was already spiced. I used dark chocolate chips. Making these a little lighter and a bit healthier was the only way I could be okay with making double-chocolate chip muffins for my husband. They're cooling now but I'll update my review once my family has tried them in the morning.

Definitely some mixed reviews, eh.  Though mine fell they were still moist and chocolaty.  Had a hard time peeling them from the liners without them breaking into pieces.  I'm pleased with them overall and not timid sharing them outside the home.

Left out the cinnamon, used white whole wheat flour. These came out gorgeously, perfectly domed even though I just lumped the batter into the muffin cups. Thanks!!

These were very good muffins.  I also added two mashed banana's to the batter to have a chocolate banana muffin.  They turned out delicious!

As many other reviewers have mentioned, the middle of these muffins sink in and leave a crater. Otherwise, they are amazing! The only modification I made was adding a bit of almond extract. I loved how they were crisp on the outside and chewy in the middle. Not the prettiest muffins, but very yummy.

I agree with someone else that said these arent that 'fudgy' like the recipe states.  I didnt think they were terrible, just ok.  Im a huge chocolate lover, so I'll probobly try another recipe next time

These muffins were really moist and delicious. I will definitely make them again. I tweaked the recipe a bit. I added sour cream in place of apple sauce because I didn't have any and butter in place of margarine.

This recipe was horrible.  I followed the recipe to a T and all of the muffins came out of the oven sunk in the middle.  Thinking it was the baking soda (maybe it was a little too old), I bought a new box and made the muffins again.  And again, they were sunk in the middle.  I really, really would not recommend this recipe.

These were tasty. Because others said that they came out flat I used half a tsp of baking powder to see if they would rise more. They were not flat but not full like muffins usually are. I also used 1/4 of oil and 1/4 cup of apple sauce. As others mentioned it does have the taste and texture of a brownie, just baked in a muffin form. I was hoping for more of a cakey, more moist type muffin. My husband liked them though. I thought they were good as well but not what I expected.

These were excellent. I changed the recipe a bit. Made them as mini muffins, baked about 17 minutes. I also added 1T margarine and 2/3 c. milk as another reviewer suggested. They were a hit at our Groundhog Day party. Thank you for a great recipe.

Definitely leave out the cinnamon.  It gives them a strange taste.  Barely made 10 mufffins.  But those ten muffins were really good while warm.  Still good cold, but I prefer my chips gooey.  I'll make this again.

This is awesome. They aren't too sweet or too chocolately, just right. They don't rise very much, so don't be afraid to fill the cups most of the way to the top. I really liked that they were made with applesauce instead of oil, makes them just a tiny bit healthier for everyone. Delicious. Will defiantly make again.

As a PP suggested, I switched to baking powder (esp. as I used alkalized cocoa powder) but the muffins still did not rise that much. I am going to try the original suggestion of baking soda next time to see if that helps.

Edited: I didn't even realise I'd tried and reviewed this recipe already but this time I'm raising to 5 stars. I didn't have applesauce so I subbed a mashed banana. I used more like 1/3 c cocoa powder and butter instead of margarine. They were fantastic! Moist and chocolately.

The chocolate intensity is great. I am not a chocoholic but I tried the Chocolate Chocolate Chip Muffin recipe the same evening (as I could not give away the flat fudgy muffins) and the taste was bland in comparison to these. The fudgy muffins are much better. For those who complained, the intensity of cocoa powder is brought out if you dissolve it in boiling water first.

I know some of you were complaining that they are more cake-like than "fudgy" and by accident I have fixed that!  If you add 2 sticks of butter and about 5 minutes to the cook time they are a "brownie-muffin hybrid" as my husband put it.  This does make them severely unhealthy, but they sure are good!

Oh, I also forgot to add I changed the recipe to 18, and discovered I was out of brown sugar so I made my own with molasses and white sugar, and I used regular salted sweet cream butter!

I'm making these muffins for the second time.  I made the following substitutions: whole wheat flour, 1/2 c and white flour 1/2 c in place of all white; butter instead of margarine.  These were very good, and were devoured quickly by my children and my visitors.  Nice and fudgy, and I did not have a problem with the muffins rising, although they did not rise very high.  This time I'm making them with baking powder 3/4 t instead of 1/2 t baking soda.  Don't know why I'm fooling with what has worked for me in the past, but we'll see how it turns out.  Thanks for this awesome recipe.

I actually liked theese muffins.  I used splenda instead of white sugar, 3/4 of applesauce and only added 1/2 cup of chips.  I think I will make this again, but just with splenda next time.

Made these into mini muffins for a work picnic, used mini chips (made about 36).  My kids loved them and I'm pretty sure I'll be making them for my son's class for his birthday.

These "brownie-muffins" don't rise very much. I made only 10 muffins out of the batter.
Without the chocolate chips the batter tastes very bland, but with the chocolate added the taste is good.
Very good texture.
Good recipe to make mini-muffins I think.

I followed some suggestions from other reviewers like using oil instead of applesauce and ommiting the cinnamon and these tasted great.  Don't add anymore cocoa as they have the right amount of chocolate as is.  The only problem I had was that they sunk when I went to test them.  Apart from that they are great.

After reading the other reviews, I increased the cocoa to 1/2 cup.  That ended up being a little too chocolately, and I'm the biggest chocaholic there is!  They were still delicious though, but maybe not for breakfast.  

They're much better warm, as they get a little too crusty after they cool.  

Overall, a great recipe!

These are VERY GOOD. I didn't add cinnamon or powdered sugar, and after they cooled a bit the tops were crunchy/crispy - yum! My chocoholic husband thought they were great and so did my 2 little girls. Next time I might try adding less chocolate chips and see if anyone notices! Thanks for a great recipe.

I chose to make mini muffins. I reduced the time by half and added from there. It ended up taking 14 minutes. These are AMAZING! I got 38 mini miffins from this recipe.

I followed the recipe and used gluten free all purpose flour.  These turned out delicious!  I believe I ended up taking them out around 19-20 minutes.   Kids loved them too (most important!).

Made as-is, only replacing margarine with canola oil. Very moist, not very chocolately. My 3.5 year old and I enjoyed them very much. Will make again, but may sub some of the flour for more cocoa - or add more chocolate chips.

These muffins have a great chocolate flavor but mine fell in the middle.  Only change I made was using oil in place of the applesauce.  Great as they tasted I won't be making them again.  Will continue looking for a great chocolate muffin recipe.

The batter was a bit too dense so I added some milk until it was smooth. Other than that, it was amazing! I added a TBSP of chia seeds too to add some crunch (:

I made these and loved them! Very moist and chocolatey. They didn't rise very much but I would still make them again. I also only baked for about 16 minutes per the recommendations.

These were very moist and light. I think next time I will reduce the sugar or up the cocoa, seeing the the sugar is needed to sweeten the cocoa. My boys will love them though. I only baked them for 21 mins.  :)

Super easy to make and delicious!  I substituted my gluten free flour and took the muffins out at the lower cooking time when the top bounced back to my touch.    Taste like a chocolate cake.  Yum!

I have made these 2xs now, the first time I added extra butter and milk at the suggestion of other reviews. They tasted great but didnt rise and fell apart. The second time I followed the directions and they came out beutiful!! They are a bit dense but taste great!! My kids love them!! The only change I made was substituting baking stevia for the white sugar!!

I found this recipe to be both very fudgy and moist by  adding the following:  small chocolate pudding mix and 3/4 cup milk.   With these additions, I decided to add an extra 1/2 t of vanilla and an extra 1/2 t of baking soda.  They came out perfect!

Whoa! I dont know what I did wrong, but these did not turn out. They all sunk in. I used all the exact ingredients minus the cinnamon. The tops were crispy and hard while the middle was pretty tasty but, ya I cant help but wonder where I went wrong. So sad.

Based on the reviews I made some changes, and I turned it into a mini brownie by accident - but a very good one. I changed to 1/4 cup apple sauce and 1/4 cup oil (b/c some reviews said they were dry - and upped the cocoa powder to 1/2 cup (because some said not chocolatey enough. I baked them in mini muffin tins for  15 minutes. They came out chocolatey and chewy and rich. It was a good accident :) Made 28

I liked this a lot, but, WARNING! THESE MUFFINS ARE INCREDIBLY SWEET. I felt almost sick afterwards. I think I will be making these again, but cutting the sugar in half or thirds. I like the amount of chocolate chips, but I may have to cut some of those out as well. Otherwise, I liked them a lot.

I subbed 3/4 cup of plain yogurt instead of applesauce, and I added 1/4 cup of milk to the recipe. I didn't have chocolate chips, so I didn't use them. I did use Reese's chips in 4 out of the 12 muffins. Probably the best muffins I've ever made, with the subs that I used.

I did make some adjustments to this recipe...instead of applesauce i used yogurt. I added 1/4 cup of milk. and an extra tsp of soft butter. Now i baked mine as mini muffins so i used the mini chocolate chips. They rose FABULOUSLY! I would recommend for those who didnt get a rise out of the muffin should probably buy fresh baking soda.

I've made these twice. The first time, they were a little dry tasting, so the second time, I added about a tablespoon or so of mayonnaise, and a tablespoon of canola oil, and they were super moist and fabulous.

You can't taste the mayonnaise, but it does make it more moist.

Excellent!!  It's more like a fudgy cupcake.  I added about 1/4 cup of 5% cream because the mixture was too thick.  I also added 1 teaspoon of orange flavour and 1 heaping teaspoon of orange zest.  We'll be baking these often, Hubby love's them!

I'm changing my review, which was previously very negative. I first wrote a rating when I tried the muffins while they were still hot. But believe it or not, these taste terrible hot and excellent when completely cooled off. Somehow the fudgy texture and chocolate taste are just not there until they cool down. While this recipe has far too much sugar for my taste, it actually is very good. 

The other thing that bothered me about these muffins was that they were SO hard to get out of the pan (I sprayed a ton of Pam on it, so that wasn't it). Because the recipe has so much sugar, they really weld onto the metal. Mine were all quite mutilated by the time I got them out. I would recommend using muffin liners. Maybe if you have silicon baking pans you'll be fine, too.

These are really more like chocolate chip cookies in a muffin cup. The taste is really good, but they don't really resemble muffins at all...flat in the middle.

These were just ok. My 9 year old daughter said they were, "too much." Very rich in our opinion. I forgot to top with the confectioners sugar and omitted the cinnamon because I used cinnamon applesauce, I'll probably look for another recipe.

Wow, these are either the best muffins I have ever made or I was really craving chocolate badly, LOL.  Maybe both.  I added two extra tablespoons of cocoa and a teaspoon of baking powder and did not add the cinnamon.  These are just so delicious.  Five stars for sure.

Just made these and they are yummy!  Added some sugar on top to add some texture (like the other poster said).  They turned out beautifully!  I think the key is not to bake too long so they are still fudgy inside.

can i rate it with 10 stars? it's sssssssoooooooooooo good! i used plain yogurt instead of applesauce, omitted the cinnamon, used only white sugar 3/4 cup total, extra dark cocoa powder up to 1/3 cup, and added 1/2 tsp baking powder and a pinch of salt.  the batter was a bit dry (probably 'cos i put in more cocoa powder than what the recipe called for), hence i added 1 more tbsp of yogurt.  they did rise very nicely.  they looked professional, they tasted professional... just that the whole house's still smelling chocolatey after several hours...  haha!!

Yummy muffins the family loved! I added some flax seed for extra fiber, but made the rest of the recipe as called for! The batter tasted better than the muffins, though, so maybe even more cocoa powder? Still, very yummy.

YummO!  My 5 year old and I whipped these up for dinner tonight.  They were delish!!  I used homemade applesauce and opted not to use the cinnamon.  They were yummy.  But very hard to get out of the wrappers.

We loved it! I was out of certain ingredients, but my substitutions added to the fudginess:

1. olive oil for applesauce
2. a little more olive oil since I didn't have the full amount of margarine.
3. Swiss Miss cocoa for cocoa.
4. Added 1/2 cup milk.
5. Cooked a little longer since batter was moister.
6. Came out delicious!

The taste of the batter was sugary and not very chocolatey, so I was not surprised to find that the muffins themselves tasted the same way.  SO overwhelmingly sweet, I could not even finish one and I am a BIG chocolate dessert fan. Furthermore,to make matters worse, these never raised and came out flat as can be (to be fair, I did substitute butter for the margarine, so perhaps that is the reason).  Sorry, but this will be my first-ever "1-star" rating.

So incredibly good!  I would suggest doubling the recipe because these will go fast.  I wanted to freeze half, but everyone ate them before I could.  I used half the cinnamon, though I think the full amount would be great as well.  I used chunky applesauce.  Very chocolately- enough for a dessert, but great for a breakfast treat. I'll be making these forever!

I love these muffins!  They do taste a lot like a brownie.  I added some extra chocolate chips (just because I like chocolate chips).  I have made these 3 times in the past week and am making them for the school bake sale.  Super yum!

These muffins were pretty good. I didn't have any applesauce in the house, so I replaced it with some oil, which I think made them turn out a little different. However, I still thought they were good. Next time I make them, I would probably use milk chocolate chips instead.

Yum, yum, yum - all the neighborhood kids loved. I substituted melted butter for the margarine, and since I didn't have chocoate chips I added aboout 4 oz melted bittersweet chocolate. I baked at 340 degrees. They were slightly dry so next time will add a bit more liquid. Thx for the recipe and helpful hints!

This is a very chocolatie recipe. No more chocolate needed here. Only change I made to the recipe is I added french vanilla yogurt in place of the applesauce.Did not add cinnamon or icing sugar. I had to cook the muffins a bit longer but they turned out excellent. I would highly recommend this easy recipe.

I used vegetable oil instead of applesauce and it came out a little oily.  I definitely doubled the cocoa powder and it was worth it.  
Make sure you keep these covered...they get hard on top.  These would be great with walnuts if you are a nut lover!

These are good muffins but I don't know that they live up to their fudgy name.  I was expecting a more moist muffin.  They were not overly dry mind you, but with the word fudgy in the title, I expected a moister texture.  Still, I'll make these again.

They were kind of rubbery on the outside, and most of the chocolate flavor came from the chocolate chips.

These were quick and turned out great. I doubled the cinnamon and vanilla to 1 tsp. each. I will probably put a bit more cinnamon in next time (we really like it!). FYI - I only got 11 regular sized muffins instead of 12 by filling them to 3/4 full.

These were SUCH a hit, was able to modify the recipe using rice flour and peanut butter/chocolate chips.  Worked the best with Spelt flour but it's more gluten then our family can handle.  Moist cakelike and so rich in chocolate flavor.  Have made them several times already

This was okay not the best. the semi-sweet choclate chips were a little to over powering. They didn't rise up enough. You could really taste the cinnamin in them though. Very sweet. I don't think I'll be making these again though. But other people in my family gave it 4 stars.

These are pretty good, kind of a cross between a cupcake and a muffin, as another reviewer noted. They don't rise very high, but they are not super moist either. They are very sweet, which is not something that bothers me all that much, but I've definitely got a love of sweet. I don't know...these are sort of an odd ball. I wouldn't recommend them for breakfast, but they wouldn't quite cut it as dessert either.

This is a very good muffin.  Be sure to use the paper muffin liners as it is difficult to get them out of muffin tin intact.  The tops came off on a few but you can salvage with peanut butter to re-attach.  All in all a good one to keep in recipe co;;ection.
