Great recipe!!! To make it easier, a bit healthier, and a bit tangy, I used frozen O'Brien potatoes, 10 oz. real bacon bits, 1 cup lite mayonnaise, 1 cup of nonfat plain yogurt, shredded sharp cheddar cheese, crushed black pepper, and freshly crushed marjoram.  After baking the casserole, I sprinkled more shredded cheddar on top and broiled it to golden brown...delicious!!!

Fabulous recipe!  I make it twice a month for our sunday brunch at church.  I vary it each time: using ham, sausage, or bacon.  I also use sharp, medium, or mild cheddar.  And it makes it easier to use frozen hashbrowns (shredded or o brien) or even tater tots!  It can be prepared the night before, and popped in the oven in the morning.  It is always completely gone.

Just have to share with all of you HOW DELICIOUS this dish is.  I used red potatoes, left skin on and used Hellman's like someone else suggested.  I took it to church this morning and EVERYBODY wants the recipe.  
Absolutely the biggest hit there today!!

Yum!  This was really rich, but really good.  Instead of processed cheese, I used shredded cheddar.  I also used only about 10 oz. of bacon, rather than a full pound.  And I drained it well.

The only drawback was that it still came out really greasy.  Any ideas how to cut back on that?  If I could fix that, it would get 5 stars.

I loved this recipe! I brought the casserole to a bridal shower and it was a huge hit! Very creamy and cheesy. I used the fresh chopped bacon bits rather than cooking and crumbling the bacon--much easier that way! I also used red potatoes--and didn't peel them, I just chopped them into 1 inch cubes. DELICIOUS! I would definitely make this again!

Great!  I substituted two cans of cheddar cheese soup mixed with about a half can of milk and left the skin on baby reds. Everyone loved it at Mother's Day brunch, and my brother (who is a great cook) even asked for the recipe.

This was very good and popular at the brunch potluck I took it to.  I boiled the potatoes for about 7 minutes so they wouldn't get too soft in the cooking process.  I used shredded cheddar instead of processed.  It took about 45 minutes to put it together by the time I got all the bacon cooked, and then I baked it for 45 minutes.  Quite delicious!

Tried to cut down on the fat by using low fat mayo and 2% cheese. It was fabulous. Definately worthy of 5 stars!

The first review I have written after using many recipies from this site. I thought this dish was great!!  A huge hit at thanksgiving. I cut the recipe in half and instead of using just mayo, I cut the mayo in half and used half light mayo and half fat free sour cream to make it more baked potatoeee and a bit better for you. Also I recommend to cover the dish with alluminum foil while cooking to keep it moist, I cooked it for a bit less time also. Turned out GREAT!!!!

This recipe was very easy and tasted great!  The kids loved it!  No one could tell there onions in it at all!  And instead of making 1-inch cubes, I left the skin on and made the chunks a little bigger.  Turned out just as tasty as can be!  Will definitely make again!

I made this for easter brunch and I wasn't thrilled with the processed cheese flavor. My guests did not care for it either.

This was AWESOME! So quick and easy to make. My husband loved it, and asked for it to  be a part of our regular menu. The only thing I changed was I used white & cheddar cheese (already shredded) and some mozzarella as well. I added a bread crumb topping.  Turned out fabulous! Great recipe.

This was really good and very easy.  I did what others have suggested and used hash browns instead of new potatoes.  I only made half a recipe and it was more than enough for 5 people.

Tried this yesterday for the first time and everyone loved it.  I made it exactly as written, except I used yukon gold potatoes (which added to the creamy yellow color).  I think it is important to make a recipe in it's original form, before you can be critical of the recipe.  I have to admit I was nervous about the amount of mayo.  I was afraid it would make the dish greasy, but instead they were so light and creamy.  I served it as part of our buffet that included baked ham.  My cousins told me I couldn't make it again, because they ate TOO MUCH!!

I didn't really care for this.  It was definitely missing something and had a very strange taste.  I followed the recipe exactly.

Delicious - - would give it 5 stars except for calories so I tried to make it a little healthier as follows.  I browned turkey sausage and the chopped red onion together with alot of pepper.  Then I added a few handfuls of shredded carrots and torn spinach when I added Hellmans Light Mayo.  Used the unpeeled red potatos like others suggested, and mixed them with 8 oz of shredded cheddar (sharp and mild combo).  Big hit at a party and at home.  Thanks!

I used to make a casserole like this so I changed the recipe a bit by taking a large onion and slicing it thin.  I also cooked the onion before adding it to the potato mixture.  It turned out great and my guests loved the cheesey flavor mixed with the onion and bacon.

This recipe is so ridiculously good it should be a sin!!!  My hubby made it for our Christmas brunch and all of our guests raved for days about it...it will become a staple dish in our house.  However, it is pretty onion heavy so you may want to halve the amount called for if you don't care for too many.

This was really good, but not the best cheesy potato casserole I have had. I made it for a brunch and it went well. It tasted a little too 'mayo-y' for me. I did use real shredded cheese instead of processed,reduced fat mayo, and turkey bacon to help reduce some of the calories. It did take longer than a 30 -minute prep for me by the time I skinned the potatoes and cubed them and got the bacon cooked and everything put together.

My family made this for my Mother's Day brunch and it was so yummy!  They bought already cooked bacon to make it even easier to put together.  Great for brunch, but would make a good side dish too.  I can't wait to have again!

I left the skins on my red potatoes, and used sharp cheddar cheese with real mayonnaise and real bacon. Maybe I didn't drain the bacon well, but it turned out very greasy although the taste was excellent. Everybody loved them but they were even greasier when I reheated. And although I burned some of the bacon, you couldn't tell. And...still...yum!! I'm going to experiment with lite mayonnaise next time. I think I'll use more onions, too!

This was wonderful!  It's not low cal, but it tasted wonderful with some strip steaks I made for dinner tonight and was a perfect accompaniment!  I actually added some swiss cheese to my mixture to pump up the taste a little.  Next time I make it, I am going to experiment a bit more with some other cheeses as I often have leftovers in the packets that you buy.  I baked it in one of my ceramic dishes and it got a beautiful dark crusting on it that my family loves.  Thanks for sharing with allrecipes.com!

This was pretty good the first day and delicious on the second. I did use low-fat mayo, 2% Velveeta, and turkey bacon; in the future, I think I'll use real bacon because the turkey bacon took on an unpleasant texture. My husband loved the combination of his favorite foods!

I prepared this for Sunday Brunch and it was exceptional.  The whole house smelled great.  One hint:  do not completely cook the potatoes...the oven will do that for you!  A+  I served this with Spicy Bacon Twists and Eggs..

You cannot go wrong with this dish, my friends and family have been enjoying this for a couple years now and it will certainly remain in our rotation for years to come.  I like to change it up with whatever I have on hand; spinach being a MUST!  Thanks for sharing such a wonderful recipe.  Kudos!

I started taking this to women's brunches.  Now whenever I'm invited to a brunch, I am asked to bring this casserole.  I made this a little easier by using 3 pounds of southern style hash browns and warming them in the microwave.

Our daughter-in-law made this for an Easter brunch, and it was delicious!  Very cheesy and rich.  Lots of high-calorie ingredients, but for a special occasion, it's wonderful!!

I took this casserole to Easter brunch.  I couldn't eat for about ten minutes and when I finally was able to help myself to the food, there was barely a spoonful left!  Everyone absolutely LOVED this dish!!  

I made it with cubed Del Monte canned potatoes to save time.  Melted the Velveeta in the microwave first and then gently mixed it with the potatoes before mixing with the rest of the ingredients.  It worked out beautifully with the canned potatoes and save so much work.

I took this to a family get together. There were multiple potato casseroles there. This was by far the most complimented. The rest were left alone and I didn't make it back home with leftovers.

Easy to make and a new family favorite! Creamy, cheesy, bacon- what's not to love?!? I left the skins on my potatoes as I like the nutritional value of them and I was out of processed cheese so I used a jar of Cheez Whiz I had in the pantry and it worked wonderfully!

This is a 5 star for me. I used cheddar cheese, 1 cup yogurt, 1 cup light mayo instead of regular mayo and half the onion. I wish I would have used the whole onion though. I will make this again and again!

This was awesome!  I made it for our Christmas potluck at work and not a drop was leftover.  I am going to make it again tomorrow for another party that I am going to.  I made it using Oscar Meyer real bacon bits because I have no bacon cooking talent - I always burn the bacon or undercook it.  Thanks for this awesome recipe!

I took this to a breakfast at work and it turned out good. I prepared everything the night before and baked it the following morning. I only rated this 4 stars because I believe that it needs more seasonings. I will make again with some alterations. Thanks for the recipe.

This was great! I made it for Easter dinner & everyone loved!  I used fresh potatoes & then my sister told me she forgot to mention that she uses frozen.  I would use the frozen next time as it would make it much faster.  It was really good though & I will be making these again for sure!

This was pretty easy to make. I'm an aspiring chef and this was a breeze. I'm only 16 and I can do it! I'm worried because I didn't put it in the oven yet and I only made enough for four servings. Now I have to estimate how long it will take too cook! AHH! The only thing wrong with this site is that when you change the servings it doesn't change the cooking time or the size of the dish/pan you need to use. Everything came together nicely in the prep though. It should be fine. I made this for Mother's Day and I hope God will help me with this one!

I had high hopes, and the finished dish had good flavors, but was too thick and not creamy as I was hoping. Maybe I did something incorrectly? May try again.

At first I was skeptical because of the mayonaisse, but wow was I wrong, this was AMAZING!  I used Kraft mayo and it was great!  I can't believe how good it is, I will be making this one again!
Thanks for sharing!

The consistency of this was really nice, however the mayonnaise made it too sweet.  I think next time I will reduce the mayonnaise to 1 cup and add an egg to the mixture.

It was easy enough to make.  I used frozen bagged hash brown potatoes to make up some time.  The flavor was good but not to die for.  Will look for another potato casserole recipe.

This was sooo good.  I have tried with both boiled potatoes and frozen potatoes and have had good results with both.  I used shredded chedder instead of the velveeta due to personal preference.

I've made these many times.  I use Velveeta for the cheese and bacon bits on top.  This is good as  your potato dish for a ham or meatloaf dinner.

The whole family loved this one.  I used bacon bits as I did not have bacon, I also added ground beef(cooked/drained), and I also added  peas as a veggie to make it a whole meal.  I added the peas to the potatoes to gently cook before putting in oven.  This turned out great.  Thank you for a good recipe.

Great recipe!  Tried it for the first time for guests - they all loved it & wanted the recipe.  I followed another reviewer's suggestion by adding shredded sharp cheddar instead of the processed cheese & used 1 cup lite hellman's mayo & 1 cup plain non-fat yogurt.   So delicious!  We can't wait to dig into the leftovers!!

Excellent - so easy and quick.  for more complexity, you can always add your favorite flavors - we tried it with some crumbled bacon on top, Franks hot sauce and red pepper flakes for a hot and cheesy blast.

I made this casserole to use during the week for quick meals.  It's very good, and quite filling! I reheat it only in portions to be eaten right away. I used about half the bacon called for and a little less cheese in the original baking. When I reheat it I sometimes add some pepper jack for a little kick.  My family likes it both ways, just cheese or with the additional pepper jack.

I served this along with scrambled eggs and biscuits for Christmas morning.  I prepared it the night before, but I did change it slightly.  I used 1c mayo and 8oz of cream cheese.  I also used shredded cheddar cheese.  The taste was wonderful and well received by all.  I'll be making this again.

This is a great recipe! I made it for a party and the women appreciated the great taste and the simplicity and all of the men thought it tasted just like dutch oven potatoes. I have already been asked to make it again! Very delicious!

Very delicious, but also greasy.  This will need to be a special dish we have rarely.

This was wonderful. I did add some shredded cheddar cheese on top before baking! This was a wonderful casserole for our Mother's Day brunch!

YUUUM!! I made this for mother's day this year and it was so delicious! I used shredded cheddar cheese instead of cubed and it melted nicely. I served it with eggs and fruit salad, the best breakfast ever!

Used 2% velveeta & half light mayo.  Then I added a little shredded cheese on top in the last 10 minutes of cooking.  Was very good!

substitution. Also added fresh chopped green onion tops and mexican velveeta with a few extra sliced jalopenos and chopped red onions for color and extra crunch.  A beautiful dish good hot or cold (like potato salad). We rate it a 4 to 5 but took longer than 30 minutes to prepare for me.

I only used about 2/3 lb of cheese (shredded cheddar) and only 1 c of mayo, and I used some left over ham instead of the bacon, but this still came out great.  I received many compliments.

Made this today for a holiday brunch with friends and everyone raved about it.  Made it as is except for omitting the bacon since I also served ham.  It's the only dish that totally disappeared by the end of the day.  Yum.  (Was also easy to make ahead last night and pop in the oven to bake today.)

Let me just say I love mayo, I love cheese, and I love potatoes, but this is the first time I've put all three together in one dish.  Why didn't I think of this first?!?  I thought it was really really good.  But hubby and son thought it was just okay.  I think the problem was that I used tator tots as another reviewer suggested and by the time I "gently" stirred the cheese cubes until they were melted, the tots were pretty well shredded and somewhat mashed.  If I used tots again I think I'd make my cheese cubes much smaller or maybe even melt the cheese before adding.  I used "Hormel Real Bacon Bits" to save time and it was great!

This is just my kind of dish! I made it with lite mayo, and added a little salt and pepper. Also, five minutes before the end of cooking time, I topped the potatoes with a little grated extra-sharp Cheddar. SO delicious! Thank you!

I just love cheesy potatoes so this one sounded good to me!  I thought it was pretty easy to put together.  I added a layer of shredded colby/jack for even more of a cheesy flavor. I'll be making this one often!  Thanks for sharing!

This is my go to "bring a dish" recipe. It is delicious and there is never any left in the pan after the potluck. I have made it too many times to count. My advice: Don't stir the taters too much, add more bacon, add more cheese.

This was a hit the very first time I made it.  My boys still talk about it!  Since there are a lot of high calorie ingredients, we only make it for special occasions as a treat.  I use Black Rathhawk real beef bacon when I make this.  Mmmm good!

Very good. I halved the recipe and made it at night and refrigerated it to cook Christmas morning, and it worked out well. Cooked for 1 hour and was ready to eat once all the presents were opened. I used a package of shredded cheddar cheese instead of processed cheese. Next time: will try frozen potatoes to save time (boiled cubed potatoes for 10min), will add salt and pepper for more flavor, may add some eggs (per my husband's request).

I liked it, but next time would use half an onion, and add some milk because the sauce was a bit sticky.

A big hit at potlucks.  I always use grated cheddar (not processed).  Sometimes I also add cubed chicken to make more hearty.

I thought it was pretty good, but my husband thought it was just ok.  This was the first dish I've made in almost 5 years that he wasn't in love with. Maybe I'll use other reviewer's suggestions and do cheddar cheese soup instead of mayo next time.

Fantastic side dish for any brunch!  Very filling.  I have made this several times and have used ham instead of bacon a few times.  Still tasted great!

This recipe rocks!  I liked it so much I made it for my parents when I went back home to visit.  Now my dad makes it all the time.  It's so goey and rich with cheese and bacon and onion flavor.  Great for breakfast lunch brunch or dinner!

I could eat the whole pot of potatoes.  I love this recipe - I made it with canned potatoes and did it in the crock pot and they were still creamy and delicious.  If I could marry Velveeta, I probably would.  Cheesy potatoes are the best.  :)

These were really good. I served them along a steak dinner with salad and everyone enjoyed them. They were good left over the next day too.

very good, but too rich to feel good about eating. will make again, but won't tell guests what's in it.
