I think these have great potential. I would definately double the sauce. This was very dry & the potato to cheese sauce ratio was way off. I'm thinking maybe this recipe calls for the smallest red potatoes("B" size), which wasn't specified, & I just used the size that came in the 5 lb bag I bought. Now I know & will definately try again:)

We loved these, but I did change it up a bit, hence the 4 stars instead of 5! This is a great base recipe to create something totally awesome... I used regular potatoes, doubled the sauce using light velveeta instead of the cheddar and adding a little more milk to thin it out a bit, garlic powder and seasoned salt to taste. I layered the potatoes (which I peeled), some cheese sauce, finely chopped onion, some shredded cheddar and a little blue cheese and then repeated the layers. LOVED the buttered cracker topping! This was a huge hit w/ me and my hubby! These will be made over and over! Thanks for sharing. :)

wow, scrumptious!!! My daughter wasn't sure she'd like it but had two full servings! I made one change: I added 3 chopped scallions to the sauce with the cheese just before pouring onto the potatoes. The sauce is very thick but cooks up delicious. Thanks a lot Cindy!

The sauce is too thick as written; it won't seep between your potatoes. Add another 1/2 c. (precooked potatoes) or whole cup (raw potatoes) of milk to the written roux. Reduce the cracker crumbs--as written this recipe fits in an 8x8, and you'll never get a cup and a half of crackers spread over that unless you like a really, really thick layer of crust on top. (1 cup is sufficient for a 9x13 pan!) Personally I skipped the precooking step--Yukon gold potatoes will cook to done from totally raw in an hour in recipes like this. (I did 40 mins at 350 and 20 mins at 400, because I had to put another dish in.) Thanks for the recipe, I rather liked the addition of dry mustard, gave it a sort of a tangy bite that we enjoyed.

This is yummy. I didn't melt the cheese in the milk mixture, I just added it between the potato layers. I used a combination of sharp cheddar and mozzarella cheese. It took an hour in the oven for me. Came out great!

Loved this dish.    I did double up on the cheese sauce and used my usual white potatoes rather than the red ones.  I used Club crackers for the topping and we were all fighting to get the top layer because it was so crunchy and delicious!  Very good flavor- thank you.

Should have read the reviews before making this.  My sauce just sat on top of the potatoes.  It was too thick to move through the potatoes.  Layering may be a better approach.  Or adding more milk to the roux...perhaps a cup and a half.

Yum!! I did double or triple the sauce since I am making lots. But layered the potatoes w/  the sauce and poured the rest over the top, thought it would be too runny but set up perfect!!  Added some chopped flat leaf parsley from my garden to the cracker mix and VOILA!  Best casserole potatos I've ever made!!

Like previous reviewers suggested, I doubled the sauce, and I agree it's a must.  I also replaced 1/2 the cracker crumbs with garlic & herb bread crumbs to give it a little kick.  They turned out amazingly good!

All of the measurements were off:  the rue too thick, there was way too much cracker crumb for a topping and the whole thing was bland.  In retrospect I should've known better - I did read the ingredients.  It's too bad that folks rate a recipe based upon how it tasted AFTER they fixed it.

This was tasty, rated it 3 because it called for way to much crumbs. If I make it again, it will be without any crumbs so we can taste the sauce, which was really good before combining with potatoes and topping it with crumbs.

Arrrggghhhh! Christmas Eve dinner! Wayyyyyy too many breadcrumbs. Use 1/2 cup instead. Cheese sauce was completely absorbed by crumbs on top,resulting in dry potatoes. Had to,put lads'of butter on them to eat them. Not my mothers recipe for sure. 4 red potatoes? What does that mean? They come in many many sizes. Weight would be a better measure. 4 servings what size?

Sauce was too thick, didn't taste creamy at all.  My boyfriend will eat almost anything and turned his note up at this.  I'd rather have the one out of the box.

Definately a keeper! I'm glad I read the other reviews and doubled the sauce and thinned it out just a little. Instead of bread crumbs, I grated some cheddar onto the top before baking. It was beautiful and delicious! Thanks Cindy!
