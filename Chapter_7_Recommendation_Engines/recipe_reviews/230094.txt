Everyone loved this dessert! My friends literally "10 out of 10!" To whoever said that bittersweet chocolate tastes bitter, you are just wrong. Bittersweet chocolate is very similar to semi-sweet; they are both sweeter than dark chocolate. Perhaps you used unsweetened chocolate, which is sometimes called "bitter chocolate," which I admit would taste quite awful. Don't forget the raspberry on top, it really enhances the dessert! I've been thinking of alternates to the raspberry flavor (even though it was awesome) ever since I made it, like substituting strawberry or blueberry jam, caramel (YES!), peanut butter... there are so many options. This is the perfect, versatile petit four for parties.

This recipe looked so good and tasted so bad.  When I was making it I questioned the use of bittersweet chocolate chips, but I went ahead and followed the recipe as written.  The chocolate was as bitter, even with the cream and jam added.  I took these to a potluck party and saw that they were sitting on plates uneaten all over the room.  From now on I will alter the recipe using the phyllo dough shells with a sweeter filling.

I loved this recipe, sometimes when I rush myself...I tend to pickup thee wrong ingredients.  Lesson learned!!!  This recipe called for phylo dough...well I bought lumpia wraps...Hello!  Didn't want to go back to the store, I went ahead an  used the wraps...yeah, it didn't turn out to my liking.  Phylo has a flakier texture n lumpia is well, made for lumpia!  Will redo with the phylo dough :)

I took a chance and doubled the recipe for a big party without trying it first.  It was a good call on my part.  I had to print 7 copies of the recipe and all 60 of them were gone!  Do NOT change a thing!!!

Delicious and easy to make!  I was a little worried about the bittersweet chocolate chips after reading the previous review but they taste like dark chocolate.  I couldn't find the raspberry squares bar at the store so I used a white chocolate bar instead.  I think the white chocolate really set it off.  Definitely a keeper at my house.

These are beautiful and Soooo good!! I used Ghiradelli semi-sweet instead of bittersweet and I'm glad I did. I also left off the piece of chocolate raspberry candy since I think the raspberry on top is just perfect. They were Very popular at the party and all were eaten! Will definitely make again. Oh, and these are SO easy!!

Made exactly as written.  Fabulous!!  My only minor problem was that I made the recipe the night before serving and the raspberries that I placed on top at the last minute rolled off.
