wow!! I have made this 3 times in the last month!! I add lemon juice and garlic while cooking the chicken and more lemon juice when it comes out of the oven and serve over rice. My 14 y/o son says "good mom i like that chicken stuff" which is high praise indeed from a boy who usually communicates in grunts!!

I made this for my boyfriend and my roommate. I used mozzarella cheese and less greenbeans than it called for because thta's what I had on hand. The BF and roomie LOVED it we ate the entire pan. They had one suggestion though...adding bacon. Which I intend to try next time in addition to using less mayo. It had a unique but not to scary or exotic flavor but a full cup of mayo is just a bit much for me so I would add maybe haf a cup the next time. All and all this is a winner.

I made this with stuff I had in the house and my husband loved it. Instead of the beans I minced and blanched some carrots and mixed them with some frozen baby peas. Instead of Sherry I used Chardonnay. Instead of 2 cans of cream of chicken soup I used 1 can of cream of chicken and 1 can of cream of mushroom. Sooooo yummy. Tasted like a chicken pot pie and the parmesan cheese made a low carb friendly crust. Delicious.

My husband loved this. he said next time I make it to use asparagus and add garlic to the sauce. Also I am going to add 1/2 cup of breadcrumbs mixed with 1 TBS of melted butter for the topping as well. It was so easy and delicious

This is an easy simple chicken dish which both my husband and i loved. I did substitute fresh asparagus chopped into bit size pieces for the green beans.

Very good. I used what I had in the house which was fresh asparagus instead of green beans and it turned out very well. Served over white rice.

I love this! I did change the soup for what I had on hand. I used 1 can cream chicken and 1 can cream of mushroom. I did add some pepper onion powder and a bit of red pepper flakes. This is the second time I made it and the first time I followed it as written. Turned out great both times. Oh and I added fresh grean beans from the garden:)

My husband surprised me by making this dish after a 6 hour drive with kids. It was great! I was unsure when he told me the ingredients but I liked it a lot. I think we'll customize it some more next time we make it. The sauce reminded me of his chicken cordon bleu so we may add some bacon or pancetta. I think that would taste great with the chicken.

I just did not care for the taste. The sauce was creamy and tangy and I did not think it went well together. I did not like the crunch of the green beans with the creaminess of the sauce. I was disappointed in this recipe.

This is rich a little goes a long way! The amount of sherry may almost be a bit too much but it's a flavor I like so it was fine with me. As much as we like this (and will have again I'm sure of it) this is a guilty pleasure; it's not the most healthful. BF loved this!

It was very good but there are some changes i made. i used low fat chicken soup and mayonnaise and it both worked. I used a little less mayonnaise then the recipe called for but i also think i should have used less of the chicken soup as well because it seemed a little soupy for me. overall it wasn't bad though!

I think the flavor of the mayo soup and sherry mixture was not nice at all. I won't be making this recipe again.

I will not make this dish again. I actually "rinsed" the casserole in the end to salvage the chicken. The mayo and sherry make this a VERY sweet casserole. The mayo is an extremely strong flavor. The Parmesan smells so pungent when you cook it but I knew that it would. I would substitute the mayo for sour cream or non-fat plain Greek yogurt with green chiles but that would make this...ohhh...a completely different recipe.

I'm not sure when describing a dish with condensed cream of chicken and mayonnaise that anyone would take you serious describing it as 'elegant' despite the sherry and nutmeg. I don't believe it would be all that difficult to come up with something similar from scratch and I certain you'd end up with an immeasurably better outcome. I won't be making this again and I'm pretty sure it will take a while to get my cooking cred back with my friends.

I've been using white pepper in a lot of things and prefer a little subtle kick in the spice department so I added about a teaspoon to a half portion recipe. I didn't have green beans or sherry so I used asparagus and Marsala and hubby and I both enjoyed it. Many variations and possibilities. Will definitely be doing this again. I'd probably add garlic next time but as with most recipes I like to try it as close to the original the first time and then make the modifications I like to match my tastes.

Super delicious dish. Was trying to think of something different for dinner last night and came across this. I copied what someone else did and added in some garlic and lemon juice while cooking the chicken. Smart idea. I also used asparagus instead of green beans since I like it better. Served over white rice. Will be making this again soon.

It's a keeper! That's what my family told me after I made this for dinner last night. This is so easy and so delicious. I used cream of chicken soup with herbs for a little more flavor. My family is not big on asparagus but I definitely agree that this would be a good substitute. This is now in my recipe box!

did make this for company. Instead of 1 cup mayo I used 1/2 cup Greek yogurt and half mayo. I thought the sauce was too thick so I added some chicken broth to thin it out some. since I used some Greek seasonings on the chicken I added some to the sauce as well. very tasty and easy to do ahead

I tried this recipe tonight with chicken thighs it was delicious! I read some of the reviews and added some garlic and used broccoli instead of the beans. Because this was just for the two of us I only used one can of cream of mushroom soup. All in all this was downright delicious. I gave it an A!
