I used this recipe all the time with good results. It halves well too! I like to add some cinnamon and nutmeg to spice it up.  It is a no fail recipe!

Got really hungry this morning and decided I wanted some pancakes.  I followed the recipe exactly except that I added a little bit of vanilla flavoring.  Added french vanilla cool whip to my end result with some pourable fruit.  Delicious.   Thanks for the post.

I hated this recipe! It was very easy to make, but that was about the only good thing about it! The pancakes weree horrible to try and flip, and turned out about as thin as paper! The taste was not bad, but it was not flavourful, there hardly was a taste! I am not making these "pancakes" again!

I made them this morning and had no problem with them. Nice and simple. I didn't grease the skillet.
